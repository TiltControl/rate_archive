All Stars 5 Reveal Day 2: It's Murphy's Law, My 11 Goes Out Tonight
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/t232zd/all_stars_5_reveal_day_2_its_murphys_law_my_11/

# Good morning to my Narcissus and Echos of the world!

Welcome to The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Popheads History, also known as the **All Stars 5 day 2 reveal**! I hope you all are excited for it and are ready to have a couple of broken hearts by the end of this! Today, we'll be revealing #52 - #27, starting officially at 2PM EST (that's in an hour)! Join us in the [beatsense room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) where a bunch of shenanigans are about to go down, including hints, the songs themselves, as well as some interludes when I find right! But- now, for some statistics!

* All Stars 5 had a total of [116](https://pastebin.com/cE5P9DMA) participants- (that’s one more than yesterday!), claps for all of you and you are now my favorites.
* The average score was 7.988, and the average controversy was 1.954! Anything over this can be considered controversial!

Charli has, somehow, become a bit of a sub faven't the past few months- and while I don't think it impacted this result in particular much, it was something to experience. This song is so cute, and it came at a much needed time in the pandemic.

---

#i'll love you forever

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Sell Out era?? Nah this was her Sell in era!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): i think its kind of disgusting that this is my highest sub favs score too but this is just such a comforting song to me, the melody of the chorus is just :happyhearts: , and the lyrics are simple but rly effective

**bbfan132** (10): beautiful

**bigbigbee** (10): the first time I see my friend in person in >2 years might be at an anime convention and I think that makes YOU the loser, not me. anyway this song makes me crazy emotional

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): For some reason I never expect this song to be as good as it is when I listen to it. There’s just something magical about it.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): hyperpop haters do not interact

**camerinian** (10): nobody does a noisy pop ballad like Charli. I hope this doesn't Crash (ahem) and burn because of the bad blood going round Charli right now, because this is still a gem

**hikkaru** (10): :catcry:

**homestarguy** (10): How I'm Feeling Now didn't grab me upon first or second listen...but this one etched itself into my brain for months. And it didn't complain. It's so direct yet not abrasive. My favorite Charli song.

**hunnybee12** (10): can we go back to this charli era ... please ...

**IIIHenryIII** (10): me singing this song to this song

**iniekcja\_** (10): guys I think she might be in love

**jman457** (10): Charli really pivoted here, capturing the early pandemic feeling of drinking the existential dread away into a state of euphoria

**nicolas<3** (10): if you get it you get if you dont you dont if you know you know

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I am not emotionally prepared for this to leave day 1

**runaway3212** (10): I wrote a whole essay if y’all wanna read it go to the reveal page of that rate im too tired to write again (runaway3212’s version)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I thought I overrated this, but listening to it again, I know I picked the right 11 for that rate

**TiltControls** (10): Congrats to Charli for making a song I'm willing to give a 10 to! In All Stars no less! I look forward to the next time we meet and I give yet another one of your albums a rough 5-6 average!

**UselessTacooo** (10): Choli EggsCeeEggs slayed

**wavingwolves** (10): the moment when i cried watching the music video for this for the first time... pandemic really did a whole thing on me

**trixiematthell** (9.6): wait i’m sad listening to this now

**akanewasright** (9): *cries in hyperpop*

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): i will always love u 2 choli

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Kinda wished the verses were less noisy but whatever

**skargardin** (9): A song made in such a short time span has no business being this good

**thedoctordances1940** (9): there's something about this song i don't like but i don't know what it is and at the same time i luv it

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.6): The static is a tad grating, but if you filter it out you get to a truly beautiful, sentimental pop song

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): HIFN deserved what DSB got. stream pink diamond!

**anothertown** (8): it's cute montage music

**BasedButta** (8): cool BUT YOU ARE HURTing my ears miss. respect for that

**bridgemoney** (8): Sucker is her best album fight me.

**ReallyCreative** (8): how long I wish Sia had been chained up in Beyonce's basement

**vayyiqra** (8): Still not the biggest fan of this album, but I like this. Love song but make it crunchy.

**GapeCod** (7): [I must take a stance against... the LGBTQ community, I hate to put that out there](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSepvkYTm/)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): so glad we’re giving this album another chance to flop

**waluigiest** (7): kind of iconic that this was so “of the time” that it had zero staying power

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.8): one of the better songs on this album

**NotWith10000Men** (6.6): oh hey it's the only charli song i like

#it was only just a dream

**ignitethephoenix** (6): once you get past the grating production at some parts, I think there is a good song here lyrically and melodically. The abrasiveness is so unnecessary at parts it makes me mad

**seanderlust** (6): i was going to tank this a bit but when i was playing this playlist with my partner this was the one song he was like "oh i like this!" so for him charli can have a couple extra points, as a treat

**Stryxen** (5.5): it just… doesn’t work for me like she intended - the more i listen to more i can hear it sounds very rushed and it distracts me from enjoying it lol

**jackisboredtoday** (5.1): a cute chorus that’s offset by how much I dislike the production choices she went with for the verses.

**flavasavavandal** (5): the highest I will ever rate hyperpop

**jsonphile** (5): when I originally did this rate, I didn’t understand Charli XCX at all, but thought that maybe some months or years down the line, I’d get her. That hasn’t happened yet but there’s still hope

**moonagenightmares** (5): i was surprised this wasnt awful

**rslashpoopheads** (5): y'all really listen to this?

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): this is cute but so mid

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this song illustrates a problem i have with a lot of charli xcx songs, which is that i feel like she adds noise/abrasion to her songs just for the sake of being noisy/abrasive. this song would be so much better if she played it off just like a normal pop song and didnt force it to be hyperpop

**Roxieloxie** (4): I dont like this

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i will hate this forever <3

**NFLfreak98** (2): Nope, still sounds like my headphones are being run through a trash compactor

**1998tweety** (0): what sucks so much about this song is it would actually be pretty good if not for the random noise at some points, and like it's not one of those songs where I feel like it's necessary, it actively takes away from the listening experience for me. I will never understand what y'all see in this song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): this was originally a 3 but i wanted to kill myself at that breakdown or whatever it was

And with that, our second rate is gone! Allie X managed to get further than the other two, as opposed to how she performed on her actual rate!

---

#the regulars

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Allie deserved to win the original rate

**akanewasright** (10): This song should have won the rate I hate you all

**bridgemoney** (10): If the rest of Dark Alt Pop sounded like this I might've done the rate.

**moonagenightmares** (10): DAP rate finally got me into this album and it was so good

**plastichaxan** (10): this is such a nice song to scream along to

**qazz23** (10): Very strong chorus and I love the dreamy sound (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we love the rate regulars that we can depend on to fill out most rates :noitstrue:

**runaway3212** (10): I feel very strongly about this song but to explain why I would have to overshare and my new year’s resolution is to #not anymore

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is going to be very robbed again

**UselessTacooo** (10): is it basic? Yes. Do I care? No. Sometimes generic is okay ❤️

**vayyiqra** (10): you wouldn't get Allie she doesn't fit in she's weird ok !

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): she looks like she came straight out of the American Horror Story universe

**1998tweety** (9): the chorus ate

**frogaranaman** (9): that bassline could destroy me

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's great but it's unfortunately day 1 fodder I fear

**rslashpoopheads** (9): ride em cowboy

**TiltControls** (9): Me and the 7 other rateheads who are just gonna speed through this rate

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): ok maybe i like her

**trixiematthell** (8.7): this is slut pop

**homestarguy** (8.5): A slick groove with infectious thumping bass. The chorus carries this song for me, especially the high vocal hits from Allie X.

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): ok so this is a good song but we wanted mitski in AS5!

**jman457** (8): This creates a really excellent mood

**skargardin** (8): bop

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): this song feels like velvet

**waluigiest** (8): no way, I know allie x she’s def with the freaks

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): she's not like the other girls she's a flop

**bbfan132** (7.5): this is pretty good but she has better songs for sure

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): one of the few good songs on cape FLOP

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.2): Very average sounding

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): it's cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is a bop but I just started noticing the fret squeaks and it’s ruining it for me a little.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): y'all really picked a good but not great song from this album when songs like Rings a Bell, June Gloom, Sarah Come Home, Susie Save Your Love, and Learning in Public were right there???

**GapeCod** (7): <------

**iniekcja\_** (7): I can hear it in a tv station ad

**musical\_pyn** (7): Love the hook but…not much else

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): lyrically the best of the dark alt pop trio but sonically the most bland

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): watching the music video for this one while i rate it why does allie x looks like a yassified voldemort

**just\_thonking** (6.5): Ok maybe the "Popheads will go crazy over any white girl doing basic synth pop" people have a point

#poppy and grimes

**BasedButta** (6): allie i like you but this is boring

**jasannn** (6): I think I was being nice to Allie X during this rate. I havent thought about that album since and this was one of the better songs. Its just pretty mid compared to everything else here.

**wavingwolves** (6): it's very... regular

**NotWith10000Men** (5.2): her music is very uninteresting to me aside from not so bad in la

**camerinian** (5): The sub has been trying to convince me that Allie X is “An All Star” for like every single one of these rates, and I just don’t believe you people anymore

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): it exists

**fadedblue09** (4): unremarkable

**flavasavavandal** (4): Allie X is one of most hyped and underrated people on this sub and I literally can’t remember a single thing about her, but if boring and halfway catchy does it for you

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Regular is how often I skip this

**anothertown** (3): i love allie but this has to be the most boring song ive ever heard

**RandomHypnotica** (10.000): probably one of the most unsatisfying winners of the last year (good reveal tho)

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): if only ~~akane's~~ the allie pick was more yass & slay...

**plastichaxan** (9.333): no cause this rate has such a hold on me it’s 3 of my favorite albums of 2020 and just aaaaaaaaaa i love it

**TiltControls** (9.333): Surprisingly there were a lot of great new discoveries here! Also glad that it was pretty fairly balanced until allie got completely destroyed in day 3 :didntseethat:. Anyways we love Akane and King hosting and the shitposts were every bit as good as expected to be

**runaway3212** (9.000): king & akane I love you both so much ur like allie x’s eyebrows if they existed

**AHSWeeknd** (8.667): This rate was ahead of it’s time

**rslashpoopheads** (8.333): Damn now I wish I had done this rate

**vayyiqra** (7.000): Never going to get over the pain of both Grimes AND Hana, my two most played artists of all time, with about 10K plays on my Lastfm between them, had just barely lost a rate to what I thought was a forgettable Poppy song. Good rate though! I mean besides that. And you all tanking Darkseid.

**Awkward\_King** (6.667): akane <3 we killed that

**fadedblue09** (5.333): I made the right call skipping this rate

And with that, another rate gone- this time, with men in it! I'm a bit shocked it was able to not be the first out with how bad I Want Your Sex did, but- I'm pleasantly surprised! They're icons, so I'm happy a bit of justice was done for them!

#like it dirty

**NotWith10000Men** (11): god how was michael this fucking talented

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): the way this song draws me in even before Michael starts singing

**AHSWeeknd** (10): my 11 in the original rate but my 0 in the re-up

**bbfan132** (10): this is excellent, one of his best

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): it’s so funny to me that MJ didn’t want to play this in front of Princess Diana out of respect and she wanted him to bc it’s funny.

**flavasavavandal** (10): guitar goes hard

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the weeknd cover of this is a serve too

**iniekcja\_** (10): girlbossing

**jaztinax** (10): whenever i hear this song i think about when MJ was performing in front of princess diana and he took it off the setlist to be respectful and she insisted he perform it. iconic

**musical\_pyn** (10): I can't believe SOPHIE produced the first five seconds of this song

**Roxieloxie** (10): :kirbysing:

**runaway3212** (10): This song is actually so perfect I literally love feeling like im gonna die after hearing it

**skargardin** (10): banger!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): yeah I can see why MJ swept that rate hard

**akanewasright** (9.8): The Weeknd cites a few reference points for the sleezier side of his persona, and this is the one I acknowledge the existence of!

**sweetnsaursauce11** (9.5): this song invented the phrasing "this slaps"

**anothertown** (9): the drama the anguish

**BasedButta** (9): ok this is great. refreshing to see a song with good, thought-out instrumental that flows with the vocals. who is this michael jackson guy anyway?

**bo\_g\_o** (9): honestly Michael should've done more hard rock songs because his hard rock cuts slap

**jsonphile** (9): MJ has better songs, but can’t deny this slaps, especially that guitar

**seanderlust** (9): icky vicky outsold

**TiltControls** (9): I always forget how many standout tracks are on this album since it gets overshadowed by Thriller, but this is one of his best!!

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): her scarf man era

**trixiematthell** (8.2): we are separating the art from the artist

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I love the melody and lyrics to this but that guitar solo is no Beat It I’m afraid.

**Uberpigeon** (8): gotta keep an eye out for dianer

**waluigiest** (8): high high high drama

**jman457** (7.6): The opening to this is proto-hyperpop

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.1): eh never was too big on much of Bad but this slaps a bit

**1998tweety** (7): dirty dan ended ha

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): where’s abel’s cover of this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the weeknd cover is a 10 though

**tkajilili** (7): it's not bad but I can't see myself returning to this unless I'm playing the full album

**vayyiqra** (7): Ngl this is a classic but not one of my favourite MJ songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Yeah, I’ve never been a fan of this song. It’s just not as catchy as the other Bad singles I guess. The storytelling is cool though

**welcome2thejam** (7): MJ has some nasty guitar work in his catalogue

**terrencelovescum** (6.2): i don't like the pronunciation/delivery of diana.

#would ask him to take it off the setlist

**camerinian** (6): Y’all, of all the songs from Bad you could have picked

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): imagine putting the sound of crowds cheering into your song

**homestarguy** (5.5): Beat It but slower.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I've never been a big fan of his voice. I could count on one hand the number of songs that I like from his whole discography

**jasannn** (5): the main hook sounds like Kpop ad libs

**Stryxen** (4): can’t stand mj’s voice but the song isn’t bad

**nicolas<3** (3): this was kind of really dramatic for no reason

**plastichaxan** (3): yall we could’ve voted in the way you make me feel and instead we went with this

**wavingwolves** (3): my mom has a michael jackson tattoo

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i am just going to say i like many michael jackson songs and this is not one of them!

**mudkip1** (2): this was always my least favorite of his hits

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): My first rate and honestly my favourite, the plug.dj reveal was everything, it was a simpler time 😌

**runaway3212** (10.000): my rate was such a slay honestly every other host had trouble competing but I guess they tried and failed oh well they’re still perfect

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): jules! unfortunately wasn't around for this rate

**TiltControls** (8.167): Prince and George Michael had the unfortunate matchup against MJ in his prime (Janet and Madonna can relate). But really all 3 albums were strong. Jules did a great job hosting here too! Deserved more participants than it ended up getting!

**vayyiqra** (7.333): A pretty alright rate that I wish I had given myself more time to do instead of speedrunning it.

**bigbigbee** (6.167): Despite what my average might say, I really really loved this rate (I just happened to like other songs more!) I think that rates that center pop music history are really cool and important, and these acts were SO popular. These albums felt like “required reading”, and I’m so glad that popheads inspired me to listen to them through!

**Awkward\_King** (3.667): ME MAKING FUN OF JULES FOR HAVING A FLOP RATE ONLY FOR 00S MCS TO FLOP JUST AS HARD EXACTLY A YEAR LATER JASDJASJD

**plastichaxan** (3.333): in retrospect this is not my favorite rate, im sorry, it’s just not something i enjoy for the most part, i like the artists and can tell they had tremendous influence on many artists to come but i simply do not enjoy these songs that much

#september

**Cucugeniality** (11): it's one of my favorite songs of all time and my favorite taylor song overall

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I really wanted to give my 11 to Houdini again, but I didn't send my ballot for the 2020 Ultimate Rate, so "august" it is

**ricki** (11): it makes me feel fuzzy and happy:) <3

**1998tweety** (10): instant classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s January, get a calendar.

**bigbigbee** (10): To the person who commented that they thought she said “one ting was enough”, fuck you, now that’s all I can hear

**bo\_g\_o** (10): swifties who gave this their 11 it's not gonna happen

**flavasavavandal** (10): a resentful 10

**hikkaru** (10): the anti swiftie brigade will tank this but this is actually the best song ever omfg seethe

**ImADudeDuh** (10): remember how afraid people are of rating taylor swift ever again even though she only has one rate win

**jasannn** (10): LEOS RISE UP

**jman457** (10): ok ill admit. Folklore turned me from a Taylor-anti to a taylor fan. I can just hear the crushing nostalgia and loss of innocence here, with the hot summer days turning to melancholic fall days.

**letsallpoo** (10): Salt air and the rust on your door .... 😊

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the song that convinced me to like taylor… it's gorgeous and is gonna be robbed

**runaway3212** (10): prefer september tbh but also this song is perfect

**shhhneak** (10): Oouu this is going to get sabotaged I fear. Invisible String should’ve been sacrificed instead.

**skargardin** (10): kinda like the best song ever i think

**Stryxen** (10): its a 10 and i love taylor swift - im scared to admit this because the anti taylor swift circlejerk can be even weirder than swifties themselves um

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): once again proving that taylor's strengths are her bridges

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is a 10 but I would 11 the after hours title track

**wavingwolves** (10): words cannot explain the joy, the serotonin rush, the brain tingles i go through during this 4 minute and 21 second slay.. actually im not done this is one of the best song ever made. Top 10 ultimate slays in this ever expanding universe. No just think about it we've come so far in life, from the first yass particle developing into the home we know now. From the dinosaurs roaming the land we walk on to Pangea changing the game and leaving triceratops shook.. to the cavepeople to gravity being discovered to light being created to technology to automobiles to tvs to phones to this point in time where someones brain can decide to put together different instruments and sounds to create an experience that brings me oh so much excitement and happiness. Thank you Taylor for your contribution to society, you will never be forgotten in my heart and many more across the globe <3

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.2): I am not a Swiftie I am not a Swiftie I am not a Sw—REMEMBER WHEN I PULLED UP AND SAID GET IN THE CAR

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): tbh every line reads like a 14-year-old’s angsty MySpace post

**bridgemoney** (9): One of my favorite indie artists.

**cremeebrulee** (9): "wanting was enough / for me, it was enough / to live for the hope of it all" what compelled her to write this line . because i have not been the same person since

**iniekcja\_** (9): today i found out that the melody randomly playing in my head every now and then is actually from this exact song

**jaztinax** (9): a little overrated but still solid

**jsonphile** (9): be prepared for every August 31 people saying “wow august sure did slip away like a bottle of wine” as if they’re the first person to come up with it

**mudkip1** (9): SWEETENERMORE WHEN?!?!?!?!? MODS, YOU HAVE SOME ANSWERING TO DO!!

**nicolas<3** (9): what a nice silly little song

**sufjancaesar** (9): Unfortunately good

**terrencelovescum** (9): the first taylor album i listened to in full and i was impressed by the blank space and me! girl. the highlight of the album i must say.

**TiltControls** (9): It's good. I'm a little surprised this is the fan fave on the album, but again it's good

**waluigiest** (9): “canceled my plans just in case you called” she knew what she was doing

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): :catcry:

**trixiematthell** (8.2): my og folklore fave, she has since been replaced tho

**akanewasright** (8): y’all really chose this over exile and my tears ricochet and mirrorball as the fan favorite huh? ~~you chose wrong but this is still very good~~

**Awkward\_King** (8): i wish this song didnt mean anything to me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): For some reason this just doesn’t hit as hard as it did when the album dropped. Still really good tho.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): giving this an extra point bc for some reason i was thinking of cardigan so when this came on i was pleasantly surprised

**Uberpigeon** (8): ugh wait this is good...

**seanderlust** (7.8): the one of the folklore trilogy that took a while to grow on me but eventually did. Betty clicked with me, MTR...well maybe someday :sob:

**BasedButta** (7.5): very pretty song but anyway stan august by mary oliver (really, its a great poem)

**homestarguy** (7.5): I'll get roasted for this take, but I want to love this song. It just peaks way too early on, and the chorus just doesn't quite do it for me. Love the expression of nostalgia for the fear of summer ending a lot though.

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): sounds like background music at pottery barn

**anothertown** (7): this is one of the ones I liked off of folklore not much more to say init

**bbfan132** (7): personally not a huge fan but it’s pretty good

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): it’s nice

**nootnoot781** (7): 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅

**rslashpoopheads** (7): this is a very okay song

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): as per usual with every Taylor song I like the instrumental parts more

**UselessTacooo** (7): I have never gotten the hype for august. It’s definitely good, but I wouldn’t call it the best song on the album or All Stars worthy

**vayyiqra** (7): Making us rate Taylor again is kind of :tomato: but I guess I like this song? Coffeeshop-core music but good. Very Jackoff sound to it. Taylor lyric about cars. Whatever.

#july

**fadedblue09** (6): is this the Teardrops on My Guitar girl

**IdiotBox01** (6): a decent attempt at 90s dream pop

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I’ve seen tons of fanfiction with *folklore*/*evermore* themed titles since those albums dropped so I’d like to thank Taylor for giving my girls some juice but unfortunately this is fairly middling… I think it’s the way the vocals are processed, she just doesn’t have the kind of warm voice that would make this song great. A Natasha Beddingfield, Leslie Mills, or Vanessa Carlton type would have eaten this UP

**MrMoodle** (5): so i totally get WHY people love this song, but it has a few real headscratchers that make it hard to get into. for one, the song just opens really abruptly, it sounds bizarre and doesn’t flow well at all, maybe it’s better in the context of the album? then in the second repetition of the bridge, she says "remember when I pulled up and said 'get in the car'" and then it goes quiet, but then the instrumental comes back in hard for "AND THEN CANCELLED MY PLANS..." like they were trying SO hard to have a cathartic moment there, but there wasn’t nearly enough buildup? i understand the instrumentation is very lush and i love the main hook, but it feels like people are worshipping the song this SHOULD’VE been, not what it is.

**nt96** (5): No it's February

**Roxieloxie** (5): well

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (4.5): Taylor is a wonderful songwriter but also I got bored

**2dina3dworld** (4): the only good Folklore tracks are the ones where she’s salty as fuck or telling a story. This is neither of the two.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): I grossly overrated Folklore in the 2020 ultimate, and this song in particular is so boring

**static\_int\_husp** (4): I might be a swiftie but I'll be damned if she's getting far with this song

**apatel27** (3): it's just boring

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): you are not caitlin covington

**frogaranaman** (1): I got this song overplayed for me and now I hate it sorry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): swifties when the worst song you’ve ever heard in your life comes on

**DefaultPophead** (0): I prefer He Man's and 4 Non Blonde's versions.

**plastichaxan** (0): i think it's no secret i'm not a fan of taylor and honestly i can enjoy some songs, this is not one of them, this is one of her songs that make me wonder why people just choose this over actual good songs from folklore and i honestly can't figure it out

KPOP out! I'm as shocked as you guys are, especially with smackdown being right before and getting such high attendance, I thought the k-pop songs would get a small boost, but kinda the opposite happened?

---

#the chaser

**GapeCod** (11): Leading cause of divorce in popheads rates-adjacent spinoff discord servers.

**hunnybee12** (11): INFINITE PAVED THE WAY!!!!!!!!!

**xearomis** (11): True pop perfection, Sweetune don’t miss

**1998tweety** (10): pop perfection

**akanewasright** (10): This key change moved mountains

**bigbigbee** (10): the single best use of “eh-eh-eh” in kpop and that’s a high compliment, k-pop lyricists around 2010 used that one a LOT

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s just so dramatic! I love it!

**bo\_g\_o** (10): nice to see that key changes are alive and well

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): legendaric

**fadedblue09** (10): after this lost its rate, I was unable to play this song for months

**hikkaru** (10): CAR CRASH GIF

**jasannn** (10): Although I rarely revisit this, I still have to give this a 10. It’s so dramatic with so much tension that pays off. Everything is amazing from the production to the melody to the performance to the arrangement.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): gays when they hear a key change in a pop song

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I genuinely think this is the best k-pop song in existence. Every 30 seconds offers something new - it’s a song that is insanely ecstatic from its first second, yet it just keeps building and building, and the payoff, when you hear that final chorus, is truly phenomenal

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): so close to being my eleven

**ricki** (10): the euphoria

**runaway3212** (10): THIS IS LIKE VROOM VROOM BUT EVEN BETTER

**skargardin** (10): omg what a SMASH

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is actually one of the best kpop songs of all time

**TiltControls** (10): ANOTHER 11 THAT DESERVES EVERYTHING PLEASE DO IT RIGHT IN THE RESULTS

**wavingwolves** (10): only the most intellectual of people can fully comprehend this level of artistry

**welcome2thejam** (10): Favorite discovery of this rate. A song in search of a nighttime street to race thru

**homestarguy** (9.5): Just full speed ahead pop on this one unlike any pop song I've ever heard. That repeated note that bends downward just sinks into me each time.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): when you start the final lap in mario kart

**bbfan132** (9): this production is awesome

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Maybe it’s just that I happened to ride my bike down a big hill while listening to this and felt like I was flying but this slaps

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ok this free on me

**MrMoodle** (9): man, the only kpop boy band i’d really actively listened to before this was BTS and i didn’t feel like i got it, but 100% i get this. really being opened up to a new world here lol, i think i respect the genre a lot more than i did previously

**rslashpoopheads** (9): exactly kings

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): this slaps

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.7): Structurally and sonically a bit of a mess but yeah this still bangs

**BasedButta** (8.5): i think this would be better if a girl group sang it, rare moment where i give a shit about the vocals

**camerinian** (8): Time to bring on The Chaser, but who will we be playing today? Could it be The Sinnerman? So smug, even Pitchfork have turned down his column proposals. Or could it be the Dark Destroyer? He only comes on to Popheads for the thrill of the Town Hall threads. Or maybe The Vixen? So hot, Billboard has had to re-balance its formulas again. Perhaps it's The Beast? The Mind Mountain, so at least you won't confuse him for Shakira's breasts. Or could it be The Governess? She only beat Carly Rae Jepsen in a swordfight because she brought along a chainsaw.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): that noise in the beginning that comes back in the rap part (I have no idea how to describe it), I'm obsessed with it and totally sold me on this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): it sounds like if linkin park made a kpop song

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.8): wow that rap went hard

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the K-pop fans say this is the best song here but I’ve listened to it a few times and I don’t get the hype. It’s good but doesn’t blow me amazing, the production sounds like knock off Mario kart and detracts from the rest of the song. I think part of the reason this hyped up by people is because it’s by a lesser known group/label but it’s probably just not my thing lol

**trixiematthell** (7.5): okay this was fun

**frogaranaman** (7): oh this slaps

**ReallyCreative** (7): the production is getting in the way a bit

**Roxieloxie** (7): i dont get the love for this one im sorry

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Those fake horns in the chorus have the magical power to make everything sound incredibly cheesy

**jman457** (6.7): Like the instrumental but the song gets worse as it progresses

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): I don't dig the singing but it's kinda fun nevertheless

**moonagenightmares** (6.3): top 5 most overrated kpop songs of all time. and its not even their best song

#the cheese

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Nailed the vocals tbh

**tkajilili** (6): kpop is catchy but it honestly sounds so similar to me

**waluigiest** (6): evil mario kart

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): i feel like i'm missing context for why this was such a frontrunner. it's alright, but arguably my least favorite of the bg songs.

**nicolas<3** (5): giving filler kpop song

**UselessTacooo** (4): this weeooo production has got to go

**iniekcja\_** (3): I considered giving it a zero but i don't think it's THAT bad after all

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): i think this is a case of a song just feeling overwhelming musically, i hate the critique of "there's so much going on" because usually i like maxmilaism but i think it just is shutting my brain down dakjsjd

**MoonlightByWindow** (10.333): i hosted this rate so…now everyone go stan SEVENTEEN as this is the only place i can say that without being mega annoying <3

**GapeCod** (10.333): This reveal was even more traumatic than Nu-Disco for me, lmao. I literally quit rates for the rest of the year afterwards ☠☠☠. A new SHINEE anti was born that weekend.

**wavingwolves** (10.333): i hosted this

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): ...so sad that I don't have a 10 average for this rate...

**bigbigbee** (9.333): I screamed when this was announced and I’d fookin do it again

**runaway3212** (9.333): this rate got me into kpop so now y’all know who to blame

**TiltControls** (8.833): My K-pop knowledge going into this was next to none and even then there was so many standout tracks from the rate! So excited to do smackdown too! Shoutout to belb and Gucci for making it so easy to get into without Kpop knowledge with all the listening parties and music vid linking/promo. And the reveals were so much fun too!

**vayyiqra** (8.333): I didn't do this rate I got my ballot half done and gave up because I didn't know anything in it sorry !

**AHSWeeknd** (8.000): I didn’t attend this rate but it seemed interesting

**plastichaxan** (6.167): this rate made me start calling some rates discovery rates, in the sense that they help me discover music i’ve wanted to listen for a while and give me something to listen to for a while, unfortunately none of those songs made it

**fadedblue09** (6.000): One of my most anticipated rates last year turned out to be the biggest disappointment…you hate to see it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.833): I don't want to tank these too much just because they're not for me but still

#aoc

**bbfan132** (10): insert aoc dancing to this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes this album is kind of the same song 10 times. But it’s a really great song!

**bridgemoney** (10): 2009 was a much simpler time.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): BOP

**homestarguy** (10): A staple of many playlists in the early 2010s for me, and it still puts the hugest grin on my face every time I hear it still.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I don’t mean to be rude, but Indie Pop Rock had the best collection of songs of all rates

**qazz23** (10): Love the guitar throughout and the chorus, outro is amazing (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://i.imgur.com/U27g8me.png

**skargardin** (10): Absolute classic!! I loved rediscovering this last year, god what a song

**Stryxen** (10): hey kids spelling is fun

**TiltControls** (10): WAP won so it's not here and WAP didn't get voted in so I'm pulling for WAP to take their energies and do well against misandry!

**vayyiqra** (10): AOC dancing gif

**welcome2thejam** (10): The bounce of this song is unmatched

**bigbigbee** (9): scratches the theater kid itch in me

**fadedblue09** (9): We love the only IPR song with a shot at Day 2

**ReallyCreative** (9): we're afraid of lists now? is that what this is?

**rslashpoopheads** (9): I love Weezer

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.8): a whole bop

**jman457** (8.6): Classic, even though it can get annoying. (1901 is better)

**akanewasright** (8.5): I love AOC

**trixiematthell** (8.4): i will absolutely be listening to this after the rate

**Roxieloxie** (8): aoc anthem

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I have no idea who they are but this is nice

**waluigiest** (8): come on pandora-core

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s cute but it’s also certainly an indie pop rock track

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): it's neat

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): If AOC ever runs for president I hope she makes this her campaign song

**seanderlust** (7.2): category is: the drag race queen that we are happy to see come back for all stars and that people generally like but that is leaving early because the lineup is otherwise full of bangers

**BasedButta** (7): a bit too soft but i get it

**camerinian** (7): this is like the one spot on the album where the lyrical eccentricities kinda get in the way of the incredible indie bounce. 1901 deserved

**flavasavavandal** (7): not my sound but kinda works

**hikkaru** (7): i prefer 1901 tbh

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): easily the best out of the IPR songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): 1901 outsold but this is still nice

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

#who cares old guy play the hits

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I don’t know how to pronounce that title (even though they say it in the song) 😭

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.9): lizzomania? so this is what popheads circlejerk is talking about

**UselessTacooo** (5): these vocals are kinda messy and I’m not a big fan

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Sometimes songs that are radio hits… are bad

**NotWith10000Men** (2.5): WHY DO ALL DUDES IN INDIE BANDS SOUND LIKE THIS

**wavingwolves** (1): this sounds like music that would play in a headphones commercial that would feature people of at least 3 different ethnic backgrounds and they would be smiling and one of them would pet a golden retriever

And with this, we say goodbye to the gamers. It was probably my favorite rate of last year, it was just so much fun uniting my two hobbies (gaming and music). Give Simple and Clean your 11s in all winners!

---

#gamer rights

**Alumineous** (11): As LD would say, it’s good to be back! THIS is my All Stars AND VGV 11, not that goddamn 8 I gave before. Where do I begin? First, thank you Ghost-Quartet for getting the song in the VGV rate. You are as cool as Sam Day Break himself. As for the song itself, it’s just a concoction of all the things I love. The sax bridge, the city pop song structure, Starlight’s AMAZING feature at 2.16, the blatant Tatsuro Yamashita Sparkle inspiration for the track, voCALS, and more! But it’s more than that. This was a gateway drug to many genres that I now religiously follow. Retrowave. Outrun. City pop, in particular, funk and boogie. And I guess vaporwave, too. I don’t want to sound ott but this song kinda changed my life. In a good way.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This song is a MASTERPIECE and god bless whoever bullied Tilt into including it in the original VGV Rate. I’ll just never get tired of listening to this! It hones in on all of the best elements of cheesy ‘80s plastic elevator pop, sort of like vaporwave, but instead of mystifying them it elevates them to the heavens. The simple synth chords that anchor it, the subtle but hard hitting drum patterns, the way those horns punch in and out of the song at just the right moments, and of course that iconic sax solo; it’s a flawless composition and it compliments the vocals perfectly. Fiona Lynch just bodies it too, she brings a lot of personality to the track without getting in the way of the instrumental and she hits ALL the right notes. Slam dunk, home run, high score, whatever you wanna call it this song is *it*.

**musical\_pyn** (11): this is legitimately one of the best songs I've heard in years

**seanderlust** (11): one of the greatest songs ever made I'm not even being hyperbolic. just when you think it can't climax any higher, here comes the saxophone with the steel chair! here come some immaculate vocal runs! i'm not kidding i'm saving up for a switch literally so i can play this game because i like this song so much.

**akanewasright** (10): I loved this song so much in its rate that i bought the game on switch! I had fun with it, but also I had my wisdom teeth out right around the time I picked it up, and also I had a breakdown where I convinced myself a close friend of mine died/hated me, so I never finished it. But this song slaps so!

**anothertown** (10): the investigator is here =)

**bo\_g\_o** (10): we stan saxophone solos!

**cremeebrulee** (10): idk about 25 being the age i stay forever... my lower back is already in shambles

**homestarguy** (10): Now THIS is some flawless city pop. That sax solo!

**jman457** (10): one of my favorite discoveries of this rate. But fr is this actually city pop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This is an excellent example of modern-day city pop! The picky producer nerd in me wishes the song would go into a full key change when the sax solo happens but it just …doesn’t. Also I've never played the game but I hope it's good!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): sexy sex for sexy sexers

**Roxieloxie** (10): why does this go so hard

**skargardin** (10): After playing Paradise Killer it's time to bump this up to a full 10

**throwaway-7650** (10): love ~~yukika~~ I mean city pop

**TiltControls** (10): Shoutout to Ghost and Hypno who bullied this into VGV and being 100% right for it

**UselessTacooo** (10): I was not expecting this to be nearly as grand as it was. Somehow a song I never heard went to become an 11 contender within the blink of an eye.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.7): a e s t h e t i c

**bigbigbee** (9): mea culpa, I was wrong. this song is sooooooo good and I apologize for my mid score in the video game vocal rate. 

 

 Side note, this game looks great but is way more involved than I expected. (3D sections?!?) Indie devs, stop making such good games! my computer can't run them! go back to when you made Escape The Phone Booth and it ran on Newgrounds on Windows XP!

**camerinian** (9): what the fuck is this game and artist I’ve never heard of doing making such a sexy bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): oh these city pop vibes... im gagged!

**hikkaru** (9): the sax solo i died again

**rslashpoopheads** (9): ok I actually tried playing this game and it gave me such intense motion sickness but I've literally never experienced motion sickness before in my entire life like I spin the teacups at amusement parks like a psychopath and it doesn't affect me at all but this game had me crying screaming vomiting rolling on the floor

**waluigiest** (9): wait this is amazing?

**wavingwolves** (9): sax emoji

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): it's very good but I just don't think it stacks up against the best in this rate

**1998tweety** (8.5): groovy

**jsonphile** (8.5): okay for a video game song this kinda slaps. Sounds like a 80s Gloria Estefan song. And that sax?? Ooh yeah

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Very saxy song!

**frogaranaman** (8): the SAX LINE

**jaztinax** (8): this sounds like a song from 40 years ago and i love it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is a banger, i love when video game music can absolutely be mistaken as just a normal pop song anyone can enjoy

**Uberpigeon** (8): maybe hypno spilled

**vayyiqra** (8): My second "unironically this is city pop" comment of the rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this snapped way harder than it should for a video game

**BasedButta** (7.5): simple jam

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun song! reminds me of karaoke but in an endearing way

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Honestly good

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I never liked this song, me neither and it's the first time I'm hearing it (guess the saxophone solo just made me change my mind, but I'll keep my initial comment cuz it's funny and I want it to make it to the banner (?))

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): oh this is a bop

**runaway3212** (7): a whole yasser

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): I have Danganronpa 2 OST, I have Yukika, DR2 OST Yukika Apple Pen

**trixiematthell** (6.8): she’s kind of a bop

#could not beat he cuphead tutorial

**slimboyfriend** (6): I’ve never heard of this game before but just listening to this song lets me know that it’s gay

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6): i can't fault the instrumental

**nicolas<3** (5): not a lot of thoughts about this one

**sufjancaesar** (4): Sounds like karaoke, I would 0 this but the instrumental in the 2nd half bangs

**Awkward\_King** (3): this is sexy and smooth as fuck but i cant lie it does nothing for me and i just pretended to go along with all the hype during vgv bc i didnt have a real reason why i didnt like it i think i just found the vocalist kind of annoying and felt like the track was too much like an exaggerated replica of the style it is emulating

#lucky charms

**waluigiest** (11): I’m giving this my 11 because, while many of my favorite rate songs made it to all stars, this one stands out because I was introduced to it THROUGH the rate. I feel so blessed. This song, and the whole album, are the perfect blend of dramatic and energetic and fun neo-disco. It’s been the energy I needed in times when I really felt low this past year. This song tells a whole story, and lets you sit in your feelings and also shake some ass. Perfection! I love doing rates!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Murphy’s Law is an aesthetic isn’t it?

**bbfan132** (10): i will always cherish the time i heard this in a macy’s fitting room

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The story telling. The production. The build up. The groove. It’s all here. It’s all present.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i reeeeeaaaally hope this being longer doesnt rob it of its deserved top 10 finish

**GapeCod** (10): :grinny: if this ends up stealing 11s off of Narcissus I'll be disappointed, but also given how poorly GOMW performed in AS4 and how Kylie got obliterated like a bathhouse bottom during the rate... It probably is for the best that Róisín is taking her place here. But yeah this song is amazing, obviously.

**just\_thonking** (10): For a song named after how things always go wrong, everything really goes right here

**mudkip1** (10): maybe the best disco song EVER?!?!?!?

**musical\_pyn** (10): something more would have gotten my 11 I think

**qazz23** (10): One of the best off the album (11 candidate)

**ReallyCreative** (10): the living room performances I've done to this song... the rent is due every time!

**Roxieloxie** (10): :tittygif:

**rslashpoopheads** (10): exactly queen

**seanderlust** (10): I can't even put my finger on why roisin's album is one of my 2020 favorites other than it's just so yass and slay

**skargardin** (10): The storytelling of this song is nothing short of a triumph, what an absolutely magnificent song in an album packed with so many irresistible songs.

**Stryxen** (10): one of my favourite songs ever! Her lyrics are great, her slayage is vocal - the production is perfect and the beat is so catchy - and it reminds me of a great time in life. Also fun fact the “small town” she is singing about is probably the city i live in lol she used to live where i do!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): I wanted miss a thing but this title is iconic

**welcome2thejam** (10): You think she was keeping this song title/concept in her back pocket til she could give it the home run it deserves?

**1998tweety** (9): serve

**nicolas<3** (9): it kind of makes me wanna dance

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.6): A chill bop, and I love the warmness of her low alto voice

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): sue me then

**jman457** (8.3): Her voice sounds so good here

**akanewasright** (8): if and when this beats Narcissus, heads will roll. We got the order of these right the first time, and I’m preparing for disappointment

**anothertown** (8): coupon coupon coupon coupon coupon

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it started out great but became tiring and monotonous after awhile

**runaway3212** (8): Murphy’s law is this going out day 2

**homestarguy** (7.5): More of a classic disco song, enjoyed this one better. Infectious hook.

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): decent but unnecessarily long and bloated

**trixiematthell** (7.2): nice lil moment

**Awkward\_King** (7): the chorus of claps in the background give the song a weird gospel undertone which actually really fucking works.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): I don’t remember what Murphy’s law is to appreciate what this is about but I love the piano and clapping

**jsonphile** (7): sorry it’s fine but any song longer than 5 minutes better have a good reason for it and this song doesn’t

**UselessTacooo** (7): cute

**vayyiqra** (7): A little cheesy but well-made and catchy.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): nice house beat, i like the lyrical concept but the production could use a bit more actual progression because it just glides along too understated for me

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.3): could’ve faded out a bit earlier tbh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.1): is it rude if i say she sings like the old man from family guy

#it's murphy's law, this song was still in!

**bigbigbee** (6): oh dear I think I have attention span problems : (

**ignitethephoenix** (6): still don’t get the hype for this song like it’s vibey but very one note and kind of boring. It’s listenable though just drags a lot

**plastichaxan** (6): still not feeling her much sorry

**TiltControls** (6): "Anything that can go wrong will" so I'm assuming Taylor wins AS5 then?

**BasedButta** (5): disco being boring is a sin

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this was like disco music but without the payoff for a long buildup

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): literally the only bad song on this album

**tkajilili** (4): Not a fan of her songwriting style TBH, and I HATE the outro. But other than that, it's fine, I guess.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this is just the same exact song as the last one

**sweetnsaursauce11** (2): this does not need to be 6 minutes long oh my god

**joeeswift** (0): this was a chore to listen to

I remember this being taken as a very ??? pick on the Discord and I somewhat agree? I don't know, I guess it's good but ~~I never really clicked much with Tidal~~. We'll see if Tori does any better!

#Taylor Swift - Wildest Dreams

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Fiona’s earlier work >>> and later work tbh >>>>

**bbfan132** (10): love this as an intro to tidal

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): YOU SAY LOVE IS A HELL YOU CANNOT BEAR AND I SAY GIVE ME MINE BACK THEN GO THERE FOR ALL I CARE

**fadedblue09** (10): Smh @ the disrespectful reactions to this when it got revealed as a pick...nonetheless its inclusion made me feel validated

**nt96** (10): One of the most hard-hitting openers a 17 year old has ever opened with.

**plastichaxan** (10): weird choice to send in but i can't make it not bop

**qazz23** (10): Great way to start a career

**Stryxen** (10): gosh i wish i 11d this the first time round

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): what the fuck do you mean she wrote this when she was 14

**UselessTacooo** (10): Fiona has a nearly perfect discography, and this is proof.

**waluigiest** (10): if I were 15 years older I would stan this woman like it was paying my rent

**wavingwolves** (10): and what if i don't sleep

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): One of my favorites off of Tidal, the melody is so good

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (9): I love angry songs

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): There’s so many hot lyrics in this, it should be a Tik Tok hit

**homestarguy** (9): Absolutely the love the sheer attitude Fiona brings to this one, all the while the instrumental feels like it wants to slip into a dream-like abyss at any moment.

**iniekcja\_** (9): omg a cenobite

**Roxieloxie** (9): i have no idea how this got voted in but ok

**rslashpoopheads** (9): early Fiona was so good

**TiltControls** (9): Best song on the album, but the competition is tough in this rate

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): she ended him

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): fiona easily outsold the others in this rate

**seanderlust** (8.3): god this was powerful songwriting from a 14 year old.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is just a nice, solid Fiona Apple song. It gives you what you came for.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i think i could listen to anything fiona puts to music

**vayyiqra** (8): Listening to Fiona often makes me feel like I'm stupid because I don't like her more but I like this

**trixiematthell** (7.9): i’ve never understood fiona but this is nice

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): I wanted to like this a lot to give three 10’s but I’m just not feeling the same connection with this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.2): Watch out we got a badass over here

**apatel27** (7): Never been that big into Fiona

**jman457** (6.7): tbh this album isnt that good outside of criminal

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I’m always surprised at how consistent Fiona’s sound was, from Day 1. I’ve only heard FTBC and this sounds like it would fit right into that (by my untrained ear). That being said, I do think that this hurts this song’s score a little, because all Fiona is good Fiona, to me, but this one doesn’t stand out in the field? It is good though, to be clear

**jasannn** (6.5): the outro makes me feel like dorothy from the wizard of oz.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): good but kinda goes on too long

#Halsey - Nightmare

**runaway3212** (6): sleeping? Could never be me.

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): this dreary ass song is making me tired

**sweetnsaursauce11** (5): it's fine

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i like the rambleyness of this a lot, in fact i think thats what a lot of my favourite fiona songs are, but i dont think this is her most dynamic at all

Oh, Katherine. How far we've come. The fact this was the one of the Teenage Dream singles to not go to #1 is really funny, but- I don't think it's unreasonable. It's just... not exactly the same vibe as the others, a bit more somber in tone than the rest of the album. I still love it!

---

#five #1 singles

**1998tweety** (10): IN ANOTHA LIFEEEEE, one of her best songs periodt. 13-year-old me was in my feels with this song.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The best song off Teenage Dream

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What an immaculate run of singles.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): of the nine million teenage dud songs that went #1 this wasn't one of them... jail!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): yes I have feelings

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that's her best song, there's no arguing with that (I'm a sucker for sad bops)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the fucking smasha

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is still katy's peak tbh

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): deserved better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): katy @ this song when it was the only single off teenage dream to not hit number one

**throwaway-7650** (10): this having the best recurrent stats W

**TiltControls** (10): In another life I would be your 11-er

**UselessTacooo** (10): the fact this song broke her #1s streak is Criminal. It’s the best song on the album.

**xearomis** (10): One of her best songs

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): yeah it's basic af no i do not care

**akanewasright** (9): This song made me cry over a fake boyfriend… and people wonder why I’m in therapy

**apatel27** (9): One of the few bright spots on TD

**jaztinax** (9): i like acoustic versions of this better bc the story is kind of cute

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): omfg 9yo me would cry her eyes out to this song for no reason

**skargardin** (9): One of her best singles I think

**bridgemoney** (8.7): Maybe its good he got away, who the hell chooses Radiohead as their make out music?

**bbfan132** (8.5): brings me back to 2010

**homestarguy** (8.5): Forgot about this one. What a cute little song this is. Nostalgic lyrics, a driving beat, and some pretty piano. Love it.

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): her most mature song methinks

**trixiematthell** (8.3): i was so over emotional to this aged 10

**jman457** (8.2): This song is a bit hard to rate due to personal reasons

**frogaranaman** (8): easily one of the songs ever

**IdiotBox01** (8): what radiohead song were they listening to to the fuck

**runaway3212** (8): this is literally me

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): the fact that this was the Teenage Dream single that missed #1 will never not be funny

**shhhneak** (7.1): Acoustic version cause this beat kinda sucks >>>>>

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.1): It’s… not the best sad song but it gets the job done

**camerinian** (7): no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I can't scrub Shane Dawson's "The One That Turned You Gay" out of my brain. I'm taking it to my grave and no I'm not ok

**sufjancaesar** (7): Wish this was more fun/playful tbh, it feels a bit out of place…it’s v PRISM

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): this is one of those songs that sounds better in the context of its original rate. Here it’s outshined by a lot of actually good music, which makes it harder to give a high score in good faith

#blonde pixie cut

**Awkward\_King** (6): i like how everything from teenage dream sounds like it could be coated in a layer of sugar

**bo\_g\_o** (6): personally I like to believe that the Radiohead song they were making out to was The National Anthem

**iniekcja\_** (6): i am confident i had never even heard this before

**waluigiest** (6): and it’s about to get away again

**NotWith10000Men** (5.7): i'm just not interested in katy

**anothertown** (5): https://i.imgur.com/9NYpybz.jpg

**flavasavavandal** (5): Bumped up by a couple of points because the ending of the mv is the closest this rate has to country

**ReallyCreative** (5): now why'd y'all pick this mediocre mess

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): weird that I remember this being one of my favorites from Katy but revisiting it I really don’t get why, I wish I had a time machine, noooo

**vayyiqra** (4): It is time to admit that at least half of Teenage Dream is filler and a lot of its lyrics are bad

**welcome2thejam** (2): Need me a girl who fucks to Paranoid Android

#i know this song and i'm better for it

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the way i didn't even need to pick this myself that's organic popularity luv

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s impossible for Kevin Parker to make a bad song

**bbfan132** (10): i remember loving currents when i first heard it as a teenager - haven’t listened to it in full in forever but still enjoy this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Australia can be okay sometimes.

**cremeebrulee** (10): one of the most magical openings to a song ever

**emayzee** (10): this song will be THE staple of every "2010s indie" playlist until the end of time and deservedly so

**frogaranaman** (10): https://twitter.com/notkatiadotcom/status/1369531794890977284

**homestarguy** (10): Kevin snapped on this one.

**IdiotBox01** (10): favorite tame song from the moment the album dropped

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favorites songs ever, I just associate with good vibes and pre pandemic life (cause that’s when I discovered it) anyway we need to rate currents

**iniekcja\_** (10): this one is for the straights with the booming system

**jman457** (10): The music video alone justifies this score. Currents is an all time fav for me (even though there are better songs on it).

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this will always be a 10 idc

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's a banger, but I'm still kinda mad this beat somebody that I used to know in the triple j hottest 100 of the decade

**Roxieloxie** (10): It pained me not to 11 this in charity rate and its gonna pain me not to do it again here as well. This song is heavily associated with the last party I went to before covid started where I heard it in this room filled with pink lights surrounded by all my friends, i love this song. https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPd67Nm26/

**runaway3212** (10): Tame Impala makes music for people who think they’re interesting

**seanderlust** (10): Heather would really like to be excluded from this narrative

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): literally one of the most iconic songs of the past decade

**terrencelovescum** (10): this ushered an era of the some of the most insufferable and obnoxious people you'll ever meet. but kevin made several points here.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): yeah it's a fucking amazing song but it'd be a 10 if it weren't for annoying people

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): Makes me levitate more than Dua’s levitating

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): Mr. Impala served but I kinda hope it doesn't win

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.4): Why can’t Passion Pit sound like this

**2dina3dworld** (9): this was my favourite song from the age of 14 to 16, and now I cringe when I listen to this. The circle of life goes on!

**camerinian** (9): it's on sight with anyone named Trevor

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): overplayed but understandably so

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the more I listen the better it gets

**skargardin** (9): it's the serve

**vayyiqra** (9): One of those acts that I've seen Popheads hate for no reason (jk it's because it's "music by men who Indieheads likes") but this is Good In Fact

**veryanniev** (9): fookin’ trevor

**welcome2thejam** (9): This is the no. 1 ~Vibes~ song, just tough to beat that groove

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): all this talk abt indie pop has really got me thinking abt when we were together. i know it didnt POP for you, but im INDIE mood for a relationship, do you think we can make it work?

**jasannn** (8.5): I love the intro but then I get a little bored by the time the song is over

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): college students trying to make themselves feel better after failing yet another exam

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): the production is so good

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.5): every since Kevin said he wants to be like Max Martin i've been dreaming of him producing for ariana

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): me whenever i see yet another euphoria thing trending all over the TL

**Stryxen** (8): yes i gave this an 11 once yes i’m giving other songs from charity rate higher scores

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I find it hard to take this song seriously because of all the mashups on YouTube but I think it’s actually like a good song? Not sure honestly

**BasedButta** (7.5): pleasant with interesting sounds

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's good, but idk it fades into the background a little for me compared to some of Tame Impala's other stuff

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i got into tame impala because of my ex who was a bi guy with a drug problem. now he is an alt right leaning conservative who found god! anyway this song is a tad overrated but it is good

**trixiematthell** (7.3): i already forgot what this song sounds like

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): I only know this song bc memes

**hikkaru** (7): pov you're getting gaslit by a bisexual indie skater boy addicted to nicotine

**jaztinax** (7): hot take but the track is better without the topline

**nt96** (7): The mashup with SexyBack surpassed this song in every way. I don't make the rules.

**UselessTacooo** (7): ooh this is catchy, but I wish there was just a bit more going on. It doesn’t progress a whole lot

**waluigiest** (7): my tiktok brain is mush

**akanewasright** (6.9): I feel like this is someone’s stripper song, and I support them

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Hm, vibes but not of the kind I prefer

#r/take_it_to_indieheads [2]

**musical\_pyn** (6): that guitar is great but…not much else going on?

**bo\_g\_o** (5.5): I don't get tame impala

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): possibly the most overrated song of the decade

**MrMoodle** (5.5): I DON’T GET IT, there are so many genuinely excellent tame impala songs and this one is soooooo booooring in comparison, i was listening as this placed no. 1 on the triple j hottest of the DECADE, like what the fuck???? HOW??? i’m not a kevin parker stan but this is literally the only tame impala song i’ve heard that i DON’T care for, like it’s pleasant i guess but that’s just it?

**anothertown** (5): this ones been deboppified

**qazz23** (5): some neat bass but don't really like Currents

**throwaway-7650** (4): it's giving bananis and avocadis

**NotWith10000Men** (3.8): i got scared at the beginning that i was gonna like a tame impala track. luckily the crisis was averted

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): Very boring modern psych

**flavasavavandal** (3): God Kevin Parker makes some of the most banal retrofetish music that isn’t by Black Keys but he produced Perfect Illusion so he can stay

**fadedblue09** (1): #IndieheadsOut

**bridgemoney** (0): More like the less I hear this song the better.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): fuck this song and the album it was on also sucks

**nicolas<3** (0): i- you have to be honest! am i ugly, yes or no? ... [fnaf 2 ambiance music starts playing on the background]

#run away with me curtis i love you

**flavasavavandal** (11): This song is perfect, the perfect opener to what has become one my favourite albums of the 70s and all time. It’s dramatic, it’s atmospheric, the sax, the strings, all creating and releasing tension with such precision that you’d think Curtis was a god. But this song never loses it’s human focus. That feeling of depression and self-hatred that leads you to push people away and wallow in the pain. I haven’t heard a song capture it like that before. And yes I know it will get robbed and I will be sad when it inevitably is and sure there are plenty more songs I could’ve submitted from 70s Soul that would do better, but goddamn it this just does something special to my heart and I hope it encourages some people who didn’t do 70s soul to go check out Super Fly (and the other albums) so you can see what you missed.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): such an icon

**bbfan132** (10): so so so good, better not be a day 1 boot

**jman457** (10): Curtis Mayfield really created magic on this soundtrack

**kappyko** (10): A song about me according to several people? I am 20 years old

**plastichaxan** (10): Curtis was a great discovery for me and god i can already tell y’all will rob him

**seanderlust** (10): everything about this just works so well.

**throwaway-7650** (10): didn't get to comment this in 70s soul so here: kappy makes an appearance in ~~his own rate idea~~ AS5

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.4): Epic in every sense of the word. Bond movies wish they could make a track like this

**akanewasright** (9): ~~This should have been a different song but it’s still good~~

**hikkaru** (9): a slut for sax always

**homestarguy** (9): Delightfully dark soul tune. Absolutely dig the growling saxophone, as well as how the time shifts from 2 to 4 in spots. The drug-related lyrics are fitting dark as well.

**qazz23** (9): solid opener, love the bass and horns

**runaway3212** (9): pretty like a flower in the wild

**Stryxen** (9): the DRAMA omfg

**TiltControls** (9): Pusherman would've been an easy 10, but this is good too

**vayyiqra** (9): god I love horns

**waluigiest** (9): he’s a master at balancing the explosive and the subdued

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Man this song is sad

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this production is so amazing and grand

**Roxieloxie** (8): /u/flavasavavandal you should've sent pusherman :emotiangry:

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.7): love the instrumentals and his voice wew

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**trixiematthell** (7.4): had some deep thoughts during this one and it was nice

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): when u/awkward_king is causing trouble

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): me when i was given one too many pixie sticks

**rslashpoopheads** (7): It's me. I'm the child.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.8): not really sure if this justifies being five and a half minutes long

**BasedButta** (6.5): Very cool ideas and instrumentals but it sadly falls apart a bit when the singing starts, feels kinda disjointed. Its a mix of boring and great.

**sufjancaesar** (6.5): Solid instrumentals but the melodies here are boring and repetitive imo

#you could have just let him be let him be

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): A few too many sax solos for me personally.

**Awkward\_King** (5): me hosting sub favs

**IIIHenryIII** (5): kind of bad kind of good

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): i played this two seconds ago and i already forgot what it sounds like

This should have won its original rate- but it's only right it is the song that closes out Indie Pop Rock. Another one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite albums of all time (I gave it a 9.9 average lmao) so to see it make it almost top half of the rate was worth it, I guess. AND FUCK TWO DOOR CINEMA CLUB!!

#dicking me down

**2dina3dworld** (10): so here’s a fun story. I’ve listened to this song a couple of times, and there’s one line that I can never hear right. That’s the “and they’re taking me down while the prisoners riot” line, which in true Dachi fashion, I can only comprehend as something nsfw.

**bigbigbee** (10): I CLUNG to this song in high school to prove that I had even a teeny bit of music cred, because the only other music I was listening to was anime openings and k-pop. and not even like good kpop. Anyway, I still love it dearly, it has a manic freedom to it. Also recommend watching their live performance, everyone is hot and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Mark Foster CAN enunciate, he just chooses not to I guess

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’ll just reiterate my comment from the Indie Pop Rock Rate - why wasn’t this the big hit instead of Pumped Up Kicks???

**camerinian** (10): It's been 10 years since this song came into my life and that whole time, SOMETIMES I WANNA DISAPPEAR has not lost an ounce of its oomph

**cremeebrulee** (10): sometimes i wanna slurp that dick til it come

**frogaranaman** (10): maybe Mark Foster was right. sometimes I DO want to disappear

**GapeCod** (10): Roxie rights (pls take that Chuu crown already is2g)

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is SO good and Foster the People were done so dirty in this rate. This isn’t even a song this is just eighty hooks stacked up in a trench coat trying to sneak into a movie theatre

**homestarguy** (10): Torches still holds up, and this one is probably my 1st or 2nd favorite on it. Those bendy synths in the chorus makes this one ascend. Fun fact: had the chance to play this one with FtP with my college marching band at in concert in 2012.

**hunnybee12** (10): either im really high or this is the best song ive ever heard

**IIIHenryIII** (10): sorry, masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sometimes my wig just disappears

**MrMoodle** (10): oh my GOD i’ve been looking for the song containing this synth hook for SO LONG it was driving me fucking nuts

**nicolas<3** (10): can someone edit this into a cupcakKe remix

**RandomHypnotica** (10): my biggest regret is not rigging the ballots so this would win

**Roxieloxie** (10): i dont listen to this song anymore for the very petty reason of I dont want the crown for it over one of my freinds who has exactly one more play of it than me sldhsdf but i still love it

**skargardin** (10): me at any given point of the week when I want to disappear tbh

**TiltControls** (10): SCREW MUSIC RATE MANIFESTATION I WANT A NEW SSX GAME

**akanewasright** (9.9): I hate this video, legitimately makes me feel sick inside, obviously it’s artistically good but it makes me like the song less. The song is really damn good though

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): poof pussy like alakazam

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**Stryxen** (9): SOMETIMES I WANNA DISAPPEAR woman red dress dance emoji

**wavingwolves** (9): see i can give positive scores to ipr music omfg...

**seanderlust** (8.9): Me enjoying this album when we rated it and then googling mark foster

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.7): oh yeah this is a BANGER

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This is honestly pretty good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the last chorus…chefs kiss

**vayyiqra** (8): I wish I liked this more and so did the rest of you

**waluigiest** (8): I miss this era of indie pop sometimes

**jaztinax** (7.5): you’re telling me that foster the people isn’t a one hit wonder? jk they still are

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): honestly FtP kinda served with every song except Pumped Up Kicks

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): oh wait this is actually good

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): Seeing this make it to #2 was the biggest surprise to me. It doesn’t strike me as rate-winning material to be honest :/

**jman457** (7.2): better songs on this album, im afraid

**trixiematthell** (7.1): cute little indie pop moment

#i wish this song would disappear

**bbfan132** (7): not my favorite but i support hypno!!

**bo\_g\_o** (7): a bit car commercial-core but it bops

**runaway3212** (7): day 1 be like ‘with the magic of misandry I made this song dissapear’

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): the outro of this grabbed me in

**NotWith10000Men** (5.9): for some reason the piano isn't jiving with me?

**Awkward\_King** (5): dicking me down is a prisoner's right

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): Still think this song is very annoying

**flavasavavandal** (4): not my sound

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): this chorus gets more annoying each time adfkjsdkf

**Lach#6922** (3): I quite like parts of the instrumental but it's ruined by the vocals

**fadedblue09** (1): They wanted to be a kpop boygroup in the MV so bad

**thedoctordances1940** (0): yeah no fuck this song it's so annoying

**TiltControls** (9.833): After 2 long years of rating and TDCC wins? pain (but fantastic rate hypno and creme! especially that bonus rate)

And back to back rate eliminations, we say goodbye to Jolin! East Asian Pop Royalty was also such a good rate, even if it was a sleeper hit. I'm happy a lot of people (as well as myself) got introduced to new music, and are going to yell about how this was robbed!

---

#went to art school

**2dina3dworld** (10): with a career as long and trail blazing as Jolin’s, you win the right to call yourself “the Great Artist”. The rest of you guys, stay humble

**akanewasright** (10): Jolin Tsai main pop girl idc

**apatel27** (10): 蔡依林加油！！！

**bo\_g\_o** (10): she served on this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is one of the best choruses in the rate

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): an unfortunate case of a song growing on me after the rate

**runaway3212** (10): blablabla lady gaga blablabla

**skargardin** (10): This video is a visual TREAT YASSSS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): A SONG THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE IN WINNERS, HOW DID THIS NOT WIN ITS ORIGINAL RATE

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): “Other than some wonky EDM production, it’s beginning to be difficult to deny that K-Pop just all sounds like one homogenous hyperactive blob of electropop”

**throwaway-7650** (10): I cannot believe I didn't give this a 10 in EAPR.

**TiltControls** (10): I wish all artists could create bops that went this hard

**UselessTacooo** (10): brain off, bop on

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this brings back so many good memories. I had a lot of fun learning a little bit of Chinese

**BasedButta** (9): this kinda slaps. love her style, and mandarin is so good to listen to

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): yeah this still slaps

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This wasn’t my favorite Jolin song in EAPR but I sent it because it was the highest ranking and I really hope that people like it because she’s an incredible artist (one might say… a great artist) who western pop fans should really pay more attention to. “The Great Artist” is very much a child of that early ’10s electro pop wave brought about by Lady Gaga but it’s aged very well thanks to the tasteful production and more “baroque pop” influences. [If you read the lyrics](https://genius.com/Jolin-tsai-the-great-artist-lyrics) the song actually has a very intelligent message about women not placing themselves second to men and Jolin just attacks it with her whole chest like the star that she is. Wake up!

**vayyiqra** (9): Bangs but it's more fun with the video

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.8): Oh this is a club banger!!

**camerinian** (8.5): ugh the stomp is addictive

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The title sounds like a movie with 7 Oscar nominations and 3 wins

**bbfan132** (8): bop!

**bigbigbee** (8): It's not good but it's good for me

**jaztinax** (8): bad bish bop

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): ok this slapped

**waluigiest** (8): telling people about Frida Kahlo

**NotWith10000Men** (7.9): i remember this one from the rate i missed bc i wiped my computer! the sh sh sh sound repeated in the lyrics is so satisfying

#raters in STEM

**homestarguy** (7.5): Dig the dark, heavy pop sound on this one with the abrasive synths. Didn't quite grab me though.

**jman457** (7.5): This is fun even if its not the best song here

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): It's me. I'm the great artist.

**moonagenightmares** (7.4): everyone stream jolins performance of play at mama 2016

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): a song that is HARD carried by it's music video (most of jolin's discog tbh)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): A nice but unspectacular bop.

**trixiematthell** (6.6): cover art reminds me of something but i don’t remember

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): way less artsy & way more boppy than the title had me expecting, and the video was a huge serve, though i didn’t really like the vocals

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): this production is a hinderance

**MrMoodle** (4): yep this is definitely from 2012

**Awkward\_King** (2): this is... not my favourite jolin song ive heard

yet another hit to greek mythos

---

#your own reflection

**skargardin** (11): For the life of me I still can't comprehend the lyrics being "being left" skull

**static\_int\_husp** (11): give me more disco about Greek Myths please

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Róisín and co. killed it with the production. Literally identical to the actual disco era

**akanewasright** (10): This is my most played song from any rate ever, and probably should be my 11. My heart is tugging me a different way at the moment (partially because I already 11d it), but it’s fucking perfect and brilliant

**bbfan132** (10): love this

**bo\_g\_o** (10): need to listen to this album

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented strings

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): 🌼

**GapeCod** (10): I'm not narcissistic enough to 11 a song from a rate I hosted, even if I have 200 plays of it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The myth of Echo and Narcissus has always been my favorite Greek myth, the Narcissus part of the story (a man so in love with his reflection that he stared at it until he died) has obviously become the larger cultural talking point but I feel like most people overlook the role of Echo, the nymph who loved him from afar until she too faded. What exactly are we supposed to take away from this other half of the story? Are we supposed to feel bad for Echo, pining away for a love she could never have until she died, or are we supposed to think she’s stupid for allowing the man she loved to rot away by a pond? None of this has anything to do with the song but it’s something I’ve been thinking about since I was a kid and I’ll probably never have another excuse to bring it up (although I’m copying and pasting my comment from the original rate so technically I got to bring it up TWICE!). The song is good.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I wasn’t a big fan of this album but this song is perfect and such a vibe

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this BANGER omfg never forget when i discovered roisin and got like 600 scrobbles of her in a month because niki played this song in plug dj after a rate reveal shoutout to niki

**mudkip1** (10): maybe the best disco song EVER?!?!?!?

**musical\_pyn** (10): to be honest I wasn't going to give this a 10 but then I listened to Roisin Machine in its entirety again and the song just hit perfectly

**qazz23** (10): Really great strings and bass!

**ReallyCreative** (10): MONUMENTAL slay

**Roxieloxie** (10): 5 points for niki 5 points cause this is actually a good song

**runaway3212** (10): I think falling in love with yourself is literally so tragic it’s like there’s such a deep resentment in the rest of the world that the only person who can love you is yourself. Anyway this song is the slapper

**throwaway-7650** (10): people always say "you can't use my culture as an aesthetic" but no one talks about it when it comes to ancient greece like.

**waluigiest** (10): lots to love here but the string bridge towards the end is FEROCIOUS

**bigbigbee** (9.5): “fucked up that narcissus was cursed to his death bc of some femcel, and now we're all like yeah haha that guy was sooo into himself” - /u/nyoom

**camerinian** (9.5): Stadium disco is a sorely slept on sub-sound of 90s dance and I’m glad someone who was actually there at the time is keeping the dream alive (this comment is sponsored by Y2K Raver Anthems Rate which Roisin is actually part of if you don't believe me, since the average age of this sub is like 4)

**jaztinax** (9.5): the disco bop this generation needs

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): roisin was so robbed in this rate it's incredible

**jsonphile** (9): between this and Hadestown maybe we just need more music about Greek tragedies

**UselessTacooo** (9): big bouncy bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**wavingwolves** (8.5): https://gfycat.com/unrulyconscioushorsemouse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Not a huge fan of the slower part in the middle but otherwise this is a bop.

**frogaranaman** (8): @ my ex

**RandomHypnotica** (8): lesbian lesbian lesbian lesbian lesbian lesbian lesbian love with me

**Stryxen** (8): unfortunately overrated from this album however its great still

**TiltControls** (8): Another song that's grown on me quite a bit

#echo

**jman457** (7.7): groovy as hell, but the intro is a little long

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): It moderately bops

**anothertown** (7): this is an inchresting one.. the instrumental is great and the strings are right, but i don't think it all comes together for me

**IIIHenryIII** (7): get over yourself

**vayyiqra** (7): I'd argue this was the most authentic disco song (and album) in the rate but I'm still not big on it and find it too repetitive. I wish we could rate Overpowered or Ruby Blue so I could make it up to her.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): bean love

**trixiematthell** (6.1): can’t relate

**hikkaru** (6): honestly never got this being THE standout from this album it's not bad but imo there's better

**homestarguy** (6): Some groovy strings save this one, but not super roused by this fairly straightforward disco tune.

**ricki** (6): i was too nice to her in the rate

**NotWith10000Men** (5.7): it's okay?

**BasedButta** (5.5): repetitive, not even jammable, the twist is not good

**nicolas<3** (5): very inoffensive and also very mid

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): ive not found myself coming back to this song much for how much i liked it at the time, i think it kinda grew off of me. the groove still goes hard, but its one of the few points on the album im actually not a fan of how repetitive it can get lyrically, and i think i also just find roisin's vocals on the mid track more grating than i want to

**fadedblue09** (4): lyrics are more fun than the song itself.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I don’t get what people see in this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): way too long and i hate the way she sings

**sweetnsaursauce11** (3): sorry but this was boring

**xearomis** (3): Heard way better disco songs, not a fan of the production

**2dina3dworld** (2): it sounds rough and shrill at the same time. Like the audio equivalent of being dragged on the ground

#G10

**moonagenightmares** (11): memories of burning this onto a cd when i was 10 years old and blasting it in the car while my mom was running errands <3

**throwaway-7650** (11): and FUCK faded! 11s for kesha - blow too!

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): How did this not win it’s original rate??

**akanewasright** (10): the number of times I’ve looped this while having anxious breakdowns… it’s not zero!

**anothertown** (10): "sober girls around me they be acting like they drunk" is honestly something to chew on

**Awkward\_King** (10): if a little victorian boy heard this song he would die and i would dance over his dead body

**bigbigbee** (10): I think it would bother Far East Movement that they can be abbreviated as FEM. I never said they were good men, just that I like their stuff

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Like a G10. Why did this lose to Flo Rida?

**bridgemoney** (10): More than anything this makes me nostalgic for early Todd In The Shadows videos where he tried way too hard to be funny.

**buddhacharm** (10): using this space to announce that I accidentally saw them live — incidentally for free — and that king should be jealous

**cremeebrulee** (10): me abusing the line "sober girls around me baby acting like theyre drunk" when this song came out like they were singing about me, a literal 13 y/o

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): it just is

**flavasavavandal** (10): this is like if The Black Eyed Peas made good music and Fergie was replaced by someone who doesn’t try to oversing every note but isn’t Kesha

**GapeCod** (10): I used to think /u/TiltControls was perfect.

**hikkaru** (10): deserved to win omfg i'll remember that TILT.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): greatest song of all time

**IIIHenryIII** (10): banger

**ImADudeDuh** (10): they paved the way for other asian chart topping boy bands (BTS)

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i don’t even LOVE this but i’m giving it a 10 just because i miss this style of obnoxious pop rap so bad

**plastichaxan** (10): the easiest 11 i ever gave in a rate it gives me that buzz

**RandomHypnotica** (10): fuck u/tiltcontrols (ok i still love you but this should've won)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Stream Dev & The Cataracs - Bass Down Low and Far East Movement - Forever Survivor ft. Macy Gray

**runaway3212** (10): more like a G10 (comedy is hard)

**skargardin** (10): Absolutely classic banger

**Stryxen** (10): not an ounce of irony or camp in this 10

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): i've been super nostalgic for 2010 lately and this ISN'T HELPING

**vayyiqra** (10): Kids these days don't know, so they will be forgiven for not getting it. Anyway, using this space to say that Dev is a very underrated electro artist who you should listen to more.

**wavingwolves** (10): the way i spent like 10 years hating this but then it clicked with me suddenly last year and now i love it???? idk what was wrong with me in 2009 i'm so sorry for the amount of slander i did against this song back then

**xearomis** (10): The perfect pop rap song thanks

**Roxieloxie** (9.4): this is the second best song from them

**MrMoodle** (9): if euphoria was released 10 years ago this would’ve played in a drug-fueled house party that gives me anxiety just watching

**ReallyCreative** (9): iconic for all the wrong reasons

**seanderlust** (9): petition for dylan brady to remix this I'm dead serious

**UselessTacooo** (9): haha giving G6 a 9 haha 6 9 haha get it I’m so funny haha

**waluigiest** (9): Has anyone ever done a YouTube video essay on this song?

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): this song is fun but only full 10 potential when you're actually poppin bottles

**frogaranaman** (8): this is a thot song

**nicolas<3** (8): unironically really good

**qazz23** (8): Like a G6(+2)

#G0

**jman457** (7.8): electropop BANGER (even if it seems a bit appropriative)

**trixiematthell** (7.8): a classic, up there with beethoven

**BasedButta** (7): jammable

**CarlieScion** (7): more like like a g7 amiright

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): fun

**iniekcja\_** (7): me every time I buy clothes

**just\_thonking** (7): How many people are gonna comment "more like a G7!" or whatever

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): a moment in pop culture and american history

**shhhneak** (6.4): My life’s a movie fr.

**bbfan132** (6): tbt when they covered this on glee and a bunch of people threw up (i think)

**camerinian** (6): Dev deserved better, Far East Movement deserved exactly as much as they got

**CaptainDaisyG** (6): Like a G6. That’s it. That’s my comment.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Memes and Asian pride aside this song doesn’t do much for me

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I'm feeling so fly like a G6 a 6 (very generous cuz nostalgia)

**NotWith10000Men** (5.2): i made a zillenials playlist a few months ago and i'm def gonna have to trawl some of the playlists from our rates to fill it out

**homestarguy** (5): Ugh. The vocals remind of everything I hated about 2009/2010 pop. But...that beat is unstoppable.

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): this is for the asians that say the N word with their whole chest

**jsonphile** (4): no really why did this do so well in the pop/rap rate? I have genuinely no idea why this is any better than any of the other million songs that sounded just like this at the start of the 2010s. Generic repetitive club beat, corny rapping, generic lyrics about being in the club, getting drunk, and “put your hands up”. What’s unique about this song? Dev’s voice I guess?

**Verboten\_Prince** (3.8): Wow it’s a good thing I didn’t do this rate

**welcome2thejam** (3): The intro of this is incredible, but it peaks immediately with "slizzard" and nose dives soon after

**fadedblue09** (1): u/TiltControls's 2 biggest legacies to this sub: (1) compiling the rate stats and (2) saving us from this disaster of a song. So glad to live in the timeline where this is a rate LOSER

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): not this fucking song again. you should be thankful im not giving this my 0

**bo\_g\_o** (0): this is all the worst aspects of early 2010s pop rolled into one song

#legendary behavior

**TiltControls** (0): wow thanks to the kind soul that almost prevented this tragedy from winning

**flavasavavandal** (10.000): Yes I am giving these 3 songs 10, no I will not apologise, of the vapid electropop 2009-2011 sound two of these were the most vapid, inane, commercial and dumb and I love every second of them and the other is by Lupe Fiasco!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.333): such a fun rate!!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.300): honestly one of my favourite rates of the year

**bigbigbee** (8.667): This rate fucking ruled, we need more rates of dumb fun music, I say, sounding like both a boomer and a dumbass at the same time

**runaway3212** (8.333): kirby isnt my friend anymore

**AHSWeeknd** (8.000): I can’t believe I missed this rate

**vayyiqra** (7.000): I didn't do this rate but maybe I should have if there were bad takes like 0ing "Like a G6" in it

**throwaway-7650** (7.000): it'z (kind of) camp of me to 11/0 the same rate tbh

**plastichaxan** (7.000): this rate was so much fun and i love how much it made me say “oh it’s that song”

**Awkward\_King** (6.667): fuck u/TiltControls

**TiltControls** (6.667): such a fun rate! pop/rap is one of my favourite things from the early 10s even if it was trash (affectionate) it was a joy to revisit. Jack and izeasklapaucius did this great genre so much justice in their hosting!

**fadedblue09** (5.000): The results for these is the reason why I was able to fully recover from the terrible BG rate results

**welcome2thejam** (3.333): Admittedly a lot of songs from this era has an uphill battle for me to like it, but looking at what was in this rate, there's definitely a couple I'd rate highly. Take Pitbull for example. Hotel Room Service, Don't Stop the Party, and Timber would've gotten solid marks if they were the picks, and I'd have straight-up 10'd Time of Our Lives amongst all this competition. So I'm not totally against this genre, just what's been sent to me here

The fact she just improvised this? legendaric

---

#WOAH, WOAH NOW HOLD UP LISTEN

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I would if I had his number

**akanewasright** (10): Do not fuck with Erykah Badu, she will roast you in song in front of an audience

**bbfan132** (10): if this is day 1….

**bo\_g\_o** (10): damn imagine being the person who inspired this song and having to live with the fact that Erykah put you on blast in front of an entire crowd, I'd simply die of embarrassment

**DefaultPophead** (10): The biggest surprise of the rate, but one that is most welcome!

**frogaranaman** (10): this is one of the ultimate "fuck you" songs ever

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Sisters how y’all feel? So this song is actually a live improv- the background music is a groove that Badu’s band would play in rehearsals and she and her background singers would just kinda spit nonsense over it, and this recording is her “officially” transforming it into a full on song during a concert. There is a studio recording that came later but the live version is iconic, it was a viral (radio) hit and remains one of Erykah’s most successful and recognizable hits. I actually have a special connection to this song because my name in real life is “Tai” and as a child when my father needed me he would sometimes scarlet out “you better call Tyrone” and I had absolutely no clue what that meant until I heard this song for the first time hosting the Neo-Soul Rate.

**iniekcja\_** (10): god i miss live shows

**Roxieloxie** (10): I fully believe that this is the first time she did this, she had shit to say she's iconic for this

**runaway3212** (10): nobody performs live like her tbh

**throwaway-7650** (10): the live performance of this is a must-watch

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.8): The Baduizt urge to yell “YES GET HIS ASS!” at every single line

**ReallyCreative** (9.7): music to scar the minds of the children of Dallas, Texas with

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i bet erykah badu's cock is MASSIVE

**nt96** (9.5): Nothing says classy like asking how the fellas are doing before murdering them.

**bigbigbee** (9): The live audience on this is proto-reaction video content. I won’t elaborate except to say that I love reaction videos

**camerinian** (9): God I love a live cut where the audience are just eating out the performer’s lap. Miss Badu is giving them everything and it’s infectious

**seanderlust** (9): but you can't use my phone is such a funny way to end this song

**skargardin** (9): this was excellent

**welcome2thejam** (9): Can't imagine a non-live version of this working anywhere near as well, it's elevated so much by all these women cheering on Erykah Badu landing uncontested uppercuts on this dude

**jman457** (8.5): Erykah just gives regal energy

**trixiematthell** (8.1): i feel like this was really fun live

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I don’t usually like listening to live versions of songs but it REALLY works here. Ate him alive.

**bridgemoney** (8): Why'd she have to single out Tyrone? Where are the songs about Jim, James, and Paul? I bet they're the ones actually preventing the relationship from working.

**homestarguy** (8): Just so much fun, and love the "but you can't use my phone" punchline.

**jaztinax** (8): i don’t know this song but the audience being hyped makes me hyped

**plastichaxan** (8): the live adds so much to this song i love it

**Stryxen** (8): Vocal slayage! WOW

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): a song that starts with that drag can't possibly be bad. also her voice sounds like honey

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): honestly. girlboss.

**UselessTacooo** (8): Ooh these vocals are amazing

**waluigiest** (8): seeing her live would cure my depression. This I know

#cheap bitches

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): I love the verses being punctuated by the audience cheering

**1998tweety** (7.5): alright

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): this is like the reverse song to no scrubs

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): Tyrone the ultimate third wheel

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this was a weird all stars pick

**mudkip1** (7): damn that crowd was GLUED to her presence

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): this song is actually lovely but I have live version and cheering phobia

**TiltControls** (7): not my favourite track on the album, but a great choice for all stars. Still, hope it does well!

**vayyiqra** (7): The best part about this is the drumming

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): queen

**wavingwolves** (6.4): this surely is an interesting choice for an all stars pick

**nicolas<3** (6): i know this is a live recording but the cheering is sending me for some reason

**tkajilili** (6): +1 point for the lyrics Now every time I ask you for a little cash / You say no but turn right around and ask me for some ass

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): appletree deserved

**IIIHenryIII** (3): not my cup of tea

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): NO VOY A PERDER NI UN MOMENTO EN VOLVER A PENSARTE SAOKONATORS RISE UP!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): ^malamente

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is the song that made me check out her music, and it still holds up well

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): ate

**plastichaxan** (10): i was gonna say rosalía never misses but remembered la fama exists

**qazz23** (10): Strong opener, like the multiple vocals in the chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (10): :flabster:

**skargardin** (10): this is how you open up an album

**terrencelovescum** (10): sorry andalucía but she invented flamenco here.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): she made some points here

**1998tweety** (9): smasha

**akanewasright** (9): not my favorite on EMQ but still a BANGER

**rslashpoopheads** (9): rosalia

**vayyiqra** (9): Still not as big on this album as some were but this is the best song on it.

**waluigiest** (9): the melodic lines on this song are absurd. Absurd!

**bbfan132** (8.5): certain songs from el mal querer were totally robbed in the original rate

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): omg billie eilish

**fadedblue09** (8): does a better job being a standalone than being in an album track

**homestarguy** (7.5): Pretty, seductive, love the handclaps.

**jman457** (7.5): I feel this works better in the context of the album

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.3): really enjoy how vibe-y this is

**trixiematthell** (7.3): i am a bad queer i’ve never listened to her before

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.2): I have beef with Rosalía, and it’s a stupid reason but let me tell you why: I listened to this song hoping that it would help me with my Spanish, but I realized… I couldn’t understand a single word of what she’s saying! Now my Spanish isn’t necessarily good, but I can at least get some words from songs, but with her, nada. So I looked up the lyrics and found out she drops all of her “S”s!! Ugh, I know that’s a real accent that certain people have, but it makes it so much harder for me to understand them. So that’s my story about why I have a grudge against Rosalía. The song is still pretty though.

**nicolas<3** (7): overrated

**runaway3212** (7): this is still decent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): A cool bop but I don’t know if I would revisit it.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): muy mal muy mal muy mal

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its fine

**BasedButta** (5.5): cool clapping i guess…

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): these are the ugliest sounding claps I've ever heard and they don't stop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): nothing happens in this. i listened to it twice and immediately forgot what it sounded like after it ended both times

**xearomis** (2): The weird atmospheric production and uninspired chorus is just a no from me sorry

And another rate leaves us, yet another discovery rate for a lot of people- and it was such a good one at that! Tori Amos is a legend.

---

#share if you love jesus

**2dina3dworld** (11): it’s always hard to articulate why I have given something an 11 - because often it’s a whole package deal, and you struggle to pick apart what stands out from a perfect song. Crucify is no exception. It’s a song that’s perfect in every detail - the instrumentation, the vocals, the lyrics etc etc, and to pick apart everything I like from Crucify would be a tremendous task. Tori Amos truly knocked it out of the park with Little Earthquakes as a whole, and if Winter had been in here it might have just edged out the top spot.

**bbfan132** (11): probably my least surprising 11 ever - my personal selection would’ve been winter/little earthquakes/mother but i still love this!!!!! honestly, i could name every song from the album as good selections so

**plastichaxan** (11): every line in this song hits, this is my favorite rate discovery of last year for sure, i thought it would be harder to pick an 11 but the more i listened to this the easier it got, just… perfection

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I would have given this a cute 9 when getting into Tori a teen, I connected with the deep cuts on Little Earthquakes more. As an adult, the lyrics hit me hard, causing me to take a hard look at my my tendency to people-please at the expense my own emotional health. Sonetimes we deal with being victimized by repeating the cycle of abuse towards ourselves, and engaging in self-martyrdom, and for what?? No one asked for it, it doesn’t help me move forward and it’s not healthy. When I’m on the edge of unraveling and revisit this song, Tori really helps get in touch with my feelings, as she delivers the biting lyrics of Crucify with genuine anguish and just enough sarcasm to be spicy. Screaming along to the chorus is truly therapeutic. WHY! DO! WE!!! I’m so happy I was invited to host a rate with this amazing album.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Tori Amos was and is the moment.

**akanewasright** (10): I think I would die for Tori Amos. Or kill for her. Or buy her a sandwich idk

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): NOTHING I DO IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUUUU!!!!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Tori is a treasure

**jman457** (10): This was never an 11 contender when I originally rated the album, but it is now. Thank you for having me discover this album, which is now one of my favorites

**nt96** (10): The outro of this song chef's kiss

**qazz23** (10): Solid opener, I like the chorus and the way she says "Chains"

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is probably the song here thats grown on me the most, Im absolutely obsessed with this now

**runaway3212** (10): jesus died just so we could have this song

**TiltControls** (10): We love this rate for Tori-pilling me (or at least Little Earthquakes-pilling, still need to listen to her other stuff)

**UselessTacooo** (10): I really think she nailed the religious themes here, while not overblowing them. It’s a piano bop and I love those.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): ok, I'll say it, her voice sounds like Shakira and Alanis Morissette had a baby together

**jsonphile** (9.5): I’ve never heard any Tori Amos before this rate but clearly that was a mistake

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.5): Something about this instrumentation sounds really magical

**Awkward\_King** (9): tori spit kink amos

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really like the lyrics to this one, though I do wish she repeated the chorus a little bit less because it doesn’t need to be this long

**mudkip1** (9): oh it’s hot and wet and slick, and it’s making everybody sick… oil spillllllllllll…

**skargardin** (9): stunner

**Stryxen** (9): little earthquakes more like big earthquakes im shaking

**vayyiqra** (9): the 90s will always be untouched for alt-pop

**1998tweety** (8.5): Jesus before jumping on that cross

**homestarguy** (8.5): Intense lyrics, and I can feel those thumping drums deep inside.

**nicolas<3** (8.5): didnt know who tori amos was before this but i quite enjoyed this

**seanderlust** (8.3): some of these lines are actually just now hitting. "You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird"?? mwah

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Tori Amos never misses

#just look for satan

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I keep going back to raise this score, the melody is haunting and interesting and unique

**trixiematthell** (7.4): I liked but would probably never go back to it

**frogaranaman** (7): Jesus, probably

**sufjancaesar** (7): Little Earthquakes still robbed

**veryanniev** (7): ugh I wish Precious Things was given a spotlight instead

**waluigiest** (7): I think when I opened my heart to Fiona Apple it permanently closed for Tori Amos….. sad to say.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): tori stans when they see anyone tanking her

**wavingwolves** (5.5): wow this tori kelly girl sure is good

**hikkaru** (5): beez in the trap cleared

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): she’s putting way more effort in this song than it really needs. girl its ok to just make a basic piano ballad you dont need to have the dramatic choir chorus and draw out the word chains like that

**moonagenightmares** (4): this song is so 90s /neg

**sweetnsaursauce11** (4): wish i could be into critically acclaimed muysi but unfortunately for u all my taste is trash

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Outsold by my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

**ricki** (0): beez in the trap outsold

Indiehads rate was SUCH a good one, and it being the third rate left standing is proof of that- look at the material, you can be the judge of it!

#what's your starting wordle word

**just\_thonking** (11): This song is perfect on its own, but it hits different when there IS no turning back after what's been said. I don't think I can express how much comfort and guidance this song provided for me after a Really Bad situation last year, so instead I will try to repay the favor by giving it my 11.

**NFLfreak98** (11): Girl I’m not buying into astrology either, I think it’s time to switch to ‘whats your starting word in wordle’

**steelstepladder** (11): One day when enough time has passed, all that will remain on the indieheads rate will be the amazing songs we rated and introduced popheads to, we will have the courage to do another one, and everyone will rejoice

**Stryxen** (11): soon after the indieheads rate reveal this song entered my regular rotation and it just. hasn’t left. it’s become one of my favourite songs of all time, so i’m glad i get to correct my horror of giving this a 9.5 and give it this instead

**2dina3dworld** (10): I personally think this song is about closure. It’s about the disconnect between you and another person that you may be a bit too dependent on, and recognising that you might as well just lean on yourself.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Amazing song and not even top 3 on Antisocialites.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): astrology is fake

**bridgemoney** (10): Please come back.

**frogaranaman** (10): first time I heard this I didn't know what the fuck was being said but I was living for it

**GapeCod** (10): I deeply regret the 8 I gave this song before, it's just as perfect as everything else on Antisocialites.

**majid** (10): one of my favourite songs of all time slay

**nicolas<3** (10): we all yassed and banged our heads against the wall

**qazz23** (10): I'll alvvays love this jangly dreamy sound (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): WE WANT 2010's ACCLAIMED INDIE

**Roxieloxie** (10): i have been alvays pilled on this album

**shhhneak** (10): They were so robbed in the original rate.

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): eleven contender ughh

**throwaway-7650** (10): one of my favorite discovers in ~~undertow~~ AS!

**TiltControls** (10): We love Atlantic Canada representation! Canada's Drag Race dni

**welcome2thejam** (10): The dreamiest of dream pop

**emayzee** (9.5): alvvays please come back we need you

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): woah luv

**akanewasright** (9): “there’s no turning back” me about any decision ever, I have anxiety, I get nothing done

**bbfan132** (9): like how randomly noisy this is

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): oh this is a great reminder that i need to check more of their stuff out

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): great song

**tkajilili** (9): the most 10 of the 9s

**vayyiqra** (9): Alvvays please come back soon we need your light breathy dream-pop melodies to be the soundtrack to summertime in Toronto. Take your time though, whenever you're ready.

**1998tweety** (8.5): boppy

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): the fact that indieheads sent popheads this and not something from their debut will never not disappoint me

**homestarguy** (8.5): A bit shoegazey for my liking, but it's such a pretty song. Not my favorite on the album though.

**BasedButta** (8): this song doesn’t fuck around, its good from the start and never lets up. i think these indieheads are onto something

**IdiotBox01** (8): one of my favorite bands but this song never really did it for me

**jasannn** (8): sadly, this grew off me since the rate.

**jman457** (8): I can feel the sticky floor of a dingy basement show in college

#no turning back

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): this band is The VVitch of the music scene, isn't it? I can already see pretentious fans calling out people on the internet for misspelling their name

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's cute in a rate full of gorgeous

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Cocteau Twins could do In Underteau but could Alvvays do Heaven or Las Vegas?

**wavingwolves** (7.4): cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.1): this was made for a very specific kind of LGBT that I am not

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): good but there were better songs here tbh

**waluigiest** (7): this is the kind of music I listened to in my 2017 sadboy phase

**trixiematthell** (6.5): cute but repetitive

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): this is a song for car montage in a rainy day

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): not bad but kinda in one ear out the other

**letsallpoo** (6): it's no dreams tonite now is it

**runaway3212** (6): This grew off me tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Greta Gerwig liked that

**Awkward\_King** (5): this was the first alvvays song i ever heard and loved, but its kinda grown off me in time. like it is still nice but i dont really have any strong connection to it and i kinda feel like it is not their best iteration of this format

**camerinian** (5): man I really tried with this song after all the acclaim and its performance in the original rate, but this song is just super forgettable to me, I'm sorry. Every single time I try to understand its appeal, I enjoy the vibe of it I guess but it leaves no impact on me at all

**sweetnsaursauce11** (5): i like the breezy feel but not my style

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): I find this type of dream pop very bland, the singing just does nothing for me

**musical\_pyn** (4): Normally I love this kind of shoegazy pop but something about this just makes it…boring

**NotWith10000Men** (3): meh standard alt girl voice and production

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/comments/kbtis2/pitchfork_when_they_see_a_white_woman_playing_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Popheads turning on Phoebe has been interesting to watch- because you'd think it's overexposure, but she's been laying pretty low, so I'm not sure why. Either way, this bops nonetheless!

---

#posted a picture with their boyfriends

**trixiematthell** (11): i mean i stan

**welcome2thejam** (11): A soaring sound and biting lyrics that have long been stuck in my head should be more than enough, but the second she hits me with the perfect Sufjan horns it's done it's finished. I don't entirely mess with Phoebe's catalogue but I'm all in on this even if this becomes rate villain

**bbfan132** (10): phoebe has grown off of me but i still love this

**bigbigbee** (10): love the Hoenn Horns in this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): “25 felt like flying’” :) :) :) :) :)

**bo\_g\_o** (10): tbh this song is like in the bottom half of my punisher rating but it's punisher so the songs are all still 10s

**bridgemoney** (10): Indie Rock + Horns = GOATed combo.

**camerinian** (10): whoo.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the brass is SO cathartic and euphoric

**IdiotBox01** (10): already a classic

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The little woo after the first chorus is so cute

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): who said rate winner

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is fantastic and I will not be gaslit into thinking otherwise!!!

**runaway3212** (10): yes I love this and yes I love tokyo love hotel what about it

**skargardin** (10): I finally get the appeal

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I am so mad we voted this in that I'm gonna give it a great score anyways

**thedoctordances1940** (10): omg it's just incredible innit

**throwaway-7650** (10): ~~flava thinks I'm a weeb for liking this song~~

**waluigiest** (10): a year ago I was like “oh what a fun phoebe bridgers song” but now I feel pain in better understanding this messy paternal relationship

**wavingwolves** (10): daddy issues anthem for bisexual people who have mild anger issues and shoulder length hair

**shhhneak** (9.9): Snail Mail you’ve been served.

**Stryxen** (9): one of my most played songs on last fm ever i have like 200 scrobbles but it just doesnt have the oomph to make it a 10

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): aged kinda poorly tbh, it’s trying to be too whimsical

**Awkward\_King** (8): giving this an 8 dni it is too good to tank when you have daddy issues

**frogaranaman** (8): we were staying in Kyoto / to get away from your parents

**homestarguy** (8): A nice 2000s-esque indie rocker. The soaring, aching chorus vocals and the triumphant brass work so well together.

**jman457** (8): Makes me want to fly to Japan right now

**qazz23** (8): Wish there were more like this on the album

**UselessTacooo** (8): a great song, but undoubtedly a bit overrated. I won’t be mad when this makes the top 5, but I lowkey hope it doesn’t.

#i don't forgive you

**apatel27** (7.5): Kinda over this song now

**BasedButta** (7.5): she got some cool sounds. respect. but you CAN go harder did you know that?

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): i like this one a lot better the second time around

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Chemtrails omg

**akanewasright** (7): this is a good song, it’s just tied to an embarrassing memory now for me (and also I overplayed it initially)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): ¿Asian representation I guess?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like this and it’s one of the songs I’ve saved off the album (the other being I Know The End) but it’s still kind of boring and Phoebe’s voice doesn’t do it for me

**rslashpoopheads** (7): why is everyone so obsessed with this song

**TiltControls** (7): Kyoto? I thought you said Katoto

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I’m sorry but uptempo Phoebe has always been so much less my thing than the rest of her catalogue. Great album but idk why this one is the fave

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.6): “Guess I liiiiiiied I’m a liiiiiiiiar who liiiiiiiies cause I’m a liiiiiiiar” Truly the lyricist of a generation

**1998tweety** (6): appropriation

**anothertown** (5): to me there is this ephemeral quality to her music- like, I will not be hearing this again in 4 years

**nicolas<3** (5): maybe this is like the best song in punisher which isnt really saying much tbh

**plastichaxan** (5): wow this really grew off of me but also context i guess

**ReallyCreative** (5): a K-Mart brand Sufjan Stevens song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): if it’s not i know the end then i do not want to hear phoebe bridgers ever

**vayyiqra** (5): Perhaps the 2020 album I wished the most that I liked but I just don't. Oh well. Not sure what to give it so it's getting a 5.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (4): I like the horns, and the emotional peaks and lyrically it’s interesting but I’m bored

**sweetnsaursauce11** (4): just not 4 me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): I like I Know the End but Kyoto to me is just a pleasant, OK song

**fadedblue09** (3): I feel betrayed after learning there weren't any payphones in Kyoto

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): okay

**GapeCod** (2): The song that single-handedly killed the new all stars format for me... Kyoto has always been one of my least favorite songs on Punisher, and I've gone back and forth on the album as a whole a lot and atm I'm back to not liking it. Chinese Satellite or Graceland Too would have got 10s, but this really should have been I Want You To Love Me instead.

**flavasavavandal** (1): look that lyric on the chorus (“I'm gonna kill you / If you don't beat me to it”) is written like it’s supposed to be some banger tweet that would normally get laughed at and ratioed so harshly it would get deleted on the same day, but even I could give that pass if most of the instruments didn’t sound drowned out (with the exception of the horns and impactful or alternatively mk only likes this song cause anime

#shameika

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Shameika deserved to win the original rate

**akanewasright** (10): This song feels like… cartoony? Like I can see everything in my head *vividly*

**anothertown** (10): ruminating for decades about how another girl perceived you during an important time in your life is really gay Fiona

**bbfan132** (10): <3 will always remember my first listen of ftbc

**bo\_g\_o** (10): I need to learn this piano riff

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): need a shameika in my life rn

**DefaultPophead** (10): It's not even the best song on the album, but it's still easily a 10.

**GapeCod** (10): Thank you belb for picking this over IWTYL, even though both should be here 💔

**jman457** (10): Shamika really snaped in the third grade

**plastichaxan** (10): this is so fun to sing along to i love you fiona

**qazz23** (10): The story behind this is heartwarming (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we all need a shameika in our lives

**ReallyCreative** (10): Shameika says she has (no) potential to win this rate!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont know how to describe how this song makes me feel but its very animated in a way that dosent give you a way to breath but its so captivating that I dont exactly want to. The moment I heard this in the reveal ( and learned the story behind it) Ive been obsessed

**skargardin** (10): the piano

**throwaway-7650** (10): actually his name was [William Rankine (Scottish engineer/physicist, c. 1800s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rankine)

**UselessTacooo** (10): I truly believe FTBC is the best album of all time, and this only further cements it

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The lyrics in this are soooooo good. They truly paint a world that I can so clearly see in my head

**waluigiest** (10): it’s just one of the best songs of the last few years. It’s a masterwork in songwriting

**wavingwolves** (10): amazing

**thedoctordances1940** (9.9): innit thooooo

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): it's kind of a shame this was up against IKTE because this has major winner energy

**camerinian** (9.5): This album was so ridiculously good, and this feels like maybe the best synthesis of that ramshackle, free-wheeling chaotic sound galvanised into a pop gem. The way the title line cuts out all the clutter for a moment of clarity is one of the best parts of this entire rate

**homestarguy** (9.5): Playful vocal delivery, and even more playful sense of musical time and feel with the starts and stops. Deserved to be big single from FTBC.

**jsonphile** (9.5): Shameika was right

**bigbigbee** (9): really wish I hadn’t been playing Breath of the Wild around the time I did this rate; I now associate this song and album with whooping Ganon’s ass and I feels like it’s better than that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): “She got through to me and I’ll never see her again.” God damn that line.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): my shameika we luv yew

**Stryxen** (9): fiona is like my 2nd favourite artist of all time - this isn’t anywhere near my favourite but it’s sooooo good

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): love to sing along to this one

**NotWith10000Men** (8.4): i'm so glad they reconnected

**seanderlust** (8.2): I want to reiterate how damn precious it is that they actually reconnected. shameika I don't know you but you have taste.

**frogaranaman** (8): hot take - this album's art is mid at best

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Love the weird fantasy of this song because I also have held on to a lot of small, random encounters with people that kinda shaped my life, but I cannot IMAGINE doing what this woman did omg… if someone who spoke to me once in third grade wrote a song about me I would move to a bomb shelter

**IdiotBox01** (8): regina spektor but psychotic

**rslashpoopheads** (8): honestly I want to give this a 10 just for the album art

**runaway3212** (8): shameika saw wrong but this song is good anyway

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is a mess but like…a very cathartic mess

**TiltControls** (8): This song becomes 100x better knowing the story behind it so it'll be interesting to see how it does

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the indieheads love a good rollicking piano sometimes

**vayyiqra** (8): Quirky piano indie-pop (complimentary)

#shaqueefa

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.8): I like the idea of Fiona more than I like her music Ngl but also I do love this story

**fadedblue09** (7.5): most overrated Fiona song since Fast as You Can

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.2): Overstays its welcome at the end but yeah this is cool

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright

**flavasavavandal** (7): this is like good but I’m still annoyed about the rate results because FTBC absolutely outdid Punisher on every single front

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is one of better Fiona songs but like it’s just still not my thing

**trixiematthell** (6.3): i still don’t understand this album

**BasedButta** (6): cool lyrics, vocal performance and style choices, not much of a song

**jaztinax** (5.5): i will never understand fiona apple i’m sorry!! but the chorus is catchy

**Awkward\_King** (5): i think this might be the fault of me overplaying it but this has not been my fave on FTBC pretty much since the first week, i think the lyrical progression is brilliant and i love the way the story is told but i find the song kinda droning and all the things i like about it i can find in any other ftbc song that isn't this.

**sufjancaesar** (5): Absolutely love this track but I’m just bored of the ‘magical negro’ trope

**shhhneak** (3.5): The slowest ‘it’s a grower’ of all time.

**sweetnsaursauce11** (3): wish i could get into fiona apple bc everyone seems to love her on popheads but its really just not for me

**nicolas<3** (1): potential to make a bad song? yass

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): This is awful

**xearomis** (1): Well I hope whatever potential Shameika saw isn’t fully displayed in this song. It’s just really boring to listen to, especially the chorus

**mudkip1** (0): I still think this is the worst song on FTBC, I explained myself enough in the original rate

**wavingwolves** (10.000): i hosted this

**runaway3212** (9.333): p4k set up haim for this rate specifically let’s talk about it

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): well I got what I wished for... 10s streak broken

**RandomHypnotica** (8.633): HAIM was still so robbed it's sad

**ReallyCreative** (8.333): Pharts will be dealt with!

**TiltControls** (8.333): One of the highest rated rates for good reason. 3 absolutely stellar albums that made almost every elimination painful. Belb and SideB did amazing here keeping everything in order and having some great shitposts during the reveal too!

**AHSWeeknd** (8.000): This rate made me feel like I could relate to Drake’s lesbian lyric

**plastichaxan** (8.000): i’ll never understand why the albums got the ranking they got but this rate had some of the best songs wtf

**GapeCod** (7.333): Turn of 2021 #last-fm core.. What a wonderful time that was though.

**vayyiqra** (6.667): The rate of three albums I feel I didn't quite get, wondering what's wrong with me, then deciding they're just not quite my thing. I do like some of the stuff in this rate though.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.167): the first whiplash rate

**Awkward\_King** (5.833): i rly loved how belb and sideb did the banners for this rate, opting to use more serious comments people left that highlight the emotional strenghts of the music more. could never be me but that was awesome.

I'm just happy Lido did well- she deserved, it was one of the best albums I heard last year.

#amor

**nt96** (11): This song is the audio equivalent of a bunch of fireworks lighting up the sky in a dazzling array of colors.

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): i couldn't stop listening to Miss Colombia after this rate ended

**akanewasright** (10): I literally ascend when that chorus hits, there’s nothing like it

**bo\_g\_o** (10): this feels cathartic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): such a satisfying buildup into the chorus aaaaah si ustedes pendej@s roban esta cancion voy a llorar

**frogaranaman** (10): excellence

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): pain…

**iniekcja\_** (10): maybe this should've been my 11...........

**plastichaxan** (10): i’m so scared for my girlie i hope you survive day 1 please

**qazz23** (10): Love the vocals on the chorus, and the horns and synths too!

**ReallyCreative** (10): wait this is incredible

**Roxieloxie** (10): the chorus of this song is delicious

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): incredible luv

**homestarguy** (9.5): The song didn't wow me until it got to the chorus...then it hit. Absolutely entrancing, and the instrumentation is so dang cool with some saxes, clarinets, synth bass...doesn't sound like anything else.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.5): This is water level music… but like, the beautiful, ethereal, not-annoying kind of water levels

**wavingwolves** (9.5): anyone that gives this under a 9 hates latino people i think

**bbfan132** (9): gorgeous, love the production!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): on my list of fave rate discoveries, this whole album was a delight

**rslashpoopheads** (9): she spilled

**bigbigbee** (8.5): the opening minute is some of the most gorgeous music I've heard in a few years: her clear, bell-like voice soars

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): it's a shame the chorus doesn't hold up to the verses, which are mesmerizing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): a hauntingly beautiful song, her voice is so pleasant and conveys so much emotion

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): reminds me of the Paprika soundtrack a bit but please stop clapping

**trixiematthell** (8.2): really pretty voice

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): it’s nice but like… the horns in the back of the chorus sound crunchy.

**BasedButta** (8): this is how you artpop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Based on the translations I found online, I think this is a song about somebody who ain’t shit? If that’s correct - get their ass!

**TiltControls** (8): I was hoping for Te Queria but this is nice too. So glad Lido could pull off the win despite not having the name recognition

**tkajilili** (8): beautiful vocals

**Uberpigeon** (8): i gave this a 6 and immediately the trumpets came in and i bumped it. lido saw me typing.

#gay

**1998tweety** (11): if yall do this shit dirty again i will never forgive this sub. shouldve won ha first rate....

**Awkward\_King** (11): i got really hooked on this song when i was getting over a guy, the way he talks about lingering feelings for someone or just wanting a crush to go away because of how much it is tearing you apart internally is.. far too familiar, and absolutely gorgeously gut-wrenching to me. the way he sings "the rise and fall of his chest on mine" at the beginning of the second verse in particular just reminds me of a really specific memory and i dont know, it's amazing how he makes me want to cry at the recollection of all of this but it also feels like a comforting embrace. i dont think this is objectively the best song in the rate, even if it is really fucking good, but i'd regret it if i gave my 11 to any other song that doesnt mean as much to me as this one does.

**slimboyfriend** (11): Queer yearning and a Kate Bush reference; what’s more Popheads than that?

**veryanniev** (11): of course I’m giving this my 11, I’m still fucking fuming this didn’t win the indieheads rate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): deserved to win the original rate

**akanewasright** (10): Let me not overshare and just say “yass gay longing”

**bbfan132** (10): love love love the production

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is an achievement of songwriting.

**buddhacharm** (10): me indicating the location where I set the bar:

**camerinian** (10): Literally can't help but think if I wasn't so lazy with getting into Perfume Genius, I could have tilted this rate to give him the win cos it was that close. This song is drop dead gorgeous and I feel like a fool for taking so long to realise his brilliance

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gay longing personified yup yup

**DefaultPophead** (10): I will die on this hill.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): I really enjoyed this thank you for introducing it to me

**flavasavavandal** (10): the first half is euphoria, the second half somehow manages to transcend that euphoria. We stan Perfume Genius in this house

**homestarguy** (10): Wow, not enough retro shuffles like this these days. One of the best crush anthems ever made.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): AHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITS THE SMASHA

**iniekcja\_** (10): a violent current of ecstasy is one of my favorite lyrics ever and that's not even what he's singing here

**just\_thonking** (10): Yearners to the front

**mudkip1** (10): this should’ve fucking won I’m still mad about it

**nicolas<3** (10): this song makes me so happy

**plastichaxan** (10): gay

**ReallyCreative** (10): the Initial Talk remix of this is necessary listening for ANYONE looking to land on Millie Bobby Brown's hitlist

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is honestly an 11 contender for me. I probably would've remembered to 11 it in its initial rate if it hadnt been like 5 minutes

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I feel like I owe this song after casting a decisive 11 for Time to Pretend in the exchange rate only to become completely obsessed with this song the day after

**skargardin** (10): one of my favorites from set my heart on fire immediately for sure

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Eu amo este twink de 40 anos

**sufjancaesar** (10): JLo who?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): now why did y’all on discord try to convince me this song is bad it’s actually really good

**TiltControls** (10): While I still think MGMT was the right winner, I would've been happy to see this pull it off too. It's just got such a fun energy to it (and gay, which is just another point in its favour)

**tkajilili** (10): perfect, sad pop song

**emayzee** (9.7): file this one under: great songs i've always heard positive things about but never got around to listening to until i was forced to learn it via a rate

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): idk this song is just wonderful we love a queer bop

**jasannn** (9.5): I love the instrumental but the repetitiveness prevents me from coming back to this often.

**runaway3212** (9): so true stream rose’s on the groumd

**Stryxen** (9): this song is either a 9 or an 11 and i can’t explain that… anyway perfume geniussy

**throwaway-7650** (9): it's not a 10 but it's still an excellent vote-in

**vayyiqra** (9): In which Popheads gets a strange hatred for yet another white indie man who music critics happen to like. This is a bop, I don't get it.

**waluigiest** (9): this was one of my top songs of 2021 simply because Spotify autoplays it whenever I finish an album

**trixiematthell** (8.7): love her

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): not the most amazing song ever but just a bop

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Mr. Worldwide and Ashanti did it better

**shhhneak** (8.3): God I wish that were me.

#gay

**anothertown** (7.5): this was just ok until that beautiful outro my god.. i wouldve liked 300 more seconds of that

**BasedButta** (7.5): vibe

**seanderlust** (7.5): (puts in a playlist called "songs to encounter jensen ackles outside of a zale's jewelry in 2014 to)

**jman457** (7): Remember when this was less than half a point from a win. A moment most pleasing to me in my career. Also this doesn’2t hit

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): I don't hate this as much as some people do, but it doesn't really do much for me either, it's pleasant

**TragicKingdom1** (6): the fact that we rated this twice before the JLo song once is absolutely criminal and further indication that the indie community on this subreddit needs to be put in their place

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): cute but sunglasses, bmbmbm, or i’ve seen footage deserved

**bo\_g\_o** (5): there were like 20 or so tracks that were better than this in the indieheads exchange rate and which were better picks for this rate but y'all just have to go apeshit over literally any song with an 80s throwback sound

**nt96** (5): I liked his weird Supernatural fanfic better

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): It’s fine I guess

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): not digging his voice at all

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Some people just can’t pull off funk

**sweetnsaursauce11** (4): just listened to this and can't remember anything about it

**wavingwolves** (4): only slightly better than on the ground by blackpink member rosé

**xearomis** (4): Fine I guess but feels kinda generic

**NotWith10000Men** (3.3): alt boy with slightly more interesting production than alvvays. not for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): shawty is not getting low low low low low low low low to this, regardless of apple bottom jeans or boots with the fur (with the fur)

**MrMoodle** (3): indie coming of age movie trailer 🤮

**fadedblue09** (1): JLo did it better. (I wish I was being ironic tbh)

**2dina3dworld** (0): it’s hard to articulate why I don’t like this song but I think it’s mostly because it sounds like a Six60 song with synths

**GapeCod** (0): I like this song even less (or rather hate it even more) now than I did during the original rate. Not a single thing about it appeals to me, the melody in particular revolts me, and some of my friends being shocked at this exacerbated my dislike for this song even further. We could have got Cocteau Twins or Angel instead... 😭 At least his twitter is a goldmine.

**akanewasright** (10): I could go on and on about how much I love this song, how brilliantly good this is lyrically, and how this is a great song to introduce people to this album, but I just feel like slut dropping instead

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is just smooth as fuck. i had an irrational dislike of this song for some reason for a while and then one day it just clicked and ... its so good, god i wanna rerate isolation already

**bbfan132** (10): <3 <3 love this

**bo\_g\_o** (10): big boppy bop bop bop

**buddhacharm** (10): capitalism but like...reverse-Warholian

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): I feel like this going to get underrated bc there’s a man in it

**iniekcja\_** (10): obligatory 'every time I think of Kali uchis I remember the time her pants ripped on stage when I saw her live' comment

**jman457** (10): God I love Isolation so much, a top 10 album ever made.

**moonagenightmares** (10): waiting for steve lacy to go back to making bangers again

**plastichaxan** (10): i don’t think it’s a secret kali uchis is one of my favorite artists ever god this song is just so chef’s kiss

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song is so addictive

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): a straight bop

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): catchy as hell

**camerinian** (9.5): this song is so fucking vindictive and I literally barely noticed because it’s wrapped up in such a bop

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): just a banger

**jasannn** (9.5): I can’t listen to the intro without thinking about Money by Lisa

**terrencelovescum** (9.5): findom queen!

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): kali's music is such good background music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Invented women in the workforce.

**frogaranaman** (9): me trying to scam men every year after the Coachella lineup drops

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this is kinda relatable because I want $100 bills but also not that relatable because I also want love

**homestarguy** (9): BASS!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): steve lacy always eats on his feats but his own music is always :crickets:

**MrMoodle** (9): usually i forget everything about a song if i only listen once but goddamn this hook has embedded itself within the deepest crevice of my brain

**nicolas<3** (9): she wants my WHAT?

**nt96** (9): Jokes on you Kali, I'm broke

**qazz23** (9): hook is very good 🤑

**ReallyCreative** (9): not my favorite from the album but a worthy addition to All Stars

**waluigiest** (9): I forget how much I love this album. I feel this groove in my bones.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Adding her to my backlog, what little I've heard is consistently great

**NotWith10000Men** (8.7): i do want hundred dollar bills

**emayzee** (8.6): ok the only other time i've heard this song was in a fancam for andrew garfield in the social network so i was probably already primed to like it but this is very good

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): boppy i should have done this rate

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): alexa play million dollar bills by lorde

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.5): This hook is so catchy it’s ridiculous

**anothertown** (8): i love synths that are distorted in this particular way, it's feeling very analog, a little bit of oxenfree soundtrack

**flavasavavandal** (8): the only thing Kali wants, Steve, is revenge against Kelela for winning Contemporary R&B Queens

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i’ll be honest idk what I heard originally when i gave this a 9.5

**jaztinax** (8): a total earworm if i ever heard one

**skargardin** (8): dollar BIIIILLS

**UselessTacooo** (8): wait this is so pretty. I love it but I’m not sure it’s 10 worthy

**vayyiqra** (8): Not the Kali song I'd have picked but it's good

#change for a cup

**wavingwolves** (7.8): this shrunk on me quite a bit because i find it a bit too repetitive (especially because i overplayed for myself) but it's still a yass

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): okay this is one that i never listen to on its own because it works so well on Isolation but on its own it's just... kinda there? it's lovely but not a standout

**TiltControls** (7.5): this has nothing to do with this song but I'm using this space to reminded everyone that In My Dreams was robbed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.4): this sounds like an r/relationshipadvice post put to music

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**Stryxen** (7): we’ve all seen the pictures she looks absolutely beautiful… and he’s there

**trixiematthell** (7): a nice vibe

**runaway3212** (6.5): day 2 filler sorry

**rslashpoopheads** (6): same tbh

**BasedButta** (4.5): There’s something good in here, but it’s kinda buried by the vocals and some weird choices

**shhhneak** (3.6): All these bills and still can’t afford more lyrics.

**xearomis** (2): That “WooOOoOO” in the background really grates my ears. Guess I need those 100 dollar bills as compensation

**AHSWeeknd** (10): queen of the tion’s

**akanewasright** (10): I’d trust Jill Scott with my life

**bbfan132** (10): :listening:

**bo\_g\_o** (10): damn this is smooth as fuck

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A robbed song that should get its due!!!

**GapeCod** (10): Roxie and or Creme and I when they come to Moscow.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Jill put up a surprising fight in the Neo-Soul Rate despite being unknown to most of popheads (even myself at the time that I hosted the rate, oops) and so I hope this makes it pretty far in All Stars. What I love about this song (and Jill’s music in general) is that it’s so erudite and intelligent, but also sooo horny. It’s a chill song but she somehow manages to make walking around the park talking about religion sound like the sexiest thing in the world.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I forgot how excellent this is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this was even better than I remember it

**jman457** (10): Ok Jill I see you, serving with these vocals

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she devoured.

**nt96** (10): This song truly embodies that feeling of walking down the street or park during sunset.

**qazz23** (10): really smooth, great vocals and lyrics (11 candidate)

**ReallyCreative** (10): something something HAIM joke

**Roxieloxie** (10): I just think that Jills Scott's music deserves the world

**waluigiest** (10): Justice for Jill Scott in every way

**runaway3212** (8): lawa met de fam gezellig

**slimboyfriend** (8): StimuLATION?

**welcome2thejam** (8): One or two dates where it's just a long romantic walk, great. If Jill's still pulling that shit by date five you gotta know something's up right

#jopping

**trixiematthell** (7.6): sounds lovely

**BasedButta** (7.5): pleasant, I like this singer’s style, bonus points for that. Absolutely great second half, but not so great of a first.

**homestarguy** (7): Dig the lyrics, an unfussy head-bopper instrumentally.

**nicolas<3** (7): vocal slayage!

**TiltControls** (7): Exclusively should've won this rate for content and Jilltro should've won just for the name alone

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): mission accomplished, this sounds like a long tiring walk

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is very pleasant but I probably wouldn’t go back to it.
