All Stars 5 Rate

[Hello r/popheads!](https://i.imgur.com/TyCW89o.png)

Welcome to the fifth rendition of the r/popheads **All Stars** Rate! Last year, we rated over fifteen hundred songs and you all had the opportunity to give some of the most robbed songs another chance to win, for the fifth time! I think it’s fair to say this has been a year of diversifying what we listen to and going out of our comfort zone, and it shows in the picks here! Our rate lineup comprises of 52 songs chosen by the wonderful 2021 rate hosts and 26 songs that were voted in by you! The full star-studded list of songs we’ll be rating is shown below. There’s a lot of amazing gems here so I hope to see you all participate whether this is your first rate or maybe your 100th! Yes I stole this blurb from creme last year but pretend you did not see it!

#The Rules:

Listen to every song listed and assign each of them a score from 1 to 10. Decimals are allowed, but refrain from going past one decimal place - 7.5 is fine, 7.75 is not!

Rate all seventy eight (78) songs! If you skip any, your ballot won’t be counted (I’ll let you know if you do so you can fix that).

You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track!

Please use this prepared link to submit your scores! Note that if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout it may not work - as such, I have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, and you should use a computer to send in your scores if possible.

If you ever need to change any scores after you’ve already submitted, just message me (u/CrimsonROSET) and I’ll be able to do that for you!

It is highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, like this:

>The Chainsmokers - Closer (feat. Halsey): 10 what do you mean this isn’t in the rate you have no proof are you the host no you can’t tell me I’m wrong

I can’t wait to see how this turns out! I’m following the tradition of first time hosts hosting All Stars after u/cremeebrulee did it so wonderfully last year (who I also stole most of the post from oops you didn’t see it) so some things might be a bit wonky, but have patience with me! At the end of the day, may the best song win!
