# Good morning, bugsnackers and bugslackers!

Welcome to The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Popheads History, also known as the **All Stars 5 day 1 reveal**! I hope you all are excited for it and are ready to have a couple of broken hearts by the end of this! Today, we'll be revealing #78 - #53, starting officially at 2PM EST (that's in an hour)! Join us in the [beatsense room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) where a bunch of shenanigans are about to go down, including hints, the songs themselves, as well as some interludes when I find right! But- now, for some statistics!

* All Stars 5 had a total of [115](https://pastebin.com/cE5P9DMA) participants, claps for all of you and you are now my favorites.
* The average score was 7.983, and the average controversy was 1.954! Anything over this can be considered controversial!

GapeCod: Holy shit, what an average for a grab bag, with **78 tracks** too. Isn't this even higher than Winners II?!

Anyway, IPR and K-pop BGs are my biggest meow meows for today, because misandry always wins.

## As such, we have our first song eliminated! I can't say I'm particularly surprised, as the longsongphobia, the men, and the topic were all heated on popheads- no pun intended. However, I'm still happy Jules sent this, if so we could get some representation from all menses in here! Even if this one- fell a bit flat.

# SEX!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): at least someone does

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): god i want a time machine to let him cruise me in a bathroom so bad

**frogaranaman** (10): is this the 10 minute version everyone was going crazy over a few weeks ago?

**GapeCod** (10): daddy? sorry‚Ä¶ daddy? sorry... daddy? sorrry.....

**ImADudeDuh** (10): If you complain about this song being too long, shut UP! Its a two part song and is a fucking sex positive BOP! And why did you force yourself to do the whole rate in one sitting?

**Roxieloxie** (10): bullying rate host is good actually

**runaway3212** (10): bestie george michael I want you sex too

**skargardin** (10): whew

**anothertown** (9.5): It's insane how much the cowbell adds to this. WAIT the horns just started and i noticed it's 9 minutes long. george michael has suspended my disbelief in the lyrics for 9 minutes just due to his epic delivery rip

**jsonphile** (9): we stan our sex positive king

**mudkip1** (9): not nine minutes long.. lol but I must admit I enjoyed it quite a bit

**vayyiqra** (9): I politely decline but good song

**waluigiest** (9): This is better than most sex ed curricula

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a good song but too long and outsold by every other single on the album

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.2): somethingsomething this song is legitimately sexy

**1998tweety** (8): bitch tf me too

**cherryices** (8): i think i would have enjoyed this more if i wasn‚Äôt listening to this playlist while studying for my driving theory test! (UPDATE: i failed!!)

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): I hope the person here who really likes George Micheal did this rate

**throwaway-7650** (8): standardized test bubble sheets page 1:

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): well, he goes straight to the point, no beating around the bush

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): üî¥üîµüî¥üîµüî¥THIS IS THE HORNY POLICEüî¥üîµüî¥üîµüî¥ YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR A CLASS D HORNY FELONY. üî¥üîµüî¥üîµüî¥

**trixiematthell** (7.3): classic george michael but horny

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I really really need to get more into George Michael‚Äôs discography because its so iconic (and I do love a couple of hits I‚Äôve heard) but I‚Äôm not sure this was as good for starting out as some songs would be, since it feels like a dive into the deep end of George Michael, which is good but something I‚Äôll probably appreciate more once I‚Äôve explored his catalogue further

**akanewasright** (7): This is like the least sexy song about horniness ever, but it‚Äôs camp so it‚Äôs fine

**bbfan132** (7): too long but catchy and fun

**bridgemoney** (7): Don't men need at least half an hour between parts 1 and 2?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): we love sex positivity but like also why is this 9 minutes and why did we need thrusting noises

**jaztinax** (7): sex positive monogamous king

**TiltControls** (7): maybe this'll draw some of the misandry and longsongphobia away from lftc

**qazz23** (6.9): i give it the sex number

**shhhneak** (6.9): It‚Äôs giving a lil too much educational video if my sex ed classes actually did their job.

# what about your sister

**bigbigbee** (6): UGH I‚Äôm so sorry about the long-song-phobia, I really think this song is so much fun, but I just can‚Äôt rate it high because I never am like ‚Äúyeah I want to listen to that!‚Äù

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I think this is a good song but I never want to listen to it again lol.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): so George Michael was bad at foreplay, got it

**homestarguy** (6): Love the second half a lot better. Not a great sit down and listen song, but woulda really hit in a club in '87 I bet.

**moooo566** (6): this is just like 9 minutes of george michael making fun of me for being single

**slimboyfriend** (6): idk I still think this album sounds like George Michael just learned how to use a drum machine a few months before making it

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): Part 1 bad Part 2 good it's like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

**tkajilili** (6): It's not bad but it's just not my thing. I've always found 80s heart of my sleeve style lyrics to be kind of cheesy

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): how the hell has this song not been in sex education? and i'm not long song phobic but we didn't need nine mins methinks

**seanderlust** (5.5): George Michael four minutes into this song

**camerinian** (5): Hate to say it but I've never been that into George Michael's more forceful tracks. He is all force here. No thanks.

**jman457** (5): Production slaps, ill give it that but many of the songs on Big Mouth are better than this

**flavasavavandal** (4.5): this song is camp and I can‚Äôt endorse it because it also sucks
[/r/popheads/comments/t1a8gz/all_stars_5_reveal_day_1_when_your_0_is_gone_the/hyf1s5t/]

=====

CrimsonROSET: **bo\_g\_o** (4): listen I hate longsongphobia as much as the next guy but this has absolutely no business being 9 minutes long. I would vastly prefer listening to the other 9 minute song from the main pop boys of 1987 rate

**hikkaru** (4): my longsongphobia is shining through

**moonagenightmares** (4): why was this 3 times longer than it needed to be

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Nah I‚Äôm good, thanks for the offer though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): imagine people listening to this song in 1987 and still somehow thinking george michael was straight

**welcome2thejam** (4): George Michael is horny on main for nine straight minutes and I'm not here for it

**wavingwolves** (3.9): i'm sorry but i'm being longphobic in this case

**terrencelovescum** (3.4): i hated the synths in the chorus. and to drag out the song to 9 min?

**thedoctordances1940** (3.4): ü•±

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): it was cute but too long i fear

**MrMoodle** (3): this is still the least sexy thing i‚Äôve heard in my life

**NFLfreak98** (3): It‚Äôs 2022, do you really expect me to support a song with this strong of an anti-gangbang message

**Stryxen** (3): when i came out to my parents my mum kept trying to force me to listen to george michael with her dhjfhf

**Verboten\_Prince** (2.9): This is kinda cringe ngl. Also I can‚Äôt take the horn/piano sound in the first half seriously cause it sound like the roblox victory fanfare

**fadedblue09** (2): Sorry but sex is not really my favorite music theme and‚Ä¶.9 minutes? Also those grunts are annoying

**nicolas<3** (2): those 9 minutes felt excruciatingly long

**static\_int\_husp** (2): I'm sexc positive but man this song is still weird as hell. Also Jesus this is way to long.

**Uberpigeon** (2): this is like donnie darko but for normal people. except im not normal i have brain worms and i dont want to listen to this for ten minutes

**Awkward\_King** (1): i waited 9 minutes for this song to get good and it never did

**plastichaxan** (1): i try not to be misandrist but god this is not as good as i remember

**BasedButta** (0): WASTING MY TIME FOR NINE MINUTES, DIE FOR SHIT INSTRUMENTAL CRIMES the singer‚Äôs performance rocks though lol credit where credit is due (but this doesnt help my suffering at all, seriously FUCK this song)

**kellyrabbit1105** (0): I feel bad giving this a 0 because it's considered a classic, but I found it annoying

**RandomHypnotica** (0): this has literally all of popheads phobias combined in one song (long songs, old songs, man songs, boring songs)

**UselessTacooo** (0): This song existing is a war crime

THIS WAS ROBBED AS FUCK!! I'm super mad, this was my 11 on its original rate, and I find it to be such a good song! A lot of people say this does not hold up to nostalgia, and I highly disagree. But as such- it is what it is, don't think things are getting better anytime soon!

---

#the show never ends!

**akanewasright** (10): There are so many songs from the early 10s that were just there on the radio all the time when I was first really listening to it but I never knew the title of. This was one, Jason Derulo‚Äôs don‚Äôt wanna go home was one, and in general jackisboredtoday just reminded me half of these songs existed at some point over the last year hdhdh

**cremeebrulee** (10): this deserved to win flo rida you will be DEALT with in winners

**flavasavavandal** (10): can Lupe stop pretending this song doesn‚Äôt absolutely slap please

**frogaranaman** (10): Lupe Fiasco is amazing

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Didn‚Äôt recognize this song by name but I instantly knew it once it started to play, this song is hard coded into my DNA I guess lol. This is such a good song and I‚Äôm kinda shocked it placed as ‚Äúlow‚Äù (heh) as it did, the chorus is iconic and now that I‚Äôm really listening to the verses they‚Äôre kinda great. I love a song that *actually* inspires and has something to say.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): first J. Cole robbed Lupe my eleven, now Taylor or Mark‚Ä¶

**MrMoodle** (10): why does this shit make me emotional i think i might have brain damage

**Roxieloxie** (10): sure

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Erykah Windu

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): i thought i was so cool for being able to rap the second verse flawlessly

**TiltControls** (10): WHY DONT WE HAVE 5 11s TO USE IN THIS RATE. somehow robbed from the top 10 and I'm still not entirely over it

**xearomis** (10): Okay maybe Lupe hates this song but it‚Äôs still perfect in my eyes

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): Instant feel-good song

**NotWith10000Men** (9.2): legit one of my forgotten faves from this era

**nt96** (9): The way this took back to my high school days. Holy crap.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.6): I had no idea that this song sampled Modest Mouse until.. I think it was either when I saw Todd In The Shadow's episode of that song or when I heard it in a Weird Al polka medley. Lupe's version is actually a pretty well-done interpolation.

**camerinian** (8.5): When I was 14 I got so giddy about a big pop song shouting out Auckland, and now I‚Äôm just wondering why we had to be named right next to the Gaza Strip, and now I'm regretting even bringing this up

**jman457** (8.5): Production sounds amazing, and totally different of what was popular at the time

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**anothertown** (8): this sample is so..

**Awkward\_King** (8): jack you're an absolute god for submitting this over aeroplanes

**jsonphile** (8): this being my 11 in the pop rap rate to an 8 here is like the smartest kid in high school going to a good college and realizing they‚Äôre actually pretty average now

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): speak on it lupe

**waluigiest** (8): this was too good for its original rate

**bigbigbee** (7.5): If a pop rap hook is good, a pop rap song is good. I have heard this song like a dozen times and I still don't have a good grasp on the verses, and it doesn't matter

**trixiematthell** (7.1): haven‚Äôt heard it before but feels like i should‚Äôve

**BasedButta** (6.5): this is good but i cant bring myself to give it a higher score idk why it makes me feel kinda weird

**bbfan132** (6.5): i forgot about this song lol, brings me back

**homestarguy** (6.5): Used to love this one back in the day as a Modest Mouse fan. But honestly? There's really nothing that Lupe adds to it that gets me super hyped anymore.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): my brother plays this song every single day as loud as he possibly can on his speakers and everytime i tell him to turn it off because i hate it but honestly im lying every time i say that bc i do kinda like this song regardless

#resold their tickets

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I don't like this but I wouldn't mind if this guy replaced Drake

**seanderlust** (5.5): Lupe I'm sorry but I kind of have to tank

**runaway3212** (5): Queen did it better

**welcome2thejam** (5): Decent, but I'd probably forget it if it didn't sample a song so heavily linked to my teenage music taste's development

**Verboten\_Prince** (4.6): I‚Äôm not even really a fan of Float On to begin with so this‚Ä¶

**AHSWeeknd** (4): no ‚ù§Ô∏è

**bo\_g\_o** (4): I just don't like the chorus

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): god this era aged like ass

**DefaultPophead** (4): Four for the kids that don't wanna be there!

**apatel27** (2): Out of respect for Lupe, can't give a high score to a song he was forced to put out and hates

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): We didn‚Äôt need this. We should have made Float On a bigger hit instead.

**nicolas<3** (1): i fell asleep who else fell asleep

**plastichaxan** (1): maybe the show should stop

**Stryxen** (1): i was screaming and crying and begging for it to end

**vayyiqra** (1): Oh no, not this. Unremitting hostility. I like "Float On" (I am a former hipster and ~old) and this is one of the worst uses of a sample I've ever heard. I haven't heard this since the 2000s, forgot about it and this was a jumpscare when it came on. I even skipped it and I never do that.

**wavingwolves** (1): the way this isn't nostalgic at all to me so it brings me no enjoyement whatsoever

**CaptainDaisyG** (0): This one gave me the most visceral bad memory, so I couldn‚Äôt finish it. Hated how much it used to get played for how bad it sounded. Probably not the worst, but what an immediate zero.

**throwaway-7650** (0): ...this is just T.G.I.F. but by a man and bad

frogaranaman: wow what a terrible start to this reveal

but on that note, it does bring me to a few rate-related lists I've been working on the past week or so. the first one being what I have called **the 11 fails** list

this is when your 11 goes out dead last in the rate. had no chance, even with your help. [you can see the list here](https://pastebin.com/c1iNR6M0)

as you can see, this is a pretty exclusive list: only **39** raters have ever gotten on there, and only **TWO** have made it twice (more impressive than embarrassing imo!)

this is probably the list with the least effort overall, and the only one I made that's on day one.. I'll fill you in on the rest day three. c:

Somehow, this managed to pick up the most 0s in the entire rate, and I hope you all know the consequences of your actions!! Videogame plot songs are fun, I don't know what you guys were expecting from this- but as such, it finished out our bottom3 finishes.

#gamers rise up!

**bigbigbee** (11): I didn‚Äôt even play this game but I love this song so, so much. There‚Äôs a short story by Isaac Asimov out there called The Last Question that gives me literal chills every time I read it; while there are other themes, part of it is about a supercomputer / technology that exists through several human lifespans. I have a fairly healthy fear of death (it used to be worse, so people out there struggling: it gets better!) and thinking about what will be around after I go is sobering but also kind of cool, in some ways. So despite the joke lyrics, despite the over-specific references to Portal, I actually find this to be a beautiful, emotional song.

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**akanewasright** (10): me to the 0s: ‚ÄúHere come the test results: You are a horrible person...I'm serious, that's what it says: 'A horrible person.' We weren't even testing for that. Don't let that horrible-person thing discourage you. It's just a data point...If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep.‚Äù

**Alumineous** (10): Remember when Value used to make games? Rihanna's impact!

**Awkward\_King** (10): vote for the vocaloid rate (?)

**bridgemoney** (10): Play this if the IPR songs make it past day 1

**fadedblue09** (10): I unironically ranked this song higher than all the Indieheads, HCP and P4k Acclaim songs, and I do not regret anything

**flavasavavandal** (10): Gladys did nothing wrong

**GapeCod** (10): I'm imagining a world where this and One Last Kiss both won their respective rates instead.

**homestarguy** (10): What a magical song, and the ultimate treat after escaping GladOS's clutches. I know it got memed a bunch over the years but it still hits big time.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen of pop

**MrMoodle** (10): this is weirdly beautiful

**nicolas<3** (10): portal actually scared me a kid so i never played it but this is a banger

**plastichaxan** (10): my 11 in the rate god this is so good and it‚Äôs gonna be so robbed i can feel it

**qazz23** (10): still one of the best ending themes

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god I miss Portal

**ricki** (10): i want this bitch to cover i feel fantastic

**Roxieloxie** (10): sing it siri

**runaway3212** (10): bitch the fuck me too

**skargardin** (10): main pop girl GLaDOS yasss

**Stryxen** (10): perfect perfect perfect song - deserved to win vgv truly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): #GLaDOSDidNothingWrong

**TiltControls** (10): In hindsight I wish I went with POP/STARS over this. Not that I think it's better (cause it isn't) but I fear a lot will be lost on non-gamer raters and this will end up going from 2nd in VGV to landing bottom 5

**xearomis** (10): Truly iconic, the first song I ever memorized the lyrics to

**bbfan132** (9): iconic theme‚Ä¶ or outro idk lol i haven‚Äôt played this

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this just makes me smile, it‚Äôs so delightfully weird and petty and undeniably fun to listen to even if you don‚Äôt understand the lyrics in the references

**wavingwolves** (9): the way i liked the songs from portal so much that it made me buy the game but i still haven't played.... shame on me

**camerinian** (8.5): I'm making a prediction here - moderate success

**shhhneak** (8.5): GLaDOS was the blueprint for many of these new girlies.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Glados outsold all your faves.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I love the instrumental but can't stand the autotune

**moooo566** (8): wow its the second best song called still alive from a noughties first person non-combat focused video game

**waluigiest** (8): takes me back to 8th grade

**seanderlust** (7.7): GLaDoS in STEM

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this is walking a fine line between Phoebe Bridgers and a Barbie movie

**jasannn** (7.5): I love it when popgirlies go introspective.

**nt96** (7): I'm in the mood for cake now.

**tkajilili** (7): iconic

**vayyiqra** (7): I get finding this song boring or silly or cheesy out of context but I don't think I ever finished this game either and it's kind of cute. Pretend the robot voice makes it hyperpop, idk.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.9): Yes I‚Äôm rating this lower than before. I miss Want You Gone :(

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): hmm i should finish portal 2 one day

**jaztinax** (6.5): this song feels like putting on an animated show thinking it‚Äôs a children‚Äôs show and your eyes slowly widen more and more as you realize you‚Äôre actually watching something messed up and dark

**trixiematthell** (6.5): sounds like abba

#want some cake?

**jsonphile** (6): this is‚Ä¶interesting I guess

**slimboyfriend** (6): y‚Äôall picked the inferior Portal song :/

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): i‚Äôm vibing a bit

**SinfulAnarchy** (5.5): this is cute but easily swallowed up by the other songs in the rate

**apatel27** (5): Want You Gone is better

**IdiotBox01** (5): this score is lower because exily vilify was snubbed

**jman457** (5): If this was Sufjan Stevens zaddy vocals this would be an easy

**just\_thonking** (5): I feel like I'm missing some critical context to enjoy this

**AHSWeeknd** (4): They should lip sync this on Drag Race

**BasedButta** (4): what the fuck? this obviously seems like it would need context of the game to be funny, but the song still kinda sucks anyway

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): okay i feel like video game music can be gimmicky/overly referential sometimes and this is one of them

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): probably makes more sense within the context of the game but idc i haven't played it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): I don't play this game so the vocals are just annoying to me

**NotWith10000Men** (2): vibe killer damn

**sweetnsaursauce11** (2): this voice is going to give me nightmares

**UselessTacooo** (2): I can‚Äôt get behind this, sorry

**moonagenightmares** (1): what the

**throwaway-7650** (1): ik it's intentional but this song is too creepy for me to like

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I haven‚Äôt played portal so like I have 0 connection to this so it‚Äôs just bad cause of the Glados vocals I‚Äôm sorry. Not even the humor can save it

**rslashpoopheads** (0): Rina Sawayama - STFU!

**terrencelovescum** (0): mom, come pick me up, im scared

**TragicKingdom1** (0): earnest defense of stuff like this was my biggest fear in allowing vgv to happen

GAMERPHOBIA NEVER ENDS!! This time justified! Yeah, I was never a fan of the inclusion of this in VGV- but it didn't win, so I'm much less mad at it here, where it massively underperformed!

#kinda slay

**akanewasright** (10): idc this song is excellent and adorable

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Them bringing back the Bonito Generation sound for this makes my heart so happy.

**camerinian** (10): I honestly wish I could say that "The key change in the Bugsnax theme song had brought me to tears numerous times" was a shitpost

**hikkaru** (10): a bop. not just a meme üò†

**homestarguy** (10): Love me some KKB. Talkin' bout Bugsnax!!! :)

**mudkip1** (10): it‚Äôs camp

**runaway3212** (10): KINDA BUG AND KINDA SNAX

**seanderlust** (10): kinda bug and kinda snack

**Stryxen** (10): it just makes me so happy

**throwaway-7650** (10): so overhated for WHAT... it's not like it's still alive

**TiltControls** (10): kinda camp kinda robbed. it's a 10 but this spot should've been dk rap or sonic or baba yetu or popstars or supergiant or katamari or ...

**vayyiqra** (10): Fuck all the haters, KKB is cute and fun I love them so much also I've never played Bugsnax but it looks fun

**wavingwolves** (10): there's nothing that gives me more sarah tonin than hearing sarah bonito sing the word BALONEY

**Awkward\_King** (9): this isnt for the meme i legitimately think this song serves cunt

**BasedButta** (9): LMAO? these lyrics make whatever a bugsnax is sound horrifying. strangely enough the song is quite decent and the rap-speaking part slaps???

**iniekcja\_** (9): I haven't listened to this a single time since the day it came out

**plastichaxan** (9): vote 2018 indie rate please‚Ä¶ pleek‚Ä¶ pleek

**qazz23** (9): fun and catchy

**skargardin** (9): EVERYONE'S TALKING BOUT BUGSNAX

**UselessTacooo** (9): The way this game was so hyped but was a flop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I think about Burger Eater maybe once a week. thanks popheads user TiltControls

**bridgemoney** (8.5): Red Dead 2 outsold.

**bbfan132** (8): super fun

**cremeebrulee** (8): kinda eleventh kinda place

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.9): I think my idea of them just doing a version of ‚ÄúLipslap‚Äù but replaced with ‚ÄúBugsnax‚Äù is slightly better but hey this is fine too

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): i'm slowly starting to like kkb i think

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): every time i listen to this I give it a different score

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): kinda bop and kinda slay idk I'm not good at this

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): its kyoot

**frogaranaman** (7): hmmmmm

**nt96** (7): Just like the game; equal parts cutesy and fucked up. If you know, you know.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it sure is

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): well‚Ä¶ it is certainly Bugsnax

**jman457** (6.5): Honestly ive never really clicked with Kero Kero Bonito

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.5): this is kind of cute

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): not their best unfortunately

#kinda naur

**apatel27** (6): Never been the biggest fan of this KKB style

**IIIHenryIII** (6): the food of the future

**jackisboredtoday** (6): damn it really is bugsnax huh?

**SinfulAnarchy** (6): this is kitschy, annoying, and juvenile

**waluigiest** (6): one day I‚Äôll learn what Bugsnax means

**trixiematthell** (5.8): fine

**jaztinax** (5.5): it‚Äôs cute but i wouldn‚Äôt listen to this again

**jsonphile** (5): okay I still have no idea what Kero Kero Benito is or what their deal is and I have no idea how to feel about this. Maybe it‚Äôs actually a masterpiece and I should be giving this a 10, maybe it‚Äôs terrible and this should be a 1 I genuinely have no idea

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): most unnecessary key change of all time

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (4): this song and game feel ominous to me

**flavasavavandal** (4): not entirely sure if this belongs in vgv since it‚Äôs basically just indie pop, and not particularly good indie pop

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): there‚Äôs something decent there but also it‚Äôs just terribly annoying

**AHSWeeknd** (3): why is this on Apple Music üíÄ

**just\_thonking** (3): The tasty quest! To fill the hole üòè

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): errrrr‚Ä¶well slay i guess

#BITCH DON'T WEAR NO SHOES IN MY HOUSE

**frogaranaman** (11): if you guys put this outside the top ten again I will put 100 bands on popheads' shit

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way this didn‚Äôt win the original rate was criminal

**akanewasright** (10): I do not trust anyone who gives this a low score.

**bbfan132** (10): :listening:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This didn‚Äôt even make top 10 in its rate?? Is this sub on crack??

**homestarguy** (10): Eee Err. Eee err. Stone cold bop, plus there's a lyric about putting a hit on George Zimmerman. What's not to love?

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this will be robbed I can feel it. Maybe it will finally get justice whenever we do the melodic hip hop rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): every single line is so fucking quotable ugh my fucking wig

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is gonna do worse here than it did in tiktok and its gonna send me back to my villain era

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): did this come out during covid 1 like what is time

**UselessTacooo** (10): I get so much nostalgia from this song, and that‚Äôs probably why it was an 11 contender for me at one point

**bo\_g\_o** (9): every time I hear this song it grows on me a little more, also vote EE ER for the next rate cycle

**seanderlust** (9): you know what I was wrong initially this is great. don't wear no shoes in my house!!!!

**jsonphile** (8.5): I feel like this is gonna go day 1 because popheads‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt like rap but come on this slaps

**emayzee** (8.3): truly the last time our world has ever known peace

**rslashpoopheads** (8): okay I actually like this way more than the last time we rated it

**bridgemoney** (7): Some really sneaky rate promo in the intro.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I never got the hype for this one. I mean, his flow is nice, but the backing track is so generic. I've heard it too many times in so many different songs.

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): this better not be the first song out

**BasedButta** (6.5): cant believe im saying this but the eeh ooh beat is solid

**jaztinax** (6.5): it‚Äôs not THAT good

**sufjancaesar** (6.5): Shocked this blew up like it did ngl

**trixiematthell** (6.2): how was this such a hit?

**Uberpigeon** (5): akane doesnt trust me anymore

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): You know what popheads? No, this is not that good. I don‚Äôt understand what you people see in this song. It‚Äôs not like the beat is special, or his lyricism is top-notch, or his flow is pleasant to listen to (it certainly is unique). Why? Why?? Do you all just like ‚Äúee er‚Äù that much???

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (4): it‚Äôs cool he can make that sound with his mouth but I do not like it

**1998tweety** (3): im sorry but i still find this song very mediocre, apparently his latest album wasnt great so i feel vindicated

**fadedblue09** (3): sorry but those whiny effects are not it

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I had actually never heard this before the rate‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt get it

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): I regret thinking TikTok has taste

**Cucugeniality** (0): it got so overplayed i ended up being completely annoyed by it üíÄ

Hayley Williams won't see heaven for emo-related crimes, but I thought this was always good! It seems popheads did not agree!

---

#beat that drum!

**hikkaru** (10): this will flop even more than in bupr but we love you slayley

**IIIHenryIII** (10): ‚Äú9 this should‚Äôve been a ten, but I hate those ya-ya‚Äôs‚Äù fuck you past me

**jaztinax** (10): go off queen!!

**skargardin** (10): depression anthem yas

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): haley did what she had to do here

**throwaway-7650** (10): "took me 3 days to send you this, but uh, sorry, I was in‚ÄÖa‚ÄÖdepression" me submitting rates after the extension due date

**UselessTacooo** (10): YA YA YA YA YAYAYAYA

**waluigiest** (10): it‚Äôs no secret that I adore Petals for Armor. I think this song highlights the best pieces of the record. The songwriting is superb‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll recover from ‚ÄúEvery morning I wake up / from a dream of you holding me / underwater.‚Äù It‚Äôs got this classic Paramoresque charm, which comes out in the shouty refrains and the xylophone-infused beat. And her voice effortlessly flips between tones giving the song this smooth blend of anger, sadness, and acceptance. I feel like I‚Äôm sharing her grief. It‚Äôs a masterpiece.

**wavingwolves** (10): anyone that gives this less than a 8 should be banned from listening to paramore's next album

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this and sugar on the rim are the only good songs on the album I‚Äôm afraid

**akanewasright** (9): her making the biggest bop of the album about her coming to terms with her abusive relationship and hypocrisy yass

**bo\_g\_o** (9): popheads users making posts just to drag solar power

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Cod reggae but I‚Äôm pescatarian

**homestarguy** (9): Love the After Hours-esque slinky and slick groove. The quirky post-chorus "ya-ya" gives it some swagger too.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): like this one a lot

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I‚Äôve really enjoyed Haley‚Äôs recent solo stuff but also where is After Laughter 2.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): it‚Äôs still a good song but I no longer connect with this as much as I did when I 11ed it, if I go a redo I would choose Nightmare or Sugar on the Rim

**apatel27** (8): One of the more straight forward songs on this album

**BasedButta** (8): she‚Äôs right, its a silly little song but its good!

**nicolas<3** (8): i bopped

**plastichaxan** (8): not the best on the album but pretty good

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I love how the Spotify background visualiser is Hayley literally hammering a nail in a coffin

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): sugar on the rim robbed sweetie

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): I have complicated thoughts about Hayley‚Äôs solo debut‚Ä¶ but thankfully we‚Äôre rating one of the two songs on that album I unconditionally like

**NotWith10000Men** (7.2): i liked this song better in the original rate

**bbfan132** (7): one of my least favorites off of petals for armor but it‚Äôs also grown on me

**bridgemoney** (7): OMG STOP STARTING SONGS WITH VOICEMAILS IT'S SO DAMN OVERDONE YOU'RE NOT BEING CLEVER OR UNIQUE AT ALL.

**fadedblue09** (7): She's fine‚Ä¶never understood why this is the consensus fave. Pure Love deserved

**hunnybee12** (7): this album was such a let down for me. paramore comeback incoming YASS

**iniekcja\_** (7): there are way too many better songs on this

**runaway3212** (7): literally me

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): can‚Äôt wait for more Paramore in 2022, then maybe I‚Äôll undo the Stockholm syndrome I inflicted on myself to think this is good

**TiltControls** (7): to me Hayley's album was all around good, but nowhere really great and while this track is one of the better one's it still follows that feeling

**vayyiqra** (7): Wish this weren't kind of relatable

**trixiematthell** (6.9): i love paramore

**1998tweety** (6.5): erm

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): i am lorde ya ya ya

#skip it like a record

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Remember that dead horse Solar Power comment? Yeah‚Ä¶

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this is a This Is Acting era Sia song

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): thinking abt how hard i defended petals for armor at every turn and i honestly dont even know if i like the album that much

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): still don't care for this

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): this is so inoffensively bland, hayley‚Äôs voice lacks emotion and the outro sounds like it was ripped straight off disney jr.

**jman457** (4): This song kind of feels like a dead horse

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): eough those yayayas in the bridge. sounds absolutely dreadful

**MrMoodle** (3): i am hayley ya ya ya, anyway this is boring as fuck

**buddhacharm** (2): me, acknowledging the condition of the animal that Zeke blew up after triggering the thunder sprear:

**2dina3dworld** (1): Imagine if you got Ari to write a song off of After Laughter‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd get this

**flavasavavandal** (1): The fact there was enough support for this Hayley album to have it be rated shows the lack of taste this sub exhibits at times

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): This song is very annoying to me. I think it's just ok synth pop, and then the "ya ya ya"s at one point get on my nerves so much.

**letsallpoo** (0): Hayley's mediocre album was woefully outclassed in that rate and it's cosmically funny how its top performing song just sounds like an after laught

CrimsonROSET: #the carti feat

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**bo\_g\_o** (6): I did not see that Carti feature coming

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): her insulting Florida water is so funny to me

**IIIHenryIII** (6): too monotonous for my taste

**joeeswift** (6): I was thoroughly enjoying this until the Carti verse.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): wait this is hitting a bit

**Stryxen** (6): we‚Äôve all seen the pictures she looks absolutely beautiful‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs there

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): started to bore me around the middle

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.9): Are you sure this isn‚Äôt an interlude? Like not that Solange‚Äôs part is bad, it just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere. But whoever that is that‚Äôs rapping‚Ä¶ someone please get him to stop

**MrMoodle** (5): don‚Äôt touch my hair is the only solange song that‚Äôs ever really clicked for me, everything else just feels so‚Ä¶ vibey? like, you barely ever get a good hook or a riff or a groove or anything. i feel bad giving her a score on the lower end because i do respect her and what she does but her music just kind of washes off me, i listened a few times trying to get this song to make an impact on me but i kind of just forget what it sounds like as soon as i finish it?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): it was a good song until playboi carti showed up

**flavasavavandal** (4): I personally cannot imagine a world where I would actively seek this out, and that was before Playboi Carti appeared

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I don‚Äôt feel like my thoughts would be constructive to this conversation but girl‚Ä¶

**nicolas<3** (4): not the best song by solange in the rate i fear

**RandomHypnotica** (4): I don't think When I Get Home is a bad album, and there's defintiely songs on it that are great‚Ä¶ but this song has NEVER been one to me

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Really not feeling this one.

**BasedButta** (1): The main beat is so bad it fucking kills the interesting sounds that pop up here and there. Also, I get the concept of the singing but it‚Äôs not good to listen to. your lyrics SAVE you from the 0 that was coming your way. you better thank mr. george michael for that as well.

**xearomis** (1): This whole song feels like the same 15-second clip on loop, except that mumble rap (?) portion near the end that only makes it worse

#happy black history month i guess

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Solange is honestly an ET because no one on earth can make music this good

**Awkward\_King** (10): for some reason this song i associate with the second euphoria special, the one about jules, released about a year ago, bc i was home alone and had that on the tv while i was just vibing round my house to this, and thats a really nice memory

**bbfan132** (10): this whole album is great!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): dreamy ethereal heavenly

**fadedblue09** (10): I‚Äôm still in shock how this album was done dirty

**frogaranaman** (10): Solange was so unfairly robbed in this rate

**Roxieloxie** (10): if you dont like this song its okay, its not for you <3

**runaway3212** (10): I just love solange‚Äôs voice so fucking much

**skargardin** (10): an 11 contender honestly..

**terrencelovescum** (10): absolutely ethereal and hypnotic. if ur not getting high to this and shaking ur ass then what are u doing??

**waluigiest** (10): so much of her music is an unapologetic celebration of Blackness and it‚Äôs so deeply beautiful. And she puts it over this otherwordly beat. STUNNING.

**akanewasright** (9): ‚ÄúWhen I ~~die~~ leave the rate at #7, I want r/popheads to ~~lower me into my grave~~ vote me into All Stars 5, just so they can let me down one last time‚Äù - Solange, probably

**iniekcja\_** (9): how does it feel so much longer than it actually is

**throwaway-7650** (9): this did not help convince me that playboi carti is good

**vayyiqra** (9): Proof that Pharrell should still be allowed to make music sometimes

**jman457** (8.8): This is just a vibe to the umpteenth degree, and with a killer message and feature from carti

**homestarguy** (8.5): Love the shimmering synths and the uneasy beat.

**mudkip1** (8): I‚Äôve sat on WIGH for a long time and I‚Äôve now realized how similar it is to Sling by Clairo. They‚Äôre both beautiful, vibey albums that can be a slog to attentively listen to but they‚Äôre beautiful to have on in the background while working on other things.

**nt96** (8): ilumadahmundswitllumps

**TiltControls** (8): The best of the album, which unfortunately isn't saying much (see: the rate results) - but the track itself is great!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): quite clearly the weakest song from this rate to make all-stars for me but at least it's got a good carti verse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Playboi Carti sounds really good over this instrumental.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): was not expecting Carti to be on this and then it just ended?

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): I promise I love this album when I listen to it all the way through

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.2): solange knows how to deliver a catchy melody

**trixiematthell** (7.2): would‚Äôve preferred without the rap but still enjoyed

**sufjancaesar** (7): Something about the arrangement here is grating to me but it still fucks

**SinfulAnarchy** (6.5): honestly im kinda bored

**shhhneak** (6.1): I could‚Äôve done without the Carti feature.

I'd say this is my own little revenge for smackdown's ballot count, but I don't think that's fair because I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE OUT! K-Pop Boy Groups was a really fun rate for me this year that introduced me to a lot of new music (even as my 11 didn't make it very far) and clearly, a lot of people in popheads agree!

---

#you dropped this king

**runaway3212** (11): yes im giving this my 11 because I find beomgyu hot what about it

**wavingwolves** (11): soobin is gay (also there's nothing that can compare to the amount of dopamine this song creates in my brain... it's close to being capable of curing my depression in a way fluoxetine and sertraline never did)

**bigbigbee** (10): This song puts color into my life when I hear it

**bo\_g\_o** (10): MEORIE PPURI SOSA

**GapeCod** (10): Realizing that the morse code in the intro actually spells out CROWN was my biggest transfem in STEM moment.

**hikkaru** (10): meow meows

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is an excellent pop song everything just works so well here

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): beomgyu is gay

**ricki** (10): hueningkai is gay

**skargardin** (10): imagine having a debut THIS perfect, they SNAPPED

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): mahoosive bop

**jman457** (9): A great little pop tune

**throwaway-7650** (9): yeonjun is a fucking queerbaiter. fucker

**akanewasright** (8.5): [yass](https://tenor.com/view/bear-gay-smell-gay-people-this-bear-can-smell-gay-people-gif-18224398)

**homestarguy** (8.5): Nothing this song does exceptionally well, just does literally everything well. Cool beat, a tight Chainsmokers-esque chorus, and plenty of swagger in the vocals.

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.5): TXT were one of my favourite discoveries last year

**TiltControls** (8.5): I love the energy to this song, especially the lead up into the chorus has something special about it

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**AHSWeeknd** (8): K-Pop Boy Groups got some serious bops

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I don‚Äôt have to know what they‚Äôre saying! I just FEEL it!

**Roxieloxie** (8): rona can you add a crown emote here please

**trixiematthell** (7.8): kinda reminded me of the 2010s in a great way

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): grown off me a bit since the bg rate but its still better than anything their senior group has released so

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): The picky producer nerd in me wishes there were no drums in the pre-choruses so that the chorus can have more impact but eh whatever. Still a good tune nevertheless.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.5): Y‚Äôall seemed to love this song the last time so I feel bad rating this kinda low, especially since Chaos Chapter was basically my favorite album of 2021 (and Loser=Lover my favorite song WHEN ARE WE RATING THAT POPHEADS), but I mean‚Ä¶ this sounds like they had 4 different ideas for a chorus and they just decided to use all of them at the same time‚Ä¶

**BasedButta** (7): good chorus but i heard a skrrt. 0.5 will be duly subtracted. (for legal purposes this is a joke)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Is that morse code?

**waluigiest** (7): this could be the intro music for Queer Eye

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): i swear i don't always hate kpop

#dentistry? in MY music forum?

**bbfan132** (6): it‚Äôs decent

**rslashpoopheads** (6): cute

**welcome2thejam** (6): More songs need to start by dropping a message in Morse Code

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): it sounds like literally any other kpop song idk what to tell you

**Awkward\_King** (5): tomorrow/together this pronoun shit gettin outta hand

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): it's not bad but I wouldn't ever listen to this out of my own volition

**IIIHenryIII** (3): no thanks, I prefer tomorrow and alone

**just\_thonking** (3): This sounds like the Chainsmokers (derogatory)

**nicolas<3** (3): both overrated and bad yikes

**UselessTacooo** (3): it just sounds like every other K-pop song. Give me some originality please.

**fadedblue09** (2): most overrated kpop group since Loona methinks

Oh, Kesha. This is my main piece of proof popheads decided they hate fun for no good reason! This is just such a silly pop song, and that isn't enough to escape bottom10 of All Stars, the competition is that sharp! This is only the beginning!

#what is she blowing on

**1998tweety** (10): raunchy sex bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is such ‚Äúyou are six and you‚Äôre supposed to be asleep but you‚Äôre creating melodramas with your bratz dolls that would put Euphoria to shame‚Äù core

**akanewasright** (10): thinking about how die young got kicked off of radio after a school shooting‚Ä¶ this song was foreshadowing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this sub on every rate reveal day

**ImADudeDuh** (10): James Daddy Beek

**skargardin** (10): God this video is so camp

**throwaway-7650** (10): tbh something actually on Animal should've been sent :oop:

**wavingwolves** (10): beyonc√© and kesha both releasing songs called BLOW that are some of the best of their careers? their minds, truly

**flavasavavandal** (9): Oh I found the flair, personality and charisma missing on Only Girl

**jaztinax** (9): i miss this era of party music

**seanderlust** (9): I was in college when this came out I'm not giving this below a 9 and that's final

**UselessTacooo** (9): outdated electropop? Yes please

**vayyiqra** (9): One of the better electro-trash Ke$ha songs

**bo\_g\_o** (8.5): I will forever associate this song with victorious and I don't know what to think about that

**camerinian** (8.5): I was wondering if I still liked this as much as I did age 14, and then that final chorus hit

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): by all means this song is terrible and ridiculously annoying and yet it's still amazing

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This was a moment

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Sometimes all you need is one word.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this mv is so camp wait

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The only real downside to this and ‚ÄúThe One That Got Away‚Äù is that I still have to give Dr. Luke a single stream.

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): again, i listened to this song SO MUCH in 2011 i can't handle it now but high points for nostalgia

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i think its time to admit kesha isnt a main pop girl anymore :(

**TiltControls** (8): even in my kesha-anti days I could tell this was a bop

**bridgemoney** (7.8): I loved that Victorious episode.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): not the best Kesha song but it is a classic

**trixiematthell** (7.6): i miss the old kesha but its for the best

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I appreciate the animal (heh) ferocity with which Kesha attacked some of her early tracks but she wouldn‚Äôt perfect this ‚Äúdancing through catastrophe‚Äù pop until *Warrior*

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): ah the fleetingness of a main pop girl

**anothertown** (7): shrunk

**bbfan132** (7): not the biggest fan of her older stuff but this is pretty good

**frogaranaman** (7): TSA agents HATE her

**homestarguy** (7): I never loved early Kesha, though I gotta admit this is probably my favorite of her early stuff. That sparse synth lead and beat along with her vocals in the verses are brilliant, even if the chorus gets a little obnoxious.

**jman457** (7): Just pure 2010‚Äôs pop

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i need to go back to these 2010ish songs with my good headphones and pay attention to the production

**runaway3212** (7): a decent attempt at remaking tiktok

**waluigiest** (7): she leaned into the camp and created one of the more dated songs of the era

**jasannn** (6.5): the chorus ruins the song tbh

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): this is at least more stupid fun than the Rihanna song

#this song blows haha get it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): ok but why does this bassline sound like Gangnam Style

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.6): Hmmmmmmmmmm this is more annoying than I remember

**jsonphile** (5): of all the Kesha songs why are we rerating this one? It‚Äôs honestly not that interesting in a good or bad way it‚Äôs just kinda there

**SinfulAnarchy** (4.5): this is so dated and noisy. her Victorious performance of this though‚Ä¶ now that was a moment

**nt96** (2): I never liked Kesha when I was younger, although that had more to do with the fact I used to think mainstream pop music was crap. Now that I'm older, I've since been more openly embracing of all kinds of pop music. Relistening to this song has now taught me one thing: I just fucking hate her music.

**Awkward\_King** (1): i always used to think i was listening to the wrong song whenever i'd see people list this as an iconic pop song and id click the link and not only not recognise it but also not like it, this should be cannibal smh smh

**MrMoodle** (1): the bridge saves it from being my 0, but otherwise this sounds like shit?? like really obviously fucking terrible??? easily the worst chorus in the rate, don‚Äôt even remotely see the appeal. i understand the recent critical reappraisal of kesha‚Äôs role in early 2010s party music and think it‚Äôs great that‚Äôs happening, but guys some of this shit was just genuinely fucking awful let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves lol

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): kesha's always been one of those people i enjoy as a person but not musically and this is like bottom of the barrel braindead electropop im sorry

**just\_thonking** (0): I am giving this song a zero not because it is bad per se, but because the world would be no different if it had never existed. It is worth nothing. It doesn't stand out among songs from its time -- in fact it doesn't even stand out among Kesha songs from that era. It sounds like what a computer would make if it was solely trained on songs on the radio in 2010 that used autotune.

people were sure this was gonna go out much sooner than it did, as well as the entirety of IPR! Will their indie counterparts make better, and perhaps even make it to day3? who knows, all I know is that sleepyhead would have done even worse somehow!

---

#LOOK AT ME OH LOOK AT ME

**cremeebrulee** (11): i have tried writing a proper comment for this song in like, three different rates now and i still can't precisely put in words how it makes me feel. somehow it manages to bring me to edge of despair its singing about but also manages to reel (haha) me in before i reach a state too existential. i've spent too many hours looping this, staring at my ceiling fan, wondering if this is really the way i'll always be. (maybe that's the reason it was second on my spotify wrapped last year). there's a lot of old favorites in this all stars lineup, i get that this song is divisive and its totally leaving at 73rd, but idc! this song has managed to impact me profoundly in such a short amount of time, i can't think of 11ing anything else. also because this is free and therapy is expensive xx

**emayzee** (11): as someone who went into the indie pop rock rate having only ever heard 3 passion pit songs (none of which were even in that rate) this song has been on loop for me ever since

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I really tried to convince myself I could give my 11 to anything other than this‚Ä¶ anyway, this will definitely be my lowest placing 11 ever and it's undeserved!

**akanewasright** (10): oh no

**bo\_g\_o** (10): this song has got some real fucking nerve growing on me out of nowhere. when I first heard it I thought it was really annoying, especially the vocals, which I thought (and still kinda do) sounded like an untrained SpongeBob AI. I still held these opinions when I did the rate, so I initially gave this song a 0. but then this motherfucker decided to do something even more annoying and get stuck in my head the next day, so I decided to return to it, and you know what? somehow my thoughts on it completely changed. I have no clue how but the singer's voice all of a sudden didn't bother me and I warmed up to the super vibrant synths. you know what else I discovered? this song is really dark! like it's about the lead singer struggling with his mental health to the point where he's begging for literally any way out of the pain he is in. and tbh that kinda resonated with me, cause I also feel like absolute shit sometimes and would give almost anything to just not feel this way. so like this comment went in a very weird and somewhat dark direction but what I'm basically trying to say that I completely fell in love with this song and find it really comforting and soothing, and honestly I cannot stop listening to it now

**bridgemoney** (10): Still an absolute bop, my go to existential dread song.

**camerinian** (10): Thank you to the IPR Gods that allowed this song to come back into my life. It has not left my On Repeat playlist since. This encapsulates everything that Passion Pit tried to do on that album perfectly, the unhinged panic, the shrill anxiety in the performances, and just hooks for days. Inches away from an 11 for me

**GapeCod** (10): Pioneered couples therapy for rate hosts.

**homestarguy** (10): Maybe the most overlooked gem on Manners. The driving, shimmering synth groove mixed with some dark personal lyrics...it's the Passion Pit formula to a T.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): please, don‚Äôt let this go on day 1

**Roxieloxie** (10): more depression music yass

**skargardin** (10): LOOK AT ME OH LOOK AT ME IS THIS THE WAY I'LL ALWAYS BE

**Stryxen** (10): EVERYDAY I LIE AWAKE AND PRAY TO GOD TODAY'S THE DAY OH NO OH NO HERE I AM OH HERE I AM OH WHEN WILL SOMEONE UNDERSTAND OH NO OH NO üíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉ

**TiltControls** (9.5): I feel for hypno who'll have to see what the as5 average for this song will do to Passion Pit

**Awkward\_King** (9): hypno spilled when this was his favourite band of all time

**runaway3212** (9): me when im reel

**vayyiqra** (9): Much like with MGMT, Passion Pit hate must END but they do have better songs I fear (we need Gossamer rate)

**waluigiest** (9): they were done so dirty in this rate

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): vocals still aren't great but it's a massive bop regardless

**bbfan132** (8.5): floating somewhere rn

**nicolas<3** (8): bitch its the serve

**wavingwolves** (7.9): hypno if you're reading this i hope you forgive me for scoring a passion pit song a 1 last month

**jman457** (7.8): better outside of the album that felt like a bit of a slog

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): Okay so at some point between IPR and now I had a realization‚Ä¶ this song is actually kinda amazing? But only this song. Don‚Äôt push it Mr. Angelakos.

**trixiematthell** (7.6): it felt chaotic in like a good way

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I didn‚Äôt have a comment for this one in the original rate, but I‚Äôd like to take this opportunity to say that I did raise my score by a whole .5. I have undergone Passionpitification

**BasedButta** (7): i can feel their energy but it doesn‚Äôt transfer to me?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I really wanted to rep for Passion Pit in this rate but‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt. I wish y‚Äôall had picked Sleepyhead or Little Secrets instead.

**jaztinax** (7): this has the potential to grow on me if i can get over the annoying vocals

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I swear there‚Äôs a sound in the background of this song that reminds me so much of this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks5cWd5STT0

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

#OH NOOOO (this song came on!)

**AHSWeeknd** (6): ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me‚Äù the TCC in a nutshell

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the vocals and production mixing seems super off, maybe it‚Äôs just an indie pop thing but it‚Äôs seems extra notable here. There is a bop somewhere in here but it‚Äôs just kind of messy

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6): i like the chorus

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): I‚Äôm so sorry but the piano in the bridge just gives me a headache

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): sleepyhead deserved

**anothertown** (5): play sleepyhead

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): this is so sonically messy and borderline irritating

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): yeah sorry i still hate this guy‚Äôs voice lmao

**flavasavavandal** (4): not my sound but marginally worse

**ricki** (4): they couldnt get some competent female vocalist sing in this? :/

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): I‚Äôm convinced this is just a very advanced rickroll

**TragicKingdom1** (4): less dreadful than the other songs on the album but this is the dredges of the genre imo

**UselessTacooo** (4): This is grating but not in a yassification way

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I guess I don‚Äôt like passion pit

**just\_thonking** (3): oh man I cannot stand this dude's voice

**qazz23** (3): don't like the vocal style

**rslashpoopheads** (3): why's the intro sound like it's from Paper Mario

**NotWith10000Men** (1.5): i'm truly not an indiehead

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): i really tried to overlook how annoying this guy‚Äôs voice is in the chorus bc the instrumental is actually good but i couldn‚Äôt do it

One of two Halsey songs out, and while I do prefer 3am, I don't think this is a good spot for this to go out! Halsey going all-out rocker in the new era has been such a pleasant surprise, and I think this was a bit of the blueprint for it- it's such a banger!

---

#halsey figure out your albums challenge

**CarlieScion** (11): n11ghtmare so true

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A bop to this day

**akanewasright** (10): the irony in this song being a Halsey stan‚Äôs greatest dream being realized

**GapeCod** (10): PLEASE DROP THE ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID VERSION

**hikkaru** (10): halsey putting this on the extended version of iichliwp is promo for this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a slapper that should have been on the main album!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (10): If this had been a bigger hit we would be looking at a different sound in pop right now, I truly believe that.

**jman457** (10): Nah Halsey snapped hard here, really showing her glimps of greatness.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok ngl since IICHLIWP came out this hits a little less, but it's still a banger

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I can‚Äôt wait to finally 11 this when we rate it for the third time as part of IICHLIWP yaaaas

**skargardin** (10): It really sends how Halsey included this on IICHLIWP after we rated it as an unofficial part of Manic

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): this is the song that got me into halsey and for good reason

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): makes me want to shout at things

**UselessTacooo** (10): the beginning of Rocksey. I‚Äôm so glad the reception on this was good because if it wasn‚Äôt we probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten IICHLIWP.

**wavingwolves** (10): forever thinking about a comment IAmADudeDuh's made abou this song back in 2019 that went "halsey sweetie i'm sorry these people think this cacophony of a chorus is your best work"

**IIIHenryIII** (9.7): I still don't get why she didn't give us more of this on Manic. C'mon!

**anothertown** (9): halsey4popheadsmod2022

**camerinian** (9): It only took two wack album cycles for Halsey to work out how to lean into her edge in a potent way, and of course it was the first time she started flopping on the charts, smh

**iniekcja\_** (9): oh she's so punkyyy

**jaztinax** (9): this is what she‚Äôs meant for

**jsonphile** (9): angry pissed off Halsey is best Halsey

**runaway3212** (9): literally me

**NotWith10000Men** (8.8): woof that was a rough stretch of songs between halsey and rina why did y'all do that to me

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): oh wait yeah this is a banger i forgor

**trixiematthell** (8.8): she‚Äôs grown on me

**bridgemoney** (8.5): Damn, this Halsey chick makes some pretty good music. Can't wait to hear what my favorite music review site thinks of her.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): her second best song, i wish she did more stuff like this

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): can the nightmare they run Halsey out of just collapse already

**Awkward\_King** (8): the video for this is so yassified

**bo\_g\_o** (8): this is extremely over the top but it works

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): always rooting for Halsey

**throwaway-7650** (8): can't wait to give this an 8 again in the IICHL,IWP rate

**vayyiqra** (8): Edgy but the chorus is good

**BasedButta** (7.5): i was gonna complain on how this was too overall too slow and uninspired and needed more of the fast parts but i then realized she probably doesnt even have any more of those. even the chorus (that was good) gets repetitive, and that was surprising when it‚Äôs the only part with any gas in it, the rest feels put in at the last minute

**bbfan132** (7): grew on me honestly, it‚Äôs fun

**homestarguy** (7): Dig the raw vocals from Halsey even though the instrumental didn't totally grab me.

**nicolas<3** (7): did trent reznor and atticus ross produce this too

**emayzee** (6.8): it's been 3 years and i still can't decide how i feel about this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I like the idea of this song but the sonic choices she made weren‚Äôt great, like those ticking drums on the verses are more annoying than anything else‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs edgy without being campy so it falls a bit flat.

**TiltControls** (6.5): It's good, but there's so much better on the album

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.4): I‚Äôm sorry I kinda liked it when I first heard it but some of the lyrics are just soooo stupidly edgy and angsty

#did NOT have a hot topic phase

**flavasavavandal** (6): Halsey may have found her sound but this could be better, good for them though

**slimboyfriend** (6): I think it‚Äôs the generic production that holds this one back for me

**Uberpigeon** (6): why does she keep putting this on different albums

**MrMoodle** (5): i feel like so many halsey songs have loads of parts that work really well in isolation but they just kind of randomly alternate without any decent transition, you‚Äôre at 0 then 100 then 0 then 100 and it‚Äôs just weird. nightmare reprise does it a little better.

**sufjancaesar** (5): Can‚Äôt not find this cringe I‚Äôm sorry Halsey fans

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This just feels like a worse, less developed version of the songs on IICHLIWP.

**IdiotBox01** (4): this sounds like angsty twenty one pilots so i don't understand the rave reviews, halsey angry sounds like a basic sorority girl mad that she spilled her coffee

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): um well it sure is

**musical\_pyn** (2): there is almost nothing about this song that I enjoy, the mix on the choruses is awful and I can't tell if it's intentional or not--the lyrics save it from being my zero, but not by much

**fadedblue09** (1): Can't believe these words are coming out of my mouth, but wow I'm actually relieved that Miley Cyrus won

**frogaranaman** (1): I wish the songwriting wasn't so clunky and awkward

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Hmmm‚Ä¶ nope its still bad! This is the definition of a song that works great on paper but the execution is ROUGH

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): modern day imagine dragons unironically is a better excuse for ‚Äúrock‚Äù music than whatever the fuck this is

**seanderlust** (0): I really don't like this sorry. I don't like how they sound on the chorus, I don't like the intermittent faux-trap drums. the message is good but this is the one song on this playlist that I would love to never hear again

**steelstepladder** (0): she really needed Trent Reznor to make this sound work huh?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): this chorus is simply atrocious lol

**waluigiest** (0): There is something down deep in my heart, repelling me from enjoying her music

**homestarguy** (9): So dang slick, with a head-bopping groove. Love the hints of New Jack Swing in the chorus too.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.9): At first this wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to being my favorite EXO song, but at some point I realized it‚Äôs actually a banger

**runaway3212** (10): if prince‚Äôs averages falls even more im suing bitches starting with this bitch u/tragickingdom1

**slimboyfriend** (10): The playlist has the wrong version of the song and even without the iconic guitar solo I‚Äôm still giving 10

**welcome2thejam** (10): Six pristine minutes of Prince saying no to being the rebound

**akanewasright** (9): I‚Äôm not witty enough to write Prince thirst that‚Äôs fun to read but like‚Ä¶ imagine it

**ricki** (9): makes me feel like im in a commercial for a mall

**throwaway-7650** (9): ICNTTPOYM? FIONA?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): A great song but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one of my favorites from him

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): and you also could never take one of the top 10 spots in this rate, sorry

**TiltControls** (8.5): easily the most fun track on the album and was so glad it was the highest rated (even if that only meant getting like 8th)

**anothertown** (8): rare volcel moment from prince

**bo\_g\_o** (8): prince did his thing here

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I‚Äôm generally anti-Prince but this is cute

**MrMoodle** (8): i hate how old people have the same song on like 7 different albums on spotify you‚Äôre fucking up my scrobbles pull it together people

**qazz23** (8): good mix of pop & funk

**Roxieloxie** (8): yass slay etc

**skargardin** (8): ok so maybe the instrumentals made some points

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): never heard a bad prince song tbh

**waluigiest** (8): idk why but I am so smitten by the drums on this track

**trixiematthell** (7.9): liked this, can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never heard it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll try‚Äù glad to see he remembered he‚Äôs Prince and he can do whatever the fuck he wants

**1998tweety** (7.5): thats debatable

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): prince sexy as fuck but king sexier

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): at first I didn't like this but now I groove with it

**BasedButta** (7): Fun! The vocal performance is great, although the verses could use some more oomph on the instrumental

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): i think Prince should have done salsa or bachata or tangos based on these lyrics

**emayzee** (7): musically this sounds like something that would play in the intro to an outdated 80s sex ed video they'd play us in middle school health class

**homestarguy** (7): A classic, but prefer the version on Sign 'O' The Times

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): For some reason this rate‚Äôs Spotify playlist uses the original 1979 demo and not the one that‚Äôs actually from 1987 (which is what I based my score on). Pretty cool song though!

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): noooo Prince don't take the place of my man your to sexy haha

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): kinda tacky on relisten tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): Prince being continually robbed in ph rates is tragic (but this song isn't that great tbh)

#homewrecked

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the ballad of dorothy parker >>

**NotWith10000Men** (6): of all the prince songs...

**plastichaxan** (6): there‚Äôs definitely a lot of interesting elements but i do not remember this song very much and also it drags a lot

**Uberpigeon** (6): fun fact or maybe a crime i have never heard a prince song before this

**vayyiqra** (6): Why does this Prince song sound nothing like a Prince song :thinking:

**wavingwolves** (5.5): this is kind of sapphic coded if you look into it

**camerinian** (5): Another rate, another reminder that Prince never clicking with me is maybe my biggest failing as a music fan

**Stryxen** (5): it starts and ends and i listen to it!

**terrencelovescum** (5): this type of upbeat rock music just irritates my soul.

**jaztinax** (4.5): idk THAT much about prince but this is the most un-prince prince song i‚Äôve ever heard

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): this sounds really corny sorry

**mudkip1** (3): hmm I‚Äôve liked other prince songs much more than this

**nicolas<3** (2): fuck old people

**jman457** (0): Sorry Prince but this just sounds like a bad Heartland rock cover

#grieving in stereo

**bridgemoney** (11): A dark, brooding, synthy masterpiece. "I grieve in stereo/The stereo sounds strange" is probably one of my favorite lyrics ever of the last five years. Great return to form for MGMT and I hope they keep this sound into their next album.

**2dina3dworld** (10): MGMT is good, don‚Äôt deny it.

**bbfan132** (10): apparently mgmt is polarizing in the ratesphere‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs hope that doesn‚Äôt happen here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPbVRpRgHso

**bo\_g\_o** (10): spooky banger

**cremeebrulee** (10): mgmt is such a random ass act for half the discord echo chamber to be an anti of

**frogaranaman** (10): this was supposed to be YOASOBI

**homestarguy** (10): The sound of Oracular Spectacular all grown up. Dark ominous verses, lead to the most infectious synth groove they've ever done.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): fuck the haters it bops

**jman457** (10): This is pop perfection, sorry not sorry

**just\_thonking** (10): MGMT stands for Making Great Music, Thanks!

**moonagenightmares** (10): we will rate a mgmt album one day.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): vote 2018 indie pop please dear god

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): brilliant, mgmt antis are so ugly

**akanewasright** (9.5): idk why y‚Äôall are hating on this, you can shake tits to it

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I DID used to hang around scene kids, how did you know

**emayzee** (9.5): a tik tok hit nearly 15 years after their other biggest hits, which is difficult to get not everyone has that

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): me being partially responsible for voting this in on‚Äôy to not give it a full 10 LOL

**BasedButta** (9): they have cool sounds and they use them very well. VERY refreshing - this sort of song has a common pitfall of letting the unconventional sounds/synths do all the carrying. thank you for minding your step *salutes

**skargardin** (9): I think im still sleeping on this album a bit

**Stryxen** (9): fuck mgmt omg vote 2018 indie pop so we can shit on little dark age again

**waluigiest** (9): this song is bizarre and I definitely didn‚Äôt click with it in the original rate. Now I see this understated gem

**camerinian** (8.5): I think I get this song now. It took a long time but I do feel the paranoid, wary vibe of a bop.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.5): Tbh I kinda get bored by the end of it

**CarlieScion** (8): i wanna give this lower bc i want mgmt stans to suffer but i simply ,,,, cant

**IIIHenryIII** (8): TikTok kids have some taste after all. There‚Äôs still hope.

**iniekcja\_** (8): oh I remember I liked it a long time ago

**TragicKingdom1** (8): not a bad song but if this does better than any of my 10s im delaying 2018 indie pop another year

**vayyiqra** (8): MGMT hate must end! They are valid! Not going to lie they have better songs than this though.

**welcome2thejam** (8): The urge to get mad at MGMT winning things vs. The realization that song is actually pretty sick

**trixiematthell** (7.6): was this a tiktok song? oh yeah its from the tiktok rate

**anothertown** (7.5): seize the means of production

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): enough MGMT

**slimboyfriend** (7.3): honestly the weird version on tiktok is better than this one

**runaway3212** (7): I wish I was an indieheads so I could appreciate this type of song

**SinfulAnarchy** (6.5): Always felt somewhat underwhelmed by this, the distorted vocals and abrasive synths are unpleasant to listen to. Tbh MGMT has way better songs than this

#r/take_it_to_indieheads

**1998tweety** (6): not the rematch between this and On The Floor...y'all better get it right this time i stg

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6): i like the dark undertone to this one

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): gonna tell my children this is Depeche Mode

**Lach#6922** (5): I know this is the whole point of this category but this was ruined by tik tok :sob:

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): meh but cool mv

**Awkward\_King** (4): i think if it werent for having to listen to it ro rate it i'd think this and heat waves were the same song

**Roxieloxie** (4): i hate this

**AHSWeeknd** (3): well

**NotWith10000Men** (3): chorus is okayish but the rest is so one note

**UselessTacooo** (3): disliked it on TikTok, dislike it here

**TiltControls** (2.5): MGMT deserved what it got in IH and not what it got here - sorry

**xearomis** (2): MGMT has good songs but this is just kinda boring

**plastichaxan** (1): mgmt my mortal enemies

**terrencelovescum** (1): the trad anthem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i hate mgmt and also this got in over yoru ni kakeru so i hate everyone who voted this in as well

This song is so... noisy. But like, noisy (compliment). I didn't like Poppy's album much when we rated it, but listening to the playlist, this song grew on me a lot- but I believe it's a bit abrasive for the general popheads audience, which is the metric for this rate.

---

#PLAYING NICE

**hikkaru** (11): omfg. this is gonna flop so hard but it's my favourite song in this rate for sure. the NOISES i fucking died

**2dina3dworld** (10): a wonderful song off of a terrible album

**AHSWeeknd** (10): You‚Äôve heard about Bloodmoney but how about bloodcoins? Coins are technically money so that doesn‚Äôt make sense.. how about bloodbitcoin?

**akanewasright** (10): This song should have won the rate I hate you all

**anothertown** (10): so true

**bbfan132** (10): fucking banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes, I listen to metal.

**GapeCod** (10): How the fuck did I Disagree beat this..

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she absolutely ate

**MrMoodle** (10): pretty much the only consistent way i can make my brain release dopamine nowadays is this loud crunchy bullshit my brain is broken

**plastichaxan** (10): this is such a nice song to scream along to

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I‚Äôm Poppy

**qazz23** (10): Mix of pop and metal is good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): my eardrums are bleeding and I'm smiling

**skargardin** (10): BEG FOR FORGIVENESS FROM JESUS THE CHRIST

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): this is so cathartic

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is my guilty pleasure

**throwaway-7650** (10): this went from being a weak 10 in DAP to a near-11

**UselessTacooo** (10): The big bop banger of I Disagree. Hot take: it deserved to outlast the title track

**wavingwolves** (10): this makes me want to stick my earbud in my asshole so i can hear her screams reverberating inside it

**thedoctordances1940** (9.7): i don't get how she went from this to whatever that last album was

**bo\_g\_o** (9): for the longest time I thought poppy was saying "from Jesus to Christ" in this song instead of "from Jesus THE Christ"

**IIIHenryIII** (9): is this hyperpoppy?

**jasannn** (9): I always think its just another loud track that I overrated until I hear that amazing guitar solo.

**TiltControls** (9): of the 10s on the album this is the least 10 so it drops a bit, but I was so pleasantly surprised with this album. Concrete & I Disagree are still on heavy rotation for me

**BasedButta** (8): whooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**IdiotBox01** (8): wasn‚Äôt into the first half of the song but once the guitar hits i was in fact in

**runaway3212** (8): uwu what if your were to sell my kidneys? Just kidding‚Ä¶ unless??!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): Thanks Poppy for helping me realize that I don‚Äôt hate metal, I hate metal by men :)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this goes hard but I‚Äôm not in love with it

**jman457** (7.5): This was a highlight on an album I just couldnt get into

**seanderlust** (7.5): I believe that when nobody is watching the raspberries in my fridge roll out of their containers, sneak outside and gather as much moisture as they can and then hide in a cramped dark space and sneak back in before they're caught and that's how they get so moldy so quickly. thank you for asking

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): the lyrics are so bad but when the guitar solo detonates i pretend they don't exist

**NotWith10000Men** (7.3): this isn't a song i should like but for some reason i'm very into everything that's going on here

**trixiematthell** (7.2): my favourite performance artist

**homestarguy** (7): Typically heavy stuff from Poppy. As is the case with a lot of her music, there is a balance between abrasive and catchy. This one leans a bit toward the former for me a bit to much for a higher score, but still enjoy this one.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): the absolute whiplash this gave me after the last 2 songs

**welcome2thejam** (7): Jesus Christ, that's Jesus the Christ

#BEG FOR FORGIVENESS TO JESUS H. CHRIST

**1998tweety** (6): i prefer her old sound

**camerinian** (6): I don't know if I love the intensity or if it comes off as super tryhard. Ask me again if this comes up in another redux rate

**waluigiest** (6): quirky

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): eh

**bridgemoney** (4.9): Jesus the Christ those are some lyrics.

**Roxieloxie** (4.3): you can maybe make me like her but not with this song

**fadedblue09** (4): erm okay

**moonagenightmares** (4): that amazing guitar solo singlehandedly saved this from being a 1

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this entire album sounds like if you asked someone who hates babymetal to make a babymetal song

**Alumineous** (1): And I thought Bjork couldn't be beat. Yeah, this was just not pleasant to listen to.

**xearomis** (1): Nothing about the song appeals to me, not the instrumental, not the screechy vocals, not the repeated lyrics. I guess metal just ain‚Äôt for me

**cremeebrulee** (0): i don't think poppy's approach to metal is for me. her screaming just sounds unpleasant and especially over more abrasive production like this, it just gives me a headache. DAP was the first time i listened to i disagree in full, so i was a little more generous with her scores there but i think i can safely say now that i don't wish to revisit this again. and in a lineup like this, it's easily my least favorite song

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (0): While I can try to appreciate the metal/dubstep influences here, the production on this is so grating that I have a tough time getting through it; just not for me I guess

**vayyiqra** (0): You might think this 0 is out of spite for Poppy winning this rate. It's not, because I rated it very low in the original rate. I like Poppy's older music but will never get the appeal of this album. Oh well.

#dressed like a daydream

**1998tweety** (10): lana washed

**2dina3dworld** (10): Taylor is such a stale topic and I‚Äôm as sick of her being everywhere as everyone else, but don‚Äôt lie to yourselves. This is a wonderful song, ethereal and classic with a teasing sort of romance. Taylor can sometimes go straight for the heart, but her lyricism in this is vague enough for the listener to self insert themselves into the song while also giving just enough detail for them to be able to put themselves in Taylor‚Äôs shoes if they so desire. And p.s. this is not dreampop, stream Heaven or Las Vegas

**AHSWeeknd** (10): (Taylor‚Äôs Version)

**bo\_g\_o** (10): can't wait to see this get eliminated mid day 2

**CritneySpearz** (10): her best wbk

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of her best songs and music videos

**hikkaru** (10): taylor antis tanking this and august omg corny lame boooo tomato tomato tomato

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I miss those drums from the music video so bad

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen of horse girls

**nicolas<3** (10): pls give us 1989 taylors version u blonde bitch

**runaway3212** (10): Taylor‚Äôs version is better I said what I said

**TiltControls** (10): so so close to nabbing the 11. It's going to hurt when people give this 0s and 1s even if they are right for it

**vayyiqra** (10): I love Lana Del Rey album Born to Die

**waluigiest** (10): one of my favorite songs from her. It‚Äôs just lush and dark and sultry in a really compelling way. I think the fuller voice and more balanced production on the re-record only help it.

**wavingwolves** (10): YOU SEE ME IN HINDSIGHT üíã TANGLED UP WITH YOU ALL NIGHT üíãBURNINGüíã IT üíãDOWNüíã

**NotWith10000Men** (9.7): before i got to this song i was like 'nah i'm not gonna rate it super high, it's not THAT good' but no, it is

**thedoctordances1940** (9.7): :catcry:

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this is a grower and definitely like the 3rd best song on the album

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): horse movie

**BasedButta** (9): i cant help but cringe at some of the lyrics but SONG GOOD!

**cherryices** (9): my apologies tay but this is the better version

**jsonphile** (9): is this that horse song

**rslashpoopheads** (9): this song is so dreamy

**trixiematthell** (8.8): I mean this is THE song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.7): I assume we're rating the original and not the automatically superior Taylor's Version which I would've given a solid 9

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): Unfortunately good

**camerinian** (8): Not putting the Taylor's Version on the playlist is literal violence

**Uberpigeon** (8): horsefukcekr

**jman457** (7.8): Sure its a Lana rip off, but its a good one

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): she put most of her swussy into this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.7): This bridge deserves to be displayed at the very front of the Taylor Swift Bridges Museum

**bbfan132** (7.5): sorry but not one of my favorites on 1989

**akanewasright** (7): colonialism but make it pretty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Shake It Off low-key a better song than this.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): was chris evans not available for the mv shooting?

**Stryxen** (7): an old favourite that i don't love anymore

#harry styles (this song is about him right idr)

**flavasavavandal** (6): Literally at the border between filler and not filler but still boring

**frogaranaman** (5): what in the gentrified Animal Kingdom

**homestarguy** (5): Look, I'm not a Swiftie, though I like a lot of her songs. But this is her at her most insufferable to me. But...gotta respect the earnestness of this one.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Sorry but until you finally give us (Taylor's Drums from the MV Added In Version) I can't fully endorse this

**kappyko** (4): ive hated this forever

**Roxieloxie** (4): i hate this

**anothertown** (3): is this city pop?

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): her lana cosplay aged like milk as did most of 1989 tbh

**apatel27** (2): It's so goddamn boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this song is boring as hell and also its by taylor swift

**Awkward\_King** (1): this song feels so full of air but not in a "wow this is so freeing and floaty" way but in a "there's so much air and none of it is oxygen and it feels suffocating" way, id rather be listening to bad blood

**IdiotBox01** (1): never has a fanbase turned me off so hard to someone's music, all i hear is swifties screaming at me about Jake Gyllenhaal or some shit

**plastichaxan** (1): okay yeah this does not deserve the 0 over august i lied

**sweetnsaursauce11** (0): one of my least favourite taylor songs i hate it

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): it‚Äôs so baaad and boring as heeeell

And with that, we say goodbye to Break-Up Pop Rock! I don't think anyone expected this to be the first rate out, and I certainly didn't either! But- give it its revenge by giving Midnight Sky your 0s!

#sex

**akanewasright** (10): I HATE YOU JOHN MAYER!!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This would be my favorite song with this title if it weren‚Äôt for main pop girl Rob Thomas.

**CarlieScion** (10): still sad this lost bc yall r manphobic

**emayzee** (10): this song had me FLOORED when it came out and still does. it's the music i've always wanted halsey to make

**GapeCod** (10): Roxie rights

**hikkaru** (10): i personally wanted ysbs or SUGAR ON THE RIM but i'll deal this song still slaps

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): i love this song but ever since i saw someone say it sounds like it belongs in a hilary duff 2000s movie i can't unhear it

**TiltControls** (10): I still hate the outro, but I already took out my pettiness on it in BUPR. also this is the superior version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE23G_p2eKM

**UselessTacooo** (10): The fact this didn‚Äôt win BUPR is abysmal

**wavingwolves** (10): ended 3am by haim but only i can say this because i hosted the pitchfork acclaim rate

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.7): the voicemail at the end should‚Äôve been its own interlude but hey this still fuckin bangs

**NotWith10000Men** (9.6): minus half a point for john mayer lmao

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): what is it with songs called 3am being bangers

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it‚Äôs 9 PM, and I‚Äôm struggling to send All Stars on my phone

**1998tweety** (9): minus 1 point for the outro

**bridgemoney** (9): Probably hits harder with a Krabby Patty.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): What is it about 3am that‚Äôs so evocative for people? This is the third song I‚Äôve heard about it

**throwaway-7650** (9): we wanted you should be sad ~~or a plastic hearts song~~

**camerinian** (8.5): Ok what the fuck happened to Halsey while I wasn't looking, both her songs in this rate and her songs in the top 100 all fucking slap and I had no idea she got so good

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A good palate cleanser after the terrible Nightmare

**homestarguy** (8.5): A song that Michelle Branch or Avril Lavigne would have killed to have recorded back in '03, and that's the ultimate compliment I can give.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): it's really good but i'm not sure i was right to 11 this in the rate, it's not that amazing

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.4): Such a banger, and definitely one of the best songs on Manic

**trixiematthell** (8.2): she‚Äôs dipping her toe in the rock waters and it‚Äôs so good

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): Putting aside my irrational distaste for Halsey, this is like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Good

**anothertown** (8): its giving phair

**static\_int\_husp** (8): once again docking points for the John Mayer outro

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I like this a lot but it‚Äôs also a bit underwhelming idk why

**shhhneak** (7.8): This song feels like a memory from a past life. I used to be a barista and would hear this while I baked every morning‚Äîfairly close to 3am actually.

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): and I must be lonely

**BasedButta** (7): not into the vocals but its a solid song

**frogaranaman** (7): e-sex anthem

**IIIHenryIII** (7): la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): this lowkey sounds country, and it‚Äôs very basic and middling

**skargardin** (7): Not my favourite on Manic tbh

**vayyiqra** (7): Another "2000s-sounding alt-pop song where the chorus is Halsey Shouting Stuff" (positive)

**waluigiest** (7): why did you call me? my Do Not Disturb is literally on.

**majid** (6.5): slay

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): omg she's subtweeting BTS!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the outro at the end of this makes me laugh bc its like ‚Äúyour best song is your biggest one‚Äù like no‚Ä¶without me sucks ass bro

**jman457** (6.3): An alright pop rock tune

#insomnia

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Atticus and Trent really enhanced Halsey‚Äôs rock ability.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): more like 6am

**nicolas<3** (6): ???? girl what

**sufjancaesar** (6): Didn‚Äôt hate this as much as Nightmare!

**just\_thonking** (5.5): this sounds kind of country?

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): I don‚Äôt care for this song but I‚Äôm always surprised by how much I like it when I re listen to it?

**bbfan132** (4.5): boring, sorry

**Uberpigeon** (3): im not gonna say it

**Awkward\_King** (1): this song annoys me bc musically its kinda a bop but the lyrics feel like classic halsey (derogatory) and its not like the boppy parts i cant find in other (better) songs

**plastichaxan** (1): more like 1am i‚Äôm so funny haha

**runaway3212** (0): I do not get why people like this it sounds like bebe rexha doing a bad halsey impression

**GapeCod** (10.000): üò≠ when this rate was announced I went full :audience: mode because I have only heard Miley's album and I found it off-putting at best, but now that she's not in this rate the three songs are getting the perfect average as they should, lmao. Fuck Midnight Sky though, easiest 0 in winners rate.

**hikkaru** (10.000): omg it's me..... we hate miley

**RandomHypnotica** (9.133): miley winning was truly my villain origin story

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): I regret NOTHING about being a plastic hearts stan

**cremeebrulee** (7.900): dumb fact but i was at a wedding when this reveal was happening and on day 3, i unplugged some decorations so i could use the outlet to charge my phone so i could read the reddit thread... all so i could watch hayley lose üò≠

**TiltControls** (7.833): funny I could go from destroying Halsey album in a rate (HFK) to being gutted when pretty much any track left. also hikk did such a good job hosting here!

**vayyiqra** (7.333): This rate is a blur. I think it went well? I couldn't even remember who else was in it.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.333): Why‚Äôd y‚Äôall keep Miley off this?? üò≠ Perhaps because Miley won and people couldn‚Äôt handle it üòå

**Uberpigeon** (6.333): i wish i had done this rate to boost hayley but i deleted my ballot and i didnt want to have to listen to halsey again

**plastichaxan** (5.833): this was such a weird rate that in retrospect i also did not enjoy and was too nice to everything but oh well it did have bops

**fadedblue09** (5.500): Wanted to root for Hayley but I didn't like PFA that much and I harbor some...emotions towards the other 2 so I just skipped it altogether

**runaway3212** (5.333): midnight sky is good fuck y‚Äôall

#venus as a song

**nicolas<3** (11): oh my god girl queen you look so vagina slay tonight..... pop off pussy hat

**2dina3dworld** (10): I remember reading a comment, I think it was either while back reading the original rate or while talking in the discord server, that talked about how the traits Bj√∂rk romanticises in this Venus boy are all ones associated with femininity. The idea of a boy being gentle, idealistic, and a giving lover is one that‚Äôs not that present in a lot of cultures, and Bj√∂rk really plays with that to present that sometimes straight men can be submissive and breedable. It‚Äôs a cute song as well, so that helped me to decide on giving it a 10

**bbfan132** (10): the video for this song <3

**homestarguy** (10): I love Bj√∂rk so much. The instrumental is so hypnotic, and her vocals are so achingly expressive. One of the most beautiful songs she ever recorded.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I WANT A PRETTY BOY TOO

**iniekcja\_** (10): kind of craving eggs now

**nt96** (10): Never cared to listen closely to the lyrics till recently. Very naughty Bjork.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I am SICK of the bjorkphobia in rates!!!

**runaway3212** (10): venus is such an icon honestly the best greek god

**skargardin** (10): megabop

**Stryxen** (10): venus as a bop!

**UselessTacooo** (10): yass bjonk slay the house boots down or whatever

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the most painful truths I have had to confront about music in the 2020s is that Debut does not get the respect it deserves. Masterpiece! Idc what you say, it's in her top 4 albums at least.

**waluigiest** (10): the fake icelandic‚Ä¶. not bj√∂rk being quirky i-

**akanewasright** (9.5): If I was bjork, I too would talk about how hot a man was, knowing no one could understand my unhinged thirst musings

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): still soooo dreamy aaahhh

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): she spilled

**jman457** (9.3): The sexuality this song exhudes

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): In the original rate I said this sounded like background music from a Neopets game and I was right of course, but I now realize that that was a compliment

**Roxieloxie** (9): i like this i cant lie

**BasedButta** (8.5): something about this makes me vibe so hard‚Ä¶ he believes in a beauty‚Ä¶

**camerinian** (8.5): wtf Bjork predicted Timothee Chalamet

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This song has grown on me, and I love Bjork!

**trixiematthell** (7.1): seems like a song my mum would try to sing

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Interesting

**bigbigbee** (7): I also often cook only butter and then immediately wash the pan

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Can‚Äôt wait for Uranus as a girl.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the problem with having a distinct sound is that all of your songs sound the same, that's how I feel about Bj√∂rk's music in general. Nevertheless, this is enjoyable

**jsonphile** (7): my brain is too small to understand Bj√∂rk I apologize for my inferiority

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ok but why is the music video just a clip of her making eggs

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.7): I think I like reading the song‚Äôs lyrics more than actually listening to it

#narcissus outsold

**GapeCod** (6): Debut results were all over the place, and this song placing the highest is further proof of that... One of her most overrated tracks tbh.

**hikkaru** (6): i have riddle.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): you've been Bj√∂rked

**SinfulAnarchy** (6): i‚Äôm convinced people who listen to art pop only do so because it‚Äôs ‚Äòintellectual‚Äô and gives them a superiority complex bc this is boring + sounds like halsey doing christmas music

**wavingwolves** (6): wonder what bork does after you solve her riddle

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): i have never listened to her before and I hear how lido is influenced by her now. Interesting.

**jasannn** (5): i cant stand her voice

**TiltControls** (5): when we're bjorking and flopping we're bjopping

**shhhneak** (4.5): The answer to Bjork‚Äôs riddle is getting eliminated on day one.

**Awkward\_King** (4): bork

**jaztinax** (4): i kinda get it but i also don‚Äôt get it

**Alumineous** (3): Weird. Just weird. Like, her voice. When she wails, it doesn't sound good. Instrumentation is okay.

**moonagenightmares** (3): i do not like her voice + annoying clangs in the instrumental + too long for a boring song

**sweetnsaursauce11** (3): it's not for me

**TragicKingdom1** (3): this lacks substance but i do appreciate how its about a twink

**xearomis** (3): I have no idea what she‚Äôs singing half the time

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Shygirl is going to take over the world she is just waiting for the right time to strike (but she's taking her time alright‚Ä¶)

**seanderlust** (10): I listened to this song so much after the 2020 EP Rate that Spotify started playing it automatically at the end of albums/playlists because it assumed I wanted to hear it. and you know what? it was usually right

**nicolas<3** (9): that hook ATE and left no crumbs

**runaway3212** (7): who cares at this point this slays

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6.6): the cover art scares me

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): a decent song that could grow on me if i weren‚Äôt so repulsed by the album art that I can‚Äôt stand to listen to the EP

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.5): i'm a bad bitch

#abstinence

**cremeebrulee** (6): this is not the girl that FREAK is

**frogaranaman** (6): do you think Shygirl follows slime accounts on Instagram

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Freak ended

**vayyiqra** (6): While I've been jumpscared so many times by the cover for this EP that my instinctive reaction is to tank this (I have this niche phobia, I swear it's not my fault), I'm trying to be fair here. I wish this project had different aesthetics so I could enjoy it more.

**jsonphile** (5.5): the album cover is giving me anxiety

**NotWith10000Men** (4.4): she's for the streets bitch

**1998tweety** (2): i do not like this unfortunately

**BasedButta** (1): oh how i wanted to skip this. at least you get a free ear massage at the end

**TiltControls** (1): tbh I wasn't really a fan of the EP when we rated it in the EP rate and compared against even tougher competition it's even harder to enjoy

**musical\_pyn** (0): I hated this song when I first heard it but I've gotten more into shygirl since then and‚Ä¶still hate it sorry, the entire song isn't awful but there are too many details that make this song not just bad but unlistenable for me

**emayzee** (10): this song was the one good thing about being 13

**GapeCod** (10): The only song Pitbull should have ever released tbh.

**hikkaru** (10): CLASSIC. never fails to get me hype asf

**ignitethephoenix** (10): so glad this was voted in, honestly this song is amazing and is probably my fave pitbull song. Also stan Ne-Yo

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Excuse me, this deserves a full score

**ImADudeDuh** (10): idk why but I always have the Key of Awesome parody lyrics where the female singer (who I thought was JLo until like 2015) sings ‚Äúi am whispering, because i can‚Äôt sing‚Äù in my head whenever her part comes on

**letsallpoo** (10): very excited to see this do better than fiona apple

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): remembering when my older brother used to be obsessed with this song and would listen to it 24/7 on his shitty orange (brand, not colour) phone omfg the memories

**MrMoodle** (10): if you guys rob this then you are absolutely fucking LYING when you say you want the era of early 2010s party music back you fucks, PEAK trashy club music

**nicolas<3** (10): middle school me is screaming rn

**Roxieloxie** (10): they're right!!!

**runaway3212** (10): why does this title kinda sound like a robbery

**skargardin** (10): the nostalgia is SO strong here ugh

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): the absolute grip this song had on all the 16th birthday parties i went to in 2011

**TiltControls** (10): pitbull come back we need you to release a hit and fix all the worlds problems right now

**vayyiqra** (10): Just remembered again I've been pronouncing "Ne-Yo" wrong in my head for almost 20 years. Anyway, peak loud EDM club banger.

**wavingwolves** (10): GRAB SOMEBODY SEXY AND TELL THEM HEY!!!!!!! GIVE 10s TO THIS TONIGHT!!!!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): pitbull took ten years off my life, i forgot this song started with rhyming kodak with kodak. the longer i listened to this the higher and higher my score went. it's just SO well made

**anothertown** (9): you want to talk about CINEMATIC??

**bbfan132** (9): a modern classic, that hook is gold

**sufjancaesar** (9): Cringe-inducing (complimentary)

**veryanniev** (9): I should have so many memories of this song from my teenage years yet all of them are eclipsed by that fucking hillywood show breaking dawn parody when jacob was wilding out

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.8): God the hook/chorus is so beautiful not even the extended presence of the Kodak-loving Mr. Worldwide can ruin its epicness

**BasedButta** (8.5): this song is so funny + bald man swag + dont speak ill of cuba ever again

**bigbigbee** (8.5): 2010s pop rap made us want to live in the nighttime, under the city streetlights, in a haze of the steam from the vents and the smoke from the local restaurants

**homestarguy** (8.5): This one still holds up. The build-up, the chorus with its sick-as-hell beat, and....Pitbull. He's doing his best.

**jasannn** (8.5): This was only an 11 in terms of that rate.

**jaztinax** (8.5): am i the only one who thinks the beginning of the chorus is a little off-pitch?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Ne-Yo's hooks are probably the best, catchiest and most recognizable parts of this song outside of that Kodak line. Dale.

**frogaranaman** (8): dale.

**iniekcja\_** (8): oh god the nostalgia

**rslashpoopheads** (8): we need Ne-Yo and Pitbull to be popular again

**trixiematthell** (7.9): i might drink a little more than i should tonight

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): the one good pitbull song

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): why is this better than fourth grade me remembers‚Ä¶ the beat in the chorus is good, and the lyrics are iconic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It‚Äôs a good song but the Kodak lyric alone takes off like 2 solid points.

**mudkip1** (7): I love everything about this song except for the drop. What happened?!??! And why did we all think it used to be good?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): kodak

**waluigiest** (7): summer 2011 this was the most overplayed song I‚Äôve ever experienced

**CritneySpearz** (6.5): pitch perfect outsold (unironically)

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is nostalgic for me but every time i listen it feels more boring and repetitive

#excuse me.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): I wish Pitbull wasn‚Äôt an anti lockdown weirdo

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I checked the comments for this song in the original rate (which I didn‚Äôt do due to time constraints) and no one mentioned the incredibly tacky Lindsay Lohan reference? Hm.

**seanderlust** (5.7): don't be shy nadia oh, you can speak up a bit

**jsonphile** (5.5): is this a good song ruined by the fact that Pitbull rhymes ‚ÄúKodak‚Äù with ‚ÄúKodak‚Äù, or is this a terrible song redeemed by the fact that Pitbull rhymes ‚ÄúKodak‚Äù with ‚ÄúKodak‚Äù? The answer: yes

**cremeebrulee** (5): not pitbull's best if we're being honest

**camerinian** (4): I wish I could make bank in my life as lazily as Pitbull cashed in that Kodak plug

**UselessTacooo** (4): a victim of overplaying

**jman457** (3.5): I still have trauma from how massively overplayed song this was

**apatel27** (3): Just that first line

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): gives me almost nothing

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): I had like 5 different ideas for this comment that memed the lyrics and I can't choose between them (picture that with a Kodak)

**Awkward\_King** (2): if i was doing this rate drunk id be so much nicer

**welcome2thejam** (2): I understand why it works for people, but this is such a weak sounding track and the other Pitbull/Ne-Yo major party hit absolutely bulldozes it

**IdiotBox01** (1): this just makes me think of Waiting for Tonight which is a song I actually like

**Uberpigeon** (1): whats the opposite of nostalgia

**qazz23** (0): really don't like the vocals on this

Ariana run pop- but not here! I was scared for how the re-rate songs would do in this context, but I probably shouldn't have been- sorry ricki! 

---

#what is she touching

**sweetnsaursauce11** (11): SORRY if it's a basic as fuck choice for my 11 but it's my most listened to song out of all of these so it's FITTING. also those notes in the outro are DESERVING

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It‚Äôs been over 5 years but I‚Äôm still not sure what she exactly wanted to be touched.

**anothertown** (10): https://twitter.com/allreactionvidz/status/1145236402071834624

**bo\_g\_o** (10): oh yeah

**hikkaru** (10): OMFG. ariana tasteless etc etc

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I‚Äôve been in love with this one since the Anniversary Rate. One of the best pop songs ever, I‚Äôm not kidding.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): y‚Äôall did this album dirty in the rerate

**musical\_pyn** (10): oh look it's the best ariana song!

**vayyiqra** (10): We underrated this in the original rate and will make up for it here ... right?

**xearomis** (10): I‚Äôve never actually heard this before but it‚Äôs good, like real good

**BasedButta** (9.5): pretty fkn good

**homestarguy** (9.5): I mean, uh, it's pretty clear what Ariana wants on this one. My god that chorus.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): not my favorite Ariana track but it‚Äôs still solid

**Awkward\_King** (9): this is literally one of the best songs in this rate

**iniekcja\_** (9): when I tell you my my young and uncultured ass was stanning

**rslashpoopheads** (9): yes ma'am!

**runaway3212** (9): this grew on me a lot

**seanderlust** (9): i can't help it. i hear this, i start levitating. when she hits that long note on "fall in love"??? bliss. would have been an 11 if we were in our gamer bag and submitted the ff remix

**wavingwolves** (9): TOUCH IT üíã TOUCH IT üíã TOUCH IT üíã

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): they was she hates this song... mento ilnes

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): those whistle notes‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm ascending

**emayzee** (8.2): this is so mid 2010s

**trixiematthell** (8.1): how have i never heard this before?

**Alumineous** (8): Overproduced and lifeless. But VOCALS.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): That fact that both this and Greedy weren‚Äôt singles‚Ä¶it‚Äôs sad.

**just\_thonking** (8): I'm going to touch it

**NotWith10000Men** (8): damn i don't think i've heard this one since the first time i listened to dangerous woman. it's REALLY good

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.8): her voice man

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): the way Ariana would probably rather any other song be her all-star but we said no we want the generic bop anyway

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.6): I don‚Äôt really get the hype around this‚Ä¶ I mean it sounds fine but not amazing

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): *Dangerous Woman* has somehow become underrated with time but personally this is a piece of it that I find rather overrated. The melody is gorgeous but the production is so messy, it‚Äôs just a lot of electronic noise‚Ä¶ the Final Fantasy Remix does fix that a bit but we aren‚Äôt rating that version.

**nt96** (7): No thanks, I'm good

**pijus41** (7): It's cute, but it's no Touch It (Final Fantasy version)

**skargardin** (7): Honestly I don't completely get the love for this

**UselessTacooo** (7): I want to love it, but it‚Äôs just missing‚Ä¶ something? It has everything it should, but it lacks originality

**waluigiest** (7): I agree with Ariana about this one

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): tbh this is starting to fatigue on me

**jman457** (6.6): slaps a bit but I think the final fantasy version is better

**akanewasright** (6.5): :| grew off me

**bbfan132** (6.5): i should probably like this more than i do but alas

**DefaultPophead** (6.5): My least favourite Madison Beer song.

**sufjancaesar** (6.5): Can‚Äôt lie this is v boring to me and the chorus is very pop/popheads 101‚Ä¶.Sometimes (and others) robbed

**bridgemoney** (6): Can't believe I like the song whose music video features rocket powered tits over this.

**camerinian** (6): this feels incredibly dated and it's only been like 5 years

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): but the final fantasy remix is a 10

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): easily one of the most overrated songs in ari's discography

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why is this so beloved teabh

**mudkip1** (5): why are we not rating into you for the 8th time

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): this could be good but it sounds so gritty

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): why though

**TiltControls** (3): this was the correct choice for a host pick from rerate but also it's just grown off me too much to enjoy now

**majid** (0): what the

**Stryxen** (0): in the rerate i said ‚Äú2 it‚Äôs not awful but it really is forgettable and just not good‚Äù but i lied it is awful. the production is so horrible my ears hurt listening to this

why do they walk so much i dont get it

---

#Jill Scott - A Long Walk

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): INVENTED walking.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): God I love this album so much and I really love how cool yet passionate this song is

**homestarguy** (10): So wonderful. HAIM nailed their 70's-soft-rock-meets-10's-pop sound they've been crafting for years here. Love how the words of the chorus just melt into song.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): these drums can bring one back from the dead

**runaway3212** (10): Haim is like Chloe X Halle if they were the national

**shhhneak** (10): Getting war flashbacks from this rate and how oppressed HAIM stans were.

**Stryxen** (10): one of my favourite songs of all time - would probably be my 11 but i wanna give it to a song i haven‚Äôt 11d yet lol

**TiltControls** (10): One of the many 10s on the album. Justice for Now I'm In It and Don't Wanna, but this is still an easy 10

**wavingwolves** (10): i love the way this is called the steps and features one of the few music videos they do no walking ahh just a bunch of queens of shaking things up, breaking the mold and doing the unexpected

**trixiematthell** (9.1): makes me feel like a bad bitch

**bbfan132** (9): very catchy and fun to listen to

**bridgemoney** (9): Yeah I like Fleetwood Mac.

**skargardin** (9): bop

**welcome2thejam** (9): The guitars sound incredible

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): i love how sunny it sounds

**iniekcja\_** (8): just remembered the time I was tasked to make a playlist with "walking up the stairs" as a central theme

**waluigiest** (8): the cast of licorice pizza popped off

**jman457** (7.6): a remarkably produced, groovy little track that is not my style at all.

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt think HAIM will ever make a song as good as The Wire

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): me when someone asks me what‚Äôs the alternative option to getting out of the london underground if they don‚Äôt want to use an escalator

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I don‚Äôt get it üò≠

**bigbigbee** (7): I always used to be surprised that this was the consensus favorite off of WIMPIII because I thought it was pleasant but not exciting, but in the ~9 months since I finished this rate this little ditty gets stuck in my head a lot, so I think I get it now

**camerinian** (7): God there was something so profoundly unsatisfying about that new HAIM album and I felt like the only one who didn't really vibe with it. This is one of the better tracks but the rough edges in the production and the kind of unresolved chorus just should work a lot better than it does

**IdiotBox01** (7): summer girl is vastly superior

**Lach#6922** (7): I like the high pitched guitars in the beginning and at some other parts because it reminds me of Follow Me by Uncle Kracker

**musical\_pyn** (7): for some reason the opening snare really bothers me now but the rest of the song is great!

**nicolas<3** (7): bopped my head a bit

**throwaway-7650** (7): we wanted now I'm in it... then I'd have a 10 average here

**vayyiqra** (7): Going to make the same joke as before haha "the steps" because Haim walk places get it. Anyway if I had never heard this before and you told me this was a country-pop song that was a hit on Canadian radio stations in the 90s, I would believe you.

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.7): she is catchy

**BasedButta** (6.5): drags on a bit. could be smaller and more packed, the foundation is good

**seanderlust** (6.5): every time I hear this I think it's I THINK by Tyler The Creator and then HAIM starts singing and I'm like "...oh." I mean, it's fine but you know

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.5): Uh it‚Äôs a little underwhelming?

#Walk The Moon - Shut Up And Dance

**Alumineous** (6): Ham.

**anothertown** (6): my sister plays this in her car all the time and I thought it was some chanteuse from the 70s, ?? come to look it up and it's the bront√´ sisters of literary fame.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): rock music is so ideal for montages

**rslashpoopheads** (6): aren't HAIM those siblings who did that tiktok with joe biden

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): its alright i guess, don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hyped up when it sounds like a song anyone could‚Äôve written

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): literally the worst song on the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Am I the only person who sees ‚ÄúHAIM‚Äù and instantly thinks ‚ÄúHA(w) I M(et Your Mother)?‚Äù

**akanewasright** (5): I gave this a much better score in p4k, but like‚Ä¶ there are a bunch of other songs from this album that I vastly prefer to this one. I haven‚Äôt come back to this one much at all, and when I have, I‚Äôve been put off by the vocal effects and production.

**flavasavavandal** (5): this is like 3 steps away from being a good song, mainly fixing whatever happened with the application of the reverb (I think it‚Äôs reverb at least) oh and the drumming have like literal 0 impact

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): now why is this not now im in it. THATS THE CLIT OF THE ALBUM!!!!!!1 NOT THIS!!!!

**cremeebrulee** (2): wimpiii is an album i really adore, but this is genuinely one of my least favorite songs on it. i find the guitar decent, but the lyrics (especially the bridge) and the delivery feel so lazy to me. if literally any other haim song from this album got sent, i would've had scored it better but this track doesn't do anything for me

**DefaultPophead** (1): There is only one song on this list that I don't like more than this one ("August"). I'd even prefer "Like A G6" over this song, and I thought that was certainly going to be my lowest score.

**nt96** (0): I'm sorry but I am NOT feeling this at ALL.

SO YOU DON'T LIKE HER WITH THE BEEPS AND THE BOOPS BUT WHEN SHE DOES NORMAL SOFT COUNTRY YOU DON'T LIKE HER EITHER

---

#Don't Delete The Kisses

**UselessTacooo** (11): I might go out on a limb here and say this is one of the best songs ever created. When this goes out on day 1 I will be disgusted but hopefully this 11 does something. Space Country needs to become its own genre!!!!

**vayyiqra** (11): Without trauma-dumping too much I am going to give this an 11 not just because it's Grimes and I love this song but because very few songs are as personal to me as this one is. :hanawinsCries:

**akanewasright** (10): This song should have won the rate I hate you all

**bo\_g\_o** (10): as bland as most of miss anthropocene is this song is stunning

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this sounds like early 2000s Avril going country in 3020

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the anger I have in my heart for the fact that Grimes released another song so good that I can't have as easy a time making fun of her like I want to

**jman457** (10): One of Grimes best songs, that really plays into her strengths

**moonagenightmares** (10): this whole album is just bangers idc idc

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she ate sorry

**MrMoodle** (10): i kinda wanna dock this a point just bc grimes but damn this pulls at the heartstrings

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if elon's musk stick helped you write songs like this, get back together with him rn

**Stryxen** (10): 46th place energy

**terrencelovescum** (10): joni mitchell should be scared of claire's pen here.

**throwaway-7650** (10): I hate to admit it but I did grimes dirty in DAP tbh

**TiltControls** (10): and here I thought I was a Grimes-anti. Something about this song though has a level of groundness that is just such a good fit for her and I wish she'd do stuff like this more often

**bbfan132** (9): country grimes is good!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I don‚Äôt want to give Grimes a high score but alas she made a great song.

**camerinian** (9): God it'd be so much easier to dunk on Grimes if she just stopped making great music

**emayzee** (9): perhaps X √Ü A-Xii's mom makes some points sometimes

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the way this is her most ‚Äònormal‚Äô song and it‚Äôs easily one of her best. I wish grimes did more like this

**rslashpoopheads** (9): me every time a company makes me download their shitty nonfunctional phone app just to access basic features of their product or service

**runaway3212** (9): me with my discord account

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): Grimes really went from this to doing abysmal anime rate promo?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Joanne made some points with this one

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i love country

**1998tweety** (8): me to this album

**anothertown** (8): the reason why this is the best song off of miss anthropocene is because it sounds like art angels. next

**bridgemoney** (8): I guess I really like songs that give off "end of movie credits" vibes.

**fadedblue09** (8): The idea of a Grimes ballad isnt bad as it seems surprisingly enough

**plastichaxan** (8): see i do like country music

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): i like how chill it is

**trixiematthell** (7.7): i am in love with the acoustic electric pop vibe

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): communist queen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): grimes is a class traitor but this song slaps unfortunately

**shhhneak** (7.3): Okay I can see why Azealia Banks was squatting in Elon‚Äôs mansion.

**apatel27** (7): a nice message but eh

**skargardin** (7): For better or for worse, this really sticks out on the album

**waluigiest** (7): - Hillary Clinton, 2016

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.6): Is she singing in a southern accent? That‚Äôs fucking hilarious

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.1): eh miss anthropologie hasnt really stuck with me

#Do Not Ask Again

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Grimes has made better songs ü§≠

**Awkward\_King** (6): it feels weird to describe a grimes song as actually vulnerable and honest bc grimes feels like a caricature of insanity, but this is still a really lovely song, the melody is so comforting, i just dont find it as memorable as a lot of her other songs

**BasedButta** (5.5): boooooooooooooring. sadly not bad enough so i could make a ‚Äúdelete THIS forever‚Äù joke

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): I would never be able to guess her speaking voice from any of her music

**NotWith10000Men** (4.8): tbh when i saw grimes, the last thing i expected was a guitar. unfortunately it's boring

**IdiotBox01** (4): i'm a big grimes fan but this song is lamesauce

vayyiqra: >anothertown (8): the reason why this is the best song off of miss anthropocene is because it sounds like art angels. next

sorry i'm having a hard time understanding what this means; i have heard all of *Art Angels* hundreds of times and there is nothing on it like a country ballad with banjo

there is acoustic guitar on a couple of songs i guess like "belly of the beat" so maybe that

but anyway this comment isn't the villain dw; everyone who gave it a score below 5 is on my shitlist for the day though

the reaction to this being the all stars pick still traumatizes me i swore i had accidentally put the wrong song in

---

#Sailor Moon

**apatel27** (10): Gods doing god stuff

**bbfan132** (10): i liked this when i first heard it but i‚Äôm loving it now!!! i hope it does reasonably well

**bo\_g\_o** (10): jazzy banger!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is sooo quirky [complimentary] and also dramatic how could you not love it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Two legends!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): So this was sort of a rogue pick for the rate, I don‚Äôt think it was at the top of anyone‚Äôs lists, but since it was the song that inspired me to create EAPR in the first place I figured it was as much an All Star as anything else; I also thought that this would make an interesting change of pace in the rate since it‚Äôs a very unique song in the popheads sphere thanks to its jazzier sound and the presence of alt-Jpop legend Sheena Ringo. It‚Äôs just so classy and full of DRAMA, I can‚Äôt help but feel a thrill every time their voices raise into that glorious climax.

**homestarguy** (10): What a pleasant surprise this one was. That angular jazzy piano, the cinematic brass and strings, all tied together with a snappy groove. Absolutely heavenly.

**iniekcja\_** (10): wait...

**MrMoodle** (10): i almost feel like this is too busy but idc it bangs like goddamn

**skargardin** (10): I truly wasn't ready for this omg

**sufjancaesar** (10): this is so good wtf

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): one of the best music videos i‚Äôve ever seen methinks

**wavingwolves** (9.1): very weird pick for all stars but it is a smash i guess

**1998tweety** (9): very nice

**AHSWeeknd** (9): it sounds oddly cinematic

**akanewasright** (9): *twerks in jazz*

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (9): really jazzy

**frogaranaman** (9): really beautiful duet

**waluigiest** (9): gen 7 was a bit of a flop in hindsight

**jman457** (8.9): Im obsessed with the piano in this. Its almost as if Regina spektor remixed with Kaytranada with a swing band

**BasedButta** (8.5): the parts where this blows up are great

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): ok yes to Mx. Hikaru wailing at the end

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): not one of my fave songs from the rate but still great

**runaway3212** (8): prefer the stars & the sky tbh

**shhhneak** (8): Move over Carly, we need the Utada Hikaru disco album more.

**Stryxen** (8): the DRAMA of it all

**UselessTacooo** (8): a cute little song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Both of their voices are so lovely, and their harmonies work so well with the jazzy sound!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the piano is cool but this just kind of bores me until the end

**bigbigbee** (7): Sounds like velvet and gold

**jaztinax** (7): can‚Äôt tell if i still love it or kinda hate it

**NotWith10000Men** (7): really like the jazzy sound

**trixiematthell** (7): like how dramatic it is

**vayyiqra** (7): Ngl I like Utada but didn't remember this one. Isn't it really more of a Sheena Ringo song?

**fadedblue09** (6.5): An‚Ä¶.interesting choice for this rate. Kinda grew on me though

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): something something Pok√©mon

#Dusk 'til Dawn

**2dina3dworld** (6): are they doing the cup song in the background

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but the production on this just feels a little disjointed somehow.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): why'd this get sent over all the other better Utada songs in this rate? it certainly has its moments but the vocals are just weird.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I prefer Diamond and Pearl

**nt96** (5): I like Sheena, but she's put out MUCH better music than this

**sweetnsaursauce11** (5): it's not bad but it's not for me

**TiltControls** (4): I think I was the lowest score for this in EAPR so I'm not going to be scoring it much better here. I don't know it's just... not an entertaining song for me

#no words

**majid** (11): period

**akanewasright** (10): yeah this was the soundtrack to my gay longing throughout the rate

**Alumineous** (10): Interludeish songs must get full marks.

**apatel27** (10): Sufjan Gay Icon

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): yas daddy slay

**frogaranaman** (10): pretty beautiful because of its homosexuality

**IdiotBox01** (10): popheads listening to indie music: "boring! oh wait this song is gay? i wish i liked it more :yawn: what are lyrics?"

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E87Lqb6WQAUgdTT.jpg

**plastichaxan** (10): y‚Äôall are weak for not sending impossible soul :talktothehand:

**seanderlust** (10): I don't even know if this is a real 10 in this rate I just...I don't know man. it hits me. it makes me think of all the people i wish I could have told i loved them as much as I did. like I wish I could take them by the shoulders and be like I pay attention so much to everything you do

**slimboyfriend** (10): he needs a really gay hug

**Stryxen** (10): i cannot even begin to describe how much i love this song

**sufjancaesar** (10): Anything below a 10 is blasphemous

**thedoctordances1940** (10): tbh i don't really like this pick cause it's by far the least representative of the album as a whole but like it's still a 10

**throwaway-7650** (10): deserved better in HCP, redemption in AS5

**UselessTacooo** (10): gay panic - colorized

**vayyiqra** (10): :hanawinsSad: :hanawinsCries:

**waluigiest** (10): gay

**wavingwolves** (10): these bitches gay good for them etc etc

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): gay

**AHSWeeknd** (9): iconic tbh

**bbfan132** (9): i had heard the first part of this and thought it would be just acoustic but god, it‚Äôs so lush

**bo\_g\_o** (9): still quite beautiful

**flavasavavandal** (9): Find it funny in a rate which was defined by possibly the longest song to be rated (Dopesmoker doesn‚Äôt count since I believe that was optional), hosts sent the artist‚Äôs shortest song

**IIIHenryIII** (9): except/specially when it comes to your music

**iniekcja\_** (9): shoutout to an ex classmate of mine who was pretty much my gateway to Sufjan's musicü•∞ü•∞

**runaway3212** (9): crying like a girlboss who understands STEM

**jman457** (8.7): Not my fav Sufjan song we rated this year but still amazing

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Short but sweet

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): what a quiet yet intimate little ballad

**bigbigbee** (8): I was playing this rate‚Äôs playlist around friends because, well, it slaps, and when this came on one of my friends looked up and was like ‚ÄúOh I know this from a teen wolf podfic‚Äù

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I get why this was picked as the Age of Adz representative but the weirder songs on the album are better!

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): he has a sad voice

**homestarguy** (8): More of a classic Sufjan sound compared to the rest of the album, yet the reverb adds a bit more of a psychedelics vibe to it. Very pretty, even if it's not the most ambitious song.

**trixiematthell** (7.9): i love mr stevens

**ricki** (7.8): i probably need to build some attachment for this song to fully get it

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): that high note in the guitar is really pleasing to listen to tbh

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**2dina3dworld** (7): strummy strummy Sufjan hours.

**anothertown** (7): "few-till" >>> "few-tile"

**bridgemoney** (7): So why is he considered a gay icon again?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): thanks for choosing the least annoying on the album so I wouldn‚Äôt tank but it‚Äôs still kind of boring ‚ù§Ô∏è

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its cute

**rslashpoopheads** (7): haha gay

**TiltControls** (7): so glad this is in the rate cause I'll get to watch more fanfiction-stylized shitposts

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.5): Too short to be good >:(

#homophobic

**camerinian** (6): I get the feeling this works way better in the album than it does on its own

**fadedblue09** (5): Within its album, it's the best for sure but here? Try hard not to get devoured sis

**just\_thonking** (4): I Want to Be Well was right there and y'all chose this snoozefest instead?

**GapeCod** (3): Slice of life pining songs are usually amazing, but this just makes me feel nothing, which is in itself weirdly impressive for a Sufjan song, because I liked a lot of his other stuff.

**sweetnsaursauce11** (3): i wish i could get into sufjan stevens but i just haven't been able to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): this is a genuine question for all the sufjan stans out there. do you like this song because you actually think its a good piece of music or do you like it because its gay. because i can‚Äôt fathom why anyone would enjoy this otherwise

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): the longest 2 minutes ever

**Awkward\_King** (0): sometimes sufjan works for me and sometimes he doesn't and this just/.... really does not. i realised i was too generous to it in hcp when it went out at #9 and ppl were considering it was robbed and i was like.... i was being nice. i just find the melody with the little repeated plucking sound really grating and i know they can be endearing to people and i completely respect that but lines like "and when i sleep on your couch i feel very safe" piss me off so much like wtf is this jakwsjdkaskjd

**NotWith10000Men** (0): why is this making me uncomfortable

#vote for the anime rate

**akanewasright** (10): stream Bad Mode by Hikaru Utada, it‚Äôs the album of the damn year

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A lot of people had this pegged as the obvious winner for EAPR (although hilariously enough it was never #1) and I can see why because it is a beautiful piece of music and the AG Cook association helps give it a bit of extra street cred. It‚Äôs grown off me a bit with time but it‚Äôs still an absolute ten lol. Vote for the Anime Openings/Closings Rate!

**jman457** (10): I almost did this original rate for this song alone, because this song is just magic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): can't wait to rate this a third time with the rest of Bad Mode! (don't kill my dreams I need this)

**seanderlust** (10): SO true stream their new album it's so good

**shhhneak** (10): This cannot be the closest we get to an anime rate.

**skargardin** (10): This song is so insanely stunning, it instantly captivated me the moment I heard it. Absolutely one of my favourite songs of last year.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): expecting the ‚ÄúGet in the rate Shinji‚Äù comments

**vayyiqra** (10): One of Utada's best songs and one I went back to many, many times after the rate. Stream Bad Mode, it's great.

**xearomis** (10): I actually rated it an 8 on the original EAPR rate but it has grown on me a lot since then, something about the production really makes me feel like everything‚Äôs gonna be alright

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.8): Utada Hikaru & A.G. Cook doing a dreamy progressive house/dance-pop number for a Neon Genesis Evangelion soundtrack was definitely not on my 2021 bingo card, but a very welcome surprise.

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): ghost's rates were just cursed to have the more popular frontrunner voted in over the fan favorite deep cuts huh

**apatel27** (9.5): It's a vibe

**bbfan132** (9): so so so pretty

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): grown on me a bit since the rate tbh

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): catcry x30

**rslashpoopheads** (9): BoA - Kiss My Lips

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): so true stream bad mode

**BasedButta** (8): as per a trend, this gets better toward the end

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): the anime that used for my username

**kappyko** (8): get in the fucking robot shinji

**TiltControls** (8): I used to love this, but I think it's fallen back into just 'good'-territory for me

**waluigiest** (8): the beat is tasty when the bass amps up

**trixiematthell** (7.4): made me want to dance

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the ‚Äúoh‚Äù part is interesting

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is quite nice.

**homestarguy** (7): Nice but unremarkable piece of J-pop to me. It knows when to bring the beat in and out which was cool.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Love Eva, this song is just okay, Shinji is still a bicon

**Stryxen** (6.5): there‚Äôs a really good song here but the execution is unfinished at best

#you guys too even if i'm >:( at you

**anothertown** (6): pharmaceutical ad type beat

**ignitethephoenix** (5): out of all the Utada songs people stan, I honestly don‚Äôt get why people like this one so much. It‚Äôs just kind of dull and one note I want to get it but I don‚Äôt at all.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I don't mind generic pop songs, but this one doesn't go anywhere. Where's the explosive chorus? Where's the fun? Sorry, this is really boring.

**runaway3212** (4): me yawning

**sweetnsaursauce11** (3): it's boring me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i didnt get the hype around it before and i sure as hell still dont get the hype now
