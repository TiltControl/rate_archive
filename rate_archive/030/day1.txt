I only put this up cause /u/nfranklin50 asked me

---

Shakespeare's ghost is SHOOK RIGHT TO HIS VERY CORE

---
**Nfranklin50** (11): man this is so powerful. I'm not even kidding put this in front of any song and it makes it better and more motivational

**Dono\_AGB** (10): Best intro I've heard in a while. Wig.

**MrSwearword** (10): poetry that doesn't suck is a good way to get a good score

**rupull\_** (10): I have this memorized...

**whatareblackhole** (10): Beautiful poem, absolutely stellar way to open a debut

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i kinda want to meme about this but this is honestly a pretty good intro

**Kaylaboe** (9): inspirational

**VeganSquash** (9): sets up the album well. Generally not a fan of intros, but eh.

**shineflyer** (8): I'm down for this to be a full slam poetry album.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): okay snatch me with this spoken word

**eklxtreme** (7): slay

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Slam poetry for the win girlie!

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): ok

**Raykel** (7): I like spoken word. I can't tell if this is good or not but it soothes me so imma say good.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): invented slam poetry

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): It's a pretty good poem.

**jamesfog** (6): Ariana did it better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A spoken word interlude that doesn’t detract much from the music - it’s pretty okay.

**awryj** (5): /r/poetryheads

**banananaise** (5): why is this in the rate lmao

**BiPolarBear17** (5): Oh my god the beat in this one goes off! The drop is explosive, and the instrumental right from the beginning sent my wig into orbit! I'm shook!

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Okay???

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5): I’m not a fan of spoken word intros (this isn’t a paper...you don’t need to state your thesis), but I liked her delivery of it.

**letsallpoo** (5): is this the beginning of the hold up mv. when will beyonce's plagiarism end

**luuvin** (5): lame, sort of sick of this kind of "intro" tbh

**personwithhair** (5): It's cute, and I love Reyna Biddy, but yeah... I came here for a Kehlani album...

**sletrab07** (5): Slam poetry? Skiiiiip.

**triptoyourheart** (5): Ariana is shook, will this make it to Day 2 as well?

**rocketgamer31** (3): I like the message but I skip this every time tbh

**SkyBlade79** (3): extra slam poetry bs

**agentofscranton** (1): wow I can’t believe Kehlani invented poetry

**angusaditus** (1): I hate spoken words, the unnatural flow of words always trigger me lol

**cyborglilith** (1): this will not mimic ariana’s intro

**dropthehammer11** (0): I'm giving this a 0 bc it isnt a song and if this beats any actual song I'll holler

**gannade** (0): this is basically the "if you can't handle me at my worst..." marilyn monroe quote but 20 times as long & 20 times as annoying. completely unnecessary.

**nooodisaster** (0): Why are we rating a slam poem that the artist didn't write?

**Highest scores:** (10 x1) BiPolarBear17 (9.5 x1) mokitsu (9 x2) bluehxrizon, FKATWINKS 

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) rupull\_ (2.5 x1) VeganSquash

This song has real potential but it's all wasted on the droning and
lacklustre instrumental and I'm struggling not to fall asleep while listening to this.

---
**BiPolarBear17** (10): A breath of fresh air. This haunting, ethereal track comes out of nowhere and the production on it is insane. It feels so sincere and raw, and everything about this is just such a huge vibe.

**MrSwearword** (8): kind of all over the place but subtle in a way that's really good

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): That chorus tho

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Obviously one of the slower songs on the album, but I do enjoy her vocals here

**shineflyer** (7.5): I love the kind of glitchy sounds you hear on occasion. This song sounds more similar to the othe two in the rate than a lot of the songs thus far in the album.

**1998tweety** (7.4): K this one put me to sleep but not peaceful sleep

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Maybe a little too slow, but it kinda works.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): i don't care about this song.

**triptoyourheart** (6.5): Sometimes I have to be in the mood for this one, definitely one of the fillers on the album.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.4): The actual song is great but the production is so sparse that it ends up feel like an unfinished demo.

**cyborglilith** (6): good chill song

**eklxtreme** (6): nice vibes but I wouldn't listen to this again

**whatareblackhole** (6): I want to love the emotion in this, but it’s boooorrriiinnnngggg

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Filler tbh

**Raykel** (5): I loved the sensual vibe but I feel like it didn't go far enough. This could've been sexy but it came off as tired. Still a big mood tho.

**SkyBlade79** (5): pretty cute but boring

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I had to play this song a few times over because it’s so boring.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.5): #moody but kinda goes nowhere

**Kaylaboe** (4.5): After a lot of uptempo songs this tracks slows everything down a notch. Sadly it’s not very interesting

**jess\_22** (3): this just screams filler

**VeganSquash** (2.5): Not bad per say, but the chorus is underwhelming

**rupull\_** (1): Just... so bad. If I could give another 0 this would be it. Should've been cut from the album.

Pussy

---
**awryj** (10): Ok this is hilarious

**letsallpoo** (10): hearing this song and the "PUUSSAAAY" lines getting blasted out of some dorm while i was walking around campus at night was an experience

**Nfranklin50** (10): pussy

**robbiec\_** (10): (( p u s s y ))

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9): The beat is dope, and I love the two of them together.

**Kaylaboe** (9): Queen of good taste in films. The production is lush and chill, but I feel like it lacks something a little extra, and I’m a little disappointed by Kendrick’s verse. And if anyone wondered how many times we hear pussy in this song; it’s 29.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): https://imgur.com/gallery/KLWcA7H

**sletrab07** (8.5): Interesting use of throwback hip-hop drums. Kendrick’s verse is aurally entrancing, albeit a little head-scratching (what exactly is the point of the pussy metaphor in the song?).

**eklxtreme** (8): Kendrick's verse is kinda funny and clever. I like the lyrics overall here, but it's kinda forgettable.

**Leixander** (8): POOS-EH

**MashLuke** (8): finally a straight anthem in this overly gay place!1!!1

**rupull\_** (7.5): Fun song and the nice subtle "pussssyyyy" in the back of the song makes me think it's a kinda jokey song but I won't lie and say that it doesn't have a good production and tells a great story like you.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): pusssyyyyyyy

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): Kendrick’s verse…what a choice.

**Raykel** (7.2): Finally a Kendrick verse on a pop song that's good.

**BiPolarBear17** (7): Doves In The Wind but everytime SZA says pussy it gets faster and everytime Kendrick says pussy it gets replaced by Carl Weezer

**cyborglilith** (7): good production

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I think this song was when I realized I was not cool enough to listen to this album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): It’s the PUSSY song. Kendrick Lamar delivers a good, if hilarious performance here, and SZA delivers on the rest of the track. It’s honestly not my favorite track on the album, and as much as I love Kendrick, his verse is almost a little too lighthearted for the subject matter here.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (6.9): lol sex

**luuvin** (6.5): tbh if kendrick wasn't in this song it'd be wayyyy higher

**nooodisaster** (6.5): this song is hilarious, and i kinda love that. kendrick's verse makes me nauseous tho, true 0 of the rate.

**banananaise** (6): it feels like Kendrick is revolving around my head talking about pussy, and i do not need it

**dropthehammer11** (6): P U S S Y

**personwithhair** (6): I love Kendrick usually, but he kinda ruins the momentum of this song

**shineflyer** (6): I've never heard this word used so much in a song before, or as delicately. ...You KNOW which word.

**1998tweety** (5.8): pussy x30, not gonna work on a gay sub

**jamesfog** (5): The Pussy lines really drag this down for me.

**MrSwearword** (5): I know why it's called "Doves in the Wind" because SZA was high as shit making this

**angusaditus** (4): too vulgar

**deltacall** (4): Ok I'm sorry I HATE the Kendrick verse on this one. I like Kendrick fine enough but the verse ruins the whole song

**zaneylainy** (4): you think kendrick

**rocketgamer31** (3): I'm sorry I really don't feel the need to listen to a song that keeps repeating pussy... Like I know I'm gay and all but it's just off-putting tbh

**VeganSquash** (1.5): I don't really get the meaning, and the word 'pussy' turns me off so.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): cupcakke outvagina'd

**Elitefourbrad** (0): too much pussy, needs more dick tbh

**SkyBlade79** (0): DAE PUSSY? This song is so bad to listen to, they can’t pronounce anything right, and god, that metaphor makes no sense. Pussy like doves in the wind? What the hell does that mean? It’s so weird and just enforces bad stereotypes.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): surely the both of them are better than this lmao

**triptoyourheart** (0): Awful awful awful. Sometimes SZA's accent in which she sings in annoys me but here it's especially bad and Kendrick shouting "PUSSY!" is so cringey, how do his features turn out so bad most of the time?

6hard9me not to cringe when she sings the second half of the chorus and
absolutely stains the reputation the Spice Girls established with the song title "Too Much". Also,
the drums are really out of place here. The rap on the bridge is somewhat redeeming though

---

**DraculaWeekend** (11): This song is too much, three much, four much, five much, too much for me. The Timbaland-esque production, the Aaliyah sample, the infectious chorus. Everything just works so well here. One of my favorite songs ever

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is a 10 just because of Timbaland dropping that beat.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This sounds like if a 90's girl group was fronted by Rihanna.

**MrSwearword** (10): unique in its own right

**robbiec\_** (9): like I said about Thug Cry this just feels like a classic RnB song

**awryj** (8): 2boppy3boppy4boppy5boppy4me

**rocketgamer31** (8): Too much describes the number of songs on this album

**banananaise** (7): well, now i know Kehlani can count to five. wow

**eklxtreme** (7): oh i almost forgot this existed. love the instrumental and it's kind of a bop but sis what were you thinking when you wrote that chorus

**jamesfog** (7): Wouldn't be surprised if Meghan Trainor wrote this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Another track with a really nice instrumental and some boring vocals.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Too much, three much, four much, five much? Girl, no. The rapping bridge makes the song stand out though so that's nice.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): she's savage!!1

**jess\_22** (6): kind of forgettable but this gets points for the Aaliyah vibes

**Kaylaboe** (6): invented counting! arabic numerals who? Kehlani brings her best braggadocio and spoken-word parts, but however I do find this song a little underwhelming.

**MashLuke** (6): Queen of counting how many songs she can add to her album to make it longer

**shineflyer** (6): 3much5you

**whatareblackhole** (6): This is such terrible filler. Ugh.

**VeganSquash** (5.5): this could've been a jazzy funky song tbh. Missed potential

**Raykel** (4): Lmaooo what was she trying to accomplish with the "3 much 5 much" lyrics? Shut just made me laugh.

**angusaditus** (3): I'm so tired of her calling herself a "bad bitch" lol

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): lmao why did she decide to use that Iggy-esque voice for that verse

**cyborglilith** (2): wtf are these lyrics

**rupull\_** (2): much, three much, four much, five much, too much filler

**BiPolarBear17** (1): Counting To Five™ with Kehlani.

**SkyBlade79** (1): horrible chorus, horrible bridge, omg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuR8LVKhUE

**agentofscranton** (0): I’ve been debating myself whether or not I like that ‘too much, three much etc.’ lyric and I think I’ve decided that, while fun, it’s really, really, really fucking stupid

Absolutely FANTASTIC stuff here and so late into the album too! Keep doing
what you're doing if it means more "Thank You"s, K!

**Nfranklin50** (10): This is so deeply personal coming from Kehlani knowing what she's been through and really should have been the closer

**1998tweety** (8.1): Meghan did it..she did it

**jamesfog** (8): A cute closer!

**Kaylaboe** (8): :meghan: why isn’t this closing the album smh kehlani. the choir is wonderful though

**nooodisaster** (8): :)

**sletrab07** (8): MTrain’s impact. Lmao this song is better than everything off that trash album.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7.8): thank you

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): okay the buildup surprised me!

**angusaditus** (7.5): cute song but her limited vocal range really holds the song back from being anything special

**eklxtreme** (7.5): very cute and personal, even if the chorus is just super cheesy.

**MashLuke** (7.5): honestly, my score is for the vocals only

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): wow meghan's impact

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Pretty good.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): This song should have been last on the album. It would have been a great closer

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Thank you for this bop!

**rocketgamer31** (7): I think she is subliminally thanking us for making it through the album because she realizes how long it actually is

**whatareblackhole** (7): This song is sweet, I can bop to it

**luuvin** (6): did we really need TWO ballads one after the other? did we really need ONE?

**SkyBlade79** (6): so sweet

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Make it stop.

---

 I forget what it is she's not used to and I'm not surprised because the song
itself is kinda forgettable tbh

---
**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is honestly such an emotional song, talking about her family issues, Oakland, toxic relationships with men and dealing with fame as a fame.

**rupull\_** (10): Head to toe everything from this song is just so right and those little jazz spurrs throughout this song is amazing. Plus Kehlani breaths life into every verse some great lyrics and that bridge is so good too.

**triptoyourheart** (10): This song always hits me hard, I know Kehlani had a rough childhood and seeing this performed live was so powerful.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): The production on this is so good. Sounds amazing with headphones

**nooodisaster** (8): The verses are fucking brutal and hit like a truck with her blunt autobiographical lyrics. Chorus lets the song down though as it just sort of happens.

**SkyBlade79** (8): that bass is wacky but in a cool way

**VeganSquash** (8): great lyrically, but the chorus feels disjointed from the verses

**eklxtreme** (7.5): pretty catchy chorus and instrumental, but it drags a bit

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): I love the lyrical content, but the production overwhelms it

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): it's like a CTRL song but good which means its still not as strong as the rest of the album

**agentofscranton** (7): the way she says ‘I am not’ for some reason reminds of tommy wiseau in the room but idk

**MashLuke** (7): God these lyrics... must have been tough

**rocketgamer31** (7): I dig the instrumental here

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Unrelated but I just realized I’m not even halfway through this album.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.7): Verses are super repetitive (if you’re gonna sing-rap, please try to switch up the flow occasionally). However, it’s cool that Kehlani opens up about her past, and I love how dramatic the chorus is.

**BiPolarBear17** (6.5): Imagine if this song had a good chorus 😭

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): Ok.

**robbiec\_** (5): the trap thing doesn't work here imo sorry it's still a bop though

**shineflyer** (5): I don't feel like I'll remember this by the time of the rate's reveal.

**Leixander** (4): She repeats the title too much that it gets annoying

**Kaylaboe** (3.5): quite forgettable

 I was already had from the guitars but then girlie goes and pulls out a
KEY CHANGE! Could still do without the autotune though

---
**agentofscranton** (10): she should do more songs like this, the instrumental works really well for her vocally, and it’s a welcome break from an otherwise dull and samey album

**eklxtreme** (10): I'm in love with these kinds of sweet 2000s melodies. It just sounds so nostalgic and warm.

**jess\_22** (10): ballads can be very hit or miss for me but this is beautiful. It's a nice change of pace to the rest of the album which was starting to all sound the same.

**Nfranklin50** (10): The phrase hold me by the heart is too much and i get embarrassed everytime I play this song around other people but I love that guitar and everything else about this song

**cyborglilith** (9): basic but bops

**ImADudeDuh** (9): An unexpected song, but still a bop!

**Kaylaboe** (9): Kehlani sounds great over a more acoustic and stripped-down instrumental, and this is definitely a highlight from SSS.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): This should be THE slow song in this album. It doesn't feel as fillerish as some of the other songs, her vocals are really good, and it just fits in better than the rest. Definitely the highlight of this second half of the album.

**triptoyourheart** (9): Another song I think will get done wrong and leave early on Day 1 but I love it. Such a sweet ballad.

**jamesfog** (8): Cute acoustic song!

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7.8): ooh an acoustic guitar!

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I like the guitar but it just feels like an obligatory acoustic track to me, the vocals are nice though

**awryj** (7): A nice change of pace, but it sounds like a YT cover of a Disney song

**MashLuke** (7): I like the catch phrase of this song, it's pretty simple yet cool

**robbiec\_** (7): what a disney title

**VeganSquash** (7): a Kehlani song without trap beats??? What is this???

**MrSwearword** (6): sweet but boring as shit

**nooodisaster** (6): This is 100% a Radio Disney song & you can't convince me otherwise.

**shineflyer** (6): it's nice, but damn can you hear that pitch correction lol

**SkyBlade79** (6): aw a disney song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): How is this album 19 songs.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): this sounds like one of those songs Disney makes their pop girls sing for Tinkerbell movies

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): noooo i thought we were done with bland ballads that she doesnt have the voice to carry

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This ballad flopped girl sorry.

**rupull\_** (4): Disney song reject

**whatareblackhole** (4): Like, we get it at this point…the lyrical themes are running together

**Raykel** (3): I just see nothing special about this. This can be said about the whole album really.

Apparently this was released as an exclusive deluxe track and it was put up on streaming when "Work" by Rihanna came out lol. I'm kinda indefferent on it, it lacks the quality of the rest of the songs on the album so I just ignore it.

---
**eklxtreme** (10): the production is so good. that pre-chorus to chorus left my wig flying. better than rihanna's work.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): yes daddy

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): https://i.imgur.com/9jbzGlT.jpg

**jamesfog** (9.5): A 2 On/All Hands On Deck-tier bop!

**gannade** (9): why didnt this blow up with the rest of the work songs

**personwithhair** (9): A better version of All Hands on Deck, which is a better version of 2 On

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): Great synthpop song

**MashLuke** (8.5): Fifth Harmony was found dead, Rihanna bald and Kelly ditched

**cyborglilith** (8): this is actually good but is very manufactured

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Why is this 2008-sounding dance bop all the way at the end of the album? The beat reminds me of a Casacada song, and that’s never a bad thing. I feel like I’m the only person who liked Flame, so this is more my style.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ok a slut bop

**banananaise** (7): queen of riding both the 'work' and 'daddy' trends

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): kinda generic but still goes off

**rupull\_** (6): very catchy but it sounds like a Fifth Harmony reject :/

**whatareblackhole** (6): Never listened to this before…wish I had kept it that way…

**shineflyer** (5.5): that opening synth is so cheesy lol. Not bad otherwise though

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.3): Idk why but the synths on this really annoy me and the hook is average.

**jess\_22** (5): oh so this is where fifth harmony got their inspiration

**Kaylaboe** (5): rihanna and fifth harmony who?

**nooodisaster** (5): This sounds like the Radio Disney version of Feels Like Vegas oh god.

**triptoyourheart** (5): Screaming @ how this almost made her get another song chart on the Hot 100 because people thought it was Rihanna's Work. Never cared for this though, definitely deserved bonus track status.

**letsallpoo** (4): http://popcrush.com/tinashe-watch-me-work-rihanna-work-billboard-confusion/ iconic

**SkyBlade79** (3): nnn did she say daddy

**VeganSquash** (2.5): work from home but worse

**BiPolarBear17** (2): I guess this is better than a certain other track titled 'Work', however that really isn't saying much.

**deltacall** (2): Fifth Harmony remain unbothered. Thank god this wasn't on the regular album

**MrSwearword** (1): wait, wasn't this already tried out on "2 On"?

The way she sings the "I just wanna be" reminds me of Shawn Mendes on "Aftertaste"
which is a plus from me because I'm happy to be reminded of Shawn's existence, not to
mention the bridge gives me "Take A Bow" teas. This one is actually really good and is probably
a crowd-favorite at concerts

---
**eklxtreme** (10): ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. she pulls off beautiful soulful throwback harmonies, kinda similar to what kelly rowland does on the song dilemma . it's so stripped down and simple which is what I loved about 2000s r&b.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow #redeemed

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): I can get over that this sounds like 2010-Biebz, because this is a bop! Kehlani sounds really good over this instrumental, and the bombastic chorus is great.

**angusaditus** (8): cute tbh

**dropthehammer11** (8): love the use of guitars mixed with pulsing bass

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): honestly she can make multiple shitty songs, but her harmonies can save them for me

**Nfranklin50** (8): Honestly I really love theses random acousitc songs. Somehow it just fits

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Pretty pleasant to the ear, not a whole lot different from everything else though.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.1): I like that this song manages to be sweet while the production retains Kehlani’s edge, but some parts of the melody are weird.

**rocketgamer31** (7): I dig pretty much everything about this song but the chorus just doesn't work for me

**shineflyer** (7): This song kind of reminds me of Jojo?

**nooodisaster** (6): Kehlani really isn't good at choruses, is she?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Meh.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Pretty good tbh.

**gannade** (5): all these songs sound the same and they are ok but i will play none of them again. also this highkey sounds like a hannah montana song but not as good

**awryj** (4.5): Queen of referencing Carly Rae Jepsen's magnum opus

**BiPolarBear17** (4): Discount Jordin Sparks

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): eh this breaks into generic r&b territory. Flame is shook!

**luuvin** (4): wow ok girl...

**SkyBlade79** (3): I forgot about this song as soon as it ended

**VeganSquash** (3): I wish this didn't have trap beats

**MrSwearword** (1): sedated "Distraction" and I am not here for it

**rupull\_** (0): Boring ballad that sounds like a reject from any other plain artist who's scared to hit high notes. And, I thought she was going to sing "I kinda sorta think you're great gay" which might be the point of the song but it is just so bad like it's not a good look for her. Bad.

This took quite some time to grow on me. At first it seemed like a disjointed mess but it's became one of my favorite songs in the album. The Janet sample is great (and kinda smart, considering how much they're compared to each other). The Future verse is kinda killer though, as it's super hard to understand what he's saying lol.

---

 Wait? You're asking ME how many times we can fuck
tonight? Well since you're asking, I should let you know that if you're looking to find out, kn-knknow
that you and I-I-I, we ain't gonna sleep toni-i-ight 😉Also Future does nothing for me here.
In fact, I find him really unnecessary; was T just being charitable here or could she not think of a
second verse? This bitch is never gonna learn that rap verses make songs worse more than they
make them better?

---
**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): Yaaaas Janet sample.

**MashLuke** (9.5): I like the chorus a lot. It's a simple phrase but it makes it clear that there's passion in that room

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This chorus is infectious, I love it so much!

**jamesfog** (9): The Janet sample!! Future isn't even that bad on this

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): 3

**triptoyourheart** (9): The Janet sample is soooooo good.

**banananaise** (8): the whispered french intro immediately made me think i'd accidentally clicked on a janet jackson song

**Leixander** (8): Tinashe slays but Future, what are you doing? I can't understand anything he says and it doesn't really sound pleasant.

**robbiec\_** (8): this is hot

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): the Janet sample is great, but literally WHAT is Future saying?

**cyborglilith** (7): Future’s verse is trash but tinashe slays here

**dropthehammer11** (7): wow this is a hoe ANTHEM, also living legend Future graces us with his presence

**nooodisaster** (7): It's like they knew this song was boring so they added layers of vocals over everything until it wasn't .And fuck it, it worked.

**rocketgamer31** (7): How many times? The limit does not exist. This song would be sexier if Future didn't ruin it with... whatever that was though

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): wow has future ever sounded more annoying on a song

**VeganSquash** (7): the chorus felt like a prechorus, and Future's verse was incoherent misogynistic garbage, but aside from that this is the first song I've remotely liked

**whatyourheartdesires** (7): Future is so unnecessary

**angusaditus** (6): vulgar!

**eklxtreme** (6): this is ehh, it doesn't do anything for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): a boring chorus and a lackluster Future verse

**jess\_22** (6): and yet another good song is ruined by a mediocre rap verse

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Zodiac sign: A cup of lean

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): Meh.

**whatareblackhole** (6): How many times can you say capital F Filler? Especially with the annoying Future “verse”…it’s a boot

**shineflyer** (5.5): These chords are hella nice. Future's slightly out of place, but not bad. I just wish there was a bit more going on on the verses.

**awryj** (5): When Future's verse came on I thought it was just sound effects

**rupull\_** (5): It's cute, catchy, might get stuck in your head for like 3 days, but other than that its very meh. Plus Future just murdered the song (not in a good way)

**DraculaWeekend** (4.5): Weakest song on the album. Plus I really don't like Future so that didn't help. Seriously, what was that verse?

**sletrab07** (4): This sounds like the soundtrack for a poorly-directed sex scene where two lesbians eat each other out in a Shonda Rhimes TV series.

**MrSwearword** (3): Future ruins an actually competent song

**SkyBlade79** (3): what the hell is Future doing on this I am laughing so hard

**Raykel** (1): It seems very heavily Janet Jackson inspired but just completely fails. Wtf is Future even doing?

**BiPolarBear17** (0): A mediocre song that derails further into a train-wreck when Future decides to open his mouth.

**Kaylaboe** (0): I don’t know french but I doubt that is phonetically correct, miss Tinashe. While Aquarius is mostly a hit, this song is very much a miss. The verses are promising, but the chorus is underwhelming. The main offender, and why I’m finally giving out my first 0 in a rate, is because of the truly godawful inclusion of Future on this track. There is no need to have an irritating adlib every other second and then topping it off with the most tragic verse in history. Yuck.

I forgot about Mike Will Made It. No wait I just remembered Black Beatles but it's
not something worth remembering, especially as a Halsey stan. And it definitely shows on this
song. Also the only explanation I can have for her making a "thug cry" is that either her breath
or her hoo-ha or maybe the two of them smells like onions and the thugs can't help but let their
eyes water. Kinda like how my ears felt when I tried to listen to this

---
**MashLuke** (10): Please Tinashe, make me cry

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.7): This has a bit of a throwback vibe that switches up the album. She sounds great on this!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the harmonies! wig!

**eklxtreme** (8): kinda cheesy but it has a nice bouncy beat that's really catchy

**robbiec\_** (8): this just feels like a classic RnB song imo

**rocketgamer31** (8): Almost impossible to not bop my head to this beat, her vocals are on point here too

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Zodiac sign: Libra

**whatareblackhole** (8): I’ve never really listened to this one, but it’s kind of a bop!

**awryj** (7.4): Undoubtedly a bop, but it doesn't really build up to anything.

**banananaise** (7): yes mommy make me cry (again)

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Thugs don’t cry Tinasha sweetie.

**jess\_22** (7): this was a bop until I heard the chorus

**nooodisaster** (6.5): spoiler alert: she just makes the thug watch Coco.

**triptoyourheart** (6.5): I always think the "Mike Will Made It" at the start says "Mind Will Mend", which would make a lot more sense tbh.

**cyborglilith** (6): filler

**SkyBlade79** (6): mike will made it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): The bridge makes the song but doesn't save it from being forgettable.

**VeganSquash** (6): it's lacking in something. Also, the intro is VERY similar, like I hear it all the time somewhere

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Sorry but LOL at this song title

**sletrab07** (5.5): Watch Tinasha make this thug cry tonight from her trash album.

**Kaylaboe** (4.5): I’ve always been so confused on what the title means. Does she mean ‘cry’ as in ‘scream out a mating signal’ or ‘cry’ as in ‘i can make a thug sad’. Either way, it’s more of a miss. The verses, as almost every other verse on this album are amazing, but the chorus is again a bit of a letdown. I think the repetitiveness of it brings it down

**shineflyer** (4): The drums are cool, but the instrumental doesn't really live up to them for me.

**BiPolarBear17** (3): The production on this is lush but it's let down by the silly lyricism.

**MrSwearword** (3): committed but this song is still bad

**personwithhair** (2): A K.Michelle song without the K.Michelle voice so no thanks

I just checked and I still have half the album left. It's gonna take everything I
have to make it through. This song kinda helps because the way K says "I" on the chorus
reminds me of Ariana Grande on "I Don't Care" despite it being one of the weaker DW tracks.
This song makes up for all the areas where that one falters, and is actually pretty decent.

---
**Elitefourbrad** (10): FUCKBOYS GET FUCKED I LIVE KEHLANI.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): The song gets a 10 just for rhyming “good in me” with “hood in me."

**triptoyourheart** (10): Fucking love this song even though it took a little while to click for me. I love her rapping of the verses, the second verse always snatches me bald.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Kehlani you'll do us all dirty if you don't release more bops like this

**rupull\_** (8): The bridge ends up ruining any flow and strenght that the song had but other than that it is a very solid song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Finally, a track that doesn’t make me sleepy.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): yeh its good.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): okay some of the energy is back whew

**MashLuke** (7): I mean, if you insist to do me dirty

**SkyBlade79** (7): kind of filler but those lyrics tho

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Idk I guess it's ok I'm getting bored.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): some pretty parts to the song but it's mostly forgettable

**shineflyer** (5.5): The last lines of the chorus are really cool.

**whatareblackhole** (5): It’s…a five.

**MrSwearword** (2): vibeclash; the beat needed to be darker or the vocals needed to be different

**eklxtreme** (9.5): fuckin sharp production and great sing-rapping flow. that "if it isn't love" melody is so catchy.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.2): The production on this one is amazing.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): The best example of Kehlani incorporating her rap-singing along with her actual singing. A bop!

**whatareblackhole** (9): WHY IS THIS SO FAR DOWN ON THE TRACKLIST? Diamond in the rough!

**rupull\_** (8.5): after what felt like 75 years of filler we finally get a good song. But it's just that, a good song, nothing special.

**VeganSquash** (8.5): the chorus is so weird, and it's a shame because the verses and pre-chorus are LIT.

**1998tweety** (8.1): Lana did it better

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): a banger but Lana outslayed

**MashLuke** (8): #1, don't pick up the phone

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): The beat is definitely a lot more exciting than the previous SEVEN, so it gets a lot of points for that.

**awryj** (7.8): a bop, but it drags on a little bit

**jamesfog** (7): The background vocals are a choice

**nooodisaster** (7): Summary of this album: good verses, meh chorus

**SkyBlade79** (7): it’s not mixed great but that bass is cool

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The 2013 era buildup synths! But, unfortunately, the drop is weak, and the song itself is kinda weak as a whole.

**cyborglilith** (6): where is lana

**MrSwearword** (6): holy christ this cadence is all over the place

**rocketgamer31** (6): There's just something about this track that has never clicked with me and I'm not sure what it is

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A shorter, but punchier track than most on the album. The beat is snappy, and the whole thing being more upbeat injects some energy at the right time. A solid song.

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): You go Glen Coco! Oops I mean Gina

**banananaise** (7): i hope this is about Gina Rodriguez

**MrSwearword** (7): cool, but it's kind of...all over the place even by loose SZA standards

**personwithhair** (7): TOO SHORT

**nooodisaster** (6.5): This is the point in the album where I kinda wanna start skipping songs.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): Kind of a low point in the album.

**shineflyer** (5.5): pretty monotone, but in a chill way.

**VeganSquash** (5): I have no idea what SZA was saying in the first verse. And who is Gina?

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I just do not like this song.

**SkyBlade79** (2): what is the purpose

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): oh god that bell... enough!

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Where 👏 is 👏 the 👏 full 👏 track???

**Kaylaboe** (10): GIVE ME A LONGER VERSION SOLANA

**sletrab07** (10): THIS NEEDED TO BE A FULL TRACK. Those finger snaps make me body roll in public.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.8): Whyyyyyy isn’t this a full song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Honestly anything with James Fauntleroy in it is an instant classic.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): what a breath of fresh air! finally some real energy!

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This is how you do an interlude right, Tinashe take notes girl.

**luuvin** (9): why the FUCK isn't this a full song i s2g

**personwithhair** (9): Where's the full version you promised, Solana?

**VeganSquash** (9): extended version please

**whatareblackhole** (9): TOO SHORT!

**jess\_22** (8): why are the best songs always so short? :/

**Leixander** (8): Why did she left this as an interlude we will never know, the full version of it would be so awesome. Also airhorns >>> all the classical instrumentals. :meghan:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Cute interlude. It’s not totally necessary, but it sounds great. James and SZA serve vocals, and it’s a pleasant, if short, track.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): nice harmonies, pretty smooth

**banananaise** (7): go away kanye

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I wish this was a full song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): An interlude that sounds good? @tinashe take notes!

**rocketgamer31** (7): I like her flow here. I know it's an interlude but I think she should've extended it a little bit longer since I quite like it.

**robbiec\_** (6): this should be complete

**shineflyer** (6): this isn't the Kanye rate

**MrSwearword** (5): did not need James Fauntleroy

**nooodisaster** (5): Only one interlude can Intro this rate, and this sure as hell aint' the one. Got points for Easy Bake reference.

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) triptoyourheart (3 x1) whatyourheartdesires 

---

 I can kinda get into this one but IMO its biggest flaw
is that when Isaiah jumps on the track it sounds like a completely different song altogether; not
consistent enough

---

**BiPolarBear17** (10): An absolutely phenomenal track. It's sinister, atmospheric and mysterious, and the track has this dark foreboding energy to it which hits you right away and never leaves. The horns are an extremely nice touch, and the track has by far the strongest rap feature in both the album and the rate overall. Rashad's rap section provides this dramatic moment that continuously builds up, becoming more intense and leaving you on the edge of your seat, but rather than exploding, it gently diffuses back down, which suits the track perfectly.

**cyborglilith** (10): I thot I was listening 2 lana del rey OMG THO I NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS AMAZING FEATURE BUT IDEK WHAT TO SAY IT’S JUST PERFECT

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): This is just so chill. Isaiah Rashad actually outperforms Kendrick and maybe even Travis. Definitely one of my favorite songs of the year as well.

**jess\_22** (9.5): that outro though

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): This song starts a little slow, but it picks up and by the end it’s just truly amazing. Probably my favorite feature on the album, Isaiah really steals the show here.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.4): I love the sonic picture all the different layers come together to make.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): the lyrics and production are gorgeous but Charmbracelet-era Mariah stan voice SZA CAN'T SING! SZA CAN'T SIIIING!

**Elitefourbrad** (8): aw this is a great self-reflective song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A classic Isaiah and SZA track. It lacks some of the punch that is present on their earlier collabs, but it’s still a great late album track that doesn’t slow the momentum down one bit.

**whatareblackhole** (8): This song goes over my head, but I like it!

**eklxtreme** (7): wish there was more to this and more to the Isaiah verse

**MrSwearword** (7): if SZA sees birds, I think she's talking about being high as fuck

**rupull\_** (7): I will say that it is a good song and her vocals are great, but this song doesn't sound like SZA and is probably the most out of place in this album.

**VeganSquash** (7): it sounded so futuristic and was really cool and all, but the second half lost some of the steam from the first half

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): It was nice of SZA to write a song about Aaron Paul's wife

**nooodisaster** (6.5): pretty little filler.

**rocketgamer31** (6): I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away, because I don't care much for this track

**shineflyer** (6): i feel like i can just kick back to this song

**SkyBlade79** (6): kinda cute

**Leixander** (5): The only song I skip in this album oop. I don't like her collaborations with Isaiah.

**personwithhair** (4): The only song I consistently skip on this album

**triptoyourheart** (2): Far too repetitive and dull, ruins the run of great tracks in the back half of the album.

That intro is… I mean I like "Gold" even when others might not, and there are
MANY others who don't like "Gold", but at least it was a syllable mashup done right. And for the
love of God, don't pitch it up either. Overall missed opportunity. Waste of a deluxe track.
