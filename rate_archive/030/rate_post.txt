https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7affsn/rate_the_female_rb_debut_rate_aquarius_vs_ctrl_vs/

Welcome to the female R&B debut rate! [I'm mokitsu, your host for tonight](http://i.imgur.com/ONhY3gT.gif).

This month we'll be rating the major label debut albums of three gorgeous queens: **Kehlani, SZA and Tinashe**. All three of them have been praised by critics and have been recognized as pioneers of the "alt-R&B" or "PBR&B" genre, which is described by its smooth, dreamy beats and lyrics about spirituality, sex and drugs.

##**Tinashe - [Aquarius](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Tinashe_-_Aquarius.png)**

Released in: October 7, 2014

&nbsp;

After releasing a  string of critically successful mixtapes, Tinashe signed with her label RCA and released her debut album. **Aquarius**, named after her sign, is a sultry, hypnotic album, capable of mixing old school R&B, hip-hop and pop and making a foward thinking body of work. 

**Aquarius** has enough variety for both people looking for accessible music and ones who want a more adventurous listen. While the singles *2 On* and *All Hands On Deck* are party playlists essentials, in songs like *Bet* or the opener *Aquarius*, Tinashe returns to the more somber, minimal sounds of her mixtapes, and in *Far Side of the Moon* and *Cold Sweat*, she pushes the genre forward with unpredictable production and delivery.

Endlessly compared to Janet and Aaliyah for her sexy vocals and production and her high energy performances, Tinashe is able to stand out in the modern age but unfortunately, she hasn't been able to garner the commercial success she deserves. Despite *2 On* smashing, the album only debuted at #17 and her follow-up albumtape, **Nightride** fared even worse, debuting at #89. 

Regardless of its commercial success, **Aquarius** remains a great debut album, and one of my favorite albums ever.

##**SZA - [CTRL](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/SZA_-_Ctrl_cover.png)**

Released in: June 9, 2017

 

**SZA** (Self Savior, Zig Zag Zig, Allah in the [Supreme Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Alphabet)), born Solána Rowe, is one of the three women in this rate with **CTRL**, her debut. At barely 26 years old, her life has taken a lot of turns: from being a gymnast to working with Beyoncé and Rihanna to being a model for Ivy Park to being a R&B superstar. Born in St. Louis, from a black-muslim family, she only could listen to one genre of music in her house: jazz, with the artists her father played, like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday or Louis Armstrong. This would mark the jazzy production on CTRL. Other of her influences would be given by one of her friends, in a Bar Mitzvah: she got gifted a CD mixtape with Red Hot Chili Peppers, LFO and Macy Gray, what she called 'emo sad white rich kid shit'. She loved it.
 
But that isn’t everything; one day her old brother gave her an iPod. On it, she found artists that completely broke with the styles of music she was accustomed to: Wu-Tang Clan, Björk, Common, Mos Def, Nas and Jay-Z. Her brother (Manhattan) also introduced her to music: when she was 19, he asked her to do backing vocals for one of his songs, [*Where Do We Go?*](https://soundcloud.com/urlbadman/sza-where-do-we-go-unreleased).
 
Fast forward a year: SZA self-releases her debut mixtape *See.SZA.Run*, which included the single [Time Travel Undone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBQuo-zJX98). Later in 2013, she signs to TDE and releases an EP, S. Then in 2014 she releases another EP, Z, including the songs [Child’s Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqL8X-VzG8) featuring Chance the Rapper and [Babylon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXDOcZLmrKU) featuring Kendrick Lamar. That'd be her last word until CTRL, which had the songs [Drew Barrymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp45V_M4Akw), [Love Galore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHXfCOjb3fk) and [Broken Clocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Exxu8lsGYE) as singles.
 
CTRL received critical acclaim from both press and listeners, who praised the production and her story-telling skills, with stories about love, cheating and maturity.

##**Kehlani -[ SweetSexySavage](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Sweetsexysavage.jpg)**

Released in: January 27, 2017

 

**Kehlani Ashley Parrish** is an American R&B singer born in Oakland California. She made her start in the teen band PopLyfe and even made it onto the TV show [America’s Got Talent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R--DKgErEss) in 2011. At the end of the bands run on the show Kehlani left the band and was homeless. Nick Cannon called her to join a rap group he was putting together and though it ended up not being her thing he continued to mentor her.

 On August 26, 2014 she released her debut mixtape “**Cloud 19**”. A year later on April 28, 2015 she release her second mixtape “**You Should Be Here**” to critical acclaim and reaching a peak of number 36 on the US Billboard 200 and a Grammy nomination. In the next year Kehlani would go onto have a public breakup with a sports star and due to rumors and false information she tried to take her own life. However on January 27, 2017 she bounced back stronger than ever with the release of her debut album **SweetSexySavage**. The album peaked at #3 on the billboard charts and gained more critical success.      

SweetSexySavage details Kehlani’s journey up until the present. She deals with topics of love, heartbreak, trust issues, and self actualization. She cites the albums biggest inspirations to be TLC, Natasha Bedingfield, Colbie Caillat, Gwen Stefani, and Pink.

##**Rules**

You guys proooobably know the drill by now. Here's what you need to do:


- Listen to each and every song and **assign it a score from 1 to 10, inclusive. You may use one decimal — 9.7 is allowed, 9.75 is not.** You can change your scores at any time - just PM me again. I’ll send out conformation replies saying I’ve officially got your scores. I’ll be checking that they aren’t too low or high and are in the proper format so the conformation will not be immediate, please have patience with me. Send your scores in using this[ link](https://tinyurl.com/yam25max).

- You are allowed to give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11.** This is one song for the entire rate, NOT one per album. These are **optional** and are meant to signify your favorite and least favorite song.

- Your scores should NOT be considered confidential. I’ll probably be posting lists of all scores received for each song as it’s revealed.

- **I will be enforcing a minimum average for this rate.** That means that if your average for any given album is below a certain threshold, I won't accept your scores and you'll have to resend them. I also reserve the right to reject your scores if I think you're intentionally trying to sabotage the results and not just rating songs based on how well you like them. You're allowed to dislike an album, but you're not allowed to be obnoxious about it.

- Also don't give every song on an album a 10 or something like that. Have some nuance in your scores.

- Use this [link](https://tinyurl.com/yam25max) to send in your scores. Please use this format as I'm using Poo's program. I'm a very busy individual and I need all the help I can get.

- You may (and are encouraged to!) include comments with your scores. To include a comment, just write it directly after your score, like this:

> All Hands On Deck: 0 Screw Tinasha, Beyoncé deserved to win

- **WRITE IT IN THE CORRECT FORMAT.** It's there for you in the private message link, just add number then optionally space then your comments. Space it correctly! 

**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**

> All Hands On Deck: 0: Screw Tinasha, Beyoncé deserved to win

> All Hands On Deck: Screw Tinasha, Beyoncé deserved to win 0

> All Hands On Deck: I'm giving this a 0 because I have no hands!

> All Hands On Deck: 0-Screw Tinasha, Beyoncé deserved to win

> All Hands On Deck: 0 (Screw Tinasha, Beyoncé deserved to win)

- Please don't write tons of excessively long comments for multiple songs. I want to include everyone's comments but if they get too long it becomes hard to do so.

- You may (and are also encouraged to!) include comments for particular albums. Feel free to write assays for these. **To include a comment, add a colon and write it directly on the album line**, like this:

> Album: Aquarius: Is the title about how wet my bussy is? 

PM it all to me. Then just sit tight until the reveal begins some time in December!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask below. I'll be accepting scores until the end of the month. For now we’ll say the due date is **December 1st.** I’ll give out extensions if you ask nicely but please make my life easier and just get it done before the end of the month.
