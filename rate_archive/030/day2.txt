Oh god. Another rap feature. Talk about ending an album on
a whimper. Also… this beat sounds exactly like "Needed Me" and it's in the same key as "Now
Or Never"… explain to me why Tinashe hasn't bothered with lawsuits? Or why Travis was even
considered for contributing to this song? He needs to do more verses like the one he did in
"Love Galore" where he didn't disrupt the flow of the song or try to hog all the attention away
from Tinashe. Also the song itself isn't that bad.

---
**SkyBlade79** (10): Very smooth and the bass is nice, production is amazing at the end. Travis KILLS IT! It’s so unique.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): travi$ scott still sounds like a computer virus but whew! a song! a slow jam!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.4): Tinashe has a knack for slow jams. This song has a driving, cinematic quality to it that makes me want to listen on repeat.

**MashLuke** (9): I like this song. The lyrics are quite explicit and the scene portrayed is pretty... interesting. However, if they are into that, I'm okay with that.

**rocketgamer31** (9): Not gonna lie this beat turns me on

**zaneylainy** (9): this song is hott

**rupull\_** (8): sexy, sultry, steamy, hot, everything in-between plus it reminds me of FKA Twigs!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Zodiac sign: A cactus

**eklxtreme** (7.5): I really like the production but the rest is just okay

**shineflyer** (7.5): I'm upset this isn't on Spotify, I'd probably be adding this to my playlist. Travi$ knows what he's doing, too.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): thenshecamelikeaaah

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): This sounds like it could fit well on Nightride

**Zugtris** (7.5): an I'm In It interpolation? here's an extra point x

**banananaise** (7): the phrase "put my dick in her mouth" evokes a bizarre image. like she's just there, mouth open, and he just places his dick on her tongue. is this a weird thing to think

**BiPolarBear17** (7): A Travis Scott feature that isn't awful !! Colour me impressed! It's nice that he isn't threatening to plant that seed inside me for once, bless.

**dropthehammer11** (7): i can feel my hips thrusting as i type this

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Sort of bopalicious?

**jamesfog** (7): Kinda boring

**Nfranklin50** (7): this was nice and druggy and while Travis's verse isn't bad it was just hella unnecessary

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Spoopy sexy.

**MrSwearword** (6): Travis Scott outshines Tinashe, plain and simple

**triptoyourheart** (6): The production is nice, almost Nightride-esque but this doesn't hit as hard as it should and that's a shame.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): she sounds like she's asleep lmao

**awryj** (4): [DISCUSSION] did jesus copy the syllable gimmick from ti•na•sha?

**personwithhair** (3): The rare instance where Japan doesn't get the best song on the album as an exclusive

**VeganSquash** (1): shockingly, Travis was the only redeeming factor of this

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) SkyBlade79 (2.5 x1) cloudbustingmp3 

---
**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): SZA, you’re too good for normalcy. Also, the keyboards on this are amazing.

**Kaylaboe** (10): This song has maybe my favourite vocals on the entire record, and that says a lot. The harmonising is angelic, the lyrics are personal yet relatable - really nailing that Taylor-sweet-spot - and the production is immaculate.

**MashLuke** (10): This sounds raw and personal and I like it a lot

**VeganSquash** (10): this is low-key depressing

**whatareblackhole** (10): Oof, packs the perfect punch.

**eklxtreme** (9): a very emotional heartfelt song with great production

**Elitefourbrad** (9): SZA wants to be whatever her man wants her to be, she just wants to be a normal girl. This shows growth from the beginning of their album when she wanted to be his supermodel.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Normal Girl is solid, if not amazing - that is, until the second verse, which starts off with a Drake interpolation, and kicks the song into rapid fire overdrive. SZA honestly asks herself here why she can’t be a normal girl, which is a truly original concept. In all seriousness, it’s handled quite maturely, and her insecurity is paused for the gorgeous bridge, a stark realization that she is in fact, normal, and isn’t quite sure if she’s okay with it.

**awryj** (8.6): Here SZA does the "I'm not like the other girls" shtick just like Kehlani, but unlike her, she's convincing.

**cyborglilith** (8): relatable

**Nfranklin50** (8): Doing Drake better than Drake lol

**rocketgamer31** (8): I like the message of the song but I tend to get a little bored by this point, I don't feel like this song really goes anywhere

**sletrab07** (8): The tail end of the album feels weaker, musically. Lyrically, she’s still got it though.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Side chick anthem (?)

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I wish I was a normal girl too, SZA

**jamesfog** (7): I'm just a regular girl..

**banananaise** (6.5): is a popped top like a popped collar? is sza going around like a country club frat boy?

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Drake outsold.

**MrSwearword** (5): a weaker "Love Galore"

**shineflyer** (5): the ending's really cool

**rupull\_** (4): very meh.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.5): back at it again with the trying to sing out of ha range

**SkyBlade79** (2): wow isn’t she extra and special

 It was very, like, cool and interesting and, yeah I kinda liked it x

**c0ns3rvative** (10): sugary r&b perfection

**cyborglilith** (10): shook

**MrSwearword** (10): so funky and so ferocious, I am here for it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I feel like this should have been a hit. That hook is so fucking catchy and the song is really great in general.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): she really snapped huh

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Damn girl who did you wrong

**eklxtreme** (9): really fucking catchy. love how good a production as simple as that turned out.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): I love Kehlani’s rap-singing, she can even stand up to Chance the Rapper, don’t sleep on her.

**MashLuke** (9): This song got me shaking my finger while having a sassy facial expression

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): It’s good, but the hook on this just isn’t as strong as the preceding tracks.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): why is this basically a Sza song lol

**rupull\_** (8): Great flow. Good beats. Overall a solid song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Another slapper, but the rest of the track doesn’t really live up to that chorus and final verse.

**whatareblackhole** (8): “I got good heart, good soul, good sex, no stress” preach, queen

**jess\_22** (7): a bit repetitive but a bop nonetheless

**Leixander** (7): The synopsis of all the albums. Don't take it personal count: over 9000

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): a common theme on these albums

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I think this song was on my Discover Weekly like seven months ago because I randomly had scrobbles on it even though I have no idea what it is. So yeah, not the most memorable song lol.

**rocketgamer31** (6): Don't take it personal Kehlani but this ends up getting slightly repetitive after a while

**shineflyer** (6): those distorted backup vocals are my jam

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): can u believe kehlani copied this entire song from that one line in meghan trainor's NO

**VeganSquash** (5): great production but it feels like filler

**awryj** (4): Rhyming PERSONAL with HURTS TO KNOW??? I'm impressed. Apart from that it feels fillery.

**SkyBlade79** (4): meh, repetitive

**letsallpoo** (0): this is as repetitive as fifth harmony's discography

Oh this is from the "Suicide Squad" soundtrack? I didn't even notice. What I DID
notice was that the hook just feels like a hackjob of "6 Inch" by Beyonce the way she's trying to
drag out and slur the lyrics, so much so that the album is putting me back to sleep again in spite
of all my best efforts to maintain consciousness to get through the album. Weak closer and
another wasted deluxe track. I'm glad it ended like this though because I won't have to worry
about not getting enough sleep tonight! Thanks for your charitability, Kehlani. Now please pick
better deluxe tracks.

---

**SkyBlade79** (11): that production is SO GOOD OMG. That bass, the samples, just everything is amazing. The lyrics are so dark and it’s totally not in Kehlani’s brand. I adore how wistful and dreamy her voice gets during the chorus, and how fierce it gets in the verses.

**agentofscranton** (10): it’s weird that her best song wasn’t even technically from the album, but it’s a fucking great song and makes sense that it’s the closest thing she’s had to a hit

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay the menacing vibe whew

**cyborglilith** (10): fits with the Suicide Squad theme very well, like Medieval Warfare

**dropthehammer11** (10): oof this song is so smooth yet so HARD

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Skyler Grey wrote this bop, Kehlani manages to be sweet and sexy at the same time so wig!

**Leixander** (10): The song that got me into her! Suicide Squad was bad but its soundtrack was good!

**luuvin** (10): the giggle at the beginning makes my pussy quiver

**MashLuke** (10): my friends were obsessed with this song when it came out so it grew on me due to overexposure. I love it.

**jamesfog** (9.5): A Platinum-certified HIT!

**rocketgamer31** (9): This beat absolutely goes off, I remember I was shook when I heard this at the theater on those massive speakers. I'm not even mad she tacked this song onto the end of this already-inflated album, it's clearly one of the only good things to come out of Suicide Squad.

**awryj** (8.5): This song makes me want to engage in an abusive relationship, thx Kehlani

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Great spooky production, but let down by some crineg-y lyrics.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I didn't see Suicide Squad, but I'm going to assume this song is the best thing to come from it

**MrSwearword** (8): generous scoring for probably making sense for the soundtrack

**triptoyourheart** (8): The live performance of this was fire!

**banananaise** (7.5): i might have enjoyed this song more if it wasn't the nineteenth fukcing track

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I used to bop to it but kinda eventually lost interest

**Raykel** (7): ~edits a Suicide Squad Joker and Harley compilation vine~

**shineflyer** (7): it's pretty good, if you dissassociate it from the movie it's linked with.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Thank god I’m not rating this song by the quality of the film.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): okay but why the fuck was this damn album 20 songs long

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.8): I wish this track went somewhere, but it feels more like an atmosphere than a full song.

**c0ns3rvative** (5): honestly it's fine but it really does sound like a soundtrack song. overrated

**robbiec\_** (5): i think my feelings for the movie spill onto this song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): This is alright in itself but it just shouldn't be in this album at all.

**jess\_22** (4): I put off listening to this album for the longest time because of this song. I genuinely don't get the appeal... it's not good to say the least.

**BiPolarBear17** (3.5): This song just feels so ungenuine. Unlike the other deluxe edition track 'I Wanna Be' which suits the album perfectly, this simply feels like it was dropped in out of obligation cause it was a hit.

**eklxtreme** (3.5): this soundtrack was a mistake. idk how this got popular but i wish it didn't so she wouldn't have to put this on the album

**Nfranklin50** (3): why is everything associated with this movie so cringey

**sletrab07** (2): Sorry, Kehlani. I know it wasn’t your fault you got roped into this shitty, shitty film. I don’t entirely blame you for this song, but I have to drag you for it like you deserve. The lyrics are E D G Y and G R I T T Y and D A R K. The instrumentation is piss-poor. The vocals are uncharacteristically irritating. We’ll just pretend this never happened and move on with our lives. I still like your album, though.

**VeganSquash** (1.5): I don't like the pussy line, it feels so forced. And this is a weird song, like the chorus is okay but there's that weird noise in the background.

**whatareblackhole** (0): Kehlani is so much better than this

While some artists (look at my flair) [BRITNEY NOT BEYONCE] make a career out of sacrificing lyrical
integrity in their songs for a good and catchy beat, I like how SZA here does it for a change
compared to most of the other songs here. I just hope she doesn't do it too much in the future

---

**awryj** (10): THIS BEAT IS EVERYTHING. I feel like this song will be majorly robbed. Please do not rob this song. Thank you.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): “Do you even know I’m alive?”

**MrSwearword** (10): immersive as fuck

**Nfranklin50** (9): The intro on this song is probably my favorite part of the album. The Production is fikin gorgeous

**sletrab07** (9): The foot-stomping beat that comes in for the last 40 seconds hits me so hard. Unique pronunciation of the hook gives it staying power.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Do do you even know I’m alive? The thumping and bustling of this track is a welcome change to rest, and the rest of the song doesn’t slouch either. Its chant for attention, and self-awareness at what that entails makes this track a bit of a rehash of earlier songs, but the escapism sells it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): okay this is real cute

**MashLuke** (8.5): Love the production here

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Love her delivery in this one.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.3): I feel like this would have been better as an interlude as opposed Wavy, but I still think the production is cool.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): short but effective

**eklxtreme** (8): this is one of the more memorable instrumentals. the synths are really cool.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): that outro had me fucking SNATCHED

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): Another song that fits nicely with her earlier work. It’s a little repetitive sadly, tough the stomps at the end are great, but it’s probably the weakest point on the record.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): exceptional production and melodies, just not my favorite of the album

**cyborglilith** (7): wow who knew SZA would sing about poop when will your fave?

**jamesfog** (7): Kind of messy, but not in a bad way

**nooodisaster** (7): Short and has hooks

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Damn that outro got me hyped

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): This one really doesn't do anything for me tbh

**whatareblackhole** (6.5): The only filler song on the album

**shineflyer** (5.5): That ending was what the full song needed - some kind of consistent beat to drvie the song forward a bit more.

**SkyBlade79** (5): I like the drum beats at the end but that’s it

**nooodisaster** (11): I'm not even martyring for this to Intro, it's literally the best song in the rate. From the first second, we get the most daring production on this album with the robotic-acapella intro. Then it slips away into the most fucking cinematic verse where you can just feel the tension building as Tinashe waxes poetic about life and off-blue. AND THEN. The drop happens and we're thrown back to the beginning, except it feels like we're going at double speed. There's an exploding soundscape all around that feels like musical hyperspeed as we're carried off to the moon (literally). In 90 seconds, this song builds more than some entire albums, and has remained the most striking song on the album for me since the day I listened to it.

**cyborglilith** (10): shook

**Kaylaboe** (10): really wish this was longer

**MrSwearword** (10): at least this kept my attention; generous scoring

**SkyBlade79** (10): this is so pretty and awesome omg

**triptoyourheart** (10): Ugh why wasn't this a full song? Even Janet hasn't made an interlude as amazing as this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): why is an interlude better than SZA's entire album lmao

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.8): This would be a 10 if it was a full song.

**shineflyer** (9.5): I really wish they had made this more than an interlude, because for me, it's the coolest thing on the album thus far.

**1998tweety** (9.3): Wow I was not expecting this from an interlude

**eklxtreme** (9): feels so eerie and intense for an interlude

**whatareblackhole** (9): Always pulls me in and prepares me for…

**banananaise** (8): hmm darling this is NOT an interlude, interludes cannot bang like this

**jess\_22** (8): should have been longer :/

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): what

**personwithhair** (8): This has the potential to be a better than song 90% of the songs in this rate but it's a super shot interlude instead smh

**rocketgamer31** (8): Okay an interlude has no business being this good??

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Zodiac sign: A broken microphone

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): That was really good for an interlude.

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): Why are interludes always better than the actual songs?

**awryj** (7): google is tinasha ilaminaty

**dropthehammer11** (7): cool interlude m8

**rupull\_** (7): It's cute, I like the chorus and lyrics, the repitition and lack of verses is what's a bit off putting, but still very on brand for this album.

**jamesfog** (6.5): Nothing too special here... She snaps in the last 20 seconds tho.

**gannade** (6): this is a good interlude but the demonic first 20 seconds dropped it a few points

**sletrab07** (5.5): so D A R K and G R I T T Y

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Interludes are flops

**ImADudeDuh** (2): a useless interlude

Once again, Tinashe delivered pop perfection. The pre-chorus is heavenly and it's a really strong closer.

---
**jamesfog** (10): A damn GEM. Should've been a single!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): The best song in this album better make it to Day 3.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): really awesome production and inflection. The production sounds like it would be in a tove lo song tbh

**cyborglilith** (9): whose idea was it to put this song right after literal white noise? Anyway this is actually good.

**MashLuke** (9): Rachel Platten is shook

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Zodiac sign: Sagittarius

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): This song is fire

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.3): Good song but also she kinda sounds like Britney on the background vocals?!

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Such good production. Not really into the chorus but those verses are everything

**eklxtreme** (8): what is the bop doing at the end of the album damn. lyrics are kinda generic but the song is great.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): Rachel Platten is shook

**nooodisaster** (8): Kind of a random end to the album, but it works.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): Flame has been found fucking DEAD

**awryj** (7.8): I like it but the snare sound is so annoying, oh god

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): It’s okay for a closer, but followed by The Storm (Outro), Bated Breath would have been a stronger closer

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Queen of Flames.

**gannade** (7): demi remains unbothered but this is good

**sletrab07** (7): Yeah, the production could be less monotonous and the vocals leave much to be desired, but at this point I’m willing to take anything.

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): Nothing too special, but a decent way to end the album.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): verses are not good but the chorus makes up for it but yet this is still only a 5

**MrSwearword** (5): same type of "ambient&b" and just as mediocre

**rupull\_** (5): nothing special, nothing bad tho

**shineflyer** (4.5): idk what that squeeky sound in the background is but it's all i'm paying attention to

**jess\_22** (4): tinashe wyd putting this mediocrity on an otherwise stellar album?

**Leixander** (3): Sounds really generic, why is Tinashe wasting her talent with songs like this?

**VeganSquash** (0): sorry this is boring as shit

This was the follow up single to "2 On" and not only did it tank, it killed all the hype for the album. It's not a bad song at ALL, but it's not on par with the rest of the album to me. The A$AP feature does little for the song and it's just very generic IMO.

---

Is it just me or does anyone hear Rihanna in "Kiss It Better"
when she sings "can we pretend it's you"? Also… after hearing this in full for the first time, I can
only assume it's about fantasizing about taking her ex's dick when she's taking her current
man's dick. Also if there is a good rap verse on this album I'll be damned.

---
**BiPolarBear17** (10): Probably the biggest grower in the rate. Tinashe's voice sounds even greater than usual and the instrumental works wonders. Everything about this just works and for once there's a rap feature that actually elevates the track instead of downgrading it.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This should’ve been a single! The melody combined with the story in the lyrics makes it so bittersweet.

**Kaylaboe** (10): Another ethereal bop

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): One of the most beautiful songs on the album

**Zugtris** (10): pinpoint me a bitsy tinasha

**eklxtreme** (9.5): the production and that sweet melody in the chorus give it a very nostalgic vibe which definitely fits the song well

**triptoyourheart** (9.5): I used to not care for this but recently it's grown on me so much, maybe because I can relate to it a bit now.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Zodiac sign: Capricorn

**zaneylainy** (9): this. Is. vocal. Chemistry.

**MashLuke** (8.5): kinda sad but a sexy kind of sad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Imagine if they had a child.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): A$AP Rocky surprisingly does not ruin this song? This song is basically about pretending you’re having sex for the first time and Tinashe sells it pretty well.

**letsallpoo** (8): I was so sad when this flopped but in retrospect it was important for me to get used to her songs doing that

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): queen of roleplaying

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Don't really have any problems with this one, but it's kind of unmemorable tbh

**banananaise** (7): this reminds me of something but it's not remotely unique enough for me to even hope of figuring out what exactly i'm thinking of

**robbiec\_** (7): this is hot too

**whatareblackhole** (7): Wow, this song has not aged as well as I wanted it to

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Not the worst, just a little too slow and doesn't really go anywhere

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Lol whyyyy did she single the worst song on the album tho. The lyrics are actually interesting and unique, but the vocals and production give me Disney star at 16. Also it realllly didn't need a rap feature.

**shineflyer** (6.5): This song feels really sad. But it feels like it could have been really popular in 2009 or so.

**cyborglilith** (6): filler

**rupull\_** (6): The intro.... what is up with Tinashe that she just knows how to start and end her songs so meticulously and beautifully. Literally one of the best intros for a song i've ever heard and honestly it's the only thing that I can remember from this song... yikes.

**awryj** (5.5): filler

**sletrab07** (5.5): Can I just Pretend this album never existed?

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): she warned us Flame was coming with this song

**MrSwearword** (5): a Joan of Arc of a song; great idea, badly executed

**VeganSquash** (4.5): this doesn't go anywhere

**SkyBlade79** (4): boring and rocky adds nothing

deleted: People were bound to throw this criticism out there when you have an album from three years ago go up against two albums that were released this year. Aquarius doesn't really sound particularly dated anyway, the R&B landscape has not really changed that much in three years, and the production is a lot more daring than the other two as well (which is why I'm really confused on all the comments saying the album is boring).

A really nice ballad. I love it when ballads have more than a piano, and this is just it. It still has the R&B production of the previous tracks, and the lyrics are really gorgeous, especially the chorus. It has a 2 minute long fadeout, which kinda hurts its score, but it's great nonetheless.

---
**1998tweety** (11): Holy shit I feel like I just got baptized

**deltacall** (11): I gave this my 11 and I know it's not gonna win the rate or anything but I don't really care. This is one of my favorite songs of all time. The lyrics are devastatingly simple and powerful all at once. They way they flow with the instrumentals is such a ride. The conflicted feelings manifest themselves so eloquently throughout the course of the song. This is peak Tinashe and a testament to the talent she has and what she can do, and it's a shame that talent is so sabotaged today

**rocketgamer31** (11): This song is breathtaking, Tinashe did THAT. She serves vocals here, especially when she starts belting about halfway through the track. Shook

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the title is me waiting for Joyride

**luuvin** (10): whyyyyy does this have me so fucked up omg?? ??

**nooodisaster** (10): The most intimate song on Aquarius, and also the most believable to me. Long story short because I wrote about this on another rate, depression and unrequited love is a bitch and this song perfectly captures those feelings.

**triptoyourheart** (10): Tinashe went and made a ballad about being too stoned to tell her crush how she feels about him and she makes it the most heart-wrenching thing ever. Love this song so much, in my Top 5 songs of her ever, also should've closed the album instead of Wildfire.

**whatareblackhole** (10): With the Deep in the Night interlude preceding it, the vocals in this song are so emotionally stellar

**zaneylainy** (10): THIS SONG MAKES ME SO EMOTIONAL

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): I feel like this sums up everything good about this album: Experimental production, her vocal delivery, and strong storytelling in the lyrics.

**MashLuke** (9.5): This is so sweet

**awryj** (9): The "all along" part is definitely a highlight

**personwithhair** (9): Serving Dawn Richard poetry

**angusaditus** (8.5): vocal slayage but that outtro is too long

**eklxtreme** (8): wow vocals. I thought this was gonna be boring but it's quite nice with the subtleties in the production. would've been a nice closer.

**jamesfog** (8): A biT drawn out, but inoffensive

**robbiec\_** (8): hot

**sletrab07** (7.5): Oh damn, I enjoyed this one. Nice use of panning and the ambience is more than just mushy noise.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): a little too monotone for me

**banananaise** (7): her slow songs are good! what the fuck! who gave her the right

**dropthehammer11** (7): cool vocals but this is long

**Kaylaboe** (7): Slowing it down we have this ballad. It follows the ethereal, dreamy vibe of the album, but it doesn’t really stand out much.

**letsallpoo** (7): I thought I would hate the outro but then it snatched me and made up for her caterwauling moans in the actual song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Zodiac sign: Aries

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): It's ok but holy heck does it drag on forever.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): A little slow, but still nice. Her vocals are great too

**MrSwearword** (6): her vocals actually emote something but the production drags on and on

**VodkaInsipido** (6): why is this so long, it drags from the second minute

**jess\_22** (5): Tinashe's vocal abilities are showcased here but this song just does nothing for me, unfortunately

**shineflyer** (5): Nice and gentle, but I wish it had escalated into something.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): This song was long and tiring enough without an 8 miunte long video

**SkyBlade79** (4): kinda boring

**rupull\_** (3.9): Great for a car ride when you're not paying attention to what you're listen to. othar than that it's too slow and kinda boring...

**cyborglilith** (3): I guess this is relaxing but idk why it’s even on the album

**mirandacrocsgrove** (3): im bored also why tf is this 6 minutes long

**Elitefourbrad** (2): I fell asleep by accident oops

**Leixander** (0): I am… bored. The screams kinda seem emotionless and unnecessary. AND THIS SONG IS TOO LONG FOR NO REASON AT ALL AND I NORMALLY LOVE LONG PIANO-RIDDEN SONGS

**nooodisaster** (6): This song sounds of a basic bitch

**rocketgamer31** (6): This song drives me crzy sometimes

**Kaylaboe** (5): The «cree-aay-aay-aay-zy»-hook is catchy, but it gets quite grating quickly imo. I’d never guess that this was a single since there are much better tracks on the album, but the production is still solid.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): What I consider to be the most underrated track on the entire album. Garden is pure bliss, from the winding synths to the forest of percussion, to the absolutely stunning chorus. It’s almost tragic, as you can hear the doubt in her voice, and when she talks about herself (You know I’m sensitive about having no booty, having nobody, only you buddy, can you hold me when nobody’s around us?) it’s painfully real. The final product is a pensive, tragic, and desperate track that is perhaps the most vulnerable admission the entire album.

**deltacall** (10): The production on this is absolutely insanely good

**Elitefourbrad** (10): SZA is as vulnerable as ever here, calling out for your support. MY confident side is also unapologetic, body image isn’t everything. I get made fun of for having all of my weight go to my ass even though I only weigh 140.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): The line “hope you never find out who I really am/‘cause you’ll never love me” always makes me irrationally sad.

**Leixander** (10): You'll never love me, but I believe you when you say it like dat! Ahh such a great delivery.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): her voice is really cute on this

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): I thought this was one of the weaker tracks on the album when I first listened to Ctrl, but it was grown on me since release. The chorus is pure bliss, and thank you to Grandma SZA with some inspirational words at the end.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): queen of body positivity

**awryj** (8.8): that birthday song reference

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the voice alteration makes her sound more vulnerable and it adds to the emotion here. Great melody too.

**rupull\_** (8.5): Love the vocals that SZA brings here. Very raw but I have to say that this song sounds a bit dated. Like that outro is very 2010. Sorry SZA

**sletrab07** (8.5): Strong melodic writing (a consistent theme across the album) and that scalic riff heightens it above the rudimentary trap beats.

**cyborglilith** (8): better than dua lipa’s garden

**MashLuke** (8): I decided to give this an 8 on my second listening

**whatareblackhole** (8): I think this song is pretty, but I’ve never liked it that much.

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): Eh, not the best on the album, but not bad

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I like the beat, don't really care for the minute-long outro though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Smooooth.

**MrSwearword** (7): No T, No Shade Fergie did this better on "All That I Got (The Make-Up Song)"

**nooodisaster** (7): The top comment from genius.com: The song is crazyyyyy but how SZA gonna say she ain’t got no booty… Girl, u trippin' hahaha

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): dua lipa found dead?

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): it's not bad it's just kinda... there

**shineflyer** (4): I kinda want to like this for the lines addressing sensitivity about body image. But, musically, it didn't really click with me.

**SkyBlade79** (4): dua lipa outpeaked

**robbiec\_** (0): this is SZAoverload maybe some day it will grow on me but I just hate it in comparison to the rest of this album

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Wholesome.

God (Carly jswc) bless SZA for coming up with such a chill and lovelysounding
album closer

---

**agentofscranton** (10): the scary fact that I’m turning 20 next year is fucking me up to no end and this song is stupid relatable and is such a fucking fantastic way to close this album fuck me uupp sza

**deltacall** (10): A perfect song to listen to when you're driving home at 2 in the morning with your windows down

**Dono\_AGB** (10): Beautiful ending for the album.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Guys, it’s OK that you don’t know what you’re doing in life if you’re 20 something. You’re young, you still have time, don’t worry.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I feel like after a night of drinking I would listen to this while trying to fall asleep on someone’s couch and start crying.

**Kaylaboe** (10): Ending the same way we started - with just the humble guitar. I love the lyrics, they’re reflective and maybe a tab repetitive though, but it’s such a sweet ending to this phenomenal record. Mama SZA really sums up Ctrl the way we all wish we could.

**MashLuke** (10): the outro was so adorable and I really like the lyrics

**MrSwearword** (10): makes perfect sense to end on the same vibe as "Supermodel"

**Nfranklin50** (10): Ok honestly I thought this was one of the lesser songs on this album but let me tell you. On my 20th birthday I sat in an outback and just listened to this song for a couple hours and it was a sublime experience. There's so much emotion and sadness packed into this song and yeah I get it now.

**shineflyer** (10): Very pretty. It's the most relaxing track on the album for me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A soft, vulnerable album closer that strips away everything - both instrumentally and lyrically. She sings over a lone guitar, calling herself Miss 20 Something, and admitting to herself she has absolutely nothing to her name. It’s a haunting, genuine track, and perhaps the most beautiful one on the album. “Hoping my 20 somethings don’t end, hoping to keep the rest of my friends, praying the 20 somethings don’t kill me,” she sings, and it feels like the perfect summation of what it means to be 20 something. The final audio recording is absolutely stunning, and a perfect way to end the album. It’s nearly tearjerking, and a seriously powerful message in its own right.

**jess\_22** (9.5): i relate to this way too much

**nooodisaster** (9): We're back to the beginning, and just like that the album's good again. There's restraint and sadness, and it finally feels like we stepped back from the endless relationship. Great way to end the album.

**robbiec\_** (9): the god bless em is such a nice way to end this album

**whatareblackhole** (9): The little speech from her mom at the end…what a wonderful closer.

**angusaditus** (8.5): a cute closer

**eklxtreme** (8.5): very sweet and personal. this is one of the slower tracks that works well because it's completely stripped down and doesn't just have a slow drum machine on it

**sletrab07** (8.5): This is the perfect counterpoint to Supermodel with that inverted guitar intro. That run at “only no fear/wish you were here” is dick-slick siq. Also, her mum seems cool.

**Leixander** (7.5): Petition: Everyone in the world stays 20-29 years old until the end of universe.

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Why does this sound like Supermodel again though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Nice chill outro.

**gannade** (7): a boring closer compared to the rest of the album, kinda disappointing. this album was pretty top heavy

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): a cute ass outro

**banananaise** (6.5): lmao i was like "20 somethings? ha ha old people" and then i realised i was technically also a 20 something and i do have nothing to my name and i shed a single tear

**cyborglilith** (6): boring

**Raykel** (6): The song is boring but her voice is so soothing so it kinda works.

**SkyBlade79** (5): total snooze

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): sZZZa

I'm guessing what she's trying to imply here is that when she's havin a fuck
she feels he's giving the same performance to her man that Britney gives to her Piece of Me
audiences on a nightly basis. If that's the case then T needs to work on her sex game
#sorrynotsorry P.S. That's the last Britney reference for the rest of this album I promise

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.2): Tried to come up with a comment but this is just a really well-done song.

**dropthehammer11** (9): The woozy synths in the background are fuckin sick

**MashLuke** (9): a good sex song

**nooodisaster** (8.5): This song was a sleeper hit for me. It's very straight, so of course I hated it. However, you can really feel her excitement that her life is changing for the better. And getting over the straightness, the verses paint a vivid image that's slutty as fuck, so points.

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): I saw this described as a credits song and know I can’t forget that

**rocketgamer31** (7): I like the verses here but the chorus knocks it down a couple of points because it reminds me of a 5H song with how repetitive it is...

**shineflyer** (6.5): I don't know what Vegas feels like, but I guess it's good?

**Kaylaboe** (6): the pre-chorus in this is pure bliss, but overall this fails to wow me as much as most of the other tracks have. The chorus is just too repetitive really, and it comes off as a tad generic

**SkyBlade79** (6): bit too long and the male voice is so unneeded

**sletrab07** (6): The buildup shows so much promise, then it devolves into a shitty half-tempo, mushy fucking ambience of nothing. I find this album so aggressively mediocre, it’s starting to anger me at this point.

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Forgettable

**awryj** (5): The breakdown is the coolest part of the song, the rest is just boring

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Katy did Vegas better.

So smooth and laid back. I really love this track, it's a great introduction to the album and Tinashe and general, and despite some weak social commentary the mood and the rest of the lyrics make it a very powerful track.

---
**angusaditus** (11): it's eerie, atmospheric perfection

**jess\_22** (11): this might just be my favourite Tinashe song. The production still sounds fresh today and perfectly sets the mood for the rest of the album.

**triptoyourheart** (11): When I first listened to this album this track hit me like no other song ever has. It's an incredible opener for the album and really moves me in a way I can't explain fully. The production is minimal yet so beautiful. I love this song and in my Top 3 Tinashe songs ever (the other two are found on her other mixtapes).

**BiPolarBear17** (10): An atmospheric bop that opens up the album brilliantly.

**cyborglilith** (10): yes I love this mysterious intro

**dropthehammer11** (10): Wow this is a sick opener, hot damn. my non-existent pussy is doing things

**Kaylaboe** (10): Why are all the intros in this rate so good? An ethereal bop, so good no charts dare touch her

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): beautifully sets up the vibe of the album. queen of whispers, selena gomez is shook

**rupull\_** (9.5): I got ASMR from this once.

**ExtraEater** (9): a good sensual track that really eases you into the album. if this was a colour it could be either a thick, hazy orange or a foamy seagreen like the album cover

**VodkaInsipido** (9): great intro

**whatareblackhole** (9): Perfect introduction to the album, especially the ending where she whispers her welcome

**jamesfog** (8.5): A damn opener. Perfectly introduces the listener to Tinashe's world

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Queen of astrology, an excellent opener

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This opening song has me all hot and bothered

**eklxtreme** (8): dope vibes, great production

**luuvin** (8): I forgot how much this bangs

**MashLuke** (8): this left me incredibly unsatisfied, I can't describe it. Still good though

**nooodisaster** (8): This song is basically an overly long intro, but it puts me in a mooood. I wanna talk this shit to my man. "Simmer down, I know you're angry/I can make, make it okay"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Zodiac sign: Obviously an aquarius, lol

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): isn’t it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Pretty good intro. Very smooth. I feel like it doesn't really go anywhere though.

**awryj** (7.2): woke queen, katy wishes

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): a really nice can opener

**SkyBlade79** (7): ay I’m an Aquarius IRL. I like how delicate her voice is on this song.

**shineflyer** (6.5): Tinashe's vocals are angelic here.

**banananaise** (6): this is the dawning of the age of aquarius, the age of aquariuuuu-UUS

**Elitefourbrad** (6): I wish Tinasha gave this more oomph vocally, the chorus is great but it doesn’t have that big chorus. The trap beat and the deep bass go really well with Tinasha’s voice

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6): It’s fine, but this melody is not interesting enough to warrant the minimalist production.

**letsallpoo** (6): the way she suddenly says "the government" always throws me. i guess she invented being woke though

**MrSwearword** (5): great beat but her singing is thinner than my patience

**VeganSquash** (1.5): she's trying too hard to sound sexy

**sletrab07** (1): A truly lamentable opening to the album. Tinashe’s whispered vocals irritate me to no end. The “Aquarius” hook is especially punishing on the ears. The melody writing is incredibly weak on this track. Throw in a rudimentary trap beat and you’ve got yourself a paint-by-numbers sexy R&B track. “Welcome to my world.” Yeah, can I pls leave already, Tinashe?

You've practically given Tinashe low scores for all of her songs so how fair were you in this rate? Where is this trap beat you speak of, minimalist production is not trap. Every negative critique on this particular track seems like a gross exaggeration on your part, I can't imagine how whispering is that irritating to anyone, and I say this as a Selena Gomez hater.

deleted: This fucking bias by the SZA stans I knew it. Imagine thinking Aquarius is a bad album, let alone giving the title track anything less than like a 9. Maybe if the album got an 8.8 BNM from Pitchfork in 2017 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, an electronic R&B album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

deleted: let me vent ok I'm salty as fuck my 11 got kicked out right before Day 3 and I think there is some fuckery going on in the scoring because certain users have given Tinashe nothing but low scores for every song of hers so far.

deleted: Dude, SZA has one more song than Tinashe left lol. Also I think you might be giving Tinashe's production too much credit.

TragicKingdom1: ok but 2 On and All Hands On Deck are very likely winners still. Tinashe has been holding her own with very atmospheric midtempo stuff, so her slut bops are on track to do very very well. (Especially given 2 On is the biggest hit in the rate, and that's always a positive factor)

deleted: I hope to god Nightride is never rated by this sub because you don't deserve to rate another Tinashe album if this is how you're going to treat her.
