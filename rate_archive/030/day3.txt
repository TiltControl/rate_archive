No complaints, I vibe really hard on this one.

---
**MrSwearword** (11): introduced me to SZA at all and I'm considering this her GOAT

**robbiec\_** (11): I've cried at least twice to this song when the "oooh" starts I just feel my whole summer 2017 just sprawl out through my whole body and it makes me so EMOTIONAL like when I listen to this song I feel flesh against my arm, the feel of a certain sofa, a certain intensity of daylight or lack of and the heaviness in my throat that I've felt before again and again from listening to this fucking song it's just so relatable AND SIZZLER DID THAT TO ME WELL DONE BIH HERE IS MY ELEVEN YOU EARNED IT

**Elitefourbrad** (10): She’s trying to go with this love, but it’s non-moving and her effort is useless. I can really relate to this when I’m trying to go after a “straight” guy.

**Kaylaboe** (10): Queen of struggling with her work-life-balance! A broken clock is correct two times a day, but SZA will be right anytime. I love her vocals in this, and it’s just a superb track in general.

**Nfranklin50** (10): Honestly this slaps. it's relateable and it's got a groove that's so infectious and it's packed lyrically. It's a perfect song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Broken Clocks is another track that uses metaphor a great deal to highlight something that isn’t sung about that often in pop music. On the track, she equates the emotional abuse from long hours working to the time spent in a relationship. The song itself is super catchy, with one of my favorite choruses on the whole record, it’s a hell of a bop that never fails to impress, even when it slows down and fades out.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.6): I love the energy of this song.

**cyborglilith** (9): I always wait for the shitty news line and then it gets kinda boring

**eklxtreme** (9): very catchy and great storytelling

**rocketgamer31** (9): SZA serving vocals here, she sounds super smooth

**sletrab07** (9): I love that hook, it’s striking and distinctively memorable.

**rupull\_** (8.5): Good song.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Loving the production on this song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Good R&B.

**VeganSquash** (8): The metaphor of broken clocks was executed nicely.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): whew okay this distorted production i'm mildly gagged!

**MashLuke** (7): gross

**SkyBlade79** (7): pretty decent, and nice use of metaphors.

**whatareblackhole** (7): This song gets realllly repetitive for me, but it slaps.

**nooodisaster** (5.5): See my problem with this album is that at this point I feel like I'm just getting the same song over and over again. Being able to express your POV complexly and succinctly is a gift, and SZA definitely has it. The downside is that she was already able to express it in the very first song, and it's nine songs later talking about the same back and forth. Plz- don't- take- it- per-so-nal.

**angusaditus** (5): boring tbh

**shineflyer** (4.5): I like the distorted background vocals. At first, anyway.

nooodisaster: That comment was originally for "Anything", but on my re-listen I decided I liked "Broken Clocks" the least and decided to switch the comment over to that. And I stand by it; I listened to the album with Genius on the side, and while each song is about different things, for whatever reason by that point in the album they were starting to blur together lyrically for me. ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯

I guess this is the latest single on CTRL, as it's been moving up the charts and at the time I'm writing, it's sitting just outside the Top 40. It might be my favorite track on the album, the production isn't too different but the lyrics and delivery are really stunning. It tells a story about a man who cheats a lot and while it's not relatable, it's certainly affecting.

---
**1998tweety** (10): would've gotten the 11 if Tuna didn't snatch it

**cyborglilith** (10): yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas

**Elitefourbrad** (10): SZA is that side hoe that your man has on the side. She’s saying that her and the main hoe have their times scheduled to be with him, she will make an exception for him if needed. This also samples Justin Timberlake so wig!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Possibly the dreamiest sounding song ever made about being a side chick. This was almost my 11.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This smooth as FUCK and I'm so happy to see it climbing in the charts!

**MashLuke** (10): I like this song's theme

**Nfranklin50** (10): THE hoe anthem

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is the most developed track about being a side chick on the whole album, where SZA equates this to being custody - she plays both the main girl and the side chick, with the latter being “the weekend,” a systematic and unloving thing to be. The chorus is pure perfection, as is the instrumental. I can’t wait for the Solange-directed MV for this one.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Queen of getting a Top 40 hit without even releasing the song as a single. Godly outro btw.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): I love one part of this song, where SZA compares herself to a weekend with him, while his girlfriend is with him during the weekdays. That line also could have a deeper meaning: while he doesn’t enjoy his work (the weekdays, the other woman) and feels stressed about it, the weekend (her) are moments of relax. He enjoys more the moments he spends with SZA rather than with her girlfriend. As she says in “Love Galore” (got me looking forward to weekends), he looks forward to the weekend to be liberated.

**whatareblackhole** (10): God damn it, this album is so good.

**rupull\_** (9.9): My man is my man. My man is your man. From the California, to the New York Islands. From the Redwood Forests, to the Gulf stream waters. My man was made for you and me. ( In all honesty tho this is a near perfect song, I just hate that outro like... why is u here?)

**zaneylainy** (9.5): thot anthem

**Kaylaboe** (9): First of all, I can’t find a single word to accurately describe how amazing, show-stopping etc. the intro is. The sample is exemplary, the vibe is just stunning. I am however deducting it a point because after listening to this at least 24 times I still don’t really understand what the jarring «BRIGHT IDEAS» means. But another stunning song from the Stargirl.

**Leixander** (9): The beat in this! WHERE IS THE VIDEO SOLANA

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): whoa whoa whoa I was not expecting this slow jam. Love it

**awryj** (8): Savage and poetic, bravo SZA

**jamesfog** (8): A tepid hit

**robbiec\_** (8): not to me personally, but this song is so relevant to half of my friends at the minute because polyamory seems to be very popular right now

**rocketgamer31** (8): This instrumental gives me major throwback vibes

**sletrab07** (8): The middle of the album can start to blend into one song, but the chorus on this one helps it stand out.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): rebecca black is actually shaking

**VeganSquash** (8): very chill, but maybe too chill (like that terrible Nick Jonas song, Find You)

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): and we're back to me wishing this was an instrumental album

**nooodisaster** (6.5): The chorus is kinda, uh, bad, but the sentiment is entertaining.

**Raykel** (6.5): That ending should've been a whole other song. It would've been amazing.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (6): i didn’t even notice this was a different song now

**MrSwearword** (6): sometimes I wonder if SZA sings in non-sequiturs & this suggests, yes

**angusaditus** (5): I don't understand why this is so well liked, it's completely uninteresting imo

**BiPolarBear17** (5): This actually ends up being the weakest song on CTRL for me, mainly for 2 reasons: 1. The 30 second intro is fricking phenomenal which makes the rest of the track slightly disappointing and 2. Lyrically it just ends up being a side-hoe anthem which we really don't need anymore of. Technically SZA's left the lyrics 'open for interpretation', but the vast majority have latched on to it as some empowering side-hoe anthem, and side hoes ain't some systemically oppressed minority who need fun upbeat pop bangers to normalise their lives. Home-wrecking fucking sucks, so this gets a yikes out of 10 from me.

**eklxtreme** (5): instrumental is really punchy for a slow jam but otherwise, it's really slow

**shineflyer** (3): This is killin it on the charts, and good for SZA. But, I don't care for it. Like, at all.

**SkyBlade79** (3): don’t disrespect abel like this. WHY is this platinum?

thenshecamelikeaaah: This fucking bias by the Tinashe stans I knew it. Imagine thinking CTRL is a bad album, let alone giving the weekend anything less than like a 9. Maybe if the album got an 8.8 BNM from Pitchfork in 2017 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, an electronic R&B album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

Solid choice for a lead single but I feel like half the time I can't
understand what Travis is saying. Also, the video started out cool, with the butterflies and all,
but I don't get why Travis had to be killed in the end. 

---
**cyborglilith** (11): I love everything: the relaxing strings, SZA’s sultry delivery, the rap verse, and the ending.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): One of my favorite songs of the year. The beat is really good and both SZA and Travis do their part really well. That bridge is really nice too.

**VodkaInsipido** (11): Love Galore hooks the listener from the first second: the autotuned intro of Travis Scott and the almost whispered "love" of SZA leaves for a first verse of half-rapped, half-sung slow lines, with Travis’ ad-libs. But the gem of Love Galore is the pre-chorus. "Why you bother me when you know you don't want me?", she sings as the roll of hi-hats turns into a synth that does high and lows. "Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? Why you hit me when you know you know better?". SZA has a special pen for petty lines, and this is one of them. Love Galore might not be a political, defining or world-moving song, but it shines for what it accomplishes: being a song about being heartbroken, yet recovering and finding strength to talk about it.

**dropthehammer11** (10): Great track, production is great, SZA sounds beautiful

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This was the song that introduced me to SZA, and boy was it one of her best. The chorus and the trap beat go so well together. Travis has a great verse about creampies so that’s interesting I guess? Anyways, this is why SZA is the Newcomer of the Year in my book.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of the best top 40 hits of 2017

**Kaylaboe** (10): I absolutely love the production in this. It’s very trap-y and tropical, which makes it a perfect fit for the zeitgeist, yet it’s different and unique enough to stand out. SZA’s vocals are absolutely stunning, and my personal fave is the Do it for fun / Don’t take it personal, baby / Love on my ladies, luh-love to my ladies-bit. And I’m super glad Travis finally got to plant some seed into Kylie!

**Leixander** (10): Travis brings the song down a little but SZA's verses and the chorus is just perfection

**MashLuke** (10): it makes me want to have casual intercourses

**MrSwearword** (10): SKRRT SKRRT ON BEECHAZZ WHO DON'T SCORE THIS HIGH

**Nfranklin50** (10): I remember hearing this for the first time while everyone was freaking out about it. I barely knew who SZA was and the song was just ok on first listen. Then I listened again and it got better. and then I listened again and it fricking BUMPED and it hasn't stopped since that day

**robbiec\_** (10): seedboi

**rupull\_** (10): There is a reason that this is her most popular song, it is so perfect and lovely even though the chorus is just her saying "love" I still don't get tired of it. And, her and Travi$ really blend so well together and nothing ever feels out of place in this song it all feels right.

**sletrab07** (10): Would’ve given this my 11 if the chorus was just a little meatier. I live for that woozy synth coming in @ “Why you bother me when you know you don’t want me?”

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Easily the best collab on the album, and a possible 11 contender. SZA is absolutely flawless on this track, a somber and hazy display of her lyrical prowess and dynamic flow. The instrumental is lush and flawlessly chill. It’s infectious, but it’s hard to pin down any one line that sticks out for me because the whole thing is solid (although the chorus is damn catchy, if complicated). Then, when Travi$ Scott comes in, it’s a surprisingly fitting verse, almost a foil to SZA (or perhaps playing the man she’s talking about). The outro is soft and slowed down, and the perfect endcap to an already perfect track.

**whatareblackhole** (10): UGH UGH UGH I LOVE THIS SONG

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.7): I love the rhythmic elements of SZA's melodies; she knows how to incorporate hip-hop sounding cadences into her songs.

**BiPolarBear17** (9): Unfortunately I can't give the album all 10s, so I had to find reasons to dock songs marks. This anthem ended up getting a point deducted from it on account of Travis Scott threatening to plant his seed inside me.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): I really like her vocals during the chorus here

**awryj** (8): This chorus is such an earworm

**nooodisaster** (8): There's hooks everywhere, and I'm down for that. Not as down for the random outro tho. Fun fact: When I first heard "I need, I need" I thought it was sampling Guilt Trip and got so excited for a second.

**SkyBlade79** (8): this song isn’t amazing but I LOVE Travis, especially when he gets loud. It’s lit!

**triptoyourheart** (8): The Travis Scott verse has really ruined part of the song for me because of the whole Kylie Jenner pregnancy thing now. It makes my skin crawl so I gotta deduct a couple points. Such a shame too since this song is otherwise one of the best of the year.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): I like the build-up of the instrumentals but not my fave

**zaneylainy** (6): low key overrated, dont hate me

**jamesfog** (5): It's cute, I guess... Pretty boring tho. Don't know how it was a hit.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.5): i expected more

**angusaditus** (4): first song I heard from SZA and it made me not want to listen to her ever again. Evntually I gave in cause she was so hyped, but this song remains ugly

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): i once saw a tweet that says "Travi$ Scott sounds like a computer virus" and that's all i can think of lmao. im torn bc the production is nice but again, i just... cannot get into her voice for a whole song and it's distracting

**shineflyer** (4): everyone says this is great but idk i'm just not feeling it. I'm not a fan of Travi$'s ya's in the background either.

**VeganSquash** (2.5): I've never liked this song because it's too dark. I don't know.

**eklxtreme** (0): travis scott should never be on a slow song. kinda wish there was more to this.

This fucking bias by the Tinashe stans I knew it. Imagine thinking CTRL is a bad album, let alone giving the weekend anything less than like a 9. Maybe if the album got an 8.8 BNM from Pitchfork in 2017 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, an electronic R&B album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

**Background:**

SZA *(Self Savior, Zig Zag Zig, Allah in the [Supreme Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Alphabet))*, born Solána Rowe, is the woman I’m going to talk about today. Her, and her debut album, *CTRL*, my second album of the year behind Lorde’s Melodrama. At barely 26 years old, her life has taken a lot of turns: from being a gymnast to working with Beyoncé and Rihanna to being a model for Ivy Park to being a neo-soul superstar. Born in St. Louis, from a black-muslim family, she only could listen to one genre of music in her house: jazz, with the artists her father played, like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday or Louis Armstrong. This would mark the jazzy production on *CTRL*. Other of her influences would be given by one of her friends, in a Bar Mitzvah: she got gifted a CD mixtape with Red Hot Chili Peppers, LFO and Macy Gray, what she called *emo sad white rich kid shit*. She loved it.

But that isn’t everything; one day her old brother gave her an iPod. On it, she found artists that completely broke with the styles of music she was accustomed to: Wu-Tang Clan, Björk, Common, Mos Def, Nas and Jay-Z. Her brother (Manhattan) also introduced her to music: when she was 19, he asked her to do backing vocals for one of his songs, [*Where Do We Go?*](https://soundcloud.com/urlbadman/sza-where-do-we-go-unreleased).

Fast forward a year: SZA self-releases her debut mixtape *See.SZA.Run*, which included the single [Time Travel Undone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBQuo-zJX98). Later in 2013, she signs to TDE and releases an EP, S. Then in 2014 she released another EP, Z, including the songs [Child’s Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqL8X-VzG8) featuring Chance the Rapper and [Babylon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXDOcZLmrKU) featuring Kendrick Lamar. Some writing credits with Beyoncé and Nicki, some others with Travis Scott and ScHoolboy Q, a feature with Jay Rock, and we get to the first big jump: Rihanna’s Consideration.

[Consideration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhlCLARky1s) is the intro track to the 2016 surprise-released Rihanna album, Anti. Well we don’t know if it was a surprise, but Tidal fucked up. SZA had previously spoken about Rihanna in a series of tweets calling her and Ciara out, but they became friends after. Consideration could be considered SZA’s first step into mainstream, [especially thanks to that BRITs performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQWqksdE4gw). To the track, SZA does the post-choruses and the outro. They are beautifully written, and SZA’s voice does a beautiful contrast with Rihanna’s.

>*When I look outside my window*  
*I can't get no peace of mind*  

It’s a pessimistic line, evoking a moment of sadness. The picture of people looking at the window is constant in movies and shows, waiting for something to come or happen. But when SZA looks at the window, she can’t see nothing positive. Those two lines could condense SZA’s lyrical skills.

Wait I got distracted midway through because I was looking on Tumblr at how
happy Britney and Tinashe looked working on "Slumber Party" together and I don't feel like
restarting the song but it's actually very well put-together and for sure has a place on day 2 at
least


---

**BiPolarBear17** (10): For the most part, the songs on the album start to blend into each other and lose their identity, and at times it feels like the running order of the tracks just wasn't thought about at all. Advice is probably the biggest exception to this, as it's the perfect follow-up to Everything Is Yours. This track shines brightly, and it's got such an uplifting, warm aura to it that surrounds you. On one hand this track makes me want to cry, yet on the other hand it makes me feel like there are so many brighter days ahead.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song feels so triumphant given everything Kehlani’s been through (PND suuuuuuucks). It also has one of my favorite pre-choruses ever.

**jess\_22** (10): this hits close to home

**Kaylaboe** (10): This song feels like blessing after three/four rather weak, fillery tracks. The production is lush and airy, and it really manages to elevate Kehlani’s voice to another level.

**triptoyourheart** (10): This track will be sooooo underrated I feel! The chorus is so light and airy and makes me feel so happy every time I listen to it!

**VeganSquash** (10): this song is so good that Taylor put it on her playlist

**Zugtris** (10): an absolute uppercut right when i thought this was taking a turn for the worse! p.s. hm it still did x

**cyborglilith** (9): first song I listened to on the album which made me think kehlani has no personality (I still think this)

**rocketgamer31** (9): You know what advice Kehlani should follow? Dua's rules. Also to make more songs like this because this is one of the highlights for me.

**shineflyer** (9): This is the kind of thing I like - pretty, but it stays in motion, moving forward.

**whatareblackhole** (9): Yas, Kehlani, serve me some vocals!!

**eklxtreme** (8.5): such sweet vibes on a very personal and reflective song. the production is very 2000s!

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This song sounds so hopeful. Definitely doesn't sound as dark as some of her other songs

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Those claps girl yas!

**MashLuke** (8): Practice what you preach

**nooodisaster** (8): Yasss bitch. "How is the man of my dreams/not a man of his words?"

**awryj** (7.7): nice wholesome bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A little better, but still slow. Instrumental is really nice though.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): Another slow one. They're decent but I just don't know if they really hold any replay value.

**SkyBlade79** (6): very cute

**MrSwearword** (4): subpar and doesn't do anything for me

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): my advice is stick to more upbeat songs bc this is kinda bland

**Review:**

>*That is my greatest fear, that if, if I lost control, or did not have control, things would just, you know, I would be… fatal.*

[**“Supermodel”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tiixq9rT_J0), the first track in SZA’s debut album *CTRL*, starts with these lines. They’re not spoken by her, but by her mother. SZA explained what control is for her in a [Genius interview](https://youtu.be/viHCYBWuizk): 

*“I have no control, there is no such thing as control. I’m chasing control. I’m craving control. I’m losing control. It’s a culmination of all these things, of this word, of this concept, that’s just run my life for so long, that’s just been very obsessive. [...] Like, ‘No, don’t put out an album until you’re a better writer.’ And the truth is, sometimes you just have to let go."*

We chase control in our lives. For many, our life goal is being with someone we love, in a pretty house, with a job we enjoy. But sometimes things don’t work out like that. Supermodel talks about SZA having a boyfriend, who heads to Vegas on Valentine’s Day. She later receives a call from one of his friends: they all had a orgy that day. This line feels like a bomb in a first listen:

>*Let me tell you a secret*  
*I been secretly banging your homeboy*  
*Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?*  

SZA spits the lines over the looped chords of an electric guitar, the only beat of the song until the second minute, where some drums kick in. If he can cheat on her, she cheats on him. In an [interview with The Breakfast Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwOIBNYIiBI), she revealed that after getting that call she started to go after one of his boyfriend’s friends, who she had a crush on. She uses the **second** and first person to end the verse:

>***Oh no she didn't***  
*Oh yes I did*  
***Oh no she didn't***  
*I'll do it again*  

This showcases the surprise of his boyfriend, the second person, to the indifference of her. She will do it again, just to hurt him more if it’s necessary. But at the same time, she isn’t comfortable with her new… Boyfriend? FWB? At all, SZA isn’t comfortable with a man, but she can’t be alone:

>*Why I can't stay alone just by myself?*  
*Wish I was comfortable just with myself*  
*But I need you, but I need you, but I need you*  

That’s a feeling many have. Even if it hurts, you need to be with someone. At the end, one needs to love itself, and move on. But instead, SZA breaks up with her boyfriend to move on with his friend:

>*That's why I stayed with ya*  
*The dick was too good*  
*It made me feel good*  
*For temporary love*  
*You was a temporary lover*  

Still, she has insecurities she can’t let go. She looks for attention, but instead of love, only gets sex back. But it’s not bad for her, that still makes her feel good. And the chorus repeats again, going back to the *wish I was comfortable just with myself* lines, but this time it doesn’t apply to her old boyfriend, but to her new temporary lover. She went from a toxic relationship to another one. Sometimes, that person you love doesn’t love you as much, and that house you wanted for your future family won’t be bought. At the end, Supermodel becomes an hymn about letting go. About not being dependant of others. About getting over your insecurities. About being comfortable with yourself.

---

Then, [**“Love Galore”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHXfCOjb3fk) does a flash-forward. The second single of *CTRL* becomes a flash-forward from Supermodel. It starts with an intro sung by Travis Scott, that goes by *I need, I need* several times, to which SZA’s chorus replies *love, love*. While he doesn’t know what he wants (sex, love, a family), SZA is sure about her ideas: as long as they have love, they’ll be fine.

But, Love Galore has a special line that hits in the pre-chorus:

>*Why you bother me when you know you don't want me?*  

It’s a relatable sentiment. How many times has someone avoided talking with you after they started talking? In an era of digital communication where you can get everything through Twitter and talk with anybody, ignoring someone is easier than ever. Face to face, you can’t just leave running and have an excuse. Ask a girl, she’ll tell you about how she has fifteen guys texting her but none has asked her on a date. In any other context this line would feel pretty conservative, but on SZA’s words it works out. Then, the second line hits:

>*Why you bother me when you know you got a woman?*

Now ask the same girl as before, and she’ll tell you about how half of those guys had a girlfriend and just wanted her to be either a side chick or a plan B. The whole pre-chorus is an oxymoron to the first verse, which talked about a temporary love (just like Supermodel), a *summer fling*, but now talks about taking any opportunity to be with her lover:

>*I be looking for ya*  
*Got me looking forward to weekends*  
*With you baby, with you baby*  
*[..]*  
*We do whatever we want, go wherever we want*  
*Love however we want, it don't matter*  
*You'll do whatever I want, get whatever I want*  
*Get whatever I need, it's about (love, love)*  

The last two lines mark a huge change in the song: they might be playing, but now it’s her time to play with him. She wants him, but at the same time she is the one who will decide over him. The one who will leaver her on read. But then you have the gorgeous outro:

>*I came to your city, lookin' for lovin' n' licky*  
*'Cause you promised to put it down*  
*All up in your city, lookin' for you, uh*  
*Searchin' for you like love*  
*Only thing keepin' me from droppin' you right now*  
*Right now, love*  
*Only thing keepin' me by your side*  
*Only thing keepin' me by your side now*  

Go back to the same girl you talked with before. Has she been ghosted? Ever? Probably. Maybe the guy got a cold, maybe he was at a party, maybe he just forgot. SZA explains it once again to [Genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr5V6muCJR8):

*The outro is the telltale story of you be in the area. You said you wanted to do all these things. Like, you wanted to spend time and, you know, talked a good one. Via whatever. Via text, via on the phone, and then you go ghost. That’s happened to so many girls. [...] But, I have been in a place where I felt like I liked somebody and I couldn’t say what I wanted to say. So you just end up being quiet. Like, the whole time, in this place where the other person is. It could be a city, it could be a proverbial city. It could be a room. It could be a party.*

Love Galore is as a whole an anthem to digital love, in the good and the bad side. It’s a song that empowers to dump the guys who just want side chicks, to get out of toxic relationship, to recognize what’s wrong with you and your lover.

 I know this isn't gonna win but it's quite a refreshing introduction to the album,
giving listeners a good idea of what to expect, I hope. Also the video is very cool and I like how
it incorporates princess imagery rather than supermodel-type. Not sure why there's a scene
with firecrackers at the end though.

---
**agentofscranton** (11): the ‘leave me lonely for prettier women’ line is so deeply resonant with me (despite being a 19 year old boy but whatevs)

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Everything about this is just so raw, from the lyrics where she spills her heart out regarding her shitty ex, to the gloomy guitar chords which form the entire instrumental. She took a humongous risk with this track, especially with it being the album opener yet it payed off because this song is everything and more.

**c0ns3rvative** (10): what an opener, sprase yet effervescent production that warmly envelopes confident and anxious vocals

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song is so simple yet still captivating even with just her voice and the guitar. I think that speaks a lot to her songwriting.

**Kaylaboe** (10): I adore this track. The instrumental is simple and the guitar is just gorgeous. The focus is instead placed on the lyrics, and with GOAT-lines such as: Why am I so easy for you to forget like that / I can’t be that easy for you to get like that, we already get a quick introduction to the lyrical themes of Ctrl. A perfect way to start this masterpiece of an album.

**luuvin** (10): "prettier women"???? i think the mirror in the video was added in post production cos clearly sza ain't seen herself in one...

**MrSwearword** (10): song title makes no sense but this song slays throughout

**Nfranklin50** (10): the only problem that i have with this song is that it's darn relateable and so darn not relateable. There's so many people who I just want to believe I can be their supermodel but also highkey can't relate to fucking her homeboy on valentines day weekend so you know you take what you can get. Amazing song tho

**robbiec\_** (10): the "if you belieeeeeeve" I felt that then the "SEEEE IT INNN ME" I FELT THAT

**rupull\_** (10): Great opening, sets the tone for the whole album which is something that these girls really know how to do well. Plus that music video is so good I totally get everything that she wanted to say in this song. Perfect

**VeganSquash** (10): amazing lyrics

**VodkaInsipido** (10): The line ‘I’ve been fucking your homeboy while you were in Vegas’ is the most hard-hitting of the year.

**whatareblackhole** (10): I love this song. Great opener.

**cyborglilith** (9): the repetitiveness makes this sound like an intro/interlude but dat production tho

**Elitefourbrad** (9): SZA is telling her man that he isn’t giving her enough attention. She could be his supermodel, but only as long as he’s with her. Also queen of banging homeboys.

**nooodisaster** (9): "Let me tell you a secret/I been secretly banging your homeboy". THAT is how you start an album! In three minutes, SZA paints us her dysfunctional relationship, mindset, lyrical style, and aesthetic, all in complex detail.

**sletrab07** (9): A terrific intro, with captivating lyrics and attention-grabbing vocals. My only wish is that the kit groove lasted a little longer (maybe a bridge).

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The first track on this album is a sunny, savage opener that sets the stage for the rest of the album, and has some pretty great lyrics (Let me tell you a secret, I been secretly banging your homeboy). It’s a great opener and a great introduction to a great album.

**awryj** (8.8): u can be my supermodel sza

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): A chill opener and does well to establish the mood of the album

**dropthehammer11** (8): A stripped back, honest intro

**Leixander** (8): an iconic intro, Intro(of My Everything) by Ariana Grande who?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): wow ended tyra banks

**eklxtreme** (7.5): works as a decent chill intro. the subtleties are nice.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): It's a pretty good intro but it does end up being one of the least memorable songs in the album.

**MashLuke** (7): it's nice but that's about it

**banananaise** (6.5): i'm always here for mellow guitar hiphop

**DraculaWeekend** (6): The drums were nice. Overall this song was pretty muted for an intro

**shineflyer** (5.5): Minimal until the very end, but chill. Also, Pharrell, what the fuck was that ending lol

**jamesfog** (4): Not a big fan of the guitar

**SkyBlade79** (4): meh, nothing special. Production is really annoying.

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): holy shit this is... a really unfortunate way to start an album. she doesn't have the voice to carry something this stripped back, and something about the weirdly vibrating production lowkey hurts my ears. the drums near the end are nice but that's about it

VodkaInsipido: part 3/4

---

>*Fearin' not growin' up*  
*Keepin' me up at night*  
*Am I doin' enough?*  
*Feel like I'm wastin' time*  

[**“Prom”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAgzfcWAlTo), the fifth track, is a come back to the sound of her old mixtapes, doing disco-pop that many other popstars could have done. It’s teen angst, but late teen angst: prom season is coming of age, growing apart, and looking forward to the future. All of this happens while SZA sings about not maturing as fast as her boyfriend:

>*Please don't take it, don't take it personal*  
*Like I know you usually do*  

While he is caring with her, she just can’t give back. She just isn’t ready for a relationship. One of my favourite lines on the song is at the end of the second verse:

>*To run and hide out somewhere*  
*So far away*  
*Hoppin' through poppy fields*  
*Dodgin' evil witches*  
*These houses keep droppin' everywhere*  

Which is a reference to The Wizard of Oz. SZA likes to reference movies in her songs, like Forrest Gump in “Doves In The Wind” or Misery in the “Love Galore” video. Those evil witches are those mean girls and high-school, and the houses are her possible futures: what career to choose, who to settle down with… and just as with The Wizard of Oz, what matters in high-school is the journey, not the ending; the friends and experiences you make along the way, not going to university.

Prom feels like a song stuck in a 90’s movie: after the couple leaves town in their convertible, the song starts to play as the camera does an aerial shot of the car far away, driving through the country roads, and then the credits kick in. Maybe it could be the ending of the album, but instead it rolls out to “The Weekend”.

And then there is “The Weekend”.

---

>*You say you got a girl*  
*How you want me?*  
*How you want me when you got a girl?*  

[**“The Weekend”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PALMMqZLAQk) starts as every other SZA song, or that’s what many people say: she is a side-chick in a relationship with a man who already has a girlfriend. These lines are from her perspective, facing his partner. The first verse follows:

>*Of knowin' it's selfish*  
*Knowin' I'm desperate*  
*Gettin' all in your love*  
*Fallin' all over love, like*  
*Do it 'til it hurts less*  

She desperately looks for his attention, trying to love him enough to make him dump his girlfriend and be with her. The irony of the last line is how even if he broke up with the other woman, and SZA became his girlfriend, the man would keep on cheating her with another woman. It will hurt less to be with him, sure, but he still won’t be only hers.

>*Hanging out the back, all up in your lap*  
*Like is you comin' home?*  
*Is you out with her?*  
*I don't care long as you're here by*  
*10:30, no later than*  
*Drop them drawers, give me what I want*  


The lines are self-explanatory. She went from not caring about the other woman to worry about his relationship with her. But still, she doesn’t care as long as she gets sex. Then you get one of the most beautiful chorus this year:

>*My man is my man is your man*  
*Heard it's her man too*  
*[...]*  
*Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday*  
*I just keep him satisfied through the weekend*  
*You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend*  
*Make him lose his mind every weekend*  
*You take Wednesday, Thursday*  
*Then just send him my way*  
*Think I got it covered for the weekend*  

Where she compares herself as a weekend with him, while his girlfriend is with him during the weekdays. This line also could have a deeper meaning: while he doesn’t enjoy his work (the weekdays, the other woman) and feels stressed about it, the weekend (her) are moments of relax. He enjoys more the moments he spends with SZA rather than with her girlfriend. As she says in “Love Galore” *(got me looking forward to weekends)*, he looks forward to the weekend to be liberated.

>*I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that*  
*I mean I'm saying what kind of deal is two days?*  
*I need me at least 'bout four of them*  
*More of them, more of you on me*  
*On us, just tell me you want me, yeah*  

In the second SZA starts to argue about the arrangement her and the girlfriend did: while one gets 5 days, the other only gets 2.

>*Monday and I'll be at your door*  
*Ready to take her place*  
*Ready to give you*  
*What you've been missin' on weekdays*  
*What you've been waitin' for*  
*10:30, no later than*  
*Drop them drawers, I know what you want*  

Now SZA breaks her arrangement, and decides that she wants the man all for her. One of the most interesting parts is how the last line also references the last line of the first verse: instead of *give me what I want* now it’s *I know what you want*, showing that now she wants to take control of the relationship. Another chorus goes, and then an outro.

What a good song, right? The thing is, to see what makes it great you need to switch the view on the song. “The Weekend” isn’t sung from one perspective; [it’s sung from two](https://twitter.com/sza/status/884145088187834369). Both the side-chick and the girlfriend. And not just one side-chick, [but two](https://twitter.com/sza/status/884014672139001856). And if you go back to the [Breakfast Club interview](https://youtu.be/LwOIBNYIiBI?t=8m49s) I put around Supermodel, you’ll see she mentions how she talks from both perspectives:

*A lot of these songs have dual meanings. I’m speaking from the girlfriend and from the other perspective. Like I’ve been the girlfriend that didn’t know and I’ve been the girl that didn’t know you had a girlfriend.*

So at the end of the day, SZA isn’t the side-chick. She is the girlfriend, but sings from both perspectives. In some verses you can’t tell who is singing, like in the one that references home. It’s overall a very interesting song, where unless you get some context you’ll just say that *it’s just good*, where narratives matters.

This is by far my favorite Tinashe song and one of my favorite songs in general. It's only right that it's her favorite song on the record as well, since it's a perfect showcase of her talent. She belts, whispers and raps and the production is mindblowing as well. I love the beat switch. This whole track is genius tbh.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (11): gorgeous, amazing, moody. production sounds fresher than anything on the other 2 albums despite being almost half a decade older. when it all switches up near the end? wig flew!

**cyborglilith** (10): listented 2 this & bet like 4ever and still don’t remember what they sound like

**jess\_22** (10): this is the greatest hook in existence, fight me

**rupull\_** (10): The hidden bop that should've been a single (I will never forgive Tinashe for that) honestly tho this wouldve been at least a top 20 hit. Great production, good lyrics, good vibe.

**whatareblackhole** (10): Holy fuck, undoubtedly one of the best electronic R&B songs I’ve ever heard

**Kaylaboe** (9): Despite being almost half a minute shorter than Bet, Cold Sweat somehow feels longer. While the instrumental is immaculate, and the song changes tempo at the end, it just doesn’t feel as varied.

**SkyBlade79** (9): oh my I’m feeling things. It’s SO SMOOTH

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Her voice is anything but cold here.

**awryj** (8): Ok I kinda love it. Queen of falsetto, raspy singing and rapping

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This song has me in a cold sweat tbh

**eklxtreme** (8): really cool production that does the night time style really well

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): I really like her vocals on this song.

**MrSwearword** (8): she's not bad here but this is dragging on

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Invented sex?

**banananaise** (7.5): hmmm yes this is.... sex

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): i can fuck my hand to this. its a bit long tho

**jamesfog** (7.5): Kinda forgettable

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Songs about the industry rarely hit with me. Idk why. But there's enough bop-ness, that I can almost get down to it. On one hand, she's a savage; on other hand it's 5 minutes long.

**robbiec\_** (7): h a w t

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Zodiac sign: Virgo

**VeganSquash** (6): the last two minutes are great, but the rest is super boring

**Elitefourbrad** (3): This song made me sweat because of how bad and how long it was.

**shineflyer** (3): feels a bit filler to me

**sletrab07** (0): Oh, what’s this? ANOTHER dark, introverted track?! Fkn groundbreaking. OK, so let’s run down our checklist: Tinashe can’t whisper-sing well, she doesn’t have an interesting singing voice and her rapping is limp as a dick. Holy shit, that last verse is so cringe, when she calls out her fake friends. Like, we get it, you went through what literally every famous musician goes through, only you had to go and write yet another verse full of insipid bullshit. Your album is hella scummy, bitch. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET THROUGH THIS ALBUM?! fuck you Tinasha, you made me loathe your album by track 3, congrats.

VodkaInsipido: the end of a saga

---

>*That's me, Ms. 20 Something*

[**“20 Something”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azqv46WFxZE), starts over some subtle guitar chords. It doesn’t sound like something special, but it is because it’s the first time in the whole album since Supermodel a guitar really stand out. It makes it sound like a bonfire song, and the harmonies in the chorus reinforce that feeling. It’s a campfire song, and just like “Prom”, it’s a song about being stuck but wanting to grow up. While “Prom” situated SZA at the end of high-school, “20 Something” is somewhere in her twenties, maybe finishing college, maybe right now. And while “Prom” was teenage angst, “20 Something” has a feeling of... matureness. SZA sings a beautiful chorus that sums it up:

>*Stuck in them 20 somethings, stuck in them 20 somethings*  
*Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings*  
*But God bless these 20 somethings*  
*Hopin' my 20 somethings won't end*  
*Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends*  
*Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me, don't kill me*  

Who hasn’t been told ‘good luck with that’ at any stage of his life? High-school, college, and then those *twenty-somethings*. A moment where you have to act mature, but you aren’t mature enough for some things. Mature enough to party all night and be responsible of your own acts, but not enough to settle down and buy a house. Some want to be stuck in the former, some look forward to the latter. But as she says, *’God Bless these 20 Somethings’. It’s a stage of life that as any other you have to enjoy and live as you want. Don’t look at the future as something perfect, and try to do the best in the time you have. You need to make your way out of the twenties, stand out, but at the same time it’s necessary to spend those years having fun and being happy. And that’s hard.

Finally, the outro to *CTRL* is a phone call with SZA’s mother, once again:

>*And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the alternative is an abyss, is just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about control, and that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it.*  
***That was beautiful mommy, that was perfect.***

And this is what connects “Supermodel” to “20 Something”, what connects *CTRL*. A phone call from which we only know the start and the end. Those are two points of a story, the story of SZA’s mother, and you can connect them however you want. That’s what shines in *CTRL*, the skill of making songs that people can relate to. Maybe it’s not the same story they have lived, maybe it’s not their story at all, but it sure is one you can feel that has happened, to SZA and to many other people.

*CTRL* isn’t a perfect album, neither it has a perfect message. It isn’t free of contradictions (first I need you, but now I don’t need nobody) but *CTRL* doesn’t pretend to be an album of  self-help since the lyrics can’t be more full of guilt, low self-esteem and self-embarrassment. As the title suggests, the control SZA assumes sometimes works and other times, just like a keyboard key, doesn’t. This is SZA’s reality, the one of a ‘twenty-something’ woman, and also many other girls’, who will come to this album not to find answers to their questions but to comfort themselves in the experience a person like them had to suffer and later found the strength to tell.

---

SZA has been called everything in the five years that separate the release of her first mixtape to today. The saviour of female R&B, the female Frank Ocean, the next big popstar, the new Beyoncé. Comparisons are never good, but maybe this time they are. If I wrote this review like this, focusing more on the lyrics than the production (when I prefer production most of the time), it’s because SZA has those lyrical skills that make her stand out. She is a storyteller, and maybe some people compare her with Frank Ocean for that. *CTRL* is an album full of stories, from falling out of love to parties to growing up, and she tells them all fantastically.

And maybe she is the next big popstar. In a year with few to no female #1s (Taylor, Cardi and Halsey as a feature), pop needs a new star. One with attitude, that is able to make hits and at the same time amazing albums. For me, it’s torn between Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello or Dua Lipa, but SZA is a big contender. She’s had a top 30 single, and her first album debuted at #3 (behind Kendrick Lamar and Katy Perry tho) with 60k copies, half of them pure sales. She has gone on a big Europe tour with Bryson Tiller, [got a cover on Billboard](http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/1024x577/public/video/1125911414_5618123982001_5618101036001-vs.jpg) and has been working with Kevin Parker (Tame Impala) and Mark Ronson in an album. She has a top 10 hit with Maroon 5. And on top of all, she got 5 nominations for the Grammys this year. Her becoming a star is all a possibility, of course, but SZA sure has a bright future ahead.

This is such an interesting track, it takes trap R&B and mixes it with such forward thinking production, it's actually stunning. The "rap" section, that (I think) samples Janet's "You" at the end of the song, is a nice touch and Dev Hynes' guitar solo is the cherry on top.

---

 TIL Dev Hynes is not the same Dev from "Like a G6" or "In the
Dark". Also, Troy Bolton is SHOOK lol. I could do without the unnecessary song extension from
the electric guitar. Motherfucker tryna be Prince so bad and it's painfully obvious


---
**letsallpoo** (11): The actual opener to this fantastic album for me. Tinashe sings like 5 unique words total but it's such a fucking experience to listen to.

**zaneylainy** (11): this song is a declaration, logged back into my account to give this an 11

**agentofscranton** (10): that’s one sexy guitar solo goddamn

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the atmosphere! the guitar solo!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Troy Bolton found DEAD

**Kaylaboe** (10): This song is somehow almost six minutes long but it never drags on, nor does it even feel that long. Tinashe is serving stellar vocals, the production goes hard and the guitar solo at the end is just amazing.

**nooodisaster** (10): This song is a masterclass of atmosphere. It feels like there's a whole world in here with the epic, layered production and THAT guitar solo. We get just enough personal glimpses into the world with the lyrics ("It's been months now since I came here to California"), but there's still an intoxicating mystery to it all. So yeah, good song Tish.

**rupull\_** (10): This whole song is so great and just feels... complete. And that guitar solo at the end is what immediately sold me to this song, it is like im drowning but I know that I'm going to heaven and just so peaceful and free.

**triptoyourheart** (10): Oh god I almost gave this my 11 tbh, this is so incredible.

**jamesfog** (9.5): The background vocals are so ethereal... love it. The outro is killer

**dropthehammer11** (9): okay fuck me up tinashe

**jess\_22** (9): this was close to being a 10 but I'm not a fan of the guitar outro

**MashLuke** (9): beat dropped harder than my feelings

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): I was frustrated to find out Dev doesn’t have any vocals in this track. also wtf is happening in the outro? Who invited Camila here?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Zodiac sign: Gemini

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): That bass!! That guitar!! Those vocals!! I am shook

**whatareblackhole** (8.5): The guitar solo is GLORIOUS

**awryj** (8.4): This is basically Shake It Off

**cyborglilith** (8): listened 2 this & cold sweat like 4ever and still don’t remember what they sound like

**robbiec\_** (8): the guitar and the way she sings the hook melts me

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): That outro gave me Pyramids vibes. Good song.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.7): This song has a cool, atmospheric vibe.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): flows nicely with the production. the ending seemed random.

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I like this one, but the solo at the end drags a little bit imo. I'd Bet on popheads doing Tinashe dirty in this rate tbh

**VodkaInsipido** (7): for having Blood Orange this was… kinda disappointing tbh. Still good song.

**banananaise** (6.5): did i ever tell yall about how i saw Blood Orange (Dev Hynes for all uncultured swine) opening for Florence and the Machine on the Ceremonials tour, before he released his first album. literally everyone there had no idea what was going on but me and my friend were like "wow this is actually kind of good" and that just goes to show i have better tastes than everyone else

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): Surprisingly strong vocals on this one!

**Raykel** (5.8): I liked her harmonies, the parts where it was just the piano, and the guitar ending (tho it seems kinda squeezed in there), but it can do without the generic trap beats.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This song is way too long, it literally is just a guitar with no vocals for a minute. Tinasha is flopping.

**MrSwearword** (4): wasted production

**personwithhair** (4): Great Dev Hynes song, meh Tinashe song

**shineflyer** (4): the track feels kind of muddy for me. Like, very watery.

**sletrab07** (4): Oh sweet Jesus fuck, she’s really doubling down on downtempo R&B 101, isn’t she? This one just proves that Tinashe doesn’t even sound interesting when she sings properly. You can Bet on it that Aquarius still makes me want to drown myself. This. Is. Not. Enjoyable.

VodkaInsipido: epilogue: tbt to comments I got for my SZA writeup

---

>*I been secretly banging your homeboy*  


>*It made me feel good*  


>*You was a temporary lover*  


>*But I need you, but I need you, but I need you*  

>SZA’s lyrical skills.


*Holy shit.*

*Are you guys joking here?*

*This is considered quality music and lyricism? Goddamn it isn't even hip hop first of all. Half of OP's cherry picked lines aren't even grammatically correct. It's shit like this that is dumbing down the youth. And OP has the *nerve* to even write "SZA's lyrical skills" in a sentence. This is comparable to the USA after 911. After Donald's inauguration (wait...). Music is on a rapid decline and most of us are just watching it burn. I'm done, and won't be back.* 

***Get help.***

---


*EDIT: downvotes? Are you* ***all*** *this r-tarded? Would you guys submit those above lines in an article highlighting the best examples of high lyrical prowess? Re read them for me.*


*Know what? I know MANY of these users agree with me. Since you're too scared to admit it, simply DOWNVOTE this comment. The truth will set you free, but first, it'l piss you off.*

---

*Well shiiiiiiiiiiiet. If you hoes can identify with secretly "banging his homeboy" then I guess there's a perfect match here. Do you.* 

*Additionally, if you fail to see the grammatical errors, I'm sure you are SZA's target demographic.*

---

*Haha the first word of her post stated that she's a girl, and here you are calling her a him. This is comedy.* 

---

*Pathetic clowns. Nice sub you got here. Hip hop heads? More like HIP HOP PRETENDS! Hahahahah. Better than your dear SIZZER could do*

---

*You're a damn clown who listens to SZA for lyrics, so your opinion is invalidated  
Got me banned on my other account too*

---

also this one which is from the same user but like a week later: *later HHAH of course magicvodka doesn't comment herre. TOO MANY BARS NOT ENOUGH SZA*

**c0ns3rvative** (11): the latin flair in the production is beautiful. one of my songs of the year

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I can't believe a song sampling Akon is so good

**jess\_22** (10): the buildup to the chorus is everything

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): I love the Akon sample

**shineflyer** (10): Don't Matter is the weirdest choice of song to interpolate. But I'm down with it, as well as the guitar bits, and the interesting chord progression.

**SkyBlade79** (10): actually quite a bop. The production is really cool, and the pre-chorus is super strong, and the alliteration is also strong.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Love, love, love this track. The guitar work here is amazing, and the Charlie Heat production is INSANE. Her vocals are perfect for this track, and the chorus is easily her strongest ever. It’s just absolute perfection. This song is hopelessly underrated. They don’t want to see it happen, but we say fuck it.

**whatareblackhole** (10): Can anyone sing the word “FaceTime” sexier than Kehlani can?

**rupull\_** (9.7): This song features some good ass production with a tiny little smidgen of latin flare. I love it!

**eklxtreme** (9.5): gotdamn this slaps. It's so catchy and it deserved to be a radio hit. maybe if it had like a few decent guest verses.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.3): I’m always a fan of an Akon interpolation.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): These strings and loops are bops. This is the best production on the album.

**nooodisaster** (9): Holy shit, this song is soooo groovy. The chorus just keeps building faster and faster, and my pussy bops with it. "They don't wanna see it happen, but we say fuck it" is a brillantly casual mic drop.

**1998tweety** (8.7): Bop x2 tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): ooh that subtle latin vibe slay me reina

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): Stunning pre-chorus and build-up, and I love how prominent it is in the song. Shame the build-up never amounts to anything

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): This song is catchy as hell and really addictive to sing along to

**dropthehammer11** (8): I love the Akon interpolation

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Ok this totally might be cause of the sample but idc cause that sample is good af

**jamesfog** (8): The Akon song this samples is a classic

**MashLuke** (7): cute sex song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): wow akon found dead

**VeganSquash** (7): this feels rushed but its a bop

**Zugtris** (6): poor interpolation of a living LEGEND...

**MrSwearword** (5): so a weird tribute to "Don't Matter" by Akon? The fuck is this?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): There is just way too much being tried here and I don't really think it worked.

**awryj** (4): This song samples an Akon song. This is the most I can say about it.

 I already like this album better than Ctrl because I can properly hear K's
enunciation versus SZA and can better comprehend the lyrics. Also the outros are long but
reasonable and not out of place compared to the rest of the song. I hope SSS has the highest
average

---

**angusaditus** (10): a massive bop!

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Without a doubt the strongest track on the record. It just gets absolutely everything right, and there ain't a thing I would change about it. The menacing distorted vocals used here add such a great atmosphere to the track and mesh super well with the beat. Her vocals here are flawless too and the outro? Heaven.

**Kaylaboe** (10): The 90’s and early noughts-vibe in are great and really sets this track apart from the rest of the tracks in this rate. An amazing start to the album, and i really wish there was more of this style on the rest of SSS.

**MrSwearword** (10): pretty damn great

**Nfranklin50** (10): man coming off the intro makes the start of this song so powerful and it feels so good and it makes you feel so good and happy

**rupull\_** (10): Again. Just a great way to start an album and shows exactly what this album is about as a whole. Great first track just like all these other ladies.

**triptoyourheart** (10): Such a fucking great song, I love this so much. This was the first song of Kehlani's I ever heard and I was hooked on her on first listen. Such a great introduction to the album.

**VeganSquash** (10): the beat is infectious lets be honest here

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.8): I aspire to be as casually unapologetic as Kehlani.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): bit of a jarring change of sound from the intro but it’s a great song

**eklxtreme** (9.5): really strong rhythm that holds up the song and nice vocals

**cyborglilith** (9): underrated

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This reminds me so much of Aaliyah (rip). I loved the introduction of the piano and the saxophone for sure. I love the funky 70s vibes I’m getting as well.

**zaneylainy** (9): a FUN track

**awryj** (8.8): Starting off with a bop is always a good idea. Gj

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Kehlani sounds so smooth here, and I love the simplicity of the snaps and claps, it adds to the laid-back vibe of the track.

**banananaise** (8): i like my beats fast and my bass down low

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): ooh this kinda throwback vibe is so fun

**DraculaWeekend** (8): So chill. That bass is amazing

**dropthehammer11** (8): Super funky track, she has a sharpness for songwriting

**whatareblackhole** (8): I really like the beat of this song, especially following the intro

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): It's good.

**shineflyer** (7): This track is already showing a slight difference in style for this album as opposed to the other two - this is significantly more upbeat than just about anything on the other two albums.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A forgettable, if solid first real track. The instrumental is really nice though. Love those little squeaks.

**MashLuke** (6.5): pretty boring

**nooodisaster** (6.5): she's sweet!!1

**gannade** (4): i can't stand those random pauses

**SkyBlade79** (4): kind of mediocre

The transition from Indigo Child to this is genuinely scalp damaging and this is a really great and unique song. The tribal drums (I think) give it a lot of energy and the lyrics go really well with the production and they're so agressive, I love it.

---

So like is this a prequel to "Man On The Moon" by Britney Spears where
T and her man were on a NASA mission or something and they argued or something so he went 
back to the ship and got a booty call from Britney so he used an escape pod just to go back to
Earth and get with her? That's my theory at least

---
**shineflyer** (11): I've been waiting for the drums to get more unique, and this song brings that. It's a more intense track than others on the album. The synth pattern is crazy, and the piano and strings that come in intensifies the emotion in the track.

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Holy shit this song pops off??!!?!? Her delivery in the verses is on point and the first 30 seconds of the song in particular go off. The chorus ain't anything spectacular but it doesn't need to be because it works well with the rest of the song. Also the main beat that you hear at the start and throughout the rest of the track is everything 🙏

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): VEEEEEEERY close to snatching my 11! the beat is dark and vaguely threatening, and lyrically she snapped! talentashe strikes again!

**cyborglilith** (10): best song on the album.

**MrSwearword** (10): she actually brought something that didn't suck

**nooodisaster** (10): The hidden gem of Aquarius; y'all better not do this one dirty. For some reason this feels dated in the best way possible, like it's a classic I can't quite place.

**rupull\_** (10): idk wtf that thing in the beginning is but I want a whole hour of just that intro. Again Tinashe has some of the best intros to her songs. P.S. when i first heard this song I had it on repeat for a whole month... or two...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Zodiac sign: Leo

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): invented astronomy

**triptoyourheart** (10): If anyone has listened to Crossing The Cosmos on Tinashe's In Case We Die mixtape, I feel that this song is its more evolved relative.

**whatareblackhole** (10): …this perfection! Serving you vocals

**eklxtreme** (9.5): this shit slaps. amazing production. love the vocals too.

**rocketgamer31** (9.5): This beat goes hard, one of Tinashe's best. Her vocals shine on the chorus and her voice is so smooth during the verses.

**VeganSquash** (9.5): the outro is too long, but aside from that, this is the only nearly perfect song on the album!

**dropthehammer11** (9): I love her vocals on this track specifically

**MashLuke** (9): Man, her vocals are great and the beat is tight

**Nfranklin50** (9): real talk she sounds so much like Britney and on some songs like this and Slumber Party I can't tell the difference

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Love the production on this. Almost sounds Timbaland-inspired

**SkyBlade79** (8): outro is a bit long but this song gets SO PRETTY

**banananaise** (7): wtf even her sad songs are good

**robbiec\_** (7): hot?

**sletrab07** (7): I can get behind this one. I dig the record skip effect on the synths, it’s some fascinating production. I’m still not here for the vocals, especially the chorus.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.3): Good song, but the beat is a bit repetitive.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): Pretty forgettable.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Britney is better at singing about moons.

The production is really nice and unique, and insanely relatable. I might be a little dumb and it being really obvious looking at the lyrics, but I wish I knew why it's called "Prom". It would be better as a 2 minute interlude than as a full song, as I feel it gets kinda tired.

--- 

 I LOVE the production on this! It sounds like a Carly Rae Jepsen song so I think that's
why I connect so well with it

---
**awryj** (11): I wanted to write something clever but I can't. This song just takes me to these poppy fields.

**BiPolarBear17** (11): I fell in love with this the first time I heard it and I love it just as much now. It's a dream-pop bop and there's nothing else like it on the album, but despite that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb and instead flows perfectly well with the rest of it. It's hook after hook after hook, and her voice is bursting with emotion throughout. On the outro it sounds like she'll keep singing til the cows come home, and I honestly wish she would as whenever I listen to Prom I pray that it won't end.

**Leixander** (11): Fearing not growing up… Thinking not being good enough for the person you love… Of course I would give this my highest score. I also really love the fade-out outro, and still think that there is a Pt.2 of this.

**personwithhair** (11): It's actually a federal crime to not love this song. Please report anyone that gave this song a 9 or lower to the authorities.

**cyborglilith** (10): wtf I wasn’t ready for this lowkey bop

**Kaylaboe** (10): Prom sounds like it could fit in Z, with the much more synthpoppy production. The lyrics take on a tone of an existential crisis, and being the considerate sweet bean she is, she once again asks to not take it personal.

**MashLuke** (10): this is so good

**MrSwearword** (10): it's almost 80s soundtrack adjacent to me and I love it for that alone

**rocketgamer31** (10): A certified bop! One of my favorites from the album

**sletrab07** (10): The poppiest-sounding track on the album. I know SZA explained the title, but I love the theory that it’s a broken prom ise.

**triptoyourheart** (10): Best song on the album for me here, I can see the production on this track holding up well over time.

**VeganSquash** (10): This is like trap and dream pop had a love child

**VodkaInsipido** (10): I love the reference to The Wizard of Oz: those evil witches are those mean girls and high-school, and the houses are her possible futures: what career to choose, who to settle down with… and just as with The Wizard of Oz, what matters in high-school is the journey, not the ending; the friends and experiences you make along the way, not going to university.

**whatareblackhole** (10): Double punch after Drew Barrymore, WOW

**Elitefourbrad** (9.5): Don’t take it personal, this is a bop.

**angusaditus** (9): a bop!

**luuvin** (9): never forget shea coulee performing this at the rpdr finale party (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME7FRxkWHmA) -- legends supporting legends

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): finally some jam

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A faster, disco-y bop with a complex look on growth of relationships and how it correlates to growth in real life. It’s got a simple but gorgeous instrumental and a stunning Wizard of Oz reference. This album is hit track after hit track.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): Kehlani did it better 🙂 the bass line holds up the track well and it's pretty catchy.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Cute!

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The definitive pussy bop of the album. Almost feels like it belongs on a different album, with the best production here. Plz- don't- take- it- per-so-nal.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): The hook is really, really good. The rest of the song is alright but not too special.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.3): It’s good, but, as far as production goes, I wish there was more of a difference between the verses and chorus.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): half a promise

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Poppiest song on the album. Definitely a fan of this

**Nfranklin50** (8): This is a great song but honestly I wouldn't be offended if it got left off the album. It's just too poppy and doesn't really fit between Drew Barrymore and The Weekend

**rupull\_** (7.7): I love the cool feel that Prom gives off. Cute and Fun and very dancey!

**shineflyer** (5): really forgettable tbh

 I'm sort of lost on how the song is meant to connect to Drew in whatever
way. Also, it's the middle of December (as of this rate reveal). Unless you're SpanKky it's the
complete opposite of "warm enough" where I reside, and where most of the other popheads
probably reside too. This still has mad replay value though :)


---
**Elitefourbrad** (11): This song is by far my favorite SZA has ever done. It’s about Drew Barrymore, the actress, being the image of finding one’s identity through her early filmography. Also SZA asks her man “Is it warm enough for ya inside me,”, a literal queen! Finding my own identity is something I’ve struggled with my whole life, and it’s something that I’m still coming to turns with.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): SZA perfectly captures the mood she wanted this song to portray. I lip-sync to this in my room more often than I want to admit.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): This song definitely earned it's 11. It's weird to think one of my favorite songs of 2017 would be introduced to me through the Popheads Hot 50 Chart. This song is so nice and relatable with SZA singing about her lack of confidence and insecurities. Plus, the second verse is one of the best verses I've ever heard.

**Kaylaboe** (11): One of the best songs released this year. It takes on more of an indie/rock-influence, and the instrumental is just gorgeous - I barely even notice that it never changes throughout the song. Her vocals are varied and emotional, portraying the insecurity of the lyrics perfectly, and the strings that come in at the end just makes the cherry on top. You’re warm enough for me, SZA <3

**MashLuke** (11): This song is so cold and warm at the same time. I love its honesty and simplicity.

**sletrab07** (11): This has everything Love Galore has going for it, plus a good-sized chorus with a catchy AF melody. The stream-of-consciousness mixed with the story is terrific.

**VeganSquash** (11): I love how this addresses loneliness, its a theme I don't hear often in pop music, well at least authentically.

**whatareblackhole** (11): This song perfectly encapsulates being in your 20’s. It is beyond.

**agentofscranton** (10): watch santa clarita diet on netflix, or don't it's not that great anyway

**angusaditus** (10): ugh this is perfection, I wish I had a 2nd 11 to give!

**BiPolarBear17** (10): A rate winner!

**Leixander** (10): SOMEBODY GET THE TACOS, SOMEBODY SPARK THE BLUNT, LET'S START THE NARCOS OFF AT EPISODE ONE

**shineflyer** (10): This is a really interesting choice of guitar tone. And the chorus melody is really ear-catching.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The debut single that instantly made everyone perk their ears up and realize we were in for something special. Drew Barrymore is a brilliant track, with some of her strongest lyrics, as well as some of the strongest lyrics of the year. “Warm enough outside for ya baby, is it warm enough for you inside me?” is a crazily good juxtaposition, and her feelings of insecurity really come out on this track. The instrumentation is also beautiful, as it is with every track on this album.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): “Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt, let's start the Narcos off at episode one” is one of the best lines this year.

**deltacall** (9.5): One of the most interesting and vivid descriptions of longing for someone. I love it

**eklxtreme** (9.5): beautiful lyrics and beautiful vocals all around.

**Nfranklin50** (9): A great song but honestly it feels better outside of the context of the album

**rocketgamer31** (9): Excellent lyricism from SZA here

**rupull\_** (9): Idk if I just have bad taste or smthg but this song isn't perfect to me and it's not that close to an 11 to me like it is to a lot of popheads. But, that is sorta why I like it since it has it's flaws and stuff, kinda the whole point of the song. SOMEBODY GET THE TACOS!!!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Nice.

**awryj** (8.8): I want SZA to release an album about every Hollywood actress

**banananaise** (8): is she talking about how warm her p***y is

**DraculaWeekend** (8): tbh I'm pretty confused as to how this song works so well?

**jamesfog** (8): It half bops.

**MrSwearword** (8): couldn't keep my attention all that much but it's deliciously jazzy

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): okay she's doing less of the weird vocal phrasing she had going on earlier and doesn't sound like she's half an octave out of her range and straining the whole song, so i'm here for it. the outro is gr8

**cyborglilith** (7): a common factor in many of her songs is the lack of a chorus, or any distinguishing characteristics

**nooodisaster** (6.9): It IS a song.

**SkyBlade79** (4): probably the most inoffensive song on the album, but it’s missing travis scott and really overrated

thenshecamelikeaaah: This fucking bias by the Tinashe stans I knew it. Imagine thinking CTRL is a bad album, let alone giving Love Galore anything less than like a 9. Maybe if the album got an 8.8 BNM from Pitchfork in 2017 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, an electronic R&B album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

SUCH a great pop song. It definitely belongs in 2014 but it hasn't aged a day. I can see some parts of this in recent hits like "Work From Home". The flute is literally something I've never heard in a pop song. Side note: "Drop That Kitty" deserved better!

---

Wow. Just… wow. Tinashe not only has all hands on deck, she has all
cylinders firing on this track! The production, the layered vocals, her powerful vocals which she
can sing effortlessly without straining her voice, not to mention no rap features! This sounds
like "2 On" but, like, 11 worthy. And it's what's getting my 11. P.S. way to pay homage to
Britney by using a flute in your single just like she did. 

---

**banananaise** (11): (hears intro) is this a 2 On reprise (chorus hits) oh no

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jgfF2qMTuo

**awryj** (10): I'm sorry, the old Tinasha can't come to the phone right now

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): A BOP! A BANGER! A SONG! this did NOT deserve to flop the way it did wtf!!!! invented flutes! Utopia could never!

**dropthehammer11** (10): okay this is a BANGER of a synthpop song

**jamesfog** (10): Slut anthem! Iggy Remix slays tho

**letsallpoo** (10): poor iggy

**MashLuke** (10): she broke up with her boyfriend so she's calling all the men to make him regret it. I'm on my way.

**rupull\_** (10): I am not lying to you when I say that when I googled BOP I got redirected to this song. Just undeniably a great song with some good ass production. If I could give another 11 this would be it!

**SkyBlade79** (10): ICONIC INSTANT 10. the production is god tier

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Zodiac sign: Scorpio

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): the dance is i-c-o-n-i-c

**zaneylainy** (10): PAN FLUTE SOLO FOREVER

**deltacall** (9.5): Bebe Rexha really snapped writing this one. I can't believe she didn't keep it

**nooodisaster** (9.5): What a bop. Not just pussy popping, but EMOTIONAL pussy popping. There anger, desperation, sex, and sadness in this song, while all still having a commercial sound. (i mean it flopped but still) "Kiss the old me goodbye, she's dead and gone." Taylor Swift WISHES.

**triptoyourheart** (9.5): Should've been the follow up single to 2 On!

**eklxtreme** (9): really catchy song with a music video that makes it even better

**robbiec\_** (9): hot FLUTES

**rocketgamer31** (9): All hands better be on deck for this bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Wait is this not about sex?

**VodkaInsipido** (9): the synths are amazing

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): :rip: old Tinashe. The icy beat is absolute fire, the verses are absolutely amazing, but the chorus comes in as a bit of a letdown. Still a solid bop though

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I don't know how Tinashe made dancing in a shipyard look cool, but she did

**whatareblackhole** (8): Guilty pleasure honestly

**sletrab07** (7.5): The standout of the album for me. If Tinashe spent more time on exciting instrumentation and interesting hooks, I’d give her the time of day. That pan flute at the end gives me flashbacks to Titanic tho.

**cyborglilith** (7): I used to like this more, but it got old extremely quickly.

**shineflyer** (7): This is the kind of song where you'd expect DJ Mustard-y "heys" on the upbeat, but instead we get a flute. So, points for innovation?

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.7): It’s fine. Sounds like a bunch of other songs that came out around this time.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Sorry but the production on the chorus is so irritating. its like someone rubbing a balloon

**personwithhair** (6): Basically a better version of 2 On

**Raykel** (5): Interesting production but sounds dated and doesn't really suit her voice.

**VeganSquash** (4): the flute was a nice touch

**BiPolarBear17** (3.5): The shouty chorus + whatever that instrumental is in the chorus that sounds like a tin can being violently assaulted ruin what could be a decent song.

**Elitefourbrad** (1): TINASHA IS OVER BEY IS A QUEEN

**MrSwearword** (1): flat vocals on a dated as fuck beat

mokitsu: # #2: 2 On (Feat. ScHoolboy Q)
---
**Average:** 8.828 **// Total Points:** 538.5 **// Controversy:** 2.071

---

Fun fact: this was the first time a woman collaborated with DJ Mustard. This song has become quite a classic despite it's relatively low chart placement (#23), and deservingly so. It's cool, assertive and sexy. The rap verse is quite catchy. 

This had quite a journey on this rate - at first it wasn't even top 30, but it kept rising. Eventually it lost steam and stalled at #2 - almost 20 points behind "Distraction".

---

Um… does- does anyone know what "2 On" means? I'd love to
know. I'd also love to know what Q's verse adds to the track because to me it just sounds way
too overtly sexual, almost to the point of harassment. A poor way to lose an 11 IMO.

---
**ComeOnAndSlang** (11): tHat part

**dropthehammer11** (11): This is DJ Mustard at his peak. The beat is silky yet powerful, the songwriting is seductive, catchy, and Tinashe really channels her boss bitch attitude. Q does his thing on the feature. Incredible song.

**rupull\_** (11): I am SHOCKED that this never got into the top 20, literally this song is the definition of a B O P. No questions asked this deserves all the 11's

**agentofscranton** (10): I remember hearing this for the first time and thinking that this girl is about to take the world by storm, and, well… at least the song’s still good

**angusaditus** (10): this always has me http://i.imgur.com/fNmiVm6.gif

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): A CLUB ANTHEM! A WELL DESERVED HIT!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): That ScHoolboy Q verse is a little much for me, but this song is still so good

**eklxtreme** (10): an absolute bop! dj mustard's best production by far. tinashe and q work well over it.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This song turned me on so much that I was shaking my ass so much that I accidentally broke a lamp that fell down the stairs and dented the floor while also breaking a pipe and causing water to start flowing into my house where I died.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Idc how many times I hear it I will always get my life to this song.

**gannade** (10): fuck me fuck rap is the best line ever

**ImADudeDuh** (10): You know it, you love it, a bop!

**jamesfog** (10): Queen of coining new terminology

**jess\_22** (10): even though I love this song, it's sad that Tinashe will only be remembered for this

**letsallpoo** (10): I don't want this to win - Tinashe and this album have waaaayyy better songs than this - but I can't not give it a 10.

**MashLuke** (10): if this doesn't make you want to dance, you are weird af

**robbiec\_** (10): there was this really pseudo-fancy club (which was also the first one I ever went to) called Box (which shut on the 1st of July RIP) which usually played deep house in the vein of House Every Weekend but one night they played this and Trini Dem Gurls and it was so HOT like I don't know what it was but I felt like I was in a rap music video so thank you Tinasha and GroovyQ for this moment

**triptoyourheart** (10): An iconic one hit wonder banger and it needs reminding that neither SZA and Kehlani have had a song (as the main artist) peak higher than this on the Hot 100.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): a fantastic bop, the beat is heavenly and Q does a great verse

**1998tweety** (9.9): ScHoolboy Q took the 0.1 away

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): an electronic bop! It’s without a doubt the most commercial song on the album, but for me, it doesn’t quite reach the high that some other tracks on this album can offer. Still a solid song, and with a great feature from Q.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9.5): delete the superflous rap part and this is a 10

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Invented sex.

**c0ns3rvative** (9): the goat DJ Mustard production

**nooodisaster** (9): is that a police im calling the marijuana. (why 9: generic lyrics but infinitely listenable with great momentum)

**cyborglilith** (8): LOL Q’S VERSE IS TRASH

**rocketgamer31** (8): A bop! If I remember correctly this track introduced me to Tinashe. I don't care that much for the rap feature, though.

**shineflyer** (8): I want to dislike this on principle of it being a DJ Mustard thing, but it's a pretty good one.

**SkyBlade79** (8): schoolboy q does horrible but the rest is great

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Zodiac sign: Pisces

**awryj** (7.5): There used to be a nice Christian bop here... but Schoolboy Q came and made it disgustayng

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): Schoolboy Q’s verse ruins this total bop for me

**deltacall** (7): The ScHoolboy Q verse drags this one down quite a bit. Literally any other verse would have been better :/

**sletrab07** (6): This isn’t even that good of a song, I’m just so relieved to be done with that ebola intro.

**Raykel** (4): I mean the chorus is catchy but the production is annoying. The hey hey hey's distract from the hook so it just makes me mad when listening to the best part of the song.

**VeganSquash** (3.5): the rap killed it for me tbh

**personwithhair** (3): Not sure why everyone is so thirsty for this song. This song like a Cassie song and it aged horribly almost instantly

**MrSwearword** (0): I don't see it for this song & I don't care if I ever do

thenshecamelikeaaah: This fucking bias by the Kehlani stans I knew it. Imagine thinking Aquarius is a bad album, let alone giving 2 on anything less than like a 9. Maybe if the album got an 8.8 BNM from Pitchfork in 2017 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, an electronic R&B album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

---

LOL

---
**eklxtreme** (11): that prechorus is better than sex and that drop may as well be an orgasm

**jamesfog** (11): The instrumental is GODLY. I'm fucking quaking. This deserved to be a major hit!

**angusaditus** (10): a massive bop!

**c0ns3rvative** (10): this track just drips with kehlani's personality. incredible delivery over great production

**cyborglilith** (10): at first I thot this song was weird but it’s a hoe anthem

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song is a distraction from my everyday life because it is SO FREAKING GOOD. I couldn't decide between giving this and Too Much my 11 and I am still conflicted tbh

**dropthehammer11** (10): Dope song, love the 90s influence

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Kehlani’s best song is here and she’s a bop!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is like a textbook example of a perfect pop-R&B song. Everything about this just works.

**luuvin** (10): SO close to giving this my 11, but i came around to kehlani quite late so it just narrowly misses out in favour of sza

**MrSwearword** (10): Kehlani's GOAT; a song that makes me feel like a stripper/gogo boy

**Nfranklin50** (10): She does casually sexy so well

**shineflyer** (10): I'm a huge fan of the interpolation in the chorus.

**SkyBlade79** (10): probably one of her best songs. It’s really nice and poppy, and the intro is really smooth.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): i wish I could’ve given this an 11 too

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): wow 3 songs in and i guess we stan! edit: lmao this song shits on the entire rest of the album combined idk what to say

**triptoyourheart** (10): A BOP

**rupull\_** (9.9): I tripped when this song was playing when I was going up stairs... Good song but I can't give it a 10 due to my dumbass falling just being replayed everytime I hear it.

**rocketgamer31** (9.5): The first time I heard this I instantly felt a throwback-vibe and I LOVE it. This track really made me anticipate the release of this album, and remains as one of her strongest yet.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I love the energy in this track and her flow really matches the beat. A highlight in the album.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9.2): her melodies omg

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): serving ENERGY!

**MashLuke** (9): catchy, I like the chorus, it's simple yet so efficient

**robbiec\_** (9): this is an uncommon instance of when the trap thing on pop WORKS

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A bop! The instrumental is crisp, and Kehlani gives a light and sexy performance here.

**whatareblackhole** (9): OOF, I LOVE this song, it’s so sexy

**1998tweety** (8.6): Bop tbh

**nooodisaster** (8): The "do you do you do you" hook is so damn good, but the rest of the song somehow feels a little... cheap? Idk, weird auras from this one.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): repetitive bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Verses are not good in this song, however, that chorus bops hard.

**Raykel** (4): This song is just nothing.

# #3 - Kehlani - SweetSexySavage

---

**Overall average**: 7.108

---

**jamesfog**: I didn't expect to like this album as much as I do! Sure, it starts to kinda samey and is a little too long, but I still enjoyed it!

**gannade**: Honestly, Kehlani's vocals heavily dragged this album. This type of slick, downtempo R&B doesn't suit her coarse voice, and it isn't like she had a great vocal to begin with. When the production pauses for a second on "Distraction," and Kehlani tries to go up an octave ... lol. And WHY WHY WHY WHY is this album NINETEEN SONGS LONG?!! None of the songs are particularly bad but the entire album is the very definition of "middling." If you don't have the talent to make 19 good songs, then don't make 19 songs.

**Maydaypvz**: 8

**luuvin**: she got a lot of flack for the album title, tbh i think u could have titled ctrl something similar because i think they both have this very raw sensual millenial perspective but i don't see kehlani as consistent as some of her peers just yet

**banananaise**: jesus christ this looks so long. bring back 9 track albums

**frankiefrankiefrank**: Mostly killer some filler :/ I love Kehlani though and this album really shows how versatile she is as a vocalist and writer.

**sletrab07**: Yeah, I was not expecting to be so pleasantly surprised. An album packed with catchy tunes and plenty of personality. The second half drags on a little, and it’s very front-loaded, but a really strong debut for Kehlani.

**rupull\_**: Oh man! this was the first album I heard in 2017 and it was sooooo great.... in the beginning. Sadly this album is packed full of filler and I say sadly since there are some really great stand out songs in this. Literally up until the 8th track it is just Bop after Bop but it's just such a shame that kehlani and her team made this an 18 track album. Many songs could be cut and should be cut for the better of this album. Literally, had the 3 lowest rated songs in this album been cut, my averge for the album would've went up by a whole point and been my highest rated album in the rate. Oh well... This was a great way to start 2017 and just like 2017 it just got worse after the first quarter. Avg- 6.6

**lassidoggy**: 8

**TragicKingdom1**: The first thing people mention when they talk about this album is the filler and yeah, it is too long given how same-soundy it is. However, Kehlani produces some really great pop songs on here that prop up the rest of the album, especially "Distraction" which is one of my favorite songs of 2016 overall. It also helps that Kehlani's personality and sweet voice shines through even on the filler, keeping almost all of it from falling below a 6. Overall, this album definitely seems daunting, but I doubt anyone will come out of it truly regretting the experience.

**shineflyer**: I was really surprised by this album, because I expected to like this less than the others. But, turns out, I think I actually preferred this album to the other two. This album feels as though it has more drive than the other two, even if there is audible pitch correction on some tracks.

**VeganSquash**: My main gripe with this album is the lack of high notes and variation in Kehlani's vocals. She sounds very monotonous after a while, which can be annoying. I know she has a wonderful voice, hopefully next album she showcases it more.

**Leixander**: Really long but it has its gems.

**DraculaWeekend**: ngl I'm lowkey biased since I've been listening to Kehlani since her mixtapes and I love her stuff. This album is one of my favorite releases this year. The callbacks to 90s R&B give me life.

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: A lot of decent songs, but the album gets monotone and then goes on for too long. 4-5 songs should have been cut. Promising though. 6.5/10

**whatareblackhole**: I love SweetSexySavage because of its youth. SSS has plenty of mistakes and whole backend of filler, but Kehlani’s bouncy and entertaining attitude is apparent in the whole catalog. I don’t think much of the album will age well because of its references to FaceTime and Twitter, but if this isn’t a great indication of being young, dumb, and in love in the twenty-first century, I don’t know what else could be.

**ExtraEater**: oh dearie dear i did not enjoy this

**c0ns3rvative**: the sugary production is perfectly tailored to kehlani's saccharine voice. kehlani's delivery is strong and passionate throughout the record. quite a few incredible standouts here and "Undercover" is one of my favorite tracks of the year. but, the fact that a lot of the deeper cuts tend to be merely good holds the record back from hitting the next level. 7/10 overall

**Kaylaboe**: A solid album, just way too long. It suffers from the Starboy-curse, and it’s just too long and too same-sounding. If Kehlani had bothered to chop off some of the weaker tracks, this could be an even better album.

**rocketgamer31**: Tends to drag at times because of the sheer number of tracks, yet when it's good, it's great. Kehlani serves underrated bops here and some truly catchy choruses, especially from the singles. On the other hand there are times that I feel the chorus ruins a few songs. This album got me way more interested in Kehlani than her previous works.

**cyborglilith**: I really WANT to like kehlani but not when she makes music like this (proceeds to give 4 10s anyway bc I can’t resist these bops).

**cloudbustingmp3**: we have decided to stan forever! went into this not having an opinion on Kehlani and came out very pleasantly surprised! could definitely use some editing, but im looking forward to what she does in the future

**angusaditus**: a few great songs but way too much filler, there's NO reason for this to be over an hour long

**robbiec\_**: 7 this whole album is generally good and I don't think there are any bad songs I just feel like she has unfulfilled potential atm but I still love her and this album is a triumph for her personally

**awryj**: 5.5/10

**nooodisaster**: The more I read about Kehlani for this rate, the more interesting of a person I found her. I wish her album reflected that a little more, tho. The entire album feels either a bit cheap or dated, and she really seems to have a problem making interesting choruses. Few songs are really bad, but very few are great.

**1998tweety**: K the one thing I don't like is how half the songs sound exactly the same "SweetSexySavage" more like "SameSongSleep"

**MashLuke**: too long...

**eklxtreme**: the album screams of 2000s r&b, as if I didn't make that apparent through my comments, with its great simple melodies. I like when the older influences mixed with new styles on some tracks. overall there are so many catchy songs on this, despite some filler. I'd give this a 9.

**Elitefourbrad**: I had never listened to a Kehlani album before this, and I have to say I was extremely impressed. Don’t sleep on Kehlani, she’s coming to snatch wigs with this and Faking It.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: sweetsexyfiller and Distraction

# #2 - SZA - CTRL

---

**Overall average**: 7.570

---

**Nfranklin50**: This album is a personal classic to me and just means so much. It's not often someone is able to just touch ou like this album does

**jamesfog**: After all of the praise I have seen for this album, I kinda expected more. It's not really my cup of tea.

**gannade**: a good album

**Maydaypvz**: 9

**luuvin**: +alt +del all the other songs in this rate tbh, all i want 4 christszmas is solana

**banananaise**: sure she has a cool sound and i'm sure she sings about deep stuff but this is just one of those albums where i can't tell where a song ends and begins, and i forget a song as soon as it finishes. i was constantly having to go back because i realised i missed a song

**frankiefrankiefrank**: This is my AOTY. SZA’s songs perfectly capture the essence of early adulthood and struggling with life/love.

**sletrab07**: An incredibly strong debut by a fully-formed artist. The sincerity of her lyrics are almost confronting, they’re so raw. Clever production choices heighten the standard beats into something more memorable.

**rupull\_**: I heard about SZA when she was just starting out by a friend who kept going on about how they think she's going ot be real big. I dont talk to that friend anymore but I'm happy that SZA did get more recognition. ItsWhatSheDeserves.GIF In all honesty though I'm happy that SZA is getting some recognition and this album is really great too! From the album artwork to the last song it is a very realized album with a clear image of what SZA is trying to convey. Though, there is a good amount of filler in this, I think the standouts in here really are Standouts! Avg- 7.04

**TragicKingdom1**: Even though I really like this album, I find it hard to say much about it. It is a very good execution of the genre: there is great, mood-setting production and some memorable melodies. That being said, with the exception of "Drew Barrymore" nothing really sounds like something I haven't heard before. It has some, if not many gems but I don't guarantee that it'll be remembered 10 years from now as a collective work.

**shineflyer**: Honestly, I don't think the album lived up to all the hype I heard about it. Like, it's not trash, don't get me wrong, but... idk, just not my thing. It feels really same-y to me, with a couple of exceptions.

**VeganSquash**: wow, this is amazing. I've never sat down to listen to the whole thing, and my gosh, I'm going to have to buy this. The only critique I have is sometimes SZA becomes like Sia where you have no idea what the fuck she's saying.

**SkyBlade79**: 4.21

**Leixander**: Easily the best album in this rate. SZA really delivered.

**DraculaWeekend**: Before this rate, I wasn’t too familiar with SZA at all, so this album was a pleasant surprise. Production was great, and there were a few songs I liked a lot, but I wasn't fan of some of those song outros. Ultimately, I feel like this album is way too cool for me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: A really solid debut that leaves you wanting more. 8/10

**whatareblackhole**: CTRL is an album that required a revisit for me to truly grasp its impact. Sure, Love Galore was an immediate standout and Drew Barrymore’s cameo in the similarly titled video was an amazing moment; but CTRL lives in its layers, layers that take multiple listens to truly find. From the heartfelt opening statement of Supermodel to the tug of the heartstrings on songs like Prom and Normal Girl, CTRL is a perfect declaration of being 20-something in 2017. This is an album that I will revisit for years to come.

**ExtraEater**: really solid stuff, honestly think it's a shame Consideration couldn't have been on it, bc it would've easily been top 3 on album, but this is great even without it

**c0ns3rvative**: sza offers a strong set of alternative r&b tunes on this record. while the production never pushes the sonic boundaries of the genre, sza's delivery is well suited to the warm-yet-detached atmosphere and exudes a kind of mainstream appeal that has her poised to become r&b's next big thing. still, for a project that's been hailed by some as the best r&b album since blonde, too many tracks here tend to lack punch and hide behind the nice enough production. 7/10 overall

**Kaylaboe**: A beautiful piece of art from start to finish. This completely blew me away the first time I heard it, June was already a packed month and I did not expect SZA to come through with the AOTY. The production is just completely breathtaking - it fits with current trends in R&B, pop and hiphop, yet it manages to distinguish itself and all the tracks manage to stand out on their own. The inclusion of Mama SZA and Grandma SZA is great, and they provide some great narration, and it reminds me a lot of the channel-switching on Channel Orange. The lyricism is sharp and personal, the features are great.

**rocketgamer31**: I like a lot of the tracks separately, but as a whole they tend to blend together a little bit for me. I admit I lost interest a few times throughout because of this (especially near the end), despite SZA's beautiful voice. I love the way she sounds, but maybe it's just not my time for this album as a whole yet.

**ComeOnAndSlang**: a snoozefest... really could have benefited from being much shorter

**cyborglilith**: This is the most personal of the 3 albums. <3

**cloudbustingmp3**: more like CTRL+ALT+DEL end task

**angusaditus**: overall the albums sounds too same-y imo but the standouts are some of the best songs of the year.

**ImADudeDuh**: An amazing album that I'm glad the grammy's recognized as amazing with all it's nominations!

**robbiec\_**: 8.8 one of my top albums of the year she did it

**awryj**: 8.5/10

**nooodisaster**: sometimes it's hard listening to music when you've never been in a relationship.

**1998tweety**: Should've been called "A" tbh

**MashLuke**: a critically acclaimed album!

**eklxtreme**: good songwriting but I wish the instrumentals were more exciting and I wish there were more standouts. It really picks up in the second half at least. I'd give this an 8.

**Elitefourbrad**: When I first discovered SZA this year, I had no idea I would love R&B so much until I met this album. Every song flows so well together and this is one of my favorite albums of all time now.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: i cant wait for the follow ups ALT and DLTE

mokitsu: # #1 - Tinashe - Aquarius

---

**Overall average**: 7.641

---

**Nfranklin50**: I was not expecting this to be good and it came out swinging and caught me off guard but by the end I was so bored of it. The production is good but it also gets very old and it's just kind of not sensory pleasant

**jamesfog**: A damn debut. First half is very strong and second half is OK, with some bops.

**triptoyourheart**: If the The Velvet Rope is the mother of all alternative R&B albums, then Aquarius is its daughter that loves to play in the ocean and look up at the stars.

**gannade**: Why aren't we rating Deep in the Night? That piano is gorgeous even though it was recorded on a phone lol

**Maydaypvz**: 9

**luuvin**: Ok I literally have never listened to the whole album what the fuck is wrong with me this is such a consistent record, I totally get the Tinashe hype now

**banananaise**: i have a really mixed history with r&b albums, so despite liking 2 On, i procrastinated on this album for so long... i regret this immensely. so many good songs, i don't know what to say, there's too much talent for me to handle

**frankiefrankiefrank**: I didn’t know a lot about Tinashe before this besides 2 On, and (wrongfully) assumed she was an Aaliyah knockoff for the 2010’s. Happy that this album surprised me as much as it did.

**sletrab07**: Jesus Tapdancing Christ, I loathed so much of this album. The ambience of the whole thing falls flat for me, it’s so poorly done. The vocals land somewhere between irritating and forgettable. The features are a mixed bag and the first half of the album is so dire. I tried, I listened to this thing 3x over to try and enjoy it, but I just couldn’t.

**rupull\_**: The first album that I heard from these three ladies! I remember hearing it all throughout thinking her name was pronounced Ta-knee-sh. Anyway I realized that there's a really distinct line in the album where Tinashe explores more breathy and steamy songs kinda Alternative like. Songs like Aquarius, Bet, Cold Sweat, Far Side of the Moon, and Bated Breath, versus her usual R&B songs like 2 On, All Hands On Deck, Feels Like Vegas, and Thug Cry. Even though many of her songs are great I tend to lean towards her more steamy and breathy songs and although she really knows how to do R&B well in both ways, I just wish she wouldve explored more of the Alternative side of her music that she presented here. Overall great album, definitely one of the best debuts for a hip hop girl but there is some ups and downs with this album and there is a good amount of filler. Avg- 7.66

**TragicKingdom1**: I had heard Nightride but not this prior to the rate. It was much less pop-accessible than I expected based off 2 On or All Hands On Deck. Unfortunately, the album as a whole fails to really surpass those songs. Most of the album cuts are just kind of ambient noise that isn't unpleasant but also isn't particularly interesting. There are only 5 or so songs that I remember distinctly, even though I'm writing this right after I listened. Overall, this isn't a bad album per se, but it definitely falls into the territory of generic alt-R&B.

**shineflyer**: I went into this with kind of low expectations, as it didn't really seem like my style of R&B. And, for the most part, that was pretty true. But, hey, I did get some pretty good tracks out of it.

**VeganSquash**: one of the worst albums I've heard in a while. She doesn't showcase her vocals enough, and all of the songs are too slow. It reminds me of a Lana album but worse.

**deltacall**: A timeless masterpiece R&B debut. Iconic. Every second I spend listening to this makes me angrier that her label pays her dirt. She could absolutely have carved out her own space in the R&B landscape if her label didn't fuck around. I will remain heated about this until the end of time.

**SkyBlade79**: 6.93

**Leixander**: I prefer my Tinashe with Nightride, thank you.

**DraculaWeekend**: Oh yes, the famous Tinasha

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: There's some pretty sexy songs in there, but it's not particularly innovative. The second half does not hold up with the first. 7/10

**whatareblackhole**: The album that introduced me to electronic R&B. I don’t think my interests in Kelela (whose amazing debut should have been considered for this rate), BANKS, or SZA would be as strong as they are if it weren’t for Tinashe. I love this album and think it’s such a strong and sonically cohesive debut effort. Tinashe’s voice is unparalleled and I hope she gets the recognition she deserves someday, especially on vocal standout Bated Breath. Tinashe radiates sex but is able to give her sexiness an emotional edge that is important and complex. I love a good amount of this album because of Tinashe’s sex appeal and honesty on songs like Cold Sweat and Far Side of the Moon. A lot of my musical interests owe thanks to Aquarius.

**letsallpoo**: im proud to say that im one of the 10 people in the world to own a physical copy of this album

**ExtraEater**: the sensual, hazy aesthetic is wonderful here. also want to take this place to say Deep In The Night is like top 4 on this album just as an interlude it is so aesthetic

**c0ns3rvative**: i never really understood the hype around this album. it's solid, yes, but it feels like an early step in tinashe's artistic development that doesn't match the maturity of production or songwriting of the later nightride album. aquarius shines when tinashe is able to establish her presence on tracks like "2 on" and "all hands on deck", but some of the other party tracks have corny elements that hold them back. the downtempo tracks are fairly nice too, but again feel like bedroom pop versions of familiar seductive r&b. 6/10 overall

**Kaylaboe**: A great debut effort! Her light and soft voice work so well with the much more darker and harder production, and it all creates this very dreamy and eerie atmosphere. The songs are varied enough to make them all stand out. A common problem this album has however is that the verses tend to be excellent, but the choruses sometimes fail to live up. I was obsessed with this album the year it came out, and it’s still a really good album, and I hope that Tinashe can serve some bangers like this in the future. joyride when? 😭

**rocketgamer31**: Some of the songs fall victim to having too long of an outro attached at the end, but there are also undeniable bops in here as well. Tinashe may not do it in every track, but when she goes for those high notes she kills it. Really solid debut, I haven't decided if I like it better than Nightride or not yet.

**cyborglilith**: I listened to this album like 5 times and don’t remember anything about it

**cloudbustingmp3**: we love a multi-talented future legend!

**angusaditus**: A great album albeit too long and too many interludes for my liking. A heavy trim would do wonders.

**robbiec\_**: 7.5 I still prefer Nightride but this album really surprised me when I got round to it for this rate Tinashe really is slept on

**awryj**: 6.5/10

**nooodisaster**: This album is FUCKING incredible and never gets old. Random comment: Tinashe has the sometimes annoying habit of making everything a love song (to I guess make it more commercial?)

**1998tweety**: Damn they named a Zodiac sign after her

**MashLuke**: she rocks

**eklxtreme**: the production on this is the main highlight, which was spectacular. this album pulled off the alt-r&b sound much better than most artists. Tinashe has great vocals at times and she always has a knack for good melodies. I'd give this album an 8.5.

**Elitefourbrad**: Honestly, I was not that impressed with this album after how much she’s been hyped up in the sub. Her one little tiny verse on Slumber Party is better than all of this album put together.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: queen of the bubbling under, queen of winning popheads rates?
