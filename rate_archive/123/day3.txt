### [Hello, gay people](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837510667652300830/837679957207547915/PhoneReset_1855.png)
 

Welcome to the THIRD and LAST day of the Combatting Misandry & Xenophobia in Popheads event, which is also called the 2010s K-Pop Boy Groups rate! ~~I'll miss this joke </3~~

This is the rate for people who followed closely a group of adult men who hate each other for years... just like my co-host u/MoonlightByWindow did, because she's an EXO-L and was also a fan of One Direction <3

If you don't know anything about most of these groups and just did the rate to support my slay queen of a co-host in particular, then get ready to have a fun time seeing the the petty fights we will have all over the thread and the Beatsense room like yesterday!  This will be the best of the days, you won't need to think about compensation for the time lost because the reward will be the enemies made along the way.  But we do have a lot prepared and my co-host may or may not have cried over one of the shitposts being momentarily blocked by copyright, so you better find that shit funny.  

***

Today we will be revealing songs placing at **#20-#1** in the main rate and **#3-#1** in the bonus rate. It is the final day, after all. 

**We'll be starting at 4pm EST**, an hour from now, so be ready! 

**The main event takes place at the [BeatSense room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj?ref=beatster&u=P17763eac1c32)**, where we will reveal the placements, have fun with shitposts (original or not) and listen to intermission songs that are, sometimes, not by men!! **BE THERE!!** We have A LOT ready!!!!

**And make sure to keep this thread open as well!** I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out and it features some banners featuring comments made by some of the funniest of you.

**wavingwolves** (10): WHEW!!! What to say? This song is sleek, luscious, sensuous. It feels extremely elegant and sophisticated and it's one of their biggest highlights of the later part of their discography. I love songs that are able to have a really good build-up and this is a prime example of that in k-pop. This song GROWS and once it climaxes on the second chorus it's actually one of the most gorgeous sonic experiences. No more words needed.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): This is a good song and how they add to the production for each chorus is really cool, but I’m not just super moved by anything that goes on here. The styling in the MV is great though

---

# You calling this great 

**aestheticen** (10): A huge breath of fresh air during a time where I was not really liking K-pop songs

**agentofscranton** (10): they lived they served cunt and they disbanded

**akanewasright** (10): Kinda reminding me of Charlie Puth’s Attention in a way? Except… better? And I’ve given attention an 11

**bespectacIed** (10): Too excellent to be one of their final hurrahs; rip to them. Jinyoung will be fine tho cuz he's FINE all caps

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the subtle buildup into the chorus is so effective and subversive bc it feels like there's going to be a big drop and instead the chorus gets a bit fuller each time without going into what you would expect

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ooooooh but this is so slick tho

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song is a 10, even with that bridge. The opening choreo alone is iconic

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): FUCK ME UPPPPPPP

**grey/0x976** (10): I LOVE YOU JACKSON AND SO DOES OH AEW YASSSSSSSSS JINYOUNG SLAY

**pat-rickstar** (10): The chorus really reminds me of another song but I can't remember what, it slaps so I'm not complaining though

**skargardin** (10): definitely my fav got7 song i've heard so far, absolute bopper

**specialtrickholdA** (10): This is one of the sexiest k-pop song and video packages ever don’t @ me. Whoever decided to put Jinyoung in a sheer leather suit, I hope they’re having a good day.

**sssaaage** (10): avant garde etc.. when the final chorus hits omfg.

**useless-sheep** (10): Wow this is so good! Thank you to the hosts for choosing this amazing song.

**1998tweety** (9.5): another mature bop, unfortunately i must take off 0.5 for the spoken bridge

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): You :kissing_heart: are a part of me :relaxed: You and me :couple:, we are one :point_up: You're the reason for my life :heart: If you're not here I'm not here :skull:

**fadedblue09** (9.5): This was the era I got into their music so I have a soft spot for it, but I admit it kinda shrank on me after people started comparing it to Charlie Puth. Still, it’s proof they can handle sensual concepts if they want to.

**hasanella** (9.5): this is the song not by the moon wanted to be stuck in my head smooth like velvet fulfilling and most importantly the chorus sticks the landing

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): ee ur

**chenle** (9.3): masterpiece if you pretend the spoken bridge isn't there

**BoneStreetSand** (9.1): Without the chorus, this song would be quite forgettable. And honestly, when Mark gives his monologue, I almost want to turn it off, but then Jinyoung saves us with the chorus again. I probably would’ve picked a few other songs before this one to represent my ult group, but I still love it. I just adore their voices.

**bluetriangles04** (9): This song had to grow on me a lot; I wasn’t a fan first listen but ever since then I gave it more chances and its climbed up my ranks a lot.

**hyphen-happy** (9): i think my fav got7 title?

**jasannn** (9): I love these choruses that drop all production for a few seconds and then bring them all back. (ala Break My Heart and How Long)

**SlphWsp** (9): Amazing intro and the rest lives up to it. Dua Lipa who? They did it first. Great choreo

**suffocatedbears** (9): just for that groundbreaking floor choreo at the start and hottie jinyoung

**throwaway7650** (9): mark please be quiet [2]

**weappreciatepowers** (9): bop

**liberalitea** (8.6): that chorus is reminiscent of Break My Heart!! also what is with these spoken word bridges???

**nctdreamsqd** (8.5): Marks spoken part brought the rating down

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): that f*cking chorus

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is a charlie puth song

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): An excellent chill bop, but god… Mark… why would they do him like this… I would love to make this my favorite GOT7 song and give it a 9 but Mark’s verse….

**PSSST12** (8): It's ok I guess?  I saw the praise this song got but I was confused since this song is mostly ok to me.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): the chorus absolutely slaps

**BebeLuigi** (7): it's very good

**bigbigbee** (7): Me calling this tame

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Again I’ve heard this before but I had no idea it was by them

**snugsnhugs** (7): not a huge fan of the verses but the chorus is fun and funky!

**cleopatroclus** (6.5): i zoned out listening to this so not a great sign, decent enough

**elleyonce** (6): Chorus is killer but these verses... w/e

**Heedictated** (6): that terrible bridge automatically deducts 0.2 points and the three rappers really do not fit in well with the song only Jinyoung hard carried the song for me

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5.5): I don't love this, but I don't hate this. It's certainly a song that exists. Albeit it's a little personality-less but if this was playing in the background I don't think I would skip it.

**moonagenightmares** (5.4): i felt nothing

**ebooks #5454** (5): monologue interludes are the worst thing you can do to a song

**nyoom** (5): inoffensive is the best i can say for this

**runaway3212** (5): LNX outsold

**Sedona83** (5): Good chorus but rap killed it

**taeneon** (5): another meh

**10footnotes** (3): The production sounds great: it’s the kind of music that’s exactly up my alley! How cool! Oh, wait… except the lyrics are restraining-order level trash. I truly do wish I could like this song, but the premise is such fuckboi garbage I refuse to give it a pass. Get over yourself and get out of my house, J. Y. Park.

**PRADA** (3): i don’t like it sorry

**Zypker125** (0): The first chorus drop is the only reason people talk about this song. Nothing else about this song is good. It’s boring, forgettable, not transitioned well, feels like it’s going nowhere, etc. It can’t decide what concept it wants to be, the verses are just empty filler, and the song doesn’t flow well at all.


# Please, invite me to whenever coffee shop you're going that's playing this

**2dina3dworld** (6): coffee shop music

# and I'm highlighting this comment because I think it's funny 

**foxinthenoodles** (5): Generic. Wish they just went completely city pop.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): One of my fave intros in K-pop #thankyoufelix. One of the original “noisy” groups, I feel like Stray Kids are one of those groups you either love or hate. They definitely have one of the biggest fanbases out of the 4th gen boy groups so their presence here was a must. I personally really love this song and God’s Menu is coming to win Belb and Ricki’s 2021 K-pop grab bag!

**wavingwolves** (10): STRAY KIDS! WOO! I used to hate this song. I usually don't like a lot of EDM-influenced k-pop, but this one was a massive grower and I think the biggest reason as to why I ended up being able to like it this much is the fact SKZ just has this certain kind of charisma that's really captivating. This song just has this really great hype energy in it and I am sometimes in the mood for that too. When it comes to the noisier side of the 4th gen groups, SKZ definitely has the best of it.

# Oh Woo Oh Woo HIGHERRRR [Korean slayage]

**cremeebrulee** (11): between this and back door, every song ive heard by stray kids has been an absolute smash so i will be diving into their discography after this rate!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): Warning: this comment is more about why Stray Kids is my favorite boy group than about Miroh itself. I never expect this song is going to win this rate but I want to give my 11 to Stray Kids. As someone who is more inclined into K-pop girl groups, there's something so fascinating about Stray Kids to me than most K-pop boy groups except BTS. I highly enjoyed God's Menu and Back Door but Miroh is where I feel like Stray Kids is going to be my favorite K-pop boy group ever. Their title tracks are a bit more experimental yet still enjoyable from the first listen. Their choreographies are so energetic yet it never alienated me to try their dance steps even though I know I am bad at it. It's also nice to know that the group has a lot of creative freedom in whatever they want to do with their music including writing and producing their title tracks. I just wish JYP manages their boy groups better because Stray Kids has the potential to expand to the West and possibly be a worthy competitor to BTS. At the risk of exposing who my bias in the group is, Bang Chan if you are reading this I am free this Friday but I am okay if you are naur available Christopher.

**hunnybee12** (11): skz are the kpop group that took me from a casual kpoppie to it being all i listen to and consume on the internet (all thanks to god's menu, their best title and best kpop release of 2020 😌). miroh is their 2nd best title for me, the drop and it’s buildup get my adrenaline pumping like nothing else and showcases how they have one of the best rap lines in kpop rn. anyways stray kids WOO

**rosecoloreds** (11): deserves to be played in the clubs

**skargardin** (11): I suppose im a tiny bit biased towards this song bc skz was the first kpop bg that i became actively obsessed with. But this is SUCH a bop either way, a workout staple that always gets me going! STRAY KIDS HUH!!!!!

**1998tweety** (10): this song is so damn good, the epic chorus, the whispering, THE RAP VERSES, whew kings really ate this up

**2dina3dworld** (10): STRAY KIDS BOOM is what goes through my head at all minutes of the day

**aestheticen** (10): I still do not know what a miroh is

**bluetriangles04** (10): STRAY KIDS WOO!

**bobaroma** (10): shake it whoo!

**celladonn** (10): FUCKING BANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**DaBigBoi** (10): LION ROAR YEAH BEST HYPE SONG EVER

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Not even their best song but still goes so hard

**endcreditouilles** (10): this goes so hard holyyyy

**grey/0x976** (10): changbin fat cxck for that build up to the beat drop OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU CHANGBIN

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH. It literally never fails to get me hype. It has so much energy. The chorus gets me head banging every time and the rap prechorus is an incredible build up.

**hikkaru** (10): i quite literally do not know a more hype song,

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok this deserves a 10 for the prechorus alone

**jasannn** (10): The best EDM K-pop song.

**lonelyglory** (10): It took me a bit since its release to come around on this song. It absolutely deserves a sound system and not cheap headphones, it's a certified banger once the bass is actually allowed to rock a room.

**milkywayinradius** (10): ok that tiger roar in the chorus is pure energy. i love it every time i watch the MV.

**PSSST12** (10): Holy shit an 11 contender. Their best song along with god's menu. That pre-chorus rap leading to tha drop was an INNOVATION. This song absolutely scalped me the first time I heard it.

**runaway3212** (10): STRAY KIDS

**Shinkopeshon** (10): Hype personified (or rather, songified)

**sssaaage** (10): the intro is so good that even if the rest of the song sucked it would still be a 10 tbh.. chan my woof woof served here

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I'm not really into Kpop that much, so I usually only hear the most popular songs, but towards the end of last year I came across Back Door by Stray Kids and I instantly fell in love with it. After that I listened to God's Menu and Miroh and while I don't think they're quite as amazing, I do still really love them both. It's a shame that when I listened to Go Live I found most of it a bit boring, but I'll definitely keep bopping to the 3 songs I love.

**useless-sheep** (10): STRAY. KIDS.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): i’m usually not a fan of songs like this at all but stray kids have really perfected this brand of k-pop by way of a construction site

**throwaway7650** (9.5): actual club banger, idk why I didn't like this at first

**throwawayforshady** (9.4): Side Effects supremacy, but Miroh yass

**Heedictated** (9.3): one of their best incorporation of loud edm in a title track

**bigbigbee** (9): Everything through the drop is a 10. I REALLY like the "whoa-oh" parts.

**weappreciatepowers** (9): nice

**Zypker125** (8.8): Let’s face it, the crux of this song are the absolute fire raps. The rest of the song was solid, but nothing out-of-the-park, and I question the decision to not have a bridge or third chorus. The “higher” chants also got kinda repetitive.

**hasanella** (8.5): the growl is a little on the nose but otherwise the song slaps and i could listen to it all day

**Jhe116** (8.5): The woah part just won’t end

**Leixander** (8.5): banger

**fadedblue09** (8.3): This shrank on me tbh but I'm glad it gave them their first win. God's Menu could never

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Incredible energy that culminates so well in the chorus.

**nyoom** (8): this song sounds like if you mashed up a pitbull track with light by wanna one and then added just a spoonful of anxiety, whoops! wow that was more than a spoonful haha

**ebooks #5454** (7.8): this song created a new groove in my smooth brain

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): slaps

**jaskiwhere** (7.7): Still not a huge fan of how repetitive it is but Stray Kids rarely miss and this song's pretty good, also their rappers are def shaping up to be the best idol rappers of their gen

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i generally like the loud songs (as long as they aren't extremely 2010 sounding) but this could be quieter

**BoneStreetSand** (7.1): I feel like I should’ve liked this a lot more than I did, but it still deserves a decent score. For some reason, I just kept wanting them to do the dance from Jackson Wang’s Pretty Please. And song wise I was waiting for… something to happen that never came. Sorry my Aussie boys. If this was God’s Menu I’d give it almost a 10.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i’ll take ‘places i didn’t expect to find a bear grylls reference followed by a bear roar’ for 200 alex

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Gonna sound repetitive again but I remember really not liking this song the first time I heard it but now it’s one of my favorite title tracks by them

**PRADA** (7): ARTEEZ FOREVER

**specialtrickholdA** (7): I find SKZ waaaayyyyy overhyped by nearly everyone in the k-pop community but this is kinda fun I guess.

**TiltControls** (7): it feels like its building up the whole time which makes me a little anxious for them to just get to it already!!! but the drop is cool

**rickikardashian** (6): this is the music that plays in those 3d gamer youtuber intros templates

**SlphWsp** (6): I was not expecting that voice to come out of that face, don't love the rap or the instrumental, enjoy the lion roars, so much energy in this performance just not my favourite sound

**snugsnhugs** (6): kinda fun, also kinda loud, like I wouldn’t casually listen to this song but maybe I would if I was working out

**nctdreamsqd** (5.5): I liked the structure of the song but didnt care for the color of their voices

**orbiteezus** (5.5): i never really got the hype around this song, i like the prechorus but idk the drop kinda gets stale for me

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.2): this starts out so good and then just gets so noisy

**Sedona83** (5): Not their strongest track, needs more Han

**suffocatedbears** (5): meh

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4.5): My only experience with Stray Kids is hearing that "Cooking like a chef / I'm a Five Star Michelin" song once and knowing they debuted with a song called 'Hellevator', which sure is a title for a song. I can see why people like this, but man it's just not it for me. So many of these "4th gen" groups are such a miss for me which sucks because like I know people my age (19) that are like fully into these groups and I'm just like "Okay but what about this 2nd gen group!" maybe one day all of these songs will click for me or something. But until then, I will continue being an accidental K-Pop boomer.

**BebeLuigi** (3): I stan some Stray Kids track this ain't one of them

**elleyonce** (3): I like Stray Kids, several of their title tracks even, but this apres ski song is not it.

**bespectacIed** (1): JYP's flagship boy group being chart flops and have shit music, yeah it was bad for them. GGs do pay this company's bills. Chan extremely hot thoughhhhhh

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I actually only heard this song for the first time while we were putting the rate together, as Belb was the one who decided what GOT7 songs to have in the rate, and I’m mad I slept on Lullaby for so long!! The production here especially is really nice and Ahgases should have promoted this in K-pop spaces as much as they did with Look :thots:

**wavingwolves** (10): Personally, I think this is one of their most triumphants comebacks and one of their most memorable and enjoyable songs. I know the way the verses feel more lethargic while the chorus is so explosive feels weird for some people, but as you listen to you are able to notice there's a specific pattern that makes this song feel like it's growing till it actually climaxes every time in that gorgeous full and energetic chorus. I'm so glad it was able to find its spot in Day 3, even if here feels low for it.

---

# Ascending 

**BoneStreetSand** (11): MY BOYS ARE KILLING IT. SWEET LULLABY YOU DESERVE A TOP TEN. ALSO, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE GOT7 ADIDAS DANCE VIDEO.

**DaBigBoi** (11): The changes made to the production after the bridge make this a top-tier song, and the versions in other languages are kinda amazing

**fadedblue09** (11): Ahhh how do I explain how much I like this? Well, I love how this song just seamlessly glides between genres, from its hip-hop verses to full funk in the chorus. Also every member is just in top form here, including the rap line (normally their Achilles’ heel). Sad that this didn’t catch on with the Korean GP but at least it gave their most show wins.

**Islandss\_\_** (11): This rate officially turning me into a got7nator

**specialtrickholdA** (11): The song that introduced me to GOT7 and one of the songs that got me HOOKED on k-pop. Just listening to it now takes me back to a simpler time when I was still in my honeymoon phase with k-pop and becoming instantly obsessed with the group (and especially Jinyoung 😍).

**sssaaage** (11): this was SO close to getting my 11 but didnt.. kinda amazing [edit: nvm its an 11 now] this deserves at least day 3 popheads dont flop this time

**akanewasright** (10): The production here… pooh_ascend.gif

**bespectacIed** (10): GOT7's greatest song sounds like it could be a TWICE song, iktr

**bigbigbee** (10): The outfits from this MV are genuinely iconic - I think I've seen the thumbnail for the video like over 200 times in my life and those pink, blue, and green shirts are burned in my brain. I must confess I only heard this one because of Produce 101 X (objectively the worst season of Produce 101!) but I'm so glad I did. The second the introduction notes hit, I am there. Are you ready? Hell yeah I am!

**bluetriangles04** (10): Lullaby was such a moment when it came out, and the album that went with it is amazing. Another candidate for 11, but it missed out barely.

**cherryices** (10): absolutely love that pre-chorus. the whole instrumental gives me pokemon trainer theme vibes

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song is SO fun

**endcreditouilles** (10): This is a VIBE I could play this on repeat forever. Too many 11 contenders in this rate!!

**grey/0x976** (10): mullet looked immaculate present: you timeless all the solos beautiful jyp thank you for doing something right <3 YASSSSS DOWN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH JB ITS CRAZY PLEASE LET ME HOLD YOUR HAND IM BEGGING

**hasanella** (10): it is impossible to not like lullaby it comes in four different versions for gods sake and the dance comes to kill and the catchy rhythm literally hypnotizes

**Leixander** (10): structured perfectly, dare i call the production flawless?

**PSSST12** (10): funky and a bit different for them but it suprisingly WORKS. Their second best song after If you do.

**SlphWsp** (10): Godly instrumental, dare you not to dance, amazing chorus, CG is my passion?

**TiltControls** (9.5): this ain't a lullaby, it's a bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): okay this is absolutely a VIBE

**1998tweety** (9): massive bop

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this kinda bops but if you go ‘you make me ey’ one more time i might reconsider my score

**hikkaru** (9): the chorus is sooo good

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is super fun

**RandomHypnotica** (9): i want to go to the space library tbh

**skargardin** (9): SWEET LULLABYYY

**suffocatedbears** (9): ironic cause the song won't be putting me to sleep

**weappreciatepowers** (9): yas pills

**Zypker125** (8.8): Produce X 101’s cover of Lullaby was definitely superior (with Yuvin’s extended high note >> JB’s restrained high note), but the original version is still solid. The “You make me ay, ay, ay” transition from first chorus to second verse is absolutely tragic and hampers the song (Mark’s second verse talk-rap is also not good), but the choruses and first verse save this song.

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): while it’s a bit too energetic to be a lullaby, this song is made with sweet magic

**dekubaku** (8.5): Fake news! I didn't sleep at all when listening to this lullaby.

**throwaway7650** (8.5): the verses severely lacking in comparison to the rest of the song is so sad, the prechorus is GODLY. #WELOVEYOUJB (not mustin)

**frogaranaman** (8): production straight from the vibes of any Monstercat Nu-Disco release

**orbiteezus** (8): tbh when i first heard this i thought the chorus sounded like energetic. the breakdown in the prechorus is so great though

**nctdreamsqd** (7.5): I really like the Spanish version of this song

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): a solid bop

**elleyonce** (7): Me coming up with a GOT7 title track from memory would sound like this

**foxinthenoodles** (7): The way the chorus' vocal melody and the instrumentals interact just makes for an interesting listening experience. Other than that, just ok.

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): On more listens, it feels a little generic, but the beat and the melody are super catchy.

**jasannn** (7): I wish the whole song was like the euphoric chorus.

**nyoom** (7): where2cop blue sweater and periwinkle blouse

**plastichaxan** (7): well

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): I had no idea GOT7 did songs like this when I think of them my mind goes to songs like Hard Carry

**jaskiwhere** (6): they were right to call this lullaby it did almost put me to sleep

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): This feels like a song I've heard before but not by Got7, by a GIRL GROUP. I just cannot place what song. Take that as you will I suppose. But idk it doesn't fit for Got7 imo.

**snugsnhugs** (6): groovy

**BebeLuigi** (5): it's cute but quite basic

**ebooks #5454** (5): this put me to sleep, in a bad way

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): As some of you mentioned, this song is almost annoyingly catchy so it’s no surprise that it randomly became a minor hit in South Korea. Similarly to iKon’s story, Pentagon were able to have their moment of fame in 2018 before subsequently losing all momentum with member E’Dawn getting kicked out of Cube Entertainment due to his relationship with Hyuna (shout out to Triple H btw). Pentagon have other bops too like Naughty Boy and Critical Beauty but this is definitely their most successful song and one of their best - I just had to take 0.5 points off because I’m not the biggest fan of Wooseok’s voice here.

**wavingwolves** (8.3): Important information for the non-kpoppies: Energetic by Wanna One was produced by the main producer and member of this group, Hui, who also apperead as one of the members of Triple H in the bonus rate. And with that I just want to comment that Hui truly LOST, because Energetic is placing higher than this, to the surprise of no one, but still. This is seriously catchy and I can see that this is Pentagon's Love Scenario and maybe it's even better but their voices can be a little grating at times which makes the song hits less. Still, it's cool it was able to see the light of Day 3. Congrats, Hui.

# FBI agents 


**pleasegivemeasword** (11): I thought about it for a while but this song is getting my eleven, it always lifts my mood when I listen to it and in a way it feels like a quintessential Kpop song to me

**agentofscranton** (10): sad that it’s their only real hit when they’re so so talented - also the mv for the japanese version is maybe one of my favourite music videos ever?

**bespectacIed** (10): The gorilla grip that this song had on me summer 2018... Such a corny yet irresistibly wholesome song, seriously one of my favorites kpop songs ever. FUCK CUBE ENT for fumbling the bag

**bigbigbee** (10): This is a love at first listen song for me - at least that opening piano riff, I immediately loved. I think it's so well produced and fun!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Pentagon needs more recognition pls and thank you

**endcreditouilles** (10): broke: nobody likes u, woke: nobody's like u

**jasannn** (10): Pure fun.

**Jhe116** (10): One of the catchiest songs ever existed. Unfortunately It was released during the time of my preparation of college entrance exam so the studying became very cursed

**lonelyglory** (10): I've got a soft spot for super dopey love songs and I want this serotonin shot straight into my veins.

**nctdreamsqd** (10): Classic Pentagon with their bright & fun sound

**PSSST12** (10): One of my 11 contenders. The superior version of Love scenario. This song is just pure vibes and happiness. And the use of a meme dance for its point choreo is the only time I see it actually WORK. Legends.  I adore this song so much.

**runaway3212** (10): outsold all of SHINee

**SlphWsp** (10): Iconic, should have launched their career, sad they lost Dawn after. Such a good vibe, playful rap, beautiful vocals, fun choreo, forever stuck in my head

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): the dance is so fun

**Zypker125** (9.8): If this song doesn’t rank anywhere in the Top 10, it’s confirmation that Reddit hates bright concepts. This song is super fun and pleasant. It doesn’t do anything bold or adventurous, it’s not the most musically complex song, but it flows super well and its simplicity works in its favor. Only nitpick is that I’m not the biggest fan of Wooseok’s part.

**celladonn** (9.5): The way the captions on the mv say the lyric is "nobody likes you" instead of "nobody's like you" sends me. Anyway, bop

**ebooks #5454** (9.5): this piano beat has crack in it

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): Incredibly catchy and youthful with enough swagger to perfectly translate loser pop to kpop.

**hasanella** (9.5): look i will be honest i love pentagon and everything they do

**BoneStreetSand** (9): I would dedicate my life to Dawn. He could sell me snake oil that “cures” my depression.

**cremeebrulee** (9): they look like theyre having lots of fun making this and i love that for them

**grey/0x976** (9): #SORRY PENTAGON ANTIS they slayed the boots with this little tune

**nyoom** (9): i am generally not given to sympathy for the o no i am such a widdle WOOOOSER nobody care me :'( i'm gonna set fire to a sorority aesthetic (just put on some the national or bright eyes or something and internalize your sad like the rest of us dude! put those feelings back where they came from or so help me) but this? slaps. hilarious that the mv subs say "even if i look at another girl, nobody likes you" (twice!) like he's desperately trying to find someone willing to hang out with his girl but she just sucks real bad

**snugsnhugs** (9): suuuuuper catchy, I kind of love it

**TiltControls** (9): ooh the instrumentation is so fun! I also love the cuts and the dancing in the mv!

**aestheticen** (8.5): The dorkiness in this song is great and also the reason why that Fortnite dance move worked

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): Hey Dawn, what’s going on?

**universemates** (8.5): Their chill tracks are fun but I think Pentagon is at their best when they do pop rock (i.e Daisy, Do or Not)

**Heedictated** (8.2): got tiktok vibes from the song

**PRADA** (8.2): MEGA BOP YASSSS HEY DAWN WHATS GOING ON

**1998tweety** (8): im happy for them that this blew up but its always been mid for me, I prefer their latest releases like Daisy- that's an absolute serve

**bobaroma** (8): too addictive

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): Honestly just a fun song. Not usually my style but I find myself jamming along and getting happy.

**suffocatedbears** (8): groovy bop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): the vocal performance sounds really aggressive for the sweet, loving theme of the song

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The bridge is cute-ish.

**emmach17** (7): This is the kind of song I don't like that much first listen to but I can tell I'm going to save this to my library and it will appear on my Spotify year end wrap up

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this would be better if there were a few different singers on here, I don’t like some members voices

**Sedona83** (7): Actually pretty good

**skargardin** (7): this is so fun!

**throwaway7650** (7): the chorus is really catchy, the raps are mediocre at best

**weappreciatepowers** (7): a tiny classic ig


# Aliens???? idk 


**jaskiwhere** (6): This one's kinda annoying but I love the Road to Kingdom stage so i'll give it an extra point for that

**specialtrickholdA** (6): Unpopular opinion but Pentagon have wayyyyy better songs than this, even if this their best known song.

**seanderlust** (5.8): outsold the US Pentagon tbh

**fadedblue09** (5): Someone on Discord said this and Love Scenario were two different songs in the same stroke and that is...hauntingly accurate 💀.

**frogaranaman** (5): when did the FBI start releasing music

**moonagenightmares** (4.6): the gdragon impersonator at the beginning hurt my ears

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4.5): Is it bad that I only know of Pentagon because of DAWN (formerly E'Dawn)? I mean like, I know of them because they're under Cube and they did that one move I'm blanking on the name of in the chorus that spread throughout K-Pop wildly. But beyond that they're just the DAWN group to me... Which is bad in a way. But this song itself is kinda sucky, I can't believe that dance move is the only good part of this.

**orbiteezus** (3.5): that chorus is way too catchy, and not in a particularly good way

**useless-sheep** (3): i watched a performance of this and it made the song unlistenable

**BebeLuigi** (2): I really don't like Shine I don't get why of all their songs it's this one that blew up sdfqsfsd

# I'm waiting

**CrimsonROSET** (6): your move SHINee

# No need to apologize

**sssaaage** (2): shinee sweeties im so sorry you have to (almost) share a name w this monstrosity

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Cue confusion over whether they’re actually saying “jealous” or “jilleosseo” (“I did it”) in the chorus - it does actually seem to be “jilleosseo” but in the Japanese version of this song they still keep that lyric as the lone Korean word in the whole song lol. Anyway, this song is a massive bop and I remember when this came out in summer 2018 a lot of stans on K-pop Twitter just decided to collectively stan this song for 2 weeks then forget about it. I thought Popheads would really like this and I was even predicting this would be a top 10 lock (or fall right outside it) and that...clearly didn’t happen. But so long as some of you like it then I won!

**wavingwolves** (9.5): I regret not giving this a full 10 because I feel like this is one of the best songs in this rate now. I love the pulsating and enticing quality of it and I'm at least really glad it was actually able to crack Day 3, it was the *least* y'all could do with it. SF9 are new comers but they have gotten a lot of attention lately and while I don't like much about their other titles, THIS is a nearly perfect song and something I would love to see more groups doing in the future. It's the kind of edginess that I'm all in for.

# Now

**bluetriangles04** (11): I absolutely could not get enough of this song from release and it’s just a banger. The buildup, the slowdown back into the second verse and everything. Pacing could not be more perfect for this song for me, and the post chorus is so fucking good like what the absolute fuck? Even the bridge is stunning. There is not a single moment in this song where I think there could be improvement.

**weappreciatepowers** (11): SMASH WE LOVE YOU SF9 UNLESS IF YOU RELEASE ANY SONG OTHER THAN NOW OR NEVER

**10footnotes** (10): What a fucking banger.

**1998tweety** (10): omg the chorus, inject that shit into me

**agentofscranton** (10): put me with the other comments about them not actually saying the word jealous

**BebeLuigi** (10): JEALOUS DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU

**CrimsonROSET** (10): unexpected slap of the day, honestly

**DaBigBoi** (10): Outserved Halsey

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Holy crap this was a dark horse, SO GOOD

**elleyonce** (10): All hail QUEEN JILLEOSSEO.

**hasanella** (10): heaven and literal chills

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): This song is on my hoe anthems playlist and I fucking love it. The repetitions of “jealous,” especially with the whispers, and the bass in the chorus are so good.

**plastichaxan** (10): i dont have something funny to say i just really like this

**SlphWsp** (10): This house sound is incredible, the mv/choreo complement it very well. Can't get over this base line, like WekiMeki's Cool

**specialtrickholdA** (10): How this song didn’t make them household names in Korea I’ll never understand.

**sssaaage** (10): sf9 kings of having a terrible discography then a near perfect song out of nowhere

**throwaway7650** (10): the drop is simply one of the best things I've heard

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): okay that chorus caught me off guard, i was expecting like a big drop

**Zypker125** (9.8): Maybe my favorite chorus drop in all of K-Pop? This song just flows super well, emanating a sensual yet catchy vibe throughout. Inseong gets so many lines, but it’s all deserved, as his vocals are a true highlight of this song. The talk-raps of the chorus are super catchy as well.

**cleopatroclus** (9.5): cock music at it's best

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): god this beat is amazing, this is going to be robbed for sure though

**Jhe116** (9.5): Their magnum opus

**Heedictated** (9.1): jealous~

**hunnybee12** (9): i checked out sf9 after a member had a .... not pleasant voice crack on kingdom cause i felt bad. but i'm glad i did, this is amazing

**jaskiwhere** (9): I love the chorus for this so much

**Leixander** (9): jealousYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH ...wait wrong song

**RandomHypnotica** (9): love the covid-19 friendly seating arrangements in this video

**Siennamono** (9): ,5

**skargardin** (9): this is so slick! major bop

**snugsnhugs** (9): the BEEEEEEEEAT is EVERYTHING

**throwawayforshady** (8.8): One of the best club Kpop songs

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): The music video is visually pleasing. The song is a bop. The boys are cute and they have nice vocals. It has the components I need to enjoy an MV from a K-pop idol boy group.

**TiltControls** (8.5): this was a lot of fun! love the mv too! so many stunning elements!

**moonagenightmares** (8.4): it’s kindof a miracle they released a song this good when the rest of their discography is so bad

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): Funky as hell. Video was cool too. I’ll probably add this to my playlist!

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): I love a house beat

**frogaranaman** (8): I thought this said “Now or Later” and I was about to say ‘great candy’ as my comment but it is not that title so you get this instead

**seanderlust** (8): his universe is shaking but so is my ass

**PRADA** (7.9): their only good song

**bobaroma** (7): edgy but too edgy

**ieatbe** (7): That's a fantastic chorus

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): super catchy also kinda sexy ngl

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): That house beat snapped me into paying attention so hard. Kinda wish the rest of the song was as good as that chorus but it's not bad. Just want more of the fun deep house vibes.


# Never


**foxinthenoodles** (6.5): There are great parts, but there are also snoozer parts.

**nyoom** (6.5): i'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying if it ever occurred to me to listen to this i would simply listen to dynamite by vixx instead

**aestheticen** (6): The first part of the chorus makes this song bad for me. I’m sorry but it feels so empty

**Sedona83** (6): Not bad, catchy chorus

**suffocatedbears** (6): this feels like a typical boy group song

**bespectacIed** (3): As a gay gg stan, i noticed half of the time in this rate i'm just noting about the hot idols lmao. Rowoon truly is a TOPTIER man, my goddd. So unfairly pretty. This song is meh

**fadedblue09** (1.5): I'm legit baffled that this is considered as a frontrunner. That whispering hook is awful and the production feels very generic H&M music. Bullying queens APRIL outsold

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): Hey, remember when EXO-K and EXO-M existed? Haha...For those not in the know, when they first debuted in 2012 EXO was split into 2 units of EXO-K (the K standing for Korean) and EXO-M (the M standing for Mandarin, except that 2 of the 6 members in this unit were fully Korean). Initially they just released Korean and Mandarin music in their respective units (hence why this is under EXO-K and not just EXO), then they started to release music as a full 12-member group under EXO in 2013. And thennn from 2014 onwards the 4 Chinese members started to leave the group (the most iconic/messy departure being Kris Wu’s, which is what led to leader Suho accepting a music show win for Overdose on stage by himself as the other members had just been informed backstage that Kris was leaving the group). So EXO still released Korean and Mandarin versions of their albums, just as a full group now, until SM decided to give up on that and now acts like none of that ever happened. Anyway, K-pop history lesson over, I gave this a 6 because it’s not very good and I was always more of an EXO-M girl <3

**wavingwolves** (4.9): This song actually sucks. I don't have anything to say other than that every second this spent on the top 10 made me feel like my forehead veins would explode out of the pure rage it caused me, so I'm glad this is placing here instead. Also, if this was by any group other than EXO it would be Day 1 and NO ONE call tell me otherwise because I'm right!

---

# Too much is never too much

**DraculaWeekend** (11): A bop, iconic, someone call a doctor, etc.

**moonagenightmares** (11): I wouldn’t have become a kpoppie if it wasn’t for this song, i think i listened to it every day for a month straight. The mini album is also exo’s best, not a SINGLE skip

**2dina3dworld** (10): EXO is the horniest kpop boy group, I swear. From the weird sexy furry boyfriend angle of Wolf and Growl, to *ahem*, the BDSM undertones of this song, SM really said “we’re going to get the people into the mood to raise the birth rate”

**galaxy\_rae** (10): so much nostalgia and it’s still iconic

**grey/0x976** (10): set the bar high early as hell in their careers and continued to raise it with each release its true

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song is EXO-llent

**PSSST12** (10): I remember watching this for the first time and being absolutely scalped by that opening formation 😭😭 good times before shit truly went down with kris' departure 😔

**runaway3212** (10): god I miss drugs

**sssaaage** (10): overdose antis DNI literally such a smash

**throwawayforshady** (10): The most superior EXO title track

**Jhe116** (9.5): Someone said the intro sounds like “porn porn porn porn gay porn gay porn gay porn”

**bespectacIed** (9): i have nothing substantial to say except that EXO truly the most visually-rich group in kpop ever like SM literally chose MODELS that happened to be performers

**BoneStreetSand** (9): This song was a minor cultural reset for me at the time.

**ebooks #5454** (9): the maze runner looks great

**hyphen-happy** (9): feel like im ranking exo songs too high but this is just somehow the selection of my fav titles ok

**SlphWsp** (9): Too much snare drum, even if the drum choreo is iconic. Hilarious that they open with Labrinth's "come in" for an mv set in a labyrinth. Less great rap

**snugsnhugs** (9): catchy af, the drum hit dance in the chorus is one of my all time favorites, what more can i say

**throwaway7650** (9): the dramatics of the bridge are so good, the production in general is top tier. the EXO-M version though >>> luhan my meow meow [2]

**PRADA** (8.6): aged like wine i fear

**jaskiwhere** (8.5): someone call them a doctor...they've been trapped in that box for 10 years...

**nyoom** (8.5): god their superpower worldbuilding shit is so lame but i love the aesthetic. props to d.o. for not pissing off the hair&makeup team this time or whatever else results in how bad his hair looks usually, and kai for not having asian dreads again (congrats on the absolute bare minimum, dude!). luhan looks like your parents' friends' kid you got financially exploited babysitting in middle school, or perhaps little my. someone who can gif things please gif him shuffle-waddling forward at 2:26-7 it's so funny to me. suho had to go to confession after this probably.

**orbiteezus** (8.5): i used to find this song just ok but its been growing on me so much recently, and the rap verse here is like the best in any exo song

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): this reminds me a bit like a *NSYNC song

**cleopatroclus** (8.2): this song is horny asf, good for them good for them

**Zypker125** (8.2): I used to be at a 10 on this song, but the loud alarm instrumentals (you probably know which ones I’m talking about) make the song nearly unlistenable for me, which is unfortunate, because I really like every other part of this song.

**Heedictated** (8.1): decent but little replay value

**1998tweety** (8): serve

**cremeebrulee** (8): oh wow the maze runner reboot looks good

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Weirdos who like the music video mix of this song better because it throws it over to EXO-M for the second verse raise your hands! 🙋🏻‍♂️

**taeneon** (8): omg fun story i used to be a huge exo fan and i found out kris was leaving before one of my gcse exams and i was so heartbroken and confused i couldn't focus on the exam skjdksl

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): wasn't much of a fan but now I love it. The bridge is amazing, and the song has such a satisfying choreography.

**weappreciatepowers** (8): good drop

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): Someone call the doctor! But not for me.

**cherryices** (7.5): i prefer both of the songs this samples tbh

**suffocatedbears** (7.5): nice chorus

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): it's no Tempo but the timbaland/danja-esque mid-00s vibe is nice

**BebeLuigi** (7): one of their more forgettable single but still good

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): I feel like my opinion isn’t wholly unbiased given that I absolutely love Siyeon’s cover, but my favorite of the selected EXO songs.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): I was gonna rank it lower but I like it the more I listen to it


# Too much is actually too much in this case SOMEONE CALL A DOCTOR


**rotating3Dtext** (7): this is just monster 2

**aestheticen** (6): Did not age well

**CrimsonROSET** (6): it’s like they lost the energy they had going into the chorus by the second time they sing it

**elleyonce** (6): The standard EXO in question

**useless-sheep** (5.8): what are these knife sharpening noises :audience:

**hikkaru** (5): points for the bridge that's it

**Sedona83** (5): Forgettable but decent production

**skargardin** (5): this is a bit chaotic :grinny:

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Ciara did it better, sorry boys. Love EXO, but this is their weakest entry here. Placing this right after Monster made this sound very half baked.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): the long lost 3rd movie in the Cube series

**foxinthenoodles** (4): One of the few misses in EXO's discography. Just flatter than I want it to sound, and only really works if seen with their choreography.

**wavingwolves** (11): Honestly, 2015 was my second favourite year for k-pop releases (the first was 2017) and this is probably my favourite song from that whole year. It was pretty much the song that introduced me to GOT7 and made me fully notice them and ever since I've been a fan. This was produced by the iconique k-pop producing duo Black Eyed Pilseung and while they never got to work with GOT7 again but the one time they did it was pure magic. While GOT7 got a lot of attention from the international community with Just Right, it was If You Do that got all the acclaim, and deservedly so. It's a fan favourite and one of the songs that even non-fans usually enjoy to some extent, which is why it has its space in this rate. This song feels angsty without feeling whiny, which is the kind of balance similar moodier songs have trouble reaching. It was actually a pretty easy choice for a 11 considering that I love this song and I have deeply emotional attachment to it, so here it is, and I'm glad this was able to be the highest GOT7 song here. But couldn't this be higher? It could. It deserved so too.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): What a banger! And GOT7’s best song in my opinion, even though I know that’s kind of a cop-out. This is the most-known song out of the three GOT7 songs in this rate so I knew it would place the highest out of all of them, I just thought it would be a teeeeny bit higher.

---


# They did it 


**aestheticen** (11): Still remember when I first got into K-pop and I was not enjoying Fly or Hard Carry, so my aghase friend recommended me to check this out and damn, I was sold instantly. The genius in that talking line in the bridge... your favs can only wish!

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece, mature rnb bop

**bobaroma** (10): No words needed. Their best song period

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I'LL JUST GO TO SLEEP

**fadedblue09** (10): Their signature song, and my preferred flavor of angsty concept (more emotion, less intimidation). I know some people wanted them to stick to this concept but their inconsistency has made them stand out, funnily enough.

**grey/0x976** (10): more impact and relevance than beethovens 5th symphony... got7: daesang, music show wins, fans internationally and beethoven? No daesang :/ 0 mcountdown wins :(((((( no one outside of music nerd circles are streaming thats #sad

**hunnybee12** (10): their best title and it's not even close it's amazing

**PSSST12** (10): An 11 contender. In the sea of genericness that is got7's discography, this was the shining jewel. The first time they released this I thought immediately that they will never top this and I was right.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Now for Got7's best song... Wish I could say that I liked the rest of their work this much but it always felt like they were trying too too hard to be all "Look at us we're bad-ass" (This applies mostly to their early work, which would have been all that was available to me at the time when this originally dropped.) except for like Just Right that one is just weird. (Although... I do kinda like Girls Girls Girls as a guilty pleasure...) This is just such a solid song all around from the idk moodiness of it to the fucking spoken interlude to the visuals of the entire era. Now let's just hope that this is their highest scoring song in the rate.

**specialtrickholdA** (10): Why was this the only time Black Eyed Pilseung worked with GOT7 they could’ve made MAGIC 😭

**sssaaage** (10): a very easy 10, all got7 songs here are incredible its true

**suffocatedbears** (10): i love an emotional bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): oh the verses in this are lovely and that buildup into the chorus is gorjuss

**bulforster** (9.6): never quite gets over the top but still love

**nctdreamsqd** (9.5): The female monologue kept it from being a ten

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.5): a BOP

**throwaway7650** (9.5): mark please be quiet... perfect song otherwise. one of BEP's best tbh. also lily's monologue in the bridge is iconic... queen shit

**2dina3dworld** (9): I was going to make a comment on the "British girl" who does the lines in the song. Turns out she's Lily M, and Lily M is Australian, and as a Kiwi I feel extreme shame.

**chenle** (9): they snapped with this one they truly did...

**hasanella** (9): dude this song lives in my head for sulking hours

**Heedictated** (9): one of the few title tracks I enjoy from GOT7

**ignitethephoenix** (9): lol what’s with the talking part of the random British sounding girl in the middle? Bop otherwise

**SlphWsp** (9): Smooth and groovy, just good melodies

**weappreciatepowers** (9): SO GOOD?

**BoneStreetSand** (8.9): I mean, they’re my ult group, but in this video, they seem like seven stalkers and it’s lowkey scary. Like I’d open the door to let Yugyeom in every time he knocks unless he knocks like he did in the music video. Nevertheless, song still hits. Such a classic.

**celladonn** (8.5): When is the Australian queen who does the spoken word bit going to debut

**jaskiwhere** (8.5): A spoken interlude done right

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): the random aussie girl doing the bridge took me tf out

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): that f*cking chorus

**akanewasright** (8): im seeing translated subtitles right now and there’s a lot going on in these lyrics…… But it sounds nice so it’s cool

**BebeLuigi** (8): the production is great on this

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): This song is just very pleasant. I always enjoy it whenever it comes on. The girl talking in the middle of the song is a little bit weird though.

**nyoom** (8): i like this song, even though (because?) the lyrics give off really weird vibes. it's clear this is a toxic relationship but there are hints that make me question whether this is a reliable narrator and whether he might not actually be the abuser gaslighting her (he considers all her male friends sexual rivals she shouldn't be spending time with, the female voiceover part just sounds tired and says avoidant things like "it's up to you if you wanna break up," contradicting his accusations that she constantly weaponizes the threat of breaking up and is always blowing up at him). i think if that were the intended takeaway, or if you're at least meant to ask those questions, that that's really interesting and unexpected from a pop song. also everyone should familiarize themselves with the principles of DARVO if they haven't already!

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): It kinda feels like it could be a 2PM song

**seanderlust** (8): they said every day every night i'm boo boo the fool and I felt that. also this one aged like wine - six years later it still holds up so well

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): insanely catchy

**PRADA** (7.9): their best song yass

**liberalitea** (7.8): i just ignore the bridge

# Going to sleep


**bluetriangles04** (7.5): This song has always been paraded and considered as GOT7’s magnum opus but for me there are quite a few parts of the song that ultimately ruin the flow for me such as the voicemail parts (or whatever those are) and although I loved this era, this is far from my favorite GOT7 title.

**cleopatroclus** (7.4): super fun but starts to get dull

**Zypker125** (7.2): I don’t like the English/rap parts, they just feel more cringy than they feel emotional to me (GOT7’s rap-line has always been a weakness for me in terms of their music). The bridge also just doesn’t work at all. However, the chorus is super catchy and redeems most of the song.

**cremeebrulee** (7): not the taylor spoken word esque interlude

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): Eh not the most interesting, just alright

**elleyonce** (6): I know everybody loves it but I really do think this sounds aged as hell and the melody is very whiny.

**frogaranaman** (6): cover art is serving indie kid friend group Instagram posts showing off their fit

**Sedona83** (6): Nice build up to chorus

**10footnotes** (5.5): It’s not perfect, or even anywhere near great, on a technical level, but the hooks are decent and I think the sincerity is endearing!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): do what? please do something anything i’m begging you

**ebooks #5454** (5): i'll just go to sleep

**snugsnhugs** (5): its alright, almost sounds like it could have been a 2PM song

**moonagenightmares** (4.7): you know when you can tell a song is going to be boring from the first 5 seconds… this was that

**foxinthenoodles** (4): Everything besides the catchy pre chorus (which even feels out of place) is dated and uninteresting.

# Jules, why do you hate me 

**runaway3212** (3): why are half of all iconic kpop songs so terrible

**wavingwolves** (10): MAKE ME FEEL SO HIGH MICHIGESSEO NAN MEOMCHUL SU EOPSEO!!!! I can't give this song any other score because it reminds me of the time of my life where I was OBSESSED with Season 2 of Produce 101. I even cried before the group was formed once while waiting for a bus and then I ended up never following the group because their output outside of this song and some other was bad. But I was so into it when it was airing that it was actually the whole reason as to why I even made a Reddit account in the first place: I just wanted to have a place to fully rave about it and I found a sub dedicated to it. And you know what this means, if it wasn't for Produce 101 I probably wouldn't ever be here hosting this rate. Everyone say "THANK YOU, MNET!!!" just this once, please.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): Funnily enough, I was away for a few weeks without WiFi when Energetic came out and I also never cared much about Produce 101 so the first time I heard this song in full is actually when we were putting together the rate. Yes, despite how much this song smashed in Korea and how Wanna One were briefly THE biggest boy group for the short time they were together, I just never checked it out. I’m mad I slept on it for so long because it’s a massive banger. It doesn’t really do anything special or innovating like maybe some of the other songs in this rate but who cares - it’s a great pop song. Also this song is produced and written by Hui from Pentagon, who at the time was probably bitter Energetic smashed more than any Pentagon song AND r/popheads has also decided Energetic is better than Shine…#apologisetohui.

---

# MAKE ME FEEL SO HIGH!!!!!


**1998tweety** (10): Outside of this I didn't care much for Wanna One's output (just a bit too boring) but whew they set the bar high with their debut

**bespectacIed** (10): Too good. It's weird now to think that at one point W1 was legitimately the biggest group in korea (below bts at least)

**DaBigBoi** (10): Hui had to pay the bills for Pentagon somehow

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My original 11 choice, but EXO (and then NU'EST) won me over, I fear.

**grey/0x976** (10): X1 couldnt do it

**hikkaru** (10): this is just the most FUN song i have ever heard. I'M FEELING SO ENERGETIC !!!!!

**hunnybee12** (10): SMASHHHH

**nyoom** (10): Never was a solid 11 but this is fine too, i say like i don't go full hype scrunching up my entire face lip synching on the bus whenever this comes on. this is a perfect song.

**PSSST12** (10): AN 11 CONTENDER. still remains as wannaone's best song along with "Gold". That chorus is pop perfection and INDEED makes me feel so high 😤

**sssaaage** (10): so true kings

**suffocatedbears** (10): this is really their best title

**throwawayforshady** (10): Produce s2 fans RISE UP

**weappreciatepowers** (10): ?

**Heedictated** (9.7): one of the best title tracks from an idol group formed on a survival show (yes including the Chinese/Japanese ones)

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Produce 101 was going to fail eventually, not necessarily because of rigging or anything, but because there simply are not that many people in Korea who make for good idol trainees, especially if you're clipping through a hundred a year. That being said, when it was good, it was really good. And PD101 S2 was great. This song is emblematic of the boyish energy that surrounded that season - a real triumph before Produce's fall.

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): Hui gets a high five and a pocket mint that has been sitting on my vanity for this absolute banger.

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): A wonderful pop ballad that showcases so much talent. The song feels like an event, and the progression through its runtime is one of the most satisfying in kpop.

**bobaroma** (9): cringy rap at times but cute! still enerzetic

**ebooks #5454** (9): minus points for the weird man piano formation in the beginning

**Leixander** (9): wish it took a risk to have an explosive moment near the end like the chaser did, amazing song nevertheless

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): I still have “you make me feel so high” stuck in my head

**seanderlust** (9): i love the low synth stabs here!! fun upbeat airy bop

**SlphWsp** (9): Fun and feel good yet wistful, creative and quirky choreo, refreshing rap, adlibs, so much potential

**Zypker125** (9): The song is bogged down by its first verse, which takes too long to start, feels too empty/quiet, and is too drastically low-energy compared to the rest of the song. However, the rest of the song flows super well and is super pleasant to listen to. The transitions are super nice.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): this song wants what View has but it's still excellent

**jasannn** (8.5): Hui really put his whole bussy into this song

**RandomHypnotica** (8): idk if this is about a girl or an energy drink

**snugsnhugs** (8): such a bop

**throwaway7650** (8): bop, stockholm'd myself on the raps though I fear

**BoneStreetSand** (7.9): I really didn’t like the English lyrics. Almost kills the song.

**PRADA** (7.9): smash yasss

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the beginning of this had be worried this wouldn’t be an energetic song


# Not high enough 


**aestheticen** (7): I never really got the hype with this song not gonna lie

**jaskiwhere** (7): I like the chorus but the rest of it falls flat for me

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): Don't think I'll ever love a Produce series group as much as I loved I.O.I, but this is alright.

**skargardin** (7): ironically i wanted just a bit more energy

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): idk why but this is kinda bland

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why such a lax beat on a song called ‘energetic’ like it wasn’t that hard half of them sound like they’re still waking up

**moonagenightmares** (5.9): almost forgot how mediocre wanna one were

**BebeLuigi** (5): quite whatever to me

**lonelyglory** (5): It's the song I enjoyed the most out of this group... and I only tolerated it (yikes)

**spacebunsailor** (5): the bad kind of noise

**fadedblue09** (3.3): It's really hard for me to connect with the Produce groups in general but also this is just so….overproduced. The vocals sound like they're all trying to outsing each other.

**Sedona83** (3): Don't like vocalists, not very good

funimarvel: Definitely those plus Poison, Page, Run Away, Thursday, Pray, Love You Better, Q, Aura. They have so many amazing B-sides.

But their title tracks can be good too, especially when JYP allows the members to make them (Tomorrow, Today by JJP, Breath by Youngjae and Look by JB are some of my favorites).

Also their Japanese releases need more love. Love Loop is a perfect album.

I liked Encore and I'm so excited to see what they do next as GOT7 now that they have creative control (having left JYP).

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Weirdly I actually didn’t super love this song in 2019 (it was like an 8) but over time it just slowly grew on me to become a 10. I love how smooth this song is and I still think it’s Baekhyun’s best title track (as an aside, Baekhyun if you’re reading this please go back to the Take You Home/Dream/Rain sound instead of releasing your 4th R&B album…).

**wavingwolves** (7.3): And weirdly I actually really liked this upon release but grew to think it isn't that good. While I do enjoy this well enough, I can't seem to like it as much as other people do. It's by far Baekhyun's best title, but that doesn't say much since I'm not the biggest fan of his work. What I REALLY love about this is the pre-chorus. The melody in that is insanely charming and I always feel a little swayed when I listen to it, but the chorus itself feels like it lacks that same level of charm.

---

**1998tweety** (10): he really started with this masterpiece as his debut

**BebeLuigi** (10): Baekhyun imo has the best solo discography in EXO, his 3 albums are amazing

**bobaroma** (10): Baekhyun doing his thang. Just so smooth

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Baekyhun's solo work is so good and this song is probably one of my favorites

**hasanella** (10): nothing can top this baekhyun is just my favorite all of his solo albums are like honey

**hyphen-happy** (10): probably my most listened to song on the list

**moonagenightmares** (10): baekhyun always delivering

**SlphWsp** (10): This instrumental is so good, also my favourite voice in kpop, that vocal tone, late night chilling, such a visually pleasing mv, this song will never get old, his entire solo discography is ear candy

**snugsnhugs** (10): Baekhyun's voice is a gift from the gods and put on this R&B track is just perfect

**sssaaage** (10): baekhyun king of coffee shop music

**throwaway7650** (10): what a great solo debut, I'm good with this winning

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): may still be his best title track. Suits him so well, it feels so expensive.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): I haven't listened to any of Baekhyun's solo music until this very moment and now I see the errors of my ways.

**cleopatroclus** (9.3): his vocals are great as always but the instrumentals like the background guitar make this

**BoneStreetSand** (9.2): I put off listening to this song for a long time. I’m not sure why. This could’ve been in my life or nine years. Then again, if I got into Baekhyun earlier, Jopping would’ve been more offensive than it was.

**Heedictated** (9.2): not a huge rnb fan but baekhyun's beautiful voice carried the song well

**skargardin** (9): smashing

**weappreciatepowers** (9): this is actually nice

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Honestly he's my least fave EXO main vocal but this is such a serve! This is so sultry and slick.

**bluetriangles04** (8): Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo tease!

**foxinthenoodles** (8): A vocal showcase on a chill track.

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): A smooth, sensual jam, which is always up my alley.

**Sedona83** (7.5): Nice R&B, great vocals

**2dina3dworld** (7): when I think of romance, I always think of the iconic UN village where they shot the Korean version of the world famous Produce series

**nyoom** (6.5): oh i thought this would be some kind of global market promo song baekhyun did as like cultural ambassador or whatever, i was expecting ~we are all one village it's a small world after all~ well it's nice

**Zypker125** (1): I hate R&B music, and UN Village is no exception. This song is just super boring, the city-pop vibes just bring down the song, and there’s nothing interesting musically.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): A-KKIN-DA! This is definitely one of my fave SVT titles, I just think it’s so fun. ~~I find it amusing that you can see how completely broke Pledis were at this time as they couldn’t even give SVT a decent debut MV. But the absolute lack of budget adds to the charm!~~ I assumed this song would do well as I don’t generally see people disliking it, so I’m glad it was able to climb up all the way to #12.

**wavingwolves** (9.3): This song feels so youthful and joyful, I genuinely love and I think there's no other group that quite does songs like this outside of SVT and I love that for them. The MV for this is, weirdly enough, one of my favourites in rate just because of the goofiness of it, it does help elevate the song for me. It almost gives it more identity. And I'll forever sing BABY YOU'RE MY ANSWERRR!!! at the bridge, I don't care for real lyrics.

---

# Adoring fans

**2dina3dworld** (10): I absolutely adore this song (no pun intended!). It’s so adorable, pure and addictive

**agentofscranton** (10): seventeen’s vocal line would be the best vocal line of all the bgs were it not for d.o.’s existence but still! dk, seungkwan, and woozi are unreal vocalists

**bookthieving** (10): adore u is a funky pop song that has fun and fresh lyrics that match seventeen’s age on top of an addictive melody

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay that very early 90s new jack swing drum fill that leads into the chorus... i was caught offguard in the best way by that

**cremeebrulee** (10): we love gucci for spreading the svt agenda through discord emotes and gifs

**elleyonce** (10): Best debut of the late 2010s with Winner's Empty and it's not even close.

**frogaranaman** (10): !np come fuck me I'm horny

**Leixander** (10): wow this was great from start to finish, beautifully produced, amazing chorus, love the growl on first verse

**moonagenightmares** (10): i remember absolutely loving this when it dropped, shame they never delivered an #experimental masterpiece like this again

**PSSST12** (10): I never heard much from seventeen as I don't follow them quite closely but this song snatched me the moment that chorus hit. That yoo-hoo-hoo part by woozi (?) Changed me.

**rickikardashian** (10): WOOZI I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY MEOW MEOW

**SlphWsp** (10): What a debut, fun and catchy with great energy, vocals rap and choreo all wonderful, so much personality comes through in their performance, still sounds so fresh

**throwaway7650** (10): hilarious how jeonghan isn't on this track and he lips to seungkwan's voice. iconic debut song, my favorite one in this rate

**Zypker125** (9.7): The MV is absolutely tragic, but Woozi’s song is pretty much flawless. It’s fun, energetic, diverse, and fast-paced. Only complaint is that the second verse doesn’t hold up well, the raps there are pretty weak and they’re clearly trying to force in parts to give to The8/Jun/Joshua.

**chenle** (9.5): whoever wrote this bassline has my whole heart

**orbiteezus** (9.5): this song has grown on me a lot over the last month, its just so fun and happy and the main vocals are amazing

**TiltControls** (9.5): really love this!

**cherryices** (9.4): looking camp right in the eye

**Heedictated** (9.4): fun af song with great vocal melodies and theatrical rap

**sssaaage** (9.3): i love gay people

**bigbigbee** (9): I think that three boy groups have perfect debuts: SHINee, TXT, and then this one. This is fun, the choreography's iconic, it doesn't sound like a lot of other boy groups out at the time...nice job.

**DaBigBoi** (9): ADORE THIS

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): SVT can do Adore You but Harry Styles can't do Adore U,

**fadedblue09** (9): Honestly my least favorite of their original trilogy (Mansae and Pretty U >>>) but it's still fun. MV is lowkey tragic though

**hyphen-happy** (9): this song gives me pure joy

**Jhe116** (9): Pledis knows how to debut a group but doesn’t know how to maintain one. SEVENTEEN is a rare exception that PLEDIS managed to do both

**lonelyglory** (9): It's an amazing debut and a great representative song for the era of fresh boy groups. While I prefer Pretty U over this in terms of their early bright songs, this track still brings a consistent smile to my face.

**seanderlust** (9): LOVE the synths in this one and the transitions from spoken parts to singing are my angeeeellllll

**skargardin** (9): [the autofill cover for this song on the youtube scrobbler absolutely propelled me into orbit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/575930044212576271/859866459807547402/unknown.png)

**hasanella** (8.5): adore you i do

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I really enjoy this, a bop

**jasannn** (8.5): Congrats Gucci, the SVT agenda worked. While I don't love it (yet), the fantastic chorus keeps me coming back for more. This is definitely my favorite discovery of the rate.

**nyoom** (8.5): seventeen has not theater kid energy but theater TROUPE energy, in the best sense. YOO-HOOO

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): Hey I remember when this dropped! My first impression back then was "Eh the song is a thing, but the one with the long hair is cute." That chorus can and will get stuck in your head tho! Also known as: Yes, I still remember it. But also I think I was too harsh on this on release. This is good!

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): bop

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**aestheticen** (8): I have a very complicated on/off relationship with this song where I go from liking the song to getting bored of it really quick then liking it again and repeat

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Great fun and light song.

**grey/0x976** (8): seeing gay men happy makes me happy

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/390648593331126273/861116846631944212/unknown.png

**Roxieloxie** (8): harry styles remains untouched, but he did feel a chill in the air for a slight second

**snugsnhugs** (8): cute! Yoohoo!

**suffocatedbears** (8): i really like seventeen's bright concept when they first debuted

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Don't think I've ever heard a bad song called Adore U/You

**universemates** (8): Kings of fresh concept

**BoneStreetSand** (7.8): I always wanted to get into these boys, but I can’t help but feel a little bit disappointed.

**10footnotes** (7): It’s a little rough around the edges, and I think Mansae and Pretty U have aged better as representatives of their “freshteen” sound, but as their debut song, Adore U did a great job establishing SVT’s style and charisma right out of the gate!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Did I lower it a whole point as soon as I heard ‘yoo-hoo’? Yes I did. Am I wrong for doing it? No I’m not.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): I’m such a sucker for seventeen it’s not even funny

**RandomHypnotica** (7): a cute little moment, a little lowkey compared to the other SEVENTEEN tracks

**Sedona83** (7): Fun song, cool video


# Antis


**HeartofDarkness123** (6): I wasn’t feeling it until the chorus, where it’s very fun. I love the background guitar. The chorus is a blessing in my ears, and everything else sucks.

**PRADA** (6): one of their weakest titles but still kings

**jaskiwhere** (5): I adore Seungkwan and that's the only reason this got a five

**BebeLuigi** (4): I really love Seventeen but the rate has 3 tracks of them I don't really care for or outright hate :'(

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): NA EUREUREONG EUREUREONG EUREUREONGDAE NA EUREUREONG EUREUREONG EUREUREONGDAE!!! What else is there to say except that this is such a banger and somehow even better than I remember. The chorus and choreo are both so fun, it’s no wonder this had Korea in a chokehold in 2013 and is one of the most successful songs in the rate.

**wavingwolves** (7.1): As iconic as it is and as big as it was, this placement feels too high when it comes to the actual quality of the song and what really made this go so far was pure nostalgia because it didn't really age that well at all. I still can admit that it's a really fun song and what most helped to cement EXO as the leaders of 3rd generation boy groups, even if now it has turned itself into one of the weakest EXO titles.

# NA EUREUREONG EUREUREONG EUREUREONGDAE NA EUREUREONG EUREUREONG EUREUREONGDAE

**PSSST12** (11): NOW. THE MOST LEGENDARY BOP ON THIS RATE 😤 Iconic. Talented brilliant incredible etc.  My final candidates for my 11 is a three way death lock between This, monster and the chaser. I was initially gonna give it to the chaser but then I revisited the MV of this song and that camera work and choreo still ends me to this day. 😫 The production was quite simple but they make it much more dynamic with their vocal performance and dancing. I still remember simping over suho in 2013 when this dropped lmaoooo. One of their best songs and easily on the top 10 best kpop songs of all time.

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song is a cultural icon, not just because of the song itself, or the dance, or the styling, but because of the legends surrounding this era. From the crazy sasaengs, to the ghost urban legends, and the Growl + Wolf drama music videos that put most k-dramas to shame, this was truly a cultural reset

**agentofscranton** (10): sehun’s barely two seconds of lines ladygagaihavetolaugh.jpg

**akanewasright** (10): This slaps

**bespectacIed** (10): The Single Ladies-ification of EXO. Still remember being amazed by the simple, seemingly one take dance mv, i thought it was a baller move from SM to do that at least once for their flagship BG.  And this song fucking bangsss (p.s. the english demo is so good)

**bobaroma** (10): Song of 2013

**cremeebrulee** (10): i might need to stan exo now 🥵

**DraculaWeekend** (10): EXO are dance kings and this MV proves it

**ebooks #5454** (10): when i was in HS 4 girls from one of the kpop dance clubs did a dance cover of this song and they were all phenomenal i was BIG GAY for all of them

**emmach17** (10): Possible the most iconic kpop song ever

**fadedblue09** (10): Idk about other people but this song was a MOMENT (like, Gee levels of ubiquitous). But besides that, this is just a perfect representation of EXO in general: the vocals, the choreo, the iconic one-take MV...just chef’s kiss.

**foxinthenoodles** (10): Simple, clean but forward thinking. Perfectly mixed, impeccably produced and wonderfully executed.

**grey/0x976** (10): exo best kpop bg IDGAF! #SORRY NCTIZENS u will NEVER recreate the excellence that was EXO but u can keep screaming about how succesful ur nugu group is on twitter maybe it'll get them more acclaim :genericsad: this is a joke btw i just wanted to drag nct and fill out rate comments

**Jhe116** (10): Iconic one-shot music video, EXO and R&B can do no wrong. Speaking of One Shot, the music video for One Shot is iconic too, gave that song a 9.5 for your reference

**lonelyglory** (10): That guitar riff is etched into my soul

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song is EXO-llent

**orbiteezus** (10): god i love the instrumental melody so much here, it kinda reminds me of the pink panther theme song, and the bridge is just so amazing

**plastichaxan** (10): exo was one of the few encounters i’d had on kpop before the rate in general and this reminded me why i liked what i heard back then

**SlphWsp** (10): RnB excellence this aged like fine wine, mv and choreo are legendary, just VOCALS my ears are crying with happiness truly an anthem

**specialtrickholdA** (10): NA EUREUREONG EUREUREONG EUREUREONGDAE has to be one of the best hooks in k-pop.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): The grey outfits from this MV / the school yearbook theme is iconic, as is the one-take MV (whether it's "one take" is disputable but I still remember being impressed as hell when this came out.) This is one hell of an earworm.

**TiltControls** (9.5): grrr

**moonagenightmares** (9.4): this is actually so much better than i remembered, go AWF kyungsoo

**Zypker125** (9.3): I used to be a 10 on this song, but I’ve slightly fallen out of love with this song. It’s still a catchy banger, but the pre-choruses and bridge lower the energy of the song too much, and the rap bridge is kinda underwhelming. However, the high notes and chorus are great as always.

**BebeLuigi** (9): yasssss exo is my favorite band we stan

**bluetriangles04** (9): A classic, great song, great dance, great breakdown. I feel like this is just one of the cornerstone SM songs with that same formula.

**hyphen-happy** (9): listen if wolf was on my list it'd be getting my 11 for the chogiwa

**nyoom** (9): this was a Moment but also i looked up the lyrics as a refresher before i listened and i almost screamed. "a black shadow awakens in me" https://bit.ly/3wkRZc6 hilarious that the chinese version kept 으르렁 even tho chinese people have no frame of reference that that's onomatopoeia for growling and the chorus just went like "i eureoreong eureoreong eureoreong you"

**Sedona83** (9): Korea's national anthem lol

**snugsnhugs** (9): sexy, fun, vocals for days, love it

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): at first I didn't get the hype but now I really love it. There are a lot of memorable parts and the MV and choreography are iconic.

**cleopatroclus** (8.8): never noticed the sexy so sexy whispered in the start so that bumps this up, altho playboy whispering >>

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): needs more furry representation

**jasannn** (8.5): They redeemed themselves from Wolf.

**jaskiwhere** (8.5): This song is stupid catchy but -1.5 for like half the chorus dance moves for existing and for the music video literally taking place in an abandoned warehouse (where did that big 3 budget go lmao)

**nctdreamsqd** (8.5): The beat really gets you grooving

**seanderlust** (8.5): can the basement they run EXO out of please pay their light bill

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): a cute song but i am glad they moved on to greater things

**useless-sheep** (8.5): yass i guess

**BoneStreetSand** (8.4): I love the beat to this! Transported me instantly back to being fourteen.

**cherryices** (8.4): the chorus really outshines the verses

**1998tweety** (8): cute bop

**aestheticen** (8): rawr xd

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Ah yes, the "classic SM dance music video shot in one set for low-risk, maximum profit". It's a good thing SM has talented idols with great stage presence.

**hasanella** (8): pretty solid song

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Oh look, another song where I completely fail at the choreography but that doesn't stop me from trying!

**taeneon** (8): ICONIC

**throwaway7650** (8): a basic bop. luhan my meow meow I miss you #EXO-M #OT12

**rickikardashian** (7.5): they don't growl one single time during this song, 0/5 would not recommend

**bulforster** (7.4): I was not feeling this at all at first but it really starts to recover with that smooth prechorus.

**Heedictated** (7.1): I actually prefer Wolf unironically blasphemous I know but this song just kinda bores me

**10footnotes** (7): Truly one of the funniest K-pop songs ever: you guys are wearing schoolboy uniforms, please stop telling us how you studied the blade. The chorus goes off though: this is one of SM’s best ever executions of full group harmonies.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): it's no Tempo but i like the throwback early 90s sound

**skargardin** (7): they ate this choreo tf up

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): Not my favorite song by them but the beat is so catchy

**wavingwolves** (9.5): I love this song but I can't stand the way we didn't get that little vocalisation moment we have in the end of the MV in the official versions of the song because it's quite literallu the best part of it and it goes unused properly.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): This was initially gonna be my 0 so...count yourself lucky, ARMYs! Truth be told, I flip-flop on this song so much. Sometimes I love it, sometimes I hate it, sometimes I think it’s just fine. Ultimately, I decided to give it a neutral score of 5 with an extra 1.5 points added for the “You know it all / you’re my best friend” line and the gorgeous MV. I will say I would find the song more enjoyable if certain production and vocal choices hadn’t been made, but at least the vocal processing and mixing here isn’t as bad as it would be in a later stage of their career. Anyway, I definitely get the appeal of this song and it’s not surprising to me at all that this is the longest-charting song in South Korea ever.

# Spring lovers 

**dekubaku** (11): There is something truly special in this song that cannot be recreated.

**Heedictated** (11): the song has come to mean so much more both on a personal level and also to bangtan that it has become one of the unique songs that can make me cry more than once

**1998tweety** (10): what can i say its a masterpiece (the hamfisted rap verses into a ballad don't ruin it either)

**aestheticen** (10): A good evocative ballad, you don’t get that a lot these days

**BoneStreetSand** (10): One of the best songs of all time.

**celladonn** (10): They snapped with this one

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a classic

**emmach17** (10): All hail queen Spring Day

**fadedblue09** (10): Ok ARMY made some points here. I just love it when boygroups pour their emotions out and the lyrics just feel so resonant. Also this feels like one of those songs that transcend time, age and genre. No wonder it's a Melon mainstay.

**frogaranaman** (10): what a beautiful song

**grey/0x976** (10): i do not beg men to kiss me. imma ask jimin 11 times and thats it SORRY i watched this mv again it truly is another career highlight,

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): It’s a very pretty song and it successfully invokes a wistful mournfulness really well.

**hunnybee12** (10): their best title 😇 so sweet and soothing

**hyphen-happy** (10): don't ever listen to it now but at some point this was my fav bts song

**jaskiwhere** (10): What a beautiful, evocative song - I'm sad and nostalgic listening to it, yet hopeful as well. Always a good song to put on no matter my emotions (and the string instruments are beautiful in the background).

**lonelyglory** (10): A masterpiece plain and simple. It feels like the crisp winter air around you that brings both a sense of serenity and a melancholy. Once the air gets cold this is consistently back in top rotation for me.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): Same thoughts as Run

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I might’ve outgrown my bts phase, but this song still makes me feel things

**Sedona83** (10): Also BTS at their best

**SFbby** (10): What do you get when you combine a phenomenal sentimental ballad with a seasonal theme (Like Cherry Blossom Ending or I Will Go to You Like the First Snow)? A hit song that'll last forever and be remembered as an artistic peak even within an absolutely jam-packed career, and that's exactly what BTS did here.

**specialtrickholdA** (10): I’ve never been a big BTS fan for a multitude of reasons but this song is undeniably brilliant. I miss the days when they were actually making some forward thinking music and not dumbing their sound down further and further just to get hits on western radio.

**suffocatedbears** (10): i feel a little emotional listening to this song again, this deserves to be no 1 on billboard (':

**TiltControls** (10): It just feels like a warm hug!~

**universemates** (10): The only drawback to this song is certain production choices. I wish we could have gotten the dreamy production like the one in the teaser. However, the melody is so pretty and the lyrics are gorgeous so this song is still a 10.

**Zypker125** (10): IIRC, this song was the K-Pop Redditors’ favorite, even over other contenders like Bad Boy, The Chaser, or The 7th Sense. On a personal level, this song is one of the only ones that I’ve cried to. It’s a cinematic blend of angsty ballad-pop and hard-hitting emotional symphonies. K-Pop still hasn’t been able to make another song like this, and for good reason. My nitpick is that I feel like V’s baritone vocals didn’t match with the soft ballad-pop vibes of the song, so it’s not my 11.

**bobaroma** (9.5): You know the 10 is the Brit Rock remix.

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): One of the best pop ballads in kpop. BTS' best work. Unbelievable how they got the rap to work so well in it.

**hasanella** (9.5): this song is so bittersweet and i love it so much and the feeling of longing from this song hits me right in the gut

**bulforster** (9.3): Most expressive vocals in the rate that are not supported properly by this production.

**elleyonce** (9): The drum in the chorus to me like: Thank you for listening, thank ME for speaking.png

**PSSST12** (9): Took a while to grow on me but now it HITS. Still its a little bit overhyped imo.

**runaway3212** (9): Spring Is the second best season

**SlphWsp** (9): Beautiful song, stunning mv, feels like floating, so emotive

**spacebunsailor** (9): a melancholy bop you can cry while nodding your head along

**throwaway7650** (9): would give a 10 to the brit rock remix (watch the MV!)

**ebooks #5454** (8.9): once i heard the piano cover of this in a study playlist and it was really good but i also started crying while studying, so that was weird

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I am not even an Army but why does the song and the MV make me emotional. 😭

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): another good song VIBES

**bookthieving** (8): i kinda hate the chorus synths but i can't deny that this song makes me emotional

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I know this is considered one their best songs but it doesn’t do much for me compared to other tracks. It’s good though

**milkywayinradius** (8): i know this is going to win the rate. so hi, everybody! that sound at the chorus is just too loud for me, would have been a ten if they turned it down a little. i can't handle it at my old age

**moonagenightmares** (7.7): i like this but it could’ve been shorter

**rickikardashian** (7.7): [rip jin](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/292042312958083075/850844636306341898/unknown.png)

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): I don’t really feel what others do with this song, but it’s not bad.

**useless-sheep** (7.3): sounds deep fried but in something cold instead of hot

**akanewasright** (7): WHY DOES THE VERSION ON STREAMING/CD/WHATEVER NOT HAVE THE ENDING OF THE SONG IN THE VIDEO IM ACTUALLY MAD ITS SO NICE AND ITS JUST NOT HERE anyway the song is okay but that part is euphoric

**liberalitea** (7): this is like BTS' All Too Well, and just like it, i find it very overrated

**sssaaage** (7): bts pre mots actually so good..

**throwawayforshady** (7): Chorus >>> everything else

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): Not my thing really but still a good song. Very nostalgic.

wavingwolves: # [Hi spring bye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLDH-rcYd8c)


**seanderlust** (6.7): this grew off me then on me then off me again

**cherryices** (6.5): good song but i don’t like their vocal line enough for this kind of thing

**RandomHypnotica** (6): in comparison to the other BTS songs here, this just feels super generic

**skargardin** (6): i think i would enjoy this more if the production was a bit more muted

**snugsnhugs** (6): the chord progression is nice

**thedoctordances1940** (6): not their most boring song (cough life goes on cough) but it doesn't have all that much going for it imo.

**PRADA** (5.6): simultaneously overrated and overhated

**bigbigbee** (5): I cannot stand the way people talk about this song. Sonically, I think it's nice, but I hate how this has been canonized as "art" (on somewhat false pretenses, as I've come to understand it.) It's a fine mid-tempo song...most every boy group has one. And the production is so noisy sometimes. I legitimately avoid this song because of how much the discussion arounds it turns me off, and so that's why I feel I can't give it a higher score than I'm giving it.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): Sometimes, when I don	‘t know much about a song, I’ll put it in the search bar of the discord to see what people talk about it. There wasn’t a single comment about this song. In hindsight, I don’t know why I expected anything else.

**BebeLuigi** (4): Never been a fan of that one

**cleopatroclus** (3.8): i've heard this a lot and it rly never gets any better, mostly let down by the vocals again

**nctdreamsqd** (3): Their vocals were too breathy for my taste

**taeneon** (3): i had high expectations because i know this song has been praised a lot and is one of their most popular but i find it really boring and their tone (maybe? idk) is off

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.5): as a mariah/iu/taeyeon stan i love me a good ballad so

**bespectacIed** (0): I hate this. With the way armys hype it as some kind of life-affirming anthem, you'd think it wouldn't be bland, corny as fuck, and weirdly mixed

**nyoom** (0): i'm trying not to make all my comments about ~being korean~ but i do have to say that i don't believe for one second this song was originally intended to be a commemoration of sewolho, and i find any elevation of it based on that premise absolutely disgusting. the song starts out set in august, and also how does the line "did you change, or did i" fit into this theory? "for example, i am now a kazillionaire, and you are now deceased"? a genius annotation (since deleted but i have it capped) also mentioned jimin said they changed the lyrics from "snow" to "cherry blossoms" (the explicit reference to spring, which is when the tragedy happened) because he had pink hair during their comeback, which. / to be clear, i am not suggesting that the members of bts set out to capitalize on a national tragedy for personal gain. i AM suggesting, however, that Big Shit, a corporation whose bigwigs are undoubtedly in the same age group that very loudly denounced the parents who went on hunger strike until their children's bodies were recovered as money-hungry opportunists in the media for months, did. fucking soulless.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (0): I have never liked Spring Day and I don't think I'll start liking it anytime soon. It's genuinely so bland yet so busy that I don't know exactly how to put it into words. Like it's boring but at the same time it's like "LOUD SCREACHY SYNTHS RIGHT INTO YOUR EARS!" Genuinely not a good combo. This was the moment in their discog where I began wishing for the "old" BTS to return. And I genuinely hate to be *that kind of guy* but like... man... this misses the mark in so many places for me.

**Twohungryblackbirdss** (0): I know yall love this song but I find it nauseating sorry folks

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): There was a time in my life when this song was a 7 to me and I never got the overwhelming hype for it, but one day it just clicked with me - the production and vocals here are both so good, and this is definitely one of Chanyeol’s better raps (maybe the best in his career?). I know some people prefer the other title for this album, Lucky One, but Monster just holds a special place in my heart now! It’s easy to see why even K-pop fans who don’t like EXO think this song is good.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): I remember very well the Twitter discourse around this song lyrics being too aggressive/borderline stalking-like at the time it dropped and how it led me to actively dislike this song. Now? I see it differently. I get the same feeling from this than what I got from One Direction gang-leaders/mafia fanfiction I used to read where the main character goes "I'm soooo BAD!!! don't fall in love with!!!:( but also if you fall in love with someone else I'll stalk you and be moody and showcase excessive levels of jealousy and obsession" -- and, wait... maybe this is actually pretty bad. But misogyny does spice things up sometimes, so I'll still give it a good score. (For legal purposes this is not a serious comment.)

# Pull up in the monster automobile gangster with a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka

**grey/0x976** (11): brings out the white boy named kyle in me like i get this rush of adrenaline and idk what to do with myself besides punch some drywall or shout cuss words at my parents

**hyphen-happy** (11): probably not in my top 20 kpop bg songs but my favorite on the list, so

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): it’s THE SMASHA!!! I was immediately addicted to this explosive, epic song when my k-pop stan coworker introduced it to me, and it’s still my 11. The video is aesthetic af too.

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece, 11 contender

**bespectacIed** (10): Seriousy one of my 11 contenders in this rate, one my fave BG songs ever. Pure testosterone in song form. sehun and chanyeol's bridge blows me away

**celladonn** (10): She (this song) got me going crazyyyy

**DraculaWeekend** (10): That choreo during the chorus is iconic

**endcreditouilles** (10): If I could give a second 11 this would be it. EXO is dripping with talent, they never miss.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I always associate this with the mashup of this and Desiigner - Panda

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song is EXO-llent

**moonagenightmares** (10): a seismic cultural shift. The 1-2-3 punch of overdose mini then exodus album then ex’act album, best era to be a exo-l no its true its true

**nyoom** (10): good shit good shit. just an all around excellent performance: concept, composition, aesthetic, choreo, vocals, lyrics, all hits. SM, you've done it again. personally prefer the ldn noise creeper remix but the original is better, that one's just bouncier and more fun (listen through headphones for optimal effect). just like ldn noise's style i guess, they also did the arrangement for Lucky One and i like that one too

**plastichaxan** (10): this unlocked a deep memory i think it's probably the only song i heard in the rate before doing it

**PSSST12** (10): not giving this song an 11 is a crime in my book but that was just how it works with these rates. 😫 I remember dying when baekhyuns lip piercing popped on my screen and ascended when that drop in the chorus hits. Everything about this song is PERFECT. not a hair out of place. Even chanyeol whose rapping is mediocre most of the times served in this one. This song is widely hailed as one of exo's best songs and it deserved all the accolades it gets. Tbh this is objectively a better song than Growl, but Growl is just too iconic and laced with nostalgia for me to overlook it for this song.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): The all of EXO was too hot during this era, it's unbearable for my little gay heart.

**rickikardashian** (10): my score is actually for the part where they sing "I'm creeping in your heart babe". the rest of the song is ok ig

**SlphWsp** (10): One of the contenders for first place, an all time favourite, one of the best instrumentals in kpop, vocals rap choreo mv and styling is all just best of the best. That BRIDGE. The adlibs. The outro

**snugsnhugs** (10): honestly so good, exo never does wrong esp with dark concepts

**sssaaage** (10): didnt get the hype for this song for so long but it hit me while doing this

**suffocatedbears** (10): this was my first exo comeback and i remember being floored by the choreo, literal perfection

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): this was my third EXO song I think and I went fucking crazy for it. The energy is insane.

**Twohungryblackbirdss** (10): tell me Chen singing "I'm sorry you make me so crazy" in the bridge doesn't blow your balls off

**Heedictated** (9.9): SHE GOT ME GOING CRAZY

**Zypker125** (9.7): I used to be a 10 on this song, but I’ve slightly fallen out of love with it. The second verse definitely drags a bit and lowers the energy of the song (the first verse is also a little guilty of this), and the “You call me monster” parts of the chorus are also a bit too low-energy.

**cleopatroclus** (9.6): instrumentals and vocals yet again amazing

**agentofscranton** (9.5): sehun and chanyeol’s rap leading into that final chorus. it’s crack that’s what it is

**ebooks #5454** (9.5): if exo is really far from winning this rate im going to hurt myself

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): It's just so good. So much hype, incredible vocal prowess, great production. Also features EXO's best rapping, something they usually suck at.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): gabbie Hanna voice: “you can call me Monsteerrrrrrr”

**throwaway7650** (9.5): the instrumental hook working throughout the song... the producers were genius for this. deservedly one of EXO's most iconic songs

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Ah yes, the "classic SM music video where they finally have budget to pull a visually appealing music video because they felt like it" music video. Now this is what I expect from an SM music video especially coming from EXO. Definitely impressed.

**runaway3212** (9): Call Me Baby wants what this has

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Used to think that this was overrated (tbf I still do) but I appreciate this song much more now. The lyrics are….pretty much what you'd expect from a song with that title.

**TiltControls** (8.5): stream last night from jackbox party pack 5

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): CHORUS GOOD SMASH WE LOVE YOU EXO

**BoneStreetSand** (8): My least favourite EXO song in the rate, but probably the song with one of their best music videos. Stunning colour and visuals.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see this is closer to growl! Kinda! Not really. Not in the slightest. But they’re trying?

**dekubaku** (8): The best EXO title track.

**galaxy\_rae** (8): i feel very strongly about this video!! So good

**orbiteezus** (8): as someone relatively new to kpop, this was the first exo song i got into, and i was obsessed with it for a while. however, after listening to it for the first time in months, it's kinda grown off me. its still great but i feel the instrumental is a bit lacking and my enjoyment of it is carried more by vocals.

**universemates** (8): The chorus bangs. The verses, not as much.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): not a misandrist but men looking beat up & bloody? hot

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): the random strobes in the MV were so painful and unnecessary ugh

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's quite a lot, but it's definitely fun, especially the chorus

**elleyonce** (7): Chorus for the ages, but everything else is very standard EXO. Lucky One is the superior title track from EX'ACT.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.4): it's no Tempo and they're no Irene & Seulgi but this still slaps a bit

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Definitely one of my fave BG debuts along with SHINee’s Replay. It’s just so fun and explosive, I wish TXT stuck with this concept a bit more before starting to go down the darker route. I need more cute BG songs in my life :( I’m really glad this was able to secure a top 10 placement!!

**wavingwolves** (10): My second favourite group in the whole rate at this point in time and one of my favourite songs in the rate. I'm actually really happy they got to be this high in the list being, especially with this song which is actually one of my favourite debuts of all time. When TXT debuted they were such a breath of fresh air compared to the edginess of other groups, and even now when they do edgier concepts like [their latest comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8lMfE7kjes) (which is very good) it still feels more organic and unique in comparison with most 4th gen groups who do diet-EXO music and call it a day. This song deserves the circlejerk it has around it and I'm glad to see that most would agree with that.

# [Crown's choreo main chorus point]

**liberalitea** (11): this song makes me feel young again

**pat-rickstar** (11): I usually have something at least slightly interesting to comment on my 11s but idk what to say here, it's just a great song and gets better with every listen

**rickikardashian** (11): [they're more than my meow meows, they're my family](https://i.imgur.com/ml5Azif.jpg)

**rotating3Dtext** (11): they are so cute :( I really wanted to rate Blue Hour tho

**runaway3212** (11): This rate has turned me into a MOA so of course this gets my 11

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Just an immense bop

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i forget how i stumbled onto this when i listen to almost no kpop but whew a serve. the video is also very fun and aesthetic

**Zypker125** (11): I didn’t expect this song to be my 11, but after listening to all my 11 contenders again (Spring Day, Rhythm Ta, Beautiful, and this), I’m pretty confident in this 11. What I like about this song is that it tells a fairytale story through its lyrics, with the musicality matching up with the storyline throughout. Consequently, it excels not only cinematically but also theatrically, and truly has among the best lyrics in all of K-Pop. The song goes through a whirlwind of emotions, having an angsty yet hopeful feel in the verses, complemented by a euphoric chorus that radiates happiness. I’m happy to give Crown my 11.

**agentofscranton** (10): everybody better be streaming ghosting! one of the best k-pop b-sides ever!

**bigbigbee** (10): The best debut in years. The majority of boy groups went all dark and edgy and BORING somewhere around 2018 and I'm sick of it. Luckily, hidden amongst the awful dreck from then, there are a few hidden gems, like this one.

**celladonn** (10): Bright and youthful boy group songs don't get much better than this

**grey/0x976** (10): carrying 4th gen bgs #WELOVEYOUSOOBIN

**hikkaru** (10): BUT I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!

**hyphen-happy** (10): THE perfect summer song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): excellence

**nyoom** (10): would be my 11 if shangri-la weren't on. love the morse code-esque opening. love the BUMP-BUMP. love the "crown" point choreo. love that i'm a native korean speaker who majored in lit and yet couldn't tell you what this song is about.

**PSSST12** (10): One of the best debut songs in recent years. An 11 contender. The serotonin boost I get when I hear this song on a sunny day is unmatched.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we love a self prophecising song title in a rate

**Roxieloxie** (10): its a summer banger

**skargardin** (10): imagine having a debut THIS perfect, they SNAPPED

**SlphWsp** (10): Amazing, up there with Replay for best debut of all time, such a full sound, mindblowing choreo

**TiltControls** (10): also another song that's hard to describe other than just fun! also the MV itself really helps with that!

**weappreciatepowers** (10): I LOVE YOU SOOBIN AND TAEHYUN

**ebooks #5454** (9.7): CUTE CUTE CUTE

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): A bit off for weird vocal processing on an otherwise perfect song

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): The epitome of boy group debut songs. It's just pure fun, charisma and talent on display.

**jaskiwhere** (9.5): This is almost perfect except I really don't like the "like a crown on my head" part

**dekubaku** (9.1): Not their best but definitely a great debut.

**bluetriangles04** (9): The hype for TXT’s debut was super warranted, and Crown was a great start for their music career.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Omg TxT doesn't have to naturally be this cute wtf. 😭

**galaxy\_rae** (9): one of the best debut songs i've ever heard. They are constant with the quality of their songs.

**Heedictated** (9): great replay value

**hunnybee12** (9): legendary debut. too bad it got overshadowed by the furry song

**jasannn** (9): The best 4th gen bg right here everybody

**Leixander** (9): love the chorus but something somehow feels missing in the verses

**seanderlust** (9): if I am nice to this song can I payola the interlude to be angel haze's crown? :waiting:

**suffocatedbears** (9): king soobin

**PRADA** (8.7): also grew YASS

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute....a good song but i think its missing a little something

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I have a soft spot for cute boy group songs, and this is such a classic blend between cutesy 2nd gen, and modern trends. An icon!

**BoneStreetSand** (8.4): This was a huge surprise from me. I thought I hated this. Thanks for making me revisit it and proving me wrong!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): the best group signed to HYBE now that GFREUND have disbanded

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): A nice refreshing song. I get why people liked it so much.

**moonagenightmares** (8): i loved this on first listen but i like it less the more i listen to it, the skrrrt doesnt help

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): One of the better 4th gen debuts! Cute lil song especially considering they had big shoes to fill being BTS' kinda brother group.

**snugsnhugs** (8): this song is cute and feel-good, I dig it


# [Crown's start of choreo when they're on the floor with their heads down]


**throwaway7650** (8): a great debut but a bit overrated. the "skrt!" is super out of place and I find the chorus kind of... rushed? somehow

**bear\_horse\_stork** (7): lowkey same deal as Suju

**BebeLuigi** (7): I understand that it's their most popular track but I think they really flourished post this sfqsdfsdq It's a cute bop but some other singles would be easily a 10 from me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): after all the build up… consider me whelmed.

**fadedblue09** (7): Ehh they've done better stuff than this. Run Away for your 11s in the next BG rate!

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): I really like TXT but this is my least favorite title track by them

**sssaaage** (7): my favorite f slurs ate

**aestheticen** (6): Except it’s far away from getting the crown on my list

**bespectacIed** (6): this was a  fun moment

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this was kinda disappointing?

**lonelyglory** (5): Never a fan of this type of heavy vocal processing/multitracking and overly full mix on a lot of "Hitman" Bang PD tracks. Without them I think I'd legit really like this song.

**Sedona83** (4.5): Too bubblegum and Disney

**throwawayforshady** (3): Ugh I'm really not a fan...

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Probably their most iconic song and the one that always shows up in those “Iconic K-pop Songs Every K-pop Fan Must Know” videos on YouTube. Again, this is one of my favourite titles from them and it honestly just gives me such a serotonin boost.

**wavingwolves** (10): I'm so glad this was able to crack the top 10. It's one of my favourite SVT titles and probably their most iconic song and one of the most well liked ones too. The [choreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1gJQpMSkEU) for this in particular is amazing, if feels almost theatrical (and the [Pretty U choreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpHfh9VUOek) felt completely theatrical, this is a whole ass musical scene), which I really love and find incredibly charming. Sonically, this is just pure joy in song form and I would never understand why anyone would have negative feelings over this.

---

# AJU NICEEEEE!!!

**bookthieving** (11): i'm biased as hell but idc, this is the perfect upbeat funky bop! not to mention: the pastel horror mv! the groovy mj-influenced choreo! the suspenders! [them going insane during their encores!](https://twitter.com/chwhansol/status/1219160784275693568)

**lonelyglory** (11): I've seen this live twice and survived a neverending Aju Nice encore. The energy is unbeatable, the vocals are incredible, the sheer fun of the track jumps right out at you and pulls you in.

**PRADA** (11): BOP YASSSSSSSSSSSSS DINO AND CHINA LINE SERVE

**seanderlust** (11): i'm a simple man. I hear a fergalicious reference, I give it a ten. or higher :mischief:

**BebeLuigi** (10): this is the definition of bop

**bigbigbee** (10): me when i see three Gibles

**bluetriangles04** (10): This song is so infectious. One of the best outros in K-Pop tbh.

**bobaroma** (10): Dukun dukun whoa

**cherryices** (10): the MV is a daylight horror short masquerading as a pop video

**cremeebrulee** (10): this girl casted for part is really living out my dream role ..... (have an RBF while ~~17~~ 13 boys fawn over you)

**dekubaku** (10): Aju nice!

**endcreditouilles** (10): seventeen boys??? for one girl???? best of luck to her

**fadedblue09** (10): Oh god another potential 11 for me right here. This just makes me feel like walking on sunshine. No other boy group can capture the sound of innocent lovestruckness like Seventeen.

**hyphen-happy** (10): so overplayed it makes me wanna scream and yet still a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I listened to this whole song in a borat voice

**nctdreamsqd** (10): The standard for an energetic pop song

**plastichaxan** (10): fergie could teach a generation to spell but not to count in spanglish

**PSSST12** (10): Pop perfection. This is what exo thought what they were doing with call me baby. (Exo is my fave bg but I said what I said.)

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Another one of those "This has always been my favorite from them" tracks. All I'm saying is that if a guy approached me and confetti shot out of his chest like in the video I would be impressed.

**Shinkopeshon** (10): The ultimate serotonin boost, there's no song like it

**throwaway7650** (10): 11 worthy, my fave by them here. AJU NICE!

**weappreciatepowers** (10): SMASH ETC FUCK SAGE

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): the way creme and i were in a mall when we first heard this, using the snapchat shazam feature to figure out the title...anyways this song is so fun yeehaw

**Heedictated** (9.8): fun song lovely lyrics and a great sense of youthful energy and playful attitude that just makes you want to sing along and enjoy

**throwawayforshady** (9.8): AJU! NICE! WHOA! NICE!

**1998tweety** (9.5): BIG bop

**hasanella** (9.5): well my heart sure is doing flips

**jasannn** (9.5): Yes, indeed.

**nyoom** (9.5): props for being featured on like sports news clips sometimes and for always making me feel like i really did something

**Zypker125** (9.2): The fast-paced BPM and drums are super catchy/memorable. The song absolutely slaps and is fun to dance to. However, the bridge drags a lot (they’re clearly extending the song to make it a more standard length and to force in parts for the rest of the members, and it shows), being significantly lower-energy than the rest of the song.

**10footnotes** (9): Carat checking in! The lineup for this rate managed to avoid literally all of my favorite Seventeen title tracks (RIP lmao), but I do enjoy Aju Nice a lot. It’s so lighthearted and goofy that it took a little while to properly click for me, but once it finally did, I realized what a fun rollercoaster ride I’d been missing out on. It’s such a silly but effective little mood-booster of a song, and every member is putting in their absolute best and most high-energy effort. Yes, the chorus may be clown noises—but we love them for it.

**celladonn** (9): Impossible to deny a song this explosively energetic

**foxinthenoodles** (9): Energetic and incredibly engaging.

**grey/0x976** (9): DETONATE THE YASSPILLS

**HeartofDarkness123** (9): I’m a little tired of this song but that refrain never fails to hit and get me hype as fuck.

**hikkaru** (9): four tres two uno listen up y'all cuz this is it the beat that i'm banging is delicious

**ignitethephoenix** (9): why did the beginning remind me of fergalicious with the countdown 💀

**rickikardashian** (9): they wanna be Dongkiz so bad 🙄🙄

**runaway3212** (9): very nice indeed

**skargardin** (9): very nice indeed!!

**suffocatedbears** (9): love the campiness

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): oh this is sunny and fun

**bulforster** (8.6): Slightly lesser but still very strong Uptown Funk imitation.

**moonagenightmares** (8.6): went from thinking the chorus is annoying to thinking it’s the best part of the song

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): insert clown noises

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): idk if this girl exploding their confetti hearts is a good or bad thing

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i mean they tried to warn me (i’ve used this joke 3 times so far in the rate but listening to these songs reusing material isn’t that big of a deal)

**frogaranaman** (8): I’m beginning to think there aren’t 17 members

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): Excluding Gangnam Style this was probably the first Kpop song I ever heard

**TiltControls** (8): very nice dance moves. also it's a bop

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): this is so feel good

**BoneStreetSand** (7.8): Another lukewarm but kinda good song by this band. Hope the other two left are good.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): this is cute, they are cute

**sssaaage** (7.5): this was originally my 0 but with relistens i grew to like it .. tbh everything about it is great other than the drop which i still absolutely despise. svt have a recurring problem of drops ruining their songs #wehateyouwoozi

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It definitely stands out

**SlphWsp** (7): Love the verses and prechorus, the chorus not so much, fun mv and creative choreo as per usual

**bespectacIed** (6.9): nice

**Sedona83** (6): Has energy but dislike chorus

**hunnybee12** (5): the drop is... not for me.

**jaskiwhere** (5): (slightly) nice

**snugsnhugs** (4): its okay, it gets kind of annoying though

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): You know those songs that have such a nostalgic feeling to them you’re simultaneously brought to tears and feel a sense of euphoria? This is That Song ™ for me. If a certain song by a certain group wasn’t in this rate, this 100% would have gotten my 11. I’ve teared up to this song on the bus back home from school more times than I want to count, and even after all these years I find myself automatically turning up the volume as soon as this song comes on. I just love everything about this song so much - this is genuinely a perfect song to me and I wouldn’t change a single thing.

**wavingwolves** (10): And here it is, the highest BTS entry in the rate and the correct one. I do feel like this deserved a little higher than #6, though. This is my favourite BTS title and it has been since it was first released. I'm pretty sure this was the first comeback by them I was able to follow and if you weren't there, you missed it. It doesn't matter that they're topping american charts right now, this was peak BTS because their music was filled with yearning and earnestness in a way that it lacks now.

# Run? More like staying still so I can listen to BTS best song <3


**RandomHypnotica** (11): this MV feels like a high schoolers idea of what “bad boys” ate like and i love it

**2dina3dworld** (10): The Hwayangyeonghwa era was BTS's best era, and this was it's best title track

**aestheticen** (10): Kinda miss when they made music like this

**akanewasright** (10): yeah this is probably my favorite BTS song out of this bunch

**bluetriangles04** (10): Was a candidate for an 11 for me, a beautiful song that makes me miss their old sound even more.

**bobaroma** (10): Perfect.

**bookthieving** (10): yeah i'm an annoying hyyh stan how did you know

**endcreditouilles** (10): forever obsessed with this music video. BTS's visuals are some of my favorite of all time. Bring back the bad boy era!!!

**grey/0x976** (10): like actually one of the best songs ever. 2015 - 17 amazing years for bts its true not everyone can say they have the same acclaim im sorry i watched the mv this is AMAZING. The styling the cinematography the music the editing #SORRY this is literally a career highlight and a time in history for kpop as a whole. When you think about it its reasons like this why BTS' career skyrocketed, when you dissect the elemonation going on in this song and see the many layers of trickery and slay it truly is an amazing experience as a pop off queen fan. I love you park jimin

**hasanella** (10): maybe i imprinted on bts like a baby duck but this song means so much to me and i swear every time i hear the first notes i feel too many emotions

**pat-rickstar** (10): Love this, probably my favourite BTS song that I've heard

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): One of their best title tracks hands down

**PSSST12** (10): Their BEST lead single. Argue with the wall. That ethereal guitar riff during the intro makes this song for me. An 11 contender. All in all, I'm might say that "The best moment in life pt 2." Was BTS' peak artistic wise. That along with love yourself: her remains my fave project from them.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): THIS. IS. THEIR. BEST. SONG. They will simply never top this, it's just a fact. Literally everything about this song and era is just idk perfect like... fuck... I want this BTS back too. ~~Side note, I first watched the video for this song in a church, so that's fun.~~

**runaway3212** (10): Me when im run

**Sedona83** (10): BTS at their best

**skargardin** (10): clearly i've been sleeping on BTS' older stuff omg I'm obsessed!!

**sssaaage** (10): idk what to say about this its just good.. i ascend at the bridge every time

**suffocatedbears** (10): i am really a sucker for this era can we have more of this/i need u and less of whatever the hell butter is supposed to serve

**throwaway7650** (10): one of BTS' best title tracks period, deserves more streams

**Heedictated** (9.9): the pandemic made me appreciate this song even more it was just smooth overall with some of the best incorporation of rap

**cherryices** (9.8): their best single from their best album!

**gabcac** (9.8): one of my bts' fav

**PRADA** (9.7): MEGA BOP YASSSSSS

**Zypker125** (9.7): One of the best choruses in all of K-Pop. The angsty “Run, run, run” hits all the right emotions of the teenage era of self-discovery. Emotional dance-pop done right will always get high scores from me. Only complaint is that the bridge is a slog.

**1998tweety** (9.5): SMASHA

**hikkaru** (9.5): me when i'm running

**TiltControls** (9.5): me when i hold down the b button

**BoneStreetSand** (9.4): Can’t think of anything to say, but I love it and I want y’all to know.

**cremeebrulee** (9): the "bts was better before they blew up" circlejerk might have made some points

**HeartofDarkness123** (9): The dashi run run run refrain is veryyy catchy. Gets stuck in my head a LOT.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): excellence

**throwawayforshady** (9): Best BTS MV

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): holy shit this is peak BTS. Now I understand why there are so many army's that miss this era.

**ebooks #5454** (8.8): bring back the bad boy BTS era, run it back!!!

**celladonn** (8.5): I never paid as much attention to this as I have to other BTS singles but revisiting it now... you know what? It's good

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Some parts feel weak but the chorus just hits so hard. Also, kinda random but I love the quality of their MVs, they definitely feel like they're part of a storyline.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): baby cows are so sweet...cow hybrid jimin w the prettiest big eyes that tear up when his soft tits are milked and his voice pitching up high when someone reaches down to touch his cute little cock bc he doesn't deserve it but it takes the edge off

**seanderlust** (8.5): bonus points for the flower metaphor in the first verse. they could do the odyssey but could homer do this? I don't think so hunny.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): definitely a bop

**universemates** (8.5): I have a soft spot for rebellious youths concept. This song, NCT Dream's Go, and TXT's OX1=Lovesong, all bops with great MVs.

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): good song

**bulforster** (8.2): I want to love this but the chorus vocal needs slightly more impact to match the instrumental.

**BebeLuigi** (8): annoyingly catchy

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Me watching the Bagtan boys fight each other out of nowhere in the MV 😭

**elleyonce** (8): I hated this when it came out but now I get the appeal as it outdoes everything BTS is doing since 2017.

**galaxy\_rae** (8): this song fits bts so much. The feeling of youth. This is their best era besides love yourself!

**orbiteezus** (8): i love how dreamy the instrumental here is, i think the song suffers from some underwhelming verses but the rest of the song is so good

**SlphWsp** (8): Nice sound, don't love the rap but the rest is good, beautifully shot mv with great acting all round

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.9): im gay so something synthy is hard for me to dislike


# Run? More like running away from this song 

**jasannn** (7.8): Solid pop song as well but its missing something.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): running in circles? because you’re repeating yourself for like a minute

**foxinthenoodles** (7): Undeniably catchy chorus that carries the song.

**emmach17** (5): It's BTS so it's good but this is the worst of BTS

**snugsnhugs** (4): its fine

**cleopatroclus** (3.3): instrumentals cute at points ig but shame about the.. err, vocals

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): Truly a once-in-a-generation talent, I still haven’t found a Korean soloist that fills the same niche as Jonghyun. The Story Op 2 is one of my favourite albums of all time but all of his albums are great - I encourage you guys to check them out if you haven’t already! Wherever Jonghyun is now, I hope he’s doing well and knows how many people love and miss him.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): T alented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, etc. Jonghyun is probably my favourite soloist and one of the biggest reasons for that, besides the fact he has my favourite voice from any k-pop idol, is the way he's work is extremely versatile and all of it is good. I can't recommend his work enough. If you liked this at least a little, just go out there and stream one of his minis because you'll most definitely find something to love.

---

**bobaroma** (10): You did well, Jonghyun.

**Jhe116** (10): You did well

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): If I could give an 11 in this Bonus Rate, THIS would get it. Truly a once in a lifetime artist and such a perfect fucking solo discog. You guys better fucking love this song istfg!!!!! (But also if you do pls check out the rest of his discog I am BEGGING YOU, so many good songs in there it's crazy.)

**SlphWsp** (10): What a unique voice, how can he be so versatile in one song, such control, fun uplifting and super colourful, his voice always adds a bit of grit to a cheerful concept, a shot of happiness

**sssaaage** (10): the 2nd best song in the rate!! genuinely amazing but not surprising bc its jonghyun

**weappreciatepowers** (10): I FUCKING DIED AND WAS BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE CAUSE OF THIS.

**cleopatroclus** (9.1): amazing vocals and instrumental, would be a 10 if a bit less repetitive

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**aestheticen** (9): So true...

**agentofscranton** (9): one of the most talented people in the entire music industry period

**bespectacIed** (9): once in a generation talent

**jaskiwhere** (9): I always did like his sultry songs more than his funky songs but She is has always been the exception to this rule!

**akanewasright** (8.5): oh shiz

**foxinthenoodles** (8.5): A forward thinking song with so many details that make it interesting and worth listening to over and over again.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.4): I have nothing to say besides I miss him.

**BebeLuigi** (8): a bop

**elleyonce** (8): I love the album, but the title track has this stop-start energy to it I never really liked. [Jjong voice] Relationship.

**nyoom** (8): oh SHIZ, this kinda a groove

**snugsnhugs** (8): groovy and fun. Interesting musical elements. RIP Jonghyun <3

**throwaway7650** (8): oh shit! while I don't *love* this track, it's still rather good. anyway stream jonghyun's discography <3 SHINee LEGENDS [2]

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I feel so bad giving this anything less than a 10 because it’s Jonghyun, and I love Jonghyun, but this is not objectively good enough for anything higher than a 7.5. Shinin’, however, is a 10 and I implore that everyone checks it out.

**bigbigbee** (7): I really didn't like this when it came out but it grew on me during this rate! That's not an interesting sentence but it's true!

**fadedblue09** (7): Ahhh I wished I liked this more :/  He will forever be a king though

**gabcac** (7): i love jonghyun but i think this song is one of the weaker title track of his

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): A fun, cheerful song, but most certainly not in my top Jonghyun songs.

**rickikardashian** (7): this is his way around cursing

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): not my favorite from him but still cute!

**seanderlust** (6.5): no no no no no no no no no no babe no no no no no

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): Definitely saying "oh shit"

**moonagenightmares** (6.3): after awhile i started hearing oh shiz and could barely go on

**sarcasticsobs** (6.3): Love his voice, this beat isn’t really for me outside of the bass (bridge helped a bit)

**Sedona83** (3): Don't like, weird beat

**Zypker125** (3): This song just does not work at all for me. The transitions are poor and the song doesn’t flow well, the R&B and city-pop vibes are not for me, and the song as a whole is very unmemorable.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Is there anyone who thought this song wasn’t winning? It’s a predictable winner but a deserved one! When we first started receiving ballots UN Village and Blooming Day were actually top 2 and Move was #3 but by the time more ballots started coming in, Taemin was able to secure his lead by a very large margin. It’s one of those songs you can’t help but groove along to, and I’m glad it got the recognition it deserved in Korea with so many idols covering it.

**wavingwolves** (9.7): We didn't do graphs for the bonus songs, but I'll tell you now that for the first 2 weeks or so of the rate Un Village was winning, which was very disrespectful in my opinion because that song doesn't sound like a winning song. This does, so I can't be mad. This was actually such a cultural reset in Korea and we got so many good ~~and bad~~ dance covers of it. It's feels like the most Taeminesque thing and I'm glad it won.

---

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**2dina3dworld** (10): Taemin told us that we're gonna move, whether we like it or not

**akanewasright** (10): If this doesn’t win, I’m side eyeing this bonus rate.

**bespectacIed** (10): Just iconic idk what else to say. This is kinda the obvious bonus rate winner and I think view is locked on the main rate too so yeah SHINEE won this rate

**bobaroma** (10): What do you mean you never caught the move disease??

**bookthieving** (10): want deserves the clout that move has

**chenle** (10): you got got the rhythm

**cherryices** (10): Taemin is not the person he used to be. He is not going to help you but take advantage of you. His influence on you is not good. I cannot give you all the details here. What he says will always make you feel insecure and he's trying to draw you & others into homosexuality.

**dekubaku** (10): Iconic!

**gabcac** (10): this is what the stans of certain british boy think he is

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): This and Criminal are my favorite Taemin songs. It has aged like fine wine. The dirty bass and the breathiness of his vocals send me to the fucking moon. The beat is pulsating and hypnotizing. The dance is literally peerless. It’s just got incredible iconic and hoe energy in spades and those are my favorite songs. It’s probably the kpop song I’ve listened to the longest and the most without getting tired.

**Heedictated** (10): THE song that defines Taemin for me

**hyphen-happy** (10): my actual 11 tho

**jaskiwhere** (10): Was Not Ready, am Still Not Ready. Cultural reset.

**Jhe116** (10): This song dislocated so many hips

**lonelyglory** (10): A forever classic since the nanosecond it dropped.

**milkywayinradius** (10): so daark and sexxyy, taemin

**pat-rickstar** (10): This is an 11 contender for me if it was in the main rate, it deserves to win this bonus rate

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Lee Taemin turned me into a homosexual with this song.

**rickikardashian** (10): someone link the "taemin is not the same as before he's trying to turn you gay" tweet please

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I really love Taemin can you tell

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this song is so hot i’m sweating

**seanderlust** (10): such a sexy soundscape

**Shinkopeshon** (10): The most subtle explosion in the history of our sport

**SlphWsp** (10): Truly a legendary song, mv and choreo, gives me goosebumps just with audio, thank you Koharu Sugawara for a collab for the ages, no one can do it like Taemin

**sssaaage** (10): this song being actually so overrated but still a 10

**throwaway7650** (10): iconic. shocking that it got 0 music show wins, the impact this (and taemin in general) has on the industry is insane. SHINee LEGENDS

**throwawayforshady** (10): Why can't we give 11s to bonus songs?! I consider my day incomplete if I don't listen to Move at least once

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): how can I give any less to such an iconic song? It's very minimalistic but also so effective.

**weappreciatepowers** (10): i dont even have to explain myself. I really dont.

**celladonn** (9.5): He's so sexy and for what

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): Impossibly enticing. Taemin's masterclass in sensuality.

**hikkaru** (9.5): this will mop

**cleopatroclus** (9.2): iconic

**aestheticen** (9): [inserts comment about the choreography]

**bluetriangles04** (9): The Move hype in Korea during release was well warranted! What a banger!

**snugsnhugs** (9): soooooooo sexy. Taemin is everything

**taeneon** (9): kpop's ace

**BoneStreetSand** (8.4): Sexy and kinda fun, but also kinda underwhelming based on how much people hype up his solo stuff. Thought this would stop me in my tracks, but even though it didn’t, I still dig it.

**Zypker125** (8.1): The song is actually pretty catchy throughout, and the quiet vocals feel pronounced enough to work for me. The beat and vocals match the seductive tone of the song very well. The bridge is pretty weak, though.

**agentofscranton** (7.5): i never got the hype over this song I’M SORRY! Want >>>

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): not his best song imo

**fadedblue09** (6.5): His voice in the verses don't work out for me but the chorus is a serve

**BebeLuigi** (6): not one of his best songs sadly

**bigbigbee** (6): Taemin being in the army means that I'm absolved of feeling guilty for not really liking his solo stuff for a whole year!

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): Honestly I don’t like this song as much as other people do but I can’t deny no one’s doing it like Taemin

**nyoom** (3): i really hate when idols remind me they fuck

**Sedona83** (2.5): Song isn't doing it for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I fear this is by far the best song Bebe Rexha has ever been associated with. Although Lucifer’s sound may seem a little dated nowadays, it’s still a massive banger and it’s just so fun. The choreography for this song also revolutionised K-pop choreo into what it is now with an emphasis on synchronised and clean movements.

**wavingwolves** (10): HER WHISPER IS THE LUCIFER!!!!!! One of my favourite Shinee titles and the only song that Bebe Rexha was involved in that I actually like. This was peak "words ending in -ic being repeated" SM era and while I don't know what Loverhollic, Robotronic, Loverhollic, Robotronic is supposed to be I know it BANGS and that's more than enough. Still, this making it so far while other songs from the same era did SO poorly in comparison has to do with the way this is a SHINee song and SHINee as a group are pretty uncontroversial among kpoppies and non-fans alike, but of course, something has to go first and knowing the subs tastes it makes sense it would be Lucifer ~~even though this is the second best SHINee song in the rate~~.

---

**spacebunsailor** (11): literally the most iconic and classic first kpop song I ever heard

**2dina3dworld** (10): while you were studying the blade, I was studying the Lucifer dance

**agentofscranton** (10): the most satanic thing about it is their styling (as iconic as it is)

**bobaroma** (10): loverholic loverholic lovertronic lovertronic

**grey/0x976** (10): YASSSSSSSS

**jasannn** (10): This is so embarassing but I actually learned the tutting in 8th grade and i used to practice every so often at school. I was so bad. I just looked like I was flailing my arms.

**milkywayinradius** (10): is this whole rate a trap to reveal all the old millennial popheads? this song is classic even though it sounds dated, and now i'm officially the kpop equivalent to one of those dads that love classic rock..

**pat-rickstar** (10): I think this being my favourite SHINee song in the rate might be a hot take

**plastichaxan** (10): i love satanism what can i say

**PSSST12** (10): Now a STONE COLD CLSSSIC. I've over used that term for a while now in this rate but this song is truly a classic. The outfits, the choreo, the song, Key's hair. . They don't make legendary hits like these anymore. An 11 contender

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): For my first few months of being a Shawol, I got Minho and Key confused in the video for this and went "WHAT DID THEY DO TO MY BOY" because I was like why would they cut Key's hair so short... Then I realized I was wrong... Then I found out Dazzling Girl exist, that was not a fun time.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i’m electropop trash. also taemin’s haircut pls

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): *applies lip gloss* SLAAAYYYYY! SHINee may be my fave discovery of the rate

**sarcasticsobs** (10): head empty, only taemin’s shirt from the dance practice remains

**Shinkopeshon** (10): LOVERHOLIC ROBOTRONIC LOVERHOLIC JUST ICONIC

**SlphWsp** (10): One of the first kpop mvs I ever saw, what can I say, it still hits. Iconic song and choreo, powerful vocals, insane dancing, they really set the bar, even better live. I miss eyeliner and crazy hair

**snugsnhugs** (10): ICONIQUE. Changed dancing in kpop forever. Fantastic elastic. Taemin’s hair. Key’s hair. What else is there to say, this song IS that bitch

**specialtrickholdA** (10): GOD this song is so much fun to shout along to.

**sssaaage** (10): iconic smash amazing etc

**taeneon** (10): ngl my attention was waning but shinee has come and saved the day

**throwaway7650** (10): HER WHISPER IS THE LUCIFER! call me soobin because I'm a massive bebe stan for this song, it's so catchy and the chorus... WHEW

**Twohungryblackbirdss** (10): kneel before your kpop kings

**weappreciatepowers** (10): bop

**cherryices** (9.9): taemin dressed in black while the others are in white… foreshadowing his future devilishness

**BoneStreetSand** (9.7): My childhood in one video. I will bite anyone who disrespects this song.

**bulforster** (9.5): The one song in this rate I think pulls off being mostly shouting while still having some dynamic contrast.

**jaskiwhere** (9.5): Remember when they used this song in Lucifer the show omg

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): idk what LOVERHOLIC ROBOTRONIC means but it sure is a catchy hook

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this is the only good thing bebe rexha has contributed to society other than that one iconic live

**10footnotes** (9): The best kind of dumb, which is to say self-aware and so packed with hooks and energy that you never get the chance to slow down and question how silly it all is.


**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Among all of the SM boy groups, I think SHINee is the one that has been my favorite and this music video is the reason why.

**fadedblue09** (9): "Loverholic" and "robotronic" were added to the English Dictionary after this was released

**galaxy\_rae** (9): for legacy!

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): I’m not even a big fan of SHINee but their songs are laced with something I swear to god I can’t explain it

**PRADA** (9): bop yasssssssssss

**skargardin** (9): i need to listen to more early shinee i think!!

**dekubaku** (8.8): Iconic! Plus, this song with Tom Ellis fighting as Lucifer was simply mind-blowing!

**Heedictated** (8.8): MUST WATCH WITH DANCE

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): I hope this wins so that we can say that joe biden is indirectly responsible for this rate win

**nctdreamsqd** (8.5): Hearing the fan chant for this song live is life changing

**nyoom** (8.5): i embarrassed myself doing this at karaoke once. with coworkers. without conviction.

**Zypker125** (8.2): The choreo definitely enhances the song, and I enjoy the crazy vocal runs throughout the song. However, the group-sung choruses take up too much of the song (I prefer it when the vocals/parts are diversified throughout the song), and the lack of individual lines gives the song less flavor. Minho’s rap bridge was also just not good.

**BebeLuigi** (8): Invented modern kpop

**bespectacIed** (8): Everything about this is a time capsule lol. The hair, the fashion, the sound. Wanted Replay instead of Lucifer

**celladonn** (8): Incredibly iconic but I really have to be in the right mood to listen to it

**foxinthenoodles** (8): A talent showcase disguised as a dance bop.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): iconic

**liberalitea** (7.8): i just wanna add that Key is literally who half the people on this sub think they are

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): LOVERHOLIC ROBOTRONIC

**hasanella** (7.5): i really like shinee and this is not my favorite but it is iconic

**HeartofDarkness123** (7.5): Chaotic song. Not really my taste, I think, but it still fucking slaps.

**seanderlust** (7.5): LOVERHOLIC ROBOTRONIC

**TiltControls** (7.5): there are neat parts!!

**useless-sheep** (7.5): the hold nonexistent adjectives ending in -ic had over SM in 2010

**CrimsonROSET** (7): yes i googled to check if this came out before or after the pentatonix daft punk video

**ebooks #5454** (7): bro 2010 boy band kpop was a different time

**suffocatedbears** (6.5): was probably cute in 2010, but not so much now

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): For a song called Lucifer this isn't really as scary or loud as you'd expect

**hunnybee12** (6): a little too 2010 for me to stomach

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): I'm sorry but I'm really not a fan of early SHINee. At least it isn't Ring Ding Dong.

**Sedona83** (5.5): Middle of the road song

**frogaranaman** (3): I’M SORRY BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY JUST CALLED ME AN F SLUR IN SPANISH??


# Bebe Rexha section

**aestheticen** (10): I'm feeling real loverholic and robotronic tonight. The genius Bebe Rexha had in 2009

**akanewasright** (10): This is the one and only time I will ever give Bebe Rexha anything even close to an 11.

**DaBigBoi** (10): Washed the demo, insert Bebe yelling “slay SLAAAY”

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Bebe Rehxa’s greatest work

**bluetriangles04** (9): Bebe Rexha knew exactly what she was doing.

**1998tweety** (8.5): we love Bebe Rexha

**hikkaru** (7.5): bebe writing a song for txt when :soobcry:

**letsallpoo** (4): bebe rexha kpop queen

wavingwolves: #  I really love this comment 

**bigbigbee** (11): In the fall of 2010, I had just come back to school from summer break. I have a friend from South Korea, and I have a distinct memory of her patiently listening to me rattle on about how I'd found this fun little band that sang Loverholic Robotronic as we walked down the road to pick up our books for the year. I remember her patiently explaining that yeah, she did in fact know about SHINee. I remember playing the song out loud, singing along, and getting embarrassed when I accidentally sang part of the chorus in Korean. I remember her very kindly lying to me and saying "no, that sounded right!" I remember googling "SHINee Jonghyun" and scrolling through pages and pages because I just thought this guy was the neatest, and don't other people want to hear about him, he's such a good singer, and he seems really funny and nice, and he has a sister? I remember watching Hello Baby in the library and only being mildly embarrassed if people caught me doing it. I remember meeting someone new when I was on study abroad the next summer and bonding over the fact that she knew the WHOLE Lucifer dance (how cool!) As embarrassing as it is, being a fan of k-pop shaped a big part of my high school experience, and SHINee were a huge part of that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Easily one of the greatest K-pop songs of all time. I’ve heard this song so many times but whenever that key change hits in the final chorus I still get goosebumps. I’m disappointed this isn’t higher.

**wavingwolves** (10): In my honest opinion, this is the winner of the rate. It's one of the best k-pop songs of all time and one of the most epic experiences I've ever encountered when it comes to music. Produced by legendary k-pop music producing team Sweetune, this song is a blasting rush of sound that always leaves me so amazed at how it's able to come together with so many different little elements. It's a song that I genuinely feel that never gets old and every time I hear it I'm still able to find little details that I hadn't paid attention to before, which is my favourite thing. The Chaser feels like a climax upon a climax, it goes higher and higher and in seemly never stopping fashion and once it hits the key-change it's like ascending to a different plane of existence. There's no songs that feel this cathartic and have this level of magnitude in this list. An actual masterpiece.

---

# People who SPILLED!!!


**ElizabethDDoS** (11): I can't believe they named a British quiz show after this song.

**Leixander** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it,

**snugsnhugs** (11): literally the quintessential kpop song of our times. funky intro riffs? check. catchy chorus with HORNS and layered VOCALS? check. rap breakdowns? check. key change? check. amazing dance? this song has everything that makes kpop so fun and interesting!!!! 11s across the board!!!

**sunflowers127** (11): - The perfect kpop song. seriously best song of all time.

**throwawayforshady** (11): There is no greater Kpop song. There is no greater song.

**TiltControls** (11): did not know this before the rate, but it's too fun not to 11. I don't know what that thingy in the backing instrumentation is during the verses but I love it

**Twohungryblackbirdss** (11): This song is the pinnacle of human achievement and if it isn't ranked at the top I'll walk into the Han river

**1998tweety** (10): pop masterpiece

**2dina3dworld** (10): Sweettune made some of the biggest bops of the early 2010s, and this includes the Chaser, which is the best example of their work.

**agentofscranton** (10): i mean there’s a reason billboard chose it as the greatest k-pop song of the 10s. just look at the material!

**akanewasright** (10): I used to have a comment here making fun of the hosts for stanning this song too hard at a listening party. Unfortunately it seems they were right and I can’t make fun of them.

**bespectacIed** (10): This one's for the kpop hags. Infinite is a 2nd gen boy group that makes 2nd gen girl group type of bops. 11 worthy

**bobaroma** (10): Infinite is God and no one can deny it.

**bookthieving** (10): simply the greatest kpop song ever

**bulforster** (10): This song does not let you breathe for a second and I love it.

**celladonn** (10): The song I probably should be giving my 11 to. I recommend this breakdown by TheBiasList, who placed this song at number 1 on his 100 best kpop songs of all time list https://thebiaslist.com/2020/07/31/the-100-best-k-pop-songs-of-all-time-number-1/

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): they lived they served c*nt i died

**DaBigBoi** (10): One of the most legendary K-pop songs for a reason

**fadedblue09** (10): Not to be overdramatic but the best song made by men...EVER? It’s everything you want in a boygroup song: upbeat yet emotional, the vocal harmonies, the key changes, and storyline-driven lyrics. Definitely a cult classic worth the hype. If I wasn’t stanning some other groups here, this would be an easy 11.

**foxinthenoodles** (10): Fun to listen to, has a lot of levels and is very satisfying. It doesn't miss a beat in any way, and is engaging throughout the entire runtime. Pristine and perfectly executed.

**gabcac** (10): could easily be an eleven

**grey/0x976** (10): YASSS DOWN potential rate winner btw :thots:

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): I see why people think it’s one of the best kpop songs ever and I definitely enjoy it. It’s both epic and atmospheric.

**hikkaru** (10): SLAY

**jaskiwhere** (10): I almost knocked it down half a point because the intro was so long but I love this song too much to do it dirty like that

**PSSST12** (10): The chaser sweetie, I AM SO SORRY because I just know this song is gonna be ROBBED robbed 😫😭 Not giving this an 11 makes my skin burn. Infinite's best song and one of the greatest kpop songs of all time according to billboard. That opening synths takes me to another galaxy and lifetime, and that little rap segments in between the verses after the chorus was *chef's kiss* This song is so unique and I wish they had more song in this style.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): INVENTED MUSIC. When people say this is one of the most iconic K-Pop songs, they don't lie. I actually got into Infinite due to Toheart (that was a subunit of Woohyun and Key from SHINee) and this stuck out to me IMMEDIATELY alongside 'Be Mine'. This is like a top 10 sing-along K-Pop song for me because I go nuts during that chorus. Also the KEY CHANGE the fucking KEY CHANGE. This is literally one of the most perfect K-Pop songs to exist. I have probably said that quite a bit by now but this is genuinely such a full fucking package of a song. Like it doesn't overstay its welcome, every part hits, just UGH. I genuinely can do nothing but praise this song.

**runaway3212** (10): This is amazing

**sarcasticsobs** (10): the BASS my GOD

**Shinkopeshon** (10): Inarguably the greatest song in the history of the universe but I love SHINee and View too much to not give them the 11 lol

**skargardin** (10): omg what a SMASH

**specialtrickholdA** (10): Not hard to see why this is seen as the greatest k-pop song ever. That chorus is goosebump-inducing.

**sssaaage** (10): how can someone not like this song

**suffocatedbears** (10): epitome of kpop the other groups just don't compare

**taeneon** (10): YES THIS RIGHT HERE. THIS IS WHAT KPOP SHOULD BE. ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.

**throwaway7650** (10): a classic, what can I say. deserving winner if it does

**Zypker125** (9.9): This is the current frontrunner for the #1 spot (probably will compete with Spring Day and The 7th Sense), and I can see why. The key change in the last chorus is absolutely legendary, probably the best key change in all of K-Pop, and Woohyun’s vocals were the cherry on top. I do feel like I’m waiting for the key change whenever I listen to the song, though, so I can’t give it a full 10.

**Heedictated** (9.7): iconic bop

**aestheticen** (9): The genius in this song

**RandomHypnotica** (9): oh that key change was not it

**rotating3Dtext** (9): wtf this is good

**seanderlust** (9): the synths, the drums, the energy, the high drama, the strings. all of it works so well

**SlphWsp** (9): Iconic for a reason, must be sweetune? Such a great instrumental, makes me miss 9muses Kara Rainbow

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): the key change.......

**useless-sheep** (9): yass

**weappreciatepowers** (9): IT'S GOOD WE LOVE YOU WOOLIM PRODUCERS

**chenle** (8.8): be mine is superior

**PRADA** (8.4): OVERRATED wtf everyone is hyping it like there aren’t better songs in the rate

**BebeLuigi** (8): ok this is a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the chorus explodes so early its like the guys singing are caught off guard but then just go with it? I like the song this becomes by the last chorus more than the song we started out with

**BoneStreetSand** (7.9): Yeah pretty good. Probably would’ve liked this in 2012 so I’ll give it a decent score.

wavingwolves: 

# People I'm disappointed in 

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I know this is a fan fave but it’s just okay. Some of the production choices i side eye

**bluetriangles04** (7): I feel like this song barely misses the mark for me. You have me on board with the intro, the first verse, but then the chorus is pretty average for me and doesn’t continue the build-up of the song until the rap in the second verse and then it feels like we’re going straight into the chorus AGAIN. I will say tho, the bridge chorus and ad libs are great.

**nyoom** (7): it's no man in love or nothing's over or last romeo, AND sungyeol looks bad in this mv, but it's infinite quality

**spacebunsailor** (7): noisy

**elleyonce** (6): It's obnoxiously loud in the chorus. I am very lucky to be stanning Infinite since Be Mine but I can't listen to this more than once honestly. (Choreography actual godtier though)

**moonagenightmares** (6): sure the opening is iconic but the rest of the song is so bland, never got the hype

**cleopatroclus** (5.5): sorry this is just really underwhelming

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): I'm sorry but this was confusing

**cremeebrulee** (5): at least theyre pretty to look at

**frogaranaman** (5): are these twinks singing about being into gay bears

**milkywayinradius** (5): bahaha, this song feels so dated. giving me dance dance revolution song vibes or maybe a gundam anime opening song.

**Sedona83** (3.5): Forgettable but like main vocalist

**galaxy\_rae** (3): a producer saw a super junior mv from like 2011 and was like “oh okay ill recreate that”

**ebooks #5454** (2): they're really going hard on this and for what, to fall asleep

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): There are so many songs in this rate that I really love with every ounce of my being, but my 11 for this song has always been clear from the start. The song itself is of course amazing and the MV is my favourite EXO MV too (even though I know it’s very low budget and people were disappointed after the Pathcode teasers, but I’ll always take simple, choreo-focused music videos over expensive sets that make no coherent sense when put together...looking at you YG), but ultimately it’s the song that really made me a full blown K-pop stan and introduced me to one of my favourite groups, with my favourite discography in all of K-pop. Not to mention it’s the song that got my brother into K-pop too (who I also made do this rate even though he’s way more of a GG stan, sorry bestie) so I have some sentimental attachment to it as well. It just makes me really happy and reminds me of when I was first getting into K-pop and was having so much fun discovering all the amazing groups and songs out there <3 Okay, that’s my government-mandated cheesy 11 comment done now!

**wavingwolves** (10): My actual favourite EXO title and one of my favourite k-pop songs of all time. I love the structure of this song and, not to sound like a delusional [SM stan](https://twitter.com/fauxwol/status/1405240940093227009), the bridge is actually heavenly. One of my favourite things about EXO vocalists is their capability to come together as singers for some of the main climaxes of their songs and this song in particular showcases that in a really great way. I'm actually pretty glad this was the EXO song that was able to get this high and I can't say it's really undeserving. Also, early happy birthday to my co-host <3 My present is never rigging this out of top 3. <3 Jk I would never.

---

**cleopatroclus** (11): if you listen closely you can hear the sound of the best song in kpop. If you’re struggling to recognise this I recommend turning the volume up till it damages your hearing irreparably, you clearly weren’t using it anyway

**1998tweety** (10): pop perfect, the original title of Call Me Daddy sends me

**2dina3dworld** (10): it’s a good song, but it’s not the original demo version “Call me Daddy”, and that is a shame

**agentofscranton** (10): kyungsoo has the most gorgeous voice of any man in k-pop and it’s not even close

**BebeLuigi** (10): one of their best singles imo!!!

**bookthieving** (10): titling this album exodus after kris and luhan left is the funniest thing sm has ever done

**cherryices** (10): every single second of this song is a hook

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok say less

**DraculaWeekend** (10): An 11 contender, I looooove this song and MV, so much fun

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I liked their leather in the MV.

**elleyonce** (10): Every part of the song is insane. The rollercoaster never ends on this song. The chorus is especially sick, especially the adlibs. YOU KNOW MY NAME GIRL!!!!!!

**grey/0x976** (10): men with sexy faces always want u to do shit for them .. Bitch 1st of all make a list so i wont forget nothin

**hasanella** (10): everything about this is wonderful and i do not know how to express the joy this song brings me

**hunnybee12** (10): call me daddy would have been an 11

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song is EXO-llent

**orbiteezus** (10): i'm not sure what i can say about this, it's just perfect. d.o. and chen have some of their best vocals on this song

**skargardin** (10): but wow what a serve

**SlphWsp** (10): Those harmonies, they keep giving me Baek, Chen and DO in a row and I can't deal with it, it's just too good

**snugsnhugs** (10): timeless bop, the dance break is everything, NEVER DONT MIND ABOUT A THING

**suffocatedbears** (10): BOP

**TiltControls** (10): hey baby girl. anyways this is another potential 11

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): the 10 was placed the moment Kyungsoo said BABY GIRL

**Zypker125** (10): Super catchy and flowy throughout. You can pretty much use any concept for this song, from sexy to fun, and the song’s versatility makes it great. The “girl you’re the one I want” vocal harmony is unparalleled.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Remember when EXO had Chinese people in it? What a story, Mark!

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Only reason it's not a 10 cuz there's a superior version of this formula (shout out to Love Me Right!)

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): My first EXO comeback! Ugh this brings me right back to 2015. Tho once more I do find the repackage title track ('Love Me Right' aka an 11) to be better than this. Butttttttttttt this still goes hard. Highly suggest checking out 'El Dorado' and 'Exodus' from the album this is on, two of my favorite K-Pop b-sides of all time. (Also I know no one is super curious but my first 2 EXO biases were Sehun and Lay... I am now a Kai guy.)

**throwaway7650** (9.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88jbiCVFLC0

**endcreditouilles** (9.4): wait i thought you guys wanted us to call you monster i'm getting mixed signals

**ignitethephoenix** (9.3): this is great but I have to dock points for the weird voice saying “baby” at points

**PRADA** (9.2): YASSSSSSSSS MEGA BOP

**bespectacIed** (9): only real ones change the lyrics to the original "call me daddy" lol. P.S. jongin is a godtier man and the top 1 hottest korean man ever no one comes close

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): it's no Tempo but that production is so punchy and these hoes can HARMONIZE

**ebooks #5454** (9): i should've stanned them back in the day idk why i didn't i am now on an EXO agenda

**galaxy\_rae** (9): but i love the video too!!

**jasannn** (9): I used to dislike this song b/c i didn't know what the chorus was. I still don't know what's supposed to be the chorus but now I realize it doesn't matter.

**sssaaage** (9): great song but very overrated its true

**throwawayforshady** (9): I prefer Love me Right by a tiny bit but still <33

**Heedictated** (8.7): that vocal bridge is everything with baek starting and kyungsoo ending but personally im still waiting for the call me daddy version also one of the less interesting mvs exo had

**BoneStreetSand** (8.5): SBS Pop Asia once played this song three times in an hour, but I didn’t mind. Could’ve played it a fourth time and I would’ve still enjoyed it. All the boys are great, but I can’t take my eyes off Kai here. He’s so talented.

**Sedona83** (8.5): Catchy, fun, great vocals

**bluetriangles04** (8): Shawty imma party till the sundown!

**foxinthenoodles** (8): EXO slapping us with their vocal talent. So many things could've thrown this song offbalance, but they kept it together.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): I’m gonna have the chorus stuck in my head all day I already know it

**PSSST12** (8): Ok let me rant a bit, All that Bomb ass aesthetic path code teasers just to be served with this song was my villain origin story. BECAUSE WHAT WAS THE REASON?! I remember absolutely hating this song back in 2015 because I thought it was quite a mess but D.O's high note and that bridge made me see the light eventually. That said, they made this same exact sound without any kind of flaws with "Gravity".

**seanderlust** (8): "you drain into my dry lips" sis put on some chapstick

**10footnotes** (7): It’s fun! It’s like 80% Growl! It’s still fun! Knowing that the demo title was “Call Me Daddy” has permanently ruined it for me just the tiniest bit!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it was going fine but the late part in the song where just random sound bites get thrown in just… what

**dekubaku** (7): SM Visuals are no joke.

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): EXO’s bridges always blow me away and it’s pretty catchy. What in the sweet FUCK is that autotuned “bAyBeE” though??? Instantly down a point for that.

**nyoom** (7): not their best but still exo quality

**runaway3212** (7): overhyped but not bad

**weappreciatepowers** (7): good song nothing insane tho i fear SORRY GUCCI.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): hey baby girl

**useless-sheep** (6.5): this once came on when i asked alexa to play call me maybe #JUMPSCARE

**bulforster** (6.4): Could use some more tunefulness, the production especially just feels like a regualar series of punches with no conviction behind them.

**jaskiwhere** (6): Chenbaeksoo make this song work but, again, EXO continues to dance in a box and whatever that break is in the middle of the song ruins the flow of the song for me.

**moonagenightmares** (5): I might have a bit of an irrational hatred for this song but you can imagine my disappointment when this was my first comeback as a kpoppie and after so many cool teasers and theories made based on them all we got was... a white background mv with a song with sheep noises in the rap part. The reason im not giving this an even lower score is because rate host is holding a gun to my head as i type this (jk its her bday gift ❤️)

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): That intro is just so iconic!! This is definitely one of my favourite SHINee titles and I’m not surprised it has such a large amount of fans on here. Sherlock is actually made up of two separate songs (Clue and Note) spliced together and I still find it funny how SM tried to recreate the iconicness of that with SuperM’s One (Monster & Infinity). Fun fact: this choreography was done by Tony Testa, the same guy that’s choreographed for Janet and Michael Jackson, and Kylie Minogue. He did the choreo for NCT 127’s Cherry Bomb too, also in this rate. Sherlock was actually the most expensive choreography SM ever paid for although I think it’s been unseated now.

**wavingwolves** (10): The best SHINee song in the rate one of their top 3 titles. The whispered "SHINee's back" is one of the most iconic and memorable k-pop moments. All the production choices in this, the harmonies, the vocal melodies, the intro/outro... this sounds like a winner to me. But it's not, so it places here... because of a single person who changed their Sherlock score to a 10 after they sent their ballot in and that changed it all. This and Call Me Baby switched places in the last minute.

---

# Sherlock, but from Elementary, the better show

**akanewasright** (11): *GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP* FOOOOOOOOOOR SHINEEEEEEEEE

**bobaroma** (11): epicness in a song

**cherryices** (11): this is the definition of kpop to me. maximalism! performance! amalgamation! visuals!

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this chorus is just so euphoric, curious kings!

**Jhe116** (11): Exactly Sher11ock, two top tier songs merged into one top top tier song, who’s doing it like them

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (11): Almost 7 fucking years... And this is the song that started my journey into becoming a Shawol. I'll save you from the long story of how exactly I found the song but just know a dumbass who liked a show called 'Sherlock' (Keyword here: 'Liked', not anymore lol) stumbled upon a Buzzfeed article, wondered if this would be about the show and clicked play. And oh boy did it change me. From getting me to ask for my first K-Pop album that next spring for my Birthday to trying to learn to choreography to this to listening to their whole discog to literally just in March getting in my copy of Don't Call Me... I cannot thank SHINee enough for having this song. It opened so many doors for me and I've met so many cool people and had so many cool experiences and god how could I not give this my 11. I mean View is from my favorite album of theirs, Odd, but like this one just brings me back every damn time. This like an essay and a half now but like... there's so many spots where it's just like, where the fuck would I be if I didn't press play that day. So, yeah, thank you SHINee, thank you fellow Shawols. Stan SHINee, stream Odd. Goodnight America, stay curious.

**SlphWsp** (11): SHINee's Back! The one, the only, this is kpop. A masterpiece, completely euphoric, also incredible live. The vocals, the rap, the choreo, the charisma, it's all there. They are always so ahead of their time, this song is a high I can't come down from

**2dina3dworld** (10): but can Sherlock decipher what “dibidibidis”, from Shinee’s 2008 song “Shinee World” means?

**aestheticen** (10): This is such a well-structured song, the build-up from the start to the chorus is just chef’s kiss

**agentofscranton** (10): shinee could do hey jude but the beatles could never do sherlock

**bespectacIed** (10): What carried the weight of the 2nd gen kpop industry? Shinee's back

**celladonn** (10): Ummmm it's a bit of a masterpiece!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is art mawma

**cremeebrulee** (10): should be the best performing shinee song tbh

**DraculaWeekend** (10): That chorus hits so hard

**foxinthenoodles** (10): A song that is way ahead of its time and aged gracefully and shows off SHINee's overwhelming talent level.

**grey/0x976** (10): OKAY WERQ DOWN BOOTS TAEMIN

**hikkaru** (10): I'M SO CURIOUS YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

**hyphen-happy** (10): one of the songs that got me into kpop

**jasannn** (10): What about their back?

**jaskiwhere** (10): oH IM CURIOUS WHOAAA

**milkywayinradius** (10): wow, the chorus sounds so big vocally, i can't help but feel pumped, plus i'll always think of Sherlock with glass shattering sounds

**moonagenightmares** (10): I’M SO CURIOUS YEAHHHH

**plastichaxan** (10): this is what the bbc think their show looks like but it’s not

**PRADA** (10): another bop yasssssssss

**PSSST12** (10): tied with lucifer as their best song. Mashing up two separate songs to form one song? Paved the way for SNSD's IGAB. Everything is perfection from the choreo to the outfits. Hobo Taemin was iconic. An 11.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): me when SHINee’s back

**skargardin** (10): GIVE IT UP FOR SHINEEEEEE SO TRUE

**snugsnhugs** (10): SHINEE'S BACK BACK BACK BACK!!!! Seriously how can i give this less than a 10? The intro beat tells you you’re in for a treat. Then you get the amazing dance. And then that CHORUS OH IM CURIOUS YEAH!

**sssaaage** (10): shinee sweeties im so sorry that superm did the same idea but 10 times worse

**suffocatedbears** (10): the choreo itself deserves the 10

**taeneon** (10): god they're so talented and their discography is so good. kpop is nothing without them

**throwaway7650** (10): this song is just genius (note >>> clue)

**throwawayforshady** (10): If it wasn't for The Chaser, would be my 11

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): SHINEE'S BACK. Iconic. this is so good, and even better live.

**universemates** (10): If I have to, I would choose this one as Shinee's representative song. Everything about it is iconic. The whisper "Shinee is back" in the beginning. The choreography. The fact that the mashup was so well done I didn't even know it was a mashup of 2 songs when it first came out.

**useless-sheep** (10): #WELOVEYOUJESSICAJUNG

**weappreciatepowers** (10): bop

**Heedictated** (9.9): always want to dance when the song comes on

**BoneStreetSand** (9.7): I was glued to my tv waiting for this to play every time I watched SBS Pop Asia.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I'll be slightly annoyed if this wins because a SHINee win is so predictable it hurts, but i also won't be mad because it bangs

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): this taemin haircut may be even more iconic

**1998tweety** (9): bop, outsold the SuperM duo

**bigbigbee** (9): Jonghyun's never looked or sounded better. RIP King.

**nyoom** (9): yall remember when this song pitted the bbc sherlock fandom against the kpop fans on tumblr? priceless.

**bluetriangles04** (8): Legend says dorito consumption rose to an all time high after this song’s release.

**ebooks #5454** (8): im a whore for mystery themed shit

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Fuck Moffat and Gatiss tbh.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this had got a really cool and unique sound, it’s kinda video gamey but more contemporary?


# Not curious enough 

**specialtrickholdA** (8): Not gonna lie I wish Good Evening was in the rate over this, but this is one of their most iconic songs so I understand why it’s here. “SHINEE’S BACK” is iconic though.

**hasanella** (7.5): shinee is back and in the house yay

**Sedona83** (7.5): Enjoyable, nice vocals

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i love a good pottery smash

**emmach17** (7): I will not give it up for SHINee

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I think the whole mashup aspect is awesome at first glance, but that novelty wears off quickly. Also, neither of the two songs appeal to me individually so I just don't find the whole song interesting.

**Zypker125** (6.5): With Sherlock, I’m just waiting for the chorus, as the verses are weak and don’t do anything for me (and thus I listen to Note instead, as it gets to the choruses faster). Minho’s rap bridge is absolutely terrible and brings down what was a decent song.

**TiltControls** (6): love the mv! not sure about the song though

**HeartofDarkness123** (5): The chorus is almost epic enough to make me think I like it, but I don’t. It’s just… meh. The SHINee’s back! and the outro always gets me INCREDIBLY hype though. I do like it as a representative SHINee anthem, but I always skip it.

**wavingwolves** (7): I can understand how ODD era is so loved because, well, it was amazing and one of the best eras for performances, looks and music. It's a lot of people's favourite SHINee project, mine included, and it's regarded as one of the best k-pop projects. While all of this is true, this song compared to a lot that's in the rate doesn't feel that up to par. I don't hate it now and I used to like it a lot upon release till the start of the year when I went through a major SHINee binge, but as you listen to it the magic does wears out, or that was what happened to me, at least.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): Sigh...it was always obvious this song was winning. I mean, look at the amount of 11s, the other songs never had a chance! It’s a shame that this is the worst SHINee song in the rate to me, I like it fine but it just doesn’t do much for me ~~4 Walls outsold~~. But it does grow on me with every listen so who knows what my score might be in Winners Rate...

---

# Seeing

**10footnotes** (11): What a timeless and iconic song: I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of it.

**1998tweety** (11): SM makes the best music in kpop and you can't convince me othewise. This is litchrally pop perfection whew that chorus.

**bespectacIed** (11): We can complain all we want that this rate has the most predictable end but there's really no question what the winner is: the house track from an SM group lmao. View is the peak of k-pop boy group releases. 2015 was such a historic year..... SM making their 5-member boy group and 5-member girl group release a LDN Noise-produced, UK deep house song 5 months apart, and those two songs becoming two of the greatest kpop songs of all time. Also minho on that tank top lord help me

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): how could i give the brother to the legendary 4 Walls any other score? it's simply the greatest boy group song of all time, every moment is impactful

**DaHumanTorch** (11): one of my favorite pop songs period. this is a bit of a predictable 11/winner but a correct one

**foxinthenoodles** (11): A song that low key impacted the way kpop has sounded over the years. The house beats, the smooth melodies and the understated catchiness were all integral to making this a perfect song.

**orbiteezus** (11): this isn't my favorite shinee song (that would be ring ding dong) but its so good and their vocals are so emotionally captivating, especially jonghyun's

**sarcasticsobs** (11): https://imgur.com/a/lpFN34h

**Sedona83** (11): Perfection, replayed 10 times

**Shinkopeshon** (11): The first SHINee song I fell for and I'm still as obsessed with it as ever

**suffocatedbears** (11): i can't put into words how much i love this (and by extension, 4 walls as well)

**taeneon** (11): yeah we all know this is going to win

**tiltheendoftheline** (11): pop perfection, the type of song that leaves you humming when you least expect it. Also Minho is illegal here.

**aestheticen** (10): It’s simple and some people may find it too bland or basic, but I like it. It would have made me want to run through a tropical country at midday if I already didn’t live in one and know that I would sweat really badly if I did exactly that

**agentofscranton** (10): minho is and always has been a gorgeous man but blonde minho in that sleeveless franklin shirt is maybe the best a man has ever looked maybe ever? yes i think so (also the song is a banger but that’s obvious)

**akanewasright** (10): If this loses because belb and gucci are the only ones to score it lowly I will *find* them

**frogaranaman** (10): sounds like something I would hear in a sultry gay club where they’re trying to get the entire floor to hook up

**hasanella** (10): no flaws perfect my cup of tea sets the bar too high

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG. I love the relaxed and chill atmosphere, and the chorus refrain gets absolutely stuck in my head. Their vocals all shine here so brilliantly and uniquely. The fashion was so refreshing and forward for its time (even if it’s not my taste) and it feels like a song that remains modern, even 6 years later.

**hikkaru** (10): i love house inspired kpop so much. this could very well win and it would be deserved as shinee is THE bg :noitstrue:

**hyphen-happy** (10): another strong contender for my 11

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favourite kpop songs of all time, it’s perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): future rate winner

**jasannn** (10): I think part of the reasons why I love Kpop is that do summer songs so well.

**Jhe116** (10): Would give it a 11 if Sher11ock weren’t there. The intro always makes a certain part of my body very watery

**liberalitea** (10): if this is 4 Walls' brother, will it also get snubbed?

**lonelyglory** (10): Any moment you too could suddenly have View's hook stuck in your head

**nctdreamsqd** (10): This song revolutionized wearing simple clothes for music stage performances

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): they’re able to make every song so full of life

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): It's THE summer song, thank you so much Jonghyun. I remember the all of this era and this song and how this was the first K-Pop album I ever pre-ordered and how SM was late to upload the video and how I listened to Blue Night radio special when the album dropped. I hate to have all my SHINee comments be like "THIS REALLY BRINGS ME BACK", but like... this really does, all these songs do. I guess in a way all these bops make me feel idk free. It's extremely hard to put into words but I feel like when I listen to the majority of SHINee's music it just puts me on like a whole other plane of existence where it's just me and the music and I can do whatever I want and be whoever I want. Which is why even after going thru so many rock band and indie band phases (and still being in one rn, shout out CRX!), I always fucking come back to SHINee. And this song and this album are a huge part of that.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): between this and 4 Walls, SM was really into house in 2015

**skargardin** (10): they laced this honestly, so addictive

**SlphWsp** (10): So refreshing, they brought house to kpop and it was the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship, it's not summer without view. Made casual wear acceptable for stage costumes. Iconic

**specialtrickholdA** (10): It was a cultural reset... it was a cultural reset.

**sssaaage** (10): yeah its overrated but its still a great song and the best shinee song here its true....

**throwawayforshady** (10): It's been six years and it's as fresh as it was the first day

**TiltControls** (10): NOW THIS IS A BOP (mv is a little unremarkable compared to the rest though?). came very very close to the 11

**weappreciatepowers** (10): YAAAAASSS GAY

**Heedictated** (9.8): the go to summer boy group song

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): apparently i like house, i just didnt like 4 walls

**nyoom** (9.5): this is just so chill and cool and summer boppy how can you not love it

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Undoubtedly a great song, only thing I'm not too keen on is the bouncy synth but otherwise phenomenal

**Zypker125** (9.5): This MV is super whack, but the song itself is super good. It flows well, is very catchy, has a nice pleasant vibe, and has good vocals. Only complaint is that the bridge is kinda weak and rags the song.

**bluetriangles04** (9): Such a carefree, summer vibe. I love this song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Chromatica wishes its house influence was as a tenth as good as this.

**snugsnhugs** (9): More house in kpop pls. so so good

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I feel nostalgic over SM's house music era.

**BebeLuigi** (8): a bop

**BoneStreetSand** (8): This one slipped past my radar when it came out. Glad I’ve had this opportunity to revisit it!

wavingwolves: # Unseeing 

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i like it enough, but it’s just very repetitive

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Shinee can do better than this

**throwaway7650** (8): this song is good but also overrated, 4 walls >>> view, I hope it doesn't win (would also hate to see trash win a rate #onEW_OUT [6])

**elleyonce** (7): 4 Walls is better.

**hunnybee12** (7): it’s too gay to not win but i've never gotten the hype

**jaskiwhere** (7): Sorry to the v11ew agenda but this song's just too repetitive for that

**RandomHypnotica** (7): it’s cute but very safe and kinda generic

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i dont see why this is a frontrunner but its fine

**fadedblue09** (5.5): This does not hit as hard as I remembered :/ Maybe I'm just tired of this house sound but it feels so straightforward and basic for some reason.

**milkywayinradius** (5): it's an okay, kind of typical song. not really as special as other signature SHINee songs.

**PSSST12** (5): Time to be controversial on the TL! 4 walls by f(x) was widely revered in most kpop spaces but its very bland to me. And this song is just a more reductive version of that song so. .

**rickikardashian** (5): they would play this at a beach scene in fast and furious

**PRADA** (3): CHIRP

**moonagenightmares** (2.3): there’s only one good house song in existence and its artificial love, sorry to this song

**2dina3dworld** (2): I love Shinee, but this is the most boring trop k-pop song that I’ve heard.

sssaaage: thank you hosts !!!!! since yall love shinee so much you should stream their discography and their members solo albums (key, taemin, and ESPECIALLY jonghyun. we ignore onew bc its all ballads) they truly have a lot of the best albums in kpop, especially the main group + jonghyun

deleted: These results were painfully predictable and my kings GOT7 were robbed of a Top 10 spot but I can’t deny View is an amazing song and Shinee do sort of deserve all the hype they receive. There’s just other boy groups who deserve praise too, ya know??? Why girl group stans can only like one boy group is weird

TiltControls: I'm not too familiar with a lot of kpop inside jokes and lore, but with Belb and Gucci's amazing hosting I don't think that mattered, I still absolutely loved the reveal!!! (also thanks to bee for getting that cameo!)

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) like always!


##**Songs**

Though it misses the 9+ mark, **View** still lands at a very strong #349 on the all time song leaderboards (I've said it for the last few, but a lot of grab bag winners tend to end up around 8.9 averages, so this follows the pattern). It also gets the accolade of getting on to the **most 11s leaderboard** with a staggering 20 (which puts it at #19 for most 11s)!

##**Artists**

Not much to say here for official stats unfortunately. ~~The only artist to from the rate rn with more than 5 songs to track is **BTS** (thanks to their appearance in the previous rate). They land at spot #110/260 on the full leaderboard with a 7.576 total average.~~ Spotify lists BTS (as a whole) on SUGA's Interlude so they were given a rating since I usually blindly copy their listing, but thanks to belb for pointing out that it doesn't make much sense there (which I fully agree with in hindsight) so I'll go back and just leave SUGA as the only feature. For any BTS fans that are sad they're not on the rating list anymore at least cutting that song bumped their total average by about 0.3 points

Unofficially, we can look at the artists with 3+ songs in this rate (EXO, GOT7, SEVENTEEN, BIGBANG, SHINee). All of them picked up at least one 11 and one 0. For averages between them (and BTS) it goes SHINee > EXO > BTS > GOT7 > SEVENTEEN > BIGBANG (with SHINee and EXO both breaking an 8+ average).

Also it's not a trackable stat, but **SHINee** becomes the 2nd artist to make a top 2 sweep in a grab bag rate! (The first being Red Velvet on the companion K-pop Girl Group Rate! Though they did a full top 3 sweep)

##**Rates**

K-Pop BGs is now the **10th most participated rate** of all time! Great work hosts getting so many ballots sorted out!!! And thanks to everyone who got scores sent in!

funimarvel: Energetic should have been in the top 5 at least. I understand not liking You Calling My Name because of Mark's spoken word English bridge but the rest of GOT7's songs deserved better (especially Look and Lullaby). I can't believe Call Me Baby ranked highest or all of EXO's songs, Growl Monster and Overdose should have been higher. I also can't believe Run is that high and Spring Day is that low. Personally I would have ranked Miroh higher too but I'm happy it did well at all considering how much this sub seemed to hate Wonderland. Overall super disappointing how predictable the top 10 wound up being, you can tell what this sub likes (although idk how that translates to The Chaser being so high on the list...). Astro should have done better but also Knock, Blue Flame and All Night are better title tracks than crazysexycool. Also Focus on Me, UN Village or She Is should have won the bonus rate.

tiltheendoftheline: EXO top 5, SHINee won.... I'm a happy fan. Also, seriously, I have tried to listen to many different groups but SM production has crack on it, I don't know. I hope someday there's a bside rate so EXO's Gravity can win.

~~i will never stop mentioning this song until everyone knows about it~~
