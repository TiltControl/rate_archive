### [SHINee's back](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837510667652300830/861766472812068884/E5gmLfNVEAMSJ2j.png)? No, it's just us again!!

[And I'm thinking about this queen](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837510667652300830/837519527167393822/20210429_233605.jpg). 

Welcome to the second day of the Combatting Misandry & Xenophobia in Popheads event, which is also called the 2010s K-Pop Boy Groups rate! ~~I'll be reusing this joke on the Day 3 thread as well, don't worry.~~

This is the rate for people who paid real money to see an Avengers-like group of adult men  sing and dance on stage right before the pandemic really started... just like my co-host u/MoonlightByWindow has done. <3

If you don't know anything about most of these groups and just did the rate to support me, in particular, then get ready to have a fun time seeing the meltdowns today! In any case, it WILL be fun, and if it's not you will have no compensation, sorry.  But we do have a lot prepared. 

***

Today we will be revealing songs placing at **#40-#21** in the main rate and **#6-#4** in the bonus rate. 

**We'll be starting at 4pm EST**, an hour from now, so be ready! 

**The main event takes place at the [BeatSense room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj?ref=beatster&u=P17763eac1c32)**, where we will reveal the placements, have fun with shitposts (original or not) and listen to intermission songs that are, sometimes, not by men!! **BE THERE!!**

**And make sure to keep this thread open as well!** I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out and it features some banners featuring comments made by some of the funniest of you.

cherryices: Kpop LGBT propaganda was kickstarted with SHINee in 2008. I have done my extensive research and that is where I can see the influences starting to take place. Every group before them was pure and didn’t promote LGBT ideals. Now the industry is filth and flooded with it

**wavingwolves** (8.6): This is a case of a b-side that ended up having more longevity and getting more attention than the title itself, which for this comeback was 'Rush'. In 2015, this was the sound for a boy group to have and what really makes this song are the members themselves and their talents. Jooheon is IMPRESSIVE in this, his rap by the end really takes this to another level, and the vocalists are also great in this, especially Kihyun and Minhyuk. It all just works very well and this feels like it deserved a lot more than early Day 2, right after they lost their other song late Day 1 too. Ugh.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): It’s kinda iconic that this is a B-side which ended up being more popular than the actual title for this era (Rush), but I’m still not the biggest fan of this song. I don’t hate it but I don’t really like it either. Jooheon and I.M served here though.

---

# Pots and pans fans

**celladonn** (10): This is pretty much the peak of songs with this kind of brassy instrumental loop chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (10): do videogame vocals?

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The arcade sound effects are high camp. The drop buildup is kinda cheap, but it does the job flawlessly.

**grey/0x976** (10): an actual yass grenade and the broadcast version of this song even more bonkers i love you starship

**PSSST12** (10): a BANGER. The first time I heard that drop I swear I shat myself.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): I first watched the video for this in a church meaning it is now a blessed song and video. ~~In other news, I sure would let Wonho be my hero.~~

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): ended Enrique Iglesias

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): the senior guys in my HS danced to this and it was hot

**Heedictated** (9.8): BANGER

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): this and trespass outsold

**Zypker125** (9.8): The chorus drops are absolute fire (that last chorus is one of the true bangers of K-Pop), the song has a fun comic book and Super Mario concept, and Jooheon’s rap is fire. Kihyun’s pre-chorus and “I can be your hero” are super catchy as well. I.M.’s rap verse goes on for too long (they should’ve cut the second half of his rap out), but overall, still a fire banger.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): It's objectively really really funny that Monsta X performed to this song on the cartoon We Bare Bears. A great pop drop - so much fun.

**nyoom** (9.5): contains the line "put my underwear on over my pants"

**runaway3212** (9.5): the drop is perfection

**1998tweety** (9): massive bop, love the production

**2dina3dworld** (9): I CAN BE YOUR HERO *pots and pan noises*

**bobaroma** (9): This is Dope's brother isn't it? Bop.

**HeartofDarkness123** (9): Old MX is some of my favorite kpop, especially on the hype side. The rap line is actually good too, and it really contributes to the energy.

**SlphWsp** (9): Iconic mv, do not watch if afraid of heights. Not my usual style but that intrumental is just dangerously catchy, love the chiptune sounds, best scream in a kpop song?

**weappreciatepowers** (9): BE MY HERO MONSTA X THIS IS THE BEST SONG IVE EVER HEARD

**dekubaku** (8.8): THE Monsta X song.

**akanewasright** (8.5): Idk if this song is good but it uses so many fucking wild production elements that I can’t help but love it

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): What Wonho is to gay people

**TiltControls** (8.5): sign me up for anything with vg-like sound effects

**BoneStreetSand** (8.2): Another song I’d like so much more without seeing the video. They’re one of my most played kpop groups, but I just don’t enjoy their aggressive thirst trap aesthetics in this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): enrique igesias retired

**elleyonce** (8): Both Rush B-side and Broadcasting version are amazing btw, falling across either spectrum of the 8.

**Jhe116** (8): A very successful cover of Dope by BTS

**lonelyglory** (8): That. Horn. Synth.

**Leixander** (7.5): that mario mushroom sound effect sent me

**liberalitea** (7.5): WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT DROP BEFORE????

**jaskiwhere** (7): This is a nice mix of the early 10s sound and the late 3rd gen/early 4th gen sound that Monsta X would help usher in, I don't like the breakdown though

**Sedona83** (6.5): Good beat, different in a good way


# Marvel outsold 

**plastichaxan** (6.2): i was so hyped and then that drop came (i liked the verses tho)

**10footnotes** (6): So sorry to Monsta X, but they are the textbook example of the type of boy group sound I don’t vibe with. That said, even though their sound isn’t for me, I think they do a very good job executing it! This might be the most I’ve ever liked the MX formula.

**frogaranaman** (6): can’t believe the kpop industry appropriated another culture: gamers 😔

**taeneon** (6): i swear there's at least 10 other bg kpop songs that sound exactly like this

**throwaway7650** (6): this song is iconic but the chorus annoys me now unfortunately (but the video game noises are camp) #WONHO_INNOCENT

**pleasegivemeasword** (5.5): I’m repeating myself so much lol but I’ve heard this song before and had no idea it was by Monsta X

**suffocatedbears** (5.5): the pre-chorus knocks

**BebeLuigi** (5): I liked it at first but it gets a bit boring after a while

**jasannn** (5): +1 for the hyperpop bridge

**useless-sheep** (5): dance break carrying

**sssaaage** (4.5): can we PLEASE abolish saxophone/other brass drops (@ seventeen very nice)

**fadedblue09** (4.3): A B-side that ended up being more than the actual title track….and honestly it should've stayed as a bside. I have a soft spot for Monsta X but this mess was not it. Still puzzled as to how this was their biggest song for a while.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this mid 2010’s sound with lots of horns feels SUPER dated

**thedoctordances1940** (4): An annoying synth melody and a really annoying rap verse? Some bits are tolerable but this definitely isn't my favourite.

**foxinthenoodles** (3.5): The pop drop isn't exciting here at all, and the rest of the song is just grating.

**snugsnhugs** (3.5): generic, not my favorite but the dubstep part is cool

**bespectacIed** (3): Aww it's cute to see fetus wonho not be a gym rat yet

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): it's going down for real

**ImADudeDuh** (2.5): they put all their ideas into this, huh

**specialtrickholdA** (2.5): Monsta X seem like such nice guys but oof... so much of their music just ain’t my cup of tea.

**bulforster** (2.2): that drop is so fucking annoying

**PRADA** (2): this song is so BAD

funimarvel: Honestly the videos elevate a lot of the songs (especially the more recent ones, second generation videos are more hit or miss because they were often just dancing in a boring room lol). Some songs I probably wouldn't appreciate as much without the dance/visuals.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Although BTOB are definitely more known for (and more successful with) their pop ballad tracks like Missing You, I don’t really trust r/popheads to rate any song that has a sub-120 BPM hence why Wow and Movie were picked. And also because we thought they would be more Popheadscore but judging by where this placed, y’all did this song dirty too!

**wavingwolves** (9.4): BTOB are one of these groups who are actually pretty big in Korea and well recognizable domestically with a sizeable fanbase and hits, but little impact internationally in comparison. This is one of their earlier songs and definitely the best of them. I think this song just showcases this early swag era of BTOB, that was actually super fun if you don't take it seriously. BTOB as a group have a lot of different kind of materials and most of their hits consist of ballads, which are actually really good! They have very strong vocalists and are just cool and funny dudes all around, including Ilhoon who ended up leaving the group not too long ago, which was very sad to see.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me listening to this song

**moonagenightmares** (10): GEUBI DALLA NAMDALLA TAE TAE TAE TAEGA DALLA I LIIIIIIIKE ITTT

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): ***BTOB BACK AGAIN BTOB CHANGE THE GAME BTOB GET YOUR SWAG***

**sssaaage** (10): both btob songs here absolute smashas

**throwaway7650** (10): camp, love the chorus/guitar. WAOW! #PENIEL_INNOCENT

**ebooks #5454** (9.8): bad wardrobe, lovely song, WOW!!!

**Heedictated** (9.7): BOP

**hasanella** (9.5): i could cry this is so good

**Sedona83** (9.5): Replayed, very catchy

**throwawayforshady** (9.5): One of the best debuts ever

**grey/0x976** (9): YASS DOWN HAUS! Its a hit!

**Leixander** (9): feels like a song from bad/dangerous era MJ with the production

**seanderlust** (9): I hear that new jack swing influence :eyes:

**SlphWsp** (9): What a great pop song, it just delivers

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): this is soooooo catchy and groovy

**TragicKingdom1** (9): we love new jack swing!!

**10footnotes** (8): Latin guitar + new jack swing beat + extremely effective hook is a fun lil combo.

**elleyonce** (8): BTOB BACK AGAIN. BTOB CHANGE THE GAME. BTOB GOT YOUR SWAG!!!!!!

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): This song is pretty fun. It feels very playful, especially with the constant adlibs. The high vocals sound very sly and I’m into it.

**BoneStreetSand** (7.9): Why did they bend over and stroke their own asses in the MV?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the beginning is kind of weird but it’s a bop after that

**PRADA** (7.8): it’s also good yass

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**dekubaku** (7.5): Very 2nd Gen which is not a bad thing at all!

**Jhe116** (7.5): Early 2010s swag pop is usually cringy but Eunkwang is somehow iconic in this I don’t know why

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's good but a little bit forgettable i fear

**cleopatroclus** (7.3): vocal fry giving me taeyong flashbacks but otherwise the rest is fun

**PSSST12** (7): Beep Beep outsold. There's nothing remarkable about this song but atleast its energetic.

**universemates** (7): BTOB has some of my favorite Kpop songs but they definitely shine a lot more in their pop ballads tracks à la Missing You.


# Not wow'd 

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): Not wow’d

**nyoom** (6): i was gonna make a joke about "Born to Beat" but there's literally nothing i could say that's funnier than just the knowledge that that's what BTOB stands for https://bit.ly/36brNWP

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): What is this hahaha I wasn’t expecting this from BTOB… The song is kinda goofy imo but their vocals are still good

**RandomHypnotica** (6): wow this was average

**runaway3212** (6): forgettable

**TiltControls** (6): wow. turns out they were dust the whole time

**Zypker125** (5.8): I will never get the 2nd gen boy group obsession with using falsettos, because it’s not good. The song just lacks the energy of other songs with similar tones/vibes.

**hikkaru** (5.5): idk how to feel about this

**BebeLuigi** (5): cutish

**bluetriangles04** (5): Wow! More like ‘Mid!’ for me sadly

**gabcac** (5): i honestly never liked this song

**galaxy\_rae** (5): Catchy beat.

**jaskiwhere** (5): The intro knocked it down a point, but also I just did not vibe with this song

**suffocatedbears** (4.5): this feels generic and faceless, and btob doesn't shine with such a concept imo

**weappreciatepowers** (4.5): not bad but lord WHY IS IT SO LONG?

**bespectacIed** (4): sungjae cutie

**foxinthenoodles** (4): Sounds old and unexciting.

**snugsnhugs** (4): its fine, sounds really dated now

**fadedblue09** (3.7): Probably a hot take among Western fans but I prefer BtoB with their later ballad/AC sound as it highlights their talents much better. These cringe swag bops were not it. Obligatory Pray/Missing You robbed

**taeneon** (2): yeah it's bad

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): As the representative of their early hep hap days before they started going down the artsy youth route, it’s understandable this song placed the lowest out of all the BTS songs considering this era is when they had the least fans and is probably different from what people expect to hear when they think of BTS. Personally though, this is one of my favourite BTS titles - the final “NEO TTAEMUNE NEOMU APA” bit makes me astral project. Also I am one of those annoying ex-ARMYs who says that early BTS music was better, sorry!

**wavingwolves** (8.3): Oh, look who it is — it's angsty early BTS! This is actually great and we wanted to include because we know a lot of people who have heard BTS had never really cared to listen to their earlier material, which is still really good and has actually a lot more identity than their recent output. Besides Danger, the highlights of this era were Boy With Luv, War of Hormone and Just One Day (which is so underrated but Suga makes that song). If you liked this, you should listen to that too. When it comes to placement, this actually feels pretty right, but I'm sure that if this was any other group it would have been a Day 1 song.

# Teenager Emoboy Emotion Next generation Talent Object Praise

**2dina3dworld** (10): this stupid song. My god, it bangs so much despite being so angsty that it becomes silly, but still. The “parallel lines” lines get me everytime. As soon as that comes in, I’m gone. I’m willing to sell my soul for whatever crack BTS put in this song.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I barely recognized them in this video but their sound is so iconic.

**grey/0x976** (10): WE LOVE YOU YOONGI OUR EVERLASTING STARLIGHT COSMIC MEOW MEOW

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this sounds like it was tailor made for a Need for Speed soundtrack in the best way possible

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): My favorite of the "hip hop swag" BTS tracks! (Other than like Cypher Pt. 3, but that's its own beast.) Is it bad that I want them to go back to this type of sound?????

**skargardin** (10): now hold on.. this is going all the way OFF

**throwawayforshady** (10): For a  really long time Danger was my favorite BTS song

**Zypker125** (10): By far the best raps of any BTS title track, rap-line hasn’t come close to topping the superb raps in this single. The bass and instrumental go super hard, the chorus drops into the low-tone vocals is absolute fire, and the song is super catchy.

**Heedictated** (9.6): IDK why everyone overlooks this bop when discussing bts title tracks this has that iconic 2nd gen chorus with the 3rd gen production

**bobaroma** (9.5): I just wish this song was 25% faster. Thank me later

**BoneStreetSand** (9.5): Surprised that I could forget how much I liked this. Haven’t heard it in years! Might even be in my personal BTS top ten.

**PRADA** (9.3): this is their second best songs thank you for picking

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Damn the Bangtan boys didn't need to go this hard oh my god.

**elleyonce** (9): My favorite part of this is the honking in Jhope's verse, among all my other favorite parts.

**jaskiwhere** (9): The chorus for this song is addictive, and this is a prime example of early BTS doing what early BTS did best by letting rapline + danceline shine (and letting vocalists sing in their actual range! a concept!)

**sarcasticsobs** (9): as someone only casually aware of BTS and mainly their stuff post-“Boy With Luv” this was a *whirlwind*

**seanderlust** (9): BTS said "am I a joke to you?"

**sssaaage** (9): i actually used to hate this song so much but luckily it grew on me

**throwaway7650** (9): one of BTS' most underrated title tracks. rapper jungkook!

**TiltControls** (8.5): what i'm in when people see my pop/rap 0

**bigbigbee** (8): I can't believe I hadn't heard this before! I really like it. I remember distinctly thinking in 2013/2014 or so that BTS were doing a decent job of being a Block B/BAP clone, and that they'd do about as well as either of those groups. It's crazy how things turn out.

**bluetriangles04** (8): Danger, more like Banger!

**hasanella** (8): i am army and thus biased but a good song is a good song okay also jin really shines and his voice is magic in this song

**lonelyglory** (8): I don't recall this one from people introducing me to BTS tracks ages ago wtf JHope is fire on this.

**orbiteezus** (8): this is my favorite older BTS song, love the guitar

**PSSST12** (8): LMAAAAAAAOOO if you remember this try-hard hep hop era of bts you qualify for a senior's discount. This song was polarizing upon release but I adored it so much back then

**runaway3212** (8): So true bestiefriend

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): I have listened only to everything post Wings so this is my first time. Man, one of my favorite title tracks from them by far. I love the chorus and the rap.

**jasannn** (7.8): I often forget that BTS released this but its a solid pop song. The vocals and raps are on point and everything is catchy and memorable, ironically

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): what do I call the background sounds? mario paint dog barks?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): early BTS is such a different vibe from current BTS lol

**bulforster** (7.2): Solid but I'd appreciate a bit more singing and a bit less shouting.

**1998tweety** (7): we dont talk about this era (at least its not War of Hormone)

**ebooks #5454** (7): ngl i miss this flavor of angry music they made (if you're reading this, i highly reccommend the song DOPE by BTS). i actually took a course about asian masculinity and pop culture and there was a whole unit about kpop. its quite interesting to see the shift in appearance in music style and aesthetics of  boy groups from really angsty/bad boy gang member/hypersexualized to super flowery/posh preppy/cutesy; BTS is the living example of this trend

**fadedblue09** (7): This is my first time listening to pre-I Need U BTS and it's….not bad, shows off their rapping very well

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): Definitely one of my preferred BTS songs but on listen it’s really not that special.

**nyoom** (7): this reminded me that they started their career explicitly marketing to middle schoolers with this hilarious tough guy 15yo oppa shtick. they should go back to that

**rickikardashian** (7): the hosts saved BTS’ average by not choosing Dope for this rate

**suffocatedbears** (7): back when bts had an identity (':

**akanewasright** (6.9): This is alright but it’s not my vibe

**aestheticen** (6.5): Good chorus, not a fan of the rest of the song

**dekubaku** (6.5): Ah emo baby BTS. Not their best but the chorus is pretty good.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): the prechorus! one of the few times they snapped


# Adult Non-emoboy Coldness Past generation Inability Approve Criticize

**cherryices** (6): this was not a concept i enjoyed for them, but the song is quite earworm-y

**hunnybee12** (6): they really did not pull of the bad boy concept they were aiming for at the time lmao

**SlphWsp** (6): Great acting and intro, rest of the song doesn't live up to it, repetitive and drags on a bit

**spacebunsailor** (6): sorry im one of the few that prefers their newer stuff

**weappreciatepowers** (6): not bad too long

**pleasegivemeasword** (5.5): Danger isn’t a bad song I just like a lot of their other songs more

**BebeLuigi** (5): it's cute

**DaBigBoi** (5): Pre-chorus is the best part and loses momentum with the chorus

**DraculaWeekend** (5): This song stressed me out

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is kinda boring?

**nctdreamsqd** (5): I liked the chorus but the verses were meh

**Sedona83** (4.5): Not really feeling angsty BTS

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this sounds like a high school musical song

**hikkaru** (4): well at least they're not dominating the world with this

**cleopatroclus** (3.9): felt like my ears were being viciously assaulted, some of their voices are rly grating. If i wanted incels to shout in my ear i’d just go downstairs and talk to my dad for 5 seconds, same result

**foxinthenoodles** (3.5): Nothing special and the vocals are messy.

**taeneon** (3): boring and generic

**bespectacIed** (1): none of the bts songs i like (dna, fake love, dream glow) are here. Not even the recent number 1 hits that i tolerate. sorry but bts early music is NOT it

**snugsnhugs** (1): i dont like this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): It’s good but I don’t really *love* it. I appreciate it has more band influence than you usually would find in K-pop though. I feel like TVXQ kind of suffered here because their more well-known (and also better) songs are pre-2010 like Rising Sun and Mirotic. I’m just not a huge fan of any 2VXQ titles. But I do agree with y’all that The Chance of Love is better!

**wavingwolves** (6): This is good, and I probably underrated this, but at first just it doesn't feel like the type of song I'm really draw towards. It's filled with charisma and it's actually insanely catchy ~~(surisuri)~~, though, and I can see why anyone would like this a lot. The vocals are also great in this, it just makes the experience even more enjoyable.

**BebeLuigi** (10): it flows so nicely I love it, the vibe of it is amazing too

**bespectacIed** (10): dilfs who make better music than their younger peers, what's not to like

**bobaroma** (10): yyj at full force

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is just so… slick

**DraculaWeekend** (10): So smooth

**grey/0x976** (10): YASSSSSSS DOWN HAUS

**hikkaru** (10): as a former jazz band hoe this is an automatic 10

**Leixander** (10): that intro! that's how you start a song (also the runs in the background!!!)

**sssaaage** (10): this was a really close 11 contender for me but didnt make it, im committing a hate crime if it flops

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): loooove this groove

**endcreditouilles** (9.6): the music video!! bisexuals won

**jasannn** (9.5): Incredible vocals and amazing chorus. This was my favorite rediscovery of the rate.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): I was hoping for Catch Me, but you know what, I'll take this too. To save myself from writing another essay, I will just say that the TVXQ sure does make better music than JYJ (and kinda turned out to be better guys...) and this song has ever right to be regarded as a classic. Also that chorus is perfection.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): ooh groovy

**seanderlust** (9): the korean version of the dalton academy warblers

**throwaway7650** (9): they absolutely crushed the concept/genre, love the MV

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**cherryices** (8.5): excellent MV. i am definitely watching for more than just the hot backup dancers

**bluetriangles04** (8): Makes me want to be a magician for Halloween.

**elleyonce** (8): I prefer noise TVXQ over Jazz TVXQ but Surisuri has a way to worm into your head.

**fadedblue09** (8): Very soulful and flavorful bop

**foxinthenoodles** (8): A timeless song that doesn't lose its charm and smooth grooves over time.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this song was cute but not over 4 minutes long cute

**SlphWsp** (8): Jazzy and smooth, too many effects on their vocals, fun mv and choreo, but no Mirotic or Catch Me

**BoneStreetSand** (7.6): I kept adjusting my score for this. It went up and down then up again. I recognised it as good but there was just something stopping me from scoring it higher.

**Sedona83** (7.5): Reminds me of a 90s song

**weappreciatepowers** (7.5): cute

**akanewasright** (7): this was really cute actually

**ebooks #5454** (7): the ladies are kinda stealing the show here

**galaxy\_rae** (7): good video and so fun

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the jazz influence is cute but this is kind of boring

**skargardin** (7): the horns are quite good here

**TiltControls** (7): mv is neat, but the song is missing... something. I'm not sure what exactly but it needs an extra spark


# the Inquisition


**ImADudeDuh** (6): really peaked at the intro

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): I like the vibe it’s totally different from the other songs on the list

**PSSST12** (6): Blander version of "something". Next.

**snugsnhugs** (6): pretty good, love the horns and the grooviness. Gets a bit repetitive though

**bigbigbee** (5.5): The MV/choreo for this is cheese city but in a fun way. Song's only ok to me though.

**jaskiwhere** (5.5): Why is this intro so needlessly long? I'm not a huge jazzercise fan so this isn't something that appeals to me

**Zypker125** (5.5): The vocal runs in the song are great, and it has the trademarks of early SM songs. However, the chorus isn’t very catchy/memorable, and the song is not fun enough for its concept.

**plastichaxan** (5): sorry i don't like straight people that much

**PRADA** (5): average

**HeartofDarkness123** (4): I’m not sure I get the appeal to this one. I like it less than pretty much every other TVXQ song I’ve heard, and it doesn’t stand out to me.

**suffocatedbears** (4): this felt very draggy

**nyoom** (3.5): this song feels old and not in a good way

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): Can you believe this song was actually a mainstay in the top 10 at one point? At some point it just started slowly sliding down the ranks until it ended up here. I know some people really don’t like this song but I personally love it - I think it pulls off a dark atmosphere very well and it’s definitely one of the most unique songs in the rate. I can’t recall any other K-pop song that sounds similar to the 7th Sense, but some of you probably rejoice at that!

**wavingwolves** (8.6): Regarded as one of the best debuts of all time by *some* k-pop fans, this definitely feels very unique and different compared to other debuts, and even other titles. The 7th Sense has almost this creepy feel to it, which isn't really like anything else, but it's also off putting. The best part of this song are actually the vocalists, Doyoung in particular of course, which are usually underused in NCT's stuff. In comparison, Taeyong had less parts in this it could be a full 10, I just feel like there's always more of him than needed in any given song.

**milkywayinradius** (11): OPEN YOUR EYES. this song is amazing, and that CHOREO, wooo boy. that falsetto "take it slow, take it slow" mmmm!! i love the dark, cool vibes. i wish i was taeyong's hat. everyone please do themselves a favor and watch the performance MV of this song.

**1998tweety** (10): i just KNOW this song is gonna get snubbed even though its so ahead of its time. Still one of the greatest debuts in k-pop periodt.

**2dina3dworld** (10): say what you like, but "long ass ride" is an iconic line

**akanewasright** (10): This beat took my virginity

**bigbigbee** (10): Creepy, lazy, atmospheric, and weird. I love it. Why doesn't NCT try bizarre new stuff like THIS anymore?

**bobaroma** (10): open your rice

**bookthieving** (10): for ten

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Iconic, an 11 contender, this MV gives me chills

**gabcac** (10): so empty but so full at the same time

**galaxy\_rae** (10): Good in every way!

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): This song is almost eerie with the incredibly simple but prominent bass, and I really love the atmosphere it has, especially with the background vocals. That fade out was powerful. THAT’S A LONG ASS RIDE-

**hyphen-happy** (10): this list is making me seem like an sm stan and i s2g im not lol

**PSSST12** (10): Not gonna lie I never understood the hype for this song at first but now it slaps. That production is absolutely hypnotic. Ms. Ten deserves everything. 🤧

**SlphWsp** (10): Dark and atmospheric, great blend of instrumental and vocals, insane choreo, a masterpiece tbh, not sure NCT ever topped this, what a strong start

**sssaaage** (10): incredible excellence perfection etc i love you doyoung my little meow meow

**suffocatedbears** (10): it's been a long ass ride indeed but this remains one of their best songs

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): perfect. I love the mysterious vibe, the vocals (the Jaehyun part is chefs kiss) and the choreo is freaking amazing.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): sounds like the sexiest nightmare i’ve ever had

**throwaway7650** (9.5): ICONIC debut. great song despite one (1) taeyong

**cleopatroclus** (9.3): jeremy open ur eyes

**bluetriangles04** (9): UH! AND THAT’S A LONG ASS RIDE!

**BoneStreetSand** (9): So much cooler than the other NCT songs wow. One of my favourites from this rate for sure. Taeyong sweetie you’re doing fantastic.

**foxinthenoodles** (9): They tried to do something very unique and it worked so well and was the start of something exciting. It's surprising they haven't tried to replicate the sound since.

**grey/0x976** (9): YASS #DOWN i want nct to disband immediately but this is a slay

**hunnybee12** (9): changed lives

**jasannn** (9): For my artsy, experimental popheads.

**moonagenightmares** (9): quite likely the best bg debut ever, the mv and choreo were a cultural reset, taeyong’s frog voice drags it down a bit i fear

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): *Obligatory "Open your rice" and "Jeremy open your eyes" comments go here.* With that out of the way, I think we need to all talk about how hard the bass on this song goes. Like... I can feel that bass just fucking swallowing me whole, and I LIKE IT. Kinda sad that this one never seemed to make as much of a splash as the other song they debuted with. I mean come on, Mark literally says "AND THAT'S A LONG ASS RIDE" and yet this song was done dirty.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I like this even though it’s not super ~boppy~, it sounds really cool to me

**Shinkopeshon** (8.5): Mork's first iconic line

**throwawayforshady** (8.5): They should've debuted a permanent group with these members only fight me

**Heedictated** (8.1): truly unique but not something I'd replay tho "that's a long ass ride" is super satisfactory

**celladonn** (8): There's no other kpop song that sounds like this. I wouldn't really want there to be, but this remains singularly intriguing

**Sedona83** (8): And that's a long ass ride lol

**weappreciatepowers** (8): it was fine

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.6): long ass ride

**nyoom** (7): i haven't forgiven any of these nct songs for not being Boss but this one's ok i guess

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Such a solid debut and one of my favorite NCT U songs

**Zypker125** (6.1): One of the contenders for the #1 spot (definitely a favorite with Redditors). I like the direction/concept of this song. I’ll just say it, though: Taeyong ruins the song, his nasally voice takes up so much of the song and doesn’t match the sensual/dreamy vibe of the song at all. If Taeyong wasn’t in this song, this could be a ~9 song for me, but Taeyong is so mismatched with this song that it brings down the score a lot. Also, the end of the song goes on for way too long.


# Stream Eyes Wide Shut by STANLEY KUBRICK!!


**cremeebrulee** (6): this is a weeknd song (derogatory)

**lonelyglory** (6): I don't enjoy the song at all alone but damn is the performance great

**skargardin** (6): this is pretty distinct from the rest of the rate so far.. love that for them. but I'm not terribly interested in it either way skull

**specialtrickholdA** (6): Interesting production but it just doesn’t go anywhere, this just never clicked for me.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): The least interesting of the NCT songs in my opinion.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): the U stands for "underbaked song"

**CrimsonROSET** (4): can you take it fast instead

**DaBigBoi** (4): Open your ears

**frogaranaman** (4): sorry to NCT but this sounds like a Luigi Mansion's song

**jaskiwhere** (4): The dance was cool but I don't like this otherwise

**TiltControls** (4): welcome to NCT University

**useless-sheep** (4): don't need this… my eyes are already wide open thank you twice

**RandomHypnotica** (3): wait what’s the 6th sense? Can they all see dead people too?

**PRADA** (2.8): SO BAD WTF

**fadedblue09** (2.5): This song always underwhelms me cuz everyone calls it a masterpiece but on every listen, it just feels like waiting for something that never arrives. Idk man, maybe I just don't get NCT. Sorry!

**aestheticen** (2): This is barely a song

**BebeLuigi** (2): I know it's a favourite among the fandom but I just never appreciated it

**bespectacIed** (2): The antithesis of cherry bomb for me, in a sense (hehe) that everyone loves this but I don't get why... It's so boring. I wish Kick It was in its place because it's amazing and I wanna talk about johnny's abs

**ebooks #5454** (2): im sleeping

**snugsnhugs** (2): its different but too one-note for me

**rickikardashian** (1): what does NCT bring to the table other than 20 members too many in their lineup

# I want to highlight these comments just because they're funny to me 

**runaway3212** (1): you have seven senses and still released this?????

**hikkaru** (0): this is so dreadful this beat feels like moving through syrup

**ignitethephoenix** (0): my 7th sense is unbothered by this song in fact I think it died

**wavingwolves** (9): I can't begin to explain how big of a hit this was in Korea. This was comparable to Old Town Road levels of being hit, it was inescapable and kindergarten students LOVED it. I personally have really tender feelings for this song and this era of iKON, which gave us their best project and one of my favourite k-pop projects overall, which was the Return album. I actually don't like the last 40s of this song very much, but the rest of it feels really nice and it makes me think of better times.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): If we had done this rate in 2018, this definitely would have been a 10 but it’s grown off me a bit now. I still really like it though, and the chorus occasionally gets stuck in my head even now so I see why it completely ruled Korean charts in 2018! I think technically the most successful song in this list too? I find it impressive how after YG completely shipped iKON to Japan in 2016 (despite their huge success with some songs in 2015 like My Type, Rhythm Ta, and Apology..) and Bling Bling and B-Day flopped in 2017, they were able to have such a hugely successful 2018 with Love Scenario, Killing Me, and Goodbye Road. I’ll forever be grateful iKON at least had one amazing year in their career before it all went to shit with Hanbin leaving due to his drugs scandal - and by extension, most iKONics leaving the fandom too (like me and Belb!). As an aside, I’m not usually one of those fans who cares what the lyrics are in K-pop songs but I do really appreciate how rather than a “omg why don’t you love me back” song, this is a “what we had was good and I’m sad it ended but I’m glad it happened in the first place” song. We love Hanbin’s pen!

# Korean kindergarten students


**ebooks #5454** (11): i have many points to say here: 1) the way i heard this song my my college friends' kpop dance performance and for 2 years had trouble finding out what the title was until one day i was napping in the club office and someone was blasting this and i immediately rose from my slumber and asked WHAT IS THIS CURSED SONG CALLED and its also quite embarassing since they say the words "love scenario" in the chorus :deadbanana: 2) i had a crush on this half korean guy and this was his favorite kpop song ever (i thought bc this wasn't BTS that this was a refined, cultured, indie choice, but then i learned everyone circle jerks to this song) so naturally i took that like the word of god and listened to THE ENTIRE ALBUM in attempts to impress him which leads me to 3) iKon is actually quite nice, the entirety of RETURN really slaps. i know i'm not allowed to complain about the songs bc this is a grab bag and i understand thought and care were put in to these picks, but i wish "my type" made it onto this list that song goes hard and i swear iKON is better hence why i must balance out my 0 with this 11 altho tbh i'd rather give the 11 to growl

**BebeLuigi** (10): one of the contender for my 11!!! It's like one of the most addictive song ever created with an amazing atmosphere and production! It really is a masterclass of the genre imo

**foxinthenoodles** (10): A song that just begs to be sung along with. Incredibly simple and doesn't take itself too seriously, but hits on every level and is a perfect pop song.

**hunnybee12** (10): korea had taste with this one

**lonelyglory** (10): Not a song I loved at first listen back when it dropped, but it hits me right through the heart every time now. I just love that while it's a bit forlornly melancholic, it emotionally resolves at "I'm glad this happened, I'll keep it with me, but life moves on".

**PSSST12** (10): A bop. An 11 contender. I love this kind of sound so much.

**snugsnhugs** (10): impossible not to sing the chorus. Amazingly catchy hook, am still sad that BI is no longer in this group as this song is one of his masterpieces

**universemates** (10): This would have gotten my 11 if it wasn't for the Dreamies. Super earwormy and I love Hanbin's lyricism. I'm a sucker for bittersweet breakup songs where neither is really at fault and you can still look back at the relationship in a positive light.

**jaskiwhere** (9.9): Unfortunately I've overplayed this song by now but I still do like it and I did love it at some point

**Heedictated** (9.7): instant classic tho personally not too impressed with the chanting climax

**jasannn** (9.5): January 2018 was really that bitch.

**2dina3dworld** (9): this is going to get tanked, but if this wasn’t by a YG boy group it’d be a Day 3 song, bet.

**hasanella** (9): literally heaven can not get better than this

**SlphWsp** (9): Chill bop, languid and cathartic, for hot summer nights with friends

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute, Im Ok outsold tho

**Zypker125** (8.2): This became an absolute hit domestically as well as internationally. I can see why, the chorus is very catchy, mixing chill dance-pop with catchy fun vibes. The rap verses here are kinda weak and the bridge drags the song out, but overall, it’s a fun song.

**bluetriangles04** (8): The classic that had South Korea bent over in 2018!

**Sedona83** (8): Enjoyable right off the bat

**throwaway7650** (8): it was a huge hit for a reason #HANBIN_INNOCENT

**cherryices** (7.6): thought this might have been sampling kylie minogue but i guess not??

**BoneStreetSand** (7.5): Sen/Ar/Eee/Oh???? Probably one of the best songs on the list but I can’t accept this. I don’t mind accents but this pronunciation triggers a primal anger.

**fadedblue09** (7.3): Much easier to rate this now that it isn't being played everywhere, though I'm still not fond of some vocal stylings, and I still get surprised how big this got in SK. If we did this rate a few years ago, this would be a winner contender but now I'm not sure.

**aestheticen** (7): Maybe I am a kindergarten student in South Korea

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I respect the decision to just use a metronome as percussion.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): melodrama? Doing more promo than Lorde ever did here


# Korean retail workers 


**TiltControls** (6.5): "I feel neutrally to this' scenario

**10footnotes** (6): One of the rare YG hits whose production I don’t hate!

**akanewasright** (6): This isn’t good, but it’s not good in a way I can vibe with.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): legendary smash but its a bit background music for me

**grey/0x976** (6): painfully mid i dont think ive ever heard someone "ayo put on that love scenario track"

**moonagenightmares** (6): i hate that yg thing where they all sing the chorus near the end like they’re drunk at a karaoke bar

=====

wavingwolves: **nyoom** (6): the melody is very simplistic but it works thematically for a song about an utterly unremarkable romance, this universal experience of a love that wasn't world-shaking, ended without fanfare, and now doesn't mean anything to anyone but you, and maybe them. something to look back on fondly and say, yeah, i was in love, and i was loved, and it hurt when it was over but ultimately it helped me grow. i think it makes sense that that sort of mundane, grown-up romanticism would resonate with younger audiences especially. ikon's voices still kinda annoying tho

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): I know this song was huge but I really don't get the appeal tbh

**Jhe116** (5.8): Never get the hype about this song, some would say it’s a Timber knockoff

**cleopatroclus** (5.6): feel like this song is just a repeat of the first 30seconds over and over with some generic rap thrown in the middle

**CrimsonROSET** (5): ikonkomo

**PRADA** (5): overrated and kind of aged but still kings

**suffocatedbears** (5): hanbin king but i never got the appeal of this song

**weappreciatepowers** (5): it's fun i guess

**useless-sheep** (4.6): this song feels nerdy

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): omg he said the lorde album

**sssaaage** (4.3): this was one of the first songs i heard when i was getting into kpop and its still fine ig.. the chorus is so annoying though

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): This is a slog, ~~and the Melodrama name drop isn't helping~~.

**HeartofDarkness123** (4): A fun song but I’ve never really understood why people love this song sooo much. Nothing about it is catchy to me and I’m not one who prefers cute and fluffy romantic songs.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4): This is what plays in one of those new "hip" Disney Channel original movies. Change my mind. If not then maybe one of those 5 Minute Crafts videos. (This is me trying to funnily say it sounds like fucking stock music.)

**specialtrickholdA** (4): There were so many great boy group songs in 2018 so I’ll never understand why this of all songs was the one to become a massive hit.

**bespectacIed** (3): the chokehold this had on south korea is insane. Could have funded 1828921 blackpink comebacks in 2017-18 smh. Dudebro music

**bigbigbee** (3): Never understood how this one blew up in Korea. It's so simple and repetitive. This sounds like getting bonked on the head repeatedly with an inflatable mallet to me.

**frogaranaman** (2): based on this song, this love scenario sucks. break up with them

**hikkaru** (1): animal crossing new leaf soundtrack but make it trap/edm

# Using this space to reiterate that RHYTHM TA is actually a good song


**runaway3212** (4): Slightly less horrible than RHYTHM TA

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Composed of Hui and E’Dawn from Pentagon + K-pop legend Hyuna, I’m ruling this is the most iconic subunit on the list just because in 2018 E’Dawn and Hyuna were revealed to have started dating before Pentagon even debuted + they were like “hey I know we’re in a relationship and all but let’s be in a subunit with Hui and see if anyone starts to suspect we’re dating” and then it massively backfired and they got kicked out of CUBE Entertainment for it. But now they’re both under Psy’s company and E’Dawn gets to release camp slays like Dawndididawn so #LOVEWINS

**wavingwolves** (8.1): Wheeeew!! I'm relived this song isn't winning just because it has a woman, and what a woman! Hyuna brings a lot of cunty energy to every song she performs and I love that. Triple H as a subunit just worked so well and I liked it better than both Hyuna's solo work at the time + Pentagon's stuff, so I was really sad to see the fallout of that. This could be a little higher compared to some of the songs that are still in but I'm not too mad.

**1998tweety** (10): we need a comeback

**agentofscranton** (10): hui iconic third wheel

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I'M 365 SO FRESH

**hasanella** (10): my literal jam and butter

**hyphen-happy** (10): who was doing it like triple h :(((

**lonelyglory** (10): Fresh. Funky. Fantastic.

**milkywayinradius** (10): if i had a grocery store, i would use this song for my produce commercials

**pat-rickstar** (10): Big bop

**rickikardashian** (10): in the most popheads move ever, the only song featuring a woman wins!

**rotating3Dtext** (10): god I wish that were me. which of the three? that’s your guess

**seanderlust** (10): no disrespect to bruno and cardi but this is the finesse remix three years earlier and better

**SFbby** (10): Can we make the only woman in a kpop boy groups rate win?

**SlphWsp** (10): Best project group since Troublemaker? So funky, mv and acting are next level amazing and Hui's voice is heavenly, will always sound fresh, devastated that we'll never get a comeback, play this at my funeral

**sssaaage** (10): i actually hadnt heard this before the rate (sadly) but its probably one of my favorite songs here, still not good as the best song ever created DAWNDIDIDAWN though

**BoneStreetSand** (9.7): I hope when I kill someone, a disco beat plays too.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): hyuna ate... might be my favorite song she's in ever

**10footnotes** (9): (Woozi from Seventeen voice) 365 carat magic in the aaa-aaa-aaaiirr… This is better than 24k Magic, though, because it doesn’t have Bruno Mars’ undercurrent of treating women like cardboard cutouts :)

**BebeLuigi** (9): I'm so mad at Cube Triple H songs were so good hello

**Heedictated** (9): fresh and funky

**weappreciatepowers** (9): bop

**celladonn** (8.5): A WOMAN???? In the BOY GROUP RATE????

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): Hyuna on this is cheating /s

**reiichitanaka** (8.5): but the MV is 11 for sure

**bespectacIed** (8): Saving the only female voice in this rate for last. Yeah this was basically "hyuna and edawn are obviously fucking so let's throw in hui there to throw off the scent" scenario lmao iconic if you think about it

**Leixander** (8): hyuna??? in my k-pop boy band bonus rate??? it is more likely than you think

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): There needs to be more subunits/groups like them asap

**universemates** (8): Hyuna is the hottest woman in the industry I don't make the rules

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): Hyuna, the queen of all men, and this rate

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Hyuna's the worst part of this song for me by far, sorry queen.

**HeartofDarkness123** (7.5): I have to bump this up at least .5 for being beautiful bisexual polycule chaos. Hui’s voice and parts are absolutely beautiful but I kind of loathe the chorus refrain of “365 so fresh!”

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): In the verses there's a harmonized vocal fill that is the exact same as can be found in Bruno Mars's Treasure and I can't unhear it now.

**Jhe116** (7.3): We had Retro Future

**akanewasright** (7): I love uptown funk!

**bobaroma** (7): If 24K Magic was Korean, then this is it.

**elleyonce** (7): Shoutout HUI, gotta be my favorite THIRD WHEEL.png

**foxinthenoodles** (7): Bouncy but tired.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): I need the bisexuals to weigh in on whether or not this is bisexual rights. Anyways, I am gonna go be sad for like 5 seconds that we didn't rate Troublemaker instead!

**taeneon** (7): HYUNA MY GIRL

**cleopatroclus** (6.8): feels like a rip off of an already annoying bruno mars song, however hyuna is here so

**nyoom** (6): pour one out for hyuna and her poorly dressed boytoy's third wheel. you are seen and appreciated, dude!

**Sedona83** (6): New jack swing, catchy

**snugsnhugs** (6): fresh and funky but…hyuna’s voice is soooo grating…….sorry

**jaskiwhere** (4): certified rotten (tm)

**Zypker125** (3.6): I dislike Hyuna’s and E’Dawn’s nasally voices, so I dislike 2/3rd of the song. Hui’s vocals redeem part of the song.

**fadedblue09** (3): Iconic MV but this was so disappointingly bland. Hui slayed his parts I guess.

**gabcac** (3): a big downgrade from troublemaker

**moonagenightmares** (1): i cannot explain how much i hate songs like this. fuck u bruno

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Another one of my favourite K-pop songs! I honestly really love this song, it’s so fun. This is also such a change in concept for the group that was founded on being “Korea’s Eminem Project” (yes, really). I’m kinda surprised it didn’t at least get into the top half of the rate, but I guess we don’t like Zico?

**wavingwolves** (9): One word to describe this: FUN!!! This is one the songs with the most energy and charisma from this list. Since the first time I listened to this it became kind of an instant classic for me, it's just so memorable and unique. This has one of my favourite instrumentals too, everything in it works for me in a way it almost feels like it shouldn't since it always feels like the instrumental is rushing towards something, but the guitar in this is just sweet. I think I already said this, but I'll basically eat up any song that has a good strong guitar line, and HER has it for daaaays.

# H.E.R. fans


**CrimsonROSET** (11): ‘it’s excellent baby’ i mean he tried to warn me

**bobaroma** (10): always and forever banger

**endcreditouilles** (10): this has nothing to do with the song but i have the same blanket that they're lounging on in the mv around 0:19. Anyway, everything about this is a slay.

**PSSST12** (10): POP perfection. Zico deserves absolutely nothing but this song goes OFF.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is fun AF, but FUCK that break in the MV

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Olivia Hussey is a top 10 random name drop in K-Pop.

**runaway3212** (10): I love this movie

**Zypker125** (9.8): The best K-Pop song of 2014? Definitely a case of it. It’s just zany fun that’s constantly catchy and energetic throughout. Taeil should’ve gotten more high notes and ad-libs at the end though. And yeah, the color saturation in this MV is off the charts.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): god i love when kpop takes inspiration from that 60s go-go sound. stuff like this or CLC's Devil or Brown Eyed Girls Warm Hole just scratches an itch i forget i have

**Heedictated** (9.5): one of the best bridges in kpop and Zico's verse is amazing

**Jhe116** (9.4): P.O is so versatile except probably acting

**bigbigbee** (9): This song to me feels like the "good" side of the phrase "boys will be boys" - a little dumb but fun and earnest

**hasanella** (9): what can i say except iconic

**SlphWsp** (9): Fun and full of character, ft ostrich, did he just Nico Nico nii? Nice guitar

**foxinthenoodles** (8.5): A great bridge between older kpop and the current style of kpop. Zico is a legend on this track.

**sssaaage** (8.5): ended love yourself her

**BoneStreetSand** (8.1): Great and fun, but it’s no Nillilli Mambo.

**1998tweety** (8): cute bop

**DaBigBoi** (8): The chorus is a bit too stilted for my liking but otherwise a jam

**fadedblue09** (8): Those weird quacky noises are distracting but otherwise a nice surf rock tune

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Sounds a bit like it was made for a western cartoon but I dig it

**throwaway7650** (8): fun song, love it except for the weird effect after they say "her" in the chorus. trash members unfortunately [5] (golden phone zico)

**PRADA** (7.9): it’s good

**cherryices** (7.7): mm that’s a good instrumental. very fun MV

**seanderlust** (7.7): *michael bluth voice* her?

**HeartofDarkness123** (7.5): This is fun! Very upbeat and catchy. Nothing really comes to mind on how to describe it though.

**weappreciatepowers** (7.5): cute fun song

**bluetriangles04** (7): A fun and funky little bop, but because of that it lacks something in some parts of the song for me.

**cleopatroclus** (7): feels like the instrumentals were underutilised at points & would've liked a doubling down of the guitar but otherwise pretty fun

**snugsnhugs** (7): it's fun, it's catchy, has a silly dance, what more can you ask for

**suffocatedbears** (7): cute chorus

**agentofscranton** (6.5): wow she even had songs written about her in 2014? truly the greatest industry plant of our time

**celladonn** (6.5): Block B have several 10s in their discography (Very Good, Nillili Mambo, Jackpot) but this song has never really done it for me

**nyoom** (6.5): loses points for not being Toy or Jackpot and also making me watch zico say "zico zico ni". def not their best track but the choreo is iconic and i'm still gonna jam (except for zico's awkward too-long rap break that sounds like he's auctioning off olivia hussey). obligatory reminder that zico tattooed his mom's face onto his chest like some kind of weirdo chastity belt

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): The rest of the song bops but I don't like the chorus part where it's just "her" repeated

**Sedona83** (6.5): Insane rap



# Popheads users during the Grammys season 


**10footnotes** (6): It’s so funny to me that the 2017 Block B song in this rate sounds like it’s from 2014 and the 2014 song sounds like it’s from 2017. Chronologically confused kings.

**BebeLuigi** (6): It gives that Beatles/Elvis vibe to me? quite boppy

**bulforster** (6): This annoys me but is also a bop so

**cremeebrulee** (6): can someone please let me know if that ostrich is real

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Hmm.....interesting.

**grey/0x976** (6): zico made points.. but the chorus choreo is horrid.. the "killing part" more like youre killing me am i right :joy: :joy: :joy:

**jasannn** (6): I was about to make a "good 4 her" joke but i had to be honest with my score.

**jaskiwhere** (6): So I hated this song on my first listen but I came around to it and then loved it on my third listen HOWEVER the music video has this weird break in the middle that's annoying. And I will be taking off a point for that.

**specialtrickholdA** (6): Decent song but fuck Zico

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): this was cute

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): I like this song but at the same time it gets on my nerves lol

**useless-sheep** (4.8): this would’ve been an 7 maybe but wtf is that rap

**ebooks #5454** (1): they only get points for the cute ostrich in the M/V

**wavingwolves** (10): THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A DWARF AND A GIANT! I know this song isn't the best song in the world, or even the best in this list, but every time I listen to it I actually believe it is the best song to ever exist for the entirety of the 3:40 it lasts. The instrumental and that one synthline is just so remarkable? It's actually one of the catchiest moments of this whole rate. And that one dubstep breakdown is actually SO GOOD and it works so well with the song in a way that feels wrong. Ugh, this makes me go feral, that's just it, and I'm sad as hell that this isn't Day 3 if I'm honest. [KOREAN] JACKPOT! [KOREAN] SO WHAT???????!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): This was NU’EST’s debut song all the way back in 2012 and I guess one of the main producers was really into Eurovision at the time or something? It honestly sounds like a song Sweden could have sent in the early 2010s (shout out to Eric Saade’s Popular).

# Anti-bullying 

**bespectacIed** (10): ICONIC. Ultimate kpop underdog turn stars. Deserving.

**bigbigbee** (10): Did you know? Music got much worse after songs stopped mostly sounding like this. It's been proven by science!

**chenle** (10): it's insane how a song can age this badly but still be this good

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The Eurovision gays really need to listen to more k-pop as well.

**grey/0x976** (10): timeless

**liberalitea** (10): underrated debut song

**pat-rickstar** (10): This slaps and somehow makes me nostalgic even though I wouldn't have known what kpop is at the time

**PSSST12** (10): Aged horribly with that dubstep breakdown but this went OFF in 2012. That era of BAP EXO and NUEST in 2012 was so good.

**seanderlust** (10): *this and lucky by britney spears shaking on telling us what this is a story about*

**SlphWsp** (10): Forgot how amazing this song was, haven't watched it in so long, love the dance break and the ending pose. Can we bring back eyeliner and crazy hair pls?

**jaskiwhere** (9.5): JACKPOT SO WHAT

**throwaway7650** (9.5): another iconic debut... the random dubstep sends though

**Heedictated** (9.3): really strong chorus

**aestheticen** (9): One of my favourite K-pop debuts. Unfortunately I hate that instrumental during the bridge (which is very 2012) so one point off for that

**hikkaru** (9): they're in their early 10s edm bag... the dubstep breakdown yass

**Jhe116** (9): Most iconic boy group debut song sitting pretty next to Replay by Shinee

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): not the drop giving Hold It Against Me

**1998tweety** (8.5): MASSIVE bop

**celladonn** (8.5): This chorus goes off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): How the hell is NU'EST underrated? This is a fucking banger. They deserve better from their agency!

**hasanella** (8.5): nice but i feel like the drop could grow on me

**2dina3dworld** (8): bullying rate drops to zero, all signs point to Nu'est's 2012 bop "Face" inspiring students all over the world to bury the hatchet and live in peace.

**bluetriangles04** (8): Shrillex who?

**cremeebrulee** (8): god i miss the early 2010s

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i thought pop rap was the other way? I must be confused

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): I dunno how I feel about that weird EDM breakdown, but I’m pretty into this song. It sounds like the time it came from (2012) and I’m kind of into it.

**skargardin** (8): this is very early 10s and i LOVE it

**taeneon** (8): this sounds like something you'd hear on eurovision

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I thought this was a K-Pop rate, why am I listening to Europop? And why is there a weird electronic breakdown?

**orbiteezus** (7.5): nothing much to say but the rap verse at the end is hilarious

**weappreciatepowers** (7.5): ICONIC BREAKDOWN THEY WERE INSPIRED BY SLAYTEEZ

**cherryices** (7.2): just like davidandgoliath

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): the guy with the ponytail is giving me gender envy

**BoneStreetSand** (7): Bland and a bit dated, but definitely not the worst song on the list.

**emmach17** (7): This has big Eurovision energy

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Something feels so nostalgic about this song even though I only started listen to Kpop like two years ago lol

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): There's only two types of people in the world, those that know the ending rap to this and those that are uncultured. Funfact for the newer K-Pop fans around here that watched the video, some of the "extras" are actually members of Seventeen! (Well, future members at the time.)

**suffocatedbears** (7): it's cute

**throwawayforshady** (7): They're my ults, but I'm not the biggest fan of their debut

**useless-sheep** (7): an instrumental thing on this reminds me of something that would be in one of those dancing line phone games

**PRADA** (6.7): song snooze apart from the DUBSTEP DANCE BREAK YASS a serve

**moonagenightmares** (6.5): this kind of cheap gay eurovision music is somehow exactly what i expected of nuest


# Hey wassup LOSERS 


**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): breakdown ruined it for me

**Zypker125** (6.4): This is a song I’d like a lot more if the vocals were more diversified. Dongho legit sings 70% of the song and all the choruses by himself, and it makes the song lacking in flavor when you just hear Dongho’s vocals every time.

**10footnotes** (6): Cause when we bopping and cringing we binging—

**akanewasright** (6): I can’t decide if this is fun or derivative. This gets a hesitant ass throw from me. Also a mild one because the song isn’t thaaaaaat good anyway

**cleopatroclus** (6): from the robot like vocals to the instrumentals, this did not age well at all

**fadedblue09** (6): Sounds cheap and feels like a disservice to their talents (though this applies to a lot of their early stuff, really)

**foxinthenoodles** (6): It would've been a good song without that weird EDM drop in the middle that killed all of the momentum.

**TiltControls** (6): this mv is so overdramatic but I kind of love it? the song's fine not huge on the drop though

**BebeLuigi** (5): it is cute

**frogaranaman** (5): numa numa sounds different here

**nyoom** (5): this is objectively embarrassing but it's kinda catchy

**specialtrickholdA** (5): I love NU’EST but their early songs are soooooo dated. Stream Inside Out for clear skin.

**sssaaage** (5): this is actually so boring anyways stream FACE by certified f slur KEY of SHINee (featuring hit song IMAGINE)!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): some of their fashion choices here deserve to be bullied

**snugsnhugs** (4): v generic but I boosted a point because of “hey whats up loser”

**Sedona83** (3.5): Nothing stood out

**wavingwolves** (9.1): Mmm, yeah, this probably my favourite out of all of the tropical house songs that teorrized k-pop for all of these years, since I hate most of them. There's just something so enticing about this that I can't explain, and Really Really Really Reaaaaalyyyyy was one of my most listened songs in 2017 and one of my many many SOTYs from that year, since it was my favourite year for k-pop. BUT ALSO, I really wish it was Sentimental here instead. I'm very sorry, but I'm not over that!!!!!!! SEUNGYOON, YOU'LL NEVER BE TAEHYUN. Okay, I'm done now.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): That Gaga meme with “talented, spectacular, brilliant, show-stopping etc etc”...the opposite of that is me @ this song. Like BIGBANG’S Fxxk It, it just gets worse with every listen for me. I hated it in 2017 and I hate it now. I guess I sorta understand the appeal and therefore why it’s still their most successful song but like...why. Sentimental is so much better!

---

# Really!!!!!!


**2dina3dworld** (10): Really really, this was an 11 contender. But it came down to the amount of listens I had, and Cherry Bomb won out in that regard.

**liberalitea** (10): peak of trop-pop

**PSSST12** (10): A BOP and a half. Winner's best song.

**runaway3212** (10): Honestly this is amazing, I love it

**SlphWsp** (10): One of the greats, what a smooth full sound, feels like floating, most joyful black and white mv ever?

**snugsnhugs** (10): I LOVE this song. It never fails to put me in a good mood and make me want to dance

**Zypker125** (10): Dreamcatcher’s cover of this song is the superior version, but the OG is still a 10/10. It’s catchy, simple yet sweet, flows very well, and utilizes its chill atmosphere well.

**Heedictated** (9.9): I really love the lyrics for how direct but sweet it is and the song really really grew on me a lot

**ebooks #5454** (9.5): weird dance, nice song

**elleyonce** (9): Reallyreallyreallyreallyyyyyyy

**foxinthenoodles** (9): Just a straight-up bop with a fantastic hook and amazing chorus.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): I feel like my thoughts change on this song a lot but overall it’s just so catchy I can’t not like it

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The way this sounds like a perfect closer for an album and it's the closer of the rate (at least in the order you rate them, I doubt it's winning)

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Well-executed tropical house track. Also the lyrics are cute!

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I know tropical house is tired by now, but this is one of the pinnacles of the genre to meeeeee

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): Point and laugh

**throwaway7650** (8.5): I love this chorus/drop, idc. NEOL JOAHAE!

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**aestheticen** (8): They really peaked with this song

**BoneStreetSand** (8): Oh wow more girls doing choreo in a boy band song. The dance is a little racy. Such a surprise. They kinda stole the show. Regardless, song sounds fun.

**hikkaru** (8): they're in their youtube tutorial bag

**hunnybee12** (8): I’ve watched the (superior) twice cover so many times I keep getting thrown off when a man starts singing

**skargardin** (8): instant serotonin i do think

**hasanella** (7.5): yep it is really really okay imo

**HeartofDarkness123** (7.5): Pretty fun song! It sparks serotonin and I generally enjoy listening to it.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): do I like a tropical house song in 2021? maybe


# Really?????????????????


**suffocatedbears** (7): itz a cute bop but idk why it was such a big hit

**TiltControls** (7): its really really alright


**jaskiwhere** (6.8): I have a feeling this is a Seungyoon-led song, and of WINNER's composers, Seungyoon tends to be the most hit-or-miss for me because his songs tend to be on the more manufactured-for-the-public side. Case in point here unfortunately :/, though I do enjoy a lot of their other title songs!


**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): I was today's years old when I learned Dave Meyers (yes, *that* guy) directed this video. But, once more, Winner really still don't super do it for me. I mean this is better than Sentimental but still eh.

**seanderlust** (6.1): the phrase "really really" makes me think of shrek saying "really really" to donkey in the first movie. anyways this is mid

**BebeLuigi** (6): I don't like it much but it just sticks to your mind if you listen to it, it's really catchy

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): eh

**nyoom** (5.1): nothing tropical house is gonna get under a 5 from me. obligatory reminder that tablo of epik high introduced kang seungyoon to his daughter haru (perfect, adorable, iconic) with the line, "a handsome oppa is here" and she deadass looked ksy straight in the eye and said "where?" and that got broadcast nationally: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsr5bgl2SpQ

**useless-sheep** (5): boring chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i think we’re just past the point where tropical house is necessary

**PRADA** (4): aged and overrated

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this was really really boring

**weappreciatepowers** (4): horrid drop

**Sedona83** (3.5): Ambles along, not terrible

**grey/0x976** (3): this song so mid its actually kinda crazy

**ImADudeDuh** (3): oh their name is gonna be ironic after day 1

**bespectacIed** (2): annoying hook. yg boy  groups have a knack for making these basic annoying songs be MEGAHITS on korea, idk how knetz eat these up

**rickikardashian** (2): this is the music that plays on every trendy cryptocurrency app youtube ad

**moonagenightmares** (1): yg bgs really fell off huh

**sssaaage** (1): this is actually so bad like.. exactly the type of song i hate, i almost gave this my 0

**wavingwolves** (8.3): SOOOO EASYYYYY TO LOVEEEEE YOU!!!! I literally dreamed of this song at least three different times in the last month. This feels like a very simple, even kind of bland, song, but the energy in it makes it feel a lot more magnetic than it should be. Vocals are really good too and just make the song better. Astro as a group might be kind of massively underrated, but they shine bright in this.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): I have listened to this song so many times but I am still truly No Thoughts Head Empty. It’s a perfectly inoffensive song, I guess? There is absolutely nothing outstanding to comment on, it’s just….there. I have yet to find an ASTRO song that I even moderately like (the Moonbin and Sanha subunit was cute though).

**agentofscranton** (11): it won’t win - if anything it’ll drop out like early day two at best because nobody cares about astro - but i’ll be damned if i didn’t give my boys their due, and i’m sure the chaser, call me baby, and view will do just *fine* without my 11. anyways, this song is genuinely pop perfection from beginning to end, sanha and mj sound divine, and the music video is fantastic - astro STAY being the most underrated bg in the game. stream ONE!

**BebeLuigi** (11): I followed Astro since their pre-debut so I have a special fondness for them but I didn't really stan their music much until Crazy Sexy Cool came around. It is, imo, one of the best, if not the best, kpop songs around, it really took Astro's softer and cute concepts to a more mature direction without taking away what make other Astro songs before this and the result is absolutely amazing, not only is it great but it's also addictive and quite original for a kpop boy group single. All in all Stan Astro.

**dekubaku** (10): I liked how soft and fluffy it sounds. Not a sound I would attach to a song titled 'Crazy Sexy Cool' but it works. Plus, Cha Eunwoo? I heard about him and saw a few pics but seeing him here, I have to admit that his visuals are god-tier level! Edit - I keep coming back to this song.

**fadedblue09** (10): All Night is their magnum opus IMO but this is also a solid pick. It's the perfect bridge between their cutesy old sound and their more mature, charismatic side.

**jaskiwhere** (10): It was absolute whiplash going from ADTOY vibes to this music video but ABSOLUTE 10/10 song, astronomically great, love how cute and happy this is

**liberalitea** (10): cha eunwoo is the most beautiful man in the world and i want him to rail me

**nctdreamsqd** (10): JinJin & Rocky rap sections really elevate the song for me

**nyoom** (10): i originally gave this a 7.5 but then i put it on coasting down the highway on a bright sunny day blue sky white clouds cha eunwoo crooning in my ear and it was fucking beautiful. then my mom farted really loudly but besides that, yeah that's good shit

**seanderlust** (10): the breezy instrumentals, the sweet lyrics...easy 10

**throwaway7650** (10): I did not have this song as a 10 initially (even though I like it, I think I gave it like an 8 to start with) but the more I listened the higher the score got, all the way to a 10. SO EASY TO LOVE YA! #eunboo

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): this is a BOP

**hasanella** (9.5): this song is the embodiment of warm fuzzies

**pleasegivemeasword** (9.5): I only know like two other Astro songs so I didn’t know what to expect but I really loved this!

**throwawayforshady** (9.5): Peak Astro comeback

**bulforster** (9.3): This has a really easy, deep groove to it.

**bespectacIed** (9): good song choice for cha eunwoo and friends, very adorable

**grey/0x976** (9): EUNBOOS GET UP AND SHAKE UR ASS RIGHT NOW.

**HeartofDarkness123** (9): I love this bass. Instantly made me a fan. It's a relaxed but pleasant vibe. It's a nice refreshing summer song, which is nice, since I usually don't like "summer" kpop. The rap though........ kpop will severely improve when groups no longer *need* to have a rap part.

**hikkaru** (9): crazy sexy.. COOL!

**SlphWsp** (9): Funky feelgood but still wistful, refreshing rap and great freestyle dance moment

**specialtrickholdA** (9): A great departure from their cute image with this breezy, sexy bop.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Just a really chill bop

**TiltControls** (9): wait did they just get narnia'd into some random industrial complex? whatever. it's a bop

**cherryices** (8.8): really enjoyable, and nice choreo in the MV

**BoneStreetSand** (8.6): So cute, one going straight to my playlist. I could play this on loop.

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): I LOVE YOU SO MUCH EUNWOO MARRY ME PICK ME

**DaBigBoi** (8): Eunwoo getting hit by [REDACTED] in True Beauty. I’m levitating

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This MV is basically why I like this new current generation of boy bands the most compared to the previous generations. It's an MV that shows a cute side to them without having it emasculating them.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is cute

**skargardin** (8): by far the best astro title of those i've heard i fear

**snugsnhugs** (8): solid groove, not the most exciting song ever but i like it much more than i thought i would

**Heedictated** (7.4): pretty smooth but could do with a more fun chorus

**cleopatroclus** (7.1): some of the instrumentals, esp the guitar, are kinda fun but otherwise bit of a snooze

**ebooks #5454** (7): noice dance moves!!; the title is too scandy for the sweet vibes of this tho

**hyphen-happy** (7): how to do a bright concept thats not just pastels

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): I liked the verses but wanted more from the chorus. A chill bop anyway.


# Sane Undesirable Warm


**PRADA** (6.7): bop but eunwoo is STIFF

**Zypker125** (6.6): Some makings of an engaging song, but it’s just too low-fi and chill to be truly catchy. I’d prefer a more energetic, fun vibe, as opposed to the calm falsettos that we got.

**suffocatedbears** (6.5): chorus is nice but the verses are kinda bland; eunwoo handsome king

**cremeebrulee** (6): with this title i did not think this would sound as cutesy as it does

**gabcac** (6): sorry but i think it's unnecessary long

**galaxy\_rae** (6): Not my vibe but good for them!!

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): It's come to my attention I only know ASTRO as "That group everyone said sounded like SHINee." I put that in past tense because it was more directed towards their debut sound, can't say if that still rings true now. You know that this reminds me of so far? Infinite H's 'Pretty' or at least like the verses. They lose me with the chorus tho, it feels like it kinda goes nowhere...

**10footnotes** (5): It’s weird how Astro’s logo looks like the Star of David lmao. Anyway this is a decent little bop, not incredible but gets the job done.

**foxinthenoodles** (5): A little flat but it's overall inoffensive chill kpop.

**moonagenightmares** (5): kinda basic innit

**sssaaage** (5): this song is actually so mediocre like i genuinely dont have any thoughts on it it just... exists

**2dina3dworld** (4): it’s not easy to figure out if this works or not. If Astro can be divided into pre-Crazy Sexy Cool, and post-Crazy Sexy Cool, this song lacks the energy of the pre-CSC title tracks, and lacks the dramatic flair of the post-CSC title tracks

**taeneon** (4): boring

**Sedona83** (3): Boring, didn't go anywhere


# Don't go chasing waterfalls... 

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh wow, maybe you should go chasing waterfalls

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): TLC's impact

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): this is so groovy and it'll probably enter my summer rotation tbh. tlc was a little scared when this dropped

**1998tweety** (8): I love TLC

**CrimsonROSET** (8): do i listen to this song six more times to figure out an actual quirky comment about it or do i merely go to tlc/drag race

**frogaranaman** (7): TLC sounds different here

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): [insert TLC comment]

**elleyonce** (5): just for the TLC reference in the title.


# You're not wrong 

**runaway3212** (9): we love an ode to our rate hosts

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): A better song than Spellbound and I think those little vocal “ooh ooh ooh”s are really catchy. Also I appreciate how they still a) serve good music unlike some of their same-age peers and b) are still together! Well, not completely, but at least Changmin and Yunho are still active and making music together which is more than I can say for a lot of older groups.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): Someone's favourite hags who are still serving! From the two songs we have in the rate I massively prefer this one and I might have underrated this a bit too. It's just real catchy and has a lot of very fun parts. UH UH UH UH UUUUHHHH!

---


# Hag lovers [2] 


**aestheticen** (10): It's all right! It's ok!

**moonagenightmares** (10): i wanted to tank the tvxq songs because i was bitter keep your head down didn’t make it in but they’re too good. fuck

**rotating3Dtext** (10): the chorus’ percussion kinda sounds like cumbia??

**sssaaage** (10): my favorite hags still serving ❤ suju cant relate

**Heedictated** (9.4): it should be illegal for Changmin to look so handsome

**bespectacIed** (9): Changmin oh lorde.... irene isn't the original visual sry reveluvs

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): guess i need to check these ancient queens out because this is so good

**grey/0x976** (9): ... SLAYS DOWN OMFG.

**hasanella** (9): god it is a shame i have not heard this song before it sounds so good

**SlphWsp** (9): Groovy and catchy melody, hits just right, they exude enough charisma to easily fill the stage with just two

**TiltControls** (9): this song just sounds so smooth

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): I was distracted by tumblr au drama when I rated this lemme revisit

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): Now why did my lil dumbass self never check this out until now. This is what I get for becoming a mostly girl groups stan I guess. Tho to be far to myself this was from 2018 which was a very rough year for me with K-Pop due to uhhhhh reasons (If you know my fandoms you can probably put 2 and 2 together as to why...) But yeah this slaps.

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): a cool bop, and much better than spellbound

**cherryices** (8.4): when was anyone going to tell me that TVXQ and DBSK are the same group

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i dont know, it just works? Does it even work? I’m not sure this works

**frogaranaman** (8): wow this is a fun one

**Jhe116** (8): The pre-chorus is gold

**throwaway7650** (8): I think this song was my introduction to TVXQ! actually, but I wish I didn't understand english for the outro. we love a soloist!

**BoneStreetSand** (7.7): Do these guys always have girls doing choreo in their music videos or just in the two chosen for the rate? I don’t see many boy groups do this.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): it’s got a chance at winning a spot in my heart

**seanderlust** (7.5): recent maroon 5 but make it korean and fun to listen to

**BebeLuigi** (7): it's a cute song

**ebooks #5454** (7): the ladies keep stealing the show omg

**fadedblue09** (7): A bit weaker because of some awkward lyrics but I can see this growing on me

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): Much catchier than the last song.

**ieatbe** (7): I was gonna give this a 6 but then I remember Minseok promoting this.. https://twitter.com/shumin/status/1181223371318669313

**PRADA** (7): it’s good


# Ageists [2]

**PSSST12** (7): Cute but kinda forgettable. Their songs for this rate doesn't give them justice 😭😭

**weappreciatepowers** (7): not going insane with this, yall are just lee sooman stans

**Zypker125** (6.5): This song is just a solid 6.5, pretty decent throughout, but also never catchy or memorable enough to stand out to me musically. The vocals are good as always, but the song feels weirdly muted/empty, which I think was a mistake.

**foxinthenoodles** (6): Not exciting, but perfectly listenable.

**Sedona83** (5.5): Catchy but didn't like chorus

**nyoom** (5): thank you for the invitation to this circus

**RandomHypnotica** (5): my score is my irl chance or finding love hahahaha

**snugsnhugs** (5): its okay, I wouldn’t turn it off it was playing in the background, but im not putting it on any of my playlists

**wavingwolves** (10): I actually really love this song and it features one of my favourite choreographies of all time. It's both technically difficult to some extent and also really enjoyable to learn. MFAL is one of these songs that once you get to see the performance it makes it *that* much better, since it just makes you fully see the song as physically flashed out piece. If only this was actually their last song, since everything that came after this was very much not my cup of tea, to say the least...

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): A controversial opinion but...this is my least favourite NCT song in the rate? It’s still good but I just find the other two more appealing. However, I will say this song works really well for the cute concept NCT Dream had going on earlier in their career!

---

# My first 🥰

**nctdreamsqd** (11): This will always be my favorite title track from them

**universemates** (11): Iconic milf anthem and the first installment of NCT Dream's first love trilogy. Refreshing melody, cute lyrics, and fun choreography, this song is a fan favorite for a reason. The Dreamies are the embodiment of youth and friendship to me, the fact that they would hold hands before every performance of MFAL to measure their distance just makes the song even more precious (Also they just released an album full of summery bops and bittersweet tunes called Hello Future, check it out).

**bobaroma** (10): funk done right!

**chenle** (10): pop perfection. almost gave this my 11 tbh

**fadedblue09** (10): Aww this gives me fuzzy feels! Very simple yet sweet. Also, damn, the vocal excellence at such a young age.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i feel like I’m in a romcom montage 🥰🥰🥰

**milkywayinradius** (10): i love how cute this song and mv is.

**moonagenightmares** (10): would’ve given this an 11 if the song that got me into kpop wasnt in the rate, pure serotonin i actually cried to it once A+ would recommend

**PSSST12** (10): We young is still to this day, my fave nct dream song but this is still absolutely gorgeous. That choreo where they lay sideways on the floor to form a star is a CULTURAL RESET. legends only.

**throwaway7650** (10): was not expecting to give this song a high score at all, let alone a 10. however, the more I listened to it, I realized I couldn't not give this a 10. really hope this isn't the first NCT song out :woeis:

**TiltControls** (10): Why does this remind me of HSM music. Anyways its a bop!

**celladonn** (9.5): So bright and joyous. The instrumental is so good

**akanewasright** (9): This is so fun oh my god. One point off because the video is kinda…. Uhhhhh… but even that’s aesthetically nice, like fucking gorgeous colors and shit. Just…. Anyway I don’t perceive I just think this is neat.

**grey/0x976** (9): idk lemme throw in some generic comment omg yassss mark looks so cute uwu fluffbear honey bunches of oats here it makes me feel so smol bean or whatever

**jasannn** (9): I wish they would go back to this sound instead of the mess that was Hot Sauce.

**Leixander** (9): my imaginary wig was snatched in the very first second (wish the chorus went harder than it did though)

**SlphWsp** (9): Fun and funky, cute if questionable mv premise, difficult choreo

**thedoctordances1940** (9): It just has this nostalgic feel to it that I absolutely love.

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): may be the best Dream song yet. Haechan is perfect here.

**Zypker125** (9): This is just bubblegum-pop at its finest. The vocals in this song are great and the choruses are super catchy. However, the bridge where they force in talk-sing parts to give Jeno/Jisung parts sounds awful and ruins part of the song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): okay that one recurring galloping synth in the background is so hypnotic

**hikkaru** (8.5): cute

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): this song is definitely a grower, and that choreo is a slay

**1998tweety** (8): cute summer bop

**bespectacIed** (8): fun

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The song is easily a bop. Not sure about the "students hot for a teacher" concept in the music video though. 🤔

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Youthful, energetic and sounds like they sang while smiling.

**Jhe116** (8): Relationship between student and teacher is against my personal belief

**rickikardashian** (8): this video is the most 2012 thing to be released in 2017

**snugsnhugs** (8): actually really dig this song, its cute and unique and fun!

**10footnotes** (7.5): I wasn’t expecting to, like, give NCT any good scores at all, but this is fun!

**hasanella** (7): this is pretty good and well hello again mark

**jaskiwhere** (7): i didn't realize we were including kidz bop in this rate

**lonelyglory** (7): Man I wish they stuck with this sound for NCT Dream longer

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): I always wrote off the Dream unit because to me they were the unit that made music for an audience younger than me. (TBF I was around for their debut with 'Chewing Gum' and it made me feel so fucking old.) But this is... not bad tbh. Also the choreography for this is solid. Quite a fun song, maybe I should stop writing off Dream.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): my first and last time listening to this outside of the reveal

**weappreciatepowers** (6.5): mid and could be higher but its nct dream

**BebeLuigi** (6): a cute bop

**CrimsonROSET** (6): inoffensive (derogatory)

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): I usually love songs like this but for some reason I can’t get into it as much as their other songs

**runaway3212** (6): somewhat sweet

**PRADA** (5.9): aged wtf it used to be so good

**aestheticen** (5): This lacks personality

**ebooks #5454** (5): fun!

**nyoom** (4.5): everyone's first love is their "last first love," you ain't special bitch. quit sexualizing your teacher

**HeartofDarkness123** (4): In one ear, out the other.

**sssaaage** (4): glad this was the last (it wasnt bc they made we young but we can pretend)

**BoneStreetSand** (3): Video made me uncomfortable, and the song bored me to death. Sorry.

**Sedona83** (3): Forgettable love song

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Amazing song and MV...what else is there to say. The whole Focus album is great too and I’m glad we were at least able to get this kind of sound out of one K-pop group.

**wavingwolves** (10): THIS IS THE ONE THING THAT MAKES ME THE MOST MAD ABOUT THIS RATE. This deserved to get AT LEAST #2 and it just being #5 is an actual tragedy. You can't tell me any of the EXO projects in are better than this, you just can't. Anyway... lemme introduce these boys. JUS2 is a subunit from GOT7, and a very surprising one at that. Still, both memberes in it, Jaebeom and Yugyeom, are very influenced by R&B and house, so this kind of sound feels very fitting for them and it makes sense they did it together. Focus on me was written and produced by both of them and so were all the b-sides in the mini album that accompanies it, that is also excellent.

---

**aestheticen** (10): I am focusing respectfully

**agentofscranton** (10): just fuck a zombie

**BebeLuigi** (10): this is so good I never got really into Got7 but I looped that ep a lot, Focus On Me especially is incredible

**bluetriangles04** (10): This is such a great song, along with a solid mini and I fucking hate JYPE but I think god everyday they gave us this subunit along with a JJP comeback.

**BoneStreetSand** (10): Best song and best video in the entire rate. Iconic.

**DaBigBoi** (10): Babymaking, etc.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I would give this an 11 if I could. They sound great and the MV is SO cool. Hoping for a JUS2 reunion soon

**fadedblue09** (10): This takes me to a parallel universe every time

**grey/0x976** (10): probably one of the best songs ever made in this history of recorded and unrecorded music #SORRY BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY you just couldnt do it anymore

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): Another sensual bop. I love its confidence. The chorus is absolutely beautiful with the soft vocals followed by the deep robot voice and the pulsating synths.

**hyphen-happy** (10): issa bop

**milkywayinradius** (10): the mv is so visually interesting and the song is good too.

**seanderlust** (10): if this were in the main rate this would be my 11 and it wouldn't even be particularly close

**skargardin** (10): if this doesnt win the bonus rate we WILL riot

**SlphWsp** (10): Great subunit, ethereally beautiful sound and mv, masterful work on the choreo and editing, floating in space

**sssaaage** (10): the best song in this rate, my fav kpop song, and MAYBE my fav song ever.... literally a perfect song to me. tbh i could ramble about everything i love about this song for so long but i wont. jb + yugyeoms voices are perfect together and the instrumental (especially the bridge with the guitar omfg........) is amazing. this would easily be my 11 in the main rate

**throwaway7650** (10): sooo good. an 11 contender if it was in the main rate. even if I'm not the biggest fan of yugyeom's voice jus2 did what they had to do here #WELOVEYOUJB [2]

**throwawayforshady** (10): The most chill-sexy song ever written

**weappreciatepowers** (10): HOLY SHIT.

**1998tweety** (9.5): i didnt care for this at first but it grew a LOT on me

**TiltControls** (9): F-f-focus on me

**foxinthenoodles** (8.5): Hypnotizing music with a great chorus.

**Heedictated** (8.2): good background music

**snugsnhugs** (8): so interesting and cool. Not the most exciting song ever but perfect for a good weekend smoke sesh

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): loved it.

**Zypker125** (3.7): MV is a 10/10, but the song is just pretty boring. The chorus is too low-energy and lacks memorability.

**Sedona83** (2): Just not my style

**wavingwolves** (10): NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! This actually makes me so sad. I love this song, I think it's one of the most captivating songs in this list. My favourite part of it is actually Minhyuk's rap right before the second chorus, for some reason that section of the song always makes me happy, probably because it just sounds good to my ears since I actually almost never remember the lyrics of any k-pop song. In any case, BTOB also feels like deserved better, but I'm still happy they were at least able to crack top 30.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): I don’t think this song is mindblowing or anything, but I think it’s very good for what it is - just a fun song to bop to. It’s also very much a grower imo

---


# Has a letterboxd account 


**bobaroma** (10): btob doing dance pop hits different than ballad. Sorry not sorry

**bulforster** (10): Shoutout to the piano that's a bit buried in the mix but is what really put this over the top for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): omg that synth in the chorus that's like vaguely horn-like im in love w this

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok bop!

**grey/0x976** (10): this kind of an ultimate slay.. btob main pop boys?

**hikkaru** (10): life's a bitch but mine's a movie

**nyoom** (10): From there Peniel went up from thence unto YouTube: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little antis out of Instiz, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the STAN. And there came forth two sasaengs out of the wood, and tare forty and two antis of them. // this one really grew on me, it's just fun and groovy and makes you feel kinda smooth and cool and playful and also why didn't anyone tell me how cute lee minhyuk is?

**skargardin** (10): I hear funky retro throwback sound - I become obsessed

**sssaaage** (10): i knew this would be a 10 from the intro alone

**ebooks #5454** (9.8): the wardrobe for this one is absolutely divine i want all their outfits also this song is quite good too!!

**aestheticen** (9.5): Peniel's rap in this song is so good

**agentofscranton** (9.5): idk why i was shocked that sungjae had a great voice as if i didn’t already know he was in a bg before he was an actor

**hasanella** (9.5): this came for my heart so hard god BTOB i think im sold

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): wow the new suicide squad movie looks so good

**1998tweety** (9): this is excellent oh wow

**fadedblue09** (9): I remember reading some comment saying BTOB was like a male counterpart to Mamamoo, and I think this song encapsulates that well.

**seanderlust** (9): "You should be careful of women no matter whether they're awake or asleep" - we're in our gamergate era I see. otherwise this is a bop

**Sedona83** (9): Fun song, replayed

**SlphWsp** (9): More excellent pop melodies, great rap too, this is the good stuff

**throwaway7650** (9): cannot take peniel's english rap seriously but bop otherwise

**TiltControls** (9): this is really slick

**PRADA** (8.9): bop and i’m sure it will grow on me in the future too

**nctdreamsqd** (8.5): I love the jazz elements in this song

**BoneStreetSand** (8.1): This should be in a skateboarding game.

**chenle** (8): idgaf, peniel's verse slaps

**Heedictated** (8): smooth jam

**hunnybee12** (8): the english rap took this down a whole point. peniel pack it up

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I’m bopping but the auto tune at parts on that one guys voice was unnecessary

**PSSST12** (8): This is quite fun actually.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): oooh i love the jazzy piano

**runaway3212** (8): Kinda banger

**useless-sheep** (8): not exactly the definition of the word masterpiece but good i guess

**weappreciatepowers** (8): a bop

**suffocatedbears** (7.5): this song feels like a better fit for btob than wow

**liberalitea** (7.3): what is Peniel's rap

**2dina3dworld** (7): so I used to be an avid consumer of those “fan-voted charts” videos, and around the time “Movie” came out, it convinced me that I shouldn’t listen to Movie because I found the chorus a bit silly. But, listening to this for the rate, I realised that the chorus is still below-average, but the rest of the song is above average, and I missed out.

**BebeLuigi** (7): cute concept

**bluetriangles04** (7): This song is very silky and sweet, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would with the elements of that drum kick and the piano kind of bulking over each other.

**cleopatroclus** (7): liked the funk elements but wish they'd doubled down on it, feels too long also

**CrimsonROSET** (7): love is like a movie: i’d rather not go out of my way to experience it

**foxinthenoodles** (7): Flat until the rap kicks in then it becomes very cool.

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): Wasn’t a standout but I enjoyed it and I would play it for myself.

**jaskiwhere** (7): Aww the video for this was cute! Lowkey this song would've been better without Peniel's rap but also 2nd gen/early 3rd gen pioneered cringe lyrics

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): This is the BTOB I’m familiar with hahaha I like the song a lot

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): I have absolutely no memory of this song but Ilhoon is on his Joker shit (I mean like Jared Leto joker unfortunately) in the video so... that's a thing...

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): it should have everything for me to love it but I don't, still a good song though

# Hasn't seen a movie since Breaking Dawn Pt. II


**cherryices** (6.8): perfectly fine but missing *something* for me

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): that autotune part was awful, the rest of the song is fine but forgettable

**snugsnhugs** (6): i like funky songs, don't like the autotune, love peniel's rap

**frogaranaman** (5): “my life is like a movie” yeah bro Ice Age and you’re the baby everyone hates

**galaxy\_rae** (5): wasn't that bad??

**hyphen-happy** (5): btob i love u i promise these songs are just not it

**Zypker125** (4.4): Man, this song is just so underwhelming. They’ve got great vocalists yet barely use any of them, only using Eunkwang’s runs to redeem some of the song. The rap is…. okay (still not feeling Peniel’s English raps).

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): One of TBZ’s signature cute songs before they started going down the darker route with their concepts, this has always been a favourite of mine. Sunwoo served so much here btw, I said what I said. I feel like day 2 is an appropriate placement for this though.

**wavingwolves** (5): While I prefer this over their recent diet-EXO output, it still misses the mark for this and it feels a litte too bland. It's kind of the most mid song I've ever heard and every time I listen to it I just feel like I have no thoughts on it whatsoever. That said, The Boyz actually seem to be one of the most fun groups to follow, and I wish them better songs in their future.

---


# The Gayz


**throwaway7650** (11): this song was a revelation the first time I heard it. before 2020, I mostly ignored the boyz (the group name :grinny: + the fact that their debut song being called "boy" didn't help, although now I know it's actually good) and just watched D.D.D juyeon fancams. then road to kingdom happened. I didn't plan on following the show or them at all but I watched a youtuber react to some performances and I was completely captivated by their cover of taemin's danger - go stream the original too btw! one of the first songs I checked out afterwards was giddy up. I could not believe I slept on this song for so long (in fact I'm not sure if I even checked it out when it was released back in 2018). the boyz are considered diet EXO in some ways and I personally consider this song diet love me right (both are 10s but the original is always better :mischief:), both were ahead of their time with a retro vibe, they're both so fun with iconic raps, yes this one time I'll tolerate sehun. anyway I really hope this song can make it to day 3 but at the very least the top half of the rate. ANTICIPATE THE BOYZ COMEBACK IN AUGUST 2021!

**1998tweety** (10): pop perfection, one of the best new boy groups

**bespectacIed** (10): We don't say LGBTQ, we say "i stan ggs + tbz." I wish there were more tbz songs here, their discog is solid and I wanna talk more about Juyeon being the kpop industry's main visual

**bobaroma** (10): This is a full certified bop!

**celladonn** (10): A joyous bop, and I love the video

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that bouncy bass... the melody... the buildup in the prechorus... now i get why some people call them The Gayz the excellence is just too much

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok we need the one more - sg lewis ft nile rodgers mashup w this

**DaBigBoi** (10): yeehaw

**elleyonce** (10): My faves and one of their best title tracks. The rap is one of the best parts of this thing!!

**grey/0x976** (10): i miss when they made gay music my baby boy Q is trapped in this eboy hellhole

**hikkaru** (10): the breakdown .. yass pills popped

**moonagenightmares** (10): anticipate tbz summer comeback yass

**rickikardashian** (10): slayed tricked elemonated pop off queen

**suffocatedbears** (10): this song deserves to be more popular, and that mv is so creative

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): love The Boyz and this is a bop. If this was The Stealer it would have my 11

**akanewasright** (9): This is really fun actually

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Omg no wonder why my classmates love this group.

**hyphen-happy** (9): bright tbz please come back to meee

**seanderlust** (9): I love the background funky guitar!

**SlphWsp** (9): Cute fun and ubpeat, groovy, hilarious and amazing choreo, creative with the pinball set, doesn't take itself too seriously

**ebooks #5454** (8.7): i like the pinball vibes

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): friendly reminder that Blanco Brown - The Git Up outpeaked David Bowie - Space Oddity

**nyoom** (8.5): see, more of this. more cute, less edge! i'm sick of all this edge!

**PRADA** (8.5): GREW wtf

**sssaaage** (8.5): SLAYED TRICKED ELEMONATED POP OFF QUEEN

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): Who are these cuties and why haven’t I heard of them before? Very fun song. When they grow up will they go from Boyz to Men?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): are you comparing me to a horse mister

**snugsnhugs** (8): im such a sucker for funky songs and this hits the mark!

**TiltControls** (8): love the pinball aesthetics! also a fun song too!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): cute

**fadedblue09** (7.5): This is a cute bop (albeit with generic carpe diem lyrics), though I was expecting a more cowboy-ish concept.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Hearing the phrase “giddy up” in a non-country context feels very wrong

**bear\_horse\_stork** (7): same deal as Suju

**frogaranaman** (7): yeehaw

**galaxy\_rae** (7): songs not really my vibe but i love the video. Pin ball machine realness!

**jaskiwhere** (7): This is actually pretty catchy and the music video was cute! vibing for sure

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Didn’t expect a song called Giddy Up to sound this good

**Sedona83** (7): Catchy and fun

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): pretty catchy


# The Fadz 



**weappreciatepowers** (7): this is nawt that good

**Leixander** (6.5): never use eeny meeny miny moe in songs!

**Zypker125** (6.4): It’s just okay overall. The problem is that I don’t like the melodic choice in the chorus of the “go run, run, run” part, it didn’t capitalize on the high energy of the chorus. The falsettos also didn’t match with the vibe of the song. Sunwoo no-cap has the best raps in all of K-Pop, though, and his bridge was absolute fire and redeemed a lot of the song.

**bluetriangles04** (6): I wanted to like this a lot more, and I enjoy the verses but the song is more mid than anything for me sadly.

**HeartofDarkness123** (6): Pretty generally pleasant. I get why people like them. It doesn’t stand out to me at all though.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): I read 'Giddy Up' and expected a cowboy bop... My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. But at least the song wasn't like... too too bad.

**skargardin** (6): this didnt really stick with me idk

**liberalitea** (5.7): they have a member (Kevin) and he is the epitome of popheads. he literally got chromatica oreos shipped from overseas to korea like

**10footnotes** (5): It’s fine but feels pretty derivative of, like, every fun 3rd gen bg concept ever?

**BebeLuigi** (5): another group I really like with a track I don't care for... I wish it was No Air

**foxinthenoodles** (5): Messy with lots of questionable production decisions. However, there's a spark of something that makes me want to listen anyway.

**wavingwolves** (9.2): INFINITE never fails to serve pop perfection, it's the absolute truth. I LOVE the intro, pre-chorus and chorus of this SO MUCH, I can't even put into words. It's just one of the most earworm-y songs I've ever heard. The strings, piano, harmonies + the on-going beat with the vocal effects and little eletrocnic quirks... God, this song is just a full package of being quirky, catchy and just remarkably amazing. Every second feels epic.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): The only thing that stops this from being a 10 is I find the chorus gets kinda repetitive after a while but other than that it’s a massive bop. We need more strings in K-pop </3

---


# Good

**HeartofDarkness123** (11): I LOVE these strings. This prechorus gets me going so hard. The chorus is extra catchy. I’ve heard it before and it’s an earworm. The 1-2 punch of the prechorus and chorus is so good. I gave it the 11 since how much I liked it came out of nowhere for me, compared to the songs I’m just already fond of.

**bluetriangles04** (10): One of the first K-Pop songs I bought with my own money on iTunes. I remember trying to find more K-Pop songs that utilized strings and orchestral sounds like this one did because I really loved it.

**elleyonce** (10): Just a perfect representation of everything Infinite was about to me. The Chaser has the video, but this has the concept, the foreboding, and drama that doesn't threaten to pierce your eardrums.

**hikkaru** (10): good

**hyphen-happy** (10): just iconic

**jaskiwhere** (10): Infinite make a bad song challenge! I did feel bad giving one group two 10s but I genuinely feel these two songs deserve it, these are some absolute top tier songs in their stellar discography (also I love violins LOL)

**moonagenightmares** (10): *distorted voice* oh man i love this song

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): So this was my first Infinite comeback (and also my second 10 for these guys) and honestly, this one also still goes hard as fuck. Like maybe I'm just a sucker for a good strings and piano driven song that goes into some weird electronic breakdown but like... ughhhhh this also hits all the right marks for me. Genuinely suggest to those that liked this and 'The Chaser' to listen to the rest of their titles because they rarely miss in that department. (I say rarely because Last Romeo and Paradise never quite did it for me) Side note no one really cares about, this has a 360 video that you can watch in VR because that was a thing some K-Pop artists did for a small bit in 2015.

**runaway3212** (10): haha im making a joke with this song's name, I know, im very original

**suffocatedbears** (10): this song sounds as epic as the first time I heard it, and i still find myself looking it up every now and then (: long live infinite kings

**taeneon** (10): infinite do not miss. more pop perfection

**Heedictated** (9.7): Sunggyu and Woohyun's ability to emote while singing always impress me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): this isn’t Bad at all

**bespectacIed** (9): so good

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this feels like it’d be on a tumblr 8tracks playlist, but a good thing

**throwaway7650** (9): strings! this is almost a 10, I wish the chorus was more than just "bad bad bad bad bad bad bad girl" but I love how dramatic this song is

**1998tweety** (8.5): what this song is not

**aestheticen** (8.5): Great use of autotune in the chorus

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): Ignore any comments using “bad” as part of an untrue pun!!!

**seanderlust** (8.3): weirdly, i kind of like the verses more than the chorus

**Zypker125** (8.1): The choruses and first verse are great, mixing intense dramatic beats with catchy dance-pop. The second verse is definitely weaker though (the “like roller-coaster” part makes me cringe) and the bridge lacks the intensity of the rest of the song.

**2dina3dworld** (8): it do be bad, but not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good, y'know?

**BoneStreetSand** (8): I like this song much better without the music video. But I feel like I’d listen to this again if I needed to hype myself up.

**bulforster** (8): The strings are a serve but the bridge + final chorus are kind of a letdown.

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Great track that just sounds like copyright free movie music sometimes. The chorus is sick, though.

**PSSST12** (7): Quite generic for infinite. Last romeo and legendary BACK outsold with ease.

**skargardin** (7): it's no the chaser but still a bop!

**SlphWsp** (7): Great intro, love the instrumental, dramatic strings, suffers from an annoying chorus, definitely a hype song though

**TiltControls** (7): this song is not

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): eh kind of annoying

**weappreciatepowers** (6.5): ITS CAMP IDC

**cleopatroclus** (6): clue’s in the name i guess

**frogaranaman** (6): title unrelated

**galaxy\_rae** (6): interesting video and song

**RandomHypnotica** (6): how nice of them to make a song about Rihanna


# Bad


**fadedblue09** (5.7): This is quite a mess but their vocals save it. Not fond of the "betting on a girl" lyric though

**sssaaage** (5.5): this is alright ig?? was expecting something way better after the chaser and this was just very boring to me.. it drags a lot

**BebeLuigi** (5): a bit whatever for me

**nyoom** (5): i never liked this song, not because there's anything particularly wrong with it besides that obnoxious kazoo thing going on, but just because it was such a drastic departure from infinite's overall sad post-breakup softboi missing his ex aesthetic in a way that didn't even seem to suit them (press F to pay respects to poor sungkyu's creaky joints) or to showcase their strengths.

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): Too much is going on in the chorus but the pre chorus is amazing

**snugsnhugs** (5): its fine, kind of generic but not the worst

**useless-sheep** (5): kinda living up to its name but the fart noises (?) redeem it a little

**PRADA** (4.5): the verses serve but the chorus is just DESSERT by DJ HYO

**Sedona83** (4.5): Starts off strong, dislike chorus

**grey/0x976** (4): nobody tuning in

**CrimsonROSET** (3): i mean they tried to warn me. This chorus is obnoxious, the classical instruments save this from a 0.

**ebooks #5454** (3): this music makes me sleepy there's so much overstimulation my brain is shutting down

**hasanella** (3): saying its repetitive is hypocritical because i like some really repetitive songs but it felt like a bad repetitive to me

**jasannn** (3): The production is nice but the melody doesnt work at all.

**rickikardashian** (3): every low score comment: “the song title is correct” \*snl music starts playing*

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): This is still their most successful song internationally because I guess some people really like that drop…? Did I stockholm syndrome myself into liking this just because it’s SVT? It’s entirely possible. I’m also gonna [plug the dance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ55DJE4Os4) because it’s possibly my favourite choreo in K-pop...we need more contemporary-influenced choreo in this industry #weloveyouhoshi. Anyway, as a lot of you mentioned Don’t Wanna Cry is definitely Chainsmokers-lite and this actually led to accusations of plagiarism (of the Chainsmokers and Coldplay’s Something Just Like This specifically), which then led to the two aforementioned artists [officially being credited](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7982049/seventeen-coldplay-the-chainsmokers-dont-wanna-cry-credit-plagiarism) on this song! #wehateyouwoozi

**wavingwolves** (1): I told myself I liked this when it came out and I did such a good job of it that I believed so. Well, now that I'm not on the peak of my Carat (SVT's fandom name) phase and I have disliked several of their titles, I can say I really hate this. It's just too... annoying. Not even the choreography for DWC being STUNNING makes me like the song and you can just pretend I gave this my 0, because I would if I had a second one.

---

# So baby put me closer...


**akanewasright** (10): I don’t care that this is literally a chainsmokers song it bops.

**jasannn** (10): I love Closer.

**PSSST12** (10): Yeah, this is basically something just like this by coldplay but that choreo sold what they are trying to sell tbh.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is closer by the chainsmokers but i have also 11ed closer before so who am i to be mad

**snugsnhugs** (10): I love this song

**useless-sheep** (10): plagiarism is ok if it sounds good

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): A fantastic pop song that may borrow the sound of The Chainsmokers, but done well with kpop flair. Dramatic in the best way possible.

**Zypker125** (9.5): I always have a soft-spot for angsty dance-pop, and Don’t Wanna Cry is one of those songs. The chorus drop is one of the most memorable in K-Pop, being super unexpected and catchy. The verses admittedly feel kinda repetitive and the bridge is just serviceable, but the choreo helps enhance the song.

**bulforster** (9.4): Okay yes, this is just a Chainsmokers song but these guys can actually sing.

**1998tweety** (9): big bop, the choreo is so iconic too

**cremeebrulee** (9): i smell a songeniality winner

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This is what Closer stans think Closer sounds like.

**fadedblue09** (9): Only Seventeen can turn these lame Chainsmokers beats into an emotional banger!

**grey/0x976** (9): if you hate this song you have no reason to be mad at seventeen. If it wasnt for THE NUGUSMOKERS existence then woozi wouldve had literally nothing to plagarize therefore its the american mans fault. They are the reason why we dont have world peace

**hyphen-happy** (9): but the choreo is an 11

**jaskiwhere** (9): Call me basic for liking the chainsmokerness of this song but it's so good...idc if this is our closer, it's SO good

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): The first time I heard it I was pretty indifferent to it but now it’s one of my favorite title tracks by them

**SlphWsp** (9): Simple but effective, really feel the emotion, one of the best choreos, so satisfying

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): Closer who??? idk her

**hasanella** (8.5): it sounds nice and would make me cry in a good way

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): if i didn’t want to cry i wouldn’t do rates

**Sedona83** (8.5): Great song

**aestheticen** (8): One of my favourite choreos in K-pop. It would be cool if I can see something just like this from other artists too (haha get it)

**bigbigbee** (8): I know that this song is generic as hell but I still like it. The MV's on some tryhard business though

**BoneStreetSand** (8): Was this played during one of the other rates? I think I remember feeling like this was the best thing I’d ever heard then the drop happened…

**bookthieving** (8): this song is the definition of getting choreopilled

**ebooks #5454** (8): so we just let the group called seventeen have only thirteen members in it??

**lonelyglory** (8): It was my first introduction to SVT so I'm pretty fond of it, but I definitely think it's better as a performance than as song so I rarely seek it without a video. That being said, Jeonghan's super soft voice over the bridge still gives me life.

**nyoom** (8): do or do not, there is no cry

**rickikardashian** (8): just making this comment so i can be next to the other comments that make a the chainsmokers reference

**rotating3Dtext** (8): chainsmokers drop

**SFbby** (8): Something Just Like This???

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I WISH the Chainsmokers sounded like this

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7.5): "Noooooo don't cry ur so sexyyyyyy" - Carats during this era, probably.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): woooooooooow toxic masculinity back at it again, it's ok to cry you know

**TiltControls** (7.5): something about this feels off and i'm not sure what, but i kinda like it still?

**seanderlust** (7.2): my lawyers have advised me against commenting that this is a better version of closer, so let me just say this is a good song



# I DON'T want something just like this


**DraculaWeekend** (7): That chorus definitely reminds me of Closer…

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Chris Martin and the Chainsmokers outsold which is why Chris Martin will collaborate with BTS instead

**Jhe116** (7): If I want something just like this I would just go listen to Something Just like This

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no one sounds nice if their voice is barely above the synth line.

**frogaranaman** (6): so baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover

**HeartofDarkness123** (6): Pretty good but not a standout.

**skargardin** (6): WHY IS THIS DROP GIVING CLOSER

**suffocatedbears** (6): uninspiring chainsmoker dud, but i appreciate the choreo

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): the verses are so good but the chorus really doesn't work for me

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.6): this is a bit too spotify playlist filler for me

**DaBigBoi** (4.5): except i do want to cry

**orbiteezus** (3.5): chainsmokers song

**weappreciatepowers** (3.5): why is it so good until the drop woozi you are a FLOP for copying the chainsmokers out of every artist

**agentofscranton** (3): this is like their worst song and it’s also somehow their most successful make it make sense pls

**sssaaage** (3): i have the same exact complaints w this that i do with aju nice, the terrible drop kinda ruins the rest of the song for me 💔 they were literally accused of plagiarising the chainsmokers for this song theres no way it wasnt gonna be bad

**PRADA** (2.7): just awful and the verses too it’s not a 2 because the dance serves

**bespectacIed** (2): the chainsmokers era of kpop is something i don't wanna ever relive. None of the svt songs i enjoy were in this rate so far so I'm just gonna say mingyu is one of the hottest men who's ever lived

**moonagenightmares** (1): chainsmokers plagiarism scandal over THIS ????

**BebeLuigi** (0): I hate this oh my god this sounds like a bad chainsmokers song

wavingwolves: # Ignore this random user recommendations and just listen to WAVE from SVT'S latest amazing mini YOUR CHOICE!!!! yASSSS


**throwaway7650** (9): DWC has a good chance of being the first seventeen song out and is probably the most controversial one in the rate so I'll write my seventeen essay here. seventeen were the first group I properly stanned since becoming a kpop fan back in 2017. to non-fans, having 13 members is something you question at first. why does a group need that many members? why aren't there 17 of them? but over the course of following them for nearly 4 (!) years now, I can say that each member is essential to the group's identity and their growth from their rookie years has just been tremendous to witness. despite having so many members, they're actually very close as a group too and as a fan I'm not particularly concerned about contract negotiations. anyway, enough sentimental shit, time to defend DWC. yes it's not original, yes the chainsmokers controversy happened, blah blah blah. I still like this song, idc. I think it's actually pretty excellent overall outside of the chorus (which isn't bad, just kind of a copy and paste of something just like this' chorus, woozi plagiarizer etc.) - the bridge in particular is fantastic. imo this is also a song that is elevated by the MV and in particular the dance practice/choreo. I'm not being biased when I say that DWC's choreo is one of the best in kpop ever, it's a contemporary dance masterpiece. anyway since this sub loves to (un)ironically stan closer so much I expect good scores for this song, especially if you've posted about closer during rates or on phcj before. I don't have much hope though and I wouldn't be that disappointed in this being a day 1 song (however I insist it's not a bottom 10 song in this rate). finally, a few song recommendations: if you liked DWC, you might also like highlight, without you, thanks, and home. my recs: pretty U, call call call!, run to you (+ japanese version), and together

**wavingwolves** (8.1): An actual song about BDSM! VIXX as a group were the kings of actually edgy and dark concepts and 4th gen boy groups wish they what it takes to pull it off as effortlessly as they did. They were the originals, everyone that came after them are just the wannabes that will never be able to touch their shadow.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): I think this song perfectly shows why VIXX are known as the ultimate concept kings - men these days just don’t do stuff like this anymore! They really went all out here too, with the chokers and the lyrics and the, uh...slave contract in the album. Good for them, I guess? The song itself is fine, I have to confess I’ve never been a big fan of the chorus as to me it feels kinda disjointed from the verses.

# BDSM lovers


**bespectacIed** (10): Vixx highkey has the best and most consistent discography in kpop, tied with shinee. This is pop perfection.

**bigbigbee** (10): Perfect BPM for pushing yourself when you run

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was a surprising gem tbh! unlike the gg rate a lot of these were new to me because i just dont usually care about men in kpop, but im glad for discoveries like this!

**hasanella** (10): i sure am a slave for this song it can never get old for me

**hikkaru** (10): this hook is laced with crack... CHAINED UP! CHAINED UP!!!

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): I just want everyone in this room to know that in the album packaging for this mini-album depending on which version you bought ('Freedom' or 'Control'), you either got a BDSM Slave Contract ('Control' Ver.) or a paper of "VIXX Instructions" ('Freedom' Ver.) {Random 1 of 6 per album, so one for each member} and that is still the wildest album inclusion I have ever seen in K-Pop.

**rickikardashian** (10): so brave of them to just publicly sing about being subs

**skargardin** (10): WAIT I LOVE THIS

**Zypker125** (9.7): The “nananana” vocal harmony might be the most sexiest part in all of K-Pop. The BDSM lyrics are…. definitely a trip, to say the least. Leo’s/N’s/Ken’s vocals are great as always though, and I actually really like Ravi’s “Eeeny meeny money moe” rap parts,as they flow really well with the song and surprisingly don’t feel cheesy. “Freeze, armor down” is an iconic lyric, and the instrumental is super catchy.

**bookthieving** (9.5): invented harnesses and chokers

**Heedictated** (9.5): kinky~

**letsallpoo** (9): was vixx the horniest kpop boy group

**sssaaage** (8.8): vixx kings

**celladonn** (8.5): We love a bdsm concept

**seanderlust** (8.5): *looks up lyric translation* oh yeah no, yall werent joking, this is literally about BDSM. okay werk.

**throwaway7650** (8.5): the intro is so good... NANANANANANANANANANA

**useless-sheep** (8.5): slay

**bluetriangles04** (8): Someone once said ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me.’

**BoneStreetSand** (8): I really appreciated this. Not my fave, but this song will be a definite grower for me. Any fans of these guys who can explain what happens in the video lol

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): Iconic. Absolutely living for all the recent covers and attention it’s getting (too bad VIXX themselves won’t come back…) I bumped it up for the sheer horny energy and lyrics and the impeccable outfits (whoever put Cha Hakyeon into a red shirt and collar is trying to fucking kill me), but to be honest, I’m not really into the song that much. The chorus feels a bit jarring compared to the rest of the song.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this bops

**nyoom** (8): this should've been Scentist! this will never be Scentist!!

**SlphWsp** (8): Great chorus, don't love the rap, simple but aesthetic mv, also chokers

**weappreciatepowers** (8): HAWT

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**suffocatedbears** (7.5): the hook is very memorable

**jaskiwhere** (7.4): bdsm kings! Something about the production's just off for me otherwise I would love it


# 50 Shades of Grey lovers


**CrimsonROSET** (7): the verses match the vibe of the song, the chorus not as much

**ebooks #5454** (7): theres a lack of chains in this video booooooooo where's the bondage

**foxinthenoodles** (7): The chorus and the verses sound like separate songs, but each are good on their own.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): omg i love VIXX, their vaporub was a staple of me being sick in elementary school

**PSSST12** (7): Listen, Voodoo doll, eternity, and error back to back was a legendary RUN. they kinda lost me with this song but its still ok.

**cleopatroclus** (6.6): I expected more from a song called chained up but this is kind of a snooze

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): Good song I’ll pretend I didn’t see the lyrics lmao

**PRADA** (6.5): ok

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): me when i’m in horny jail

**wavingwolves** (10): I love songs that feature traditional instrumentals + eletronic elements and this is probably the one that pulls it off the best. One of the best songs in this list, this was once top 10 and I was actually so shocked but really happy to see it. I  really thought, "wow, Popheads exhibiting taste?" But yeah, it went down A LOT, as you can see, but it deserved a spot in the top 10. The fact that it's here doesn't really change the ways in which this song is mesmerizing.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): The far superior VIXX song in this rate. I was obsessed with this song in 2017 - it’s grown off me a bit now, but still great. I honestly thought this would place really high but it just barely outperformed Chained Up lol. I’m still mad this didn’t do better both in the rate and in general...K-pop fans as a whole kinda pay VIXX dust :pensive: Anyway we need more use of traditional instruments in K-pop!! Make it happen!

# Utopia

**nyoom** (11): kpop is deeply fucked up as an industry but i can't help but find something heartwrenchingly, agonizingly beautiful about its relentless pursuit of aesthetic at any cost. we can have a little orientalism, as a treat. like. fuckin. "L'étude du beau est un duel où l'artiste crie de frayeur avant d'être vaincu." fuckin. you get me? i really cannot do full justice to how decadently, sensually gorgeous these lyrics are but i tried my hand regardless: https://pastebin.com/qSyzaVF7 you know what just read this (https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan) instead it's the same effect. watch this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fGAXrexmJk) too or i'll steal your kidney

**2dina3dworld** (10): I wish this song would get the Rollin' treatment

**bespectacIed** (10): I wanted to be edgy and give this a deserved 11 but I changed my mind last minute lol. This is my close runner up to View 😢 First of all, taste for the hosts for including the greatest boy group LP album of ALL TIME. I'm talking about Eau De Vixx which technically still has Shangri-La lol. This mix of traditional east asian instrumentation and EDM still blows my mind, it's so flawlessly executed. But the best song to not be included in this rate is My Valentine... I cannot praise Eau De Vixx enough, what a skipless, high-quality electronic album that is too good for kpop

**bigbigbee** (10): Feels like being in an opium den. But like, not a real one...one from an anime that deeply and problematically romanticizes the era of British occupation of Hong Kong, and maybe contains a love line between some dashing sailor and the owner of the den's daughter or something. Sorry, what were we talking about?

**bookthieving** (10): hongbin made some points with his drunken twilight fanfiction!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the blend of traditional elements with that future bass sound... wig

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is one of most gorgeous music videos i've ever seen wow

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This MV is so pretty and deserves way more recognition

**grey/0x976** (10): sadly the only vixx song i can name but it serves

**hasanella** (10): it sounds better the more i listen to it how can a song be so heavenly

**hyphen-happy** (10): god tier

**Jhe116** (10): The song sounds just like the music video

**PSSST12** (10): Beautiful. Vixx regained their footing with this one. That choreo with the fans is so iconic.

**sssaaage** (10): perfection its true.. the song alone is already amazing but the mv makes it even better

**Zypker125** (10): VIXX has always killed it with the concepts, and the traditional fan dance by itself elevated the song by 2 points. The instrumental is super catchy and the vocals are great.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): ICONIC. the song, the choreo, the gayo performance...

**foxinthenoodles** (9): Elegant and interesting to listen to. Filled with catchy parts and is VIXX's best work.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): the colour pallette for this video is gorgeous

**SlphWsp** (9): Lots of fascinating sound bytes in this instrumental, wonderful vocals, fan dance, water dance, most beautiful mv of all time?

**suffocatedbears** (9): i wish i could give it a 10 because the concept is really unique and well executed, but the song itself doesn't have high replay value for me :(

**TiltControls** (9): much better than the other one

**1998tweety** (8.5): big serve

**agentofscranton** (8.5): making me feel like the most luxurious of women

**HeartofDarkness123** (8.5): Same story as the last one, tbh. The song isn’t that compelling to me on its own, although there are some definitely cool moments, like N’s first prechorus (I love his voice), and the fusion of modern synth and traditional Korean instruments but it’s just elevated *so much* by the dance and outfits. The snaps of the fan closing make it hit so much harder. Also, I wish it had integrated the traditional Asian sound more. Special shout out to the killing moment with Ravi and N right before the moment of silence. It murders me every time.

**jaskiwhere** (8.5): This song and MV are really pretty!

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): The usage of hand fans in this choreography was a cultural reset, just saying.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.2): Why don’t these guys have more views??? They’re so freaking good.

**Heedictated** (8): the concept is more enticing than the song itself

**lonelyglory** (8): Mmmmm those fans...

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): Is it possible for a song to be stunning?

**weappreciatepowers** (8): good ass video

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): omg its the song from the quasi una fantasia performance (jokes aside i don’t like how prominent the dubstep elements in this version are)

**ebooks #5454** (7): i think more kpop groups need to dance with fans


# Dystopia 


**fadedblue09** (6.5): Really have a hard time rating this cuz I love the aesthetic aspects: the visuals, choreo, etc. but the song itself is kinda a mess?

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): This is just fine, like it's not bad but I'm not going to remember anything about it in 5 minutes

**PRADA** (6.4): also ok

**BebeLuigi** (6): I know it's considered iconic but I never got much into it, it's boppy tho

**rickikardashian** (6): i want to personally thank the choreographer for pulling out those fans for this

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Just doesn't do much for me

**CrimsonROSET** (4): what’s with the random EDM high-pitched yells? They just completely mess up the song for me, especially with that weird ass outro.

**elleyonce** (4): If you want the version that actually sounds listenable check out The Boyz' take on it on Road to Kingdom called "Quasi una Fantasia"

**snugsnhugs** (3): nothing special

**Sedona83** (2.5): Forgettable

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Chen asking if he can be my boyfriend knowing what we know now about him having a wife and daughter is more funny than it needs to be. I assumed this would place high as it’s EXO-CBX and I’m not even being a biased EXO-L when I say they have a pretty solid discography overall. Sad we’ll never get another comeback (or will we...need Korean fans to forgive Chen after he comes back from the military) but at least they went out with a bang!

**wavingwolves** (2.2): I have no fucking idea what people see in this song. It sounds both bland and annoying as hell to me. And if the sound of it wasn't enough, the lyrics make it seem too much like some kind of Y/N fantasy which just makes me feel even more repelled. Deserved to be #10.

---

**BebeLuigi** (10): amazing track

**bobaroma** (10): CBX goes SHINee. They did it well.

**bookthieving** (10): the best thing exo has ever done

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Such an aesthetically pleasing MV

**grey/0x976** (10): chen singing "you knock me up" and well.... lets take a look at what Oh_Mes2 had to report on January 13th 2020

**hasanella** (10): wonderful choice

**ieatbe** (10): cbx my beloveds

**milkywayinradius** (10): A E S T H E T I C . this mv is so stylish, as in i should screen cap it and use some shots as phone backgrounds.

**snugsnhugs** (10): THIS SONG IS EVERYTHINGGGGGGG. Would give an 11 if I could. The dance, the mv, the lyrics, the aesthetics, the entire album is just *chefs kiss* perfection

**sssaaage** (10): washed most of main group exo titles (stream girl problems)

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): amazing pop song. It sounds so summery, so romantic. Also the MV is gorgeous, I love how pretty everything looks.

**1998tweety** (9.5): yes you can be my boyfriend

**Jhe116** (9.4): Another aesthetics masterpiece

**foxinthenoodles** (9): The amazing vocals and the pulsating beat combine to make an incredibly catchy and fun song.

**hyphen-happy** (9): one of my fav aesthetic mvs

**seanderlust** (9): I love this little deep house moment!! this is a whole bop

**SlphWsp** (9): Great house sound, amazing subunit, playful vocals, lots of variety in this song, cute and quirky mv and choreo

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.5): the other songs on the album are better

**throwaway7650** (8.5): really good song but I hate the boyfriend line, xiumin is like 30 and chen is a dad. anyway stream the one (and its MV!)

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): nice song i like it, no you can’t be my boyfriend tho.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): The music video and second-half of the song really saves this. But, no, you cannot be my boyfriend. You either got to be subtle or go full on “you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you” to win me over.

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): I’m into it. I heard snippets way before but they haven’t done the full song justice at all.

**akanewasright** (7.4): This is cute

**cleopatroclus** (7.2): vocals good but instrumentals lack lustre and tbh i expected more from them

**jaskiwhere** (7): Other than the chorus, I'm a fan

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): EXO-CBX... a group that alongside CIX has made people think my favorite band is secretly a K-Pop group. (Side note: They did Chen dirty with the looks in this era.)

**bespectacIed** (6): pure innocent fun

**moonagenightmares** (5.6): the song isnt that good but i love baekhyun’s voice so much he could probably make any song bearable

**nyoom** (5.5): "so baby, can i be your boyfriend" no, you don't know how to use a condom

**fadedblue09** (5.3): I expect better from an EXO subunit.

**10footnotes** (5): Score lowered for boyfriend marketing. (Also I feel like the production of this song is strangely thin, the percussive elements sound kinda harsh?)

**DaBigBoi** (5): Kinda bored with this song

**Zypker125** (4.3): Really wish we did Hey Mama! instead, that song is much better imo. This song is just fairly boring and mono-dimensional, only saved by its vocals.

**Sedona83** (3.5): Chorus lyrics killed it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Ugh, I miss this kind of sad boppy sound in K-pop so much :/ No doubt their most iconic (and best!) song, I’m really glad it at least made day 3 - it was initially just languishing in the 30s and 20s, but by the time more ballots started coming in it managed to secure this spot <3 Definitely one of my favourite songs in the whole rate.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): Okay, you know the main riff that goes on for the whole song? That's actually what I consider the catchiest moment of this rate. I can never really remember anything else about this song beside it and the "fiction in fiction" part of the chorus. While this song is iconic, it feels to me that it has too much going on and parts of it end up getting muddled. The thing that we could do without is the paper scratching, I fear it could have been taken out and no one can't tell me otherwise. It's too loud!! Still, I'm actually really happy and surprised a 2nd gen group was able to get this far with an early '10s song. This spot feels deserving.

# Fantasy readers 


**aestheticen** (10): This and "Error" sit on the same table

**bigbigbee** (10): It sure DOES hold the fuck up 10 years later

**bobaroma** (10): me with 2011 feels. Wanna go back.

**celladonn** (10): Classique. That central refrain is so good

**fadedblue09** (10): One of my favorite 2nd gen discoveries here. We need more emotional breakup bops by men! Though I’m not sure if I should get into their music since one of them turned out to be….😬

**milkywayinradius** (10): classic song and choreo. i can feel the anguish, man. i was obsessed with this song back in the day when it came out. every part is great, especially the bridge. ok why wasn't Shock or Breath in this rate? turn on location, rate-makers, i just wanna show you my playlist.

**PSSST12** (10): Now THAT'S A classic. An 11 contender. If were rating the orchestral version, it might have taken my 11. This song is the embodiment of christmas depression to me because that opening synths (?) reminds me of the christmas lights that plays music we use to have when I was young.

**suffocatedbears** (10): masterpiece

**TiltControls** (10): oooh i love this.

**universemates** (10): Iconic, from the feet shuffle to the "fiction in fiction". Twelve-year-olds me was obsessed with this song. This is also one of the songs that I notice non-kpop fans can get into more easily, probably due to the bittersweet melody.

**Heedictated** (9.9): that's how you make a sad bop and the iconic footwork dance matches the vibe well

**dekubaku** (9.5): There's nothing's fictitious about this song's awesomeness. True story!

**useless-sheep** (9.5): the feeling is conveyed in such a perfect way

**BebeLuigi** (9): It is one of the most addictive kpop song out there

**hikkaru** (9): i love that lil synth :soblove:

**jaskiwhere** (9): Love the piano, love the thumping beat in the background, love the chorus! I feel like the camera angles did more for this song's dance in the MV than the actual dance steps lol

**PRADA** (9): top 3 song in the rate

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): Okay so I haven't heard this song in full in at least 3 years, but like, it still slaps. Also raise your hand if you've ever tried that like foot shuffle move from the chorus and fucking flopped.

**SlphWsp** (9): Immediate tears what a great song, nice to revisit, Highlight still going strong

**snugsnhugs** (9): a classic

**ebooks #5454** (8.9): this has major old skool BIGBANG energy aka the best energy

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): they served here!!

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): The synth line is really reminding me of an indie pop/rock song but for the life of me I can't remember what it is and that's gonna be annoying me for a while now.

**foxinthenoodles** (8): The production is a little dated but still 100% a bop. Proves that having a good hook is half the battle in kpop.

**hyphen-happy** (8): god tier chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (8): how do you make the chorus the least catchy part of your song

**nyoom** (8): incredible Breakeven energy, still fucking hits

**skargardin** (8): this mv absolutely sent me into outer space

**throwaway7650** (8): shame they have trash members [3] since the song bops

**BoneStreetSand** (7.9): I like the background music and vocals, but this song just doesn’t stand out.

**chenle** (7.8): this is 2011 but in a good way

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**akanewasright** (7.5): I don’t love the main synth but this is really nice.

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): The harmonies and piano go well together. #Fiction

**hasanella** (7.5): i love the chorus

**jasannn** (7.5): I remember the weird leg shuffling being really cool before. Now, it just looks awkward. Still iconic tho.

**tiltheendoftheline** (7.5): this was soooooo catchy

**Zypker125** (7.4): Overall, I don’t like this style of song, so it’s impressive that I actually liked the song itself. It hits just enough angst and catchiness to work for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): this feels like its building to something bigger than what we end up getting but it's still nice

**cremeebrulee** (7): i didnt do this rate to be sad wtf

**CrimsonROSET** (7): DON’T BE SCARED OF THE PIANO LINE IT’S YOUR STRONG SELLING POINT WHY ARE YOU USING IT SO LITTLE NOOOOO

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i thought they were saying friction the entire time until i read the name

**runaway3212** (7): woodvale be like

**HeartofDarkness123** (6.5): I enjoy everything about this song except the refrain of "fiction" itself. Pretty pleasant and enjoyable listen but it doesn't spark joy like the higher rated songs.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): jimin on her instagram story

**moonagenightmares** (6.3): this is fine i guess

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Gaga definitely stole parts of this for Fashion!

**frogaranaman** (6): cinematic, kind of like I’m watching an anime where the suspiciously busty lead female just established a basic boundary with the toxic lead male and now he’s in his feels

**rosecoloreds** (6): that children sample absolutely took me out


# Nonfiction readers idk 


**bulforster** (5.6): The chorus way overproduces a pretty vocal and muddies it.

**cleopatroclus** (5.5): felt like a terrible copy of an already poor song that i don't remember, vocals make up slightly for the instrumental

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): i have no idea what the was about, i think it had something to do with fiction though

**10footnotes** (5): I feel like I’ve heard this song a bunch before. Maybe that’s unfair to Beast/Highlight, because Fiction is from 2011 and could easily be the blueprint for many similar bg songs that came after it, but, subjectively, it’s still not doing a lot for me.

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): I both like this and don’t like this?

**weappreciatepowers** (4): SHIT BORING ETC SAVE ME

**Sedona83** (3.5): Basic, unmemorable

**2dina3dworld** (3): Firstly, Troublemaker was the best thing to come out of B2ST. Secondly, the mixing on this gave me a headache.

**sssaaage** (2.5): wishing this song was fiction

**wavingwolves** (8.7): Honestly, everyone who thought this was a contender for the winner needs to put some clown make-up on because it wasn't ever really the case. While this is one of BTS' most popular post-western attention songs between both fans and non-fans, it still misses the mark a lot compared to other songs they have in. This feels pretty inoffensive to me and definitely prefer it over every single song they have released since then, but they have better, so this spot feels decent for it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): Okay, first of all I have to say that the entire time this rate has been going on I have been laughing to myself seeing people say that this is a legitimate contender for rate winner when the highest placement it **ever** reached was #20. I was under the impression everyone at least thought it was decent but clearly we favour Spring Day and Run :mischief:. Just wanted to get that out of the way. Onto the actual song, it’s a shame BWL came out just as I was leaving my ARMY era and therefore in my biggest anti-BTS era because I had to pretend that this song isn’t a bop. It’s pretty good but I maintain that some of their earlier songs are better! At any rate, this is the song that deserved to smash in the West over Dynamite and Butter :/

---


# Boy with praise

**endcreditouilles** (11): gotta give some credit to Halsey for introducing me to what is now one of my favorite bands of all time. BTS' SNL performance of this song and Mic Drop sealed the deal and kickstarted my love for them, which then opened the door for me to the kpop genre in general. 11 for the song that started it all for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is the best song of all time

**jasannn** (11): When this first came out, I told my roommate, "its good but I don't think it'll be my favorite BTS song," and then it literally did.

**10footnotes** (10): Spicy opinion alert: BWL is my favorite BTS title track! Their most electronic and hip-hop-influenced stuff isn’t my cup of tea, which already doesn’t leave many title tracks left for me to enjoy (better not to go on record about what I think of On/Dynamite/Butter). But this song is so cute and fresh and fun! (And… well, I guess I’m going for it anyway, it sounds like it actually has a soul.) The biggest reason I’m scoring this track so high is that I first listened to it all the way back when it came out, in April 2019—over two years ago, way before I got into K-pop and learned details about BTS and the genre as a whole. But despite it being several years and many listens later, Boy With Luv hasn’t gotten stale for me at all, and I enjoy it just as much as I did in the beginning. Also, it’s just kind of a perfectly crafted song.

**aestheticen** (10): I don't care what anyone says, this is a good pop song

**bigbigbee** (10): A perfect pop song, sorry about it (and I prefer the version on streaming to the version in the MV, which I didn't know existed until this rate!) I've listened to this an embarrassing number of times. It reminds me of a sunset.

**dekubaku** (10): Pop Perfection

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Oh man, I think this is my favorite song from BTS ever for the simple reason is that the song is pop perfection and the music video is just so iconic. I personally wish this was BTS' biggest hit instead of Dynamite or Butter. I am a sucker for bubblegum pop songs like this.

**frogaranaman** (10): \*gives this a 10\* this song better not win

**hikkaru** (10): deserved to have the chart success of dynamite and butter

**ignitethephoenix** (10): here’s how Halsey can win a rate @ u/CarlieScion

**pat-rickstar** (10): This really does bop so I won't be mad if it wins despite how boring it would be

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this might have been the last bts song that I actually really liked

**runaway3212** (10): I don't want this to win, it sounds like A.I. made a pop song, Halsey adds nothing to it. However the A.I. did a very good job

**spacebunsailor** (10): bubblegum pop perfection deserved all the dynamite and butter success

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Yeah, this is just an absolute bop, only part I don't really like is Suga's verse but with how good the rest is, I can forgive it.

**TiltControls** (10): will halsey win two rates in a row? future me get on the case (June 28 note from future self: naur)

**Heedictated** (9.9): liked the song from my first listen but damn did it grow on me even more

**BoneStreetSand** (9.8): I don’t care what my father says, I love this song with every fibre of my body.

**Zypker125** (9.6): I know a lot of people call this song mainstream, basic, etc., but I’ve always loved this song. I still feel like there’s no K-Pop chorus like it, and the song has a sweet romantic vibe that really works for me. The first verse drags a bit and I wish they cut J-Hope’s rap-sing portion from the song, but overall, I still really like it.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I’ll be a little sad if this wins, because it’s like… this is the most Americanized it really gets. It’s a song people got into because it has a big pop star attached to it, and that feels a little :/ but with that said, it is a perfect pop song

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): this is a smash idc

**bulforster** (9.2): The MV version that saves Halsey for the end is superior but this is still fantastic.

**rickikardashian** (9.2): this would be my 11 if it wasnt for them using the ugliest synth possible in the background of the chorus

**grey/0x976** (9): #HALSEY_OUT

**hasanella** (9): do i wish halsey was not on the song even if her part was very small yes does the music video play in my head automatically when i hear boy with luv of course does that give the song an unfair edge probably but it is so infectiously fun

**nyoom** (9): i think the korean title, "A Poem for Small Things," is absolutely lovely and much better than Boy With Luv, but i get that the western pop market is less receptive to titles like that. love halsey's parts, oh my my my. "love is nothing stronger than a boy with luv" unless we presuppose that "love" and "luv" are being treated as two concepts somehow distinct from one another, "A is nothing stronger than B with A" -> (1) "A = B + A" -> "B = 0" so this boy ain't shit, or (2) "A < B + A" -> "0 < B" which tells us nothing but that "boy" is an entity with some sort of estimable superzero value, no matter how small,

**PSSST12** (9): POP PERFECTION. a little bit generic but still doesn't fail to put a smile on my face.

**skargardin** (9): this is winning isn't it

**TragicKingdom1** (9): glad halsey is getting her second rate win in 2 weeks after n11ghtmare!

**1998tweety** (8.5): Halsey's charity

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): a cute feel good bop

**seanderlust** (8.3): me bumping this up to a 10 despite viscerally hating SUGA's rap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXmvFhADVUM

**2dina3dworld** (8): the SUPERIOR Halsey/BTS collab

**cremeebrulee** (8): its funny bc i really do like this song but hearing the two bts songs before this makes it sound like a downgrade... its still cute tho!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://imgur.com/fFS80WI

**RandomHypnotica** (8): BTS and Halsey on the same song is just asking for people to tank this

**SlphWsp** (8): Like the instrumental but why is Halsey so annoying here, an earworm for better or worse maybe I've just heard it too many times

**throwaway7650** (8): the transition from the first chorus into suga's rap is a bit awkward but other than that bop. come be my teacher uwu

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): this is such a great pop song. It gets stuck on my head at least once a week.

**cherryices** (7.6): jimin is a delight, as usual. halsey blends in well here

**milkywayinradius** (7): halsey eh.. kind of wish it was a different artist featured.

**snugsnhugs** (7): its fun and definitely an earworm

**ebooks #5454** (6.9): this song usually hits but after listening to their older stuff, this is not hitting as much anymore oh noooooo

**foxinthenoodles** (6.5): It's very ok.

**jaskiwhere** (6.5): Boy in Luv is Superior to this but this is still a chill summer bop

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): This is the best of the "BTS Attempts to Top Billboard" songs they've put out thus far (even tho it's been two years...) But goddammit I miss old BTS.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): I'm sorry but this did not need Halsey

**sssaaage** (5): this song is fine, its at least better than like almost everything that came after this and one of the last times their vocals dont sound absolutely horrible..... we hate you bighit

**PRADA** (4): halsey QUEEN of effort

**Sedona83** (4): Boring, bland, bad rap

**weappreciatepowers** (4): overplayed annoying etc halsey shut up

**HeartofDarkness123** (3): Meh. Never particularly enjoyed it, and the parts I liked (rapline) have worn thin for me. It’s bubblegum pop that isn’t particularly catchy to me.

**bespectacIed** (2): halsey's parts were nice but this song is so grating. Silver lining: taehyung is so damn hot, must be so hard to be that fine

**fadedblue09** (2): Feels so bland and generic compared to their other songs here. I think they’re talented but I just don’t think this song brings out the best in them. Also Halsey didn't add much IMO. This is their Ice Cream idc

**throwawayforshady** (2): I'm sorry I really dislike this song and the damn pink suits in the MV with my whole being...

I'm rather surprised Stray Kids is still in while Ateez ranked so low. Those songs have a similar style/structure. Might be the Big3 magic working for them here?

Sedona83: >stray kids is still in while Ateez

Stays have a much larger presence on Reddit than Atinys do. I posted about the rate in both weekly chats on their respective subs. With only 150 people participating, I'm wanting to bet that's what is going on.

=====

reiichitanaka: Miroh and Wonderland are really different though ? If Stray Kids' representative song in the rate had been Side Effects, I would get the comparison, but Miroh is far from being as noisy and has been well received by kpop fans in general.

Wonderland on the other hand... Seeing it that low hurt me, but I get it. It's way too loud and aggressive for most of this sub. I personally love it *because* it's loud and over-the-top. I know I have trash taste though - I miss Hongjoong's mullet and this seems to be an extremely unpopular opinion lol.
[/r/popheads/comments/ohonj4/2010s_kpop_boy_groups_reveal_day_2_youll_wish/h4s6vvf/]

=====

emmach17: Yeah, I love Wonderland but I can totally understand why it's divisive. I'd be interested to know how a more 'normal' song would do, like Say My Name or INCEPTION (especially INCEPTION imo since it's one of their best videos). Maybe even Take Me Home since it's 80s inspired and we all know this sub generally loves that style of music. Other than the loose pirate concept and a few loud songs, I've found ATEEZ doesn't really have as consistent a sound as some other groups.
[/r/popheads/comments/ohonj4/2010s_kpop_boy_groups_reveal_day_2_youll_wish/h4sft81/]

=====

reiichitanaka: >I've found ATEEZ doesn't really have as consistent a sound as some other groups.

As of now, ATEEZ are much more defined by their performance style than by their music. I'm super glad that the Korean GP is discovering them through their performances on Immortal Songs because it doesn't set any expectations when it comes to music style - it leaves space for experimentation for the years to come, and I think that everyone involved (ATEEZ + EDENARY) just really enjoy going in a different direction every time they release new music.

Stray Kids do experiment a lot too but people tend to base their opinion on their most successful title tracks (which all more or less are high energy EDM, but still different styles), generally ignoring the more mellow side of their discography.
[/r/popheads/comments/ohonj4/2010s_kpop_boy_groups_reveal_day_2_youll_wish/h4si55c/]

=====

emmach17: Totally agree on the performance style, that’s a really good way to put it! That was how I found them actually, some good performances came up when I was watching BTS performance videos and I was impressed by them
[/r/popheads/comments/ohonj4/2010s_kpop_boy_groups_reveal_day_2_youll_wish/h4si9dd/]

=====

funimarvel: I think Kingdom showed Stray Kids have more really active international fans than ATEEZ and if you look at their respective popularity on r/Kpop and their own subs, Stray Kids ranking higher doesn't seem too surprising. I love both but I can also see why Miroh is less devisive than Wonderland on this sub.

As for GOT7, they have some of the greatest songs in Kpop and the 3 songs in here are some of their best title tracks. The only thing about them that I don't love is Mark's cringey English bridge in You Calling Me Name but the rest of the song is so perfect it makes up for it. Look might be my favorite JB-produced title track, it's such a bop and that chorus (with he dance) is always stuck in my head. And Lullaby got me into GOT7, it's so catchy and it was cool of them to make 4 different languages versions too. If you do was the first GOT7 song that really got them noticed by the Korean fans and it's a well-loved classic. I'm not surprised they're still in the running.
