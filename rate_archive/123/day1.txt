https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/oh2850/2010s_kpop_boy_groups_reveal_day_1_uh_you_think/

# Hello, my poor meow meows...

[Welcome](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837510667652300830/849345000844296282/IMG_20210601_163708.png) to the first day of the Combatting Misandry & Xenophobia in Popheads event, which is also called the 2010s K-Pop Boy Groups rate! 

This is the rate for people who have woken up earlier than usual to watch a k-pop MV that looks like a car commercial... just like my co-host u/MoonlightByWindow has done multiple times. <3

If you don't know anything about most of these groups and just did the rate to support men, then get ready to have a fun time seeing the people who do know something go crazy over certain placements! In any case, it WILL be fun, I promise. We have a lot ready for you. 

***

Today we will be revealing songs placing at **#60-#41** in the main rate and **#10-#7** in the bonus rate. 

**We'll be starting at 4pm EST**, an hour from now, so be ready! 

**The main event takes place at the [BeatSense room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj?ref=beatster&u=P17763eac1c32)**, where we will reveal the placements, have fun with shitposts (original or not) and listen to intermission songs that are, sometimes, not by men!! **BE THERE!!**

**And make sure to keep this thread open as well!** I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out and it features some banners featuring comments made by some of the funniest of you.

**[All scores](https://paste.ee/p/TofaW)**

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Now...this song is literally HIGH CAMP. I wouldn’t expect you guys to understand its intricate, metaphorical, avant-garde excellence but it’s fine. It’s fine. This song was actually doing...okay until about 50 ballots had come in, and then it just hit the #60 spot and stayed there ever since. *Debbie Wanner voice* AND I’M PISSED!

**wavingwolves** (10): This is probably the most surprising placement for me. Maybe I was blind-sided by the fact I was once upon a time an ikonic (that's their fandom name, isn't it cool? yes, it is), but this song is good? It's really bouncy and fun to listen to, it feels so inoffensive to me, but maybe I'm wrong since this got as many 0s as my score for it. The one thing I don't like about this is the MV. The styling in it is awful and they all look like they smell like sweat barely covered by Axe body spray. I'll also never forgive whoever made Junhoe get that piss yellow blonde, it haunts me to this day.

---

# GONNA GET IT POPPIN!

**Zypker125** (10): Almost gave this my 11 (was waffling between Crown, Spring Day, Rhythm Ta and Beautiful). If this was the rock remix of Rhythm Ta, it would have gotten my 11 (absolute fire and everyone who likes the OG Rhythm Ta should check it out). The OG is still the banger representative of the decade, though, with fun and boppy verses.

**Heedictated** (9.3): honestly the song is double b junhoe and friends but not complaining amazing hype song

**PRADA** (8.9): one of their best song yass

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I’m not going to pretend that this is objectively good, but it’s like Flo Rida. You don’t listen to it because it’s art, you listen to it because it’s fun.

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): my initial comment was about how killing me deserved to be on here instead since its ikons only good song but i think ive somehow accidentally stockholmed myself into liking this what the fuck

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): I have not heard this in at least 4 years but this was always my favorite of theirs. Idk what made me stop listening to it lol. But uhhh yeah this still does get it popping.

**bigbigbee** (8): Very very funny that one member of this group is relegated to singing the "nanana"s in the final chorus. That's all he gets to do. Like damn, is he that bad?

**BoneStreetSand** (8): This sounds fun. Was going to deduct points because of how poorly the fashion aged and the awkward English, but then I saw a dog so I refrained.

**elleyonce** (8): IGEO KEUNYANG NORAE NIKKA RHYTHM TA!!! WE GON GET IT POPPIN WE GON WE GON GET IT POPPIN!! MWOHAE?

**emmach17** (8): ATEEZ's version would get my 11 though

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): The song and beat fucks. It also sounds really distinct compared to the last three groups, which probably helps its standing.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is ass (derog.) [but also affectionate]

**foxinthenoodles** (7): Bouncy and fun, albeit a little repetitive. Makes you want to hang out with the whole of iKON.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Sooooooo catchy

# Disappointed in the lack of jumping when popping


**PSSST12** (7): The cringe LMAAAAOOOOO. That music video is too hard for me to watch back then But I am lying if I say I don't bop my head to this song like that bulldog in the mv.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Rhyming "dadi" with "die yeah" is a….stylistic choice I respect

**frogaranaman** (6): I got really nauseous listening to this song for some reason

**Sedona83** (6): Good but I prefer the Ateez remix

**taeneon** (6): "going to school without showering, that's hiphop"

**seanderlust** (5.6): I know it's in korean but in the first verse it sounds like that one guy just says "coochie." which is better than the actual lyrics tbh

**nyoom** (5.5): why tf wouldn't they just call this "ride the rhythm"? also this song smells like a middle school cafeteria

**1998tweety** (5): well

**SlphWsp** (5): Just not my thing, repetitive, too much rap for me, mv strangely hilarious, Churchill?

**thedoctordances1940** (5): I've heard that the Korean public's taste doesn't always match up with us western popheads's taste and I'm guessing this is an example of that. It's far from terrible but it's not something I'd really want to revisit.

**useless-sheep** (5): was good until the excessively aggressive rap :audience:

**jaskiwhere** (4.5): This does Not Vibe but the Rock Version of this song slaps

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): this is a bit try-hard even for a boy group

**DraculaWeekend** (4): Huh?

**galaxy\_rae** (4): ive never seen so much forced hype in my life

**hasanella** (4): i am so sorry i just can not vibe with rhythm ta although i can vibe with bobby vibing

**skargardin** (4): count yourselves lucky iKON that I'm not in the mood to give a zero this rate

**throwaway7650** (4): the intro is so cool and then... :well: also fart noises

**rickikardashian** (3.5): why is this so long

**suffocatedbears** (3.5): only the chorus kinda bops, the rest of the song is abit of a drag

**10footnotes** (2): No :)

**ImADudeDuh** (2): ma’am, there is a fart noise several times on your song.

**weappreciatepowers** (2): HORRIBLE SHIT ETC MAKE IT STOP SAVE ME

**BebeLuigi** (1): I don't know what the goal was but it's not working fam

**cleopatroclus** (1): the ta stands for tachycardia and i only hope that this ends in cardiac arrest for me after almost 4 torturous minutes of this

**hikkaru** (1): this is horrid who made these production choices erm

**runaway3212** (1): Horrible

**snugsnhugs** (1): god i really don't like this song

**sssaaage** (1): this is genuinely so horrible omg.... that instrumental???? its unlistenable. theres not a moment of this song i enjoy and this was SO close to getting my 0

**bulforster** (0): Why get it popping if you're not also gonna get it jumping?

**CrimsonROSET** (0): there were three distinct times i thought the production was fart noises, then it somehow got worse

**lonelyglory** (0): I dunno I just extremely don't vibe with this song, something about the put upon swag is really putting me off

**RandomHypnotica** (0): this instrumental feels scientifically engineered to be as annoying as possible

**spacebunsailor** (0): honestly the first song that actually made me stop the playlist and be like tf is this

# Storytime with u/cremeebrulee's sister 

**ebooks #5454** (0): i've mentioned the various kpop dance clubs at my HS. there was a lot of annoying shit with them because they were really picky about who they wanted in their dances. i don't mean this in terms of skill but rather, if you weren't east asian, they would put you down/neglect helping you when learning the dances. frankly im not a dancer but there were time i wanted to learn dances for shits and giggles. yet every time they wouldn't help me learn or ignore me when i asked questions. i was so frustrated with them i stopped showing up to the club. i remember seeing them perform this onstage for a show and my god they really picked the WORST dancers for this number (clearly they only picked their friends). considering the dance has many suave moves like body rolls, you could only imagine the pain and second hand embarassment of watching pre-pubescent, lanky kids try to dance to this. everyone in the audience was WILDLY uncomfortable and i prayed for the song to just end. even to this day i can not listen to this song without terrible flashbacks to that horrifying performance.

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): Shoutout to /u/cremeebrulee's sister.

**wavingwolves** (7.2): Nevermind what I said about Rhythm Ta's placement being the most shocking for me, because this is it. I think the thing with this was that most people pretty much agreed this was mid, whereas other songs that elicited more strong reactions also had its fair share of love. In any case, I think this deserved better than being the second out. AND WE LOVE YOU JINYOUNG!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): Ahh, B1A4, one of those groups that always received more attention in Korea than with Western fans due to the slower nature of their songs. I get we’re all ballad antis here but y’all did this so dirty :/ #59?? Really??

---

# #JINYOUNG_OUR_SHINING_DIAMOND


**elleyonce** (11): It's that immaculate. That perfect. Jinyoung always understood the assignment.

**akanewasright** (10): Wait this is really cute

**fadedblue09** (10): Simple but sweet, love how every one of them gets to shine vocally. Another 2nd gen gem I discovered!

**useless-sheep** (10): This has the movie credits music (??) vibe i love, it feels so warm. It's the kind of song that can make you feel nostalgic even if you've never heard it before

**universemates** (9.5): lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely

**Heedictated** (9.3): Jinyoung is so underrated as a composer this song is a total bop but also captures that loneliness well also the fits for the mv are classy af

**moonagenightmares** (9.3): this is a really cute song

**grey/0x976** (9): people call this boring but have honeymoon in their top 10 albums :cryinglaughing: anyway

**rickikardashian** (8.5): there used to be an ad for baby food in my country that would show the babies floating like balloons to represent them being very gassy, so this whole music videos just makes me think of a bunch of grown gassy balloon babies

**seanderlust** (8.5): I would absolutely listen to this on my walkman in the early 2000s while resting my head against the car window and watching the raindrops roll by

**throwaway7650** (8.5): I get how this can be considered somewhat boring with annoying vocals but it's still a good song imo, doesn't deserve to go out day 1

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): I had to keep adjusting my score because it kept getting better.

**aestheticen** (8): “A Lie” stays superior

**bluetriangles04** (8): This song really grew on me; the last chorus is gorgeous and the song is lovely.

**cremeebrulee** (8): score is a bit inflated because the main guy can get it

**dekubaku** (8): Listening to this for the first time and it is very pleasant.

**1998tweety** (7.5): the voquelles jumped

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Objectively probabably kind of a cute mid-tempo bop but I have a special place in my heart for this one because I used to listen to it while making cheddar eggs in my kitchen. That's an indelible memory, sadly.

**jasannn** (7.5): It's a good melancholy song.

**agentofscranton** (7): idk who these mens are but they sound beautiful

**DaBigBoi** (7): subtle but nicely made

**ebooks #5454** (7): why do they look like the cast of boys over flowers (their vocals are v soothing tho)

**frogaranaman** (7): this cover art is giving me One Direction

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i am a sucker for key changes

**SlphWsp** (7): Pleasant ballad, nothing groundbreaking, pretty outro

**TiltControls** (7): i'm levitating

**weappreciatepowers** (7): cute ballad


# #JINYOUNG_OUT

**cleopatroclus** (6.5): vocals at start serving jungkook airy voice with no support, otherwise kinda cute altho rap feels randomly thrown in

**chenle** (6): why does this song feel six minutes long

**CrimsonROSET** (6): inoffensive (derogatory)

**PSSST12** (6): It's cute but a little too dull? Solo day should have been here instead because that song was an 11.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): every rate needs a 2000’s-esque ballad to leave Day 1

**runaway3212** (6): im yawning and bopping, im yopping

**skargardin** (6): we LOVE a key change even when it fails to make an impact!

**throwawayforshady** (6): Probably the only B1A4 comeback I don't like lol

**DaHumanTorch** (5.3): this was kinda boring...it had a nice melody though/was nice overall. just nothing special or great about it. i doubt i'll remember this

**BebeLuigi** (5): I won't lie I already forgot the song lol

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): 2ne1 and sistar outsold i fear

**foxinthenoodles** (5): Forgettable but probably a good song in concert.

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): I feel torn because this sounds like a song I’d usually like but I feel like something is missing from it? I’m not sure what tho

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5): This may be the most middle of the road K-Pop song I've ever heard in almost 7 fucking years of being a K-Pop fan... That's bad.

**taeneon** (5): i don't hate it but also will never listen again so

**thedoctordances1940** (5): snooze

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): very chill but also boring

**PRADA** (4.9): snooze wtf

**HeartofDarkness123** (4.5): I enjoyed it a bit more towards the end but it's so painfully unmemorable. I'm pretty sure I can't tell you anything about this song, and I am writing this as I listen.

**suffocatedbears** (4.5): love the outro and the song progressively gets better, but overall rather meh

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Unappealing.

**jaskiwhere** (4): Maybe if he stopped complaining about how lonely he is his music video gf wouldn't have left him...idk...just...thoughts...

**nctdreamsqd** (3): Their voices were too nasally for my liking

**sssaaage** (3): actually such a snooze but its inoffensive ig

**bulforster** (2.5): I really dislike how nasal the first verse's vocals are and then the rest doesn't do enough to redeem it.

**nyoom** (2): i heard the opening note and then left to listen to africa by toto on repeat instead. then i came back and listened to more of the song and then left to listen to africa by toto again.


# Can someone give me another word for tedious, monotonous or dull? 

**hikkaru** (3.5): this being boring asf

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (3.5): bit boring

**emmach17** (2): This is just boring

**Sedona83** (2): Boring, didn't like main vocalist

**Zypker125** (2): Anyone would be lonely if they listened to this absolute bore of a song. No but seriously, this song is super uninteresting. It lacks the emotion of a ballad but has the slow-paced dragginess of one, and the low-fi energy can put me to sleep.

**snugsnhugs** (1): boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): If we ignore the ballad Don’t Leave, then Shall We Dance is actually the last song Block B would release. Let’s just say it’s no MAGO levels of disbandment song, even though I seem to be one of the few people who actually enjoys the chorus drop.

**wavingwolves** (3): This is one of the songs in the rate that I heard so much because of listening parties and such that I'm at the brink ofconvincing myself I actually like it, even though my final score says otherwise. The MV for this is still my least favourite out of all of them, and I hope I don't need to explain *why*, which definitely lowers my enjoyment overall, but but I can see how this song has its charming moments. I like the way this song feels a little less Zico & The Boys and how the members kind of get their share in it. Considering this was one of their last songs before disbandment, it's nice. Even if nothing really makes this song amazing, I do think it's memorable, just like Block B as a group.

# 💃


**DraculaWeekend** (10): I am willing to overlook the questionable hairstyles in this MV because this song is just so effortlessly cool

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): Now THIS is how you do brass. Holy shit. This song slaps.

**Leixander** (9.5): turns out that yes, we shall!

**moonagenightmares** (9.2): surprised by how good this was, think i heard a korean eminem say a slur in there somewhere though

**1998tweety** (9): the production is immaculate

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): an absolute slapper

**PSSST12** (9): I was a little unsure about this at first but that base line + guitar riff during the chorus was too good to resist.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.8): So cool, but it’s no NalinA. Then again, we get full coverage of Taeil’s neck tattoo here and NalinA could never…

**sssaaage** (8.5): this is such a bop idc like its not amazing or anything but still

**nyoom** (8): sure, let me just take a month of salsa lessons first i guess

**throwaway7650** (8): this song is annoyingly catchy, I blame zico [2] (also blaming him for the MV, Mr. "I'm yellow but my soul is black")

**weappreciatepowers** (8): good verses and the drop is good too BITCH SOTY

**Heedictated** (7.9): vibey but kinda forgettable

**ebooks #5454** (7.5): yes, we shall dance!!!

**cleopatroclus** (7.2): rap that properly fits the instrumentals?? what's this? chorus probably the worst part, feels kinda empty and could’ve been a lot better

**akanewasright** (7): This bops a little bit :/ the video and it’s cultural appropriation colors my view of some of stylings in the song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): they only count up to 7 for a reason

**dekubaku** (7): Pretty interesting sound

**ImADudeDuh** (7): that was all over the place, but some of the places were good

**jaskiwhere** (7): The prechorus is great but the rest of the song drags for me. Also, Block B definitely had more rappers than they actually needed lol

**rotating3Dtext** (7): there’s like… so much cultural appropriation in the video I’m (correct me if I’m wrong)

**Roxieloxie** (7): probably the biggest example of a song in the rate where seeing the music video had the opposite affect on me. This song is a bop and was a close ten for me but that video um, yeah

**SlphWsp** (7): Nice bounce to this, not too complicated, laid back dance track

# 🧍


**foxinthenoodles** (6.5): Won't be the most memorable but is fun to listen to.

**liberalitea** (6.5): that chorus is the most disappointing thing ever because the rest of the song slaps

**PRADA** (6.2): it’s ok

**elleyonce** (6): Thank you ZICO for hip-hopifying Havana in that chorus

**Zypker125** (5.6): If I wanted to listen to the Shall We Dance boy group song that’s actually good, I would go listen to Snuper’s, which is superior in every way to Block B’s. This song just has no idea what it wants to be, as the verses and the chorus are vastly different in terms of energy and tone.

**aestheticen** (5): I’m not a fan of brass instrument beat drops

**bigbigbee** (5): I think this is actually objectively fun but I never seek this out.

**fadedblue09** (5): At first, I scored this higher than HER but it grows off after a few listens. Feels underwhelming for a song telling me to dance

**runaway3212** (5): No thanks

**suffocatedbears** (4.5): i think there are too many rap parts in the song they kinda ruined it for me

**BebeLuigi** (4): it lacks a punch or something I was bored thorought

**DaBigBoi** (4): I wouldn’t dance to this

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (4): Yeah I don't think this group is for me lol.

**plastichaxan** (4): this is so annoying i'm sorry

**pleasegivemeasword** (4): This was one of my last favorite songs on the list but it’s still not lower than a four

**RandomHypnotica** (4): Going from HER to this in the playlist was a huge disappointment

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4): This is officially the spot in Block B's career where I decided that the side projects/solos are better.

**rickikardashian** (4): this streetwear mad max music video….

**Sedona83** (4): Strange beat but enjoyed rap

**skargardin** (4): we shall not

**10footnotes** (2): It’s not even so much actively bad as it is missing anything actively good. It also sounds half a decade older than it actually is: seriously, 2017?? Wtf??

**2dina3dworld** (1): I’m a proud BBC, but I have to admit that this just isn’t a good song. It’s somehow too abrasive and bland at the same time. It simultaneously sounds like they’re trying too hard, and not trying enough at the same time. It’s such a contradicting song, and my overall impression is just of a muddled mess.

**snugsnhugs** (1): kind of annoying, sorry

**bluetriangles04** (0): There are so many things about this song I don’t like. Whether it be the instrumental, the falsetto in the pre-chorus, the James Bond chorus with the humming in the background, the way the second verse completely discards any momentum from the song, etc.

**grey/0x976** (0): #no return it

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): Balladphobia strikes again!! I love this song and I really miss this melodramatic flair that was present in older K-pop. The eye makeup in the MV, the choreo, the shots in the water...groups these days just aren’t doing it!

**wavingwolves** (6.4): One of the songs from this rate that would randomly get stuck in my head at least twice a week since we first drafted the list. It doesn't make it amazing and it's not a song I would really seek out, but it's good. It helps showcase how k-pop 2nd gen idols had such a knack for midtempo angsty music or straight up trashy bops. But yeah, there's better midtempo ballads in this rate. Sorry, MBLAQ.

# Kings of the castle


**grey/0x976** (10): YASSS one of the best kpop songs ever i think :thots:y

**moonagenightmares** (10): make kpop boys dramatic again

**sssaaage** (10): the superior song w cry in the title, popheads better not let this tank

**suffocatedbears** (9.5): okay this is my first time listening to this song and i am slayed wtf

**jasannn** (9): A sexy and dramatic ballad.

**milkywayinradius** (9): can we have a discussion about how beyonce's lemonade underwater scene obv stole from this mv made in 2011?

**runaway3212** (9): Balladphobia will make this day 1 but it's amazing

**SlphWsp** (9): Hilarious cringy english intro, alien bleep bloops in the instrumental, underwater shots, dancing in the rain, smooth vocals, what more can you ask for?

**gabcac** (8.7): the song, the video, makeup, definitely a song of its time.

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): Seventeen, you are NOTHING

**hasanella** (8.5): better than i expected cause i had not heard of mblaq before which is a shame also the eyeliner in the rain was a perfect touch in the mv

**BoneStreetSand** (8.1): I just kinda appreciated everything about this song. Maybe because I cry every day lol

**bobaroma** (8): I don't know if I want to cry from nostalgia or cringe

**fadedblue09** (8): Cute R&B jam, holds up well compared to other songs from this era

**galaxy\_rae** (8): im surprised! I've known of mblaq but never really gave them a listen

**skargardin** (8): the dramatics of the mv sold the song a bit more to me

**taeneon** (8): i can't resist an emo bop

**Heedictated** (7.7): just not my style

**throwaway7650** (7.5): this was quite the grower, the chorus is pretty good

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i really like the verses but the chorus... eh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this gives me x factor winner first single

**PRADA** (7): it’s ok

# Live, laugh, Love

**jaskiwhere** (6.8): This is good it just feels like it goes on forever

**bulforster** (6.5): I want to like this more but the chorus mix is pretty claustrophobic.

**weappreciatepowers** (6.5): why yall hyping this up

**BebeLuigi** (6): it works but I'm not that into it

**HeartofDarkness123** (6): The cheesy bad kpop rap strikes again. I enjoyed the experience, but it isn’t particularly memorable.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is such a boy band song dajfdnk

**RandomHypnotica** (6): are they dancing in the tears of popheads raters?

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): I know a few MBLAQ songs, this is not one of them. Unrelated kinda but the one set in this video reminds me of TVXQ's Mirotic which really makes me want a late 00s K-Pop Boy Group Rate. Anywho I think I know why this was never uhhh mentioned when people talked about MBLAQ back in the day.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Feels a bit like early 00s western boybands. I was never really too into them.

**Jhe116** (5.9): We only need one sad dance pop song from MBLAQ and that song is This Is War

**celladonn** (5.5): This is a bit boring but I love their eye makeup in the video

**aestheticen** (5): This has made almost no impression on me

**foxinthenoodles** (5): Nostalgic almost to the point of not aging well. The vocal execution is just too melodramatic at times.

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): this gets so melodramatic it ends up drowning in itself, until the rap kicks in and then it’s suddenly revived.

**10footnotes** (4): Mm, it sure does sound like 2011 K-pop! (I.e. an instrumental made by putting half a dozen tissues into a blender.)

**bigbigbee** (4): I need to point out that in the MV for this there is one member, I think G.O., whose 5 o'clock shadow (facial hair) is extremely poorly covered up. To that man: Nice work! Congratulations on having a beard too powerful for foundation, and sorry about the idol market hairless agenda.

**bluetriangles04** (4): There are so many unlistenable soundbites within this sound for me. The digital keyboard notes? The water drops? The moaning in the background? The way the chorus suddenly picks up and leads the rest of the song in the dust before going back to a pace that feels even slower? I’m so confused.

**nyoom** (4): bye

**pleasegivemeasword** (4): I sort of liked it but it sounds a little outdated imo…

**throwawayforshady** (4): Probably the most boring MBLAQ song

**TiltControls** (4): i'm not usually a balladphobe, but i did not like this

**Sedona83** (3.5): Yet another forgettable R&B track

**elleyonce** (3): MBLAQ had some of the most dated, aged shit most of their career until the moment they were saved with Smoky Girl. Good god...

**snugsnhugs** (3): nostalgic power pop ballad but I don’t think I’d want to listen to it again sorryyyyyy

**useless-sheep** (3): boring

**Zypker125** (2): First time I’ve listened to this song. Unfortunately, I find it pretty boring. It’s not emotional/intense enough for the angsty vibe that it’s going for, and the song feels too “quiet”/empty for me to invest myself in. The song is also transitioned pretty poorly.

**ebooks #5454** (1): this song is too slow for me baby

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): If it wasn’t for the mixing on this (like why is the instrumental at the start so loud and grating lol), then this would be a 10 from me. This subunit is composed of iKon’s Bobby and Winner’s Mino and I think they work together/bounce off each other very well as rappers. I used to be obsessed (feel like I’m saying this about a lot of songs in the rate lol) with the MOBB album in 2018, Mino’s Body especially is great. Anyway, not surprised this is the first song out in the bonus rate as it’s basically everything that Popheads hate in one song (straight men, men rapping, men chanting, noisy instrumental, YG Entertainment)!

**wavingwolves** (7.7): I understand why this is the first out, but it's still kind of surprising to me. This isn't by any means the best song I've ever heard,  but something about the energy this brings is really captivating. It does feel like the kind of music a group of frat dudes would do, but I can't hate how bouncy and cool this sounds. Also, if you like this ~~and even if you don't~~, I definitely recommend [Body by Mino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlJHZJ8EqeA) from this same project, which is actually one of my favourite k-r&b songs.

**Sedona83** (9.5): Replayed and would put on playlist

**throwawayforshady** (9.2): Hype hype hyypeee pt. 2

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The production is absolutely sick

**BoneStreetSand** (8): I mean, I’d twerk to this at the club.

**hyphen-happy** (8): i haven't heard this song before?? gr88 tho

**milkywayinradius** (8): WHOA IS THAT'S CL, her appearance foreshadows the results of a future kpop girl group rate, appearing for 3 seconds then TWICE or black pink winning.

**sssaaage** (7.5): outsold most of winner + ikons discog probably

**fadedblue09** (7): The autotuned hook gets stale after a while but otherwise banger

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): I love the hype energy. I was absolutely vibing to the beginning but it started losing steam towards the end.

**Leixander** (7): dying at some of the voices in the background

**Zypker125** (6.7): The rap is absolute fire, but the auto-tuned vocals are an absolute tragedy.

**bluetriangles04** (6): I preferred Hit Me a lot more out of the two MOBB singles.

**hikkaru** (6): travis scott is that you???

**throwaway7650** (5.5): meh... although mino says oh-aew at like 1:54 :thots:

**Heedictated** (4.9): TOO LOUD it just felt like two macho guys who keep punching me in the face

**cherryices** (4.5): special guest vocals from donald duck

**foxinthenoodles** (4.5): Aggressive in an almost offensive way.

**cleopatroclus** (4.3): instrumentals trash and feel as if they're just thrown in with no actual coherent thought, but the rap is decent

**hasanella** (4): not for me

**nyoom** (4): i fucking hate the idiom "go to hong kong" for having an orgasm. really hope i grow out of thinking bobby is cute soon

**pleasegivemeasword** (4): Not really my style but not a bad song

**SlphWsp** (4): Another hard-hitting rap song that isn't my thing,  also not a fan of the mv concept

**jaskiwhere** (3.5): If I played this at a house party it would soon be empty so mino and bobby are simply liars

**celladonn** (3): This just gives me a headache

**skargardin** (3): yeah this isn't it at all :grinny:

**agentofscranton** (2): not those fart synths good lord

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2): So we all agree this is going out first right cause... uhhhhhhhhhh... I think we would be better off rating their individual verses from Epik High's 'Born Hater'...

**10footnotes** (1): Dying rubber duck type beat

**2dina3dworld** (1): this is messier than your average kpop dating scandal

**aestheticen** (1): Worst song in this entire rate, would give it a 0 if I could

**BebeLuigi** (1): this is bad...

**bobaroma** (1): .....

**DaBigBoi** (1): Feel bad for the Tanner’s

**moonagenightmares** (1): wish i could give this a 0

**snugsnhugs** (1): ugh I didn’t like this song the first time and I still don’t like it now

**weappreciatepowers** (1): unbearable, annoying chanting, nothing here is slaying

**wavingwolves** (6.1): This song grew on me so much I was looping it yesterday. I did a full 360 with this because I went from liking to disliking it because I felt like it was too long and all the sections sounded the same to liking it again because the BLOW YOUR MIND bit got stucked in my head in such a way that I felt like I NEEDED to listen to the song over and over again. So, I will say now: this is GOOD. It actually is, even if it does sound like a rehash of Sorry Sorry but that song is great so... this has to be good too, right? Oh, and yeah, Super Junior as a group are a mess. These guys are mostly rotten inside and they're not even the worst this rate has to offer since... Well, you'll see.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): I feel like after SuJu released Sorry Sorry in 2009, their career after that for a few years was just them releasing renditions of Sorry Sorry that gradually got less good. This is one of those renditions and the sad thing is that I actually would have given this a higher score if it just didn’t drag so much near the end. I was expecting this song to leave around here anyway due to how much we all hate the SuJu members...maybe it would have placed higher if SHINee or EXO sang it instead.

# [Hikaru Utada - Simple And Clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1nDzB1P8GM)


**plastichaxan** (11): this is too catchy for its own good

**BebeLuigi** (10): another contender for my 11, the iconicness of this track hello...

**DaBigBoi** (10): fuck suju, but this is such a good song

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Thank you Super Junior for giving us easy choreo

**endcreditouilles** (10): My sister is obsessed with Super Junior and now I definitely see why. This is simply, a bop.

**Jhe116** (10): Very iconic but the fact that Siwon could be a Trump supporter had me mortified (he already is a Reagan stan so this shouldn’t be so surprising but still)

**PSSST12** (10): Super junior is a group full of mysogynistic assholes but this was a classic I fear 😔

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what people call me when i tell them my music taste

**rickikardashian** (10): everything i’ve learned about super junior has been negative, but i WILL raise some hell when this goes out day 3 while shinee’s lucifer makes it to #8

**runaway3212** (10): "hey, im mr simple" *proceeds to give us only simple melodies\* true speaking king!

**Shinkopeshon** (10): BETTER BE-BE-BE-BE-BE-BE

**SlphWsp** (10): Oh I forgot how much I love this intro, the age of point choreos and the SM box, did not expect this song to age so well, still so fun and and catchy

**sssaaage** (10): im sorry i cant make it not bop

**throwawayforshady** (9.8): Was one of the first Kpop songs I really loved...

**BoneStreetSand** (9): I was twelve when this came out. Thought it was the coolest thing ever, and it still is super (junior) cool. Your fave could never.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Was Hikaru Utada shipping him and Mr. Clean in their song?

**jasannn** (9): I think my SM Bias is showing but this song is all hooks.

**Heedictated** (8.9): SJ's title tracks from Sorry Sorry to Sexy Free and Single could be a bit obnoxious in its repetitive chorus but you can't deny that it's catchy and the strong vocals from KRY elevated the song

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): unpopular opinion but Super Junior has some bops

**snugsnhugs** (8.5): honestly works so well because its suju, total earworm and so fun

**PRADA** (8.4): flop hags but this song slaps yasssss

**1998tweety** (8): big bop, sorry sorry outsold though

**bigbigbee** (8): I associate this song with the youtuber KevJumba

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Here we go with the most problematic group in all of K-pop for various reasons. I find it funny that for the legacy they have, they only have one song in this rate lmao. As much as I want to give my 0 to SuJu because...well, they are SuJu, this is too much of a bop even though this sounds like a watered-down BIGBANG song. But yeah, I don't mind if SuJu's only song in the rate goes out on Day 1 just because...I feel petty lmao.

**milkywayinradius** (8): BECAUSE YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY. god this song is not great but i'm giving it those nostalgia points. super junior once again showing off their god tier dance skills.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Other options that could have been picked for SuJu include but are not limited to: "GO KICK IT IN THE BUTT GO KICK IT IN THE" but make it Bond theme-y, "Sexy free and single, I'm ready to bingo", "Just close your lips and shut your tongue" the song where being Spanish is a personality trait, and that song with the video with the actress/model who was 14 and kissed one of the members so everyone went "uhhhhhhhhhhhh" after that came out. So yeah out of the early to mid 10s SuJu output I think this may have been the best choice! Anyways I will now ignore the fact that like every member in this group is shitty in their own way and bop for like 4 minutes because this song is stupid electro-pop fun.

**taeneon** (8): sorry (sorry) but this is amazing

**chenle** (7.8): this makes me feel like i'm actively being brainwashed

**ebooks #5454** (7.6): its not "sorry sorry" (which ik couldn't be here or else it'd get everyone's eleven) but its still very fun

**foxinthenoodles** (7.5): Ticks all the boxes for a pop song, but that's about it.

**HeartofDarkness123** (7.5): It’s catchy, and I’m like… ironically into it. Because it also kind of sounds dated. This song would show up next to the definition of guilty pleasure.

**nyoom** (7.5): this like sucks and also has big your boss with terrible politics who's really nosy about your love life because he thinks he's hip enough for you to be friends going ham at karaoke energy but i still kinda love it. ALRIGH MR SIMP. then again i once spent a forty-minute bus ride just listening to money machine over and over and if my headphones weren't sound-insulated my seatmate would probably be in jail by now

**galaxy\_rae** (7): the true sound of kpop in the 2010s!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): can we just talk about the album art lol

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this started as a ten and as the song went on, it slowly started going down in points

**Leixander** (7): not sure if i hate or love the production in this

**suffocatedbears** (7): i believe i'll like this alot more if i'm high

**cherryices** (6.8): hate to say this but it bops. choreo is atrocious though

**bear\_horse\_stork** (6.5): I actually really love Suju, just not this particular song, kind of a shame it's their only song on this list

**akanewasright** (6): This occasionally bangs

**celladonn** (6): This, Sorry Sorry, Lucifer, and Ring Ding Dong all have the exact same vibe

**CrimsonROSET** (6): that single cover looks like a gay club ad

**moonagenightmares** (6): this is the last song i gave a score to because i really couldn’t figure out what to do with this, one thing is certain though #wehateyousuju

**spacebunsailor** (6): I think my bias against the group played into it but oh well

**TiltControls** (6): this is just a little too... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... simple

**agentofscranton** (5.5): it’s just a not as good sorry sorry

**useless-sheep** (5.5): I thought this would be worse tbh

**Zypker125** (5.1): I can’t deny the hook/melody is catchy, but I don’t like to listen to it. It doesn’t sound “clean”, if that makes sense, and it feels kinda outdated. The autotuned vocals are also not to my liking.

**gabcac** (5): one of the first kpop songs i listened, sadly, it doesn't pass the time check

**hikkaru** (5): mixed onion

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): it’s catchy but also a little too repetitive for me

**rotating3Dtext** (5): los super jurasicos

**specialtrickholdA** (5): Average song by an awful awful awful group. Fuck Suju for life.

**Sedona83** (4): Need to vary up the beat

**thedoctordances1940** (4): It's ridiculously and incessantly annoying and would be a pretty obvious zero contender if it weren't for the fact that it's also kinda funny, enough so that I can give it a bit of a pass

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): I know only Sorry Sorry but this feels like a rehash that isn't half as good.

**jaskiwhere** (3): why were there like 5 different melodies that all sounded the same...this song went on for way too long...

**seanderlust** (2.5): this gives me a bit of a headache ngl. though i will say idk if it's the eurodance style synths in the background but i kind of want a 100 gecs remix where they just go apeshit with it. also I was playing it from my phone and my cat crossed the room and sat near it so I think he's a super junior stan

**fadedblue09** (2): This feels like an uninspired Sorry Sorry rehash

**throwaway7650** (2): this is catchy at times but that's it. other parts of the song are horrid and it drags on for way too long. also trash members [8]

**weappreciatepowers** (2): this is shit

**bespectacIed** (1): how is Sorry Sorry not the suju song chosen here lol it's too iconic. This sucks, cmon grandpas let's get you to bed

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i cant even pretend to be objective i have never liked super senior

**grey/0x976** (1): if i could give more than one 0 i would this song is so ass cheeks its not even fun in a camp way its just ass and i want suju to DISBAND. NOW.

**emmach17** (0): Might be one of the worst songs I've ever heard

**frogaranaman** (0): where do I even begin with this song? the production? the vocal performance? the annoying group chants? whoever greenlit this was not thinking

**hunnybee12** (0): genuinely hard to listen to for more than 30 seconds

**liberalitea** (0): this sounds like bad T-Pain

**rosecoloreds** (0): terrible seniors

**wavingwolves** (7.1): Sorry to Lorde, but I'm not tired to be told to put my hands up in the air. This one would fit greatly with the [Pop Rap Rate](https://redd.it/nqql6v), as many people pointed out. It's very of its time, but still a really fun trashy bop from our favourite beast idols (as in, just really hot jacked guys) 2PM.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): As many of you commented, this is definitely a song of its time. Although it’s certainly an iconic song and does bop a bit, I feel it’s deserving of its low placement and the other 2PM song in this rate is superior - and clearly you guys agree with that!

---

# Flo Rida fans

**DaBigBoi** (10): You heard them, PUT YOUR HANDS UP! My favorite trashy bop

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This banger still holds up…which is exactly what I'm doing with my hands rn

**milkywayinradius** (10): omg, check out that impressive choreo. this song is still fun and still makes me want to put my hands up, put my hands up, put put put put put-

**moonagenightmares** (10): this was released exactly a decade ago, devastating

**grey/0x976** (9): this song is straight out of 2011 and i think its perfect

**Jhe116** (9): Trash pop classic, but the fact that 2 out 6 2PM members have drunk driven before is outrageous

**taeneon** (9): omfg a bop no bg does it like them

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Idk how to describe it but 2PM is definitely what I expect from a JYP boy group because this song is so so infectious with high energy and it has a fun choreography.

**sssaaage** (8.5): so repetitive but idc it slaps

**Heedictated** (8.4): still remember all the words to this iconic song but terrible mv imo the effects got me so dizzy

**aestheticen** (8): Lorde is pressed

**akanewasright** (8): this is dated, but like… in a fun way

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): (If You Feel Love)

**elleyonce** (8): Obnoxious in the best way.

**PSSST12** (8): a CLASSIC but go crazy outsold as their go to party song.

**rosecoloreds** (8): timeless classic

**SlphWsp** (8): Straightforward party song still hits hard, extra point for horse head

**snugsnhugs** (8): ppppput your hands up!!! a banger tbh

**spacebunsailor** (8): solid mid 2000s bop

**throwaway7650** (8): ok wait this is camp... it can pass as a TVXQ! song tbh

**1998tweety** (7.5): I love Gwen Stefani - Crash

**agentofscranton** (7.5): taecyeon hospitalise me challenge

**BoneStreetSand** (7.5): This one triggers the nostalgia.

**foxinthenoodles** (7.5): A great song that can be the representative song of that era of kpop.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's slightly annoying, especially some of the vocals sound a little bit off, but I do still really quite like it

**PRADA** (7.3): it’s good

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): I like when they don’t take themselves seriously

**bobaroma** (7): Pupupupupu put your hand up!! Anyone familiar with Ji Suk Jin's Running Man cover?

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this is like kinda basic but also not bad

**DaHumanTorch** (7): this is dated but in a good way

**ignitethephoenix** (7): not bad but also kind of dated

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this is fun but is it me, or are their vocals off?

**pat-rickstar** (7): Definitely feels dated but it kinda bops

**weappreciatepowers** (7): SMAHSH

**rickikardashian** (6.8): tag yourself im the random white girls in the music video

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): 2PM may have made a party song, but it does not make me wanna party til 2AM.

**Zypker125** (6.5): This whole song and MV feels like a bunch of 40 year old dilfs trying to prove to the youngsters that they can hang. Not necessarily a bad thing, though.

**dekubaku** (6): Without looking at the dates, I knew this was from the 2010s. A bit dated now but it fits the sound of that time.

**ebooks #5454** (6): i love the lavish living vibes but this did not make me want to put my hands up

**queltemps** (6): Hype asf

**suffocatedbears** (6): iconic but not my cup of tea

# Lorde fans

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): as a club song, this works. But as anything more? It’s a bit too one note for that

**cherryices** (5.1): the MV made me think: who did this better? 2PM with hands up or JLS with the club is alive?

**BebeLuigi** (5): As a matter of fact we did not put our hands up

**nctdreamsqd** (5): This song was a little too repetitive for me

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): I’m pretty sure I’ve heard this song before but I had no idea it was by a Kpop group

**chenle** (4.5): i'm not gonna act like the chorus isn't catchy and makes me want to dance along with it every time i hear it, but why does the production sound so cheap... it's definitely 2011 but not in a good way

**cleopatroclus** (4.3): yeah this was too het for me sorry

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this is like if a show wanted to have an ‘impromptu party scene’ but none of the actors can really sing but there’s no money to dub them all so they pick and choose

**fadedblue09** (4): Apparently this was a chart topper in SK. Basically, I have the same feeling towards this like some of the early Wonder Girls songs: I acknowledge they're classics but now they sound like random throwaway songs from that era.

**bespectacIed** (3): Mess. Taecyeon top 5 hottest 2nd gen male idols though

**emmach17** (3): You can tell this was released in 2011

**HeartofDarkness123** (3): The refrain of the hands up isn't particularly catchy tbh, and it repeats way too much. It feels cheesy and dated in a way that isn't particularly endearing and I can't quite relate to the club lyrics that I understand.

**hyphen-happy** (3): 2pm have more iconic songs and the oppa ad lib is a -5 alone sry

**nyoom** (3): this song just has jyp's grubby palm grease all over it. 3 for how many minutes shorter it should've been

**seanderlust** (3): "don't stop tonight, empty all thoughts" never had any king x

**specialtrickholdA** (3): That chorus is not it...

**tiltheendoftheline** (3): Man that's why I don't listen much to 2nd gen (or is this early 3rd gen?). It sounds so muted and the song is dated, it wasn't even fun.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): this sounds like a demo of itself

**Sedona83** (2.5): Too repetitive

**10footnotes** (2): It’s very basic and anonymous: there aren’t really any interesting musical choices or ideas to care about here.

**runaway3212** (2): This is actually so truly terrible

# [DO THE POP RAP RATE!](https://redd.it/nqql6v)


**hunnybee12** (9): this LMFAO serve

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): is this a LMFAO song

**plastichaxan** (10): now this would be the 11 if it had that pitbull feature we talked about

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): omg its like the two june rates had a baby

**Roxieloxie** (8): we love the pop rap rate

**skargardin** (8): is this the pop rap rate

**bulforster** (7.6): I fully thought I had accidentally started the pop rap playlist for a minute, the record skipping effect is so stupid but I love it.

**TiltControls** (7.5): when did i wander into the pop rap rate

**jasannn** (7.3): Wait, I thought this was K-Pop BG Rate, not the pop-rap rate

**celladonn** (7): This would be right at home in the Early 10s Pop Rap Rate lmao

**frogaranaman** (7): thought I started the pop rap rate for a second

**galaxy\_rae** (6): Classic kpop vibes! So fun and VERY 2011 “Like a G6 tease”.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): I’m someone who believes ATEEZ only have a total of, like, 4 good songs in their entire discography and this is just not one of them! Still, ATEEZ are in fact one of the biggest 4th gen boy groups right now so they belong here with their peers TXT, Stray Kids, and The Boyz.

**wavingwolves** (0): I have mentioned in previous comments how I had to listen to certain songs so much to the point where even the ones I don't like grew on me, right? This was not the case of this song. Actually, every time I had to listen to this it make me like it less. I get absolutely no enjoyment out of this, but I'm still glad some of you seem to like this a lot more than I ever could.

---

# [Lady Gaga's voice] My name isn't Alice but I love Wonderland by ATEEZ

**emmach17** (11): The future leaders of the 4th gen

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song is straight fire. I will not accept any slander.

**celladonn** (10): One of my favourite songs from one of my favourite groups. I love when kpop goes big and theatrical, and this is about as over the top as it gets

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh so NOW we’re not ok with pots and pans

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This went so hard and I was not ready

**endcreditouilles** (10): The absolute SERVE this is. The music video is a work of art. I'm stunned.

**galaxy\_rae** (10): very strong coreo and mv i love the outfits/uniforms!!

**PSSST12** (10): Heard it for the first time yesterday, and now, that's a HYPE song.

**runaway3212** (10): I love how grandiose this sounds

**Sedona83** (10): Anthemic masterpiece, re-watched

**bobaroma** (9.5): slight cheesiness, but pirate concept done right

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this is just Confident by Demi Lovato (non-derogatory)

**twiceoftheheart** (9.5): Thank you for introducing me to this song in particular

**1998tweety** (9): I just know she's gonna get robbed, this is a HYPE song.

**BebeLuigi** (9): I love the contrast between what u'd expect from the title and the whole military parade thing going on in the song and mv. It doesn't hurt that the song is great too.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.9): Um, why haven't I listened to these guys before? I feel different now that I have. Straight to my playlist.

**Zypker125** (8.9): I prefer a lot of their other title tracks over this (ex. Wave, Say My Name, Inception), but this is still good. On the plus side, this is a straight anthem-banger that knows what it is, and the high notes and final dance break are killer. On the negative side, I feel like the chorus wasn’t high-energy enough compared to the pre-chorus’s lead up, and the second verse (with Mingi’s rap and Yeosang’s lines) drags.

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): SLAYTEEZ YASSSSSSS MINGI WOOYOUNG SAN HEY

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this is high camp, i fear it's just too advanced for some people on this sub. stan slayteez

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Unless I'm missing some context, this really isn't as bad as I'm led to think.

**elleyonce** (8): The Kingdom version is actually godtier. Kraken, amirite?

**Heedictated** (8): another one of ATEEZ's epic-sounding chorus

**hyphen-happy** (8): not my fav ateez song but it has been on my playlist before

**Jhe116** (8): Would be higher if “we must going on” doesn’t exist

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): I don’t follow Ateez super closely but this is one of my favorite title tracks by them

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I hear something

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.7): The song is okay but the chorus is really powerful that I wish the rest of the song sounded like this.

**aestheticen** (7.5): I know a lot of people shit on this song but honestly I like it lol

**HeartofDarkness123** (7.5): I always love ATEEZ's bombastic energy. The first part of the song with the vocals is excellent. Once it slows down to the chanting, I'm less of a fan. The chanting isn't particularly compelling, tbh, and I'm not a big fan of the brass either. Nonetheless, I love hype songs and ATEEZ never fails to get me excited. It's just not a song I seek out for myself, since the prechorus seems to kill the momentum too much.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i would let their marching band stomp over me

**useless-sheep** (7.5): slayteez

**dekubaku** (7): Okay, I remember listening to this before and not liking it. But listening to it now for the rate, it sounds good? Hala Hala still remains their top song for me but this has the Ateez sound I liked in Pirate King.

**hikkaru** (7): it's slayteez until the chorus/drop thing that rly knocks this song down a peg

**nctdreamsqd** (7): I liked the instrumental but Mingis rap pulled me out of the song

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): I like the chorus but that’s basically it

**seanderlust** (6.8): this is so big and maximalist - it feels like a villain's anthem in an RPG

**agentofscranton** (6.5): THE pirate strip club anthem

**PRADA** (6.5): yasssssssssssssssss

=====

wavingwolves: # [Olivia Rodrigo's voice] I'm so sick of ATEEZ, where's my fucking STRAY KIDS??

**throwawayforshady** (6.5): I never could get into Ateez... Not my type of music

**10footnotes** (6): I don’t love K-pop songs that lean fully into dark, angry and/or angsty concepts without flavoring them with some other type of more compelling emotion: that’s probably why “Answer” is my favorite thing I’ve heard from Ateez to date, since it sounds more triumphant and actively uplifting than most of their other title tracks. “Wonderland” is nicely executed, but IMO it is a bit loud for its own sake.

**suffocatedbears** (6): sounds very epic but i think i gotta be in the right mood to enjoy the song

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): loud production does not equal good. we must going on

**cremeebrulee** (5): there is just so much going on help

**frogaranaman** (5): why are they so intense what has them so ready for action

**jasannn** (5): Those verses really did all that work to lead up to this terrible chorus. This is no Miroh.

**pat-rickstar** (5): There's just too much going on here

**skargardin** (5): I think I would like this a bit more if it wasn't giving so much at every turn. The final chorus slaps though i have to say

**SlphWsp** (5): Way too much snare drum, no dynamics, great video but not feeling the song

**snugsnhugs** (5): the dance is really cool but the song is a bit loud and intense for me

**thedoctordances1940** (5): This reminds of Wellerman for some reason and I despise that song. There's just something pirate-y about it and I don't think I like that even though the production is great.

**TiltControls** (5): it's neat, but i don't actually know if I like it?

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): this is too much going on for me, it almost grabbed me sometimes though.

**cleopatroclus** (4.8): feared for my life, instrumentals kinda all over the place but still boring, maybe commendably so

**grey/0x976** (4): anyone publicly stanning ateez deserves a purple heart. That takes some serious courage

**nyoom** (4): i must going away from this fash shit

**hasanella** (3.5): i wish i liked this song more but it is not for me

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3.5): The first time I saw ATEEZ was when I turned into a random Music Bank episode and saw them promoting 'Pirate King' and decided it was the worst thing I had heard (at the time). I genuinely do love like "badass" and "hardcore" K-Pop but this just doesn't do it. Like it has its parts (mainly that pre-chorus... and the bridge ([SM stan moment](https://twitter.com/fauxwol/status/1405240940093227009?s=21)) but the rest... eh...

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.4): the chorus reminds me of Kill This Love but somehow worse. the buildup in the verses feels so wasted

**cherryices** (3.2): unfortunately didn’t find anything remotely likeable about this

**CriticalMove0** (3): ( I prefer their previous releases :( )

**foxinthenoodles** (3): Bloated and busy.

**jaskiwhere** (3): If I was Alice and this was wonderland I'd leave immediately why are they YELLING at me

**moonagenightmares** (3): the absolute state of edgy 4th gen bg music

**orbiteezus** (3): i sorta enjoy the prechorus and i kinda love that little part before the chorus where the guy's kinda growling into the mic over the little beeps but besides that everything else in this song is like actively trying to annoy me

**sssaaage** (3): san my little meow meow didnt serve on this i fear

**taeneon** (3): this sounds exactly what I would expect a boy group song to sound like and i don't mean that as a compliment

**throwaway7650** (3): unironically pots and pans ... wonderland actually does have some things going for it and to mingi's credit he doesn't sound totally atrocious in this (but still bad). the verses are decent melodically and the prechorus/bridge are even better, but the english lyrics, the unfortunate pirate concept, and the hilarity that is the chorus force me to tank this song

**specialtrickholdA** (2): I’ll never understand the ATEEZ hype, sorry... this is just a dime-a-dozen noisy boy group song.

**fadedblue09** (1.5): They really thought Kill This Love was worthy enough of a song to be ripped off, huh?

**bespectacIed** (1): co-flagbearers (along with skz) of 4th gen kpop noise. Atz is worse

**bulforster** (1): a disaster of a song

**ebooks #5454** (1): this has the same energy of going into a movie theater for a calm movie but all the trailers they play prior to are loud action/horror movies and you're just scared and confused and overstimulated

# :jointslay:

**akanewasright** (0): this song is flavorless

deleted: I don't mind noisy bg music, but there's nothing unique about Ateez's music as much as they are hyped by the k-pop community. Stray Kids personally aren't my faves either (some songs are really good though) but their style of noisy definitely feels unique to them.

Big-Contribution4567: Try again. The moment you stop thinking "they are hyped" and just listen to a group that's working hard as fuck maybe you'll treat them like artists rather than judging them the very first moment. 

And the reason their fandom hype them is because they have a very small platform, yet they give their all. Get in for some good pirate shanty god damn it.

=====

funimarvel: That's odd because I find ATEEZ's music very distinct. Part of it is definitely Mingi's voice but every time they release a song I think its overall production either sounds like ATEEZ or (rarely) it doesn't. Their title tracks Say My Name, Wonderland, Answer, Wave, Illusion, Hala Hala, Thanxx etc all sound distinctly ATEEZ to me. And the songs produced by their member Hongjoong are also distinctly his style imo (Horizon, Aurora, Desire etc). The only title tracks that didn't immediately sound like ATEEZ to me were Inception and Fireworks (and Fireworks is their only title track I actually disliked at first, in part due to it not sounding the way an ATEEZ title track usually sounds). I am a big fan of both Stray Kids and ATEEZ and other groups that make "noisy bg music" but these 2 have some of the most identifiable styles imo.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): I’m ashamed to say that if we did this rate in 2016/17 this honestly would have been an 11 contender for me. Idk why but back then I honestly thought it was the greatest song I ever heard lmao, but from my score you can see how my tastes have changed since then. The drop in the chorus honestly gets worse with every listen for me.

**wavingwolves** (1.5): AND HERE IT IS!! Our first BIGBANG song is finally out. In my opinion, this deserved worse. This song has absolutely no redeeming qualities, the MV is horrid and the presence of the members makes it even worse, since they have this kind of negative charisma that instead of draw you in it does the opposite. And oh, BIGBANG wins the Most Rotten Members of Any Group award! There was only five of them and that was already too much.

---

# This FUCKS!

**galaxy\_rae** (10): makes me feel good everytime i hear it!!

**1998tweety** (9): they have some nice tunes and this is one of them

**hasanella** (9): very pleasant

**runaway3212** (9): I hate how much I love this

**snugsnhugs** (9): overall fun song, favorite TOP rap after Digital Bounce by Se7en ft. TOP

**taeneon** (9): gd why do u have to have a shitty personality :(((

**throwawayforshady** (9): I love y'all

**bookthieving** (8.5): tell me you're an asian frat in 2017 without telling me

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): this is quirky (complimentary)

**fadedblue09** (8.5): They will get slaughtered but I hope this song does well (or at least their highest). Such a club mood bop.

**Heedictated** (8.4): killer prechorus and chorus but verses a little forgettable

**BebeLuigi** (8): Honestly surprised I'm rating it this highly I remembered not minding it much but it's actually quite good lol

**jasannn** (8): One of the better chill, vibey songs in Kpop.

**Sedona83** (8): Catchy fun, enjoy the rap

**ebooks #5454** (7.8): BIGBANG was so successful yet they could never afford good hairstyles me thinks

**foxinthenoodles** (7.5): Masterful rapping on a good song.

**jaskiwhere** (7.5): Bigbang may be one of my least favorite boy groups ever, but this song is actually so good. UGH

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Funk it? So True

**throwaway7650** (7.5): love the prechorus, the best BIGBONG song present (although this group might be setting the bar for trash men in this rate [4]

**BoneStreetSand** (7.4): This was really boring, but not bad.

**seanderlust** (7.2): so i'm using the english translation of lyrics and are they rhyming the korean phrase for "screw it" with the english "I wanna get down"? that is hella clever

**2dina3dworld** (7): Fxxk it, I’m proud to admit that some Bigbang songs really do slap

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): Not really into TOP’s verses. The prechorus and the chorus are absolutely lovely, and I really like them, but everything else kind of sucks.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the vocal effects are so unnecessary and it’s just a weird pace

**Zypker125** (6.7): The chorus drops are decently catchy, but the verses are too low-energy for me. The raps and vocals are decent, but this song feels like it’s trying to rip off The Chainsmokers, except the dance-pop isn’t as catchy.

# This SUCKS!

**Jhe116** (6.5): Not iconic enough to distract me from the existence of S*ungri

**CrimsonROSET** (6): chainsmokers

**frogaranaman** (6): did they lift these synths from the Flume remix of Tennis Courts

**TiltControls** (6): at least this one is passable

**akanewasright** (5): I don’t hate all of this. I do hate a good chunk of it though :)

**bespectacIed** (5): one of their tolerable songs, the synth riff is cute. Still a mess in general

**dekubaku** (5): Listening to the song, I could hear Teddy's influence and tbh, he has done so much better in other songs.

**PSSST12** (5): Meh. A little bit too generic for them and doesn't go anywhere

**SlphWsp** (5): Generic, repetitive, nice use of colour in mv

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): I was liking it until the chorus... Also wasn't a fan of the bridge.

**cleopatroclus** (4.2): some overused samples but less torturous, more boring, rapper sounds roughly 50 years older than he probably is, maybe that’s what was fucked

**10footnotes** (4): The final drop is both the worst and best part of this song.

**skargardin** (4): besties this is not it

**bulforster** (3.7): I feel like the chorus thinks it has more energy than it does...

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3.5): This was my least favorite song from the MADE series when it came out. Maybe I made points. I can say one thing tho, at least it's not Bae Bae aka that song where it sounds like GD may spit out the N word any minute!

**rickikardashian** (3.5): travel vlog background music

**grey/0x976** (3): this is horrid ive #CHANGED my mind yg deserves to be put behind bars for debuting this group

**RandomHypnotica** (3): the instrumental is decent, but everything about this is so cringey

**suffocatedbears** (3): nope

**moonagenightmares** (2): if this was released by another bg no one would’ve cared

**nyoom** (2): "you're not like that lame girl over there"/"secretly I'm just vermin easily bored by every girl" / "you and me riding in the same car, you're drunk so get a some shut-eye, should we go rest somewhere? baby i'll just hold your hand to sleep, but it's obvious what i mean honey honey, but i want it and you know it" https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnLEcaCn1EIrGjm/giphy.gif

**PRADA** (1): wtf

**DaBigBoi** (0): Underwhelming drop, bare and uninteresting production overall

**sssaaage** (0): literally everything about this song is horrible.. the drop ruined my life made me cry etc i cant think of a song i hate more than this

**useless-sheep** (0): I expected at least a bad song that you could call camp from this edgy title but it's just bad without the camp… the rap verses feel awkward and the chorus is repetitively terrible

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): The chokehold this song had me in a few years ago...it’s grown off me a bit now, but I still love it. @ 4th gen groups: this is how you do “noise music” well.

**wavingwolves** (6.8): I fully understand why this places here, but I still like it. The intro feels reminiscent of the recent Stray Kids hit God's Menu, and if that comparison doesn't make you think a little more fondly about this song I don't think anything will.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): zero for conduct, maybe, but 10 for good music

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): I absolutely love the intensity.

**nyoom** (10): straight slap but this does pump up block b's shitty high school punks aesthetic way into "shitty high school punks squatting behind the 7/11 smoking in their school uniforms but you accidentally made eye contact with one of them and now they're all looking at you and getting to their feet" territory. really gets that heart racing

**queltemps** (10): this song always hits

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): This and 'Make It Rain' (their follow-up to this) are absolute classics to me. Two badass songs, but we're only talking about 'Zero for Conduct' so back to that one. I was idk shocked when this dropped because it was like... no song I had really experienced at the time and it was just so cool and badass that it blew me away. Still kinda does cause I lose it after not hearing this for a while and then hearing it again. (Also still lowkey obsessed with all the looks from this era.)

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): broke: "BTS copied this song!!1!" woke: "GO GET UR FREAK ONNN GO GET UR FREAK ONNN"

**Heedictated** (9.4): always put on this song to feel like a badass

**throwawayforshady** (9.2): Hype hype hyypee

**Leixander** (9): RING THE ALARM I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS TOO LONG BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I SEE ANOTHER CHICK ON YOUR ARM

**throwaway7650** (9): the beginning of this sounds like concrete... anyway the chorus goes hard af, bonus points for not having zico!

**BebeLuigi** (8): this is fun

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): Again… I had no clue this was a Kpop song

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The song structure of this reminds me of 4minute - Crazy

**seanderlust** (7): toxic masculinity

**BoneStreetSand** (6.9): This ain’t really it boys.

**jaskiwhere** (6.5): This is good but I must remove a point for men being men

**cherryices** (5): 2015 mic drop

**foxinthenoodles** (5): I see what they were going for. They didn't succeed. The song is pretty messy.

**moonagenightmares** (5): lowering the score after seeing the mv i hate men so much

**Sedona83** (5): Wanted to like it but fell flat

**SlphWsp** (5): WHAT did I just watch, not my kind of sound but this mv is a trip, scantily clad slaughterhouse girls and suddenly vampires??? Stylists had fun with this one

**cleopatroclus** (4.5): this is one 'e' from Beastarz so -2 for that (i'm jk, it's just rly not good)

**Zypker125** (4.5): FOr how high-energy it is, it’s surprisingly unmemorable and lacking in impact. The rap doesn’t work for me, and the autotune vocals fail for me as well.

**hasanella** (4): just not feeling it but i like the bridge

**pat-rickstar** (4): This is too much

**aestheticen** (3): Three for This Song

**weappreciatepowers** (3): horrible drop, not good, horrible rapping, IT SUCKS.

**snugsnhugs** (2): maybe could work for me on a running/workout playlist but don’t like it. Only redeemable thing is the chorus

**sssaaage** (2): this is actually so bad.. the drop in quality from the other block b songs here to this

**10footnotes** (1): Oh, are the men being angry and objectifying women again?

**taeneon** (1): giving this a 1 because i hate the mv

**wavingwolves** (10): How many of the groups in this rate has covered this song in some capacity? Because I would say at least 60% of them. This song was a HUGE hit and has been a staple for boy groups ever since it was first released in 2015 and it's still one of the most impactful songs in this list. I personally liked this since it was released and I think it's one of the biggest highlights of BIGBANG's career. I think the hook throws people off, but I always loved a good switch-up and k-pop artists usually do those amazingly. In any case, fuck these guys. I can't really be mad this places here because they're so polarizing and off-putting, and their music does follow that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): I honestly can’t help but burst into laughter when the chorus happens. This song is honestly so awful but it just bops. It’s camp! What can I say! Literally the epitome of “gay people when the worst song you’ve ever heard comes on”. Also the outro is the best part of the song, idc what anyone else says

---

# [T.O.P.'S voice] BANG BANG BANG!


**akanewasright** (10): WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS GARBAGE

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): MADE was definitely their peak, huh?

**DraculaWeekend** (10): BANG BANG BANG

**endcreditouilles** (10): why are all of their music videos so unapologetically insane i fucking love it

**grey/0x976** (10): this song is so ass like it takes genuine talent and skill to put together something this garbage tier 😭 that bridge is abysmal

**hyphen-happy** (10): would i ever look up this song to listen to? absolutely not. still a ten tho

**PSSST12** (10): listen, I hate big bang (most especially seungri) as much as the other person. For me they are the ultimate example of male privilege in K-pop. That said, I can't make the music not bop.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): I wasn't planning on giving this a 10 but the partying spirit broke out of me and now I'm just fucking remembering how much of a banger this is.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): when they said "bang bang bang" I really felt that

**sarcasticsobs** (10): T.O.P.

**skargardin** (10): camp

**useless-sheep** (10): gay people when the worst song youve ever heard comes on

**Zypker125** (9.6): That’s what we say to all the haters of this song. On the other side, though, this MV is god awful as per the usual YG style, but fortunately, we’re just grading the song here.

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): LET THE BASS RUN, GO

**BebeLuigi** (9): Iconic

**bobaroma** (9): Straight shot

**bookthieving** (9): i hope everyone else is tanking this but i'm sorry this song makes me go insane

**celladonn** (9): A bang bang banger. Fuck Seungri though

**cremeebrulee** (9): im assuming this is going out first of the BB songs so lemme just get this out of the way now— most of my exposure to kpop prior to popheads has been through whatever group my best friend at the time was into. bigbang was the first group she stanned, so naturally it was my introduction as well. i cant say that their music is good (and this rate has proved that we could have been listening to better groups at the time skdkdk) but what can i say other than this occupies the part of my brain thats nostalgic for the early 2010s ..... hence the good scores. anyway theyre kind of set up here with these choices LMAO but their better stuff predates the 2010s so i forgive u belb and gucci

**foxinthenoodles** (9): Another legendary song that only BIGBANG could have made. The last minute of the song should be in the kpop hall of fame.

**hunnybee12** (9): i'm so sorry it just hits

**plastichaxan** (9): banger

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this is literally breaking my mind because i can’t decide if i love this or hate it (i’ll be generous and decide i love it)

**Heedictated** (8.7): hype from beginning to start I can listen to Daesung singing Valhalla for 1 hour on loop

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): bangerz

**bluetriangles04** (8): Every K-Pop group in existence has covered this song.

**BoneStreetSand** (8): Such a banger, but it just feels 1 minute too long.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this turns into a COMPLETELY different song in the last minute and i’m extremely into it?

**ebooks #5454** (8): i actually know many of the songs on this list bc in HS, there were two kpop dance clubs that my "friends" were a part of that they did covers of for school performances (i will be mentioning them a lot in this rate bc there is trauma). this was a big group number they did to end the multicultural show once and there were so many people crammed onto this stage but  only 3 of them were good dancers so i associate this song with just being so so so so messy.

**jasannn** (8): I still don't know how I feel about that drop.

**Leixander** (8): yeah it's me jessie and ari, if they test me they sorry

**taeneon** (8): ugh kind of a bop

**fadedblue09** (7.7): Not sure if I should be proud of the fact that I recognize this song from start to finish

**aestheticen** (7.5): This song would be the "hype song" during my school events. I still remember during a camp (same camp where I danced to "Likey" and got endlessly teased for), we decided to do a little dance to this song as a class during the campfire performance, so it gets extra points for that. After all, I'm a very sentimental person ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): this was awful but i was bopping

**throwawayforshady** (7.5): It's iconic but I find it just OK as a song

**sssaaage** (7.3): this is horrible tbh but it bops

**moonagenightmares** (7): the chorus slaps, shame the last minute is absolute ass

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): The last minute elevates the song to another level

**snugsnhugs** (7): its basically fantastic baby 2.0 but still a banger imo

**rosecoloreds** (6.5): can't listen to this song anymore after seeing a tiktok with caption 'why does the beginning sound like autotuned farts'

**throwaway7650** (6.5): GD is unbearable [2] but this bops a bit [2]

wavingwolves: # [GD's voice] BEEAAIIN- [GUNSHOTS]

**1998tweety** (6): I hate anti-choruses so this never really did it for me

**jaskiwhere** (6): Blackpink could've sang this and tbh it would've been better

**rickikardashian** (6): the worst parts of this songs are worthy of a 0, the best parts of this song are worthy of an 11

**nyoom** (5.5): TIL it's "like you've been shot" and not "like you're mazinger." deserves a 1 for that but i am a generous god. song's still fucking stupid tho (+"male class, female pretenses" 🙃), stream akmu's random play dance 05:44 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7E1refmmOc

**PRADA** (5.2): aged too but BANG BANG BANG!

**seanderlust** (5.2): i'm so sorry but i hate this chorus. idk why the guy saying "bang bang bang" sounds like "FACK"-era eminem to me but he does

**2dina3dworld** (5): really did not age well, but it still does kinda bang

**orbiteezus** (5): i haven't been able to enjoy bigbang because g-dragon's voice is just unlistenable to me but i kinda like the first half of this song and the drop is pretty fun too but the rest of it is such a snoozer

**Sedona83** (5): Felt like two different songs

**cleopatroclus** (4.6): idk why but this song gives me 2nd hand embarrassment

**HeartofDarkness123** (4.5): TOP’s verses slap in this one. I’ve never liked this chorus though. It’s not as weirdly catchy as Fantastic Baby and G-Dragon’s nasality is extra grating here in both the “bang bang bang” and his verse. Also knocking it points for the sexist lyrics that I’ve become unpleasantly aware of.

**cherryices** (4.2): last minute or so is good

**frogaranaman** (4): there were like fifteen ideas in a three minute span and none of them were executed properly

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): the one time I wanted a big, explosive chorus, it didn't deliver.... I'm unsatisfied.

**bigbigbee** (3.5): GDragon's fucking kazoo voice is never more pronounced than in this song and I can't stand it. beaing beaing bEAAIING

**rotating3Dtext** (3): the points are just for the breakdown at the end

**TiltControls** (3): Bing bang bong stays winning

**weappreciatepowers** (3): the camp drop won't save the verses from being so bad lord

**bulforster** (2): This was a 6.5 until the chorus, the extra point is mostly for the outro.

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): The worst hook I've ever heard, Jesus Christ... The outro is kinda fun.

**10footnotes** (1): I hear a lot of Blackpink’s worst impulses in this: consequently, I will be giving it a low score. The more I listened, the more I lowered my score—excellent, that’s prime Teddy Park material right there. If I ever meet that man, it’s on sight.

**hikkaru** (1): i hate this song so much bc it starts off as a bop but the drop is quite possibly the worst thing i've ever heard, a true assault on the ears. the way they say "bang bang bang" and that weird synth sound that legitimately makes me feel uncomfortable #BIGBANG_OUT

**runaway3212** (1): God this is beyond terrible

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I was ready to give this a 10 cause I remember it was in Just Dance but this is so bad??? Like what the fuck?? The worst production in the rate by far.

**Jhe116** (0): A tiring punchline of Fantastic Baby, a loser to Love Me Right by EXO during the great collapse back in 2015, also S*ungri

**pat-rickstar** (0): That drop is just… awful. This song got stuck in my head for the rest of the day after scoring it so I hate it even more now

**SlphWsp** (0): Most annoying kpop song in existence, the intro is so promising and then the beng beng beng starts, not even Parris Goebel can save it pls everyone stop covering this abomination my poor ears

**specialtrickholdA** (0): No... this is just cringe.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): What can I say...I was one of the few people who loved this song in 2017 and I still love it now! I’m not surprised it placed this low because most of NCT 127’s titles are quite controversial (the concept of NCT as a whole tbh) but I find everything about this song so haphazard and yet it still somehow works. 

**wavingwolves** (7.9): Nothing is sadder than when they sing "IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT CLAP YOUR HANDS YO" and NO ONE claps it, meaning that all of these boys are sad, downcast, miserable as hell. But anyway... my favourite NCT 127 title track is Touch, which says a lot about my taste, but this is my favourite era for them. Visuals were strong, choreo was powerful and fun to watch and the b-sides of this mini are their best. They really peaked here and I don't see them doing better than this anytime soon, which is kind of sad, but at least they got to have this.

# 👏👏👏

**2dina3dworld** (11): this is the biggest hit in this rate!

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, a cultural reset that will unfortunately get robbed here

**bobaroma** (10): ppall pihae cherry bomb flick yum

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of my most played kpop songs and an 11 contender

**jaskiwhere** (10): They might not be the biggest hit but they certainly gave us a hit

**milkywayinradius** (10): IF YOU HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT, CLAP YOUR HANDS, YO

**moonagenightmares** (10): this was the best era to be an nctzen from the teasers, to the mv and album, to the insanity when the translation of the whiplash lyrics dropped #someonewhiptaeyong

**PSSST12** (10): 2017 was not ready for this bop 🤧 that instrumental is absolutely gorgeous and yes, I AM the biggest hit on the stage. 😤

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): :yassgrenade: me when I’m the biggest hit on this stage

**seanderlust** (10): I love a good song that makes me listen closer to figure out what is happening in the lower register

**throwawayforshady** (9.7): Has the greatest instrumental I have ever heard

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this is like a very lite hyperkpop and i’m here for it

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): Funfact, in the video for this they use that record rewind sound BROCKHAMPTON always uses so it lowkey always throws me off if I'm not paying attention. Anywho, if you've tried that move at the end where they spread their legs out and get low and failed, raise your hand! 🙋🏻‍♂️

**weappreciatepowers** (9.5): this is so fucking good if u disagre WE REALLY DGAF

**Heedictated** (9.2): thanks for giving birth to mark's iconic fancam

**elleyonce** (9): IF YOU HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT CLAPS YOUR HANDS YO!!!!

**hyphen-happy** (9): mark has one of my all time personal fav rap verses in this

**jasannn** (9): I can't make this not bop.

**orbiteezus** (9): the beat's rough edge is something i really enjoy, and despite not being the biggest fan of taeyong's voice i think that little growling tone he has in his rapping does work really well with the beat here that would make him sound slightly off (but still enjoyable) in more smoother NCT songs

**plastichaxan** (9): facts: just make a song named cherry bomb and trust i’ll like it i guess

**sssaaage** (9): this is one of the first songs that got me into kpop n its still so good.. it drags a bit but thats it

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): it goes soooo hard. But this is kpop at it's finest using the performance to make the music even better. Hard to not love it.

**celladonn** (8.5): This absolutely should not work but somehow it does

**grey/0x976** (8.5): this was the first nct song i ever heard and it made me not listen to their music for like 2 years

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): I swear I’ve listened to this before and hated it but it’s actually good??? What?

**gabcac** (8.1): the live version make the song better

**BebeLuigi** (8): I'm not a fan of these trappy kpop songs usually but this one just works

**bluetriangles04** (8): 2 points docked for “If you’re happy and you know it clap your hands.”

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): NCT is well-known for releasing some...interesting title tracks that felt experimental. I have a feeling this is going to grow a lot on me if I listen to this more.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I love BROCKHAMPTON.

**Sedona83** (8): Bopped my whole way through

**spacebunsailor** (8): love the messy noise

**thedoctordances1940** (8): So true, stream Tyler, the Creator

**useless-sheep** (8): embarrassing that this was one of the first boy group songs i heard and it was because of the loona dance cover

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): the bridge and rap verse elevates this so much, the rest of the song is just okay

**universemates** (7.5): I actually quite like their discography but this song is not for me. Kick It and Touch are their best title tracks and they have some great b-sides.

**10footnotes** (7): Choreo? 10. The actual song? …It’s complicated. Yes, it’s kind of bad, but at the same time it is really good at being what it is. (That was actually the sales pitch for NCT as a whole… boy, are they good at being what they are).

**galaxy\_rae** (7): i’ve been THIIIIIIS close to stanning nct because i like the concept

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): Honestly, it kind of vibes. The robotic voice, Markyong’s verses, and the “if you’re happy and you know it clap your hands” gives off a very specific energy and I’m into it.

**hunnybee12** (7): there’s like 3 chrouses in this song and i only really like 1

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): Adding more points simply for how iconic the last 30 seconds are with the splits


# [Silence]

**PRADA** (6.5): it’s a standard bg song but the dance serves

**foxinthenoodles** (6): Tried to go too hard, and only it only worked half the time. The production is commendable and the swagger is present, but not effective.

**akanewasright** (5): I wanna 0 this and also 11 it.

**cherryices** (5): kind of picks up in the second half but this isn’t really for me

**throwaway7650** (5): taeyong's first appearance in the rate... I don't enjoy his rapping among other things I dislike about this (why are there 32 instances of "biggest hit" and no I'm not happy or going to clap my hands yo). the vocal line's parts are good enough to save this song from a bad score

**aestheticen** (4): Bombed indeed

**cremeebrulee** (4): a point for every time i audibly laughed during this song (ebooks can confirm)

**CrimsonROSET** (4): WHERE DO I SIGN TO STOP ANYONE FROM REFERENCING NURSERY RHYMES IN SONG EVER AGAIN

**CriticalMove0** (4): ( Overplayed :( )

**lonelyglory** (4): Every time I hear "If you're happy and you know it clap your hands" I have to try not to dock more points. That being said sometimes I almost think I like it.

**skargardin** (4): this is a mess skull

**nyoom** (3): i can't stand this stupid ass song, it sounds like the composer woke up from a bender and frankensteined it together out of four different rejected bits when they remembered the deadline was tomorrow

**Zypker125** (2.7): I really don’t like NCT’s experimental songs. The verses are absolutely tragic and ruin the catchy choruses. Nothing about this song works from a musical perspective, “If you’re happy and you know it clap your hands” is absolute cringe, and Mark’s rap verse goes on for way too long. The wolf-cry instrumentals are also terrible.

**frogaranaman** (2): Tyler, The Creator sounds different here

**hasanella** (2): i am so sorry but cherry bomb will never have an ounce of my love but i have heard it so many times i do not know if i love or hate it

**runaway3212** (2): Im rating this higher because I like cherrys but this is a 0

**SFbby** (2): Not clapping my hands for this :(

**suffocatedbears** (2): i dont get why this song is one of their better known title, only the bridge is listenable. The choreo is cute i guess

**DaBigBoi** (1): I originally gave this more due to being unconventional, but I realized that doesn’t necessarily make it work

**ebooks #5454** (1): i feel threatened by this

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): how is this simultaneously a bop and the worst song i've ever heard

**snugsnhugs** (1): its unique I give it that, but I don’t like it

**fadedblue09** (0): This just sounds so hideous in a way I can't explain

**IzzyBP** (0): I just don't like it :(

wavingwolves: # Obligatory orbit's section 

**bespectacIed** (10): I don't get why this song is polarizing, this is my favorite NCT song ever, including all subunits. "I'm the biggest hit on the stage" is the cuntiest line ever uttered in kpop bg history. Very cunty choreo too; loona's dance cover of this is EXCELLENT

**specialtrickholdA** (8.5): Discovered this through LOONA’s dance cover of it, still goes off tbh.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): go watch loona’s dance cover of this

**SlphWsp** (6): Not a sound that I enjoy except for the bridge, iconic choreo but hits harder when LOONA cover it

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): this score is for what this song singlehandedly did to LOONA's title tracks

**rickikardashian** (0): LOONA NOOO!!! I SAID I WANTED YOU TO COVER LOVE BOMB BY FROMIS_9 NOT THIS!!!!

**wavingwolves** (8): I can't in good conscience not give this song a good score because of the absolute pure meme material it is. I mean, the "boomshakalaka" section? A moment. This is just really fun (and funny) and it was basically inescapable if you browsed through YouTube during the early '10s. It went viral, and for good reason, I suppose? Visuals were strong, the song was memorable and you had only two options after you watched it: to love or to hate it. I loved it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): This was actually the first K-pop song I ever heard (minus Gangnam Style ofc) - if you had any friends that were even just casually into K-pop, you could honestly not escape this song. Like every pre-teen, I had my embarrassing phases and one of them ended up being anime when I was 12 years old. Of course, my school also had an Anime Club and at the end of one of our sessions, one of the club leaders played this song right after and (mostly) everyone was jamming along to it. I’m not sure what it says about this song that I only started looking into K-pop a whole 2 years later :soobcry:

# DANCE! WOOOoOOOOOoOOOO

**celladonn** (10): This was the first kpop song I ever loved so I simply have no choice but to give it a ten. Fuck Seungri though

**cremeebrulee** (10): TOP if you’re reading this i am free on thursday night if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out i am free to hang out on thursday night so if you want to hang out on thursday night i am fr

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song was really popular that it was even a hit in a country I used to live where K-pop isn't that popular yet. I have seen most of the popular K-pop boy group music videos during this era when this MV came out and this one easily stood out because of its strong EDM production and the Gaga-inspired aesthetic. I feel like if the West wasn't as judgmental to K-pop in the early 2010s, BIGBANG would have the same success as BTS right now. This is essentially the aesthetic of the early 2010s summed up in one music video.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song still sounds like it's from the future

**gabcac** (10): this song was considered to be the kpop anthem back then, even if you didn't like bigbang you knew this song

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): This one I might be actually blinded by nostalgia for LOL since I liked it since the Buzzfeed series on kpop came out, way before I got into it... And it's honestly still catchy. I love the looks in the MV.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is probably the first K-Pop song I came across on the internet.

**letsallpoo** (10): this is the greatest song of all time

**milkywayinradius** (10): TOP in that ice blue hair, yes pls. seungri, no thanks

**SFbby** (10): Holy shit blue-haired dude

**SlphWsp** (10): Autotune done right, so much fun, stylists hair and makeup really created some iconic looks in this mv

**snugsnhugs** (10): so iconic, so legendary, changed kpop forever

**BoneStreetSand** (9.5): Wow, fantastic baby.

**foxinthenoodles** (9.5): Hits hard in all the best ways. Too many iconic parts to count. Deserves its legendary status.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the way this is the first kpop song I heard from stumbling on it on YouTube in high school (prior to Gangnam Style). It’s very much a product of it’s time but ngl it definitely help paved the way for the future kpop boom and has an iconic formula

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this is just a LMFAO song

**Zypker125** (9.4): Anyone who doesn’t like this song doesn’t like good music and can get whipped by G-Dragon’s red hair from this MV. Honestly though, this MV is an absolute dumpster fir. However, the EDM drops and Boom Shakalaka’s are absolute bangers that no one can deny.

**endcreditouilles** (9.1): the music video is what I want the future to look like

**bobaroma** (9): boom shakalaka. boom shakalaka.

**chenle** (9): *shudders*

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is awful

**hyphen-happy** (9): not even a fav but iconic

**Leixander** (9): had to subtract 0.5 points for the boom-shaka-laka line because was that really necessary???

**plastichaxan** (9): this is camp

**sarcasticsobs** (9): T.O.P. went in on this

**skargardin** (9): WOW. FANTASTIC

**spacebunsailor** (9): iconic even if the actual group is awful

**1998tweety** (8.5): a lot of BIGBANG's music is incredibly dated but it still bops

**Heedictated** (8.2): still a good song but got so overplayed at a point in between their hiatus that it got annoying for me plus the image of seungri with a bunch of girls in the mv was eh offputting

**akanewasright** (8): This feels like the Black Eyed Peas on steroids or something. Like it’s bad but it’s the kind of bad that would go off at a party.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Pitbull wishes.

**elleyonce** (8): YEOGI MOTHERFUCKING BUTEORA... This BIGBANG selection resembles each other in sound, and if I have to pick my BIGBANG noise track, I'd rather have BOOM SHAKALAKA off one of kpop's best EPs ever than Bang x3.

**jasannn** (8): This is probably carried by nostalgia.

**Jhe116** (8): Iconic enough to distract me from the existence of S*ungri

**lonelyglory** (8): It's still supremely danceable even if I can't emotionally bring myself to listen to BB songs nowadays. Also T.O.P is impeccable here.

**PSSST12** (8): A BOP but it didn't aged well for me.

**runaway3212** (8): I hate how much I like this

**taeneon** (8): so firstly FUCK seungri and the other members who seem to support him. they're all trash imo. however, from an objective view of the song and as someone who used to be a huge fan, this is kinda a bop

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Kind of a banger still tbh. Boom shaka laka indeed.

**nyoom** (7.5): big bang is shit and i wish i hated this but it does hit ngl. #freeseungri from this mortal coil, violently

**Sedona83** (7.5): Experimental, fun, good rap

**universemates** (7.5): I personally prefer Blue as the single from the album but ngl the "Wow Fantastic Baby Dance I Wanna Dance Dance Dance" is catchy af.

**emmach17** (7): I walk around the house saying 'Wow, fantastic baby' all the time

**galaxy\_rae** (7): it’s iconic but also very 2012.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): This is the same universe as the Party Rock Anthem M/V but 5 years later

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): boomshakalaka

**DaHumanTorch** (6.8): i hate that i kinda actually liked this....it was giving black eyed peas

**rickikardashian** (6.8): im starting to think that i simply am not capable of fully comprehending the genius of bigbang’s songs which is why im just left so disoriented as to how im supposed to feel about anything related to them

**cherryices** (6.5): kind of insufferable but a banger simultaneously

wavingwolves: # I googled "fantastic antonyms" for this but decided against it

**seanderlust** (6.1): ever hear a song and be like "yep, this was released in the early 2010s"?

**BebeLuigi** (6): Bang Bang Bang outsold as BIGBANG party anthem

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): wow this production aged like milk but i can move to it so

**dekubaku** (6): Wow! Fantastic, BB! Except Seungri, who can GTFO.

**suffocatedbears** (6): iconic noise i guess

**fadedblue09** (5.7): It's hard for me to take this seriously anymore thanks to overplay and memes (here in my country, at least) but it still has a certain charm.

**throwaway7650** (5.5): GD is unbearable but this bops a bit

**aestheticen** (5): Except it’s not fantastic

**hasanella** (5): i can not take this song seriously but it was pretty good and achieves what it set out to do

**liberalitea** (5): this is 100% an LMFAO song

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): I know this song is iconic and it’s not a bad song but I can’t really get into it

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): this is what I thought all kpop sounded like. And the reason I didn't give it a chance until last year lol really not my thing, but it's a fun party song

**ebooks #5454** (4): i remember being 13ish when this came out, and BIGBANG had been on break for a while and i was so excited they were back, and then they produced this garbage and i IMMEDIATELY stopped listening to kpop for 7 years.

**frogaranaman** (4): if we were still in the 2008 housing recession I would love this song

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): naega jael jal naga

**pat-rickstar** (4): This is almost so bad it's good territory, but I think I need to be watching the mv to add that extra layer of camp that allows me to enjoy this

**PRADA** (4): aged but some parts still slap

**bulforster** (3.9): I am very thankful to this rate that this song is no longer my main reference for a kpop bg song.

**moonagenightmares** (3): outdated as hell

**thedoctordances1940** (3): Nah this is just annoying

**weappreciatepowers** (3): BOOM S- [GUNSHOTS]

**10footnotes** (2): Happy 10th anniversary to “I Am the Best!” This song sucks though.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2): It's been long since the sound of this song flooded the rooms of my house and for a good reason, it sucks. ~~Tho stupidly teal hair T.O.P creates gender envy in me and idk why...~~ Anywho, Monster is the best song from this era even if it's from the fucking repackage!

**rotating3Dtext** (2): I can’t get behind a group with a literal criminal in it...

**bespectacIed** (1): This song is PTSD-inducing. It's iconic i guess but I have had 292812 lifetimes worth of unwanted listens of this song

**specialtrickholdA** (1): This song just hasn’t aged very well imo, on top me of not really being able to stomach BIGBANG after all the shit with S*ungri happened. Pre-chorus is the only part that still sounds good. Did they think the “wow fantastic baby” sounded sexy or something?

**sssaaage** (1): this has like no redeemable qualities at all.. the drop is genuinely horrible and the "wow.. fantastic baby" makes me never wanna listen to bigbang again (not as if i was going to anyway)

**cleopatroclus** (0): if I somehow worked out how to turn the microwave on with my head inside, i imagine this is what i'd hear as my brain slowly melted and the lights guided me to my death and a sweet release from this absolutely shite song

**jaskiwhere** (0): Part of me thinks my score was affected by the fact that Bigbang has multiple members who've just been terrible in the past (I used to love this song when I was like 10 lol), but I also think it just hasn't aged that well? It's so repetitive it falls on annoying, and TOPs and Taeyang's parts almost save it but it's just too annoying lmao

**TiltControls** (0): isitthough. it sounds like a BEP song (and not one of the good ones)

**TragicKingdom1** (0): what in the will.i.am

**wavingwolves** (8.6): I LOVE THIS!!! This deserved SO much better, I kind of can't believe it's placing this low. I'm kind of a sucker for songs that have a good orchestral accompaniment???? and this is sounds amazing to my ears. It's melodramatic and in a way I don't think is whiny, which is something easy for boy groups to usually tap into. This is just enjoyable and it makes me want to go to a karaoke and drunkly sing to this for no reason.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): The epitome of a 2nd gen song with a cringy English intro, a dramatic atmosphere, autotune, and thrusting that makes me uncomfortable to look at. And yet it works! SS501 debuted all the way back in 2005 and are one of the oldest groups in this rate with TVXQ and Super Junior. They were at one point one of the biggest boy groups with the success of Kim Hyunjoong in the drama Boys Over Flowers (obligatory [fuck Kim Hyunjoong](https://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/09/22/kim-hyun-joong-puzzlingly-cleared-of-charges-brought-by-ex-is-still-completely-terrible/) and any of his remaining fans) so we thought it was necessary to include a song of them. It doesn’t surprise me that this placed so low as SS501 are relatively little-known by newer K-pop fans :/

# Hag lovers 

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I hadn't heard this song before the rate but I really like this

**moonagenightmares** (10): the dramatics of 2nd gen songs >>>>

**HeartofDarkness123** (9.5): The rap break is really classic *bad* 2nd gen rap :’) But otherwise I found it really catchy.

**Heedictated** (9.2): love that nostalgic kpop sound from childhood

**1998tweety** (9): serve

**throwaway7650** (9): the rap takes me out of it a bit but the strings... :despair: unfortunately they are (2nd gen) men and thus trash is again present [7]

**BoneStreetSand** (8.1): This is so solid for one of the oldest songs in the rate. Lowkey aged well.

**celladonn** (8): The strings are so good

**elleyonce** (8): Oh I can see this get disrespected, but I grew up with this pretty much. 2010s Kpop was all about this drama.

**jaskiwhere** (8): this song is just so classic second-gen (violins!!) and I love how grand it is

**seanderlust** (7.6): baby let me love ya love ya love ya *gunshot*

**Sedona83** (7.5): Nice intro, pretty good overall

**foxinthenoodles** (7): A good song that makes me miss the good old days of boybands.

**hyphen-happy** (7): very early 2010s but not that dated

**nyoom** (7): it's no let me be the one, or obsess, or love like this, but it has a nostalgic hold on me

**SlphWsp** (7): More cringy english intros, love the piano and strings, nice melodies, simple but enjoyable mv, miss songs having dance breaks like this

**thedoctordances1940** (7): it's cute, but nothing amazing

**jasannn** (6.5): Angsty af


# Ageist people 

**BebeLuigi** (6): a classic we stan even if it grew a bit old now

**bluetriangles04** (6): I liked the song okay, but I would have given it a point higher if not for the gunshots and what sounds like a helicopter buzzing in the background.

**fadedblue09** (6): Does not hit hard as the other 2nd gen songs but I do enjoy the vocals

**hikkaru** (6): this has some parts i like but it's a bit weird

**PRADA** (6): choreo kings

**RandomHypnotica** (6): this sounds like it would feature on the soundtrack of one of those piano rhythm games for mobile

**suffocatedbears** (6): tbh i was abit bored until the dance break kicked in

**Zypker125** (6): First time listening to this song. The English intro was nice and the violins are nice, but the song is just a bit too low-energy and “quiet” (a flaw of many early 2010s songs). The dance break was nice, but the rap bridge just did not flow well despite the rappers seeming good.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5.5): I feel like all convo of this song stopped happening because the one member is a giant scumbag and yeah... I'm not gonna go into more but just look it up for yourselves... ~~Not like we lost much here if the rest of their stuff is like this...~~

**sssaaage** (5.5): this is bit boring but its cute

**akanewasright** (5): This is a whole lot of nothing

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Eurovision again, but midtempo Eurovision songs suck.

**weappreciatepowers** (5): no comment

**Bajuko** (4.5): The shaky cam made the video extremely hard to watch

**pleasegivemeasword** (4.5): extra half point for the violins

**CrimsonROSET** (4): stalker realness

**TiltControls** (4): don't know if i do love ya

**snugsnhugs** (3): well the orchestra is cool but another one of those older songs that doesn’t feel special in any other way

**frogaranaman** (1): this sounds like an Eminem sound

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (0): gives me a headache honestly

**wavingwolves** (8.3): I'm very sorry to say that I really like this. I know GD has this annoying kazoo voice and it can be intensily off-putting, especially on his solo stuff, but in this song it actually works well. I know that if this rate was like 5 years earlier this get be a fat ass 12 from, but this song grew out of me, even if not enough for me to not think it's actually pretty great. I just really love the pop-punk vibe of it and I think GD in particular fits that sound really well. Anyway, subject change! Did you guys know GD has a Sky Ferreira feature in the same album Crooked is in? [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvbxc_wiI8Y). And did you know that when he performed it in Korea Sky's part of the song was handled by Blackpink's Jennie? [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1rWk18n_A).

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): In typical BIGBANG fashion, this song doesn’t have many fans and leaves day 1. This song is mid to me - I gave it an extra 1.5 points because it was filmed in my home city of London. I’m not the biggest fan of GD, either musically or as a person.

---

**bobaroma** (10): When you want to just throw shit around listen to this.

**celladonn** (10): God I remember loving his Coup D'etat album when it came out... G-Dragon please release new music

**elleyonce** (10): An actually perfect song.

**Heedictated** (10): iconic song and iconic mv GD is perhaps the only kpop star who really felt like a rockstar to me

**queltemps** (10): I can't give an 11 but at the end of kpop nights this song always comes on and it takes me back to a simpler pre covid world

**Sedona83** (10): Replayed this

**taeneon** (10): suddenly i'm an emo 15 year old again omg. this is one of my all time favourite kpop songs and also he looked AMazing this era

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I mean this is just phenomenal

**hunnybee12** (9): I hate that I like this so much

**snugsnhugs** (9): this is kpop punk GOLD. you havent lived until you've screamed the chorus at the top of your lungs. no one does it like GD

**bigbigbee** (8.5): His voice is annoying but guess what so am i

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): Honestly, this entire album always did contain his best solo work imo and I guess people agree. So it only makes sense that we're rating it. (Tho I'm sure some people wanted 'Eyes, Nose, Lips') But uhhhh yeah this is still kinda a giant banger!

**aestheticen** (8): All I can think about when I hear this song is when they played this at a wedding I attended for some reason

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Filled to the brim with swagger. flow and vibes.

**galaxy\_rae** (8): classic and i only gave it an 8 for nostalgia lol

**milkywayinradius** (8): Gdragon giving me better Joker-vibes than jared leto. ok why wasn't Zutter with G-dragon and TOP in this bonus rate?

**rickikardashian** (8): i want songs to have that 2012 sound, that was euphoric and weirdly nostalgic, again

**spacebunsailor** (8): the exception to the kpop rap lol

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): the chorus has this really cute ethereal instrumental in the back and i hate that i noticed it because it made the song grow on me so much

**throwaway7650** (7.5): this is good wait, GD actually sounds... decent?

**TiltControls** (7.5): this sounds like it belongs in a coming of age Disney Channel original movie (complementary)

**BoneStreetSand** (7.4): Did he just DIE in the club??? Oh no! Anyways, I remember watching this when it came out. If this song is about being a loser when you’re not in love, let’s just be grateful that he started dating Jennie…

**cherryices** (7): the MV is so funny because i get the vibe that none of the extras are really aware of what’s happening

**SlphWsp** (7): Not my favourite from him but what a born performer, rarely do you see such charisma, he owns every frame, led the way for soloists coming from groups

**HeartofDarkness123** (6.5): It was okay. Not that impressed.

**fadedblue09** (6): Not sure if I approve of the vocal style used here

**jaskiwhere** (6): I don't really like his voice

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): i like the idea of gdragon’s music more than his actual music :/

**cleopatroclus** (4.4): for some reason sounds like a 2000s pop punk instrumental at times, but it 100% doesn't work with his unbearable voice

**nyoom** (4): "who has the most nasally voice in this group? let's give him solo tracks"

**skargardin** (4): this is rough i fear

**BebeLuigi** (3): never been a fan of g-dragon solo stuff

**weappreciatepowers** (3): this is unbearably bad why...

**bespectacIed** (2): this fun, dated instrumental is begging for a girl group, not fucking gd lol. a waste

**Zypker125** (1.6): I can’t stand G-Dragon’s nasally tone, so hearing nasally vocals/rap for a whole song just doesn’t work for me. The chorus is decently catchy, but it’s not nearly enough.

**sssaaage** (1.5): this is exactly the type of dated song i hate

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Imagine: it’s the year 2019. The beginning of August, to be exact. Korean news sites start posting rumours that SM is planning to debut a supergroup with its male idols. What a strange idea, right? You laugh and continue on with your day. A few days later, the SM Capitol Congress starts. Your fellow fans speculate - maybe the supergroup will be officially announced there? Seeds of doubt start being planted in your mind - maybe it’s not such a ludicrous idea after all. And then the tweets start flooding in - the announcement of ‘SuperM’. Described as the ‘Avengers of K-pop’ by SM Entertainment themselves, SuperM is officially born. (And no, you read it wrong the first time, it’s *SuperM*, not Sperm.) As the weeks roll by, you’re equal parts terrified and excited to see what SM comes up with for their new, trendsetting group. In late August, the instrumental of a B-side called I Can’t Stand the Rain is officially released and- wait! It sounds great! It mixes both traditional Korean elements and modern pop music - it’s everything you’ve wanted from a SM group! You love it so much, you even loop it enough that it climbs into your top 5 songs in your 2019 Spotify Wrapped. So what’s next? The official debut of SuperM is announced to be October 4, with the title track as “Jopping”. A combination of “jumping and popping”. Your excitement wanes a little. Really? SM thinks this is what’s going to smash in the West? Okay…Still, you’re curious to hear what it sounds like. The ICSTR instrumental was great so surely Jopping won’t be such a letdown. Especially because they spent so much money on it, what with the MV being filmed in Dubai. Right? And then 5 days before Jopping and SuperM’s first mini album are set to release, the entire album leaks on Weibo. Someone quickly sets up a Google Drive link with all the songs and you hurriedly download it all before it gets taken down. You’re early enough that you haven’t seen other people’s reactions yet so you have no idea what to expect. And so you listen to Jopping for the first time. This experimental, avant-garde, boundary-pushing, trendsetting, metaphorical masterpiece of a song. And despite all the memes about it, the laughing, the Summer Walker stans fighting with SM stans, the Kai teaching Ellen how to jop on the Ellen Show, Baekhyun singlehandedly reviving 2013 EXO-Ls who thought calling him Bacon was the funniest thing ever….despite all of that, you’ve fallen in love with Jopping. You really have.

**wavingwolves** (10): After years of hating this song, I finally got it... YES, IT'S GOOD! YES, MARKS' RAP IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD IN THIS TOO!! I did a FULL 180... Crazy, to think about the way I was... Jopping was once a 0 contender and now it's a song I genuinely enjoy listening to, and I do have to think the memes this brought are the main reason for that. It just made me see the song in a less "serious" way and in a more silly light and for that I find it enjoyable. This is not the best song in the world by any means, but this is one of the funniest songs I know and every time I listen to it I just can't find in myself space to hate it because it just makes me want to burst into laughing and that's actually a really good feeling to have. Everyone say 'thank you Lee Soo-Man for thinking this silly ass song would be SM's big breakout in the Western pop industry'.

# When we jumping and popping we-

**celladonn** (11): I don't care what anyone says, this bangs so hard and is ridiculous in all the right ways. The Avengers theme? Baekhyun's high notes? Mark's iconic verse? The stupidly expensive video? The absurd bombast of it all, all in service of a song about how when you're jumping and popping you're jopping. It's all so dumb, it's all so brilliant. This is peak kpop, in all its overblown, campy glory, and I won't have anyone tell me otherwise

**frogaranaman** (11): isn’t this the thing redditors say instead of masturbating

**useless-sheep** (11): sm stans when a song is god shit awful: OMG THE BRIDGE!!

**akanewasright** (10): I lost IQ points to this

**bookthieving** (10): cause when we jobless and shopping we jopping

**cremeebrulee** (10): im constantly thinking about "when we're jobless and shopping we're jopping" comment

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Look, this may not be the best song ever but Jopping is still undeniably catchy that I couldn't care less about the non-sensical lyrics if you look at the translation. And the music video is what I expected from an epic SM music video and they fucking delivered. Even though describing SuperM as the "Avengers of K-pop" is kinda cringy, I do like the idea of having popular members from SHINee, EXO, and NCT be part of a supergroup. It shows testament that SM has the most talented idols in K-pop ever.

**galaxy\_rae** (10): as someone who went to every super m show in the usa, i can confirm that jopping is THAT GIRL and hearing it live every night was magical!!

**grey/0x976** (10): frat house music in the best way possible it gets you moving it gets your ass shaking i love you lee sooman you slayed down the snatch with this one and i will forever be in debt to you for giving me this serotonin rush in mp3 format YASSS

**hikkaru** (10): some of y'all aren't jumping and popping and it shows

**hunnybee12** (10): it takes immense skill to make a song absolutely awful yet amazing at the same time

**hyphen-happy** (10): so bad but so good??

**moonagenightmares** (10): giving this a 10 so it can become the new closer with nothing but 0s and 10s

**orbiteezus** (10): no thoughts just jumping and popping

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i’m still not convinced this isn’t some sort of car commercial

**rickikardashian** (10): i still dont know what my actual score for this song is, but i feel like the only correct scores for this song are either 1 or 10, and i definitely feel mostly positive about it

**Roxieloxie** (10): pete wetnz is responsible for this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): do I only like this ironically?? when we joking and bopping we jopping

**specialtrickholdA** (10): What a fucking BANGER. This gets way too much hate.

**TiltControls** (10): i don't know much about this song but I can tell this is camp. giving it a 10 idc

**Twohungryblackbirdss** (10): aight I know y'all love to clown on this song but consider this. it fucking bangs

**gabcac** (9.5): i genuinely love this song. One of Mark's best raps. The perfomances add alot to the song.

**Shinkopeshon** (9.5): Mork's second iconic line

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): i do be jumping and hopping tho

**weappreciatepowers** (9.5): high camp

**PRADA** (9.2): WHEN WE JUMPING AND POPPING WE JOPPING

**chenle** (9): this slaps. idgaf

**DaHumanTorch** (9): it's camp

**endcreditouilles** (9): jopping?? in my good christian kpop song????

**hasanella** (9): the one and only a disgrace and god send i listened to it ironically but now i listen to it and gain unironic pleasure from it a hot mess i can not stop myself from enjoying

**HeartofDarkness123** (9): This is the more epic version of Mr. Simple. Trash (the word jopping is inherently ridiculous), but I’m ironically into it, and I do prefer hype music. Also, Taemin, my love, is in it. And Mark’s rap is iconic.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this will definitely be one of the most controversial songs in the rate but I really like it

**skargardin** (9): i was fully expecting to hate this given the amount of memes surrounding it but it actually slaps??

**snugsnhugs** (9): lets be real, people didn’t like this song at first but it is a grower and it slaps. Makes me feel powerful. Also Baekhyun’s high notes <333333333 and kai looking hot af <3333333

**sssaaage** (9): high camp

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): I used to think this was so corny. I mean, it still is, but also Mark's rap automatically makes it good. I don't make the rules.

wavingwolves: **thedoctordances1940** (8.5): It's very obviously the Closer of this rate and I'll take the same stance on this song as on Closer - It's a good song.

**ebooks #5454** (8.4): YOU MEAN TO TELL ME JOPPING IS A COMBINATION OF JUMPING AND POPPING??? CREME KEEPS SINGING THIS AND I HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

**Zypker125** (8.3): This song would have been a 10 if not for the first verse, which drags on for way too long and needed to be cut down. The “jopping… jopping” transition from the beginning chorus to the first verse also just stalled the energy of the song. Otherwise, though, I like the intense/heavy vibes of the song, feeling very cinematic and bold. Bakehyun’s high note gives me life.

**bluetriangles04** (8): Even if you think Mark is opinionated, he’s always spitting straight facts.

**Jhe116** (8): Single-handedly made the whole r/kpoopheads but they kinda over jerked it

**rosecoloreds** (8): thinking about that one post comparing superm and the beatles and it said 'if the beatles were smart enough they would call twist & shout twouting.. cause when we twisting and shouting we twouting'

**taeneon** (8): this deserves a high score if not only for the memes it spawned

**universemates** (8): Ngl the main reason I score this song this high is due to all the memes that it generates

**agentofscranton** (7.5): the 10 minute video of just mark’s verse would be an 11

**foxinthenoodles** (7.5): It's more questionable than it is good or bad. It's pretty standard pop, but what is a Jopping?

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): get in loser we're going jopping

**1998tweety** (7): shes a grower thats for sure, I still think their bsides are much better (2 Fast in particular off of this EP). Mark ate that rap up though

**cherryices** (7): sounded dated on arrival. utterly utterly stupid but a lot of fun

**pat-rickstar** (7): I kinda like this even though I really shouldn't

**spacebunsailor** (7): not that bad but also not good

**BoneStreetSand** (6.5): My thumbs down was still glowing blue under the youtube video when I clicked it. It wasn’t as bad as I remembered, but it wasn’t good. I un-disliked the song about halfway through but I will not like it. My dad told me to never enjoy a song with the word “bounce” in it and I never have since he said that. After this song finished, I stared at my laptop in disappointment until the screen went black and I could see my neutral face staring back at me.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i can’t justify half my pop rap scores if i don’t give this at least a 7

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): I think I have Stockholm syndrome from this song because the more I listen the more I actually enjoy it instead of laugh like I did the first time I heard it. Time to jop!!

**Sedona83** (6): Mark's rap elevates it






# Neither jumping nor popping: nopping 

**Heedictated** (5.3): I prefer listening to the one hour loop of Mark's verse than the actual song

**bigbigbee** (5): me when I hear the start of this song: OMG CAUSE WHEN, CAUSE WHEN WE, CAUSE WHEN, WHEN, WHEN WEEEEEEE JUMPING WHEN WE, WE, WE, OMG CAUSE WHEN WE JUMPING AND POPPING WE JOPPING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

**jasannn** (5): It's theatrical and expensive but for what?

**SlphWsp** (5): How can you put Taemin, Baekhyun and Kai in a group together and give them something this bad, shame on SM for dropping the ball so badly. Jopping smh just no. NO. The cringe is too much

**nyoom** (4.5): cause when we flipping and hopping we flopping. what a waste of a hot beat

**jaskiwhere** (4): If you ignore the lyrics, the music video, the branding, the intentions...then it could be good! However, I will simply Not do that, not even Taemin could save whatever concept this is

**seanderlust** (3.2): well....the verse containing the words "three stacks" was pretty good :woozy-face:

**lonelyglory** (3): "Stop trying to make fetch happen"

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (3): how do you group together so many talented people and make music for car commercials

**BebeLuigi** (2): I love all the members on SuperM but apart from the meme factor this track is..

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): not the kind of SperM i'd enjoy

**2dina3dworld** (1): instead of jopping and popping, I’m sighing and thinking of skipping

**aestheticen** (1): Who thought it was a good idea to expand into the US with the lyrics “cause when we jumping and popping we jopping”. Only reason I didn’t 0 this is because the chorus is at least a little enjoyable

**bespectacIed** (1): superm the definition of pretty privilege cuz wow this hot garbage really topped the charts. Anyways i still want lucas and kai to [redacted] me

**emmach17** (1): You can't just make up words and expect them to make a good song, SuperM

**fadedblue09** (1): SM must be stopped!! If any other company made this, people would drag this to filth and no redemption arc will be given.

**liberalitea** (1): this is a song that you either love or  hate and i absolutely cannot stand it. mark's verse is good though, but it's been meme'd to fucking death

**10footnotes** (0): I just can’t, I’m sorry, the secondhand embarrassment is too brutal. These are grown men! We cannot be encouraging SM’s bullshit like this! (Also yes I gave SHINee my 11 and SuperM my 0, I contain multitudes.)

**DraculaWeekend** (0): Jopping? More like flopping. All jokes aside, this song isn't that bad. The beat goes so hard, and verses are great. I just wish they didn't make up a nonsensical word for this song because it just sounds ridiculous

**milkywayinradius** (0): SM, stop trying to make jopping happen! it's not going to happen.

**runaway3212** (0): I cannot believe they actually released this song

**suffocatedbears** (0): tragic song, tragic group (love the members but what the hell was SM thinking), beautiful gowns i guess

# Speak your truth, MK

**throwaway7650** (0): let me start off by saying that each time they say the word jopping I experience physical pain. this is my 0 for multiple reasons, starting with the song itself. jopping actually has some good elements, I like how epic the song sounds at some points like the "LET'S GOOO!" - I do like the instrumental, I would give it a pretty high score actually if it was in the rate instead of this. but the lyrics in general are... I wish I didn't understand english. I also cannot stand taeyong's voice for the most part and he's unfortunately a SuperM member. and I just hate LSM and and the way he conceived this group and marketed them... the members deserve so much better. the one time I'll feel bad for taeyong (this was the group that beat out summer walker for the #1 on the BB200). free taemin/baekai #LSM_OUT

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Yeah, this one hurt me the most. I loooove this song, I think it’s definitely one of the more unique songs in the rate. When Taehyun was still in Winner I think he added this ~quirky indie flavour to their music and after he left their music just went downhill with the amount of trop pop songs they released which gradually decreased in quality (and Really Really was awful enough, sorry Belb). ~~[Edit from Belb: No, it's not.]~~

**wavingwolves** (10): Okay, I know I already said this for like, two other songs... BUT THIS IS THE MOST SHOCKING PLACEMENT TO ME!! What if I told you that this is one of my favourite k-pop songs of all time and I had no idea people would hate it this much? To be honest, I'm a sucker for any song that has a good pop rock feel to it and this has it. I love pop songs with good proeminent guitar lines, it just makes my brain go brrrrr in a way that's most pleasant. Winner earlier music felt almost indie-adjacent and it was mostly because of one of their members, Taehyun, who was the main composer of their earlier work and just had this knack for sweet, kind of unusual melodies in k-pop. I feel like this showcases that well. Taehyun ended up leaving Winner, which lead the group to change their sound to... worst. This is Winner's best title to this day.

---

# No features. No swedish songwriters. No trap beats. 100% pure uncut rock.

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow a surprising serve. This has some garage indie pop vibes all over it, definitely a sonically unique song in the rate.

**Heedictated** (10): just no words for this amazing smooth ass bop

**runaway3212** (10): maybe it's cause my brain is fried but this is nice

**ebooks #5454** (9.7): the dJUNGLESKOG CAMEO IN THE BEGINNING

**jaskiwhere** (9.5): I do love how this song is pretty different from everything else on the list, and it's definitely my favorite music video as well

**throwawayforshady** (9.5): Sorry but Winner w/Taehyun's music >>>> Without

**cherryices** (9.2): hopefully by the time of the rate reveal i’ll have figured out what this instrumental reminds me of

**bluetriangles04** (9): I really liked this unique sound from Winner when they first started out, and even though they went into other avenues I still find their first two EP’s very central to their core sound.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the chorus kinda fucks it up, but the verses are a 10. It’s that one vibe that’s too cool for you, and it knows it’s too cool for you.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.8): Oh these guys are cool. I can see this song getting high rotation on my spotify, but I also want to just rewatch the video again and again.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): that 60s motown vibe with the little chiptune elements is so interesting!

**cremeebrulee** (8): they kind of set themselves up with this group name huh

**elleyonce** (8): The one time Taehyun's goat vocals worked perfectly. Empty is the other one.

**foxinthenoodles** (8): So many good vibes. Might not be the most memorable, but you'll definitely enjoy it as you listen.

**seanderlust** (8): very early 2000s alt rock sound on this one

**SlphWsp** (8): Nice to hear a rock sound, laid back yet punchy, cathartic, lots of personality in this mv

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Love the cute synths

**throwaway7650** (8): cute song, meh raps (why did I call this R&B/not rock)

**TiltControls** (8): this grew on me a little

**weappreciatepowers** (8): this is nice..

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): wait I like those drums lol

**1998tweety** (7.5): Not particularly a big WINNER fan but this bops a bit

**sssaaage** (7): like one of the two yg songs in this rate i didnt tank

**jasannn** (6.5): I find it funny how from 2015-2017, I pretty much ignored most kpop bg songs released.

**BebeLuigi** (6): it's cute but It isn't really interesting to me

**bigbigbee** (6): I love guitars in k-pop but I think the vocal melody line in this is...kind of bad? And I don't think the first rap verse is integrated well with that at all.

**hasanella** (6): it is okay just okay

**HeartofDarkness123** (6): Didn’t hate it. Not really into the nasal tone though.

**PSSST12** (6): Tbh not a fan of winner's earlier slow sound. This doesn't do anything much for me.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): Winner never really did it for me, still don't tbh. But uhhhh Taehyun's parts on this are nice... Reminds me I should look into South Club.

**snugsnhugs** (6): a nice chill bop, though I can see how it could be kinda boring. Very easy to sing along to imo


# People on my hitlist 

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): the video had a nice aesthetic, but i found the song to be really uninteresting unfortunately

**suffocatedbears** (5.5): a refreshing concept but the song is rather meh

**10footnotes** (5): Kind of the definition of mid (at least to me).

**Leixander** (5): not very impressed with this compared to all the other songs

**skargardin** (5): this was so forgettable i had to play it twice for it to register :grinny:

**useless-sheep** (5): fell asleep during this twice i will just assume it's not interesting

**moonagenightmares** (4): i could barely listen to a winner song in seriousness because i kept thinking of that incel dude’s gynecologist rap

**PRADA** (3): it’s pretty boring

**DaBigBoi** (2.5): The title of the song works only if that sentiment is disappointment

**Zypker125** (2): This song is just super boring, N.Flying and DAY6 have more earworm-y band songs.

**bespectacIed** (1): mino voice unbearable

**nyoom** (1): what the fuck is the term for that nasally-ass chanting shit kpop boy groups do as backing vocals all the time. make it illegal. apologize to ray charles, and to the staff member who had to fish that phone out, and also to me because you made me look into a fucking toilet and remember that idols shit too with their man asses and their dorm bathrooms are probably biohazard zones. hit the fucking road jack, if you ever come back with shit like this again i'll fucking show you the meanest old woman you've ever seen

# You'll be the first one

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): HIGHLIGHT! Formerly known as BEAST! Yes, the same BEAST with Fiction! All the members hated their company (Cube Entertainment) so when it was time for contract renewals they all decided to leave and start afresh under a new company - with a new name of course, as Cube owns the rights to the name “BEAST”. This song was actually a hit in Korea so good for them for proving they don’t need Cube behind them to succeed, but clearly r/popheads thinks Fiction is better and we all know that’s what’s more important here.

**wavingwolves** (8.1): Oh, HIGHLIGHT! The dream of every fan is to see your favourite group leave its own company, who's always bad and mistreats the members to make them give most profit possible, and open their own company and be independent of bullshit. B2ST did that. The complete story is a compelling one and I remember following all of it at the time. This was also a important step for k-pop groups legally, which is always cool. Now, for the song, I feel like it's a really fun and feel-good one that I actually have no idea why it's placing so low. HIGHLIGHT might deserve better than this, but at least we still have B2ST in.

**BebeLuigi** (7): I had completely forgotten HIGHLIGHT sang this one lol

**cherryices** (7): quite enjoyable but doesn’t really stick with me

**galaxy\_rae** (7): made me happy!

**skargardin** (7): this is fun but i can already see it flopping and be out day 1

**weappreciatepowers** (7): cute

**bulforster** (6.9): A great song being held back by frustratingly nasally, whiny vocals.

**rickikardashian** (6.8): noo plz dont be sad you’re so sexy haha 😜😏

**Zypker125** (6.8): I liked the vibe/atmosphere of the song. However, I feel like the song isn’t high-energy enough to match the happy vibes of the song, with the verses and pre-chorus being relatively weak. However, the catchy choruses redeem part of the song.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): bad depression advice be like

**emmach17** (6): Sorry but what is this song name?

**fadedblue09** (6): I wonder how many non-kpop people will realize this group actually has another song in the rate 👀

**HeartofDarkness123** (6): Generally pleasant, but it isn’t sticking out to me at all.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): 7 year old me to my mom when i would tell her that I threw up at 2 am

**jaskiwhere** (6): the dance for this is something else lmao

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): Still wish they would have went with 'The Group Formerly Known As BEAST' for their name change due to legal reasons.

# Lights OUT!!!


**cleopatroclus** (5.7): nothing wrong with it just boring

**10footnotes** (5): Not them basically telling us “You should smile more, you look prettier when you smile.”

**celladonn** (5): Noooo plz don't be sad you're so sexy haha

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): okay i cant tell if i love or hate this so... middle ground

**foxinthenoodles** (5): Autotune is poorly utilized. The rest of the song is just ok.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): come on little lady, give us a smile, no I ain’t got nothing to smile about!!!

**sssaaage** (5): the verses of this are nice but the chorus is annoying

**bigbigbee** (4): I support any group giving the middle finger to their old company and leaving, so I wanted to like this one a lot more but sadly I think it is just okay! The MV is cute though.

**Sedona83** (3.5): Fun video, song went nowhere

**nyoom** (3): this song unfortunately takes its cue from this children's song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRt2nGGo22U which i always found intensely irritating. also male voices telling me i look better when i smile remind me of the time i was getting a haircut from this 30something dude who kept asking me specific questions about where i went to school and if i lived around here and then asked if i usually smiled this little and i wanted to sass him but also didn't want my hair fucked up

**PRADA** (2): kind of snooze sorry

**2dina3dworld** (0): how can I not be sad when I’ve had to listen to this for the first time in 5 years despite going out of my way to avoid any mention of this song?

**BoneStreetSand** (0): This one annoyed me in a way I can’t articulate.

**wavingwolves** (9.1): I'm very sorry to my good friend u/sssaaage for this one, but I'm glad you changed your 11 because this was never going very far, which is too bad. I absolutely love this song and I think probably their peak as a group. I love the production, I love how Baekho sounds in it, I love the MV and the styling (even Ren's pink wig). I just feel like this is also a song that should be a lot higher than this, but I feel this song is a grower and it's not the type of song that would do well in more this kind of scenario. Anyway, stream CANVAS, the mini in which this features as a title.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): This was the last song NU’EST released before going on Produce 101 season 2 in an attempt to revive their career - I still find it so cool how they only sold about 6k for this album, and then their first full group album after appearing on Produce 101/Wanna One disbanded sold about 250k! We all love a good comeback story. Personally, I really expected this to do a lot better than it did...and definitely better than Face! I guess we’re bigger fans of Eurotrash with dubstep breakdowns.

---

# Picassos

**bulforster** (11): This is just put together perfectly, I don't know how to explain it but the vocal lines on this one are just really engaging and the chorus is packed with production details that really make it impactful.

**bespectacIed** (10): Nothing short of excellent, I'm a sucker for properly done future bass. Produce giving newest a career boost was the only good thing mnet ever did

**bluetriangles04** (10): I actually love the way this song comes in, mostly every nook and cranny in this song is emphasized by production, like small sound bits or ad libs in the background, and the beautiful breakdown in the chorus.

**endcreditouilles** (10): the visuals in this video are so gorgeous and pristine, and the rap break is IT.

**grey/0x976** (10): timeless x2 nuest make hits

**sssaaage** (10): amazing perfection never done before etc etc.. this instrumental actually so good and the chorus literally amazing they laced this song

**weappreciatepowers** (10): saur fucking good yall are mad

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): yes im hole

**nctdreamsqd** (9.5): The concept of Love Paint is my favorite era of them

**throwaway7650** (9.5): nearly a 10... want *just* a bit more from the chorus

**hasanella** (9): okay they did not have to go that hard damn this song shocked me they are literal angels

**specialtrickholdA** (9): Baekho being blessed with a beautiful voice, face and body...

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): loved it

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): baekho sounds really good in the chorus

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): So much better than their other song in this rate. This actually makes me want to check out their music!

**fadedblue09** (8.3): I didn’t like this at first but I’m glad I do now. Though I still feel like the chorus is strained by overproduction. (I swear, I’ll give Love Me/Inside Out a 10 next time).

**SlphWsp** (8): Good but a bit disjointed, don't love the rap. Beautiful mv, super satisfying choreo as well

**TiltControls** (8): nice high notes and the rap is fun! mv was good, but a bit less memorable than their other

**jasannn** (7.5): Even though I don't follow them, Im glad they were able to get a resurgence in popularity.

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**rickikardashian** (6.8): [happy pride](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/750179199536463954/861304195596550174/PicsArt_07-04-03.59.24.jpg)

# I didn't google an antonym for Picasso but I thought about it tbh 

**foxinthenoodles** (6.5): Great vocals with questionable production choices.

**jaskiwhere** (6): This one felt kinda generic

**Zypker125** (5.6): Man, this song sounds difficult to sing. The vocal runs here are crazy, and I appreciate the hard work of the vocalists. Unfortunately, the vocal runs aren’t enough to save the rather unmemorable song, with the verses and rap bridge being particularly forgettable.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5.5): Love Paint, or that song I've heard get praised for years but never really understood why and still don't. Like ehhhh it's just so barely above average for me. Nothing about it really makes it stand out to me.

**celladonn** (5): It doesn't leave much of an impression

**moonagenightmares** (4.8): boring

**BebeLuigi** (4): bit boring

**bigbigbee** (4): Props to Pledis for knowing that NUEST still had the potential to be hit idols and sending them to Produce 101 even after this generic song. It's not bad but I feel like there's no here here.

**elleyonce** (4): It's like this song is a mashup of every standard Kpop vocal performance possible with none of the fun in the melody.

**HeartofDarkness123** (4): Felt generic. I don’t remember much of it.

**nyoom** (3): more like huff paint. i have not heard this song. (edit: i have now heard this song. i said what i said)

**Sedona83** (3): Did nothing for me

**snugsnhugs** (3): meh, nothing that amazing about it

**PRADA** (2): snooze wtf

# I hate yall 

**CrimsonROSET** (7): so you’re telling me that the best possible title for this song was ‘love paint’ other than literally anything else? Because when you say love paint I think of semen.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): love paint sounds like a euphemism for cum

**RandomHypnotica** (6): why does love paint sound like slang for cum

**frogaranaman** (4): is that a cum reference

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I was expecting this to do better as it is a song by a BTS member after all but a lot of you reeeeally didn’t like the STD line and some of you aren’t really into rap, which is fair. I personally love this song (and the Agust D mixtape too, D-2 was less good). Yoongi go solo please and thank you

**wavingwolves** (9.5): I'M D-BOY BECAUSE I'M FROM THE D!!!!! I was actually pretty surprised at this doing kind of poorly, but I guess a lot of people don't like his style of rapping + STD line. I especially love the intro of this song and the "I'M SORRY" bridge. I find this song super infectious and fun to listen to. I just absolutely love to hear Yoongi rap too, so. AND YES, YOONGI GO SOLO, PLEASE AND THANK YOU [2]

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): King of sending people to Hong Kong with his tongue technology

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Wow he really did that

**endcreditouilles** (10): Dtsuga agustD

**hyphen-happy** (10): too iconic "i'm sowwy" " a to the u to the std" lmaoo

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Forever thankful for the "Kissing my ass" line that is followed by a bunch of repetitions of "Ass" in the background.

**Sedona83** (10): Rap perfection

**Heedictated** (9.8): Yoongi with his tongue technology and prediction is forever a favourite

**hasanella** (9.5): boy am i a sucker for yoongi

**nastyhoe\_22** (9.5): (this go hard :fire:)

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.5): yoongi is so talented but the ‘to the std’ line will never fail to make me cringe

**throwawayforshady** (9.1): STD STD

**bobaroma** (9): I miss this rawness tbh.

**celladonn** (9): He ate

**jaskiwhere** (9): eyyyy Suga in his element! I love this, nothing more to say

**skargardin** (9): oh he went OFF

**thedoctordances1940** (9): ngl this is pretty sick

**Zypker125** (9): The instrumental slaps and Suga has one of my favorite rap styles, so there’s a lot I like about this song. I don’t like soloists songs nor do I like pure-rap songs, so this isn’t a song I’ll ever listen to in my free time, but I still really like the song.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.8): I think this is like the perfect f**k the haters song, but it’s a shame that he still writes songs like this five years later. Is being in the most successful boy band in the world not enough for you? Anyways, A to the G to the U to the, uh… STD.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): STD???

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Coming for vengeance after being done dirty in the Manic rate

**rickikardashian** (8.5): my poor meow meow...my baby my little baby who hurt so much but treats people with nothing but kindness forgive me for not being able to do more..i tried my best i really did..

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Commendable rapping on a good beat.

**HeartofDarkness123** (8): Not my favorite Agust D song but it does appeal to the part of me that goes brrrr when listening to fast technical rap. The English lyrics always make me laugh.

**lonelyglory** (8): Even if I'm not the biggest fan of the production, I'm always drawn in by Suga's intense flow

**plastichaxan** (8): the STD is such an unfortunate line i’m sorry

**sssaaage** (8): "to the STD" DIA WHO?????

**aestheticen** (7): STD prevention so true

**akanewasright** (7): Something something STD

**elleyonce** (7): I'M D BOY BECAUSE I'M FROM D

**milkywayinradius** (7): STD

**orbiteezus** (7): suga's my favorite rapper in

**throwaway7650** (7): suga is my favorite rapper in BTS, although this song is quite... aggressive. but yoongi pro-STD awareness activist wbk #JIM_JONES

**cleopatroclus** (6.5): he's much better on his own than with bts but still, feel like im being spat on and not in a good way, just hope i don't get an a to the g to the u to the STD

**agentofscranton** (6): not the STD

**Jhe116** (6): It sounds like he caught std while he performed his tongue technology

**moonagenightmares** (6): not a fan of that thing suga does where he sounds like he’s running on a treadmill while rapping

**bigbigbee** (5): He definitely gets points for rapping in a style that IMO doesn't feel appropriative but I can't say I enjoy the beat for this that much, and since I don't really seek out lyrics in the Korean music I listen to (as a non-Korean speaker), any good lyricism he has doesn't make up for that for me.

**seanderlust** (5): "A to the G to the U to the STD" uuuuuuhhhh..........to the STD?

**spacebunsailor** (5): sorry but kpop rap is not it

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): really not my thing.

**rotating3Dtext** (4): i’m so sorry but this was always kinda embarrasing

**SlphWsp** (4): Sorry I just don't like this rap heavy sound, kudos Suga for mastering your craft but it's not my cup of tea

**weappreciatepowers** (4): i dont like his rapping, kiss my ass

**nctdreamsqd** (3.5): It is a bit too aggressive for me with not enough variation in the song

**10footnotes** (3.4): Score docked 1.6 points for the 16 occurrences of “A to the G to the U to the S T D.”

**bluetriangles04** (3): Something about this song makes it so unlistenable to me, and it’s not the instrumental. I like some of Yoongi’s other work but this song is so … for me.

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): The chorus chant says it all

**BebeLuigi** (1): I'm sorry I really can't with this

**nyoom** (1): i literally had to turn this song off because of the sickening one-two punch of a man proudly announcing that he's from daegu* + the fucking cunnilingus line, color me d to the i to the s to the g to the u to the STD this song gave me, spiritually. (*i don't exactly expect him to realize what daegu represents to korean women. i'm continuously stunned by how normalized cultural misogyny is to the vast majority of men. but to contextualize my visceral repulsion: there were 134.5 and 129.7 boys born for every 100 girls in daegu in the years 1988 and 1990—respectively just five and three years before suga was born—due to sex-selective abortion. an untampered sex ratio would sit around 105:100. yes abortion was illegal. here's data from 2019 [https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=101&tblId=DT_1B81A19] which shows daegu is still recording 109.2:100, the highest in the country. the first autocomplete on google for "daegu men" in korean is "don't date daegu men." empirical testimony here [https://www.instiz.net/pt/4345750] includes a user from daegu mentioning that the women in her family don't even get a seat at the table during holidays, they eat huddled up in the kitchen in between doing all the cooking and cleaning (this is not as uncommon as you would hope). here [https://imgur.com/a/QcOn7kJ] is the breakdown of how many more minutes of housework women do per day in relation to their husbands' birthplace. the outliers are daegu and gyeongsangbuk-do, the province bordering daegu.)

**snugsnhugs** (1): I don’t like his style of rap, I feel like he’s yelling at me

**wavingwolves** (10): WHYYYYYYY!!!!!! This is one of the most remarkable songs in this rate for me, but I know this is also a massive grower and it's the kind of song that clicks as you listen to it more times since it's slower. This is just smooth and really charming, and I actually LOVE the autotuned robot-like voice in the chorus, I think it's the kind of thing that shouldn't really work in a song like this but it just does. It makes it catchy, memorable, maybe even a little quirky. AND I'M SORRY 2PM FOR WHAT POPHEADS DID TO YOU!!!!! You guys deserved better.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): The first Korean song 2PM released in many months after a DUI-induced hiatus (yeah…), this song was really a testing of the waters to see if 2PM could still retain their Korean fanbase after both the big DUI scandal and the hiatus. It’s also iconic just as a song/concept because it’s one of the few “sexy concepts” from a boy group that we’ve gotten, as evidenced by the MV. Also it’s just a bop tbh

# DILF lovers

**jaskiwhere** (11): All Day I Think Of This Song

**SFbby** (11): I was going to finish this rate in a day but this song and music video (a literal bisexual dream) absolutely derailed me right into the 2PM rabbit hole and I have absolutely no regrets about it.

**DaBigBoi** (10): From trashy bop to edgy jam, they can do it all

**galaxy\_rae** (10): WOOOW THIS IS FIIIRE AND THEY FINE! I love the robotic voices in the chorus. My hood would’ve loved this back in the day.

**grey/0x976** (10): hags served also the dude who says "harujongil" at 1:05 reminds me of jb (not the white man) like the voice is identical

**Leixander** (10): strings are my weak spot

**jasannn** (9.5): This song just oozes sexiness and maturity. I can't imagine any other group that could pull this off. The high pitched second chorus is an odd choice but it works for some reason.

**fadedblue09** (9.3): The falsettos give me Usher vibes. Not too fond of the robotic voice but otherwise this is a jam

**elleyonce** (9): Hot men shit. Grown men shit.

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): as an asexual this is the ONLY sexualization in media i am ok with

**queltemps** (8.5): one of my favourites 2nd gen tunes

**bespectacIed** (8): Gonna use this song to complain about the lack of himbos in today's kpop. Screw the current mannequin-like male idol prototype; bring back the men!

**bluetriangles04** (8): DILFS!

**foxinthenoodles** (8): Great R&B bop and 2PM's best song.

**runaway3212** (8): I was dreading more 2PM after Hands Up but this was pretty good

**TiltControls** (8): neat

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): this was very interesting, the chorus is very catchy and the strings are nice. I liked the vocals too.

**weappreciatepowers** (8): I like this more than the first, it’s nice

**BoneStreetSand** (7.8): Was going to give a higher score, but then he ripped off her pearls, so I lowered it.

**10footnotes** (7.5): Dramatic violins are always welcome!

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes a mature bop

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this is not… great. I will admit that. But it’s so melodramatic that it’s enjoyable and funny, especially since it takes itself 100% seriously. It also doesn’t flounder at any point, which makes it a bit better.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): this was an 8.5 until the deep voice came in. very rarely do i like those deep voice effects in songs

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The hook is really catchy

**sssaaage** (7.3): tbh i was shocked by how good the rapping in this is after hearing most bgs

**bulforster** (7): clean but a bit one note

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I like those high notes but not much else.

**HeartofDarkness123** (7): I really love the high, thin vocals towards the second half of the song. This is the quintessential sexy kpop song and while it's not as captivating as some of my other favorite horny kpop songs, it's still a sensual bop, my favorite kind. The fade out ending kind of takes away a little bit though, especially since this specific autotuned voice is kind of grating.

**letsallpoo** (7): oh no it's the booty yeah song

**nctdreamsqd** (7): I liked the harmonies and Jun K & Wooyoungs lines

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): so catchy

**throwaway7650** (7): I love highlight by seventeen (but highlight is better) (shame about the trash members though, may or may not include jay park)

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): that modified voice single-handedly dragged down the whole song

**seanderlust** (6.5): did he just break her necklace? that's so fucking rude!!


# DILF haters

**Heedictated** (6.1): all the sexy scenes couldn't help spice the song up

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this production is too… normal for the weird vocals that get thrown in. i wish they had committed to the pots and pans of it all

**liberalitea** (6): 2PM have huge Big Time Rush energy

**rickikardashian** (6): ALL DICKS TORMENT OTHER YOUNGSTERS

**SlphWsp** (6): Nice vocals but don't love the rap or vocal effects, drags on a bit

**plastichaxan** (5.5): i cant believe they would do something like this after the bop that was hands up i feel betrayed

**PRADA** (5.5): they have better songs but the dance is cool yass

**Zypker125** (5.2): This choreo is absolutely atrocious, it’s like a bunch of 50 year old scarecrows with thigh problems designed it. The falsettos and rap are nice, but the chorus isn’t catchy at all and the rest of the song is unmemorable.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Just because the notes exist, does not mean you should try to hit them

**Sedona83** (5): Somewhat of an annoying chorus

**snugsnhugs** (5): its aight

**cleopatroclus** (4): gave me dubstep flashbacks in the worst way

**hyphen-happy** (4): feel bad bc i just dont have the nostalgia for 2pm and now it's too early 2010s

**Mrach** (4): I admire the decision to feature Tiny Tim on the chorus, you don't see many k-pop groups taking risks like that.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): this was almost my 0 but it kinda grew on me

**nyoom** (3.5): impressive forward thinking that the choreographer designed moves they can do with their walkers on their 2061 reunion tour. more like all day drinking the 'dew, gamers rise up. i hate the second half of this song so much

**BebeLuigi** (3): it felt 2 minutes longer than it actually is

**useless-sheep** (3): bad

**PSSST12** (0): I'm sorry but this song is too unpleasant for me to handle.

# Hornyheads

**aestheticen** (10): The only song that can make me h word

**RandomHypnotica** (10): omg this is SO HOT, that chord progression is gorgeous, the b&w mv is sext, it’s just so good

**suffocatedbears** (10): the MV wrecked my gay ass

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): this is musically so h-word

**milkywayinradius** (9): i wish i were a chair. pls stand on me, 2pm

**skargardin** (9): i'm about to pass out from watching this mv :pussyflushed:

**akanewasright** (8.5): idk if I like this song or if I’m just… really into the guys in the video :pussysweating:

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): LOOK IT'S THE CHAIR SONG!!!!! I haven't heard this one in YEARS. Anywho, watching the video for this and to the dude in the vest, CALL. ME. Actually I take that back, to any of these guys, call me.

**cremeebrulee** (8): i'm h*rny

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I don't want to know what would happen to me if I watched this music video when I was still in the closet...they are so sexy omg.

**endcreditouilles** (7.8): this is the sexiest mv I've ever seen

**taeneon** (7): a vibe and also they're so hot

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): Obligatory fuck TS Entertainment comment for basically ruining B.A.P’s career. What seems to be forgotten now is how B.A.P and EXO both debuted in 2012 and surprisingly it was actually B.A.P who swept all the rookie awards and EXO were seen as SM’s biggest disappointment. How the turn tables...also, obligatory mention of the time EXO and B.A.P fans were voting like crazy for their faves to win the Best New Male Artist of the Year Award at MAMA 2012 only for Busker Busker to win instead lmao

**wavingwolves** (7.4): Ah, I miss the storyline MV era of kpop so much. This was a wild ride of a MV that makes Eminem's 8 Mile (2002) look like child's play. Love the melodramatic flair of it so much. Musically, it's not my favourite song ever and I can't listen to it without connecting it with the MV, but it's still good. 

---

# People who know they only get one shot

**2dina3dworld** (10): Did Martin Luther King Jr. references better than Justin Bieber

**bobaroma** (10): Just the right amount of drama, angst, and impact in one song. I miss this energy.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i love how cinematic this is. it's giving me fast and furious end credits. and the MUSIC VIDEO. holy shit...one of the best kpop music videos i've seen (granted i haven't seen many). it bumped it up to a 10 for me. my jaw literally dropped at multiple points while watching. this is my first b.a.p. song and i will be checking them out more after this. i'm fully gagged

**ebooks #5454** (10): THEY SHOT HIM THEY FUCKING SHOT HIM OHMY GOD THE PLOT TWIST MY HEART IS ZOOMING EVERYWHERE YES YES YES I LOVE THIS

**grey/0x976** (10): i just think the mv is one of the best cinematic experiences ever..

**HeartofDarkness123** (10): I LOVE this song. It gets me so hype. I'm a sucker for the orchestral instrumentation. Is it Yongguk's? deep voice ends me. I wasn't around to develop a nostalgic attachment to 2nd or early 3rd gen kpop but this feels nostalgic. I don't know if I can explain why it's a 10 but it sparks joy in me and both the rap and the melody is compelling.

**Heedictated** (10): epic song epic mv might have been my 11 if not for himchan

**Leixander** (10): love the use of strings and the choir

**PSSST12** (10): I remember the HYPE around this song when it was released. Listening to it reminds me of the times when I was an angsty 8th grader wanting to take dowm the system while bopping to this. Good times.

**runaway3212** (9.5): Outsold eminem

**throwaway7650** (9.5): iconic MV, the reactions to it in the beatsense were so funny (but the song is really good too) (shame about trash members [2])

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.1): okay Eminem

**1998tweety** (9): omg the instrumental im ascending

**bookthieving** (9): this was the peak of edgy aggressive rap-heavy bgs, 4th gen could never

**celladonn** (9): Ugh the drama of this... they don't make em like this anymore

**nctdreamsqd** (9): Dramatic & Captivating

**BoneStreetSand** (8.5): This song was released the day I moved from a small town to the city. Thanks for tickling my repressed trauma.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): what’s the video so dramatic for help

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): this feels like the cooler sibling of ateez's wonderland IT BANGS

**TiltControls** (8.5): why is this mv so intense. i love it

**useless-sheep** (8.4): this music video is something

**Zypker125** (8.1): Yongguk’s English/rap at the beginning is just awful to listen to (B.A.P’s rappers might be one of my least favorite of any group, their raps turns me off from half their songs). However, Daehyun’s vocals completely save this song and make it listenable.

**10footnotes** (8): This song does have a bit of that “we mixed this in 30 minutes,” first-half-of-the-2010s-K-pop feel, but I’m a fan of almost any song that incorporates some kind of orchestral flair, and I think this one handles the feeling of drama and bombast well! Something else I’m a big fan of is the incredible irony of a song titled “One Shot” having an MV that ends with people shooting each other dozens of times lmao.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): honestly i love the kinda early aughties feel this has

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song called me slurs in high school

**Roxieloxie** (8): the music video for this haunts me

**fadedblue09** (7.7): This is like the most epic and dramatic motivational track I've ever heard. The MLK shoutout is kinda weird though

**chenle** (7.5): the dramaticness of this song is unparalleled, also i love when bang yongguk wants to tell me something i already know

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy, vomit on his sweater mom’s spaghetti

**Sedona83** (7.5): Like the vocalist, good buildup into chorus

**sssaaage** (7.3): after watching the mv for this i raised the score by like 2 points

**aestheticen** (7): It is "cinematic" I guess, but there's just something lacking

**BebeLuigi** (7): It feels dramatic I dig that

**DraculaWeekend** (7): The MV was a cinematic experience and rightfully deserves a 10, but the song did not age well

**galaxy\_rae** (7): this sum gta seoul shit right here wtf omg the way i was so invested in the mv.

**PRADA** (7): bop yassssssssssssssss and STORYLINE

**SFbby** (7): Super impressed with the ground workout being done in the choreo

**skargardin** (7): how am i supposed to process this mv HELP

**SlphWsp** (7): I'm on a boat becomes lose yourself becomes step up final dance? Saved by excellent chorus and top notch acting

**agentofscranton** (6): all six of these points go to that dance move where that guy looked like he was being tased on the ground

**Bajuko** (6): This is one of the craziest videos I’ve ever seen omg

**bespectacIed** (6): lmao this song's mv was shot in my country, very cool. Iconic mv, often regarded as one of the bestses in kpop, okay song

**elleyonce** (6): Holy shit, relistening to this, they might well be the Monsta X blueprint. Tell me if you could tell Kihyun and Daehyun apart with your eyes closed. For real.

**imasalesman** (6): This video was the crazy

**lonelyglory** (6): Still a legendary MV

**milkywayinradius** (6): there are so many things about this MV that I can't process but thoroughly enjoyed. the song is okay, but wow that mv.. can't stop thinking about it.

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): It sounds really grand and epic and feels like it’s from the early 2000s

**RandomHypnotica** (6): This is basically Lose Yourself but somehow even edgier, and it lasts WAAAYY, BUT it gets a few extra points for the absolute madness in the MV

**rickikardashian** (6): the music video was written by a 13 year old fan fiction author that uses plot twists more often than correct punctuation

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): I wasn't a fan of it but I liked the bridge and the last chorus had the right build up to it.

# People who believe in second chances 


**foxinthenoodles** (5.5): The parts where they say ONE SHOT multiple times salvage the song.

**orbiteezus** (5.5): unrelated to the song but the video for this is so fucking over the top i love it. the song works with the video in how dramatic it is but besides the chorus i'm not really a fan of anything else

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5.5): Okay so I'm watching the YouTube playlist to do this and... I FORGOT HOW LONG THE FUCKING VIDEO FOR THIS IS. Why are so many of B.A.P's videos fucking mini-movies?!?!?!?! Real talk when it comes to early B.A.P, I'm more of a Warrior guy, because I have no taste. Their peak tho was Skydive. *Insert obligatory fuck TS Entertainment comment here.*

**bluetriangles04** (5): the M/V makes this song a lot more bearable for me, but when I listen to it separately I’m not entirely hooked.

**bulforster** (5): Pro, the first melodic line of the chorus reminds me of the Tracey Beaker theme. Con, this definitely sounds like a song my Hamilton-obsessed friends would annoy me with.

**cleopatroclus** (5): the forced lower voice at the start was the beginning of the end, vocals from dae hyun were great tho, just a shame the rest exists

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this seems like a video game soundtrack song, but in a bad way

**hikkaru** (4.5): it sounds so edgy i don't like it much

**seanderlust** (4.5): fast and the furious-core

**weappreciatepowers** (4.5): okayyyyy…

**taeneon** (4): i actually used to a bap fan but this was way worse than i remembered

**nyoom** (3.9): "lemme tell u somethin thatchu already know" mansplaining icons. 3.9 like the goodreads rating for Men Explain Things to Me

**dekubaku** (3): Yup, I gave this a shot and tbf, it doesn't do much for me.

**snugsnhugs** (3): honestly rip to BAP but this song is not it


# Send them the bill 

**akanewasright** (4): I need therapy after that MV

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): First the dark edgy concepts came for NCT Dream. I didn’t speak out since I was not a Dreamzen. Then they came for The Boyz. I didn’t speak out since I was not a Deobi. Then they came for SEVENTEEN. No one spoke out for them, because there was no one left to speak.

**wavingwolves** (8.4): I'll be honest and say this was also not a song I liked that much, but it also grew on me a lot and I kind of love when it comes to the darker SEVENTEEN songs. I think SEVENTEEN is the kind of group that works best in lighter songs and brighter concepts, most of their darker and some of their quirkier concepts are a miss for me. This one was a miss for a few years, but it did hit me one of these days and I was able to see the appeal of it more clearly. Jeonghan kind of slays the whispered parts of this and it brings a lot to this song too.

---

# Love+Fear

**galaxy\_rae** (11): AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

**bespectacIed** (10): the svt song that made mv check them out. Huge bop. That jeonghan whispered line on the second verse is to die forrr

**grey/0x976** (10): ! Im sorry this is one of the best kpop songs ever.. in the midst of wonderlands, dun duns, mirohs, and ddu dus you have this absolute anthem that stands above the rest. I would like to take this moment to personally thank woozi and bumzu. Literally no one else besides you kings couldve put together something as beautiful, poetic, and impactful as this. Id like to also thank performance unit, i have literally no idea if you made the choreography but i'm giving you the credit regardless. Id also like to give joshua 1 kiss. No real reason why i just think he slays down the gagatron

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): I usually prefer more ‘brighter’ songs which seventeen excels at so much but for some reason this is one of my favorite title tracks by them if not my favorite

**RandomHypnotica** (10): omg everything here serves, the lyrics, the dancing, the visuals, stunning

**Twohungryblackbirdss** (10): My friend has a video of me in an alleyway outside a bar in Seoul screaming this song at a rando I picked up 20 minutes prior. A masterpiece

**Zypker125** (9.7): This song gets better the more I listen to it. S.Coup’s rap here is one of his best, Woozi’s/Seungkwan’s vocal parts are amazing, and the pre-chorus/chorus match the tone of the song so well. The ad-libs and high notes at the end also work very well.

**Sedona83** (9.5): Ended up repeating it

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**SlphWsp** (9): Dark and atmospheric, heavenly vocals and a stunning mv, mesmerising

**throwaway7650** (9): although a bit generic, this is still a bop and overhated

**sssaaage** (8.8): the 2nd half of the chorus kinda falls off but the rest is great, svt dark concepts are good its true its true

**HeartofDarkness123** (8.5): The little whisper in the middle makes me ascend off the earth. A hype song that’s also catchy.

**weappreciatepowers** (8.5): good

**BoneStreetSand** (8.1): Okay this was a little bit better than the other songs but didn’t really win me over. I don’t think I’ll come back to any of their music but I can’t say it’s bad or anything.

**10footnotes** (8): This is a polarizing song among Seventeen fans, but I really like it. I think what makes Fear succeed where the vast majority of dark, angsty boy group concepts fail is that it actually has a compelling emotional core. It’s not just about “Hey, look how cool these boys are, they’re dancing aggressively and wearing pleather! Oh, and whatever empty words they’re singing about being champions and/or fuckbois aren’t important.” Sure, Fear’s lyrics are pretty run-of-the-mill “this relationship is toxic and I have to do what’s right and end it” fare, but it has an actual narrative and emotional depth! Some of the melodies are almost yearning! That alone does so much to ground the song—which is dark and bold and aggressively synthy—in accessible emotions that make it easier for the listener to connect. In addition, the writing and arrangement is so smart in how it plays with silence, contrast and empty space. It’s not just a loud electropop song: there are moments of rest and reflection, too.

**Heedictated** (8): chorus is strong but the verses are generic

**lonelyglory** (8): Man I remember this getting promoted next to Snap Shoot, what whiplash... the duality lol

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Okay, you know what, I think you SEVENTEEN fans made several points, who's giving me the intro class on these boys.

**ebooks #5454** (7): good music but the lack of seventeen members is really such a shame

**agentofscranton** (6.5): one of those instances where the music video heightens the song

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): I wasn’t really enjoying the sound change here. The song sounds less like SEVENTEEN and instead more like what every boy group was doing at the time.

**jaskiwhere** (6.5): This one's definitely a grower, I like it a lot more now than I did on first listen


# Only fear

**fadedblue09** (6.3): I hope this didn't drag my SVT average so much. While I think they can handle dark concepts, this was not it. They did this better with their Japanese singles and some Bsides

**CrimsonROSET** (6): with these lyrics, i can’t help but feel this should hit much harder than it actually does

**frogaranaman** (6): how does this hold up to disc 2 of Marina’s *LOVE+FEAR*

**moonagenightmares** (6): they actually have quite a few good titles why were their 2 worst ones chosen this is sad

**nyoom** (6): sounds more nct than seventeen but it's not bad

**TiltControls** (5.5): I liked their other stuff, but not the biggest fan of this one. Maybe their coolest mv though

**elleyonce** (5): What the hell is this song? It's awful but also great?? Where is the rating for that?

**PRADA** (4.7): mediocre i wish you chose some better SEVENLEGENDTEEN songs

**aestheticen** (4): HIT outsold. Let me drop the [KOREAN]!

**BebeLuigi** (4): I just don't care for it it's quite boring

**suffocatedbears** (4): very visually appealing mv, but i feel like the song is lacking a strong hook? Not very memorable imo

**2dina3dworld** (3): the real fear would be if Seventeen thought that this was the best direction for their music to go in...

**snugsnhugs** (3): nothing to write home about

**DaBigBoi** (2): what i feel when i listen to this song

**foxinthenoodles** (2): Such a departure for Seventeen. Generic, doesn't fit their group's talents and uninspired.

**wavingwolves** (8.8): I feel like this is an important song for Monsta X because it feels like a bridge between their earlier noisy stuff and their later smoothier bops. IT feels like both of these things in one and it really works for me, even if it doesn't work for a lot of you. It does showcase a lot of their flavour as a group: if you liked the verses you should check their earlier stuff out (like 'Hero'), if you liked the chorus/bridge you should check what came after this. In any case, Monsta X is the kind of group that will have something for everyone. They're just versatile like that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): I was **obsessed** with this song when it first came out lol but as you can see, it’s grown off me a lot. It’s still good but I fear I really don’t like the chorus + I find the noisier instrumental in the verses much better.

---


# SHE IS VERY GORGEOUS TO ME!!!!


**2dina3dworld** (10): Hieut but make it better

**fadedblue09** (10): Monsta X's music isn't normally my taste but with the right song, I end up really liking them. The combination of the rap line's hard verses and Kihyun's soaring chorus just hits perfectly.

**grey/0x976** (10): helped put mx on the map i know thats right! Mx makes HITS YASSSSS DOWN MV A SLAY!!!!! WE LOVE YOU [whoever filmed this] YOURE PERFECT

**PSSST12** (10): The intro might be unpleasant for some but that chorus is perfection.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I love how this is actually the one song I actually knew before this rate and its soley because of the one episode of we bare bears that Monsta X was on

**Zypker125** (10): Almost gave this my 11 (was waffling between Crown, Spring Day, Rhythm Ta and Beautiful). It switches between intense hip-hop and emotional angsty dance-pop, which sounds disastrous on paper, but actually transitioned amazingly in the actual song. Kihyun and Wonho’s vocals were on fire, these were my favorite vocal performances from them of any single. Jooheon’s and I.M’s hard-hitting raps somehow worked despite the ballad-like undertones of the rest of the song.

**HeartofDarkness123** (9): The more melodically compelling counterpart to Hero.

**runaway3212** (9): The drop is almost perfection

**spacebunsailor** (9): deserved more than it got

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): I definitely prefer this to Hero; the intro is powerful and the chorus somehow carries that even if it's less in your face and more sweet in comparison.

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): The title is about the pre-chorus

**BoneStreetSand** (8.2): Really good but there’s nothing that makes this one stand out so I can’t give it a higher score even though it sounds amazing.

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**dekubaku** (8): Beautiful, indeed!

**SlphWsp** (8): Not a fan of the intro and rap but it's saved by an amazing chorus and out of this world performance skills

**sssaaage** (8): the drop is hyperpop actually

**throwaway7650** (8): prechorus + chorus are so good, I underrated this

**weappreciatepowers** (8): its hyperpop and cock music

**aestheticen** (7.5): One of the few MX title tracks I actually like

**hasanella** (7.5): this has nothing to do with the song but even before wonho got jacked he sure was a sight also i will probably like the song more after listening to in more

**suffocatedbears** (7.5): one of monsta x's songs that i enjoy

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): This is awful. I kinda like it

**elleyonce** (7): It kind of falls apart after the first chorus.

**hyphen-happy** (7): ik i've heard this before but do not remember it at all

**Sedona83** (6.5): Good rap, good beat, chorus is meh


# The opposite of beautiful  

**moonagenightmares** (6.4): the beginning of the song is actually so fun why is the rest so boring

**agentofscranton** (6): wish the whole song sounded like that chorus

**bespectacIed** (6): kinda bangs

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): why is wonhole not in the bonus rate i need to give my instathot fave the 10 he deserves

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ok it worked the first time but now you’re doing too much

**jaskiwhere** (6): Prechorus and chorus again gives me the early 10s sound which I love, but the rest of the song just ain't it

**RandomHypnotica** (6): it’s ok i guess

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): This just feels like they tried making a more mature version of their debut song 'Trespass' but missed what made 'Trespass' great.

**snugsnhugs** (6): I love a catchy chorus, the rest of the song doesn’t really do it for me

**nyoom** (5.5): just a standard monsta x song, but without the punch of bangers like rush or all in or hero

**frogaranaman** (5): I actually think this song was just average

**jasannn** (5): A lot more palatable than their most of their singles but sadly its kinda boring.

**orbiteezus** (5): this song is such a mixed bag for me bc while i despise the verses bc the instrumental is just really dated the chorus is so gorgeous and i wish that was the sound of the entire song

**BebeLuigi** (4): I'm not the biggest fan of Monsta X's songs lol

**PRADA** (4): the chorus serve but the verse is just NOISE

**foxinthenoodles** (2.5): Just too much going on, but none of it sticks or hits the right way.

deleted: [The song I was referencing ](https://youtu.be/9cQDsJqyNNc)

It’s a pre release Monsta X track under the name “No Mercy”, which was the title of the survival show that Monsta X was founded on. I think it’s really good, but a straight 10 where Beautiful was very nearly an 11
