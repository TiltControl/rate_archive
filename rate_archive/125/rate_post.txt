Hispanic Art Pop Rate (Rosalía / Lido Pimienta / Kali Uchis)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/oce34q/hispanic_art_pop_rate_rosalía_lido_pimienta_kali/

Hello to Colombians and [Colombians only](https://youtu.be/xRI6nOFRhx0?t=39)... okay, I guess the rest of you can stay too since I probably shouldn’t bar myself from my own rate, though you would be left in the capable hands of my wonderful cohost u/plastichaxan. 

Anyways, I feel very privileged to be co-hosting r/popheads' first Spanish-language rate and with telepatía reaching heights on this year's charts previously reserved for reggaeton and Shakira (who I'm sure will both get their dues in rates sometime soon!) now feels like the perfect time for it. The three albums in this rate all come from unique and extremely talented artists and each received international acclaim upon release. Their lyrics deal thoughtfully and evocatively in themes of women's agency and sacrifice so seeking out a translation to appreciate them is highly recommended. And with that out of the way, let's introduce them!

#### But first, a quick note on the rate title 

Yesterday, someone made us aware of [this article](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/problematic-history-of-hispanic-word) and expressed concern about the use of the word 'Hispanic' in the rate title. We briefly considered changing it, however, we decided to keep the original title, considering the inclusion of Rosalía in the rate. In this particular case, **we are using the word 'Hispanic' specifically to indicate the language of the albums, it is not a comment on any of the artists' personal identities** and is not a substitute for Latinx. I understand the experiences and identities of us Latinxs are varied and the experience of Latinx people living in the US is completely different to those of us outside it, so we all relate differently to these questions about our identity and I don't want people to feel like we're erasing the identities of women like Lido and Kali to include Rosalía, but calling this rate 'Latinx' or something more specific would feel wrong. I hope this clears up any concerns, the article is very well-written so I would suggest giving it a read, but for now let's enjoy these amazing albums and get to rating!

If you already know the drill because you're a regular rater, have a translation handy and are ready to feel like a sad/bad bitch (occasionally both at the same time!) here are the important links for you but I'd still encourage you to read through u/plastichaxan's writeups of the albums, especially if you're unfamiliar with any of them.

# ROSALÍA - EL MAL QUERER

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/355bjCHzRJztCzaG5Za4gq?si=9CgVIl_DRq6cpxLwiWCXyg&dl_branch=1) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-mal-querer/1436309944) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_msgS-wQpygK1gcJAfd-H2XnhsZUl9kvu8)

>I allow no man

>to dictate my sentence

>only God can judge me

>I only owe obedience to Him

\- *A NINGÚN HOMBRE (Cap.11: Poder)*

&nbsp;

Rosalía's second album is heavily influenced by her Spanish roots and what put her on the map. It's a conceptual album based on the novel *Flamenca*, which was written sometime in the 13th century. El Mal Querer adapts this into chapter-songs and throughout the album you can see Rosalía's desire to mix classic elements from genres like Flamenco with modern elements taken from Trap and so on, reflecting her view that *Flamenca’s* narrative is still relevant today. The chapters tell the story of a relationship similar to the one in the novel: a couple gets married and the husband becomes so jealous that he doesn't want anybody to see his wife to prevent any temptation and the relationship quickly becomes abusive. However, in the end she gets herself out of it after the journey depicted by the album. The chapter titles basically tell you the concepts of the songs: Augury, Wedding, Jealousy, Dispute, Lament, Closure, Liturgy, Ecstasy, Conception, Sanity and Power - these concepts thread the tale through her sonic experimentation while her lyricism relays it in a poetic way that, upon analysis, tells the story of a woman finding strength in ending this relationship that was not good for her.

Following the success of El Mal Querer, Rosalía got a lot of positive attention from critics and peers alike, leading to her getting hits beyond just Spanish-speaking countries. Rosalía released a couple of singles following the album and she disclosed that none of them will make it onto her next one, so we decided to include a few of them here - the ones that fit the rate theme the most and some of her most acclaimed.

# Lido Pimienta - Miss Colombia

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6H6MZ54B5FLBLXXxWGEl7y?si=rM1mbEZWRLWAuneeAUysjw&dl_branch=1) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/miss-colombia/1494471811) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ7QPuvv91Jv1V9dftrgLnX7agxSONH0Q)

&nbsp;

>Today I understood, sitting in your sand

>That because of you I stopped being myself

>It's not your fault that you are like this

>And don't give me anything if you don't want to

\- *Eso Que Tu Haces*

&nbsp;

Lido Pimienta says herself that the main theme of her album is her toxic relationship with her country and that concept, as a Colombian person, really gets to me. This album means a lot to me personally - it explores themes of womanhood, motherhood, racism and what it has meant for her to be a woman of color having these experiences, particularly in Colombia. While I do not relate to a lot of these struggles, when you grow up and become a more observant person, you notice just how much women and especially women of color go through, and the way she expresses this in her music, primarily through her lyricism, is extremely powerful. Colombia is in the midst of a national strike that has been going on for the last two months and when I decided to revisit this album on one of the first days of the strike, its portrayal of this complicated relationship of loving our home while acknowledging that it's not the best for us became so much more impactful that I'll never forget that listen. We’ve also decided to add her Spotify single, her cover of Björk's *Declare Independence*, due to the content of its lyrics. [**Here**](https://pastebin.com/b1G6RkZ5) is my track by track breakdown of the album for anyone wanting a more in-depth look at each song.

# Kali Uchis - Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/00wSTrFxoSzA7eeS1UxHgd?si=8bpqMLHDQYKsg1lmFndgFA&dl_branch=1) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/sin-miedo-del-amor-y-otros-demonios/1541730865) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kBGNJgDfASUCsU_DqzNagSzjhqjGjmJZ8)

&nbsp;

>It was better to fly so I wouldn't fall

>No, love, It doesn't hurt me to lose you

>I'm no longer there but never forget

>There are things that get tattooed without ink

\- *fue mejor*

&nbsp;

Kali's second album, her first in Spanish, meant a lot for her in many ways: it delivered her first hit, a lot of notoriety in Latin America that she did not have before, wider acclaim than she’d gained previously and proved, especially to her label that was resistant to her putting out an album in Spanish, that sticking to her own vision paid off. It is clear Kali took a lot of inspiration from her Latin roots - from more modern sounds like reggaeton, to 00s latin pop, to older genres like bolero - without losing her usual style in the process and evolving in many ways, particularly showcasing her improved vocal abilities on songs like fue mejor and vaya con dios, having received coaching for them.

The album’s title comes from a sentence Kali's aunt used to give as advice a lot: "[be] without fear", and like El Mal Querer’s inspiration, *Del amor y otros demonios* is also a novel, this one being written by Gabriel García Marquez. While unrelated to the novel in terms of story, the album captures the essence of the magical realism that's very characteristic of Latin/Colombian authors, especially García Marquez. The album also has pretty clear themes of Kali finding herself on her own, finding strength in herself and being a bad bitch in the process, which is why the album goes from slower songs about letting someone go and being okay with that and better on your own, to boppier songs about finding yourself and embracing that you're a fearless badass.

# Rules & Instructions

#### PLEASE READ THESE THOROUGHLY TO AVOID HAVING TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BALLOT LATER.

- **You must listen to and score every song in the main rate.** Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.

- **Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10** and can include one decimal place but no more. So 7.3 is fine but 7.31 is not.

- **You may give one song in the whole rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0** so, if you want to award these scores, save them for your favourite and least favourite songs in the rate respectively. **You must leave a comment on the songs you give these scores to** and they must be songs from the main rate, not the bonus.

- **We'd encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:
    >No Pude: 6 I wish I could give you more.

    Any other format such as:

    >quiero sentirme bien: I wish I felt good too girl! (10)

    >BAGDAD (Cap.7 - Liturgia): 1: Cry me a river.

    will get your ballot rejected.

- If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving colon then a space after the album title:

    >Album: Miss Colombia: Steve Harvey has been real quiet since this dropped...

- **Your ballot must be formatted exactly like the template in the message link** so make sure you use it or the template in the backup pastebin for your scores to be accepted.

- **Your scores will not be confidential** and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.

- **DO NOT SABOTAGE** the rate by giving outrageously low/high scores for the sole purpose of skewing the results, we reserve the right to exclude any ballot we suspect of this. If you're worried your scores could be mistakenly perceived as such, all you need to do is leave comments explaining the reasoning behind them.

- **If you're having trouble with lyric translations** or any other concerns with the language barrier, you're welcome to DM u/plastichaxan to get help resolving them.

- **If you want to change any of your scores** or comments after you've already submitted your ballot, feel free to message me before the submission deadline to sort it.
