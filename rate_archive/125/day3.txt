**plastichaxan** (9.5): Now onto the list of issues I have with miss Uchis is an explanation on why this wasn’t in the album, it fits so well in the reggaeton-inspired section, it’s a BOP, it did great, some sites (*cough* BeatSense) still have it listed as the lead single for her second album and then nothing.

---

# YO PERREO SOLA

**1998tweety** (10): bop, deserved to be on the album

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is so hot

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow why did she cut this? This is great! Solid attempt at regggaeton while showcasing her vocals. IT even fits the album thematically.

**skargardin** (10): would've been an album highlight if it was on sin miedo tbh

**throwaway7650** (10): idk where this would fit in the tracklist but it grew on me a LOT

**trinity** (10): - BANGER

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I kinda roll my eyes at “in love with a bad boy” songs (and Kali has a few of those) so this is a nice change of pace, plus “diablo” is a word that’s just always fun to hear sung. Great groove too

**waluigiest** (9): it really moves

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): this is a bop but the production is such a whiplash from the other album with how generic it is

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): This song is so catchy! I can't help but like it! Kali sounds great here and sings along the beat so well. This may be my favorite more trap/alt-R&B song of hers.

**KennyEarthman** (8): me making up a break up scenario in my head so I can relate to the song properly

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): okay...bop

**stryxen** (8): Solita is the first single from Kali Uchis' highly anticipated unnamed sophomore album.

# Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over

**runaway3212** (7.9): marina outsold

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): dulce beat

**NotWith10000Men** (7.1): she sounds great every time she says solita

**bbfan132** (7): doesn’t totally stand out to me but i’d listen to it again, it’s nice

**iniekcja\_** (7): my perception might be tainted by my friend's opinion of this

**plastichaxan** (10): uwu in song form, but seriously this feels so chill and relaxing, this is the kind of vibe I want from my next trip no matter what, just all of it.

**bulforster** (7): Okay so I’m clearly missing something here because this is one of the weaker Sin Miedo tracks for me and definitely not the best deep cut. Something about the beat is just a bit awkward, although her vocals are heavenly.

---

# UwU

**buddhacharm** (11): rawr xd uwu @@ .. (in a good way)

**engifear** (10): uwu

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is hot oh wow

**qazz23** (10): Really smooth vocals; like the language switching here

**seanderlust** (10): %ᵕ‿‿ᵕ%

**stryxen** (10): i regret every saying this was forgettable it’s the most relaxing song in this rate and can always bring a smile to my face

**waluigiest** (10): marina mad as hell she couldn’t put this on FROOT

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): such a cool laid back vibe

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): you can tell she’s having fun with how many vowels are in Spanish.

**fadedblue09** (9): Very sweet and sultry sounding at the same tine

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): ngl, almost hit the spam button… Anyways I’m a big sucker for taste imagery in music, I think it’s one of the most appealing and “vivid” senses that language can appeal to and the language Kali uses here reflects the track’s syrupy sound perfectly AND it’s a nice extension of the garden imagery we’ve been seeing so far.

**KennyEarthman** (9): gardener queen

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this chorus is so :wendyvibe:

**rslashpoopheads** (9): oh we vibing

**runaway3212** (9): a bit of a mess but a very very fun mess

**vayyiqra** (9): This is great! Side note, I've always wanted to try aguardiente. Sounds good.

**throwaway7650** (8.5): smooth like ~~butter~~ liquor y limón

**DaHumanTorch** (8.3): %ᵕ‿‿ᵕ%

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): the title is serving (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

**1998tweety** (8): bops, the uwu face in the title is a bonus

**bbfan132** (8): :floating: this was v pretty

**iniekcja\_** (8): the emoji is serving cunt

**just\_thonking** (8): this title is so funny

**skargardin** (8): uwu

# OwO

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why does this song have a uwu in the title … it’s great otherwise!

**rickikardashian** (7.5): manually scrobbling this is hell

**NotWith10000Men** (6.9): need to fix the transition btwn this song and fue mejor, that was v abrupt.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I shouuulllld like this song but I'm not feeling it. The way Kali sings "taste the fruit" is not great to me. I like the lyrics but overall the whole sound isn't my thing. And the shaky vibrato on some of the notes I'm not into.

**plastichaxan** (10): Another 11 contender, I’m a sucker for this type of experimental production, and while there are experimental songs throughout the rate, there is nothing quite like this, I hope to hear more of this side of Lido cause it just blew me away, and still does. I really wanted to see this in the top 10 I hate to see it missing out but I’m also glad y’all didn’t do hyperpop dirty once again.

**bulforster** (9): Obviously the production is the standout feature of this song and really differentiates it from the rest of the album as the darkest sounding song. This is matched by the lyrics being at their most hopeless which I think is an important emotion to capture in this age of doomerism.

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): this song feels like a dream, but like a dream coated in layers of dark mist and listening to it is blowing that fog away and unravelling something beautiful

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I can't believe I'm NOT giving my 11 to a Rosalia song since I've stanned EMQ for so long right now. But this song was a total surprise for me and I love everything about it. Lido's singing, the inventive beat. Sublime! Really interesting lyrics about giving your all to someone but still feeling shame about the relationship coming to an end. That she didn't see that person for what they were at the time, but she does now. This almost sounds like is SOPHIE (RIP) produced a Rosalia song. But Lido makes it her own and her singing is stunning here.

**engifear** (11): If this leaves day 1, I will selegend myself

**radioactive-isotopes** (11): Very different but it’s just my favorite of them all

**1998tweety** (10): this song is so wild and different from the prior ones I thought this was a different album or something. Love this song

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is hyperpop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wow i LOVE how different this is, this goes HARD

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The production sound so fresh and experimental, and it serves to complement her powerful voice, not drown it out. Truly a banger!!

**throwaway7650** (10): hyperpop intro, we love to see it... wait what do you mean those elements remain throughout? this song is so unique... that ending? WOW

**trinity** (10): OK PRODUCTION...my fav so far

**xavieryes** (10): this gives me slight PC Music vibes and i just love it

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): so much time has passed and I still don't know if I enjoy the intro

**bbfan132** (9): really interesting production, i liked this a lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): ~~is this hyperpop?~~ Kind of a Trojan Horse as a lead single because it’s a lot “poppier” than the rest of the album but I can see why she went with it because it’s undeniably a smash. The production is so gritty and kinda futuristic but in an archaic kind of way, if that makes sense. I think the bluntness of the lyrics (as I understand them) works here, the repeated “I can’t” and “I have” phrasing is ear catching and hammers in her points well.

**ManofOranges** (9): I can't

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): omg arca hispanic art pop rate debut yass. wait now i just imagined an alternate universe where arca’s s/t was the 4th album in this rate :(

**qazz23** (9): I like the horns at the end

**runaway3212** (9): I like this album so fucking much ugh

**sarcasticsobs** (9): would never have expected the intro beat to this

**akanewasright** (8.9): I love how… squishy? The beat gets here

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): that instrumental 👀 i’m listening

**fadedblue09** (8.5): The message of this song really hits hard when you have a complicated relationship with your own country

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I'm getting almost Sophie vibes from the production

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this is pc music

**vayyiqra** (8): I definitely agree this is one of the best-produced songs on the album. The instrumental tracks are a highlight here.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.6): most interesting sounding song so far in the album

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the production is super interesting on this

**KennyEarthman** (7): the beat is so crunchy. like if I can eat it I would just for the texture

**stryxen** (7): arca is in the rate after all ??

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (4): The electronic beat wasn’t for me, I do like the brass (?) at the end and the visuals for the music video a lot though.

**bulforster** (8.5): As a former flautist, I kind of can’t help but love a song that makes the instrument sound cool, especially when it’s incorporated into jazz or funk because that was always my favourite to play.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): I can’t lie, it was very hard for me to get into this song, still is, I feel like Kali can do so much better that it just feels a bit plain for me, but still it’s a very good song, I just feel like it could’ve gone further especially with this lineup.

**bulforster** (10): The consensus seems to be that the second half of the album is less immediately ear-grabbing than the first so I’m glad Lido ends with such an impassioned and triumphant song before the outro and that you all appreciated it! (Well, most of you… check the rank graph)

**plastichaxan** (10): This song really struck a cord(? is that the word?) in me when I rediscovered the album this year, of course, with the political climate going on here, but also because I didn’t remember this much and I found it shocking to myself, how dare I not remember such a beautifully haunting song. I’m so so happy this made it this far!

**NotWith10000Men** (9): yessss I've been waiting for a bop

**vayyiqra** (9): This is great! I love the instrumental on this, the lyrical themes, everything.

**waluigiest** (9): THAT harmony

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): Love the themes of resistance against the damage her country Colombia. All the themes in the album about trying to give her all to this country that doesn't love her back.

**runaway3212** (8.5): I thoroughly enjoy this

**throwaway7650** (8.5): this song truly is anthemic despite the bleak lyrics and the ongoing situation in colombia, I hope the people of colombia can find peace

**1998tweety** (8): bops

**bbfan132** (8): :listening: the production on this album is v good

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I like the lyrical content of her songs but it’s the instrumental that sometimes I don’t care for. That all said, I really like the backing vocals here and I really like the intention behind having what I think is really bright production and instrumental for a song about resisting.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): dig the drum line feel

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Love the message, don’t like the song that much. It picks up as it goes on but something about the music just feels a bit “one dimensional’ compared to the rest of the album. She does a lot with both simplicity and excess on this album and this song feels like it falls into a weird middle ground sonically.

**plastichaxan** (10): A bop for the girls to dance to! This feels like an anthem, this IS an anthem for the nails girlies and the fashion girlies. I’m not surprised at all that this is the “extra track” that made it furthest overall because I can see why.

**bulforster** (9): As what is probably Rosalía’s most ~~ff--~~ pop-friendly song, it makes sense that this is her loose single that got the furthest. I love those little runs she uses to punctuate the end of the verses’ lines, such a serve… ¡Bájale!

It’s not the right tempo to dance to, nor is a hype song, nor is it a ballad, nor is it really a singalong… also the chorus annoys me

**plastichaxan** (11): I 11d this cause it’s one of the prettiest songs I’ve ever heard, this kinda makes me want to get into a relationship fabricated to relate to this, or just go far away and change a lot in my life to relate to this, but I’ll settle for making up these scenarios in the meantime. This was the first song off Miss Colombia that I fell in love with and it’s too special for me so it earns my 11.

**bulforster** (9.5): I love how light and breezy this is after the weight of the previous two tracks and before the hopelessness of No Pude, while still lyrically fitting its placement. The steel drums also lend it a unique brightness on the album, setting it apart and landing it a solid top 10 placement.

---

**just\_thonking** (11): This song is infectious and beautiful. Also I love her voice so much

**Roxieloxie** (11): I really love this!!

**TiltControls** (11): I really love how light this is, and it fits so well with the theme of letting go and freeing oneself! Lots of good stuff on the album but this one takes the 11 for me

**xavieryes** (11): The production of this track is wonderful. The use of instruments in Lido Pimienta's songs is incredible, and this song is the main example of that. And the melody is just perfect. I had never listened to a single Lido Pimienta song before this rate, I'm really impressed with the album, and this is the highest point of it for me.

**fadedblue09** (10): Can the word "colorful" be used to describe a song? Because that's what I think this is.

**qazz23** (10): Like the tropical sound of this

**trinity** (10): this was so so good

**waluigiest** (10): everything about this is so beautiful: the bouncy beat, the writing, the orchestration with the breathy saxophone. So excellent

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): The song starts off slow but it's still so addicting. Steel drums and woodwind flourishes. I like the themes of this album where Lido goes into what this person/her country has stolen from her--her time, her sanity, her joy. I love the frustration of the lyrics juxtaposed with the bright instrumentation.

**1998tweety** (9.5): this is nice

**bigbigbee** (9): Her ear for melody is incredible. I feel so much joy listening to this. It sounds like yellow and green and orange and pink flowers.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): gotta be my favorite of the album. so groovy, the summer vibes are on point.

**rickikardashian** (9): add lido pimienta to the 3rd Te Bote remix

**stryxen** (9): lemme dance omg

**runaway3212** (8.5): Not quite as good as the two songs before it but still great

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): don’t really like that horn

**KennyEarthman** (8): I like the marimba sounding instrument there

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this instrumental :wendyvibe:

**skargardin** (8): this production is so interesting

**throwaway7650** (8): love that the lyrics could be about a person or colombia [2]

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): i like the island vibes, but it kinda went on for a touch too long

**bbfan132** (7.5): i like the melody quite a bit

**Gonza\_90** (7.5): Could be higher if it didn't remind me of Te Boté

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.2): idk what this reminds me of but it hits kinda deep?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The album has been on a hot streak up until this point but this one doesn’t hit like the previous tracks do, I appreciate the story she’s telling but the lyrics are a little bit blunt and the melody isn’t super interesting. I like the instrumental though and it does ramp up as it goes

**NotWith10000Men** (7): interesting melody, and it really picks up after 2 mins

**plastichaxan** (9.5): If A Volar was what Colombian pop mostly sounds like, this is what (good) Latin Pop in general sounds like to me. I’m an MTV Latinoamérica kid so Ximena Sariñana is a huge part of that and seeing this collab made me so excited.

**bulforster** (8): And Lido is first out of the bonus rate, which was unfortunately kind of expected. While her songs put in a great showing, all surviving day 1, it was hard to imagine them beating the giants of the bonus rate, Con Altura and 10%, especially given those are a bit more accessible to the general pop music audience. Still I love how the three artists’ voices play off each other in this song and top 3 is nothing to scoff at.

---

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**throwaway7650** (9.5): the collabs between woman in this rate are IT... men (for the most part): try to keep up!

**bulforster** (10): This is such an impactful climax to El Mal Querer and it’s a bold choice to make the centrepiece of the album a song about utter hopelessness. I actually think she imbues the Cry Me A River melody with a lot of grandeur that wrests it away from the pettiness of the original and justifies its weight more.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): I was prepared to give this a 10 but while this holds up, I realized I stopped coming back to this song as much as I go back to the many 10s I gave this album.

**runaway3212** (11): This is perfect in literally every way, the sample, the hopelessness, it's just amazing

**KennyEarthman** (10): help I can't get the chorus out of my head

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): what else is there to say other than “this slaps”. also i predict this will reach at least top 10 :thots: ignore this comment if it ends up falling out at like #19 or sth yass

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I'm bad at music, is this a sample or interpolation? She sounds so good at the end too

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): her voice is kinda haunting but it's such a beautiful song???

**RandomHypnotica** (10): stunning and haunting, what's not to love

**TiltControls** (10): gotta say, i love the sampling on this album. but even outside that the song sounds gorgeous

**trinity** (10): this song makes cry. the choir is so so beautiful.

**seanderlust** (9): rosalia wearing the PubLIZity wig in the music video

**skargardin** (9): this music video is so insanely stunning

**stryxen** (9): this repetitive chorus is so charli like yass but i heard you the first time

**vayyiqra** (9): I love this song. Idk why, I just love the way it sounds. Also this is ~weird and random, but when I was a kid I had this fascination with the Arab world and Iraq in particular. Don't ask me to explain it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): This doesn't have the same highs for me as the earlier songs, but it's another well-made and beautiful song. Obviously very cool to interpolate the JT song. I had known this was a concept album before but really reading through the translated lyrics is cool. Love how well-thought out it is.

**bbfan132** (8.5): really pretty, i like the use of sampling here

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Isn’t this the capital of Iraq

**iniekcja\_** (8): it's cute but it could've gone for more

**throwaway7650** (8): could fit on the Game of Thrones soundtrack

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute a bit

# This song samples Cry Me a River by Justin Timberlake

**akanewasright** (10): I love the way that she uses the Timberlake sample.

**bigbigbee** (10): I dislike the Cry Me A River sample in this (thank you /u/bulfoster for placing the reference!), but I LOVE everything else. The choir, the vocal melodies, the piano, all great. EDIT: The sample grew on me. This is a 10.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): why did i just now realize this samples cry me a river i-

**TragicKingdom1** (9): we want the Justified rate !!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Ended Justin Timberlake

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): Sampling Justin Timberlake in a song about the descent to hell is so fitting, he’s not seeing heaven

**just\_thonking** (8): Timberlayola?

**ManofOranges** (8): I was NOT expecting to hear the cry me a river interpolation omg

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I feel like I’m crazy… one of the Pandora stations at my work plays string arrangements of pop songs sometimes and I thought one of the songs was “Girlfriend” by MNEK but now I’m thinking it might be this? [Does the start of this song sound like the chorus of “Girlfriend?”](https://youtu.be/cI-NEa8u9R0?t=86) This is cute though, I like how it sounds so dreamy and almost angelic even though it’s about a fairly dark moment in the album’s storytelling, the dramatic irony works. Edit: I looked it up and it turns out that the song the Pandora is playing is actually [“Cry Me A River” by Justin Timberlake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DksSPZTZES0), which I had somehow never heard before because this entire time I thought that Justin Timberlake had recorded a cover [of the jazz standard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gn9A-kdsRo)

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): she sounds amazing but the cry me a river melody feels so out of place here 😭 which is unfortunate because it's such a small portion of the song but it's enough to take me out of it

**bulforster** (10): I think this is my favourite Rosalía song so I’m glad it got as far as this, especially since we weren’t sure it would early in the voting period. The lyrics are so evocative and those synth hits are pure ear candy and such good representations of pangs of jealousy.

**plastichaxan** (10): Now this was the first song from her that I looped, I showed it to everyone I could, I was obsessed with it. Overtime, I’m obviously not as excited cause that new element has disappeared, and yet, this holds up so well.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): ok this chorus whew

**martintorov** (11): I'm still in awe with what she did in this song.

**NotWith10000Men** (11): one of my favorite choruses EVER. The melody of it and the backing vocals make me feel like I'm floating

**whatyourheartdesires** (11): just beautiful. The video is amazing too

**ywonic** (11): this song is truly transcendental

**fadedblue09** (10): My personal standout on this album. I love how it balances the sultry and the sinister, and it captures the theme presented in the previous track much better.

**Gonza\_90** (10): Is simply a beautiful song

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): BOP

**iniekcja\_** (10): this makes me want to learn spanish

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this has been stuck in my head since i first listened to it

**seanderlust** (10): jealousy is a disease get well soon x

**skargardin** (10): the hook is unmatched, what a bop

**trinity** (10): a literal cultural reset

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.9): Again another jam! Ugh her mind! I've heard this album since 2018 but I'm turning into a Rosalia stan account HELP

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): That chorus is so damn catchy

**runaway3212** (9.5): What I think is cool about the beginning of this album this album is how it continuously gets better

**KennyEarthman** (9): has a dangerous spy mission vibe, which is like fitting for the content

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Looking up the lyrics to this one really elevated it for me, now I understand the pain I hear in her voice. I do wish she repeated the chorus a bit less because it kinda gets old

**bbfan132** (8): kind of grew off me a bit but i still like it quite a bit

**stryxen** (8): these beautiful lyrics i’m simply in love

**vayyiqra** (8): I love the lyrics to this.

**1998tweety** (7.5): decent

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the worst non-interlude song. pleek

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I really like the continued use of established symbols of masculinity and violence with the bull, and you also have the scene with her loading what I think is a shotgun with alcohol on the table. I think the scene with her surrounding by the blades and guns is one of the more popular screen grabs of the music videos attached to this project. I don’t think I get everything in the music video but I do really like it especially because how much of femicide and domestic violence is revolves around feelings of entitlement and jealously, and coveting people.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): hmm...i raised the score for this. i like it, it’s just that i think it being after the previous 2 songs does it a disservice tbh

**plastichaxan** (10): Two queens maximizing their joint slay! Seriously, Rico singing in spanish, the whole vibe of this song is just so energetic, this is everything that girlbossery wants to be unironically, also the looks on the video and the video itself are such a serve, this made me so hyped for Sin Miedo when it was released but I’ll never forgive Kali for changing the tag to the song sdjlkdshsf.

**bulforster** (9.5): Such a cold-blooded banger! I remember losing my shit the first time I heard Rico start rapping in Spanish and she eats as always. This more than earned its place in the top 5 and as the highest rated Sin Miedo collab.

---

# Girlbosses

**95ztaehyung** (11): deserved telepatías success :( rico never misses

**Brendon-Urine** (11): this might be a basic 11 pick bc it's just a banger but what a banger it is. the production is on point, rico goes off, what's not to love? just wish it were longer

**engie :hungrythots:** (11): yasss this is catchy af :hungrythots:

**throwaway7650** (11): best sin miedo collab and it's not close

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was my 11 before i heard lido's album, god i adore rico nasty so much and her verse here is wonderful. and this video is just phenomenal

**buddhacharm** (10): I imagine them both stepping on me with those 20 ft tall heels that they wear in that High Heels game

**cremeebrulee** (10): their collab announcement was a moment, wish this was a bit longer though

**engifear** (10): My original 11 before Lido stole it

**GARjuna** (10): this is the one song I listened to on this rate pre-rate

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): ok mamacitas let's gooo

**ManofOranges** (10): Was not a fan of this song when I heard it back when it first came out... now I do think it's the shit

**pat-rickstar** (10): Underrated, it's a banger. Love Rico's verse

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this fucks

**seanderlust** (10): rico nasty I am free on thursday for lunch rico nasty on thursday I am fr

**skargardin** (10): it's the smash

**xavieryes** (10): ended Karol Conká (are there any other Brazilians around to get it) / jokes aside, another incredible song on the album, I wasn't expecting to see a Rico Nasty collab here but it's incredible

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): oh shit this slaaaaps

**stryxen** (9): girlboss behaviour good for them

**akanewasright** (8.8): this slaps etc etc but… this used to be track four on the album and it’s track 10 now? I think it works well as track 10, but why did it change? Why was it track 4 in the first place? I don’t think this was ever addressed????

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**KennyEarthman** (8): why are all the good songs way too short

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**vayyiqra** (8): I was not looking forward to this track because I do not tend to like Rico's music much (sorry to any fans) but this duet worked surprisingly well.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): I stan Rico so I gotta. Her verse is everything here for me.

# They hate to see a girlboss winning...

**runaway3212** (7.5): good but not as great as a lot of stuff here

**bbfan132** (7): kind of came and went but it was still fine

**bigbigbee** (7): Rico eats here but this grew off me a bit.

**iniekcja\_** (7): this is not a good song, but I will randomly start singing the hook every now and then so it deserves a 7

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Another generic song zzzz

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This feels beneath her but I appreciate that Rico sang some Spanish!

**bulforster** (10): The main thing I love about this song is how huge the chorus is while keeping all the instrumental layers clear from the titanic bass to the indignant horns to Lido’s passionate belting. I also love the little woodwind solo before the final chorus as well as how poignant the verses’ lyrics are and at this point I’ve basically just described the whole song because yes, I love everything about this song.

**plastichaxan** (10): I’m so glad this song got as far as it did, this song is very special to me, I showed it to my mom after she got out of a very difficult relationship and this song helped her a lot at that time, that’s when I realized the impact the music I listen to can have on people, and how these different perspectives come into play, cause to me, I do interpret this song about Colombia as a country, especially since I rediscovered some songs of the album during protests that were going on here.

---

# so true

**cremeebrulee** (11): lido is the one artist i did not know prior to this rate but wow did she blow me away with this!! i did not plan on giving her my 11 but that chorus is so vibrant and alive, how could i not omg ... i will definitely keep her on my radar now.

**fadedblue09** (11): The emotion and power of her voice is enough to penetrate the language barrier. Sounds anthemic despite the somewhat indignant lyrics.

**iniekcja\_** (11): yeah you know what I always considered this song so happy and vibrant, but now I read the translation and wow??? And this was one of my favorite tracks of last year

**pat-rickstar** (11): Loved this straight away when i first listened to the album, it's a clear 11 to me

**qazz23** (11): Love the vocals on the chorus, and the horns and synths too!

**seanderlust** (11): wasn't expecting this to be my 11 to be honest, but god what a song. everytime she sings haces on the chorus I believe I am at my most powerful.

**skargardin** (11): this really caught me off guard, such an insanely stunning song!

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The horn line on the chorus of this has always entranced me since the first time I heard it

**thedoctordances1940** (11): It's just such a pretty song and when the chorus kicks in, it's just absolutely stunning, I don't think any moment on any of the albums can quite compare

**akanewasright** (10): This is song is the definition of poohascend

**bigbigbee** (10): Whatever instrument opens this sounds like sunlight. I want more of it in music, please. Is it a harp? It’s astounding! I love her pure clear voice on this so much. The anticipation this song builds is great. This ALMOST got my 11.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): hold awnnnn this chorus???? the trumpets with her vocals runs???? it sent chills through me this was so excellent

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ugh what a SONG! a feel like I'm being hugged and transported to a beautiful new world. Love the lyrics of wanting to address a person who has wronged you. Love this (translated) lyric: "That it was because of you, that I stopped being me". Really cool disjointed opener and it's so hypnotic and the vocal layering and synth lines are just heavenly. This song will be my comfort for the rest of the year.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really like the choreography with the sleeves and the skirts and I like that she filmed it at San Basilio de Palenque. I also adore the lyrical content of this album so much. I love how it explores loving a country that hurts because countries are institutions and made of national projects that are often brutal and cannot ever love you back.

**GARjuna** (10): the chorus is triumphant

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A lot of pain in this rate, huh?

**Gonza\_90** (10): I love this drop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): end him bestie

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): the build-up works sooooo well

**rickikardashian** (10): while the ratcom was deciding rates for this cycle, i decided to listen to some of lido’s work to know if she had a fighting chance against 2 more well known artist. this was the first song i heard, and immediately i knew that she 100% had a chance. this deserves nothing but the best of acclaim in this rate.

**runaway3212** (10): What I like here is everything

**stryxen** (10): the NO ES AMOR refrain is maybe the peak of music ever

**KennyEarthman** (9): screaming along to the chorus is a calming experience 10/10

**ManofOranges** (9): OMG the chorus... do y'all know what she did? ESO!!

**waluigiest** (9): that chorus is EVERYTHING

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): got chills at the chorus woeis

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): I came back to this cause I liked it more than a lot of the other songs here but now it shrunk on me rip, the chorus is still great though but the verses drag a bit to me

**bbfan132** (8): really interesting production, this was good

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I will say as someone who studied spanish, I love how well she enunciates so I can actually understand the lyrics

**throwaway7650** (8): love that the lyrics could be about a person or colombia

**vayyiqra** (8): This has such a nice groove to it!

**plastichaxan** (10): Now this is a hit, this was the first step in realizing how much Rosalía could fit any genre while bringing her own identity into any type of song. I can’t believe this is not winning but I can’t lie, I love a good surprise winner moment. Also I know the choreography so every time this comes on at a party you better trust I’ll be performing it!

**bulforster** (8): While this is undeniably a bop, I can’t say I entirely understand why it’s one of her most acclaimed songs and it seems like enough of you agreed to pull an upset and deny it the top spot everyone seemed to predict was hers even though it did hold it for about half the ballots.

---

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah

**frogaranaman** (10): one time I was at a club in Madrid and this song was playing and this one guy was going in on it and I thought he seemed fun so I went to talk to him and he was blackout drunk so I gave him my number to hang out another time and when we hung out the next time I looked him up on Instagram and found out we have multiple mutual friends back home but just went to different colleges god I hate being a midwest gay why do we all know each other one way or another

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): if you don't like this song get THE FUCK out of my house

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop

**iniekcja\_** (10): summer 2019 nostalgia

**rickikardashian** (10): something something colonizer but in all honesty it was kinda embarrassing how rosalia washed every single release by an actual latino that year with this song

**seanderlust** (7): this one grew on me. I still don't like it quite as much as some of the other bonus tracks, but maybe check back with me in like a month to see how I feel

**vayyiqra** (7): It's kind of a bop even though it's too repetitive.

**stryxen** (5): this is exactly what i’d expect a rosalia and j balvin song to sound like

**plastichaxan** (10): I mean it’s in the title. It checks all the boxes. Great production, great collaboration from both, it’s very sexy, catchy, boppy, 10s across the board. I’m pleasantly surprised this won.

**bulforster** (9): Like on After the Storm, Kali has this knack for successfully delivering lines that would sound so corny coming from anyone else. Having them over this great groove from Kaytranada definitely doesn’t hurt.

---

**akanewasright** (10): I need to have my kaytranada stan era, only hot people stan kaytranada

**Awkward\_King** (10): kaytranada put his whole pussy into this song

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I genuinely like Kali’s lyrics in her songs about ego being bad but it is also immensely funny to me bc I think she also obviously has a very thin skin for criticism. I mean this in a derogatory sense when I think it really shows that she was a band kid. But also I really want to hear play the saxophone.

**engifear** (10): How convenient for the score to be in the title

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this may have been an 11 if it was in the main rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this Kaytranada album is honestly very good

**iniekcja\_** (10): if ARCA had to lose her Grammy, I'm glad she lost to this

**stryxen** (10): i was gonna give this a 100/10 but kali asked me for her 10% so here it is ugh

**throwaway7650** (10): if the main rate's main result will take from me, at least let me have my 10% with this song winning the bonus rate

**TiltControls** (10): 10%? more like... 10

**bbfan132** (9): still dancing to this

**vayyiqra** (9): I need to listen to more Kaytranada. He's very talented and gets a lot of critical acclaim, and also he's Canadian.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song got me into her, I find pretty interesting that it is one of the songs that sticks out the most but I can see why, she put a lot of her musical skills and knowledge in many different genres into a single song that started her journey into the big star she is today.

**bulforster** (9.5): And with that Rosalia is first to leave the rate! Towards the beginning of the voting period it seemed like this would be the song to break into the lead but it never quite managed to, despite a brief stint as a joint winner. It’s not hard to see why it never left the top 10 though, it’s such a striking opener with its minimal instrumentation creating a foreboding atmosphere to match Rosalia’s ominous lyrics. I especially love the way the claps are woven in with drums when the chorus hits, creating that really unique, stuttering percussive line.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this song is crack and definitely making the top 5, if not winning

**JunkyGS** (11): This was my first time hearing this album and song after so much hype surrounding it, so I came in with sorta high expectations, but did not expect Rosalia to display imo so many of her strengths in such a condensed powerful punch of an album opener. It is simple, airy, soft but with edge and still an ear worm!

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Is this a basic af 11 pick? Yes. Does it deserve it? Yes. The production on this track is stellar, it's incredibly catchy and beautiful lyrically, and the MV is absolutely stunning

**slimboyfriend** (11): I feel like a mysterious spooky tarot witch girl escaping a castle when I listen to this song

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this continues to be so fresh and i wish the rest of the album leaned more heavily into this sound

**vayyiqra** (11): This song will get stuck in your head and never leave.

**1998tweety** (10): smasha

**akanewasright** (10): This is just… the actual smash. The one that made everyone want more Rosalía. And it is just that much of a smooth fucking bop

**cremeebrulee** (10): everything in this track just works, it's a smash of an opener

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is the first Rosalia song I heard and I've been obsessed ever since. The minimalism and vocal layering are so addicting.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is a great way to start off the album and probably the moment where Rosalía best blends pop and traditional sounds. The almost trance-like “malamente” that she repeats throughout the song is so catchy and eerie in all the right ways.

**Gonza\_90** (10): It should have been named Buenamente because is so good

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): first song that i heard by Rosalía and it made me drop everything to listen to the whole album

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was the first Rosalia song I heard and I was obsessed. I love the flamenco blended in with pop it’s just so seamless

**ManofOranges** (10): BOP BOP BOP

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i don’t even know if this is a predictable winner or whatever but it’s such a banger so who cares

**qazz23** (10): Strong opener, like the multiple vocals in the chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (10): You turn off the bustling Paris street into a silent cobblestone alleyway. Your footsteps echo as you stride towards a worn oak door buried in the facade of an ancient building. Opening the door, you can faintly hear the flamenco rhythms of Rosalía's Malamente coming from downstairs. You strengthen your resolve and descend the steps, bringing you to the entrance of a remarkably glamorous abandoned bar. You see me lounging on a stool, sipping a glass of Chardonnay, cigar in hand. We kiss. I stab you in the back and heave your body into one of the rotting wood cabinets. I take your wallet and use the information I've gathered to commit identity fraud and steal all of your life's savings. Now I can finally afford the vacation in Atlantic City I've dreamed of since I was a young child watching the only VHS cassette I owned as a struggling orphan: the critically acclaimed film Wrestlemania IV. I've waited so long for this moment and now I've finally attained my life's goal. And none of this would have been possible without Rosalía. Thank you Rosalía.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This song is so cool and sets up the eerie tone for this album right away

**skargardin** (10): this is how you open up an album

**trinity** (10): THANK U BILLIE EILISH FOR POSTING THIS ON UR IG STORY & MAKING ME A ROSALÍA STAN :slight_smile:

**waluigiest** (10): how did she fit that many beautiful lyrics into 150 seconds

**iniekcja\_** (9): that was a classic! that was a classic

**just\_thonking** (9): mmm yeah

**KennyEarthman** (9): a bit basic but she works

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the hand clap rhythm is really fun.

**bbfan132** (8.5): super catchy opener!

**stryxen** (8.5): malay minty

**throwaway7650** (8.5): I really like this as the opening track, although not my favorite song on the album it sets the ominous mood well

**Brendon-Urine** (8): impossible to not clap along

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I really like the use of clapping for instrumental which is a huge appeal of flamenco in general for me. I also really like how this music video introduce automobiles as a symbol of masculinity and I think it’s a good show of how she and her team use contemporary things to reference old things like bully fighting.

**runaway3212** (7.5): This is beautiful but I've decided im gonna be super strict this rate and only give 10s when I don't have a choice so im super sorry to this song, if it gets sent to All Stars I'll 10 it there

**engifear** (6.5): This song is good, but I don’t get the hype

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Lyrically it makes sense as the intro but it lacks the atmosphere I expect from opening tracks

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I will never get why this was one of the most praised songs of 2018

**bulforster** (10): I cannot tell you the *stress* this song was causing me as the deadline drew closer and it looked poised to overtake my 11 after it had been winning pretty much the whole rating period. But now that I can listen to it again without being tempted to lower my score to rig the rate, this is obviously a 10 and a deserved smash hit. The pillowy synths and bass, the seductive lyrics, the amazing vocal performance… I have never felt cooler than when my sister and her friends were shocked that I already knew the song as it was blowing up.

**plastichaxan** (10): A HIT. No other way to describe this song, seeing this blow up has been one of my favorite moments following music ever, it was unexpected, deserved and quite the cultural reset, this song hits every mark of what a hit should be and it happened so organically and at this point I’m not tired of it, contrary to several other popular songs.

# TikTok rate participants

**1998tweety** (11): the biggest smasha in the rate

**bbfan132** (11): gorgeous song

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): this might seem a basic pick but there's a reason for it. This song has been EVERYWHERE: the radio, the stores, tiktok, my friend's playlists, and yet I still adore it and haven't gotten tired of it. And that is what makes a Good Song to me. The lyrics are fantastic, it's sexy without being too explicit or vulgar, the production is delicious, she sounds amazing here, what's not to love?

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this is a perfect song

**letsallpoo** (11): i am a basic homosexual and i cannot be stopped

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): if a song could be stunning this would be it. also this song helped me get thru last semester lmao

**rickikardashian** (11): im so basic

**rslashpoopheads** (11): I can read your mind like you're giving this an 11

**waluigiest** (11): i was ready to give this a low score because of the overplayed tiktok sample, but I was struck by how beautiful the writing and performance of the whole song are. It’s the spanish follow up to So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings

**akanewasright** (10): I really think this song is a guaranteed rate winner. That would be basic win, to be sure, but COMPLETELY deserved, both for the song and for Kali. If this loses, it probably loses to a perfectly deserving song too, and that would be exciting, but this would be a good win

**buddhacharm** (10): this song makes me feel so pretty

**cremeebrulee** (10): she made sexting seem like the dreamiest thing ever and that's impressive (also i'm glad this blew up and gave kali her little moment. i had this as an 11 initially so i would be very happy if it wins)

**engifear** (10): This was my non-single fave on first listen when the album dropped and I still love it (ofc it later became a single after it blew up on TikTok)

**fadedblue09** (10): A Tiktok smash! (or at least that’s how kids call it these days)

**Gonza\_90** (10): Best hit song of 2021 I think

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way this was flopping on the hot 100 when it was huge and then eventually radio caught up with it while it was dying, so it only had an ok peak on the hot 100 was very funny

**just\_thonking** (10): a perfect vibe

**KennyEarthman** (10): overplayed on tiktok, as she should

**ManofOranges** (10): It's just like... perfect to me. This was a STRONG 11 contender and I came into this rate thinking this would get my 11. Ultimately I decided to give it to Nada instead but this song was a very close second choice.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): wow this song is so good :soobcry:

**pat-rickstar** (10): Fully deserved all the success it's had, I wouldn't be mad at this winning

**radioactive-isotopes** (10): There’s a reason this became a hit

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a deserved tiktok hit

**seanderlust** (10): don't take a private plane king we need to fight climate change

**skargardin** (10): :slowflabster:

**stryxen** (10): not a single beat wasted

**throwaway7650** (10): this song is pure musical bliss, the start of the song (chorus -> verse -> chorus) is possibly the best ~1:20 or so of the whole rate. I do think the song "loses steam" during the 2nd verse and at the end but it's still a 10

**xavieryes** (10): a masterpiece

**Awkward\_King** (9): kali spit on me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is the current frontrunner I guess and I can’t even be angry about it, musically and lyrically this is a serve. I do wish that it had a stronger ending though, it just kinda peters out, but I guess that’s fitting for the themes

**runaway3212** (8.5): we love/hate tiktokyola

**iniekcja\_** (8): I promise I'm not giving all of these songs an 8 on purpose

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the rhythm of the verses is a lot of fun

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): This song has never been really my thing, it's pleasant but doesn't grab me.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): “You stay in the line just to hear me breath (on repeat)” is still a great line.

**GARjuna** (7): kinda wish one of the other songs was the title tracK

**bulforster** (11): I still can’t believe Lido actually did it!! And this song completely deserves it, it’s just incredible. While the lyrics read as hopeless, Lido and Li Saumet deliver them with such conviction that, while you do come away from the song with a sense of the weight of the oppression women, and specifically women of color, face you get a greater impression of their resilience and strength, especially when the choir comes in for that breathtaking final chorus.

**plastichaxan** (10): I wanted to 11 this and I’m so stoked it won! I feel like it’s just the best outcome I could’ve asked from popheads. This song gives me chills every single time, while I don’t share a lot of Lido’s experiences for obvious reasons, it’s not hard to have empathy about what women of color, especially afro-indigenous women go through, and having it in a context that’s so close and familiar just hits really hard and I’m so happy you guys can see that too!

---

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (11): Honestly it's such a testament to this rate lineup that I even hesitated giving this my 11, but ultimately even the other contenders couldn't stand a chance against this hauntingly beautiful piece

**bigbigbee** (11): This song is mesmerizing. The imagery it draws on is completely in line with the instruments and melody to me (I didn’t look up the lyrics until after a few listens, and it aligned perfectly with how the song “feels”.) It’s dark and moody, but as always her voice shines through like a bell, like moonlight in the darkness.

**celladonn** (11): I haven't really left any comments on this rate, largely because the language barrier leaves me at a bit of a loss for what to say but this is absolutely transcendent

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (11): I love the imagery in this video and I just really like the use of water in art. I like that the song is about the pains of being a woman. I think the part that starts with “Todo lo que yo esperé y todo lo que yo entregué...” is one of the clearer examples of using love songs or the language in those songs to talk about your relationship with your country.

**ManofOranges** (11): Perhaps my favorite discovery in the entire rate, my god... This song actually snatched my 11 like originally I would've given it to Kali or Rosalía but I'm just utterly blown away by this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): wow this song is so good...the chorus especially and the lyrics are amazing. those little “ooh”s are incredible. edit: this is now my 11

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): The way the song builds in intensity from the first delicate flute notes to full catharsis is so gripping. Even without understanding Spanish, you can feel the anger and resilience that they’re singing about, but of course looking into the meaning makes it even more powerful. We fucking hate capitalism, colonialism and the exploitation of the earth and women.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Coming outta nowhere to swoop the 11 away from "Malamente"

**stryxen** (11): when this comes on my body is possessed and i start ascending and everything around me starts levitating

**akanewasright** (10): EL DOLOR LO TENGO PRESENTE

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this was such a smash i had to replay this before moving on. the chorus is so addictingtly catchy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Ugh honestly? 10's across the board! This song is SO GOOD. I'm also a stan for woodwinds (a clarinet maybe?) so I have to love. Dang honestly the lyrics are how I'm feeling rn lol so I love that, but my heart is going to give an 11 to another song.

**fadedblue09** (10): Despite never addressing the subject matter directly, the emotions in her vocals are tangible enough. The mystic yet melodic vibe helps.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m almost scared of the bluntness of these lyrics, she really puts her whole self on the line here. It’s especially chilling when she switches up the lyrics on the final chorus and confronts the fact that she didn’t just suffer passively, she had to actively give parts of herself away and now she has nothing left except what she bares in the song. It’s very strong musically too, I like how they’re joined by other voices during the chorus and the voices only grow stronger as the song goes on… it makes me feel powerful.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): BOP

**iniekcja\_** (10): this is... immersive...

**KennyEarthman** (10): doesn't feel like a nearly 5 minute song tbh

**qazz23** (10): Love the flutes and vocals here, catchy chorus also

**vayyiqra** (9): The writeup on this song was so interesting to read about. I had no idea there were protests in my own country about things that happened in Colombia this year.

**plastichaxan** (9.643): I got into Rosalía when the singles were out, and when the album came out I ran so quick to listen again and again, I did very little research on the music that I listened to at the time, and even now, but this album was so impactful to me that I saw every reaction, read every analysis, saw every breakdown I could to understand it musically and every fact I kept learning about it just made the album be better in my eyes and I appreciate that a lot!

**bulforster** (8.750): The range of references this album pulls from is what blew away when I first heard it. Mashing up a 13th century novel with Destiny's Child, Justin Timberlake and Ocarina of Time?? And the fact the musical fusion matches this range is what truly makes it great.

**akanewasright** (9.057): madre mia colonizadora rosalía

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.043): Fell in love with this album in 2018 and I still love it. Love Rosalia's fusion of flamenco, alt-R&B and hip hop. Actually getting to read the lyrics of the concept album was great as well. Didn't know there'd be songs from the groom's perspective and lyrics dealing with the woman's isolation, shame and regret. Incredible.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.000): Rosalía really did make several points here. The concept is so strong, going through all the stages of grief and denial in an abusive controlling relationship before finally leaving.

**waluigiest** (8.500): I just learned this was her THESIS???? And to think I just wrote a research paper wtf

**iniekcja\_** (8.214): I was streaming this album all the time in 2019 and to be fair, most of the songs don't hit the same anymore but they still sound good and still feel somewhat fresh. Having seen her live adds even more to the experience, especially to songs like que no salga la luna

**skargardin** (8.214): I thoroughly enjoyed diving deeper into this album's visuals, themes and lyrics. I will definitely return to it and I appreciate this rate finally giving me a reason to actually digest it properly. Can't wait to hear what she does with her next record.

**buddhacharm** (8.036): "latina pasionada" - Rosalía Carmen "God" Farala

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.964): it’s been a loooong time since i listened to this album and it’s even better than i remember i fear

**thedoctordances1940** (7.929): This is honestly such a pretty album and it's really strong from back to front.

**vayyiqra** (7.786): I wish I had more time to write in detail about all these albums, but didn't leave myself much of a margin. However, I can sum up my thoughts by saying this album was the hardest to get into for me but worth the effort. It took quite a few tries. I honestly didn't like it much when I first heard it in 2018 and was left wondering "what's the big deal?", aside from a few songs like "Malamente" and "Bagdad". Reading the lyrics and following the storyline definitely helped a lot, and understanding this isn't an album to listen to while waiting for the bus (as I foolishly did the first time) but sitting at home and treating it more like a play or an opera. Fittingly for an album that's heavily inspired by flamenco and traditional Spanish culture, the storyline reminds me a lot of the side stories from Don Quixote. (Is that pretentious? Idk I just really like that book.) Anyway I'm glad this album grew on me at last and I can understand why it won so much acclaim.

**qazz23** (7.786): I like her vocals, but the second half isn't as compelling - the additional singles are very good though

**cremeebrulee** (7.779): rosalia's clearly a talented writer and i really enjoyed reading the story behind these songs. unfortunately, i almost would've preferred this album in a written form (like the book it's based on) because i vibed with it more lyrically than sonically. i do appreciate that this rate has given me a chance to listen to this in full and there are definitely tracks i will return to!

**KennyEarthman** (7.714): love how it's kinda enjoyable without any context yet also very rewarding when researched

**just\_thonking** (7.536): Sonically it's a mixed bag for me but lyrically it is poetry

**engifear** (7.429): This album was way better than I remembered

**NotWith10000Men** (7.379): somehow this became my go-to plane riding album during my one shitty semester of grad school and the album is so good that i can listen to it and not relive those terrible feelings

**fadedblue09** (7.286): This is definitely not an easy album to comprehend on first listen. On top of having such a left-field sound, it also has a quite complex premise. I think having knowledge of Flamenca (the novel) would have helped me appreciate this album more, but nonetheless using the album as a storytelling medium is commendable in its own right.. I also found the track transitions to be jarring at times, but it makes sense when understanding the story. Overall, I feel blessed to have finally heard this, even if it did not grab me fully.

**ManofOranges** (6.857): I was kind of disappointed by this album honestly. I had heard Malamente around the time this album came out and I have loved that track since I first heard it, so I guess that set my expectations somewhat high for this album. Unfortunately most of the songs were just alright for me, but not absolutely fantastic. Nothing really beats the high that I get when listening to Malamente, the very first track of the damn album. My average for this album is probably helped a little by the extra tracks that were added for the rate. Either way though, I think this album is just kind of middle of the road.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.071): now this is artpop

**Brendon-Urine** (5.536): rosalia obviously has a beautiful voice, but this album gets kind of meh for me when it feels like she's just flexing it. it worked a lot better on Los Angeles over the more folky instrumentation, but with these more rhythmic songs it doesn't work as well

bulforster: # Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞

---

**Overall Average**: 8.021 **// Average Controversy:** 1.338

---

**plastichaxan** (9.679): I adore this album, I said a lot of times during it that it’s a vibe but it is, every single song just evokes very specific feelings that I love to hear in music and it just filled a music void I had at the time of release, I don’t get tired of listening to these songs and I’m so happy these vibes are getting her recognition, I wanted a project in spanish from her and the end result was better than anything I could’ve imagined, it makes me so happy to see her just do her own thing and doing great at it, and also working on just improving even more, I can’t imagine what she would do next but I know it will make me obsessed as every project of hers has.

**bulforster** (8.036): I think this is my favourite of Kali's albums. It's not as conceptual as Rosalía's or Lido's but the vibes are immaculate.

---
**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.321): Kali’s best album, it flows so well with the different styles, sounding dreamy and ascension-worthy while also having bangers. Her vocals are stronger than ever and full of versatility.

**buddhacharm** (9.286): I cannot emphasize the gorilla Kuchi grip this album has on me honestly. I've been a fan since the release of Por Vida so it's...insane to see her career blossom into what it is now (she's p much ubiquitous now). After her trailblazing debut record Isolation, she had the public wrapped around her finger — instead of idly regurgitating the magic of her incredible debut, Kali went the path least expected, crafting an artful follow-up sung entirely in Spanish and supported by a collaborative cast of exclusively Latine talent. The music here sort of encapsulates the crossover appeal of the music that originally put her on the map and embellishing it with more personal touches of bolero and reggaeton. The result is something just as genre-defiant and eclectic as anything she’d ever released and imo an incredible mosaic of some of the best music she’s ever made. If "fans" aren’t willing to overcome the language barrier, then they’re missing out on one of the best albums of the decade so far

**waluigiest** (8.714): why do I feel like people don’t like Kali Uchis? This album was amazing, and I’ve loved Isolation since I first heard it a few years ago

**skargardin** (8.500): This isn't my favourite Kali project unfortunately (Isolation is just that good), even though it has some definite highlights.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.286): i underrated this album so much when it released :thots: i’m so sorry queen

**ManofOranges** (8.214): Ok I think this album is a serve, yup yup yup. I think it has my highest average of the 3 albums in this rate? I'm too lazy to calculate it but I think that's true and I think it's deservedly so. It's just so enchanting and so good and so delectable and so enthralling. Kali is just so talented to me.

**qazz23** (8.143): Enjoyed the smooth R&B sounds and how it switches between Spanish and English lyrics

**just\_thonking** (7.857): For me it's kind of like the Chloe x Halle album where the quality is consistently high but nothing really stands out to me (besides telepatia) and I don't see myself coming back to it that often

**fadedblue09** (7.750): I didn’t know what to expect since I wasn’t a big fan of Isolation (feel free to see my scores in the last rate), but I’m glad I ended up liking this! This album gives off this nocturnal vibe which makes it feel like riding into the night, and consistently delivers a sensual atmosphere more than its predecessor. But like Isolation, it falls a bit into the back half with collabs that don’t do her talent justice.

**KennyEarthman** (7.714): this is probably the most basic of the three albums but it has some bops nonetheless

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.679): I feel like a lot of the songs on this album are very short and I wish they were more fleshed out. Also to be honest I don’t like the cover art or really get it which is first for me with her. I like the pink though.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.643): While I don't love this album myself, it's really consistent and I can absolutely see why somebody would really love it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.500): Never heard it before because I've never been really into Kali Uchis. But I was pleasantly surprised! Some songs were still a miss for me. But enjoyed some songs too, especially those harkening to a classic sound. And I love me some reggaeton. I could hear the Amy Winehouse influence on some of the ballads. And the additional song Solita is a total bop I'll add to my playlists.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.464): i only know kali from the song that's on the radio but i really enjoyed this album! ended up ranking it juuuust higher than rosalia's which suprised me but kali brought the jams. just sad that my faves were the shortest ones!

**iniekcja\_** (7.286): this is not a bad project. This simply just feels weak, compared with both the other albums in this rate AND Isolation. I still think some of the tracks really grew on me but I don't see myself coming back to this for any reason.

**vayyiqra** (7.071): I don't have as much to say about this album as the other two, but it is very enjoyable. Kali is an artist I've always liked but don't listen to often, so I think I should change that. I also haven't looked into the meaning of the lyrics on this album unlike the other two, which is a drawback. I'll have to make a note to do that soon. Anyway, I'm not sure if I like this album as much as Isolation, so it's a worthy followup.

bulforster: # Miss Colombia

---

**Overall Average**: 8.009 **// Average Controversy:** 1.456

---

**plastichaxan** (9.750): This album means so much to me, yes, I listened last year and several songs really stuck with me, but I rediscovered it earlier this year during some protests that were going on here, I saw a lot of violence in them, a lot of pain and silencing and it was one of the most scary and frustrating experiences I had had in a while, considering we were still in lockdown at the time. One day I went to the protests I came back home and didn’t know what to do or listen to, and I saw this there, and I decided to listen again and convey all these complex feelings about Colombia as a country while seeing all these experiences of the people we were fighting for in music form, it just blew me away and became an album too important to me and I hope this album just gets more and more appreciated with time because it’s truly a masterpiece.

**bulforster** (8.625): I came up with this rate idea partially as a Trojan horse to make more people listen to this album and it makes me so happy to hear how much you all enjoyed it! I was blown away the the first time I heard it and appreciated it even more after diving into the lyrics.

---
**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.625): This album is such a triumph, going from pensive to playful to fiercely political with ease. Lido is a real artist and I feel like I learn something new every time I listen to her.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.242): I'm so glad I finally listened to this album! So lush, beautiful with driving beats and captivating lyrics. Cool to hear all the double meanings of love lost of a relationship to self, others and one's country.

**iniekcja\_** (8.792): this is the best album in this rate (i hope my scores say so too since i didn't calculate the averages). The lyrics are great, the melodies are memorable, the music carries a message and showcases Lido's heritage and inspirations beautifully. This was in my top 20 of last year and if I were to rate it now i think it would rank even higher.

**skargardin** (8.500): This was such a pleasant surprise, so sonically diverse and interesting. Her vocals are absolutely beautiful throughout too. I will definitely be returning to several songs in the future!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.417): I don’t relate to all of Lido’s experiences as I’m neither Indigenous nor Black but God I relate to having a fraught relationship with your family’s country. Some of her collabs I like more than tracks here because I’m not that big on electronic music but I do love how she combines younger genres with older ones and it’s definitely interesting knowing she makes sound choices based on thinking about how she’ll perform them live without a band. there’s so many essays about what Beauty pageants reveal about countries that this album could have easily been sparked even without Colombians racist remarks about Harvey and Miss Philippines when Miss Colombia was only runner up (and if she won).

**qazz23** (8.417): Great production and vocals, though it lags in the middle

**fadedblue09** (8.333): On first listen, this album really stood out to me because of its unique sound, a combination of experimental pop with various Colombian folk genres. The diverse sounds really matched its colorful cover, but understanding her lyrics and reading into her background made me appreciate it more. I like how she proudly wears her national identity, while addressing her complicated relationship with her own country. Honestly as a resident of a developing country myself, those sentiments hit me a lot.

**buddhacharm** (8.083): This and SAWAYAMA came out on the same day last year and I always imagined a linkage between the two — both are potent tributes to healing from colonial wounds and are overall incredibly dynamic explorations of their complicated relationships with her heritage. Miss Colombia is one of the most beautiful albums I've heard, point blank period — the pristine imagery, the intricate soundscapes, the profound messaging...everything converges into an experience that is ascendant and sublime. If you're missing this, you're missing out

**just\_thonking** (7.958): In terms of the listening experience, I could do without the more traditional tracks, but as a cultural artifact I think they are very important

**KennyEarthman** (7.833): she expressed her discontent by making a masterpiece. brb making a Miss Philippines

**thedoctordances1940** (7.792): I do really like the start of this album but I think once it gets into the more traditional folk stuff I kinda lose interest. It's not bad I just don't think it's for me.

**vayyiqra** (7.667): Lido is an artist I underestimated quite a lot at first. Much of Canada, including me, unfortunately first heard of her because of the controversy over her concert where a photographer claimed that she was discriminated against, which isn't a great first impression. However, I still gave her first album a fair chance and liked it, and played it on my college radio show where I also talked about this incident, which I think was mischaracterized a lot in the media. Anyway! I would rather not think about that as it's been settled to me, and instead focus on her music. This album is quite enjoyable, and quite different from La Papessa which I remember as being more electronic and experimental, somewhat in the vein of early Grimes. On this album I can see she embraces sounds from Latin American music and uses more traditional instrumentation such as acoustic guitar and drums. The lyrics were also quite interesting to delve into, being more politically charged than the other albums here, since I have a longrunning interest in world politics. It spurred me to look up more about the events in Colombia over the last year and read up on that more and about the country as a whole. My knowledge of Spanish is only basic but I plan to go back to this album and try to understand its lyrics better, and do the same with her first album. (Also shoutout to Poppy for that breakdown of each track's meaning; it was very helpful!). As a Canadian I always love to see talented artists succeeding here, whether they are from here or not, so I'm glad Lido has gotten the recognition she deserves. Winning the Polaris Prize for her last album and making the shortlist for this album is a big deal! I'm happy for her.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.417): listened to this album for the first time while doing this rate so i didn’t know what to expect but it’s a confirmed detonation of the yass grenade. the second half is a bit weaker for me (apart from the final song) but the first half more than makes up for it!

**NotWith10000Men** (7.267): this is my introduction to lido and i'm very impressed. i love all the indigenous influence in the album and the backing vocals make a lot of the songs sound really dreamy.

**ManofOranges** (7.250): As with probably most people doing this rate, this was the album I hadn't heard of like at all prior to this rate. But boy I am pleasantly surprised by it. First half of the album is incredibly good to me and very mesmerizing and almost like something I've never heard before. It takes a dip in quality with Quiero Que Me Salves for me but by the end its worked its way back to a nice, solid closing and has left a very good impression on me. I do think I'll be listening to more of it in the future, certainly.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.708): as much as I appreciate how nice the lyrics are, the more traditional, folk sounding tracks really just aren't for me, and that unfortunately dropped my average for this album a bit

**rslashpoopheads** (5.417): this album feels like 2 EPs by completely different artists squished together lol but it has some real bangers

=====

TiltControls: Thanks to Bulforster and Poppy for holding an amazing rate! I didn't really know any of the three albums all that well before starting, but they were all great!! And the reveal was amazing! That BOTW shitpost was a work of art!!!

Now onto the [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates like always!


##**Songs**

Congratulations to Nada for pulling out the win today!! Especially with such a close and surprising (though deserved!) finish!

Both songs in the top 2 scored amazingly, with Nada becoming the **55th** highest rated song on the sub and telepatia not far behind in **67th**!

Nada also becomes one of [26 other songs](https://pastebin.com/KJ64aiUH) to not receive a score below 7 in its rate!


##**Artists**

As the sole artist to previously have an album rated, **Kali** has an ever so slight average drop of about 0.02 points which brings her 28th highest average down to 30th (so hardly a drop at all really).

**Lido** and **ROSALÍA** appear on the artist averages leaderboard for the first time (ROSALÍA was rated before, but only as part of the 2020 Ult Bonus). Our rate winner **Lido** manages to eke just above an 8 average with **8.020** (34th overall) and **ROSALÍA** places a bit lower, but still with a strong **7.946** (44th overall).

None of the three managed to crack the least controversial artists list, but all came very, very close with Lido, ROSALÍA, and Kali in the 13th, 14th, and 16th lowest spots respectively!


##**Rates**

Hispanic Art Pop received one of the lowest overall controversy scores across all rates! With a stellar 1.415 it sits as the 6th least controversial rate of all time! Including Kali seems to be a good way of getting on this list, as her previous rate (Isolation/Take Me Apart/When I Get Home) sits in spot #7. For highest averages, it just misses the top ten, but still lands in a respectable 14th place. The rate also lands in 5th for the least amount of 0's used in the rate (by percent) with a stellar 5.80%!
