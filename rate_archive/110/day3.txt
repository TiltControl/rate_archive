When I first heard this I had two thoughts "I LOVE THIS" and "this is gonna do so bad in the rate omg" it is a nine minute live session which people are bound to hate. Which is why I'm so relieved and happy that it made it to day 3. It is so bouncy it deserves all the love it got.

---

**bulforster** (11): FUCK YESS!!!! I knew this was my 11 from the first horn riff, it has the communal joy of a jazz improvisation and that rap?? What a fucking song!!

**kappyko** (11): SMASH!!!!! i know i'm throwing away my 11 but this is a fucking bop and the rap bridge is the greatest thing ever fucking made

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A bop and a half! These lyrics. Every single aspect is pure genius.

**bbfan132** (10): this is how you do a 9 minute song - making it an awesome jam session of a track

**frogaranaman** (10): this will get shit on for being long but damn it‚Äôs just so fucking good

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): bitch i got the serve let‚Äôs go

**seanderlust** (10): god it would have been bananas to see him live

**skargardin** (10): iconic i think

**igorwithlicor** (9): This beat is so good and the vocals are amazing

**plastichaxan** (9): i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever listened to anything like this before

**oscarbrierley1** (8.2): princes live songs always have a really good energy

**wryn\_** (8): This concert sounded so fun

**ziggytvs** (8): one hell of a jam. Prince doing his best James Brown, and Sheila's telephone rap is fantastic. RIP The Revolution. Can't nobody f*ck with us.

**1998tweety** (7.5): mama this is too long

**hepmeucsb** (7.5): Showcases his abilities as a performer, but overstays its welcome as a recorded song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): A song that doesn't deserve it's 9 minute runtime!!

**astrologicalangel** (7): repeat what I said about Starfish and Coffee

**DaHumanTorch** (7): this had 10 potential but oh my god it did NOT need to be that long

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this song bops but it could have been shorter instead of just being a jam session! but I‚Äôm not going to listen to a 9 minute song any other time other than this rate

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this probably went the fuck off live, but this is just me sitting in a dining room listening to this for 9 minute on my laptop, so that does affect the song.

**vayyiqra** (6): Kind of a bop but a 9 minute live song on an already long album is a Lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): nine minutesssssssssssssssssss I shouldn‚Äôt have put this off until the literal last minute! I‚Äôm sure the people in the audience had fun, I did not. Like if this were a concert album and this was the vibe and we‚Äôd built to this maybe I‚Äôd be into it but right now it‚Äôs just stopping the album cold, and the momentum wasn‚Äôt great to begin with.

i ADORE this song ;)))). But seriously it's so great a perfect closer for this great album. The instrumentation is great and I love how he sings. This was in the top 10 until the final few scores and even was the highest rated prince song for a while.

---

**waluigiest** (11): I see two long, gorgeous, funky explicit sex bangers in this rate. For me this one wins by a hair because it takes a slightly subtler, more literary approach with some crazy cool musical moments. It‚Äôs an amazing piece of music.

**bbfan132** (10): love this mellow ending to this wild album

**hepmeucsb** (10): Yep, this is the one. Absolutely incredible upon my first listen

**ziggytvs** (10): the ultimate love song. like, of all of them, of all time. orgasmic catharsis.

**seanderlust** (9.3): GOD this song is good. the comment in the original rate thread was right, someone was definitely made to this song.

**igorwithlicor** (9): Smooth and funky

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this definitely would go the fuck off live.

**stickywheels46** (9): One of Prince's best ballads, hands down

**bulforster** (8.5): This is a fantastic closer, I just wish his falsetto wasn't kinda grating to me.

**skargardin** (8): not my favorite on the album but it's a great closer all the same

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Courtney Act was robbed, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): Taylor: love you like a brother, Prince: more than a brother. And you guys don‚Äôt stan Prince??

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**AHSWeeknd** (7): A great choice for a closer.

**sirpancakeXI** (5): not a big fan for the high pitched voice

God he is so hot in this video. I guess I should say something else too. Releasing this as a lead single takes so much balls, but also a lot of brains as it put him on the news and made everyone talk about him. He says he hates this song and called it 'bad prince', but I disagree it is very distinctively him.

---

**hepmeucsb** (11): This song came for my virgin ass. Seriously, what an incredible song, and Prince‚Äôs and Jackson‚Äôs influences are really evident on this song.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): now why‚Äôd this song last longer than my last hookup with an anon grindr top

**ImADudeDuh** (10): makes me want to check 5 more boxes on my rice purity test

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song is 9 minutes, upbeat and really horny and you know what, thats a quarantine mood.

**skargardin** (10): whew

**waluigiest** (10): Masterwork. I‚Äôm a 90s baby so I‚Äôm trying to position myself in the 80s when this came out, straddling the AIDS epidemic and general Reagan-esque family value conservatism. This song is bold and stunning and I‚Äôm living for it

**ziggytvs** (10): the best prince aping ever

**bulforster** (9): I love the idea that this goofy-ass song with lyrics like "sex is good" and "sex is fun" was ever considered scandalous.

**igorwithlicor** (9): Smooth and seductive. It works for me! But George now says he's not my father when he wanted to be my father figure before? Sis, make up your mind

**J\_Toe** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvvHPE8VjcA

**mysario** (9): the entire time I'm thinking "what if 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' was 9 minutes long?"

**static\_int\_husp** (9): more informative than the average american high school sex ed class

**vayyiqra** (9): This song was an in-joke with me and my first girlfriend because it's ridiculous but also very catchy

**oscarbrierley1** (8.7): long but it changes up enough to stop it being too repetitive

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): so true

**1998tweety** (8.5): me @ Kaeya

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I love that campy bridge. ONE. ON. ONE.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): sexy long

**seanderlust** (8.5): this sounds cool. I go back and forth on whether the lyrics are cringey or pro-sex and therefore cool. maybe this song was cool at the time but has aged poorly? idk in the age of WAP the controversy of it just doesn't hit the same

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): kinda wish the whole song had the instrumentation of pt. 2

**bbfan132** (8): if it was just the first half of the song, it would probably be a 10 but the second half doesn‚Äôt really add anything of note so‚Ä¶

**cremeebrulee** (8): i‚Äôm such a vrgn

**frogaranaman** (8): someone just suck his dick already

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): ok but if I had sex with this song playing in the background I 100% will cackle uncontrollably because of that HUAH HUAH section on the middle

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The production here is great, not his best buts it‚Äôs a standout.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): if I give this a decent score can I never listen to it again? Because I‚Äôm only alive for so long and I don‚Äôt have time for this

**slimboyfriend** (7): Something about this song feels amateurish and the lyrics are a little clunky, but I like part 2!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): This song does NOT warrant it's 9 minute runtime, there is not anywhere near enough variety and evolution to keep me engaged

**sirpancakeXI** (6): those hooah are getting on my nerve, but this song really get better gradually. Part 2 is so much better than part 1

**wryn\_** (5): 'Sex is something everybody does, or everybody should'...i will not stand for lgbtqiA+ oppression coming from within our own community! Ace rights!!

If you had told me beforehand that this would be one of the highest rated Prince songs I probably wouldn't have believed you. But here we are. It is a very catchy song. It slowly rose into the top 10 finally settling where it is now. I think this is maybe a bit high for it since I prefer other prince songs to it.

---

**1998tweety** (10): oh wow this album is redeeming itself huh

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A classic. This is a massive standout in Prince‚Äôs discography.

**bbfan132** (10): this goes off

**ImADudeDuh** (10): throwback to that post that was asking about why sheena easton has no legacy

**plastichaxan** (10): instant 10/10 and add to my playlist yup

**skargardin** (10): an anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): banger omg

**bulforster** (9): I love the wacked-out energy of the vocal production, especially contrasted with the fairly rigid instrumental.

**igorwithlicor** (9): I do got the look, and this song has got the bops

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song is so bonkers I need to see a lip sync to it

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): boppy

**seanderlust** (8.7): love that he follows up the line "your body's hecka slammin'" with "let's get to rammin'". going straight from kidz bop to WAP huh

**vayyiqra** (8): Weird horny bop

**waluigiest** (8): it‚Äôs just really fun!

**wryn\_** (8): I really thought she was saying 'your butt is hecka slammin', feels like an r/funny user hitting on a girl at the bar

**ziggytvs** (8): kick drum go brrrrrrrr

**RandomHypnotica** (7): Why is this song so damn quiet on Spotify??

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): There‚Äôs a mild groove to this but the instrumentation is messy and the vocals are pretty painful, like, it sounds like they‚Äôre squeaking balloons at certain points.

**sirpancakeXI** (6): quite catchy but his voice kinda turn me off a bit

This song has grown on me every time I've heard it. The lyrics are very relevant even today. The instrumentals slay me every time, but the presence of Prince is what makes this song as great as it is. I expected this to be an easy top 5 but for a while it wasn't even in the top 10. The people who didn't like this thought it was boring and "feeling like nothing". And I don't get it but I guess that we're all different.

---

**astrologicalangel** (11): I have got to listen to more Prince

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): SMASH

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Only Prince could open an album with a track like this. I like that he directed the listeners attention towards the lyrics, really sets the tone for the whole record.

**bbfan132** (10): fucking amazing intro, everything is on point

**jsonphile** (10): suck it Harry styles (just kidding your song is good too)

**ziggytvs** (10): the perfect album doesn't exi-

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): some of the lyrics are lowkey too wild to take seriously but still a good song

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Harry Styles wishes

**bulforster** (9): Easily the most incisive social commentary in the rate.

**sirpancakeXI** (9): loving the instrumental

**slimboyfriend** (9): All valid points that are still relevant 24 years later

**vayyiqra** (9): "High on crack toting a machine gun" is a bold line on an opening track

**waluigiest** (9): super simple song structurally but the way that it‚Äôs still poignant today...

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): Harry Styles WISHES he could do this

**akanewasright** (8.5): I love the production here

**Roxieloxie** (8): I like this more than I do henris song

**wryn\_** (8): I love how Prince starts on his most conscious song and then the rest of this album is basically just sex songs, imagine if future nostalgia started with boys will be boys

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the lyrics are interesting but overall the song isn‚Äôt as gripping as it could be

**seanderlust** (7.3): prince really said we live in a society

**igorwithlicor** (7): That's a funky ass guitar and I love funky ass guitars but it's not enough

**1998tweety** (6): this feels like nothing

**hepmeucsb** (6): A sparse song, but I‚Äôm guessing that was purposeful and I‚Äôm too stupid to understand why

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This outsold Harry Styles but also that means literally nothing, a wet crumpet outsold that song. This is out first, right? My finger was itching for the skip button the whole time

AND PRINCE? OUT!!! This is the highest rated Prince song which I don't really understand but I'm not complaining since this song bops, the real problem here is prince going out this early, just barely preventing a tie with Charli XCX for fastest out in an album rate.

---

**bbfan132** (11): one of the best songs i‚Äôve heard honestly

**slimboyfriend** (11): There's a near zero percent chance of this song winning or being in the top ten, but this is one of my all-time favorite Prince songs because it shows his virtuosity at bridging pop and rock music with a 6+ minute song with a nearly 4 minute guitar solo. Also, I'm from Minnesota and currently live in Minneapolis, and this song sounds like I just got out of a show at First Ave on a Friday night and I'm heading up Hennepin or down to Uptown looking for somewhere to just party all night. It sounds like Minneapolis.

**jsonphile** (10): god this song is just such fun

**kappyko** (10): SMASH

**seanderlust** (10): am I tripping or does this kind of have a springsteen vibe? either way, it's one of my favorites off the record so far

**bulforster** (9): Songs about not having sex are underrated.

**hepmeucsb** (9): I love the hook and the guitars

**sirpancakeXI** (9): really enjoy the outro, didnt make me wanna skip to the next song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): The instrumental for this REALLY sounds like it belongs on a TV Show Intro

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Prince was one of the first out of many future male artists that would highlight the true nature of a player. And he nailed it.

**akanewasright** (8): Not really my kind of music but undeniably a great song

**skargardin** (8): ok so maybe the instrumentals made some points

**ziggytvs** (8): Sides 1 and 3 have to be some of the most complete and satisfying record sides in all of music

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): middle of the road

**igorwithlicor** (7): I'm not feeling it, but I'm trying and failing. I think it's the clapping. This does not slap but it does clap

**vayyiqra** (7): Maybe a little longer than it needs to be but good

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): nice guitar in the last half

**ignitethephoenix** (6.2): why is this song like 50% outro

runaway3212: 
# Sign O' the Times

---

**Overall Average**: 7.689 **// Average Controversy:** 1.640

---

**kappyko** (9.313): sorry i have too much investment in prince to be "unbiased" this shit slaps so much harder than it deserves to

**plastichaxan** (8.581): This not only transported me into another time, every song took me to a unique place, even when it wasn‚Äôt my favorite and I think that‚Äôs really special.

**slimboyfriend** (8.500): This album IS Prince. He does everything and he does it so perfectly. It's got pop, rock, funk, jazz, psychedelia, Soul, R&B, blues, etc. It's got God, sex, politics, drum solos, guitar solos, androgyny, and even Sheena Easton! My favorite thing about this album was that I really didn't like it when I first heard as a teenager 7-8 years ago, but I've slowly been able to appreciate Prince's artistry with every year that passes. When taken as an album, it's a 10/10. This is pop music at its most imaginative and creatively fulfilling. (Also, full disclosure: I'm such a big fan of Prince that when he died, my friends and family were calling me to make sure I was okay.)

**bulforster** (8.406): Definitely at least a tier or two above the other two albums. The production especially is a lot more adventurous and alive than George or Michael's.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.131): king snapped

**waluigiest** (7.938): I was surprised to hear many people consider this to be his best album?? I‚Äôm not a fan (yet) but Purple Rain seems so much more consistent with higher highs? Anyway this was a good funky album with lots of good writing but a few of these songs were major flops

**AHSWeeknd** (7.938): Prince's production is phenomenal, his impact is so evident, especially with this album.

**akanewasright** (7.719): This album is a lot to take in. I liked a lot of it, but I fully expect to see most of it go out relatively early.

**bigbigbee** (7.594): This album is so COOL! It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶effortlessly cool. My god. It‚Äôs definitely less accessible at first, but man once I ‚Äúgot it‚Äù, I loved it. I keep on find new little details I love with each new listen ‚Äì there‚Äôs so much going on here.

**hepmeucsb** (7.563): I'm not going to sit here and pretend I "understood" this album and why it's so genius, but there were definitely some songs I absolutely loved.

**frogaranaman** (7.438): I like other Prince albums better

**stickywheels46** (7.313): Not my favorite of his but its one of Prince's most important albums, for sure

**ImADudeDuh** (7.287): I really need to get into Prince's full albums at some point, since i know mostly his singles. However, 2020 was probably the perfect year to do that and I didn't do it at all this year so...

**sirpancakeXI** (7.188): it is the weakest album out of the three, kind of felt bored half way through the album

**oscarbrierley1** (6.844): I've never been able to get into this album as much as other prince albums

**ManofOranges** (6.813): I feel really, really bad having to give a lot of lower scores to the songs on this album. I mean, Prince is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and it's undeniable how good some of his music is, but I just wasn't a fan of this that much. Songs were pretty hit or miss for the most part, but nothing ever hit it out of the park for me like songs did on the other two albums.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.438): I guess I just don‚Äôt like Prince? Sorry Minnesota

**mysario** (11): when the best song in this rate is not even from an album :woeis:

**TragicKingdom1** (11): kinda feels like cheating to give my 11 to a song not on the album but these two vocal powerhouses hit SO hard together...literally flawless duet

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**bbfan132** (10): such a strong duet, both of them sound great together

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôm a simple pophead, I see a woman, I give a good score. But seriously this is great, they sound good together (I think Aretha pulled back a bit so she didn‚Äôt overwhelm him and it actually pays off) and the chorus is pretty catchy.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): TK we are NOT gonna do the Whos Zooming Who? rate.

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): two of the best vocalists in the world killing it

**seanderlust** (10): yes miss aretha!!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i didnt think their collab would work but it did

**TiltControls** (10): Amazing duet. Aretha is the queen of soul for a reason.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Two icons on a bop like this. Pure excellence.

**bigbigbee** (9): This doesn‚Äôt even come close to the song it draws inspiration from (Ain‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough) but it‚Äôs pretty good on its own! Fun and infectious.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is an unexpected collab but I‚Äôm here for it

**igorwithlicor** (9): It's very boppy but the lyrics are sad yet empowering. Isn't that the perfect pop song? Close enough!

**jsonphile** (9): holy shit a collaboration with legend of soul Aretha Franklin? Count me in

**skargardin** (9): ok this is excellent

**wryn\_** (9): Why tf is this so good lol

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the queen of soul, we have to stan

Change begins with you is a pretty common theme in music but I don't think it's ever been done better than here. There is a certain corniness to the lyrics but it's easy to ignore because of how heartfelt it is and how great the instrumentals are. And then there's that key change which is one of the best key changes ever.

---

**ManofOranges** (11): This one of my favorite MJ songs, honestly. And listening to it right now at this point in my life, it's got a bit of an extra punch to it.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The delivery here is amazing. It‚Äôs so subtle but it works with the rest of the album. Let‚Äôs be real though, the lyrics don‚Äôt fit with the album but the delivery does it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôm not a huge MJ fan in general but I really like this song! I think the message is great and it‚Äôs a good slow burn, something that a lot of Michael songs I‚Äôve heard struggle with (since they‚Äôre just constant energy).

**igorwithlicor** (10): I can't believe how well this song holds up. It's just so good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its the SMASH, those ‚ÄúHOO! HOO!‚Äùs at the end is lowkey one of the best parts of MJ‚Äôs whole discography

**jsonphile** (10): okay I know there are a lot of iconic key changes in various songs but nothing beats the key change in this song literally on the word change how iconic is that

**skargardin** (10): the key change is where i ascend

**TiltControls** (10): The slow and lonely start, the build up throughout the song, the tapering off at the end, all perfection! (If one of my favourite 80's songs weren't in this rate it'd easily get my 11)

**1998tweety** (9.5): classic

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song is mostly carried by the chorus but it‚Äôs still great

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I never really listened to the lyrics not in the chorus and yeah, some of them are cheesy, but most of them are really good? Anyway, Michael's performance really seals this one, and I think this song should've closed out the album instead of being stuck in the middle.

**wryn\_** (9): I really had to convince myself for a long time that I didn't like this song but unfortunately it gets me emotional every time

**mysario** (8.8): I'm still not sure if this needed to be 5 minutes long but MJ makes use of every second of it

**hepmeucsb** (8.5): Great, now the chorus is gonna be stuck in my head for the next three days

**vayyiqra** (8): MJ feels like he has at least one song every album that's woke and about healing the world and saving the children, and it's kind of cheesy but he's also right even if his personal life was a mess to put it mildly

**waluigiest** (8): it‚Äôs supposed to be this empowering anthem but I just think of Glee

**bbfan132** (7): i guess it‚Äôs technically good but i‚Äôm kind of sick of it lol

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I think it's because I've heard this song so many times but it sounds kind of cheesy to me now

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): the song isnt bad but i can only associate it with distracts trying to use their inner city students in ads as pathos material

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): i just got a visceral flashback to when my class had to do a dramatic performance to this song in assembly in primary school

**seanderlust** (3.9): this song excludes vampires :/

This song was 6 for the longest time but in the end edged out Man In The Mirror to end up in the top 5. It did surprise me a bit how well it did, not because I dislike the song, I love it, but more because I felt it's not as popular as some other songs on the album. I've never been happier about being wrong.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): another classic. This is just pop perfection

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Gotta love an iconic dance bop from Michael, edges out Man in the Mirror and Faith for my win

**Roxieloxie** (11): This has no chance of making it past day 2 but oh well. Honestly this is probably one of my favorite MJ songs because it reminds me of playing the Micheal Jackson The Experience game on the wii with my family ( for those of you who dont know the game it was basically Just dance but with only Micheal songs) also it's just really fun how can you hate this.

**bbfan132** (10): i couldn‚Äôt stop clapping and moving the whole time‚Ä¶. such a fun song

**jsonphile** (10): god what a great groove to this song. Best song off of this album

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): this song reminds me of an 80s version of an old Hollywood musical

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a fun bop

**TiltControls** (10): Bop!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Any 80s pop song with a shuffle beat is >>>

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**frogaranaman** (9): that fucking SYNTH

**igorwithlicor** (9): It's such a nice bop. His voice is so good

**nootnoot781** (9): michael‚Äôs ad-libs (?) send me

**plastichaxan** (9): i forgot how much i like this song

**waluigiest** (9): this is just quintessential 80s goodness

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I can‚Äôt help but feel that Janet would have crushed this song

**hepmeucsb** (8): Oh this one is nice!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is kinda worse than i remember tbh, it just doesn‚Äôt have that ~ m a g i c ~ i remember it having as a kid

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it's alright but after the opener it just doesn't seem to flow well. It's a good song song though.

**akanewasright** (6.5): The song is good but it reminds me of a choreographer I had in high school who played it to warm us up. He liked me and wrote me a good letter of recommendation for college, but he was weird about objectifying everyone and also berated people over the dumbest shit. The song‚Äôs well done but that‚Äôs a lot of baggage for one song

The iconic title track of the album, of course, did really well this rate. Its build-up towards the chorus is incredibly great and the chorus itself brings it home. It is a bit low on lyrical content, which I guess is why it's lower than two other MJ songs. Also apparently it was supposed to be a duet with prince??? The only thing funnier than that is that it was killed by the line 'your butt is mine'.

---

**brenda\_official** (11): the obvious and boring choice for an 11 in this rate but it's just a classic lol sorry

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THIS IS HOW YOU OPEN AN ALBUM. The horns on the intro right into the instruments, actual perfection. The vocals on top of all that are just monumental.

**frogaranaman** (10): this has to be the best comeback single of all time, no?

**ignitethephoenix** (10): that was a classic

**igorwithlicor** (10): This is a classic for a damn good reason! Super catchy and fun. The energy is incredible too

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my mom told me that this song was originally gonna be a duet with Prince but the song opens with ‚Äúyour butt is mine‚Äù and Prince said that sounded too gay. I have never looked up the validity of this fact.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Sorry Michael but my butt belongs to Canadian Idol alumni Ms. Carly Rae Jepsen and for her pleasure only.

**J\_Toe** (10): I'm gonna assume I'm not going to be the only one to bring up Prince for this song, right?

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): this song starts with ‚Äúyour butt is mine.‚Äù That alone makes it a 10.

**mysario** (10): why is this song called "Bad" when it's so good?! rimshot

**skargardin** (10): WOO! WOO! WOO!!!!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Ironic title since this song is Good

**NFLfreak98** (9.2): Damn you can have my butt anytime

**bbfan132** (9): this is a total bop and a good intro to the album but i feel like it‚Äôs a bit too repetitive at times in a way that hinders my enjoyment of the song

**ManofOranges** (9): Love the song but MJ does not give off the badass kind of image I'm getting from this song

**nootnoot781** (9): if someone has put has a comment like ‚Äúthis song is BAD‚Äù and given it less than a 3, shoot them

**waluigiest** (9): it‚Äôs groovy and rightfully iconic

**wryn\_** (9): I love those songs which are basically just one good musical element repeated over and over again

**akanewasright** (8.5): I hate that I associate this song with the first angry birds movie now.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I want someone to call my butt theirs :/

**jsonphile** (8): An iconic song, but the chorus feels a bit repetitive

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): luv the production on this

**Roxieloxie** (8): What piece of pop culture do you associate this song playing in the background of during a dance montage? Mine is personally Megamind

**hepmeucsb** (7): It's fun, but falls flat in comparison to his biggest hits

**seanderlust** (6.7): This song was initially supposed to be a duet between Prince and Michael Jackson. But, when Prince got the lyrics, he allegedly said about the line ["your butt is mine"]: "Who‚Äôs going to sing that to whom? Because you sure ain‚Äôt singing that to me and I sure ain‚Äôt singing that to you." LMFAAOOO

**bulforster** (6): The hook has a great lead-in but then flops lyrically, Horrible Histories' Evil Emperors outsold.

**MDMeridius** (6): it‚Äôs a bit cringey ngl

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): :title:

How people can hear MJ sing: "I said: "But unlock the door 'cause I forgot the key." She said: "He's not coming back Because he's sleeping with me." with all of his energy and give this song less than a 10 is insane to me. It did very well ending up in the top 3, but it still deserved more.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Talented, brilliant, incredible, etc. An actual masterpiece. Male artists need to learn from this song‚Äîand the album‚Äî, it‚Äôs so well crafted. The lyrics are bold but MJ‚Äôs vocals are tame leading up to such an explosive bridge/final chorus. His vocals work in favour of the production. The delivery is so perfect, this is how you commit to a song, not all artists can deliver this well with a song with massive potential.

**akanewasright** (11): Wow this is a perfect song isn‚Äôt it?

**cremeebrulee** (11): obligated as an abel stan to mention that the weeknd did a pretty great cover of this, stream DD

**igorwithlicor** (11): This is such an amazing song! The drama, the tension, the public!

**oscarbrierley1** (11): it's one of my favourite Michael Jackson songs

**bbfan132** (10): i‚Äôve always loved this, such a heavy banger - the menacing production is awesome

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is definitely one of the best songs on here. Ngl I gained a new appreciation for this song after hearing The Weeknd‚Äôs cover (which is also excellent)

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): this was Princess Diana‚Äôs favourite song lmaooo legend

**nootnoot781** (10): the father, the son and the holy spirit except it‚Äôs princess diana, diana ross and this song.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): BOP!!!!

**TiltControls** (10): Dark & brooding pop at its finest

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I love the gothic vibe that's going on here. Gives me real Hex Girls vibes

**hepmeucsb** (9): My favorite vocal and lyrical performance on the album, and the electric guitar is killer

**ImADudeDuh** (9): gets a little too wild at points but still iconic

**vayyiqra** (8): :flushed:

**1998tweety** (7.5): Dirty Dan outsold

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This song really isn't as good as I remember thinking it was

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I remember back in the 2004 rate I said that I didn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúI Wish You Knew‚Äù by Mariah Carey because it was the kind of song that would probably go off live because it‚Äôs got a lot of energy and is a good display of the artist‚Äôs abilities but isn‚Äôt compelling to listen to on a recording, and the fact that she layered in crowd sounds just underscored that, and that was probably one of the smartest things I‚Äôve said on this sub so I‚Äôm repeating it because it applies to this.

I was convinced this would win with very little competition, but like many other times in this rate I was wrong. For a while, it was fighting with Dirty Diana and Bad for the second place but in the end, it could leave both of them behind. This is a classic for a reason it's really great I love his voice here.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): God, i knew all the words to this song when i was like 10. Such a fucking HIT!!!!!!!

**NapsAndNetflix** (11): Fa11th

**static\_int\_husp** (11): a classic

**TiltControls** (11): There was a lot of 11 potential on Bad, but this had to take it. Everything sounds so effortless. One of my fave 80's songs and an easy choice for my 11

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**bbfan132** (10): such a fun opening track!!!! i never noticed the guitars in the background but they make the song better imo

**frogaranaman** (10): classic

**hepmeucsb** (10): The iconicity of it all

**igorwithlicor** (10): This is such a classic and it holds up so well. It's just a great song all around

**J\_Toe** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q3zB3E85tg

**jsonphile** (10): this song is so much better than Careless Whisper or Wake Me Up Before You Go Go and yet those songs seem to be the signature George Michael/Wham songs. But those songs are only enjoyable because of how cheesy they are, whereas Faith is just a legitimately great song.

**ManofOranges** (10): Faith-ah faith-ah faith-ah

**Roxieloxie** (10): I said i was gonna do this rate so i could give this song an 11 since harry styles samples part of this song in one of my favorite (unreleased) songs by him. bUt listening to the full thing it's actually really great.

**seanderlust** (10): well isn't this a peppy little kick in the teeth! also, i'm gonna be this person - george michael was fine back in the day! :eyes:

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the best title track out of the three

**skargardin** (10): bop for the ages

**TragicKingdom1** (10): god he's so hot in the video

**ignitethephoenix** (9.2): a classic but the production is just a little too corny for me with

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is one of two george michael songs i heard before this rate and i fear careless whisper outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A classic.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a classic but idk what else to say about it. It's catchy but just there. Still giving it a good score though.

**ziggytvs** (8): the fact that the organ is playing a Wham song sends (in the best sense)

**bulforster** (7.5): Short and sweet

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like parts of this but as a whole it‚Äôs a little bit bland musically and lyrically, it gets old fast.

And here we have our winner!!! It wasn't even close beating Faith by more than 25 points. Since this hit the number one spot it didn't leave it and just increased its lead. It does slap so it makes sense it won. (Side note: to all the people that said the glee version is better: 'no <3')

---

**1998tweety** (11): absolute classic, I lowkey prefer the Glee cover oop

**bigbigbee** (11): I hadn‚Äôt heard this song until this year, oop! But I immediately loved it. It‚Äôs so sleek. This gets my 11 because it‚Äôs the one I find myself wanting to listen to the most on a whim.

**letsallpoo** (11): slaps so hard my cheeks fell off

**mynameistoo\_common** (11): probably my favorite MJ choreography and he has a lot of iconic ones

**nootnoot781** (11): i think this will be the first time my 11 wins a rate omg. anyway it‚Äôs a fucking crime this this wasn‚Äôt one of the albums FIVE number ones when it‚Äôs easily the most iconic song from this album.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I mean this song is legendary, the first thing that comes to mind when I listen to it is the rumor that MJ worked on the soundtrack for Sonic 2 (was it ever confirmed?), cause the similarities are there. (also any Spanish speakers remember the ayuwoki meme?)

**seanderlust** (11): this is maybe my favorite MJ song

**skargardin** (11): i haven't had such a hard time choosing an 11 in a long while, but i had to settle on this in the end. such a massive banger filled with iconic lines

**vayyiqra** (11): Is Annie okay? Are any of us? Idk but this is a total banger. AAOW

**AHSWeeknd** (10): How‚Äôs Annie?? How‚Äôs Annie?? laughs in Evil. Twin Peaks reference... I‚Äôll see myself out.

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like i‚Äôm more familiar with the glee version at this point but obviously the original version is the best by far lmao

**cremeebrulee** (10): idk what else to say other than it's iconic

**igorwithlicor** (10): This is a classic for a damn good reason. It's super catchy, with a great beat, great vocals, and it's memorable

**ImADudeDuh** (10): there‚Äôs definitely a political compass meme that can be made of people who prefer the original, the alien ant farm cover, the glee cover, and don‚Äôt like any version of this song. I just don‚Äôt have the brain power to create it

**ManofOranges** (10): This probably is my favorite MJ song of all time, and it probably has my favorite video of his to boot, which is probably saying something since Thriller is the album that's usually lauded for its videos, but the dancing and the set just put this over the edge for me.

**mysario** (10): this would get my 11 but Alien Ant Farm outsold

**Roxieloxie** (10): i had a really funny comment for this but im a minute into this song and I just realized this song is in fact not Billie Jean so but i feel bad so im just gonna leave my ten

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a smash hit for a reason

**TiltControls** (10): Another perfect song!

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): minus 0.5 points because this is the rare case where the glee version is actually better

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.3): glee outsold i fear :noitstrue:

**hepmeucsb** (9): I feel like this melody has been embedded in my brain since birth

**ignitethephoenix** (9): is Annie okay? I‚Äôm not sure

**jsonphile** (9): gotta be honest the glee version also kinda slaps

**stickywheels46** (9): Did we ever find out if Annie was okay?

**waluigiest** (9): this song has some amazing covers. I‚Äôm partial to the SF jazz collective cover

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This song has always annoyed the hell out of me, but I‚Äôm giving it this many points out of respect for the Glee cover. I never liked Sebastian but him and Santana really did #that and left Michael in the dust

**Overall Average**: 7.545 **// Average Controversy:** 1.716

**hepmeucsb** (8.625): Oh man, I love this album. The fact that George, fresh out of a boyband duo, is going toe-to-toe with two of the biggest cultural juggernauts of the 80's is proof enough that this album is iconic.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.617): pleasantly surprised by this album

**stickywheels46** (8.583): One of my all-time favorite pop albums

**sirpancakeXI** (8.500): overall the best album for me, many 11 contenders

**ManofOranges** (7.750): George Michael was the artist I was least familiar with coming into this rate. I'd just heard a lot more of MJ's or Prince's songs than his, but I guess it didn't affect him negatively because my intuition tells me that his was the album in this rate that I enjoyed the most. It's got some pretty strong tracks on it, some ok ones too, but overall it's an enjoyable experience.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.750): George Michael is such a fucking icon.

**plastichaxan** (7.675): At one point songs started to blend together and sound very similar but the second half kind of kept my interest in this, which I‚Äôm glad about

**oscarbrierley1** (7.567): this was the album I was least familiar with, it's good but I don't know if I like it as much as Bad

**frogaranaman** (7.417): gay (good connotation)

**slimboyfriend** (6.750): So I listened to the entire album, and I don't exactly see why it's so highly regarded. It's pretty good, but a lot of the instrumentals sound like keyboard presets with demo vocals over them. And when you're up against Prince and Michael Jackson in a rate, that's not a good look.

**J\_Toe** (5.583): George Michael is a favourite of mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Zez37nTGg

**Overall Average**: 7.752 **// Average Controversy:** 1.596

**AHSWeeknd** (8.692): This album is one of my favourites from the 80s so it'll be hard not to give each song an 8+. And deciding which of the last three songs (of the standard edition) to give my 11 to will be difficult.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.485): I heard this album a lot when i was a child so it holds more nostalgia than the other two hence high ratings for most of the songs

**sirpancakeXI** (8.308): could have got a very high rating if it wasnt for some fillers

**frogaranaman** (8.077): following up the most successful solo album of all time, I would call anything that was good a win

**stickywheels46** (8.000): This album is better than Thriller, fite me

**bigbigbee** (7.731): This album was like half great, half only ok. But the parts that work REALLY work for me. The easiest album to pick up, IMO, especially for people who maybe aren‚Äôt as familiar with this era of music.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.538): more like good

**ManofOranges** (7.462): Not a bad album (pun intended). MJ definitely has better I think, but this album has Man in the Mirror and Smooth Criminal, so it gets some major points just for those songs in my mind.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.438): a good pop album

**slimboyfriend** (7.077): Apart from half of the singles, this album is pretty average to good. Luckily, there were a lot of singles!

**plastichaxan** (7.015): Didn‚Äôt have the strongest beginning or end but the standouts were a huge part of his career and some of the music I grew up with and there‚Äôs no denying his talent, this is good.

**hepmeucsb** (6.923): 5 number 1's, incredible. And it truly is such a catchy album, though I must say a little more sonic variety would have been appreciated

**kappyko** (6.385): Title Joke Here. it's pretty decent but i don't have emotional investment in like any of these songs compared to off the wall or thriller. or even his jackson 5 / pre-OTW / post-Bad stuff! i'm left cold by nearly all of this

**bulforster** (6.346): Nice polished production, feels like it's trying to have a theme but it isn't deep enough to tie the songs together.

TiltControls: Thanks to runaway3212 for hosting a great rate!! Sad that DK Rap / Closer double win didn't pull through but you can't win em all.

As always the [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) are updated!

**Songs**

Smooth Criminal finishes with a fantastic score and manages to land on the top 20 leaderboard at #13!!! A well deserved win!! (even if I was cheering for faith to pull through). MJ also joins the group of Whitney, Mariah, Kate, and Kylie as artists who hold 2 spots on the top 20 leaderboard! 

**Artists**

Well I wasn't expecting this to happen coming into the rate... but both Michael and Prince have not only fallen off the top 10, but the entire top 20 artist rankings! 

Michael dropped from #4 down to #24. Guess even the singles couldn't save the filler that got cut the first two days. Prince ended up going from #8 to #29. On the plus side: at least Prince didn't take True Romances' spot from earliest rate exit. 

As for George, he now has enough songs to appear on the board and ends up at 75/239

Unrelated to scores, but this is also somehow the first time we've rated Aretha?!? popheads explain!
