Okay I'm really happy that this song (barely but still) made it to day 2, because for a while this was 39 which I found incredibly unfair to this song. It has good lyrics and it sounds great.

---

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Gorgeous instrumental, great storytelling, I love it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): amazing song

**sirpancakeXI** (10): bop

**bbfan132** (9.5): was not expecting this, smooth and dreamy soul/pop songs are my kryptonite

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): love the guitar on this one and the breathy vocals are doing it for me

**mynameistoo\_common** (9): George Michael’s voice is so ethereal

**plastichaxan** (9): added to certain playlist

**seanderlust** (9): discourse about how problematic behavior is undertaken by the lower class because they have no other options under our capitalist system? in MY george michael album?

**stickywheels46** (9): Very underrated song

**waluigiest** (9): okay I love the vocal melody and it made some points

**igorwithlicor** (8): Smooth af, kinda love it but not enough

**ManofOranges** (8): Mitski in the Your Best American Girl video

**1998tweety** (7.5): sex bop

**hepmeucsb** (7): A nice vocal performance, but I don’t love the instrumental

**ImADudeDuh** (6): something about a british man saying “i believe in america” sends me

**AHSWeeknd** (4): A nice song, not much going on.

Uniting the world is an important theme in a lot of Micheal earlier and later work. I love how catchy it is and the lyrics are mostly great. However, I have to agree with other commenters that it can't compare to other singles and that 'You're just another part of me' isn't as unifying a hook as 'We are the world'. Still great.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This production with MJ’s vocals. I AM DECEASED, it’s too good. The pre-chorus is killer.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the chorus is so good especially when he sing the title

**igorwithlicor** (9): Once again, that funky ass guitar doing the work

**skargardin** (9): such a BOP

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): groovy

**1998tweety** (8): big bop

**seanderlust** (7.8): it's jeshtya nehyutha pfahrtameh.

**bbfan132** (7.5): i’m enjoying the production quite a bit but the song itself wasn’t too engaging/interesting imo

**bulforster** (7.5): This is weirdly ominous for a song about global unity.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): your just a another pwarrrttt of me...I’m sorry that does not work at all

**hepmeucsb** (6.5): The guitar/synth hook is catchy

**akanewasright** (6): I’m kind of living for Michael’s accent on the word “part”

**letsallpoo** (6): why does the intro sound like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAhvQoLpvsM

**slimboyfriend** (6): It's fine, but it can't compare to the obvious singles on this album

**wryn\_** (6): It's cool and all but why tf did they release this as a single before smooth criminal?

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This isn’t good? Like it sounds all over the place and I can’t understand a word he’s saying

**ImADudeDuh** (3): huh

I do not like this. It makes me wildly uncomfortable and the song isn't that great even ignoring the lyrics. That said I can't give it lower than a 4 for how fluid it is with gender identity which I can always appreciate. This is the most controversial song in this rate, which makes sense.

---

**MDMeridius** (11): could potentially be my favourite Prince song

**wryn\_** (11): Gender norms...destroyed. And then kinda reinforced? And then destroyed again. But anyway this is probably my favourite funk song ever

**ziggytvs** (11): changed my entire life tbh. psychosexual prince just gets me

**1998tweety** (10): TRANS ANTHEM WE STAN

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This fluidity is what made Prince memorable. If a certain artist in our time made songs like these he’d be able to actually make statements rather than just wearing dresses.

**bbfan132** (10): this is perfect, all i have to say

**bulforster** (10): This song is a journey.

**plastichaxan** (10): the way this progressively got better and better, that’s how long songs should be

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song is kinda batshit but im kinda into it

**skargardin** (10): we're ascending on this day

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I think this is creative and so cool. I love the random spoken bits. All of the little moments mentioned in this song highlight the wonderful trust and vulnerability that comes with truly being in love. I think that the line “I want to be all of the things you are to me” is so succinct and sweet.

**cremeebrulee** (9): omg this got so horny SO fast

**hepmeucsb** (9): The way Prince played with gender is epitomized by this track

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): he did that for the pining wlw

**slimboyfriend** (9): Yes ok Prince was straight and kind of homophobic later in life when got religious, but this song is pretty queer, and his sexual freedom and androgyny, especially as a black man, really did a lot for the culture.

**waluigiest** (9): THE BRIDGE

**mysario** (8.1): if I was your girlfriend, I’d never let you go, I could take you places you ain’t never been before, baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know, I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow, swag swag swag, on you, chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue, I dunno about me, but I know about you, so say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's smooth and has a great vibe

**TragicKingdom1** (8): nsync ft nelly outsold

**vayyiqra** (8): Prince genderbending king

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): wow the one song I heard from this album before! Also now listening to this again, the vocals and lyrics sound like something 100 Gecs would do and I cannot unhear that.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): i can’t tell if this is experimental, sweet, creepy, misogynistic, or all of the above.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): this whole time I just wanted to be listening to “If You Were A Woman and I Were A Man” and “If I Were Your Woman” but this isn’t bad

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): I totally thought my PS3 was turning on when this song started…

**seanderlust** (6.3): so i've seen people talking about dudes "simping" and i'm not entirely sure what it means but I think this is it. he is one step away from asking to drink her bath water i swear to god

**NFLfreak98** (6): This is a lot to handle. I just wish the music matched the insanity of the lyrics

**sirpancakeXI** (5): that outro is the best part of it but the chorus fall flat

**oscarbrierley1** (4): it starts really good but the ending makes me uncomfortable

**TiltControls** (0): Some of those lyrics are... not great

SHUT UP ALREADY DAMN is an incredible intro to an incredible song. I get the people saying that they found it annoying, but for me, Prince's incredible energy makes it a lot better.

---

**bbfan132** (10): so fun!! love the rapping here, it’s quirky in the best way possible

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song make me wanna dance

**bulforster** (9): All the shunting in the production goes off.

**ManofOranges** (9): Really weird but I can dig it.

**ziggytvs** (9): (Aftershock!) ain't that a b*tch?

**AHSWeeknd** (8): An honest bop.

**akanewasright** (8): I’m kind of mixed on the vocal pitching throughout the album (I weirdly think that George Michael pulls it off a lot better), but this song is a bop and a half.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): “shut up already damn” me when Prince puts a nine minute song on his album… this song can stay though, I love me a corny ‘80s kid friendly rap moment. It’s like yes, teach me how to serve drinks at Wendy’s.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Funk so strong I can smell it

**stickywheels46** (8): Prince's vocal personality absolutely carries this track

**vayyiqra** (8): Question for the culture: Does anybody know about the quake?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): love the funk on here

**mysario** (7.5): this is the moment where I realized I merely like Prince

**seanderlust** (7.5): shut up! already. DAMN.

**hepmeucsb** (7): His vocals were fun on this one

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): HOUSEQUAKE!

**igorwithlicor** (6): I should be feeling it, but I'm not

**plastichaxan** (6): maybe it was wrong of me to get my expectations too high with a name like this

**steelstepladder** (4): Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your housequake

**wryn\_** (4): His pitched up voice works so well on If I Was Your Girlfriend and is like the most annoying thing I've ever heard here

**waluigiest** (3): um

**oscarbrierley1** (0): I don't like when he pitches up his voice in general and I find this song really annoying

For once I agree with the balladphobia of popheads. This song isn't very interesting and fo a while it was a lot lower than it is now. Its saving grace is how good he sounds, but that's about it.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Definitely the best song on the album! Feels like an early Kylie Minogue cut (which makes sense since this was around the same time) or a song from a Cy Coleman musical (also around the same time, hey), it’s got that same sense of shameless cheesiness that’s a little bit touching/sexy at the same time. Like I tuned in to every word of this song, which is something not a lot of the songs on this album (or this rate in general) got me to do.

**bigbigbee** (10): Man…I know this is like, Ballad 101, but I love it. It’s so soft and pretty. It sort of reminds me of what I thought marriage would be like when I was a little kid?

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song make me feel sad :(

**stickywheels46** (10): Gorgeous track

**AHSWeeknd** (9): An excellent ballad. Also, it sounds a lot like a Christmas song.

**bbfan132** (9): really enjoyable outro (on the standard version)! i should listen to more of george’s jazzy songs, it’s a good fit for him

**bulforster** (9): It's a bit disappointing that this has aged a lot better for me than fair amount of the more contemporary production in the rate but I can't hold that against this song.

**igorwithlicor** (9): I do love a good angsty ballad, but also smooth

**hepmeucsb** (8.5): Beautiful vocals paired with some smooth instrumentation

**astrologicalangel** (8): much less monotonous ballad

**ImADudeDuh** (8): yaaassss this bridge

**RandomHypnotica** (8): A jazzy ballad? Say no more

**skargardin** (8): this is really pretty

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I'm a sucker for soft jazz piano and bass.

**1998tweety** (7): snooze

**letsallpoo** (6): is this michael buble

**steelstepladder** (6): This isn't terrible but I just listened to One More Try and this isn't nearly as good

**wryn\_** (6): Not the best adult contemporary song on this rate but it ends well

**seanderlust** (5.6): I am on hold with CVS

**DaHumanTorch** (4): filler on a 10 track album? ok then

The biggest tonal difference between two songs on an album until All Too Well into 22. It is really fun and once again carried by Prince's energy. Could be a bit better lyrically in my opinion, but still great.

---

**NFLfreak98** (11): A banger that makes you feel great and contains a 2 minute long bullshit breakdown/guitar solo section? Where else could my 11 go?

**bbfan132** (10): sounds like a song that would play in the background of a water park commercial and i love that for it

**seanderlust** (9.5): prince to all of his backing band about the instrumental breakdown: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/501/948/6e9.png

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Sign O' The Times (the song) was like being crushed by existential dread on a lonely Friday night, and this song is like waking up on a sunny Saturday morning thinking that life life is fine for now, and maybe that's good enough.

**bulforster** (8): Cute!

**hepmeucsb** (8): The funky Prince I know and love

**ImADudeDuh** (8): glad Prince followed up his song about the challenger explosion, a woman killing her baby because she can’t afford to raise it, and the theory that someone will never be happy until the moment they die, with a song called “Play in The Sunshine”

**ziggytvs** (8): "the color green will make your best friend leave ya, it'll make him do the walk (AND THAT'S COOL)" is elite shade

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): yas this outro

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Prince really said “no” to depression.

**akanewasright** (7): Not my thing, but this is a good song

**igorwithlicor** (7): I wanted to like it so much, but I wasn't feeling it

**vayyiqra** (7): same

**plastichaxan** (6.5): too long

**astrologicalangel** (6): sudden tonal shift

**waluigiest** (5): why does this belong on the Rocky Horror soundtrack?

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I kinda liked this for a second but then the lyrics kicked in and oh my god I HATE this kind of Michael Frante-esque “good vibes love they neighbor” music, it’s all utter trash. I gave it points for some of the weirder moments though

This is really cool storytelling weaved into a song with a catchy chorus. It talking about autism or at least something autism-like feels pretty revolutionary already at the time, but even still today. It is fun and catchy and I'm happy that it wasn't done dirty like some other songs of Prince.

---

**akanewasright** (10): Bop

**bbfan132** (10): loved this, love the story behind this song too

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait this is a major bop but what it’s about is absolutely wild for the 80s???

**izeasklapaucius** (10): love the message!

**Roxieloxie** (10): this absolute banger of a song, im living

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Oh wait this is actually really cute! The arrangement is great, the lyrical imagery is fun, and it’s the perfect length. I much prefer this Prince to the weird guitar shredding one.

**igorwithlicor** (9): I can't explain why this slaps but it does and I love it

**sirpancakeXI** (9): a pretty chill song

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): "So that last song was about me being horny 24/7... anyway, here's my Sesame Street song about a little girl and the magical wonder of childhood :))))"

**seanderlust** (8.1): ?????? what is this a commercial for

**kappyko** (8): this is so cute

**wryn\_** (8): Most important neurodivergent anthem until cupcakke dropped A.U.T.I.S.M

**astrologicalangel** (7): I don't understand anything but I am enjoying nonetheless

**ManofOranges** (7): I honestly have no idea what's going on this song, but I don't hate it.

**ziggytvs** (7): perhaps his best testament to Susannah Melvoin?

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Only Prince could fit a wholesome song in between two songs about sex. Though I feel like there’s a darker truth here that I just can’t grasp.

**vayyiqra** (6): Cynthia was a weird girl

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I don't like the reverse beat, it sounds more off than it should be to me

**hepmeucsb** (4): What the f*ck is that “woosh” stereo noise that’s part of the instrumental? It’s so distracting and noticeable with headphones.

**waluigiest** (4): hmm

Lady Gaga's Paparazzi and Taylor's Look What You Made Me Do both feel inspired by this whether they were aware of it or not. I don't love the sound of this song, but the lyrics are great. This did way better than I expected. Tying for the 19 spot.

---

**izeasklapaucius** (11): This has always been my fave since I've known his work. The sentiment is still relevant even to this day. Underrated classic!

**stickywheels46** (11): This song is MJ at his most cathartic. A brilliant and funky “fuck you” to the tabloid press

**AHSWeeknd** (10): My depression anthem. A phenomenal closer which honestly reflected MJ’s life.

**frogaranaman** (10): this music video is so fun

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck the paparazzi (but not gaga’s song)

**sirpancakeXI** (10): such a catchy song

**igorwithlicor** (9): Never did leave him alone. But the song slaps

**mynameistoo\_common** (9): my introverted ass relates hard to this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): relatable bop

**Roxieloxie** (8): Why dose the start of this sounds so much like Higher Ground by Stevie Wonder

**wryn\_** (8): I love that MJ's cultural impact is so huge that like three times this album I've been like oh THIS song...

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**bbfan132** (7.5): smooth criminal was a better closing track

**seanderlust** (7.1): it's fine

**slimboyfriend** (7): Why was this one of the two songs not released as a single? It's in the better half of the album.

**vayyiqra** (7): bop

**bulforster** (5.5): This isn't unpleasant but I realised partway through I was just waiting for it to end.

**hepmeucsb** (5.5): Somewhat derivative of the songs that come before it

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This is one of those songs where the lyrics take on a much darker tone when you know the context of Michael’s life and it makes me a bit uncomfortable… like this was a genuine plea guys, it doesn’t feel like we should be listening to this. Musically though it’s just “The Way You Make Me Feel” but like, worse?

**kappyko** (0): this just does nothing for me

Not to be an annoying christian here, but a part of me is really glad that Prince delivers on an actual good christian song. It bops and I had hoped that I would do better, since it would be what it deserved.

---

**bbfan132** (10): from the slow intro to loud as hell ending with the sitar, it was a spiritual experience

**igorwithlicor** (10): What can I say? It works for me

**kappyko** (10): SMASH

**sirpancakeXI** (10): really love the guitar sound in the song

**skargardin** (10): THE DRUMS SLAP OMG

**waluigiest** (10): gorgeous, love the way it grows

**hepmeucsb** (9.5): Oh his vocals and the gradual increase in the intensity of the song

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Going straight back to the opener, basically returning to the first concern he presented the listener with. Excellence.

**jsonphile** (9): a Christian rock song that’s actually good? Prince can really do no wrong

**seanderlust** (8.4): i'm not usually a fan of ~know jesus before you die~ music but this does slap

**bulforster** (8): Nice tension but without the payoff I wanted.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wasn’t feeling it but it picked up and im rockin out whew

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): christian king

**slimboyfriend** (8): huh maybe god is real

**ziggytvs** (8): used to be obsessed with this. the sitar line and guitar tone grip

**1998tweety** (7): picks up at the end

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I can’t believe Prince invented 90’s rock

**astrologicalangel** (6): takes a while to pick up, but boy does it pick up

**vayyiqra** (6): Not bad but doesn't fit the album imo

**wryn\_** (6): Girl defined anthem

This is really where this album starts to get good, which shows by that all the other final four being in the top 20. I love the lyrics of this song and the sound is not bad at all.

---

**bbfan132** (10): the second half is excellent so far!!! loved this track

**bulforster** (10): I love how FAT this beat is.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is what I love about prince. It's fun, got some GREAT bass, and Prince has the confidence and charisma to pull off the strange vocals

**slimboyfriend** (9): To see how this could be a 10, listen to the newly released version on the 4th disc of the Sign O' The Times Super Deluxe album

**1998tweety** (8.5): ok this slaps oh wow

**AHSWeeknd** (8): detailing the tribulations of a toxic relationship and making that into a bop. It’s such an iconic song.

**akanewasright** (8): Bop

**skargardin** (8): banger

**vayyiqra** (8): Weird bop

**igorwithlicor** (7): It's weirdly Xmas-y and I don't know how I feel about that

**waluigiest** (7): I get a strong Paula Abdul vibe from this

**ziggytvs** (7): docked a point for not being the Revolution version

This song has ballad in the title so I expected it to go out day 3, but it actually pulled trough leaving at the end of day 2. It is really great and I'm happy popheads saw that too.

**plastichaxan** (11): transcendental

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**bbfan132** (10): i hear a joni mitchell reference/interpolation, i give the song a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9H7wwfrpgI

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): fun fact the hazy sound this has (what makes the song so good) was actually an accident but prince decided to keep it anyway

**waluigiest** (10): HOLY the writing and narrative work here is stunning. The metaphors and wordplay... this is literature.

**ziggytvs** (10): one of his best deep cuts

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): why is Prince describing this incredibly mundane encounter one of the best songs on the album?

**slimboyfriend** (9): I used to skip this song when I was younger, but now I'm obsessed with the psychedelic groove and the weird muted percussion that keeps this song vibing

**vayyiqra** (9): Dorothy was pretty based

**bulforster** (8.5): I like how slinky this song about not having sex is.

**seanderlust** (8.2): dorothy needs to let the man enjoy his fruit cocktail in peace.

**igorwithlicor** (8): This is smooth af

**kappyko** (8): this is so smooth

**hepmeucsb** (7.5): The last couple minutes really shine

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I prefer the version with horns in the 20th anniversary album but I still like it

**AHSWeeknd** (6): omg I know her.

I'm a sucker for these types of slow sexy love ballads, with prince honestly sounds hot here, I always was kind of sceptical of him being a real ladies man, but this showed to me he definitely was.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like the jazz influences here I was going to complain how this was boring but this is nice

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is a fucking jam but it goes on like a minute too long imo

**jsonphile** (8): ooooh gotta put this song on next time I’m getting it on with someone. Hahaha just kidding I’m lonely

**mynameistoo\_common** (8): a Disney song in the guise of a Prince track

**1998tweety** (7.5): his slower songs serve huh

**bigbigbee** (7.5): A bit more standard than is typical for this album, but it works for me. Such lush instrumentation.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I know this song is good and I'm giving it a relatively high score, but it's just not my kind of jam.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This is how you nail a steamy ballad.

**kappyko** (7): okay this one's cute but a lil boring

**vayyiqra** (7): I believe this is what is called a "sex jam"

**ziggytvs** (7): maybe it's impossible for me to be objective here

When George told all of us to call him daddy. Though with the current context a lot of people seemed to think it was sexual, I personally found the lyrics to be more comforting. The instrumentals are great too.

---

**bbfan132** (10): ugh this production is so pretty…

**hepmeucsb** (10): Before “Daddy AF,” we had “Father Figure”

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is a mother fuckING bop!!!!!!!!!!!!! That organ is iconic

**ManofOranges** (10): Now wait a minute this is a hit.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song sound so sensual

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the song is great but I absolutely love the little chords at the beginning/end of the song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): go off

**jsonphile** (8.5): yes George Michael you can be my daddy

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I actually like this one but omg it has no business being this long

**igorwithlicor** (8): The lyrics are... something, but in the context of Michael's life they do make sense

**waluigiest** (8): why this sound like Enigma by Lady Gaga

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**izeasklapaucius** (7): Lyrics got me adjusting my collar (I wore t-shirt at the time I wrote this so it's non-existential) but the choir fuckin bangs.

**slimboyfriend** (7): The part about the tiny hand creeps me out a litte, but the rest of the song is good!

**wryn\_** (7): At this point I really thought every song on this album would have a super dramatic opener

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I first heard this when it was covered by a contestant on American Idol S5 (just looked it up…I guess his name was Ace Young.) And even though I was a little kid then, I still thought “man this song is smarmy and weird”. There’s no arguing that the melody is great, though; I can appreciate that more now.

**vayyiqra** (5): Not even going to try to comment on the lyrics to this so just read this thinkpiece I found: https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8014042/george-michael-father-figure-faith-anniversary

**AHSWeeknd** (0): I’m sorry but this song is so creepy. I get the intent is harmless but c’mon, with lyrics like “But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime.” And “Greet me with the eyes of a child.” It’s so creepy. ALSO, who’d put a choir on such a personal song? The only good thing about this is George Michael’s voice, but even the can't save this mess.

**astrologicalangel** (0): nope
