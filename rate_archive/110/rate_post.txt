**THIS RATE IS DUE JANUARY 17th**

# Intro

Hello all you beautiful people, welcome to the **Main Pop Boys of 1987 Rate**! This month we'll again rate three iconic albums from the '80s, but this time it's the men's turn! These three albums are **Michael Jackson - Bad**, **Prince - Sign O' the Times** and **George Michael - Faith**. I am hosting this rate. All three albums were hugely influential and popular at the time of their release. And their reach has perfectly stood the test of time, if not grown bigger in the last years.

If you want to dive head-first into the rate, the score submission page is below. If this is your first time doing a rate though, please read the information below carefully.

# Michael Jackson - Bad

On MJ's follow up to his greatly successful (both critically and commercially) album Thriller, he makes an amazing album in its own right. While the success of Thriller may have been hard (some might say impossible) to match, the album was still a huge commercial hit as the first album to get five Billboard number 1's and at the time the second-highest selling album (behind Thriller). The album sees MJ experiment with digital synths and drum machines. At the time it received general praise from critics, some calling it MJ's best work yet. It to this day receives tons of praise with Rolling Stone placing it at 194th on the greatest albums of all time. It's also credited with creating the sound of late 80's pop. We'll also be rating two extra tracks from the 2001 special edition.

Tracklist:

1. Bad
2. The Way You Make Me Feel
3. Speed Demon
4. Liberian Girl
5. Just Good Friend
6. Another Part Of Me
7. Man In The Mirror
8. I Just Can’t Stop Lovin’ You
9. Dirty Diana
10. Smooth Criminal
11. Leave Me Alone
12. Streetwalker
13. Fly Away

# Prince - Sign O' the Times

Often considered one of Prince's best albums and one of the best albums of all time Sign O' the Times is a stunning effort where everything comes together in a wonderful album. The album really encompasses all styles and genres. It is Prince's first album after the disbanding of the revolution. At the time it received pretty much unanimous praise with some critics calling it 'genius'. Retrospective reviews are somehow even more positive, with almost every major music news source giving it their perfect score and Rolling Stone ranking it 45th on their 500 best albums list.

Tracklist:

1. Sign O’ The Times
2. Play In The Sunshine
3. Housequake
4. The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker
5. It
6. Starfish And Coffee
7. Slow Love
8. Hot Thing
9. Forever In My Life
10. U Got The Look
11. If I Was Your Girlfriend
12. Strange Relationship
13. I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man
14. The Cross
15. It’s Gonna Be A Beautiful Night
16. Adore

# George Michael - Faith

George Michael's first solo album after Wham!'s split sees him exploring a Pop-R&B sound as well as personal introspective lyrics. The album became a huge commercial success, spawning four Billboard 1's and selling more than 25 million album units. It also received great critic reviews with one critic calling George Michael the Elton John of the '80s.  Retrospectively it is still seen as an amazing album with Rolling Stone placing it at 145 on their top 500 greatest albums of all time. In addition to the album tracks, we'll also be rating two of his hits from the same era.

Tracklist:

1. Faith
2. Father Figure
3. I Want Your Sex  \[Parts 1 & 2\]
4. One More Try
5. Hard Day
6. Hand To Mouth
7. Look At Your Hands
8. Monkey
9. Kissing A Fool
10. A Last Request (I Want Your Sex)
11. A Different Corner
12. I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)

# Rules

These are definitely not copy / pasted from the ~~mens~~ Pollen rate and are clearly originally written with this rate in mind:

* Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). Please. I beg of you. You can give one decimal behind the point, i.e. 5.3 is okay 8.75 is not. Please remember to use a point instead of a comma.
* You have to rate every single song in the main rate. If you skip any and do not give us a score when we ask you for one, your ballot will not be counted. This is because the program used to determine the results will break if scores are not successfully put in and I will cry if the program breaks because it will be a pain in the ass to do this manually.
* You may give **one song a zero (0)** and **one song an eleven (11)**. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. **If you do use either your zero (0) or your eleven (11), you are required to leave a comment on the track.** It can be as short or as long as you want, but please leave one; it will help the sub understand if you should be cancelled or not when the rate is being revealed.
* Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! That is the only form of ballot I will accept. I spent a lot of time and effort on it, so do not be afraid to use it.
* Note: if you’re trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; I have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, so you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!
* If you desire to change any of the scores after you have already submitted them, simply message me and I will be glad to help! My life is boring anyways.
* If we believe your scores include any form of sabotage, we reserve the right to ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. Sabotage will be defined as extremely low album average(s) that show a clear bias against one (or more) artist(s) in the rate. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, we strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)
* Your scores should not be considered confidential! Don’t be scared to share them. Go nuts. Campaign for whatever song you gave an eleven to. Or not. It really is not that deep.

# Commenting Guidelines

You are highly encouraged to leave comments with your scores! These have to be in the following format:

>Man In The Mirror: 7 I hate the man I see when I look in the mirror, but this song is pretty good

Any other format is wrong and you will have no choice but to rewrite your comment to the correct format. If you fail to do this your ballad sadly cannot be counted. So please **Don't** post your comments like this:

>The Cross: I think that jesus was pretty cool so im gonna give this a 9  
>  
>Bad: (4.3) This song is bad!!!  
>  
>Faith: 5: Faith has five letters.  
>  
>Dirty Diana: 9.5 - I loved Diana in The Crown

You are also free to write a comment with any albums, you should add a colon after the album with your commentary. **Don't add a score, just commentary.** Something like this:

>Album: Faith: I loved when this album went into unexpected directions
