Closing out this rate. It has the disadvantage of being relatively unknown, a ballad and boring, this was an unsurprising last place. It doesn't go anywhere and just sort of fades out. It's understandable why it got cut as it doesn't do anything or the album, not even the lyrics can save it because the lyrics are also pretty bland.

---

**ManofOranges** (10): Very relaxing to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really like this one as a closer, those weird spacey whistles in the background give it a lot of personality

**igorwithlicor** (8): I think it's a great closer for the album. It has a certain ethereal vibe

**bbfan132** (7.5): this was pretty but it also felt like it was meant to be a bonus track

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): That weird alien whistle with these lyrics, it's mesmerizing.

**akanewasright** (7): This is cute

**slimboyfriend** (7): The beginning was iffy, but I really like the chorus and the groove.

**bulforster** (6.5): This would be a cute interlude, but I don't know that there's enough here for a full song.

**mynameistoo\_common** (6): kinda boring

**seanderlust** (5.4): it's fine, but allison krauss and gillian welch outsold

**hepmeucsb** (5): Not a super interesting song if I'm being honest...

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): okay

**skargardin** (5): kinda whatever

**sirpancakeXI** (3): it sound so boring to me

**wryn\_** (3): Popheads mods why did you make me listen to this

This is a nice ballad but that's about as much as I will compliment it. It is very bland and there is better on the album. That said I do think his voice sounds very beautiful on this track specifically

---

**igorwithlicor** (10): So beautiful and relaxing. Ethereal, like the stream in a creek

**plastichaxan** (10): better than everything in the album (or if this was in the album and not the remastered then this is the best song)

**waluigiest** (10): honestly this has Enya vibes and I’m enjoying it a lot

**cremeebrulee** (9): aw this is sweet i love this

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The production is great.

**ziggytvs** (8): ethereal pop boy

**seanderlust** (7.8): oooooooh emotions!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is a bit sparse and the melody is aimless but I think that kinda makes sense for the lyrics, which I do enjoy. It’s a somehow whole greater than the sum of its parts.

**bbfan132** (7): the production is beautiful but george didn’t add anything special to it imo

**1998tweety** (6.5): sleep

**akanewasright** (6): This was nice, but not super memorable or anything

**kappyko** (6): the tkayola in getting a song thats not even on the album in this rate!!! ITS ON A WHAM ALBUM!!!!!!

**mynameistoo\_common** (6): too sappy tbh

**oscarbrierley1** (6): kind of boring but ok

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): This kinda just didn't hit for me…. maybe I need to have had my heart broken first

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): a bit of a snoozy ballad

**ImADudeDuh** (5): its ok

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this was such a background song, nothing good or interesting about it

I don't disagree with the comments calling boring, marriage is just a difficult subject to write about without it becoming very corny and dull. Beyonce did it, but that's about. This song was last for a while, it's a bit higher now, which I think is a good place for it.

---

**igorwithlicor** (9): It has a great beat and it's very smooth

**ziggytvs** (9): genius. that drumbeat is part of my DNA.

**bbfan132** (8.5): enjoyed it quite a bit but it needed a climax imo

**bulforster** (7.5): The intertwining vocal lines on a song about partnership are a cute touch.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I like it, but the backing vocals make it sound like an unfinished demo

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): it’s fine… for this album

**vayyiqra** (6): I wanna settle down :pensive:

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): just too boring and simplistic for me

**hepmeucsb** (5): Didn’t really get this one, but it wasn’t bad

**seanderlust** (4.3): why you would put a boring Jesus-adjacent song in between "hot thing" and "u got the look", both superior jams, is beyond me.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Could’ve been lyrically better.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): This song kinda just…. Did nothing for it's entire runtime. It feels more like spoken poetry than music

**stickywheels46** (4): I'm sorry I think this track is boring, please don't kill me

**ImADudeDuh** (1): oof this was boring

This song is a ballad which is why it did badly in this rate. Personally, I think on one hand it's really pretty with the instrumentals, but the lyrics are a bit clunky. The song also doesn't go anywhere and sort of ends. It deserved more, but not a lot more.

---

**Roxieloxie** (10): I cant listen to this without thinking of the Jay Vercace vine. But once I get past that, the song is also a banger

**sirpancakeXI** (10): that intro really made the song better than it already was

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I don’t know what she’s saying but girl I am living! This song is one of the many reasons Bad is one of MJ’s best albums.

**akanewasright** (9): I saw the title and assumed it would be weird and objectifying, but like... it only kind of is? I adore every other aspect of it: the melody, production, and Michael’s performance are all top tier

**igorwithlicor** (9): I do love a smooth love song, with some angst and longing

**ManofOranges** (9): The way I misread the title as Libertarian Girl

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This song was a REAL grower. I enjoyed it at first, but on follow up listens, I really grew to love the instrumental more, the little details are beautiful and deep, it's just a really pretty song

**seanderlust** (9): i just know there's a dorky dad out there married to a librarian who sang to his wife "librarian girl" and anyways I hope they're doing well

**bbfan132** (8.5): kind of a tropical ballad, i enjoyed it quite a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This really does feel like something that would play during a love scene in an old school film… it’s a little too long though

**vayyiqra** (8): This is more underwhelming than I remember but still good :flag_lr:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why Liberian?? I have so many questions

**frogaranaman** (7): I thought this was “Librarian Girl” for a second

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejE2wWvjTx8

**izeasklapaucius** (7): I implore you guys to watch the video for this song. Eighties cheesiness captured and encapsulated in four minute, what's not to like?

**waluigiest** (7): it’s dark and sultry but the lyrics aren’t giving me much

**1998tweety** (6.5): sexual bop

**hepmeucsb** (6): It's nice, but nothing compared to Prince's or George Michael's slower songs

**kappyko** (6): this is cute

**mynameistoo\_common** (6): cheesy tbh

**slimboyfriend** (5): Every album has its filler

**wryn\_** (5): Maybe I would like this if it wasn't my right wing friend's favourite song, its too tarnished for me to enjoy now

**letsallpoo** (4): this is uncomfortable

**bulforster** (2): This is so smarmy.

**astrologicalangel** (1): this feels wrong

**mysario** (0): can't spell BALLAD without BAD !!!

I was shocked that nobody seemed to like this as much as I personally did. It is really great in my opinion but overall people found it boring and having not really having aged well which I can kinda see. I think it works though and I wish it had done better.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kinda a weird closer for the album considering how slow and low-key it is but I guess it does kinda bring the whole album full circle thematically? I’m vibing with it though, the late night saxophone slow burn vibes work well for what he’s trying to do here and it doesn’t overstay its welcome.

**akanewasright** (8.5): Yeah this is nice

**bbfan132** (8): very relaxing outro even though it isn’t substantive

**igorwithlicor** (8): A little too much cowbell to be sexy tbh, but it still works a bit

**Roxieloxie** (8): this one is horny and sad, and you know what, thats a quarantine mood

**stickywheels46** (8): Too damn smooth

**waluigiest** (8): okay trumpet

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Serving liminal-space music.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a nice note to end the album on but something feels off.

**jsonphile** (7): okay George Michael we get it you want my sex

**skargardin** (7): works as an outro i guess idk why i expected more

**vayyiqra** (7): George Michael said "I am once again asking for your sex"

**hepmeucsb** (6.5): Didn’t go much for me, but the sax (?) was nice

**1998tweety** (6): enough about sex

**RandomHypnotica** (5): This is just… really boring

**bulforster** (2.5): Way over the line, where tf did this come from??

**seanderlust** (0): uuuuhhhhhhhh........am i misinterpreting this or did this really NOT age well :grimacing:

Sweeter than syrup, I've seen this song being described as a Disney song and just really generic which is probably why it didn't do great. I think people were ignoring all the best parts when they were rating this song because it's very much great. The hook is insanely catchy and the overt sweetness may turn some people off of the song I personally really love it, it makes it feel genuine.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a great ballad

**plastichaxan** (10): the sweetest song ever made probably

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I know popheads hates ballads or whatever (do we hate ballads or do most artists use ballads as an excuse to release boring songs?) but this is really pretty.

**seanderlust** (8.1): bring siedah Garrett's singing on the choruses more forward challenge

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This duet is so well-made, they chose the right track to follow Man In The Mirror.

**igorwithlicor** (7): This is the most Disney song I've ever. I can already picture the scene in 2D animation

**TiltControls** (7): Phil Collins is unbothered

**vayyiqra** (7): 80s ballads >>>

**1998tweety** (6): a ballad? i hit snooze

**bbfan132** (6): brb going to sleep now, such a boring ballad even though it isn’t bad

**bigbigbee** (6): Points for the Nintendo 64 water level synths, but I find this pretty snoozy.

**hepmeucsb** (6): I'm not saying it's the best but it ain't the worst

**slimboyfriend** (5): This sounds like Home from The Wiz if you were supposed to fall asleep instead of crying to it.

**stickywheels46** (5): The generic love ballad that was somehow the lead single

**steelstepladder** (0): The Spotify version edited out the creepy intro but that doesn't mean I don't know it exists. The song itself sucks too.

To quote Marina: "Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex"

---

**skargardin** (10): we love not being subtle

**waluigiest** (9): sex is illegal

**bbfan132** (8.5): production was excellent as usual but the song itself left a bit to be desired

**plastichaxan** (8.5): his vocal delivery on this so good

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): It's like a sex jam but with Street Fighter noises. U gotta love it

**AHSWeeknd** (8): These vocals!! He knew how to use his voice so perfectly.

**hepmeucsb** (8): Didn’t love the outro, but whew his vocals

**vayyiqra** (8): Nobody knows what "It" means, but it's provocative!

**bigbigbee** (7): SUCH a cool sound, but a little overlong on the outro for me.

**mynameistoo\_common** (7): kinda repetitive

**igorwithlicor** (6): I don't like his wailings, it doesn't work for me but the long ass section with just music kinda slaps hard af

**wryn\_** (6): I always get weirded out by boomers being horny on main. but prince gets a pass <3

**1998tweety** (5): I dont like his voice here

**stickywheels46** (5): Gotta be honest, I do not get why this track is mixed so poorly

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): https://i.gifer.com/origin/c9/c955ab8a1592f9be8c982011577fa37a_w200.gif

**ImADudeDuh** (4): me when some asks me what’s the first word of that british sitcom about nerds that stars richard ayoade

**seanderlust** (3.5): i don't think i'm crazy about the croaking of his voice in this one. lyrically, he has a weird beavis and butthead--like fascination with "doing it". also, i'm sorry but the "come on" whispers are creepy af. idk this one's a miss for me.

**bulforster** (3): Is this song souding bad meant to show that sex is overrated or something? Because if so I feel like the point could be made more subtly.

Imagine being the most successful artist to have ever lived, having just released the best selling album of all time and in the process of writing for your highly anticipated follow up you decide to write a song about breaking the law because you just want to go faster in your car. And you make that song absolutely slap too. If it were up to me this would be a day 3 song, but alas.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the dance party that I had in m bed when this came on… I was waving my arms around like a white person at a Devo concert… someone layer this over that video of Lindsay Lohan dancing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): kinda a major bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): Those drums in the chorus are catchy af

**bbfan132** (8): the production is great, it does kind of feel like a filler track though

**igorwithlicor** (8): That's a funky ass guitar and I love it

**J\_Toe** (8): trippy music video

**vayyiqra** (8): The bassline slaps

**bulforster** (7.5): The fact that the inspiration for this was just getting a speeding ticket makes it kinda cutesy, even with that bass.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This should’ve followed the opener, if it were shorter. It sonically works with Bad. Also some respect to Speed Demon cause it was the only song that wasn’t a single (for good reasons).

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it doesn’t sound like he’s saying demon it just sounds like speeding

**ManofOranges** (7): Reminds me of the time I was running laps during band practice and this one girl yelled to her sister "Let's go! Speed Demon!"

**mynameistoo\_common** (7): a bit repetitive

**waluigiest** (7): this song is very funny to me for some reason

**1998tweety** (6): ok, i wanted a faster song with a title like that

**wryn\_** (6): OK hear me out but if the cast of fast and furious were just drag queens this would be the movie's theme song

**akanewasright** (5): It’s cute but not great

**hepmeucsb** (5): For an otherwise catchy album, the hook is average at best...

**plastichaxan** (5): this is the opposite of those songs that get better as they go on

**sirpancakeXI** (5): That hook is not my cup of tea

**kappyko** (3): i usually love songs where the singer becomes a car or a vehicle but i'm not a big fan of his falsetto here for some reason. the guitar riff alongside the motors running though? AMAZING moment, genuinely exciting. really wish i liked the rest more though

**izeasklapaucius** (0): This is like something AJR would release if they were around in the 80s. Does that make sense? No, just like this song. And AJR.

In the category "Problematic lyrics but it slaps" this would definitely rank 1. It sounds really good, but these lyrics are just so incredibly bad. Him making fun of somebody who is in a bad relationship just because she rejected him is weird and I don't like it. That said the 'Na Na Na Na Na' part is very good.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): king of having two fat children and a drunken man

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A bop. George Michael’s vocals are always a treat and on this one, perfection.

**igorwithlicor** (8): That piano is so good, as is the rest of the song

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**bulforster** (7.5): This kinda bops but dude, do you want her back or are you here to gloat? Because it can't really be both.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): One of the better songs on album musically actually, there’s a solid groove and I like the guitar work, but the lyrics are… something?

**seanderlust** (7.3): .....okay, i'm giving this an above-7 rating because it slaps, but can we...NOT roast the domestic abuse victim like this?

**astrologicalangel** (7): a bit repetitive

**bbfan132** (6.5): this didn’t really do much for me at all but it sounded fine

**ziggytvs** (5): the only miss here

**ImADudeDuh** (0): oh these lyrics are NOT it at all. He’s almost making fun of an a***e v****m in this song? oof

This is honestly a bit annoying to me, him just continuously repeating Hot Thing doesn't help at all. I thought this would perform a lot worse to be totally honest, but I guess people liked the production. Also, this being at sport 32 is iconic, because he says hot thing 32 times.

---

**kappyko** (10): HOT HOT HOT HOT

**1998tweety** (9): here comes the smasha

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This composition is... there are no words. Only Prince could do this level production.

**bbfan132** (9): simple bop!

**bulforster** (9): The snarling, shuddering bass is a fantastic counterpoint to Prince's keen vocals and the horn line.

**igorwithlicor** (9): A very interesting track, smooth and experimental? Kinda Michael Jackson-y

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.7): okay come through sax

**slimboyfriend** (8): If anyone was singing about lusting after women in this way I would be disgusted... but idk I kinda like it :)))

**vayyiqra** (8): The Crystal Ball reference remains in “Hot Thing” and makes contextual sense (apocalyptic sex party!) but it also works without that bit of history, where it sounds like one of Prince’s mysterious sex riddles. well then

**ziggytvs** (8): hard aggressive dance funk Prince just hits different. pretty much all the alternate mixes slap too

**plastichaxan** (7.5): this would’ve been perfect if it hadn’t gone on for so long

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): enjoying the production but there’re just something missing from this that makes it great

**letsallpoo** (6): was gonna drag this until that sax solo

**ImADudeDuh** (3.2): 32 times. Yes i counted

**astrologicalangel** (3): pretty grating honestly

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Why is this so long and boring, who told Prince this was okay to release? Over half of it is just a repeat of the same riff with him screaming

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Generic 80s pop in a nutshell, we love to hear it!

STEVIE WONDER!!!!! AHHHHHHH! More seriously this song is a great duet. That said I guess people found it noisy with little substance why it didn't do great.

---

**bigbigbee** (10): This feels like familiar, safe territory for MJ, but the bright melody takes it a notch higher than “baseline MJ” for me. And baseline MJ is pretty great already.

**kappyko** (10): STEVIE IS SO FUCKING GOOD ON THIS IDC THIS IS SO FUCKING AKEGJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJEADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**TragicKingdom1** (9): WE WANT THE STEVIE WONDER RATE!!!!

**AHSWeeknd** (8): There isn’t a bad song on this album.

**bbfan132** (8): kind of got boring/repetitive towards the end but it was a banger - stevie sounded awesome here

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's catchy and fun, but didn't feel it as much

**J\_Toe** (8): wow, I'm not as familiar with this as I am with the album singles, but it's fun

**jsonphile** (8): I didn’t know this song, so it was a fun surprise to hear legend Stevie Wonder

**vayyiqra** (8): Can never get enough synth bass on MJ tracks

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): omg cheek to check? Invented lady Gaga and Tony Bennett

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**hepmeucsb** (7.5): A quintessential 80's pop song

**mynameistoo\_common** (7.5): a serviceable collab

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): is this song Gay?

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): omg I thought that was a kazoo playing at the beginning! Anyways this has a really funky bassline but the problem is that the melody is pretty flat and not that compelling

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): That synth sounds so aggresive

**stickywheels46** (6): Not a bad song by any means but for a collab with Stevie Wonder it could have been better

**akanewasright** (5): This is cute, and I love the way that Stevie and Michael contrast with each other, but the song just feels like a lot of excess with little substance.

**sirpancakeXI** (4): this song is underwhelming

**astrologicalangel** (2): no thank you

The most memorable part of this song is imo the last part, which I believed to be an uncredited female vocalist, but it's actually just him. It is a bit generic so it makes sense that it didn't do great.

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): wait this is great

**1998tweety** (9.5): p-word popper

**AHSWeeknd** (9): One of the best tracks on the album.

**igorwithlicor** (9): I love his energy, just random improvisation, and how hard this song slaps

**stickywheels46** (9): I'm only just finding out that's him at the end and not an uncredited feature from a female vocalist lol

**seanderlust** (7.7): i love the bass line on this one

**bbfan132** (7.5): versatile king

I live for the way he says BROTHER in the first verse. This was in the top 20 (as it deserved to be in the end) but freefell with the final scores, making it end up tying for the end of day 3.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): another bop

**seanderlust** (9): [Harmonica solo]

**1998tweety** (8.5): bopt

**bbfan132** (8.5): definitely a bop but it feels like a bonus track lol

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's very a pretty damn chill song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): back when we were able to walk the streets… :sob:

**ziggytvs** (8): deeply unfortunate this never made the album proper

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): a bop but just a tad too long

**oscarbrierley1** (7.2): could be like a minute shorter

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The chorus is so catchy, it's always stuck in my head.

**hepmeucsb** (7): It's good

**kappyko** (7): surprisingly catchy with a great bassline

**slimboyfriend** (7): It kinda sounds like The Way You Make Me Feel, and if it was ever finished, it could probably replace one of the weaker songs on here.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): this isn’t bad or anything but i feel it’s weaker than the standard songs edit: nvm this outro is serving

**bulforster** (6): This is fine but way too long.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): This song is so boring, it just does… nothing. It's not annoying or bad, but I have no interest in it at ALL

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This isn’t making me feel like a whore, this is just making me feel confused. Too disjointed

**wryn\_** (4): That harmonica outro is a miss

Rhyming joy with uptown boy has never sounded better. Seriously the lyrics here are great and I expected this song to do so much better than it did.

**sirpancakeXI** (11): that high note when he sing i don't want to learn to hold you touch you is making me shiver, it is so good.

**igorwithlicor** (10): I do love an angsty ballad

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/c8QG2uY.gif

**TragicKingdom1** (10): one of the best pop ballads OF ALL TIME!!!!

**hepmeucsb** (9): An 80’s ballad truly done right

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): i like this a lot actually edit: nvm lowered the score as it drags on a bit too much

**1998tweety** (8): snooze-y but good

**bbfan132** (8): this was a relaxing ballad to listen to

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I sleep. His vocals and emotion are great though

**waluigiest** (7): corny as hell but his voice is nice

**AHSWeeknd** (6): A great ballad that showed up too early in the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I usually complain about these songs being too long but for some reason this one felt too short? There was no build or journey or anything, when it ended I was just like “oh!”

**Roxieloxie** (6): my balladphobia is starting to come out

**slimboyfriend** (6): I like the opposing POVs between this and Father Figure

**astrologicalangel** (5): just a monotonous ballad

**skargardin** (5): pretty forgettable

**plastichaxan** (4.8): this is starting to all sound very similar
