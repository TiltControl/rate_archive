**Yatcho** (7.5): Surprising no one, this wild, experimental album closer is out first. points for experimentation, very bold to end the album with this. Would‚Äôve almost worked better as an into to Like a Prayer I think. You guys were way harsher than I expected on it

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): this is such a weird outro to place right after Spanish Eyes‚Ä¶ The guitar sound is interesting but this is barely a song &, even though it isn‚Äôt really trying to be, as an outro it doesn‚Äôt work that well given how jarring it feels

---

**bbfan132** (10): honestly i feel like this is a really smart outro, she‚Äôs begging for forgiveness for her sins and then she randomly goes off about something not being in the computer, showing that her behavior is just going to continue. interesting critique of christianity/catholicism, methinks

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I mean, only Madonna can close an album like this. Who knew Madonna was the Queen of ASMR with her prayer at the beginning of the song. I swear, if the scores are not included in this rate, I will message /u/Yatcho "WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT IN THE COMPUTER?"

**letsallpoo** (10): iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): did Madonna originate the "Neon Gumbo" basically taking a previous track and reworking it into weird shit but mix it with the Lord's Prayer? I am living.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.2): unironically the best song on the album bye

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (9): (distorted choir sings in background) odd choice for an outro but I love it

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): This actually kind of surprisingly good. Also ending an album with "WHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS NOT IN THE COMPUTER" is absolutely iconic

**1998tweety** (8): Weird outro, I liked it but wtf was that last line

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Is this the original ‚ÄúRoman Holiday‚Äù meme?

**kirby31200** (8): The Track 10 of the 80s

**waluigiest** (8): I HAVE A RESERVATION

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I love how weird this is. I was totally caught off guard when it came on.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): it's camp

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7): tbh since we're not rating the Janet interludes idk why we're rating this outro. There is no way this is not the first song that gets eliminated, that being said... WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT IN THE COMPUTER??!!!!

**J\_Toe** (7): was not expecting this as the closing track. It's so different to the rest. I'm impressed!

**bulforster** (6): I kind of like how unhinged this is.

**runaway3212** (6): I loved when she referenced a better song

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): It's thematically a great closer and I think it's a masterpiece on its own right, but it's the only song on the album that has always sounded straight up unpleasant to me and I can't rate it any higher than that.

**engifear** (4): Okay, I like experimental pop, but wtf was that, Madonna.

**kappyko** (4): Fuck u madonna!!!!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (4): WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT IN THE COMPUTER??

**sandyfishnets** (4): I love the idea of this song and how chaotic it is. Still I wish the guitar wasn't so front and center in the production, would have rated it much higher otherwise.

**ReallyCreative** (3): it's an interesting concept on one hand, on the other, it is incredibly unpleasant to listen to

**fadedblue09** (2): I feel like this was a big prank, and a really unfunny one at that.

**SmileAndTears** (2): Mama this is garbage. I don't care if this is supposed to be deep or something cuz it just sounds bad.

**vayyiqra** (1): **vayyiqra 07/15/2020** dear jessie and act of contrition one is just bizarre the other is pointless

**cremeebrulee** (0): what is this hunny (this wasn‚Äôt my zero until that weird ending lmaooo)

**ignitethephoenix** (0): umm what is this? Why does it barely fit in with the sound of the rest of the album? Why is she barely singing?

**ImADudeDuh** (0): everyone‚Äôs just vibing

**joshually** (0): Sorry I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúreal‚Äù song to be on the bottom!!!!

**seanderlust** (0): this sounds like a crappy performance art piece i feel obligated to go to because i know the performer.

**skargardin** (0): I love girl gone wild

**static\_int\_husp** (0): madge what the hell are you doin'?

**TiltControls** (0): hmm well this certainly exists

**wavingwolves** (0): i don't understand why this is in the album and i wish it wasn't

**WillamThunderfuck** (0): This hurts my ears and it sounds like she's trying to curse me wtf

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): I know she didn‚Äôt write this & I don‚Äôt think its actually about anyone particular but as the greatest woman ever Whitney should not be so hung up on whoever this man is

**Yatcho** (5): Least favorite of the filler ballads to be honest. Most of them are at least fairly generic and inoffensive, but we all decided this one was the most offensive for some reason

---

**bespectacIed** (10): her voice is literally the voice of god

**bulforster** (8): Whitney's particulary impressive vocals and Goffin's writing noticeably elevate this above the other ballads on this album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Probably my favorite of the ballads in the rate? Maybe I‚Äôm just lonely.

**kirby31200** (8): A really good ballad but it's not the best on the album

**SmileAndTears** (8): I'm not sure the lyrics make sense but it sounds good

**1998tweety** (7): meh except for the ending

**ManofOranges** (7): Not bad.

**fadedblue09** (6): Pretty standard as far as her ballads go.

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): girl what are you doing

**TragicKingdom1** (6): key change couldn't even save this from being limp. a bit better than the other filler ballads tho

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I am getting tired of the ballad bop ballad bop ballad sequencing of this album

**bbfan132** (5): some of the filler tracks were pretty, this was 4 minutes of nothing

**MrSwearword** (5): milquetoast as fuck

**wavingwolves** (4): eh

**joshually** (3): Oof, another generic ballad‚Ä¶. This time with a TERRIBLE message. You‚Äôre still my man even though you left me????? ‚ÄúThe thought that keeps me going each day, Is I believe you still love me‚Äù GURL BYE

**sandyfishnets** (3): this was really hard to rate. The first half of the song I did not care for, but then her vocals during the second half were amazing. Still, overall, as a whole the song was a meh from me

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): well, she's hitting the notes

**ImADudeDuh** (1): me @ bernie sanders after voting for biden

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): heterosexual and boring, aka the two worst things a song can be

**Yatcho** (7): Another ballad immediately bites the dust, surprising no one on balladphobiaheads. This one suffers from the same problem as the others, excellently performed but ultimately forgettable

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): Probably the most forgettable ballad on an album with more than its fair share of ballads, and one I assumed to be heading towards a day one exit

---

**materialqirl** (9.5): another of my fave whitney ballads

**bespectacIed** (9): there are tears in my eyes

**SmileAndTears** (9): The hook is so simple but so effective

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): not a good song to listen to when you just got dumped out of the blue after a 1 year relationship, lmao i‚Äôm sobbing

**joshually** (8): OMG okay you guys, this is legit a crazed stalker song disguised as a syrupy love ballad

**ManofOranges** (8): Stream Where U Are by Rina Sawayama.

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (8): magazineeeeeee

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A bit generic, but I do love some of the arrangements here, plus the solo elevates it a bit.

**1998tweety** (7): bored

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): again, not bad but huh?

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's fine but it's not spectacular

**bbfan132** (6): a pretty song but so unmemorable

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): rina outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Is it just me or is this the wimpiest saxophone solo I‚Äôve ever heard in a song? It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt tell him beforehand that it was gonna happen, they just pointed at him while they were recording and he was like ‚Äúuhhh‚Äù

**kirby31200** (6): Great vocal performance but not a standout otherwise

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): The background synth sounds like the one from that water level in Mario 64

**skargardin** (5): bye

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): In the first half I thought that her voice is so good it can make almost any silly hook work (you're love will save the day), but this song made it apparent that it can't. This album started strongly but almost completely fell apart form this song onwards.

**waluigiest** (5): her voice is great

**J\_Toe** (4): coming for Moana's gig

**sandyfishnets** (3): I feel like her voice is wasted on these crappy verse lyrics

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this honestly sounds produced exactly like those shitty covers of disney songs in the 90s by famous people because people couldnt handle that disney music slapped on its own so they needed to purify it even more???

**MrSwearword** (0): skipping this and pretending it doesn't exist, BYE

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): This is fine. Lyrically I really appreciate what it‚Äôs trying to do, and that lyrical approach makes for one of the most interesting songs here, though the actual sound of it doesn‚Äôt really do much for me once I‚Äôm listening to it

**Yatcho** (5.4): sorry but this put me to sleep

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): oh god every time i listen to this and think about my mom eventually dying and just lose it :(

**joshually** (10): Sometimes I imagine myself performing as a drag queen to this song and like, actually crying on stage and I get tipped $20s

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): i cried the whole song and it wasn't just because i am drunk but i'm going to say it was because i am drunk right now

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (9): Madonna's raw vocals in this are great

**fadedblue09** (8.5): The album's best attempt at soulfulness.

**runaway3212** (8): This song starts out a bit weak but I really love the end

**bbfan132** (7): probably going to place last but it‚Äôs a pretty song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is kind of nice ballad but I just don‚Äôt think Madonna is a ballad artist

**MrSwearword** (7): it's doing something but it's just this side of laborious for me

**1998tweety** (6.5): boring but inoffensive

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Generic piano ballad #9843758

**kirby31200** (6): It reminds me a lot of Jessica Simpson's Angels, which I'd rather listen to tbh. But Madonna gives a pretty good performance here

**ManofOranges** (6): Well, don't try just do!

**kappyko** (5.5): cute but eh....

**skargardin** (5): any emotional impact is kinda lost on me here sadly

**bulforster** (4): The verses are all too short so they don't have any room to breathe.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): smh Madonna wants to be Adele so bad üôÑ But seriously this is dinky. I appreciate that she went for some pathos but when the song ends I can physically feel her just give up, she wanted this song to be done.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): ok so we reached the obligatory "sad piano ballad" part of the album. The whiplash from the last song to this one is SO strong. The message is nice, but the delivery feels really standard

**vayyiqra** (4): **vayyiqra 07/15/2020** yeah that one piano ballad brought down the score too it's really boring **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** wait no promise to try, the dull ballad, that's worse

**bespectacIed** (2): madge's vocals... just nod and smile

**wavingwolves** (2): the way there's nothing going on on this song whatsoever

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this was so fucking boring.

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): what a SNOOZE!!!

**Yatcho** (6): Lovely and inoffensive... to bad theres 6 songs like this on the album! Next!!

---

**fadedblue09** (10): I love the chill vibes of this. My favorite of the non-singles.

**ManofOranges** (10): Honestly I really like this one?? It's calming but I dig it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): surprisingly great for a whitney album cut and it's partly because it's very Sade-esque imo

**bespectacIed** (9): i know this is boring to y'all but i could listen to whitney singing shampoo labels

**seanderlust** (8.8): there's something so breezy about this that I love!

**1998tweety** (8): ok this is a bit of a serve

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): I LOVE the production but the rest is just ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): finally, some Asian Mall music

**bulforster** (6.5): The sax is nice but this is way too long.

**joshually** (6): This is like‚Ä¶ peak grown & sexy quiet storm, which no one on this sub can relate to

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): nice sax

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): well i don't completely hate it, but it is cruise ship elevator music

**bbfan132** (5.5): whitney should‚Äôve ditched these nondescript ballads and just went with dance tracks ngl

**MrSwearword** (5): boring as hell

**skargardin** (5): another snoozer

**slimboyfriend** (5): I'm tired of being tired

**kirby31200** (4): There's not much special about this song other than Whitney, and I loathe these lyrics

**ReallyCreative** (4): it's just very uninteresting

**wavingwolves** (4): i just finished listening to this and i couldn't tell you what it sounded like

**ImADudeDuh** (2): karaoke tracks be like

**Yatcho** (9.5): In a potential premonition, Whitney wins best female artist over Janet and Madonna and puts on a vocal masterclass. This isn't exceptionally iconic or anything so I'm not surprised it's here at the bottom, but I still thought it was extremely captivating for a performance in which she doesnt move at all

**jackisboredtoday** (7): Whitney‚Äôs voice can do anything but there are only so many points I can keep giving the performances where she‚Äôs just stationary in one place the entire performance

---

**bespectacIed** (10): SERIOUSLY IS SHE EVEN REAL??? Seriously my favorite vocal performance of all time

**ManofOranges** (10): The way the video starts off with Whitney, Madonna, and Janet nominated for an award and then Whitney wins... This feels like foreshadowing. Anyways, Whitney has the voice of an angel, but what else is new?

**materialqirl** (10): OMG SHE IS SO CUTE I CANT

**seanderlust** (9): hearing her live performances, I think some of the songs on whitney were for sure written to be heard in person.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.5): This is the most 80's thing i've seen in my life

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): effortless vocals but i could use something more [2]

**bbfan132** (8): i think i preferred this to the studio version honestly, her vocals were out of this world here

**kirby31200** (8): Watching this made me sad :(

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Janet Jackson ROBBED

**skargardin** (6): I mean her vocals are amazing but I find this song and performance, by extension, terribly boring

**vayyiqra** (6): the part at the beginning was so cute :uwu:

**wavingwolves** (6): this makes me appreciate the song a little more but just a little

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): what is she wearing?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): This is pleasant, but it just kinda floats by, which is so much less than Whitney is capable of. Not bad, but kinda baffling to put this right up front on the album like she did

---

**kirby31200** (9): Smooth and sweet. The background singers really elevate this

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (9): love this soul track

**bespectacIed** (8): sexy

**ImADudeDuh** (8): idk i like this

**waluigiest** (8): weird right after I Wanna Dance With Somebody, but it‚Äôs good as far as her ballads go

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.6): i do like this song but it really drags

**1998tweety** (7): bored

**kappyko** (7): the "here's my advice" part is really good imo but the hook doesn't resolve very neatly. also is it just me or is this song kinda busy? like i swear i hear things going on around me but they're just in the song

**ManofOranges** (7): I could take or leave this one.

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): the vocals are good. it's not a bad song. and some of you need the message of it real bad, if the relationship advice sub is anything to go by.

**SmileAndTears** (7): Questionable lyrics and I don't know how the song is supposed to make me feel but it's pleasant

**bbfan132** (6.5): it was pleasant but i forgot about it right after

**seanderlust** (6.2): bonus point for the sax, but this feels like too quick a comedown from the emotional high that came before it

**fadedblue09** (6): Kinda a drag, but that sax solo is a highlight.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I was really into this at the start but by the halfway mark I felt like I‚Äôd already gotten everything I needed out of it and I was just kinda waiting for it to end.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this is fine but boring for sure and way longer than it should be

**MrSwearword** (6): a problem with vocalists like Whitney is that she can sing anything but the producers took that too literally and gave her any boring shit to deal with, case in point this

**ReallyCreative** (6): the song was pleasant at first but I'm not a fan of Whitney's howling towards the end, some odd things going on there

**skargardin** (5): this sure is a whitney ballad

**slimboyfriend** (5): sorry I'm balladphobic :/

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): Don't hate me but this is boring

**bulforster** (4): There's just not much to this.

**TiltControls** (3.5): Whitney's got some great ballads but this is not one

**wavingwolves** (3): i guess the worst thing about this is how boring it is

**joshually** (1): this song is kinda boring, sorry Nippy

**Yatcho** (6.5): Putting an end to the album while putting us all to sleep Whitney teams up with her mom to cover a song from an obscure musical based on an unreleased ABBA song.  OK

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I appreciate that its a nice duet with her mom but this is very strongly in the set of interchangeable Whitney ballads on the album for me

---

**joshually** (10): This is legit one of my favorite songs of all time by Whitney. The duet w/ her mother ‚Äì oh my goodness. Their voices just meld together so well, and the way Cissy sings ‚ÄúIt took some time to under-sta-ha-hand him‚Äù from her GUT is just mmm mmm mmmm

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): great duet omg

**seanderlust** (9.3): all too well found dead

**bespectacIed** (9): aw this duet is beautiful

**MrSwearword** (9): only because that money note toward the 1:50 mark carries this entire fucking song

**waluigiest** (9): this ballad is explosive and emotional and I‚Äôm into it

**ManofOranges** (8): Me thinking about the imaginary boyfriend that I've made up in my head.

**1998tweety** (7.5): the ending slays again but the rest is meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): For the uninitiated this is a song from the musical *Chess*, which was written by ABBA! Between that and the last track being written by Frank Wildhorn this album ends on a weirdly theatrical note? Anyways, I‚Äôve heard many takes on this song and this one is just okay, it‚Äôs not bad but kinda unspectacular. At the time it was probably a huge deal but all these years removed from the hype, it‚Äôs just okay.

**SmileAndTears** (7.3): Again, not sure about those lyrics but Whitney reminds us once again that she is a powerhouse.

**fadedblue09** (6): The weakest single on the album. Had no idea it was even one until this rate.

**kirby31200** (6): Yet another mostly boring ballad, kinda saved by the appearance of her mother

**sandyfishnets** (6): I love that this is a mother daughter duet :) Also, from Wikipedia: "Chess is a musical with music by Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus of the pop group ABBA...The story involves a politically driven, Cold War-era chess tournament between two grandmasters, one American and the other Soviet Russian, and their fight over a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other."

**skargardin** (6): never really cared for chess, or this

**wavingwolves** (6): this is at least mildly enjoyable

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i prefer chinese checkers

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): go read the wikipedia page for the musical this comes from and then try to listen to this song with a straight face.

**ReallyCreative** (5): while it's cool to see a mother-daughter duet, I just don't think this is that good

**bbfan132** (4): waiting room music that was clearly tacked onto the end of this by her label

**bulforster** (4): I can't believe fitzthistlewitz didn't mention this theme song in his review.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): yet another snooze. at least this one does something different by having a man‚Äôs voice too

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i dont know her either

**Yatcho** (9): Honestly shocked this is our next bonus song out! Janet is the QUEEN of choreography and she really doesnt let up for performances of this massive bop!

**jackisboredtoday** (8): Even in her simplest performance of the three here, Janet can dance either of the other two girls here under the table, and when we‚Äôre rating live performances that matters

---

**bbfan132** (10): yeah, she‚Äôs lipsyncing, but the choreography was so tight during this era and the song is flawless so

**J\_Toe** (10): I feel a lot of Janelle Monae's performances of Make Me Feel are inspired by this era of Janet choreography

**ManofOranges** (10): I really can't get enough of watching Janet dance. It also doesn't hurt that the song playing is Miss You Much.

**materialqirl** (10): THE CHOREO AND OUTFITS OMGGGG

**skargardin** (9): the preciseness of the choreo, how can you not STAN

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the choreo here is worse than Rhythm Nation imo but still really good

**seanderlust** (8.6): "JANET JICKSEN!" she looks like she is having so much fun with this one.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Janet Jickson ! I was shocked at how aggressive she‚Äôs still dancing at this song.

**slimboyfriend** (8): She's having so much fun with this choreography!

**wavingwolves** (7): her movements are so precise it's pretty incredible

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): The key ring as a hoop earring‚Ä¶ fashion. As much as I love the song though this seems like a weird performance for an awards show? Like there‚Äôs a weird disconnect in the vibe here.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): The most underrated song on Whitney‚Äôs album imo, and the one I wish she‚Äôd made a single, this is so fun and funky

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Seriously one of her best songs ever. This song (this entire album tbh) is a slap on the face of critics who say Whitney is not an album artist and has horrible deepcuts

**kirby31200** (9): Awesomely fun! Sure it's cheesy but its just a really good time

**bbfan132** (8.5): wait, this is a total bop‚Ä¶ hopefully it won‚Äôt be completely robbed

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Bop! With a few tweaks here and there this could've been as good as I Wanna Dance With Somebody

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): This is a cute bop!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): OK this is a really weird metaphor to base a whole song around, but it's catchy af so I don't really care

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): These lyrics are‚Ä¶ eccentric? But I like this, it‚Äôs wacky. It feels like it would be playing over the credits of some family movie about kids playing baseball or something.

**skargardin** (8): bop!!

**waluigiest** (8): it‚Äôs kind of corny but it‚Äôs still a jam and I‚Äôm here for it

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops

**bulforster** (7.5): This is a goofy song but I guess in a way that's kind of my jam.

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): what in the love is a battlefield hell

**ReallyCreative** (7): I kept expecting it to do something different and something more interesting but it never did. It's pretty good though.

**ManofOranges** (6): Love is NOT a contact sport.

**wavingwolves** (6): this reminds of when harry met sally so i like it!

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): This song almost sounds like it's from a really bad Disney movie from the 80s

**seanderlust** (5.3): "Contact Contact / Huh huh huh huh hoo huh yeah" - why is the way this section is worded on genius absolutely sending me

**fadedblue09** (5): Ehhh...a little too corny for me. This is not the type of 80s cheesiness I'm here for.

**vayyiqra** (5): weird title

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this isnt as good as some of the ballads but because this is upbeat it will make day 2 and go out at like 22

**joshually** (2): OMG this song is so corny‚Ä¶.. The message is good, but man, the datedness of the production makes me cringe

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): SLAAMMM!!!!! dunk this in the garbage

**MrSwearword** (1): now I know what DRAG IS NOT A CONTACT SPORT was referencing. The song itself is pretty fucking bad.

---

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): Madonna AND PRINCE??? this should've been a smash hit

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This sounds so ugly and weird but like, in a good way! I love music that makes me feel like a swamp creature. Also I noticed that this has some of the same lyrics as ‚ÄúHung Up‚Äù so I looked that up and I stumbled across [this message board from 2005](https://prince.org/msg/8/164033) and it was so quaint to read this. Hope all of these people are doing well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): only giving this a 9 cause prince <3 (and it‚Äôs kinda a bop too)

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this one in particular is slinky and sexy and makes me want to body roll in a dive bar. this is leather pants music. prince, you beautiful sexy bastard, god rest your soul.

**waluigiest** (9): from the very start I was like ‚Äúprince????‚Äù And then it was!

**bbfan132** (8): kind of odd/jarring but i like what prince brought to this song

**bespectacIed** (8): the production is insanely good ... but lemme give a hot take, prince and madge lacked chemistry in this omg. Their harmonies and adlibs sound messy together

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I need to be in a particular mood to listen to the song in full, but their harmonies sound so good here. It's such a shame this was a one-off collaboration.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): This is her The Light Is Coming

**kappyko** (8): i love this a bit lmfao. the simple drum machine beat

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): It's good, but it's always been more of a Prince song and if I want to listen to Prince, I can just listen to his own music.

**seanderlust** (7.9): shoutout this song's intro for reminding me to do my duolingo

**engifear** (7.6): Wild that guest vocalists used to not be credited as ft. all the time. I was quite confused by the vocals that sounded like Prince since Spotify didn't show him as being featured so I googled and found out it IS Prince. Thank you Martha Wash for changing this.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I think this song would be better if it only had one person singing. Their voices do not go well together. This is basically a Prince song in which Madonna comes off as a much weaker vocalist.

**runaway3212** (7): Loved her referencing a better song.

**selegend** (7): hung up sampling this for its hook was too iconic

**wavingwolves** (6.5): good

**ImADudeDuh** (6): you‚Äôd expect a collab from Madonna and Prince to sound better and yet

**ignitethephoenix** (5): kind of boring

**ManofOranges** (5): The best thing about this song is the fact that it in part contributed to the creation of Hung Up.

**MrSwearword** (5): it's funky, but it's not working for either artist here

**static\_int\_husp** (5): for a song that has Prince and lyrics that were eventually re-used in Hung Up, this should be a lot better!

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): imagine being a sissy in the late 80s and finally getting a madonna/prince duet and it's... this

**SmileAndTears** (4): This song confuses me. The production is really odd, the guy in the background in singing his ass off and kinda overpowering Madonna but most importantly I just don't understand what this is supposed to make me feel and what it's trying to convey.

**vayyiqra** (3): This is not a song I love

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): well, it's absolutely a song on this album

**bulforster** (0): I'm having an extremely strong negative reaction to this, it's such a dissonant and uncomfortable listen in a way that I don't think is fully intentional.

**fadedblue09** (0): Lemme file this under "high-profile collabs that sucked", of which Madonna has many (Me Against the Music, 4 Minutes, Give Me All Your Luvin, etc.).

**Yatcho** (6.8): A bit‚Ä¶ childlike? Storytime realness? Ren faire teas? Im not sure what‚Äôs going on here, nor how the hell it fits into an album with the themes of Like A Prayer. I'm not at all surprised this wasn't released in the US as a single

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): a European-only single, this gives me real Disney vibes (I guess on purpose given the Tinker-Bell video)‚Ä¶ idk this isn‚Äôt the worst thing i‚Äôve heard but its definitely not the best style for Madonna

---

**bbfan132** (10): i love this, it‚Äôs kind of cheesy but it‚Äôs still fun

**kappyko** (10): this is gorgeous sorry!!!!!!

**materialqirl** (10): overhated :(

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): Walt disney is shaking this bops hard

**1998tweety** (9): wait this is a cute serve

**ManofOranges** (9): This is a really interesting sounding one to me, but like in a good way.

**selegend** (9): her disney serve

**wavingwolves** (9): oh this has a really nice instrumental

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): I have a feeling my score is gonna be an outlier, but something about this song just feels so dreamy and sweet to me and it feels like something I would play for my children (if I would ever want children, which I don't)

**runaway3212** (8.5): This is really sweet

**seanderlust** (8.3): this is the most disney song i've ever heard from madonna

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is probably Madonna's most G-rated song ever that it's actually really cute! I love how this song smoothly transitioned to Oh Father, which serves as the grim contrast to this song's happy message.

**joshually** (8): I have come to appreciate this song a lot many many many years later

**MrSwearword** (8): it's at least weird but delivered all storybook style. In other words, it's saccharine nonsense but Madonna sounds great singing it. I just wish it was better.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i don't know, this song is very outdoor festival cover band with an audience of one drunk white lady dancing in a pair of barely holding on flip flops, but i love it

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): I don't know what I was expecting but carnival music wasn't it

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Don't have any strong opinion about this one

**fadedblue09** (7): I like some of the orchestral elements but this is literally a Disney reject.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I know I listen to Meghan Trainor and watch direct to video Barbie films but this is too much even for me. Points for her *going for it* though, this really got stranger and stranger as it went on. Predicting this going out early, possibly first.

**CritneySpearz** (6.5): drug music

**RandomHypnotica** (6): It feels like a party every day, hey, hey, hey ,hey ,hey Jessie!

**kirby31200** (5): I would appreciate what this going for more if it were on like a Madonna lullaby collection for kids and not this album. The song sounds beautiful but the little kid fantasy imagery stuff is a bit overdone

**skargardin** (5): I mean this is sweet and all but sonically it's a mess. Honestly surprised that this ever was a single

**bulforster** (4): I'm so confused.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): literally already forgot what this song sounds like and i just listened to it

**waluigiest** (2): this feels like a bad Kate bush impression I really don‚Äôt vibe with this

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): bottom 5 song of her career idc idc idc it's cheesy ASS

**vayyiqra** (0): This is like one of the worst Beatles songs meets one of the worst Joanna Newsom songs and just as cursed as that combo would seem. **vayyiqra 07/15/2020** dear jessie [...] is just bizarre **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** [...] dear jessie is a 1

**Yatcho** (8): I think this is only so low because of her iconic the other performances in this rate are, because on its own its a great example of a minimalist performance being done to the max

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): the light-up staircase is such a nice visual but this could‚Äôve used a little more going on around the three women‚Äôs choreo

---

**bbfan132** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic‚Ä¶

**CritneySpearz** (10): a performer W0W

**fadedblue09** (10): A very soulful and energetic number.

**ManofOranges** (10): Maybe not the most over the top performance ever but I really love it! It's got a lot of charm, and I'm entertained watching it.

**materialqirl** (10): "YEAH"

**seanderlust** (9.5): not to take attention from Madonna but my lord can we talk about those vocal harmonies?

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): That cheeky little ‚Äúyeah‚Äù at the end‚Ä¶ she knows she killed that. I give Madonna a hard time a lot for her music but she‚Äôs undeniably an electric live presence, being able to work a stage like this with just two backup dancers and some choreography is a talent. Predicting this wins the bonus rate.

**astrologicalangel** (8): waaayyyyy better than the album version for some reason

**bespectacIed** (8): the blonde ambition version better

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): it's simple, but it gets the point across. and that hair, oh god that hair.

**wavingwolves** (8): this performance makes me appreciate this song that much more

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.5): I love the font because it screams they used final cut, but I hate that they used Final Cut to change the aspect ratio

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Those backing vocalists BROUGHT IT.

**kirby31200** (7): She looks like she's having fun

**TragicKingdom1** (7): competently executed but not groundbreaking imo

**ImADudeDuh** (6.3): I kinda feel like her vocals were not good for a lot of this?? Definitely had some iconic moments tho

**skargardin** (5): this is ... very uneven

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (5): Madonna's hair looked funny

**vayyiqra** (5): too bad it started with a sample from everybody which is a way better madonna song than this mid one with a mid performance

**Yatcho** (7.5): You know what, this is a lot of wholesome cheesy 80s fun elevated way beyond the simplistic lyrics by Whitney's 5 star voice. Unfortunate it did not make it longer into the rate!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): The single that finally broke Whitney‚Äôs streak of 7 consecutive #1 hits by ‚Äúonly‚Äù getting to the top 10. Its uptempo and fun but its the weakest of the three true dance songs on the album

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Euphoric. The laugh at the end gives me buzz

**selegend** (10): LEGENDDDD

**fadedblue09** (9): Got a little repetitive towards the end but it's a really vibrant, soulful slice of dancepop.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song is good, but the chorus is the best part. It's music that you'd listen to driving around Paleto Bay after you've chased off the bikers harassing your bar.

**ReallyCreative** (9): fun and energetic, if maybe a little derivative of what we expect from Whitney

**materialqirl** (8): i like this song substantially more than the last one

**MrSwearword** (8): only because the production is pretty god-tier especially for the time

**waluigiest** (8): the bells kinda slap

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): corny but bops

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**joshually** (7): Another Whitney single that I‚Äôm kinda meh about

**kirby31200** (7): Something about this makes it feel like cheap soundtrack filler

**TragicKingdom1** (7): production is both cheesy and bland tbh. not surprised this didn't take off like the other singles

**bbfan132** (6): this is the definition of a filler dance pop track lmao, cute i guess but nothing special

**skargardin** (6): the keychange is nice i suppose

**wavingwolves** (6): kinda cute

**bulforster** (5.5): Her voice just doesn't really get to shine here and never quite gels with the production either.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Not even Whitney can save this cliche of a song.

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): Hmmm... now I'm gonna pass on that one

**ImADudeDuh** (5): weirdly produced? Idk also this did not have to be 5 minutes

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): glad we left this in the ‚Äò80s

**ManofOranges** (4): How long is this song????

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (4): production is dated and songwriting is alright

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): For how much dragging Whitney got for her ballads I'm surprised how close this got to day 2. La Isla Bonita but make it depressing

---

**sandyfishnets** (11): so I have never heard this song before doing the rate. Since then I have listened to it multiple times and I just love the melody, her voice and the emotions she portrays in this.

**runaway3212** (10): Just really great

**selegend** (10): it‚Äôs a beautifully haunting song

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): Madonna was pouring her HEART out in this

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): light my WIG

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): I love adult contemporary Madonna, stream Something To Remember!

**bbfan132** (9): beautiful song and knowing that she‚Äôs singing about the aids epidemic and her friend who died from aids makes it even more poignant

**ManofOranges** (9): Between this and La Isla Bonita, Madonna kinda has a thing for spanish stuff I guess?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This song continues Madonna's fascination with Latin music. From the lyrics, it was very timely as it was about Madonna dealing with the death of a friend who died because of AIDS. Coincidentally, the lyrics can be applied to what's happening during this pandemic and how many lives were lost that could've been saved.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a nice AIDS victim song.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**seanderlust** (7.3): okay I initially didn't like this song, but knowing it's about friends who died during the AIDS crisis, and this was made when AIDS was still a taboo topic...mad props, madge.

**fadedblue09** (7): I appreciate the message but I wished I liked it more because it really drags after a minute.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): la isla Bonita outsold for Spanish themed Madonna songs

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.3): score would be higher if this didn‚Äôt drag on for so long

**bespectacIed** (6): i like the horns

**cremeebrulee** (6): yes i know what the song is about but alas it‚Äôs still something i wouldn‚Äôt return to

**skargardin** (6): The sentiment behind it is obv tragic but i honestly feel none of the emotions this is supposed to convey

**MrSwearword** (5): "I LIGHT THIS CANDLE" with scratchy vocals is just a no here.

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): i mean it isn't a bad song

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Gotta love those pre-*Evita* vocals! This is trying to be Asian Mall Music but it doesn‚Äôt quite get there so it‚Äôs just kinda boring rather than kitschy.

**SmileAndTears** (0): Oh Lorde, her rasp makes my ears bleed. Disappointed cuz this started out promising but the rasp completely ruined the song
