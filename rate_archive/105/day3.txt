**Yatcho** (9): Really a bit of whiplash from the opening title track, she excellently showcases the other aspect of this album with a powerful message about how much society sucks and how we need to do better.It’s kind of weird how a song like that bops so hard but I’m not going to mark it down, its still extremely listenable

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): Pop girls oughta try making more story-songs about characters again, this is actually good

---

**bbfan132** (10): i love how straightforward the lyrics are, she immediately goes right into calling out the injustices happening in society at the time

**bespectacIed** (10): only janet will sing about human misery in a jack swing beat and make it work

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If the title track was political, wait until they hear State of the World. The topics that Janet tackled in this song may be common in music today, but I am pretty sure this song was quite shocking for its time. A popstar is tackling homelessness, prostitution, bullying, and suicide in a song that is very upbeat and club-ready? A revolutionary concept that only Janet Jackson could execute at that time.

**materialqirl** (10): giving me 2020 tease

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): god this is so good

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): a politically driven anthem that deserves more recognition

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): socioeconomically minded queen

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): I like this song, but it  does goes on for a little too long, to the point where it gets a bit repetitive

**bulforster** (9): Bopping to these lyrics feels a bit wrong.

**cremeebrulee** (9): oh this is a banger i love the production on this

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Janet really said the world sucks but let me just make a bop about it

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): give us a message, a chorus, a moment, ugh legend legend legend

**SmileAndTears** (9): Bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): chorus on this slaps

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): I feel kinda bad for trying dance to a song with such a serious message lmao

**MrSwearword** (8): only because the production and lyrics are socially conscious fire. Vocals are slightly underdelivering it but I can only forgive it so much.

**selegend** (8): bopping to a song about suffering people

**skargardin** (8): banger

**waluigiest** (8): congress is shaking….

**wavingwolves** (8): i love the way this is both hopeful ("let's weather the storm together") and still pretty dark in sound and subject

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Look this song just makes me sad, the message is powerful (and tragically still resonant over two decades later) but it’s not something I want to be reminded of while listening to music.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): not amazing but better than the actual state of the world

**fadedblue09** (7): I love the interlude before this, it really completes the song. Anyway, it's fine, though lyrics can get a little too heavy-handed sometimes.

**ManofOranges** (7): Tumultuous

**runaway3212** (7): This song has great lyrics, but I don't like the sound that much.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): Of all the singles from this album, this is the one that feels the most like it could be a hit today. Probably the catchiest melody on the album & a well-deserved smash. Honestly really surprised it didn't end up higher than a couple of songs that are still here

**Yatcho** (7): For some reason this didn’t click for me as much as it seemed to with everyone else, since this was a massive smash hit apparently. It’s very cute but is surrounded by songs that just outdo it on all levels

---

**bbfan132** (11): this is the perfect love song imo. i love how she starts off by singing in a lower octave and then raises her voice in the second verse before ending with her soaring vocals. even though it’s pretty simple lyrically, she gets her point across really well and not a second is wasted in this nearly 6 minute track. lastly, the visuals in the music video are stunning and elevate this song even more for me (even though it was already perfect to me). overall, i fucking love this and hope it ends up in the top 10 lol

**joshually** (11): Imagine being the SEVENTH SINGLE from an album released OVER A YEAR PRIOR (and I aint talkin about no chump re-release or special edition bonus song tacked on)… and going to #1? THE POWER! THE KNOWLEDGE! THE STRENGTH!

**kappyko** (11): i listened to this on repeat crying at school lol

**materialqirl** (11): BOP SMASH HIT CULTURAL RESET, DESERVED ITS ENTIRE CHART RUN AT #1

**wavingwolves** (11): this is such a exhilarating track!!!! immediate mood lifter and i love it!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic, nothing else to say

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): euphoric

**fadedblue09** (10): If Miss Whitney loses for some reason, I hope this one takes it. Such a fun, euphoric bop.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song holds a special place in my heart because, like a few other songs in this rate, I associate it with my mom and I listening to music together when I was kid. It just brings back good memories! And also it's just a great song. This had a good chance of being my 11.

**skargardin** (10): 11 contender!!

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): (Prince was supposed to be on this but he went for Madonna instead) love how Janet sings in two different keys

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Oh I really like this one

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): they don't make love songs like this anymore. what an experience.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This was the only album in the rate I’d listened to before but it’s been a while so I didn’t remember a lot of it and this was such a nice treat to rediscover! Janet’s voice has always been on the smaller side but she writes songs like this that really allow her to work around that. And I love the synth work here, the juxtaposition of hard and soft.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): So apparently the song was meant to be a duet, which I am glad that idea didn't materialize. Janet's versatile vocals are a highlight in this song.

**kirby31200** (8): It sounds good but it doesn't quite justify its runtime imo

**slimboyfriend** (8): I keep waiting for the bops to relent but they never stop

**seanderlust** (7.7): this is a fun bop!

**runaway3212** (7.5): very nice

**ImADudeDuh** (7): good but way too repetitive at the end

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): Various publications told me this would be a stand-out song, but after listening to the album I have no idea why they think that. It's filler to me.

**J\_Toe** (6): sounds a lot like Miss You Much

**MrSwearword** (5): by this point in the album, the production becomes samey for my liking, but I mean she sounds fine on it.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): just pure bliss to listen to, probably the happiest song on this album and one of the best.

**Yatcho** (8): Again a very cute song that probably would’ve benefited from being later in the track listing as it blends in with the other songs

---

**bbfan132** (10): one of the first janet songs i heard and it will always be special to me

**bespectacIed** (10): pop perfection!!!!!!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Doesn’t really fit with the theme of the album but this is a great pop song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is one of my mom’s favorite Janet songs.

**kappyko** (10): omg queen

**materialqirl** (10): my 2nd fave janet song -- you can tell which is the first

**MrSwearword** (10): a cute gem in her discography, honestly.

**ReallyCreative** (10): it was a brain chemistry reset

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): QUEEN OF CHEERFUL BOPS

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): i need an escapade yes

**fadedblue09** (9.5): The album's moment of pure pop bliss.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): BOP!

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): give us an anti-capitalist self care anthem, queen

**wavingwolves** (9): i would LOVE to es ca pade and leave my worries behind

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This song makes me want to have a picnic

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**seanderlust** (7.9): love that the directive was to add some adlibs and the first thing janet thought of was shouting "minneapolis!"

**bulforster** (7): I know it's intentional but Escapade is just a weird word, cute song though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The melody of this kinda reminds me of “Someone To Call My Lover” at points, and I think that song refines it into something way better. This is okay but I wouldn’t have made it a single, but it was a hit though so what do I know?

**ManofOranges** (7): Not a stunner to me, but still good.

**runaway3212** (7): really good, but a bit too repetative

**jackisboredtoday** (10): now this is IT!! The dancing, the swagger in her performance, everyone needs to take notes (and everyone needs to apologize to me personally for letting Janet be first out in the bonus rate when this is easily the best performance here).

**Yatcho** (9): Basically a recreation of the music video but I’m not complaining! Chanelling her choreographic perfectionism into a high energy rock song produces amazing results

---

**astrologicalangel** (10): improved my whole view of the song

**bbfan132** (10): queen of rock

**CritneySpearz** (10): the m o v e s.  She looks a lot like MJ here, I often forget they were siblings lmfao

**ManofOranges** (10): Goddamn I can't get over how hard this song goes. Love the performance. Janet center stage is all I need.

**materialqirl** (10): rock janet is such a SERVE

**skargardin** (10): SHE SNAPPED OH MY GOD

**kirby31200** (8): Props to the choreographer, though those cat swipes were a choice

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Turn down those backing vocals and let’s see how brave Janet is. But yes to the choreo

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): queen shit

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I couldn't stop laughing when she popped open her shirt to get all wild but then started dancing with the dorky white guitarist in sunglasses, board shorts and a bowling hat

**bespectacIed** (7): it's unremarkable tbh love janet tho

**vayyiqra** (6): awful quality video but this kind of bangs

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): I don’t even really have a ton to say about this one, but its great and I feel like everyone knows that it’s great

**Yatcho** (9): The Michael influence really jumps out on this one.Its more of the same excellently produced new jack swing and just a really fun song and dance

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): One of my absolute favorite Janet songs! The chorus is so much fun to scream along to. I love how subtly complex this one is, if you really listen closely to it there’s so much going on but it all works together flawlessly. Like the way the background voices spelling the words creates essentially a second beat for the song… genius.

**bbfan132** (10): kind of straightforward after the first few songs that were more political but i still love it

**bespectacIed** (10): so good

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): everyone should listen to the shep pettibone remix of this and tell me he didnt recycle it for vogue lmao

**ImADudeDuh** (10): bop alert

**joshually** (10): A CLASSIC

**ManofOranges** (10): How I would expect my parents to act whenever I "ran away" from home by packing two shirts and pants in my backpack and walking down the street just because I couldn't have a sleep over.

**materialqirl** (10): miss youuuuuu much

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): look when miss jackson asks me to dance, i dance. and this song is worth the pain in my back when i really get into my 80s moment and go all out. my downstairs neighbor and my body might hate me, but the spirit of dance will always be on my side.

**skargardin** (10): the way she snapped

**slimboyfriend** (10): This is the kind of song I think of when I think of music from the late 80s and it's perfect.

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): a really catchy lead single

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): the light dissonance in the chorus is a little jarring but adds a lot of character, and keeps this song from sounding even more similar to the rest of the album

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.4): I MISS YOU MUUUUCH!

**seanderlust** (9.1): i love the way she delivers the line "send it in a letter"

**1998tweety** (9): bop of a chorus

**runaway3212** (9): This video made me appreciate this song a lot more, LWYMMD could never.

**wavingwolves** (9): whew!!!!

**fadedblue09** (8): Iconic hit. Got a little repetitive towards the end, but still bops hard.

**J\_Toe** (8): the most 80s sounding song of the bunch

**RandomHypnotica** (8): That bridge is REALLY pretty

**MrSwearword** (6): I'm to understand that this song has IMMENSE chart achievements but I'm not fond of it that much.

**bulforster** (3.5): I'm really turned off by how rigid this is for some reason, Janet's iconic hard-hitting 80s production just works so much better for me when it's swung.

**Yatcho** (9): Just missing out on top 5 with what’s easily the second best song on the album and a fan favorite. Honestly it’s true that this original album version is not the best or fan favorite version of this song but its still quite the bop! If we were rating the visuals surrounding this song (the music video, iconic cone bra) it would get even higher marks

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): One of the most remembered singles of this album (and maybe of Madonna’s whole 80s run?)… I don’t love the album version of this anywhere near as much as the Immaculate Collection remix but that post-chorus holds up no matter which version you’re listening to

---

**mrcommotion** (11): made me stan older pop music

**1998tweety** (10): massive serve, iconic af

**bbfan132** (10): hot take (i think) but i prefer this version to the synthpop/hi-nrg/electropop single version that more people know

**bespectacIed** (10): Thank you madonna for making me look up what "reductive" means

**CritneySpearz** (10): iconic

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): She’s a cute girl [Album version] you know cute next to gorgeous [Shep Pettibone remix] gorgeous is gonna you know devour cute

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): if we were rating the celebration version, this would be my 11

**joshually** (10): I stopped going for second best because of this song.

**ManofOranges** (10): Another pure hit. I remember watching the music video of this song with my mom when I was like 6 or 7. I still haven't come out to her yet but she better not be surprised because what do you expect when you watch Madonna music videos with your son when he's young.

**materialqirl** (10): dear all str*ight women

**skargardin** (10): DON'T GO FOR SECOND BEST BABYYY

**wavingwolves** (10): yes i love born this way by lady gaga

**bulforster** (9.5): Feminism!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): im like the only person who prefers the album mix but its so funky! also people who still drag out the born this way beef... electric chastity cage!

**seanderlust** (9.5): >:( OKAY FINE, I HEAR HOW THIS SONG AND BORN THIS WAY SOUND SIMILAR. ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY?

**J\_Toe** (9): I honestly prefer the Immaculate Collection version of Express Yourself, but this is still good

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): every senior citizen gay heard born this way and said oh come on, miss gaga, these babies might not know, but the rest of us know. and there is nothing better than the original.

**ReallyCreative** (9): the chorus is one of the most iconic in pop music, the verses are just ok but it's still an amazing song

**slimboyfriend** (9): I prefer the remix, but this is still a slapper. And the video is incredible

**SmileAndTears** (9): Can't believe she time travelled to plagiarize Born This Way

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (9): (i prefer the remix but this album version slaps as well) born this way shaking

**waluigiest** (9): born this way the house down boots yes on god xx

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Express Yourself would have been a 10 if the single remix was included in this rate. The original version is still pretty good, but there's a reason why the remix version is iconic.

**runaway3212** (8): I disagree with the sentiment, but this song is good

**kappyko** (7.5): the horns bump this up

**kirby31200** (7): I much prefer the Immaculate Collection version, which is a 10/10. I don't think this version aged quite as well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.7): okay this is good but incredibly overrated

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I hate these painfully ‘80s Madonna songs but this is probably one of the best.

**vayyiqra** (6): **vayyiqra Today at 1:13 AM** never got into this song idk **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** also the drama about born this way sounding like express yourself: - yes it does sound very much like that - born this way is still way better whereas express yourself is highly mediocre i can't believe it was a hit single still the title track is the only 10 on it **vayyiqra 07/15/2020** idk why but i never liked express yourself that much it's alright i guess

**fadedblue09** (5): Really generic and corny

**MrSwearword** (1): even if we're not taking the buying into the Gaga controversy, this song just flat out sucks.

**Yatcho** (10): SashaVelour.gif

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): a near-perfect song, there’s not even a lot to say about it. Its just fantastic pop

---

**astrologicalangel** (11): this is better than I Wanna Dance With Somebody, and I will die on this hill

**CritneySpearz** (11): me about this song: I don't know why I like it, I just do (jk it's iconic, chorus infectious af, etc)

**1998tweety** (10): you can't mention this song without bringing up Sasha's iconic reveal. That aside this song bops really hard too.

**bbfan132** (10): sasha velour rose wig reveal… just put this in that section lol

**bespectacIed** (10): 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹

**engifear** (10): I love this Mariah song

**fadedblue09** (10): Ok maybe I'm wrong, there are more 11 contenders here than I thought.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This song is the definition of an 80's BOP and I can't stop wondering if 90's popheads were like ewwww this song sounds soooo dated

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Me trying not to mention you know what because every other comment will mention it already, and probably already have comments mentioning how every other comment will mention it https://www.muhealth.org/sites/default/files/2019-02/Excessive-Sweating_0-compressor.jpg

**J\_Toe** (10): Honestly surprised the cheering sound is actually in this song's music video (I first heard this in the Sasha/Shea lip sync and thought it was the sound of the drag race audience, but it's not)

**materialqirl** (10): BOP

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BOP!!!

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): gather round girls and gays. this song is a legendary moment for so many reasons, but it is also the song that was playing when i witnessed two drag queens fight each other over what i don't remember, but god there was so much glitter and somebody threw a glass that didn't break which made it much more awkward when they both stormed off. fighting is so awkward in real life.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Yeah, the rock aspects of this song feel a little plastic, but my god that chorus, my god the harmony in the chorus!!!

**seanderlust** (10): okay yes this song gave us one of the most iconic drag race lip syncs but it is also an absolute banger. this was in my top 2 for my 11.

**skargardin** (10): stream Orville Peck - Roses Are Falling

**TiltControls** (10): roses

**TragicKingdom1** (10): if an upbeat whitney song wins PLEASE let it be this

**waluigiest** (10): COME THRU SASHA VELOUR

**wavingwolves** (10): this is perfect house cleaning music

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): aint it shocking what... LOVE CAN DO!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I was lying down when I listened to this and when she went ^^”hee” I stuck my leg in the air and it’s probably the best thing I’ve done all month.

**ManofOranges** (9): For some reason I don't like this song whenever I'm not listening to it, and then when I do listen to it I swallow my pride and acknowledge that I really do like this song. I have no idea why.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): classic but this is better if it was at 1.5x speed (like the glee version)

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This song is integral to Whitney Houston's legacy as a component of the collective queer imagination, and THAT is on period

**joshually** (8): In Whitney’s vast catalog of singles, this was never a favorite of mine… but it definitely got new life because of Drag Race, and I’m okay with that.

**kappyko** (8): amazing chorus but the production feels stuffier here than on i wanna dance with somebody

**SmileAndTears** (8): Bop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): For a song called "So Emotional", the instrumental really lacks emotion

**kirby31200** (7): Whitney gives such an amazing performance it's almost too much

**MrSwearword** (7): it's fine for what it is, but even when not taking into account Sasha Velour making Shea Coulee's run on Drag Race come up short of roses, this song above par at best.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): Janet’s voice on this is everything!!! She swaggers across the guitar here so hard and its glorious. More pop girls should be emulating this sound even today.

**Yatcho** (10): A hugely successful genre shift to rock in the middle of this album, this is an adrenaline hit for an album that didnt even need it. Amazing placing for a song that I would bet most of us didn’t know too well before this rate. I need Janet and Mariah to release their rock albums asap

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): it was between this or miss you much but i think this has a better chance. i love how rich and layered this song is

**ImADudeDuh** (11): FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!! This is SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! I FUCKING LOVE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**seanderlust** (11): this is a JAM. i'm always a sucker for pop songs that use guitar like this.

**bbfan132** (10): a total serve, i need more rock tracks from janet

**bespectacIed** (10): second best song on the album after title track, i fucking love the glam rock vibe of this song. The moment those guitars came in, it's over for humanity

**bulforster** (10): Janet can really pull off almost any genre.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented rock

**fadedblue09** (10): I'm living for the rock influences here.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): heard good things about this song going into this album, and it lives up to it

**joshually** (10): "Black Cat" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, making her the only artist in history to receive nominations spanning five genres.

**kappyko** (10): I THOUGHT THIS SONG WAS STUPID AT FIRST NVM SHE SNAPPED FUCK AHAHHGEHBHBHBHBGHAEE

**ManofOranges** (10): I wasn't expecting something this... good. This song just goes so hard, and that guitar is absolutely enthralling. I can see why so many people were talking about giving their 11s to this song.

**materialqirl** (10): we love a rock-new jack swing fusion!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): the only song by a black woman to top the Rock charts (and the Hot 100 at the same time) which she composed BY HERSELF and was a longstanding exhibit A as to why she should've been inducted into the RRHoF.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is such a fun shake up in the tracklist and the fact that she wrote this by herself?? the guitar solo??? this is such an artistic flex

**runaway3212** (10): this is the best song on the album and she wrote it all by herself. iconic.

**skargardin** (10): we love a self written BANGER!!

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): QUEEN OF ROCK fun fact Janet wrote this herself

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): It's a really amazing song and if Like A Prayer didn't already own my heart, this would get an 11. I wouldn't mind it winning, discovering this song was the best thing that came out of doing this rate.

**wavingwolves** (10): yas furry anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): she really snapped here omg

**1998tweety** (9.5): this is a serve, love the guitar

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Damn, Janet is so versatile! I love hearing her vocals here.

**kirby31200** (9): If the singer yells "Guitar!" before a solo, you know it's gonna be good

**slimboyfriend** (9): Is there anything Janet Jackson can't do

**sandyfishnets** (8.5): hell yea gimme that 80s hair metal vibes!!!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Didn't expect a rock song on this album but it's pretty good

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): it's sexy, it's guitar forward, it makes me want to head bang but also throw ass, it's beautiful

**waluigiest** (8): shred!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): yeah, I listen to rock music

**Yatcho** (10): It’s telling that she was able to turn the most basic song in our culture into one of her most landmark, iconic performances. This is someone that just oozes talent and charisma in a way very few have ever done.RIP

**jackisboredtoday** (9): I hate America, I hate Americans, but I love Whitney… so I’m conflicted

---

**1998tweety** (10): insanely iconic, she owned this

**bespectacIed** (10): the only thing america is allowed to be proud of is this performance

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this would be an 11 in a national anthm rate

**fadedblue09** (10): Fergie wishes

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): the score is completely based on Whitney's voice, otherwise it would be a 1 lmao. Also more aspect ratio talk but omg i am obsessed that the video is in 4:3 and yet the actual performance is a letterboxed 16:9

**ImADudeDuh** (10): IM PROUD OF BEING AN AMERICAN ALL OF A SUDDEN OMG

**J\_Toe** (10): what all national anthem performances aspire to be

**joshually** (10): THE definitive national anthem.

**ManofOranges** (10): I used to think when I was pretty young that Whitney was just a regular person who got her big break with this performance of the National Anthem, catapulting her into success. I have no idea why I thought that, but I did. And then one day I asked my mom about it, and she was like "...what are you talking about?"

**materialqirl** (10): no one will EVER top this. EVER.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I mean yeah

**skargardin** (10): coming for perfect ten average methinks

**slimboyfriend** (10): I think it's so great that we cover Whitney Houston's song at the beginning of every sports game. I hope nobody made the same joke as me.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): one of the ~~best~~ gayest DJ sets I've been at started with this recording of the anthem, and then dropped into Run Away With Me by Carly during that final note on "braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaavvvvvveeeee"

**TragicKingdom1** (10): listening to this on the day trump got covid :') hopefully this ages well because this reveal is after the election

**vayyiqra** (10): support our troops o7

**SmileAndTears** (9): Goddamn her voice is so powerful

**astrologicalangel** (8): , this was beautiful but I just do not like the Star Spangled Banner

**kirby31200** (7): She really was the best

**bbfan132** (5): the star spangled banner is a 0 but her vocals are a 10 here so i’m giving this a 5

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**astrologicalangel** (10): lord I wish I could give this an 11

**bbfan132** (10): probably one of the first live performances i saw and loved, everything about this was amazing

**bespectacIed** (10): ba ba ba by lon

**CritneySpearz** (10): not a Madonna stan but maybe now I am holy shit this was so good

**J\_Toe** (10): why aren't the men wearing pants in this performance?

**kirby31200** (10): Rich white lady orders gay men of color to dance for her amusement

**ManofOranges** (10): How do you not give this performance a 10? Hell, I would give this an 11 if I could. Say what you will about the song, this performance perfectly embodies everything the song is about and does it in away that is just oh so perfect. I've probably watched this performance at least 50 times, it's THAT good. And after sending in this ballot, I'll probably watch it another 50 times.

**materialqirl** (10): literally the BEST performance of her career

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): they don't make performances like this anymore, and it's a damn shame. it might be my old lady talking, but the costumes, UGH the costumes. the cleavage, the fans, the makeup, the hair, the music, the MOMENT

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everything about this is so incredibly iconic. The victorian aesthetic, the fans, the "moves" the male dancers pull, so so good

**skargardin** (10): fucking iconic

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): ICONIC ICONIC ICONIC

**vayyiqra** (10): way better madonna song and iconic performance this fucks

**waluigiest** (10): literal cultural reset

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): gay rights but make it french

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I love that half of the men were just not wearing pants. Aside from that, this performance is more a showcase for the talent her dancers possessed.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): obviously iconic BUT madonna's voguing itself is kinda stilted at points

**seanderlust** (8): the BINOCULARS. the FANS. gonna tell my kids this was the 17th century french aristocracy.

**SmileAndTears** (8): No idea what she's trying to say with this performance

**wavingwolves** (8): yes i love theater

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The imagery and iconography of it are great but at the same time I kept waiting for her to tear off that skirt and really kick it into high gear and she never did. Also wish she’d gone a bit harder with the vocals.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): for how much this is praised as one of her best performances, I felt kinda let down? I feel like i was expecting a lot more. Maybe i’m just too used to what vogueing is nowadays that this seems very basic

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I love the production, but the choreo is so basic and doesn't match the song.

**Yatcho** (10): In a bit of a surprise Madonna is the first to leave us in this rate finishing at #3! Everything about Prayer is ICONIC, from the choir in a song basically about giving head, to the shocking (for the time) music video depicting a black Jesus-like figure and burning crosses, to the controversy surrounding the whole thing coming from the Pope himself! Nothing less than top marks for this and a great score that would have won many other rates

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): That intro still feels like one of the most monumental moments in the history of pop music, to the point that it alone seals this song as a classic. But the fact that the rest of the song is really good helps too.

---

**1998tweety** (11): one of the most iconic songs ever, there was no way I wasn't giving this my 11 (although I Wanna Dance With Somebody and So Emotional both got close). Like wow that chorus HITS especially with the choir.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I mean come on. Like a Prayer is an obvious 11 for me. This remains one of my all-time favorite songs from Madonna. There's something so spiritually enlightening about this song, yet it feels so tongue-in-cheek at the same time. The cultural context of this song makes me highly appreciate the song even more. Gosh, Madonna is truly the blueprint of the main pop girl, huh?

**Gloomy\_Purpose** (11): -a bop with amazing music video talking about showing police brutality and racism in 80s.we stan yup yup

**legendtinax** (11): the definition of iconic

**letsallpoo** (11): i feel beyond basic doing this but this really is one of the greatest songs of all time

**MrSwearword** (11): if not for Hung Up, this is Madonna's best song. It's wonderfully made music, has burning crosses in the video, cost her a Pepsi spokesperson gig, you just don't fuck with legendary stuff like this.

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): okay, i know this song is definitely not going to win, but it should! it should! this is a good song, and it's slick and sexy and dramatic. it's madonna at her best, ironically, with the blasphemy, the angelic vocals, and everything about this song is the best of mall music but also the best of music in general. the choir, the ending, the everything! madonna outsold or whatever the youths say! it's all downhill from here!

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (11): A Strong contender for one of my favourite songs of all time. I love everything about it and the way Madge started her album with a double entendre about praying and sucking dick is truly iconic. Also, the best use of background choir  in a chorus.

**vayyiqra** (11): [all emphases and redactions mine] **vayyiqra Today at 1:07 AM** yeah like a prayer is, outside the context of its video, clearly a subtly horny song about oral sex. i am not joking, it's at that weird interface of religion and sexuality that every catholic knows **vayyiqra 11/01/2020** i got into pop to a great extent thru madonna's videos ^ on tv [...] like a prayer, frozen, etc. **vayyiqra 10/22/2020** like a prayer was an EDGY video for its time **vayyiqra 10/04/2020**i only like the title track on like a prayer **vayyiqra 07/22/2020** [...] the title track is one of my favourite songs ever **vayyiqra 07/15/2020**still the title track is the only 10 on it **vayyiqra 07/06/2020** like a prayer is one of her best songs **vayyiqra 06/24/2020** no like a prayer is what perfected [religion in music] **vayyiqra 06/07/2020** like a prayer really transports to the 80s and what a moment that must have been to hear it back then **vayyiqra 06/07/2020** like a prayer one of the best songs and videos of all time *of all time* **vayyiqra 03/16/2020** in no order *running up that hill when doves cry like a prayer* [...] all contenders for [best] songs of the 80s **vayyiqra 03/10/2020** there is a long tradition of pop songs pretending to be about religion but really being about sex, the best one being like a prayer **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** my score for like a prayer is 5.6 and the only reason it's not lower is because the title track is a 10 **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** the title track is possibly her best song **vayyiqra 08/08/2019** [...] yes like a prayer is an amazing song and has an amazing video it's one of the songs that got me into pop **vayyiqra 07/13/2019** [...] "No one can pull off a religious blowjob song like Lana" nice try sweaty but like a prayer exists you know

**WillamThunderfuck** (11): I mean... it takes me to church all while she is making sexual innuendos, what more do you want?!

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like this song is one of the main reasons as to why this album is held in such high regard and it makes sense - this song is an excellent intro to the album and the video is iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): anything that incurs the wrath of Catholics, gives me that buzz!!! I live for unforgettable pop culture moments like this. Madonna's audacity truly had no bounds, queen of pop is a deserved title

**ignitethephoenix** (10): queen of making a religious sex anthem

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we do stan madonna taking this song with religious words and making it about gobbling on a cock

**joshually** (10): Every time I’m down on my knees, I make sure to take you there.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is perfect in every way, shape, and form, and it's probably Madonna's best song. Even from the very start of the track, when you hear that awesome guitar and then it just suddenly stops with a thud, you know this shit is about to be GOOD. And then from there it just gets better and better and better. So what if it's maybe about a blow job? In any other rate, this would be my 11. And if this doesn't win, I hope it goes to All Stars and wins there.

**materialqirl** (10): convinced me to become catholic(jk ofc </3)

**ReallyCreative** (10): keep scrolling if you love satan!

**runaway3212** (10): I don't want this song to win, but it is very good. The choices I have to make in this rate are unfair.

**seanderlust** (10): oh this is a BOP. i never got into madonna, but instantly i see why she has such a fanbase haha

**selegend** (10): in the top 5 songs of all time honestly

**skargardin** (10): I HEAR YOU CAAAAAAALL MY NAME

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): the pope wishes he made this BOP

**TiltControls** (10): One of her best songs! Nothing better than getting down to your knees (to pray of course)

**bulforster** (9.5): I think I'd only heard the Immaculate Collection version of this song before this rate (which would be an easy 11) so there's just a wrongness about this one for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): needs no explanation

**engifear** (9): Not this song making me cry... Also this song is great, but I do question the choice to make it nearly 6 minutes long.

**SmileAndTears** (9): I don't mind the song being almost 6 minutes but I feel like her voice isn't strong enough to make the slow build-up rewarding and it makes the beginning feel kinda unnecessary

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Madonna stans tend to attack their rate scores with veracity so I predict that this will win but that’s not an awful outcome all things considered. I saw a live version of this which featured a gospel choir (I mean this one has one but it’s kinda weak) and it kinda ruined the original for me but this has aged very well!

**waluigiest** (8): I get what this song is trying to do, and I think it’s good, but I also believe it’s exceptionally corny

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The chorus bangs, but why do the verses feel phoned in? It’s like they came up with a brilliant hook but don’t know what to do with it.

**wavingwolves** (7): i wish i liked this more than i do

**kappyko** (6): i still dont get this that much srry </3

**cremeebrulee** (5): i really dislike most religious references/narratives in songs cause i don’t think they’re as clever as they try to appear as (see my scores on the 90s vh1 rate). also on top of that, this song is hella boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): god this is boring

jackisboredtoday: # Like A Prayer

---

**Overall Average**: 7.305 **// Average Controversy:** 2.067

---

I remember when I was introduced to this album it was hailed as maybe Madonna’s best, and while its still well-regarded, it feels like opinion has shifted back towards other projects, and I can understand why. For someone who’s career was filled with so many club anthems, this felt surprisingly low on great dance numbers. Instead there’s a range of different sounds that span from a handful of great uptempo tracks and nice funk excursions to a few songs that just don’t really work for me at all. it was a necessary step in Madonna’s development as an artist and it has some of her best songs, but all-in-all this is more uneven than I would have originally guessed.

---
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9.364): I only did this rate so I could rate one of my favourite and best albums of all time, Like a Prayer. The way Madonna blends sexuality, daddy issues and her problems with faith into one cohesive work is incredible. She was one of the first female pop artists to do a concept album and she might not even have done it on purpose. I think Like a Prayer is a better album than Thrilller and one day everybody will acknowledge it, I'm just waiting for the world to catch up.

**selegend** (8.727): i binged madonna’s discography last year and i liked this album the most

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.682): Even though I am a huge Madonna stan, this is actually my first time listening to Like a Prayer in full. Wow, this album is definitely a classic and I see why this is still considered a favorite album for many of her stans. Even though it was released in 1989, this does not feel like an 80s record but rather a 90s record because this album definitely popularized some of the music trends in the 90s. This is definitely Madonna at her peak until the release of Ray of Light.

**ManofOranges** (7.818): This album is a little bit of a disappoint to me just because it starts off with Like a Prayer and Express Yourself, and it just never really reaches a high like that for me after that. To be fair, the majority of albums would suffer if they had such phenomenal tracks right at the beginning. Nonetheless, this album still has plenty to offer, Keep it Together and Pray for Spanish Eyes in particular, I think. Even my least favorite songs on the album, Love Song and Act of Contrition, have redeeming qualities. The former has prince, and the latter has the bizarrely comedic "what do you mean it's not in the computer??" What a great way to end the album by the way.

**kirby31200** (7.182): It's kind of a let down how much of this album is just fine. There's some great songs but I think the highlights aren't representative.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.009): This album had the highest highs for me, but the tracks that didn't click really just weren't that enjoyable unfortunately

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.891): this works so well as an ALBUM but when you break it down track by track some of these are stinkers

**slimboyfriend** (6.864): I can see why this album was critically acclaimed when it was released. It was Madonna's most personal album at the time, and mixed religion with feminism and familial trauma. In my opinion, this album is just okay. It could be improved with more interesting production, better vocals, and more adept lyricism. It's not bad, but Madonna has done better since.

**seanderlust** (6.627): as i mentioned in one of my comments, i understand why madonna has the fanbase she does. this is a good album! i think i like it best at its more funky side ("Keep It Together", "Like A Prayer", "Express Yourself"). This made me rethink how I view Madonna as an artist. Quality songwriting, and just...such good bops.

**SmileAndTears** (6.345): It's probably because nowadays everyone uses autotune and pitch correction to hide their vocal flaws but Madonna's vocals on this are so bad that it becomes distracting. There are a few good songs on the album but there are just way too many duds (the last few tracks are especially bad)

**bespectacIed** (6.273): Its massive first two singles overshadow the lackluster rest of the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.273): It’s no secret that I’m not the hugest Madonna fan, I’ve listened to several of her albums now for rates and I still feel like I don’t *get* it. This album basically sums up my feelings towards her, a few great hits and then a lot of dated filler. It’s not bad but next to the other two albums in this rate I just don’t see why anyone would pick to listen to this one.

**skargardin** (6.091): I used to not mind this album as much but listening to it for this rate it's just so uneven.

**fadedblue09** (6.045): Whenever people talk about this era, it’s always about Madonna’s image transition and all the controversies it stirred. So I was quite surprised to see that this turned out to be an...introspective, personal album. I liked its themes (family, relationships, religion, etc.) but the songs are sadly wasted on generic production and/or trite lyrics which hinder them from being truly intimate. Ultimately, it feels like Madonna wanted to revamp her image while delivering a confessional record, but only ended up accomplishing the former.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.882): meh album with a few standout songs

**vayyiqra** (4.636): **vayyiqra 10/04/2020** i only like the title track on like a prayer **vayyiqra 09/06/2020** [...] like a prayer is the worst out of her first four **vayyiqra 08/18/2020** i want to say maybe i should go back and reassess like a prayer but also i've done that twice already this year **vayyiqra 08/18/2020** like a prayer at the top is controversial yeah **vayyiqra 07/22/2020** i don't care for like a prayer much myself sorry i have to agree with morgan. the title track is one of my favourite songs ever, the rest is forgettable imo **vayyiqra 07/22/2020** i've been streaming true blue more lately, it's better than i remembered. i think it's much better than like a prayer **vayyiqra 07/15/2020** after talking about madonna yesterday i went back and relistened to like a virgin, true blue and like a prayer and [...] like a prayer was ... rough **vayyiqra 07/14/2020**[...] some fans really trash like a prayer it's not horrible it's just sort of okay **vayyiqra 07/14/2020** those are fairly good compared to like a prayer that album is one great song and mostly filler **vayyiqra 07/06/2020** like a prayer is one of her best songs but worst albums agreed **vayyiqra 06/29/2020** like a prayer isn't that good though **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** i just finished like a prayer and yeah [NOT GOOD] **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** my score for like a prayer is 5.6 and the only reason it's not lower is because the title track is a 10; dear jessie is a 1 **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** with like a prayer i think the production is fine i like the new wave sound but the songwriting and lyrics are bad imo that's the biggest problem; it's very cheesy yet bland **vayyiqra 😔10/09/2019** [...] like a prayer is disappointing i gave it one spin and haven't since

**Yatcho** (10): So going into this I was most unfamiliar with this album and wow does it impress right off the bat! The hook here is so catchy I kept finding myself coming back to it. I want to live in Janet’s dance military nation

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): It’s so damn impressive how this single walks the line of making a strong statement without coming off preachy in the slightest. The beats all over the album are so buoyant & bouncy, it really was the blueprint. 

---

**selegend** (11): this is her best chance at winning and it should absolutely be her first rate win

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (11): the video is a RESET QUEEN OF CHOREO

**TragicKingdom1** (11): I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG!!!!! literally flawless in every way: lyrics, production, boppability...the PINNACLE of pop music

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic

**bbfan132** (10): a fucking ANTHEM. will forever dance uncontrollably to this when i hear it

**bespectacIed** (10): The interlude to this is probably the most iconic interlude of all time. The footwork in the video, the lyrics, the black and white aesthetic, nothing short of iconic. We are a part of the rhythm nation!!!

**bulforster** (10): Jam & Lewis and Janet fucking SNAPPED on this production.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): legendary

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If it wasn't for Like a Prayer, this song would have gotten my 11. It's crazy to think that this song from 1989 is still relevant today. I just want to say thank you to Janet for making this uplifting, political bop that continues to resonate today.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): On paper a jingoistic social justice anthem with almost industrial production sounds like something that would be so off-putting and yet it’s a total bop, I don’t know how she did it!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): iconic, Janet woke queen

**joshually** (10): I almost immigrated to this nation. Thank god stupid Trump lost.

**ManofOranges** (10): I completely forgot I'd heard this song and then I hear the chorus and I'm like "oh yeah this song!" It was a very pleasant surprise.

**materialqirl** (10): mega bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she’s an icon, she’s a legend, and she IS the moment

**MrSwearword** (10): I mean let's be real, no one but JunkyGS is gonna assay this into oblivion so let's just all caps WE ARE A PART OF THE RHYTHM NATION

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): what a way to start an album. this song is just. janet, you are an actual genius who doesn't get enough credit for revolutionizing music and dance. and this song is just one example of how she changed music completely. i might be a bit drunk, but i'm not drunk enough to forget that janet fucking jackson is a living legend. learn your music history, lil babies. she's why you have a britney and then all of the people who came after britney because do you even know your brit brit history? absolute children.

**ReallyCreative** (10): just a banger from start to finish, impossible not to move to

**runaway3212** (10): Why do Americans actually say the pledge of allegiance, it makes me feel like America as a whole is just a cult, anyway this song is a masterpiece.

**seanderlust** (10): i am a member of the rhythm nation first and an american second

**skargardin** (10): name a more iconic choreo than this has!!

**wavingwolves** (10): "people of the world unite / strength in numbers we can get it right" yas let's end capitalism

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): It's kind of a cacophany, but in a good way. There's a solid rythm to it which makes it really fun and fierce!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): thinking about when In Living Color dragged Whitney for no reason with this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoBec0_f-IA

**slimboyfriend** (9): I'm officially part of the Rhythm Nation now

**waluigiest** (9): god I wanna go out dancing

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): I like the message, but the actual song is kinda just chaotic

**fadedblue09** (8): Solid dance bop, as a social consciousness anthem not so much.

**vayyiqra** (8): **vayyiqra 07/11/2020** i said the title track of rhythm nation sounds a lot like some stuff kimbra has done namely "madhouse"

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): Is it me or are her vocals burried in the mix? Idk it feels like the production is louder than Janet's singing.

**Yatcho** (11): Honestly, was there ever any doubt this would snatch my 11 and would be the winning song? All while once again smashing through the 10 point average ceiling like only she has been able to do before? Not even a little bit. Yeah it was predictable but you can’t be mad that one of the best pop songs of all time was able to achieve that

**jackisboredtoday** (10): The crown jewel of this album, and one of the greatest songs in all of history honestly. I don’t even have a lot to say beyond that this is timeless and even though the album isn’t as strong as the best material here (Janet) I'm still happy with it as a winner

---

**agentofscranton** (11): five minutes of just pure joy and euphoria. it's an obvious winner but for a good reason, it's the perfect pop song.

**bespectacIed** (11): The greatest pop song of all time

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): basic choice but i cant help it! this song is just so magical and euphoric and i have some really fond memories of this! pre-covid they would play this almost every time i would go out clubbing and everyone would RUSH to the floor the second it started. also the dj would drop the volume for parts of the chorus and EVERYONE would just sing the missing parts in unison. i really miss that sense of fun and community

**engifear** (11): It's a classic, what more can I say

**fadedblue09** (11): I mean, there is literally no other correct option.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): yeah this is the easiest 11 in a rate ever for me. One of the greatest (if not the greatest) pop song of all time

**JunkyGS** (11): This might surprise people as the resident Janet stan, but Whitney Houston was the first pop star I ever stanned and my childhood is defined as dancing to her music with my mom. This is a timeless classic! Also if this somehow loses and Janet wins it will be a win - win for me ~~so lets make sure madge doesnt win~~

**kirby31200** (11): It's hard to rate a song that feels like it's always been there. I was born over a decade after this became a pop culture staple. But honestly this song is just perfect

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Ultimate 80s Dance-Pop

**ManofOranges** (11): An utterly euphoric and iconic song. There's not a thing wrong with this song, it's absolutely amazing in every way shape and form. If you're ever in a bad mood, literally all you have to do is play this song and immediately you're living in an 80s world where you're the happiest you've ever been and just looking for somebody to dance with. 80s songs at their worst really make you realize just how long 5 minutes can be, but 80s songs at their best make you wish that those 5 minutes would never end. That's what this song does. It's the mother I never had, the sister I've always wanted. I don't know a better song. What a song, a song I will never forget. A song most pleasing to me in Whitney's career.

**ReallyCreative** (11): Bitch, me too the fuck.

**runaway3212** (11): The first gay meme I saw had to do with this song but I didn't get it at the time, because I was gay and I didn't like this song. Little did I know, I actually did like this song, I was just in denial.

**slimboyfriend** (11): A contender for the greatest song of all time. This is the only song that can bring EVERYONE together for the sole purpose of celebrating happiness. Like, this song makes me feel so happy that I want to CRY.

**SmileAndTears** (11): Everything about this song screams euphoria: the key change, the shiny synths, the stupidly fun lyrics and Whitney herself. One of the best and most iconic pop songs of all time

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I do not know a more danceable track. It is cemented in history with Dancing On My Own as songs that will always fill the dance floor at a gay bar, but also have really sad lyrics you relate to when your on your own. I frankly love longs like that.

**TiltControls** (11): Bop! And honestly one of the best pop songs of all time.

**waluigiest** (11): One of my favorite songs of all time. It’s seriously one of the best choruses of all time, and it was a beautiful part of my baby gay experience.

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic dancepop perfection, would not be mad if this won.

**bbfan132** (10): this would be a boring winner but it deserves it, an absolute classic

**bulforster** (10): This is such a predictable winner but it's so good I can't even be mad at that.

**cremeebrulee** (10): a worthy winner imo that last minute really sells it for me

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I mean, giving this classic with a score less than 10 is a fucking sin.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): ^^heat

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Spongebob flying through the air while a rainbow blast through his ass.gif

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the rate winner :heart:

**J\_Toe** (10): Love, Simon did this song so dirty (also, he didn't steam the pride flag in his room which is typical)

**kappyko** (10): duhhh

**materialqirl** (10): i play this song when i want to time travel

**MrSwearword** (10): We love quality music, yes we do.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): whitney, your legacy exists for a reason, and this song is one of those reasons. it's danceable, but also lonely and a bit sad and nostalgic, but also it makes me want to hit the streets skipping in a big dress with even bigger hair and just wail sing my way into a shopping montage.

**seanderlust** (10): I'm gagged at the full homework assignment someone pasted into the comments on genius.com for this song. they had a bibliography lmao

**skargardin** (10): when she gets another with with over 10 average >>

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): needs no introduction indeed

**wavingwolves** (10): flawless

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): If this song does not make you excited then something's wrong with you

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): a BOP

**selegend** (9): it is one of the greatest dance pop songs of all time . but i hope it doesn’t win lol

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the obvious winner because it's basically How Will I Know 2.0, and like that song I think it's a tad overrated. Please let any other top contender win thank you

**vayyiqra** (8): same :pensive:

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): Controversial (?) opinion incoming, this song is kinda corny. It’s a bop, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty cheesy, very much the peak of that iconic 80's sound, and listening to it now, it honestly feels like too much. Also for some reason it kinda reminds me of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun (a much better song imo)

# Rhythm Nation 1814

---

**Overall Average**: 8.074 **// Average Controversy:** 1.566

---

 EASILY the best album here in my opinion, this is so cohesive and also has the most interesting topics that it approaches, with plenty of political messages to go along with the relationship songs. And even more impressively, they’re all bops (ignoring the last two songs)!!! I’ve spent so much of this rate torn because the other two albums each have an undeniable classic that fans would likely rally around while this album was gonna struggle for having a huge mass of great hits to pick from. Even without the win, she gets the highest average by a mile, which matters

---
**kappyko** (9.708): diving into janet's imperial era is literally one of the most enlightening experiences you can have as a pop music listener

**ReallyCreative** (9.308): This was my first time listening to a Janet album from start to finish and I'm just impressed by how well-constructed it is. The same beat being used for virtually every song gets a little tedious, but beyond that there isn't a misstep on the entire album.

**bespectacIed** (9.083): One of the greatest albums of all time. From the visuals to the socially conscious lyrics (that kinda sound a lil liberal now lmao) to the vibrant mixing of black-created genres, Rhythm Nation is not just a masterpiece, it's a fucking statement.

**runaway3212** (8.917): I gave half of this album a 10 and I still feel like it deserves more.

**skargardin** (8.917): This album is leagues beyond the other two in this rate. If I would have any complaints it's that I wish that the ballads weren't placed all at the end but that's nitpicking on an otherwise excellent album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.733): amazing album!! and now i will be doing my janet discog deep dive yas

**kirby31200** (8.667): Definitely the best album of the rate. Honestly the best album I've heard in a while. I need to do a deep dive into the rest of her discography. My only complaint is that these are some real long songs.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.500): I had high expectations for Rhythm Nation because I was enticed by the political theme, which is why I was surprised that a huge portion of songs in the album is about romance! I think I understand why this is the case. This album gives us a glimpse of Janet's creative psyche while she was making the album. She envisioned a world that is equal and everyone loves each other regardless of race. Janet wanted to become a spokesperson of this utopia in her mind. Critics called this "color-blind" advocacy as actually a form of racism, which is why t's quite assuring that Janet addressed this criticism in a song a few decades later where she didn't want to be the poster child of "naiveness". But even then, I think Janet was already aware that she can't change the world with just one song. But rather, she wanted to bring attention to these issues through music. Janet absolutely served that purpose because we have to keep in mind that she is a Black woman wanting to tackle politics in pop music in the late 80s. It's quite a huge risk and it paid off really well. With this album, Janet was able to marry romance and politics perfectly without coming off cringey. I want to thank /u/JunkyGS for that wonderful retrospective post on the album. It helped me appreciate the album even more!

**TiltControls** (8.417): Strongest album of the rate by far. Kind of dips in quality near the end, but otherwise it's filled with bop after bop.

**SmileAndTears** (8.367): I definitely like the second half more. I was a bit worried listening to this because I thought the first few tracks were kinda meh but the album progressively got better. It's probably the most consistently good album on this rate but it doesn't have a song as good as I Wanna Dance With Somebody.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.158): queen of being socially conscious

**RandomHypnotica** (8.008): Definitely the most consistently high quality album here, every song is really solid, it's thematically consistent, and it just works really well (Also we LOVE an artist that makes the interludes seperate, skippable tracks!!!)

**slimboyfriend** (7.833): This album has everything. It's got politics, love, hope, desperation, interludes, ballads, bops, and a Van Halen song. Even when the lyrics border on general cheese, the songs are quintessential 80s pop perfection.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.833): This was my first time listening to this album and Janet Jackson in general. It's a good album, I'm just not sure Janet is for me though. There were plenty of songs on the album where I was like "yeah this is great" while listening, but very few of them got stuck in my brain or left a lasting impression after the song finished. Most of the songs have a very similar beat, leaving the differentiating up to the lyrics and let's be honest, she isn't exactly Bob Dylan here. Stand-out songs were easily Rythm Nation and Black Cat, and I wish it had kept this level of quality throughout. I really enjoyed Escapade and Lonely as well.

**bulforster** (7.792): This album is really good but a tad overrated imo. It still easily blows these other two out of the water.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.750): Glad I got the chance to revisit this one! It’s a Janet album that I usually gloss over because the harsh production and dark themes make it a bit daunting to listen to but the songs on it are great and I rediscovered some gems. One of Janet’s biggest weaknesses as an artist is that she creates these huge, ambitious concepts for her albums and then ends up abandoning them in favor of just being a hoe halfway through, almost comically so on this one, but she sounds so damn good doing it that I don’t really mind.

**ManofOranges** (7.750): I wasn't thinking I'd enjoy this album as much as I did. While I don't think it's perfect (how many albums are perfect, honestly?), it's still got a bunch of great things going for it. In fact, I'm currently waiting for my application of citizenship to the Rhythm Nation to be accepted as we speak.

**fadedblue09** (7.417): I must say, I’m pretty surprised how much I liked this record. Its blend of swing, industrial and dance-pop give the album a unique sound, and the interludes just make the transitions seamless. That being said, I’m hesitant to call it a perfect record. Its attempts at being socio-political fail because the songwriting is too basic and surface-level to capture any sense of urgency. Thankfully, it doesn’t dwell on that for too much, and Miss Janet easily switches to dance-diva mode, which is IMO where she shines best.

**seanderlust** (7.408): social justice...but make it dance. this is a fun one! I think there's something so distinctive about the drum track in eighties Janet. this album threads the needle fairly well in being pretty woke without coming off as too preachy. i think it does this by throwing in a few songs like "Alright" to show that it doesn't take itself too seriously. anyways, not sure how to apply for citizenship to the rhythm nation, but I am interested for sure.

**waluigiest** (7.250): This was a confusing album for me. I felt like it had a decently strong concept, but it didn’t fully commit? Which just makes the points where she fully went into the world feel cringey in a way. There are still some bops tho.

**vayyiqra** (7.250): this album is so fucking based

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Honestly, your stanning of Janet is one of the reasons why I want to discover Janet's gorgeous discography. I was lucky to listen to Control and The Velvet Rope because both of them were part of rates and both were excellent albums. When Rhythm Nation is part of the rate, I knew I have to participate aside from the fact that Madonna is also part of the rate.

I think RN is definitely my favorite album from Janet because it feels so cohesive and I really love how she managed to mix politics and marriage in the album. Thank you so much and I miss you, king!

# Whitney

---

**Overall Average**: 7.068 **// Average Controversy:** 1.661

---

 Whitney’s never really been seen as an albums artist, and this is easily the project here that feels the most like just a collection of songs. The key detail though: that Whitney sings the everloving fuck out of almost all of these songs. There are a few too many ballads that felt relatively interchangeable, but the highlights here are extremely high

---
**bespectacIed** (9.636): I went to this rate thinking Rhythm Nation will be my no-brainer top album, but I forgot janet's second best album is up against whitney's greatest album, a skipless masterpiece. Whitney is a slap in the face to those who say she is just a singles artist. Granted 6/11 of this album were singles lol, but this album is such a concise, focused album that is literally skipless I know I already said that but goddamnit i am obsessed w/ this album

**SmileAndTears** (8.118): This album has some atrociously bad lyrics and you can tell this was written by men who thought girls were all dumb princesses in need of a prince charming. That being said, Whitney is a powerful and extremely emotional singer and her presence is enough to make up for all the embarrassing lyrics. I miss her so much

**fadedblue09** (8.091): For some reason, this album ended up getting my highest average. Idk, maybe Miss Whitney’s voice is just that powerful that it elevates the songs here from being the generic cheesiness they are. It may be relatively unambitious and straightforward compared to the other 2, but IMO that’s what makes it easier to appreciate, as it doesn’t try too hard and ultimately, it accomplishes its simple goals.

**seanderlust** (7.836): so my 7.7 is an odd rating to give it because it's an average of my scores. when this album is at its peak, it is some of the best pop music of the decade, if not of all time. balancing out those songs though is the filler in-between solid tracks. don't @ me, but if this was a 6-track EP I would love it a lot more.

**ManofOranges** (7.818): I was expecting this album to be a lot worse because apparently Whitney doesn't have the best album cuts, but like... I really enjoyed this. Obviously the singles are all pretty good at least, and then there's a few other knockouts hidden within the album too.

**kirby31200** (7.545): High highs and mediocre lows. How much you like this album depends on your ballad tolerance level

**TiltControls** (7.364): The filler songs aren't bad per se, just extremely dull. Still at least the singles shine through as some of the best of her career.

**selegend** (7.182): a lot of generic ballads

**RandomHypnotica** (7.136): I didn't actively dislike any of the songs here, but none of them really were that standout to me, and overall I found the album to be pretty standard/safe throughout

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.091): Wow so Whitney is… not quite an album artist, is she? She’s one of the most iconic voices in pop and has tons of hits to her name but I’m consistently thoroughly *whelmed* by her deep cuts. Ordinarily I’d say this was just a product of the time she was releasing in but Janet being in this rate kinda demolishes that excuse, I think Whitney and her team knew what she was here for and just kinda phoned in the rest. Not a bad album but if anyone asks me about it I’ll just tell them to listen to the singles.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.818): I always saw her as an singles artist as I remember trying to get into her discography when I was younger and thinking all the album cuts were fillers. It went a little better this time around and several album cuts surprised me, but I still think it's the weakest album in this rate. I love a good "bad girl" album and Whitney has never been anything but a good girl. The first half had great songs on it, but I can't really get emotionally invested in them because of that. Ironically, So Emotional is my favourite song on the album.

**slimboyfriend** (6.409): I know my score on this album looks incredibly average, but if I saw Whitney sing ANY of these lives I know I would scream so loud I'd lose my voice.

**skargardin** (6.364): The bops are definitely career highlights but the ballads all meld together into a mediocre mess that even her soaring vocals can't help. This album basically has the same problems that her debut had for me.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.136): I love Whitney but this just ain’t it. None of the songs are bad, they’re just boring.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.136): queen of great singles and mediocre album cuts. im betting most of this gets chopped (deservedly) day 1 and then she'll swoop in with the win

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.345): MEH

**vayyiqra** (5.182): this album was ok i guess

TiltControls: Updated [Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=434672506)! What a powerful rate!

**Songs**

- I Wanna Dance With Somebody (#2), Rhythm Nation (#32), Like A Prayer (#63), Black Cat (#94) all enter the top 100 song leaderboard! The level of talent shines through! Many rates can't get up here with a single song let alone 4!

- I Wanna Dance With Somebody also lands on the leaderboards for most 11's (#9 at 21), highest percent of 11s given (#7 at 34.4%) and highest low score (#6 at 7.3)

- (Dis?)honourable mention to Act of Contrition which sits as the 21st most controversial song we've rated (#18 if excluding bonuses)

**Artists**

- Madonna is now in the top 5 for most songs rated (#5 at 82) and in the top 10 for most rate appearances (#9 at 13)
- Janet Jackson also makes an appearance in the top 20 for most songs rated (#18 at 46)
- ~~Also unexpectedly Prince falls in averages from 9th to 15th due to one crummy placement as feature. Lets see if he'll make up some ground the December rate~~

Thanks to the hosts! It was a great rate!

kappyko: technically Prince isn’t an official feature 🥺👉👈

TiltControls: Usually I just copy the list provided in the rate post, but true that he's not an official feature...

Eh he gets a pass for this then! If all of the people who were ~~probably threatened to be~~ features on 🌎 can avoid that blemish it's only fair (also cause trying to track down unlisted features for every song is way too much for me lol)

HeyHiHello365: I didn't participate in this rate (cuz I'm dumb) but Rhythm Nation is not the best song on that album, Miss You Much was fucking robbed.
