joshually: has this ever happened before - where an album had no exits in the first day??

TiltControls: Nope! Pretty sure this is the first one. Some EPs have in EP rates (having fewer songs makes it a bit easier), but never an album. A few have come really close, but Janet's talent has really broken through here!!

\---

\*\*jackisboredtoday\*\* (6.7): The final song on this album is one of two songs at the end that make up the closest thing this album has to a weak stretch. This is fine but its way less fun and way less memorable compared to everything that came before. A fair first exit for Janet

\*\*Yatcho\*\* (6): Janet finally loses a song and I dont think anyone will be sad to see this go, it ends a really fun album on a sleepy note tacking on another 6 minutes to the last two slow songs. Compared to the last two ballads it doesn‚Äôt quite hit that sensual, groovy rhythm that they get into while also failing to reach the lyrical power of the earlier ballads that pushed the social message of the album

\---

\*\*bulforster\*\* (11): Best sax in the rate and I looove the callbacks to Let's Wait A While and the foreshadowing of her next album's sexuality.

\*\*deleted4eva\*\* (11): Don't let your eyes deceive you.

\*\*joshually\*\* (10): That FRANCH she coos in the song, and the way she‚Äôs like ‚Äústop‚Ä¶ come on tee hee‚Äù in the end‚Ä¶. Lord jesus

\*\*skargardin\*\* (10): what an amazing closer

\*\*cloudbustingmp3\*\* (9.5): precursor to the horny janet that would fully manifest later on

\*\*GloriaBellVEVO\\\_\*\* (9.5): I miss being sexually active

\*\*runaway3212\*\* (9.5): listeningto this while at the same time listening to Mariah's someday is in fact not fun.

\*\*DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy\*\* (9): Ah yes, I just witnessed the birth of sexy Janet. This is just oozing sexiness.

\*\*Ghost-Quartet\*\* (9): Gonna have to add this one to my sexy times playlist, this is such a vibe! Love that Janet has multiple songs in her discography where she simulates an orgasm, glad she‚Äôs being taken care of.

\*\*kappyko\*\* (9): it is literally so disgusting how some janet albums are sequenced why did she put three ballads in a row at the end that all get progressively LONGER

\*\*kirby31200\*\* (9): Sensual and Dreamy. Ends the album on a great note.

\*\*the\\\_k\\\_nine\\\_2\*\* (9): love the jazz influences but the moaning outro i-

\*\*bespectacIed\*\* (8): cute but the B2B2B ballad closers were a bit much...

\*\*plvstvcbvrds\*\* (8): a good slow song, a solid closer, and very sexy and ugh god quarantine is doing things to me because whew i had to take a break after this one.

\*\*MoonlightByWindow\*\* (7.9): the sax at the end of this is godly

\*\*1998tweety\*\* (7.5): the best of the ballads cause of the sax(?) outro

\*\*bbfan132\*\* (7.5): a cute closer but i wish it stood out a bit more

\*\*ignitethephoenix\*\* (7.5): the breathing at the end was unnecessary but this was decent

\*\*ReallyCreative\*\* (7.5): it's a good song but I would not choose this as the closer, it just doesn't feel like the right note to end this amazing album on

\*\*SmileAndTears\*\* (7.5): Eh. It's pleasant

\*\*ImADudeDuh\*\* (7): she said ‚ÄúFUCK ME‚Äù and relatable queen

\*\*ManofOranges\*\* (7): Kinda sexy.

\*\*materialqirl\*\* (7): i like to ignore this song LOL, but its alright still i guess

\*\*slimboyfriend\*\* (6): This sounds exactly like the last song, but with a slightly more interesting instrumental.

\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (6): the moaning is a bit much for me but this is still good

\*\*seanderlust\*\* (5.2): this one is just a bit boring. the best part is honestly the opening monologue.

\*\*fadedblue09\*\* (4.5): And the album unfortunately ends on a predictable note with a stretch of 3 ballads. Also, the trumpet solo (which is normally a redeeming point) was not very good.

\*\*MrSwearword\*\* (1): I'm sorry this is a horrid closer and another bad ballad, I refuse.

**Yatcho** (8.5): A really lovely ballad with a gutpunch ending, shocking how relevant this still is. I suppose it doesn‚Äôt fit in sonically with most of the album‚Äôs fun new jack swing but I think it really is the crux of the social message of this album and I‚Äôm sad to see it go out this early

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): I like the lyrical message here well enough, and I don‚Äôt wanna come off as anti-ballad since the song is fine, but the sound of big message ballads from the 80s just hasn‚Äôt aged well in my opinion, & that holds this back from greatness. This still feels too early to lose it though, and for that I regret not giving it a higher score.

---

**RandomHypnotica** (11): a song that feels more and more relevant every day, it's really powerful, moving and sounds gorgeous too! The lyrics are succinct but powerful, I love it so much (btw I absolutely know this is going to be robbed and I'm already fuming!!!)

**kirby31200** (10): Boy does this resonate today. This is great lyrically, it sounds beautiful, the vocals are fantastic, and it has a great message.

**runaway3212** (10): This is a masterful song

**wavingwolves** (10): i love how impactful and straightfoward the ending of this song is

**materialqirl** (9.5): good message

**bbfan132** (9): i think that this song is just as important and telling 30 years later - these lyrics could easily be applied to what is going on now around the world

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I love the song's message here and it still holds true today.

**kappyko** (9): listenin to a song (u shouldnt have made). actually this is gorgeous why

**skargardin** (9): she better sing

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): in a rate filled with mediocre ballads, it's nice to have something a little elevated

**fadedblue09** (8.5): This is nice! IMO, the album‚Äôs socio-political themes are better addressed in ballads like this.

**MrSwearword** (8): I can forgive the heavy-handed preaching here if only for the lyrics "The people we learn from, forge the ideas we become."

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): not in love with this, but that might be the champagne and the switch in tone between this song and the last talking. the chorus does go off, though.

**slimboyfriend** (7): I congratulate Janet on making a song about children that I don't hate. Anti-boomer anthem!

**1998tweety** (6.5): bored

**ManofOranges** (6): OMG THE ENDING. I was not expecting that at all Jesus Christ. Pretty damn depressing.

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (6): the gunshot sounds um

**bulforster** (5.5): Janet's lyrics alone can't carry such basic ballad production.

**bespectacIed** (5): this is highkey exploitative omfg????

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Forgot that this was on while it was playing until I heard children screaming.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): kinda boring and a bit preachy imo

**waluigiest** (4): omfg not the school shooting news clip wtf

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.1): powerful idea but sloppily executed

**seanderlust** (2): this feels too "we are the world"

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): She kinda doesn‚Äôt do anything but her voice is so electric that it doesn‚Äôt even matter‚Ä¶. her voice when she sings the word ‚Äúburns‚Äù heading into the second chorus is everything

**Yatcho** (8): Whitney‚Äôs little shimmy here is the definition of ‚Äúgo girl, give us nothing!‚Äù but she is so charismatic she sells it. And can you believe her voice ona  live production?? Greatest of all time

---

**astrologicalangel** (10): I knew Whitney's voice was powerful, but this was insane

**bbfan132** (10): whitney was such a good performer‚Ä¶ rip üòî

**bespectacIed** (10): to quote ajayii, MOVE SALINA MOVE. Jk she's just standing and shimmying but she sounded perfect, who cares

**ManofOranges** (10): Maybe Whitney doesn't have the most extravagant cheorography here (or any) but listen to her voice!! Few people have had, currently have, or will ever have a voice as good as Whitney's.

**materialqirl** (10): THE FACT THAT THIS AS LIVE

**skargardin** (10): iconery

**wavingwolves** (10): magnetic

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Yes, I gave my highest score to someone who just stood there the whole time. What about it?

**kirby31200** (9): Choreo's cool but live vocals are always cooler

**seanderlust** (9): i feel like saying "what a voice" about whitney is cliche at this point, but jesus christ what a voice.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): effortless vocals but i could use something more

**CritneySpearz** (8): ok this song slaps but watching this after Madonna and Janet‚Äôs iconic performances makes this performance‚Ä¶ unimpressive

**slimboyfriend** (8): She is ebullient!

**waluigiest** (8): GOAT vocalist

**ImADudeDuh** (7): her vocals are so good

**vayyiqra** (7): this is cute :uwu:

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): She‚Äôs undeniably a legend but also she‚Äôs just standing there and singing. Like I don‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs having a good time.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): tbh this is the stiffest performance of any song with "Dance" in the title I have ever seen

**Yatcho** (8.7): This is quite nice as well, brings back the strength to her voice that was missing on some of the more generic ballads we already heard. Makes me think maybe this album wont end too badly‚Ä¶ maybe

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): I want to like this song more than I actually do, but the production is just so gloopy and saccharine in a way that just doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ its only a decent song because Whitney can sing it like nobody else can

---

**bespectacIed** (10): My favorite anecdote about Whitney (album) is than when the 4th single Where Do Broken Hearts Go went number 1, it gave Whitney her SEVENTH consecutive number 1 single, a record that hasn't been broken since, probably never will be. Fucking legendary. P.S. if there are pinoys reading this yasss that thing called tadhana is an excellent film

**joshually** (10): I sang this song at a show in college‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm just a not-good enough singer that it‚Äôs not entertainingly bad, but firmly in the cringe/terrible/wtf category. Where were my friends? Why did no one stop me?

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i mean it's a good song, and that key change, and the chorus, and god it's just so good. i have had so much champagne.

**TiltControls** (10): Underrated Whitney ballad. Would have probably gotten my 11 if I Wanna Dance didn't exist

**1998tweety** (9): shes cute

**fadedblue09** (9): Karaoke staple.

**SmileAndTears** (8.2): Bop

**bbfan132** (7.5): the one ballad that kind of works here, i enjoyed the atmosphere and her vocals were great as per usual - it‚Äôs still kind of by-the-numbers though

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is so weird for me because the guy who wrote this song, Frank Wildhorn, is a pretty famous theatre composer? His shows are all pretty bad but the music in them is always actually pretty good so I was like ‚Äúhe should have just been a pop writer‚Äù and it turns out he was? The songs in his shows still sound just like this but they tend to be better, stream ‚ÄúAll This Time‚Äù instead.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): A decent ballad! Finally!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): eh she has better ballads

**kirby31200** (7): A mostly fine ballad saved by an amazing performance, which is admittedly a given for her

**MrSwearword** (7): at least it's above par

**seanderlust** (7): "where do broken hearts go" sounds like a plot point in kingdom hearts

**ManofOranges** (6): I don't know!

**skargardin** (5): im running out of yawn related comments to make

**wavingwolves** (4): one direction outsold sorry whitney

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): one direction outsold

**Yatcho** (9): Whitney‚Äôs next cut of day 2, and wow would you believe it‚Äôs another power ballad?? However it‚Äôs easily the best ballad of the bunch, Whitney‚Äôs voice knocks my wig off with how powerful it is here. Really sells the frontloaded nature of this album compared to the back half of undercooked ballads. It‚Äôs a shame this isn‚Äôt remembered as much as her 90‚Äôs power ballads

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): if this were sung by anyone else the production would kill any chance at it being a good song, but Whitney can just belt in ways nobody else could

---

**bespectacIed** (10): it's meant to mimic her past power ballads hits, but who cares when the result is always as good as this??? We will never hear a voice as good as whitney's :(

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm sorry, it's just oh so beautiful. Oh how ridiculous.

**materialqirl** (10): one of my fave whitney songs <3

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Sounds like the twin sister of All at Once

**seanderlust** (9.3): THIS is how you do a ballad

**1998tweety** (9): a ballad but a great ballad

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Ahhh, the memories this song gives me on car trips with my parents

**kirby31200** (9): Beautiful. The slightly less good but still great sibling of I Will Always Love You

**SmileAndTears** (9): it's literally Nobody Loves Me Like You Do 2.0 I- the melodies are almost identical

**astrologicalangel** (8): just a little too repetitive

**ImADudeDuh** (8): her vocals make this good

**joshually** (8): I feel like this song is about the apocalypse‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDidn't we almost have it all? When love was all we had worth giving? The ride with you was worth the fall my friend‚Äù

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): a power ballad, don‚Äôt really feel anything about it tho

**kappyko** (7.5): gonna be a day 1 even tho its an absolute tune

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i love the strings in this

**MrSwearword** (7): boring ballads but great singing get above average marks

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): god her voice is amazing but what is this song? it's very pageant talent portion but like, a ribbon routine with some weird racist undertones

**waluigiest** (7): It‚Äôs got good ideas and some good peaks and valleys, but it‚Äôs cheesy and it feels so long

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): This feels a bit too "formualic ballad" to me?

**ReallyCreative** (6): not to be balladphobic but there are literally dozens of songs that sound exactly like this and I just don't think this is the best one. It kinda drags towards the end.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): repetitive

**bbfan132** (5): excellent vocals but this is the dullest ac track ever

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is very transparently filler but her voice on the second half saved it.

**skargardin** (5): another mediocre ballad with soaring vocals, how nice

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (4): same complaint

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): skip!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): Janet‚Äôs main stab into the adult contemporary market after an album of mostly uptempo dance tracks, this was a success as a single but its neither the most energetic or the most emotionally affecting material on the album

**Yatcho** (7): It‚Äôs bit of a bore but does sound nice, however the placement on the album is unfortunate as it follows the extremely similar Lonely and starts to create a 10 minute mega-slow jam, which isn‚Äôt great for the pacing of the album. Honestly should‚Äôve been the closer

---

**materialqirl** (10): my FAVORITE janet ballad, i get obsessed with it every november or so

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is always going to remind me of long car rides to go visit family, and it would come on the radio, always after if you think you're lonely now, and we'd be on the back roads of some sundown town in the middle of georgia, and ugh. sleeping in the back of my parent's SUV with my sister crammed in next to me trying to get some sleep just. so many memories.

**runaway3212** (10): this is really great

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): I sing this at karaoke so much sob emoji

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): my spiritual pussy blossomed when the intro ended and Janet whispered ‚Äúcome,‚Äù this is so sexy Janet!

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Another great ballad

**bespectacIed** (9): i prefer this over lonely, whatta heavenly ballad

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): oddly enough the lone ballad single is the weakest of the trio of them at the end. still very good tho

**bbfan132** (8): probably one of my least favorite tracks but the atmosphere is still beautiful

**wavingwolves** (8): me @ my life before the pandemic

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): nice but drags on a little too much

**kappyko** (7.5): this ones too long

**1998tweety** (7): bored [2]

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Again, a little too long and I don't think the song really "peaks".

**cremeebrulee** (6): i‚Äôm bored (for the first time while listening to this album)

**waluigiest** (6): essential 80s ballad but boring

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://i.redd.it/pdb0x1s6tsh01.jpg

**ManofOranges** (5): Sorry to say that I got bored with this one.

**MrSwearword** (5): her vocals are dulcet and emotive, but my god, who was using Janet for balladry before either the janet. or Velvet Rope albums (Every Time sucks so we don't count that)

**Yatcho** (9): The iconic cone bra just had to make an appearance on a list of era defining performances! The stage production is just insane especially for the time I can‚Äôt imagine how much the gays were living for a show like this back in the day and really I‚Äôm not surprised how committed a fanbase she still has for tours after seeing something like this

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): (IMO) the best Madonna performance in the bonus rate. The fact that this is the only one from an actual tour really shows compared to these TV performances

---

**bbfan132** (10): the choreography, the set, the outfits, the music‚Ä¶ she did that

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): I really just made up my mind that the minute Madonna tours again i'll 100% get in debt to see her omg. Also there is NO WAY Julia Garner won't be Madge in the biopic

**J\_Toe** (10): I always forget the nude cone-bra corset is paired with black pants. The two don't go well together, and most cone-bra iconography crops her off at the hips anyway.

**ManofOranges** (10): It's the cone bra so of course this is iconic.

**materialqirl** (10): the whole tour was such a high point of her career tbh

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): ICONIC OPENER FOR AN ICONIC TOUR

**wavingwolves** (10): the outfit + the choreo is a yes for me

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): the hair. the bra.

**slimboyfriend** (9): I might just be a slut for the cinematography & editing, but the energy in this performance is unmatched.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): engaging with a great aesthetic!

**waluigiest** (9): the looks in this performance are immaculate

**kirby31200** (8): Step on me Madonna

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Nobody but Kylie should be allowed to shout ‚Äúdo you believe in love‚Äù but she kinda snapped with the vocals.

**vayyiqra** (7): not this song again but this performance is better it's kind of cool [+1 for iconic cone bustier]

**ImADudeDuh** (6.9): Awh. Awh.

**skargardin** (6): i mean it's fine

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I have uhh, mixed feeling about the dancers on this one

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): Unlike most of the slower songs in this rate, the production here has aged really well, this sounds like such a nice quiet storm jam that makes for maybe the strongest deep cut on an album where more than half the tracklist became hit singles.

**Yatcho** (7): RN1814 shifts gears here into a very sensual r&b groove in stark difference to the rest of the upbeat new jack swing of the earlier singles and the high energy rock of Black Cat just before it. Low key one of the best instrumentals on the album, it take sa few listens to notice.

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): just beautiful

**kappyko** (10): this is on the same tier as the best dance pop songs here imo

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): an underrated ballad with great as per usual production

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): this is gonna get robbed but its so soothing

**materialqirl** (9.5): i need to listen to this more xx

**ReallyCreative** (9): this kinda eats the other girls album cuts up

**runaway3212** (9): "happiness is hard to buy" no it's not it's called canned whip cream and it both makes you happy and makes you die faster, because of how unhealthy it is. the perfect duo.

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): Good

**ImADudeDuh** (8.6): i can perfectly imagine listening to this while laying on a lounge chair in my honeymoon suite draped in a pink robe i‚Äôve had adorned with lighter pink ostrich feathers while my butler who is in a sexual relationship with me brings me grapes.

**bbfan132** (8.5): such a pretty song, maybe it‚Äôs a bit less interesting than the other tracks but it still works

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): This is really chill but I appreciate it, it hits just right

**ManofOranges** (8): Me every day.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): if there is anything janet can give us, it's a good song about being lonely and wanting some dick and or love in your life.

**waluigiest** (8): essential 80s ballad

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I mixed this up with ‚ÄúI Get So Lonely‚Äù from *The Velvet Rope* and I think I like that better. This is nice though, I love me a smooth and sexy r&b jam

**1998tweety** (7): bored

**kirby31200** (7): Pleasant but didn't quite make an impression on me

**seanderlust** (6.7): i'm so sorry but the opening to this song reminds me of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf9lmKQOKZg

**fadedblue09** (6): It goes on for too long and the lyrics are a little corny.

**joshually** (6): Unmemorable, like all my 2020 Pre-Covid hook ups.

**wavingwolves** (6): lovely

**MrSwearword** (4): it's such a comedown from the last few tracks but again, some of the lyrics save it from outright derision

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): even though it‚Äôs a single I feel like this is gonna get hurt by popheads‚Äô balladphobia... and y‚Äôknow what? that‚Äôs okay, this is mediocre and kinda boring (adding this after I saw the scores: y'all really let this get this high?? the ONE time your balladphobia could be used for good and you didn't do it? smh)

**Yatcho** (4): The album cut ballads on this really fail entirely on production and vocal delivery, Madonna is trying to do something on these with her voice it can‚Äôt do, and the flat production doesn‚Äôt help at all. I think there‚Äôs something there lyrically but I hate her voice on this so much I don't want to listen actively enough to find out what it is

---

**bbfan132** (10): harrowing yet beautiful, easily one of my favorite madonna songs

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna be a day 2 cut because these f-words dont deserve rights but its BEAUTIFUL

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I have a very dysfunctional relationship with my father so this song really hits heavy to me.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This song is gorgeous and painful and the video is a masterpiece. (I might like the Sia cover a liiiiiiiittle bit better tho)

**joshually** (10): OK the sadness in her voice is palpable

**MrSwearword** (10): oh so this is what Fighter by Xtina would sound like as a ballad. I almost underscored this but thought, "nah, I'll full mark it"

**cremeebrulee** (9): I‚Äôm not gonna lie ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ i am usually balladphobic but i do like this

**ImADudeDuh** (9): me starting this song - Oh is this another sex jam? Me listening to this song - oh.

**runaway3212** (9): I love that she's able to forgive him, personally would not, but good for her.

**skargardin** (9): she kinda snapped here

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (9): a great autobiographical track, with a great video to match

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): Such a gorgeous song, the only downside is that you can kind of hear that Madonna's vocal range is slightly limited compared to other famous singers in my opinion

**kirby31200** (8): Very well written, but I am not a huge fan of the vocal performance

**ManofOranges** (8): A pretty good one, kinda depressing though!

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**SmileAndTears** (6.8): Madonna copying Gaga's Chromatica II/911 transition smh. On a more serious note though, her vocals are BAD on this one

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): relatable lyrics so raising the score

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): i love the religious daddy issues imagery but ehhhhh my love only goes so far

**vayyiqra** (6): [the duality of man]: **vayyiqra 11/10/2019** oh father is bad **vayyiqra 07/15/2020** oh father is good

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Yeah whatever I have daddy issues too

**fadedblue09** (4): For a song whose subject matter hits close to home, I feel NOTHING. And that's a shame.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): imagine making a song that sounds like this and still releasing it. she sounds like she smoked six packs while recording this. where is the melody?

**wavingwolves** (2): oof

**Yatcho** (8): Had a strong initial impact on me but I think it‚Äôs a little understated for this album, kind of sacrifices a strong hook and beat for the social message of the album. Which is fine! But does make for a weaker song in the context of the whole album

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): Suddenly Janet justified the decision to go to college just as I was wondering if I made a mistake picking this school instead of Barbz U‚Ä¶ Thanks queen

---

**bbfan132** (10): this production is wild, love this

**kappyko** (10): why does she start this song singing "poo"

**materialqirl** (10): what tr*mp supporters need<3

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): incredible production and very danceable

**bespectacIed** (9): still dunno wtf the knowledge is???

**joshually** (9): The rap in this song is so fierce

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): the vibes are immaculate

**seanderlust** (9): "prejudice......no." you heard it here first.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i know its sorta controversial but i love how on-the-nose the "Prejudice? No!" bridge is sdfsgdsdf

**ManofOranges** (8): Pretty good, I think!

**runaway3212** (8): They really said 'no <3' to all big world problems

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): when Janet Jackson sees something problematic: no <3

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): at this point the songs / theme is feeling kind of like a parody

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright

**kirby31200** (7): Kinda sounds like a TV PSA commercial tbh

**MrSwearword** (7): it doesn't go anywhere until you hear "Prejudice NO, Ignorance NO, Bigotry NO, Illiteracy NO" which fascinates me to see the commitment in basically tying illiteracy to the other awful things mentioned in that part.

**skargardin** (7): bop

**slimboyfriend** (7): Her producers really liked Prince didn't they

**wavingwolves** (7): not too sure about the message of "education is the only way to social equality" (because it's not! we don't even have equality in education!) but this is a banger still

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (6): If you just focus on the production, this song is a BOP, but then you hear the lyrics and while  Miss Janet is 100000000% right and she should say it, it really sounds very silly. Dare I say this is what y'all think Boys Will Be Boys sounds like‚Ä¶.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the lyrics of ‚ÄúPrejudice: no. Ignorance: no. Bigotry: no. Illiteracy: no‚Äù is absolutely SENDING me

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): The weakest song on the album to me. The beat is very muddy and the lyrics basic.

**waluigiest** (6): prejudice? No!

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): i dont know her

**fadedblue09** (4): Kinda forgettable tbh, also the lyrics are too basic and on the nose for its subject matter.

**sandyfishnets** (2): three songs into the album and I'm really annoyed at how all the beats so far sound the same... like come on... I know it was probably new technology at the time but we get that you can make a beat out of glass shattering... yawn

**Yatcho** (7.8): Funky almost new jack swing, pretty good but when Janet is also on this rate its comparing cute to gorgeous and you know, gorgeous is always going to devour cute

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): I love the beat to this, its so funky and sounds like good classic new jack swing to me. I‚Äôm not sure Madonna‚Äôs voice is the best fit for this tbh, but it all comes together pretty well in the end

---

**ManofOranges** (10): Me to myself whenever I was about to have a breakdown about a guy I liked. I also find it funny that I like the song about keeping family together, when I'm gay and part of family is super conservative. That's not happening! I know this sub can relate.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song makes me want to walk down the rough streets of new york in the 80s before i bump into a guy who yells at me but softens when he sees that i'm crying because i am just a small town boy who doesn't know what i'm doing and lives in an apartment with seven drag queens who gave me a makeover so that i would stop standing out so much but i just feel more out of place, and did i mention that he's the son of a preacher who left to become a activist and ugh some gay get on this movie idea asap

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): the funk instrumental is so catchy

**bespectacIed** (9): i like this, sounds like something Paula Abdul would release

**cremeebrulee** (9): this production bangs but i took a point off because i don‚Äôt like that its about family lol

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): funky

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this one grew on me a lot on repeat listens

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the funky production. Some lyrics are meh but otherwise the message is well-delivered.

**MrSwearword** (8): great production but the entire thing just reads as "dated even by 1989 standards"

**runaway3212** (8): Blood is thicker than water is so pre 20th century

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (7): fun but kind of one-note, still pretty good though

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This song loses one point for me because I feel like the lyrics aged badly in the present. Anyone who is a huge Madonna stan knows that she pretty much cut-off ties with her siblings. Still, I think giving this bop lesser than a 7 would be a crime because this is such a bop nonetheless.

**kirby31200** (7): I find it a little weird she followed a song about family issues and abuse with a song about the importance of family. Very funky though

**joshually** (6): This song has never been one of my faves

**wavingwolves** (5.5): this is both fine and a little annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): love that we did a rate with three black women <3

**kappyko** (5): i was excited for an upbeat cut but this ones boring

**Yatcho** (10): Watching her pull of this insanely hard choreo completely effortlessly... *Tiffany Pollard voice* just look at the material, you can be the judge of it

**jackisboredtoday** (9): The Rhythm Nation outfit is such a serve & I LOVE when someone goes for a consistent image across an era like this performance

---

**bbfan132** (10): i wish i could‚Äôve gone to this tour if i was alive (i know this isn‚Äôt from the tour but still‚Ä¶) her performances are iconic, i love janet so much

**bespectacIed** (10): the dance is so iconic

**J\_Toe** (10): I honestly think Janet is the best dancer of any main pop girl

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm a big fan of the dancing with this one. I'm enjoying myself!

**materialqirl** (10): i mean- this is literally perfect, the choreo at the other girls UP

**ReallyCreative** (10): THE CHOREO

**skargardin** (10): the choreo alone is so excellent

**ImADudeDuh** (9): overrun my government QUEEN!

**waluigiest** (9): AMAZING style

**wavingwolves** (9): must be a good workout

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I hope this is what the police state is like!

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): Me doing the Leonardo DiCaprio meme seeing that she's wearing the outfit from the album art!!!! Also I HATED the shots of the crowd, I really hope it's the lack of video quality because they all looked so stiff

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Stage feels a little cheap, but otherwise a decent performance.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I don't care if she didn't sing a word of this live; this choreo is so cool

**seanderlust** (7.3): who is peter?

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (7): there's no bad performance of this song

**Yatcho** (8.5): Very cute 80‚Äôs pop dentist office-core, hasn‚Äôt aged particularly well but for what it is I‚Äôm honestly surprised how high on our rankings it landed. Kind of telling no one could really write more than a sentence or two on it in the comments

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): a nice toe-tapping song, but kinda forgettable by Madonna‚Äôs standards. a little bit surprised this one was a big single at the time

---

**CreepyMannequin** (11): One of my all-time favourite songs. Just absolutely gorgeous. I want this played at my wedding.

**bbfan132** (10): the happiest song i‚Äôve ever heard

**bulforster** (10): It's actually impressive how well she pulls off such a cutesy song.

**fadedblue09** (10): I'm gonna be generous to her for this one. Even though it goes on for too long, it's the song I enjoyed the most.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This slaps! I gave this a ten after the first ninety seconds and for once Madonna actually kept my attention until the end of the track.

**materialqirl** (10): literally her best song ever point blank period.

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): the outro!!!! love the production and background vocals

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): The third best song after Like a Prayer and Express Yourself.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): cute but not a fav

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this just makes me happy

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is cute

**kappyko** (8.5): i only found out this was a hit when i was doing a sporcle quiz today where you had to unscramble madonna hits and i had to ask my dad what this one was

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Cute bop

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): Such an uplifting song :)

**ManofOranges** (8): I remember in middle school there was this one girl in one of my classes named Cherish and she was pretty weird.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): the chorus y'all.

**selegend** (7): a simple bop

**skargardin** (7): boppy!

**slimboyfriend** (7): Great song to hear on Target's in-store playlist while I'm shopping for lube

**wavingwolves** (7): well this is okay but i don't cherish that much

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): This was alright at first, but got really repetitive, and by the time it finished I kinda hated it

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): This one just overstays its welcome

**runaway3212** (6.5): I find this a tad annoying tbh

**seanderlust** (6.5): "romeo and juliet never felt this way I bet" yeah cuz they died, madonna

**bespectacIed** (6): preppy

**kirby31200** (6): Perky and cheesy in a way I find a little grating

**MrSwearword** (5): useless at large but it's one of the more buoyant and ebullient moments to Madonna's name

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): eh

**jackisboredtoday** (9.3): One of the best deep cuts of Madonna‚Äôs entire career, this one is feels so propulsive & catchy while still getting at the disintegrating marriage between her & Sean Penn. Easily the only song from Madonna I'm genuinely mad to see going this soon

**Yatcho** (9): So I had never heard this song before this rate and Im shocked this was never a single, its really catchy for a deep cut and the production hits the perfect balance of high energy and 80 wackiness. Was really pulling for a top 10 finish for this but it‚Äôs a very good placement nonetheless

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is a top 5 song of her career idc idc idc

**kirby31200** (10): Sounds great and is very emotional and real. Fuck Sean Penn.

**materialqirl** (10): the way this is probably about sean-

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's just a good song. that's all. i just like it and it's a good song and i don't have to explain myself or why this song made me want to put on the most glittery eyeshadow and cry at the same time while burning pictures of my ex.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I absolutely adore this, the vivid imagery, the really vulnerable depiction of her abusive relationship, all backed by a surprisingly funky synth line is so catchy and the half-spoken post-chorus is sooooo gooood

**runaway3212** (10): I really fucking love this song, I don't know why god it's so great.

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): <plate breaking sound> despair emoji

**bbfan132** (9): i love the production here, i kind of forgot about this song but i‚Äôll be listening to it more often now

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): For such a joyful beat, the lyrics are actually dark as it's about a toxic relationship that Madonna had to endure with Sean Penn. You can definitely hear the passive-aggressive tone from Madonna here.

**selegend** (9): she snapped here

**SmileAndTears** (9): I love the melody

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): The production is a tad too busy, but still amazing.

**wavingwolves** (9): oh this is quite fun and enjoyable, especially in comparison with the rest of the album

**kappyko** (8.5): okay this is really sweet and pretty.

**J\_Toe** (8): favourite non-single on the album

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): surprisingly very good

**MrSwearword** (8): aww, this is spritely and cute

**waluigiest** (8): perfect crying at the club music

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.9): Fuck Sean Penn

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I guess this is the song that touches on her divorce. Sad that it's wasted on such generic production.

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute but kinda drags on

**ManofOranges** (7): It's a nice one.

**bulforster** (5): Too frantic.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This instrumental sounds like a royalty free beat I‚Äôd hear in the background of a crafting video, and omg why is this so long???

**seanderlust** (5): i wasn't paying attention for like half this song. that might be because i'm rating this while awaiting election results tho

**ImADudeDuh** (4): that riff that opens the song. What the fuck is that? It sounds like music from a super nintendo port of Frogger.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): shoo-be-doo-be-do

---

**bbfan132** (10): 6 minutes of dance perfection

**bespectacIed** (10): pop perfection holy shit

**materialqirl** (10): [insert the vid of wendy williams listening and dancing here]

**MrSwearword** (10): only a few seconds and I fuck with this track

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is just. the vibes, the dancing, the amount of cleaning but also pregaming i've done to this song is just. it fits for all occasions. the ad libs are also a moment.

**runaway3212** (10): absolutely fantastic

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): amazing new jack swing production

**ReallyCreative** (9.9): this would be a 10 if that little high pitched scream didn't play every 2 seconds, the WARMTH of the vocals, the pure serotonin jesus christ

**J\_Toe** (9): sounds more like her 93 album

**kirby31200** (9): Shoo-be-do-be-doop-do-wah

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a little long but the outro is gold

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): it's... alright... But it goes on for WAY too long

**fadedblue09** (7): It's a bit long and missing a climax, but otherwise it's fun.

**SmileAndTears** (7): It's alright

**ImADudeDuh** (6): another too long song

**bulforster** (5.5): This is fine I guess but I have no idea why it's longer than every other song on the album.

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is alright.

**joshually** (4): I never liked this song‚Ä¶ from the first time I Heard it until now

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): That screaming in the background is so annoying, is this the original ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt let anybody speak and instead?‚Äù Janet is usually better at making her songs justify their runtime but this one fails to.
