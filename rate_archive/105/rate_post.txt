Late 80 Ladies Rate (Madonna, Janet, Whitney)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/j3wu47/late_80_ladies_rate_madonna_janet_whitney/

Since 2020 remains the ultimate mess that it has been all year, we're taking it back to the past again for this month's rate. Back to the time of big hair, shoulder pads, and pop girls who could actually sing and dance! This month, together with my co-host /u/jackisboredtoday ,we will be rating 3 seminal albums by the biggest stars of the decade.

Notably, these are all women in the mid stages of their career and arguably all at the peak of their power and success. This is the start of the headline grabbing, controversy spinning Madonna that would come to define the next 15 years of her career. Janet cements her status as a hitmaker outside of her brother's shadow with 7 top 5 hits from one album. Whitney also continues an unprecedented hot streak of success while delivering timeless pop classic with her legendary voice.

Scores are due 11th November by the end of the night. If you want a 24 extension to submit please PM me

##[Madonna- Like A Prayer](https://www.longlivevinyl.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/d7f8331cf8e21256395086a8addccfda-768x768.jpg)

First up is the original queen of pop herself, continuing her 80s hot streak with her 4th hit album in a row and basically creating the blueprint for pop superstardom for all your faves. This time Madonna continued to one up herself by really focusing on the visual and performance aspect of her music. she courted controversy with lead single "Like a Prayer", which immediately drew condemnation from religious leaders for its use of religious imagery, this controversy storm got so bad even the Vatican piped in and she had sponsors and performances of the tour pulled.  Nonetheless this is probably the most important addition to her legacy, a Madonna that didnt court controversy and headlines just would not be the same artist we know today. Other hit songs from this era include eternal BOP and david Fincher directed "Express Yourself", "Cherish", and "Keep It Together", which all hit the top 10. She capped off the era with the groundbreaking Blonde Ambition tour, immortalized in the successful Truth or Dare film, which we will be looking at in the bonus rate section

##[Janet Jackson- Rhythm Nation 1814](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/91/Janet_Jackson_Rhythm_Nation_1814.png)

Coming to you live from the small but extremely decidated contingent of Janet stans on this sub is guest speaker /u/junkygs ! This is from their excellent [30th Anniversary Retrospective post](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/d691f2/in_honor_of_janet_jacksons_rhythm_nation_1814s/?ref=share&ref_source=link), a must read for stans and those unfamiliar with Janet alike.

>Following the incredible commercial & critical success of Janet Jackson's last album Control (which produced multiple multi-platinum singles and sold over 10,000,000 copies worldwide) Janet Jackson had a lot to live up to and faced immense pressure from her label. Her label demanded she create a "Control II", along with rumors that the label heavily encouraged her to exploit her family's drama by centering the album's content around that.

>They wanted her to take a back seat like many female pop stars at the time and let others control the lyrical content and sound of her next album. At the young age of 22 Janet Jackson decided to not only not listen to the immense pressure put on her by her label by demanding to be able to take an even more active role in song writing & producing, but also saying she wanted to create a concept album addressing social issues such as racism, poverty, drug abuse, news media and overall social justice.
>
This album was created over a 7 month period with super producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis denying any label executive to come to these sessions in fear of them pressuring Janet to shift the focus of the album or songs. Janet Jackson is the co-producer of every song on the entire record, along with writing every song besides 5. The name of the album "Rhythm Nation 1814" refers to Janet wanting to fight for a world with "no color lines" and the 1814 having the double meaning of 1814 being the year the United States national anthem "The Star-Spangled Banner" was written along with "R" being the 18th letter in the alphabet and "N" being the the 14th letter in the alphabet aka Rhythm Nation.

Janet also pioneered the visual album with the [Rhythm Nation short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF-0w90WTJY), a highly suggested watch

##[Whitney Houston- Whitney](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Whitney_Houston_-_Whitney_%28album%29.jpg)

Coming off the white-hot momentum of her self-titled debut album “Whitney Houston,” the newly minted superstar took the last name out of the title for her second album and released “Whitney,” another album of pure 80s pop which only strengthened her dominance. The album followed up her debut by continuing to mix her longing ballads with bright 80s synthpop, and during the “Whitney” album cycle, Houston found unprecedented levels of success, becoming the first album EVER by a female artist to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 as well as four consecutive Hot 100 #1 singles, part of a run of 7 consecutive #1 singles stretching between her first two albums that to this day is the longest streak of consecutive #1s for any artist in history. The singles themselves run the gamut from dancefloor anthems that still play at clubs to this day such as “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” and “So Emotional” to power ballads like “Where Do Broken Hearts Go” which remind you of Whitney’s unmatched vocal abilities and even standout deep cuts like “Love Is a Contact Sport” among the handful of songs that didn’t become singles.

Tracklist:

1. [I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH3giaIzONA)

3. Love Will Save The Day

##Bonus Rate

This part is an additional, completely optional rate just for fun. You can rate some or all of the tracks, no 11 or 0s, and no minimum scores per artist.

A hugely important part of this era of artists were the groundbreaking, memorable, straight up iconic live performances they delivered. We will be rating a selection of live performances from each lady in the rate from award shows, tours, and opening ceremonies. You can base your score on whatever you want, it is the bonus rate after all, but generally try to base your rating in the the performance aspect, including choreography, vocals, staging, costuming, etc, and not just the song

##The Rules

* Rate every song with a score between 1 and 10. You may also give one song each, either an 11 or a 0. For your 11 / 0 to count, please leave a comment with the song (the formatting for which can be found below).
* Rate every song with a score between 1 and 10. You may give one song a ZERO, and one song an ELEVEN. As great as the live performances are, you cannot give your 0 or 11 to bonus rate songs. You may only use up to one decimal place in your scores, any more will crash the program (so 5.7 is allowed, 5.73 is not).
* You MUST rank every song on every album in the main rate if you want your ballot to be counted. You cannot leave any main rate songs blank. The deadline for ballots is not until mid-November, so feel free to take your time and listen to the songs and albums as many times as you like!
* Be sure to use the prepared link to send in your scores. It is important that ballots are correctly organized so scores can easily be recorded.
* If you need to change scores for any songs after submitting, feel free to DM us with the songs whose scores you wish to change and their new scores.
* Sabotage is not allowed, and we reserve the right to question you on your scores if your scores seem suspiciously/over-the-top low or over-the-top high.
* To add comments to either a song or album, do the following:
Where Do Broken Hearts Go: 10 One Direction is shaking right now
Album: Like a Prayer: Like the sound of an angel (i don’t fucking know how to be clever with these)
* The following formats, and any formats besides what is written above, are INCORRECT, and should NOT BE USED.
Black Cat: 5 - Wishing bad luck on every other artist in this rate once they come across black cat
Where Do Broken Hearts Go: I know I’m going elsewhere after I heard this 5
Love Is a Contact Sport: (5) I’m gay what is a sport again??
