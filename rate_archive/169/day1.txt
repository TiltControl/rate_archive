---

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I‚Äôve been debating on whether to rate this honestly as a song, or unseriously And I have chosen to rate this unseriously because if you can‚Äôt tell, this is clearly a joke take from Bieber that is akin to Kanye doing Swoop De Poop, Poopity Scoop or Doja doing trash man. I kind of wish it was a bit longer and he went full tilt chaos, but this will still do just fine

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): i unfortunately find justin bieber very attractive

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i simply love increasing the controversy on things

**GarciaSynthesizer** (10): Don't let this song distract you from the fact that Bieber put out an EP where he raps Bible verses over stock beats

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is the pussy of the rate

**jay** (10): he sounds like a stereotypical nerdy geek in tv shows hxjebdkebdkebd its kinda killing me

**mysario** (10): shout out to this being one of Justin's last solo songs released, if he stopped releasing today then what a way to go out

**ricki** (10): im also a pisces

**wailord\_fan** (10): kinda iconic

**WaneManToc** (10): this is such strong Karl Havoc vibes. he totally doesn't want to be around anymore

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I don't know sure maybe perhaps could be

**akanewasright** (5.5): I feel like by having an opinion on this song, you lose

**DirtyRat583** (5): funny weird....

**Frajer** (4): making Yummy sound like an 11 in comparison

**jackisboredtoday** (4): does anyone remember that there was another single immediately after this one?

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Wait this was a real officially released track??? I thought this was a ‚Äúhe loves alcohol more than this poosay‚Äù-esque outtake

**aldwin\_is\_here** (2): this is absolutely dogshit.

**pig-serpent** (2): I am here for this era of single song bonus rates, and at least this is still better than Malibu.

**moonshxne** (1.5): üòë (My justification for this very score, is, well...in my personal scoring scheme, everything from 0-5 I definitively feel negatively about. Applying recursion to this half of the domain, I gave up and gave this a score right smack in the middle. It's like...too unserious to give a 1, y'know?) edit: oh god why did I relisten, this gets a point docked off for my terrible decisions

**1998tweety** (1): this isn't even camp please don't call it that

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better than Harry‚Äôs House but y‚Äôknow

**alanadelreyy** (1): lol

**cremeebrulee** (1): i thought about giving it a camp 10 for the pisces line but

**CrimsonROSET** (1): eclectic art pop promo

**DaHumanTorch** (1): i still cannot believe this is real

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): Justin Bieber is letting the March Pisces team down, and I won‚Äôt stand for this because some of my best friends are March Pisces and I won‚Äôt let their good star sign - birth month combo be besmirched!!!

**dreamingpastel** (1): Is this a joke? No, seriously, is this a joke? Am I getting Punk'd? Is that even Justin singing? Literally what the hell is this???

**dropthehammer11** (1): grrr

**eldritchdeergod** (1): I know this supposed to be a joke song it's not funny. should be glad my 0 had to go to jim carrey

**flava** (1): I want to be camp and give this a 10 but then I heard Justin Bieber‚Äôs feature in CR&B and I just can‚Äôt

**frogaranaman** (1): lmao

**IIIHenryIII** (1): he‚Äôs such a mastermind for releasing a song titled I Feel Funny that makes you feel like throwing up

**impla77** (1): wtf is going on

**indie\_fan\_** (1): bruh

**lexiaredery** (1): It's either a 1 or a 10 - I'm going with 1

**Nagisoid** (1): Emily montes genuinely has better lyrics, delivery and beat and I don't fucking know how.

**nt96** (1): this is what happens when you let conventionally attractive people think they‚Äôre fun

**seanderlust** (1): :/ is like..is he doing a bit?

**shipperondeck** (1): wait this was on the tick tock !! i love justin beavers

**slimboyfriend** (1): good justification that men shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to make music

**static\_int\_husp** (1): why. why does this exist.

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (1): sure

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): the amount of carly i will now have to stream to get my spotify back to the way i want it after this rate... ugh

**throwaway-7650** (1): I've never hated having the same sign as someone else before

**TiltControls** (1): thanks to tk and yetti for making sure 10/10 girls like you is no longer the lowest rated bonus track

**vayyiqra** (1): Very funny to have a bonus rate of exactly one (1) song that also sucks! Good prank, hosties, nice bit. Rock on.

**welcome2thejam** (1): Rate crime. Go directly to rate jail.

**xavieryes** (1): not funny

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Contrary to popular belief in, um, certain circles, this song is about himself and not Louis Tomlinson!!! Secondly, this song I think is overhated, but it is kind of boring and doesn‚Äôt really make much of an impact., and definitely has a baity quality to it. Nothing against acoustic ballads, but when most the album does not have acoustic ballads, this song just is a sleeper (the lyrics don‚Äôt help its case either). This was dead last the entire time of rating and it seems like people unanimously agree it‚Äôs not really good or one of the worse on the album.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): I really don't dislike Harry as a public figure as most on this subreddit do but yeah the lyrics here are SO focus grouped it's impossible to ignore. This would be a fine guitar ballad but I have to deduct points for the whole "am i right ladies?" vibe.

---

**IIIHenryIII** (9): and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm straight

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): I regret to inform everyone that this song clicked for me 48 hours before the rate was due and Now i like it

**eldritchdeergod** (8): he knew what he was doing with this one and honestly ... i'm all for it

**Frajer** (8): this doesn't not sound like nice guy bs

**1998tweety** (7): this title is clickbait

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): is this a friendzone anthem??????

**WaneManToc** (6): again...do we REALLY need this kind of instrumental with these lyrics? lethargic shit. but fortunately...i just cracked open a cold one!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.2): HaRrY iS A QuEeRbAiTeR!!!1111

**AHSWeeknd** (5): oh he‚Äôs not like her other boyfriends

**dropthehammer11** (5): snore song bait title

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Can all the people who said this was gonna be a gay song stand up please? I just wanna talk

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Harry made Matilda and was like ‚Äúwait that ballad wasn‚Äôt boring enough, let‚Äôs try making it again‚Äù

**bulforster** (4): he is not a good enough lyricist for these acoustic numbers

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): That lil reversed intro though? dnim sih ,hgU

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (4): doesn't do anything for me

**beeozan** (3): Rare case of Selena Gomez outselling. get it, rare lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): He says that men are trash yet his album is participating in the MEN‚ÄôS Ultimate Rate‚Ä¶curious.

**bluehxrizon** (3): This song is a good example of how what harry does isn't really queerbaiting but more just extreme pandering to his target demo. he purposely makes things ambiguous and lets the fans run with it so they can project whatever wishes they have about his identity onto him

**cremeebrulee** (3): he dont got a single song reason where he need to be doing this

**ImADudeDuh** (3): im gonna call him a slur

**passionfruits2** (3): Alex, I'll take "things Harry Styles has never had" for 400 !

**pig-serpent** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7zTvC5yjjE

**RandomHypnotica** (3): you knew what you were doing Harry

**seanderlust** (3): i hear that backwards vocal clip mister harold you will NEVER be hikaru utada bitch!!!!

**shipperondeck** (3): we're back to boring i guess.. u need really profound lyrics to have just your voice and a guitar bro

**Ambrosia42** (2): kind of a snooze

**babadork** (2): I don‚Äôt get the point of this song.

**DaHumanTorch** (2): like a lot of this album this song is just so nothing. no interesting melodie's or lyrics or production choices. just bland all around, offensively so

**impla77** (2): This is both boring and nice guy core

**jay** (2): nothing burger pt 2

**throwaway-7650** (2): shawn mendes - treat you better ass song

**vayyiqra** (2): This could have maybe been a good song, and yet it was this dull. üè†

**moonshxne** (1.5): somehow transcended snoozefest territory enough to come off as condesending

**Awkward\_King** (1): gay

**flava** (1): I‚Äôd say this the worst thing i‚Äôve heard from a member of One Direction if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve heard Nobody is Listening

**Nagisoid** (1): Is it just me or most pop songs with boyfriend in the title are guaranteed to be cursed? This one, the one by Selena Gomez, the one by Ariana Grande... what's going on?

**Poydoo** (1): I am literally having a seizure right now

**Stryxen** (1): ‚Ä¶

**xavieryes** (1): this sounds like a watered-down sertanejo raiz song (yes that's derogatory)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (0): ‚ÄúHarry, stop making the next Treat You Better!‚Äù Dumbledore said calmy.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): https://youtu.be/j-01cO73qRU?t=146

**DirtyRat583** (0): hey i found why the other ballad didnt get a 0

**hikk** (0): WDGAF

**letsallpoo** (0): he is unbearable

**oscarbrierley1** (0): the reverse at the beginning throws me off. the lyrics are a no, it gives pick me energy. the rest of the song is just boring.

**slimboyfriend** (0): yeah but I‚Äôd rather be listening to like taylor swift or phoebe Bridgers say it instead of the boyfriend in question

**ignitethephoenix** (6): his narration is great and makes a great closer to this album, but I cannot in good conscience score this higher than most tracks here.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): first day out but I‚Äôm crying

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): Jim Carrey outsold the Weekend, yass JC!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes this little spoken word number is better than several actual songs on the album. Sorry about it!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): Sorry I was a religious studies minor and my favorite class a class about the construction of evil, or another talking about how Catholicism especially Byzantine overlaps with the Orthodox influenced Warhol‚Äôs art (especially his portraits). I have a lot of fun with this stuff

**Poydoo** (10): I have no comments, this absolutely floored me

**throwaway-7650** (10): he ate why lie

**TiltControls** (10): normally i'm an interlude tanker but this is a perfect way to close out the album

**WaneManToc** (10): they were really in woke cooking mode by getting Jim Carey to come in and just take a giant shit for kicks. THIS is what pop excellency looks like

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): this is going out immediately but tbh i was sold by the time we got to "divine boogaloo"

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Good outro. Great way to end the album.

**seanderlust** (7.5): yes it's just jim carrey reading a poem but i really like it okay!

**Awkward\_King** (7): jim carey feels like an actor who would be cancelled if anyone took him seriously or like engaged with him critically but he is self aware enough to know that so keeps being silly and keeps his career. deserved an oscar for truman show though tbf

**DirtyRat583** (7): god is speaking here will you accept his word ‚ùì

**jay** (7): lemme throw it back in text to speech

**vayyiqra** (7): This is surely tagged "atmospheric" on RYM. üìª

**welcome2thejam** (7): What character do you imagine Jim is during this song? The Riddler? Ace Ventura? Robotnik in full Sonic 2 garb?

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): the jim carrey feature, ariana's childhood crush, after i heard you're married oh he's down BAD

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Still better than whatever the fuck Danny Phantom‚Äôs final episode was

**hikk** (6): wdgaf

**ImADudeDuh** (6): remember when Jim Carrey was beefing with the grand daughter of benito moussolini

**plastichaxan** (6): I don‚Äôt know how to rate these

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): don‚Äôt know what to do with this so take a 5

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): had a nice comment for this one because I thought Jim was his uncle. Turns out it‚Äôs Jim Carey and I have lost my sympathy

**impla77** (5): Its giving Dr Seuss.. which I guess is appropriate?

**Ambrosia42** (4): more scene setting

**shipperondeck** (4): when you weren't LIKED or FOLLOWED okay we get it jim

**1998tweety** (3): MEH

**Nagisoid** (3): Jim maybe hasn't considered the fact that Heaven is a place on Earth and God is a woman.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This is some Scientology shit

**CrimsonROSET** (2): I do know why the caged bird sings

**dreamingpastel** (2): Does this count as a reference to the "Ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd" meme that, without fail, makes the rounds on Twitter every Friday?

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (2): i preferred him in the grinch

**akanewasright** (1): who let him cook

**cremeebrulee** (1): girl wdgaf

**IIIHenryIII** (1): fuck this, I want music

**oscarbrierley1** (1): too damn long for an interlude.

**pig-serpent** (1): "When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave" ok boomer

**Stryxen** (1): be quiet Jim. I have never in my life yelled at a girl like this

**beeozan** (0): we wanted Phantom Regret by Rina Sawayama ft. Eurythmics

**bulforster** (0): not this improv edgelord dr seuss reading

**eldritchdeergod** (0): boo!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (0): the only good thing jim carrey have ever touched is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

**frogaranaman** (0): shut the fuck upppp bro

**RandomHypnotica** (0): Fuck. Jim. Carrey.

---

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): okay I know there a lot of lines on this album that can be ragged on but "a wet dream just dangling" has to be up there. Anyways I always appreciate a heavily reverbed ballad from Harry-- it's no Cherry but still provides for a good comedown from the cheesy earnestness of the preceding songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this one is definitely one of my least favourites on the album. For a song called little freak, it‚Äôs kind of boring and feels very fillery on a short album. The chorus is nice but this is still a skip for me.

---

**flava** (10): Harry Styles has a very narrow lane of sweet and sentimental songs that are also horny and I‚Äôd wish he keep to it more often

**frogaranaman** (10): wow this one is suddenly hitting

**throwaway-7650** (10): coldplay-core

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): that‚Äôs not a very nice thing to call u/cremeebrulee

**1998tweety** (9): his troye sivan serve

**AHSWeeknd** (9): honestly I feel like Taylor Swift would deliver this better

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (9): i love this song but not giving it a 10 bc i don't want it to win

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Okay NOT AT ALL what I was expecting based the title but yeah this is nice.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): where‚Äôs the freak? sounds so dreamy

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I was gonna talk about how I really like these kinds of songs and povs until the yoga line

**Frajer** (7): bopping his face with a newspaper like when a dog acts up

**jackisboredtoday** (7): hated this on first listen but it actually grew on me a little

**jay** (7): snooza but a cute one

**seanderlust** (7): i really like these lyrics tbh

**eldritchdeergod** (6.9): this one i'll admit gets a little too deep into cringe but i still enjoy it melodically speaking

**nt96** (6.5): who tf asks if you dressed up for Halloween?

**akanewasright** (6): this is cute [never listens again]

**bulforster** (6): best of the slower cuts here bc he's not just left to fend for himself by the production, still not anything amazing though

**Stryxen** (6): unable to remember a single thing about this song every time it finishes

**WaneManToc** (6): is this a rip off of coldplay? is this a tribute? why would this cut be 20% better with Chris Martin helping on harmonies.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I think I was about to give a 6 and go but then I immediately forgot this song the moment it ended LOL

**beeozan** (5): I imagine this is what Jacob Collier haters hear in Jacob Collier songs (I have not heard a single Jacob Collier song besides Good Days)

**dropthehammer11** (5): i really dont like harry getting sexy

**pig-serpent** (5): I really like it when Harry harmonizes with himself. I really dislike everything else!

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): the paradox of harry styles is that his music is devoid of perspective and personality and then when he tries to give himself a pov through slow songwriter-y guitar songs, it comes off as boring and I am completely uninterested.

**impla77** (4.4): I don‚Äôt mind the chorus, but the verse (especially the lyrics) suck

**CrimsonROSET** (4): he would name a ballad ‚Äòlittle freak‚Äô

**Roxieloxie** (4): every harry album has a shittty ballad and this album is no different

**vayyiqra** (4): So these lyrics I gather are roughly what most of Popheads but me thought the lyrics on Midnights were like, huh. üè†

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): It takes an immense amount of straight man skill to make something this horny sound so aesthetic

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): yes sir

**aldwin\_is\_here** (3): it reminds me of Imagine Dragons, not my thing.

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): I‚Äôll take ‚Äúleast sexy song in this rate‚Äù for 100 Alex

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Usher‚Äôs ‚ÄúLil Freak‚Äù remains superior and unbothered

**shipperondeck** (3): sonically gentler than what you'd think for a song called "little freak" but unfortunately this title and some of the lyrics got me wincing.

**wailord\_fan** (3): ew don‚Äôt use wet dream in a song

**moonshxne** (2.5): go Harry give us nothing

**oscarbrierley1** (2): him saying little freak makes me uncomfortable idc. the rest of the song gives campfire

**Ambrosia42** (1): not really doing anything for me idk

**passionfruits2** (1): the reverb (i think) he put on the vocals on this song is insanely terrible

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): why was harry dating the sentient version of a 2013 tumblr it-girl on this

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this song gave me the ick

**Nagisoid** (0): I thought this song was going to be about Little Monsters but it managed to have even worse lyrics than a song actually about that topic. Feels really pandering and dishonest, and can anyone name anything interesting about the instrumental?

**Poydoo** (0): "A wet dream, just dangling"

**ignitethephoenix** (6): well this interlude wasn‚Äôt removed because this album is so inter joined and it would be weird to remove a single interlude, but yeah this is just Quincy Jones just talking about his life and how he was raised without a solid mother figure affected his future love life. I do like the introspection but like it‚Äôs obviously not a highlight in this rate.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): first out but legend Quincy Jones deserves better

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this will get robbed and for what. need a census to see how many popheads even know who quincy jones is smh

**mysario** (10): ayo is that Quincy Jones from 'Austin Powers in Goldmember'

**throwaway-7650** (10): abel really said if you can't beat 'em (being MJ), join 'em

**vayyiqra** (10): This story comes out of nowhere in the album but it's quite sad (side note "dementia praecox" is not in fact a kind of dementia, it's an old term for schizophrenia; years spent on psychology degree coming in handy here). I feel weird even rating this as a true story, so I'll give it a 10 because it was short but it moved me. üìª

**WaneManToc** (10): I'm still trying to figure out why this is here. It's touching and maybe finally like gives a level of humanity to the current iteration of the weeknd project. but i can't be the only person listening to this and going "wouldn't it be funny if someone made an edit and swapped all the spoken word moments on A Seat at the Table with the Dawn FM ones. would they be interchangable?"

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): it is sooo good as an interlude.

**Frajer** (8): I wonder if Rashida has heard this

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Thanks Quincy(?)

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): Not much to rate here but also strongly feel like Abel is both very self aware of his problems and not.

**flava** (7): Abel taking notes from one of the albums in the other March rate

**jackisboredtoday** (7): its a nice expansion on some of the album‚Äôs themes but its obviously leaving early bc its not meant to be heard in any context beyond an interstitial on the album

**nt96** (7): omg a lost Heaux tale??

**pig-serpent** (7): This feels like a rejected interlude from There Existed an Addiction to Blood or Visions of Bodies Being Burned

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Love the instrumental soundscape on this one. Quincy's voice here reminds me of my grandpa (hope you're doin' well in heaven buddy)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Quincy fucking Jones????

**Poydoo** (6.5): Probably the worst interlude on the album, but it's still better than anything on Harry's House

**akanewasright** (6): I did debate in high school, and for the first month or two of my junior year, there was a kid named Quincy who would sometimes show up. Instead of doing research with the team or doing a scrimmage debate, he‚Äôd try and fight people about why gun control is bad or why we needed to build a wall or something, and he‚Äôd always use the most insane points possible before leaving 30 minutes early. The team got him to do a scrimmage debate on the month‚Äôs debate topic one time, which the debate coach judged, and Quincy left right after that. The coach gave his feedback, and gave his notes to the debate team to look over while he took care of something else. We looked over the paper, looked over his notes, and saw in the middle of the page ‚Äúwho brought Quincy‚Äù 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad Abel brought Quincy

**DirtyRat583** (6): good score for the buildup into out of time

**shipperondeck** (5.5): i find this enjoyable for an interlude tbh

**Ambrosia42** (5): Quincy Jones‚Äôs tale ties into the lyrics of the next song and such and it sounds fine, but I don‚Äôt necessarily need this song

**beeozan** (5): abel prepping us for confessional r&b how nice of him

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is a nice interlude on its own but it feels so out of place in the context of the album.

**DaHumanTorch** (5): girl why are we rating this

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I don‚Äôt think this is the sort of thing I can rate on a numerical scale

**hikk** (5): wdgaf

**ImADudeDuh** (5): misogyny origin story?

**impla77** (5): okay..

**jsonphile** (5): interludephobia

**moonshxne** (5): üßçüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**plastichaxan** (5): Kinda set up but I won‚Äôt help this one dsjlfdfsk

**RandomHypnotica** (5): it‚Äôs not jim carrey

**Roxieloxie** (5): the bonus rate should've been every unhinged thing that Quincy jones said in that one interview a few years ago

**slimboyfriend** (5): I expected another story about how horny and gay Marlon Brando was but this is cool too

**Stryxen** (5): sure !

**apatel27** (4): why are the interludes in again?

**Awkward\_King** (4): girl this shit sad as fuck i didnt ask for this????

**bulforster** (4): Jazmine I think you dropped something in the wrong march rate

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): k

**seanderlust** (3.5): sorry i truly do not understand why this is here

**jay** (3): girl lemme sit down

**Nagisoid** (3): Where's Lorde when you need someone to shush

**eldritchdeergod** (2.1): i do not like talking interludes it's the same reason i don't listen to podcasts

**CrimsonROSET** (2): :person_standing:

**oscarbrierley1** (2): the story is so dark, with elevator music in the background. its so much

**dreamingpastel** (1): what

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (1): i truly don't care for these spoken interludes i don't listen to music to listen to people talk that's what a podcast is for

**1998tweety** (0): no1curr

**Poydoo** (10): INTENSE, GRAPHIC, SEXY, EUPHORIC, PROVOCATIVE, EDGY, THOUGHT-PROVOKING, TECHNICALLY AND VISUALLY STUNNING. A COMPELLING WORK OF SCIENCE FICTION.

**Stryxen** (10): this slays ?

**throwaway-7650** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not refere- oops wrong copypasta

**WaneManToc** (10): It's wild that for his b-side he has to spend 4 tracks twiddling with his thumbs until finally OPN gives him a pretty solid synth to run with here as the song turns into an OPN cut bordering on self-parody he forgot to put on his last album. like what the fuck is this doing here (complimentary)? this is some orange milk or holly hendron shit. it shouldn't be on a major pop album, but OPN is REALLY trying to milk it so brilliantly god I fucking love it

**nt96** (9): me after I saw the biblically accurate angels video

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): an interlude that should've been an actual song, but it is funny.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Lady Gaga video but put it on the Freestyle Hip-Hop Dance Instructor video

**DirtyRat583** (8): 1 800 4444 4444 4 44 4 4 4 44 4 4 4

**hikk** (8): wdgaf but the synths slayyyyy

**welcome2thejam** (8): Deserves to beat interludephobia

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): that ‚Äúyourself‚Äù in the title track is becoming real important right now since this definitely isn‚Äôt commercial free anymore

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Guaranteed popheads will hate this radio shtick even though it‚Äôs not like‚Ä¶ the worst thing ever?

**celladonn** (7): the build up here is so cool i wish it was a proper song instead of a fake commercial

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): the way he‚Äôs talking here makes me uncomfortable but also Biblically Accurate Song. Also curious why the phone number changes

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song is kinda serving https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6wlntGepW4

**vayyiqra** (7): "Biblically accurate" something Evangelion reference idk. Good retro bit; makes me think of Weather Forecast [Asutenki], this RYM-core producer who makes signalwave music with samples of old Japanese TV broadcasts. üìª

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Is this an ad break?? Yeah, it's an ad break. The whole radio station theme throughout this album is genius.

**seanderlust** (6.5): i love the concept behind this one tbh

**cremeebrulee** (6.1): abbreviates to EAIT which is not exactly EAT because he didn‚Äôt fully eat on this

**Awkward\_King** (6): i genuinely have no fucking clue what this song is but its better than a lot of songs here!!!

**DaHumanTorch** (6): i don't know what to give this, we love a concept or whatever

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): me the week Charli XCX tweeted that hyperpop was dead:

**Frajer** (6): Charlie's Angels are only terrifying if you're Sam Rockwell

**jasannn** (6): capitalism?

**ricki** (6): this club has everything

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I have too many wildly different comments I want to leave here so I'm just gonna list all of them: 1) The "ahh" part sounds like Can't You See Me 2) How does the Weeknd manage to simultaneously pull off some of the raunchiest lyrics in pop while also talking with the voice of an elementary schooler 3) Hitman fashion show-ass ad music 4) Eva reference

**babadork** (5.9): My completely arbitrary opinion is that fake radio is cool and fake infomercials have been done.

**Roxieloxie** (5.5): ill just go to hell thanks

**shipperondeck** (5.1): what if you wanted to hear the most ascendent song ever, but god said Wanna Break From The Ads

**1998tweety** (5): filler

**apatel27** (5): It works in the album

**bluehxrizon** (5): I can't say i've heard an infomercial in a song before

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): terrifying is right

**pig-serpent** (5): generic synthwave sounds Rich deep colors Unreal Engine render Symmetry Centered Highly detailed Intricate Artstation Digital Art By Greg Rutkowski

**indie\_fan\_** (4.4): okay you leaning a bit too much on the whole radio concept abel

**Ambrosia42** (4): this song is a bit terrifying‚Ä¶but like i get that it is setting the scene for this concept album üò≠

**dreamingpastel** (4): STRANGER THINGS???

**frogaranaman** (4): bro why are u scaring the hoes rn

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): okay the synths here are kinda painful and the spoken word doesn‚Äôt do it for me

**impla77** (3): This title sounds promising but then its just continuing the ‚Äòtheme‚Äô, disappointed :(

**eldritchdeergod** (2.5): the name is so cool but i don't want to listen to some guy talk, but at least there feels like a little more thought put into the gimmick

**IIIHenryIII** (2): I‚Äôm popping 911 instead, you need to be arrested for boredom

**Nagisoid** (2): Everyone wants a We Cry Together moment or whatever

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (1.5): was this necessary. giving it .5 bc at least the start is fun

**beeozan** (1): :who:

**flava** (1): is it camp? Yeah! Does that make it good? Nope!

**oscarbrierley1** (1): too long for an interlude

**RandomHypnotica** (1): biblically accurate Jim Carrey

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): shout out to biblically accurate angels

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I was so sure I was gonna have an 8+ average for this album but‚Ä¶ I had deleted and basically forgotten this song(?) existed.

**mysario** (0): Biblically accurate flop

**TiltControls** (0): of all the interludes on the album this is probably the one i actively dislike

**TragicKingdom1** (8): I find this chorus unreasonably catchy for a ballad, and the bridge is great too, but the rest of the song is kinda just waiting around for those parts. A functional song but not one I ever seek out.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this lyrics are very sweet on here as Harry sings about a girl who is estranged from her family and had to find her own way. Definitely one of the better written songs on here but I wish it was something I would want to come back to more. It‚Äôs sonically not my cup of tea.

---

**1998tweety** (10): This gay-coded serve

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love the guitar plucking in the first moments and the lyrics here

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): the riff at the start kinda sounds like Julien Baker‚Äôs Sprained Ankle

**flava** (10): Genuinely sweet and empathetic, love a little ditty like that

**frogaranaman** (10): it‚Äôs so wild when artists that are making wildly generic songs to sell the most amount of it throw in one or two genuinely beautiful pieces of music in the middle of their albums. like where the fuck did this come from?

**jsonphile** (10): actually one of Harry‚Äôs best songs

**seanderlust** (9.5): You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up - THAT PART

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): oh wow, this actually made me cry a lot for some reason.

**babadork** (9): I don‚Äôt love how he sings the bridge, but this is sweet.

**Frajer** (8): this is cute but still mad it's not about Mara Wilson

**pig-serpent** (8): The uncommon acoustic song that just clicks with me.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is going to bomb because quiet acoustic ballad, but nevertheless it's making me feel pensive. üè†

**welcome2thejam** (8): Close, but that one dance scene from the Matilda musical movie still outsold

**shipperondeck** (7.1): i think he should do more songs like this. when he's not trying to be some kind of sex icon he's actually listenable. hes probably a sweet guy at heart and that is way more digestable than trying to be sexy when hes not

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I mean‚Ä¶ leave it to the corny British guy to make a song called ‚ÄúMatilda‚Äù

**celladonn** (7): this song gets better as it goes along, that bridge is really nice

**eldritchdeergod** (7): funnily enough i feel like this is one of the better received tracks on the album and it doesn't really do it for me personally, but i still can appreciate it's inclusion

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): I think often harry is at is worst when he goes in and is like 'lemme make a song based on this one person in particular in great detail for one song' am i saying this because i dont care for cherry perhaps! Caroline is one of his best though This one isnt bad to me, and i get why people would enjoy it alot however its not for me

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): Matilda is such an aussie core name

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Netflix propaganda? Get outta here! I didn't watch it but I bet it sucks

**impla77** (6): i‚Äôm glad this means something to a lot of people

**WaneManToc** (6): this is so fucking funny. these are 2k14 mitski chords for a coffeeshop being sung by harry. there is nothing wrong with this cut! it gives nothing but 6/10 energy!

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): stop the mansplaining I want more quirky pop songs

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this feels like self insert fanfiction

**nt96** (5): this doesn‚Äôt do much for me

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5): i on't understand why the harry fandom latched onto this song

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): This ballad sounds longer than it should

**DirtyRat583** (4.5): a ballad? getting an ok score and not a 0 from me? i dont believe it

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): Matilda is his nickname for Louis #larryforever

**throwaway-7650** (4): this is a conan gray song [derogatory]

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): "She's Leaving Home" but‚Ä¶ mid

**DaHumanTorch** (3): matilda (1996) sweetie i'm so sorry

**Nagisoid** (3): Giving this a 3 for the lyrics because everything else is extremely forgettable

**Poydoo** (3): He literally can not write lyrics

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): I mean, it‚Äôs cute but it‚Äôs also very boring

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): is this about the magic little girl bc why does it sound so beautiful and romantic wasn't she being abused??? i never read the book idk

**ImADudeDuh** (2): his vocals on the bridge.... That was a struggle

**passionfruits2** (2): there ain't no magic going on here, miss honey

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Not gonna defend these lyrics but I love how this has such a good sense of forward momentum and Harry almost struggling to keep up with it without it being overwhelming. To me it feels like the sensation of life passing you by, which I think Harry was going for but we'll never know because it's impossible to think about anything except "side boob" when you listen closely.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I don‚Äôt know why Harry thought this was a song worth having on the album, but he did it anyway. He‚Äôs just listing stuff and how much he loves someone, and then also decides to be slightly edgy by saying cocaine sideboob? Regardless of the lyrics, I find the melody annoying and meandering, but just quirky enough where I don‚Äôt loathe it. This is the one song that should have been kept in the drafts, and I‚Äôm sure he had other cuts that were better.

---

**eldritchdeergod** (10): the ridiculous lyrics make the song, every time i hear 'cocaine, sidebood, choke her with a sea view' i am filled with joy and i'm not being sarcastic

**IIIHenryIII** (10): who let this man keep driving after committing manslaughter???

**Poydoo** (10): I hate to admit it, but this song is really fucking good

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): i don't process lyrics so didn't understand why ppl didn't like this song till comments on this sub lol

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): am i the only one wondering how he didn't have his license revoked after he committed manslaughter??

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): this is going to be his second song out directly after the fucking quincy jones interlude and its gonna be the most :standing: tone shift ever. I was going to make a commet about this song about how haylor could still happen because of the cocaine but taylor and joe broke up and ruined my whole thing i was going to do. Actually they didnt the reson that joe hasnt been by taylor is because he's off somewhere cause he saw harry and Taylor commit vehicle manslaughter.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): sideboob

**TiltControls** (8.5): my mario kart mantra

**1998tweety** (8): me driving 3 hours home at 11 pm from the florence and the machine concert

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): sideboob

**throwaway-7650** (8): what this song needed after the 2 minute mark: (it's so short!)

**nt96** (7.8): these are a few of my favorite things?

**Frajer** (7.5): I will also always love hashbrowns

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): the passenger in the car with Charli:

**akanewasright** (7): don‚Äôt do cocaine and sideboob while driving kids

**beeozan** (7): obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, guava juice, giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this is like the theme song to 2012-era Instagram filters

**impla77** (7): what a cute song.. do WHAT?

**jasannn** (7): Why does this album have so many songs that sound like it should be the closer

**ricki** (7): i saw him live and i straight up had to stand like this üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è during this song because i swear that was the first time i had heard this song

**shipperondeck** (6.2): the lyrics kinda lackluster, i wouldnt criticize them if they werent meant to be at the forefront of this song with it's whole montage like aesthetic.. but yeah it's okay

**frogaranaman** (6): him making an aural metaphor about how everything‚Äôs become numb and the perception of everything since the pandemic started hasn‚Äôt been real by making a song that is droning and driving constantly trying to reach the end and titling the song ‚ÄúKeep Driving‚Äù is actually really smart of him but I don‚Äôt feel like giving him the credit on this one

**jsonphile** (6): how many comments are gonna mention side boob place your bets now

**Nagisoid** (6): (Far Away)

**slimboyfriend** (6): cocaine sideboob took me out

**Stryxen** (6): bucket list

**WaneManToc** (6): straight up missed the transition into this cut. "should we just keep driving?" could not be a more apt metaphor for the auto-pilot majesty of harry's house/

**welcome2thejam** (6): Elaborate on the tea with cyborgs bit, that sounds more interesting

**Ambrosia42** (5.8): got a lil more interesting toward the end

**indie\_fan\_** (5.8): shopping list ass song

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): very boring and forgettable

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about (Rihanna‚Äôs 2007 smash hit Shut Up and Drive)

**AHSWeeknd** (5): ‚Ä¶no?

**CrimsonROSET** (5): speed (1994)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (4): oh wow, this is uninteresting as fuck, also I ain't choking anybody with a sea view, cuz fuck that's boring.

**hikk** (4): remember when we hit the brakes too soon

**passionfruits2** (4): me when i accidentally run into a storage full of Harry Styles' CDs...

**seanderlust** (4): ghntybbn - my cat had the zoomies and ran on my keyboard and here are his thoughts on keep driving

**vayyiqra** (4): There's a comment I've made a few times that also got a banner once about how songs with shuffle beats are always bangers. I am going to say this song as a data point is an outlier. üè† [Also the "cyborg/tea/cocaine/sideboob" verse, what the hell was that? "Lol" as in "I quite literally laughed out loud".]

**wailord\_fan** (4): yeah this is just a madlibs

**moonshxne** (3): effectively would fit right in Midnights

**pig-serpent** (3): It's never a good sign when I forget to listen to the same song for 3-4 album listens in a row.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): This song is just being bored for a minute and a half with a random ‚Äúsideboob‚Äù in the middle to stimulate the brain.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): I‚Äôd rather crash into a nearby building

**jay** (1): takes keys out of the ignition and throws them out window at such a velocity it breaks the sound barrier

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): dull as dishwater

**dreamingpastel** (0): I want to hear a stan try and explain why this song is good, actually, but I also don't.

**flava** (0): he wants to be holy shit so badly

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): This is like Love It If We Made It but worse‚Ä¶ and I fucking haaaaate Love It If We Made It. But that‚Äôs a story for another rate

**TragicKingdom1** (7): For those who are unaware, Dos Mil 16 translates to the year 2016, and this song is basically wishing to go back in time to that year because that's before he had fame and responsibilities. Personally I find this type of trope overdone in songwriting, but going back to 2016 specifically kinda amuses me idk.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): why does this sound like Pok√©mon music at the beginning. I do enjoy trap production however this song feels out of place here on the album and is more forgettable. This is filler to me and could easily be cut

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): wait it didn‚Äôt sound like he said ‚Äúviews‚Äù though

**WaneManToc** (9.5): look in regards to radio ready trap beats in a car, it's fucken WILD how well this shit sounds. genuinely had a blast driving to the second disc and this was one example. I wish we could do something more with trap, but bad bunny clearly gets

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): so funny to me he snapped his ex from 2016 on this track for nostalgia but because he didn‚Äôt want to really pay her much if anything for this he has to see her in court. Anyway I‚Äôm on her side but also I really like this song. I forgot there‚Äôs a Zendaya reference here

**akanewasright** (8.5): me pretending I don‚Äôt know about that lawsuit: wow this is good!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): huh! look at that.

**nt96** (8): love it when fellow men reference rate flops

**Poydoo** (8): This sounds kinda cool

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (8): 2016 genuinely deserves this shout out

**vayyiqra** (8): "The year 2016 was his last year before reaching world stardom. For this reason, he tells what he would like to do if he could go back to such a time, including listening to Views by Drake" lol. üèñÔ∏è

**apatel27** (7): Plus for the varied sound, minus for the absolute worst lyrics in this whole album

**eldritchdeergod** (7): for this line alone: 'Te vo'a dar con euforia, t√∫ ere' mi Zendaya (¬°Rrra!)'

**frogaranaman** (7): yeah this does sound like one of his 2016 songs

**Roxieloxie** (7): trying to decide if this trying to sound like a song from 2016 works for me or not, i think it does, im getting memories of being hit in the head with a volleyball listening

**welcome2thejam** (7): He came back to 2016 to do two things: fuck for three straight days & tell absolutely no one of the horrors to come in the next few years

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): of course the most Drake-ish track is the worst

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): nooo don't mention Views by Drake, you're so sexy. hahaha

**throwaway-7650** (6.1): I could give this a 1.6 to be mean but I'll settle for the inverse

**1998tweety** (6): this gives off filler vibes

**Ambrosia42** (6): I‚Äôm not as big of a fan of this more trap sound, but it‚Äôs not bad

**cremeebrulee** (6): a ‚Äúsummer 2016 was unmatched üíî‚Äù tweet goes viral every 3 minutes

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): is this how many millions of dollars he makes a day

**bulforster** (5): after the slay of ojitos lindos it's always during this song that I realise there's still like a whole album left and despair (luckily this is the worst song left)

**Nagisoid** (5): The Euphoria line is extremely corny but it's the most memorable part of this song so what gives

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Fuck I can‚Äôt stand this guy‚Äôs voice sometimes.

**bluehxrizon** (4): not very interesting but he lost points for mentioning Views

**shipperondeck** (4): fine

**moonshxne** (3.4): The Bad Bunny baby recording is indeed the best thing about this by far. Go girl, go get that bag!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Get that financial compensation Carliz! Anyway yeah this is boring as hell

**impla77** (3): where is the melody

**oscarbrierley1** (3): very boring sonically. sounds like hundreds of other songs.

**ricki** (3): yea the album could have done with this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): I hate sadboi trap

**aldwin\_is\_here** (1.6): it's because this is boring.

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): I really don‚Äôt want to skip songs in rates and give every second of every track a chance. With every hi-hat rattle the temptation to give in only continues to rise.

**Awkward\_King** (1): okay??

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is definitely one of the most bombastic songs on the album, and probably his most interesting song as well! I love the trumpets on the chorus and the overall energy of Harry here with his ant farm theme inspiration. A lot of people hate the commercial song energy of it, and I‚Äôll blame Apple for actually using it in a commercial which played a lot!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Okay I know this has many, many detractors for being cheesy or whatever but imo this is expertly produced! The horn riff is euphoric and the whole package is just so joyous I can't help but feel whimsical. Idk maybe some of y'all just hate fun??

---

**akanewasright** (10): This video sold the song for me I fear‚Ä¶ this was the first time I was like ‚Äúmaybe he is trying to do glamor king a little‚Äù

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is joy, this song is peace, this song is a pastel yellow and the sleep you get when you just can't keep your eyes open any longer. it's how the moon sparkles on the water and feels like it shines directly on you. it's a hug you were too scared to ask for

**cremeebrulee** (10): people hating this is proof that brass players are an oppressed class

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i like to have fun

**mysario** (10): much like most of popheads, I'm pretty sure sushi restaurants refuse to play this

**ricki** (10): idgaf im having a blast in this major tech corporation ad

**Roxieloxie** (10): Ill be honest, I thought this was gonna be my 11. Its a song that invokes so much imagery in me. It starts and i feel like im in a rooftoop resturant with a date and he's showing me how insane his is and in that moment I have the choice to leave, but theres something about the situation thats so ??? that makes it enthralling and Im kinda wrapped up in this quasi romantic but a little muppets show part school play romance sequence. Like its not camp but its some secret 3rd thing that im very enamored with. However in the time of this rate opening i learned that everyone fucking hates this song and at the very least it has 8 0s and I just cant set myself up for embarrassment that bad.

**seanderlust** (10): it just sounds like harry and his backing band are having fun here which is what makes this so fun! plus the mix of pop and smooth jazz always hits for me

**throwaway-7650** (10): fawk I can't tank this because of A.N.T. farm

**xavieryes** (10): I fucking love this song, it's "so bad it's good" to its finest extent. I love the dorkiness of "music for a sushi restaurant" being right there in the lyrics, followed by "music for whatever you want", pretty much a self-aware declaration of how lazy this song is. And it's just so fucking catchy, I didn't give attention to it at all when it came out but later on I became addicted to it. Also I don't get the criticism that this doesn't sound like actual music for a sushi restaurant, do sushi restaurants where you guys are from actually play Japanese music or something?

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I mean I won‚Äôt lie, it‚Äôs good

**dropthehammer11** (9): idk man its unique and has character and it endlessly funky. i can get down with it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): targetcore (affectionate)

**ImADudeDuh** (9): LANDC you will always be influential

**jasannn** (8.5): is this a fancy authentic sushi restaurant or casual American sushi restaurant?

**eldritchdeergod** (8.2): i like the groove but ultimately it's one of the weaker tracks. still a bop though!

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Fuck Apple and their fucking commercials for ruining this song tbh

**frogaranaman** (8): top contender for the 2022 nominations of the ‚ÄúI get why you would say that for your metaphor, but why did you say that for your metaphor‚Äù category for metaphors about not feeling as hot as someone else in your life. the other is Anti-Hero

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I mean, technically it's more "Music for an AirPods Ad" but I see what you mean Harold

**TiltControls** (8): did this man have a formative relationship with his goldfish or something

**babadork** (7.7): This has grown on me a lot since it came out. I went through a brief and uncharacteristic smooth jazz phase in February. It could still use a saxophone solo.

**1998tweety** (7.5): ant farm serve

**Frajer** (7.5): pet peeve is when something tries hard to be happy and fun but this also kinda works

**hikk** (7.5): i hadn't been out for sushi in ages but i went 3 diff times in the past month while this rate was open, the promo i've been putting in for tk and yetti is unreal

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): China Anne McClain is on the phone with her lawyers as we speak

**beeozan** (7): he was 2 steps away from having his Hello Kitty moment

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I feel like I‚Äôve seen nothing but strong opinions on this but I‚Äôm here to represent for the ‚Äúit‚Äôs nice‚Äù camp.

**jsonphile** (7): it‚Äôs iTunes advertising music, but it‚Äôs kinda a bop

**Stryxen** (7): the glee intro ba ba da ba ba ba‚Ä¶ maybe this has the camp factor

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): this actually sounds alright to me as long as i tune out the lyrics... mildly overhated

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6.5): this is an okay song but it sounds like it'll be used for a didn't-aged-well car commercial or an Apple ad.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): more like music for not winning a rate

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This song is frustrating. It's extremely well composed, but Harry's "effortless cool" energy comes off more as he forgot to practice and showed up to record with a hangover.

**Poydoo** (6.5): The horns are at least interesting. The song does stand out from the boring, cringy, waste of time that is the rest of the album by being an interesting, cringy, waste of time. +2 points because I didn't fall asleep in the middle

**DirtyRat583** (6): at least hes having fun

**jay** (6): i could not tell you a single thing he said in this song, it was kinda random word generator of lyrics

**oscarbrierley1** (6): music for an advertisement

**WaneManToc** (6): look the video for this is ass and this as yr album opener is ass, but also who gives a shit. 6/10. this comment box is used more to discuss Harry Styles' fashion choices. As a crossdresser who both desires to at least see some representation, making such a wish often means getting monkey paw'd HARD. Harry Styles is the cissest (not straightest) crossdresser we've got to date. tbh, his fits are just hard 6/10s that ALWAYS feel like they're culling a little too close to a cis-normality instead of an outlandish outrighteous glam star he seems to REALLY be wanting to become (the video as well, is humorous enough to seem to understand that, and I appreciate that aspect). I can't help but root for him and give the FAINTEST of a hat trip, but what the fuck is harry doing to help those in need on Terf Island? Why isn't he having a giant tour of the American South with profits going to those in need? isn't this what a major pop celebrity SHOULD be doing and we SHOULD be demanding from our cornball dipshits?!?! Dude is legit one album away from the jumping the shark (he will try to out do Madonna - Vogue's or some shit) and truly warranting the ire of a large, fractured community. please harry, vibrate higher for fucks sake.

**bluehxrizon** (5): reductive

**bulforster** (3.5): his scatting makes me deeply uncomfortable

**welcome2thejam** (3): Harry, move! Harry, the low scores are coming! Oh God he's advertising AirPods. He can't hear us. Oh my god

**celladonn** (2): truly truly hate the scuba-duba-dubab bit and the way the trumpets sound

**Nagisoid** (2): Cool funky groove but who told Harry to steal the horns from the Regrets song by Eurythmics and WHO THE HECK INTRODUCED HIM TO SCATTING?

**RandomHypnotica** (2): is this what other people hear when they listen to IPR???

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): I've never felt more seen than when Todd made the "Exit Music" comparison because yeah it DOES bother me that he says the phrase "Music for a Sushi Restaurant" multiple times in this song

**flava** (1): Harry Styles just isn‚Äôt cool or quirky enough to make this work and it falls flat on its face

**moonshxne** (1): no ‚ù§Ô∏è

**passionfruits2** (1): apple music commercial core

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (1): i'm a harry's house defender but this didn't deserve to see the light of day

**DaHumanTorch** (0): music for guantanamo bay

**GarciaSynthesizer** (0): - Modern day British colonialism

**impla77** (0): I don‚Äôt know why this innocuous muzak unnerves me so much.. but its giving uncanny valley.. I feel like I‚Äôm giving it too much credit by 0ing it but I have to live my truth!!

**plastichaxan** (0): China Anne McClain remains unbothered

**shipperondeck** (0): i feel like hes trying to imitate a bunch of people and the result is just penis music... also stop talking about rice and green tea

**static\_int\_husp** (0): what fucking sushi restuarant is going to play music of a white boy scatting. If this was playing at my local place I would campaign to have it condemned.

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): if this came on while I was getting sushi I would dine and dash

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah I've been to a number of sushi restaurants, never heard any music like this there but uh sure Mr. Style! If you say so. üè† [Edit: went from 3 to 0 because I suddenly felt it failed so hard to live up to its name that it made me a little mad. No good, Mr. Style!]

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): another song sadly co opted by Larries (who want to believe they are together even though this song would say otherwise??) when it shouldn‚Äôt be, this one is actually pretty good. Harry vocally is very engaged here, and it‚Äôs a good closer to the album.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Not as good of an album closer as Fine Line but perfectly climactic to the mood that was set up. I feel like there's more earnestness in Harry's vocal performance here; while at the beginning of the album he was putting on a show, now he's like "no, i REALLY meant everything I was saying." Which I guess you could interpret as cringe but I find endearing.

---

**1998tweety** (10): me @ Sett

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I mean this would‚Äôve been a much better title for the album, cause he barely talks about living in a house

**frogaranaman** (10): really good piano line

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): idk if this is controversial but i love this song. surely larries had a field day w this one

**throwaway-7650** (10): thought "back at johnny's place" was "at a chinese place"

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Maybe i really should stop leaving the back of this album to dust. My one thing about this song that i think prevents it from being great is that I dont know if i believe that the person he's singing about is the actual love of his life. I feel like i've heard him sound more in love in other songs

**Awkward\_King** (9): there;s a little fruit in there somewhere

**eldritchdeergod** (9): such a strong closer, i love the outro so much

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a great ending for an otherwise boring album.

**Frajer** (8): using someone else's name in a hotel is this Gone Girl, he does like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

**IIIHenryIII** (8): +3 for the last 30 seconds

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): larry something something

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): i wonder if we‚Äôre going to get any Larry comments on this one‚Ä¶

**oscarbrierley1** (7): cute ending for the album

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Yeah this one‚Äôs a great way to end the album

**slimboyfriend** (7): in better hands this would turn into a beegees slow-burn disco banger

**jackisboredtoday** (6): if you‚Äôre gonna end the album in a very anticlimactic way at least make it interesting in one way or another‚Ä¶

**pig-serpent** (6): This would be a good low key album closer if this entire album wasn't painfully low key.

**vayyiqra** (6): Cool of him to shout out Haruomi Hosono! That guy rocks. üè†

**WaneManToc** (6): nice synth is that opn

**DirtyRat583** (5.5): distortion my beloved

**beeozan** (5): we need the Sobs rate

**CrimsonROSET** (5): and now I hate you bye bitch

**impla77** (5): bffr

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This might be the first time I ever thought a song would sound better as a generic piano ballad

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): I would say man talk about anticlimactic endings but given how this record went I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised

**moonshxne** (4): it's Fine, but again I just can't connect with or even feel anything about any of this, thanks again to the black hole of charisma that is you-know-who

**passionfruits2** (4): OKAAYYYYY !

**shipperondeck** (4): blah closer i wish it were less boring boo

**Poydoo** (3.5): I like the buzzy stuff going on in the background but honestly this song is ass

**Ambrosia42** (3): a bit unremarkable

**jay** (3): and U were the love of my past life but not this one sorry babygirl

**Stryxen** (3): underdeveloped, a lot like those pr relationships of his (i know nothing about this man's public relationships)

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): he doesn't like whats on the news guys. ok! he is a political artist!!!!

**wailord\_fan** (3): yes go girl give us nothing

**apatel27** (2): It's so boring

**bulforster** (2): this is the closer?? like that's it???

**Nagisoid** (2): This is a song about loving England, of course it's going to do bad (and rightfully)

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this has such random middle album cut energy why is it the closer

**ImADudeDuh** (1): can the farting synth stop at some point

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): I know Benito loves to keep his fans fed but damn he couldn't have cut this? It basically plays as the exact average of every other song on the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): another filler track to me. Not bad at all but truly goes in one ear and out the other (I literally do not remember how this sounds).

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): lyrics snapped

**WaneManToc** (9.1): big ass collect-call vibes on the intro. and THEN dude somehow takes an absolutely mid-ass lil' riptide ditty and BUMPS DA BASS into epic gamer territory. i love you bad bunny. also I like that on this song it is confirmed that while bad bunny is a chaste ace punk rocker, he smokes big blunts just like me fr. straight edge lifestyle borders on parody at times so its nice that mr. bunny refutes that. oh no matter why the bass is so good on the album! it's weed bass.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): that cartoon lifestyle with little Benitos swirling around his head like stars

**IIIHenryIII** (9): not this song hinting that bad generic beat at the beginning and then dropping it to make us feel relieved it didn‚Äôt go that route in order to brainwash you into thinking it‚Äôs actually a great song

**Ambrosia42** (8.4): for contemplative hip gyration

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): newton if he was under an coconut tree:

**vayyiqra** (8): No Mr. Bunny amnesia from a concussion is very bad! Don't do it, don't let that coconut fall on your head. A number of deaths a year even happen from this. üèñÔ∏è

**shipperondeck** (7.5): i know this is a sad song but i looked up the lyrics in english and i cant stop laughing at "Hoping a coconut falls on my head and erases my life entirely"

**impla77** (7.1): see this is a better sincere song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): kinda just feels like a slowed-down version of other material from this album, but this is nice

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): i haven‚Äôt seen the pixar movie yet so i can‚Äôt make a joke about it but pretend I did

**frogaranaman** (7): I want chocolate now

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): boring.

**Nagisoid** (6): Catchy hook, but I thought this song was about to be about something different because Coco means something different in my country's slang, lol

**Poydoo** (6): I love the coughing solo

**Stryxen** (6): forgot to think during this song at all. Maybe that's a bonus actually I'd like to think less

**moonshxne** (5.6): low-key giving a male diet counterpart to caprisongs

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): coconut mall #TANKED #FLOP #OFFICIAL_RATE_LOSER #OUT

**seanderlust** (5): "I can't listen to love songs" omg he said i'm so sick of love songs bad bunny ne-yo collab kings!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Under a coconut treeeeee

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (4): after the previous two songs, this one falls flat

**pig-serpent** (3.5): Bunny's voice on this song is a little annoying but the beat is fine I guess.

**eldritchdeergod** (3.2): wendy williams voice clap if you were bored

**xavieryes** (3): one of the very few songs in the album I dislike

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): Me estoy volviendo un coco loco

**Awkward\_King** (2): i wish the song was more like the first like 15 seconds

**TragicKingdom1** (9): I really love the variance here between the anthemic chorus and the muffled vocal effects on the verses. I feel like this would be really fun live because of how participatory the chorus feels. If only he had a tour that non-insane people could reasonably attend!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I wish that guitar/bass at the beginning was used more throughout the song, but other than that I think this enjoyable. I‚Äôll admit it took some time to grow on me, but it‚Äôs a pleasant listen that could have used more elements to make it an excellent listen.

---

**cremeebrulee** (10): spotify keeps autoplaying this after playlists, his so hot moment

**Roxieloxie** (10): I listened to this song so much at 7am this summer while I was on my way to work and its perfect for that entire vibe. Im not sure if i'd like it as much if I didn't listen to it alot on to that horrible job. Its simple, i'd believe it if you told me he wrote this one to keep up the fruit theme in all his albums he's sorta created but its nice idk

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is so niall horan-core

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Do NOT drink this song without a towel in your lap.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): the lyrics being performed over a school PA system is kind of camp

**emayzee** (9): he references the 70s and 80s so much that i genuinely forget he was born in the mid 90s. i just know he used to comment "i was born in the wrong generation" on youtube videos of old songs

**welcome2thejam** (9): [Takes a big ol whiff] Mmm... vintage

**Ambrosia42** (8.4): it‚Äôs cute and i like the production during the chorus

**eldritchdeergod** (8.3): this one was a grower for me. gets sadder the more you think about the lyrics

**AHSWeeknd** (8): what happened in 1982?

**dropthehammer11** (8): theres def gorillaz influence on this and i like it

**IIIHenryIII** (8): finally a relatable song for those who don‚Äôt drink alcohol /s

**seanderlust** (8): harry styles stans are hilarious...the lyric will be like "drinking red wine" and the genius caption will be every single time harry has mentioned a type of alcohol in his entire life

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Are all British artists required to attempt a Beatles song or something

**1998tweety** (7.5): yum

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Can‚Äôt tell if this title is too self-aware that Harry‚Äôs work is just a cheap knock-off of the real stuff meant to be so crowd-pleasing that there‚Äôs no punch

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): meanders a bit but still a good song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): the grapejuice technique

**plastichaxan** (7): That whispered 1 2 at the beginning was so Medellin vibes

**Poydoo** (7): This song reminds me of Northern Downpour by Panic! at the Disco

**slimboyfriend** (7): I‚Äôm embarrassed for him for referring to wine as grape juice

**Stryxen** (7): forgettable but a minor slay

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): I was thinking this had some potential but the mixing they did with Harry‚Äôs voice in the verses does him dirty here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): this is okay.

**beeozan** (6): what's with the lead up to the chorus with the little crescendo feeling that just falls flat on its face when he starts singing the chorus. cool outro tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): and IF YOU HAD A MINUTE WHY DON‚ÄôT WE GO

**mysario** (6): really ruins a great 3 streak album opener

**WaneManToc** (6): dude Im not a couple glasses in rn, but I really appreciate the dedication to trying to get on Sirius XMU with this cut.

**impla77** (5.9): pls dont whisper in my ear harry

**Nagisoid** (5): [insert this is good American Horror Story gif]

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5): this is fine

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): I like it when he whispers ‚Äúone two three‚Äù, it‚Äôs kinda nice

**Awkward\_King** (4): red or green grapes? i prefer red as long as theyre cold

**babadork** (4): I do kind of like the bass guitar on this, but it‚Äôs weird how much of Harry Styles‚Äô personality on this album is that he likes wine and allusions to paying for sex.

**hikk** (4): do sub faves rate and give grapefruit your 10s

**jay** (4): this nothing burger of a song

**oscarbrierley1** (4): the whispering kinda made me feel uncomfortable. the lo fi vocals kinda annoy me.

**passionfruits2** (4): more like CRAP juice hahaha

**vayyiqra** (4): So he's using grape juice as a weird metaphor for wine right? I'm Catholic, we don't do that. üè†

**xavieryes** (4): quite boring

**moonshxne** (3.5): one day (in the very near future) a llm will output exactly this given the input "indie pop". HOW DOES THIS SOUND SO GENERIC

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://i.imgur.com/zpj02dF.gif

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the transition from the previous song is absolutely perfect. The actual song is a bit one note though and truly gives filler vibes.

**jay** (10): lemme oscillate my buttocks

**shipperondeck** (10): this song is transcendent and special to me <3

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): I like it, but the earlier song is better

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): the transition is so satisfying

**moonshxne** (8): fleeting and understated (and, fine, also melodramatic and cheesy), but beautiful nonetheless

**Poydoo** (8): I love the transition into this song. It feels like I've been dropped into an empty void of nothingness with the Weeknd being the only thing in existence that I can feel the presence of. The song is ok

**vayyiqra** (8): A rare two minute song I like and think it uses its runtime very well! üìª

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is basically just an interlude for is there somewhere else but it‚Äôs pretty solid so‚Ä¶

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): The segue from the previous track to this was honestly genius, I didn't even notice it. Mind of a mastermind. Love this one.

**Stryxen** (7): my eyes are SO glazed over with boredom rn. know that.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): We're in filler territory now boys

**WaneManToc** (7): chill interlude!

**Frajer** (6.5): I will definitely be the only one to say I'd rather listen to Starry Eyed by Ellie Goulding

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Like the transition between this and Is There Someone Else is as seamless as the one between HDIMYLM and Take My Breath except this time nobody moved

**celladonn** (6): i completely forgot this song existed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): do you want this lady or nah abel (i could use this comment to describe his whole discography lol)

**eldritchdeergod** (6): all of these songs sound the same to me

**emayzee** (6): this feels like it's building to something bigger and it just never gets there

**Nagisoid** (6): The Weeknd really said "step on me, mother" and we love that for him

**throwaway-7650** (5.9): this is kind of worse than any actual interlude on this album

**Ambrosia42** (5.8): These transitions are nice since I‚Äôm barely noticing a new song start, but yeah this was when it started to lose my attention a bit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The Diet Coke commercial song by the guy from Crazytown outsold, sorry!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): how did I already forget what this sounds like the song literally just finished

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): abel really loves this idea of fixing a young woman with issues with men including like her father and fixing her and it‚Äôs not an original trope but it is like, Abel life isn‚Äôt that serious and also why..it‚Äôs just very 0-100 what he thinks he can or would offer a partner in his music

**pig-serpent** (5): I don't love it but it's over just as soon as it starts

**beeozan** (4): its like an outro to the worst song on the album so its even worse

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): girl why does this drag

**bulforster** (3.5): I was getting so bored before I realised this wasn't just an agonising outro to the song before and instead a boring song all on its own!

**IIIHenryIII** (3): this started and I had no idea, I thought I was still on the last track

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (3): again... it's boring

**cremeebrulee** (1.5): i have no idea when this switched over. this one sucks tho

**Awkward\_King** (0): ok??????????

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This song is basically ‚Äúyour love is my drug‚Äù Bad Bunny‚Äôs version and I really love it. Like yes king simp for this hot woman. I really wish the production was a bit more amped up, and also that long outro is confusing to me which is why I can‚Äôt score it any higher.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): not sure why this was not only a hit but elevated from low level album cut...like it's FINE but i'm struggling to come up with anything unique to say about it

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): more artists should invest in just putting silence at the end of songs

**frogaranaman** (10): I like how he makes us sit in silence at the end. like reflect on ur thoughts for a second

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the effect this dude‚Äôs music had on me over the last year‚Ä¶

**WaneManToc** (10): i wonder what woulda happened if bad bunny was transported to the iberian penisula in 1987 and discovered ecstasy. what if bad bunny invented chill out room ambient? wouldn't that be so sick! if i ran a nightclub I'd play bad bunny in the chill out room

**Stryxen** (9): filler slays sometimes idk

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song made it to #69 on the billboard year end‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs pretty nice

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): it gets repetitive...

**vayyiqra** (8): Me when I take my Vyvanse and get overheated and sweaty, so relatable Mr. Bunny. üèñÔ∏è

**seanderlust** (7.7): me in comment one: i won't just be thirsting over benito this entire time! song ten: bad bunny calls himself a slut me: https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ba/f9/2b/baf92bb8e816549772039c59c72a28ff.jpg

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): rly good song but why is there so much silence at the end

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): I‚Äôd take drugs if they made stuff sound like this.

**1998tweety** (7): this is good but why was there a minute of silence at the end

**Ambrosia42** (7): one of the least interesting sonically on the album perhaps, but still a vibe

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Kneeling at the altar of the holy vagina.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the last 30 seconds made me think my earbuds weren‚Äôt working when I first heard it

**mysario** (7): I had to check if my headphones broke at the end

**throwaway-7650** (7): I don't remember ever hearing about this spell in the potterverse

**eldritchdeergod** (6.8): the outro surprised me in a good way

**jasannn** (6.5): minus 1 point for the outro

**beeozan** (6): what‚Äôs up with the 4‚Äô33‚Äù near the end

**Poydoo** (6): Pretty forgettable tbh

**shipperondeck** (6): why this one in particular has almost a billion plays already is lost on me, esp bc of the last 30 seconds, like am i missing something here

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6): it's fun but forgettable

**Nagisoid** (5): Benito had his Supercut outro moment with this, I won't explain how

**welcome2thejam** (5): It's meh drowsy Drake beat adjacent

**impla77** (4.4): I see no genre is safe from the love is a drug metaphor

**apatel27** (4): Desperately in need of a flow switchup

**jay** (4): chica..

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Omg let me guess‚Ä¶.. her love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. is your drug ü§Ø

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): I stare into the abyss

**moonshxne** (0): he really has the talent to take a promising musical idea and make it just...suck

**pig-serpent** (0): Remarkable dull. Should've been an easy cut from this bloated tracklist.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): I find this track a bit odd because its definitely minimalist but not exactly vibey. Benito raps in a hushed tone that makes it clear that he's going for a more serious mood, but I don't think the instrumental is complex enough to bring it all together.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): this song is bit of a drag for me. I do like the simplicity but it makes me a bit sleepy especially after the last song.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): me reading the first line of the translated lyrics: üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è

**cremeebrulee** (10): starting to realize i like the more laidback songs on here, this one in particular is a standout imo

**WaneManToc** (10): the funniest shit about the bad bunny cinema verite is that FINALLY a popsicle vendor shows up in the vid and they just buy some tasty treats for their beach day! where the fuck was this in other pop music in 2k22? what other artist was actually demonstrating "this is my vibe"? anyways bad bunny says he's a "player" on this song...which I assume means he plays league of legends or starcraft or halo bc he's a chaste ace punk rocker who loves puerto rican independence as we all know

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): it's a break from the earlier, sonically, but it sounds good, I guess.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): ‚ÄúBaby use me as a chair‚Äô I think there‚Äôs a Junji Ito story about this‚Ä¶

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I‚Äôd give a if we‚Äôre being honest. The best/instrumental change is very refreshing and good for the album imho.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): docked one point for making a song about the 2nd worst zodiac sign

**jay** (9): okayyyyy el momento lento

**akanewasright** (8.5): oh I haven‚Äôt been giving this enough credit

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): he was a little weird for the ‚Äúif anyone asks just say we‚Äôre cousins‚Äù but go off

**Ambrosia42** (8): a vibe

**bluehxrizon** (8): love the ambient synth vibe moments on this album

**shipperondeck** (8): you have to be in the right headspace for this song and fortunately i was when i went back to rescore this

**Stryxen** (8): lord forgive me for the thoughts I'm thinking

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): slut music (complementary)

**throwaway-7650** (7.4): maybe it doesn't translate well but the lyrics are such a turn-off

**Frajer** (7): of course he's a zodiac guy

**frogaranaman** (7): it‚Äôs funny tossing random vibe tracks in the tracklist

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it used to be one of the few skips, but thanks to this rate, it no longer is

**vayyiqra** (7): It was vibes but no thoughts about it. üèñÔ∏è

**eldritchdeergod** (6.8): the water in the beginning was a nice touch, the post-chorus made the song for me, but what the fuck was 'di que somos primos lejano'/say we're distant cousins'???

**CrimsonROSET** (6): he kinda loses me but also I really like his low voice idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): üò¥

**impla77** (5.3): Bad Bunny is an astrology bitch, slay

**beeozan** (5): has this downtempo vibe but cmon this is not why I listen to Bad Bunny

**Poydoo** (5): Pretty forgettable tbh

**ricki** (5): im also a pisces

**seanderlust** (5): this is one bad pickup line after another if i'm being honest

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Needs more cowbell

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): I mean the lofi vibes of this one are kinda cool but whatever

**bulforster** (4): this is so nothing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): in a listening party, we‚Äôre watching the Virtural Reality 360 visualizers, and it‚Äôs mainly the same clip of Bad Bunny vibing with his friends on the beach. This clip having a food street vendor give them food was more exciting than the song I fear

**Nagisoid** (4): Does anyone remember anything about this song after it ends other than Bad Bunny kinda giving asleep energy

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (3): i don't think this adds much to the album

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this was one of the first songs on the album to really click with me but the more i've gotten into the rest it just feels really not unique like i dont know what i'd be coming back to it too

**moonshxne** (1): üò™

**pig-serpent** (1): Did we need 3 dull nothings of songs in a row? Who sequenced this?

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): ‚ÄúDAE think this is about Ari‚Äî‚Äú [GUNSHOTS]

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is so middle of the album coded why is it the 2nd to last real track

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ariana‚Ä¶?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): oh, this songs' lyrical content is sooo toxic you could feel it making scarred grooves in your painful ankles to dance with, although the only reason I'll never give this a perfect score is because Lil Wayne's last two phrases in this song ruined it a little bit.

**dreamingpastel** (10): divorce your husband, i'm bored (feat. a pretty fun Lil Wayne feature)

**Roxieloxie** (10): id fold

**WaneManToc** (10): this song is so fucking funny. they got the sickest motherfucker from the lunchroom to come in and make an anthem for ex-wife guys

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): abel would have nothing to write abt if he were in a poly relationship

**seanderlust** (9): this song caught me offguard because i REALLY didn't expect the combination of lil wayne and city pop

**throwaway-7650** (9): the feature flopped as expected but the rest is great

**shipperondeck** (8.4): wayne just being like "i'll kill him" sends me

**1998tweety** (8): I was expecting this to be bad from the title and the feature, but they fathered a bit here.

**eldritchdeergod** (8): this one is actually interesting to me

**Frajer** (8): infidelity bop

**Ambrosia42** (7.5): it‚Äôs catchy and the lil wayne feature is fun

**beeozan** (7): me writing basslines after listening to 3 citypop playlists on youtube

**CrimsonROSET** (7): lil wayne Larry shipper send tweet

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): Abel has gone from singing about his commitment issues and cheating to singing about being the side piece to various women and I think it‚Äôs funny

**vayyiqra** (7): By now I'm kind of tired of the synthwave thing (even I tire of it sometimes) but the hook is good I guess. üìª

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): And you're gonna let that stop you? I thought you were the Weeknd

**impla77** (6.7): it‚Äôs giving Carly, it‚Äôs giving Alanis.. Lil‚Äô Wayne whelming as usual

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): At least 1 point deducted for that Lil Wayne feature not gonna lie

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): like the tyler song, wayne drages this down sadly

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): What in the fresh hell is Lil Wayne doing here

**ricki** (6.5): why is the weeknd preaching against cheating?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I like the sound of most of this but man this is not Lil Wayne‚Äôs strongest delivery‚Ä¶

**DaHumanTorch** (6): ponytail has 3 days to respond

**jay** (6): lemme sway sadly knowing i signed a prenup

**Nagisoid** (6): Is this the aftermath of Archie, Marry Me or something

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6): lil wayne actually kinda saved this one

**welcome2thejam** (6): Word to Larry

**IIIHenryIII** (5): as you would care

**ImADudeDuh** (5): lil wayne shows up in the wildest of places

**Poydoo** (5): Mid

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4.2): this is so generic

**akanewasright** (4): this is unpleasant filler for me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): this album is way to era-specific for me wayne sounds so out of place here. for some reason i had less of this issue with tyler

**wailord\_fan** (4): Wayne‚Äôs verse is not good :/

**moonshxne** (3.6): oof, this really was almost a consistently solid record

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): as if that‚Äôs stopped ariana before

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The lyrics are very sweet, and the melody is good too. The only thing I wished is that he had a bit more oofmph in the chorus.


**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Very simple song lyrically but the little instrumental breaks are so fun to me that I can't help but be enamored. My main problem with this is that it's very similar to Grapejuice in my opinion, which is just a little better all around. But y‚Äôall liked this one more I guess!

---


**eldritchdeergod** (11): the pre-chorus gets me everytime, it's the perfect blend of catchy melodies and nonsense lyrics that enscapulate this album for me--and this song deserved a music video with a budget that was taken seriously. james corden you will pay for your crimes

**Roxieloxie** (11): Another 7am bus song on the way to work. Theres no reason for anyone to ride for this song but its One of my favorites on the album, maybe even in his whole discog. Maybe its because it sounds like the younger sister to sunflower vol 6 sonically, and i appreciate the callback. Im stealing this from my friend but, he's a 6 but if he was a blue bird he would fly to you, you be the spoon dip you in honey so i can be sticking to you.

**1998tweety** (10): ended fadlor

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ended that one girl he used to date.

**cremeebrulee** (10): shoegaze classique

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): also a banger

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I don‚Äôt know if the best, but this is by far the most interesting song in the album. I probably would like the album a lot if it went more in this direction.

**TiltControls** (9): harry trying have a rate go the opposite direction as midnights, the prophet that he is

**akanewasright** (8.5): yeah this one is cute actually

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): did he deserve over beyonce obviously not but im sorry this is very good pretty boy radiopop twink melancholy indie pop doesnt shower sweatervest music

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): this sounds so sweet and then u have the cocaine lyric jumpscare klsdklsd

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Kermit the Frog would enjoy this

**dropthehammer11** (8): i like it

**Stryxen** (8): WAITTTT THE SHOEGAZE

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): i also curse the daylight but that is because I‚Äôm a vampire

**impla77** (7.2): I like production elements on this track, Harry has no presence unfortunately

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): he should be going a bit more hogwild, this delivery sounds a bit too soft and sorta makes the whole song nearly falls apart

**Frajer** (7): go to jail for that dipped in honey line

**IIIHenryIII** (7): outsold Maroon 5, but Taylor‚Äôs clears both of them so‚Ä¶

**xavieryes** (6.5): Fluctuates too much between being boring, great and annoying.

**apatel27** (6): It has potential

**Nagisoid** (6): Is this song or the Taylor one of the same name better? Discuss

**oscarbrierley1** (6): fine ig

**Poydoo** (6): Easily one of the best songs on the entire album

**vayyiqra** (6): The cocaine line jumped out a bit as "?!" and spurred me to read these lyrics as I listen along, which turned out to have mixed results overall. üè†

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Harry please don't dip me into anything

**WaneManToc** (6): honestly, if i wasn't QUITE so cynical about the first 4 cuts, I might really go hog wild and defend them. but here, this is where I start to realize "we're sticking to formula, we're bringing in these MASSIVE radio ready compressed blasts for chorus..." and then I remember why Harry's House feels so familiar in a middling way. there's nothing new here, there's nothing BASS heavy or nihilistically horny going up to heaven. they're just sweet songs for mass communal spaces of gatherin

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Still better than Maroon 5‚Äôs Daylight I guess???

**beeozan** (5.5): mgmt tease.

**flava** (5): I hate you James Corden

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): hate to say it but taylor's Daylight washed with ease

**shipperondeck** (5): also mostly inoffensive, just boring

**throwaway-7650** (5): this is how I imagine most harry['s house] antis think it sounds like

**Ambrosia42** (4.5): eh

**DirtyRat583** (4.5): i mean... at least its cleanly produced?

**moonshxne** (4.5): I think the guitars make this one step above "Grapejuice"? Simultaneously, though, it might as well be interchangeable with that song as yet another album cut that just registers as "generic corporate indie pop," especially given that I completely forgot what I heard as soon as it ended. (For some weird and nebulous definition of "indie" that vaguely indicates, uh, emphatically not early 2010s radio pop?)

**celladonn** (3.5): what a nothing song

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this shit is so boring oh my god

**jay** (3): i literally forgot what this sounds like omfg and its been like 3 mins

**passionfruits2** (3): taylor did better and hers was also bad

**pig-serpent** (3): Going shoegaze for a moment couldn't save this song.

**welcome2thejam** (3): Hate the intro, wish it stayed in the slightly rocking part of the song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (2): Taylor made a better song with that title.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): remember when he was spotted with Angelina Jolie? Pepperidge farms remembers. Anyway this song is just okay. He sounds nice as usual and the doo woops in the back are cool, but it‚Äôs a bit dull and Tyler‚Äôs verse where he says you gonna sign this pre up, 4 times is‚Ä¶a choice. I love Tyler but this feature didn‚Äôt really add anything.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Tyler‚Äôs going through it

**Awkward\_King** (10): tyler thought he was featuring on a pinkpantheress song that's why his verse was 10 seconds long

**jackisboredtoday** (10): what am i going to sign Tyler I don't think I heard you
**jay** (10): lemme sway this ass sensually (after signing a prenup)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): you gonna sign that PRE-NUP, bitch!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): We ascending... Oh and Tyler shows up to rap about prenups or whatever but still, we ascending‚Ä¶

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): toxic men need dream pop too!

**seanderlust** (8.5): i love you tyler please return my calls

**1998tweety** (8): the weeknd ate but tyler's part kinda drags the song down

**indie\_fan\_** (8): i really like tyler's feature on this [BREAKING MY SILENCE...]

**throwaway-7650** (8): feel like tyler kind of phoned it in this ft., bit of a shame

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The Weeknd‚Ä¶ gay rights?

**welcome2thejam** (8): A 12 if the song was just "you gon sign this prenup" for three and a half minutes

**emayzee** (7.6): i feel like this could've been so much better

**impla77** (7.6): love a nice romantic song with a aggressive prenup line

**Frajer** (7.5): please don't make a woman scream like Neve Campbell

**WaneManToc** (7.1): why the fuck did we suddenly hit "yeah sure okay" mode after 6 bangers? I mean I guess we all gotta run on empty and make a lyric video that has the lyric "you ended up with someone so basic, so faceless". like damn what a burn I guess? this is such a sleepy one! anyways what era of tyler is this featured here? goblin era? BAUDELAIRE? IGOR?

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): üëèYOU üëèGON üëèSIGN üëèTHIS üëèPRE üëèNUP üëè

**CrimsonROSET** (7): wild Tyler feat

**frogaranaman** (7): ‚Äúcatalogue already looking legendary?‚Äù then what‚Äôs stopping you from retiring and letting the legend start. what‚Äôs that? the story of your art is not finished? Coward.

**vayyiqra** (7): Oh yeah the radio concept, that didn't show up for a while. üìª

**shipperondeck** (6.9): if i were abel i would have made tyler to come up with 2-3 more original lines instead of repeating the last one too many times

**Ambrosia42** (6.5): some moments I like, but overall not my favorite

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): tyler‚Äôs feature drags this down sadly

**eldritchdeergod** (6.5): i liked the tyler feature

**bigbigbee** (6): Nev Campbell is really such a queen. I had a big Scream phase in 2022‚Ä¶that series slays

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6): transition is fantastic

**xavieryes** (6): It's weird that the Tyler collab is the most meh-ish song on the album for me but oh well

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): I wouldn‚Äôt mind this being the album I die listening to but I‚Äôm gonna need somebody on standby to make sure the last thing I hear on this mortal coil isn‚Äôt Tyler the Creator asking me to sign a prenup.

**bluehxrizon** (5): am I... am I going to sign this pre-nup?

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): the lyrics too wordy and also feels like Abel reminding us his major commitment issues especially with Tyler‚Äôs verse lmao

**Nagisoid** (4): We love the SCREAM V promo, but maybe the song could be better developed?

**oscarbrierley1** (4): almost good, but just not quite.

**Poydoo** (4): Tyler, don't you have anything better to do somewhere?

**cremeebrulee** (2): YOU GON SIGN THIS PRE NUP

**pig-serpent** (2): The Weeknd discovering why most people panic when hearing a song described as "Easy Listening."

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Demi outsold easily
