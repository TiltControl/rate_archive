2022 Men's Ultimate Rate (Bad Bunny vs. Harry Styles vs. The Weeknd)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/11g9cjv/2022_mens_ultimate_rate_bad_bunny_vs_harry_styles/

Welcome.

Men are certainly among the top 2 most controversial genders in modern society, with only non-binary generating a comparable amount of discourse after its Olivia Rodrigo-esque ascension in the public consciousness over the past few years. If you're a member of this subreddit, there's a decently high chance you're attracted to them in some ways but repulsed in others. And one of the most likely ways you are to be repulsed by them is in music: for whatever reason, female voices and stars are much more likely to hit the yass button. By my rough estimate, men have only won rates 16 times when their competition isn't exclusively other men out of a whopping 169 completed rates. 

However, sometimes men are just so intertwined with pop music and culture that this subreddit's population feels compelled to pay attention. Although there have been plenty of Main Pop Boys (tm) that have risen and fallen since the dawn of rates, 2022 is the first year where enough of their albums have been important and tolerated enough to warrant a rate of their own. With that being said, my cohost /u/ignitethephoenix and I are here to introduce our contenders:

# [Bad Bunny - Un Verano Sin Ti](https://genius.com/albums/Genius-english-translations/Bad-bunny-un-verano-sin-ti-english-translation)

If you told the average pophead in October of 2021 that Bad Bunny would have the best selling album of 2022, you'd get one of three responses: 1) "Who?"; 2) "Oh, the guy who featured on I Like It?"; or 3) "Wow, Adele must have really flopped." That is to say, reggaeton as a genre was background noise for many listeners until it became too big to ignore. But to think of Bad Bunny's success as purely a result of being the forerunner of reggaeton is an oversimplification of his appeal; in short, he has branded himself as a artist and musician in a sea of mere performers and personalities. His previous two albums were both expertly crafted and conceptual, with the instant classic YHLQMDLG focusing on Benito's childhood listening to Puerto Rican radio and the surprise followup El Último Tour Del Mundo being styled as the soundtrack to an experimental, futuristic stadium tour.

That brings us to his latest work, Un Verano Sin Ti ("A Summer Without You"), which, as the title would suggest, combines the warmth of party music with a sense of melancholy. A variety of sounds are represented in the hits alone, ranging from firebrand bangers like Me Porto Bonito and Tití Me Preguntó to bright pop ballops like Ojitos Lindos and Moscow Mule. This eclecticity contributed to its massive commercial success; even if they've never heard reggaeton or Spanish language music in general, there's something here for any listener.

# [Harry Styles - Harry's House](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/530/239/279.webp)

It is very hard not to have an opinion of Harry Styles these days, which is weird considering his musical brand is making the most accessible music possible. Since his solo breakout in 2017, Harry Styles has staked his claim on the 70s soft rock side of retro pop to exponential returns. "Sign of the Times" was an epic power ballad in the style of Journey or Aerosmith; "Adore You" wouldn't be out of place in the Taupin/John songbook; and "Watermelon Sugar" has a very Prince-y bassline and sexual overtone. Of course, it's up for debate whether he pulls off any of these musical looks, but the point is that he sets the bar high for himself and the general public seems to eat it up, perhaps to the point of overexposure when you factor in his fashion and acting ventures.

That brings us to Harry's House, Harry's biggest era to date, marked by a insanely successful residency-style tour, Coachella headlining set, and seeming inability to stay out of headlines. But overexposure has not come back to bite yet; the lead single, "As It Was," was arguably the only weddings/graduations/funerals song (as defined by Whitney Houston) to come out of 2022's very fractured music market. With that single and the rest of Harry's House, Harry's soft rock has melded with late 00s indie rock to freshen things up a bit while retaining the hooks and production that made him a superstar.

# [The Weeknd - Dawn FM](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FpXZ4_xX0AADkUw?format=jpg&name=900x900)

*written by my co-host /u/ignitethephoenix*

Following the outstanding success of After Hours, The Weeknd would follow up this album with Dawn FM, the second album to a so declared modern trilogy from him. Dawn FM continues the themes and sonic stylings of After Hours, but heavier on the new wave and synth pop, and with the twist of him being in purgatory. Dawn FM is a journey through this radio station purgatory, as narrated by Jim Carey at parts through the interconnected tracks. 

Although it was [highly critically acclaimed](https://www.metacritic.com/music/dawn-fm/the-weeknd) upon release (including on popheads!), the chart success of the singles from this album and the fact that it only hit #2 on the Billboard US charts (blocked by Gunna’s DS4Ever) made it a flop era for The Weeknd’s standards. Only Take My Breath hit the top 10, and Sacrifice was the only other mildly successful track. Nonetheless, visuals were dropped for the singles, where it was clear that Abel had a complete story and vision for this era, before going on tour and finally deciding to close out the Dawn FM with a HBO special on his concert from 2022. And here we are in March 2023 with no Dawn FM singles on the chart and instead a [Metro Boomin feature where he sings a Mario Winans track word for word](https://youtu.be/61ymOWwOwuk) and a 6 year old [Starboy cut](https://youtu.be/uPD0QOGTmMI) that also now features [Ariana Grande](https://youtu.be/YQ-qToZUybM) that will be number one as of next week, are charting instead (Less than Zero stans WE WILL make it chart on 5 years time on 2Tik2Tok!) Although the era didn’t go as planned, the Weeknd is still a main pop boy who is able to do a variety of different styles of music, and create some classics that appeal to all sorts of listeners. Him being the first artist to hit 100M monthly listeners on Spotify proves that he isn’t going anywhere, and remains a main pop boy regardless of the success of his latest album.

# Bonus Rate

1. [I Feel Funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUcvdGfGEj0)

# Rules

* You must listen to and score every song in the main rate. Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.

* Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10 and can include one decimal place but no more. So 8.2 is fine but 8.25 is not.

* You may give one song in the whole main rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0. If you want to award these scores, save them for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate, respectively.

* We encourage you to leave comments of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, they must be in this format, simply leaving one space after your score:

> Un Ratito: 10 omg i love popheads ratitos!

Any other format such as:

> Less Than Zero: I sure wish I could give it worse but I'll have to settle with a (0)

> Boyfriends: 9 - Had to subtract one point from this otherwise perfect song for queerbaiting :/

will cause the rate machine to break! Oh no!

* If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving a colon then a space after the album title, as so:

> Dawn FM: imagine making a radio-themed album and then not getting any of your singles played there

* Your scores will not be confidential and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.

* We reserve the right to reject ballots with ludicrously lopsided and/or lazy scores that may indicate sabotage against one artist or another. If you are worried of your harshness being perceived as sabotage, leave comments to explain yourself!

* You may change your scores up until the deadline by messaging myself or my cohost on Reddit or Discord.
