---

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this song is on the corny side with some cringe lyrics, with Harry describing someone as cinema and how they pop when they get intimate (whatever that means). But man, if I‚Äôm not grooving to it!

**TragicKingdom1** (8): A certified chill bop (tm). This is very similar to Dua Lipa's Pretty Please, a song I infamously hate, but idk something about this one comes together for me. I can't explain it so I will live with the hypocrisy/misogyny allegations xoxo

---

**Stryxen** (11): THE REAL SLAY. Converted me from full time Harry hater to guilty regular streamer to idgaf anymore

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I‚Äôd complain about the bridge, but I guess that‚Äôs just his style

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is my favorite song off the album, and I wish there was more song like this in this album, not boring stuff.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i had more fun listening to this song than anyone did watching dont worry darling in cinemas

**beeozan** (10): kino. also that bass is so out of the Toshiki Kadomatsu book we need the city pop rate frfr

**Roxieloxie** (10): I do not believe he wrote this about olivia because it feels too obvious. This song got dragged so bad when it came out and i get it because just reading the lines its so ??? But something about how he sings it, it works, and it shouldnt, but it does. Anyway who is making the fancam for me to this song
**seanderlust** (10): when he's screaming CINEMA in the background?? Mwah

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): was going to comment "CIX outsold" (they still did btw don't get me wrong) but it wouldn't come across as mean as I wanted

**1998tweety** (8.5): its giving sex

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I kinda hate this but I do like it.

**eldritchdeergod** (8): this one is fun i don't care i don't care

**ImADudeDuh** (8): why does he like my cinema, I didn‚Äôt think it was showing

**Nagisoid** (8): I heard someone say that Harry sounds like he's saying "this enema" instead of "cinema" and I cannot unhear, someone send help

**Poydoo** (8): Minus some cringy lyrics, this is actually a pretty solid song

**bulforster** (7.5): probably the song I struggled most with scoring bc it's not really that much more substantial than the rest of this album, just more attractive bones of a song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): the cinema in question being ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Worry Darling‚Äù makes this song so much funnier
**\_\_Avaritia** (7): See if the whole record was just this Very Good Wallpaper music I think I‚Äôd have less complaints about it

**bluehxrizon** (7): most of these songs are okay to decent but i could name 867 songs that sound just like each one of them

**Frajer** (7): me if I ever meet Sofia Coppola

**frogaranaman** (7): by the end it‚Äôs like bro I get it

**jasannn** (7): charming yet simultaneously bland

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i can‚Äôt believe this is the 2nd time i‚Äôm mentioning KKB in this rate but they outsold
**welcome2thejam** (7): Show me the Letterboxd account Harry

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): did not need the last minute

**jay** (6.5): did he think we were gonna gag

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6.5): i'd give this an 8 if the end didn't drag as much as it does

**Ambrosia42** (6.4): i like the bass

**CrimsonROSET** (6): music for a sushi elevator

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): He should make a song with silk sonic

**nt96** (6): Harry is as cool as Marvel is art

**oscarbrierley1** (6): like an i heard your married now with less energy

**passionfruits2** (6): "you got the cinema" is the type of stupid line i enjoy

**shipperondeck** (6): sonically one of the best songs on the album but i still don't know what You Got The Cinema means and i really REALLY don't want to hear about someone getting wet for him

**vayyiqra** (6): This whole album feels kind of autogenerated but at least this has some groove to it (?). Anyway reminder that the Mar√≠as are in this rate and their album Cinema (2021) is great, highly recommended, indie pop with chillout dreamy vibes and a bit of jazz influence even. üè†

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The "wet" line‚Ä¶ Harry there is an art to dropping horny lyrics into songs

**WaneManToc** (6): this is of course, a five bagger promise the man is making. we love the cinema! prolly would be a 0 because he's seriously dragging up for the shallowest of rewards on this sound palette at cut 8 ("i bring the pop to the cinema. you pop!" is an earworm in a derogatory sense). like this is fucking self-parody whiter than white bread. but im so deep in the house (also where is harry's deep house album? hmmm!) that we're just going "oh okay man...it's a 6/10 album experience"

**moonshxne** (5.9): In spite of what I would consider nonsensical lyrics (which have never stopped me from enjoying great music!), this song really does boast a solid groove and a pretty, city pop-inspired soundscape. But, the song's appeal is just stunted by the black hole of charisma that is just Harry's "laid-back" (but actually incredibly bland) vocal performance.

**babadork** (5.5): I don‚Äôt like it lyrically, but I kind of like the instrumental even though it could use more guitar.

**flava** (5.5): is this dedicated to his favourite porn actor?

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): who talks like this

**apatel27** (4): It goes on for too long

**IIIHenryIII** (4): now you‚Äôre making it hard to defend you

**impla77** (4): this metaphor makes me cringe

**pig-serpent** (4): You may be Cinema but you're not Kino.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Skrillex‚Äôs ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù remains superior and unbothered

**wailord\_fan** (3): he‚Äôs really bad at using metaphors in songs

**dreamingpastel** (2): Je suis all√© au cin√©ma avec mes copains et ma famille

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): it just feels like a boring bloated slog of a movie

**DaHumanTorch** (1): he tried to be sexy instead i just threw up in my mouth

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Honesty this is definitely one of the best intro tracks I‚Äôve heard. The synths makes me ascend, Jim‚Äôs part works well and the Weeknd sounds great here.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the way I was HYPED for this album on first listen after hearing this because like oh he's in his conceptual bag and then he did...that

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): Interludephobia will strike

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I didn‚Äôt love the conclusion to the visual aspect of this album but I loved the start and build up so much and this is so twilight zone esque it‚Äôs great. I also reminds me of welcome to nightvale or penumbra a bit

**hikk** (10): wdgaf but i do like a dramatic intro track idk

**mysario** (10): ayo is that the Grinch from 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)'

**ricki** (10): i fear he ate with this

**throwaway-7650** (10): this being the best title track in the rate... and nothing for harry

**jay** (9): lemme twerk

**plastichaxan** (9): Idc this is SUCH a vibe like wow I AM listening to 103.5 Dawn FM

**WaneManToc** (9): Hello and welcome to my album.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Goodbye this song if the last day of the reveal is indeed (and I pray) a Dawn FM listening party

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): A great intro for a great album!

**impla77** (8): idk how to rate this but i like the jingle i guess??

**Nagisoid** (8): Abel's progressive electronic era... I just know Kraftwerk's old asses are shaking.

**Poydoo** (7.5): Really cool intro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I don‚Äôt know if the radio concept is entirely necessary but hey Jim Carrey has a nice narrating voice!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Pretty dope intro here. I love how he went as far as to make a custom jingle for the radio station.

**Roxieloxie** (7): I wish i could listen to this album in a dark room in surround sound like I was in a ride in tomorrowland or something

**seanderlust** (7): The Weeknd first met Carrey on his 30th birthday and they both bonded over their love of telescopes. - this reads like a mad lib

**vayyiqra** (7): "The Weeknd first met Carrey on his 30th birthday and they both bonded over their love of telescopes" Mr. Carrey unfortunately sucks but nevertheless that rules. üìª

**akanewasright** (6.5): cool intro, not much else

**shipperondeck** (6.5): the first minute is actually godlike and then jim carrey shows up which is fine but it's an intro so i cant rate it that highly.

**1998tweety** (6): this is cute as an opener tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): i mean sure

**Ambrosia42** (5.8): sets the tone/concept well enough, but not great on its own or anything

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): transgender commercial

**CrimsonROSET** (5): and people say no one gives a shit about the radio anymore

**DirtyRat583** (5): when this is secretly rate winner with 38 11s

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is gonna make day 2 i know it

**oscarbrierley1** (5): it sets up the album well, but its just kinda there

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5): i knowwww the whole point of this album is to feel like a radio station but i hate spoken words incl spoken interludes. at least this one is semi saved by vocals and fun production

**welcome2thejam** (5): This should still at least beat the bonus

**eldritchdeergod** (4): i'm meh on the radio conceit, i do not like jim carrey's voice at all, that's it that's the rate

**Stryxen** (4): shut up‚Ä¶.

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): shes an intro alright

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Oh so now the anti-vaxxer is gonna preach to us

**Awkward\_King** (3): as far as intro's go it is no kelis (tasty) - intro

**IIIHenryIII** (1): he ruined it at the last second

**RandomHypnotica** (1): jim carrey

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this wins the Best Bass Award for the rate! It's not the most innovative song (especially considering the songs it's sandwiched between on the tracklist) but it serves its purpose as being the most straightforward banger on the album. I expected this to at least outlast all the filler but apparently that was too much to ask (stream Niall). 

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): the arguably biggest song from the album, this song is probably one of the weakest song for me. First off, I cannot stand chencho‚Äôs voice, this is probably the second song I‚Äôve heard with him on it and and drags downs anything he‚Äôs in. Secondly, the rest of the song is pretty drab and basic. The mid tempo pace doesn‚Äôt do it any favors and the production is phoned in for me. I don‚Äôt get why this was the biggest hit when he has so many better tracks on this album. I‚Äôll give props to its catchiness, but its not the song i want to have stuck in my head (especially when its Chencho‚Äôs whiny voice).The more I listen to this (i‚Äôve listened to it like 5 times by now), the more I irrationally get irritated this was a hit.
---

**akanewasright** (11): the best song I‚Äôve ever heard, the world stopped during the second verse. For real though, I really think every piece of this song is magnificently catchy and danceable. Chencho‚Äôs voice is a feature not a bug

**AHSWeeknd** (10): do I feel Bonita?

**amr** (10): ^_^

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): hot

**frogaranaman** (10): ‚Äútu no ere bebecita? tu no ere bebesota / Frikitona, ma, se te nota‚Äù should win a Pulitzer poetry prize

**IIIHenryIII** (10): give me a second 11, yo me porto bonito, I promise

**ricki** (10): if you‚Äôre sober enough to notice how awful of a singer chencho is, you‚Äôre listening to this song wrong

**WaneManToc** (10): omg chaste ace punk rocker bad bunny is absolutely running the party. every girl goes to his parties bc they are safe spaces for vibing. anyways i liked the speaker car. that would get banned on sight in the US. we can't develop our own bass culture its so fucked

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): the feature grows on you with each listen

**Poydoo** (9.5): Chencho Corleone lifts this song so much

**CrimsonROSET** (9): flushed

**Ambrosia42** (8.8): pleasing to my ears

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): it's just a typical reggaeton song, albeit it's actually good.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I like Chenco‚Äôs voice, also I feel like I at least always seen more men who at least use or have higher voices in Latin music then anglophone stuff?

**jsonphile** (8): would be higher but that other guy‚Äôs voice is kinda annoying

**seanderlust** (8): "You are not a little baby, you are a grand baby" benito we are venturing dangerously into sexy baby territory

**vayyiqra** (8): isn't Porto Bonito the name of two artists in that electropop rate ü§£

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): the ‚Äúque tu esta‚Äù is a catchy enough bit of melody that it makes up for how awful the feature‚Äôs voice sounds elsewhere

**Awkward\_King** (7): the music video for this kinda did wonders for it clicking with me like.. i still hope it doesnt win but banger!!

**jay** (7): lindo supongo

**shipperondeck** (7): SUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLTO

**slimboyfriend** (7): I‚Äôm sorry but those featured vocals hurt

**Stryxen** (7): stretching my legs to this rn

**babadork** (6.8): I like the instrumental for this more than a lot of the other songs on the album, but I cannot listen to Chencho Corleone sing.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): umm‚Ä¶ i think it‚Äôs spelled Kero Kero Bonito‚Ä¶

**bluehxrizon** (6): the feature did not give

**impla77** (6): Surely its not healthy to be this horny

**1998tweety** (5): don't like the voice of the feature

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): This is where I got tired of that dembow/reggaeton beat and this is where I knew things were going to go south for me lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Who is this Chencho and how do we get him to stop singing

**welcome2thejam** (5): The guest is kinda killing it in a bad way

**moonshxne** (4.1): benito just comes off as a whiny brat‚Ä¶

**apatel27** (4): Why is he so damn thirsty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): ‚ÄúUpload that ass more often‚Äù me when I‚Äôm following a very cute donkey on instagram.

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (4): i wish i enjoyed this song like everyone else did but i hate chencho's voice and it just ruins the whole song for me. if it was a solo bad bunny song it'd be a 9

**eldritchdeergod** (3.2): wasn't a big fan of the feature on this one

**bulforster** (3): this is meant to sound menacing but is mostly just a downer

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): the feature has a very annoying voice, and he takes up like half the song for some reason??? Other than that, this is just a bit ‚Äúeh‚Äù at best.

**pig-serpent** (3): Are there actually instruments in this song besides vocals and drums? Experts weigh in after this break!

**throwaway-7650** (3): sorry for being misandrist in the men's ultimate rate but the ft. sounds way too similar to jowell (of jowell & randy fame) for my liking

**flava** (2): Chencho, wtf are you doing here with that voice

**ImADudeDuh** (2): when I made that post about the worst 2 seconds of pop music in 2022 and I said that one Chencho line, i was absolutely gagged that half the comments disagreed with me. I assumed it was like universally understood that this sucks.

**Nagisoid** (2): The beat is nice but Chencho's voice has always been completely unbearable for me ever since his Plan B days. I'd literally listen to a Chipwrecked voiceover of this song over Chencho. Benito is sadly unable to save the song and there's not much chemistry between these two either way.

**xavieryes** (0): Revoke my Bad Bunny stan card if you want, but even if this was probably the hugest hit from the album, if not of his whole career so far, I simply cannot bring myself to like this song. It's just so insufferable and so fucking boring.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the friend zone / FWB anthem!!! The Summer Walker remix is such a needed improvement on this cause the original is so bland and a bit cringe. Once again a female voice can add so much!
---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): i feel like the best could‚Äôve been better but this is a whole vibe

**cremeebrulee** (10): we need the asexual abel mood board

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love some stank synths

**jay** (10): lemme shake this rear

**throwaway-7650** (10): the summer walker remix is 11-worthy idc

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): I like toxic friends-with-benefits song like this.

**moonshxne** (8.6): dawn fm was like me and my ex's album, and we MEMED the lyrics here. as the dumbest inside joke he'd jokingly sing (incorrectly) "friends no more/ you don't wanna have sex that's friends no more." anyway sonically this is kinda underrated?

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): looking forward to listen to friends by Anne-Marie as the interlude after this song is out day 2

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (8.5): that beat is so damn catchy

**Ambrosia42** (8): you don‚Äôt wanna have sex as friends no more‚Ä¶

**vayyiqra** (8): This is very "pastiche of a Weeknd song" only it's by the man himself. Makes you think. üìª

**plastichaxan** (7.8): Why is the beginning Charli XCX coded

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended those fads Saweetie and Doja

**akanewasright** (7.5): this song is goofy but the Summer Walker remix made me realize it has a good amount of charm to it

**nt96** (7.5): omg Me & Roxie & Vayy & Akane & Darj & the rest of ratcom ü•∞ EDIT: not these lyrics üíÄ

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): this one isn't really close to a favorite on outside the album sequencing but it gets some points just for how killer the transition is at the end

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): imagine being friendzoned by the weeknd lmao

**indie\_fan\_** (7.1): curse you abel for making the summer remix one that was meant for radio play and doesn't transition well within the context of the album!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I criticized the previous song for being too wordy but this needed a little less repetition

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): can I queercode this one

**jasannn** (7): bffr

**Nagisoid** (7): How I'm Feeling Now type beat

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Gonna pretend like I'm cool and I can relate to this

**welcome2thejam** (7): Would be a killer cyberpunk action theme if you ignore literally all of the lyrics
**WaneManToc** (6.9): why the FUCK is this hitting auto pilot mode.s

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): The first track on Dawn FM that‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ clearly missing SOMETHING some extra flavour some extra schmaltz or something

**CrimsonROSET** (6): https://youtu.be/j-01cO73qRU?t=146

**oscarbrierley1** (6): i remember people loving this when the album first came out, ive never understood why. its really boring to me.

**pig-serpent** (6): I know that you are trying to process your death and all that, but do you mind if I brag about my super hot FWB in the meantime?

**Poydoo** (6): YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE SEX AS FRIENDS NO MORE??!?

**shipperondeck** (6): probably the most toxic song on the album and it's really not that bad compared to some of his other stuff, which is a good thing

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.7): even bebe rexha can write better lyrics than that sex as friends verse‚Ä¶ embarrassing for him

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): beep beep! is that my bessie in a tessie dragging rolling stone??

**bulforster** (5.5): this starts promisingly but needed to actually develop

**impla77** (5): Just doesn‚Äôt flow that well

**eldritchdeergod** (4.5): didn't really stand out to me

**ricki** (3): he wants to be saweetie featuring doja cat so bad

**apatel27** (0): So Goddamn Whiny

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my personal favourite deep cuts, I love how bright this is. This is the energy I wish Harry brought onto other songs on here.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): another pure dosage of seratonin from mr. styles. This is very dancey but in a "dance around the house on a sunny weekend while cleaning" way. Unfortunately it seems it suffered from some of the same cringe factors as Music for a Sushi Restaurant but idk just find joy in your life??

---

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (11): underrated as HELL this is so catchy and fun and actually has some proper high notes!! that final chorus oof.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): He is soft rocking his little heart out here.

**cremeebrulee** (10): we needed to rate this album against alpha zulu i fear‚Ä¶ maybe in 2028

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): such an earworm

**dropthehammer11** (10): best harry song dead stop tbh. this song is the definition of JOY
**TiltControls** (10): best song on the album by far

**welcome2thejam** (10): Good grooves

**amr** (9.9): I gave this a 10 at first but I had to be honest w myself this isn't as good as the worst song on renaissance still. it's pretty great

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): I just know this one goes off live. I dont have much to say on this one, I know this is so many peoples favorites and while i cannot say the same Its so high energy I cannot be mad at it.

**babadork** (9.6): I‚Äôm not sure how much of my enjoyment of the song is the Brothers Johnson sample and how much is me actually liking the song.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is pretty great as well.

**beeozan** (9): this album started to bop all of a sudden

**Frajer** (9): he can sometimes go overboard with the background vocals but they're great here

**1998tweety** (8.5): what I do about Sett

**eldritchdeergod** (8.5): this was probably the weakest track to me on first listen i couldn't remember anything about it. it's currently one of my favorites

**Awkward\_King** (8): PUSSY MUSIC

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): That little ‚Äúbayaaa-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba‚Äù hook is pretty cool and catchy

**shipperondeck** (8): best song on the album

**vayyiqra** (8): Really like that sample! Very good use of a sample Mr. Style. üè†

**impla77** (7.8): its giving advertcore but its cute enough

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Quincy Jones?? What are you doing here??? (Oh it‚Äôs a sample, thank god).

**CrimsonROSET** (7): got to have a celebration

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): Harry and I both really like brass instruments

**nt96** (7): Radiohead outsold

**pig-serpent** (6.5): At least this one has energy.

**Poydoo** (6.5): Kinda boring, but at least it doesn't hurt my ears

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): could her dreams be more exciting

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): this should be pleasant but those badadadas just feel so hollow to me

**frogaranaman** (6): we‚Äôre getting to the algorithmically generated background music section of the album

**IIIHenryIII** (6): a song titled daydreaming isn‚Äôt supposed to make you fall asleep

**jasannn** (6): I can never remember this song for the life of me, before, during or after listening , but its pleasant background music ig.

**Nagisoid** (6): Why are monkeys vocalizing in the background?

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Can definitely hear this in the background of a Target ad

**WaneManToc** (6): damn if only he just did a cover of the radiohead empty ballroom waltz we could have saved the world

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): There was a child‚Äôs choir

**Ambrosia42** (5): not quite hitting

**jay** (5): lord above

**passionfruits2** (5): me when i listen to a Harry album with the sole intention to do a rate

**Stryxen** (5): the main vocal melodies are SO good and the background vocals are horrendous üò≠

**moonshxne** (4.5): feel kinda bad for criticizing Harry for giving nothing in his performances, because it turns out when he belts I'm not a fan either

**apatel27** (4): Put some oomph into it ffs

**xavieryes** (1): this is the strange kind of song that can be either a 1 or a 5-6 for me but it just has no notable appealing qualities for me so it's a 1 lol

**throwaway-7650** (0): oh this is unlistenable... it's MY music for a sushi restaurant

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): this one is a nice track! I don‚Äôt have much else to say I‚Äôm afraid.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): This is one of the more sing-songy songs on the album, which I generally do not think work with Bad Bunny's monotonous voice. I think it works on some songs like Ignorantes where the delivery is faster, but here there are so many notes that are distractingly and painfully drawn out.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs saying but omg that‚Äôs so sad

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I like this one, but I don't understand it lyrically.

**frogaranaman** (10): when I heard this over the shitty ass phone recording as the teaser for the album I knew it was fucking over

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I like how it tones down the mood to prepare us for the next track

**WaneManToc** (9): the 360 visualizer on these videos is so fucking funny. like dude is genuinely trying to use this for SOMETHING and sorta flops into success if only bc his chest is nice to look at. genuinely need to know if bad bunny and the bad bunny crew are greggheads, timheads, or chaos enthusiasts.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): nicest way to compliment and then bounce on your one night stand i guess lol

**slimboyfriend** (8): oh no he‚Äôs Drake-ing

**welcome2thejam** (8): My barely remembers high school Spanish class ass was so excited for a song about a tiny rat

**eldritchdeergod** (7.6): the first one that stands out as, "my favorite i've heard so far"

**Ambrosia42** (7.5): doesn‚Äôt stand out as much, but still a good vibe

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): there‚Äôs a ratcom joke to be made here but I‚Äôm not smart enough

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Yeah he was boooooorrn to be alooone! starts slapping own head

**CrimsonROSET** (7): rat

**pig-serpent** (7): L + Ratio + Don't Care + Didn't Ask + Your Mom + Cope + Seethe + wrong + get a job + unfunny + you fell off + never liked you anyway + ur allergic to gluten + cringe + you're in the men's ultimate rate + your avi was made in MS Excel + i have more subscribers + owned + ur a toddler + u sleep in a different bedroom from your wife + get rekt + u smell + your ratrick pick got last place

**vayyiqra** (7): So I'm reading the lyrics to this album as I go to refresh my memory, and the central theme I'm picking on is that this album is conceptually as if :pensivehorny: were an emoji; this would be it in musical form. Alright then. üèñÔ∏è

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Honestly this album is full of really great lyrics hampered by the fact that I just don't like reggaet√≥n üò¨

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i am benito's rat

**Poydoo** (6.5): Pretty forgettable tbh

**impla77** (6): I‚Äôm not sure if this is his attempt to be sincere.. bc if it is, its a bad attempt

**jay** (6): bien un poco de una siesta

**Nagisoid** (6): Goes one ear in one ear out (complimentary)

**throwaway-7650** (6): not indie pop at the scene of the crime (genres on wiki)... TK lost

**apatel27** (5): I wanna say it's cute but the lyrics say otherwise

**Stryxen** (5): just fine

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5): it's there

**bulforster** (4): the way he's drawing out the chorus bc even he knows there's not much here

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): Like the most nothing song ever but one more down at least

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Tony Dize comes onto this song like he just got off the phone with his label, finding out for the first time that he gets to be on the biggest artist in the world's album, which is exactly the right attitude for this type of song. And it makes sense, because he was and still is [being blocked from releasing new music by his record label!](https://www.oxigeno.fm/2020/raphy-pina-llama-irresponsable-tony-dize-lo-demandara-le-millones-dolares-237676.html) As for the song itself, it's another party banger except it feels like it's supposed to take place a little later in the night; this isn't for pregaming, it's for letting loose every last ounce you have left in the tank. We need his Dizussy on more songs is what I‚Äôm trying to say

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Sonically this song doesn‚Äôt do it for me as much as I wish it did. Looking into the lyrics, I like how it seems like a sister song to Yo Perreo Sola. However I don‚Äôt think it is as good and it just seems a bit more run of the mill. Still a bop just not a standout

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the vibes are vibing tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love the beat and the reverb-y alt-rock guitars in the background

**dropthehammer11** (10): WOW this gets me moving and tony dize understood the fucking assignment

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it‚Äôs banger after banger, he said no breaks

**shipperondeck** (10): tony dize ate this up

**throwaway-7650** (10): not the feature getting 1989 taylor'd because of his old label

**WaneManToc** (9.5): BRING OUT TONY DICE AND DONT LIE TO HERRRRRR! she is a BAD bitch &&& a 90s girlie just like me fr!!! SHE IS DIFFERENT AND LIVES THE CRAZY LIFE (enjoying a bowl of weed with a david sylvian tape)

**frogaranaman** (9): Tony Dize coming in was like a jumpscare I was like ‚Äúwhy is he yelling‚Äù but that‚Äôs just how he is

**seanderlust** (9): me hearing bad bunny say to this girl "Haces lo que a ti te d√© la gana" https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&v=2&jpgQuality=100&width=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Ffacebook%2F000%2F033%2F487%2Frick.jpg

**beeozan** (8.5): it‚Äôs bad bunny baby

**Frajer** (8.5): Tony Dize real name no gimmicks

**impla77** (8.5): I love the chorus on this one

**1998tweety** (8): they both sound hot

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I like most of reggaeton stuff even if gets repetitive.

**cremeebrulee** (8): okayyy my foot was tapping a little

**CrimsonROSET** (8): god I love just how basey the beat gets it just makes you shake

**jay** (8): este ritmo se usa un mill√≥n de veces, pero est√° bien. si algo no est√° roto, ¬°no lo arregles!

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (8): wish i understood spanish so i could provide better comments that aren't "it's a bop" but i have to rate this album purely on vibes

**vayyiqra** (8): The drums on this sound so punchy, it rules. üèñÔ∏è

**akanewasright** (7.5): I can never decide if I love or hate the chorus synths

**Ambrosia42** (7.5): less interesting, but still pretty good

**Stryxen** (7.5): there are some vocals I don't like but doesnt ruin this great song

**eldritchdeergod** (7.1): enjoyed the feature on this one

**bulforster** (7): by far the best male feature on the album

**welcome2thejam** (7): That speeding up drums bit into the climax always gets my approval

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): A feminist anthem? Trying to emulate a certain 2023 male rate winner I see‚Ä¶

**moonshxne** (6.3): doesn't really go anywhere but i like the (feature's) energy

**Nagisoid** (6): Finally, a collab that is actually just as good or better as Bad Bunny in delivery.

**Poydoo** (6): Pretty forgettable tbh

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): yay MILFs

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): We are reaching levels of hetero that I cannot handle

**pig-serpent** (3.5): This song felt like an intro stretched out into a 3 minute song instead of actually getting the ball rolling.

**apatel27** (3): This feels so autopilot Bad Bunny

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): My brain cells are dying please send help

**Awkward\_King** (2): one thing i will say tony dize's producer tag is very iconic!!

**TragicKingdom1** (7): Why is this between the thematic conclusion to the album and the pseudo-bonus track in the tracklisting? It's fine enough but I don't think it adds anything to the conclusion of the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this is kind of a weird track for me and it feels like a step back from the previous tracks. It just feels like they combined a bunch of elements of previous songs to make this one. Another track that could be easily cut on a 23 song tracklist.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): because it's my second favorite month.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): https://media.tenor.com/Yrnt_eF-H_QAAAAd/snoop-dance.gif

**WaneManToc** (10): doing da white girl wiggle to THIS!

**AHSWeeknd** (9): definition of a vibe

**IIIHenryIII** (9): great but it‚Äôs not august

**vayyiqra** (9): look this is like the 20th song on this album which I have heard only a few times so by now I'm out of ideas but it does bop a lot üèñÔ∏è

**Ambrosia42** (8.7): very much end of a summer fling vibes

**bulforster** (8.5): I 100% see why people call this unnecessary filler, but I can't make it not bop and the flow switch halfway through keeps it moving nicely

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): put me in the swiftie section

**akanewasright** (8): this is like basic boilerplate filler‚Ä¶ but MAN it‚Äôs fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Virgos rising up for the second time this rate cycle. Leos we will pretend don‚Äôt exist as usual.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): contrary to what this song suggests, the beach is the worst place you can have sex in. don't listen to benito!

**frogaranaman** (8): god what‚Äôs next. septiembre? let me live

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): pero puedo vernos perdidos en la memoria agosto se desliz√≥ en un momento en el tiempo porque nunca fue m√≠o

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): the waves here would be such a nice finale to the album tbh, and given how old callaita is I‚Äôm tempted to see this as the end to the real album instead

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): Agosto slipped away, like a moment in time

**CrimsonROSET** (7): wrong, April!

**DirtyRat583** (7): real change of pace for the album ending huh

**jasannn** (7): salt air??

**ricki** (7): salt air‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A cute little song

**eldritchdeergod** (6.4): should have been the last song on the album, very epilogue-y

**beeozan** (6): so many nature sounds in this album was it supposed to be his new age era

**impla77** (5.7): Bad Bunny has two modes: sex or beach (or an overlap I guess)

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5.5): at least this one has a bit of a melody

**oscarbrierley1** (5): doesnt stand out

**Poydoo** (5): kinda foregettable tbh

**Nagisoid** (3): The fact that this is even more of a snooze than august by Taylor is a true achievement

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): This is seriously the worst vacation ever bro is this what the people on Triangle of Sadness felt like

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): im a sucker for a steel drum song most the time, so I enjoy this track. Also lyrically this song is a big mood, I love a good vacation and don‚Äôt disturb me, so true!

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Benito saw that there were only four tracks left on the album and said we need a new genre in here STAT. It's unsurprising that he does well over a reggae beat given the bright tone of the rest of the album, but I do think it could've been better with a bit more energy: it comes off more as the reggae played by a cover band to retirees in Florida than the reggae playing at a beach party.

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): exotica beat snapped

**Awkward\_King** (10): you know i grew up in a white household when i hear reggae/reggaeton music and i think it sounds similar to the koopa map on mario party

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ‚ÄúPuerto Rico looks pretty even in Google Maps‚Äù do you think Benito plays geoguessr

**frogaranaman** (10): underrated track on the album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): bring me de agua de coco

**Poydoo** (10): Forget reggaeton, this is just reggae

**Roxieloxie** (10): summer music

**throwaway-7650** (10): reggae? in MY rateggaeton rate? oh wait wrong ra-

**WaneManToc** (10): love reggae, love dub. we need a white dub rate

**Ambrosia42** (8.2): a sunny lil reggae moment that fits right in

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if there‚Äôs one thing about me is I LOVE fake vacation music

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Hell yeah. We got some actual reggae up in here this time. I like this one a lot. Very fun and fits the theme well at least! I'm vibing.

**ricki** (8): shangela: i love reggae *snaps* boom shaka lacka

**shipperondeck** (8): this is cuter than i remember

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ummm I would also like to go on a vacation with Benito

**impla77** (7.6): you know its going to slap when the marimba comes out

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): He‚Äôs feeling good‚Ä¶like he should??

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): it sounds like music the tourists in lilo & stitch would listen to on the plane to get ‚Äúin the mood‚Äù

**1998tweety** (7): reggae serve

**bulforster** (7): nice pick me up to keep you going through the end of the album

**Frajer** (7): those steel drums are triggering my fight or flight

**vayyiqra** (7): I am once again asking to go to the beach. üèñÔ∏è

**welcome2thejam** (7): Tbh this album is long enough that a mid-record vacation sounds nice

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): this is boring.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): I like the production flourishes here in theory but those details feel kinda tinny and thin to me when I‚Äôm actually listening to the finished version

**bluehxrizon** (4): i'm getting bored miss benito... 20+ track albums rarely work

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): this sounds like half the pop reggae stuff that‚Äôs been haunting NZ radio for the past decade

**Nagisoid** (4): I don't think Benito knows how to do Reggae well but at least it's not offensively bad.

**eldritchdeergod** (3.3): another song that feels like a victim of album bloat

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): there's something very Phineas-and-Ferb-core about this

**oscarbrierley1** (3): too beachy for me

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): That fucking guitar line man serious war flashbacks

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (2): i can never remember this song bc it blends into the two either side of it lol

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): We love an elevator music moment! I know that's generally used in a rude way, but I do think it serves a useful narrative purpose in expressing simplicity and nonchalance. Like, I didn't even need to look up the translated lyrics to figure out he's basically reenacting [this meme.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fh4So3gXwAI-ivi.jpg) That said, while I find it impressive for those reasons, I don't find this one very repeatable, especially with the whistling near the end.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the production here is lovely and I think fits the summer vibe of the album. However this isn‚Äôt a standout to me and I forgot what it sounds like after I hear it each time.

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): giving the original island core music, ugh a vibe

**akanewasright** (10): OUCH! MI CORAZ√ìN!

**cremeebrulee** (10): ouch!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): great chill vibes

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): a man who by his music has never been able to get over woman talks to us about jealously. Seriously I think it‚Äôs always interesting to see how Latinos in music reference the elevator music that came out of Brazil

**seanderlust** (10): a smooth sounding catchy tune with a chorus that's fun to sing along to that also subtly calls out a sexist double-standard? AND there's a great outro?? sign me tf up!

**WaneManToc** (10): "god take care of my liver and kidney hey hey" he understands that to be a chaste ace punk rocker, you have to take care of yr liver; auto 11 but el apagon is so GOATED. anyways if you have no clue of lyrics (and tipsy!) you can bullshit yourself into believing he's saying during the chorus "this is not a love song". he is not! but also, this is NOT a love song. it is an ANGER song! that i relate to! omg bad bunny. im sending xoxoxoxoxox from the airbnb. u r such a hero. who IS that bastard damnit!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): bossa nova cafe vibes

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): the vibes are immaculate

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this is so bossa nova coded

**IIIHenryIII** (9): not me thinking the whole time he was saying he doesn‚Äôt smell good because ‚Äúceloso‚Äù sounds like another word in my mother language and I assumed they meant the same thing üíÄ

**celladonn** (8.5): ouch... mi coraz√≥n

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is good as well.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): :surejan:

**frogaranaman** (8): king of knowing where to place a slowed down moment in the tracklist

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This is sad bart simpson edit-core especially with the toxicity

**plastichaxan** (8): There‚Äôs something so silly about a man saying ouch like

**vayyiqra** (8): You know what acoustic guitar is good when used right! And also who is this Beto he keeps bringing up wait nvm I found out. üèñÔ∏è

**welcome2thejam** (8): Comparing his heartbreak to the OKC Thunder breakup worked on me, that shit is tragic

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**eldritchdeergod** (7): dubious honor of maybe being the first time whistling in a song didn't immediately give me an ick?

**impla77** (7): This is catchy but when I hear whistling its fight or flight tbh

**oscarbrierley1** (7): kinda fun beachy slay

**slimboyfriend** (7): KK Slider-core

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): elevator outro music

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): We are honestly so lucky that the biggest pop star in the Spanish-speaking world also happens to be someone who's super open to speaking out against machismo

**Poydoo** (6.5): Pretty forgettable tbh

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): who let sabrina carpenter into the rate

**moonshxne** (6.2): I appreciate the general premise of the song (pairing a song about jealousy with wistful, laid-back bossa nova), but the execution is a bit dull

**Awkward\_King** (6): is this girl from ipanema

**bigbigbee** (6): Sounds like Animal Crossing music

**jackisboredtoday** (6): this sounds so laid back for a song about this kind of theme

**pig-serpent** (6): Bad Bunny's Being Human. He and Rebecca Sugar should collab.

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is giving animal crossing core a bit, not in a (derog) way though, like i'd enjoy running around trying to get materials for isabella while this was on

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6): chorus carries

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): The guitar is pretty I guess

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): what in the kevin macleod royalty free muzak type beat

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Apologies to this song it‚Äôs not really its fault that I generally hate the sound of whistling. However, it IS its fault that it‚Äôs pretty boring.

**apatel27** (4): Pretty Boring

**jay** (4): chica el relleno

**Nagisoid** (4): I docked a few points off from using that word with P, just because Ava Max uses it doesn't mean it's alright! Shame because the rest of the song is chill and cute.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the line I almost died in the discotheque is probably one of my fave lyrics in this whole album. This song is solid but definitely not a highlight as it is a bit too restrained and mellow.

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): POP FUCKING MUSIC

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This and Less Than Zero carrying the back half of this album like Atlas‚Ä¶

**jay** (10): dont you break my head and my heart‚Ä¶

**throwaway-7650** (10): wait this is kind of the best deep cut on the album‚Ä¶

**WaneManToc** (9.5): oh thank god we got a side B banger. all da ladies stand up and sing along with me! and PROMMY me we're naught gonna break hearts. like i WILL be who u want just don't break my heart!!! (fun fact: this song is a major reworking of Radiohead's True Love Waits)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): i almost DIED in the DISCOtheque

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): I like song, but it's not as good as the next song.

**Stryxen** (9): idk why but I love this one

**Ambrosia42** (8.8): i‚Äôm feeling it mr. krabs

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): dua lipa on opposite day be like

**Poydoo** (8.5): Solid

**jsonphile** (8): Elton John outsold

**Nagisoid** (8): "And I almost died in the discotheque" Kylie in the Nu-Disco rate:

**vayyiqra** (8): pensive üìª

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): It‚Äôs like still missing something I can‚Äôt tell what

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): evil dua lipa:

**akanewasright** (6.5): very pleasant filler

**beeozan** (6.5): sometimes electronic stuff in this album just feels thrown in there without much consideration like in this chorus and its kinda irritating

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): fine, but a bit boring

**plastichaxan** (6.5): I definitely heard hole once or twice I swear

**TiltControls** (6.5): i couldn't if i tried

**eldritchdeergod** (6.3): vibey enough

**apatel27** (6): wtf is this vocal delivery

**CrimsonROSET** (6): hey I know I‚Äôve been horrible in this relationship and I don‚Äôt deserve someone loyal but you‚Äôre not gonna break up with me right cuz that‚Äôd be really fucked up of you

**IIIHenryIII** (6): please, say you won't break his heart so he can shut up already

**impla77** (6): I‚Äôm getting a bit fatigued with this lyrical theme

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): He's been slaying for like half an hour straight he's allowed to take a break

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5.5): ok i haven't listened to this album in full for a while but i don't remember it being this boring at the end. this is obvs why i never have any desire to revisit it lol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this song over a freestyle beat is so random lol

**wailord\_fan** (5): I‚Äôm so conflicted, the production on this album is amazing, but the melodies all kinda suck?

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): ugh this is a real rough patch

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Fun fact, this is the most scrobbled Dawn FM song on last fm and is actually a major fan favorite. I absolutely love the the production on this song, it‚Äôs one of my favorites. I wish this song did more though as it is a bit short and unfinished, but it‚Äôs still a solid deep cut.

---

**shipperondeck** (11): thought a long time about my 11. if i were to be super honest, my 11 would probably be the follow up song (starry eyes), that song doesn't work as well without this one preceding it (and the transition between them). just a really beautiful couple of songs.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending a bit

**AHSWeeknd** (10): insecure king

**akanewasright** (10): I initially did not get why this was one of the biggest non-singles off the album‚Ä¶ but I understand the nerds a bit more now

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this should've been a top-charting hit, that's all I could say to it.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): pure 0PN magic on the production here

**jay** (10): lemme sway my behind

**Poydoo** (10): Seriously this album has way too many 10s for my mental health

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i wish

**bluehxrizon** (8): the transitions in the part of the album add points for me

**CrimsonROSET** (8): hey I know I‚Äôve been horrible in this relationship and I don‚Äôt deserve someone loyal but you‚Äôre not cheating on me right cuz that‚Äôd be really fucked up of you

**Nagisoid** (8): We stan a LOVER era

**pig-serpent** (8): Wish the pitch shifted vocals from the beginning stuck around more.

**WaneManToc** (7.7): a really funny element about Dawn FM is how BADLY weeknd wants a Denis Villeneuve dune/blade runner vibe. look at the blinds, look at the architecture in a few of the other vids

**eldritchdeergod** (7.5): the transition from best friends is actually that song's most redeeming feature

**Ambrosia42** (7.2): apparently i forgot to write a comment for this. I was probably playing splatoon or something. But it‚Äôs pretty good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This song‚Ä¶too nice to ever skip‚Ä¶too forgettable to ever seek out.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): sorry Abel talking about being aware of someone is hiding an affair because he‚Äôs done that is very funny to me even if the song is like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware I don‚Äôt deserve loyalty but still‚Äù

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I hear the secrets that you keep

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cute Abel

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): I actually can‚Äôt tell how this song has this many streams like every one of the first 4 tracks outsell‚Äî

**Stryxen** (6): feels a bit clunky but I like the melodies and the chords and other things.. that's a secret tho

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't remember this or why I gave it this score idk üìª

**welcome2thejam** (6): Love me a good Weeknd "hey!"

**beeozan** (5): minimum 3 other songs on this album does this better

**throwaway-7650** (4.9): this not having a ? in the ballot... discrimination!

**IIIHenryIII** (4): yeah, there is, his name is Bad Bunny and he‚Äôs gonna end you

**Awkward\_King** (2): yes i have been cheating on you

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (2): there's not even interesting vocals to save this song, everything is so monotonous ugh

**TragicKingdom1** (8): The title track and thesis statement of the album. I think the electronic key riff sets a really haunting tone that stands out from the rest of the album but without being jarring.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): in the title track, Benito sings about being heartbroken over a girl who dumped him, and how even though he is trying to enjoy summer, the heartbreak still lingers. This perfectly encapsulates the album title theme and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favorites deep cuts with the use of synths in here and the introspectiveness. Wish it was longer.

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way reading the translation is mandatory because OH MY GOD

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): for a title track, this is actually good!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Best title track in the rate Jim Carrey found unvaccinated in a ditch.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): synthwave outrun [citation needed]

**WaneManToc** (10): guitar emoji

**bulforster** (9): this is so dramatic lol, really feels like a culmination

**IIIHenryIII** (9): sounds like the best summer you‚Äôve ever had, at least for me

**moonshxne** (9): feel like this album could've been GREAT (or at least one more in the vein of this + the past two songs, anyway)...oh well :(

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Having listened to the rest of this album, I know how much it must have hurt this man to not put a drum loop in this song. It was the right decision

**1998tweety** (8.5): she bops

**CrimsonROSET** (8): come on orchestra

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Okay, this one is pretty dope too. Nice little ambient synthy tune. The staccato chords in the background remind me of deadmau5 a little bit (or maybe Deorro's Five Hours). I would love an instrumental version of this honestly.

**vayyiqra** (8): üòî Mr. Bunny was so real for capturing this feeling of spending the summer alone at home, like I have the last three summers. üèñÔ∏è

**Ambrosia42** (7.9): üò¢üòîüåû

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): how did a weeknd track slip in here

**Poydoo** (7.7): Holy shit, he said the thing

**Frajer** (7.5): why does this sound like Closer

**Stryxen** (7.5): sounds very end credits not in a great way but in a fine way

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): I was ready to love it but the title track is Just Fine‚Ñ¢ ig.

**eldritchdeergod** (7): definitely has title track energy

**Nagisoid** (7): This is his O Superman, actually

**pig-serpent** (7): I think this would be a strong album closer. It sounds like a phoenix rising from the ashes, a happy song following a few songs of misery and Bad Bunny at his lowest moments.

**shipperondeck** (6.3): okay this is epic

**frogaranaman** (6): that‚Äôs every summer if you‚Äôre single üòé

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the way the title track is kinda the most forgettable how‚Äôd he do that

**impla77** (6): the synths are pretty overpowering in this one

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Roll credits! (please Jesus Christ)

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (4): it's there

**oscarbrierley1** (2): boring, if a song is going to be minimalist i need the vocals to be really good.

**Awkward\_King** (1): this unfortunately see no reason for this song to exist other than needing a title track on the album

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Whew the arc this has... from a loose single, to randomly appearing during the Shakira/JLo Super Bowl in a mashup with Cardi B's "I Like It," to being snubbed from his breakthrough project, to FINALLY making it onto an album three years after release. This became one of Benito's most streamed songs in the process, and it's easy to see why: its yearning tone is universally relatable and the chorus is easy to sing along to no matter what your understanding of Spanish is. Which is why I‚Äôm surprised it flopped pretty hard! I mean I wasn‚Äôt expecting a lot of demographic overlap with Benito‚Äôs diehard stans but damn

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this truly feels like it was a deluxe track tacked just tacked onto the album (author‚Äôs future note: yes this basically is cause its like 3 years old). I don‚Äôt get why this wasn‚Äôt in the front end especially since it was the lead single. On top of that, it another one of those songs where the mid tempo doesn‚Äôt work for me. It would probably be better if it was a stand alone track  (and if i heard it initially) but it doesn‚Äôt work for me here at this point in the track listing.

---

**akanewasright** (10): I first heard this song like a week or two before the album came out bc I was deep diving bad bunny music videos, so this felt like a true lead single to me and me alone

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): my first thought about this song while working on this ballot os ‚Äúswag surfin‚Äù, so I‚Äôll just end my time working on this rate on that note.

**frogaranaman** (10): genuinely hilarious how he just put a 3 year old song on the album because it fit the vibe

**WaneManToc** (10): look i just ate a peanut butter brownie and my mouth is FULL...OF LOVE FOR DA BAD BUNNY!!!! every time he goes "ey!" my heart skips a beat. the h8ers wouldn't get it.

**xavieryes** (10): straight outta 2019 but still a masterpiece

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): there‚Äôs no wrong way to end this masterpiece

**Awkward\_King** (9): he was so silly putting a years old song on this album like... we need some artists to fix their mistakes and do the same

**ImADudeDuh** (9): the Good Days of the album

**ricki** (9): this random pre-pandemic track being in this album‚Ä¶ he wants to harm me

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (9): at least the album closes out with a bang after the previous 4 songs being boring as fuck

**Poydoo** (8.8): Cool closer

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): a nice lil ending to the album

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): bop BOP

**AHSWeeknd** (8): although I would‚Äôve wanted the album to end with the title track, I just can‚Äôt get enough of this album

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if there‚Äôs sun there should be sunscreen so many beach songs none about the importance of spf

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): Tainy is such a giant in Latin music

**Nagisoid** (8): [insert meme about la ni√±a ara√±a]

**vayyiqra** (8): Good album Mr. Bunny! Rock on. üèñÔ∏è

**welcome2thejam** (8): Those birds sure got super close during the transition from the last song
**Frajer** (7.5): where did the seagull go they were serving

**shipperondeck** (7.3): seagull :)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is okay‚Ä¶

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): LIterally can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm giving this a positive score because it‚Äôs the end of the album or if the song is actually good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Kinda ending on a boring note but I enjoyed the album overall!

**impla77** (5.6): There is a lot going on here lyrically, maybe a bit too much

**throwaway-7650** (5.1): the good days of men's ult... except this is nowhere NEAR the 11

**celladonn** (5): alright i'm ready for this album to be over now

**eldritchdeergod** (5): not a bad track but i don't think it needed to be included

**oscarbrierley1** (5): yawn

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This might have my least favorite chorus in the whole album

**flava** (3): Bad Bunny‚Äôs voice can sometimes edge itself over into overbearing, and this is the case here, not to mention that bitter hook that just lingers

**pig-serpent** (3): We really didn't need a coda to a coda after what felt like a perfect closer.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): this song is exactly what it tells you in the title; a party song. It‚Äôs for the clubs and for the sweating. Rauw is good here also. The only thing is that everytime they say party in the chorus, it sounds like she is saying eye if you listen to it in a certain way. Truly a yanny / laurel

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): The hypnotic sample oscillates between "party" and "vibe" in the same way as "yanny" and "laurel"...the impact of Kiiara on pop music will truly be studied for generations. Anyways I'm really glad this gave Rauw Alejandro another US hit because in terms of musical aesthetics/concepts he's the only reggaeton/latin trap artist on Benito's level rn imo.

---

**1998tweety** (11): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): party!

**Awkward\_King** (10): party

**DaHumanTorch** (10): you're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. after the second and third time, you're gonna be like whoa what is this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): me on the vengabus:

**frogaranaman** (10): I hope y‚Äôall stop sleeping on Rauw in the sub because he is SO good

**IIIHenryIII** (10): literally any of these songs here could be a single

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is very slow but shaking my ass to the chorus is as a good as therapy

**Poydoo** (10): I count 72 "party"s in this song

**Stryxen** (10): they'd been in the club for days. Just finished making out with each other. Nadia oh was playing. They knew they had to end Far east movement

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): i feel like this song won't rate high bc the chorus is a bit anti climatic but it really works for me

**WaneManToc** (10): BEEP BEEP AHH DAT BEAT!!!! one of my favorite things about bad bunny is that he's an exceptional mumbler. dude has one of the all time great mumble croons that actually conveys a real spectrum of hungover pain, horny vibes, and clapback majesty. like no SHIT a bunch of san diego white boys fuck with this; he sounds like we all WISH we could. the FINESSE! he doesn't really do the mumble on this track tbh, but my comment for El Apag√≥n is BUSY and i wanted to say this here.

**akanewasright** (9.5): y‚Äôall this is literally cunty I don‚Äôt know what y‚Äôall are going on about

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): yup yup

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is repetitive but in a good way.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we like to party!

**throwaway-7650** (9): body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (mwah)

**TiltControls** (9): ...party

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): [GUNSHOTS]

**celladonn** (8.5): this has me shaking my ass

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): Hate the guy but Rauw makes good music

**Frajer** (8): he will never be queen Bey

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): the first time a woman has deyassified a song

**moonshxne** (7.8): ü•≥ i'll take it

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Rosal√≠a, watch your man

**shipperondeck** (7.4): UY is the best part of this song

**vayyiqra** (7): Beginning to think these dudes like to party! üèñÔ∏è

**welcome2thejam** (7): Did the Vengaboys make this?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): potty on you

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): its fine but i always kinda felt underwhelmed by this one since it was the one i had high expectations for heading into the album

**bluehxrizon** (6.5): that vocal sample transported me to 2016

**eldritchdeergod** (6.1): the hook grew on me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Sometimes all you need is a single word. This might not be one of those times.

**jay** (5): estaba tan aburrido

**ricki** (5): it took me a few listens to understand that the hook was a woman saying ‚Äúparty‚Äù and not just looped moans

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): E11EVEN? Is that a new K-Pop group?

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): AY (please send help) AY (please send help) AY (please send help) AY (please send help) AY (please send help)

**beeozan** (3): the party party party part is annoying sorry

**impla77** (2.7): I‚Äôm surprised I don‚Äôt know how to say horny in Spanish yet

**Nagisoid** (2): Is this how Charli XCX songs sound to her haters?

**bulforster** (1.5): this starts promisingly but that chorus is so fucking annoying

**pig-serpent** (1.5): If you're going to rip off DJ Snake you could at least rip off Bird Machine.

**flava** (1): it‚Äôs good until the point where it sounds like someone banging their head against a going ‚Äúpartypartypartyparty‚Ä¶‚Äù

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): party party party party

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): in this song, he gets to watch the sunrise on a beach with the girl in this one! Which is cute I‚Äôll admit

**TragicKingdom1** (7): Benito naturally floats on this type of upbeat party love song. While it's enjoyable, I also feel like that's its biggest weakness, because it almost feels like he's going through the motions of making a Bad Bunny (tm) song, not helped by it being sub-2 minutes.

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10): ugh such beach vibes, not only did he understand the assignment, he created it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I‚Äôm not gonna teach your Bunny how to dance with you!

**frogaranaman** (10): the instrumental is made for serotonin

**impla77** (10): Seeing the squiggly thing reminds me of the time my Spanish friend got mad at me for calling it a tilde, so now I don‚Äôt know what to call it..

**Roxieloxie** (10): what if we learned how to dance together :3

**seanderlust** (10): this one grew on me more than any other song in this rate

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): bop city

**WaneManToc** (10): BAD BUNNY WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE LEATHER CLUB?! being a chase ace i assume! the gay leather aces LOVE bad bunny bc he's so naughty in that cutsey way!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): me neither, he‚Äôs so relatable ü§©

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I can‚Äôt teach you how to dance but when this comes on I will still give it my best shot

**vayyiqra** (9): I just want to go to the beach for god's sake! üèñÔ∏è

**shipperondeck** (8.7): another very summery song!

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): music for gently swaying my booty

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is fine.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I was shaking ass idk

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): This is such a summery album

**pig-serpent** (8): This beat actually has things happening in it!

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (8): i love how groovy and fun the beat and melody is

**eldritchdeergod** (7.5): this one is actually kind of sweet?

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): doja cat after say so started going viral:

**akanewasright** (7): this synth is kind of grating to my ears but he pulls it off alright

**apatel27** (7): now this is a good beat but Bad Bunny can't fully utilize it

**jay** (7): i dont got shit to say anymore

**babadork** (6.5): I like mediocre rap love songs, but this album has too many.

**bulforster** (6.5): this sounds bad but in a charming way

**Poydoo** (6): Pretty forgettable tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Bad Bunny I'm too tired to dance

**Awkward\_King** (5): bailar means dance

**Nagisoid** (5): WATCH OUT BAILA BAILA BAILA

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): Like it‚Äôs fine but I immediately forgot it the moment it ended unfort so

**moonshxne** (2.5): I, too, have wondered have what a pop song sung over royalty free music for vloggers sounds like.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): another fun bop! Jhay‚Äôs feature is solid and Bad Bunny is a thirsty king.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Benito brings back Jhay Cortez (or Jhayco now? idk if that's sticking) from his smash hit Dakiti for another round. Unfortunately for that reason it kind of just comes off as that song v0.75, lacking the same level of atmosphere but somewhat making up for it with a really great knocking bass. For some reason this stuck around in the top 10 for a long time before falling and settling in its lowest position I believe (still ahead of all but three Harry songs‚Ä¶) and I kinda get it but also don‚Äôt tbh

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the way only word I recognize is ‚Äúbonita‚Äù and that too because of the family guy clip, smh

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I think this one is actually pretty great‚Ä¶

**frogaranaman** (10): when they do the voice modulation shit? immediate nut

**IIIHenryIII** (10): banger banger banger

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): no idea what the consensus is on this song but i LOVE it. when that chorus kicks in i literally transcend. strong 11 contender

**WaneManToc** (10): "i want to know which panties you wear to sleep, baby, tell me if yr willing" bad BUNNY THIS IS NOT HOW U DO TAROT!!! but also ngl this cut slaps so like...well here's a 10

**welcome2thejam** (10): Maybe my favorite beat so far, got so much pep in its step

**shipperondeck** (9.7): love this one like once it gets going it goes and goes and doesnt stop til it ends

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): my tarot reading for bad bunny is that he will get his dick sucked by me soon

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.2): true empaths get it

**1998tweety** (9): the bop has ARRIVED

**akanewasright** (9): I always forget this one is kind of a smasha

**bluehxrizon** (9): the feature did give. And this is going to make me sound uncultured as fuck as a non-reggaeton listener but I love the lightness/crispness of the drums and wish more songs in the genre would use that instead of those thick heavy asf low EQ bass thumping drums which we have heard several times on the album up until now

**pig-serpent** (9): Everything about this song feels fully fleshed out in ways that basically no other Bad Bunny song I've heard has. It almost feels more like a good Trippie Redd song than a Bad Bunny song.

**vayyiqra** (9): "Baby, si fuera cristiano hoy te fueras bautiz√°'" Beginning to think this song is not about tarot readings! üèñÔ∏è

**Ambrosia42** (8.8): a bop, the beat is great

**impla77** (8.4): oh so this is like a duet between an ass man and a tits man.. the duality of man

**throwaway-7650** (8.1): STAN GODFRIEND

**CrimsonROSET** (8): BAPTIZED?!

**jay** (8): bien espera esto es bueno omfg. D√©jame sacudir un poco el culo

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): i love Persona 5

**eldritchdeergod** (7.6): this one had me dancing that's it that's the rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I‚Äôm not like BOPPING but I‚Äôm bopping.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): me deciding what the caprimami cover should be

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): I like Jhayco‚Äôs vocals on this. This one's not bad.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Is that a motherfucking Persona reference?

**Poydoo** (6): Pretty forgettable tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Aburrido

**moonshxne** (4.9): maybe it's how much this sounds like the college party music I've subconsciously registered as background party noises but something about how they keep hitting the same high frequency makes my head throb

**Nagisoid** (4): This is fine, but Jhayco's voice is annoying to me and the beat gets pretty generic. The parts where it picks up the tempo are considerably better.

**apatel27** (2): wtf is this vocal processing and boring drums

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the second single from the album, this was a solid follow up from As It Was. The hook is very infectious and I love the melody he does in the pre chorus.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): The other big hit off of this album, that still managed to be somewhat stifled by the massive juggernaut of As It Was. I think this is most elevated by Harry's performance; he really sells the desperate lover role. The only reason it's not a 10 is that it feels a little repetitive and I would've liked for it to go off a little harder towards the end.

---
**Frajer** (11): he gets too horny sometimes but this is the perfect amount and it gives me such a nice serotonin boost

**jay** (11): bit of a perfect pop song im afraid..

**AHSWeeknd** (10): yes, it‚Äôs a bop

**Awkward\_King** (10): dad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Godspeed, Harry‚Äôs frontrunner.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is me on discord any given night

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me filling out ballots at 9am when I haven‚Äôt slept yet

**mysario** (10): Harry's best song? Discuss

**Roxieloxie** (10): I think I hyped this one up a lot more in my head when i heard him tease it at Coachella, but that one also had a whole lower brass section that this doesnt. This one doesnt grab me as much as the other ones but its sweet enough that I cant be too mad at

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): banger

**throwaway-7650** (10): average echo chamber conversation:

**emayzee** (9.8): this is just so much fun

**eldritchdeergod** (9.2): the best of the singles

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Okayyyyyy

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is actually great, but I don't want to hear this song a lot of times since I've been associating this song with a stupid hook-up-gone-wrong I had.

**beeozan** (9): talk show hosts be like:

**bluehxrizon** (9): the chorus is quite catchy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): i have stubbed my toe to the point of fracturing it before, pay for my surgery Harold???

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): Honestly his album and bunny‚Äôs are great summer or spring albums for a warm evening driving in the car with the window down or something

**Poydoo** (9): Harry decided to subvert our expectations and make a good song

**indie\_fan\_** (8.6): i didn't know this was a single when doing this rate. they really did well choosing it as one

**celladonn** (8.5): this has really grown on me, it's cute

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Some pretty spicy chords in this one. Pretty funky, well-written and produced. Great tune.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): its the way i was just getting into this song but then the MV dropped and the spotify canvas updated to harry‚Äôs feet and now if just makes me feel uncomfy to look at

**IIIHenryIII** (8): let‚Äôs make it relatable: late night rating

**welcome2thejam** (8): That chorus is a catchy little morsel

**Ambrosia42** (7.7): Okay this one is groovier, kinda lost me a little at one point tho, but then it came back

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): very solid good radio poptune, nothing AMAZING though

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): You have no idea how angry it makes me to admit that some of the songs on this album are actually fun

**babadork** (7.4): The Oscars had a reoccurring bit with a superfan of each of the albums nominated for Best Album, and the one for Harry‚Äôs House was a grandmotherly lady. It was supposed to be funny, but this sounds like something my mom would like.

**DirtyRat583** (7): god damn it this ones good

**dreamingpastel** (7): Genuinely want to like this song, but I forget its existence like 30 minutes afterwards.
**Nagisoid** (7): Catchy chorus but the rest of the song was Harry talking me to sleep in the night

**Stryxen** (7): I have to buy into the vision with this to like it.. entering my lover not a hater era

**pig-serpent** (6.5): I like the song but hate it's aesthetic. It's not smooth enough to push into the city pop genre and I think that would've fixed my issues with it.

**seanderlust** (6.5): i don't really get the hype around this one. it's fun! i like the little key stabs under the chorus. other than that, it's just kind of...fine?

**impla77** (6.3): This is catchy but super derivative

**DaHumanTorch** (6): definitely one of the better songs on the album, i'd bop along to it a bit if it ever came on the radio

**vayyiqra** (6): Late Night Feelings?! Mark Ronson?!?! No, not anywhere near as good as that song. But not awful I guess. üè†

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is pop music in the most boring, uninspired form possible

**WaneManToc** (6): clown noise-ass clown shit that sounds like you just self-owned yourself by walking into a glossier in LA on a 90F day. delirious shit redeemed by a god tier chorus. dude knows how to shit out the perfect 6/10.

**shipperondeck** (4.2): mostly inoffensive

**hikk** (3): i was so bored

**passionfruits2** (3): more light MID night talking
Liek d
**moonshxne** (2): "Music For a Sushi Restaurant" was, well, something else, but this, on the other hand, is pretty emblematic of my issues with Harry's House‚Äîand, perhaps, Harry Styles as a popular musician in general. What's so wrong with this brand of polite and accessible pop music? In theory, possibly nothing, but in practice? The sing-songy melody over the vaguely bouncy production just coats the entire sound in an incredibly thick layer of...glossy soullessness. Complementing this perfectly is the sheer nothing-ness of the lyrics, which are probably objectively fine, but with Harry's blank delivery and this song's overall sound just register as infuriatingly insipid. The more polite Harry sounds‚Äîand he sounds incredibly polite‚Äîthe more I'm upset with how flaccid this song sounds. I think overall, Harry's entire shtick is basically the opposite of what I look for when I seek out music.
