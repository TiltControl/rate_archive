**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): This song is basically Benito reading a Wikipedia article about a [toxica](https://www.compassctr.org/post/la-toxica-how-we-view-relationships) named Andrea. Obviously I could be missing nuance as someone who isn't fluent in Spanish but the translated lyrics come off as mildly positive? I think the chorus basically serving as Andrea's lamentations adds a lot of complexity that makes it easier to get into the verses.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): love the juggling perspectives between here. If this was just by bad Bunny it wouldn‚Äôt have the same impact but having her sing her side is nice. Musically, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs a bit too bare bones but I appreciate how this fits into the album

---

**welcome2thejam** (11): Love this beat, hypnotizing with just enough heat to keep me super engaged. Great storytelling. Breathtaking track

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the producers did not hold back because damn, this is seriously eargasmic

**Awkward\_King** (10): ive no clue what the fuck he's saying but im sure it's very moving that's my king

**bulforster** (10): I fear I am being misandrist even in the men's rate looking at the difference in my scores depending on the gender of the guest vocalists on this album

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): Honestly bunny could be better on a lot of issues including women but I do genuinely like his songs where women are the protagonist or the figure follower by the song. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is based on a real woman

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is such a perfect song to get high to

**frogaranaman** (10): ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

**Poydoo** (10): Ok this is a slay

**seanderlust** (10): benito had his respect women juice

**throwaway-7650** (10): the lyrics/translation for this are a must, easy 10/day 3 song imo

**vayyiqra** (10): Had a joke comment like "this is ambient pop" but then read the lyrics and remembered what this song is about, and got sad and now I'm just wallowing a bit like üòî.

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): this song is just stunning

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): citypop [citation needed]

**WaneManToc** (9.5): dude where that lil' screamy go! love the random lady on this cut she sounds so swell

**akanewasright** (9): oh this one actually rules

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): BleepBloopMusicFan don‚Äôt give this extra points just because there‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs voice challenge (FAILED)

**CrimsonROSET** (9): she sounds gorgeous

**Stryxen** (9): I think maybe the vocals aren't quite perfect but otherwise this is a perfect song and should be like top 7 of the album

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): person who‚Äôs only listened to bad mode before: this is like his somewhere near marseilles omg

**impla77** (8.6): This is like if Boyfriends actually tried to say something.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I give up, bring the women

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I like this one.

**Nagisoid** (8): Can we add Bad Bunny to the Respect Women Juice rate?

**Frajer** (7.5): he never says this isn't about Andrea from The Devil Wears Prada

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): isnt she that lady who‚Äôs always on the bad seasons of survivor

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): one of my teachers is called Andrea so I keep imagining this song is about him

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Niurka Marcos??? Naca tu verrrrrrga

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): this breezes by enough that I barely remembered it was almost 6 minutes

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): I‚Äôm sure this song would be higher if (1) it was 2x shorter, (2) it wasn‚Äôt so late in the tracklist that I hate life

**dreamingpastel** (5): Was the scream necessary?

**eldritchdeergod** (4.5): the storytelling in the lyrics is interesting but the album just feels like it's gone on too long at this point

**pig-serpent** (3.5): This is okay for a while but it doesn't need to be longer than 3 and a half minutes, let alone five and a half.

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (3): this is the point in the album where it's getting too bloated for me

DilemmaOfAHedgehog: Andrea should be positive about Andrea since is likely based on a real woman (Andrea Ruiz) who was murdered (hence the scream)

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): another bop, I love how this is a bit more dancey and a bit closer to house than the other tracks. I find it hilarious how one of the lines is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt treat me like a meme‚Äù instead of saying joke.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): On this fan favorite turned single, Benito flirts with... lo-fi and house influences? It's a match that sounds great on paper and works just as well in practice! I feel like a full album of songs like this would grow tired, but it's great that Benito is willing to branch out when he could absolutely be just as successful without doing so. Anyways despite being a fan fave y‚Äôall let this flop a tad, tragic!

---

**akanewasright** (10): I was recently made aware of the fries video‚Ä¶ idk how but my life has changed

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song reminded me of that meme of somebody cooking and suddenly, two dudes kissing for a couple of frames appear.

**amr** (10): I love fries

**Awkward\_King** (10): he manually detached his cock and balls and put them ALL into this song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the Benito boogie is a classic

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is so serious there's gay men in my fries

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the music video is based on a famous MV, but it‚Äôs also giving me early 2000s social studies textbook vibes

**DirtyRat583** (10): such a shame it got turned into the "men kissing" song on tiktok but hey it bops

**frogaranaman** (10): where are the men kissing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): makes me feel nostalgic for things I‚Äôve never experienced

**ImADudeDuh** (10): üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®

**jasannn** (10): where are the men kissing?

**jay** (10): ava max roba este instrumental

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it‚Äôs not a sound I expected from bunny but it‚Äôs sooooo pretty

**ricki** (10): i cant hear this song without thinking on sped up cooking tutorials with a random shot of gay men kissing in the middle

**Stryxen** (10): need to kiss a man

**WaneManToc** (10): omg he went to the make a music video in the store

**bulforster** (9.5): love how the three singles that came out after I'd got into the album were my three faves

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): SUM CHAMGO LOVE DIVE

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): This is an example of how great the album‚Äôs theme is executed. Energetic, summery, but also sad/reflective

**AHSWeeknd** (9): took a trap beat and made it somewhat bearable tbh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): When somebody treats you like a meme, you simply have to do it to them.

**Nagisoid** (9): Introducing the new McDonalds fries, with gay men kissing included!

**plastichaxan** (9): The video is cute but may I interest you in some fries

**seanderlust** (8): listen, IRL if someone said to me "i'll get you a beer and a heart while i'm at it" it would earn the biggest eyeroll from me. but bad bunny can have it, as a treat.

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (8): nothing to add besides "it's a bop"

**welcome2thejam** (8): Bad Bunny heard he was up against some main pop boys this time around and said "got a dance pop hit in the chamber for ya"

**pig-serpent** (7): Spectral

**vayyiqra** (7): Cannot fathom being so down bad I'd willingly watch Tiktok with someone, evil app. üèñÔ∏è

**Poydoo** (6.5): Pretty forgettable tbh

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Speed this up and add some more shuffley percussion and you basically have a Salute song with Bad Bunny on it (check him out please he‚Äôs really good)

**babadork** (6.2): It feels rude to ding someone other than Harry Styles for having bad lyrics, but I‚Äôm really not into the references to TikTok, emojis, and selfies.

**bluehxrizon** (6): This is what drake was attempting on H,N

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): added 1 point for the fries meme

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Cheap club music

**eldritchdeergod** (4.5): still enjoying the music but the lyrics seem to be stuck in the same wellspring the shtick is getting old

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): I Neverita Wannarita Listen To This Songita Everita Again‚Ä¶ ita.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of the highlights of the album, Bomba Estereo is a great addition, and the lead singer has good chemistry with Bad Bunny on this, and I love how it‚Äôs just sweet love song after all the party songs. The instrumental is great and fits perfectly, and I love the addition of the waves.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the SMASHA has arrived! Who would have known that previous rate winner Li Saumet not only had a band, but one that produced what I personally feel is one of the best pop ballads in years. This made the year-end Hot 100 in the US on streaming alone, but I feel like if it got a pop radio push it could've been even bigger. I‚Äôm pretty surprised that this got a sub-8 average: it feels like the combination of female feature and accessible sound would elevate it higher, but I guess people have their own opinions instead of just following mine exactly üòî

---

**bulforster** (11): delusionally manifesting two time rate winner li saumet

**dropthehammer11** (11): this is probably my favorite spanish language song ever. unmatchable vibe

**frogaranaman** (11): he made this one for the girls and the gays idc idc

**xavieryes** (11): Y SOLO MIRAME CON ESOS OJITO' LINDO' ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is so touching! 11 contender. the singing here is so lovely

**jsonphile** (10): gorgeous intro

**seanderlust** (10): when he uses his lower register to sing "tu y yo, tu y yo"?? actual chills

**shipperondeck** (10): godddddddd the summer song ever.. the distant horns make you feel like youre a thousand miles away

**TiltControls** (10): maybe could've been the 11. those opening horns just perk me up

**WaneManToc** (10): omg they brought bad bunny's lady friend on! she's just like kehlani tbh. and OMG bad bunny is saying BYE to booties & good morning sweetie texts?!!? bad bunny, there IS a community for you and u r NAWT a sinner. anyways they finally get in the water at this point in the video and I am cackling.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): it‚Äôs not a fair competition bringing women to the Men‚Äôs Ultimate Rate, sir

**1998tweety** (9): she bops

**AHSWeeknd** (9): maybe it‚Äôs me but this should‚Äôve been a solo track

**Frajer** (9): Liliana's voice is so pretty

**vayyiqra** (9): üòî

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): idk who bomba is but they ate

**Poydoo** (8.5): I actually like Bomba Est√©reo's voice way better than Bad Bunny's. I kinda wish this song was hers without him at all

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Sunshine on his shoulders‚Ä¶makes him horny!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): first time the female vocals are the jumpscare in a rate

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I think this song convinced me that my biggest issue with this album is that weird vocal filter that Bad Bunny seems to have on, and how that makes his voice sound like an AI that hasn‚Äôt quite grasped how to accurately replicate a human voice. The woman from Bomba Est√©reo sounds great, in comparison.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): so cute

**moonshxne** (8): After several duds, I heard a WOMAN, perked up, and then the entire song was actually good?!?! Perhaps misandry is justified after all...

**Nagisoid** (8): This song showing up on Genius in "Barack Obama's Summer 2022 Playlist" instead of Un Verano Sin Ti is taking me out

**welcome2thejam** (8): Popped up when I recognized those horns from the rate trailer

**akanewasright** (7.8): I‚Äôm honestly confused why this became one of the bigger hits from the album but ü§∑ I‚Äôll take it

**Ambrosia42** (7.6): quite pleasant

**babadork** (7.6): I don‚Äôt know if this translation is entirely accurate, but ‚Äúbye-bye to the booties, I didn‚Äôt even say goodbye to them‚Äù deserves to lose some points. I do like the third verse.

**impla77** (7.6): ngl, the instrumental sounds like it could be from a low effort ‚Äòsong of the summer‚Äô, but still a bop

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): that horse had a busy 2022 between causing bad bunny to get into an accident and being on the cover for renaissance in full horse-drag

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): I fear this chorus feels a bit rent-a-vocalist for me

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is boring.

**Stryxen** (7): a song on this album

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I've never been more let down by an intro‚Ä¶ I was expecting this to sound like some hype EDM shit

**eldritchdeergod** (5.9): tu y yo sounds like tu hijo

**apatel27** (4): The mixing on the pre-chorus/chorus is so bad

**ricki** (4): he couldn't find someone with a worse voice to sing the chorus?

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (4): again, i don't think this adds much to the album

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): The moment Bomba‚Äôs vocals came on I knew this wasn‚Äôt even Bad Bunny‚Äôs fault this album was not working for me.

**pig-serpent** (2): The vocal production on this song is uncharacteristically awful and the song is characteristically as boring as a retirement home.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I keep saying that a certain song is my favorite deep cut on the album, but this one definitely is my absolutely favorite of all the deep cuts. I think the lyrics, melody and production all work wonderfully here. This chorus is also one of the strongest on the album. And vocally, Harry does well here too. I know the era has completely passed at this point, but this would have been a great single (but then if it was a single people would hate it more as exhibited earlier in this rate).

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Once those drums kick in you WILL start moving in your seat unless you hate joy and pop music. I especially love that little instrumental distortion (?) around the bridge.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): bridge/final chorus saved it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is my second favorite song off the album, he should make more songs like this instead.

**Awkward\_King** (10): dizzy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When this inexplicably overcomes being both a Harry song and a deep cut and makes Day 3 yaaaaassss.

**cremeebrulee** (10): he got me with this one like i really do feel i‚Äôm just an orbiting body to someone‚Äôs star

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): in a just world, this would make the top ten,,, it‚Äôs just very sideboob,,,

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): what is with song named Satellite(s) and being the biggest slays ever... this, Maggie Rogers (do Anthemic Indie rate!), LOONA,... like woah.

**frogaranaman** (10): fucking insanely good track. man

**GarciaSynthesizer** (10): - Frustratingly good

**Roxieloxie** (10): this one came out and I hardly came back to it, and then I heard it once while in the car with my best friend while it was dusk and we were driving back from my dorm and i almost started crying in the passenger seat. I agree with whoever on tiktok said that this was the most 1D coded one, I can hear all of them on this. This song is so good

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): sorry but if u didn't see this song live u won't truly appreciate it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Well hell, maybe if more of the album was like this, the Grammy would've been just a little warranted (but only a little)

**xavieryes** (10): there's a great M83 song in here somewhere

**eldritchdeergod** (9.8): i agree with the hype for this one it feels pretty magical

**jasannn** (9.5): is it bad that I want to dance like I am pulling an invisible rope everytime he sings ‚Äúwaiting for ya to pull me in‚Äù or that I want to twirl in circles like a satellite?

**jay** (9): wait okayyyyy twerkulator

**Nagisoid** (9): Somebody's got Harry spinning like a ballerina

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Okay yeah wow! This one is so good, definitely my favourite cut here.

**throwaway-7650** (9): this is so dawn.FM vibes

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This album is so indie-coded

**bluehxrizon** (8): LOONA will see you in court

**bulforster** (8): this really makes me think of a song on one of the shrek soundtracks but I can't place it?

**flava** (8): he wants to be happier than ever so badly

**Frajer** (8): wait this isn't Dave Matthews

**oscarbrierley1** (8): very cute

**Ambrosia42** (7.6): ok this had some lovely moments

**beeozan** (7.5): the chorus saved it so much

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): definitely the highlight of the non-singles, this random bop surprised me after not feeling most all of the album before it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Harry in the Grammys when his turn table started going the wrong way:

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this could have been way higher but the background vocals kinda ruin the uptempo breakdown

**shipperondeck** (6.7): kind of a predictable metaphor but you know what, he sticks the landing, it's fine

**impla77** (6.6): Nice of Harry to lend the shitty vocoder to Taylor

**Stryxen** (6.5): its nice

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I can‚Äôt believe im saying this but take it down a notch

**Poydoo** (6): These drums are cool I guess but honestly this song is super boring

**vayyiqra** (6): There are so many pop songs with this title I made a ranking of them from best to worst once. Hana's was first of course, and I don't remember what was last but this is ... not the worst one I've ever heard, but also I'm not loving it either. Don't hear why it's said to be the best song here. üè†

**WaneManToc** (6): the visual for this is just a bunch of pedals...dude where tf is the space rock? where is the pedal worship guitar blasts

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Like this was okay but why did it take FOREVER to start like ???

**IIIHenryIII** (5): someone send this shit back to space, where it belongs to

**passionfruits2** (0): i hate this song viscerally bc everytime my best friend picks me up she's playing this song on the car and it's been months already, let it go Julia i beg

**TragicKingdom1** (11): For someone who has paid attention to the Hot 100 for nearly 15 years, my radar for future hits is honestly not very good. But this is one of those songs where on first listen it was sooo apparent how absolutely massive it would be. And it was MASSIVE massive: the music market has become increasingly segmented, meaning we don't typically get songs that everybody is listening to anymore, but this was genuinely inescapable, and for a long time at that. As for the song itself, this just has so much forward momentum to it that I can't help but be drawn in on every listen, no matter what my mood is. The riff might feel stolen from [this rate](https://www.reddit.com/comments/pgkrxx) but it's interspersed SO perfectly to hit every time: especially before the final chorus, where the instrumental pulls back to really let it shine. Harry sounds breathless, but in a way that perfectly compliments the urgency of the rest of the song; it's such a delicate balancing act that it's no wonder that he hasn't been able to replicate it live. All in all, this has the vibes of an immortal hit and I look forward to it outlasting my time on this plane of existence. Hopefully y‚Äôall appreciate it more in All Stars!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the smash hit of this album (and also probably the biggest song in the rate), I think this was a great choice as lead and actually is probably my favourite song on the album. I love how existential it is for something so upbeat and that is perfect radio fodder. The chimes at the end making it more grandiose is an element I love, as a former percussionist in band. Although I do think that he shouldn‚Äôt have won AOTY, I have no issues with this winning pop song at the Grammys as I think it‚Äôs a solidly crafted track that unfortunately probably just attacked retail workers a bit too hard.

---

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): look,,,, it‚Äôs a simple derivative lil pop song but it‚Äôs MY simple derivative lil pop song that I will mourn when it goes out at #10,,,,

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I moved out of my dad's place last year. It came after what seemed like endless bickering over all sorts of things, but when I finally did it I had this unexpected sense of sadness and unease. He lives alone now, and I always get scared of the worst whenever he doesn't pick up the phone (he does this often). All of this is to say this one single, silly little throwaway line in the second verse just shattered me. Yes, this song is a cheap knock-off of actual indie music. Yes, it was THE overplayed song of 2022. But somehow I'm still able to turn on this track and, against all odds, it still sounds as beautiful, moving, and devastating as the day I first heard it.

**1998tweety** (10): I mean come on now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): stop putting children at the start of songs

**Awkward\_King** (10): im afraid he may have actually made the best song of all time right here.. just a bop, you cant help but wiggle to it like he ate it up

**celladonn** (10): i may not love the rest of this album but god this song is so good. it really strikes the perfect melancholy mood

**cremeebrulee** (10): i was kinda whelmed with this on release day but over time it‚Äôs grown on me a lot

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ok he gets to be a bit cunty

**frogaranaman** (10): With the ‚Äúthis song is so generic, anybody could have written this‚Äù critique. Wouldn‚Äôt that contradict itself? The only reason a generic song or generic album is popular is due to the person itself making them interesting. Therefore nobody else could have made it and it gotten that popular. They‚Äôre selling their own music by selling themselves, and as their fanbases make themselves more vocal and bigger, so do they become bigger and more popular. It‚Äôs an inherently capitalist cycle then, and as fans become bigger advocates for the capitol of the top they too become more privy to this capitalist cycle. And these pointless battles we pick online between random songs is just a distraction for popularity and capitol building at the top? All this to say you know it‚Äôs not the same as it was.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it kinda reminds of take on me, but the first song that came to my mind when I listened to this for the first time was, shout out to the TikTok Rate, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR5zpFs7YpY

**jasannn** (10): It really is a part retro, part indie pop hit made to appeal for the masses but it does it so well.

**jay** (10): stand up queup.

**mysario** (10): it was a top 10 hit for 5 years or something for a reason idk I've lost track of time

**RandomHypnotica** (10): its good haters can eat shit

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song dropped and everyone had an opinion on it, except me. This is a song that you hear while running away from something. Theres something about the start of this song that just makes me want to book it and run away from everything and not stop until my legs cant carry my anymore. Everything is around you is a blur and I feel like you have to hear this song while your in motion for it click and im glad i did cause man

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): this does NOT deserve the hate it got on this sub lmao

**throwaway-7650** (10): #THANKYOUSEUNGKWAN

**welcome2thejam** (10): Should consider itself lucky I avoided the radio last year and thus the overplay that hacked my enjoyment of Adore You to bits

**xavieryes** (10): modern classic idc, should've been the 2022 year-end #1

**emayzee** (9.8): it's possible to think a song is a derivative ripoff of like 5 artists combined and still think it's great

**bulforster** (9.5): yah okay this is good

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): this song has provided the title for 92748484 ao3 fics

**dropthehammer11** (9): in terms of all of the recent billion+ plays smash hits this one is one of the better ones imo, its just tightly composed, produced and recorded. beginning to end is a nice catchy wave

**jsonphile** (9): despite hearing this way too much over the past year, I never really got tired of it.

**wailord\_fan** (9): the bells are hella cute

**eldritchdeergod** (8.6): yeah it's everywhere but it's catchy as hell so i don't actually mind

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): it‚Äôs a bop tbh, but i never got that into it

**babadork** (8.5): This is okay, but it isn‚Äôt as good as a song that rips off ‚ÄúTake On Me‚Äù should be..

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I hate myself for liking this but I‚Äôm a sucker for a quirky synth line

**DaHumanTorch** (8.3): when this dropped i found myself excited for the first time ever for a harry album. such a great pop song, my biggest complaint is that we didn't get more of that bridge, it's the best part of the song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this fucking song, for as much as I hate the fact that it got overplayed, reminds me of all the huge changes that happened to me last year and yeah, it makes things better.

**beeozan** (8): not the worst song I kept hearing on radio/cable last year! The grammy ceo daughter stuff is so funny though

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I‚Äôm very fortunate to have a job where I can pick what music I listen to so radio has not ruined this for me. But I also never really LOVED it to begin with.

**Nagisoid** (8): The fact that I generally can't stand songs that get overplayed and I still like this tells you that this is pretty good.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): i dont know if ive just heard this so many times that i have been gaslit into thinking its good, but i genuinly enjoy it so much more than most of the album.

**passionfruits2** (8): from the rubble came a decent song, congrats on the achievement harry styles

**pig-serpent** (8): The only song on this album where the aesthetic is working. I feel like Harry's House is supposed to be depressed and mundane, and the synths do a good job and making you feel like there's a deeper layer than what you're listening to, whereas the rest of the album just sounds bland.

**Poydoo** (8): A solid song, overplay killed it for me though

**Stryxen** (8): girl I hate the intro so much but I can't hate this synth strokes era ripoff at all the hooks are just really good

TragicKingdom1: **darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I hated this until I heard it i a car system. also why does the final chorus kind of have christmas bells??? new christmas classique????

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): [Talk about optics LOL](https://twitter.com/RecordingAcad/status/1622420486356598784)

**Frajer** (7): I'm too neurodivergent for whatever he's doing with the verses

**nt96** (7): this would be an instant 10 if it weren‚Äôt for two things. First, the length, I hate how short it is and second, it‚Äôs ending. I can‚Äôt stand it when songs just end abruptly with no payoff, like some ok game over, try again kind of approach to music. It feels very disingenuous, which is a shame because it‚Äôs a great song.

**TiltControls** (7): she's fine

**impla77** (6.5): This was overplayed to death, but its fine..

**seanderlust** (6.5): the A-Punk of harry's discog - catchy guitar riff, massive hit chartwise...and a song that i have exactly zero feelings about.

**dreamingpastel** (6): An incredibly ok song that, to be honest, overstayed its welcome.

**flava** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2iSVHh_Wn8

**WaneManToc** (6): wasn't this an indie song from 2k4? 2k12? 2k18? oh wait it's landfill radio pop. like it's very sweet but also just totally on auto-pilot. but it doesn't seem absolutely cynical about the sugar rush its reaching for. and I appreciate that! but maybe we need to slow it down more? tease things out.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Harry cosplaying as an indie band was a weird lead single choice but ig it worked

**moonshxne** (5): To its credit, this song's vagueness and derivative sound actually doesn't grate on me! As much, anyway. Maybe it's because the fusion of generic "indie rock" and "Take On Me" is sonically quite seamless, even if rather plain. Anyway, hearing this is like looking at a beige wall with, like, one or two paint splatters.

**plastichaxan** (5): This gets repetitive too fast and it doesn‚Äôt help how much it‚Äôs been played but it‚Äôs not too bad

**vayyiqra** (5): This was really in one ear and out the other sorry Mr. Style I feel nothing. üè†

**hikk** (4): this is just soooo repetitious which is a terrible combo with radio overplay

**DirtyRat583** (3.5): fight or flight ACTIVATE but also hes right. its not the same as it was (its soooo much worse)

**shipperondeck** (1): if i never have to hear this song again i will be grateful for it

**bluehxrizon** (0): in the words of Livia Soprano, "it's all just a big nothing"

**cremeebrulee** (8.877): he got set up a bit ‚ò†Ô∏è sure this album isn‚Äôt groundbreaking, but it‚Äôs a pretty nice, easy, cohesive listen. anyway we deserve a fine line rate!

**eldritchdeergod** (8.654): mandatory 'if the world is against harry's house i'm against the world'--i love this album. it may lean more toward 'least personal album' but the vibes are great and the majority of the tracks stand alone well on their own.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.308): placing this album in between Un Verano Sin Ti and Dawn FM‚Ä¶ rate organizers wanted us to humble ourselves.

**mysario** (8.215): the people are in an anti-Harry era at their moment so this will be slammed more than it deserves; but while the majority of the album is kind of unstellar, the big hits are too good to ignore

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (7.808): purely did this rate just to try and get harry an average album score higher than midnights lol. i totally get people's criticisms of the album and tbh if i did this rate before seeing Harry live it would have scored lower but the concert gave me a great appreciate of some songs.

**Frajer** (7.808): Harry is such a great singer and charming charismatic presence, I know some of y'all will disagree, but I wish he ventured out of his comfort zone more

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.577): Harry Styles is capable of putting a 10/10 song, but unfortunately half this album leans more towards the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù side of soft rock than anything hard hitting. I still believe in him though, he WILL create something better than his current best (s/t) one day.

**jsonphile** (7.500): well it ain‚Äôt better than Beyonc√© that‚Äôs for sure

**akanewasright** (7.346): I don‚Äôt get the hate for this one at all. Like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt love it, but it‚Äôs very much There to me, like Harry did not commit any crimes against music. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff that‚Äôs kind of whatever, but the sub 4 averages are a bit ridiculous

**indie\_fan\_** (7.323): well i'm sure this album's gonna get a good thrashing for what i imagine a good amount of what the other album comments will already say. I don't really care much for Harry himself one way or another Ã∂oÃ∂uÃ∂tÃ∂sÃ∂iÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂fÃ∂ Ã∂hÃ∂iÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂"Ã∂tÃ∂hÃ∂iÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂dÃ∂oÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂nÃ∂'Ã∂tÃ∂ Ã∂hÃ∂aÃ∂pÃ∂pÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂oÃ∂ Ã∂pÃ∂eÃ∂oÃ∂pÃ∂lÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂lÃ∂iÃ∂kÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂vÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂fÃ∂tÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂"Ã∂ Ã∂cÃ∂oÃ∂mÃ∂mÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂fÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂ Ã∂wÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂ Ã∂hÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂wÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂hÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂wÃ∂aÃ∂rÃ∂dÃ∂, so I mostly went in this on a rather neutral standpoint. I think it's a good album for the most part, personally. I guess it is kinda carried by two of the singles, but some of the deep cuts carry some of their own weight as well. But now that this is done, can we rate Fine Line right about fucking now? :pingu:

**IIIHenryIII** (7.308): This is not bad at all. Popheads are just mean towards him for no reason. It‚Äôs also not fair it‚Äôs gonna get one of the worst averages because of the butthut Renaissance stans (sorry if I‚Äôm wrong). Of course the latter is the best album, but just appreciate this for what it is.

**welcome2thejam** (6.923): Some hits, some misses. Suppose gun to my head I'd come down in favor of it in non-Grammy related discourse though

**nt96** (6.692): it‚Äôs‚Ä¶.ok I guess? There‚Äôs high moments and many meh moments.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6.500): this is literally just Fine Line, but more boring.

**slimboyfriend** (6.038): It sounds like watered down Peter Gabriel and Paul Simon which I guess is why the middle aged white men liked it enough to vote it album of the year

**WaneManToc** (6.000): *weeknd voice* this is a harry's house! we are happy! in harry's house! haha what a stupid album. dude does whiter than white pop played SUPER safe and pleasant when you stand 50 ft away from yr boombox reading. and in all honesty, while I could sit here and actually try to rank cuts i LIKE more than cuts i TOLERATE, I think the brutal 6/10'ing here sends a clear message about Harry's music. This is a total 6/10 across the board that does what it needs to do and shouldn't take any shit. it ruled he won a grammy for making a 6/10 that 6/10 grammys would like! my mom fucks with this. it's more goddamn agreeable than any bullshit NPR is forcing me to listen to. i like it

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.885): If I have to praise Harry‚Äôs House for one thing it‚Äôs that it makes pretty damn good wallpaper music. Like in the background, it‚Äôs not grating to the ears, it passes by smoothly without any attention paid at all, it actually sounds passingly more than pleasant. The *problem* comes when you actually listen to the music hard: after a promising start, the album proves to be chock-full of disposable, plain, remarkably unremarkable songs that you can‚Äôt help but forget the moment the next one plays. If Harry was going to write a pop album he should‚Äôve written catchier melodies, and if he was going to write a rock album he should‚Äôve experimented harder with his production choices. Instead we are left with the worst of both worlds‚Äîand not to say this album is even bad or anything, but for one of the biggest pop stars in the universe, he really could‚Äôve stood to serve something that isn‚Äôt so wholly bland and forgettable. I really have to wonder how some critics actually ate this up too, and the fact that this beat RENAISSANCE for Album of the Year is honestly just another tarnish to its already thin legacy.

**Stryxen** (5.885): I enjoy the concept of a landfill-on-arrival album that indulges the need for throwaway dated rock tribute and predictable hooks but I have a feeling he didn't intend the perfect meta execution this stumbled upon. [Alternate comment: Harry's Hole]

**bulforster** (5.808): nothing really atrocious here, just kinda hollow and unengaging

**Poydoo** (5.731): This album is boring as hell, am I seriously supposed to rate this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.615): A bit more mellow and lamer than I anticipated. There were some pretty decent cuts on it though I tell you what.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.538): It's like if a boardroom tried to come up with an "indie" record. That's the only way I can describe it. There are some good tracks on this album, but there's also too many moments that scream "commercial" to me.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.385): i hadn't listened to this since it came out so i was kind of detached from the grammys drama. after listening to the album all the backlash was fully deserved. its one of the most boring and formulaic albums.

**pig-serpent** (5.346): The fact that Harry Styles is good at music and his weird, outsider artist persona come into odds with his need for popularity and to play it safe, and it results in a competent album that is almost completely aestheticless, which is rough because music is an inherently aesthetic medium.

**impla77** (5.285): I like Fine Line (its a solid 7 for me), this album is a downgrade imo. The biggest problem is Harry‚Äôs lack of presence on pretty much every track, his vocals feel very flat to me throughout the whole album (a problem I didn‚Äôt have with Fine Line). Melodies are often catchy, production saccharine but mostly effective, but the lyrics are bad.. I‚Äôm not sure how much growth Harry has as an artist unfortunately, but he‚Äôs doing alright so what do I know.

**bluehxrizon** (5.077): harry's music exists under so many layers of carefully constructed branding and art direction that it obscures the fact that this could really be a shawn mendes album

**DirtyRat583** (5.038): does anyone know where harry's house is i need to avoid the city

**vayyiqra** (5.000): So much unbearable discourse about Mr. Style. I think myself that he is not so interesting as to warrant this much. Likewise I find this album is not interesting enough to talk about at length. It's not even that bad, it's just there. I guess the colour of Mr. Style's house is beige. üè†

TragicKingdom1: **Ambrosia42** (4.915): it has a few bops, but overall it is just a bit reductive and unremarkable

**Nagisoid** (4.846): This is really basic but not offensively bad. Some tracks stodd out to me, like Cinema and Satellite, and of course we all have heard As It Was dozens of times, for better or worse. Even though these standouts do exist most of the album is either forgettable or downright insultingly bad. It does not help that it cannot live to the expectation of winning AOTY over Beyonc√©, of all things! Fine Line is a way better project and rating this first just feels like a massive setup. His indie pop/soft rock pastiches grow old fast and most of this feels very wallpapery and mallcore. At least it's short.

**hikk** (4.846): have really never been able to get into harry at all... his debut was trying so hard to emulate dadrock which i hated so much - everything after that has been a tad more tolerable for me, but instead of giving me hives it rather just has me so bored. sonically it just feels like the most vanilla music u could possibly create, and he's not putting forth any good melodies (so many of these songs are just mind-numbingly reptetitive, in a bad way) nor is he writing good lyrics (i'm no snob about them really at all but let's be real, they are..... something...), so in my onion there's really nothing noteworthy here.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the lead song for the Swedish House Mafia album, this song was also added onto the alternate world version of the album, hence why it is here. SHM did not mess around here on this track, and the Weeknd is at his most toxic here for sure, which might be a turn off for some listeners. However I think it is a bop where all the elements of the song work so well together.

---

**DirtyRat583** (11): choosing to rate the extended mix and ooooohhhhhhhhhhh it is so good

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): And for a brief moment in 2022 I thought to myself, Swedish House Mafia are finally back baby! (and then the album dropped and they were, unfortunately, not.)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): they make good soundtrack music

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is a great song to end the album, in my opinion at least.

**bluehxrizon** (10): should have been on the standard album. I love how the chords only hit on the offbeat

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is so good like woah‚Ä¶

**jackisboredtoday** (10): had a few months last year where this song was hitting WAY too close to home, it was an odd time. Song‚Äôs great though

**jay** (10): lemme swing my hips and by association shake my ass

**mysario** (10): frantically typing up a whole thing that says Swedish House Mafia is the main artist on Spotify until I realized this was a bonus track

**throwaway-7650** (10): if you don't give this a 10 you hate pop music [2]

**eldritchdeergod** (9): shouldn't have been relegated to a bonus track it's the best song on the album

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): I mean, it's the Swedish House Mafia and The Weeknd. A perfect combo in my book.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): man‚Ä¶

**CrimsonROSET** (8): swedish house mafia has not done anything wrong ever (source: I like don‚Äôt you worry child)

**jasannn** (8): I love the chord progression but I wish it led to something bigger.

**Nagisoid** (8): Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby üòî

**shipperondeck** (8): "i let you go from time" bothers me so much. like all the lyrics in this song are so straightforward and understandable... except that line, wtf does it even mean? "FROM time"?? besides that it's a good song

**TiltControls** (8): that's our lamp

**vayyiqra** (8): Good closer Mr. Weeknd! üìª

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The Weeknd continues to confuse me‚Ä¶ the pop star with some of the most sexist toxic masculine lyrics and yet he's able to serve them in the most slay cunty-sounding bops

**WaneManToc** (8): omg big fan of bonuses

**welcome2thejam** (8): The king of adultery bops does it again!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): fire has always scared me

**Stryxen** (7.5): now let's get the chairlift Moth rate

**Ambrosia42** (7.2): not the most interesting, but pretty good

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): chairlift kinda out-moth to a flame‚Äôd

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): I‚Äôm embarrassed that my third favorite song from this album isn‚Äôt even on the album and is also a Swedish House Mafia song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Sure.

**bulforster** (7): cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7): please, hosts, play Moth‚Äôs Wings after this

**impla77** (7): I‚Äôve listened to too much of The Weeknd for this to feel novel

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (7): ngl it's alot better than alot of the album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): popheads when lana releases her 200th sleepy downtempo song:

**Poydoo** (5): Mid as hell

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): yawn

**pig-serpent** (2.5): Swedish House Mafia appeared out of nowhere in 2013 to save pop music from the over the top mess it had become, and in turn every producer started using colorless and boring progressive house synths and 2013 became one of the dullest years of pop music. Now we're bringing them back to do the same thing again, proving that we as a species will never learn from out mistakes.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): out of all the songs on the album, this may have my favorite production moments. It‚Äôs so chaotic and bright and pure 80‚Äôs fun. The Weeknd is his typical brooding self, desperate for attention from a girl who doesn‚Äôt care, which you either like or dislike, and for me the melodies really shine here alongside the work OPN/Max Martin/SHF did.

---

**throwaway-7650** (11): the way I thought I would 11 out of time/<0 but then this barreled in with a steel chair when it suddenly hit me one day

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): They should teach this song in schools in how to write a catchy as fuck hook 101

**AHSWeeknd** (10): better to add an interlude at the end instead of keeping the song under 3 minutes

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): easily one of my favorite songs off this rate, it sounds so overwhelming that it just makes you glitch out of reality and dance like you're on a ketamine high.

**bluehxrizon** (10): he asked himself this question after the rolling stone article and decided the best solution was "U MAD BRO?" posting

**cremeebrulee** (10): i need that instrumental outro as a separate track it‚Äôs sooooo good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): he put his whole PUSSY in this

**jay** (10): lemme back it up like a tonka truck

**moonshxne** (10): i said

**Poydoo** (10): We're going back in time üèáüèáüéø

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what if I told you I was a mastermind

**shipperondeck** (10): anyone else hung up on mushroom tea? tf is that? i hate mushrooms so that sounds gross

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): maybe she'd like you if you shelve "The Idol"

**WaneManToc** (10): its hysterical that they made an animated music video to this that's just mr. weeknd turning into the baby weeknd; the baby planters marketing campaign desperately needed this kind of energy to work! also the sweedish house mafia

**welcome2thejam** (10): The build up to the first chorus is perfection, its shifting the gear and accelerating to light speed

**DirtyRat583** (9.9): not a 10 because i overplayed it too much

**jackisboredtoday** (9.4): still kind of unreal that this guy went from singing stuff like Initiation to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you mushroom tea‚Äù

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): king of narcissism anthems

**Frajer** (9): I love the vibe so much

**impla77** (9): its giving the cyberpunk flavour

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): I SAY!!!

**vayyiqra** (9): "The Weeknd enters the dance-pop genre" you're a bit late lol. Anyway feel like being a pedant briefly: yeah the right spelling is "faze"; I know it looks dumb but it's true. üìª

**akanewasright** (8.5): a bop, but it‚Äôs just a cute moment between smashas

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): a bop, and then the way it transitions into take my breath, ooh

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the ten seconds of take my breath at the end irrationally annoys me, like just move the end point of the song so it only contains this song.

**seanderlust** (8.5): the SHM production EATS here

**celladonn** (8): songs that make you wish you were drinking mushroom tea

**CrimsonROSET** (8): idk wear deodorant

**mysario** (8): I do think the song suffers a bit using its end part as trying to set up for "Take My Breath"

**Nagisoid** (8): Beggin' (Abel's Version)

**1998tweety** (7): me @ Sett.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): this was very malewife of him

**IIIHenryIII** (7): that transition though‚Ä¶

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This album is in constant slay mode

**eldritchdeergod** (6.8): drags a bit

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5.5): the transition is the best part of this song lol the chorus is pretty boring ngl

**apatel27** (5): ew the Swedish House Mafia generic build and drop

**pig-serpent** (4): High end synthwave beat, but that hook is annoying.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): its not that hard just send a shirtless pic and laugh at my jokes tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (10): kicking off the album we have a reggaeton cut! And I think it was definitely a good choice for one of the first singles. I think the melody is infectious and one of my favourites from the album. This song isn‚Äôt deep at all it‚Äôs basically Bad Bunny wanting to hook up with a mysterious girl but you know what, sometimes it truly just be like that.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): This never quite clicked with me, and I contend that it's a weird pick for a lead single. It definitely captures the wistful beachy vibes of the album while still being a bop but I think the hook is pretty weak. Honestly the bridge where it slows down a bit is catchier and would've made for an interesting anti-chorus. We demand the TK cut!!

---

**bigbigbee** (11): This song changed my standard drink order for like 2 months straight‚Ä¶the combination of lime and ginger beer WHEW

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I may not know what he‚Äôs saying, but it‚Äôs a whole bop.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I really like this song for some reason.

**Awkward\_King** (10): 8.55 inches long. 3.75 inches wide. uncut. curves slightly to the left. tip is F7BFD3 pink, shaft is a creamy brown. four distinct veins with the longest ranging from the base to the tip on the middle right side. excretion is macaroon cream and hes trimmed but not clean shaven.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ‚ÄúWhatsApp with no portrait‚Äù this horny ass song and suddenly that line. I know WhatsApp is huge everywhere but the US, but it‚Äôs funny when my personal WhatsApp experience is messaging my Jamaican aunties lkdskldsl

**frogaranaman** (10): the second I heard this song I knew I was gonna be drinking all summer

**IIIHenryIII** (10): tastier than the drink

**ImADudeDuh** (10): he got super naked for the video and I salute him

**jasannn** (10): despair anthem

**seanderlust** (10): okay i will try my best to not make all these comments just me thirsting over bad bunny but like...how hot do you have to be to be playing benito like this tbh

**vayyiqra** (10): Love the echo on his voice in the bridge. Has anyone tried a Moscow Mule with the copper mug and everything? Because they look good. Why have I not done this? I've been allowed to drink for over a decade. üèñÔ∏è

**WaneManToc** (10): sir im having a yeunling "black & tan" rn. yup beer in the american south BREWED IN FUCKING PENNSYLVANIA still calls itself this

**xavieryes** (10): This song is fucking great, how did I not remember that? Maybe I just wasn't paying attention because I was too focused on his ass in the MV.

**akanewasright** (9.5): the actual best mixed drink, one of the best ways to make vodka taste good

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): lovely summery vibes

**bulforster** (9.5): Apparently people don't think this was the right song to lead off the album cycle? They are wrong.

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): what an opener what a SMASH

**TiltControls** (9.5): I remember listening to this for jukebox and being instantly hooked. still as good as ever

**shipperondeck** (9.2): such a good summer song, perfect opener to the album and season

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ooooh I could go for a Moscow Mule right now

**1998tweety** (8.5): hold awn this album is better than I was expecting

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): rating non English albums is so fun because I‚Äôll listen to a song and feel so heartbroken and then look up the lyrics and it‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm horny and you look so good naked‚Äù

**Stryxen** (8.5): I just ate so much Let me rate this album and try not to dance too much

**DirtyRat583** (8): cute opener

**flava** (8): Bunny Talk To Russia - Prince

**jay** (8): est√° bien, es lindo

**pig-serpent** (8): I think Bad Bunny's singing is always overlooked, and I get it, but his voice is actually strong when it comes to showing sadness and it helps his sad songs go that extra mile.

**Poydoo** (8): a vibe

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This man sounds sad

**welcome2thejam** (8): "An actually fun water level" type beat

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): So if this is a summer based record why do the synths sound so icy‚Äîoh wait yeah right.

**Nagisoid** (7): The ending section is very cool but the rest of the song is vibes

**throwaway-7650** (6.9): kind of expected more for the opener tbh tad disappointed

**eldritchdeergod** (6.8): strong album opener vibes-wise but didn't feel very memorable

**beeozan** (6): bad bunny in this mv: I don't dress for women, I don't dress for men. I don't dress

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): Ngl i don‚Äôt get the popularity of this song versus the others

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5.5): this is fine but doesn't do much for me besides the first verse.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I pulled up the English translations so that I could actually make comments for this album and, as a very non-horny person, this might not be the most relatable album for me. Anyway yeah this one is kinda boring‚Ä¶

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): I've kinda given up on the popheads brand of female indie pop (as in, I didn't even get around to listening to Preacher's Daughter or Blue Rev) because everyone trying to be mysterious and ethereal made it blend together too much for me. This song is randomly in that vein (even being a collab with one such band) but adds some snapping and clapping that keeps it from being too background music-y. It's not mindblowing but did end up on my beach playlist last summer. That being said how did this make the top 10 for the whole rate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this is another nice track. Honestly I‚Äôm glad he had female vocalists on here because it makes it a good change of pace compared to other songs, and they all sounds wonderful

---

**vayyiqra** (11): I love the Mar√≠as and listened to them a lot last year, and couldn't see them because their Toronto show was sold out weirdly fast (didn't think they were that popular). So here they go! üèñÔ∏è

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this album is such a vibe

**Awkward\_King** (10): why is there a random indie rock song on this album HELLOOOOO

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh we love the mari√°s

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): indie music!!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): he made the perfect lazy pool day song AND with my queens? immediate yes

**IIIHenryIII** (10): no women allowed in the men‚Äôs rate üò°

**jay** (10): okayyyyyy

**Nagisoid** (10): The Mar√≠as outsold Virgin Mary so hard they're taking her spot in Heaven with this song

**Poydoo** (10): We love an indie pop king üòç

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): truly adore the whole vibe of this song

**WaneManToc** (10): uh oh mami! oh fuck yes gimme that big WONKY energies. super streamlined head bopper n' foot stomper. and there's a lady harmonizing with da bunny?! this is basically puerto rican beach house.

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): this is nice

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): I enjoy The Mar√≠as and this song is just lovely

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): (delusionally) this is how we rate CINEMA by The Marias!!

**jasannn** (9.5): Time to Pretend meets Passionfruit meets Bad Bunny

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Stream The Mar√≠as @everyone

**impla77** (9.4): try not to say mami challenge (impossible)

**apatel27** (9): Bad Bunny's best songs are the ones where he can play off someone

**beeozan** (9): took the M and T out of Rosalia's album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Yeah I think overall I like the second half of this album better than the first.

**Frajer** (9): this feels like it's soundtracking an indie movie

**oscarbrierley1** (9): this is a nice welcome change of sound. stands out even this late in the loooonnnggg tracklist.

**welcome2thejam** (9): A Bad Bunny indie pop album is suddenly way more in reach than I ever expected

**throwaway-7650** (8.9): miss hwasa WISHES she was as latina as The Mar√≠as

**emayzee** (8.8): popheads will give this the highest score off the album because it features a woman's voice

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**akanewasright** (8.5): I‚Äôm too used to hitting the button to rewind to el apag√≥n when I hear the intro to this song, this song also rules

**pig-serpent** (8.5): I like the slow warping of all the sounds going on with this song.

**shipperondeck** (8.2): very mar√≠as in a good way

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): An actually good one wow

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): it sounds like a sadder version of Calm Down from Selena Gomez.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I absolutely love this song and the Depache Mode / Pet Shop Boys influence on this. On first listen I was like, ‚Äúthis is weird with this voice‚Äù but it has grown on me and I love how he stepped outside the typical synth pop box on this. The lyrics ooze classic Weeknd and I think has some really fun lyrics to shout along to

---

**moonshxne** (11): i mean

**passionfruits2** (11): maybe his best song after House of Balloons

**pig-serpent** (11): The perfect blend of conventional and weird for pop music. The voice he does is excellent, the clicking in the beat is great, and the chorus is odd at first but it's a hell of a hook. This should've been massive.

**Poydoo** (11): My mind is actually blown by how good this song is holy shit

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Only so many times Abel can sing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in pain‚Äù/‚ÄúI‚Äôve fallen into emptiness‚Äù/etc. and I‚Äôm like ‚Äòhe‚Äôs just like me fr except I‚Äôm poor and drugless‚Äô :/

**AHSWeeknd** (10): he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll die, but you commit arson‚Äù

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): yass, burn my body daddy if I'm dead after being naughty.

**Awkward\_King** (10): im sorry this eats so hard, abel can be so camp when he wants and this is an amazing moody pop track

**beeozan** (10): I really love the vocal effect its like darkwave weeknd

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPbVRpRgHso&t=35s

**bluehxrizon** (10): that rolling one-note synth that circles around the mix... . I love the line "it's 5am, i'm nihilist, I know there's nothing after this" in context of a concept album about driving to the afterlife

**DaHumanTorch** (10): he had a vision and i see that vision perfectly

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): HAIM song also a 10

**dreamingpastel** (10): Everything Everywhere All At Once-core

**hikk** (10): halsey cleared

**IIIHenryIII** (10): did he just outsell HAIM?

**jay** (10): lemme shake my ass like a buzzing bee

**Nagisoid** (10): GASOLINE ON FIRE!!! STREAM ANTIFRAGILE

**plastichaxan** (10): That vocal processing scratches a part in my brain I love it it gives me that buzz

**Stryxen** (10): Kylie Minogue body talk has sons

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): a number one hit in 1984

**WaneManToc** (10): "It's 5 AM and i'm nihilist" is way too on the nose man, you could suggest this line via details not just go straight for the rush; you did it 11 years back. but also herein lies our starting point and we already know that. Watching the video for this, I'm amazed at not only how badly Abel wants to be a pop star, but how badly he wants a windowlicker of any sorts. The grim monster faces are immediate callbacks to the all-timer Aphex video, but Abel isn't doing a 1 to 1 rip-off here; they're just details in his supercallifragalisticsadamasochistic club horror show. Party hauntology is the baseline here and accomplished with high finesse. Anyways though this will probably be the one comment I go long on this album for and I want to give both a tip of my hat and "larry, I think you are trying to be too woke" to Larry Fitzmaurice's fascinating dissection of Dawn FM from February of 2022; it's a good read from someone looking big picture while also still calling out just how blatantly shitty abel's character portrayals of sex and power dynamics are. I gave immense whopping praise to House of Balloons because it really did catch me as a catch-all album that signifying a real vibe shift in aesthetics, while also tip-toeing around the lyrics and content of the album (grim shit). They're awful depictions of horny across the album, but I let it go because it represented a lived in depressive hedonsim hellfire for Abel; Larry thinks a lotta folks in 2k11 did too and that if someone made this now, you'd have some critics taking baseball bats to it. Abel's been grandfathered in to some extent, and somehow he still refuses to write lyrics that are not going to be in some shape or form, "blithely uncomf" to a listener (apparently he's still coming around to learning the concept of pansexuality as of a 2019 cut). He opens the album here with this cut with the "I wrap my hands around your neck/ You love it when I always squeeze," and down the line we get Take My Breath. dude's not gonna hide this shit but here it does sound chipper for certain. Anyways, i appreciate how larry seems to get really caught up on this line to the point he writes '"The best-case scenario you can envision here is that Tesfaye is embracing some sort of‚ÄîGod help me‚Äîsex-positive perspective regarding consensual choking during sex. *But calling The Weeknd "sex-positive" is like saying climate change simply hydrates low-lying areas‚Äîin other words, a preposterous excuse to make for someone who has made a career out of visceral and often unsettling depictions of sexual encounters between men and women.*"' Every time I read this I both cackle at the need to re-assert this point with such a colossal metaphor and yet find it to be an immensely potent reading of Abel's inability to get beyond these sketches over a decade later; only a music critic with a new york brain would do this but I gotta hand it to him. It's a brighter cut be he's STILL in these cycles. and yet i can't help but give it a 10, i can't help but feel the party hauntology that was there on the mixtapes is finally mutating. and goodness what a sound this cut holds

**Frajer** (9.5): Morrissey found dead in a ditch

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): cocaine, champagne etc.

**shipperondeck** (9.2): honestly a fan of the bad british accent because i think british people deserve to be mocked at all times

**Ambrosia42** (9): One of the more interesting songs on here maybe and it‚Äôs a vibe

**cremeebrulee** (9): the first verse of this made me a bit nervous on release night but once that chorus hit, i realized it was a bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Idk who this British guy is but this is a bop

**dropthehammer11** (8): the voice change is fresh and it works, its cool

**jsonphile** (8): daddy yankee outsold

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (8): this chorus and production did actually deserve more

**vayyiqra** (8): This does not sound like Abel but it sounds cool wait now it sounds like him good. üìª

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): this is easily a tier below the sacrifice/out of time/<0[/etc.] tier

**jasannn** (7.5): old man abel gotta shut up

**mysario** (7.5): would rather listen to indie song "Gasolina"

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is a Bo Burnham song

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): üëà this man is losing his religion

**eldritchdeergod** (7): weeknd patented bop

**frogaranaman** (7): what I sound like when I‚Äôm trying to sound masc

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i understand why this was not a hit

**oscarbrierley1** (7): weird english? accent feels unneccessary. other songs on the album do more interesting synth pop, but its not bad

**welcome2thejam** (7): Mixed feelings on what they're doing with his voice in the verses, but the chorus is a certified bop

**impla77** (6.7): the vocals are giving something

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): gotta say, I‚Äôm not a fan of his accent roulette on this album

**1998tweety** (6): this has some boppy moments, but I feel like the chorus could've done a bit more

**bulforster** (6): it's not just that I don't really like the voice thing but I'm also disappointed bc I feel like a much harder hitting song could come from this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): For some reason his delivery here reminds me of David Byrne from the Talking Heads. Not sure why?

**ricki** (4): he wants to be halsey so bad

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love the city pop incorporation here and just how light and airy this is (his vocals are some of the best on this song too). Author real time note: I experienced bad turbulence on my flight towards the end of this song and when Jim Carey was speaking‚Ä¶ 0 out of 10 wouldn‚Äôt recommend ‚Ä¶almost considered docking points from this

---

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): not only is this magnificent as fuck because of the city-pop vibes and the sample, but it also made me cry a lot because it reminds me of a friend who I really like, but it was too late for me to tell them that I like their company with me.

**jasannn** (11): i want someone to sing karaoke with me like that

**AHSWeeknd** (10): fans listen to this song say ‚Äúomg such a happy song!‚Äù Bestie please read the lyrics

**bluehxrizon** (10): stan Tomoko Aran

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the citypop sample is fun, this just sounds like black cookout music lol. vibes, abel! hell yea

**DirtyRat583** (10): weebs may have a point

**frogaranaman** (10): that sampleeeee

**hikk** (10): something something city pop rate

**jay** (10): OKAYYYY LEMME STAND UP

**jsonphile** (10): veeery close to being my 11. This song is just such a vibe and The Weeknd has never sounded better than he does here

**moonshxne** (10): chefs kiss

**Nagisoid** (10): This song is so good it got my 10 despite the pretty cringy Jim Carrey outro. The city pop sample blends in seamlessly with the rest of the track and I think this song has Abel's best vocal performance in the album. It's just so catchy and soothing, always lifts my mood a bit. Also it has some of his less male-manipulation core lyrics on the album, so that's a plus.

**Poydoo** (10): Best flute of the year by far

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Remember when he teamed up with MISCHF to release this on a vinyl record that doubled as a saw blade? That was weird innit? There were probably a lot of better song choices though. (Though then again, MSCHF are well-known for doing, well, mischievous things). Song is a banger of course.

**throwaway-7650** (10): is this shoegaze?

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I‚Äôve LOVED this song ever since I heard it on the radio. Why wasn‚Äôt this the breakthrough hit??

**WaneManToc** (10): POV: you won a round of karaoke with the weeknd but he's deep in his feelings now and wants to sing a song about working on being a better perso-PSYCH! you got jim carey'd ya goop!

**welcome2thejam** (10): You know I'm handing the stunning Weeknd city pop track the double digits, there was never any doubt

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): Jim Carrey‚Äôs televangelism lost this song half a point

**nt96** (9.5): great use of the sample

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): i love disco üòç

**1998tweety** (9): yetti and tk when I hand my ballot in 3 days past the deadline

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Me when I‚Äôm dreaming and I haven‚Äôt done any of my assignments and it‚Äôs the end of the semester.

**celladonn** (9): we love city pop samples

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): you can hear how Abel admits MJ‚Äôs singing at certain words in this song though it‚Äôs almost entirely unrelated song. But also I saw people thing this is about someone still being hung up on him when I feel like it‚Äôs very obviously about dumping someone who wanted you to stay and later you realize is better off with out you and probably wouldn‚Äôt taken you back? At least before Truman comes on

**shipperondeck** (9): my ex was (i assume still is) extremely out of touch with modern pop music but loved city pop, so i played him this song bc of its sample and he nerded out a bit lol it was sweet

**vayyiqra** (9): The Tomoko Aran album this is from was neat! I will go back to it after this ballot is done, thanks for reminding me of it Mr. Weeknd. üìª

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): It‚Äôs just Too Little Too Late for him isn‚Äôt it

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is so pretty and twinky-I MEANT TWINKLY

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): hell yea

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): ok but this is my pet peeve with radio. They'll like be like "commercial free hour!!" and then advertise themselves

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): https://y.yarn.co/42eb0c29-8338-4b39-8f6e-096890b93259_text.gif

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me in majora‚Äôs mask doing my first run

**Frajer** (8): I feel like he's gaslighting me

**impla77** (7.7): another safe bop.. also shut up jim carrey

**bulforster** (7.5): this is nice but I think it would work better if it was more of a rest break after a more (successfully) bombastic opening run of tracks

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): not this reminding me of city pop‚Ä¶

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): he‚Äôs so goofy like why is his ass making city pop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): its nice but the kaytranada remix kinda replaced the original for me for a reason

**beeozan** (6): the original is genuinely so much more interesting that it puts me off this

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (4): the vocals are great but honestly the song is kind of boring??

**eldritchdeergod** (3.4): would've been higher but jim carrey jumpscare!! scary scary i was very scared

**IIIHenryIII** (3): then don‚Äôt make me waste more of my time on shit like this

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the beginning of this song is a bit slow to build up, but when the beat changes and it becomes a meregue song, it‚Äôs very infectious with some insane production moments. This would definitely go off in a festival or party, and I love how he tackled this genre. The only thing other than the beginning for me is how poorly the one guy clapping is mixed in (or maybe he‚Äôs clapping into the mic)‚Ä¶ like once you notice it you can‚Äôt notice it (so on headphones is very obvious).

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Wikipedia tells me this is a merengue and mambo song, which are two genres that I (shockingly) have zero knowledge of. I think in the context of the album it's a bit weird to have it this early (it would be a great cathartic finale, for example) and structurally I think the second part stretches a bit too long. But the instrumental is super fun and more than makes up for those issues with one of the more sonically unique hits the USA has seen in recent years.

---

**babadork** (11): I‚Äôm obviously going to be drawn to the song with a retro influence, but I also like Bad Bunny best when he‚Äôs getting a little weird.

**impla77** (11): This was really fun

**static\_int\_husp** (11): These horns give me life tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (10): go off horns!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it sounds weird at first but it gets better.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Benito please I am on the bus can you STOP making me want to shake ass indescribably

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the trumpets having more of a presence on this song than Lana did on Snow on the Beach

**frogaranaman** (10): Zumba? as in the exercise classes that play Pitbull?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): he ended M. Night Shyamalan with that twist

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song is so catchy and idk why it‚Äôs not talked about more

**jay** (10): chica esto me transport√≥ de vuelta a la escuela primaria omfg

**jsonphile** (10): when this song kicks in, it‚Äôs one of the best moments in music

**nt96** (10): MERENGUE!!!!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): This song making me physically need to go to the beach omg

**Poydoo** (10): Easily the standout from this album. My second choice for my 11

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): So fun and bouncy!!! Instant party starter right here! Best song on the album by far.

**Stryxen** (10): takes a special song to make me nostalgic for 2022

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): debating leaving work 5 hours early to start drinking rum now

**TiltControls** (10): this is just a blast

**WaneManToc** (10): im watching the vr of this and I have to wonder if Bad Bunny is aware of the tenth season of On Cinema

**dreamingpastel** (9.8): AY AY AY!!!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): this song is an all out party

**seanderlust** (9.5): sometimes you just need three minutes of someone going absolutely HAM on a trumpet

**shipperondeck** (9.5): WOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAHOOOO YEAHHHHHH WAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): the energy picks up and it‚Äôs a fun time

**indie\_fan\_** (9): el hizo este canci√≥n para los fiestas dominicanos y nadie me puede decir diferente

**throwaway-7650** (9): GOTA DE BATIDO. n√¶vis? ¬°vocaci√≥n!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): My hips are shaking and I can't stop

**welcome2thejam** (9): "Old school JRPG world exploring" type beat until it isn't, gotta love the switch-up

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): ok i see you.. i see you.. lets go to the beach beach lets go get away king

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): thank god Beyonc√© invented surfboards in 2013

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Okay NOW we‚Äôre rooting and tooting!

**bluehxrizon** (8): the first minute of this I was like okay and at 1:10 I was like OKAAYY

**dropthehammer11** (8): love the switch up of course

**vayyiqra** (8): I haven't been to the beach in about 5 years and it is getting warm here at last so that is sounding awfully good right now! üèñÔ∏è

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): is this like the reggaeton equivalent of hyperpop

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): i love how he pronouces ‚Äúdespues"‚Ä¶ idk if that‚Äôs just a puerto rican spanish accent but it‚Äôs so pleasing

**Frajer** (7.5): let's go to the beach beach

**jasannn** (7.5): i need the pop men to have more fun like this song

**eldritchdeergod** (7.1): i found this one more interesting sonically

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Okayyy funkiest horn section in Puerto Rico

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I love the genre switch up

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): that instrumental is so funky‚Ä¶ heck‚Ä¶

**pig-serpent** (7): Why does this sound like a live bonus track instead of the 2nd song on an album?

**apatel27** (6): The mambo breakdown is nice i guess

**oscarbrierley1** (6): i want to like this, but i dont really

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6): it's a bop but not my fave

**moonshxne** (5.3): Just as "Moscow Mule"'s sleepy summertime beat lulled me into a trance, the blaring synths punctuating this song's start jolted me awake. I was GAGGED; I thought I'd accidentally queued that one Rebecca Black song. But, to my disappointment, Bad Bunny starting droning over the production. (To this day, I have no idea what Rebecca Black song I was reminded of. And the part after the switch-up sounds a bit muffled.)

**celladonn** (5): i appreciate the genre shift here unfortunately i just don't think it sounds that good

**Nagisoid** (3): I was liking the more chillwavey section in the beginning but it goes downhill when the song decides to become merengue, which is not a genre Bad Bunny sells for me here. He sounds like an outsider in his own instrumental. It doesn't help that the instrumental in question has horns that are almost just Sushi Restaurant bad.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the lead single that never was the hit it could have been! I absolute love this song and how it‚Äôs a homage to old school dance and disco with the extended synth build up (he said fuck doing a short song). The hook as usual is fantastic and I wish this actually was a hit.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): This burned pretty quickly for me (and the GP I guess) because it peaks at the beginning of the first verse. I get the sense that they thought they had a smash on their hands with the "take my BREATH! away..." but that hook is not nearly enough to carry a song

---

**emayzee** (11): there are countless reasons why i hate america and them letting this masterpiece of a song flop is one of them

**hikk** (11): the lukewarm response to this song was so lame like ouuu it's too good sorry

**Nagisoid** (11): [insert stan twitter meme about Chl√∂e breathing-moaning]

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): This album has quite a few 11 contenders but I think this one deserves it the most. Such an amazing song, Max Martin and co did such a dope job here. The extended version is a treat.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Not gonna let anyone gaslight me when I say this deserved to be as big a hit as Blinding Lights, yes I said it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the Giorgio Moroder influence always gives me life

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): an underappreciated erotic but exotic anti-asphyxiation anthem.

**Ambrosia42** (10): The bop is bopping and I love it within the album

**beeozan** (10): should‚Äôve been in Top Gun Maverick instead of OneFloplic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Take my breath Mermaid Man voice awaAAaaaAaAAaaAAAay!

**bluehxrizon** (10): unfortunately this was absorbed in the womb by its sister Blinding Lights

**cremeebrulee** (10): he‚Äôs so hot for putting the extended version on the album‚Ä¶ when he starts breathing over the bridge fucjkfhskjdhrsejrhsj34nkj23hjkrl1l3

**CrimsonROSET** (10): where are you taking it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): -deeply inhales- TAKE MY BREATH! AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): hell yeah

**frogaranaman** (10): isn‚Äôt it wild that people collectively went like ‚Äúno. I need the longer version of this in the album. I need to hear more of this shit‚Äù and so Abel went ‚Äúokay lol‚Äù and put it in the album? like damn people REALLY fucking love that beat

**jay** (10): lemme make this ass clap like a movie just ended

**oscarbrierley1** (10): so catchy, theres so many details in the song that just make it really interesting to listen to.

**plastichaxan** (10): Oh I hope none of my besties decided to 0 this haha that would be so‚Ä¶ untasteful of them like

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it DID take my breath!

**seanderlust** (10): coolest transition on the planet i swear

**throwaway-7650** (10): if you don't give this a 10 you hate pop music

**vayyiqra** (10): Alright yeah the synthwave bit is working here! This rules. üìª

**WaneManToc** (10): so is this ditty pro-vac bed? is it pro-whippets? is it pro...you know, the matrix? anyways it absolutely blows me away just how fucking SLICK this cut is. Max Martin and Abel are in lockstep here

**welcome2thejam** (10): Divorced with time from the "it's Blinding Lights 2" feeling it got at release, I can 100% confirm this goes hard as hell

**shipperondeck** (9.6): better than the single version (which was already good)

**dropthehammer11** (9): extended version brings this up at least a full point

**jsonphile** (9): choke me daddy

**pig-serpent** (9): I have a thing for songs that sound metaphorical but are in fact completely literal.

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): where do i audition to be the girl thats choking him with her braids

**Frajer** (8.5): this feels like a remix of the radio edit

**impla77** (8.4): this is funky but I am irrationally annoyed by ‚Äòbaby says‚Äô.. i need a pronoun there babes

**1998tweety** (8): intro is a bit long but the song bops

**dreamingpastel** (8): Shout out to Ex-Acts Rate for using this song as an interlude and making me associate it with Selena Gomez forevermore

**eldritchdeergod** (8): this should've been bigger as a single. the album version goes on for too long and i prefer the single cut

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it was set to a great start but then it lost me, never mind, that instrumental breakdown got me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I ordered the cd single of this the week it was released and when it arrived the case was broken and then when the album came out I ordered it from his store because I assumed that ugly ass album was gonna be the only one available at retail only to learn everywhere changed to it cause they agreed it was ugly, but then when my order came it THAT got cracked too and i‚Äôm not gonna lie, those two experiences ruined the song a bit for me.

**Poydoo** (8): Suffocation, no breathing

**slimboyfriend** (8): a generic disco bassline will do wonders for any song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I was also getting kinda Weeknd-fatigued by this point but it‚Äôs still a bop

**bulforster** (7.5): yeah the transitions/intro/interlude/whatever are cool but they are taking time away from a really good song!!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): Ngl sometimes with Abel it gets hazy if he‚Äôs talking about a woman or drugs or both

**apatel27** (6): 8d asmr moaning

**Awkward\_King** (6): song kinda long like i took it already?? what tf you want me to do now??? gotcha nose or some shit get outta here

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6): i really liked this when it was released but it got boring for me pretty quickly which is disappointing bc the production is unreal. the melody and vocals just do nothing for me now

**flava** (4): look the buildup is great, but I‚Äôm always left feeling like the payoff, the climax, the chorus should be bigger and more explosive

**jasannn** (3): i despise this chorus with a passion and i feel like I‚Äôve heard this instrumental done better a million times

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): this will probably be unpopular but this song has 0 sense of structure and it just makes me confused!

**Stryxen** (0): I cannot stand the hook it seriously frustrates me how unfinished it feels.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is nothing like anything he does before, and it‚Äôs such a bop. I would take a full latin house album from this man in an instant. Also shout out to the puerto ricans in the sub!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Did y'all know this is the least streamed on the album on Spotify? Wild considering it not only got a music video but is designed to be the definitive anthem of Puerto Rico. The knocking bass takes center stage in the first half, before the track explodes into a sing-a-long EDM chorus, both of which are excellent environments for Benito. It‚Äôs rare that so many raters randomly decide to convene around one random album track but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs this one!

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): this song fucking bangs and the music video is sending home a message. Total 100% smasha and giving solidarity to my fellow Caribbeans in Puerto Rico

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (11): i Genuinely think this song is Bad Bunny at his best both his most deep and aware lyrics (versus there‚Äôs a lot to say about how he talks about women like he can both make music about how violence against women is wrong and work with him but also doesn‚Äôt credit women always on his songs including his ex who I hope uses her law degree to get her money lmao). But he talks about neocolonialism on the island, the privatization of Puerto Rico electrify grid that‚Äôs unstable and then for the music video passes the mic to a a Puerto Rican Journalist who covers these issues and lives on the island (you guys should get her out!). I genuinely think he is at his best when his music reflect how much he loves Puerto Rico and being Puerto Rican.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): shook me to my core like.... this is such a perfect love letter to Puerto Rico that I have to give the ttack its flower.

**nt96** (11): Proud to be Puerto Rican

**plastichaxan** (11): Choosing to ignore all he‚Äôs said about this song cause it‚Äôs just an anticolonialist banger like you can‚Äôt regret your best song girl

**WaneManToc** (11): bad bunny LOVES puerto rico and believes in 51st statehood. *is informed bad bunny is in fact, more a "the island should dictate its future guy* ohhhhhhhh. *reads stephen immewahr's how to hide an empire and the chapters on how much the USA loves to colonize and terrorize the island* OHHHHHH. *listens to El Apag√≥n*. OOJJJHHJHHHHFHAEIOFHAIWHDFDGAUW LES FUCKEN PARTTEEEEE

**1998tweety** (10): I wasn't really vibing with this at the start but then it gets CUNTIFIED a minute in. ME GUSTA LA CHOCHA DE PUERTO RICO!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): go off bop

**akanewasright** (10): THEE smasha, one of the most insane house inspired cuts I‚Äôve heard in recent memory

**Ambrosia42** (10): a cunty song about Puerto Rico, okayyy

**Awkward\_King** (10): shaking ass in the mental institution rn

**beeozan** (10): I felt my neurons activate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): An undeniable SMASHA!

**bulforster** (10): how this is still the least streamed song on the album is one of the great mysteries of our time

**CrimsonROSET** (10): MAKE SOME NOISE THIS IS THE SMASHA!!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of the gayest songs ever when you think about it

**DirtyRat583** (10): P fuckin' R ayy üó£Ô∏è

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this would go hard at a University party where all the drinks are cheap and everyone‚Äôs there to get laid

**frogaranaman** (10): he really does everything for Puerto Rico, it‚Äôs so admirable

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Bad Bunny for president

**ImADudeDuh** (10): literally when will your fave put a documentary about the displacement of native families in favor of wealthy americans in a music video for a song with the bridge ‚ÄúI love the pussy of Puerto Rico‚Äù (x20)

**moonshxne** (10): finally

**Roxieloxie** (10): I imagine this wins or gets very close to it

**seanderlust** (10): this song makes me want to bounce around in a group of people so fucking bad. benito said open this pit UP!!!!

**Stryxen** (10): I can't actually relate but I can relate to FEELING like a trashy electropussypopper

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): god this is just such a fucking banger

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is the clit, or rather, the pussy of puerto rico the rate

**vayyiqra** (10): Well I'm sold on Puerto Rico being awesome now Mr. Bunny! üèñÔ∏è

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): What's the Spanish term for slut dropping? Bajarse como puta? Whatever it is I'm doing that

**welcome2thejam** (10): Petition to delay the rate a month so the reveal happens the week Bad Bunny is hosting and probably wrestling at a WWE show in Puerto Rico

**celladonn** (9.5): this goes off actually

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): people were slain

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): what a tribute to pr

**shipperondeck** (9.4): SLAYYYYYYYYY

**Frajer** (9): Benito has the energy of those guys who are constantly waving a Puerto Rican flag from their bikes, that edm breakdown owns

**hikk** (9): my inner edmhead is jumping out okaayyyy

**Nagisoid** (9): "Ahora todos quieren ser latinos" GET ROSAL√çA's ASS

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Now THAT‚ÄôS more like it!! A pure club banger!!! The first half I could likely do without, but the rest? You best believe I‚Äôm gonna skank the fuck out to this one!

**slimboyfriend** (9): if someone made a song with the refrain ‚ÄúI like the American pussy‚Äù it would def be bro-country and it would barely bang a hundredth as hard as this

**impla77** (8.5): oh are there a lot of stray cats there :)

**jasannn** (8.5): I was gonna give this a 5 but that key change

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): the beat on the second half of this goes off so hard omg

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): weird, but quite danceable, YASS! until it wasn't.

**bluehxrizon** (8): Alyssa Hunter would eat this up in a lipsync

**oscarbrierley1** (8): the first half is kind of boring, but the dance beat hits. would be an eleven contender if it was just the second half.

**babadork** (6.9): I want to like this more than I actually do. I don‚Äôt know why Gabriela Berlingeri isn‚Äôt credited as a feature. There could be a little less pussy and a few more disses.

**eldritchdeergod** (6.9): the way he says 'P fuckin' R, hey' has me looking like the blushing bug-eyed emoji, also the electronic elements are really fun

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): In almost every other context I would probably give this song with its EDM influences and dirty house beats a decent score. I wish I knew why this didn‚Äôt work with me either.

**dreamingpastel** (5): Not interesting at first, but then the synths happened and made it a little interesting.

**Poydoo** (4): This doesn't feel like a complete song to me. It's missing something for sure

**pig-serpent** (3.5): The first half of this song is easily the 0, but then it gets the 90s rave synths and becomes decently fun, even if it's still way too repetitive to save it all.

**flava** (2.5): it‚Äôs ok but then the beat switch happens and nearly all enjoyment is killed from me, can we stop romanticising electropop when the singer doesn‚Äôt have the charisma and presence to match it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was one of the first songs I heard from the album and wow, this is probably my favorite song I‚Äôve heard from him. It‚Äôs so catchy and I‚Äôm just bopping from beginning to end. Love the little guitars riffs in between and how it switches up tempos between parts. Just a solid bop from beginning to end.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): This became an instant classic reggaeton/latin trap/dembow song on release, and for good reason! First of all, I really have to commend Benito's performance on this song; I've always thought that his vocal performance has lagged behind the strength of his music, but he is fully AMPED here. Second, this is the rare song that plays nonlinearity to its advantage: it's a crazy fun blitz to start off, but when the song kinda just ends after the beat switch/second verse without going back to the hook, it comes off as a "Yeah, I just did that üí™" moment which fits perfectly in such a technically impressive song. I really wish this could‚Äôve pulled off a win but it just never had the chance to gain points on the two songs ahead of it.

---

**Ambrosia42** (11): real ass shaking music, one of the songs of all time perhaps

**CrimsonROSET** (11): I don‚Äôt know what the fuck came into his mind that we needed a sexier updated version of the mambo number 5 about your aunt asking if you have a girlfriend and telling her who the fuck asked but holy shit he was so right

**IIIHenryIII** (11): minus the serial dating, this is the most relatable song ever

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I need this song to fuck me so badly

**jsonphile** (11): absolute banger. If you can‚Äôt get hyped to titi me pregunto-to-to-to-to-to-to-to I don‚Äôt know what to tell you

**seanderlust** (11): HYPE. this absolute banger was one of my favorite songs of last year and was destined to be my 11. the pre-beat switch beat is a banger and the lyrics are douchey but so, so fun

**slimboyfriend** (11): whorish behavior

**AHSWeeknd** (10): producers said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs create a masterpiece‚Äù

**akanewasright** (10): The best fuckboy anthem I‚Äôve heard in years

**Awkward\_King** (10): the fucking beat on this is insane it bangs so hard.. frog you've never been wrong a day in your life

**bulforster** (10): decent fodder for an aroace bad bunny moodboard in these lyrics (@ wane)

**cremeebrulee** (10): girl i wanna 11 this so bad but i have a one-sided soul tie with abel. i hope this wins tho

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): lfg!!!!!!!!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I forgot how happy this so makes me

**DirtyRat583** (10): the first of MANY out of body experiences i will have during this rate

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): what an insane song

**frogaranaman** (10): even white people love this one!

**jay** (10): diga titi me pregunto tan a menudo a lo largo del d√≠a

**plastichaxan** (10): ‚ÄúToday I have one tomorrow another‚Äù well I hope tomorrow comes fast cause this candle Jenner thing is making half of Latin America disappointed in you‚Ä¶

**Stryxen** (10): tit shaker

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD probably top 3 bad bunny songs for me. my other 11 contender

**throwaway-7650** (10): Interlude: Tina Taught Me - Angela Beyinc√©

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Comi√≥ y no dej√≥ migas

**WaneManToc** (10): "¬øDe d√≥nde se reportan? üôÉüëÄ" not me bad bunny. you go to the corner liquor store looking for a 40 like me. you're told "you're gonna have so many girlfriends" but then you get a haircut while a girl is standing there shaking her ass but you don't care. you are a chaste ace punk rocker. you actually don't care about girlfriends for fucking. you just wanna listen to these girls. you are the squidward of reggaeton.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Es el smasha

**xavieryes** (10): is having your aunts asking you about your "girlfriends" the ultimate Latin American experience

**jasannn** (9.5): to my fellow Vietnamese speaking raters, ‚ÄúHam choi‚Äù

**celladonn** (9): banger

**Poydoo** (9): But first, let me take a selfie

**moonshxne** (8.6): Banger! And simultaneously the first song from UVST that made me feel something. Sorry Harry, but this was the song that gave me the resolve to complete this rate after all.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): banger

**impla77** (8.2): Yes auntie, you tell him!!

**Nagisoid** (8): I'm completely in support of Benito's horror synth era with that outro.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): fun energy, like the beat switch.

**shipperondeck** (8): wooo alien sounds

**vayyiqra** (8): So true Mr. Bunny, I think my family also wants me to get married and you know what? That sounds like kind of a vibe. But I don't think I'll meet the right woman while sitting on my computer doing rates sadly. üèñÔ∏è

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): we love a reference to the seminal chainsmokers hit #Selfie

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes boppy

**eldritchdeergod** (6.6): the shift in tone makes me appreciate it a lot more

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): this is okay, but I remembered liking this before, but not now.

**apatel27** (6): The switch up is nice and much needed

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): can somebody mash this up with Firetruck by NCT 127 pls

**bluehxrizon** (5): Idk if this was worth getting sued by his ex GF

**pig-serpent** (5): This take on heavier, distorted and blown out raggeaton? Very good. The execution? The song sounds unfinished, just like 99% of Bad Bunny's music. I love how he switches into a completely different song instead of even attempting to develop the first one he had going on.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): And this is where I got tired of Bad Bunny‚Äôs singing and this is where I KNEW things were going to go to rock bottom for sure LOL (and where I know I‚Äôm going to get the flack of every Bad Bunny stan in popheads rip)

**WaneManToc** (9.896): spanish is such a beautiful language compared to english. when you want to tell someone "i love you", you say "¬°¬°yo quiero comer Bad Bunny!!"

**AHSWeeknd** (9.783): This is legit such a great album. A whole vibe, the production is incredible and works so well with Bad Bunny‚Äôs vocals and lyricism.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.413): This album turned me into a Bad Bunny stan. It‚Äôs full of bangers and doesn‚Äôt make you feel exhausted despite the long tracklist. It‚Äôs hands down the best of the three in the rate, and one of the best of last year. If you didn‚Äôt include it into your year-end Top 10 list, shame on you! I get the Drake comparisons but honestly we should stop them!!!!! He wishes he could make music THIS GREAT!

**frogaranaman** (9.261): yeah I think this album is kinda good

**akanewasright** (8.865): one of my favorites of last year, sooo happy we get to rate it

**nt96** (8.783): now this is an experience, each preceding album felt like a stepping stone to achieving a magnum opus. This album was that victory lap and boy it was! I love the use of multiple Spanish genres to create that united Caribbean sound.

**Ambrosia42** (8.609): yeah this album eats

**vayyiqra** (8.348): Well! Shoutout to Mr. Bunny (my silly little joke name I will call him in this ballot, I do this for all three artists, no reason for it) for making a very long but very good and fun album. I haven't heard it for a year or so because his music is all "summer beach party" vibes, and March-early April in Canada is more of a "wind slush mud" vibe, but thoroughly enjoyed this album and it never got boring despite its large number of songs. Rock on Mr. Bunny. üèñÔ∏è Hope he wins! or Mr. Weeknd would be fine too so either of them can win

**jsonphile** (8.283): a good album, if a bit bloated as the melon says

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.174): This album came out on my birthday as reward from the universe. But also Ngl I am afraid to see how a song entirely not in English and by a Latino rates here compared to two anglophones who‚Äôs lyrics and references make more sense to the average popheads

**DirtyRat583** (8.109): "this album sucks!!!!" it doesnt but its very likely someone thinks this is the case, even today. together we can stop this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.070): My knowledge in Spanish language is abysmal but this sounds pretty good at times, and I didn't expect that I'll give this a better score than HH at all, if I'm being honest, but his voice could sound too weird at times.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.000): he‚Äôs more famous and successful and experimental and boundary pushing and HOT than your fave

**mysario** (7.870): ¬°√Ålbum muy s√≥lido en general! Estoy seguro de que a mi mam√° le encantar√≠a. Simplemente no le digas a mi mam√° que us√© la aplicaci√≥n de traducci√≥n de Bing para enviar esto.

**Frajer** (7.870): taking high school French instead of Spanish hurts me yet again but I can get Benito's appeal

**babadork** (7.822): I‚Äôm glad that I had a reason to give this album a few more listens. I was a little disappointed with it when it first came out. It‚Äôs too long with too much filler for me to listen to it the whole way through like I can do with YHLQMDLG, but I found a few more stand out songs than I had noticed when it first came out.

**welcome2thejam** (7.696): Much like a lot of albums this size, a little bit of trimming could go a long way, but still incredibly solid overall

**cremeebrulee** (7.670): i still prefer yhlqmdlg to this but i won't argue against its success, very well deserved

**Poydoo** (7.522): Just as a disclaimer, I don't speak Spanish at all and I'm too lazy to translate the lyrics, so none of my scores take lyrics into account at all

**bulforster** (7.022): the album that's left when you cut all my sub-8 scores is aoty material and still over 40 minutes long!

=====

TragicKingdom1: **impla77** (6.939): Is this album too long? Yes, but I did have fun with it and enjoy it on the whole.

**dreamingpastel** (6.861): The reason why I procrastinated on finishing my ballot.

**indie\_fan\_** (6.726): ya ha dicho en el pasado que no soy tan grande fan de bad bunny. anque hay algunos canciones en el pasado que si me gustan, la verdad que no puedo tolerar mucho de su musica anterior. Pero si voy a decir que este √°lbum es mejor que YHLQMDLG de rateggaeton. Obviamente el numero uno queja con UVST que es muy largo y tiene mas canciones que necesita. A pesar de eso, todavia difrute escuchando la majoria de este proyecto.

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (6.478): this album does NOT need to be so long. damn the end really drags it down. he could easily cut 6 songs. relistening to it now made me realise why i only listened to it in full like 3 times before this rate.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.435): Yeah this album has done nothing to turn me onto the world of reggaeton. By far my favorites on here are the least traditionally reggaeton ones. At least, I can admit that Bad Bunny is a true artist, he has a vision, and he's very versatile.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.413): Far too long, makes it hard to remember individual songs. trying to not be biased against it because i dont understand the lyrics, but i guess that might work in its favour because i can't mark it down for cringe lyrics.

**eldritchdeergod** (6.117): i listened to this album for the first time for this rate and i glanced over genius's english translations for the lyrics to augment my limited spanish. it goes on a little to long for my tastes but definitely has some standout tracks i'll come back to. i think if i wasn't so focused on concentrating on it for the purposes of the rate i would've zoned out a lot more. the vibes are immaculate though.

**moonshxne** (5.978): thank god for (a portion of) the features because bad bunny is honestly at least as often a charisma vacuum as he is genuinely charismatic. given how looooong and bloated this is, that is a lot of the time

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.978): This album was honestly a struggle to get though. I'm glad there's a few decent tracks in here that I enjoyed (especially El Apagon and Despues De La Playa), but I wish there was a lot more variety.

**Nagisoid** (5.783): Voy a escribir lo que pienso sobre este √°lbum en espa√±ol porque creo que as√≠ me podr√© expresar mejor. Siempre he tenido opiniones divididas sobre Bad Bunny, me gust√≥ su primer √°lbum pero los singles que lo volvieron popular siempre me parecieron mediocres, y esto se hizo m√°s obvio considerando lo imposible que era no escucharlos al menos 1 vez por d√≠a. Ahora, si hablamos de Un Verano sin Ti, obviamente la cantidad de canciones que hay aqu√≠ da√±a mucho su calidad. En s√≠ este proyecto parece m√°s una playlist que otra cosa, las canciones no fluyen una entre otra y varian demasiado en t√©rminos de g√©nero y composici√≥n. La voz de Benito nunca me ha parecido muy notable pero tampoco es molesta la mayor√≠a del tiempo. Los invitados al √°lbum a√±aden y quitan a la experiencia al mismo tiempo; Rauw empeora su canci√≥n notablemente mientras sin Buscabulla, Andrea no servir√≠a como canci√≥n. No creo que este √°lbum merec√≠a ser el m√°s popular de Latinoam√©rica de este a√±o (y tal vez el mundo), creo que salieron mejores proyectos el mismo a√±o de artistas hispanos, pero tampoco es un √°lbum mediocre. Si pones este √°lbum es m√°s probable escuchar contenido de calidad que algo que deja que desear. Es mejor que Harry's House, de seguro, lol.

**apatel27** (5.609): Fuckboy lyrics to the max but it's ok cause popheads doesn't understand them. Plus did this need to be 23 songs long? I get it's for streaming numbers but still...

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.609): look, my issue here is Bad Bunny‚Äôs voice. That vocal filter sounds kinda weird and gives Bad Bunny an uncanny Valley effect, and while it sorta works for other songs, it just really tanks the other. It doesn‚Äôt help that most of these songs aren‚Äôt very engaging to me, I‚Äôve read so much background information trying to appreciate this album but while I can understand that this album means a lot to people‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt get it. I didn‚Äôt find any of these songs fun, even when I‚Äôm excluding the vocal filter Bad Bunny‚Äôs delivery sounds flat, and even reading the translations and poring over them over and over again wasn‚Äôt enough to make this click.

**pig-serpent** (4.826): I am not a fan of Bad Bunny's beat design, and I don't mean in the "hurrdurr reggaeton only has one drum beat" kind of way. I personally think pop music is normally best as a maximalist genre, filling all the space and constantly adding new elements. Almost every Bad Bunny beat is the drumbeat, a fairly normal subbass line, and then one synth line, and then the beat stays the same for three minutes with no growth or development. It's boring and quite frankly, makes all of his songs sound unfinished (even the good ones) and I think it's telling that he would rather switch to a completely different spliced into a single song instead of actually trying to write dynamic or interesting music. With that said, I think the extra bit of reverb on his moodier songs goes a long way and makes some of his slow jams the easy highlights of the album.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.196): I think this record might just be proof that I really don‚Äôt get latin pop or reggaeton at all. I don‚Äôt know. This record is long, yes, but it sounds WAY, WAY longer than it has any right to be, its sound palette rarely changes in any meaningful or significant way, and it‚Äôs just. Not at all pleasant in the slightest. There are some good songs here of course but for the most part the production is too throbbing, the songwriting isn‚Äôt really all that catchy, the percussion is just always that freaking annoying dembow beat, and Bad Bunny‚Äôs vocals range from tolerable to something akin to rubbing my ears on a cheese grater. I have a headache, I really don‚Äôt want to think about this album any more. Sorry.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): another one of the singles from this era, this definitely has all the makings of a hits. Catchy hook, MJ-esque style, and a danceable beat. But it was not, outside my personal chart where it was my most played song of 2022. I think this song is up there with I feel it coming, can‚Äôt feel my face, save your tears (blinding lights is still in its own S+ tier) as top tier pop song.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this was begging for a dua lipa remix but they must have spent the whole budget on like a dozen music videos that nobody watched. sorry for the negativity but i just wish this song was as good as it could've been!!

---

**beeozan** (11): ‚Äúmy oop‚Äù is the best lyric of 2022

**bluehxrizon** (11): people were sacrificed. Max Martin you will ALWAYS be famous

**cremeebrulee** (11): god this is nastiest beat in existence

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Jennifer Check:

**AHSWeeknd** (10): as if one song ago he wasn‚Äôt just living in simp city smh

**akanewasright** (10): if I 11d an abel song‚Ä¶ it would probably be this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it sounds like an outtake from an 80s album by Michael Jackson, but way polished and magnificent.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): His record label should have payola-ed this harder it only needed a little more radio play to smash I swear!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): SUCH a good fucking tune

**DirtyRat583** (10): i put this on a party playlist and was really scared because the rest of the playlist was 90s alt rock and i wasnt sure if they would like it but then it never got played so i worried for nothing üò≠

**dropthehammer11** (10): that guitar lick is just pure money all the weeknd had to do on this was His Thing and of course it was gonna deliver

**flava** (10): absolute mega slay

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): so effortlessly cool

**jay** (10): lemme throw this ass back like shurikens

**Nagisoid** (10): Abel's clearly not willing to sacrifice his life

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This is so funky my GOD!!! I love this one so much. The chorus is amazing.

**Roxieloxie** (10): The moment I heard this song I knew he had a classic on his hands and even if i never came back to this album this one was going on repeat for months, and it did!

**shipperondeck** (10): when this song started for the first time my brain exploded

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): truly a banger, truly deserved more success the chorus is euphoric

**throwaway-7650** (10): slay but the least exciting winner out of this/out of time/<0 imo

**vayyiqra** (10): "The Weeknd was born in Toronto, Canada, a city where winter nights are known to be long and harsh" you're telling me. I suffer greatly mentally every winter! But more from the dark than the cold. It's not -that- cold, it's way colder up north. üìª

**WaneManToc** (10): you wanna know what was smart? putting the transitions as cuts interludes in songs and not sucking. even better, basically plotting yr light show and how live vision with a funked out fucking banger. RIVETING shit.

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): groovy af

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): I wish I could marry that fucking synth line

**jsonphile** (9.5): (youth pastor voice) hey you know who else was big on sacrifice

**seanderlust** (9.3): god why does abel make being an absolute fuckboy sound so NICE

**1998tweety** (9): oh the bop has ARRIVED

**Awkward\_King** (9): banger tbh but was never my standout from the album at all!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): are the first lines a reference to him being Canadian or am I reading to much into the stereotypes about how cold Canada is

**Frajer** (9): talking about Toronto like he's Bane is hilarious

**frogaranaman** (9): they ran with their pussy on this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Banger

**welcome2thejam** (9): Another ridiculously good instrumental that makes me want to drive into the neon unknown

**bulforster** (8.5): feel like this could easily have been another disappointing cut but that guitar is just too good

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): bebe rexha

**impla77** (8): This isn‚Äôt doing much for me, its just fine

**nt96** (8): what popheads will do to Harry to secure a rate win for the other two

**Poydoo** (8): I, too, was born in a city

**pig-serpent** (7): It's good, but I really don't get why this was the biggest song from the album.

**slimboyfriend** (7): he‚Äôs finally entered his fake British accent era

**IIIHenryIII** (6): listening to this does feel like it

**eldritchdeergod** (5.5): this one just doesn't stand out to me at all

**ignitethephoenix** (10): well here it is. The song that never was. The Weeknd knew this should have been a hit as it was one of his closing songs on tour, and he is also definitely aware of what the fans want. This may be his best hook (which is a high bar) and the ascending synths are SO good. However since this era was a flop, he ignored making it a single (outside France for like two seconds?) and never did a video or anything else. Maybe he‚Äôs expecting to to blow up 5 years from now, but for now it will be known as the excellent deep cut that almost closes the album.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): okay hot take but this would NOT have been an easy #1 smash! it's far too similar to Save Your Tears imo. also that's why it's vastly overrated‚Ä¶I mean I get its rate winning story but I just don‚Äôt think the material is quite there. That said, I respect our first album cut rate winner since 2019 by my count!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): king of mathematics

**Awkward\_King** (11): it was so random for me to get hooked onto this song when the albu released at the beginning of 2022. i'd never really clicked with a solo weeknd song before but this was just so gorgeous. this was my song for the soty writeups that i feel like we'll never be seeing sjdjsdj but it is just such a good closing song. it's reflective in such a unique way, looking back on this you hurt and accepting it for what it is and yourself for who you are

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Why was six afraid of seven? Because seven didn‚Äôt make this song a single!

**celladonn** (11): should be called "more than ten"

**flava** (11): It‚Äôs just such a sweet satisfying song and the only song from this album I ever came back to throughout 2022. With its heavenly synth-pop sound and gorgeous melodies, just a beautiful song all around and hopefully winner

**GarciaSynthesizer** (11): - BPD anthem

**indie\_fan\_** (11): what are the odds of this outperforming all his actual singles

**jackisboredtoday** (11): My song of the year last year, just such a perfect hook, classic Weeknd self-loathing, and i LOVE the big final hook dropping out to just the bit of guitar at the very last moment. Cannot believe this wasn‚Äôt a single anywhere but France

**mysario** (11): my headcanon is the dark truth is he's a weenie and that way I can relate

**oscarbrierley1** (11): shouldve been a single, an anthemic banger.

**TiltControls** (11): abel is teaching us about bit overflow where going below the minimum (less than 0) loops back up to the maximum (an 11)

**akanewasright** (10): if you don‚Äôt get this song, you‚Äôve never laid on the floor, heartbroken and in need of one song to play on repeat until you stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): how is this not a single, wtf? this should've been a number one hit!

**bluehxrizon** (10): unfortunately he makes his best music in a state of self-loathing

**bulforster** (10): the snippet from the popheads charts videos of this didn't give me high expectations so I was really confused by all the winning buzz this was getting but after the rest of the album was kind of a letdown this was an incredible note to go out on (especially by comparison)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): FINE it‚Äôs a smasha

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): -hears guitar strumming- finally some good indie music

**emayzee** (10): perfect, euphoric, absolutely everything i can want in a song

**frogaranaman** (10): fine okay yeah you win

**hikk** (10): save your tears if it slayed

**impla77** (10): Kelvin is rolling in his grave

**jasannn** (10): euphoric

**jay** (10): let me maneuver my gluteus maximus in a way that is alluring and appealing to those around me

**moonshxne** (10): "everything is <3"

**Nagisoid** (10): The amounts of songs Harry will have in the top 5:

**plastichaxan** (10): There is a joke to be made here but it‚Äôs a 10 for me so I‚Äôll let someone tasteless make it

**Poydoo** (10): Endlessly bops

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (10): best song on the album. if one song deserved to actually be a hit it was this. everything about this song is good and it was a strong 11 contender.

**throwaway-7650** (10): going to start using <0 instead of <3 and hope it works <0

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): this song just feels kinda epic idk it‚Äôs good

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this is false advertising

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): More like less than‚Ä¶ ten, I guess

**ImADudeDuh** (9): idk some fucking number pun

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Abel Rae Jepsen

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): not my absolute favorite from the album but i support all my less than zerosties

**1998tweety** (8.5): what average y'all would give Harry's album if you could

**shipperondeck** (8.5): :woeperish:

**Stryxen** (8.5): we're mostly back

**DaHumanTorch** (8): studio version is an 8 but live this is a 10 the ENERGYYYYY this was made for a big live show closing number

**vayyiqra** (8): I was told this is The Song Ever on here? Sure, it's good. üìª

**welcome2thejam** (8): From all I've read this is Dawn FM's Cruel Summer situation, and likewise I would still give it just a solid 8

**apatel27** (7.5): It's trying something slightly different

**beeozan** (7.5): someone's gonna give this a 0 and they will appear in the rates negativity section with this song which would be really funny but that someone isnt me

**eldritchdeergod** (7.5): i can see why people want this to blow up later like die for you but i don't really see it happening

**bigbigbee** (7): I honestly think that less than 0 is cooler and more desirable than 0‚Ä¶like when we were in arithmetic class and we learned that there‚Äôs a whole negative dimension on the other side of 0? Our little minds were blown‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**dropthehammer11** (7): like, its definitely good. dont get it twisted. but it never clicked with me as hard as it did for so many people. idk the hook melody just didnt worm into my brain

**WaneManToc** (5.4): oh what the fuck man. im not wearing my pumped up kicks for this shit or doing the flmaing lips yoshimi dance!

**amr** (0): this stole my 0 from late night talking which is enough of an explanation but I will say. I hate this kind of guitar too and was expecting to hear something truly great from all the reception just for it to not even clear decent

**AHSWeeknd** (10.059): deserved a better era but honestly I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt get any overhype the way After Hours did

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9.529): this is easily the best album off this batch, no explanation needed, just listen to it and you'll see why I'll have sex with this record while high on poppers when I'm older.

**WaneManToc** (8.859): on Dawn FM, the weeknd (alongside his new bff mr. opn) fetched the bolt cutters and made an album level experience that as long as you don't bank your whole life on, is pretty good! I'm gonna start by actually handing it to the gang for not fucking up the radio bumps. no one will ever top KLF here, but they tried very very hard and streamlined Magic OPN's way too loud bullshit into something that genuinely worked and was funny and rectified any issues I've had with trying this format in a long long time. as a duo go, OPN and weeknd have become symbiotic and it feels very good to see them meet up and actively bring out what they want in each other for something that works. OPN has lowkey sucked since failing to scale the promise of Garden of Delete where it needed to go & the weeknd has lowkey been just kind of more an overall vibe or concept idea guy that needed to be grounded with someone who had the sounds and understood the past. Dawn FM does get there for both of them and I walked away quite pleased; especially with how well sweedish house mafia and fucking jim carey are! wow! they did it! truly so gutting that Rolling Stone had to inform me that the weeknd "is not a good dude" or some shit. if only he had collab'd with miguel this neva woulda happened!!

**DirtyRat583** (8.453): this is how radio can come back into fashion

**mysario** (8.412): when this era was such a flop, radio had to dust off a song from two albums ago. realistically, the album is a great listen all the way through but it's hard to market albums in today's day and age when everyone is searching for the next TikTok hit or dusting off samples from songs from 20 years ago

**hikk** (8.235): this deserved to be another smash era idgaf, the production goes CRAZYYYYYY i love the flavour of synthpop he went for on a lot of these songs. there's a couple flops and the interludes being here drag it down a little but it should renaissance this rate idc

**nt96** (8.224): Normally I get sick with the 80s synth pop sound because it comes out as mid and relies on the fact that it‚Äôs 80s and supposed to be ‚Äúretro‚Äù or ‚Äúnostalgic‚Äù without realizing that the sounds were good simply cuz they were and they weren‚Äôt trying to emulate anything. I feel this is one of the better cases of not relying on nostalgia and just letting the music speak for itself. A pretty solid album with a very strong vision.

**moonshxne** (8.165): https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNTA2Y2MzZmU1YjEyYmEwNTgwOThiNjVhNTBiOTgxMDc5MjUxOTMwYSZjdD1n/GeimqsH0TLDt4tScGw/giphy.gif

**shipperondeck** (8.094): i listened to this so much in the first quarter of 2022 then boom i forgot about it. but make no mistake! this album is still amazing. and it's less outright toxic than most of his albums whose lyrics sometimes get in the way of my enjoyment of the song (and it is hard to do this). AND in terms of track titles, when people ask about good song titles my mind immediately goes to this album first (how do i make you love me?, every angel is terrifying, i heard you're married, is there someone else?).

**Poydoo** (8.088): The high points on this album are suuuper high, but the low points are honestly pretty embarassing. As an album, I'd give it an 8.5

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.088): Fuuuuck this album is great! Best one out of the bunch!! The synthwavey/80s vibes here are immaculate and I love the storytelling/visuals.

**vayyiqra** (8.059): Good album! I have always felt like a "bad Canadian" or "fake Torontonian" or something for not listening to Mr. Weeknd more, but he does have a lot of songs I like, and this album is good; I just never went back to it. I like the ambition, the concept, the synthwave-ness of it all. Also given I did radio for many years I get a kick out of that too. Rock on Mr. Weeknd (can I call you Abel)? üìª

**akanewasright** (7.912): SUCH a strong album. It has a major stumble or two, but the opening stretch is perfect and ‚ÄúLess Than Zero‚Äù makes my heart feel gooey

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.912): As someone not usually huge on The Weeknd‚Äôs Alternative R&B shtick, this straightforward synthpop collection of bangers is probably my favourite project from him. And it‚Äôs a little bit of a shame that it didn‚Äôt do that well commercially because it should‚Äôve cemented Abel as probably the biggest male popstar on the planet. If there‚Äôs a silver lining it‚Äôs that this album did make quite a few critic year-end lists, and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs certainly worthy a spot‚ÄîAbel‚Äôs songwriting and performances are on-point as always, and the production just suits him way better. It‚Äôs definitely not perfect, no, but this is easily some of The Weeknd‚Äôs best work, and I‚Äôd say I hope he continues on this trend. Though, seeing how people have reacted to this album in comparison to stuff like Die For You, I‚Äôd say probably not? But I‚Äôm definitely glad, after the success of Blinding Lights, that he did give this one a swing‚Äîand minus some consistency issues, what a home run it‚Äôd be.

**Frajer** (7.853): I've never been the biggest Abel stan but this style of music suits him so well

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.765): i hear this album and my brain turns off I just bop and go ‚Äúvibes‚Äù

**jsonphile** (7.706): should‚Äôve been a way bigger success I don‚Äôt know what happened here

**babadork** (7.682): This was the only one of the three albums that I really liked when it first was released. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion, but I think it is5.55his best album.

**welcome2thejam** (7.588): How Do I Make You Love Me -> Out of Time is wall-to-wall home runs, the rest of the album is generally good but that's the killer stretch of this rate

**Ambrosia42** (7.347): a pretty good album, but I liked After Hours way more, so I was slightly disappointed when it came out

**Nagisoid** (7.176): I think I would like this more than After Hours if it weren't for the interludes. We popheads like to complain a lot about the nu-disco/synthpop revival going on in mainstream music right now, but The Weeknd really nails it here. The concept album element is really unique and actually follows it in most of the songs unlike in most pop albums. It flows pretty well and has pretty of highlights, but also a lot of weak points sadly. I do not like most of the interludes and the inclusion of Jim Carrey here was a.... choice to say the least. Still, this was my favorite album in the rate by a lot and I'd say it is the most consistent one. The features and interludes drag it down, which is my biggest critique.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.176): It's a great album with a cool radio concept but he'll never be main pop girl SpongeBob SquarePants with his hit 2006 magnum opus The Best Day Ever

**ImADudeDuh** (7.029): imagine setting up this big era and concept album that's this grandiose and interesting only for you to be too overexposed for people to care and the radio instead decides to latch onto your post malone collab and an album cut from 7 years ago.

TragicKingdom1: **impla77** (6.982): I feel like I like the idea of this purgatory radio station more than the reality.. like it sounds really cool but on the whole it doesn‚Äôt work for me here. Bops galore but not something I‚Äôm dying (lol) to return to.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.559): i like the concept of a radio station album, but in practice it makes some of the songs annoying in playlists because they have a chunk of another song at the end of them. has a handful of great songs, but a few feel kind of like worse versions of songs that he already has. the album art is so ugly.

**pig-serpent** (6.147): I was ready to call this the best Weeknd project when it came out, and now that the dust has settled, I'm not sure. It never bores me as much as his other albums, but it's clear that there's only a few real highlights and none of them have the staying power of Hardest to Love or Party Monster. On top of that I've been complaining about synthwave burnout for a few years and the beats for this album aren't amazing or anything.

**dreamingpastel** (6.118): Unfortunately for The Weeknd, the average would have been higher if the radio show bits showed up less (or just as interludes)

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.118): quite a few of the songs feel too one note, and a few others feel a bit too much like After Hours b-cuts that just weren‚Äôt good enough for that album. Some of these are pretty good, but the album coming right after After Hours with very little sonic evolution probably didn‚Äôt help my own perception of this

**cremeebrulee** (6.106): this album is soooo ciara gif (minus less than zero)

**bulforster** (6.029): I didn't get around to this album until this rate and my main experience with it beforehand was the snippets of each song in the popheads charts videos which sounded really good so I hoped I would be on the positive side of the mixed reception it got. I also had decent expectations as I really liked after hours when it was in the 2020 ult (which I went into with low expectations after I didn't love starboy when it was rated). Unfortunately in the end I fall firmly into the disappointed camp bc most of the songs have good ideas which are then taken to a place I don't really click with. Oh well, hopefully low expectations from this will mean I can be pleasantly surprised by the next album of his I rate.

**eldritchdeergod** (5.565): the weeknd can do what he does extremely well but i really only felt that in a couple of the songs here; the middle felt almost entirely unmemorable to me. the concept had potential but was not utilized effectively or interestingly and jim carrey was not a good choice for the radio host. justice for moth to a flame!

**sweetnsourcesauce11** (5.353): honestly i wasn't surprised this album basically flopped. whilst there are a few fantastic songs, the second half in particular is just boring. there's a real lack of catchy melodies and vocals that has been there in abel's over albums and the interludes..... ugh i don't CARE. the production carries

**apatel27** (5.147): The whole troncore synth vibe is so overdone now

**IIIHenryIII** (4.824): the first track almost convinced me this was going to be a great listening experience, well, the shame is not on me since I lost all high expectations as soon as the second track started. He had a brilliant idea, but it lacked actual good songs to sell it to me.

TiltControls: Great job yetti and TK hosting! And sorry you had to witness the Harry slaughter in real time (unless that was the plan all along)

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congrats to **Less Than Zero** for winning the rate! Less Than Zero becomes the **349th** highest rated song on the sub. 

It ties in score with Rihanna - Umbrella (from BB Songs of the Summer Rate) and Beyonc√© - SUMMER RENAISSANCE. It places lower than Little Mix - Black Magic and just above Backstreet Boys - I Want It That Way and Miley Cyrus - 7 Things (from the Disney Golden Generation Rate)


**Song Stats**

* Boyfriends becomes the 24th lowest rated song on the sub. It scores slightly higher than Train's Drive By (23rd lowest) and lower than Flossie and the Unicorns - Halloween Puppet Show (25th lowest). It bumps Rack City off the lowest leaderboard

## Artists

All three artists have had albums rated before so these are going to be fairly influenced by their last appearances too. Rankings out of 354


* 148th: St. Vincent (7.602)
* **149th: Bad Bunny (7.601) [PREV 106th]**
* 150th: Billie Eilish (7.599)

-

* 154th: Kylie Minogue (7.592)
* **155th: The Weeknd (7.591) [PREV 137th]** / Passion Pit (7.591)
* 157th: Poppy (7.589)

-


* 302nd: Hilary Duff (6.892)
* **303rd: Harry Styles (6.888) [PREV 186th]**
* 304th: Rebecca Black (6.886)

-

Feature changes:

* Tyler, The Creator: 79th -> 85th
* Lil Wayne: 320th -> 320th

**Artist Stats**

* The Weeknd picks up his 5th win today, giving him the 2nd highest win count on the sub
 * His other wins are for Love Me Harder, I Feel It Coming, Blinding Lights and House of Balloons / Glass Table Girls
 * He only trails behind Beyonce, who has 6 wins (Love On Top, Crazy in Love, Partition, Say My Name*, Savage Remix, ALIEN SUPERSTAR)
* He also ties Beyonce and Ariana for most rate appearances at 22 each. Funny enough all 3 already have songs set to appear in Winners 4 (Beyonce and Abel with 2 each actually now)
* With 96 times rating his songs, The Weeknd now is tied for 6th with the most song ratings on the sub
 * He ties Lana Del Rey (also with 96) and sits just below Taylor Swift (166), Beyonce (109), Carly Rae Jepsen (106), Ariana Grande (102), and Lady Gaga (99) 
* Abel picked up just more than 30 11's this rate, but it didn't change his 7th place most 11s placement as Charli XCX (in 6th) previously had a lead of more than 40 over him. However now he is only 5 away from 6th.


## Albums

Well this didn't take long for someone to join Taylor. (Also decided to treat Moth to the Flame as a non-album track, if anyone has any arguments for it let me know)

(Rankings are out of 381)

* 227th: Daft Punk - Random Access Memories (7.437)
* **228th: Bad Bunny - Un Verano Sin Ti (7.430)** / Beyonc√© - 4 (7.430)

* **374th: Harry Styles - Harry's House (6.362)**
* 375th: Taylor Swift - Midnights (6.356)

-

**Album Stats**

* Harry's House becomes the 7th lowest rated album on the sub
 * It joins the top 25 lowest rated albums leaderboard and knocks Halsey's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom off
* Harry's House gets the 'honour' of becoming the 2nd earliest exit in a 3 album rate, only being beaten by [an album that took the top of the list last month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights)
* Harry's House becomes the 8th album to not end up with a single song scoring over 8 average
 * The other albums include The Vamps - Meet the Vamps (highest at 7.538), Selena Gomez - Rare (7.615),  Zara Larsson - Poster Girl (7.739, though extra track All The Time cracked 9 and won), Fall Out Boy - American Beauty/American Psycho (7.759), Christina Aguilera - Bionic (7.852), Selena Gomez (again) - Revival (7.886), and Drake - Views (7.960)
* Harry's House also breaks a record after picking up 39.2% of the available 0's in the rate. This puts him in the 4th for biggest 0 magnet album.
 * The albums above it are Taylor Swift - Midnights (56.9%), Rihanna - Talk That Talk (47.6%), and Katy Perry - Teenage Dream [Original Rate] (44.0%)
 * This knocks FutureSex/LoveSounds off the list
