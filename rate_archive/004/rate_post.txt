[RATE] Nelly Furtado-Loose vs. Shakira-Oral Fixation Vol. 2 vs. Fergie-The Duchess
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/55e3a6/rate_nelly_furtadoloose_vs_shakiraoral_fixation/

Welcome to one of the the two official “/r/popheads Rate Threads” for October!  Like all the others, we all get together and score each of the songs off of each of the albums to see what our favorites are, and see what our not-so-favorites are.  In this thread, we’re gonna be going back in time 10 years to 2006!  That’s right!  Contrary to popular belief, music was still around before Gaga invented it in 2008.

Rules are the same as previous threads:

1. Listen to the songs below. Links provided later.

2. Rate each song from 1 to 10, 1 being awful and 10 being perfect. You can also give ONE eleven and ONE zero, to your favorite and least favorite songs respectively (across your entire scoring, not per album). Please leave comments alongside songs!  It’s a ton of fun when we reveal the ratings and get to hear everyone’s opinions and observations.

3. PM your scores to me, /u/TeamAwesome4 , along with any comments you'd wish to add. You can copy and paste the lists into a Word doc/Notepad/whatever, add your scores, and send them to me. Your scores and comments ARE NOT ANONYMOUS.

4. The scores will be revealed in order from lowest to highest.
5. We all gather to complain about that song that should have been eliminated long ago ago and cry that one artist has 7 songs in the top 10.  It'll be a blast!

The albums we’re looking at this time are:

**Nelly Furtado-Loose**

Vs

**Shakira-Oral Fixation Vol. 2**

Vs

**Fergie-The Dutchess**

No bonus tracks this time around because Shakira only has a bad remix, and Fergie’s bonus tracks could fill another album all on their own.  And now, a quick introduction to each of these artists and albums (as if you didn’t know them already)...

# Nelly Furtado-Loose

Loose was Nelly’s third album, following Whoa, Nelly! and Folklore.  Both of her previous albums were successful, with a number of top 10 hits in the United States, her home of Canada, and worldwide.  However, true pop-stardom would come with Loose.  Working heavily with producer, Timbaland, the album produced multiple #1 hits and was #3 for album sales in 2006, only being beat out by the High School Musical soundtrack and Justin Timberlake’s FutureSex/LoveSounds.  Since the album, Nelly has released two others, one of which is entirely in Spanish, and her sixth album, The Ride, is scheduled to be released in March 2017.

The tracklist is:

Shakira (Full name: Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll) started her musical career in the 1990’s at a very young age.  Through some success in Spanish, she made her first English breakthrough with Laundry Service in 2001.  Her lead single “Whenever, Wherever/Suerte” was a global smash hit, hitting #1 in just about every country except the US, where it peaked at #6.  In 2005, Shakira returned to her Spanish roots with Oral Fixation Vol. 1, and released the English counterpart Oral Fixation Vol. 2 later in the year, and then re-released it in 2006 with the addition of “Hips Don’t Lie”.  Since then she has released 3 more albums, as well as promotional singles for the World Cup and a song on the soundtrack of the Disney film, Zootopia.

# Fergie-The Dutchess

Fergie (Born Stacy Ann Ferguson) started her musical career as part of the girl group, Wild Orchid.  They had some minor success before Fergie left in 2001.  She was then approached by will.i.am to work with The Black Eyed Peas on their album Elephunk, and joined the group permanently shortly afterwards.  Following the success of Elephunk and Monkey Business, Fergie released The Dutchess as a solo album with assistance from will.i.am as a producer.  The album was a major success with three #1 singles and two others inside the top 10. Since then, Fergie released two more albums with The Black Eyed Peas, and has her second solo album, Double Dutchess, coming out sometime in the near future.
