So, this song is fire.  Should have lasted just a bit longer, but top 10, I can’t really complain.  I guess I’m in the minority when I say I didn’t mind the english added to this.


Yatcho, PandoraKris, and letsallpoo all disagree with me, “I ADORE this song, but the English chorus is wildly out of place”, “The Spanish version of this song is I C O N I C.”, and “Could do without the English but it's still a MASTERPIECE”


MrSwearword, busting out the Spanish again, says “Oprima dos a gustar esta cancion mejor.”


Mother_rucker thinks”the music video might be the sexiest thing I've ever seen.”


Therockinrolla on the other hand “only listened to it for the first time for this r8 and i dont get the hype”


Forgetting which came first, the shadiest comment is:

This song is dated as hell.  I’m pretty sure this debuted one day and sounded dated the next.  And I still love it.  Promiscuous might be the better song, but Nelly is the sexiest right here.  Vocals and video included.


PandoraKris: “No one can sing "Ahhhh" better than Nelly herself (in the bridge part).”-Queen of singing Ahhh


Yatcho- “This never blew up in the US so I had never heard it until this rate but honestly it's such a bop too”-Indie Queen of 2006


Therockinrolla: “YESSS MAMA MAKE ME WORK HARD”-Queen of working hard


MrSwearword: “This song ages poorly among other tracks but by its own merit, it bangs hard.”- Queen of… aging poorly I guess?


Omgcow: “I love the drums. This song is so unapologetically sexy and powerful.”You either want to be with me or be me”, I love confident Nelly”-Queen of Confidence (Sorry Demi)


DrWhoWhenHowWhy: “This song took a while to grow on me. This was originally an 8 but now an 9.”-given the context of this song, that might be stockholm syndrome.


Joshually taking things a bit too literally: “Every gay boy's hype song before they have to toss their trick's salad.”


And, as always, calltehshots rambles on for hours about the song, stating: “fun”

I love this song to death.  This is the breakup song that neither Taylor nor Drake could never do because it has maturity.  And it’s coming from Fergie.  Nothing about that makes sense, but it doesn’t need to, it needed to make music, and goddamn, it did.  I’m sad (not surprised) it’s out this early, and it’s at #8!


Most people agreed with me, singing the praises of this, as calltehshots calls it, “emotional bop”


ExtraEater: “damn those opening chords. those head-raising OPENING CHORDS.”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy: “Really loving the "It's not you, it's me" theme of this break-up song. Also one of Fergie's best songs of her career.”


Therockinrolla is a member of the Church of Fergie: “I used to worship this song, its still great. of all the romance songs in this rate, this one actually sounds like it has the most emotion behind it”


PandoraKris had compliments, but also some reservations: “I'm a big fan of Fergie's versatility: in one song she nails her rap game like nobody's business, and she could sing her ass off in others like this one. Sadly, this song still couldn't recovered from overplaying…”


MrSwearword laments the fact he cannot enjoy one of the greatest songs ever written: “No wonder her solo career was reduced to playing jacks and UNO cards. This song royally sucks.”


Awhile2 doesn’t like “the stupid child/blanket line”


Joshually says its “[My theme song for when I was manically dieting to get my six pack and had my very own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfsAi95ghuU](slapchef.)”

Why did this get big?  Was it the bleepy-bloopy beat?  Was it the pathetic excuse for a chorus?  I mean the sample is ok, but that’s the highest praise I can give to this song.  Obviously, I’m alone in this opinion.


Omgcow and MrSwearword, both referred to it as “cute” and mother_rucker goes a bit more in depth: “This song is light and airy. The gold standard of cutesy love songs.”


Therockinrolla adores “that hook!”, and PandoraKris says, “that "girl can't help it" sample is perfectly spot on.”


Calltehshots calls it “a dated bop but a bop”


Spacebabe: “This production is really well done and the slight vocal filter really makes her chops sound even better”


Joshually: “So good that Britney decided to remake it for her latest CD. But seriously, what is up with white pop girls trippin all over themselves for a hot dude?”

This is a crime on the level of Tik Tok placing 6th in Comma’s rate.  More than half the people participating in this rate give it a 10, and it doesn’t make the goddamn top 5.  The most successful song of 2006 worldwide can’t crack top 5.  And it wasn’t particularly close either.  Raw-score-wise, it scored 8.9 above Clumsy and 9.8 behind (censored).


MrSwearword thinks “It’s primo shit, ya heard?”


And letsallpoo disagrees “I always thought this was overrated. A lot of the energy in the first chorus gets immediately lost.”


Mother_rucker, omgcow, PandoraKris all felt like they just had to dance while listening to it


Spacebabe27 and therockinrolla supply us with our first claims of “I C O N I C”

Sorry, MrSwearword, your 11 didn’t come in 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd. This was in first place on October 31st at 6:00 pm.  Song is dope as fuck and everyone knows it.  It’s maybe the best duet in pop music, with a killer beat behind it and is unapologetically flirtatious.


MrSwearword: “One of the best songs ever made.” Sorry, your 11 didn’t even get to top 3.


Spacebabe27 asks, “What even else can I say about this bop that hasn't been said?”


Omgcow goes into a little more detail: “Absolutely ICONIC. I love how sexy and playful it is, the production is amazing. Nelly and Timbaland have such great chemistry here, it feels so fun. Legitimately one of my favorite songs of all time. I want to personally fight anyone who doesn’t give this song AT LEAST a 10”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy agrees: “I mean, what's not there to like about the song? The harmless flirting between Timbaland and Nelly in this song, the amazing production of this song thanks to Timbaland. My god, this song is just a perfect bop.”


Joshually says “My own personal ho anthem.”, so which sjoors replies, “tbh everyone's slutdrop anthem”-You gotta share the sluttiness, sorry.  calltehshots wants in on it, saying, “yes hunnies lets start a grind line in our flare jeans and take some pics 4 myspace!!”


Yatcho: “Iconic duet of the decade tbh. Chainsmokers could never”


Mother_rucker: “Usually I hate back-and-forth, conversational duets because they sound cheesy and dumb. Tbh parts of this song are cheesy, but I get distracted by that Timbaland production.”


Letsallpoo likes it, but doesn’t love it saying “I don't think is Nelly's best song in the rate and I don't really want it to win tbh”-Well, it certainly didn’t.

Well, this landed right about where I expected it to. Overall, this song is just really good.  Not perfect, but really good.  If anyone you know really dislikes this song, tell them to take their broke ass home.


PandoraKris: “Fergie's GOAT. It's also the best song among all the songs in this rate, period.”-Well this is what you get for giving Promiscuous a 0.


Lots of people commented on the one line we all love so much.


Mother_rucker: “"I still go to Taco Bell." Queen of being relatable, despite telling me to take my broke-ass home earlier.”


Or the Pulitzer winning author, calltehshots: “taco bell”

DrWhoWhenHowWhy endorses upwards economic mobility: “I really like the rags to riches feel to this song if you pay attention to the lyrics. While it's one of the most upbeat songs in the album, the lyrics feel very sincere from Fergie for some reason.”


Therockinrolla “I think this is one of the best atmospheres created by a song... just so fluffy and wonderful and high class”


Omgcow: “Best song on the album imo, I especially love the bridge and Ludacris’ verse”

#NEVER MIND. I WAS SHADY HERE.

I'd like to thank my holy sex Jesus, singer/songwriter Steve Grand, whose music is available on iTunes, Spotify, etc. and whose covers of trash pop songs like "PillowTalk" & "Sorry" by Bieber and his near LEGENDARY cover of "All I Want For Christmas Is You" can be purchased on Bandcamp [it's on Spotify too, but whatevs].

OH SHIT!  This song is the hottest and messiest of hot messes.  There are so many problems with this song, but I don’t even care.  The only one that actually bothers me is that it seems to go on for like 30 seconds more than it should.  The Thot anthem that could, when will “Promiscuous”?


Lassidoggy says what nearly everyone thinks about this song: “London Bridge is slutty, sexy, and trash. It's also the best Fergie song ever.”-Nearly every comment was essentially this comment.


Therockinrolla: “this is the best ever and the sirens at the beggining get me PUMPED”


Mother_rucker: “Best intro of any song ever in the existence of time. Also the best "being a ho at the club" song. Also the best "being a ho on a regular basis" song.” @Promiscuous


Yatcho: “People should still be playing this at parties honestly”-If they aren’t, you’re going to the wrong parties.

This song is goood.  That being said, I always thought it had issues.  will.i.am will forever be a problem, as is the low buzzing that seems to go through out the whole track.  That being said, this has such unique lyricism that somehow refuses to wear out, even after 10 whole years.


Half the people who commented: “I C O N I C”


Letsallpoo calls it: “An undeniable classic.”-lowest score is a 7.  Seems like you’re right.


I think calltehshots said it best: “she made a song called fergalicious and it was so good and catchy that no one cared slay me queen”


Mother_rucker: “Insane beats. Self-confidence. Spelling. Misspelling. This song has it all and it is perfect.”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy: “Not only this is a great song on its own, it's an excellent opener to this interesting, catchy album from Fergie.”


Omgcow: “An eternal bop. I play it every time I’m up in the gym just workin on my fitness”


Therockinrolla: “MAKE ME SO LOCO GIRL”


MrSwearword: “Misspelling tasty is forever a sin, but this song is finely crafted.”
 
PandoraKris: "To the P, to the E, to the R F E C T I O N. And Fergie SLAAAAAAYED in her "but I ain't Promiscuous" line."


I’m gonna be level with you, I don’t know if this is actually shade, but it feels like it.

This song is perfect. This is one of the songs that we need to attach to spaceships and send to outer space when we scout for alien life.  This is one of the songs that needs to be preserved for eternity, opened up in the year 8419 after World War 27 to give the people of the world hope in rebuilding a new civilization.  This song could stop hunger and cure cancer.  People LOVED this song.  


Joshually is the most correct person: “Literally the definition of what it means to be a low key hit. A slinky groove, a sparse instrumental, a subtle build up, soothing echoes, and the lushest background vocals ever produced this side of Rhythm Nation.”


Yatcho: “Revisiting this song so many years after it blew up really makes me appreciate Timbaland at his peak. This song just sounds so cool and fresh, and even though the lyrics kind of make no sense I don't really care because it sounds so good with the music.”


Calltehshots calls it, “a masterpiece” and letsallpoo says “It's too perfect.”


Omgcow: “I wish I had another 11 to give because this song is just so beautiful”


MrSwearword: “Even with Nelly’s muddled speech, this track goes in and I approve.”


Therockinrolla: “Its good but there are so many better songs on this album ALSO THE BEGINNING OF IT SOUNdS LIKE A CARLY RAE SONG SOMEHOW”-It’s because of Canada.  We must selectively breed the Canadians to create the perfect popstar.


Bluehxrizon: “such a memorable song. i love this”

PandoraKris: "Production is a 11/10, and it fits Nelly's vocal very very well. The best song in the album."


Spacebabe:  “Invented the concept of a bop.”-Invented a bop before Gaga invents music, what talent.

3rdattemptusername: Nelly got first and last, but at the same time I feel hers was the most consistent?
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tsfok/]

=====

PandoraKris: I think Fergie's more consistent? Nelly is very much skewed towards the top end
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tsmmx/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: Standard deviation of numerical scores puts Nelly at 1.055, Shakira at .948, and Fergie at 1.351

gannade: Shakira consistently on the bottom

=====

TeamAwesome4: Begrudgingly, I admit that you are right.

=====

TeamAwesome4: Album Stats:

Loose Average: 7.427 (Higher than "The Fame Monster")

The Dutchess Average: 7.280 (ALSO higher than "The Fame Monster")

Oral Fixation Vol. 2: 6.450 (Higher than "Teenage Dream", but that album sux so...)

#OTHER STUFF:

At one point, Promiscuous, Say It Right, and Fergalicious were all rated higher than 9.5.

The bottom 4 songs didn't change at all until 5 days before the end of the rate, they were "Finally", "Mary Jane Shoes", "In God's Hands", and "Something".

That's all I've got friends, hope you had a good time in this rate!

ExtraEater: > Oral Fixation Vol. 2: 6.450 (Higher than "Teenage Dream", but that album sux so...)

this is why ke$ha underperformed in the rate

MrSwearword: Thank you for all the delicious blood and salt. <3

PandoraKris: Yours too. Damn delish
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tsoqa/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: In hindsight, Shakira inclusion was a bit off.  A couple albums that I now think would have been better off against would be Gwen Stefani's "LAMB" and Pussycat Dolls' "PCD", at least at the higher end of the songs.  Oh well.  Thanks for being around everyone, this was so much fun to do!
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tssmo/]

=====

yatcho: Or "Sweet Escape" to keep it in 2006. Gwen would have definitely been competitive in this rate
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tt3fo/]

=====

letsallpoo: that would have been fun, but are there any PCD songs worth listening to besides the singles?
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tuoj4/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: I think so, but I'm likely in the minority.  Probably about on par with Fergie's non-singles.  Also...

>at least at the higher end of the songs.

letsallpoo: true. buttons is a bop!

i hope in the future we have more rates that have more than 3 albums

TeamAwesome4: "Off The Wall-Thriller-Bad-Dangerous" R8 when?
[/r/popheads/comments/5c4seu/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/d9tv1i5/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: Also, I'd have loved to see how "Buttons" lined up with the other THOT anthems, "Promiscuous" and "London Bridge"
