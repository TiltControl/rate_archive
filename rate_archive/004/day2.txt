[RATE RESULTS] Loose vs Oral Fixation Vol. 2 vs The Dutchess: Day 2
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5bpyst/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/

Alright, so day 1 was pretty harsh for all the Shakira fans in the room.  Lets see what day 2 has in store for us, shall we? Today we're gonna be eliminating 14 more songs, leaving us with our top 10!  Our first song of the day will be revealed at 7:00 central time, so a little bit over 30 minutes from now.

Controversy scores are standard deviation, or how much we disagreed on a score.  The average for this rate was **2.021**


I pre-typed a lot of stuff, so if something is formatted a bit weird, please forgive me, I'll try to straighten it out.

MrSwearword: #YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS, PENDING BLOODSHED

In prep for the oncoming Nelly Massacre, let us remember the Shakira songs that got chopped like ingredients on the Food Network show of the same name. That aside, if Nelly songs must die today, "Afraid", "Maneater", "Glow", "Te Busque" (both versions), "Showtime" and "Wait For You" can go ahead and DIAF.

If for some reason more Shakira songs die today, "Animal City" and "Timor" can DIAF. If Fergie songs must die today, "Pedestal", "All That I Got (The Make-Up Song)" and "Big Girls Don't Cry" can fuck off into the sea, thnx.

I swear, the massacre is coming.  Trust me, **it's coming**.

So I’m a bit sad to see this one go, but not really surprised.  Shakira’s pop-rock is better than most others, and she experiments with howls before “She Wolf”, what more could you want?  Comments range from praise to GODDAMN IT, letsallpoo SPOILED MY OBVIOUS LINK I HAD PICKED SINCE DAY 1!


Letsallpoo: “This reminds me of this one user on ATRL who would refer to Zootopia as "Shakira's Zootopia" and result in titles like "Shakira's Zootopia grosses 1bil worldwide". I thought it was hilarious tbh”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy: “It was really weird to hear Shakira swear in this song. Whatever, it's still a bop.”


Spacebabe27: “Yas bitch werk”


therockinrolla: “Listen all you hoes are sleeping on this artful, hookful, epico track”


PandoraKris: “Probably only Shakira can make a western-inspired song interesting.”


Yatcho: “Cheesy awkward lyrics are gonna a recurring theme aren't they?”  Well, it is Shakira, isn’t it?


MrSwearword: “The recycled “Lelololehlolehh” from “Whenever, Wherever” offended me.”


Omgcow: “I like the verses, but the chorus doesn’t do anything for me”

Well, took it long enough.  This song isn’t emotional enough to warrant being this mellow.  It should have died back where “Dreams for Plans” is (RIP).


Keeping it short and sweet, therockinrolla says “weak, next”, and calltehshots says it’s “pretty but forgettable”


Most others seemed to like it, like PandoraKris who “I love that “I Like a Bird” vibe! “I Like a Bird” is still her GOAT, but this one fares well too.”


MrSwearword: “Above average even if the production gives Back to Basics meets ALIENS teas.”


Omgcow: “I love this. Great R&B type slow jam.”


Spacebabe27: “The vocal layering in this song is so well done. Also there is one specific synth that just sounds so unlike a song from 2006 it's crazy”

I really didn’t like this one much.  “Haters” songs in general are pretty poor, but adding in “Tell me who you are and what your background is” just establishes stupid pedigree shit.  Not sad to see this one go this late into the game.
 
PandoraKris is absolutely right, stating: “Haters gonna hate! Fergie has made it clear that she doesn't care how bad you rated her songs yo.”  Nope, she doesn’t, we’re a handful of internet nobody’s :’(


Calltehshots says: “i guess i needed to rest after london bridge”  I didn’t want a break like this one, though.


therockinrolla digs it, saying “I really love the super egotistical and narcissistic character of the Dutchess slayin an ugly bitch”


And joshually, always bringing shade on an otherwise sunny day, says it’s “Generic”.

Just like a movieeeeeee… This song is pretty damn good in my opinion, but I didn’t expect it to make it this far.  I always thought it was a bit of a hot mess, and it looks like that’s a common theme.  Nobody even had anything terribly bad to say about it, so the shady comment goes to nobody.


Yatcho: [Link](http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/timbo-rnb.jpg]“Reminds me a lot of what Justin Timberlake was doing at the time, which is high praise”)


PandoraKris: “Interesting song with influences from Middle Eastern music, but it's unnecessarily long and getting more annoying.”


Spacebabe27: “This is all over the place, but some of them are worth visiting.”


MrSwearword: “It’s cute, but not anything beyond a song lucky enough to end up on Loose.”


Omgcow: “I’ve always felt like the mixing is weird on this song, the instruments in the background overwhelm the vocals, still love it tho”


Joshually steps out of the shade for the first time, “Wait for you is aiiiight.”


Calltehshots, ever the wordsmith, says: “its nice lol”


And Joebiekong’s only comment of the whole rate: “I prefer “Waitin For You” by Demi… (the last verse saved it from a 1.5)”

OUT TOO EARLY.  Shakira kicks some ass on a very political song, which I normally hate, but if anyone has the global reach to be taken seriously, it would be Shakira.  Like Timor itself, this song was controversial, 3rd after “Finally” and “Something”.


MrSwearword and therockinrolla both didn’t like the children, and MrSwearword adds “It doesn’t totally suck, but it’s fucking weird”


Yatcho thinks this: “funky beat kind of comes out of nowhere but I appreciate the change up”


Calltehshots can’t handle the truth, saying “I’m scared”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy and sjoors love the political stating “SHAKIRA GOING WOKE IN THIS SONG LIKE YASSSSS.” and “wow Shakira shading the whole western civilization with 1 song”


Omgcow ain’t woke though: “I didn’t know what Timor was until I listened to this and I’m still not really sure what it is”


And either joshually or I have no idea what the cranberries sound like in the shadiest comment:


>It's like she wanted to cover a song by The Cranberries but got confused before she even started.

Shadiest comment:


>Patrick Bateman: “Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.”

It’s fine, but again, surprised it got this far.  You guys like Nelly too much.  Or just too consistently.  Regardless, it’s gone now.  I love that pause in the first verse.  As does…


PandoraKris, who asks, “Can I request her to mute the whole song after that "but I'd rather be your baby" line? lol jk”


As well as catching yatcho off guard, “slight awkward pause in the first verse made me think I stopped the song, woops”


Bluehxrizon, omgcow, and therockinrolla all sing it’s praises, stating, “this song is such a bop”, “Amazing”, and “I don't like the beginning bit but the rest slays me”


Spacebabe27 and joshually were less impressed: “Not bad but didn't go anywhere for me”, and “Skip.”


MrSwearword and Awhile2 both comment on Timbaland saying “The infamous synth Timbaland invented fucks with the song’s swagger”, and “The production on this song is like the essence of Timbaland and I love it.”

It wasn’t Taco Bell.  It was will.i.am, whose verse is garbage.  And another song where I’m the only 10.  This song is just the sexiest fucking thing.  I don’t need the sexy lyrics of London Bridge, Promiscuous or Hips Don’t Lie, give me a stable loving relationship.


I’m so lonely.


ANYWAYS, letsallpoo, PandoraKris, DrWhoWhenHowWhy and omgcow all agree with me with some variation of “This is good, but GET RID OF will.i.am, PLEASE.”


Yatcho says that “That early 00s R&B feels kind of out of place I'm the middle of these songs”


And mother_rucker strictly disagrees: “Yes girl hit me with that late 90s R&B/mid-2000s pop combo”


MrSwearword and therockinrolla aren’t as impressed, stating “The remix/theme song for the Tyra Banks show is far better.” and “no, cya later”


Calltehshots feels like “I’m in an episode of sex and the city”

A really nice song, and I’m happy that it made it this far.  Everyone who mentioned him seemed to adore Juanes on this track, myself included.  It’s just all around some solid latin pop.


Yatcho is angry that Nelly did “a song with my husband Juanes without telling me.”


Dr.WhoWhenHowWhy loves it, claiming “This is one of my top-tier favorites from this album (and this rate in general).”


MrSwearword has other opinions: “The award for the most boring song goes to…”


Spacebabe27 says it sounds “so dated but I love it.”, and therockinrolla follows suite saying “Not incredible, but I still love it”


Joshually “loves the mix of English and español”


Omgcow: ““My heart’s so frigid, I keep it in the fridge” is such an awful line it makes me cringe every time, which is unfortunate because the rest of the song is beautiful”, and letsallpoo agrees on the bridge, asking “Nelly, what is this messy spoken word bridge? Take notes from Halsey!”


And our local poet, calltehshots, says “its okay lol”

I rated this lower than the English on, not because it’s a worse version, just because of worse placement.  “All Good Things” deserves the closing spot.  Of all the people who commented, only one liked the english version more:


Therockinrolla: “.1 off bc of no ingles”


Calltehshots liked it the same, because “nothing changed same vibe”


And everyone else liked Spanish slightly more.


DrWhoWhenHowWhy said that he “really wishes the bridge could have been in Spanish though.  It's really weird to hear the song almost sang in Spanish and this English bridge comes up.”


Joshually says it’s, “Probably the fiercest song on the album TBH”

And ANOTHER SONG WHERE I’M THE ONLY 10.  This is the more realistic “Irreplacable” cuz lets be honest, nobody will have “Another you in a minute”, so sometimes you gotta just crush the guy’s car.  Choose any line from this song.  It’s either kinda weird or kinda fantastic, and I’m down for either of them.  The chorus is fantastic, and the bridge is the best in the whole rate, enough so to forgive the missteps in the verses.
 
Spacebabe27 is a bit shook, asking ”Where is this Shakira omg”


Therockinrolla: “if u rate this song badly dont bother coming back 2 this sub”


PandoraKris: “She sounds like a femme fatale in this song: honest, sexy and seductive, and she's coming atcha!”


Yatcho: “I really wish this wasn't outshines by Hips as a single off this album, this is an extremely successful throwback to more classic Shakira”


Both omgcow and MrSwearword didn’t like the lyrics, but were still ok with the song as a whole: “In typical Shakira fashion the lyrics are best ignored, but otherwise it’s good.” and “Some of the lyrics really suck, but her rocker side is out and that’s not a bad tradeoff.”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy and joshually were a bit less impressed: “So apparently, this song was choosen as a lead single for Shakira's album. I don't see how this is lead single material.” and “Much like this song is about struggling to fit in to heteronormative socio-cultural standards, shakira is also struggling... to hit those low notes. Don't bother, gurl.”


And although it likely wasn’t meant this way, the shadiest comment goes to:

Well, there goes the last non-single.  It’s weird that Nelly decided to pseudo-rap over a knockoff Bond theme, but it works.  I don’t like the guest verse too much.


Yatcho agrees with my thinking that it’s like Bond, saying “chorus really shines, Timberland production gives it this really futuristic, mysterious yet sultry, almost Bond-esque feel”


MrSwearword, Awhile2, spacebabe27, and mother_rucker all comment on the production: “Better production work, but the singing is half-assed.”, “Distorted guitar in pop music is my kink”, “The relatively simplistic production and that looming guitar sound really put this song a bit ahead of its time imo”, and “These lyrics are so inspirational but this beat makes me want to get nasty.”


Bluehxrizon and therockinrolla are loving it, stating “already shook”, and “Open up the dictionary... page 538: "Hook - That which has been invented my Nelly Furtado in Afraid" LOVE THIS SO MUCH A GREAT OPENER”


But DrWhoWhenHowWhy and joshually are less impressed, “I can see how this is an opener for the album but I don't like this song.” and “This song isn't awful, but it also isn't great. I'm afraid it only gets a 5.”
 
And once again, our modern day Shakespeare doth pen us a timeless masterpiece:

Beat’s pretty fire.  I don’t really like the chorus of it too much, but the verses are pretty solid.  Also, “WHAT IT IS?”


Most of the commenters loved it, and EVERYONE LOVES THE SPANISH.


DrWhoWhenHowWhy: “I CAN'T BELIEVE NELLY FURTADO INVENTED SPANISH!” AND SHE’S CANADIAN!


Lassidoggy: “Nelly singing in Spanish makes this song 1000x better.”


Yatcho says “She's gonna out do Shakira in her own Spanish bop game”, and therockinrolla agrees “Yes this is better than any other Spanish song ever (Talkin to you La Tortura)”.  Except she didn’t, “La Tortua” is still in it!


MrSwearword is one of the few not commenting on the spanish and says “The beat by itself makes it amazing.”

Yatcho, spacebabe27 and omgcow are all loving the retro feel to it, “it's not as effortlessly cool as most of the album, but I'm here for this cheesy 80s synth fantasy”, “This is amazing, very 80s Madonna-esque” and “I love the retro feel of this”


Mr Swearword thinks it’s “A really fun track that makes me think of the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown.”

Sad to see this one go, and right before the top 10 also.  It tried so hard and got so far.  It’s the perfect closer, and Nelly pulls the little pause off again, and I always love that.  So, you all know how joshually has been shady this whole time?  Well now he stops being just shady and starts being SUPER gay. This continues through the top 10.


Joshually: “The beginning of this song always throws me off. It starts out of nowhere. Love this song. So poignant and riveting. Like a ribbed dildo.”


PandoraKris has forgotten about “Finally”: “Even though this is the longest song among the others in this rate, it managed to not making it sound like a super lengthy filler track.”


BearlyEvenAPun, referencing the outro: “Who knew you could make a song with suicidal canines so comforting”  omgcow likes the suicidal dogs, saying, “The last minute or so is amazing. It’s an absolute crime that this flopped in the US.”


Yatcho calls it a “very pleasant piece of music. Throws back to her more folksy days” and MrSwearword calls it “Her prescient swan song.”
