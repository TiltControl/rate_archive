[RATE RESULTS] Loose vs Oral Fixation Vol. 2 vs The Dutchess: Day 1
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5biwvv/rate_results_loose_vs_oral_fixation_vol_2_vs_the/

Holy shit, this rate is ridiculously hype and I cannot WAIT to get this started!  You guys are gonna freak over this.  I’d tell you how, but no spoilers.  Today we're gonna be eliminating 15 songs!  Our first song will be revealed at 7:00 central time, so a little bit over an hour from now.

Controversy scores are standard deviation, or how much we disagreed on a score.  The average for this rate was **2.021**


I pre-typed a lot of stuff, so if something is formatted a bit weird, please forgive me, I''ll try to straighten it out.

Well, who predicted that Nelly would have the first song out?  It didn’t seem like people really hated this song, but  Regardless, this song is a fine first elimination.  Nelly seems to have no idea where their love is going.  Most commenters seemed bored by it more than disliking it.


Mother_rucker: “A basic ballad in a sea of top-notch bangers.”, and yatcho agrees, saying “its just kind of plain and really outshined by the company it has.”


Therockinrolla: “The only song on this album I actually dislike”


ExtraEater: “What people hate about Wide Awake I hate about this song”


Joshually defends it: “This would've gotten a perfect 10 except I don't do jesus songs.”

This song pushes a lot of my buttons in the wrong ways.  This song is half reggae with some punk/ska/I don’t even know and a weird outro.  No thanks.  It’s just really awkward all over.


Joshually: “Reggae & ska... not my steelo.”


Both Therockinrolla and PandoraKris like the shift near the end: “tropical vibes b4 it was cool, also THAT LEGENDARY PACE CHANGE IS LEGENDARY” and “A better reggae song than Voodoo Doll with THAT PLOT TWIST.”


BearlyEvenAPun: “What were they even trying to do here”


Yatcho: “Where were you when Fergie invented reggae?”

“Something” is on the low end of Shakira songs for me.  No idea why she decided to put French in this song, but she for sure had the most languages on her album, so that’s cool.
 
The comments seemed to have one thing in common.


ExtraEater, lassidoggy, joshually, MrSwearword, all mention how boring it is, and PandoraKris is “pretty sure that I had already heard the same song from the album for like, third or fourth time already”

This song makes me want a punk album from Shakira.  No doubt, this is not pop-y, but this song is some decent shit, but you guys seem to hate clowns.  Even when the song isn’t really about clowns.  Go figure.


Omgcow says “I hate clowns” and sjoors thinks “Clowns are creepy af no matter the costume”.


Joshually simply says “skip”, while calltehshots asks “omg shakira what is going on!?!?!?!”


PandoraKris: “It has the t.A.T.u. vibe in the beginning. I would dig it more if the rest of the song also sounds consistently dark.”


Yatcho: “At least the "humble breasts" line made a comeback”


Therockinrolla sees value in the lyricism: “‘And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream’ goat lyrics”

Yep, we’re working our way through all the slow songs so our top 10 can be all bops.  I thought this song was decent enough but apparently you guys disagreed with me.  Not a work of art or anything, but middle of the road for Shakira’s slower songs.


Funny enough, the opening, “Tell me what’s the use of the 24-inch waist if you don’t touch me.”, had two VERY different reactions.  MrSwearword claims: “WOW Shakira, fat people like me want to know why a man isn’t touching me either.”, and mother_rucker says “yass girl work that humblebrag, love yourself”


Omgcow: Her goat vocals in the chorus kinda ruin it for me


therockinrolla: this is really bad just sayin


Calltehshots: omg what is shakira's deal this is cheesy telenovela music


PandoraKris: Another same-y Shakira's album track, but this one has lowkey Disney sound in it.


Spacebabe27 still loves it: Very beautiful and poignant.

I kinda liked this one, but it’s not worth fighting over.  Few people seemed to have strong opinions about this one, and I wasn’t one of them.  It’s nice and mellow, but it seems that most people agree with my assessment of this: Album Filler


MrSwearword says it’s “Just above fluff, but I approve this anyway.”  PandoraKris and therockinrolla have similar opinions saying “A little boring, but not a bad song.”, and “it isnt great or even interesting but its okey”


Lassidoggy calls it “Basic”, and omgcow says it’s “Just boring”

I’m gonna go cry now.  You all suck and have no taste in music.  I love the feeling of this song, and the chorus lyricism is fantastic as well.  I didn’t expect it to get top 10 or anything, but this is not ok.  This is the best melancholy song in the whole rate.


Here’s some of your dumb opinions


PandoraKris: “For some reason, this song has the 80's-90's pop ballad feel to me. Still boring, but it has the weird nostalgic feel in it.”


Therockinrolla: “its kinda meh”


Joshually: “Another boring song.  Made me fall asleep wherein I "dream to plan" to skip this song.”


And lassidoggy with a condescending, “Girl.”


MrSwearword, being the only commenter with taste, says “Emotional connection alone makes it score high for me.”

I’d say I don’t like this song, but I’d need to remember it first.  And I’ve listened to it plenty.  This is the first song with truly mixed reviews in the comments.


Joshually says it “Inspired Rihanna to be who she is today.”, and calltehshots says that “rihanna is not shook”


And the mixed reviews...


MrSwearword: “‘I don’t have arms.’ Well, this song doesn’t have legs. At least the horns kick ass but they feel so wasted on a poor track.”


PandoraKris: “Not a big fan of this song, but I'm impressed on Fergie's singing here, especially the second verse.”


Therockinrolla sings its praises stating: “body is a fukin temple u right this songs chorus intrumentals are really good”

Well, can’t really be too mad about this one.  Yeah, I liked it a bit, but I always knew it was a bit weird.  Also, I’m not as alone in how much I like it.  Nah, it’s not perfect, but it’s fun.


PandoraKris probably says it best: “A surprise track that Shakira offered. Seems like Shakira have fun playing along with the song production. Very cheeky it is.”


Or a bit more blunt, calltehshots says: “wtf is happening with this album”


MrSwearword is also a bit confused: “I can’t tell if Shakira was making fun of Back to Basics era Christina or not…”


Spacebabe27 gets it, but doesn’t like it: “The production really tried to make this song fit a specific sound, but it just didn't work out”


Omgcow: “The horns remind me of “Pink Elephants on Parade” from Dumbo. Too sing-songy for my liking”


Therockinrolla simply says: “HEEEYYY YOOUUUUUUUUUUU”


Mother_rucker loves it, stating: “Old-timey jazz + Shakira's vocals = perfection”

This song was ok enough I think, but it’s just surrounded by high quality stuff in this rate.  A lot of comments thought this was either perfection or just a little bit off.


One observation from spacebabe27: “Sounds very late 90s”


The positive…


Awhile2: “This song is sooooo smoooth”


Omgcow: “This song feels so cozy.”


Calltehshots: “this is so beautiful wtf”


And the negative…


PandoraKris: “Fergie sounded like she's trying too hard to be sexy here, instead it's more awkward and uncomfortable than it intended.”


Joshually: “Supposed to be a baby makin jam but tbh her voice is NOT sexy sorry bout it.”


MrSwearword: “When Fergie sounds bored against an above average production.”


But the best comment, that completely changed my view on the song, Fergie, music, and life itself, as well as making me laugh for a few minutes earns the “Shadiest Comment” for this song:

I liked this one, especially that acoustic guitar.  You guys couldn’t seem to agree on this one though, with a rather high controversy, and the comments mirror that exactly.


Yatcho says “Couldve been the next single if they really wanted to”, and omgcow would likely agree, saying “Okay this slayed me. How have I never heard this before?”


In a similar line of thinking, therockinrolla says “this song sounds like the 2000s and its spectacular”


However, others disagree.  Joshually simply states: “Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.”, and MrSwearword cites her future albums, saying “She predicted her solo career after this album. P R E S C I E N T.”

PandoraKris calls it “[Simple and clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxk4Um2AcEE) production, yet effective and emotionally rich.”


Yatcho says: “The lyrics here are extremely corny...”


And everyone else just kinda tolerates it.


Therockinrolla: “the last line of the chorus is dumb and this song is barely decent. Holds my attention for a femtosecond”


Joshually: “The verses are too long to justify the pretty but not super spectacular chorus. Also, hola Carlos ¿Que tál?”


Omgcow: “Carlos Santana’s guitar makes up for the rest of the song being dull”

Any of you remember when I said there was a song currently rated lower than “Bad Blood” a while back?  This was it.  It climbed quite a bit, didn’t it?  Well, I don’t like it.  It was super interesting that Fergie tried to make a song 8 minutes, and that’s about it.  These are the comments where everyone agrees AND everyone disagrees, and I don’t even know how that’s possible.


First up are the fans


PandoraKris lectures: “Boys and girls, this should be a #1 Hot 100 song, not a #1 Bubbling Under Hot 100 song. #JusticeForFinally” and joshually is a fine student, repeating “JUSTICEFORFINALLY.”


DrWhoWhenHowWhy says it’s “A perfect closer to this album. I am loving the Broadway vibes of this song too!”, and mother_rucker agrees saying “She has the range.”


Three different people said it sounded like a Disney Princess song: yatcho, calltehshots, and therockinrolla


“Was this meant to be on a Disney song and they cut her off at the last minute or something”


“what kind of disney princess song”


“sound like it’s from a Disney movie and that's enough for me”


Letsallpoo, MrSwearword, and spacebabe27 all win “Shadiest Comment” this time thinking it’s too long saying


“I did not just waste 8 minutes of my life listening to this”


“My ASS “Finally” at OVER 8 MINUTES.”


And “It's boring, repetitive, and way too long”


But the BEST part of these comments are how absolutely opposed these two are.


BearlyEvenAPun: “A sweet song to end on. Could have cut the last section though”


Awhile2: “Dont really care for the first half of this song but the latter half is so goood and reminds me of early Bjork.”

Obvious sample is obvious.  This song has a great sample.  I kind of like the sample?  I honestly have nothing more to say about it than sample stuff.  Comments for this one are all over the place.


Calltehshots has the best comment: “tupac died so fergie could live”


And MrSwearword says things I don’t understand: “This probably predicted Meghan Trainor when she’s off…”


Therockinrolla: ‘literally the seductive "get ready, cause here I come" adds at least 2 points to this song. HAUTE”

I don’t like the opening of this track, but this song is really good otherwise.  The chorus is pretty awesome, but the chants at the beginning kind of kill it for me.  Still pretty decent as far as religious criticism tracks go.  This is another track where all the comments disagree, for example, myself and…


Therockinrolla: “Sounds like a Miley Cyrus song but its great and the intro slays me evrytiem?????” who disagrees with omgcow who thinks it sounds like “like an Avril Lavigne song”.


DrWhoWhenHowWhy “CAN’T BELIEVE SHAKIRA INVENTED RELIGION!” and calltehshots says “lmao i feel like I'm joining a cult”
 
Spacebabe27 likes this change, stating “I like this sound for Shakira, it was also extremely unexpected for me”, and letsallpoo agrees “This track alone shows how Shakira is on ANOTHER LEVEL”


PandoraKris doesn’t like that other level: “While there's a few asterisks behind this statement, this is probably the worst album opening I've ever heard so far.”
