@straights, you may not understand the title. It isn't meant for you. 

/s 

Welcome to day 2 of the messy, record breaking, Katy slaying 2017 Ultimate Album Rate!

We will be starting at

##2 pm EST!!

Oh, there'll be poorly-coordinated shitposts in the plug.dj too! [Here's a link to the plug](https://plug.dj/popheads/) I'd love it if you could stop around, there aren't any fancy homemade shit posts (elite has one made for today!), simply because I'm not talented enough for that shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

--- 

Today /u/elitefourbrad is hosting the reveal in the plug while I post the write-ups here as he reveals!  

Today you will be seeing the writing expertise of myself for the first 10 write-ups, and /u/elitefourbrad for the last 5, so please direct any complaints to us! 

**NOW**

Here are some fun facts:

-	/u/infernalsolstice has taken the crown for the most participated in rate, with a staggering **154** participants. 
-	The average score is **7.1231**
-	The average controversy score is **2.2056**. This means that anything above this score is considered 'controversial'
-       We will be revealing numbers **30-16** today, with the next two bonus rate songs going out as well!

Here is a recap of what songs went out yesterday!

* King of My Heart (#32.), Hymn (#33.), So It Goes... (#35.), Tsunami (#38.), and Look What You Made Me Do (#44.) all did much better in their rate than ours.

---

**Wailordfan** (6): This is sexy, but not like *good* sexy... Whatever D Taylor is/was getting is legendary. 

**Taylor Scalped Me and My Dress**
--- 

**fifthchevron** (11): This song took a minute to get used to but, holy shit, once you really get it, it just does NOT let you go. This is such an achievement in terms of creating a song that really sets apart the difference between having sex and making love. So many songs use "love" as a placeholder for "sex" and this is a song that says "NO, those are two VERY different things" and doesn't let you forget it. Covers a lot of the same themes as Dance For You by Beyonce, to the point where I see them as sister songs. I love the almost 80s sound of the instrumental.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): i think im slowly starting to crush on my best friend again so sadly #relatable again

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): This song added 5 years to my life, cleared my skin, turner my GPA into a 4.0, and straight up parted the clouds outside my window and showed me the gates of heaven.

**camirose** (10): This song becomes more beautiful every time I listen to it and the lyrics "there is an indention in the shape of you, made your mark on me, a golden tattoo" are some of her most intimate, in my opinion.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Naughty. Me likey.

**rickikardashian** (10): Taylor's mom when she played this on the secret sessions

**specfagular** (10): THIS IS THE BEST SONG TAYLOR HAS EVER WRITTEN IF PRAYING WASN'T HERE SHE'D GET MY 11

**theNealCutter** (10): when I was over with the "Delicate-stage" of our relationship, this song took its spot. it's the feeling of connection both physically and emotionally. there's something about Taylor's somber and subdued delivery that makes it feel like she's singing it with a wide-eye, fully in love, desperate look. This is what King Of My Heart, Gorgeous, Dancing With Our Hands Tied, and So It Goes... tried and failed to do, to be sexy without even trying.

**zamomattel** (10): all these bops, she really has the mind of a mastermind

**leviswift13** (9.7): ah-aH-AH-AHHHHHHHHHH

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.5): brb finding a daddy

**topesmachine** (9.5): this is where I want taylor to go tbh

**kromosol** (9.1): Only bought this dress so you could take it off

**nooodisaster** (9): I was like "oo sexy", and then my lesbian friend told me this was a secret queer anthem. Evidence: 1) "Our secret moments in a crowded room/They got no idea about me and you." 2) "Everyone thinks that they know us, but they know nothing." 3) "And I woke up just in time/now I wake up by your side" (... sexual awakening???). 4) And the real fucking kicker is that smack in the middle of the chorus, repeated over and over throughout the song, "I don't want you like a best friend"

**SkyBlade79** (9): taylor swift actually succesffuly made a sexy song? Wh?

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): I could listen to that bridge over and over again

**vayyiqra** (9): pretty

**vhqv1997** (9): Imagine Fearless-era Taylor listening to this

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): This is a bit too straight for me but also really hot

**jhxcb** (8.2): It's fun and sexy, but I think the production is really off. I can't pinpoint exactly what it is, but something is just off.

**poppinmmolly** (8.2): this song gets a lot of hate but I love it

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): Sensual taylor returns, but not much memorable outside "only bought this dress so you could take it off"

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Kinda sounds like a bootleg Melodrama song but Melodrama is fire so it's cool

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (8): what an amazing pre chorus..... but chorus kinda trash

**itsboogiepanda** (8): Once again the highlight is the bridge

**MashLuke** (8): nothing is better than listening to this while having a champagne risotto

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): A lesbian anthem

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Even when I started to like Reputation just a little, I would have given this a six, but now it sounds pretty great to me. ...I mean, yes, this is partially because of the...uh, subtext. Even then, I think her voice sounds ethereal here, and I find it charing how her first unambiguously sexual song is not tryhard or cringeworthy like some other songs off the album, but instead intimate to its core. There's one person this sounds a thousand times better to and that's the person Taylor loves.

**skargardin** (8): It had to grow on me, but I've grown to appreciate it a lot more.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Taylor did a sex thing!!! For real though, outside of a few awkward lyrics ("at least we were electrified" and that entire verse), and the chorus being decidedly unsexy, this song is entrancing. "I only bought this dress so you can take it off" is provocative if you're Taylor Swift, but it's catchy if you're a human being (but still, Susanne Sundfør did it first). Also, that bridge is classic Taylor and I love it.



**I'm Thirsty**
---

**Piccprincess** (6): I want Calvin to take this dress off


**Took Off This Dress and Got an STD**
--- 

**Glennishill** (4): This is just a mediocre filler track. Taylor's trying here but her persona has never been the "lets get drunk and fuck" type so the song comes across as pretty disingenuous.

**Itsafudgingstick** (4): Meh

**joshually** (4): I don't know whether to love or hate this song, so it's going firmly in the center of my points

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): no

**TragicKingdom1** (4): Lyrics say this is supposed to be a sexy slow jam but it comes off more like one of the 1989 ballads which doesn't work at all.

**dirdbub** (3.5): ZAYN's "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" falsetto teas with the vocals on this song

**strawberryswing1** (3.5): I gotta hand it to Taylor, I didn't know it was possible to make a song about sex be so, so unsexy

**kappyko** (3): This album has a really diverse sound but somehow "Dress" manages to sound like all of them and be boring filler

**OriginalKappa** (3): ew

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2.5): ew

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (1.5): Not a fan of Taylor's sex noises and her falsetto. The song is just also kind of annoying too. However I am a fan of the bisexuality speculation that arose from this song so that's a positive I suppose. Doesn't make it a good song though.

**MrSwearword** (1): more like a skort/coulat set

**dropthehammer11** (0): This song is god awful I'm sorry. Taylor trying to be sensual does not work at all. Her breathy vocals are very offputting, writing isn't good, production is kinda clunky, all around a very bad song.

**SEXXX DREAMS**
---

**VeganSquash** (6): Yaaas Taylor get that big beefy juicy dick

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Taylor is a dominatrix sex queen, bow down to her or get spanked.

**awryj** (7): http://www.themainstreetmouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pearl.jpg



**Ed Sheeran Gives Me Sex Dreams**
---

**cyborglilith** (8): there's an indentation in the shape of you

**twat\_brained** (8.7): https://imgur.com/2CNtIYc

**Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life**
---
**robbiec\_** (7): I wore a dress and put on green body paint on Halloween I went as Princess Fiona to an all-male Disney Princess Party and yes I know it's Dreamworks then got very cross faded and got in a fight with my friend and hit them and started crying and the paint ran off my face and stained the wall and the floor in my flat

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.4): From a lot of lists I've seen this song placed in the bottom a lot, but for me its one of my favourites.

**The Only Comment Worth Highlighting**
--- 

**FranklyTheTurtle** (5): is that the fucking running sound from the flintstones

[For reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJqJYOWplws)

---

**Wailordfan_** (10): First of all, 5 people gave this an 11. I respect your sacrifices. However, I get major Kanye production teas from this tbh, and I don't get where people are coming from with this 'over produced mess' critique (but I also love rep, so who knows?)

---

**POWERFUL, STRONG, BEAUTIFUL**
---


**MissyBee37** (11): The epitome of Katy Perry; she's at her peak here, bringing so many things full circle and wrapping itall in a big, booming bow: a bit of her gospel roots, her childhood, her climb to the spotlight, her life spent soul-searching & growing to be the person she is today and her career full of inspirational & empowering songs. One of my fave. Katy vocals; she commands her voice so, sooo well, whether she lets it flow smooth & polished; belts it big & bold; or harnesses it with a husky simmer (start of the final chorus). She just owns her power on this song and demands the rest of the world see it, too.

**robbiec\_** (11): that noise between the first chorus and the second verse was one of my favourite music moments last year, also much better than Hey Hey Hey which I assumed was the same premise. also the drums BANG the woo and the SAXOPHONE

**sletrab07** (11): I already elaborated why this one was getting my 11 in the rate post.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): unlike some of her other sonic experiments on the album, Katy really hit it out of the park with this. it's intimidating, it's fierce, it's just... Powerful. it was hard to not give my favorite song on the album my 11, but i explain it better on that song's comment.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I consider this the sequel to Circle the Drain. I love everything going on in this song.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): Can we just talk about how this song had me slain from minute 1 with that extended drum solo?!?!? Also production aside, I think this truly has the best lyrics of any song on this album. Seriously, like if Witness was an album of more songs like the title track, Roulette and Power, I would fucking STAN

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): honestly, u/sletrab07's comment made me appreciate this. It's an intricate song at best. I was gonna whine about the sudden shift in vocal production in the chorus, but I realized it was intentional due to the metaphorical aspect of her shredding through the speakers with her "Power."

**PuggleMaster** (10): the drums snatch me every time

**SkyBlade79** (10): this is really really good… issa bop. Strong vocals, amazing production, good message…

**specfagular** (10): GOD the drums in this and Katy's vocals are GREAT. Production is top notch

**topesmachine** (10): this song is really good damn those drums surprised the hell out of me and my wig

**VeganSquash** (10): one of my favorites from Witness, the production is great

**whatareblackhole** (10): Okay, the sample in this is so good and the production is intensely good. Good for you, Ms. Perry! I miss her being this confident in a sound.

**leviswift13** (9.6): The chorus is perfect and this actually has some of the best lyrics of Katy's career.

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): YAS KATY SLAY GODDESS

**thetimidmartian** (9.5): the vocal processing here is well done, the lyrics are thoughtful (oh wow) and the vocals are strong. the low chorus toward the backside of the track was a good choice, some of the ad libs are a little screamed.

**zamomattel** (9.5): THAT production like wow

**angusaditus** (9): http://i.imgur.com/gxHfWo7.gif

**Glennishill** (9): I started typing this comment intending to be down on this song but then the chorus hit and damn. From the second that chorus starts the energy goes to 11. I love Katy's vocals and I love the distortion/compression on her voice.

**hikkaru** (9): I love the production so much!!!

**MashLuke** (9): the best song in this album

**milkywayinradius** (9): Those drums, that sax, am I hearing eagles screeching in the background? This song is obv about America

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Probably the most experimental track Katy's ever released, and, boy, does it deliver. I like her distorted vocals, and I like the choppy sound the track brings overall. Kanye still outpeaked, though,

**awryj** (8.8): this track is crazy

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Blue flame is the powerful one (on a Bunsen burner at least), queen of paying attention in Chemistry lessons


**kappyko** (8.5): This beat is crazier than the beating /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah gives to his meat every time he watches E.T.

**rickikardashian** (8.2): that battery is fucking bad ass

**banananaise** (8): this has a indietronic vibe which isn't something i've heard in mainstream pop before

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): I'm digging this, mostly the production only though

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): The production on the hook is so good, I didn't even take notice the first time I listened and I regret it.

**vayyiqra** (8): feminist bop

**:thetea:**
---
**twat\_brained** (6.9): What do Katy Perry and Kanye West have in common? They both peaked in 2010. Oh, and I guess the whole BS with Taylor Swift. And the fact that they both married talentless hacks. As I type this out, I'm also just remembering they had a #1 together. These two are more similar than I thought. Hmmm… Oh yeah, the song. It's cute but it just feels like a rehash of the whole "empowering" pop schtick Katy's relied on these past few years.


**The Only Relevant Girl Group Left**
--- 

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Little Mix did it better.

**SpanKKy1** (7): little mix quaking

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): little mix did it better and even their song is a mess


**WEAK, UGLY, WIMPY**
---

**enecks** (5): Once you name your song the same thing as a Kanye song you have a high bar to vault. Lol no. Not even close. Clashing nonsense that barely makes anything. It's like a bad plunderphonics artist doing a sellout song.


**jonnl2806** (5): The fact that I forgot I was listening to the song halfway through it says a lot.

**deadspiderwall** (4.5): how long is this album?

**1313Harbor** (4): Woke Katy Perry is too disingenuous for me. I'm probably a bad feminist for that.

**camerinian** (4): The first 10 seconds are actually really good, with the twisted sax line and that crashing drum line, and then it goes into more of the same boring shit omg I hate this album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This sounds like Sleigh Bells but bad, Katy please (but those synths near the end are good)

**ulikejazz** (4): Nice synths, but that's it. Also, only one song deserves this title

**Brendon-Urine** (3): The overblown production is way too much

**ClocktowerMaria** (3): awful

**itsboogiepanda** (3): I find this song to be an incoherent juxtaposition of elements with different influences

**theNealCutter** (3): This is a waste of good production honestly. The lyrics, as usual is super boring. She says she's a goddess, but there's not much of a buildup from the preceding tracks to merit this song's empowerment. And the mess at the end of the final chorus is full of unnecessary production choices. Like why is there a falcon's screech and why are you using that tragic drum fill? It had a good start, but the bad parts of it just outweigh it all.

**fifthchevron** (2): Production is awful

**MrSwearword** (2): I was fine before that scattershot as fuck drum pattern but OK, wurq.

**joshually** (1): "I am my mother's daughter" WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS TOO DEEP TOO DEEP

deleted: **:thetea: 2.0**

**nooodisaster** (1): Rant incoming: In the first verse of this song we get these lines: "Yeah, I am my mother's daughter/And there are so many things I love about her / But I have, I have to break the cycle/So I can sit first at the dinner table." The thing that pisses me off about this verse in particular, is that Katy seems to be taking interesting feminist pop-voices and distilling away all the nuance of what made them interesting. The "seat at the table" line to me conjures up images of Solange's recent solo album, which in its original form was a daring and personal look at being a WOC, but here it's just the end of a boring verse about girl power. The line about being "a goddess and you know it" reminds me of Banks, but without the personal tell-all details that make Banks so interesting. It doesn't matter if Katy took these ideas or not, what's important is that they've been done, done earlier, and done with more nuance and intrigue. Katy is trying so hard to cast this image as a woke pop-star, but everything we're getting from her is Gender Studies 100, down to the impersonal textbook adages. 80% of this song is slow ass tell-not-show white feminism 101 verses. It's not bad, it's just boring. Take a shot every time she uses an overdone saying ("Don't bite the hand that feeds"), and another shot every time she tries to make this interesting by adding something that ends up just as mundane ("or you'll, You'll never eat, no-oh") Beyond the mess of lyrics, we're left with ugly, plodding production that sounds like someone listened to Hoizer or OneRepublic and thought if they just made Katy's vocals sound like sandpaper against wood it'd sell to that market. Look, I know there may be worse songs in this rate, one's you might feel stronger about in hatred. I can even admit the chorus is kinda catchy (if not in the good way). Still, I hope I articulated why this song pisses me the fuck off. For your consideration: Power, a 1.

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (10): I mentioned this song in my Woman comment; and no offense to Woman but this is how you make a feminist anthem (is it problematic for me to decide that? Discuss). Easily one of the standout tracks from the album, Power is a girl-power but I wouldn't exactly call it that. A lot of girl-power anthems are upbeat whereas Power feels a bit slower and heavy, like its trudging instead of skipping; the drums at the begging and end of the song and again at the end of the chorus add to this (which are awesome btw). Katy's Power almost feels more real, like its not all dressed up in glitter. Katy expresses femininity with examples that have so much meaning packed into them that are instantly recognizable: “I have to break the cycle so I can sit first at the dinner table.” This lyric alone has multiple ways to read it depending on the meaning of first. One way is if she is the first to actually sit at the table, shes not the one who has to cook, a common stereotype, and instead shes waiting to be served her meal. The second meaning can be first as in the main seat, Katy gets to seat at the end of the table, a seat often held by the father or the head of the house. Moving on we get to the chorus with some more examples, Katy compares herself to flowers; kind of a basic one so I'll skip it. She then says “Stole my time but I'l make up the hours”, this can be interpreted on how women often have to work harder than men to produce the same results; alternatively he could have stole her “hours” of hard work and taken credit for it. “Some respect you better show it”, self explanatory. On to the second verse we hear, “Hell hath no fury like a woman.”, which not only sounds cool but the follow up line of “burning like a blue flame” adds to it since blue flames are hotter than red flames, contrary to what we associate those colours with. She follows up AGAIN with “Don't mistake my warmth for weakness”. Women are thought to be kinder and gentler than men. “Don't bite the hand that feeds or you'll never eat”, again another nod to how women are told to cook, but this time Katy says she willingly chooses to be the provider of food, however “biting” her will result in a famine. I'm not gonna talk about the bridge since its kinda basic and I would be making so many stretches.

**It's Their *Passion* That Counts!**
---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (11): sigh there seems to be some dislike/stigma against this song for whatever stupid reason, but you hos need to wake up and understand its greatness. dolly and kesha both KILL vocally, and their passion is just.. unmatchable. those belts at the end are fucking incredible. wow.

**deadspiderwall** (11): QUEEN DOLLY- I love this song, beautiful!

**topesmachine** (11): a collab with Dolly Parton??? On a song written by Kesha's mom??? how could this NOT get my 11

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): how can you have a song featuring Dolly Parton and not give it a 10??? okay lets forget about Younger Now because that album never existed and never will... anyways, this is a really nice and beautiful song, and very very relatable lol

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): wig

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): dollysus part-the-red-sea-ton

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a GOOD duet! FUCK POPHEADS

**joshually** (10): the most subtle, nuanced diva duet of the last decade. Bravo to Kesha and America's Living National Treasure Dolly Parton.

**letsallpoo** (10): yee haw

**Mudkip1** (10): i'm giving this a 10 only because we have to respect the elderly (just kidding i love dolly parton so much jolene is one of the best songs ever)

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Two National Treasures on the same song, we don't deserve either of them.

**rickikardashian** (10): This will be eliminated on Day 1, and I'm at peace with that. I know this is good, I know Dolly is the best thing to happen to the music industry, and i know the rest of the world is wrong

**skargardin** (10): This is one amazing cover and they harmonize so very well, I adore everything about this track.

**SupremeShani** (10): This song has absolutely beautiful songwriting, some might say the candle metaphors may be too on the nose, but I still find them clever.

**1313Harbor** (9.5): A queen supporting a queen.

**awryj** (9): aww

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (9): A wonderful ballad

**fourchip** (9): very cute little duet that made my heart melt. always listen to it when i need a pick me up

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Another strong ballad on this album, Katy is shook... Kesha and Dolly sound amazing together.

**vhqv1997** (9): This was such a powerful song, Kesha and Dolly singing a duet co-written by the former's mother, and the latter being such a big idol of the former

**Albert\_Cole** (8.6): I'm not all that big a fan of this version? Both of their individual versions are good, but this just seems to ignore the lyrics in favour of big, overdramatic production. And the lyrics are really good (props to Pebe) so it's a shame

**specfagular** (8.5): I'm a southern gay I have a guilty pleasure for classic country

**camerinian** (8): wow suddenly im a dolly parton stan how did that happen

**Bromance of the Century**
---

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (8): old flames can't hold a candle to /u/letsallpoo


**This Isn't Bad, But Wow Is It Just There**
---

**crowlily** (7.2): Country-ish and enjoyable. I like the harmonies!

**jhxcb** (7.1): It's a classic, it's written by her mom; I get it, it's emotional. But also, she's already done it. She slays it, for sure, but it's also a little too country. I think Kesha is doing great hen she adds country elements, but she is a pop and pop-rock artist and I think she needs to be careful not to dive to far into the country pool.

**enecks** (7): This is the only song in the album that feels like it's only there as an obligation, not out of passion. Yeah sure get a Dolly Parton feature that'll make the critics kinder to the country leanings of the album. still solid

**MashLuke** (7): not bad but I'm not feeling blue in Texas right now

**melodyllic\_** (7): cute and vintage but memorable it is not

**TheLastAxolotl** (7): Decent tribute to her mom's songwriting

**whatareblackhole** (7): I love this song, but I skip it because all of the original material is stellar. (Sorry, Dolly!)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.7): i love this but I wish they toned down the oversinging towards the end of the track. Especially Kesha. Her voice can honestly be too grating at times.

**jonnl2806** (6.5): Cute but feels out of place

**thetimidmartian** (6.5): dolly is in her element here and kesha is not, but i live for that trading at the end

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): Pretty nice but it's just a cover

**dirdbub** (6): aw a nice vocal duet that I won't remember

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Considering the star power of this cover and how Kesha's mom wrote this song, it's disapointing that this cover is one of the weakest songs in the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): not bad just boring.

**kromosol** (6): This one is a miss for me ...

**nooodisaster** (6): The Deconstructed version of this is better, sry.

**SkyBlade79** (6): not bad, parton

**vayyiqra** (6): please no more country

**Glennishill** (5): I won't disparage the good name of Dolly Parton so I'll just say I don't like this song and leave it at that.

**izeasklapaucius** (5): My mom would love this.


**Old Garbage**
--- 

**natsby** (5): it's basically exactly what I expected based off just reading the title. not bad, but not particularly interesting (this is probably blasphemy idk)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I love Dolly but this collab is more snoozy than the legacy collab on Lust for Life

**twat\_brained** (5): This feels like a waste of a collab honestly

**VeganSquash** (5): meh, not a big fan of covers on albums, its just boring and unoriginal to me.

**therokinrolla** (4.5): I want to like this song soooo badly. But it drones on for so long, and it really does drone. I think it is an important song, and I am more than happy it is on the album, but I don't get it.

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (4): kinda a big snoozefest

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (3): I really wish I could get into it, but for whatever reason it just didn't do it for me.

**CarlieScion** (3): This song is boring

**itsboogiepanda** (3): Me 'previous track is dull' Kesha 'hold my mic'

**Elitefourbrad** (2): Dolly I'm sorry, but honey you can do way better than this.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): zzzzz

**PuggleMaster** (1): this is really bad omg

First of all, I'm really fucking surprised that you gays let this live until day 2. With Taylor's rapping at full force here, and seeing how you guys dragged LWYMMD, I really thought this would sit in the bottom 5 the whole time, but nooooo

[But you let her live, even if she only made top 30, you still let this girl pass off her rapping and thought it was better than nearly half of Katy's album]( https://gph.is/1ucnvUF)

---

**I'm Ready For It (To Impregnate Me)**
---

**camirose** (11): This song has grown on me so much. I started off loving it, then became lukewarm, then quit playing it for months altogether and it's now my most played since the album's release. It's unique, and I think it's really cute, mysterious, and sexy at the same time.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): I just love this song, it will always take me back to last year's Fall. It has a special feeling in it for me, especially that chorus. I can't find a single flaw in it. Lyrics are great, production is great, mv is great, etc. also that last chorus...girl...wigless

**CreepyMannequin** (10): A bop! Don't know why this is so hated.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember hearing a snippet of it and I really thought it was garbage but turns out it's not the case when I heard the full song! Everytime I listen to this song, I am always shook because this is so different from everything Taylor has done. It may sound outdated in a few years but I don't care, I am going to give a lap dance to a future boyfriend to this song.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Wow what a start to the album. It gives you that electropop feel that the album has going for it, complete with Taylor rapping better than Drake.

**fourchip** (10): step aside, kiddos, the industry's newest light skinned rapper has arrived and she ain't come to play

**gannade** (10): A serious guilty pleasure. I-I-I-Island breeze in a faux caribbean accent never sounded so good.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): kanye who?

**joshually** (10): Why does this song get such hate?? That chorus is EVERYTHING

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I don't get why people dislike this, this is a fucking banger and a single-worthy track.

**MrSwearword** (10): legitimately a great song especially from recent era Taylor...or Taylor in general.

**robbiec\_** (10): SNAPPED

**SpanKKy1** (10): a contender for her worst music video

**TheStarSquad** (10): This song was easily my favourite of the four singles Taylor released, and in my opinion it goes above and beyond most of 1989. At first I was sceptical of the musical style that is very different from anything she's released before, but after a few listens I really got into the flow of RFI. The chorus is untouchable pop perfection, but I honestly love the verses just as much. The half rapping/half singing way she delivers the lines is golden. My personal favourite is "Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so", the way she says "so" makes me want to scream. It's a great workout song and it also goes OFF at a party. When the little triple beat thing happens after the chorus I am on the floor. EVERYTHING is perfect about "...Ready For It?", the style, the flow, the lyrics, the danceability, I love every aspect about it.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): This song is such a banger. It gets so me so pumped whenever I listen to it. I love the contrast between the verses and the chorus, love the light floaty choruses transitioning into the last full throated one, and I don't even think any of the sing-rapping is cringey except "you can be a phantom/holding me for ransom."

**zamomattel** (10): it's the most played song on my last.fm for a reason

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9.5): STATE OF GRACE IS STILL THE BEST ALBUM OPENER EVER https://i.redd.it/erdznqap5ytz.jpg

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): i i i SEE

**jhxcb** (9.4): I actually really like this. It's fun, great choice for an opener, and very appropriate use of the trop-pop trend. I think the two very different parts of the song flow together very well, which can be extremely difficult to do.

**leviswift13** (9.1): This was the perfect opener for her. I mean, what a way to open an album about such a crazy time in her life. Her ad-libs in the last chorus got me pregnant.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): I think it's great. I know Todd in the Shadows named this his worst song of the year, and I respect his opinion (and often adopt it, tbh) but this is Max Martin doing some of his best build-up/playing-elements-off-each-other in years. It's a lot more subtle than it sounds.

**CarlieScion** (9): ~~I'm still not sure if I love or hate this track~~ okay i love this now

**kappyko** (9): No I was not

**melodyllic\_** (9): t swizzle mixtape when

**milkywayinradius** (9): don't judge me

**PuggleMaster** (9): i only gave it a high score for the production and the chorus

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i like it and if you don't then you're racist against rappers

**vayyiqra** (9): this some trap shit

**vhqv1997** (9): Imagine if the MV had lived up to the hype

**therokinrolla** (8.8): a fucking mess. A loveable fucking mess, though. I don't really understand the people that say the only good part is the climax( Baby, let the games begin), because Taylor's rapping, though a mess, slays us with some iconic lines ( "burton to this taylor" "phantom, holding him for ransom"), and the prechorus BUILDS. But yea, a good song.

**awryj** (8.5): I like this song. I like the farting bass, I like the white girl rapping, I like the awkward metaphors, I like the Max Martin buildup, I like the anti-drop. Fite me.

**hikkaru** (8.5): i'm ready for it to be robbed

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): this took so long to grow on me. I hated it when it first came out. But now I know it's a bop.

**stardustanddinos** (8.5): Damn, what an opener. I love the distorted trap beat, and the pre-chorus is so gooddddd, chorus could have gone off harder, but i love it anyway. She is an assertive lover who knows what she wants!

**cyborglilith** (8): The chorus bells do not fit the aggressive rap verses, but it's still catchy. For real though, Taylor raps better than Adele on this afternoon-fitted song.

**jonnl2806** (8): Should have been the lead single tbh.

**MashLuke** (8): the beat goes off

**nooodisaster** (8): This seems like a simple bop, until you realize the structure for this song is INSANE

**Piccprincess** (8): I'm ready for CALVIN HARRIS


**SkyBlade79** (8): a bop, tbh. I like the pre-chorus and I'm probably the minority but the rap verses are good too

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I did not like this song as a single at all, but it's really grown on me since then.

**strawberryswing1** (8): I shouldn't like this as much as I do but it's a really good song to get pumped up to. It helped me chug through homework when I was exhausted.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Probably to be one of the more controversial songs in the rate, opinions on this rate from "omg taylor raps" to "oh god why". And for me, I quite dig it. The BWAMP BWAMP BWAMP BWAMPS are a bit melodramatic, and the song as a whole is messy, but it's quite a bit of fun.

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Great opener, let the games begin indeed

**A… Take**

**itsboogiepanda** (7): I c o n i c MV but the song is just okay. Starting to like the song more the less airplay it gets on radio and when the beat drops I just want to slut drop to it

deleted: **This Is A Bad Song, But It Is A Guilty Pleasure**
---

**Raykel** (8): This grew on me. I still don't really like the blown out bass but I love everything else.

**skargardin** (8): The verses and the pseudo-rapping are a drag to get through, even though her "rapping" isn't half bad, but the reward is one of Taylor's best and catchiest choruses yet.

**kromosol** (7): Everything besides pre chorus is a huge mess for me. But just because of that pre chorus I'm gonna give this song a 7.

**natsby** (7): this isn't a good song but I've listened to it enough that I solidly like it

**OriginalKappa** (7): should totally be lower but something about this track draws me in

**theNealCutter** (7): it's a song I relisten from time to time, but honestly, it's not much. the hook is nice I guess. and the final act it just wild.

**whatareblackhole** (7): I'm getting so sick of trop-pop, but this song (kinda) slaps.
**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): This would be so much better if there was an actual chorus and the verses weren't so bad. Also, it would have been a better lead single than LWYMMD.

**MissyBee37** (6.4): I'm going to be more generous than on Jukebox because, tbh, it's the only song I still listen to. It's a fun workout song with a ton of energy. I hate the idea & execution of Taylor rapping. But. The sick beat she referenced showed UP for this track! I like the pre-chorus & chorus. They're pretty & I like how they build - the final set are great. I'm torn; last time I scored leaning into how much I truly hate the verses, but it has grown on me, so today I'm leaning into how much better other parts are.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): The opening is really hard on the ears at first listen, and Taylor's rapping is a pretty mixed bag. She has clever lines here and there, and it's certainly not the worst attempt at rapping from a white blonde pop star (I'M NOT A CHIRSTIAN AND I'M NOT A JEW) but on my worst days the verses continue to grate on my ears. The pre-chorus, however, is legitimately fantastic...a fact which is ruined by the grating sounds of the first few seconds coming back in a cringeworthy drop. Overall, this isn't a great song, but Taylor was bold enough to make a song like this, and most people admit that it has its merits, with some even outright liking it. That's impressive enough, in my humble opinion.

**A Good Take**

**VeganSquash** (5): I actually don't like the chorus, the verses are way better lol



**It's A Shit Story**
---

**Glennishill** (4): Oh boy, here we fucking go. Taylor Swift rapping is awful. The pre-chorus and chorus are good but the second the verses start back up it's back to that slog of a pop song. These lyrics are cringe.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): The chorus is really good. So good it should be it's own song. But the "drop" and the verses are just an assault to my ears.

**SupremeShani** (4): I do respect Taylor for trying to do something different, but she cannot rap to save her life, and the catchiness of the chorus still doesn't excuse some of the worst lyrics Taylor has ever written. As the album opener and with a title like that, it almost sounds like she is warning her fans of the disappointment to come.

**VodkaInsipido** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EOSgjpS2k0

**topesmachine** (3): this song is beautifully produced but Taylor is 100% the wrong performer and I prefer the Kidz Bop version for some reason. Taylor's delivery here is just really bad but the song itself is fine??? I'm so conflicted no never mind the song is bad too, just the production is good

**camerinian** (2): Prepare to hear this song in movie trailers for years to come once Taylor's stock drops so low that it's cheaper for studios to buy the rights to songs from her than from Imagine Dragons

**fifthchevron** (2): I'm willing to bet she put this on the album simply because it will make for an amazing tour opener.

**tevinterimperium** (2): The chorus is the only good part of this song, but it's still not enough to redeem it.

**thetimidmartian** (2): the chorus is damn unlistenable, the production is doing heavy work to make her worth listening to and it almost succeeds throughout the verses but the chorus is amazingly bad

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (1): oh my god taylor why

**dropthehammer11** (1): I really hate this song. The production is so goddamn tacky, her rapping is very awkward and flat, the writing is bad, just an all around awful song. What keeps this from a 0 is the decent pre-chorus.

**enecks** (1): Christ going from Kesha's nuanced lyrics and production to this is like accidentally scrolling to the start of a furry porn artist's twitter. Except unlike those lovely people who make me nut to sexy lizard people, Taylor has far from improved. It's an incomprehensible mess that somehow feels chaotic and overmanaged. Every bad vocal "flourish", every bad punchline, every thud of that garbage beat - it's all so predictably dogshit. At least Look What You Made Me Do is an interesting trainwreck.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): taylor swift..................... rapping.................................... unironically..................................... she literally made fun of "what if I was a rapper? lul" with T-Pain...............................

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): Just the worst mix of not interesting enough and too messy. Some of my least favorite work Max Martin has ever done, with blasting synth-fuzz straight out of a bad Will.i.am beat circa 2010.

**twat\_brained** (1): When I first heard this I thought it was Nicki Minaj poorly reattempting her "Hey Mama" verses. Instead, it was actually Taylor poorly reattempting to revamp her image. More importantly, how do you forget John Mayer's name? Or Joe Jonas? Or heaven fucking forbid HAROLD EDWARD STYLES, BORN FEBRUARY 1, 1994, FROM HOLMES CHAPEL IN CHESHIRE, WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE BIGGEST BOYBAND OF THE DECADE, WHO FREQUENTLY COVERS THE HIGHEST-RATED SONG ON R/POPHEADS, AND TO WHOM YOUR BEST SONG ON 1989 IS A DIRECT REFERENCE TO?!?!?! I won't dissertate, but I will say this: I was, in fact, …not ready for it. Or for any of this, quite frankly.

**Brendon-Urine** (0): This song is so bad. It's awful. I hate it. The production is terrible. The attempt at rapping is horrendous. Why this was released as a single is beyond me.

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (0): Holy shit I hate this song. The intro is kanye production, but bad. The verses are somehow Cher Lloyd, but even worse. She sings (or raps) about "Island dreams" over clatter, dark, grating percussion. The only parts of this that don't sound annoyingly "Yeah, see, I can make music for the cool kids" are the generic robotic chorus and bridge. i genuinely don't know why anyone would want to listen to this. The max martin style of bringing the elements from the choruses, bridges, and verse together at the end is miles away from his best, or even good, work.

**JackLebowski** (0): This songs is just wrong, is all the things I thought Taylor wouldn't do after she did Shake It Off. A rap verse? Really?

**Mudkip1** (0): i can't even properly explain in words how much i detest this song. if i could give this song a -20 i wouldn't hesitate, bitch

**swadadu** (0): An awful song all around. This song's existence is offensive to me.

**fourchip** (10): this is probably the messiest song of 2017, I don't even know where to start

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lol I fucking hated this when it came out and the video is godawful and now it's on my workout playlist and I love it so much.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Nicki coming with that renegades.

**milkywayinradius** (10): Fun, dorky song. I like it when artists don't take themselves too seriously

**MissyBee37** (10): LOVE. That beeeeat; I'm obsessed. I love her tone here lyrically -- it's biting but playful. The production is stellar -- love the house beat & instrumental, so slinky & smooth. Nicki is maybe the best Katy feature, in close competition with Snoop Dogg. Nicki just straight-up kills her verse. It's one of the few rap features for which I know every word. Their can't-touch-me attitude, wrapped up in that delicious hook is everything. I'm still so sad this wasn't a smash hit.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I just love everything about this song

**rickikardashian** (10): if you Vogue hard enough to this you don't even notice the lyrics!

**skargardin** (10): This is one hell of a house-banger. Duke Dumont seriously should've produced some more of the Witness songs. Nicki's verse is business as usual for her but it's still pretty lit.

**theNealCutter** (10): Groovy beat, funky bassline, and heaps of infectious stage presence. I love how she's being petty and enjoying it. Nicki's performance is fire too. I love how they don't take the song very seriously, that they know that the feud is petty itself. Honestly, this is only a 10 because Nicki delivered a fire verse.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Huge bop. While Taylor's shade tracks get often dragged down by annoying production and taking themselves too seriously, Katy has the right amount of swagger on this song and very danceable production. Nicki comes through nicely with the guest verse as well.

**twat\_brained** (10): PINK FERRAGAMO SLIDERS ON DECK SILLY RAP BEEFS JUST GIVE ME MORE CHECKS MY LIFE IS A MOVIE I'M NEVER OFFSET ME AND MY AMIGOS, NO, NOT OFFSET. Nicki is this song's saving grace which really makes me feel for Katy because she's getting upstaged on her own album. Get it together, Katy! Make more '90s house-influenced songs for KP5.

**vayyiqra** (10): iconic meme bop

**zamomattel** (10): nicki's best verse in years

**topesmachine** (9.9): I HATE THAT I LOVE THIS SONG OMG, if the video didn't exist it would have a 10 but it has to factor in at least slightly

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): a guilty pleasure

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): let's be real we all thought this was megabop before the video came out and ruined it

**jhxcb** (9.2): This is one of my favorite Katy Perry songs, to be honest. It's petty and I love it.

**angusaditus** (9): goes off in the club + nicki delivered http://i.imgur.com/Lpa2IZd.gif

**bwc222** (9): awesome song, horrendous video; also, points docked for q-pon instead of coupon

**CarlieScion** (9): Nicki's verse is straight fire. The song is also catchy-er than I'd like to admit

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (9): An amazing song with fantastic beat, samples, drop, and nicki minaj verse. But Katy, what are you doing with these lyrics???

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As much as I still like this song, this song didn't really age well in terms of production. Still, it's a bop and Nicki definitely killed her verse here. Also, I think I am one of the few people who actually liked the video music.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): House Music doesn't do much for me, but this is great. And Nicki killed it here.

**Raykel** (9): The synths are so good and this is Nicki's best verse since Side to Side.

**robbiec\_** (9): I am sick of this song now but god what fun it was when it came out. it always reminds me of getting lost in a forest because it got dark around us and my dancer friend got scared so I put this song on and she strutted out of there

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): this song is laughable but i love it... anyway the beef is manufactured sis

**tevinterimperium** (9): BOP ALERT

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is legitimately one of the only songs on this album that I like, and while it's cheesy, it's damn fun. Nicki does well here, and while the song itself sounds dated as hell, with mediocre lyrics, the non-chorus is instantly quotable.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/782ed067937c6161db1f122a39df641b.jpg

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): This song is so insanely catchy that I can forgive the cringy lyrics. I had it on repeat for weeks.

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): Anotha one in the basket…what a bop

**kromosol** (8.5): I still think that this is a bop.

**Brendon-Urine** (8): A bop. Nicki's verse got me shook.

**camerinian** (8): Easily the album highlight, and the fact that it's only barely above 'basically pretty good' says way more about this era of Katy than I ever could

**dropthehammer11** (8): This is quite the song, there's a lot to say about it, but at the end of the day, I like this a lot. Very catchy and memorable.

**DrunkHurricane** (8): pretty big guilty pleasure

**joshually** (8): Bed Bath & Beyond would like a word with you, Ms. Perry

**Mudkip1** (8): i overplayed this lol it's still p good though

**natsby** (8): I am ashamed to say this, of all things, is what got me into Nicki Minaj. Good song, just going to ignore the video.

**SkyBlade79** (8): I remember this was so hyped when it was promoed… it's not so good now but it still bops



**Sliders On Deck**
---

**whatareblackhole** (7): This beat is actually sickening! Nicki really propels this song.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7.5): ehh. if it wasnt for nicki this would be a great contender for my lowest scores besides 0, but her lines really push this song into the "decent" category. katy is still cringy, and its a lot coming from me, who loved her hosting of VMA

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Nicki SNAPPED

**crowlily** (6.8): swish swish is a bop except for the chorus. even worse chorus than lwymmd and yikes cringe-y lyrics... the first verse was good why did this happen... nicki's great! okay I hate the way she sings "another one in the casket" and i hate the "they know what is what" damn

**dirdbub** (6.5): I need rappers (THAT AREN'T MESSY) on more house beats, damn. best part of the song

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Katy's lyrics give me diarrhea; Nicki's verse slays me. I have no desire to go back to this song, but I've scrobbled it 40 times. What do I do?

**stardustanddinos** (6.5): Mixed feelings about this one. It has ridiculous lyrics that try too hard at throwing shade but fail. Nicki's fire verse carries it really well though.

**1313Harbor** (6): The bass line is sick, but we already been knew that in Truffle Butter… I can do without the Katy parts, but Miss Minaj elevates the song for me.


**SupremeShani** (6): It's a shame that this flawless house beat was wasted on a song. Katy's decision to dedicate a song to a feud with a basically dead woman at the time is questionable to say the least. Nicki Minaj salvages an otherwise wreck of a song.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (5.5): Imagine coming out of a feud looking less dangerous than Taylor fucking Swift. The gays were too kind to this one; the songwriting is atrocious and it's about 30 seconds too long. That being said, not even Katy can hold that beat or Nicki's verse (this bitch is a stan) back.

**Feminism… Or Something**
---

**jimmy345960** (5.1): Can Taylor and Katy write one solid dis track about each other? Like Bad Blood is the worst song Taylor put out and swish swish is just horrible. The beat saves this but like the lyrics are horrible.

**m4ttycool** (5): old coupon expired...

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): Nicki single handedly CARRIES this song but it's not enough

**TragicKingdom1** (5): I used to like this a lot more in appreciation of the production, but I realized that I don't really like anything else about the song (including the Nicki verse, I'm just tired of her at this point)

**fifthchevron** (4): Production is good. Yeah.

**Itsafudgingstick** (4): Nicki Minaj's verse is the only truly standout part of this song. NEXT!

**kappyko** (4): Walking on Air was a more tasteful attempt at this type of dance-pop; this just sounds tacky.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): So many parts of thios song are annoying. Nicki was good, but this song was already a lost cause

**vhqv1997** (4): The production is lit but I'm so tired of this dead horse

**camirose** (3): I cannot stand almost any aspect of this song and it would be my 0… if Nicki didn't come on to save the day.

**quaerex** (3): Katy had the narrative on her side, especially since Taylor had been revealed as a snake in the press. I must admit, as a fan of both of them, I was living for the Katy Perry response diss track since Bad Blood was so mediocre. Katy managed to completely not deliver. It was impressive. The only reason I didn't rate this lower is because Nicki Minaj went off on it, and Katy did well to call her in.

**thetimidmartian** (3): not at all a fan of these lyrics, they don't mesh well at all and it smells like moldy beef

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): https://i.redd.it/wvbrk4egxzf01.jpg you have been warned, even if it wasnt about taylor i would still call this a messy mess, nicki lowkey tries to save it but fails, this is a perfect example of missing the mark, could have been a banger. sad.

**Elitefourbrad** (1): A petty diss track 2 years late and a tired verse from Sicki Minjaj.

**itsboogiepanda** (1): This deep house beat was expired in 2015, why is the focal point of the song.

**MrSwearword** (1): wasted a great beat/sample, acted as a Taylor Swift diss track and for some reason had Nicki goddamn Minaj on it to make sure this track sucked. Then the lyric video with Gretchen came out and the actual even worse video with Christine Sydelko and Katy reenacting the Shooting Stars meme OH MY GOD KILL THIS ALL WITH FIRE

**acedino** (0): Another one in the casket

**MaydayPVZ** (0): This is a zero even without the music video

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (8.3): Gonna try not to talk much about the video since its kind of the downfall of this song and why it didn't perform well. We all know the context of this song, Swish Swish is a rebuttal to Taylor Swift's “Bad Blood”, made obvious by how similar Swift and Swish sound. Lyrically we get some really good lines (“You're a joker....courtside killer queen.”), which is especially good because of how Katy flips the court in “Court Joker” over to “Courtside Killer Queen”, making another reference to basketball, a theme present in the video and in the song title. Unfourtunately, we also get some bad lines (obligatory “old coupon expired”). A short tangent, but the reason why the song didn't do well is because the video was super silly and played completely with the 1 basketball line in the song “swish swish bish. Another one in the basket” instead of going more towards a serious direction. SS should have given off similar vibes to Bad Blood, but since the video didnt take itself seriously, unlike the song, it resulted in no one taking Katy Perry as a whole seriously. Had Katy gone in with a joke song and a joke video (see This Is How We Do & California Gurls), it could have been a bit more successful. I'm not gonna say much about Nicki's rap cause although it sounds good, lyrically its kinda boring.

**gannade** (7.5): catchy

**sletrab07** (7.5): Nasty-ass, cringy lyrics bolstered by some bouncy production. I could do without the 3 aMigos though.

---

x6 0s, x2 11s, I really thought popheads really hated this song? Surrounded by controversy, terrible performances, and around the same time as her hair cut, Katy was highkey losing control of the era around this song. 

I like the production sometimes, but for the most part I personally found this song to be a bit of a train wreck :shrug:

---

**5 Star Michelin**
---
**SkyBlade79** (11): The most underrated KP song by popheads? Top notch production, amazing wordplay, great vibe, MIGOS… just wow. The instrumental is so great. Does it deserve an 11? Not quite, but it's one of the most fun songs from last year and deserves some praise.

**Albert\_Cole** (10): I unironically love every beat of this song

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is going to go out WAAAAAAY earlier than the top 5 placement it deserves, but i'm already accepting that. an amazing and exciting BOP with the best music video in the rate & katy's career.

**cyborglilith** (10): slut drop anthem

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Who knew a music video would improve my reception towards the song competely? And to my crush daddies out there, hi. ;)

**dropthehammer11** (10): I fucking adore this song, would be my 11 if Praying wasn't here. AMAZING production, seriously the best pop production I've heard in a long time.

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (10): I GRAB HER LEGS AND NOW DIVIDE, AIGHT

**izeasklapaucius** (10): eat it up Eat It Up EAT IT UP

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the slutty miranda in me was awakened thanks to this track

**Mudkip1** (10): the latter half of this song is so fucking good this one really grew on me. i still think it'd be better with less migos thooooo

**rickikardashian** (10): The last chorus cooked and ate my wig. Woot for cannibalism

**robbiec\_** (10): FUN OKAY

**SpanKKy1** (10): I eat ass to this song

**strawberryswing1** (10): this production is ear candy and migos make so many bops

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Came so close to giving this my 11. I will never not dance to this bop, and while it might be a hot take on this sub I love the Migos feature. They sound weirdly great on this instrumental.

**zamomattel** (10): problematic faves face off

**ulikejazz** (9.6): Easily a 10 without Migos

**fourchip** (9.5): i was listening to this while playing overwatch and some straightie ingame said he could hear my music so i apologized and he said, and i quote "it's okay, katy's the GOAT anyways" and i blocked him

**Glennishill** (9.5): What a sexy banger. I love how subtle it is and how not subtle it is at the same time. Katy is really sultry with her vocals, which I love. Fuck Migos but I really like Offset's verse here.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Ah, yes. The curse of the second single. It was sad to see this get the "Kiss It Better" treatment, but at least it peaked higher. And the video was memorable. Speaking of which, I hope this ranks higher than in the Videography. The Migos verse isn't all that necessary, though, which is why it won't get my 10.

**1313Harbor** (9): I can't support Migos but I unironically love this song.

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (9): OFFSET !

**dirdbub** (9): an immovable object meets an unstoppable force

**kappyko** (9): https://web.archive.org/web/20170703062424/https://atrl.net/forums/topic/51860-i-ate-my-mom-out-in-a-dream-why/

**MissyBee37** (9): Dammit, Migos. I blame you for this bop's demise!

**stardustanddinos** (9): I HATED this song initially, but this is my favourite slut-bop of this year. The instrumental is PHENOMENAL, only Migos keeps this track from being great. Could've had Cupcakke instead, just saying.

**vhqv1997** (9): Culinary queen, Gordon Ramsay who?

**PenOrAPencil** (8.8): this song is actually a banger and deserves more love on this sub! The production is top notch.

**MashLuke** (8.5): I want Katy to eat me

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Favorite single and favorite song from the album

**swadadu** (8.4): The most impressive thing about this song to me is how Migos don't sound out of place.

**kromosol** (8.3): Bon Apple Tit Babé

**angusaditus** (8): queen of healthy apetite http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/katy-perry-500x788.jpg

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): The verses have the same hush whispering really fast vibe as some of the Taylor Swift tracks, but here it actually builds into lushly instrumented choruses. Unfortunately, the food puns are awkward, and what is migos doing here.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Two stellar pussy popping verses from Katy and Migos is there too :)

**enecks** (8): I have no shame. Fuck Migos. Fuck Katy Perry for featuring them. But this song is a thot jam.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (8): Somehow manages to straddle the line between unbothered coolness and actual lust. That being said, it's on the long side and I loathe Migos (in general, but also here).

**followingfreeways** (8): I seriously hate myself for bopping to this so hard and after this rate im gonna pretend this never happened

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The production on this song is amazing, however the controversy (Fake woke Katy, Migos, the music video) around this song kind of has ruined my opinion on it.

**joshually** (8): "spread like a buffet" WHY WHEN I AM ON A DIET :(

**natsby** (8): I solidly like this and don't understand why popheads doesn't

**nooodisaster** (8): i don't vibe with migos.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): this is a B O P

**SupremeShani** (8): This song's production is so efficient and smooth, and I live for all the food and dining metaphors Katy uses even if they're so heavy handed.

**tevinterimperium** (8): I really didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Honestly, this song has a trash Quavo verse, an outdated beat, and a chorus that fades in with the verses, but by god it is a catchy track that is just so ridiculous it's damn fun. It's like the song equivalent of No Man's Sky, absolute trash but fun in small bursts.

**whatareblackhole** (8): Problematic fave!

---

**awryj** (7.8): This song is veeery early-mid 90s Bjork to me (excluding the rap and awkward food metaphors), which is probably the weirdest association you could possibly have when it comes to Katy Perry songs


**theNealCutter** (7.5): B O P but the lyrics are super disgusting. honestly, it should've just featured Cupcakke instead of Migos. The only thing that saves this song is the beat. AND GODDAMN IS IT A GREAT BEAT.

**crowlily** (7.1): buffet eww. boppy beat! it's not a terrible song but I'm making a '_' face.

**MyselfAndAlpha** (7): every time I listen to this I think of the music video

**vayyiqra** (7): ho bop

**VeganSquash** (7): dairy is scary

**jhxcb** (6.9): It's fun, a little catchy. The verses are a lot less exciting than the chorus.

**deadspiderwall** (6.5): I lowkey like this song

**Itsafudgingstick** (6.5): Putting aside that this song is already kinda basic, Migo's verses are not only short, they're pretty corny, waste of a feature and waste of a song.

**queensparade** (6.5): I wish Migos wasn't featured on this

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): This song actually has pretty good components (the production, the final chorus, and Migos) but it just takes SO long to get to those parts. The lack of momentum at the 2nd chorus going into the 2nd verse should be criminal.

**camirose** (6): Not my cup of tea but it's not objectively bad or boring.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Migos dropped the score on this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Not as terrible as everybody's initial reaction to it, but the increasing tempo of the track isn't well executed enough, and Migos's feature is only decent as well. I am sort of happy that the video is kind of growing on people, though.

**skargardin** (6): It never really takes off until the second chorus but when it does, it becomes one hell of a banger. But that's already a bit too late. Migos doesn't really fit in this song for me. It's all about her taking charge, her "sexual liberation" as she's said it, and then she's got the audacity to throw Migos in there?

** https://imgur.com/a/atqm2**

**leviswift13** (5.9): There is nothing I enjoy about this song. Not even the production.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): The song itself is not very good, but the music video made it so much worse

**itsboogiepanda** (5): Good concept poor execution

**OriginalKappa** (5): i guess it was too woke for me :/

**specfagular** (5): I liked her when she came out but not much anymore. Also the solo version is better. Not by a lot but Migos does bring this song down for me

**TheLastAxolotl** (5): I actually went back and played Witness

**quaerex** (4.5): Queen of lacking subtlety does it again. Tell her to hook up with Ariana Grande and the Weeknd.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): no, just no

**ImADudeDuh** (4): girl wtf lol

**agentofscranton** (3): the 'go ahead' before the second chorus is the best part of an otherwise lackluster song

**ClocktowerMaria** (3): fucking terrible oh my god, nasty ass lyrics, awful disgusting video, pointless migos feature where each member spends 10 seconds on the track. Obnoxious ass production. Just ugh ugh ugh ugh

**jonnl2806** (3): I have no idea why this was ever a single

**thetimidmartian** (3): migos isnt good now and certainly wasnt good them. rip katy's hair, bon appetit baybay

**fifthchevron** (2): The production hits the spot but ehhhhh no thanks. I dig the pre-chorus and I love songs where the chorus slams into the second verse like it does here. It could've worked with non-cringey "wine mom trying to be sexual again after 18 years of raising kids" lyrics. Migos play off the production with such ease, in a way I feel like Katy has struggled to through the whole album.

**camerinian** (1.5): IT'S FUCKING RAW

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): i refuse to listen to this again, migos are cancelled also btw this is the best twitter thread of all time, in this house we now stan MNEK even though he did that song with that rat: https://twitter.com/MNEK/status/953898189811322880 VERSACE DID NOT DIE FOR THIS ALSO WATCH AMERICAN CRIME STORY: THE ASSASSINATION OF GIANNY VERSACE MY GIRL PENELOPE IS DOING THAT. lowkey want "cardi get your fiancée tattooed on my ass

**dwarfgourami** (1): fuck homophobia (also the song is bad)

**m4ttycool** (1): I hate almost everything of this

**MrSwearword** (1): you know that "Bella Thorne is serving/We gon' starve" tweet? Imagine that with a backing track and Migos and you get this horseshit.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (0): god i cant stand this song, if its not out first day im suing

**CarlieScion** (0): This song is everything that is wrong with Katy Perry and pop-music. From the lazy-ass beat to the """""cheeky""""" food/sex-puns that we're all supposed to be in on that falls so fucking flat to the lazy Migos feature and the chorus that builds to fucking nothing. I hate this song so much.

**theburningundead** (0): my favourite part of this song is when it ends

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (10): There is a lot to be said about this song. The production is awesome, such a mood. The lyrics are okay but honestly if you take this song out of the context of Witness Era, then it doesn't even seem that bad. The double chorus into the rap verse is awesome. Speaking of the rap verse, I actually feel like it adds something to the song. The “aah-a-aah” in the background of the 2nd and last chorus is nice too.

I get the point of the song, and it's cute, but the song just feels a bit lost in the rest of the album and just feels like an un-needed change of pace in an already questionably paced album. 

Also, I'm surprised this made it this far without any 11s, and x7 1s. Kesha is really cleaning up here! But, will it last?

--- 

**I'm a Mother Fuckin MONSTER**
--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): such an adorable bop, and i love the history behind it

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): cutest song on the album. i want to have a boyfriend like godzilla, though, he wouldnt live long if he ate half my fries.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): this is amazing so pure inject me i want this in my grave wig skinny legend

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): When I first heard this song, I legit screamed. Like holy fuck, what is this song? I really apperciate how genuine Kesha is even though the subject matter is so meme-y. Like oh my god, this is so funny. I am giving this a 10. I STAN!

**fourchip** (10): my favourite thing about this song is the fact that i can occasionally hear the smile in kesha's voice

**ImADudeDuh** (10): You know, it's really weird to have this song on the album, but you know what? Its cute, its funny and its adorable as FUCK. It's a song about being in love with Godzilla, how can you not love that? This is probably gonna be a day 1 song, but dammit if I don't love every second of this song.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): This song is one of a kind. Kesha's delivery is so funny.

**joshually** (10): THIS SONG IS MISUNDERSTOOD. IT'S A METAPHOR FOR LIFE Y'ALL. GET INTO IT THEN GET WHAT YOU CAN OUT OF IT

**leviswift13** (10): Without a doubt my favorite Kesha song. It has everything you want Kesha for: humor, weirdness, originality and overflowing heart.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a song about literally falling in love with Godzilla? Iconic.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is so fucking cute

**Raykel** (10): This is such a cute little bop about dating Godzilla aka a careless man. Why it gets so much slander I'll never understand.

**SpanKKy1** (10): also the name of my penis

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): mega cute bop

**theNealCutter** (10): best part about this honestly is the writing. Like srsly, I wish I can write lyrics as vivid and as good as these. But girl, people tell you to stay away from bad people like Godzilla for a reason. Maybe he's really good as you say, but if things go wrong, you can't say people haven't warned you.

**zamomattel** (10): i cri

**kappyko** (9.5): omg this is cute why is every song people hate from this album good

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This is such a whimsical and adorable song, it just makes me smile.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): i'm too sober for these lyrics

**enecks** (9): This song is very cute. I'm not meaning that in a sarcastic stan twitter way - this song is legitimately adorable.

**melodyllic\_** (9): help im drowning in a pool of fluffy stuffed animals this is too cute and wacky and adorable

**milkywayinradius** (9): someone who loves me please sing me this song during my nap time

**MyselfAndAlpha** (9): cute lyrics

**natsby** (9): based on this, I would be so down for a folky alternative Kesha album, or just a downright weird one ala Respektor

**robbiec\_** (9): this is adorable and dorky and better for it

**skargardin** (9): It's so adorable, cute and quirky.

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): It's campy, it's cute, reminds me of Taylor Swift's Ours

**whatareblackhole** (9): Does this song make anyone else sad???

**jhxcb** (8.8): It's super fun and super Kesha while also being sweet. Also, I love having an actual nice sounding pop song from a big artist that isn't in 4/4 time. I think it seems a little too short, and I don't know why.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): This was actually written by Kesha's mom Pebe, and I am now fully convinced that Godzilla is Kesha's real father.

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I can't help but think of Daria Morgendorffer's cat when I listen to this😆

**awryj** (8): sounds very regina spektor-esque

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Great folk song

**cyborglilith** (8): sounds like it would fit perfectly into a dumb self-released romance short

**dropthehammer11** (8): This song is so cute man makes me blush

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song is super weird and cute and I kinda love it?

**nooodisaster** (8): The only original song on this album that Kesha did not help write. I guess her mom just wrote a song for her lmao? Wholesome queen.

**quaerex** (8): Wow, I kind of love this. It's so quirky and unique. It's adorable.

**rickikardashian** (8): woot for necrophilia i think

**thetimidmartian** (8): surprisingly delicately penned. kesha gives it a very mature vocal treatment.

**specfagular** (7.5): this is so cute

**stardustanddinos** (7.5): This is a weird ass song hahaha, but she makes it sound so moving. It's about falling in love with someone you shouldn't. Godzilla is well, one way to put it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): A cute little song, but I think Kesha's weary delivery present through the whole album gives it a subtle bit of depth.

**acedino** (7): Weird and cute

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): It sounds a bit underdeveloped, but it has enough quirks to be fun

**Elitefourbrad** (7): A mess, yet fun and youthful. I feel like this is a song people sing around the campfire.

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): I actually really love this song. It gives me the whimsy of pre-Rainbow Kesha combined with her new musical style. It's silly but still super cute to listen to.

**m4ttycool** (7): adorable

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I find it cute whenever Kesha inserts weird subject material into her songs, and this one is actually really funny despite how slow it is. The line where Kesha's mom calls the police after she introduces Godzilla to her always cracks me up.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): Cute but basic and somewhat tacky. I don't really get why it was included but it's not offensive in any way.

**vayyiqra** (7): totally bizarre

**vhqv1997** (7): Sorry Kesha, I'm just not into beastiality

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): i get what she's going for, but it doesn't do it for me

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Love song for the ages

**MashLuke** (6.5): this reminds me of that Blink 182's song about blowjobs. It's funny but I can't take it seriously lol

**camerinian** (6): Remember that 2014 Godzilla movie? Weren't they gonna make a sequel to that? What happened there?

**jonnl2806** (6): "What do you get when you meet Godzilla and fall in love?" You run girl, you run

**CarlieScion** (5): I just can't understand this Godzilla-metaphor. What is this song. Can someone please explain how this is a song.

**MissyBee37** (5): Pleasant but feels like it was written for little kids. I imagine an inflatable Godzilla knocking stuff over with its tail lol.

**SkyBlade79** (4): what do you get when you give a mouse a muffin

**topesmachine** (3): low point of the album, it's a little too cutesy, doesn't really go with the tone or the sound of this album as a whole, I don't know why it's in Rainbow tbh, and the song itself is nothing to sneeze at

**itsboogiepanda** (2): Popheads shit on darling Ed for singing about a thrifty date at a buffet, this song sings about eating fries at a food court. At least Shape of You had a catchy tune and a great personality behind it, what does Godzilla have?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (2): This is literally the most infuriating track I've ever rated and honestly if it didn't have a twinkly guitar and some "indie cred" it wouldn't nearly be as revered as it is. The lyrics are just laughably bad, it's decidedly unmoving. It just makes me so annoyed and I can't at how pretentious this is, and while a lot of the album is pretentious (cue the next track), at least it's doing something interesting. Godzilla is boring as shit and the metaphor here is just so devoid of subtlety, and while a lot of people find this cute I find this infinitely grating.

**dirdbub** (1): please don't take me back to my "lol xD" days, please please please please please

**gannade** (1): honestly I swear she already made this song earlier in the album but with different lyrics. it was mediocre then and its mediocre now

**Glennishill** (1): Boooo! I'm tempted to give this song a 0 because I love Godzilla so much but my zero is destined for an even shittier song in this rate.

**MrSwearword** (1): essentially, the If You Give a Mouse a Cookie of songs

u/ThatParanoidPenguin How is Rainbow pretentious? How is Godzilla specifically pretentious?
[/r/popheads/comments/86ucbt/the_2017_ultimate_album_rate_day_2_wig_did_you/dw81del/]

=====

ThatParanoidPenguin: The song is so obviously about a relationship and the fact that she so bluntly drops the line at the end like it's some kinda revelation is just really annoying. The lyrics aren't deep whatsoever and the metaphor just personally bothers me because it's heralded as powerful just because it's a watered down version of indie songs we've heard before. I don't like the delivery and I think the lyrics are as dense as a puddle.

Rainbow I find less infuriating, but it seems to be a track that everyone finds enlightening that just frankly isn't all that special. It's clichéd, moreso than Godzilla, and there's no single line to me that stands out as anything more than a motivational poster. The delivery on the final choruses is nice and I get that it's coming from a place of finding yourself but the result is just nowhere as ethereal as everyone thinks it is.

I am having a hard time finding a nice blurb to say about this song, I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it, and honestly I think that's where a lot of you guys stand on it too. It just wasn't memorable, sorry? 

I mean, like most of the album it is pretty, but it just wasn't a stand out track by any means. 

---

**These People Got It**
--- 

**1313Harbor** (10): This song is so massively underrated and will probably flop in this rate. The instrumentation is simple yet powerful. And I just love the idea that forever isn't real, we only have a finite time together, but maybe it's inevitable that soulmates will find each other in another life because their connection is so strong. It always reminds me of Past Lives by BØRNS, another bop.

**acedino** (10): Underrated gem

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): fucking hell how i wish i could feel love like this. this song is such a beautiful one, really fits the sequence of Praying-LTLG-this-Rainbow. i love how the album effortlessly changes from fun to serious to fun again back to serious and haunting in the end. Kesha is almost as great as Lorde in controlling the flow of her work. i really hope i will be able to see her live once in my life, i need to hear this and many other of her songs live.

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (10): That emotional but bitter-sweetly optimistic chorus tho

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm surprised she can sell earnest love as well as she does.

**TheLastAxolotl** (10): A spiritual successor to Past Lives and I freaking love it

**zamomattel** (9.5): absolutely beautiful beyond words

**MashLuke** (9): this is fucking adorable I can't

**robbiec\_** (9): With Supernatural I think she sold this concept of like interdimensional love well but this song takes the electronics away and makes it more human spirited rather than aliens and I love it

**TragicKingdom1** (9): This is pretty adult contemporary but the melody is very strong.

**vhqv1997** (9): Whenever I listen to this song, I like to imagine running through an endless crowd of people and then finding my soulmate at the end

**whatareblackhole** (9): OKAY, I love this song, and I think everyone else should, too! I know the vocals are weird, but they're fun!

**kappyko** (8.5): Fleet Foxes are shaking in their boots, Grizzly Bear are choking on their organic water

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): overlooked bop. for some reason i love that little guitar strumming at the beginning

**Mudkip1** (8.5): the strings at the beginning are pretty

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The acoustic guitar on the verses is really nice. The chorus and bridge complement it well.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I really love the production on this one. Obviously not gonna overlook Kesha, who brings out some really interesting stuff melodically throughout.

**therokinrolla** (8.5): very underrated. I've seen people call it filler, but somehow i feel "Finding You" wouldnt quite fit on any album but rainbow, as kesha's powerful vocals and folksy/country/poppy sound excels here, plus of course the epic hook.

**VeganSquash** (8.5): hmm, I wish it had a different bridge instead of a repeated chorus. Oh well still great

**jhxcb** (8.4): She essentially already wrote this song (Past Lives), but I will say this one is better.

**camerinian** (8): Dang the production on this is just pristine, everything sounds amazing, I live for those drum fills

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Really nice classic style folk from Kesha

**enecks** (8): A song that's more thematically ambitious than the surface level appears - a love that transcends individual forms through romantic incarnations with a chorus punchy enough to sell it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is in no way the weakest track on Rainbow. It's a nice segue in between the two halves of the album along with Rainbow and it's cute enough to merit at least a six. The melody of the first half of the chorus bumps this up a lot for me, anyway.

**SupremeShani** (8): I hope I find Kesha in the next life.

**theNealCutter** (8): I love how this song is not really chasing a specific person, much more of the concept of "The One" instead. But production wise, it feels like it's gonna explode to something big, but it really doesn't and it's kinda disappointing.

**thetimidmartian** (8): the verses are ok but the choruses are excellent, her chest-falsetto flips are to die for

**crowlily** (7.5): The verse sounds different and kinda cool! Chorus is great! I love the "I know forever don't exist" line! Low notes! I like the idea of the song a lot

**It's 'Aight'**
---

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): The bass that comes into the song about 30s elevates this from a simple and cute song to an amazing love song.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.3): Cute but generic. She didn't even play this on the tour - and I don't blame her.

**CarlieScion** (7): I love the acoustic feel of this song in the verses. Kesha sounds good stripped back

**cyborglilith** (7): Theme song of Cars 5

**deadspiderwall** (7): love me some guitar strings

**jonnl2806** (7): Good but forgettable

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I'm not really a fan of the instrumental, but Kesha sounds great here.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Does anyone remember this track? I've literally never heard anyone talk about this in my life. I do quite like this chorus though.

**topesmachine** (7): the verses are good but the chorus could be better tbh

**twat\_brained** (7): Cute but not too memorable compared to everything else on the album. Maybe "Old Flames"

**vayyiqra** (7): nice

**PenOrAPencil** (6.5): it's a nice song but according to some of y'all in this sub it deserves the single treatment, which I don't get.

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): Feels like it could have a lot more potential but it's missing the payoff to the chorus.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): My least fave on Rainbow :/ It's kust pretty plain to me


**More Filling Than a Boston Crème Donut**
---

**fourchip** (7.5): this felt like it got a little bit lost in the album? borderline filler and i always forget it exists, but it's very nice to listen to

**skargardin** (7.5): It's a cute love song but it feels a bit like filler to me.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.7): kinda filler

**leviswift13** (6.5): There was no need for this song to exist, but I can appreciate what it is trying to do.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): ɹ Ǝ ˥ ˥ I Ⅎ

**Elitefourbrad** (5): This is boring album filler, yawn, next track.


**I Guess This Sounds Like Another Song That I've Never Heard Before**
---

**MissyBee37** (6.2): I know people have noted how this song ties into "Past Lives," one of my top Kesha faves, but that means it's hard not to compare them & feel this one falls short.

**Glennishill** (6): This song is fine. It's too country for me but I dig it otherwise. It's like a less good version of Past Lives.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): "Past Lives" outsold.


**Just Finding A Way to Unlisten to a Song**
---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): sigh the least best song on the record. just forgettable

**dirdbub** (5): I left my house to eat while doing this rate and completely cannot remember what this sounds like but I remember it being decent so a 5 it is

**quaerex** (4.5): I don't really like the vocal stuff she does on the verses, it just feels like it doesn't quite fit the instrumental.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): wat

**natsby** (4): so forgettable

**gannade** (3): the bridge legit sounds like wolf howling. "aahhhh-woooooooooooo"

**joshually** (3): This is probably one of the weakest album tracks on the album.

I totally get the Hozier/Bishop Briggs comparisons, but damn they just make me like the song more. 

It's a Taylor song so we see the bigger controversy score, and somehow, x3 11s, and a 0! We love a controversial (and to some) rip-off queen! 

---

**DON'T BLAME ME LOVE MADE ME CRAZY IF IT DOESN'T YOU AIN'T DOING IT RIIIIGHHHHTTTT**
---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): my only other contender for an 11. that last chorus is powerful af and the entire song just bumps

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): case of "why is this not a single yet " 2.0. everything about this song is just amazing. the flow, the lyrics, the sexiness of it, the orgasmic bridge and final chorus, her belting, etc. also if anyone thinks it sounds like take me to church its because both are inspired by gospel ffs its like saying Flo Rida copied Avicii with Good Feelings NO BITCH THEY JUST BOTH COME FROM THE SAME PLACE THE TONE OF THE SONGS ARENT EVEN SIMILAR JFC


**followingfreeways** (10): the way she says "I'd beg you on my knees to stay" is honestly just the best thing I've ever heard

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a bop

**SkyBlade79** (10): best song on the album by far, even though it's just Bishop Briggs lite. Great, mature lyricism and production. It'd be okay if this win.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Idk why this song gets slept on I love it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): megabop

**TheStarSquad** (10): So I went into DBM coming off the extreme high of IDSB, and the initial chorus and verse didn't blow me away immediately, it was a break I definitely needed. But when that second verse kicked in, all hell broke loose. At first listen I LOVED Don't Blame Me, I was going insane, I actually was choking. This was the best possible way to follow up IDSB, the lyrics could be addressing the same themes? It definitely addresses the media and it's perception of her love life but it's also definitely directed towards Joe. The chorus is just so good, I cannot believe how quaked I was at first listen. It's just so different to anything Taylor has ever done before, but I love every part about it.

**vayyiqra** (10): amazing


**jhxcb** (9.1): I really like this song a lot. I think she does the style really well, but I also think this song is pretty much stolen from Demi Lovato and Beyoncé, and is super lyrically generic. But I also can't help how much I love it.

**leviswift13** (9.1): Her best vocal performance, don't @ me.

**camirose** (9): 'I once was poison ivy but now I'm your daisy' legally prevents this song from scoring anything less than a 9

**hikkaru** (9): your love your love your love, is my drug (beep beep bloop)

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Insanely catchy and singleworthy IMO

**therokinrolla** (9): "Don't blame me, love made me crazy, if it doesn't you ain't doing it right". Damn.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): I was actually talking to one of my friends about how the chorus is kind of similar to Crazy in Love. Overall it's a good song with a nice buildup to the chorus and unlike other songs here it doesn't let me down once it reaches said chorus.

**MashLuke** (8.5): imagine if Selena Gomez compared a drug addiction to being in love

**stardustanddinos** (8.5): The chorus and the instrumentals are bombastic. This song is a great ballad, and is one of the best on the album for me. Well fucking done.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.4): Your love your love your love is my drug

**cyborglilith** (8): I love edgy Taylor.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Slightly overrated but it's still a song. It definitely gave me "Take Me to Church" vibes.

**fifthchevron** (8): I love the moodiness and the soft, bemused contemplations of how deeply a person can fall in love. This is the one sound I did NOT expect to hear so I like it for being the Taylor Swift version of "experimental". Points off for again admitting to using people.

**melodyllic\_** (8): another day, another love/drug analogy

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): It's weird. This is not a song I look super forward to listening to when I put on Reputation, but by the time it's half-over I'm bopping to it. I love the gospel direction and this has Taylor's best vocals on the album. One thing I hate: the way she pronounces 'Daisy'. It's hard to give this an actual score, but I'll go for a 8.

**specfagular** (8): This was so unexpected from her but I reeeeeally like it

**SupremeShani** (8): I both love and hate this song, her vocals surprisingly sound gorgeous and haunting when paired up with that synthetic, gospel instrumental, but that metaphor in the chorus is awful.

**theNealCutter** (8): Bishop Briggs did gospel-pop better. Just listen to Dead Man's Arms. I love the production though. It amazingly melds synthetic synths with gospel inspirations, making it sound dark and gloomy while still making it fit the album's overall sound. Although the "Your love is my drug" metaphor is very cliched.

**Take Me To Church 2, Electric Curchaloo**
--- 

**poppinmmolly** (11): I. fucking. love. this. song. Every time I listen to it I get lost in it. I am engulfed by the production and the gang vocals. It reminds me of a Hozier song but with more production. I just love it so much and I don't see it talked about enough.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): WHOzier? this is a MAJOR BANGER and such an incredible rush to drive to (even moreso than Overrated Car)

**vhqv1997** (10): What Hozier song is this?

**quaerex** (5): The heavy "Take Me to Church" influence plus the concept that Kesha executed better years ago makes this song a boring, washed-up repeat that is entirely unnecessary.

**enecks** (7): One of the most transparently unoriginal songs - an amalgam of Flume, Hozier, and drug as a love. But at least this song's big chorus actually has synths big enough to carry it - @Ready For It where is your explanation

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Reminder that Hozier is coming back this year, y'all better support!

**zamomattel** (7): something something take me to church

**CarlieScion** (7): The chorus is catchy and gives me Hozier-vibes

**DraculaWeekend** (5): No thanks on this Hozier ripoff.


**whatareblackhole** (5): I strained my eyes from rolling them so hard at the Hozier comparisons. C'mon, ladies.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): Seems like she wanted to make her own version of Take me to Church, but her vocals are not Hozier level. And the production doesn't really match.


**MissyBee37** (4.8): Take Me To Church 2.0

---

**crowlily** (7.5): I think it's cool she tried to attempt this but it's grown out of me sadly. dunno why she had to attempt this, doesn't really suit her and I'm not a huge fan. great vocals though!

**fourchip** (7.5): feels a little like filler and a little too cookie cutter/generic to me but who cares because i immediately popped 5 tabs of acid when she said "my drug is my baby"

**Piccprincess** (7.5): Dont blame me when I make Calvin Harris comments all over this album

**skargardin** (7.5): It's not all that substantial in either lyrics or production but her screech as the final chorus kicks in is so good.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This honestly sounds like it should be on the Fifty Shades soundtrack.

**topesmachine** (7.5): good song but something about the tempo's off to me... it's too sluggish

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): meh, even taylor's worst songs are amazing


**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): This sounds like Believer by Imagine Dragons.


**ignitethephoenix** (7): It's fine but nothing special.

**jonnl2806** (7): I want to see her sing this live and miss all of the high notes.


**twat\_brained** (7): What's that I hear? The comparison loving someone to drug use? Where have I heard that before? Surely not from someone else in this rate, right? Also, why is Taylor reviving dubstep? I thought we were leaving that in 2014 or whatever: janet: :janet: :janet:


**deadspiderwall** (6.9): high note!

**Glennishill** (6.5): This is a high point on the album for me, which says a lot. She's at least singing. Cliche and forgettable though.

**Raykel** (6.5): This is a better Fifty Shades song than her actual one.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): Decent melody and chorus, production kind of mismatches though even if it's not bad.

**dirdbub** (6): I like the chorus, but the verses are too boring to keep my attention at all

**Elitefourbrad** (6): Lana Del Rey is shaking from this rip off.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (6): "Now I'm your DAAAAAISY" - what? Oh well. That chorus sounds dated but is otherwise pretty strong.

**itsboogiepanda** (6): I don't like how big this sounds, although I imagine this is probably one of those songs that would work quite well live. The lyrics are subpar, 'my drug is my baby' 🤮

**izeasklapaucius** (6): Great lyrics but 2012 called, they want their dubstep wobble back.

**natsby** (6): it just doesn't sound like a taylor song.

**VeganSquash** (6): lyrics are cliché, but its catchy

**nooodisaster** (5.5): a poorly written song about love being a drug, kesha can't relate.


**This Song Made Me Crazy**
---

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): eh pretty boring


**dwarfgourami** (5): I'm really tired of the love=drug trope in pop music, it's just so unoriginal


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This is literally "Once Upon A Time commercial music" tier


**robbiec\_** (4.8): I don't have a comment for this song but I need to shove in somewhere that I like the cover art oh wait no I mean to say that drug lines in pop music are almost always cringey and this also reminds me of a Fifty Shades soundtrack song

**camerinian** (4): Diet Flume Me

**dropthehammer11** (4): This song just sounds very dated. It's not completely terrible, it has some energy to it, but I find the production to take away a lot. Mediocre overall.

**MrSwearword** (4): it's like she's trying her hand at a Lana Del Rey impersonation but doesn't have the sharp songwriting, lush production or character commitment to pull it off. At least it's not the worst offering.

**thetimidmartian** (4): oh wow she goes pretty low on those verses, i would be okay with this song if it werent for the dated production and that screaming toward the end


**Brendon-Urine** (2): i fell asleep during this ngl

**ImADudeDuh** (2): I feel like this song deserves a lot more shit for it's bad lyrics. It sounds like if taylor tried to write something for Badlands.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): wow this song really sucks

**joshually** (1): This song just sounds sorta lazy tbh

**kappyko** (1): soul from a person who should never attempt soul again

**Mudkip1** (1): all of it sounds so dated already. this album came out like four months ago!!! this isn't 2012 anymore taylor

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (0): jesus christ i don't even know what to say, this song is just bad

My comment is best reflected by this comment: 

**nooodisaster** (6): We been knew the only reason deluxe songs were even included in this rate was because for some reason Katy-stans think this is the next RAWM. And yet when I actually listened to it, all I got was Prism C-side (aka Teenage Dream D-side).

Act My Age is one of the more controversial Katy songs, with 23 10s, and a surprising 0, Act My Age had a stunted growth pattern, and sputtered out in the mid 20s and stalled.

**acedino** (10): Wish this would've made the album but I can see how it wouldn't really work.

**agentofscranton** (10): i honestly will never understand why this wasn't part of the standard track list?

**angusaditus** (10): I, also, love to act a fool https://i.imgur.com/47gCCgX.gif

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Now this is prime Katy. Why is this not on the standard album?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): YASSSS DRAG THEM HATERS KATY. This is definitely one of the most genuine, fun songs on the album. I am glad it's included in the album as a bonus track.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wtf why isnt this on the main album

**m4ttycool** (10): gooooooood

**MashLuke** (10): This is literally the best song in this album and it's not even in the normal version

**milkywayinradius** (10): watta fun, body-swaying bop this song is my youth, if I had any

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Bitch I am bopping! This could havw easily fit in between "Roulette" and "Swish Swish" in the standard edition, and this is definitely the pop musical direction Katy should have taken. Also does anyone else hear "Into You" in the glass-clanking parts?

**Mudkip1** (10): a bop

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): not a good song sounding like it would fit on teenage dream being a bonus track

**skargardin** (10): I love this rebellious anthem! It's kinda like a mix between the PRISM and the Witness sound, I really love it. This should, in all honesty, have been on the standard edition.

**specfagular** (10): WHY ISN'T THIS ON THE ALBUM AND MIND MAZE IS? KATY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING THIS IS SO GOOD WHY DO YOU HATE YOUR OWN ALBUM? AT LEAST PUT HER ON APPLE MUSIC

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Legitimately the best song on the album, and it wasn't on the album. This literally is such a bop it's insane, it's vintage Katy in the best way, and I wish it saw the light of day so I could be a drunk idiot and dance to this.

**twat\_brained** (10): Katy snapped and just knifed her critics through the heart. One Direction outsold though :mariah:

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): we been knew

**cyborglilith** (9.5): A

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Love the funky guitar & the melody. Great bridge. The lyrics are playful but also actually pretty insightful if you take them seriously. The pre-chorus message is the best answer to any Katy doubters. Preach, sis!

**jhxcb** (9.4): This song softly bops. It's not a full-on bop, but it doesn't need to be.

**1313Harbor** (9): BOP

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (9): Okay, WTF Katy. Why are the two best songs you've made in years bonus tracks? You truly pulled a Taylor, you released the worst songs as singles, and left the best ones as bonus tracks.

**dirdbub** (9): this slaps so fucking hard

**Elitefourbrad** (9): THIS DESERVES SO MUCH BETTER OMG

**joshually** (9): lol that first line is literally me… 30something goin on 13….. BUT OK ANOTHER GREAT SONG RELEGATED TO HIDDEN BONUS WHY

**MyselfAndAlpha** (9): this is so good why isn't this on the album

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): A certified bop™

**vhqv1997** (9): Should have been on the standard album. A perfect blend of the Prism sound and the woke theme of Witness

**zamomattel** (9): what a BOP, this should have been on the album you fool

**Albert\_Cole** (8.8): Blink-182 is shook (seriously why didn't this make the standard edition, they could have cut Tusnami to make toom)

**awryj** (8.8): Oh look, a song that sounds like a Katy Perry song

**camerinian** (8.5): WHAT THE FUCK WHY WASN'T THIS ON THE MAIN ALBUM THIS IS LIKE VINTAGE, GOOD KATY I'M ACTUALLY MAD THAT I SAT THROUGH THAT SLOG OF AN ALBUM AND THIS WASN'T EVEN ON IT SMFH

**hikkaru** (8.5): who the FUCK are the people that decided this should only be a bonus track?

**itsboogiepanda** (8.5): Katy Perry should've just deleted Witness and made a 80s inspired album with every track more like this one.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): BOP

**leviswift13** (8.3): She is cute!

**callmetidle** (8): What the heck Katy? This is the most woke track on Witness honestly. Should definitely have been on the standard, but definitely should not have been a single

**melodyllic\_** (8): why is the fun song here and not on the album?? katy is truly the queen of horrible song/album choices

**MrSwearword** (8): being nice here by saying this makes perfect sense as a closer. Granted, this shit is a glorified Teenage Dream scrap but I'll take what I can get.

**natsby** (8): this is so catchy WHY IS IT A BONUS TRACK

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): damn sweet production this is good

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Should've been a promo single, would've been a great bridge to connect the older era fans

**theNealCutter** (8): hey it's a bop. I guess her child-like shallow attitude that's been running all career that made Witness bad. Bringing the shallowness back is good move.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the 'who the fuck are they anyway' line. Queen of not caring what we think. But I understand why this didn't make the regular cut cause it doesn't fit with the tone of this album (maybe it's a prism reject?)

**It's Cute, but not Much More**

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): This is actually pretty good, the chorus is fun and bouncy.

**crowlily** (7.5): I like how it sounds! okay I'm liking this song even though the chorus is a bit cringe-y

**SupremeShani** (7.5): Someone pointed out this song sounds like a mix of the old and new Katy and I can't unhear it.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): I like the disco tinges and melody but some of the lyrics are tragic.

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): Good little guitar licks

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Oh never mind, this is pretty decent

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): Its cute. Not necessary for the main album, but it automatically is better than most of the songs that actually did make it on. Feels like a theme that would've worked better for Madonna.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Cute! It sounds like one of the better tracks from Prism, especially due to its optimistic, bubblegum tone. I can see why this became a bonus track-it doesn't really fit in well with the rest of the album. Don't get me wrong, though-it's pretty good.

**quaerex** (7): It's better than a lot of what is on Witness. I kinda love her sass in it. Should've dropped Mind Maze and included this instead.

**vayyiqra** (7): underwhelming

**stardustanddinos** (6.5): This should've been in the main album somehow. The tour interlude which mixes this with Teenage Dream is phenomenal, y'all should check it out.

**kappyko** (6): Why did so many people want this as a single this just makes her sound older than she is lmao. This is something that Madonna would get roasted for releasing.

**tevinterimperium** (6): Sounds like a Teenage Dream reject

**whatareblackhole** (6): Meh. Glad it wasn't filler on the standard.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5.5): the definition of overrated. just another generic song with generic lyrics and generic production living in a generic house with a generic little window and a generic corvette

**strawberryswing1** (5.5): this chorus oh god katy no plz no

**A Group of Twinks is Shook/Did it Better?**
---

**CarlieScion** (5): One direction who?

**fifthchevron** (5): 1d is shook

**queensparade** (3.5): One Direction did it better


**I guess these guys didn't like it**
---

**Glennishill** (5): I'm not a big fan of this song. It's so basic and pretentious. Thankfully it's only a bonus track because I'd probably be skipping it with some regularity.

**robbiec\_** (5): same with Emotional maybe I'll like this after I've ever heard it more

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): yawn


**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): shows promise but doesn't deliver

**gannade** (3): this would be a filler track on Teenage Dream

**SkyBlade79** (3): this is such bad filler lmao

**thetimidmartian** (3): thank god this was just a bonus track because those cliches dont pass muster

**VeganSquash** (1): I want to like this song but I don't its trash

**deadspiderwall** (0): oh god

**Your 5 is why, sis**
---

**camirose** (5): Why wasn't this on the original album!? More of a bop than half the stuff on there.

**[All scores] (https://pastebin.com/KN1Y3ju4)**
 
The opener to the mindset of *Rainbow* brings us into Kesha for the first time in 5 years. I love this song so much because it resonates so much with me. I’ve had to cut out many toxic people in my life and honestly, don’t let them bring you down. Kesha gives us the folky tuned song that is Top 5 of the album in my mind.
---
 
# screw all the haters, let’s just drink and have fun
**kappyko** (11): Really gorgeous opener, solemn, forlorn, fucking nice. The outro makes this one of the few songs to give me goosebumps in this rate, so beautiful and anthemic
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this song is so adorable and such a great intro to her comeback <3 ugh i love kesha
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): an amazing starter for an album. slow, chill, and introduces us to the new kesha. It really shows her versatility after all the party songs she did previously, this stripped down bop makes me want to light a candle and just sway side to side. snatch my wig and burn it wholesomely queen.
 
**joshually** (10): The title of the song and the position on the album would lead one to believe that "Bastards" is going to be a blazing banger... but instead, it's a contemplative, beautifully poignant song about empowerment, and surprisingly gentle in its approach, which clues you in that this album is going to be completely different from what Kesha has given us in the past.
 
**melodyllic\_** (10): kesha saying "all those motherfuckers" is one of my favourite moments on this album.
 
**Mudkip1** (10): such a good album opener. it's calming and fun
 
**specfagular** (9.5): love it love it love it love it love it
 
**jhxcb** (9.4): Really showcases Kesha's voice and a great opener for this album. It shows her personality really well. Knocking off a few points for the kind of empty-room, pseudo-amateur recording that's way overdone.
 
**Brendon-Urine** (9): Kesha's vocals on this song are so raw and amazing.
 
**camirose** (9): Only Kesha could make a lovely, tasteful ballad where "motherfucker" and "bastards" are some of the choice adjectives
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Great intro, perfectly sets up the album and Kesha's amazing voice
 
**deadspiderwall** (9): wow, this is really good! I love all the instruments at the end!
 
**dwarfgourami** (9): Such a great opening song, it was truly beautiful live
 
**enecks** (9): This song is a damn good tone setter - Kesha's attitude throughout this whole album is exemplified in this - a mix of that edgy attitude in the previous albums with a nuanced take on personal identity and the complications of forgiveness. It's an acquired taste as a standalone song - the straightforward guitar led production with deliberately gratuitous swearing is a choice. But when that fucking bridge kicks in it's a moment.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): A real nice, lowkey album intro. It sets up the feel kesha's going for in this album perfectly. By talking about bastards, assholes, & mean girls, it's making this song that is supposed to be pretty deep, still have a nice kesha twist with some casual cursing.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (9): Powerful message. Kinda slow for an album opener but love the transition to full instrumental part. Yes Kesha that was a good one and yes, you shall go again.
 
**milkywayinradius** (9): rhythmically nod your head to this song in agreement, then at the ending you gotta break into a full body sway and arm wave
 
**nooodisaster** (9): For the first three minutes this is a great guitar ballad. Then the breakdown happens after the last chorus and it's just heavenly.
 
**skargardin** (9): This is some real talk right here. Where was this song eight years ago in middle-school when I needed it the most?
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): Nice and simple. I really like the outro.
 
**vhqv1997** (9): A good song but I think this should have been the last song on the album, especially with the final lines
 
**twat\_brained** (8.7): What I love is how earnest this one is, easing listeners into the album.
 
**Albert\_Cole** (8.6): Obvious Hey Jude vibes, but it's not like that's a bad thing. This was one of her closing songs on tour, and it sounds even better live.
 
**fourchip** (8.5): a cute little bop
 
**MashLuke** (8.5): you would expect this to have sweet lyrics but instead you get a bluesy acoustic song with a lot of curse words. Beautiful lol.
 
**poppinmmolly** (8.5): her voice here is incredible!
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Great opener. It's atmospheric, has an epic feel, and the last minute with all the instruments coming in is just fantastic.
 
**acedino** (8): This sort of sound suits her voice perfectly
 
**camerinian** (8): I like the progression of this song, she actually seems worn down by those bastards at the beginning of the track, but by the end she's got this whole backing chorus and symphonic swell that actually sounds like she's risen above it.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): An excellent opener for this album and a great song to drag some shady ass people.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (8): I really like this laid back song to open up the album to the underlying tones, but not with the "in-your-face" rock that shows up in the next track.
 
**leviswift13** (8): A gorgeous, unexpected opener that shows growth and maturity!
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): A Bit too slow for my liking, but it's still a great opener
 
**Raykel** (8): It's stripped back but it's so powerful I forget it is.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Decent album opener that sets up the mood of the album
 
**theNealCutter** (8): this is making me feel things.
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): I like this as an album opener because it allows a good message to open the album and suggests the sound that comes on the latter half.
 
**crowlily** (7.9): This is actually great! I mean I never thought I'd hear a Kesha acoustic song. I thought by the song title that it'd be loud and all like BANG but this is actually my sound. The message is great as well, doesn't sound very cheesy or fake. The chorus reminds me of Taylor's "coz baby I could build a castle of all the bricks they threw at me" coz both songs are about being yourself. Important for me. I really like this. Oh wait the drums kick in but I still really like it!
 
**therokinrolla** (7.8): a very cute song, if a little slow and melancholy for an intro
 
**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): Great opening song
 
**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Yeehaw bitches. A tender, acoustic opener like this was a great way to start Rainbow.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is a sweet song, however it's just a bit generic. Love Kesha doing acoustic!
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): This starts out as a really cute acoustic midtempo that makes the correct decision of building to a big climax. Unfortunately, this climax is flawed in the sense that the new vocal riffs overpower the new instrumentation, preventing it from becoming a true power ballad. I still like this song but there is some wasted potential.
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): a bop that is just fine, could have been bigger and better but is gud
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): A well done if inconsequential little tune, with a pretty weak outro
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7): well meaning but kinda wears thin after about a minute until that changeup near the end. would've worked better as a shorter introlude
 
**fifthchevron** (7): Perfectly nice, but meanders a bit.
 
**itsboogiepanda** (7): This okay for an acoustic song but doesn't hold my attention
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): I'm sorry but I can't help but feel like this track is a filler which is such a shame since it's the first song on this record. It basically exists because "Let 'Em Talk" doesn't feel as a good as a can opener as this. Still giving this a somewhat high score for Kesha writing this all by herself, though.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): It's maybe a little discouraging to start Rainbow with such a slow track, but its simplicity cautiously sets the tone for the rest of the album, and while Kesha's voice doesn't perform any monumental feats here, her delivery is certainly underrated.

deleted: # :yawn: these people have no heart
 
**jonnl2806** (6.5): A solid introduction to the album. It pretty much tells you what this album is gonna be about. Musically and lyrically, other songs on the album do it better.
 
**stardustanddinos** (6.5): What an opener, and how full of heart. The lyrics are kinda clunky, but Kesha's earnest vocals carry the song well.
 
**SupremeShani** (6.5): I tend to hate songs that combine acoustic instrumentals with curse words, but this is a great opener for an album like this.
 
**topesmachine** (6.5): a cute ballad but musically nothing super special, a little too slow and weak for the lyrics
 
**CarlieScion** (6): Feels more like a closing track than an intro, and then takes a 180 into a completely different song. Kinda disjointed?
 
**dirdbub** (6): this song definitely should be stripped back acoustic, but I feel like it's too stripped back acoustic for most of the song
 
**followingfreeways** (6): no offense but this song is so boring :/ I like the message and her voice sounds good but idk what it is I just dislike the song :/
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (6): It's not even about this song being country (I like the melody) and the meaning of it is nice. But the production feels like a live performance rather than a studio performance. If that's what Kesha was going for then power to her but it just sounds kind of off to me.
 
**PenOrAPencil** (6): Love the empowering lyrics on this but not going to lie, I was about to drift off to sleep until the beat came in during the last chorus
 
**strawberryswing1** (6): ugh Kesha please don't hit those notes if it doesn't sound nice please
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is the epitome of "dae acoustics covers of pop music are so meaningful omgggg," nothing really happens in this track, and feels like a rehash of themes Kesha's treaded upon in a less interesting manner. The best part of this song is easily the outro, where you get some nice release but it still feels unfulfilling.
 
**thetimidmartian** (6): the drop at the end is honestly the whole song
 
**quaerex** (5.5): It's a good empowerment song. I feel so bad giving Kesha lower scores but this song is just a little too basic for an opening.
 
**Glennishill** (5): I appreciate the sentiment of this song but Kesha doesn't really have the range to carry this kind of acoustic performance. Gets better around the 3:00 mark.
 
**sedridd** (5): Nice song, but pretty boring apart from lyricism. A nice clap-back against haters
 
**vayyiqra** (5): not here for acoustic guitar
 
**MrSwearword** (4): great and frank lyrics set to a fucking Rachel Platten demo
 
**Piccprincess** (4): is this The Beatles
 
**SkyBlade79** (4): lasts like 10 years and lame lyrics. Nice outro tho
 
**VeganSquash** (4): the outro was the best part ngl
 
**zamomattel** (3.5): this was what i was afraid a kesha country album would sound like tbh
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): i hate this song so much this single track ruins the mood of the entire album

Piccprincess: >The lyrical content of IDSB alludes to either Taylor cheating, leaving Calvin and rebounding immediately with Tom, or just straight up using either men for her personal gain. In the first verse, she talks about Calvin's narcissism and refers to his mind being stuck on her (ie. his twitter rant about her writing on TIWYCF and writing and releasing a song about her a few months later) - also referring to his lie about them never talking about working together (which she reportedly took offense to).

>The second verse is pretty obvious in it's topic of Tom. Tom is a nice guy, but it's relatively well known that he is a little bit of a "playboy." Tom tried to use Taylor's celebrity in their whirlwind romance, flying her around the world and getting pictures of them together. When Taylor came to her senses, she left before Tom realized she wasn't going to try and help him.

deleted: I've never heard anything about Tom being a playboy and I was a hardcore fan for a few years. He kept his relationships insanely private until Taylor and had only dated like 2 women since getting famous (Kat Dennings and someone non-famous). Hiddleswift was shocking because he went on and on about how he wasn't into the Hollywood scene at all.

Getaway Car is about Tom. IDSB to me isn't really about anyone specific, it's just about who she was as a romantic partner before she met Joe.

Well, well, well. Where do I even begin? HOLY FUCK TAYLOR SWIFT CURSED IN A SONG MY INNOCENT EARS. This is the song that should’ve lead off the era, it does everything LWYMMD does, but better. The gunshots and the outro of the chorus are brilliant! The controversy is high for this song because uh, it’s this song lol. Bye Kayne, Taylor is a better rapper than you ever will be.

# This song is only for bad bitches and swifties ONLY
--- 


**CarlieScion** (11): This song should have been the lead single
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): Super catchy, the verses are amazing, and the chorus is so sing-along-able. The only quibble I have is with the bridge... I don't love the mentions of receipts/proof or witches, and wish she could've done something more in line with the verses lyrically
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): BOPBOPBOP seriously when she sings "over and over and over again if iiiii could" is one of the best parts of the album
 
**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): This is exactly what I was hoping Reputation would be.
 
**bwc222** (10): the best song to blast in the car, windows down, speeding down the highway
 
**Damoojo** (10): RATATATATATATATATA TATA
 
**dirdbub** (10): me: god, this is just 2015 future bass with a pop flare, it's kind of predictable and vapid and petty | also me: this is a SOTY
 
**jhxcb** (10): This is a true bop. There really isn't anything I would change about this song. So blunt and I love it.
 
**jimmy345960** (10): BOP
 
**leviswift13** (10): MY WIG WAS GONE, KIDNAPPED, INCINERATED WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS. Every lyric, production choice, melody and vocal part is absolute bad-ass perfection.
 
**MashLuke** (10): evil queen
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): honestly, I was extremely turned off after hearing the "ra-da-da-da-da" part, but this bops and definitely has a shot to be a hit. Even more so if it was released prior the album dropped.
 
**NapsAndNetflix** (10): should have been lead single LWYMMD is shaking
 
**Piccprincess** (10): I gave this a 10 and IT JUST FELT SO (POW POW) GOOD. GOOD.
 
**skargardin** (10): A huge banger! It's got that ominous, filthy feeling that makes it work very well with Taylor's narrative. And the gunshots and Taylor's own "ratatatatata" part are all very clever.
 
**SpanKKy1** (10): taylor said a swear
 
**specfagular** (10): SHE FUCKIN SNAPPED
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): megabop
 
**vhqv1997** (10): Was the "something" here your album promotion, Taylor? Because I agree completely, except for the "it feels so good" part
 
**zamomattel** (10): tbh this probs should have been the 2nd single
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.5): It took a while for the "RATATATA" hook at the post-chorus to grow on me. I remember hearing that and I was like "What the fuck?"
 
**hikkaru** (9.5): I'm kinda sick of the edginess but it still slaps
 
**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Taylor saying "shit" is lowkey my religion.
 
**Albert\_Cole** (9.3): This is Taylor being *good* at being evil.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (9): HOLY SHIT TAYLOR CURSED IN A SONG
 
**followingfreeways** (9): the way she says "I'd do it over and over again if I could" is so iconic
 
**gannade** (9): edgy taylor is best taylor. the verses and chorus are a 10 but the post chorus where she just stutters is questionable
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song slaps super hard for a Taylor song. The chorus is so good. However I really don't like the bridge at all, it's flows so bad. So that's why I can't give this song a 10. (also Taylor needs to swear in music more)
 
**m4ttycool** (9): dadadadadada
 
**melodyllic\_** (9): this is everything that look what you made me do aspires to be, classic shady taylor without the childishness and lyrical cliches
 
**Raykel** (9): Omg the synths sounding like horns going back and forth and the chopped vocals on the chorus, I can ignore try-hard Taylor here.
 
**topesmachine** (9): dark and brooding but fun!
 
**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): One of the strongest/my favorite songs on the album. Not sure why but I really like those ratatatats. Also, everyone needs to listen to Shoshana Bean and Cynthia Erivo's cover of this.
 
**fourchip** (8.5): look what you made me do but with structure
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): In another universe, Hilary Clinton is president and this was the lead single for reputation.
 
**strawberryswing1** (8.5): The chorus drop SNATCHES my wig. I wish Taylor would shut the fuck up about Kimye though, the constant victim-ness about her is tiring. She managed to acknowledge it in her MV then did nothing about it. The bridge keeps the song from being perfect.
 
**camirose** (8): If you asked me during the 1989 era if I'd have machine gun soundbites and swearing on the next album I don't know if I'd have believed it.
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Fuck the production on the hook with the vocals is so good
 
**cyborglilith** (8): The production everywhere but the seizure post-chorus slays. Listen to this alone at night and get mesmerized.
 
**dwarfgourami** (8): inb4 it should have been the first single
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8): 100% this should have been the lead single. It's Bad!Taylor without coming off super tryhard and unlike a lot of people I'm not actually super turned off by the guy voice.
 
**kappyko** (8): unfortunately a bridge ruins a fucking badass post-chorus. the wobble is kinda awfully dated but it still sounds cool
 
**letsallpoo** (8): me when i order $25 worth of takeout at 1am for the third day in a row
 
**quaerex** (8): This song would have been a perfect lead single, but looking at it objectively it's just decent. It's catchy and I like the verses, but that bridge is awful. Taylor stop playing the victim omfg
 
**SupremeShani** (8): Swifities say that this song should have been the lead single off the album, and I wish it was too. The song builds up to the chorus that actually delivers, and I am obsessed with those gunshot sounds.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (8): It's a shame that the bridge kind of ruins it
 
**thetimidmartian** (8): somewhat less production-reliant than the other songs on the album, her vocals are surprisingly effective if screamy. the songwriting is weak though, and that drop toward the end is pure garbage
 
**vayyiqra** (8): liking this electro sound
 
**crowlily** (7.7): it's astonishing and pretty mindblowing
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (7.5): The first track on the album that actually sells danger. That bridge/final chorus are such a letdown though.
 
**itsboogiepanda** (7.5): Ratatatatatatatatatataaa ratatatatatatatatatataaa Ratatatatatatatatatataaa daa daa daaa daaaa instruments found dead in the ditch
 
**awryj** (7): The bass in this song is kind of ridiculous... But it's a bop so I dunno
 
**Brendon-Urine** (7): I really like her singing in the chorus. The post-chorus is annoying though.
 
**natsby** (7): I like this song but not as much as everyone else seems to
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i knew you were trouble is shaking
 

 
**theNealCutter** (7): i'm not sure whether I like this song. on one hand, it's a bop and it's WAAAY better than LWYMMD, but on the other hand, it's also really insecure. like i'm so tired of Taylor playing the victim. it feels half-baked.
 
**VodkaInsipido** (7): a bop
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): I'm so confused as to what this bitch did and why she can't fully commit to being the witch they're burning? Also the gunshot sounds are a boot.
 
**stardustanddinos** (6.5): THE GUNSHOTS OMGGG!!! THE CHORUS!!!! AHHHHH! THE STUTTER CHORUS!!! The song is an assault on the senses the first time lmao, but it's kinda weak compared to the others.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): There's some good ideas here, but the bass and "dah-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-dah-dah" in the chrous bring it down a bit for me.
 
**dropthehammer11** (6): This song has some really cool elements. the production is very loud and erratic, the chorus has a nice bombastic approach, but I find the songwriting to be very awkward and kind of confused on what it wants to be. All in all, it's alright, but could've been better.

**therokinrolla** (10): In an alternate universe where the reputation era wasn't so poorly done, this was the lead single. It does LWYMMD better than LWYMMD, meanwhile it is also a good song that leaves an impact. The bridge is kinda yikes, but this whole song is a wild trip. Imagine the reactions to this being her comeback? Whereas LWYMMD was just a song for shock value, this has both shock value and quality value. WTF taylor?
 
**TheStarSquad** (10): holy FUCKING shit. I actually goddamn started choking at this song! I was on the floor of my room at midnight and my jaw hit the floor as soon as this masterpiece of a track began. Basically, IDSB is everything I love about LWYMMD cranked up to level 11. First of all, it does everything that this album needed to do in terms of addressing her feuds and public controversies. In my opinion, the first verse is about her infamous feud, and the second is about Calvin/all her exes. Along the lines of Blank Space it calls out the media's perception of character in such a perfect way. I love that she actually admits to doing something wrong, but I love even MORE how she admits to enjoying it. Add on to all of that the amazing and flawless melodies, the production, everything!!! I was actually shaking when I heard IDSB and it remains one of the best on the album. That is a fact, not an opinion. If this is not a single I will sue Taylor mark my words. I need a music video and live performances ASAP. Dark Taylor, what a concept! She pulls it off so well in this song, it is so good!!! I definitely did not expect this but I am so glad it exists. The verses are amazing, the pre-chorus goes off, the chorus shakes me to the core and the post-chorus "tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tchah-tchah" was so very unexpected but it adds so much to the track, some of the best production on the album, and there is a lot of amazing production. EVERYTHING about IDSB blew me away in the best way possible

**enecks** (10): WHAT THE FUCK? I GAVE THIS A 10? Yeah, I should justify myself. I did something really bad. But it felt so good. Jokes aside... lol I can't put the joke aside this song is comedy gold. A beat that clips into itself, Taylor trying to be a badass, THE FUCKING GUNSHOTS. OH MY GOD WHEN I HEARD THOSE GUNSHOTS I STARTED LAUGHING. RADADADADATYATYA. When the LWYMMD wave of dust settled, I was still looking forward to the album because I expected unexpected comedy gold. This is the only song that lived to that mantle.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): WHY IS THIS NOT A SINGLE YET???? its so petty and agressive and cold and calculated and gahhh everything i wanted from TS6. and that semi-voguesque gun imitations in the chorus, holy shit, i screamed the first time listening to this song and i still feel so badass even though i know its a bit childish but i dont really give a fuck i just wanna get revenge on someone i dont even have problems with

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Almost everybody is going to say this, but this should have definitely been the lead single. I'm not a huge fan of it, but it covers all the controversy Look What You Made Me Do was trying to achieve, and it'd be way less off-putting to the general public, too. Make no mistake, though; this song doesn't show any signs of being satirical, and thus the edginess here is not constantly palatable. I get the hype, but I also get the hatred. It is entertaining, however; I'm not sure anybody can get bored by this.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Never once did I think I would hear gunshots in a Taylor Swift song, but here we are. For all intents and purposes, I Did Something Bad is a perfect example of the dated, undefined lack of clarity that exists on the instrumentals in reputation, and like Filthy, it's hard not to cringe at how birthed of 2012 EDM it sounds, but at the end of the day, the energy of this track, combined with the fact that there's a menacing and convincing pitched-down "DEATHTRAP," it seems like there's a running theme here. There's dissonance between vocals and instrumentals, and yet it works in a clunky kind of way.

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): this is actually a MAJOR bop but the real something bad she did was the bridge. delete burn it fat witch
 
**jonnl2806** (5): Everyone seems to love the vocal drop in the chorus but I kinda hate it. The verses are the only good thing about the song.
 
**milkywayinradius** (5): WUB WUBBB, WUB WUBBB
 
**robbiec\_** (5): like it's fun but it is a good example of the eleven year old with a playground revenge fantasy although i think it's about sex idk i'm baby
 
**MissyBee37** (4): I give this song points mainly for originality & bravery. I don't like it, at all. But the lyrics are honest, for better or worse, and she went for a bold statement here. The chorus is kind of catchy, but I hate the music & that "ra-ta-ta" hook afterward.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): This was going to get a 6 until I heard that drop. No.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): The production sounds dated as fuck and the distorted vocals make me cringe. But at least she doesn't rap on this so meh.
 
**SkyBlade79** (4): white gay culture is screaming yas to taylor swearing on a song. production is bad and the pop drop is so annoying
 
**theburningundead** (4): the gunshots in the chorus just make me want to go listen to paper planes instead
 
**VeganSquash** (4): generic, and besides, what did Taylor "do" lol, be a little bitchy to Kanye? Give me a break
 
**camerinian** (3.5): Remember when Taylor didn't resort to lyrical cliches as the basis of her songs? Because I don't she's always done that stop lying to yourself
 
**moki** (3): farrah abraham
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): What are you doing, Max? This is the same guy who produced Into You.
 
**Glennishill** (2.5): Guys, Taylor said "Shit" in a song, look how mature she is. I saw that video where she says she woke up in the middle of the night and recorded that ratata hook and they literally took the recording and mixed it into the song and I think that says a lot about the quality of this album's songwriting. Dull and super samey.
 
**fifthchevron** (2): Sometimes the chorus gets me hype, but mostly I cringe at how awful she must've been to date when she fully embraced the way of living she describes here.
 
**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (2): hey guys i'm bad now but also anyone that calls me bad is mean
 
**joshually** (2): This song is merely ok. The gun shots are a little on-the-nose and topically speaking, is very inappropriate for the times.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (2): I thought we left dubstep back in 2012? The chorus is painful and the lyrics just as bad.
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (1): Sounds like a reject from "The Beginning" by the Black Eyed Peas
 
**ComeOnAndSLANG** (1): they're burning all the witches even if you aren't one..... ok ok ok ok ok OK
 
**CreepyMannequin** (1): I'm a Kanye stan
 
**MrSwearword** (1): you ever look up that one Allmusic review of Willa Ford's album where it's called shockingly cynical and crass or something to that effect? I just wanted to bring that up to distract from this bullshit "oooh look at me I'm such a tuffy" "song"
 
**twat\_brained** (1): Is Taylor trying to imitate a machine gun on the post-chorus? Also what the hell is this production? WHO LET THIS ONTO THE FINAL TRACKLIST? This era truly is Taylor's Glitter. Not her ARTPOP because that album has nothing but bops.

I love this song so much and it didn’t deserve to be left out. /r/letsallpoo is screaming at this being a Japanese Bonus track. Emotions are a complicated thing to write and sing about, our legend CRJ would know. I think I just love this so much that I’m sad this never got a single release as well.

**vayyiqra** (11): this, in fact, made me emotional
 
**1313Harbor** (10): I'm so obsessed with the way she sings the lyric "Stab me right in the heart with a fucking knife"
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): powerful stuff
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): the lyrics are way too good and personal for me to give this anything less than a perfect song, but I'm glad tbh that this didn't make it onto the regular edition. The production is very off from the album's vibe. But hey, this song is a perfect example for Witness to make a perfect personal emotional electro-synth pop song.
 
**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Wow, didn't listen to it up until now, but it's very direct and beautiful.
 
**fourchip** (10): All over, deep under my skin/You got me so emotional/We had something that never happened/If only we had lost control/Ohh, so emotional/Ohh, so emotional/Ahh, so emotional/Ahh, so emotional
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (10): Okay honestly this song could have been fit into this album somewhere. I get that it may have been too emotionally heavy but ultimately this is the most personal song of hers that I've ever listened to, and the production being top tier adds to an already amazing track.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I'm really opposed to region exclusive songs because they're often good. This is a prime example of a region exclusive song that should be heard.
 
**MissyBee37** (10): Why isn't this available in the U.S.?? It's so good It's painfully honest and vulnerable in the lyrics but such a cool sound. I wish more of the album sounded like this because this is a direction I would have loooved to hear her take.
 
**skargardin** (10): I've never heard this before and it's actually one of my new favourites on the album, definitely the most electronic of the bunch. Great lyrics, especially the lines in the first verse and the bridge.
 
**twat\_brained** (10): The production sounds like it's not even from this album and that's what makes me love it so much.
 
**jimmy345960** (9.6): First time listening to this even though I bought this album and its spectacular.
 
**CreepyMannequin** (9.5): We love an emotionally honest queen!
 
**camerinian** (9): I'm listening to this song for the first time for the rate, and my jaw is on the floor. This is so stark, so brutal, I'm at a loss for words. No wonder this wasn't on the main version of the album, it really doesn't fit in.
 
**cyborglilith** (9): ):
 
**Elitefourbrad** (9): Honestly, with a catchy instrumental drop added, this would slay on radio. Such a shame this didn't make the cut originally.
 
**enecks** (9): How the fuck isn't this on the album it's good
 
**Glennishill** (9): WOW! This was really good. I can't believe this wasn't on the album because it's better than all her trashy country tunes.
 
**itsboogiepanda** (9): Why does the Japanese always get the good tracks as an exclusive
 
**MashLuke** (9): :sadhugging:
 
**melodyllic\_** (9): conflicted cause this is such an emotionally revealing song yet its still a boppy bop.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This should've been released here.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): I wish it wasn't so hard to find a good quality version of this, but its SO GOOD that it was definitly worth the effort.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Strong song but IMO, it didn't fit in Rainbow
 
**vhqv1997** (9): This song was so personal and dark. Perhaps it should have been included on the official version but it probably didn't really fit the themes of healing and love
 
**PenOrAPencil** (8.5): the song really shows the extent to which Kesha struggled during the Dr. Luke days. However, I do understand why it was left out of the album. The dark and brooding mood of the song seems incongruous to the rest of the album tracks which have recurrent themes of optimism and getting through adversity.
 
**quaerex** (8.5): Insanely honest and kind of hard to listen to but it's really well-done.
 
**crowlily** (8): The beat! The beginning! The chorus and her vocals! I really like this!!! I think it's honest and dark and wow. One of my favorites.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): WHY IS THIS ONLY AVAILABLE IN JAPAN? This is so good. What the fuck, Japan gets everything nice.
 
**dropthehammer11** (8): great little tune right here
 
**dwarfgourami** (8): I never heard this song before this rate but I love it! The clunky lyrics are the only thing holding it back
 
**followingfreeways** (8): brutally honest and heartbreaking. good song, thank u rate for showing me this song, I had no idea this existed!!
 
**gannade** (8): i am SCREAMING that this is a bonus track when the entire second half of this album was included instead. even the LQ pitched youtube version I had to use sounds so much better than most of whatever was I had to listen to the past 20 minutes
 
**hikkaru** (8): why are good songs always bonus tracks?
 
**jonnl2806** (8): Ugh why does Japan always get the good stuff
 
**kappyko** (8): omg why do the JApanese get this BOP EXCLUSIVE
 
**specfagular** (8): Ummmmm Kesha hunny why ain't this on Apple Music????
 
**SupremeShani** (8): This song was such a pain to find, but from what I've heard, I liked it.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A really solid track that should've been on the album, or should've been the direction of the album, honestly.
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): I was originally going to give this a 7, but then the line "I'm supposed to be some party girl that stands for nothing" boosted the score. This is a sad one, but I love the production!
 
**leviswift13** (7.9): I can see why it wasn't on the standard edition, but I think this is one of her best vocal performances.
 
**Albert\_Cole** (7.6): Japan deserved better
 
**VeganSquash** (7.5): I couldn't find a good quality version to listen to so I had to listen to this really low quality one. Anyway it probably sounds better then what a listened to.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Hymn if it was made in 2012?
 
**MaydayPVZ** (7): All I could find was some atrocious audio file
 
**Mudkip1** (7): this reminds me of reputation and witness meshed together and it gives me ptsd
 
**natsby** (7): why are bonus tracks always more interesting than some of the filler tracks in the core album?
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is only available on Soundcloud, and for some reason the quality is terrible. I tried to look past that, and I'm fairly sure this is actually a great song that harkens back to Kesha's dance-pop days whilst still keeping the tone of Rainbow. If that's the case, I'm sad it isn't on the standard edition. Then again, the poor quality makes me unsure of what the song actually sounds like, so unfortunately I'll have to give this a seven.
 
**Raykel** (7): It's good but I see why it's not on the main tracklist. Doesn't fit with everything else.
 
**rickikardashian** (7): Although being one of the tracks that are very specific, this just doesn't feel as good as the rest of the album, it's just like, meh
 
**thetimidmartian** (7): the belting is a little screamy and the production is a little dated, but she sounds great, and so do the lyrics
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7): This is pretty synthpoppy so I'm not surprised this was relegated to JPN bonus track territory. It's not bad at all though.
 
**zamomattel** (7): pour your heart out girl
 
**deadspiderwall** (6.9): super honest lyrics wow
 
**jhxcb** (6.8): I love pre-Rainbow Kesha, but she doesn't belong here. I'm glad this track didn't make it on the regular album. It sounds like it was pulled straight from Warrior. Also, there's no subtlety in these lyrics at all, and her lyrics were so amazing on Rainbow.

So, I personally have never gotten the hype for this. I mean yeah it’s a sweet and happy closer to a fairly good album, but isn’t that what all of the ballads have been about on the album anyways? I don’t understand what a Spaceship has to do with rainbows. Whenever I listen to this song, I’m get scared since I hate aliens. But 5 of y’all liked it enough to give it your 11s, so that’s a plus I guess.
 
---
 
# Abducted By Aliens
**BrokenGlassSparkling** (11): Brought tears to my eyes, a perfect closer.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): this is such a perfect album Closer (feat. Halsey). Everything Kesha went though, her state of mind, told in a metaphorical manner and it works. I rarely give 11's in a rate but I have so much emootionoal connection with this one that it truly deserves an 11. I just fear that being a little too slow and over 5 minutes long would almost guarantee a low placement for this one. Otherwise, I would be so shook.
 
**sedridd** (11): Such a beautiful song, I've cried listening to it countless times.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (11): My most played song across these three albums
 
**whatareblackhole** (11): When I was younger, I felt such a close connection to aliens and wished they come take me away because I couldn't comprehend being queer. I was sick of being bullied and felt that outer space was where I truly belonged. I sobbed the first time I heard this song because I'd never heard anyone come close to explaining that feeling so vividly. Thank you, Kesha. When they come for me, I'll make sure we come get you, too.
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): what a beautiful closer (except for the outro speech). probably one of the best hooks on the entire album and the lyrics just hit me in a certain place.
 
**Albert\_Cole** (10): I wrote this off the first time I heard it. Weirdly, it was my straight best friend who convinced me to relisten with fresh ears, and... it's one of Kesha's best songs. I sing it to myself a little every now then. Most recently, I sang it when I left the club in the middle of the night to wander around by the riverside. Kesha makes it really easy to fall under the song's spell, and to spend a few moments believing that there really *is* a spaceship coming back for me.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): I can't get enough of this song. If Praying was the emotional anthem, this is her haunting Swan Song, especially considering that Kesha really believes that a spaceship will pick her up after death. Spaceship carries such a power within... It's beautiful, but also fun; stripped down, but also gospel-like; and that ending is one of my favorite musical moments ever. It feels more like a statement or a poem than a song tbh. This is definitely in her "all time best Kesha songs", if that Ms Mojo ho doesn't mention it I'll riot.
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): raw and pure
 
**camerinian** (10): I don't think I really processed how much I love this song since it's at the end of the album and isn't really an instant grabber, but wow this is beautiful. It encapsulates everything from this album and wraps it into a bittersweet package. That spoken-word passage brings me to the verge of tears god damn
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): take me 2 ur planet
 
**joshually** (10): I get CHILLS during her spoken word portion. My fingers get numb, my ears start to tingle, and I can't feel my toes. THAT'S HOW COLD I GET LISTENING TO THIS SONG BECAUSE IT IS SO POWERFUL
 
**nooodisaster** (10): I have flashbulb memories for songs a lot, and this one hit me like a BRICK. I'm in Los Angeles, sitting in my near unfurnished apartment. It's my first day after moving across the country. The floors are empty except for my suitcases, and my bed is in a corner with two boxes stacked together as a nightstand. I remember feeling excited, and warm, and ready to make a change.
 
**skargardin** (10): Instant goosebumps. The production and the outro are fucking everything. What a perfect way to close the album and given the journey she's been on makes it even more emotional.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is a perfect outro to this album. A little weird, a little artsy, and very emotional. Encompasses all of the album and gives it a great send off.
 
**SupremeShani** (10): I should hate this song, I don't believe in half of the lyrics, it's like listening to a crazy space hippie, and the song lasts over five minutes. But I love everything about it, it's one of my favorite songs off the album, and I cry every time Kesha gets taken away by aliens and becomes stardust.
 
**theburningundead** (10): beautiful song, perfect end to the album
 
**theNealCutter** (10): it's a gorgeous ending. I'm in tears listening to this right now as I write this. I don't know why. I've been depressed for so long. I'm so tired of not feeling anything good for months, and for me, the "Spaceship" is happiness, and just like Kesha, I'm waiting for it to come back to me.
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song has probably spoken to me the most of anything on the album. It's the atmospheric, weary, and raw conclusion to a very emotional album. Any time that I want to just leave my life behind when I'm just tired of everything, this is the song that plays in my head. It's a beautiful finisher, and it wouldn't work without Kesha's fantastic delivery and the minimal but wonderful production.
 
**TheStarSquad** (10): Super underrated. An amazing emotional piece about Kesha's experience with feeling out of place, and feelings lots of people can relate to. The spoken outro is the best possible way to close the album.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): This song always makes me so emotional. I think it speaks to anyone who often feels lonely, even while being surrounded by other people whose company you supposedly enjoy
 
**fourchip** (9.5): only slightly less odd than her song about fucking ghosts
 
**jhxcb** (9.5): This song legitimately makes me cry sometimes. I relate so hard. I have to knock off a little for the extra stuff at the end. I just don't think it's necessary. It could've used more song.
 
**awryj** (9): I hated The Little Prince when I was kid. Kesha makes me want to reread it
 
**enecks** (9): One of the more interesting angles of this album to analyse is the use of religious iconography - Judaeo-Christian heaven and hell in Praying, reincarnation in Finding You, and spaceships coming for Kesha in this. Given this album is ultimately optimistic about the future and things getting better, this is a great album closer.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (9): A fucking gorgeous closing track and honestly, I wish I could have a spaceship pick me up too Kesha.
 
**leviswift13** (9): A perfect closer for such an emotional, beautiful and raw journey!
 
**quaerex** (9): Oh baby, that outro. You can't beat that.
 
**specfagular** (9): Uuuuuuugh I love this song
 
**zamomattel** (9): i love this, i think so many people can relate to it<3
 
**therokinrolla** (8.8): an impactful closer. This song joins Praying and Rainbow in the "Golden Trio of Impactful Lyrics." It's arguably better lyrically than the other two: Praying and Rainbow mean more when put together with Kesha's story, but Spaceship stands alone. It is a story of being an outcast, of always feeling not quite in your place, and hoping that something will somehow find you and take you home. It's almost haunting. It's a beautiful send off, if a little sad. Kesha, after still coming out triumphant through all her pain, still somehow doesn't feel in her place. But the album still ends in hope. And isn't this what this whole album is, hope?
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Pretty cute acoustic song, comes off as quirky in a good way. It really sums up the personality Kesha is trying to convey on this album.

deleted: 
**CarlieScion** (8): A solid closer
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): A great album closer, but the one song on the album where Kesha's voice is a bit grating
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This song is longer than it needed to be but this is an excellent song to close the album. It's so heartfelt and you can tell her passion of aliens in this song.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): Love the country vibe this has mixed in. Also love the random spaceship noises at the end!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): A fine enough closer, but still a weaker track on the album.
 
**MashLuke** (8): nothing to say, just a cute song
 
**melodyllic\_** (8): the spoken word section is amazing and makes this a great closer to the album. queen of dematerialising into nothing
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I would've given this a higher score, but the outdo runs a bit longer
 
**VeganSquash** (8): great spoken outro
 
**crowlily** (7.8): I like this! I'm not saying much rip but this is great! The guitar sounds great! The spoken bridge! I love the whole mood! I'm nothing more than recycled stardust!!!
 
**deadspiderwall** (7.8): Kesha is more country than Taylor Swift ever was, holy shit
 
**robbiec\_** (7.5): CANNOT put my finger on what old song this reminds me of. Also love when she says "and I know nothing" and the ship takes off among the perfectly subtle choir
 
**stardustanddinos** (7.5): It stretches a little longer than it should, but is a perfect closer. Sometimes you just want to not live on this planet anymore, and yeah, she bottles that into a song too. Wonder how she does it so well, this is really impressive. The ending is just unsettling and haunting. Well fucking done.
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Pretty good too
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Yeah, sorry, this is sad, but Kanye did this better. Kesha's statement at the end is actually kind of depressing, though, and I'm certainly not complaining about this being the closer.
 
**SkyBlade79** (7): not bad, a bit long but doesn't feel like it drags
 
**thetimidmartian** (7): kesha closes on an appropriate note that supports her tenets of hope and defiance.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): good but enough country
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (7): "Don't lay me down with the dirt on my head" is such a beautiful line. I really love the message of the song & identify with it. I do think it goes too long though and the outro is cheesy
 
# Alien Haters
 
**twat\_brained** (6.2): This one is quite long and it feels long too. Also I understand the song's outro but it still doesn't feel necessary.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): The concept is interesting but the execution kinda falls flat for closing track.

Wow, so okay this song is definitely one of the highlights from *Rainbow* in my opinion. Honestly, it’s just real country fun and it’s what this album should’ve had more of. I loved bopping to this song as the summer drew down, watching the hot cowboys from across the street, hoping they’d notice me. Those two guys eventually noticed me and we had a jolly ol’ threesome to pass the time but that’s a story for another day.

# :yeehaw:
 
**Leixander** (11): :yeehaw:
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): country bop!
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): perfect country song to change back the tone of the album to fun. she really knows her stuff. with this being as the first song of the last part of the album, it really just help us come down from the emotional high and doesn't take a toll on the listener.
 
**fourchip** (10): yeehaw 🤠
 
 
**jonnl2806** (10): One of my favs from the first time I heard it and a several months later it still holds up! The country influences work so well on this one.
 
**joshually** (10): A throwback to trashy Kesha, but with shades of the new country gal
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Now this is how you make some goddamn country music.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): me: i hate country music. me after one listen of this
 
**tevinterimperium** (10): Relatable
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): yeehaw bop
 
**theNealCutter** (10): This is just a fun bop. Like I don't know damn. I've been in a rough patch lately relationship-wise, and I'm not afraid to be new people right now, but damn I'm gonna do that person bad shit if he hurts me like the last person did.
 
**stardustanddinos** (9.5): It's fun, catchy and doesn't have a single dull second. I'm playing this song at my damn wedding; my husband better be careful.
 
**VeganSquash** (9.5): the chorus is perfection, but I don't like the bridge
 
**zamomattel** (9.5): this sounds like if as long as i got you by lily allen was good
 
**camerinian** (9): Holy shit this song is so fun, like how could you not do a little jig with that guitar rollick
 
**Elitefourbrad** (9): Okay I really love the sassiness of Kesha that comes out on this track. Saying she will hunt you down is very intimidating and I would be scared of Kesha.
 
**enecks** (9): Women will save country.
 
**kappyko** (9): yodel-yoldeoleldo elhoe kiykj oplde ookh ohhhhohowoaohoawaohoaohoaowo yoldeliedielo dosie doe dosied damn girl
 
**MashLuke** (9): I'd let her hunt me down tbh
 
**melodyllic\_** (9): "how to be nonchalantly obsessive and murderous while sounding innocent" 101 with kesha
 
**SupremeShani** (9): I thought people were going to take offense to this song and say how bad it would be if the genders were reversed, but then I found out songs like that actually existed and this was Kesha's response to them. What an unproblematic icon, Taylor and Katy could never.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): I really love the post-chorus riff. Kesha should go in this direction for her next album. Also, this is pretty reminiscent of the work of Maren Morris, everyone should check her album out!
 
**ulikejazz** (9): wow Kesha just wrote my wedding vows
 
**vhqv1997** (9): I mean it's an amazing song but one time my friend showed me the overly attached girlfriend meme when I introduced her to this song and now I can't not associate this song with that forsaken image
 
**jhxcb** (8.8): Let me just grab my cowboy hat, I guess I'm into country now.
 
**skargardin** (8.5): Such a fun song, I also love the Johnny Cash-esque beginning.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Pretty nice country-like sound. It's a little different from other songs on the album, but it still fits well.
 
**therokinrolla** (8.5): :flushed:
 
**topesmachine** (8.5): wow country goddess WHOM fearless-era taylor wishes
 
**Albert\_Cole** (8.4): In the concert, she mixed this in with Timber. I prefer it without, weirdly
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): Sounds like a more peppy "I walk the Line"
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Among the new things Kesha is doing in this album, I definitely like this type of sound the most.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (8): Lyrically, this is kinda like a sequel to Stephen. Especially the spoken part "Don't make me kill you."
 
 
**natsby** (8): I didn't realise how much I would like a countrier Kesha
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Is this song problematic? Isn't killing a bad thing? Shouldn't hunting be banned? Discuss. Okay, seriously, I think this is one of the best country songs on Rainbow, and I was a bit disappointed it never took the crown on our charts (unless it did, in which case slap me)
 
**robbiec\_** (8): My mum likes this song
 
**sletrab07** (8): Johnny Cash is shook, June who?
 
**SpanKKy1** (8): me @ shawn
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): It's like a vengeful version of the Texas song from SpongeBob and honestly I'm here for that.
 
**leviswift13** (7.8): She's a cutie!
 
**crowlily** (7.7): The beat is cool! Reminds me a little of the doo-wop kinda songs. Omg it's about cheating? I like this more already. Reminds me of This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things. I see this becoming one of my favorites.
 
**dirdbub** (7.5): this is a fun song, but highkey forgettable
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): Ngl, this is fun but kinda creepy lmao.
 
**quaerex** (7.2): The style switching gives me whiplash but damn if Kesha can't do whatever genre she wants. This one feels like she's winking at us. Love the chorus.
 
**twat\_brained** (7.1): Loving the crossover vibes here between pop and country. Kind of offput by the fact that this is just a thinly-veiled death threat though
 
**deadspiderwall** (7): love the I Walk the Line references!
 
**dropthehammer11** (7): Y E E F U C K I N G H A W
 
**MrSwearword** (7): the production is annoying as shit BUT I love how Kesha straight up says to the love interest "if you fuck around, boy I'll Hunt You Down"
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): don't make me kill you?
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (7): Decent yodeling song, instrumentation is nice too
 
**awryj** (6): :yeehaw:
 
 
# Hoedown Throwdown Time!
 
**Mudkip1** (8): Boom boom clap Boom de clap de clap Boom boom clap Boom de clap de clap Try it with me Here we go Boom boom clap Boom de clap de clap Thats right! boom de clap de clap Boom boom clap Boom de clap de clap One, two, three, everybody C'mon off your seats I'm gonna tell ya 'bout a beat That's gonna make ya move your feet I'll give the barbecue Show and tell you how to move If you're five or eighty two This is somethin' you can do Pop it, lock it Polka dot it Countrify then hip hop it Put your hawk in the sky Side to side Jump to the left Stick it, glide Zig zag cross the floor Shuffle in diagonal When the drum hits Hands on your hips One foot it, 180 twist And then a, zig zag Step, slide Lean it left Clap three times Shake it out Head to toe Throw it all together That's how we roll Do the hoedown (throwdown) Do the hoedown (throwdown) Do the hoedown (throwdown)
 
 
# Joanne who?
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is how you make a FULL country song! @LadyGaga @MileyCyrus @WhiteTwinksThatCallThoseAlbumsCountryUnironically
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): Joanne is shaking!
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Lady Gagas attempt at "Country" found dead in a ditch
 
**dwarfgourami** (7): Joanne who?
 
**Raykel** (7): This made me want to put cowboy boots on more then Joanne or Younger Now ever did.
 
 
 
# /r/countryheads haters
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Okay, I get it, she's doing that thing where she finds herself with country music and also she's super violent and hunting down her ex, but it's like all over the place, lacking the tact to make this feel anything more than a diversion in the album.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): wtf country why
 
**VodkaInsipido** (6): this is where the album starts to downhill
 
**itsboogiepanda** (5): Can't get to grooves with the country vibes
 
**SkyBlade79** (5): stop calling yourself a kitty you furry
 
**CarlieScion** (4): I am suddenly in Johnny Cash-land. I do not enjoy Johnny Cash-land. The only reason this isn't my 0 is because the chorus is hella catchy.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (4): I'm sorry but this track just doesn't do it for me. It's decent but ehhhhhh
 
**thetimidmartian** (4): the heavy production is overbearing at times. ultimately its classy filler.
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): this i do not like
 
**Glennishill** (2): Yee-haw, y'all I hate this song.

MissyBee37: I am going to focus on the positive: "CTTR," "Roulette," "Witness" & "Pendulum" still have a shot at making *Witness* proud!!

Also, all of the *reputation* songs I hate most are gone. "Delicate" & "Getaway Car" deserve to be near the top.

I don't know why I'm surprised, but I am still surprised that Kesha is dominating sooo strongly!!

PS. I gave Pendulum a ten, its a bop.
