https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/86m9i8/the_2017_ultimate_album_rate_day_1_the_shittiest/

Hi gays and homosexuals (and straights. #diversity)! Today we're about to find out the worst of the worst of these controversial, "best" 2017 albums. Who will go out first? Katy Perry, Kesha, or ~~Look What You Made Me Do~~ Taylor Swift?

We will be starting at

##2 pm EST!!

Oh, there'll be poorly-coordinated shitposts in the plug.dj too! [Here's a link to the plug](https://plug.dj/popheads/) I'd love it if you could stop around, there aren't any fancy homemade shit posts, simply because I'm not talented enough for that shit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

--- 

As you know, /u/infernalsolstice is unable to reveal his beautiful rate, so on Monday/Tuesday, I took on the task of revealing the rate, and /u/mudkip1, /u/elitefourbrad, and I took on making the write-ups! 

Today you will be seeing the writing expertise of /u/mudkip1, so please direct any complaints to him! /s 

**NOW**

Here are some fun facts:

-	/u/infernalsolstice has taken the crown for the most participated in rate, with a staggering **154** participants. 
-	The average score is **7.1231**
-	The average controversy score is **2.2056**. This means that anything above this score is considered 'controversial'
-       We will be revealing numbers **47-31** today, with the first two bonus rate songs going out as well!


I hope you guys have fun and are ready for it!

TheKneesOfOurBees: is a fantastic piece of pop perfection. from the incredible runs to the sizziling beat, meghan trainor is one fierce lady throughout the glorious track. despite this sub hatred for the song, it is actually a lot better than trash this sub like like "jog far along i" by carly ray jepcen and "to your insides" by arianna large. it is actually iconic and magnificent and is my vote for the next anthem of the popheads sub. never in a million years would a flop like SZA be able to create such a masterpiece with lyrics as poignant as   
"My life's a movie, Tom Cruise  
So bless me, baby, achoo"
in retrospect, it is actually clear to me that woth this song, and in fact, the entire album of thank you, meghan trainor actually created the pop universe that birthed iconic stars like most palone and due language.

poor kathey. The sad thing about this song going out so early is that I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. I understand why y‚Äôall haters with no taste wouldn‚Äôt appreciate the experimentation this song provides, and I mostly just think you didn‚Äôt give it enough of a chance. The autotune is rather interesting and I enjoy the rest of the song, too. 

Also, you might be saying ‚Äòwow, nine 0‚Äôs, that‚Äôs quite a bit right.‚Äô 

If so, then honey, you‚Äôve got a big storm coming

**chipsi1** (10): the best song of all time
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I just definitely tasted what a darker Katy Perry song would have sounded like. The dark atmospheric production, the good use of autotune and some sad lyrics about her state of mind make this songs an underrated song on the album, as if the album isn't underrated enough. I know this will go out on Day 1 so I am giving this a 10.
 
**kromosol** (10): WüëÅÔ∏èKE
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I originally wrote this off as the worst song on Witness, but God that production is so dreamy.
 
**MissyBee37** (10): Grabbed me the first listen & never let go. Relatable, raw. Purity Ring shines on production. Love how she plays with melody on ‚Äúsweet surrender.‚Äù Mesmerizing.
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): this song is amazing and any other opinion is invalid
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Should've been the third single
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Definitely one of the stronger tracks off the album, albeit a bit anticlimatic
 
**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): I'm so confused by how much I like this song
 
**Glennishill** (8.5): I really like this track. I think it's vulnerable and heartfelt but also really banging and fun. Katy's voice is really on display here and I love it. I love the effect on words like "mind maze" and "hurricane."
 
**melodyllic\_** (8.5): a really interesting electronic track with some cool vocal manipulation and autotune choices
 
**jonnl2806** (8): I think the reason I like this is because Katy takes a backseat on the track. I kinda want to see what Katy would come out with if she went full PC music.
 
**SkyBlade79** (8): I love that she‚Äôs trying something new and the outro is amazing
 
**vayyiqra** (8): great atmosphere
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): Ooooh, come through, autotune! I like this one a lot. She sounds really good on the outro.
 
**banananaise** (7.5): this song has really stuck with me, but i think it could have gone without the distortion effects on her voice in some parts
 
**angusaditus** (7): kinda bops once you get used to it http://i.imgur.com/jWVNEWH.gif
 
**nooodisaster** (7): whoever invented midtempo songs please immediately EXIT (Euphorize now available on iTunes). Still, the echoing verses, rippling electronics of the verses, the building pre-chorus, all building to the bouncing electronics of the chorus... this shit sounds like a mind maze!! It's funky but overlong.
 
**skargardin** (7): The production is fantastic but the chorus and the added vocal effects are absolutely horrendous.
 
**leviswift13** (6.9): I feel like this had no reason to exist. The vocal effects are cool, though.
 
**PenOrAPencil** (6.9): the production is sick and actually saves the song from being unbearable
 
**awryj** (6.8): Really disappointing for a Purity Ring collab :(
 
**crowlily** (6.7): I don't like the autotune that pops up every once in a while :(
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (6.5): The lyrics in this one have been growing on me, but they still undercut the (genuinely interesting) production here.
 
**rickikardashian** (6.5): I know it's intentional and a lot of people live for it, but I can't stand the autotune gOD
 
**jhxcb** (6.1): This kind of seems like a pre-Rainbow Kesha reject. There isn't really anything that stands out about this song.
 
**deadspiderwall** (6): holy autotune
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): her mind, it amazes me
 
**itsboogiepanda** (6): Generic but okay. Taylor did vocoders better.
 
**natsby** (6): it's interesting at least?
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): listens to James Blake once
 
**theburningundead** (6): it's a mind maaaAAAAaaaaAAAaaaaze
 
**topesmachine** (5.5): forgettable but not exactly bad
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): interesting concept, bad execution.
 
**cyborglilith** (5): leave the weird vocal gimmicks to banks
 
**followingfreeways** (5): I really don't like the chorus on this song :/
 
**m4ttycool** (5): what is this
 
**MrSwearword** (5): the verses are better than the chorus, which is delivered in a really shitty vocal even by Katy Perry studio standards.
 
**MyselfAndAlpha** (5): hated witness on the first listen, but some of the songs are growing on me. this isn't one of them.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): I don‚Äôt really like the production here.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): This really was the year of pop songs with awful choruses, wasn't it?
 
**zamomattel** (5): on first listen this was a standout, but i dont think for positive reasons
 
**bwc222** (4.5): the grating, autotuned vocals completely ruin the chorus for me :/
 
**stardustanddinos** (4.5): It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ I guess? The autotuned chorus is not good at all.
 
**robbiec\_** (4.4): am I right to thing this song gets the most shit? the production is good but not for her unfortunately. the verses are good too
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): this isnt as bad as everyone said it would be ok
 
**Albert\_Cole** (4): I wasn't looking at song titles and had the playlist on shuffle, and this song was the first one I couldn't name before the singing started. Even then, I only got it by process of elimination
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (4): The weird autotune on the chorus really brings down an otherwise boring ballad
 
**SupremeShani** (4): I don't even think Purity Ring's production can make me like it.
 
**theNealCutter** (4): Pop2 is shook.
 
**thetimidmartian** (4): katy knows when to use her falsetto for sure, the outro is amazing. too bad she doesnt know how when to use autotune, because it makes this unlistenable.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (4): Honestly this isn't that bad outside of the autotune and the fact that there's a part in the middle where it feels like nothing is going on and you really want to turn it off
 
**camerinian** (3.5): God this auto-tune abuse on this song really highlights just how one-note Katy is on this album. If you can‚Äôt tell, the fatigue is really setting in, and I‚Äôm not even halfway through

deleted: ##Mind Fuck
 
**kappyko** (3.5): WHO APPROVED THIS CHORUS HAHAHAHAH
 
**camirose** (3): It goes somewhere kind of interesting on the verses and pre-chorus but then it turns out it actually ends at a burning bridge, flying off of a cliff at the chorus‚Ä¶ 2008 called and wants it‚Äôs autotune settings back. The fuck happened?
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (3): who would want to listen to this
 
**dwarfgourami** (3): Purity Ring is one of my favorite bands but this just doesn‚Äôt work
 
**gannade** (3): one of these days katy will realize that traditional ballads are not her strong suit
 
**VeganSquash** (3): you know, this is a mess, but its much better then I remember. I think the chorus is trash, and the song has no meaning, but the verses are decent.
 
**dirdbub** (2.5): what the fuck is that vocal work, it just sounds bad on this song
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (2.2): impurity ring
 
**twat\_brained** (2.2): ‚Ä¶this confuses me. Also, Katy is overkilling the AutoTune on this. I hope this isn't on the Witness Tour setlist.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (2): Autotuned mess
 
**fifthchevron** (2): Even Cher would be like "Girl that's too much autotune..."
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (2): I love Farrah Abrahams
 
**quaerex** (2): This starts out with a rash of clich√©s and doesn‚Äôt get better from there. I also don‚Äôt think the autotune works in this song, it‚Äôs unnecessary. Also the ‚ÄúCaught in a cage / A complex cage / Am I car on fire?‚Äù is a terrible series of lines.

##so i am confusion
 
**acedino** (1): Really don't get this song?
 
**CarlieScion** (1): What is this song
 
**DrunkHurricane** (1): that autotune though
 
**enecks** (1): This is the only song where the circlejerk nailed it. I really think Katy wants to be Kanye - both in the Taylor beef and as an acclaimed auteur artist. It's pathetic.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (1): ugh I hate the auto tune on this song. It ruins the potential of the song and makes the chorus super annoying. I guess props to her for trying something new though.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (1): The only reason this isn‚Äôt a 0 is because I already gave it to Hey3
 
**joshually** (1): "Am I a car on fire?" NO BUT THIS IS A CARWRECK I CAN'T LOOK AWAY FROM
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (1): I can't remember anything about this. At all. For a track that's supposed seems to aim for a stronger focus on production than vocals or lyrics, this has some of the least interesting production on Witness.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): yeah i never want to hear this again
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (0): a bad example of a song that should be relatable. i dont even have enough time to list all the problems with this, but the vocoder thingy is not working here, the lyrics are waaay too tryhard, and ugh. i just really hate this song. its bad and annoying and shouldnt be here. THIS IS A COMPETITION OF TALENTED ALBUMS NOT ALBUMS WHO KNOW HOW TO BUY MAX MARTIN
 
**fourchip** (0): i really thought Purity Ring Guy could do good on this track but like... i guess there‚Äôs only so much u can do
 
**izeasklapaucius** (0): How on the earth did this get through? How the hell Katy and her friends on studio said "oh this is great for a filler track" to this? They must've heard it before, right? Because this is so garbage. The production makes me want to vomit whatever in my stomach. The Auto-Tune nearly explode my cochlea. The lyrics are laughably bad when combined with the aforementioned ingredients. There's no single redeeming quality in this godawful mess.
 
**MashLuke** (0): I'm sorry but what
 
**SpanKKy1** (0): the inner machinations of my mind are an enigma
 
**specfagular** (0): Terrible. That‚Äôs all I have to say bc honestly I‚Äôm speechless at how bad this song is.
 
**ulikejazz** (0): katy no
 
**xCaseyKill10** (0): Between the autotune/vocoder mess in the chrous and the absymal lyrics, this song is clearly filler.

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (6.3): The lyrics are pretty decent in this song, mostly having to do with losing yourself, giving up, etc. The production feels kinda weird though, especially the chorus. Personally I would have preferred if it had a bit of a lower drop (if that makes sense?) Instead of it being loud and high-pitched, it'd be slower and lower pitched but thats just me.

**Average:** 5.495 **// Total Points:** 846.2 **// Controversy:** 2.359

I find the whole thing about it being called ‚Äòintimacy‚Äô really shoehorned and strange. It definitely comes off as a lot more faux-woke and a lot less mature. But I‚Äôm probably just overthinking it. I also think there‚Äôs a glaring length issue that plagues this song along with basically every other Katy Perry song. Why is it four and a half minutes long? Why are the majority of the songs in her discography this same length? All it does is make things drag along, which is exactly what I‚Äôm doing right now even though I gave this song a 7, lol.

also, open sesame

##In Timmy Sea

**vhqv1997** (10): The vocals, the lyrics, the sound. I wish Katy would put out more songs like this
 
**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): I just love Katy's lyrical style. It's controversial, I know, but I genuinely think nobody else has this insane, unique blend of mixed metaphors and colloquialisms. These are the most absurd lyrics on the album, and that's why *they're the most personal*. Only Katy Perry could describe herself as a camouflaged ship, and say her love interest is a sailor whose heart is her anchor. It's genuine *because* it's so stilted.
 
**jhxcb** (9): Nice, slow song. Very well done.
 
**skargardin** (9): This is honestly a perfect way to end the album with, deeply emotional and personal, no added gimmicks.
 
**Glennishill** (8.5): It's a great anchor for this album and reminds me a lot of By the Grace of God, which was similarly an emotional anchor for the album, ending it on an earnest hopeful note.
 
**angusaditus** (8): ok https://i.imgur.com/Uqy777r.gif
 
**crowlily** (7.7): I like how this starts! I actually like this quite a lot which surprises me
 
**camerinian** (7): Honestly, after having a burst of energy with Pendulum, I don‚Äôt actually mind this ballad as a closer. Wow, funny what actual good album sequencing will do to a track
 
**CarlieScion** (7): A good closer
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (7): I don‚Äôt see myself revisiting this, but I really do like the sound here. And the ‚Äúintimacy‚Äù moment was cute.
 
**Mudkip1** (7): pretty but it doesn't need to be so long
 
**quaerex** (7): It‚Äôs a little boring but again, there‚Äôs emotion in her voice. Honestly, at this point, Katy is doing breakup ballads better than Taylor. What a yikes.
 
**SkyBlade79** (7): bad lyrics but still good
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A bit deflating for a closer, but it‚Äôs nice! I actually like a lot of the ballads on this album tbh.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): nice enough
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): I like that Katy ends her (standard) albums with piano ballads, but this one is probably the most boring compared to "By the Grace of God" and "Not Like the Movies."
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): shows signs of what could have been
 
**leviswift13** (6): Pendulum should've ended the record.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (6): It grabbed my right lung this time
 
**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Why does this song sound like it's from a Disney movie? Also this "Into Me You See" = intimacy business‚Ä¶"If U Seek Amy" remains stable
 
**stardustanddinos** (5.5): It rises and rises and then you‚Äôre hit with the clunky ass chorus.
 
**ComeOnAndSLANG** (5): oof what a big snoozefest

**izeasklapaucius** (5): Eh.
 
**MrSwearword** (5): love me, hate me/say what you want about me/but all of the boys and all of the girls/are beggin' to Into Me You See
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): thanks but no thanks.
 
**nooodisaster** (5): Let's just listen to "I Think I'm Ready" instead, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flFh0R0gRhY
 
**theNealCutter** (5): I just can't buy this faux-deepness.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): it was a good song until the chorus. ugh katyyy honey dont please
 
**awryj** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHROHJlU_Ng
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (4): weak ending for a WEAK album
 
**dwarfgourami** (4): a cringeworthy closer for a cringeworthy album
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): Katy naming this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Maspo1z34
 
**letsallpoo** (4): yet katy i get it the title sounds like "intimacy" it's just not that clever. i hope someone linked that "my mind it amazes me sometimes" video because im too lazy to

[here you go fatty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHzswPLvikE) - mudkip
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): why
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (3): Boring
 
**cyborglilith** (3): troye sivan
 
**dirdbub** (3): I guess?
 
**kappyko** (3): What a bad ending oml

**TragicKingdom1** (3): If the second half of Prism was released as a standalone project with this on it then even then would it be considered filler.
 
**twat\_brained** (3): It's almost 1 AM so this'll be great to fall asleep to. Also tHIS IS THE OPEN SESAME SONG I LIVE
 
**Elitefourbrad** (2): boring end to this flop album
 
**enecks** (2): I see what you did there and now I don't want to see any more.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (2): lol delete this pls
 
**specfagular** (2): Really don‚Äôt like this song, sorry ladies.
 
**SupremeShani** (2): What a beautifully boring song. She doesn't really explore the importance or impact of letting her walls down, and the intimacy wordplay in the chorus is clunky as well.
 
**topesmachine** (2): was this song written by yoda omg

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): this is so lazy
 
**SpanKKy1** (1): id rather be blind
 
**chipsi1** (0): lmao
 
**jimmy345960** (0): More like shitness amiright? no but actually this is boring and the play on words is so bad that it makes me want to throw up. Thanks
 
**zamomattel** (0): literally so boring

##https://i.makeagif.com/media/3-09-2015/w6tSjL.gif

**hikkaru** (0): ‚Äúopen sesame‚Äù sends me lightyears away from this song and glues my wig firmly onto my scalp, and otherwise this song is just boring

**joshually** (1): "o-pen se-sa-me" DIDN'T WORK WHEN I TRIED THIS LINE THE OTHER NIGHT ÔÅå

**thetimidmartian** (2): without open sesame this song is the most generic, sugary, vacuous ballad she's ever attempted, but its salvaged by her vocals, with that gorgeous vibrato on the bridge. but open sesame is there, and this song is no longer salvageable.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): The melody is quite lovely and she really is selling it vocally... the pre-chorus lyrics are even good... but I just can't handle "open sesame" and the "intimacy" pun. The chorus is too cringey to listen to.

**sletrab07** (3): Open sesame, here's my 3.

**camirose** (3): Any chance of me being moved by this song was ruined when she softly murmured ‚Äúopen sesame.‚Äù It had the makings to be pretty beautiful, though.

**robbiec\_** (4.3): this reminds me of the slow songs on Teenage Dream but isn't nearly as well written and her voice is really emotive here but completely wasted O P E N S E S A M E

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I don't know, on some days I legitimately find this heart-wrenching and then the 'OPEENNN SESAMMEEE' ruins everything. It just makes me think of Katy returning to Sesame Street and singing this to Elmo.

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): I actually don‚Äôt know what to do with this. Open Sesame is legitimately a bad enough lyric to send this song to the void but the other lyrics (especially the lead in to the chorus) as well as the softer production are actually pretty nice. 5 it is!

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Katy sounds great but the some lyrics are cringe with the ‚Äòopen sesame‚Äô and ‚Äòinto me to you -> intimacy‚Äô. But there are good lyrics too so I don‚Äôt know why these choices were made. It‚Äôs also just boring too.

**theburningundead** (5.5): open sesame

**bwc222** (5.5): bonus points for the pun; points docked for "open sesame"

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (6): Could've been much higher if not for the one line "open sesame", I don't know why those two words lower the quality so much for me, but they did.
 
**deadspiderwall** (6): open sesame lol, nice song nonetheless
 
**fourchip** (6): open sesame? really?

**natsby** (7): 'this song was good except 'open sesame' - cliche but it's so true.

**followingfreeways** (7): I really like this song but her saying open sesame drops it down from a 9 to a 7 and im not even sorry about it
 
**melodyllic\_** (7): katy sweetie you were doing great until you tried to fucking open sesame

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7.5): this song is actually fairly pretty then gets ruined by saying "open sesame"
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): A sweet, intimate closer to the album. The "open sesame" line is a little cheesy, but I like the song.

**VeganSquash** (9): the only really good ballad on the album, the open sesame part should've never been included though

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Raw & beautiful. I'll concede "open sesame" isn't great, but otherwise, I love the lyrics here, especially the wordplay with the title.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If there is one thing Katy is good at, it's closing her albums. This is a beautiful song to close the album and it answered the opener song's question, "Will you be my witness?". It seems like Katy finally found that witness, hence the title. I can't deny the "Open sesame" lyric in the chorus is pretty funny though.

I looove how you said this /u/Albert_Cole ! I live for Katy Perry lyrics *because* they're uniquely Katy.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (11): wig honestly, this is the best song on the album https://i.redd.it/k1cay8gv17xz.jpg
 
**FranklyTheTurtle** (11): fuck it I don't even care this song is fun as fuck. "Here's a toast to my real friends They don't care about that he said, she said" is a very problematic bar but a bar nonetheless
 
**SpanKKy1** (11): needs to be a single
 
**acedino** (10): Petty Taylor is my favourite Taylor
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): P E T T Y and im living for it mama!!! also perfect production, and that "m-m, if only you werent so shady" line yassss
 
[](#twigs)

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Boi I'm dying from all these sassiness and pettiness.
 
**specfagular** (10): Fuck all y‚Äôall I love this song pt. 2
 
**static\_int\_husp** (10): favorite song on the album. It's just fun. Somehow still going to go out on day 1, though.
 
**VeganSquash** (10): I am here for bitchy Taylor
 
**zamomattel** (10): can we just imagine the video for this
 
**followingfreeways** (9.5): that's it, y'all. this is the song I'm gonna scream every time someone is a bitch to me for the rest of my life. catch me being 85 and screaming the words to this song
 
[](#twigs)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A way better diss song than LWYMMD. At least this song embraces its campy side a lot more. And that laugh from Taylor? Iconic.
 
**joshually** (9): It's an annoying song, but I think that's her point. The entirety of REPO‚Ä¢TA‚Ä¢TO is TS painting herself as the villain seeking salvation. With this song, she's basically Mona from Pretty Little Liars aka she is an evil genius.
 
**m4ttycool** (9): Yes, I like this. Fight me
 
**melodyllic\_** (9): fun, teasing and nonchalant. couldnt care less about the feud but the song's nice as a soundtrack to my dreams in which i taunt my fake imaginary friends
 
**natsby** (9): this is the pettiest song Taylor Swift song ever, which considering her body of work, is saying something. I love how well and shamelessly it embodies this the whole way through, although I am firmly in the 'that cackle felt fake' camp.
 
**Raykel** (9): This album is at its best when it's not taking itself seriously (like Gorgeous and unlike End Game). I'm having fun when Taylor is.
 
**rickikardashian** (9): I feel like people took this a little bit too seriously, idk, for me this is all tongue in cheek, although you can tell there‚Äôs still some real feelings in it.
 
**robbiec\_** (9): but if she releases this in a few months to bring up the Kanye thing I'll be embarrassed for her.
 
**jimmy345960** (8.8): I kinda love how she used a meme as the title for how childish the media and her enemies were. Our petty queen deserves to win this rate.
 
**leviswift13** (8.8): I legit choked when I first heard the bridge. This song adds some needed fun!
 
**fourchip** (8.5): she low-key doesn‚Äôt pull it off well enough for it to be believable, funny satire and the verses are boring but it adds a lot of character to the album
 
**theburningundead** (8.5): I shouldn't like this as much as I do but it's just too catchy
 
**topesmachine** (8.5): bad lyrics but a bop, seems to be a theme on this album
 
[](#twigs)

**CarlieScion** (8): I love the theatrical feel to this
 
**crowlily** (8): I love how fun this song is! damn
 
**Elitefourbrad** (8): Annie is shaking!
 
**poppinmmolly** (8): petty but an absolute bop
 
**skargardin** (8): It‚Äôs fun and the childish nature of the song is wholly understandable but I find the verses a bit grating all the same. The bridge is also a guilty pleasure for me.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): cackle
 
**vayyiqra** (8): bop with bad lyrics
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (7.6): this is the song that got me into reputation and i greatly enjoy it and i think its fun to sing it at the top of your lungs
 
**MashLuke** (7.5): you call it a meme, I call it good filler
 
**therokinrolla** (7.5): lol
 
**jhxcb** (7.1): I'm really conflicted on this song. It is super unique, especially to Taylor and the rest of this album, yet it still fits, which is pretty hard to do. But there's so much talking and not a lot of singing. That's been a big problem with Reputation. I like Taylor's singing and while it isn't totally absent, it's not around much.
 
[](#twigs)

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Wow, a catchy song on a pop album??!?! Finally something other than LWYMMD that's memorable.
 
**jonnl2806** (7): Easily a better, more fun version of LWYMMD, though I‚Äôm not sure it would have made for an as impactful lead single.
 
**Piccprincess** (7): I miss Taylor
 
**theNealCutter** (7): as petty this song is, I can't ignore how infectious the melody is.
 
**vhqv1997** (7): This would have had a way lower score had it not been for the meme potential
 
**Marshynarsh** (6.5): such a stupid song but also incredibly fun
 
**Mudkip1** (6.5): sounds insanely dated but i enjoy it more than i did first listen
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): Sure, the song is kinda fun and that laugh is iconic. However, the placement of this on the album really hurts it. Like, we're STILL on this petty drama? https://i.imgur.com/jABmAQI.gif

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): I want to like this. I really do but ultimately I‚Äôve come down on the side that this is petty, yes, but it‚Äôs not even cute petty and I just feel annoyed listening to this song. And then I listen to this song again and all of a sudden I‚Äôm living for it. Rinse and repeatX100, so ultimately it ends up with an average ranking
 
**SupremeShani** (6): I can't help but love how absolutely ridiculous and childish this song is.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (6): I know what she's going for but it isn't as catchy as WANEGBT
 
**stardustanddinos** (5.5): I hope this song was sarcastic, and if yes, then damn I love how petty it is. The bridge is I C O N I Q U E.
 
[](#twigs)

**banananaise** (5): was really tempted to give this my first ever zero but i restrained myself
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (5): Embarassing taylor cmon
 
**ComeOnAndSLANG** (5): catchy but eh
 
**MrSwearword** (5): normally, her being this white girl wasted would work against her but because this album sucks at large, I'm being very nice with this score.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this was almost good until the chorus
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Drama aside (is that even possible here?), this song is just really messy. Not a big fan of the chorus at all, and I think it‚Äôs jutted so awkwardly into the tracklist, coming before some of the most beautiful songs Taylor‚Äôs ever done, and after a sultry sex bop. I just don‚Äôt know why this is here, and it‚Äôs just in your face with all aspects of the production and the lyricism. Overall, a mess. Just a mess.
 
[](#twigs)

**awryj** (4): "And here's to my momma / Had to listen to all this drama" she also had to listen to Dress during Secret Sessions and left in shock #neverforget
 
**kappyko** (4): There's a good song lurking under all of this camp
 
[](#twigs)

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (3): This feels SO phoned in by Antonoff. Couple of good moments in here but they‚Äôre overwhelmed.
 
**fifthchevron** (3): If you just want to throw yourself around to a dumb song about kicking some moron out of your life, this song is a banger.
 
**Glennishill** (3): The backing track is very annoying here. The verses are fine but that chorus feels like a line from an off-broadway musical and I mean that in a bad way.
 
**JackLebowski** (3): That's what I said when I heard Look What You Made Me Do
 
**dirdbub** (2.5): I know this is purposefully an extremely childish song but I still hate it anyways and this is the song I transcribed on Genius too
 
**kromosol** (2.1): Who wrote this song? A toddler ?
 
[](#twigs)

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (2): Taylor. You are trying wayyyyyyyy too hard.
 
**cyborglilith** (2): Fun production, but this never should have been on any album.
 
**camerinian** (1.5): what the actual fuck is this track doing here, the second half of this album was done with catty bullshit this is such a mood whiplash how did this get past everyone

deleted: ##This is literally the comments for just the 0s and 1s

**enecks** (1): When did Taylor Swift get so bad at playing the heel? In Blank Space she nailed the sarcastic criticism of media bullshit about her, but here she's a mix of a Mean Girl from Mean Girls 2, Becky, and that one person who thinks that Runaway is a garbage song and will get mad whenever people praise Kanye. There are so many moments in this song that make my skin crawl - when she says shady, the bridge to the chorus when it sounds like what a bad cartoon would use for a sentimental scene, the blaspheming of Kanye's magnum opus. Kanye included people in the toast while acknowledging his faults. Taylor uses it for a fake laugh and drama.
 
**gannade** (1): condescending and pretentious. it sounds like a parody, but the sad thing is i think taylor is 100% serious.
 
**MissyBee37** (1): If LWYMMD is a master class in how to be obnoxious, this is it's bratty, wannabe, middle-school-aged sister. The immaturity level is cranked up to a deafening maximum. LWYMMD is worse mainly because this one just isn't grown-up enough to be that bad. It's almost cute how bad it is. Almost.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): No. just no.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): As if this wasn't cringy enough already she just had to add the straight face line, ugh this is awful. Goodbye.
 
**OriginalKappa** (1): ha ha i cant even say it with a straight face
 
**quaerex** (1): The unbearable pettiness of this makes it impossible to listen to without cringing. Better than Revenge > this
 
**SkyBlade79** (1): this is total trash I‚Äôm still screaming about how immature this is. If I still gave 0s this would be it
 
**thetimidmartian** (1): juvenile and nonsensical, she sounds like a demented baby imitating a babysitter. there are better ways of making fun of immaturity than sounding like you have no idea how to write a song.
 
**twat\_brained** (1): This is directed at Katy, right? Honestly, this makes me think of Katy in a better light than Taylor. That "BAAAAAABY" line is grating and "I can't even say that with a straight face" is more unlistenable in the context of this album than "'cause she's dead". After hearing this, "Look What You Made Me Do" is no longer in contention for my 0.
 
**agentofscranton** (0): ffs taylor
 
**Albert\_Cole** (0): Taylor is good at being a pantomime villain (eg Blank Space, I Did Something Bad). Taylor is good at being the wronged underdog (Mean, Picture to Burn). Taylor is **not** good at whatever this mess is. When I first downloaded a copy of the album, this wasn't on it - I assumed that was an accident, but it's posible the uploader just wanted to spare everyone the agony. My life would be better if I had never heard this song. This makes Bad Blood sound like a Shakespearean sonnet set to an Elgar symphony. This makes Look What You Made Me Do sound like a letter written by Oscar Wilde and edited by George Bernard Shaw. Sodium and chlorine are individually very harmful but combine to make something (table salt) that is extraordinarily good - Jack Antonoff and Taylor Swift are the inverse of this phenomenon. This song should be covered by the NHS. This song should be banned by the UN. I can only assume that the real reason Getaway Car is so good is because Taylor and Jack realised they needed to atone for the heinous act of releasing this tone-deaf, self-awareness-lacking, nuance-blind, tasteless, brain-crushing, first-draft-unworthy garbage. I put more effort into this comment than Taylor put into the lyrics of this song. This song is, in fact, the actual reason why we can't have nice things. I didn't like it very much.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (0): this song almost made me call apple to try and negotiate returning the album to itunes
 
**DraculaWeekend** (0): This song is so immature
 
**DrunkHurricane** (0): how is Taylor going to play the victim when there is absolute proof that Kanye was being nice to her and she was the one who stabbed him in the back? Also this song sounds like ass.
 
**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (0): hey guys nothing is my fault
 
**ignitethephoenix** (0): This song sounds like it was written by a 13 year old and it‚Äôs wow so bad and annoying. Taylor thinks she‚Äôs being the victim here but she just sounds like a mean girl who thinks she better than everyone else (even if this was the point of the song to sound like this, it still sounds bad)
 
**ImADudeDuh** (0): Holy fuck that laugh was the worst thing my ears have had the mispleasure of hearing.
 
**itsboogiepanda** (0): Absolute garbage. Trash. Rubbish. Skip this song every listen through of Reputation except the first time. Can't believe you made me sit through 3:27 of utter shit again.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Wow, I was originally going to give a pity score to it because I found the campiness entertaining, but now I can only laugh at the bridge. The rest of the song is filled with horrible production choices. What is the sound at the beginning of the second verse? It sounds like hell. And I don't care about the Annie references, Taylor; nothing can justify that mess of a chorus. You can call Reputation a disaster, but disasters are somewhat enjoyable if they happen to be entertaining. This is not entertainment. This is despair. This is destruction. This is torture.
 
**sletrab07** (0): Oh god, why Taylor, why did you make this chorus a schoolyard chant? You sound like a college TA who treats the 19 y.o. students like they're in first grade. God, that's a vivid evocation.
 
**strawberryswing1** (0): Honestly Taylor and all Swifties should be embarrassed by this sorry excuse for a song. Whenever someone calls Reputation an amazing album I have to raise my eyebrow at their lack of taste because no album with a song this awful can be great by default. Also, fuck off Taylor, apologize to Kanye.
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): A pretty hilarious last-ditch attempt to steal the narrative back from Kanye and Kim, both of whom have clearly moved on from the whole situation. The entire second verse is just a baffling attempt at spin that falls apart if you have even minor context of the situation. Claiming you were backstabbed and tricked after being exposed as a liar is right out of the Regina George playbook. I can't even be mad at this, it's too pathetic. I don't think Kim and Kanye even noticed it.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (0): The only thing I wanted out of this album was Taylor to show an ounce of self-reflection. But instead she decides to double down in the most obnoxious way possible. This is unlistenable garbage, and I truly believe it's in the same tier as songs like Gummo by 6ix9ine in terms of quality.
 
**VodkaInsipido** (0): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EOSgjpS2k0
 
**whatareblackhole** (0): This song is the antithesis of Delicate. I would venture to say that Delicate is her most mature and well-written song. This completely destroys that. UGH, TAYLOR, WHY?

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.9): The last fuck you. This song is perfectly placed; after Taylor getting all of her angst out at the beginning and mellowing down for the past couple of tracks, its nice of her to return to the original image of the album. People will call this song bad but I dont care. It's fun and I like to sing it thinking about everyone who has annoyed me in the littlest of ways (yes I know its petty and dramatic but thats kinda the point). The ‚ÄúWHOO‚Äù into the verses is awesome, its really the little touches that makes me love this song. The bridge is for sure the highlight, I especially love the wedding-esque music at the last line. The double chorus at the end is also great as always.

YOU CAN'T STOP ME!!! IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE ME, I'LL TAKE ALL YOUR TOYS!!!! RARRRR!!!"

LMAO we love a controversial song. I was worried that the music video was going to raise the average of this song by a significant amount but from the looks of it she got the score she deserved. Taylor‚Äôs once again blaming everyone but herself, which makes me wanna vomit. Oh, and the ‚Äòdrama drama, all i think about is karma‚Äô lyric is quite possibly the worst thing I‚Äôve ever heard?????? The rest of the song is fun, though. I could see my skinny white ass twerking to it at a club ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó

##look at the impact she left on us homosexuals

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): ok ok ok ok before yall curse me out as the nina bonina of the sub, let me give a reason for my score. THIS IS A GREAT SONG. yeah it samples right said fred, also its petty, and the lyrics kind of suck, and its just not good. but come oooon tell me that no one was shooketh to the square the first time listening to this song. this not only snatched my wigs but also stole my organs, the love of my life, and scalped my first born child too. this song is my guilty pleasure and i feel obligated to give it a 10. i just really love it, and after Green Light this was my second most listened song. I literally can't give this anything less than 10, sorry.
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): https://i.redd.it/zkqajb54pawz.png i think y'all don't get it, the thing is that a 28 year old woman made a song half rappping look what you made me do over the beat of i'm too sexy and people were mad about it and wrote thinkpieces about is the best thing that has ever happened, talk about overreacting not trying to shade katy but she spent so much money on promo and taylor only had to half rap over the beat of i'm too sexy to reach number one, that's genius
 
**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Fight me.
 
**deadspiderwall** (10): I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? CAUSE SHE'S DEAD
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): It's so hard to tell whether I like this song or not. Objectively, it's bad with its anticlimatic chorus and just the general vibe of this song is so offputting. But the Swifite in me and the campy bitchy in me loves the shit out of this song. It's no denying that both of those sides in me agree there should have been a better chorus. I gave the song an "ironic" 10 just because the song is going out on Day 1 anyway lol. If this manages to survive on Day 2 (which I highly doubt it), blame it on me.
 
**jhxcb** (10): Come at me. This song is good. Very good choice for a lead single. Very different. I love the delivery of the chorus. It also doesn't specifically call anyone out (like other songs), and I like that.
 
**joshually** (10): You saved Mariah's record Taylor. TBH this is probably the ONLY reason I became a TS fan w/ REPO‚Ä¢TA‚Ä¢TO's release lol but lesbiclear, I love this song and I think the video is pretty great.
 
**MashLuke** (10): Listen to me, this song is a big, fat, bop. The instrumental is cool af and the first time I heard it I was impressed. The lyrics could be better I guess but some lines are pretty neat and I love this kind of mainstream dark pop. Just let your inner badass child be.
 
**natsby** (10): please don't kill me I genuinely love this song and wish reputation were full of tracks like this. the lyric video is SO HYPNOTIC and that feeling of 'omg this is taylor swift i can't believe this is reality' that struck the first time I listened to it was just incredible.
 
**VeganSquash** (10): this is one of my favorite Taylor Swift songs, fight me. It is super campy and pretentiously bitchy, but it works well.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): controversy! drama! a decent bridge unlike fan favorite IDSB!
 
**fourchip** (9.5): it‚Äôs fucking catchy y‚Äôall idc
 
**leviswift13** (9.3): I WILL STAND BY THIS SCORE. LYMMD IS UNDERRATED, BRILLIANT AND ICONIC AND I WILL NOT LIVE FOR ANY SLANDER.
 
**Damoojo** (9): This is a bop and I'll die on this hill defending it
 
**Raykel** (9): Guilty pleasure but omg it's just too powerful. It makes me want to destroy all my enemies despite me not having any. Like this can destroy ISIS.
 
**rickikardashian** (9): I HAVE TRASH TASTE AND I LIKED THIS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, FIGHT ME. I KNOW THIS IS TRASHY, I STILL LOVE IT, FUCK YOU
 
**SpanKKy1** (9): awww u guys made me ink
 
**specfagular** (9): Fuck all y‚Äôall I love this song
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): okay this is going to tank in the rate but i still slutdrop to this fight me
 
**TheStarSquad** (9): the music video? On another level, literally. No music video has or ever will come close to the pure shock factor of LWYMMD. The self-awareness, the insane budget, the imagery, all the iconic looks!! I am still screaming about how legendary this video is, and it definitely did a lot to bump the song up in my books. Good job Joseph Kahn.
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): Unlike everyone else, I really like this song. The beginning is like a creepy circus full of clowns, and then the full beat/production comes in, setting up a delicious ominous tone. There are a lot of lines that are so satisfying to sing along to ("maybe I got mine but you'll all. get. yours!", "honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time"). And it's got this strange mix of childish lyrics and lyrics that are actually good, like the verse starting with kingdom keys which has an amazing rhythm and imagery to it. I still wish for a less flat chorus, but even the chorus has grown on me. It fits the tone of the song.
 
**jimmy345960** (8.7): Who is ready for my shitty pop analysis. This song is satirical in the same vein as Blank Space. This time she is attacking the playing the victim reputation she has acquired. The verses are her playing the victim. The pre-chorus is her becoming a god-like figure, like Jesus or Santa Claus. Then the chorus is the "real" Taylor. The villain. How do you combine the three? Playing the victim to strangers, being incredibly selfish and hurting the ones closest to you? Killing yourself. Don't come for my shitty pop analysis or me thanks guys.
 
**poppinmmolly** (8.5): a bop. plain and simple.
 
**SkyBlade79** (8.5): I actually do like this a lot‚Ä¶ the production is amazing and though cringy at times, it‚Äôs a good song
 
**zamomattel** (8.5): epic af but that chorus girl come on
 
**hikkaru** (8): me when y‚Äôall put this at the bottom of the rate: i don‚Äôt like your little games
 
**therokinrolla** (8): i feel like everyone else's assays will say the same things i want to say so i won't leave too long a comment. This is one bad song. This is filler on the album its a lead single too. But i can't help but love the song with all the hype that surrounded it, with all the thinkpieces, and the fact that it bops hard. Okay, now go read the assays
 
**vayyiqra** (8): cheesy and repetitive but fun
 
**vhqv1997** (8): I kinda like this song unironically
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): ‚Ä¶I never thought I'd rate this so high, but‚Ä¶what an iconic, messy bop‚Ä¶that sounds quite a bit like The Louvre‚Ä¶
 
**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): So I'm probably the hundredth person to say this, but this song would be way better if the chorus was something else. I really like the verses and build up but the chorus ruins that anticipation. Still a good song though.
 
**crowlily** (7.5): I loved it upon first listen, thought it was meh for a while and now it grew back on me.
 
**cyborglilith** (7.5): Omg I was so shook when I watched the music video premiere (zombie stuff), and the song is definitely better when you‚Äôre watching it. The lyrics are simple, probably what she intended. It‚Äôs such a departure from her previous songs; she deserves some credit for releasing this as the lead.
 
**itsboogiepanda** (7.5): Grower just like me. The song subject and subsequently the lyrics are somewhat shit, but I really like the production. The song will probably age badly, but for the moment it's still okay.
 
**Piccprincess** (7.5): ngl I always twerk my ass off to this
 
**swadadu** (7.5): The production deserves better lyrics.

deleted: ##we could write a book with just these comments

**camirose** (7): I actually really like this song, but I‚Äôm trying to keep my scores relative to the rest of the songs on the album so it doesn‚Äôt get too inflated.
 
**ComeOnAndSLANG** (7): overhated on bop. cringe lyrics at parts but man it's catchy
 
**dropthehammer11** (7): Okay I have a weird relationship with this song. I found it very mediocre and lame when I first heard it, but overtime, it definitely grew on me. The verse and chorus are super catchy, the lines are catty but fun....I think it's safe to say I like this thing.
 
**Glennishill** (7): This is about as good as it gets on this album. I hate a lot about this song and it has a lot of bad moments, that phone call in particular, but I at least know the lyrics to this song.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Really hope there arent that many thinkpieces on this song.
 
**melodyllic\_** (7): the petty princess of pop has finally reached her petulant peak
 
**Mudkip1** (7): i don't hate it lol it actually grew on me pretty quickly but i really, really don't like the 'The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma' part.
 
**awryj** (6.8): i wonder how many isnt its there are going to be in the comments for delicate, i hope a lot cause thats such a funny meme lol
 
**skargardin** (6.5): I get the appeal of the chorus but to me, it ruins an otherwise perfectly good, sassy comeback single. It‚Äôs just lazy. But as a lead single, it makes perfect sense, but otherwise not so much.
 
**robbiec\_** (6.3): who the fuck thought interpolating Right Said Fred was a good idea. anyway everyone actually loves this song facts. Also the video is iconic
 
**Albert\_Cole** (6): I actually kind of like the production, but I cannot in good conscience give this a higher score. The lyrics are probably the worst of Taylor's career, and the sample turns it into a joke that takes itself too seriously.
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (6): This track and I are in the ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù phase: I know it‚Äôs trash, and I know I‚Äôm trash for starting to like it. I have no further comment at this time.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (6): Could‚Äôve been close to a 10 without the Too Sexy For My Shirt cover and cringey spoken word section. Should not have been the first single but ah well the music video is good at least.
 
**kappyko** (6): "uhm taylor you're not my friend anymore" "oh my gosh u r such a butt head how frking dare you" [20 years later] "look what you made me do coming out this august 24th"
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): Hot trash. This is literal trash. Though Taylor is really smart for releasing this as the lead. Why? To encourage hype. The song is basically built-up on a pre-chorus that goes stagnant when it finally reaches the title-repititive-ridden hook. It‚Äôs catchy and it got people talking. We were simply played without us knowing.
 
**NapsAndNetflix** (6): we love a song out day 1
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (6): I just realized Spaceship is still playing on Spotify
 
**stardustanddinos** (5.5): I get what you‚Äôre doing here Taylor, but the song didn‚Äôt have to be as bad as it is. The chorus just doesn‚Äôt work and the song stands only because of its masterpiece of a music video, and I would‚Äôve given it a lower score otherwise.
 
**agentofscranton** (5): pre-video release this would've been a 1, maybe even my 0 for the rate, all that hype for a mediocre song that showed no sense of her learning from her actions and even trying to be a better person from it - but the satirical nature of the 10/10 video explained the otherwise bitchy song, still isn't good tho
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (5): Ugh, what a terrible lead single
 
**DraculaWeekend** (5): If the entire song sounded like the prechorus it would be soooo much better.
 
**followingfreeways** (5): great lead single because of the shock value, but compared to the masterpiece that is the rest of the album, this song LACKS and I always skip it
 
**jonnl2806** (5): So when the first time I heard it I hated it. Then the music video came out and I finally got the song. Without the video though the song is pretty bad.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Oh, boy! Time for the discourse, Popheads! This was the only song I reviewed for the Jukebox (I actually hate that review now, I inserted pretentious theatre references for no reason). I gave it a four. Now, I'll give it a slightly higher score. This is not a good song, at all, but Taylor was going for controversy jere, and while I think there were better options she certainly succeeds in it. Some parts of the production are legitimately good, and after a certain person *cough* Melanie *cough* dethroned this as the worst diss track of 2017, it's certainly more tolerable, especially if you regard the music video and see the lyrics as satirical.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): too sexy for my shirt
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): I really want to like this song... but the chorus is so awful
 
**topesmachine** (5): I'm so conflicted about this song. I want to give it a zero or a 10 so i'm just going with a five... like parts of this song are so good separately and other parts are really bad separately, it just doesn't go together AT ALL but it still kinda bops?? i have no idea with this damn song
 
**VodkaInsipido** (5): this is still not very good but some parts are actually amazing and the chorus collapsing was one of the best ideas of any pop song of 2017 so there it goes tay
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 
**ignitethephoenix** (4): The pre chorus is fantastic however then than dumb ass chorus comes in and ruins it. And the verses are way too whispery, which is not something that Taylor can pull off. However the video was iconic and the memes were good too, so I can‚Äôt give this a completely shitty score.
 
**nooodisaster** (4): Switch the bridge of this to I Did Something Bad for the meme sales, make that the lead single, and then delete this song from the album.
 
**tevinterimperium** (4): The bridge really does save this song from being a 1
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (3): No the song isn't ruined by the chorus. The song is ruined by the clumsy lyrics (Saying I don't like you doesn't count as a burn taylor). it is ruined by the weird, clappy arena electo rock circa 2009 mine craft tutorial instrumentation. And it needs a bass.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (3): Flashy lead single, but in reality is a bad song. Like, really bad.
 
**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (3): salvaged for me when i went to the poppy concert and it was mashed up with toxic
 
**kromosol** (3): I loathe this song. It's a shame that this song is the biggest hit of Reputation ...
 
**m4ttycool** (3): I know all the lyrics to this song but I hate it please help me
 
**milkywayinradius** (3): Can‚Äôt get over the chorus, I wanted her to sing out her hate with something strong and was disappointed
 
**strawberryswing1** (3): Honestly this could've been a great song but the production, mixing, and Taylor's dead line make it borderline garbage. The last chorus is . Also, WHAT IS THAT NOISE AT 2:06 AND 3:08 IT'S AWFUL.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6ycwn8/the_popheads_jukebox_week_30/dmmfas6/
 
**xCaseyKill10** (3): Just a terrible song overall with a repetitive chorus.
 
**dirdbub** (2.5): my opinion switches on this song so goddamn much. this listen is in fact a bad listen so it gets a bad score
 
**CarlieScion** (2): The video is awesome, the song is annoying
 
**Marshynarsh** (2): Since hearing this once I have never made the whole way through it
 
**SupremeShani** (2): I thought I changed my opinion on this song, but I listened to it again.
 
**twat\_brained** (2): "You did a thing A real bad thing Some kind of thing; I'm not going to explain But trust me it was bad So, I decided to turn evil" 6 months after its original release this is officially my SBIG (so bad it's good) anthem. If this song makes it past day one my trust in this sub will greatly diminish.

deleted: ##I went on a date with Taylor Swift before she got super famous. It was right out of high school, when she was making a name for herself, but not yet a gigantic deal. I knew her because we lived near each other. It was the craziest thing, really, I only asked her out on a dare because even not famous, she was way out of my league. But it turns out she was really nice and enjoyed the opportunity to go hang out for a while (she always had a reputation as a girl who burns the candle at both ends, and she's always stressed, so I think she just wanted to relax). It was a pretty basic "just out of high school" date. We went to see a movie and I got to feel like a jackass rolling up to her super nice house in my POS datsun honeybee. Don't let her early work fool you, she's a rich kid.

##Anyway, on to the crap you guys are actually wanting to hear about. So, after the movie and some dinner, we go back to my place to listen to some music. After a while, she pretends to be interested in checking out the hiking trails out behind my house. She said she really enjoys being out in the woods, but I figured she just wanted to be away from my parents. So we get out into the woods and very quickly get into some heavy making out. Clothes go everywhere, and that's when this story starts to take its turn.

##Gentlemen, I have some things to tell you about Taylor Swift. First thing: turns out she loves giving head.

**izeasklapaucius** (1.5): At least the pre-chorus and bridge is listenable.
 
**camerinian** (1): Well, the album at least got on to a whole 1-song streak of being good, it couldn‚Äôt last forever.
 
**enecks** (1): This song is one of the biggest cultural trainwrecks of our time. I can't remember the last time a track this hyped was this garbage. Appropriately, this song is an ouroboros of Taylor becoming so obsessed with her narrative and reputation through so many layers of irony that she forgot to make a good song. I can see moments of effort - the bridges would be great buildup to a chorus that was better than My Humps, but no you had to sample Right Said Fred. Hell, Right Said Fred might be too sophisticated for Taylor - at least they have a vague understanding of what sexiness is that eludes Taylor's crotch-thrusting antics in the video. This eludes a 0 from me because it's so FASCINATING - every decision on this song is so baffling and unpredictably garbage that I wonder what the fuck happened? What did we make Taylor do? I'm not even sure.
 
**JackLebowski** (1): When the best part of a song is taking the beat from "Too Sexy For My Shirt" you know it's gonna be bad.
 
**sletrab07** (1): Sheer awfulness. Basic-ass production with a music beginners' melody. It singlehandedly called Taylor's entire songwriting prowess into question.
 
**theNealCutter** (1): it'd be super easy to give this my zero, but I won't do that. I'm tired of explaining why I don't like this song. All I know is that it's underwritten, underproduced, but ironically overwrought and overdeveloped. Jack Antonoff said this is camp and should not be taken seriously, but the thing is, when the performer itself fails at doing so, it's hard for the listener to do the same thing.
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): I hated this song when it came out, didn't see anything redeemable about it. It hasn't really gone up in opinion since then. I guess the one thing I can give credit for is that it is a legitimate experimentation at least by Taylor Swift standards, and sounded different from anything else she had made. That said, experiments don't always work, and nothing about this song works. It feels like an attempt to fire back at Kanye, Kim, the media, whoever else, but Taylor has so little ammo and has to keep things vague enough for the song to still be marketable so the lyrics have no punch at all. It tries to position Taylor as the played-up villain while still keeping her in the morally right, only doing whatever she's doing because of how badly she was treated or something. I honestly don't want to write a long analysis about this, because it would make it seem like I care more than I do. This song is terrible.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (1): Still awful! RFI is the same statement but not as obnoxious. I don't really have any other takes that haven't been covered to death other than that this should've been cut from the album.
 
**CreepyMannequin** (0): Absolute garbage
 
**fifthchevron** (0): There's not even a bassline Taylor...Taylor there's not even a bassline...
 
**MissyBee37** (0): I... I just can't with this song. I don't even like that phrase, but this song undoes me. I hate everything about it. Every. Single. Little. Thing. The attitude & message are garbage, the melody is nonexistent, the music is practically nonexistent, this industrial shit is jarring. Self-absorbed, self-indulgent, vindictive, petty mess. The height of the absurdity is definitely the phone call. As a longtime Swiftie, I can only hope for a resurrection on TS7.
 
**MrSwearword** (0): in case you missed my diatribe and my condensed diatribe, Taylor is a petty, vindictive cunt for putting this shit out. So what if Katy had your backup dancers? So what if you ended up caving into manufactured drama? Do better, bitch.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): This song...goodness. I‚Äôm gonna be straight up, this is just plain awful. The production is an absolute disaster, the song starts to build a head and it seems like it‚Äôs going somewhere and it just falls flat every single time. Taylor is completely unconvincing as a villain, and her ‚Äúembracing her snake image‚Äù does her zero favors with her reputation. Also, the ‚ÄúOld Taylor‚Äù isn‚Äôt dead. She‚Äôs still very much alive. A thin-skinned, petty, bully who‚Äôs trying way too hard.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (0): Look What You Made Her Do (ruin the era before it started and embarrass herself in the process)
 
**OriginalKappa** (0): oh my god what a mess taylor you were doing so well
 
**quaerex** (0): I am so angry with this song I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. My expectations of Taylor after the Kimye fiasco were like, zero, and she managed to underperform those meager hopes into the negatives with this satanic excuse for a ‚Äúsong.‚Äù I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs worse: the fact she interpolated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Too Sexy‚Äù with her excuse for a ‚Äúchorus‚Äù or the fact she actually released this song, to the public, believing it would be listened to unironically.
 
**thetimidmartian** (0): it starts off sounding like some sort of edgy disney soundtrack deep cut and ends up sounding like a middle schooler's hip hop audition

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (8.7): The main event, every song before leads up to it, and much like the chorus of this song it ends up being a bit of a letdown. The whole album is set up to build hype for LWYMMD but honestly (despite the high score I gave it), its one of the worst tracks on the record. However, there are many things I love about this song.

##Well why don‚Äôt you get it and he‚Äôs like


**angusaditus** (10): we love a strong independent woman https://i.imgur.com/AvHTIgE.gif
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): Katy pointed at me when i saw her live during this song. I was the only person in the front row who knew the words!
 
**VodkaInsipido** (10): i‚Äôm sorry but i love the chorus http://i.imgur.com/72lBBsG.png
 
**zamomattel** (10): but the video is trash
 
**MissyBee37** (9.9): I actually love the lyrics. The metaphors work well together to visualize her point. I'm obsessed with lines like "you fucking love it" (whispered!) and the use of "faberge." I love the vocal & melody and the way she swaggers on lines like "I'm making a mint." The bridge, though, is my fave. Fierce. My only critique? I wish it were faster!

##‚ÄùBecause it‚Äôs too much‚Äù and I‚Äôm like well how much is it

**natsby** (9): I actually love this song but I am SO ANNOYED that the last chorus doesn't get bigger. Why can't she sustain the 'it' from 'secretly you love it' into a big soaring note as the chorus kicks in again? Why can't she do some runs over the top of 'you think that I'm a little ba-a-by'?? WHY?

**tevinterimperium** (9): Complete bop disunirregardless of the bad lyrics

**thetimidmartian** (9): colorful production and lyrics, every part of the song is memorable. she has some kinks to work out in the second verse but the writing is effective, the vocals (especially the layered ad libs) are strong, the personality is undeniably there

**Albert\_Cole** (8.3): L O L at ur limits

**leviswift13** (8.1): This could've been a ten if Katy took her lyrics seriously. That it still got the score it got should say something about the chorus.

##He‚Äôs like ‚Äúit‚Äôs 15 pounds‚Äù

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Fuck all y'all this is great. I fucking love it. On a sidenote, I always thought the lyrics were "fragile like a fabric sheet."

**jhxcb** (7.6): The lyrics are a lot better than I would've expected from the title, but I think the chorus really suffers and brings the song down. It needs to smooth itself out a little bit.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Okay, the lyrics in this are kinda legendary. Katy is at her best lyrically when she's being a quirky goofball, and there's so many of those here. The production tho is very basic and kinda dated in a 2008 sounding way.

**skargardin** (7.5): The quirky lyrics (Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck; fragile like a faberg√©) makes it work, it‚Äôs honestly not a song to be taken all that seriously. It‚Äôs a shame that the chorus is so flat.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): not bad but not great

##So apparently there‚Äôs a bit of a language barrier there

**dropthehammer11** (7): The production on this is solid, I feel like the hook lacks a bit, but it's still dope

**melodyllic\_** (7): campy katy is best katy, but not this katy. wouldve been a guilty bop if not for the annoying way she sings the chorus

**MrSwearword** (7): GODDAMNIT I HATE the lyric "Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck". However, I managed to block out that atrocious music video and was able to realize that this song isn't as horrendous as I thought.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): This song is pretty variable for me: sometimes I feel like it has terrible momentum and is way too lurchy, but other times I can really appreciate its melody. Right now it's on the border of me being able to say I like it.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.9): i mean i don't hate this but the fact that it's one of the best songs on the albums tells a lot

##because I asked him how much it costs

**bwc222** (6): the music video made me appreciate this song a little more, but i still find the chorus very irritating

**gannade** (6): The verses are great, the prechorus is OK, but that Hey Hey Hey chorus and drop is atrocious.

**Glennishill** (6): This is my least favorite song on Witness. I love Katy because her lyrics are nuanced and thoughtful but this song, in particular "Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck" is so on the nose that I think my nose is broken.

**stardustanddinos** (5.5): The score is only for the instrumentals. The lyrics are alternate between funny and downright irritating, which is why I can‚Äôt vibe with this song.

##not how much it weighs

**1313Harbor** (5): What even are these lyrics? ‚ÄúMarilyn Monroe in a monster truck‚Äù is heinous.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): oh goooooooood these lines are painful, it feels like she tried to be Nicki Minaj and Lord Byron at the same time but somehow just ended up smoking some kush and writing this song. and yes even my previous metaphor is better than anything in this song. at least the beat is good and i like the hey hey hey part. it seems like im going easy on katy but yall hoes just wait for my taylor and kesha scores, i think both albums will get a 9+ avg from me lol

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): I absolutely thought this song was garbage at first because it has some of the worst lyrics I have ever heard from Katy and given this song was co-written by Sia, I want to know what made them write those lyrics. The feminst empowerment theme was executed so clumsly that it's almost a meme at this point. (DAE WITNESS IS A MEME?). But, the production is fire as fuck so at least it has some replay value cause I am trash. Even then, this is easily the worst song on the album.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i cant believe the roulette mv budget got wasted on this track

##but the thing I‚Äôm wondering is.. why does it weigh so much

**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): nice synths! but thats all

**awryj** (4): This song has a few great moments and is legitimately funny at times, but "LOL at all your limits"?... I can't

**camirose** (4): I think this is one of those songs where the lyrics are either charming or cringy and too ‚Äúquirky and random XD‚Äù for your taste.

**ignitethephoenix** (4): This song is just too on the nose for me. The lyrics really irritate me and it‚Äôs has an annoying vibe throughout it. Only good thing about the song is the production and Katy saying ‚ÄúI fucking love it‚Äù

**jonnl2806** (4): This reminds me of Dark Horse. I hate Dark Horse.

**twat\_brained** (4): I‚Ä¶ I don't get it. Katy used to be a trendSETTER. Now she's making dubstep despite the genre being long forgotten. Katy, please take some time off and rediscover yourself. Also, how is THIS song purposeful? I guess to serve the purpose that Katy has thicker skin than people think so she won't crack easily? I can't imagine anything else.

##that's what's confusing to me like

**dwarfgourami** (3): Baby isn‚Äôt a 3 syllable word

**fifthchevron** (3): I can get behind the feminist theme but overall her delivery is so annoying and childish.

**kromosol** (3): Bye Bye Bye

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (3): Marilyn Monroe is QUAKING

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): Very grating production, and the lyrics and delivery here are just as bad. The catchiness of the chorus is the one saving grace, but I'm still baffled about her choosing to release this as a single when Roulette and Pendulum exist.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): If this is what Katy Perry‚Äôs idea of writing lyrics about feminism is then call me a meninist

##does it have to do with where England is located, like

**enecks** (2): This is garbage. It's a clunky thudding mess which has lyrics that make the Emoji Movie's comments on feminism look as impacting as the Women's March.

**SupremeShani** (1.5): I'm sorry, I hate everything about this. I refuse to believe Sia had anything to do with this.

##idek is it because like maybe it‚Äôs like really close to Jupiter

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): being feminine and girly and liking "girl" things and liking pink is a totally valid choice for a woman katheryn, wanting to be saved is valid and you don't always have to be a strong woman, being weak is part of life, don't judge other women's choices, you don't always have to be your own hero sis.

**quaerex** (1): If LWYMMD didn‚Äôt exist, this would be my 0. Stop mixing metaphors, Katy.

##so like if you know the solar system America is like in the middle and um

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (0): Katy seems to think this is a serious empowerment anthem, so why do we get zero sense of what‚Äôs at stake? Why not use the chorus on something - anything - more meaningful than ‚Äúfragile like a Faberg√©‚Äù? Did I actually just hear ‚Äúkarate chopping all the clich√©s and norms, all in a dress‚Äù?? What is Max Martin doing??? What the fuck is happening????

**Itsafudgingstick** (0): Oh Katy, Katy, katy. Witness is such a rollercoaster ride. There are legitimate moments of greatness in this song, for example, the production is top tier. But these are unfortunately some of the cringiest lyrics Miss Hudson has come up with, and this is on the same album as ‚ÄúChinese Water Torture‚Äù.

**TheLastAxolotl** (0): Marilyn sweetie, I'm sorry

**vhqv1997** (0): the lyrics speak for themselves

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (5.4): The song starts off with a super interesting darker tone in the instrumentation, which unfortunately gets ruined by some questionable lyric choice. We get to a grating chorus which is equal parts annoying and catchy. The bridge brings us back to the darker tone with even some darker lyrics for once (‚ÄúI aint got no strings...‚Äù), but once again the cheesy lyrics come back around. Looking at what the song tries to do, we can see that a girl power anthem is in the works, but a lot of the lyrics are just complete misses. On the contrary to Witness, Katy knows what she wants to do going into this track but the execution is just awful.

##Big Schlong Penetrates Tight Hole

**angusaditus** (10): ha best woke pop! http://i.imgur.com/VRNrPO3.gif
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): This is the better of the two songs produced by Purity Ring. I just wish the lyrics weren‚Äôt wasted on forcing the woke-schtick. Still a mega-bop, nonetheless.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I am definitely in the minority who likes this song. I definitely agree it's a filler in the album but as a song itself, I really like the production but Purity Ring are the last people I would expect to produce something this radio friendly and Katy's vocals complements well in this song.
 
**joshually** (9): ‚ÄúSomething bigger than me, I can feel it opening‚Äù YOU GUYS THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT
 
**twat\_brained** (8.6): This one is actually pretty good. Better than I expected, even. :hmmm: Hopefully just like Swish Swish Katy makes more songs like this for her next album.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): Underrated! Some great lines and nice melody here.
 
**nooodisaster** (8): A nice mission statement that feels genuine. I can feel the momentum of Katy trying to change, even if I don't get much of the "kicking and screaming".
 
**vhqv1997** (8): Powerful song, and I think some people could relate to the message. Unfortunately, I don't really feel it
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): I'm surprised such a strong political message was attributed to this song because this reminds me of "Who Am I Living For," which had an arguably obvious Christian message to it. However it's meant to be received, I like this one!
 
**jhxcb** (7.9): The backing track really holds back on this one. I think it could be better, but the instrumentals just seem to be all wrong.
 
**leviswift13** (7.9): I appreciate what she was going for!
 
**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): I still stan Hillary
 
**MissyBee37** (7.8): I only wish Katy had leaned harder into it -- a little more specific or personal.
 
**jonnl2806** (7.5): Woke Katy Perry is back
 
**skargardin** (7.5): This one‚Äôs a bit uneven, it‚Äôs got really awkward lyrics for one.
 
**crowlily** (7.3): I like the instrumental but dislike the way she sings it... don't really like the lyrics but eh well. I like the production!
 
**banananaise** (7): the opening feels like a caribbean dance track from the mid-2000s
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): Great production, but the lyrics and Katy's poor vocals make it sound like filler.
 
**enecks** (7): You are trying so hard to be Walking on Air. Not quite there, but a cute sentiment.
 
**followingfreeways** (7): eh doesn't really stand out but isn't bad
 
**Glennishill** (7): I'm not a fan of the opening backing track on this song and I wish it had just started with Katy. I like the message of the song, even if it's not one of my favorites from the album.
 
**natsby** (7): I do like the lyrics a lot but it's not a particularly good song
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Do all these songs sound the same to anyone else?
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I don't see why this used to be tied for last. I'm not huge on it, but there are way worse songs here. The chorus is pretty full of energy.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (7): The production is slick but everything's starting to sound the same by now, including the vocal style
 
**vayyiqra** (7): meh
 
**kappyko** (6.5): This is where the 'Witness' sound gets kind of drained.
 
**strawberryswing1** (6.5): really nice production but forgettable otherwise
 
**topesmachine** (6.5): p good but nothing horribly special
 
**theNealCutter** (6): it's okay... just boring.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): This isn't outright bad but I don't think there's a single idea here that hasn't already been covered by the album.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): mediocre song. at least the title brings back the memories of Team Siren. BAITED AND OUTSMARTED. god i wouldve loved this album if it was actually a well-made album with good lyrics and a bit better production at some points
 
**CarlieScion** (5): Lol at this song coming right after Bon Appetit. The production is bad, but at least it's trying to say something
 
**MrSwearword** (5): too boring for outright derision
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): filler
 
**zamomattel** (4.5): a simplistic tune, but that robot line is so dumb
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (4.3): mariah @ everyone
 
**awryj** (4): too much cheese
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): yikes
 
**camerinian** (4): I like the stronger beat on this one to be fair, but holy shit the line about being a robot taking up oxygen is prime hater-fuel why would you do that to yourself katy
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (4): Literally WHO would want to listen to this
 
**dirdbub** (4): what
 
**Elitefourbrad** (4): wow this is boring
 
**ignitethephoenix** (4): Meh I just don‚Äôt care for this.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (4): Ho Hum, I just finished listening to this song and I can think of nothing memorable about it, good or bad.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): me before hearing this song and me after
 
**thetimidmartian** (4): it sounds a little too dated, the political themes are a little too weak and a little too idealistic.
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (2.5): Woke pop becomes broke pop. Trop pop becomes flop pop. The chorus does NOT describe my pussy after listening to this.
 
**robbiec\_** (2.5): the most filler song
 
**quaerex** (2): ‚ÄúSomething bigger than me‚Äù says about as much as JT‚Äôs latest hit ‚ÄúSay Something.‚Äù This is another woke-pop song that doesn‚Äôt fucking go anywhere. Katy has things to say. Why doesn‚Äôt she talk about reconciling Christianity in the modern era? She actually COULD talk on that.
 
**SupremeShani** (2): This song is the definition of filler to me.
 
**kromosol** (0): Honestly, obnoxious ...

##this guy gets it
 
**VeganSquash** (0): I think this song is a metaphor for taking a shit. It's opening (her anus), and its something bigger then her (her bowel movement).

=====

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (5.6): Arguably the wokest song on the record. Sonically I actually do like it, but the lyrics cause it to take a big hit. The line about turning into a robot is not only kinda ignorant, but the rhyme with ‚ÄúOxygen‚Äù is super awkward and forced. Sonically the chorus is nice as well, but again the lyrics feel a bit cringy at times. I do commend Katy for actually being explicit with the woke theme throughout the entire song, but much like some of her other songs it completely misses the make and somehow feels super forced and uninformed.

##Yeah we were dancin‚Äô

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Whoa, why is this better than every track on the original album?
 
**joshually** (10): this is my first time hearing these bonus songs. OK WHAT I LIKE THIS SONG??????
 
**angusaditus** (9): whew a jam! https://i.imgur.com/LJpFEwA.gif
 
**cyborglilith** (9): The song builds and builds suspense as it goes on, but sometimes, the transitions are awkward. It‚Äôs actually way better than I expected and totally fits on the album. It makes me feel like that bitch. As a side note, she defined sanity twice on this album, using two different definitions.
 
**MashLuke** (9): man this is great, why did she leave it in the deluxe version?
 
**skargardin** (9): I really don‚Äôt get the idea of a ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù edition of an album, why in the world would she want to exclude people from listening to these amazing tracks? I only searched these up like a month ago or so and was instantly blown away. This could easily replace one of the inferior songs on Witness like ‚ÄúHey Hey Hey‚Äù or ‚ÄúPendulum‚Äù.
 
**1313Harbor** (8.5): I can‚Äôt help but like when pop stars make dubstep tracks.
 
**awryj** (8.5): havent heard this one yet. tbh wig
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Wow I love the production on this song so much. Definitely one of the better songs, I‚Äôm surprised this didn‚Äôt make the album and was just on the special edition. There are a bunch of songs that should have been cut and replaced with this.?
 
**dirdbub** (8): wait whERE DID THIS COME FROM
 
**DraculaWeekend** (8): This has such a dark vibe, really like it
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This is a pretty nice and kind of dark-sounding track that could have and should have been on the main album. PS It should have replaced Bon App the teeth
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): beautifully produced, as per the rest of this project, it‚Äôs not that good as some people in the YouTube comments section for to be a single.
 
**SkyBlade79** (8): what an AMAZING instrumental ruined by a weak hook. This is so beyond annoying‚Ä¶ the bridge is amazing too but I just can‚Äôt with that hook
 
**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): As good as the standard tracks, not sure why this was picked for Target
 
**quaerex** (7.5): Lol, the bonus tracks are better than half the album. This is actually a song with meaning, too - if you take the devil to be either depression or alcohol, suddenly you get a fairly deep song. I got chills listening to the chorus. Oh, Katy. Should‚Äôve been on the OG album.
 
**Raykel** (7.5): She really put one of the better songs of this album on the target exclusive wow. Her team really made messy choices this era.
 
**specfagular** (7.5): She deserved better than a target exclusive
 
**jhxcb** (7.3): Like a lot of tracks on Witness, it's just not that exciting.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.1): hmmm this song is so conflicting like it's good but it's almost as if they didn't want it to be
 
**crowlily** (7): I am a little creeped out by this... just surprised. hmmm it's not as creepy as it starts out but not my cup of tea.
 
**MissyBee37** (7): "A mercurial wrestle" is a stellar lyric. The drop is not my thing, though.
 
**MrSwearword** (7): unusually ambitious for a Katy song so there's that.
 
**natsby** (7): this is actually interesting thanks katy
 
**tevinterimperium** (7): Queen of Satanism!!!!
 
**leviswift13** (6.9): Just kind of there for me.
 
**bwc222** (6.5): terrible production but these lyrics give us some of the most insight into katy behind closed doors; just shows you don't need to go country to become your most authentic self
 
**dropthehammer11** (6.5): The production and concept is really really good, but it's not executed as best as it could be
 
**Glennishill** (6.5): I like the vocals and the beat in the song but I totally get why it's a bonus track.
 
**melodyllic\_** (6.5): classic overused trap production combined with a non-melodic chorus and breakdown makes this a very unappealing song. NEXT
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): This is probably one of the two songs in this rate where I haven't heard it in full before the rate. This song had potenital to be better, given the song is produced by Felix Snow and I am quite mixed on the stuff he produces. The drop sucks ass.
 
**milkywayinradius** (6): spooky, scary production
 
**nooodisaster** (6): Lyrics are actually mature, and the drop is nice, but the whole song feels so plodding.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (6): Didn't I play this song already earlier
 
**theNealCutter** (6): listenable I guess.
 
**thetimidmartian** (6): personal and revealing, but ultimately it sounds incomplete both lyrically and structurally
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6): This goes off a tiny bit but also is too basic/loud to really get into.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): mood doesn't fit
 
**vhqv1997** (6): I know this song is about her depression, yes I get it, but I fell asleep halfway through it. It was just that boring

##FUCK U SATAN!!! Fuck right off!!!!!
 
**SupremeShani** (5.5): I don't remember this song at all. The bridge is absolutely heavenly though and I wish I could hear more of that.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): mediocre again...
 
**CarlieScion** (5): This song sounds like every other song on this album. I'm at the point where I can't tell what song I'm listening to anymore.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (5): as far as downtempo tracks on this album go, Tsunami is skinnier
 
**Elitefourbrad** (5): Wow Roman and Nicki are shook
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): I need the ballads to stop.
 
**whatareblackhole** (5): Not my fave. A rather disjointed cut when compared to the standard album tracks.
 
**stardustanddinos** (4.5): Oh lord why.
 
**camerinian** (4): so i was gonna go on a screed about how pointless it was listening to bonus tracks for this rate but then I heard act my age and I realised the point of them so I‚Äôll just say this song‚Äôs boring and full of cliches and i‚Äôll leave it there
 
**camirose** (4): Still more interesting than 75% of the original album tbh
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (4): Pretty bad filler, the pitched down vocals here just sound like 2009 party tracks in a bad way
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Man, I try to get what this track was going for, but it didn't do enough. This sounds like parts of different songs jumbled up together, and I have no idea why the production comes after the chorus-that way, it sounds like a mess. I wish this could be redone, because it really has potential.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): Got what she deserved being left off the album.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): no
 
**VeganSquash** (4): inb4 "Katy is in the Illuminati confirmed!!!!@##!@@"
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (3): Oh my god the bonus tracks are even worse than the main album
 
**fifthchevron** (3): illuminati confirmed
 
**kappyko** (3): this onme is borniog
 
**zamomattel** (3): like i get that this is important to her, but not my thing
 
**twat\_brained** (2.4): Okay, I'm lost at this point. I forget what she's comparing the "Dance" to. I suppose maybe it's when someone willingly listens to Witness and tries to make sense of it? That's all I got at this point.
 
**Mudkip1** (1): not a bop

So this song caused quite a stir! This annoys me! Gorgeous doesn‚Äôt deserve eight 0‚Äôs. I enjoy this one because it‚Äôs finally one of the more tolerable tracks on the album. So many of you wrote giant assays but jimmy‚Äôs honestly shookens me because he serves facts so i want everyone to pay attention to him and not me. I do wanna link my comment here though because it was probably the only good comment I left in this entire rate.

**Mudkip1** (9): was gonna give this a 10 but some of the production reminds me of a shoe stepping in mud. you know that sloshy squishy sound it makes when you lift your shoe out and it like partially suctions to your sole? it's kinda like that

##this song is the second coming of Christ

**jimmy345960** (11): Now listen up gays and straights alike. I‚Äôm part of the Gorgeous Defense Squad‚Ñ¢. I understand that I‚Äôm in the minority when I say that I unapologetically love this song. Now let me break down for you why. So I‚Äôm at this hangout last semester, and I‚Äôm drunk as fuck. Like I can‚Äôt see. I know I lurk on popheads more than I speak but let me tell you I can be a monster when I‚Äôm drunk. I get angry and hurtful to myself and others. So this one particular hangout, I feel like shit. Naturally, I have to pee and waddle my way over to the bathroom. I don‚Äôt why but when I looked in the mirror, I just thought I looked so ugly. It was uncalled for and there was nothing wrong with my appearance, but nothing stops those intrusive thoughts. So I start to cry. Like a full on bawling. Thinking I‚Äôm one ugly motherfucker. I don‚Äôt know why, but Gorgeous was stuck in my head. So I began to recount the song in my head. The beginning baby talk into the intro. That last note before Taylor comes in kinda reminds me of me when I‚Äôm drunk. The fucked up BLAH always makes me laugh. I sing along to the first verse in my head and I just stared at myself in the mirror. If anyone could see me at the moment I probably would‚Äôve looked like a psycho but it was making me feel better. The chorus hits. I don't know why but it just made me feel so much better. Like I stopped crying and took a leak while this song is going on in my head. Afterwards, I‚Äôm full on dancing at a party, in a disgusting college bathroom, by myself. I have never felt more alive. Eventually I finish and waddle my way back to my friends. I can‚Äôt believe no one heard me. I have never felt more sure and secure of myself while singing that song. When the bridge ‚ÄúYou make me so happy, it turns back to sad‚Ä¶‚Äù plays, I pretend it‚Äôs everyone else singing to me about how cool and awesome I am. Now I don‚Äôt want to sound like a conceited asshole but it makes me feel so much better that I can say that someone is attracted to me for me. The song is me singing to me, and I applaud it for being a relatable queen that makes me feel amazing when I‚Äôm down. It hasn‚Äôt failed me yet. So this song is an eleven, fight me haters. PS. /u/InfernalSolstice I see what you did in the formatting section of the intro, shitting on Gorgeous :/.
 
**natsby** (11): I think my ratings for this and LWYMMD make my taste awful by popheads standards but I just love this. it's so relatable and the sugary high feeling of the chorus really feels like a crush. the (better) in-progress lyrics are also so singable.
 
**fourchip** (10): GAWJUS
 
**kromosol** (10): I just love how cute this song is. Okay.... it's the best song on this album, there I said it !
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Finally an upbeat song that sounds like a Taylor song.
 
**robbiec\_** (10): I DONT UNDERSTAND THE HATE FOR THIS SONG. her voice on the chorus is cute, the lyrics are pretty heart-on-my-sleeve for a pop song and relatable. also gay anthem?
 
**SpanKKy1** (10): @shawn
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Another track that everyone dislikes that just means a lot to me. Okay, the lyrics are cheesy, and okay, it‚Äôs a bit disjointed, but all is erased when that Pavlovian ‚Äúding‚Äù comes in. Taylor is quirky here, and it feels tongue in cheek while also feeling decidedly Taylor Swift-esque. But more importantly, I had my first kiss with my girlfriend minutes before this song dropped, and we held each other as we listened to this at midnight sitting and staring at the Manhattan skyline. It‚Äôs so ridiculous and everyone hates it but it means a lot to me and I legitimately enjoy the song, so roast me I guess.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): y'all motherfuckers tryna fucking drag this cute drunk white girl bop but I am STANDING UP for WHAT IS RIGHT and giving it what it DESERVES gorgeous is a 10 don't @ me
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (9.5): not my favorite on the album ,but still a cute bop. also yall were quick to jump on the hate wagon and drag her for trying to have fun with the "guess ill just stumble on home to my cats alone" line, smh
 
**kappyko** (9.5): This is actually really pretty I LOVE how plasticky and fluorescent this sounds. It channels Rugrats theme music into its squelchy synthpop. It's really so pretty. Clumsy lines can be forgiven for something as nice as this.
 
**rickikardashian** (9.5): I hate Taylor. This just sounds so perfect, it‚Äôs well recorded, mixed, structured,all it needed to be complete was amazing lyrics, but no, she had to go all dumb in them and fucking rhyme face with face. I know she wanted to be like ‚Äúwuw im su droonk and i cant ev en spek right cuz look @ u ur so cute hehe‚Äù, but she could also have done that with lyrics that didn‚Äôt sound like they were written by a toddler. The worst part is that there are some really great lyrics (Ocean blue eyes, looking in mine, I feel like I might, sink and drown and die // You make me so happy it turns back to sad), even in the writing process there were some good ones (I got a boyfriend he‚Äôs older than us, I haven‚Äôt seen him in a couple of months, I‚Äôm not the best in this about love), but those ger ruined by fucking UR SEW GURJEEES. i still love the song and sing along to it but fuck the lyrics make me mad because this could be an 11
 
**cyborglilith** (9.1): BELLS BELLS BELLS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.
 
**camirose** (9): When this song was first released it was like a 5 for me but after 100 replays I end up liking it more every time. It‚Äôs become a car banger for sure.
 
**dwarfgourami** (9): I hated the lyrics at first but I think this is a really cute bop now
 
**Raykel** (9): This is so melodrama(by Lorde)tic, which is exactly what crushes feel like.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i wish the whole album was like this sigh i miss the meme that taylor swift writes breakup songs
 
**tevinterimperium** (9): This is the best song on the album, and it's time for taylor to come out as a lesbian
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): Crucify me, but I think this song is hilarious. Bye!
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8.5): to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Taylor Swift Lyrics. The genius and wording is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of tayoretical physics most of the meanings will go over a typical listener‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Swifts‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Swiftie folk literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they‚Äôre not just meaningful- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Taylor truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the understanding in Taylor‚Äôs existential song catchphrase ‚Äú2am,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Taygenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Becky‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes,by the way, i DO have a Taylor tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid. https://i.redd.it/1cil6dzlm1tz.png

##excuse you this is art
 
**topesmachine** (8.5): i had to subtract points for these AWFUL lyrics but tbh it's a bop
 
**VeganSquash** (8.5): my mom said these lyrics were so bad, but excuse you they are RELATABLE

**poppinmmolly** (8): as u/jamesfog says, this song "aged like milk" and that's just true. I loved it when Taylor released it, now I skip it almost every time I listen to the album.

**zamomattel** (8): when this came out i was obsessed, but that is no longer the case

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Bad lyrics catchy production

**izeasklapaucius** (7): Interesting production. Somehow I'm kinda lukewarm to the lyrics. It's not THAT bad, just kinda silly.

deleted: ##these gays get it
 
**jhxcb** (8.1): Lyrically, this song is brilliant and super transparent. It's beautiful. I do think she went to strong on the synths here without actually turning this into a fun song. I think if she had either upped the energy and danced it up, this could've been better. Or even the opposite, tone down the synth. This song is stuck in a bad place.
 
**joshually** (8): A cute song about negging someone to get in their pants. I can totally relate and PROTIP: It works! PM me for details
 
**leviswift13** (8): I think this is another song that is severely underrated. I believe the lyrics are brilliant because they are acutely relatable while being a parody of what a Taylor Swift song is expected to be.
 
**Piccprincess** (8): Is this about Calvin idk
 
**specfagular** (8): I‚Äôve been a Gorgeous lover since the start when everyone was so pessimistic about her.
 
**twat\_brained** (8): GOWJISS. This song is ridiculous, even by Taylor Swift standards. Thankfully it's not over-the-top ridiculous like "Bad Blood", "Look What You Made Me Do" or "I Did Something Bad". It's got this strange charisma to it, especially the lyric about her cats. In an act of considerable Caucasiousness, (Caucasian audaciousness) I will give this an 8.
 
**followingfreeways** (7.5): unlike most people, I really like the lyrics in this song. I think it perfectly encompasses what this feeling is like! on its own its higher than a 7.5 but in comparison to the rest of this album it falls a little short
 
**melodyllic\_** (7.5): this is pretty much the old taylor, except with more electro and less good lyrics, so idk what she on about
 
**skargardin** (7.5): I‚Äôve grown more fond of this as of late, it‚Äôs got a certain charm to it with its juvenile lyrics. The bridge is both laughable and cute.
 
**crowlily** (7.3): not the best song but not the worst song ever
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): Some of the only clean, well thought out production on the album. Still, making your lyrics sound drunk and bad on purpose still makes them bad. Seems like a cheap ploy to be #relatable
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7): cute but that's about it
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): apparently a lot of people like bubblegum Taylor. This got an overwhelmingly positive response from critics back when it debuted as the second promotional single.
 
**stardustanddinos** (7): I didn‚Äôt like it at first, but now I love it now. It captures that feel of having a crush on someone so damn well.
 
**theNealCutter** (7): i'm not sure how i feel about this song. she's drunk and the song sounds drunk. it works I guess. but it also feels weird. like on one day, I really like it, but the next day I hate it. I dunno, I guess I can tolerate it when it's there, but I'd not choose to play it if I wanted a "drunk is lust" song.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): loving this synth
 
##oh wait she did this??? hold on

**vhqv1997** (7): I hate Taylor so much for purposefully cutting better lyrics from this song
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (7): Melody is super catchy, lyrics are rhythmically interesting (the you should take it as a compliment... / you should think about the consequence... couplets in particular are very well done). I know she's being purposefully juvenile with the lyrics, but that takes it down a couple notches for me, sadly
 
**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): Filler but meh
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (6.5): i think this song is adorable and no one can change that
 
**fifthchevron** (6): This song is so much fun if you refuse to take it seriously. It's just goofy and deliberately dumb, drunk fun. Also she rhymes face with face because she CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE. It's deliberate because she is lost for words. She literally explains why there's no clever rhyme there. If you consider the song is about a verbal form of writers block, it makes a lot of sense.
 
**itsboogiepanda** (6): This is a dumb song. Yes people say it's meant to be dumb as it's written from the PoV of a drunk girl, but it's still dumb.
 
**MashLuke** (6): she sounds like she's drunk at a bachelorette party
 
**SkyBlade79** (6): not too bad. It‚Äôs got good melodies even with horrible lyrics
 
**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): confession: i don't like the word 'gorgeous'
 
**strawberryswing1** (5.5): This production is such ear candy it makes me mad the song with it isn't better
 
**DraculaWeekend** (5): "Cuz look at your face..." yeah no thanks
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (5): Yeah it‚Äôs tongue in cheek I suppose but it‚Äôs still kind of boring to me I don‚Äôt know
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): sonically, the song is fine. But the lyrics are a little offputting...
 
**camerinian** (4.5): lmao she really released filler as a promo single wyd taylor
 
**nooodisaster** (4.5): Within the first 2 seconds this song already peaked and then... turd city.
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4.5): Super generic and inoffensive. The one thing of note for me is that the sort of trappy drums don't really gel with the song and Max clearly is out of his element on this sound. I don't know why someone with as many resources as Taylor Swift continues to use Max Martin this badly.
 
**Brendon-Urine** (4): Would have been a 5 or 6 if it weren't for the horrible lyrics. Like a whole new level of terrible lyrics.
 
**dropthehammer11** (4): This song has very good, bubbly production. But WOW. This may be the worst songwriting I've seen Taylor ever do. It's so awkward and forced, the narrative is just weird, it really brings the song down I think
 
**enecks** (4): This beat sounds like such a parody of pop made by some rockist who thinks The Beatles were something more than a boyband that got famous by stealing other artists. Shame - there's some aspects to the lyrics I find interesting. If the rumors about this being about a lesbian crush are true give this a 10
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): Honestly this song would be a lot better if it had better production and lyrics cause the melody is pretty good.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Even people who stan Reputation hate this song. I thin the mediocre lyrics here are intentional, because, hey, she's drunk. I don't have a problem. I think the lyrics are the best part of the entire thing, actually. They're cute, but some of the sound effect choices are...not. The baby is terrible and the heartbeat is no Wildest Dreams (I don't even like that song all that much). It has elements of a good song, but no way in hell is this worthy of being anything more than a throwaway release. If only B-sides still existed outside of EMOTION.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (4): Reputation's lowest point, I mean I like the song but for what it is...
 
**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): I kind of like the production but the lyrics are so horrible they kill any momentum of the song.
 
**bwc222** (3): i hate this song, but parts are catchy so ima give it a few points
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (3): This track sucks the life out of my body. If you‚Äôre gonna be a drunk mess, commit to it all the way? OTOH Martin/Shellback continue to demonstrate how to redeem the worst of the worst with a countermelody in the final chorus.
 
**jonnl2806** (3): The behind the scenes made me appreciate the song but I still hate it.
 
**quaerex** (3): If you rhyme ‚Äúface‚Äù with ‚Äúface,‚Äù even ironically, you don‚Äôt deserve anything above a 3.
 
**VodkaInsipido** (3): bottom 3 songs of 2017 tbh
 
**dirdbub** (2.5): this is deafeningly trite
 
**CarlieScion** (2): Lyrics that can cut glass, people
 
**JackLebowski** (2): I don't like throwing shade, but I've heard a song with this name but much better. I think the guy that did it rhymes with Canye East
 
**thetimidmartian** (2): trying to defend this songwriting is like trying to put out a forest fire with a waterbottle
 
**ignitethephoenix** (1.5): I just find this song really dumb, and it bugs me she rhymes face with face.
 
**MissyBee37** (1.5): Ugh. This makes me sad & mad... at your face, face. Baby voice?? Ew. There are catchy bits underneath somewhere... but the final result is a song I can't stand.

**Glennishill** (1): This song is hot trash. The beat songs like one of those lullaby CDs and the baby at the beginning is really dumb. Taylor rhymes face with face and that kind of says it all.
 
**MrSwearword** (1): you should take it as a compliment I didn't give this the zero, you goddamn hack.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): The lyrics are pure garbage the production is not interesting or fun and her delivery is grating. This is the worst song she has ever put out. Bye.
 
**awryj** (0): I know this song is supposed to be a self-parody but imo it's not that funny and the beat is annoying...
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): Gorgeous is not that bad of a song per se. But this song perfectly bottles all of the fears I had for this album before its release. It sounds like a reject from 1989, the lyrics are kinda awful, the chorus is so dumb....and not in a good way. Like, rhyming face with face? Jesus Taylor. It's catchy but the song made me assume that Reputation was gonna be '1989 Pt. 2' and thank god most of the other songs proved the opposite. I feel like it's justified that I gave this song a 0. Sorry!
 
**Elitefourbrad** (0): From the child saying ‚ÄúGorgeous‚Äù at the beginning to the last vocals, this song is a horrific mess. This sounds like something a pop girl on Disney Channel would make, complete with a stupid chorus and the most basic lyrics from Taylor I have ever heard.
 
**gannade** (0): Taylor's vocals in this song are nails on a chalkboard
 
**m4ttycool** (0): Best songwriting I‚Äôve ever seen! (original joke)

**SupremeShani** (0): If I had to rate this, I would let Taylor know that Gorgeous is a terrible song and the song that she gave me was not something that I would particularly stream for myself. It was a terrible, stay-off-the-album type of song, and she said that this song was meant to promote one of the most anticipated albums of the year. So if that's the case, she should have put it back in the studio, and she should never even released it, because she was unqualified to release that song if that's the case. I think Gorgeous is a disgrace. It's a disgrace to humanity and it's a disgrace to songs that are actually beautiful and classy, and it just doesn't have the lyrics it thinks it possesses. Somebody lied to Taylor several times and told her that this song was fly, hot, and sexy, and beautiful, and it's nothing like that. It's nothing of the sort.

so apparently this song is like a fan favorite or something like that idk but y‚Äôall fuckin hate it apparently lol. I found it to be pretty forgettable even though there‚Äôs some neat production on this song that makes it feel pretty well thought out.

##ctrl+c

**CarlieScion** (10): This song should've been the closer. The change/flipping coins-lyric is a rare moment of gold. Katy's voice feels raw and filled with emotion
 
**fourchip** (10): this feels like it was written 10 years ago with the reference but a great song
 
**Glennishill** (10): A great display from Katy here. Great lyrics and swelling vocals. The song contains a message everyone can learn from and she sings it with such conviction that you can feel the emotion behind the message. A new classic.
 
**MissyBee37** (10): Strong melody. I love the way the verses hop from note to note, followed by the more drawn-out chorus -- to me, this matches her anxiety about what to say & whether to hit send. You can feel the nerves & longing. Lyrics are oh so relatable.
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): one of my favorite ballads from katy
 
**specfagular** (10): Love love love it. Favorite song off the album
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Honestly, like honestly, this is her best ballad since Not Like the Movies. The chorus is legit moving, and it‚Äôs the only time during the album that Katy curses and mentions Twitter that doesn‚Äôt feel shoehorned, and the latter half of the chorus is just honestly pretty beautiful. I know this song will get robbed, but it‚Äôs damn relatable as someone who writes and erases too many text messages.
 
**nooodisaster** (9.5): Ya'll are gonna do this song dirty when it's low-key the best song on Witness. There's so much emotion here, good job Katy.
 
**SkyBlade79** (9.5): very heartbreaking and relatable
 
**leviswift13** (9.4): One of her best ballads. So emotional, raw and heartbreaking.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Despite its meme-y title, the song itself is so damn sad and relatable.
 
**followingfreeways** (9): oh shit this is really good, can't believe I'm adding TWO songs from witness into my February favs playlist because of this rate.
 
**joshually** (9): ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to subtweet me my number‚Äôs always been the same‚Äù AM I OLD I DON‚ÄôT GET THIS
 
**SpanKKy1** (9): she should have saved this whole album as draft tbh
 
**tevinterimperium** (9): We've all been there, Katy
 
**angusaditus** (8.5): a cute ballad! though seeing her still hang with orlando makes me think she went right ahead and sent it, dumb girl shitting on dua's rule like that https://i.imgur.com/lJSDsV1.gif
 
**skargardin** (8.5): This is so great, the save as draft metaphor is actually really clever.
 
**jhxcb** (8.3): The beginning is stupid, but the rest of the song is pretty decent. I don't think this is going to age well, though.
 
**crowlily** (8): so far I like this. still don't like how she sings :( oooh I really like how this sounds!
 
**jonnl2806** (8): Queen of not saying things on twitter
 
**MashLuke** (8): I like this tbh, I don't know why it's hated
 
**theNealCutter** (8): srsly tho there's something about Katy singing about heartbreak. It's really good. But she's really off-key when she sings the refrain.
 
**thetimidmartian** (8): i dig it, for a song called "save as draft," the songwriting is surprisingly strong, and the belting is some of the strongest in this rate. it comes across as heartfelt if slightly generic.
 
**Albert\_Cole** (7.3): Too real for me. Except instead of emails, I do this with leaving the house
 
**twat\_brained** (7.2): Is the moral of this to "think before you speak, for your words have actions"? I'm gonna concuss myself if I try to keep track of how wocc this album is.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): well i dont hate this song, and its actually decent, but it could be better. a perfect fit for a 7 score. i listen to it sometimes, its fine, but its not something id put in a "top 50 katy songs" list. if it gets a better score than Dressin Up I'm Nina Bonina Fo Fana Bo Bana suing your asses
 
**fifthchevron** (7): Would be so much better without the "save as draft" metaphor. She could've come up with something so much more heartbreaking. Comparing a long dead relationship to a word document does not convey emotion adequately. Mostly it feels like old Katy which is good.
 
**natsby** (7): one of the only good ballads off this album
 
**rickikardashian** (7): ‚ÄúI don't fuck with change but lately I've been flipping coins a lot‚Äù earned this +1
 
**stardustanddinos** (7): An earnest song, and which treats breakups a lot more maturely than I‚Äôd expect a modern pop song to. The bridge is lovely.
 
**vhqv1997** (7): This would sound so dated in like 5 years. It's such a shame because I really like its message
 
**robbiec\_** (6.8): I could hear Adele singing this because it is pretty MOR but her voice is really good on this imo
 
**kromosol** (6.7): Aside from the good production nothing in this song is interesting...
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (6.5): Sincerest performance on the album, by far. michelle voice Still underwhelming.
 
**cyborglilith** (6): filler
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): This song kind of fall flat because of the ‚Äòsave as draft‚Äô theme of the song. But the emotion behind is great.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): Does the 808s and rattling hi-hats really necessary in this ballad? This is the same case as Flannel from JT's MOTW. Unecessary percussions to make the song seems "modern" and "hip" when it's just so cringey. Nice lyrics tho.
 
**Raykel** (6): Omg the typing. Lmao @ her melodrama(by Lorde)tic ass.
 
**SupremeShani** (6): The references to current technology doesn't really bother me, but it's not a song that gets me in my feelings.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (6): It tried to grab my heart but instead it grabbed my left lung
 
**vayyiqra** (6): boring
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): This song sounds like the supposedly penultimate song of an off-off-Broadway show that was written by someone who hates Millennials. But I still kind of liked it. The lyrics were just kind of unfortunate.
 
**camerinian** (5.5): The save as draft sentiment is actually a good concept, and it really demands a more interesting song to be attached to than more mid-tempo bleh

##ctrl+v
 
**deadspiderwall** (5): gonna sound pretty outdated when we can type with our minds
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): This feels like it's supposed to be very deep and sad and troubling but like I can't unassociate this with my middle school computer lab essays
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (5): Ehhh it‚Äôs not awful but ultimately it‚Äôs kind of unremarkable.
 
**m4ttycool** (5): who writes emails in 2017/2018?
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): Well this won‚Äôt be dated I‚Äôm 5 years.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Wow, I can't believe Katy is trying to capture the experience of participating in NaNoWriMo! Wig flown. She's truly woke.
 
**quaerex** (5): It feels very r/fellowkids, but at least it‚Äôs delivered well and there‚Äôs actually emotion in her voice. But ‚Äúsubtweet?‚Äù Really, Katy?
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): cringy
 
**TragicKingdom1** (5): This needed to be a lot more powerful all-around to actually work. "fork in the FUCKING road!" is lowkey the worst lyric on this album btw

**kappyko** (3): Lol I heard this on the adult contemporary Delilah station once Girl Katy LMAO
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this is hard to listen to it's like i just can't pay attention. breath doesn't rhyme with draft

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (10): Thinking Of You is long forgotten. The One That Got Away did in fact get away. and (By) The Grace of God is dis-proven, atheist win. Save As Draft is the power ballad of Witness with so many things that I love about. The typewriter at the beginning, and right before and during the chorus is a nice touch. I'm betting you didn't actually notice the small ticking in the chorus because of how much is going on. The chorus feels the absolute need to be belted, especially with the explosion from the bridge as Katy sings ‚ÄúStaring at a fork in the fucking road.‚Äù Now of course there are things that aren't perfect about this song; there are some really weird lyrics in the chorus which don't seem to have much relationship with the rest of the song. Nonetheless, the emotion is still conveyed well, especially in the last ‚ÄúWhat good will it do? To reopen the wounds.‚Äù

**THIS SONG SPLASHES YO**
--- 

**Glennishill** (11): Top 5 Katy song for me. I loved it from the first time I heard that 10 second teaser in 2016. The beat is incredible and Katy is everything in this song; fun, talented, sexy and contemplative. I absolutely love it. I want to get in a bath, run off the lights and let the magic of this song carry me away.

**angusaditus** (10): this got me all 
**awryj** (10): embrace febreze

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): another example of a sonic experiment gone right! i'm wet too!

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The production on here is great, I can imagine myself having sex on the beach to this song.

**robbiec\_** (10): potential eleven, I didn't really remember this song but one day she put up a video for her tour on her Instagram and it was these 2 guys dancing in slow motion to it so I went back to it and wow I love it

**skargardin** (10): Tsunami had to grow on me a lot but it‚Äôs honestly one of the most well-produced songs on Witness, I love it.

**ulikejazz** (9.6): Rihanna wants her synth sounds back (but she also probably bops to this)

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): One of the most underrated songs on the album. I love the wavy feel the song has, it works perfectly with the song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I still can't believe Mike Will Made It produced this song tbh.

**SkyBlade79** (9): holy cow this is a bop! Reminds me of waves by Miguel, it‚Äôs great

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Vibes all day. Mike Will's production is funky and airy, complimenting Katy's vocals perfectly.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): production is everything

**VeganSquash** (8.5): the intro to the bridge makes my pussy wet

**zamomattel** (8.5): this production though, bestill my wig

**natsby** (8): it's actually interesting!!

**sletrab07** (8): Marvin Gaye found dead once more, Sexual Healing is quaking in its boots.

**specfagular** (8): Wasn‚Äôt super into this song at first but now I enjoy it and think I was a dumb heaux for doubting it earlier

**stardustanddinos** (8): Man, this one. The lush production is so good, and Katy sounds so sensuous and measured.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): invented natural disasters

**vayyiqra** (8): same

**banananaise** (7.5): tropical beach-slash-brutalist cyborg vibes

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): Nice psychedelic influence.

**Musical Equivalent of *moist***
---

**leviswift13** (7.3): I know this is a fan fav, but it is just kind of there for me.

**crowlily** (7.1): hmmm... the verses > the chorus.

**followingfreeways** (7): ultimately forgettable :/

**fourchip** (7): i don‚Äôt date, honey, cookie on tsunami, all my n****s wife me once they get that good punani

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): Honestly a super chill song. Not sure how much this has been mentioned but I love that the lead-in to the song is Katy repeating Chained to the Rhythm (the song directly before Tsunami). Idk I really appreciate that detail.

**kappyko** (7): That gorgeous seaside intro deserves a better song than this lowkey synth funk track; this is what people heard in "You're the One" for the All-Stars rate.

**MrSwearword** (7): the production is the saving grace because per usual, bad lyrics and barely on par vocals emerge.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I actually quite like the instrumental here, and while this song is forgettable, it‚Äôs not terrible.

**TheLastAxolotl** (7): Decent, like Roulette, I don't get the hype behind this

**vhqv1997** (7): The production is the only memorable thing about this song

**whatareblackhole** (7): This song was interesting, but I felt like I was drowning in all of the sea/ocean/water-themed buzzwords. "Anchor in me" was particularly gross lol

**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): I'm drowning in these mixed metaphors

**enecks** (6): Waterboard me daddy

**MashLuke** (6): pass

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i don‚Äôt get why everyone likes this song, I just skip it bc ‚ÄúChained‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúBon App√©tit‚Äù sound nice

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): This isn‚Äôt really a tsunami. It‚Äôs more like a Wave Pool

**SupremeShani** (6): I love the chill eighties feel this song has, which is only heightened by the ocean imagery Katy uses that evokes such a beachlike vibe.

**theNealCutter** (6): at this point I'm just bored with the album.

**jhxcb** (5.2): Wow. I accidentally went right through this song without even listening. This song is so... nothing. There's no meat to it.

**Pussy Drier Than Cali's Forests**
---

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): this song is a sex song, which is weird because my libido went into negatives after listening to it. god if i werent such a sucker for 80's outrun melodies...why did they had to waste it on this shame of a song.

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): back to mediocrity ugh

**jonnl2806** (5): The song just doesn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I get mildly entertained by this every time I listen to it. Then I completely forget what it sounds like. I think people who are big on Witness see it as one of the best deep cuts, though? That must mean it did something right.

**thetimidmartian** (5): im never a fan of the metaphors comparing people to bodies of water, only cupcakke can do that one, but i really like that "the world's your oyster and im the pearl" line

**twat\_brained** (5): Did this have to be on the album?

**deadspiderwall** (4.5): are my eyes still open?

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): I like the lower toned synth but this is fairly basic and dull otherwise.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): overrated

**topesmachine** (4): this song is sluggish and not good

**dirdbub** (3.5): I wish a tsunami would pick me up and just flood me out so I wouldn't have to deal with most of this album

**camerinian** (3): i was gonna compare this to vaporwave, before I realised how brutal of an insult that was to vaporwave

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (3): Has no idea what it wants to be. Supposed to be a sex jam, but its weirdly spacey, loud, and clattery.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (3): Am I missing something? There‚Äôs no reason to make a sexy song that sounds this unsexy. Completely overshadowed by Bon App√©tit.

**quaerex** (3): ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs your oyster and I am your pearl‚Äù ... at least the chorus sounds nice.

**Brendon-Urine** (2): Just really boring tbh

**itsboogiepanda** (2): This is the listen experience equivalent of eating cardboard.

**joshually** (2): ‚Äúsail away smoothly‚Äù ON A TSUNAMI? HOW KATY HOW

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): this made me want to kill myself again

**camirose** (1): The cadence in this song feels really really off and awkward to me, and it doesn‚Äôt match the instrumentals at all.

**fifthchevron** (1): lmao what the hell

**nooodisaster** (0): This song is AGGRESSIVELY boring. The lyrics are soo cringey and forced and kill any potential sexiness Katy could bring. My pussy has never been drier.

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.8): First of all I just want to say that Katy does not know how a tsunami works. Now that that's out of the way, I really like the vibe this song gives off. Chill but also sexy. The imagery is good too, the verses and chorus feel like waves going back and forth. I really like how well the bridge fits into this song with parts of the chorus continuing alongside it.

##I miss you when the lights go out

**angusaditus** (10): https://i.imgur.com/nc8h7JQ.gif
 
**chipsi1** (10): this sounds like it needs to be played in an empty stadium, which it probably has. Buy tickets to the Witness tour today! (or don't, cause it's like over)
 
**MrSwearword** (10): it's like a brief bit of self awareness happened for Katy and co. by giving her a ballad she almost sings perfectly in the studio. that and I actually liked it from the first listen back on album release day
 
**skargardin** (10): One of Katy‚Äôs best ballads, everything just works the way it‚Äôs intended, even the lyrics.
 
**SpanKKy1** (10): I miss the old Katy, straight from the go Katy
 
**specfagular** (10): GOD this song cuts deep
 
**vhqv1997** (10): This song is really heartbreaking, and probably the best song on the album
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The "I missed you more than I loved you" lyric is goddamn relatable.
 
**followingfreeways** (9): wow I really like this song. definitely hits home and is the standout on this album for me.
 
**Glennishill** (9): A new Katy classic for me. I think the concept is unique and really gets at that feeling of not really missing being in love with someone but missing who you were when you were with them. It‚Äôs a real feeling that she nails.
 
**joshually** (9): "We didn't lose, we didn't win" THEN WHAT KATY WHAT
 
**PuggleMaster** (9): I will always think of the gays having sex to this song in that tweet
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): This is stunning. I really, really love this one. This is, like, the better Unconditionally.
 
**leviswift13** (8.8): One of the stronger moments for sure.
 
**kromosol** (8.5): I miss you more than I loved you
 
**Albert\_Cole** (8.3): This is a strong enough concept to build a song on. Maybe not this particular song, but *a* song.
 
**jhxcb** (8.2): Lyrically, I like a lot of this. I love the main chorus line: "I miss you more than I loved you." I think it's pretty original. I think melodically Katy is capable of more, though. This song could've been a lot better.

##It illuminates all of my doubts
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): wow a decent song. if the album had more songs like this, and CTTR, I'd buy it actually.
 
**cyborglilith** (8): belongs right on reputation
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like the rawness and emotion Katy has in this song. You can definitely feel how much she means what she says in here. Production also really suits the song here
 
**m4ttycool** (8): nice
 
**melodyllic\_** (8): the only ballad on the album that i consider to be worth anyone's time. the 'miss you more than i loved you' line >>>
 
**MissyBee37** (8): I love this concept! Missing someone more as an idea than you loved them in real life. The second verse is especially pretty, lyrically. A lovely song.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This is so calming wtf.
 
**theNealCutter** (8): she's good at making heartbreak songs. There's this hollow quality to her voice that makes her sound more sombre when paired with atmospheric production.
 
**rickikardashian** (7.7): fuck who would have thot that miss Katy had it in her to have lyrics as real as ‚ÄúI miss you more than I loved you‚Äù. I felt that
 
**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): Damn, the chorus on this song is really good. Especially the final one, when everything gets really loud.
 
**jonnl2806** (7.5): The production and instrumentation are really good here.
 
**topesmachine** (7.5): queen of having emotions
 
**crowlily** (7.2): can she go back to actually singing like she used to :( I used to be a fan yikes... I like the concept of this song and the chorus!
 
**itsboogiepanda** (7.2): When Katy Perry did Rainbow better than Kesha

##pull me in,
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): A nice sentiment, and one of the better written, but the production and katy's voice absolutely kill it for me
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (7): Is it too much to ask the songwriters to actually write a chorus? Oh well. The mixture of electronic and acoustic sounds is enjoyable here, as on the title track.
 
**fifthchevron** (7): I think this is the only song to achieve that "cold production/emotional lyric" mood.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (7): This is actually a pretty damn beautiful ballad. I would keep this on my phone (unlike a third of the album whoops). Loses points for some clunky lyrics in the second verse (notice a theme here with this album?)
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Pretty standard ballad, though I'd call it the best one on Witness. 'I miss you more than I loved you' is one of the few good lines on the album.
 
**thetimidmartian** (7): she sings well but it winds up sounding like a mid 2000s ballad with funny production. goodness, those vocals though!
 
**vayyiqra** (7): this is okay
 
**camerinian** (6.5): OK the sentiment on this song is a lot nicer and the intended emotions come through a lot clearer, but honestly at this point the album is in a rut that the continued buzzing future-bass-ish instrumentals don‚Äôt really help disrupt
 
**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Chorus is a little too cheesy and theatrical for me
 
**VeganSquash** (6.5): I must be in a good mood because usually I hate this song, but it sounds pretty good.

##hold me tight
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): this could have been so good, it's so sad
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): Nice filler.
 
**MashLuke** (6): If this was a Eurovision song it would finish last
 
**natsby** (6): it reminds me a bit of the ballads from Teenage Dream, which is a good thing
 
**stardustanddinos** (6): Standard ballad I guess, it‚Äôs alright.
 
**SupremeShani** (6): The chorus is simple, but the line is effective and one of the few times where Katy says enough with few words.
 
**robbiec\_** (5.8): to me this sounds like most songs on Prism except better. really like some of the lyrics in this song too
 
**callmetidle** (5.5): This song had SO MUCH potential, it‚Äôs such a great concept, but I feel Katy failed to really capitalize
 
**SkyBlade79** (5.5): kind of boring

##don't let go,
 
**enecks** (5): Small brain: Witness is bad because it tries to be woke and fails. Big brain: Witness is bad because it has too many ballads and is boring.
 
**kappyko** (5): "I miss you more than I loved you" is a pretty great line let's repeat it like a million fucking times in the slowest most unemotional way possible
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): filler
 
**quaerex** (5): The potential of this song is what makes me give it a 5. The line ‚ÄúI miss you more than I loved you‚Äù is really good, and she delivers it well, with a lot of emotion. But she‚Äôs bogged down with strange verses and weird metaphors again. The balloon metaphor makes no sense, and the second prechorus (‚ÄúBaby, you‚Äôll always be in my orbit‚Äù) is another unnecessary clich√©.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I don‚Äôt even really have a comment for this song but like honestly I don‚Äôt really find it emotional or powerful, sorry Katy :(
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (5): Meh
 
**deadspiderwall** (4.5): yawn

##baby give me light
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): definition of cliche
 
**dirdbub** (4): I kinda zoned out during that but honestly it sounded nice, maybe? I dunno don't judge me
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): Filler arrived
 
**nooodisaster** (4): It's awkward when a song should objectively be relatable to you, but you feel nothing listening to it. Basically, the emotion is just notttt here with this one, and the lyrics oscillate from Adele 25 D-side to cringe-y (that balloon one, jfc).
 
**zamomattel** (4): why does she always have loads of boring ballads lmao
 
**awryj** (3.5): I like the emotion in Katy's voice but that's about it
 
**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): This is painfully basic and boring. Production isn't even interesting which has been this album's lifeline so far.
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (3): UGhhhhhh
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1.5): miss me with this snoozefest katheryn
 
**Elitefourbrad** (1): ‚ÄúI have to make this different than Prism somehow!!!‚Äù
 
**twat\_brained** (0): This is blatant filler and is easily a contender for the worst song on the entire album. I'm not sure if I should give this my 0 or TIWWCHNT. I'm gonna give it to this because at least Taylor is trying on that song. Katy isn't doing anything of note here.

=====

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (8.1): ‚ÄúI miss you more than I loved you‚Äù can be read two different ways. One is that Katy only really liked the idea of a relationship, but it didn't really matter with who. The second is that now that they've broken up, Katy is now realizing everything she took for granted in the relationship. Another standout line is ‚ÄúSo strange, you know all my secrets. Please keep them safe.‚Äù It feels like a weird thing to ask someone who you've broken up with. I would assume that this would go without saying. When Katy says it I get the impression that this was an important relationship (hence him knowing all her secrets), but now shes ready to move on since she doesn't want this secrets to get out and ruin her future relationships. Side note, right before the chorus it sounds like a plane's propeller and I don't know how to feel about it.

**Glennishill** (10): Italian chef kiss I fucking love this song. The beat is killer and the lyrics are awesome. Katy's vocals are totally rad and I just love the song start to finish. I'm literally dancing while typing this.
 
**milkywayinradius** (10): I need to be driving a sports car down an empty freeway at night then end up in a dance club making longing glances at someone across the room, all of it in slow motion
 
**MissyBee37** (10): From the opening line, I adore this song. That line haunts me. I live off the echoes of your I love you's... Gold. The production is fabulous, and I love this instrumental and her vocal, especially in the way she holds the notes in the chorus. I can't not dance to this song.
 
**Mudkip1** (10): love the beat drop
 
**twat\_brained** (9.8): When will your fave compare a messy relationship to Chinese water torture? As a matter of fact, I unironically think this is one of the best songs on Witness. I guess it's because I can't see what's so wocc about it but I don't feel compelled to seek it out.
 
**stardustanddinos** (9.5): Man, oh man, this song is lovely. It is about the pattern of abuse in a dead-end relationship and the production is INSANELY good. While the lyrics could use work, this song ranks highly because of how well it is done.
 
**angusaditus** (9): https://i.imgur.com/ip4HLXG.gif

**VeganSquash** (9): the beat is infectious

**awryj** (8.5): shoulda been a single

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): another song saved by its production, the chorus annoys me a little tho

**leviswift13** (7.6): I think this is a grower. It is not up with the strongest songs, but it has its moments.

**cyborglilith** (7): repetitive, but the production is interesting

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Pretty cool disco inspired track, I think. I actually don't find 'figure out the Rubix Cube' to be an especially atrocious line, TBH.

**vayyiqra** (7): good music, bad lyrics

**whatareblackhole** (7): I like this song, but I'm not the biggest fan of the beat. The lyrics are pretty good.

**jhxcb** (6.2): Deja Vu is so perfect for this song because I feel like I've heard it before. It's not necessarily bad, but there really is nothing special about it. Unless that's the genius of it.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): the production is missing somethingt that could have made this good

**TheLastAxolotl** (6): You already know what I'm thinking

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6): "I live off the echoes of your I love yous" and "at the end of a rope that keeps getting shorter" are great lines.
 
**CarlieScion** (5): This song is so anonymous omg

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (5): The long stretched syllables on the chorus aren't creative, just annoying

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Fillerish sort of but okayish at the same time?

**enecks** (5): BUY SPOTIFY PREMIUM

**fifthchevron** (5): Same story lyrically as Selena Gomez‚Äôs Sober and honestly Selena did it better. The vocal performance isn‚Äôt pleasant to listen to.

**Piccprincess** (5): [CUZ EVERYDAYS THE SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/333403698262966284/418613088301088779/wW2HBfEC1uJfwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg.png)

**deadspiderwall** (4.5): lmao

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): This is Katy at her most H&M-background-music. Vaguely ambient and ravey, but ultimately doesn't go anywhere.
 
**m4ttycool** (4): Chinese water torture hehe. Also, this needs a bridge (?)
 
**SupremeShani** (4): In what I'm assuming is an attempt to reflect the repetitive nature of the relationship in the song, this drones on for far too long.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (2): Listening to that flat ass delivery in the chorus is like scaphism. Interesting production in the verses keeps this (barely) aloft.

##dae chinese water torture?

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): DAE CHINESE WATER TORTURE?

**skargardin** (9): I‚Äôm ready for all the comments to be about the Chinese water torture line. I for one like it.

**specfagular** (8): obligatory CHINESE WATER TORTURE comment

**1313Harbor** (9): Such a basic yet mesmerizing song. I‚Äôm with Sufjan Stevens though - what kind of simile is ‚ÄúYour words are like Chinese water torture‚Äù???

**izeasklapaucius** (9): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the methodology of Chinese water torture.

**banananaise** (8.5): if you people keep complaining about the lyrics and ignore the bangin beats then i will chinese water torture you all
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): Something, something, Chinese Water Torture
 
**zamomattel** (8.5): i love that katy ruins the song that sounds most like a single with that random torture reference
 
**Albert\_Cole** (8.2): The lyrics are not that bad. Chinese water torture
 
**BrokenGlassSparkling** (8): Home to the infamous Chinese Water Torture line, but in spite of that line, actually decent.
 
**bwc222** (8): imagine telling someone who hasn't heard this song that it talks about chinese water torture, centipedes, and rubix cubes in just 3 minutes oml
 
**DraculaWeekend** (8): "I live off the echoes of your I love yous" Such a great opening line‚Ä¶and then we get to "Chinese water torture." :/
 
**kappyko** (8): The chorus feels a little underwhelming but I think they're going for hypnotic here. If so, then this song is great at that. Also, I don't know why people are upset about the Chinese water torture line when the Rubik's cube line appears more often and feels more shoehorned than that one.
 
**melodyllic\_** (8): queen of lyrical extremes i guess? 'echoes of your iloveyous' gets two thumbs up, can you guess what 'chinese water torture' gets?
 
**rickikardashian** (8): Highkey I feel like I have to defend my girl Katy here. ‚ÄúCHINESE WATER TORTURE* ISNT A BAD LYRICS. It does sound a bit off, but we‚Äôve hear worse and let it pass. A bunch of people thought this was about waterboarding and disliked it because of it, but it‚Äôs not Katy‚Äôs fault that they don‚Äôt what it was. I want yall to stop dragging her on every ‚Äúworst lyrics‚Äù thread that goes up

**strawberryswing1** (8): the first verse has really good lyrics, but "chinese water torture" makes you forget that
 
**theNealCutter** (8): I love the wavy atmospheric production, it fits well with the weirdly empty and sad persona that the lyrics tries to show. This would be 10 except the C H I N E S E W A T E R T O R T U R E line exists and the bridge ruins the flow of the song.
 
**crowlily** (7.2): the beat be cool! okay I heard the chinese water torture line yikes...

**followingfreeways** (7): ahh..so this is the song that the famous "Chinese water torture" line is from
 
**kromosol** (7): C H I N E S E W A T E R T O R T U R E
 
**MrSwearword** (7): unfortunate irony of Katy Perry singing a song called DEJA VU aside, this song manages to be pleasant enough. forgets the Chinese Water torture line also delivered without irony from KATY PERRY

**nooodisaster** (7): how many 0s will this get for "chinese water torture"? Beyond that, it's a low-key bop (But also Beyonc√© outsold).

**robbiec\_** (6.5): OKAY BUT THE CHINESE WATER TORTURE LINE IS JUST SO FUNNY

**jonnl2806** (6): Pretty ok and inoffensive except for ‚ÄúChinese Water Torture‚Äù
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): I stan Chinese water torture
 
**theburningundead** (6): that line is like chinese water torture

**vhqv1997** (4): I hate this song so much, the lyrics start off so strong but then came the Chinese water torture line

**quaerex** (2): The first verse starts out promising, the prechorus invites. The first chorus cements. And then you get slapped in the face by the ‚ÄúChinese water torture‚Äù line. Sloppy writing doomed Katy‚Äôs album.

**joshually** (2): "‰Ω†ÁöÑËØùÂ∞±ÂÉè‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ∞¥ÁöÑÊäòÁ£® Ê≤°ÊúâÁªàÁÇπÁ∫øÔºåÊÄªÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ËßíËêΩ" ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÂáØËíÇ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà
 
**camerinian** (0): I genuinely rage quit this album my first time through after the ‚ÄòChinese Water Torture‚Äô line.The fact that her entire writing team had the nerve to invoke torture in such a casual manner, and the fact that nobody at any point of post-production turned around and said ‚ÄòHey this is a bit fucked up can you rethink that line‚Äô is astounding. Of course, since this album is boring as tar, I don‚Äôt exactly blame literally everyone for tuning out

**camirose** (0): your words are like Chinese water torture
 
**topesmachine** (0): this gets my zero just for the chinese water torture line like no

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourite songs on the album. I love the hypnotizing sound of it (best production on the album IMO) and the chorus is so so good. And I know everyone is going to call out the Chinese water torture line, however I don‚Äôt think it detracts from the rest of the song. It definitely grows on you.

**sletrab07** (10): Hot take: The Chinese water torture line doesn't bother me at all. I'm too busy bopping along to this OUTSTANDING production. Points go to Katy for successfully using a 7th interval in the melody 'I live OFF THE echoes', we love a musical theory queen.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Might be my favorite dance track on the album. The production is killer, and those 'oooooo's from Katy send me to another planet. The water torture line doesn't even bother me.

**MashLuke** (7.5): smooth as fuck. If it wasn't for a few lines this would be even better

**thetimidmartian** (7.5): a standout track, water torture or not. opening the song with her falsetto is a very tactical move. the random rubiks cube is a little more annoying than chinese water torture, she was ON to something with chinese water torture, she pulled a diamond out of her ass but didnt clean the shit off it before putting it on the song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): That line...yikes. The rest of the song is fine though.

**fourchip** (3.5): i‚Äôm stifling a yawn

**amumumyspiritanimal** (3): im not gonna mention that line, but yeah its not a good song. the wailing in the chorus, the still cringy as fuck lyrics, and even the instrumental cant save this song (because its not good)

**dirdbub** (3): aside from the obvious line, this is just boring

**dwarfgourami** (3): these lyrics are just so bad

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2.5): asian liquid torment

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (8.4): This song starts off very strong. We hear ‚ÄúI live off the echoes of your I Love Yous‚Äù and then we actually hear the echos. The important thing is the next line does not echo as well. Later there's the rather iconic line (gonna skip it since someone else will 100% mention it). The song as a whole is pretty decent, sure there is that one weird line but since the start was so good I'm basically gonna cancel them out.

MissyBee37: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

This is the first one I'm truly disappointed in :( There are other Katy songs out that I love personally but I'm not surprised they ranked low on here. But "Deja Vu" is too fabulous to go Day 1!!! </3

Seriously, though, the "Chinese water torture line???? That's what no one can get past?? IT'S A VALID SIMILE!!!

Ok, this bops hard, and has a catchy af hook. I love this so much and seeing x6 1s makes me upset for your poor ears who got hurt by someone. 

The way she delivers in the pre-chorus makes me really happy, and I really thought this would succeed in this era of 'inspo-pop'. 

**I RISE UP I RISE LIKE THE DAY**
--- 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): the pre-chorus saves this song

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i swear I always mistake this song as "Into You" whenever it comes on

**MissyBee37** (10): I am SO excited it's in the rate because it's a Top 10 Katy song for me. One of my favorite Katy vocals ever! I love the epic feel of the music & melody. The lyrics are SO powerful & strong. Her voice just slays this song; she delivers every single word & note with such conviction. Just beautiful. It literally gives me chills.

**Leixander** (9.5): UNDERRATED CRIMINALLY

**jhxcb** (9.4): This might be better than anything on Witness.

**banananaise** (9): the nonsensical and unjustifiable negative reaction to this good song and great video should have warned us all

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (9): I really don't get why people didn't like it. I was sure it would be a hit.

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (9): :)

**specfagular** (9): Why does nobody like Rise? I love ha.

**cyborglilith** (8.5): idk why people hate this song

**leviswift13** (8.5): I love the "victory is in my veins" line.

**quaerex** (8.5): It's easy to forget that Katy has a really good voice but then she shows it on songs like this. Damn, Katy. This is where you should be putting your energy. Nice.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): I don't know why popheads seems to dislike Rise. I think it was a great song to be used for the olympics: powerful vocals, vaguely uplifting, popular singer? CHECK

**topesmachine** (8): this is pretty good!

**vayyiqra** (8): inspirational anthem

**vhqv1997** (8): The final chorus should have definitely been more explosive

**whatareblackhole** (8): OMG, I love this atmospheric moment. This video is also pretty stunning. I miss the darker haired days.

**She Rose, But That Glass Ceiling is Intact**
---

**crowlily** (7.4): cool execution of this idea. this is actually pretty good. I like the production! don't like the way she sings dammit

**Albert\_Cole** (7.3): Cute enough, and I liked it at the time, but I can see why it's not on the album. Also - peaked higher than Bon Appetit or Swish Swish lol

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): underrated!

**awryj** (7): slightly underrated

**deadspiderwall** (7): old Katy perry dead

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Not too bad, just sooo dramatic. If this were done by Imagine Dragons, it probably would have been a hit

**Glennishill** (7): I'll always have a special place in my heart for this song because it came during a drought of Katy content but the song is a little too samey to be a classic for me.

**izeasklapaucius** (7): ENYUWINANEGOSHIYEI

**melodyllic\_** (7): eh its a song. i guess i shouldnt have expected too much from a self empowerment anthem

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): honestly. better than most of witness

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): i think i heard this when it first came out, and never cared for it again

**fourchip** (6.5): kween of empowerment

**camirose** (6): Wtf again‚Ä¶ everything NOT on Witness was better than almost every song that actually WAS on Witness‚Ä¶ lmao

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Why are we rating this song again?

**Elitefourbrad** (6): Katy and trap do not go together.

**jonnl2806** (6): Generic self empowerment anthem

**skargardin** (6): As far as self-empowerment songs go, this is insanely generic.

**tevinterimperium** (6): This song is just okay I guess. It annoys me that she released it on the same day as Make Me (Ooh) though

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): I actually think the chorus here has some pretty decent potential in it, but Katy simply isn't a good enough vocalist to pull this off.


**Hillary's Downfall**
---

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): Meh

**TheLastAxolotl** (5): Don't know ha

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): I don't hate the production on this but it's not a great self-empowerment anthem.

**bwc222** (4): god i hate "empowering" songs that just come off as too try-hard

**SupremeShani** (4): I forgot this song existed.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): this song is why hillary lost

**thetimidmartian** (4): her lyrics are clunky and cliched, but her belting is powerful, especially towards the end

**ClocktowerMaria** (3): I forgot this existed, still not good

**ImADudeDuh** (3): meme.

**strawberryswing1** (3): half hearted shit

**camerinian** (1.5): This song is a total mess, seems lazily thought out and prepared and basically inspired nobody like the Olympics are supposed to. In other words, it was the perfect song for the Rio games

**amumumyspiritanimal** (1): not today, satan

**MrSwearword** (1): not this shit again

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): im the person who keeps counts in every relationship so yeah this is nina bonina and trixie levels of relatable.

**Damoojo** (10): a sexy bop

**deadspiderwall** (10): #1 SIG stan

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely one of my top-tier favorite songs in the album and I definitely think it's criminally underrated by most people including the Swifties. It reminds me a lot of Mind Maze for its atmospheric, moody tone. And that chorus? Heaven. "Straches down on your back now" is hella relatable. I am that kinky.

**fourchip** (10): see you in the pit, my eyes on you reputation haters

**jonnl2806** (10): Hands down one of the best on the album. The bridge is perfection

**MrSwearword** (10): some of the lyrics suck, but I'll be nice and say this deserved to be on 1989 so that album could have four good tracks instead of merely three.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Honestly, I know this is going straight to day 1, probably the first song out, but by God is it one of my favorites on this album. The drums slap, with a serious crispness, and it‚Äôs one of the few times where I feel like the production isn‚Äôt holding her back. It‚Äôs robotic, almost to a point, and considering the context of the track, it‚Äôs fitting. The ‚Äúwho‚Äôs counting‚Äù (1 2 3) is one of the most intimate moments on the album, and makes the final chorus that much more bittersweet and biting. I feel like I‚Äôm in the serious minority on this, and I doubt Taylor will even play this song on her tour, but I will forever love it.

**cyborglilith** (9.9): Autotune use along with quiet production in the first verse makes Taylor seem cold and distant. Later, she sings the huge chorus, sounding uninterested like Tove Lo in Disco Tits but also secretly emotional. The production throughout this entire song builds suspense and totally fits the theme of the album.

**Piccprincess** (9.5): Is this a bad time to mention how much I want Calvin Harris to fuck me

**camirose** (9): The most erotic song she‚Äôs ever made by far. It just needs a bit more instrumentals/melody on the verses and it could‚Äôve gone a bit further towards Style territory.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ooOOOOoOOOoO this payoff was worth it!

**poppinmmolly** (9): UNDERRATED

**vhqv1997** (9): I can't help but imagine a circus MV with Joseph Kahn's classic stunning visuals whenever I hear this song

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8.5): this made me think of a spotify ad idk. also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LtDOlgN_ug this doesn't fit here but it's so good

**zamomattel** (8.5): this is gonna be sent out real early but it deserves better

**followingfreeways** (8.3): I feel the drop of this chorus in my soul

**itsboogiepanda** (8.2): Scandalous, sexy, superb. The way Taylor sings 'chill' at 1:29 and whispering '1...2...3...' sends shivers down my spine.

**acedino** (8): Though it was pretty 'meh' on my first listen but it's grown on me a lot.

**CarlieScion** (8): if this isn't performed live i'll be mad

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This song has actually really grown on me since I first listened to the album and I find myself coming back to it more and more. I especially love the bridge and the lead-in to the final chorus where Taylor whispers. Queen of counting.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This is really great production.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Now, I definitely don't get the hate for this one. The first verse is fitting because this is one of the rare instances where a song sounds magical. There are little bits in the background, like the sound of glass clinking, that I love. Also, if this is a Slaughterhouse Five reference, consider my wig snatched. I think that people's problem with this is the disjointed composition; it's hard to spot at first, but this honestly sounds more like a leak of a second or third draft than an officially released song. The bridge is heavenly.

**quaerex** (8): I really like this song. It‚Äôs completely unoriginal but that bombastic production and slick beat makes this a standout to me.

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): I've made out to this song so I'm a bit biased

**vayyiqra** (8): edgy lyrics

**leviswift13** (7.6): I think there are some good ideas here, but ultimately they are not worth this song getting a place on the record.

**melodyllic\_** (7.5): moody, muddy and murky. is it a bop? who knows

**crowlily** (7.4): I like the bridge!

**fifthchevron** (7): This took forever to grow on me but I love it now. Listen late at night when you're a bit angry at the world and it clicks. I think it could be improved quite a lot, I don't like each line going a bit higher at the end and a longer, meatier outro would've been good, but overall it works well enough.

**kappyko** (7): IT GOES IT GOES IT GOES GUILLOTIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE

**MashLuke** (7): I love she always refers to sex as 'bad things'

**NapsAndNetflix** (7): the who's counting 1, 2, 3 part is everything i need

**stardustanddinos** (7): This song loses out because it is abutted by the weakest tracks on the album (IMO), but it‚Äôs great.

**VeganSquash** (6.5): this is like one of the weirder songs I've listened to tbh

**twat\_brained** (6.1): I got distracted by Halsey tweeting about sweatshirts. :janet: Nonetheless this is non-filler but it's not exactly a standout either. Just sort of‚Ä¶ there. Which means this will probably be bang-on average in relation to the rate.

**awryj** (6): She tries to sound like every alt R&B/trap artist rn so hard

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (6): Sure it sounds lush, but theres not any emotion, lyrics or catchiness to this song to carry it.

**natsby** (6): the verses are just so cringey

**nooodisaster** (6): Queen of counting to 3

**Glennishill** (5.3): It's fine. There's a good song in here somewhere but no one wanted to do the work to find it. Reputation is in this song a lot and it's like, jeez Taylor does your album have a theme?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): yeah i like sex jams only if they‚Äôre good

**TragicKingdom1** (5): I'm really mixed on this. On one hand it's a decent pop song but it's also so lurchy I can't really vibe with it.

**camerinian** (4): I did a number on this. The number is 4.

**SupremeShani** (4): I have no idea where this song is trying to go.

**thetimidmartian** (3): she barely sings throughout, and where she does sing she is heavily processed

**joshually** (1.5): Another weak song tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): so it goes away

**dirdbub** (1): fucken Mandela effect making me think this is a fake song. doesn't help that it sucks

##F I L L E R

**Albert\_Cole** (7.7): Filler but good

**jhxcb** (6.8): Taylor, you can do better. This is such a filler track. I don't even know why it's here. I like the instruments in the back, though.
 
**ComeOnAndSLANG** (6.5): filler but good filler. i like the song but never put it on myself

**skargardin** (6): Lyrically, this is a standout on reputation. It creates a certain kind of atmosphere and imagery with the lyrics about him being her ‚Äúmagician‚Äù and ‚Äúcut me into pieces‚Äù and so forth. It‚Äôs unfortunately in all other aspects a filler track, being very forgettable.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Arguably the only filler track on reputation.

**dwarfgourami** (2): I don‚Äôt understand this song's appeal at all, total filler

##B O R I N G

**whatareblackhole** (7): I'm so torn on So It Goes‚Ä¶ because the production is immaculate, but it's just‚Ä¶kind of‚Ä¶boring?

**topesmachine** (6.5): it's okay but kinda boring

**ignitethephoenix** (6): ‚ÄúScratches Down your back‚Äù woah Taylor calm down my Christian ears are now tainted. I do like how Taylor took a risk with the more sexual lyrics here, but she just sounds really bored in the song.

**theNealCutter** (6): this song just... passes. maybe it's Taylor's delivery? like she sounds so bored of herself, and the droney edm-trap production doesn't help.

**enecks** (5): The deadly secret of Reputation? It's mostly not bad, it's just boring. Honestly if they weren't both albums by heavily established acts trading in meta-commentary on media that were commerical failures, I wouldn't compare it to Witness, but instead Younger Now.
 
**EuphoricNeckbeard** (5): boring

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): boring

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (0): Fight me again. Incredibly boring, Taylor's worst song of all time.

##B O T H

**izeasklapaucius** (4): Boring-ass filler.

##F O R G E T T A B L E

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Kinda forgettable but I like every time I come back to it

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): Just forgettable except for the ‚Äòone, two, three‚Äô moment

**sletrab07** (6): There's nothing too wrong with this one, but... it just kinda comes and goes. Why isn't it more memorable?

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Not bad, just forgettable

**Mudkip1** (5): another dated song that's also really forgettable but it's not awful
 
**SkyBlade79** (5): kind of forgettable

**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): 4gettable

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (4): forgettable

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.1): At first this was one of the few tracks that I didn't like, but now its one of my favourites from the album. It just feels so sexy. I know that its filler and not as memorable as a lot of the other tracks but I still like it. I want to have sex to this song.

**Average:** 6.673 **// Total Points:** 1027.6 **// Controversy:** 2.480

It‚Äôs been a long, long, long, long time since I‚Äôve listened to a song so manufactured, so calculated, so destined to be a hit. Ed Sheeran! Future! Taylor Swift! Three of the biggest streaming artists collab and create the safest yet possibly strangest track on Reputation. It just doesn‚Äôt work. Nothing about this song works. I think Taylor forgot about the whole dilemma where there needs to be some sort of cohesion for a song to function correctly and be pleasing on the ears.

So imagine my shock when it flopped. There was also quite a bit of joy involved in that realization. In an attempt to corral a multitude of listeners from multiple different genres, Taylor manages to only sway her diehard fans. Well, here we finally are, at #34. End Game‚Äôs eliminated and nothing of value was lost in the process.

##I know you're probably sleepin'

**bbfan132** (10): Please give this song a chance! The instrumental in general is really mellow, and so is the chorus. Taylor's parts are excellent in that she has some sarcastic lyrics, as well as some romantic/serious lyrics. Also, the chorus has this dreamy feel to it that I love. Future's rap fits the theme of the song in that he is trying to catch the girl's attention, but he delivers his wishes in an interesting way. What I'm trying to say is that he explains his feelings in a way that makes his intentions clear, but he does it in a "masculine rapper" sort of way that surprisingly works well. Even Ed's verse is good and goes well with the song. It may be a cheesy song at times, but I still love it, and I hope that my rushed description of why I like it so much makes some sense.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember Pitchfork reviewed this song and they said what if this song was produced by Metro Boomin, it would have been way better and honestly, I agree. But other than that, this is still a bop and I really all of the verses here. Yes, even the verse from Future. LA DI DA DO DA. SLOB ON ME KNOB.
 
**dropthehammer11** (10): I'm gonna just say it: this is probably my favorite Taylor song. It's so goddamn catchy, the beat is super punchy, the features KILL it, Taylor does damn good on the hook and in her verse. I really love this song a lot.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is my favorite single from the album for sure. I love the almost Timbaland-like minimalist production on the song and a catchy hook catches the listener in. Who would have thought Future and Taylor would work really well together? Taylor‚Äôs rap verse is the highlight of the song in my opinion. The drama loves her.
 
**fifthchevron** (10): It took me a few listens to realise the song is formatted backwards. The lead singer‚Äôs verse is at the end and the rapper (who typically serves as a bridge) goes first. Future is uncharacteristically upbeat, Ed is talking shit about being controversial for his relationships (lol wut) but TAYLOR is the revelation here. She‚Äôs bucking every last stereotype about herself while taunting her critics with the hook (‚ÄúOoooooh and ya heard about me!‚Äù). The whole catch here is she crafted a song the public would make instant assumptions about then flipped it all on its head. She goes last, she‚Äôs yearning for real commitment, she‚Äôs partying with Future and goofing off with Ed but she‚Äôs got her long term man waiting at home. I find the instrumental quite emotional too, the synths. Also can we not overlook the utter brilliance of ‚ÄúI bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put them‚Äù. When will your faves sum up their lyrical legacy in 12 words or less?
 
**gannade** (10): I wish I could give this an 11... a mega bump. This is the highlight of all 3 artists discographies. Taylor's verse especially is def a career highlight.
 
**MashLuke** (10): is this what it's like to be rich and in love?

##I got this thing I keep thinkin'
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (9.5): originally i REALLY hated end game originally, but since it's grown on me. fun fact: i like future's part the least, and he's the best rapper out of the 3 lol. still, issa bop.
 
**cyborglilith** (9.5): First listen: this has no melody. 150th listen: okay I might like this a little. Morning/afternoon song.
 
**rickikardashian** (9.5): ngl i kinda liked this more after the video was released than before
 
**skargardin** (9.5): BIG REPUTATION is a massive hook and the song itself is filled with smart deliveries like ‚ÄúI hit you like BANG‚Äù, the ‚Äúah:s‚Äù and ‚Äúoh:s‚Äù, not to forget the subtle vocoder in the bridge, one of the few instances on reputation where I don‚Äôt mind it. Ed has a good presence but the same can‚Äôt be said for Future, who feels a bit misplaced, but he‚Äôs such a small part of the song that it hardly matters.
 
**VeganSquash** (9.5): I LOVED this song when it came out, but I've overplayed it too much. Still good tho.

##Yeah, I admit I been drinkin'
 
**leviswift13** (9.3): "And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em" is one of Taylor's all-time best lyrics.

##The void is back and unblinkin'
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): https://i.redd.it/rzjgq2ys1ha01.png big mood, also wig cause instead of the usual structure used when a pop queen features a rapper she switched it up. truly a queen
 
**ComeOnAndSLANG** (9): kinda of a major bop. expected this to be my least fav pre release but turned out the opposite
 
**fourchip** (9): this is like taylor‚Äôs 2nd (???) attempt at rapping and she still pulls it off better than the 2 rappers on this track
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): I really love this song (it‚Äôs super catchy) and I think it‚Äôs one of the better songs on the album. The ‚Äòbig reputation‚Äô part is so fun. Ed and Future‚Äôs parts work really well with they song too
 
**jonnl2806** (9): Ok so I kinda love this and I have no idea why it‚Äôs flopping so hard.
 
**Piccprincess** (9): I miss Taylor
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Like I said in the jukebox, this song should be a muddy and overbaked tragedy, but instead, in a weird and endearing way, it just bangs. Future is actually the weakest part of this, and while this is a far cry from the Taylor feat. Ed we saw on Everything Has Changed, it‚Äôs in good fun. And Taylor, man, I just really enjoy this rap, and I never thought I would say those words. The drums are a bit too weak and formulaic, but I can‚Äôt help but embrace the sheer absurdity of this entire situation, and I am eagerly waiting for a chance to surround myself with the wrath of a thousand girls screeching in unison to ‚ÄúBIG REPUTATION!‚Äù
 
**therokinrolla** (9): The worst part of this song is the chorus. Where all the other parts are epic in their own way, and where all the features are actually GOOD, the chorus slows it down, breaks it down, and is frankly generic. So that's where the one point went. The other 9 points are a culmination of lyrics that slay, production that snatches, and verses that are some of the best of the year. All three of the verses are really really great, they all sound awesome, they all sound like they are having fun. First listen, the "Big Reputation" part made me want to die. Second listen on, the "Big Reputation" part is one of the best things to come out of the album. Its dramatic, but it works and it is now my favorite part of the song.

##I cannot stop the airplane from crashin'
 
**followingfreeways** (8.5): started out hating this song especially the "big reputation" part...now it's one of my favorite car jams. I'm disappointed I didn't see the greatness in this song when rep first dropped
 
**melodyllic\_** (8.5): too many cooks spoil the broth i guess??
 
**zamomattel** (8.5): future ruined ciara's career and now this

##And we circle down from the sky
 
**banananaise** (8): it's hilarious that this is the single which is flopping, given that it's probably the only track i'll admit to liking
 
**bwc222** (8): worst part is ed... yet again
 
**CarlieScion** (8): They all actually have good flows in this? I bury hatches but keep maps of where I put them IS ICONIC
 
**chipsi1** (8): :straight people emoji:
 
**dirdbub** (8): this is like the thesis statement for an essay on overexposure
 
**kromosol** (8): Definitely top 5 for me. Surprisingly, Ed and Future aren't ruining this song even if they are included just to get a hit. Still flopping though
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I really like the vibe of this. Good job y‚Äôall.
 
**OriginalKappa** (8): will be last because popheads hates ed
 
**poppinmmolly** (8): one of my least faves on the album. It's still a bop though.
 
**specfagular** (8): A LOT better than what I expected tbh considering the features.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (8): A bit generic and trendchasey but executed okay

deleted: ##Yeah, so hang on me

**theNealCutter** (8): i love how dirty the beats while still sounding chill and smooth. as much as I like how it sounds, the lyrics are kinda off. Future ruins the song, Ed Sheeran is trying his best to redeem it, and at least Taylor knows how she should sound. it's nice, but it can be better.

**vayyiqra** (8): great except the rap

**vhqv1997** (8): Would have been a 10 if it weren't for Ed and his awfully clunky verse

**Albert\_Cole** (7.2): Unlike most people, I liked Shape of You. I attend university with Surrey types like Ed Sheeran. I do not hate him instinctively. However, his verse **is the worst thing to happen to music ever**. Taylor's verse is p good tho

**crowlily** (7.2): it's a cool song but not very good

##hang on me

**jhxcb** (7.1): Taylor and Ed aren't the worst rappers in the world, which is surprising. It took me a while to warm up to this song, but it's pretty decent. I don't think it deserves the attention it got in the beginning and it only coasted on it's features.

##hang on me

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (7): Its catchy. That iss all it really has going for it. who is this song for? Unless you have a big reputation, its kinda hard to relate. woo.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): and this one

**dwarfgourami** (7): Cute but both guest verses are unnecessary

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (7): Love that ‚Äúbig reputation‚Äù hook, like the rest of it except for Ed. What is he doing here lol

**ImADudeDuh** (7): It's fun and the "Big Reputation" part is catchy, but when Ed Sheeran has the best verse on this song :thinking:

**itsboogiepanda** (7): Honestly the only redeeming feature is Ed's verse (yeah come at me popheads). The whole 'big reputation big reputation' is just cringey.

**natsby** (7): the structure is somewhat interesting and so is the novelty of Ed Sheeran and Taylor rapping...

**robbiec\_** (7): someone said the other day somewhere about Stormzy being in place of Ed and honestly... also Taylor songs cute here

**stardustanddinos** (7): The song‚Äôs structuring is so weird, but it works beautifully. The post-chorus is catchy as hell. It‚Äôs a little long, lyrics feel a little clunky, but I love it! Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be classic like her older songs, but it‚Äôs a great song.

##cause you and me

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): too bad this song isn't just the hook and chorus huh

**nooodisaster** (6.5): www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/1/14/16883112/taylor-swift-end-game-music-video-ed-sheeran-future-frame-by-frame

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I hated this song when it came out, but it is the definition of an earworm.

##we‚Äôre not meant for this world

**acedino** (6): I went from hating this song to loving and now I'm somewhere in the middle. I usually end up skipping straight to Taylor's last verse now.

**camirose** (6): I will defend the campy cheerleader intro until the day I die, but the placement of everything throughout the song feels weird and it doesn‚Äôt go as far as it should into bop territory given the ensemble‚Ä¶

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): Was Future really necessary here? The answer to that my friends, is no, no he was not.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): i can't take her seriously when she says 'I've got some BIG enemies'. Also, Sheerapping

**SpanKKy1** (6): an obvious commercial reach that however falls short

**topesmachine** (6): this song's alright but the features are unnecessary and ed sheeran's in particular is bad

**twat\_brained** (6): This is far from my favorite song on "Reputation", and to be honest I don't even know if it's good to begin with. I love the chorus but Ed doesn't need to rap on his verse. Speaking of which, Future does NOT need to be in the song at all. It feels fillery but of course since it's got a double collab of COURSE it's the third single. I just hope "Delicate" or "Dress" can save this era for Taylor.

**VodkaInsipido** (6): tbh should‚Äôve been a hit

##You and me

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): Eh. Chorus is kinda catchy tho.

##we‚Äôre not meant for this world

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): another grower, i think it's not bad but runs on for too long and just kinda exists

**awryj** (5): This song is a disappointment

**DraculaWeekend** (5): I wanna be your end game, I wanna be your first strain, I wanna be your inseam

**letsallpoo** (5): "i hit you like BANG" gets my dick rock hard

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Fun enough, and Future is surprisingly the worst rapper on this track. It was obviously curated to be a hit, though. It may be a thrill listening to this, admittedly, but the good parts aren't enough to avoid a 'meh' reaction after the song ends. Literally the definition of average.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): honestly i think this could've been better without future being annoying. or maybe taylor

**TragicKingdom1** (5): This song is all over the place. A common theme throughout the album for me is how there are some good parts but it's rare that anything comes together fully...and that couldn't be more true for this song. There are 6 distinct components of the song (pre-chorus, chorus, post-chorus/chant, then the 3 verses) and none of them really flow together. That being said, I don't think the pre-chorus, chorus or even Future's verse are all that bad in isolation. This is easily a bottom 2 performance by Ed ever though (the worst being New Man ofc).

##I know you hate my hysterics

**1313Harbor** (4): I just really dislike all parts of this song except Taylor‚Äôs. I thought it would grow on me, but it hasn‚Äôt.

**m4ttycool** (4): Get out of here Ed (and Future)

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): A mixed bag were the good gets cancelled out by the awful.

**quaerex** (4): Codeine cowboy and ginger Satan somehow made this song worse. Her verse is the best part of it.

**SkyBlade79** (4): the only good part about this is big reputation

**tevinterimperium** (4): Future really phoned it in on this one, huh

**theburningundead** (4): (ooh) I never want to hear the words "big reputation" ever again (ah)

**thetimidmartian** (4): future adds nothing and it just doesnt work out, cramming that many artists in. the belting throughout, but especially toward the end, is thin and unsupported.

**whatareblackhole** (4): Ughhhh the "I don't wanna touch you‚Ä¶" melody is SO GOOD, I wish it would get lifted out of this song and put in another

##I promise this time is different

**camerinian** (3): When a Future guest verse doesn‚Äôt even make the Top 5 things wrong with your song, you know you‚Äôve seriously buggered something up

**strawberryswing1** (3): UGH, "BIG REPUTATION, BIG REPUTATION" is the dumbest thing to happen to music in a minute. Ed Sheeran is sadly the best part of this song.

##I won't cry wolf in the kitchen

**kappyko** (2): This sounds like music made for stupid people LMAO

**MrSwearword** (2): mixed metaphors and subpar songwriting from Taylor? groundbreaking. If Future is the best part of the song, you've got a BIG PROBLEM. At least the production tried something.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2): Honestly, alot of my problems with Ready for It can go under this one too. Some of my least favorite Max Martin production (continuing to prove that Max Martin should be kept away from trap snares), pretty bad pseudo-rapping by Taylor, and the inexplicable and grating "BIG REPUTATION" hook. You can practically see Future's check dangling in front of him for a throwaway feature, the level of effort here is about even with his verse on that Maroon 5 song. Ed's part is just kind of Ed. There is nothing here that I like at all, yikes.

##Just please, oh, please don't hang up yet

**MissyBee37** (1.2): Ugh. There really isn't anything I like about this song. "I hit you like bang" is proof the lyricist I used to love is "dead" indeed, & "I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me" is worth nothing but an eye roll from me.

##I cannot stop the taxi cab from crashin'

 
**CreepyMannequin** (1): What an ugly song.

**enecks** (1): If you amalgamated the worst of 2017 pop into one song you'd get this. Future's verse is aggressively bland, and the hi-hats dull the impact of the synths - we don't want another 1989 that wouldn't be trendy and cynical enough. Yet what makes this horrific is Ed Sheeran's verse- Ed's image (and yes, reputation) doesn't fit a borderline rap verse in which he rambles about his reputation. Bullshit, you have a reputation as a millionaire who takes people to cheap buffets and sniffs their cumsheets. This feels like a song with barely enough material for an interlude padded to more than 4 minutes with garbage verses. It's a modern Birthday Cake - no scratch that, at least I can slut drop to that song.

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (1): y'all know i love future but this song sucks and he deserves his share of the blame

**joshually** (1): So bad.... so bad.... I dislike Future & Ed's voice in this, and in general.

**Mudkip1** (1): i'll never understand how she thought these first 3 songs were acceptable on an album. this shit's nails on a chalkboard

##and only lovers will survive
 
**Glennishill** (0): I despise this song. In my mind, this is when I stopped loving Taylor Swift as a real, genuine pop artist after falling for her with RED and began to think of her as a cringe-y, self-obsessed narcissist. I literally cringe everytime I hear the "BIG REPUTATION" parts. This song is Taylor at her most-repetitive and least original. Every time I think this song starts to end, she starts rapping again and part of my soul dies.
 
**Raykel** (0): There are no redeeming qualities about this song. It's not catchy at all, in fact the aaahs and ooohs sound annoying. Taylor and Ed sound like they're trying too hard, and Future sounds uninspired. You hear the "I only did this for the money" in his voice and I can't even blame him.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (0): Ed Sheeran Rapping.

**These Really Are Those Good 'Ole Days :crying:**
--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): adorable

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): A Macklemore song I actually like, Wow

**CarlieScion** (10): Hot take - this is better than any song on Rainbow. P.S. Kesha and Macklemore looks like siblings

**dirdbub** (10): finally, some GOOD music

**jhxcb** (9.3): Really sweet song. I like the melodic nature of this song, even though there's a lot of "rap".

**leviswift13** (9.3): Aww I love this!

**itsboogiepanda** (9): Macklemore and Kesha really compliment each other

**jonnl2806** (9): Kesha and Macklemore both sound great on this

**1313Harbor** (8.5): Kesha sings Macklemore under a table in this song, but it‚Äôs still fun.

**quaerex** (8.5): A bittersweet song about the pain of growing up. Macklemore and Kesha actually sound really good, and the nostalgia fits my current mood. It‚Äôs great.

**camerinian** (8): I can still vibe with low-key Macklemore tbh, and the two complement each other really well. Why tf is the chorus two bars short tho

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is actually pretty good! I definitely love the chorus and Macklemore sounds alright here.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): God, I miss Macklemore

**skargardin** (8): Cute nostalgia-driven track, not much else to say about it.

**SupremeShani** (8): I have an irrational dislike of Macklemore, but I will listen to anything with Kesha.

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): I want a solo version

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Macklemore's album was pretty forgettable, but this was definitely one of the strongest efforts from it. The two definitely have chemistry, and sell the sweet vibe and nostalgic theme well.

**topesmachine** (8): wow! a macklemore song i can stand! it's a shock

**vhqv1997** (8): I'd prefer it if this were just Kesha

**crowlily** (7.7): I like the lyrics. rap usually ain't my cup of tea but this seems meaningful and pretty good. I love the sentimentality

**Meh Days**
---

**Albert\_Cole** (7.5): Yikes why does Macklemore sound like he's spent the years since Thrift Shop chain-smoking

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): it feels reductive, i've heard songs like this a million times before

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the Mack but this is a pretty decent track and Kesha kills the chorus

**MrSwearword** (7): above par but still corny

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): When I was in the third grade, I thought I was gay.

**tevinterimperium** (7): I wish he would mackle less

**vayyiqra** (7): upstaged by guest star

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): Kesha is great on this track, Macklemore is just ok.

**cyborglilith** (6): crying rn

**Glennishill** (6): It's nice but it's kind of forgettable.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This was kinda plain, I kinda liked it then I kinda hated it, now I kinda like it again, but still, if I never heard this again I won't cry.

**melodyllic\_** (6): a cute message but a forgettable song. macklemore's mediocrity strikes again

**OriginalKappa** (6): macklemore is bad but kesha is very good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): When I was in the 3rd grade I thought I could make music without Ryan Lewis

**whatareblackhole** (6): Ughhhhh I hate Macklemore!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate his dumb voice!!!!! But this is cute‚Ä¶

**Macklemore? Should've Been Mackleless/snore**
---

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): Sorry Kesha but Macklemores bland, boring ass is just too much of a drag for you to save it, still singing her heart out though

**fourchip** (5): mediocrity. kesha‚Äôs part is boring and crackermore is forgettable

**Piccprincess** (5): me before playing this track: wow I actually like this song / me after: what the fuck

**thetimidmartian** (5): i dont know why kesha is going on tour with macklemore, she's great but even she cant make him worth listening to

**ulikejazz** (5): straight meh

**deadspiderwall** (4.5): I don't like this song

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): One of the better songs on Gemini tbh, but it's still not good. Macklemore's verses have more energy than Kesha's chorus which is a huge problem.

**camirose** (4): This song is too much of a cliche to score any higher.

**hikkaru** (4): macklesnore

**natsby** (4): If this were just Kesha my rating might be much higher.

**Elitefourbrad** (3): Macklemore is boring as fuck and Kesha does not sell this hook.

**enecks** (3): Oh Kesha what are you doing

**izeasklapaucius** (2): yawn

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this song makes me cringe but i listened to the kids bop version yesterday and got goose bumps

**strawberryswing1** (1): shit that is only on the radio because who sings it

bitch lmao sksksksksks this is Kesha‚Äôs first song!! aaahahahahahhahah. and why this??!??!?! of all the songs on her album??!??!? godzilla exists! nevertheless, Kesha‚Äôs currently sitting pretty. she‚Äôs got her entire album practically while Taylor and Katy are down to their bare essentials.

i‚Äôm not too familiar with Kesha‚Äôs album compared to the other two women so I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve not had to write about any until now

also i‚Äôm a flop i used lyrics from a hymn earlier as a bad joke that wasn‚Äôt related to the earlier song at all and i didn‚Äôt even realize that this song was sitting right here. oh well

##Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): again, such a cute song. just nice to have on while you're by yourself to give you a smile. i love kesha wow

**joshually** (10): A true anthem for the hymnless (including myself)

**MashLuke** (10): this is like Wild Things if Alessia cursed more

**skargardin** (10): ‚ÄúI know that I‚Äôm perfect even though I‚Äôm fucked up‚Äù is just one of the many great lines in this song and on Rainbow as a whole. I love how utterly feel-good this song is.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): bop

**vhqv1997** (10): invented religion

**VodkaInsipido** (10): the best song in this album

**whatareblackhole** (10): This song reminds me of late summer and it hurts because I'm graduating from college and leaving my friends in May and I'll always think of them with this song. :(

##This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (9.9): the weakest point of the album and i still love it. the only bad thing about it is the end of the second verse, it really irks me ears

**twat\_brained** (9.8): The beauty of this track is that Kesha is putting her soul into this song, but the song isn't trying to constantly remind you of that.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): a n t h e m

**jonnl2806** (9.5): ‚ÄúI know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up‚Äù I needed this in my life so much and it couldn‚Äôt have come at a better point in my life.

**quaerex** (9.5): This was the first time I listened to this song and oh my god. This should have been a proper single. The chorus is incredible and it gives me actual chills. ‚ÄúFlying down the highway / Backseat of the Hyundai‚Äù is going to be stuck in my head for weeks.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Not gonna lie, this could have actually been a better choice as opening track than Bastards. The production is top notch, the lyrics are catchy/simple without being vapidly positive (Hi, Roar)! I don‚Äôt really have anything bad to say.

**itsboogiepanda** (9): This is good

**followingfreeways** (8.5): Reminds me so much of old Kesha, in a good way. this is a bop and I would have bopped to this in 2010 just the same and I think that's why I love this so much

**crowlily** (8.3): I love how this sounds! The production is so my style! This song is wonderful idk how else to say this. The high ooooh is great! Instant favorite.

**jhxcb** (8.2): Lyrically, I really like this. Melodically, it's pretty good. The instruments behind her seem really lacking. There's nothing wrong with having less, but it makes it feel like there's something missing from this song, and I think there was a 10 in there at some point.

**kromosol** (8.2): An underrated empowerment anthem.

**leviswift13** (8.1): I think there could've been more sophistication in the lyrics, but the chorus is pop perfection.

##For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): A wonderfully produced song, but the "hymn for the weird kids" is well tread grounds by Kesha already.
 
**dropthehammer11** (8): A subdued song with some powerful vocals. Great tune.

**natsby** (8): this song is just so clever

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Damn. This is super powerful

**nooodisaster** (8): The closest we'll ever get to "$" Kesha again. It's really wholesome how she wrote this for her fans.

**rickikardashian** (8): Someone described this song as Kesha trying to write a song for a group of marginalized people, but not knowing which one to write to, and it is ture, but that‚Äôs kind of what I like about it. I love how it‚Äôs just ‚Äúthe hymn for the hymnless‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you feel like that because your friends don‚Äôt text you as much or if you‚Äôre at the lowest point of human life, this song is just about everyone that feels somewhat left out standing with and for each other.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): I really like the melody and vocal inflections but the songwriting and production feel a little lazy otherwise.
 
**zamomattel** (7.5): srry kesha i am not religious
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): virgins can relate
 
**CarlieScion** (7): This song is what a Halsey-Little Mix baby would sound like
 
**enecks** (7): I want to like this song more than I do. It's a great concept for a song especially within the album - a hymn for the hymnless. I want a hymn to pray. But this is too artificial given the country and rock style live instrumnetation that gives the rest of the album either energy, emotional impact, or sometimes both.
 
**hikkaru** (7): it‚Äôs like the 329849023th time Kesha has done a song like this but it‚Äôs alright
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Now this song really got shit when it first came out. It was the last song to come out before the album and it came out after Praying, Woman, and Learn to Let Go, 3 songs that are noticably better than this one. However, this song still isn't bad!
 
**milkywayinradius** (7): I don‚Äôt really like the ‚Äúhymn hymn hymn for how we live live live‚Äù part but still a decent song
 
**stardustanddinos** (7): The message of this song was so beautiful. Love it!
 
**theNealCutter** (7): for some reason, it sounds inspired by Pure Heroine-Lorde, but vague lyrics instead. Like it's a hymn for the people you care about, but what is it a hymn about?
 
**thetimidmartian** (7): i like that bouncy bass, kesha really knows how to right an anthem
 
**vayyiqra** (7): nice
 
**VeganSquash** (7): so is Kesha religious or not? what is the truth

##You can never go too far when you can't come back hoME AGAIIN

**awryj** (6.8): This song feels more like classic Kesha, which is... fine? I guess

**camerinian** (6.5): I mean this is one of the more generic inspirational tracks on here, but dang if that hook melody isn‚Äôt sticky

**deadspiderwall** (6.5): nice beat

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): The definition of a passable filler. The verses is boring but the last chorus is my life tbh.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I have to say Kesha has done anthems for all the "weird kids" that were much more moving and memorable.

**chipsi1** (6): this sounds like a badlands halsey song

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): One of the lower points, nice synthy song, the snaps remind me of Royals (i think) but I think the soul and folk stuff on this album is better to me

**fourchip** (6): unfortunately this is like... the 7th song kesha has done in this vein, a song for the outcasts, rejects, etc (crazy kids, we r who we r) and while i respect that and love kesha it‚Äôs just gotten tired

**melodyllic\_** (6): "hymn for the hymnless" will forever remain awkward, like me

**PenOrAPencil** (6): I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúthis is a hymn hymn hymn for how we live live live‚Äù part

**SpanKKy1** (6): a hymn for mediocrity maybe

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I was extremely hyped for this album after the first three great singles we got, and then Kesha dropped this mediocrity on us. The lyrics are unfeeling to me, and the boring post-chorus only supports this. The chorus, while /r/im14andthisisdeep material, is solid, and the guitar work in the bridge is probably my favorite part of the track. But, still, this is a massive step down from what I heard prior to it. Sorry, Kesha.

**Raykel** (5.5): I don't know if it's just me but this weirdly tries to sound like a trap song. It's so off.

**strawberryswing1** (5.5): i appreciate this but don't enjoy it

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (5): corny af

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): Meh. The chorus is good but the rest of the song is a bit redudant.

**TheLastAxolotl** (5): It sounds like something you've heard before that you always forget

**Piccprincess** (4.5): im sorry but its just not good it's not even a hymn

**Albert\_Cole** (4): Can nobody except Madonna make religious allusions sound fun? This isn't quite as bad as "Take Me To Church", but it's just... dull. Not like boring - just, like a dull knife.
 
**dirdbub** (4): it's pleasant, but very forgettable. I never really got the hype around this song
 
**Elitefourbrad** (4): The mixing on Kesha‚Äôs vocals is very weird on this track for whatever reason. I like the message, but I feel like it‚Äôs trying to hard to be woke.
 
**Glennishill** (4): Ugh, this song is so close to being great but it's so messy. Her vocals during the verses are so slippery and I absolutely hate "I know that I'm perfect even though I'm fucked up" as a sentiment because it's such a basic bitch mindset.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): The lyrics are a complete miss for me.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): I'd call this the only below average song on Rainbow, because the tone is overly simplistic in a bad way, and I think the last few songs expressed the message Kesha's trying to give here better. That being said, I love the line 'I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up'. That line means a lot to me as somebody with mental illness, even if I don't like the rest of the track.

OKAY SO i have a confession to make. This song deserves at least a 3. I apologize for giving it a 1. The chorus is beautiful and the ‚ÄòKing of my heart, body and soul‚Äô part gets stuck in my head a lot even though I couldn‚Äôt recite any other part of this song. lol. BUT the production in the verse is sooo bad. like, inexcusably bad. it‚Äôs a skrillex-esque early 2010‚Äôs dubstep garbage kinda bad.

For all you dedicated hoes who actually read these, you‚Äôll be happy to know that this is Taylor‚Äôs last song out today! woohoo! and yes, this means Ready For It actually survives to Day 2. truly a disaster

**acedino** (11): My favourite from my very first listen of Reputation and probably ranks within my top 5 Taylor songs ever.

**itsboogiepanda** (11): Anyone who denies this is the best, most outstanding, catchiest, most perfect song off Reputation is deaf or just plain don't have taste (which given that this rate is on r/popheads it is quite likely). I love everything about this song, from the little hi-hats in the 'salute to me' part to the delightful chorus with the 'woooahh.' The highlight of this masterpiece is the bridge, where Taylor makes even the straightest of men lisp by signing along to the lyrics 'up on the roof with a school girl crruuush/drinking beer out of plastic cuuuupppsss'.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): amazing song, and i had that "me: yeah sorry boy im living that #singlelife find someone else me a week later: please adopt a baby and move to portland to make wine for the rest of our lives" thing not so long after the album came out lol

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): https://imgur.com/a/MjqK8#pJ5NMsM this has to be a single

**jimmy345960** (10): Another song I sing to me by me. It's an experimental bop that makes me feel good about myself :)

**jonnl2806** (10): The prechorus on this song is the best thing on the entire album tbh

**joshually** (10): You know who's king of my heart? BURGER KING... which is why I will probably have cardiac arrest relatively soon.... pls send help

**melodyllic\_** (10): a underrated bop!! why!!! is it the post-chorus breakdown? cause that's genius!! the acoustic guitar in the second pre-chorus is genius! her harmonies! why was this slandered

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my slut-drop-pussy-destroying anthem
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): this is my 2nd favorite off of reputation. I love that it's so hopeful and I adore the production on this.

**SpanKKy1** (10): @shawn

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.5): The "Is this the end of all the endings?" bridge is easily the best part of the song.

**natsby** (9): this song is not perfect by any means, but it's so interesting and that bridge is so fun. I am mildly frustrated by how unclear the 'salute to me I'm your american queen' lyric is though - it still sounds like 'prove to me I'm your american queen' no matter how many times I listen to it

**Piccprincess** (9): I miss Taylor

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Something about this song just grabbed me from first listen

**rickikardashian** (8.7): adds another song to the list of songs saved by an amazing bridge

**followingfreeways** (8.5): throwback to the dark days when I couldn't stand this song..it's definitely grown on me and it's a fun bop. I loveee the bridge

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is actually one of my favorite songs from Reputation to listen to, because I love Taylor's joy, I love the sudden themes of optimism and recovery, and the prechorus is amazing and one of the best things she's ever done. That being said, everything else ranges from 'fine' to 'terrible'. These are some of the worst lyrics she's ever put to paper and the drop is disappointing. I'm going to have lower my score down a notch.

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): I actually really like the drums

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): An underrated song on the album

**SkyBlade79** (8): the vocoder is really nice and the production is good too, no cringy lyrics to be found

**vhqv1997** (8): I didn't like this until my fifth listen. That bridge tho

**crowlily** (7.8): AND ALL AT ONCE

**Albert\_Cole** (7.6): I feel like Max Martin wasn't even trying here. But then again, Max Martin's "not even trying" is still decent, and at least there are lyrics here

**cyborglilith** (7.5): The verses, pre-chorus, and chorus do not blend together well. The bridge simply does nothing for me. Afternoon song.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I really the acoustic guitar mixed with the electronic production. It‚Äôs just a bit too repetitive however.

**MashLuke** (7.5): explosive love song

**jhxcb** (7.1): More filler tracks, but it's pretty original, to Taylor at least. I think it is, like, technically good and well written, but it comes off without the emotion it needs.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (7): It feels like the song was constructed around the hook, but that‚Äôs fine when the hook is as strong as this one. Don‚Äôt like that prechorus.

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): I actually loved this song so much at first but as time passed I‚Äôve slowly mellowed out on it and now it‚Äôs at the point where it‚Äôs just okay.

**skargardin** (7): I wasn‚Äôt a fan of this until I read the amazing reputation AOTY writeup. It made me realize that it‚Äôs actually got some depth to it. But my god, the vocoder in this song is just too much.

**theNealCutter** (7): I like the sentiment... but the disjointed sounds with each different part of the song make it feel very incoherent.

**VeganSquash** (7): It really needed another verse or something, because its a bit repetitive

**zamomattel** (7): one of my least favourites, i just can't find strong feelings about this one

**camerinian** (6.5): This is one of the best hooks on the album, but holy shit if there was ever a song that desperately needed to not be T R A P I N F L U E N C E D

**CarlieScion** (6): The chorus ruins the song

**CreepyMannequin** (6): Drags a bit, but still pretty solid

**dirdbub** (6): the percussion of the chorus makes me nutt but the rest of the song is meh

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): This isn‚Äôt bad, but this style of production does her zero favors.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): good parts and boring parts

**kappyko** (5.5): I love, love, love the drumbeats on this chorus. The verses and pre-choruses ruin it, though.

**nooodisaster** (5.5): I've listened to this song 3 times for this rate and still can't tell you what it sounds like. filler.

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (5): Overplays the vocoder. There seems to be too many different things happening, with dissonant verse, chorus, post chorus, and drops. Super forgettable, with forgettable generic lyrics to match only made memorable by Taylor annoying delivery.

**fifthchevron** (5): Some of her best lyrics in the bridge. It's weird to not have a chorus tying everything together, but I love the passion of the whole song itself.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this feels like a remix of an existing song???

**izeasklapaucius** (5): Meh. That drop is good, I gotta say.

**robbiec\_** (5): I hate the pre-chorus but I love the chorus and then hate the drop but love the vocal effect that appears on the album a few times so we'll break even at five

**DraculaWeekend** (4.5): The lyrics and prechorus are not good

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This is just a mess of a bunch of different sounds put together and it does not work at all.

**MissyBee37** (4): Forgettable‚Ä¶ right up until it becomes more rap-adjacent cringe.

**MrSwearword** (4): oh great, another song that sucks with a terrible lyric about Rovers. At least the Imogen Heap realness helps her vocals again.

**SupremeShani** (4): I really do hate this song for some reason, the prechorus sounds so clunky, the chorus just bores me, and I hate the lyrics.

**thetimidmartian** (4): sounds like much of the filler on the album; too much vocoder, too little singing.

**awryj** (3.5): I'm a sucker for vocoders but the rest of the song is so jarring and overproduced

**quaerex** (3.5): I detest this song. It‚Äôs boring. The bridge is the only redeeming quality KOMH has.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (3): filler

**enecks** (3): So this is one of the worse bits of production in the album - a desperate attempt for trap cred for a song with lyrics that don't fit the production at all.

**Glennishill** (2.5): Woof, this song. That annoying vocal effect from Delicate comes back to glorious effect here. Pretty messy and cringe-y with these lyrics.

**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): A good pop song buried under terrible production choices. The "drop" doesn't work at all. Also the bridge is awful.

**specfagular** (2): I don‚Äôt like her at all. Flop of My Heart, body and so-ooo-woah-oul

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.2): make like King Louis XVI instead

**Mudkip1** (1): another insanely dated song i don't understand who told her this still sounded good??? this literally sounds like someone's farting

## Bow, chicka, bow-wow!

**1313Harbor** (10): ‚ÄúI just wanna dance like a mother fucker, yeah!‚Äù is literally my life motto. Also, did Kesha write the Pepsi line into the song specifically so she could be in a Super Bowl commercial??? The conspiracy theory of our time.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): same as Let 'Em Talk. I really love Kesha.
 
**awryj** (10): EA Games found bankrupt, QT found flat
 
**chipsi1** (10): this is like the 3rd best song on the album
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is the kind of campy fun i love from her
 
**cyborglilith** (10): she sounds bitchy; I love it
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I am not sure if people like this song or not but I am giving it a 10 cause fuck it. Also, the shitpost link for this song better be BOOGIE by BROCKHAMPTON.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (10): Pepsi commercial teas! Anyways, the fun, pop rock style on this album really comes to life here. Just let your hair down and dance for a change, don‚Äôt think about anyone else!
 
**enecks** (10): This is like Dirty Love 2 how the fuck could I not like it?
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Singing along to kesha going "Dance with Me!" is the closest I've ever felt to a drunk valley girl at a college party.
 
**joshually** (10): This reminds me of Thriller by MJ for some reason, and I am into it.
 
**kappyko** (10): This is literally "MANiCURE" if it was good fuck off I hope this wins some fucking how
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Kesha is one of the few people who can make this song work.
 
**PenOrAPencil** (10): I might be in the minority here but I think that this is the best track on the album.
 
**specfagular** (10): Do I stan Eagles of Death Metal? AM I scared of those Boogie Feet? The world may never know
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): megabop
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): I LOVE THIS STUPID SONG.

##That's what my baby says!
 
**followingfreeways** (9.5): HER VOICE WAS MEANT FOR THIS SONG!!!!!!!! this song is whack af and I LOVE it
 
**fourchip** (9.5): dance with me, dance with me, please
 
**SupremeShani** (9.5): This is one of the most bizarre songs off the album, I love that ridiculous call and response from Kesha and Jesse in the chorus.

##Mow-mow-mow!
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): it's like a better boogie feet
 
**Brendon-Urine** (9): Eagles of Death Metal's contribution on this album is so good. Kesha's sassiness is perfect.
 
**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (9): Great guitars again, but "shake my butt" sounds a bit juvenile and, the dance with me gets repeated just a bit too much
 
**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Just like Let Em Talk this bangs
 
**melodyllic\_** (9): let em talk 2.0 i aint complaining
 
**nooodisaster** (9): HA! This song is soooooooooooooooooo grooooooooovy.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): bop.com.org.co.uk

##And my heart starts pumping!
 
**kromosol** (8.5): Reminds me of Warrior era Kesha. Total bop !!!
 
**Raykel** (8.5): The way she says "dance with me dance with me" is such ear candy. I love how her voice shakes when singing "are you scared of these boogie feet?" The ending bridge makes you get up out of your chair. This is song is just so much fun.
 
**stardustanddinos** (8.5): Holy shit, this is Kesha at her best. The foot-tapping beat and the funny fucking lyrics are so her. Love it!
 
**jhxcb** (8.2): Super catchy, but she does a little weird thing with her voice. Kinda baby-voice or something. Had to knock off a little for that.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.2): there are moments in this where I feel like it‚Äôs just random noises in the song. Poor mastering? Perhaps.

##Chicka-chicka choo wap!
 
**Albert\_Cole** (8): I like it but I don't know why, these lyrics are even stupider than the Animal era
 
**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (8): this is tragic but i've come to like it
 
**MashLuke** (8): we love a hillbilly prom song
 
**poppinmmolly** (8): serving The Veronicas
 
**robbiec\_** (8): BANG SLAPPER I RUN TO THIS
 
**skargardin** (8): It‚Äôs fun but it falls a bit flat in the chorus for me, I love the verses though. The small details like the soda popping after the pepsi line and so forth.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): Didn't like it at first, but it has steadily grown into a guilt pleasure.
 
**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Decent rock song with attitude
 
**theNealCutter** (8): it's a weird bop. I know. I've listened to this song many times, but I still don't understand what's it about. Still though, it's an infectious bop.
 
**therokinrolla** (8): its really a shame that those cheerleader verses accompany the excellent feature and chorus. The verses are SO irritating, but everything else in the song excels, so whatever.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): this is a bop
 
**vhqv1997** (8): Fun and wacky, sounds a bit like Ke$ha but with the maturity of Kesha
 
**zamomattel** (8): this is such a mood

##Never gonna stop!
 
**camerinian** (7.5): I like this song quite a bit but imma be real, like 75% of my plays of it on Spotify are just because it‚Äôs next alphabetically after Boogie by Brockhampton
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): pretty bop
 
**topesmachine** (7.5): i am a little scared of those boogie feet but in like a hot way
 
**crowlily** (7.3): I'm gaping. This is surprising. And fun. It's SO FUN! I love it!

**leviswift13** (7.1): I still don't fully understand, but I applaud the weirdness.

##Gitchee gitchee goo means that I love you!

**dropthehammer11** (7): Y'all are too mean to this song, it's so damn fun and carefree, I love the positive energy

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): Miss Kesha was kind of giving me RPDR Season 2 rock song teas...and I kinda lived for it. Do your thing sis!

**izeasklapaucius** (7): ok good song but did she (or her producer) just put mario coin sound effect when she says COMPUTER game? Other than that, another good contribution from EoDM.

**sletrab07** (7): The chorus is equal parts dope and stupid. Kesha brings the right level of attitude to the hook at the end of the chorus, so she just saves it.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I appreciate that she‚Äôs trying something different but it feels like 10 different music genres in this song.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): who asked for this

**SkyBlade79** (6): bad outro, annoying male voice, horrible verses‚Ä¶ but something about this is so charming

**TragicKingdom1** (6): This is the worst song on the album imo; it's just kind of a mess. Kesha revives her 2010 vocal inflections, I'm not really sure what the hook is supposed to be, and despite it being called "Boogie Feet" I can't imagine dancing to it. Eagles of Death Metal's instrumental sounds great though.

**twat\_brained** (5.8): Why's she trying to sound like Marina on the bridge? Also is that meant to be a Halloween-esque voice when she sings the title? Just feels out of place.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): Yeah, this is like Kesha's old music for me. It's fun to dance to when I get my daily sugar rush, but as a song it's not that good. Shame Eagles of Death Metal didn't get another feature on a more deserving song.

**quaerex** (5.5): This second collab isn‚Äôt as good as the first. ‚ÄúShake my butt‚Äù is just a little too awkward, honestly.

**camirose** (5): This feels like a song I want to play every Halloween after Monster Mash and I kind of love it for that‚Ä¶

**CarlieScion** (5): Why are the songs featuring Eagles of Death Metal so weird?

**dwarfgourami** (5): This is definitely the weaker EODM song, it feels like filler

**jonnl2806** (5): Meh

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): Really the only miss on this album for me. The hook is easily the worst on here, the lyrics in the verses are pretty bad, and Kesha can't really salvage it vocally. Just kind of a mess and I would have probably cut it.

**MissyBee37** (4): Yes, Kesha, I am a little scared of these boogie feet.

**thetimidmartian** (4): she can clearly sing, sometimes she chooses not to

**Glennishill** (3): There's a lot going on here and I like none of it. This sounds like a song Kesha wrote and performed in the shower.

**Mudkip1** (3): ehhhhhhhhhhh nah

**VodkaInsipido** (3): kesha what were you thinking of

**gannade** (2): The store brand, walmart-next-to-a-trailer-park-version of Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend.

##bUT BAYBEE I LAYYYCCEDDD  IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTT

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): Goodbye. Kesha‚Äôs vocals on here work like a nation of chalkboards fucking a nation of chalk, and there‚Äôs little moments that are so ‚Äúclever,‚Äù like the video game sound effect when she says ‚Äúcomputer games.‚Äù The chorus is just the icing on the shit cake, with Jesse and Kesha not working together at all, followed by a crash of drums and guitar that is just not at all what Kesha should sing over. Every semblance of delivery by Kesha here is just fanatically awful, and I actively hate this song.
