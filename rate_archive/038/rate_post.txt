Rainbow – Kesha

Release Date: August 11, 2017

Kesha returns to the music industry with her 3rd studio album Rainbow, her first full album in nearly 5 years. It follows prior efforts Animal and Warrior, released in 2010 and 2012 respectively, as well as the EPs Cannibal in 2010 and Deconstructed in 2013. She was first launched into the pop music scene in her feature on the Flo Rida hit “Right Round”, where she performed the chorus. Soon afterwards, she released her debut single “Tik Tok”, which topped charts worldwide. Animal also spawned the hit singles “Blah Blah Blah” featuring 3OH!3, “Your Love is My Drug”, and “Take It Off”. The spin-off EP Cannibal had similar amounts of success with it’s singles, with “We R Who We R” and “Blow” both reaching the top 10. While her Warrior era never quite managed to reach the commercial heights of the prior one, “Die Young” was a smash hit, and both “C’Mon” and “Crazy Kids” perform respectfully. Soon after Warrior died down, she released a chart-topping collaboration with Pitbull, “Timber”. Rainbow is headlined by the hit single Praying, which also contains promotional singles “Woman”, “Learn to Let Go”, and “Hymn”. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with 117k album equivalent units and 90k pure album sales, and has sold 470k copies worldwide as of December of 2017. Upon its release, Rainbow achieved high acclaim from music critics, with a score of an 81 on Metacritic and scoring her 2 Grammy nominations, for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance for “Praying”.

The road to Rainbow has been a long and tumultuous one for Kesha. Her struggles between Warrior and Rainbow date back to 2014, where she was checked into rehab for an eating disorder. Soon after leaving rehab and a short stint on the poorly performing singing competition “Rising Star” on ABC, she sued her long-time collaborator and producer, Dr. Luke, for sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, emotional abuse, and gender violence, all of which occurred over the years they had spent working together. Through her lawsuit, she attempted to be released from Kemosabe Records and, ultimately, Dr. Luke’s influence. In a heart-breaking verdict, she lost her case, as the statute of limitations had run out on the most specific allegations, and an overall lack of concrete evidence to support her claims. After the resolution, she released an updated version of Zedd’s song “True Colors”, her first song in almost 3 years. She then embarked on her third world tour, the Kesha and the Creepies: Fuck the World Tour, which featured rock and country versions of her hits. After the tour ended, she completed work on her third studio album, which, despite having to work for the same label, was done without her working with Dr. Luke.

Katy Perry – Witness

Release date: June 9th, 2017

To the surprise of many, Katy Perry was not always Katy Perry. Back in 2001, she was known as Katy Hudson (real name: Katheryn Hudson), a Christian rock artist. Her self-titled debut album was released under Red Hill Records, which went bankrupt before any marketing was done. The album ended up selling under 200 copies (--think about that the next time you call Witness a flop--). After years of work and rebranding, she ended up on Capitol Records, where she released what is now considered her debut album, One of the Boys, which painted her as an up-and-coming pop-rock artist. Its break-out success, thanks to the controversy of Your So Gay, as well as the break-out hits I Kissed a Girl and Hot N Cold, put Katy Perry on the map, leading to what is essentially one of the most successful eras of all time, Teenage Dream. She delivered one gargantuan hit after another, with California Gurls, then Teenage Dream, then Firework, then ET, then Last Friday Night, then The One That Got Away, then Part of Me, then Wide Awake. This success continued into the Prism era, which was her largest opening week sales to date, and scored another 2 number 1 singles, Roar and Dark Horse. This massive streak of success eventually led her to headlining the Super Bowl, with an unforgettable accompanying performance by Left Shark.

After the Prism era though, something changed in the stars for Katy Perry. After taking off two years, she released Rise, a buzz single for the 2016 Summer Olympics, as well as for the Democratic National Convention. However, despite this presence, it debuted at number 11, and fell off quickly. She also showed heavy support for United States presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during this time. After the crushing defeat in the election to --Voldemort-- he-who-must-not-be-named, she wanted to strive to make music that was purposeful (re: “woke”). The lead single Chained to the Rhythm was definitely purposeful in the way she had seemed to promise, but did not catch on, debuting at 4 due to Katy Perry name-brand, but falling off quickly after that.

This marked the beginning of what was ultimately messy roll-out. Chained to the Rhythm was released in February, had a few weeks of heavy promo, and then fall off quickly, and was pretty much gone by mid-late March. A month went by without anything, until Bon Appetit was dropped, to the confusion of many due to its lack of wokeness as she suggested the album would contain. This flopped entirely, despite a controversial, successful, and attention-grabbing music video. The album name, as well as its release date, wasn’t announced until May, with Swish Swish coming out a few days after this announcement. Swish Swish was received a bit better than Bon Appetit was initially, largely thanks to a strong verse from Nicki Minaj, but relying on a tired Taylor Swift feud, as well as an overall lack of hype, prevented a break-out. The rushed nature of this Swish Swish release also resulted in a long-delayed music video, which didn’t come out for nearly 3 months, when the ship had arguably sailed.

Witness was a bit of a commercial disappointment upon release. It debuted to a solid 180k equivalent units, but dropped to number 13 in the second week, and ended up at a mere 431k album equivalent units as of September. These sales were largely on the backs of a successful Witness: The Tour, where ticket sales came bundled with a copy of the album. It also disappointed a bit to both critics and many fans, scoring a mere 52 on Metacritic and becoming a bit of an online meme. Despite this, it still is an album that many would consider worth listening to.

##Rules! (Mostly copy and pasted from the All Stars Rate). PLEASE READ THESE EVEN IF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN A RATE HERE BEFORE, THERE MAY BE SOME NEW INFORMATION.

- **Listen to and rate every song.** The program I’m using will crash if any song is not rated. Any incomplete ballots will not be accepted. Any ballots where you clearly haven’t listened to all the songs will be rejected until modified.

- **Score each song from 1 to 10**. You are allowed **ONLY ONE 11** and **ONLY ONE 0.** Decimal places are allowed but only to the first digit: scores like 6.4 and 9.8 are allowed, but not 6.48 or 9.87. It makes the program very wonky. **You can change your scores at any time, just PM me.**

- THE BONUS RATE IS SEPARATE FROM THE MAIN RATE: A BONUS SONG CANNOT GET YOUR 11 OR 0

- Remember, **you don't have to use your 11 or 0!**

- This one is important, so listen up. DO NOT SABOTAGE. DO NOT SABOTAGE. DO NOT SABOTAGE. Sabotaging will be defined as giving a song a lower score than you actually feel it deserves because you want another song to win/you want your fave to win. I will be reading through all of these scores, and any clearly sabotaged ballots, I will ask that you change the scores. Failure to comply will result in --permadeath-- your scores not being counted.

- Following the idea of the last one, please refrain from hate comments in your comments. A little messiness is always fine, but please try not to go over the top. I will be reading through comments, any questionable ones I may request that you change. Refusal to do so will result in your comments for that song being removed.

- Additionally, please rate all albums fairly. I will be enforcing a mandatory minimum. Try not to have all 10s or all 1s, and if you do, please include justification for each of these so it at least doesn't look like you're blindly stanning.

- **Comments are allowed and encouraged!** To leave a comment, just put a space after your score and write away.

HERE is an example of a properly done comment:

> Praying: 10 A vocal legend, we stan!

HERE are examples of improperly done comments:

> Gorgeous: 10: Best songwriting I’ve ever seen!

> Gorgeous: 10 - Best songwriting I’ve ever seen!

> Gorgeous: Best songwriting I’ve ever seen! (10)

> Gorgeous: I'm giving this a 10 because it is the best songwriting I’ve ever seen!

Or anything else that isn’t the exact format of the first example.

Any questions or concerns, leave a comment or PM me!

Please try to have your scores in by March 1st, although I'll likely situationally allow extensions so long as you let me know.

I hope everyone has a great time doing this! Please remember that it’s just a rate and the results have no bearing on reality.

~~And don’t forget to give Praying or Rainbow your 11~~
