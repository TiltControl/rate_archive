The 2017 Ultimate Album Rate, Day 3: I Think We are ALL Motherfucking Women...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/872jg2/the_2017_ultimate_album_rate_day_3_i_think_we_are/

Welcome to day 3 of the messy, record breaking, always leaking, 2017 Ultimate Album Rate!

To begin, I want to introduce everyone to the Miss Songeniality vote! Please vote **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0GJQzKHeJzwvdQWbO4zYnQpEzZfWgNkVP4PbR_dBmuIwGtQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

The voting will close before the top 5, maybe a bit earlier if there is a clear winner. 

We will be starting at

##3:30 pm EST!!

Oh, there'll be poorly-coordinated shitposts in the plug.dj too! [Here's a link to the plug](https://plug.dj/popheads/) I'd love it if you could stop around, there aren't any fancy homemade shit posts, simply because I'm not talented enough for that shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯



**NOW**

Here are some fun facts:

-	/u/infernalsolstice has taken the crown for the most participated in rate, with a staggering **154** participants. 
-	The average score is **7.1231**
-	The average controversy score is **2.2056**. This means that anything above this score is considered 'controversial'
-       We will be revealing numbers **16-1** today, with the next two bonus rate songs going out as well!

Here is a recap of the songs that have gone out so far, and what is left!

Like most of the other Katy songs on Witness, I don't really remember this song much. 

Luckily for her, her last 3 songs in all SLAP, and I'm excited for all of them. 

This is also the last song in the rate that didn't receive an 11, so expect mess the whole rest of the ride folks.

--- 

**If I remembered how it went, I'd understand these comments**
---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): ok now THIS ONE really really does slap

**izeasklapaucius** (10): The basslines and synths eerily reminds me of the score from Theme Hospital.

**jimmy345960** (10): Top 5 Katy songs, good thing its a single right? haha katy why.

**m4ttycool** (10): bop

**melodyllic\_** (10): closing out the trio of potential hit singles (witness, roulette) is this gospel-influenced banger. the perfect throwback to katy's midas touch when it comes to choruses


**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): mom pop radio will love this

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): FINALLY AN UPBEAT SONG, and a fantastic one at that

**VeganSquash** (10): this is a total bop and it has a great message. The second verse is really great with the choir.


**stardustanddinos** (9.5): The message here is really beautiful. It's about staying humble and true to yourself however big you grow, something people forget all too easily. The choir elevates the song into a soaring anthem, and this is one of Katy's best deep cuts.

**zamomattel** (9.5): this song can marry me

**twat\_brained** (9.3): I don't have lots to say on this one, but for the fact that it reminds me of the Katy of old, and is one I can see replay value in.

**jhxcb** (9.2): Not your typical Katy, but I'd venture to say this is one of the best songs on the album. I'd love to see her go more in this direction. I think it suits her well.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.1): How meta - a song written by 2016 Katy, which sounds like it's addressed to 2017 Katy

**banananaise** (9): "you've got patina einzo greener, you burn the spark of your reciepts, yeah" i have no idea what she's singing

**dwarfgourami** (9): the only song from Witness that I regularly listen to tbh


**MissyBee37** (9): Reminds me of an earlier Katy, like One of the Boys. Vocally & lyrically, it just takes me back, which I love. The choir adds so much style & spirit.

**Mudkip1** (9): catchy and fun!1! x3 owo

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This makes me happy.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Very sweet track, the pre-chorus reminds me of a kids's song I've heard somewhere before. This would make a good single if the era wasn't flopping so badly.

**robbiec\_** (9): SLAPS and the best choir on these albums

**tevinterimperium** (9): I love a pop song with a choir.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I actually like this a lot more on a third-fourth listen, there's a ton of energy here and it's a daring and energetic direction for Katy.

**specfagular** (8.5): Didn't like this song at first but it grew on me

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I love the pounding instrumental on this song, it reminds me alot of Some Nights by fun. (which makes sense considering its the same producer). The hook is one of my favorites on the album.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): This is one of the few songs on Witness that I actually feel was held back by the production? IDK if the muddiness is a result of the clashing styles of Jeff Bhasker and Illangelo but it slightly harms what is otherwise a bop.

**leviswift13** (8.4): I love the production here.

**1313Harbor** (8): I like that Katy's vocals carry this song more than the beat, bass line, and backing vocals do.

**camerinian** (8): wtf an actual fun sounding song with interesting elements like the choral backing what's this doing here didn't they hear this album's meant to be boring as sin not actually interesting

**CarlieScion** (8): This is synth-pop done right

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (8): Who the fuck is writing these choruses? Can we ask them to stop??? In a song that's as strong as this one the weak lyrics stand out even more.


**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Should've been the fourth and last single in the era

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): A optimistic karma bop that I approve of.

**crowlily** (7.4): I like the sound, don't really like the pre-chorus or the chorus a lot though... the idea is kinda tacky

**agentofscranton** (7): this would be higher but i legit hate the way she says pendulum

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): another decent song. I really hope this is a foreshadowing of her career and she comes back swinging with her best album so far.

**jonnl2806** (7): Queen of extending a metaphor into a 4 minute song

**Elitefourbrad** (10): HALLELUJAH KATY GIVE ME THE CHOIR

**milkywayinradius** (10): I'm a sucker for piano chords and gospel choir clapping

**angusaditus** (9.5): i love when mom takes me to church http://i.imgur.com/PVCPkmm.gif

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Three words: MOTHERFUCKING GOSPEL CHOIR. How can anyone not love a song with a gospel choir

**skargardin** (8): Gospel isn't really my thing but it's still pretty solid.

**bwc222** (7.5): my local church is gonna put on a concert... this is their opener /s

**kappyko** (10): Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance cause I wanna praise ya


**I [Insert Descriptive] the song, BUT…**


**MashLuke** (7): mediocre but still bearable


**sletrab07** (6.5): I haven't warmed up to this one yet, but everybody seems to love it. I think I'm getting there, though.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): This song is good but I think this is easily the most overrated song on the album. The song feels kinda uninspiring that it's quite forgettable and I feel like this is a bit too pandering to the GP. Thankfully, it has a catchy chorus and hook but still.

**whatareblackhole** (7): This song is fine, but I don't think it accomplishes totally what it wants to accomplish.

**Glennishill** (6.5): This song is fine but unambitious. The beat is kind of samey but the choir does break it up later. Katy's vocals are fine but I just don't really like the rhythm.

**An Uninspired Inspirational Anthem**
---

**vayyiqra** (7): uninspired lyrics

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I heard so many good things about this song, and to be honest I don't get all the love. I do adore the instrumental and production and from the bridge to the end of the song is fantastic.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): outskinnied on her own track

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (6): Once again, Katy's vocals and lyrics (Dont reinvent your wheel???) don't live up to the stellar production.

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): actually not terrible


**nooodisaster** (6): tries to be an anthem but I'm Fallon asleep

**quaerex** (6): It sounds like a bop from the opening chords. Sure, it's a lamer "Firework" but at least it's more like old Katy. I could imagine this on the radio.

**vhqv1997** (6): I get what she was going for but tbh personally, this song just came off as obnoxious and stubborn

**dirdbub** (5.5): the production is at least interesting

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.5): this has some personality?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): average

**enecks** (5): This sounds like a jeep commercial smells. Nothing, because a jeep commercial is on a tv with no smell functions.

**MrSwearword** (5): at least it's upbeat

**natsby** (5): it sort of just sounds like CTTR pt. 2

**theNealCutter** (5): ergh. It's boring. srsly. it doesn't evoke anything from me. it doesn't even spark rage for me to comment. damn the bridge made it lamer.

**deadspiderwall** (4.7): is it over yet?!

**camirose** (4): It's something different but I can never decide if that's a good thing.

**strawberryswing1** (3): no

**joshually** (2): That choir is me… just kind of "Ohhh"ing in the background not really sure what's happening and hoping the smile will deflect from the confusion

**thetimidmartian** (1): probably the album's biggest failure, nothing here works out too well. that production wasnt thought through

The is one of the Rainbow songs I return to the most. It bops, it's naught, and the production is top notch.

It also takes one of the most *country* ideas and turns it into one of the poppiest songs on the album. A true diverse queen.

**Slutty Kesha Can Ride Me Like a Horse**
--- 

**kromosol** (11): Best song on the entire album !

**melodyllic\_** (11): everything about this song is perfect and no one can convince me otherwise. the kitty line is an instant classic

**zamomattel** (11): the word yaaasss was literally devised to talk about boots by kesha lets be honest

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): queen of having boys in every country code wow

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): the song I'm still listening to. enough said.

**cyborglilith** (10): this sick beat

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is a combination of Old and New Kesha. I love this. <3

**DraculaWeekend** (10): One of my favorites on the album

**dropthehammer11** (10): THIS SHIT IS SO LIT I'M FUCKING THROBBING

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): This ended up on my year-end Spotify list for a reason! It has a western flair but is still super fun and catchy.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Love the dark and sexy vibe!

**jhxcb** (10): What a bop. Kesha? More like Ke-slay-a? I don't know. I'm not good at this. But, really, more perfection. Perfect dance pop. This is my "slut-drop" anthem, kind of. It honestly makes me want to strip. Somebody save me.

**milkywayinradius** (10): that whip sound activating my inner dom like I'm a sleeper agent

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the gays love this! why isn't this a single yet? Justin Tranter co-wrote this!!

**SpanKKy1** (10): a thot anthem

**tevinterimperium** (10): This is the only song that she didn't perform at her concert and I'm pissed because it's such a bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): megabop

**theNealCutter** (10): this is how you make a fun sex song. This is Lady Gaga's John Wayne but actually sexy.

**topesmachine** (10): god everything about this song is perfect

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): A BOP THAT DESERVED TO BE A SINGLE.

**kappyko** (9.5): /u/PuggleMaster why do you hate this

**twat\_brained** (9.2): This one I can see myself coming back to every now and again.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): One of only a few songs where neither Sebert is the lead writer - I honestly couldn't tell. tbh it's even more hot knowing the lead writer is a guy

**camerinian** (9): Queen of millennial whoops that don't sound totally lazy

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (9): This is weird one. Is it sexy? Somehwat creepy? either way, the woahs after the chrous are catchy af

**dwarfgourami** (9): The only song that's ever made me want to sleep with a woman

**enecks** (9): Notice that going country means you can still have good hooks @Miley @Gaga

**MissyBee37** (9): Modern yet timeless. Love the western influences. I love the "oh"s, the instruments, that last line of the chorus,the bridge!

**natsby** (9): this feels closest to ~old Kesha but more mature and interesting

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Yee-haw. Where is her country album?

**nooodisaster** (9): This song is so filthy and sensual. Queen of monogamous sex lives.

**skargardin** (9): It's a fun romp. I love her delivery on the line "If you can't handle these claws, you don't get this kitty" and the added whips gives it a very tongue-in-cheek western feel.

**specfagular** (9): ok as much as i love this song i think seeing anyone wearing nothing but a pair of boots would make me start laughing

**vayyiqra** (9): okay this slaps

**whatareblackhole** (9): Honestly, Hunt You Down into Boogie Feet into Boots is such a fun consecutive moment.

**SkyBlade79** (8.5): best production on the album, best pre-chorus on the album, but the bridge is super cringy and it's missing something.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): If I am being honest I am living for this wild west sex fantasy.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): The smacking noises raise this score a full point. Otherwise it's just all-around solid.

**leviswift13** (8.3): This makes me want to work in a saloon and seduce the hot daddy cowboys that come in, which is always a good feeling.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): okay that claw/kitty part is doodoo but this is fun anyway

**ImADudeDuh** (8): It's a fun song, but I don't get the MASSIVE praise it gets from popheads.

**MashLuke** (8): if you'll ever want to have sex on mud, you should play this song

**therokinrolla** (8): slightly disappointing hook aside, this is very "Ke$ha with a dollar sign." I wouldn't go so far as to say it would fit on one of her first 3 projects, but it definitely wouldn't be an outcast.

**VeganSquash** (8): my slut anthem

**vhqv1997** (8): I get what Kesha was going for but I'm just not that into cowboy aesthetics

**awryj** (7.8): this is a bop but I don't understand why it sounds so somber

**robbiec\_** (7.6): this could have been on Animal but the fact that it's on Rainbow after everything makes it better

**crowlily** (7.3): Not my favorite but it's great too! The meow! I like her voice so much! Not a standout but a bop. UPDATE: IT GROWS ON YOU

**fourchip** (7): there seem to be a lot of boots stans on this sub… i ain't one of them

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I actually have nothing to say about this, so does anybody remember the episode of Dora the Explorer where Boots almost went into an eternal slumber? It was highkey scary.

**stardustanddinos** (7): This sounds like it's straight out of her older albums, and in a good way.

**sletrab07** (6.5): A guilty pleasure bop.

**CarlieScion** (6): I now can't get the mental image of a guy fcking someone wearing only boots. Thanks, I hate it.

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): Probably my least favorite on the record overall

**Elitefourbrad** (6): The "sexy" song on the album isn't hot enough to toast my bread.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Honestly the only song on Rainbow I don;t really like. Feels very generic compared to the rest opf the album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I think this is another track that everyone loves, but I'm really just not down with it. It's got a chorus that works, but nothing about it really makes it the least bit memorable. Also, Kesha's spoken sections here are just :suffer:

**TheLastAxolotl** (6): Another low point but not as bad Hymn

**Mudkip1** (5): a little too honky tonk badonka donk for me

**Glennishill** (4): They lyrics aren't as clever as Kesha thinks they are but it's more or less fine.

**itsboogiepanda** (4): Dull

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Ended Demi Lovato

**specfagular** (10): KWEEN OF MUSICALS

**jhxcb** (9.7): Kesha slays it. Better than the original. I could do with a whole album of this.

**1313Harbor** (9): This movie had a lot of problems for me, but Kesha's version of this song is not one of them.

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Could've been in Rainbow tbh

**vayyiqra** (9): great performance

**vhqv1997** (9): Kesha's vocals were perfect but when I first saw the title I thought she was doing a cover of Demi

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Love it but it's a bit too generic - Kesha has written songs that are similar but better. Also the best song on the soundtrack is The Other Side

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): cute

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This song just feels pretty epic. And even though it's not the most perfect technically speaking, I fucking am in love with Kesha's style of singing

**natsby** (8): I really like this but it still reminds me of the Camp Rock song so much

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I have absolutely no interest in this movie but you go sis

**quaerex** (8): Kesha killed this year and this song isn't an exception.

**SupremeShani** (8): These are some of the best vocals I've heard from Kesha.

**tevinterimperium** (8): Balladesha is the best Kesha

**crowlily** (7.8): it's not as polished as Keala Settle's version but it's emotional and great! and the final THIS IS ME is hella powerful oh my

**leviswift13** (7.3): I strongly dislike this musical, but I'm giving it such a positive score because of Kesha's connection and embodiment of the themes.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): God I love Keshas voice

**hikkaru** (7): it is very generic, but the queen serves vocals

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Her vocals are great and it's definitely a feel good songs, but it's so generic.

**jonnl2806** (7): Pretty decent for a soundtrack

**OriginalKappa** (7): why is this so much better than the actual song

**skargardin** (7): We've heard self-empowerment anthems like this one a thousand times over.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): Kesha is a strong vocalist and pulls this song off, and mostly is able to make me forget how phony the movie this is from is.

**whatareblackhole** (7): I don't know anything about The Greatest Showman, but I can already tell that this is, like, the final song. It's a nice, uplifting track.

**_____ Did It Better**

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Keala Settle did it better.

**agentofscranton** (3): keala settle did it better

**Piccprincess** (5): this isnt camp rock THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 4 DONT @ ME

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): camprock did it better

**dwarfgourami** (5): Demi did it better (but for real this is boring and generic)

**Inspo-Musical Bait**
---

**cyborglilith** (6.5): wow dramatic

**thetimidmartian** (6.5): thematically kesha is the obvious choice, and i suppose vocally too; her voice sounds damaged and displeasing, and her belting is painful. she really cant handle the song's large climactic passages

**banananaise** (6): this song plays on the radio so much in australia, which makes its genericness even more grating

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Pretty generic empowerment pop, but the last chorus is amazing.

**camerinian** (6): I mean of course Kesha sounds great on this, but this wasn't even in the top 5 songs from The Greatest Showman. Give me The Other Side or From Now On any day fam

**DraculaWeekend** (6): This is real, this is me…

**ImADudeDuh** (6): eh

**letsallpoo** (6): camila WON

**deadspiderwall** (5.9): eh

**enecks** (5): Oh Kesha you were in the wrong oscar bait musical


**awryj** (4): inspirationalsong_5.mp3

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): If Sufjan Stevens loses I'm going to boycott my ears

**TragicKingdom1** (4): The Greatest Showman soundtrack sucked but this was one of the better songs. Unfortunately Kesha does not have the power to handle this, although some of the production problems were alleviated in this version.

**izeasklapaucius** (3): Why is Kesha so bland in this shit?

I am genuinely surprised with how high this song got. It stayed just on the brink of the top 20 the entire rate, and ended up slowly rising, and is one of the least controversial Taylor songs, ever. 

Going out at 13, somewhat fitting, DWOHT was the little engine that could. 

--- 

**YEAH WE WERE DANCIN**
--- 

**awryj** (11): My fav track on Reputation by far. This is what it should've been - an actual EDM album, with heavy d&b and house influences... and what we got was Max Martin's "rejectedtrap (2)" folder.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): not much to say, its a perfect pop song too. I Know Places reputation edition.

**bwc222** (10): the biggest grower on the album for me. originally my 6th favorite on the album, it's now my 2nd favorite behind "i did something bad"

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): drama! urgency! lyricism in the verses! she absolutely SNAPPED!

**cyborglilith** (10): The nuttiest, naughtiest, nightyest song on the album. The song gets more vibrant as it goes on: those ascending notes in the second verse, then the bridge, then the signature explosive last chorus of many pop songs.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The theme and the production of this song is fucking stellar. Taylor better deliever an amazing performance of this song on tour.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): BDSM queen.

**enecks** (10): Why the actual fuck hasn't this song broken off as a big hit? It's got a drive, it's got momentum. It has a chorus that lets the synths do the talking of the production, not hi hats or thudding electroclash. Hell, this song actually justifies its overlong title unlike a lot of this album. It's a sensual bit of synthpop gold that reminds me that Jack Antonoff produced this album - the same jack Antonoff who gives Lorde and the Bleachers retro classic jams on the regular.

**fifthchevron** (10): "My love had been frozen deep blue, but you painted me golden" still has me shook. So much emotion and paranoia all playing off each other. It should be noted she's had some sort of sexual awakening with Joe. Not an awakening...lol a sexual…healing maybe? King, Dancing and Dress all address how sex has become new, happy, passionate and meaningful to her, and I think it's simultaneously sweet and really sad to consider how broken she might've felt for a long time. This song highlights the peculiar bravery it takes to live a public life.

**itsboogiepanda** (10): Forget r/popheads' holy trinity of Lorde, Charli XCX and Carly. This, KoMH and Getaway is the real holy trinity. This is 'I Knew You Were Trouble' perfected and on steroids.

**MashLuke** (10): this makes me want to go on a night car drive and make out in front of a starry sky. Beautiful song and production.

**Piccprincess** (10): an instant like for me tbh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): bop

**vayyiqra** (10): perfect 80s ballad

**whatareblackhole** (10): This was the sound we should have gotten on this whole album! This song is fucking COOL. Carly's impact.

**leviswift13** (9.8): A song that took a while to grow on me but ended up as one of my favorites from the records. I dare you to find a better final chorus.

**jimmy345960** (9.6): Kinda generic but in the best way? Like How? Taylor explain?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9.5): a BDSM anthem, fetlife is shook, 50 shades of rey found dead on a ditch

**Itsafudgingstick** (9.5): Taylor fucking snapped @the last chorus. Like this could legit be a banging lipsync on RPDR had Taylor picked this out as a single.

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Noice beats.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (9): Feels more experimental than anything else on the album, in a good way.

**melodyllic\_** (9): moody murky and muddy made danceable and much better in the process. so it goes.. is bowing its head in shame

**quaerex** (9): Again, I really like this. Taylor is best at breakup songs. And this is finally a good metaphor for being in a relationship that you know is doomed.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): I love this song lyrically. The verses are great, but the bridge is my absolute favorite. "I'd kiss you as the lights went out / Swaying as the room burned down / I'd hold you as the water rushes in / If I could dance with you again" gets me every time... it builds up and releases a strong sense of tension. However, the song is melodically somewhat bland, especially in the chorus.

**zamomattel** (9): i love the production on this so much

**kromosol** (8.7): ~But we were dancing, dancing with our hands tied, hands tied~

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): disappointing chorus, verses are amazing

**topesmachine** (8.5): not the biggest fan of the beat tbh but it's a good song

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): I like it, but just because I liked Never Be Like You, which this song poorly rips off

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Drums are great here too sounds almost 80's inspired with the tempo and drum style

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The chorus is so generic with the EDM drop, but the verses and pre chorus are really good.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I feel like this song has great potential and it kinda ruins it for the chorus, still awesome though!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Basic, but does basic always have to mean bad? This is generic, but not enough to sound cheap-Taylor's sense of cautiousness and anxiety is legitimately evident in the pre-chorus, and the chorus grew on me a lot after I got over the simplicity. It would make a good mid-cycle single, in my opinion.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I appreciate the drum and bass here, and the verses are magical, but I'm not a fan of the drop. It's a bit too slow and expected, and I really just want the song to explode, but it never does? Maybe that's the point, about restriction? I don't think so, but I still want an explosion. The imagery here is really nice though.

**vhqv1997** (8): This song is gay

**Albert\_Cole** (7.6): Halsey is shook, "Deep blue but you painted me golden" is iconic chromatisation

**jhxcb** (7.6): I think this is a really well-written song, actually, but I really wish she had given it to someone else. I know it seems super personal, but I just think it would be better suited to another voice.

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (7.5): the verses and pre chorus are really nice but the chorus is disappointing

**crowlily** (7.5): the verses are a little too fast-paced for my liking

**fourchip** (7.5): pretty filler but still a bop

**Glennishill** (7.5): I want to hate this song but it's cute and the concept is neat and she sings in this song. It's fine but it's nowhere near her best.

**robbiec\_** (7.5): this song is several years too late but it's still good

**VeganSquash** (7.5): I don't understand what this song is about. Why are you dancing with your hands tied? What does that even mean?

**camerinian** (7): I've got a soft spot for drum and bass, so even though the chorus kinda kills the vibe, I'll give this one a pass

**CarlieScion** (7): Low-key a bop

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Not sure why I like this but it actually works. Almost sounds like dnb in the verses

**natsby** (7): solid but I don't understand why some people think this is the best t swizzle song ever???

**TheLastAxolotl** (7): I love how the verses were sung but the chorus/drop was a bit meh

**theNealCutter** (7): the beat is dope, but it's kinda forgettable. I dunno, maybe it's because of the production? like it doesn't sound new nor flatters taylor's voice.

**Yeah We Were Dancin, Dancin to an Overused Beat**
---

**dirdbub** (6.5): I like the lesbian undertones but my god is the DnB beat so basic and overused

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): i enjoyed this

**skargardin** (6.5): It's just okay. It honestly took me a few listens to even remember that it existed. Even after the fifth time playing the album I was always caught a bit off-guard whenever it started playing cause I just forgot about it.

**thetimidmartian** (6.5): the prechoruses are well written, but the production sounds too much like the other tracks of the album

**twat\_brained** (6.3): Anyone else thinks this sounds like if Rudimental and U/The_Chainsmokers collaborated on a track? Like, the verses remind me of the former and the chorus the latter. I'm not sure if this signifies the official sameness of Taylor's music compared to everything else or Max Martin's steepest musical decline yet. I've still got half of this album left AND all of Witness so I'll just wait and see.

**jonnl2806** (6): This could have been sung by anyone and that's what makes it disappointing.

**kappyko** (6): Much like its namesake, this sounds like good fun trying to struggle out of its own predicament; the predicament of this song being how unremarkable the chorus is.

**SkyBlade79** (6): kind of filler

**specfagular** (6): Its alright...

**stardustanddinos** (6): This song has that neat RnB production, it's kinda forgettable otherwise. The chorus is too loud for me tbh.

**nooodisaster** (5.5): adds to my "to do w kinky bf" list

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): I really wish the production stuck to the sound of the beginning of the song. I think this is probably my favorite on the album sonically, even if the hook is a huge step down from the rest.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): Wasted potential definitely. Needs way better production.



**If I Could Dance With You Again (I Wouldn't)**
--- 

**SupremeShani** (4.5): The lyric "Dancing with our hands tied," is an intriguing line that leaves plenty to work with, but the song doesn't do much with it besides repeat it over and over while a bland drop plays in the background.

**SpanKKy1** (4): the producer probably had their hands tied while making this

**TragicKingdom1** (4): Kind of annoying, don't like the choppiness.

**MrSwearword** (3): the production is boring but thumpy...I don't know...aggressively boring?

**theburningundead** (3): the instrumental feels dated already, I can't imagine this song is going to age well

**joshually** (1): another boring song

**PenOrAPencil** (11): KATY WHY WASN'T THIS THE LEAD SINGLE?

**angusaditus** (10): the good sis came for blood with this one!  https://i.imgur.com/NVObJ2h.gif

**bwc222** (10): MAKE THIS A SINGLE ALREADY GOD DAMMIT!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Ugh, why hasn't Katy release this song as a single yet? It would have been a huge hit.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The party anthem and my favorite from Witness by far. It's Katy at her pop best, what amazing production to aide this amazing track.

**enecks** (10): LOL THIS POP SONG USED 80'S STYLE SYNTHS THAT MUST MAKE IT GOOD? actually tbh yes I wanted to drag this but I listened to it again and it works

**fifthchevron** (10): So slick and polished, this is my getting ready to go out song. I relate to the themes of wanting to be reckless sometimes and not being very good at it.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): KATY WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE THIS A SINGLE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST RADIO FRIENDLY SONGS ON THE ALBUM.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Oh. WOW!!!!!!!!

**kappyko** (10): Do you guys remember Casino Park Zone from Sonic Heroes? This song sounds like it should play in that

**leviswift13** (10): WHY WAS THIS NOT THE LEAD! THIS COULD'VE SMASHED.

**melodyllic\_** (10): crash bang there goes potential 2nd hit single. katy why??? the synth riff is so iconic and i cry everytime the second 'just let go' comes on (second prechorus) just thinking about the possible choreo for it

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I still can't fathom how this isn't a single

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Ok Kathryn, you did that™

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I kept my word! Anyway, this an obvious standout on the album, and depending on your perspective it's a bright spot too. I think this is the most epic Katy song by a mile-Legendary Lovers who?

**skargardin** (10): The production reminds of "the Fame"-era Gaga, it's honestly super tight and it's by all account one of the best songs on Witness.

**specfagular** (10): Strongest song off Witness. Where's my MV Katie? :eyes:

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the best song on this album

**theburningundead** (10): easily the best song on the album

**twat\_brained** (10): Roulette is a gambling game, often played in casinos. You know what place is known worldwide for their casinos? Las Vegas. Vegas. Waking Up in Vegas. Not only is Katy incredibly woke, but she is also a self-referential queen! When will your fave?

**zamomattel** (10): probably my second place for the 11, favourite production of last year

**Albert\_Cole** (9.6): I love it, but somehow it lacks... something that the Teenage Dream era had. The chorus feels like it's gliding, not soaring.

**poppinmmolly** (9.5): best song on the album BY FAR

**rickikardashian** (9.5): inb4 "inb4 SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE!!"

**Glennishill** (9): This is a banger. I love the beat and the metaphors are a little cheesy but Katy sings them with such gusto that I can't help but love them.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): I fucking LIVE for the 80s vibes in this song. Unlike Swish Swish which did a house beat and made it super basic, this song's production was fucking top tier and I could see myself bopping to this any time, any place, no matter what (yes, even at a funeral).

**m4ttycool** (9): should be a single, hehe

**MyselfAndAlpha** (9): hated witness on the first listen, but this song is growing on me

**rotating3Dtext** (9): seeing this live made me appreciate the beat

**SkyBlade79** (9): a megabop kinda

**topesmachine** (9): this is p good!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Excellent synths and melody. I can really appreciate the smaller details like the subtle instrumental buildup on the "just. let. GO!"

**vhqv1997** (9): This should have been a single, the MV would have been amazing

**whatareblackhole** (9): WOW this song is fucking stunning. Such a strong (and well-placed) moment. I love the harmony on the chorus.

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): I like the glam vibe of the synth. Reminds me of 70s/80s action-scifi movies score.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): #JUSTICEFORROULETTE Yes it sounds a bit 2012 in production, but it's a DAMN GOOD 2012 song. One of the top in terms of listenability in the rate. Katy even acknowledges the dangers and high violence rates females face when hooking up... I might be stretching on that last point.

**thetimidmartian** (8.5): definitely single material, the lyrics lack her standard character but her vocals are excellent and her falsetto has a nice tone

**1313Harbor** (8): Normally I'm a sucker for a synth-y bop like this, but this feels uninspired. I just hear Take on Me.

**CarlieScion** (8): This is a bop. The song isn't trying to be too serious and the production is really good.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (8): DRUMS! I wish they went together a little more with the synth line but it's okay. Songwriting holds this back.

**followingfreeways** (8): this is actually kind of a bop nice!

**gannade** (8): Kinda a bop but its also kinda second rate The Fame era Gaga.

**itsboogiepanda** (8): Really catchy. Find myself silently bopping along to this every time

**quaerex** (8): Why she didn't release this as the lead or second single is beyond me. The production is incredible and the lyrics are actually pretty good, except for the "drop a pin to my location" thing but even that line can't detract from the overall strength of the song, that explosive chorus contrasting beautifully with those softer verses.

**Raykel** (8): I bet Gladiators killed each other to the electronic horns in this song back then.

**robbiec\_** (8): the horns(?) at the beginning take is good 80s. I didnt remember this from the first time around and didn't realise how prominent the house element was on this album

**SupremeShani** (8): Everyone loves a good, catchy eighties throwback, so I can see why this is a fan favorite. I think the song could benefit from a stronger chorus though.

**theNealCutter** (8): i like it. but there's not much I can say to it. i guess my biggest problem with the album is how vague all of its lyrics are.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): I live for the synths

**vayyiqra** (8): epic synth riff

**VodkaInsipido** (8): only thing I can ask for is the production not to sound so dated

**wanderingimpromptu3** (8): This song gets me so pumped.

**crowlily** (7.6): the chorus is wow!

**stardustanddinos** (7.5): Back to form again! The lyrics work this time, and the 2000s inspired production is really fun. Wasted potential for a single, yet again! (The drop at the chorus could use a little work, while we're at it).

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): this song is awful. like, the lyrics are so corny and mediocre. but goddamn that 80's synth style is snatching my wig left and right and i still listened a LOT to this song early on even though i heavily disliked it, so I can't give it less than a 5. also i need to do that minimum avg so that kesha stan wont ban my ass from this amazing rate

**fourchip** (7): And you can see my heart beating/No, You can see it through my chest/Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving/Know that I must pass this test/So, just pull the trigger

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): P R O D U C T I O N :snatched:, if it wasn't for the cringe lyrics this would be much higher...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song hovers around a 9 and a 5, just like roulette

**TheLastAxolotl** (7): I don't get the hype behind this song but it's decent

**MashLuke** (6.5): I'm not feeling this

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (6): Here lies the first of many Witness songs with weird, fart-y sounding synths. The live version she played at the concert has much better build up and drops

**deadspiderwall** (6): sounds like sweet dreams

**jhxcb** (5.3): This would be a decent song if it came out twenty years ago, but it sounds dated on arrival.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): yikes

**dirdbub** (5): why is the album's extremely solid production met with such meh lyrical work

**VeganSquash** (5): its...okay. I don't get the hype tbh, there are better songs. This sounds like a Lady Gaga Fame era reject to me.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): obviously this isn't horrible but one of the best parts about katy's music is that it grabs your attention right away and this song just doesn't stand out

**camerinian** (4): In my mind the chorus had a lot more multitracking on it that actually made it sound inspired, but clearly that was the ol' Mandela Effect playing tricks, because it's just Katy's shitty overproduced studio voice as per usual

**ClocktowerMaria** (4): Worse

**tevinterimperium** (1): So many people love this song, but it's grating to me.

**Where You At Tho**

**joshually** (3): "So, I drop a pin to my location" YYYY KATY

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): The "drop a pin to my location" lyric is not the only one this album that will sound dated in a few years.

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (8.6): The woke theme peels away for a bit to bring us a a in quotes “generic pop song and love/sex”. Not gonna lie, lyrically this song is kinda boring so I don't really have a lot to say about it. You could make some speculations that there's something to be said about how roulette, a game of chance/lucky, connects to the woke theme; additionally when you take in to account how the bridge mentions russian roulette, a “game” where the player makes a bold and brash decision that can result in dire consequences in the name of “entertainment”, but honestly I dont know enough about the games to make those connections myself. At least at this point I know I'm the one reading too into it, as a single this song could work and the GP wouldn't question it too much so I'd say lyrically it was more successful than the previous two songs. The production is pretty cool too, read someone else's comment for that explanation.

Wow, a country song in the top 3? The 2012 Billboard Rate is SHAKING.

--- 

**Elitefourbrad** (10): A GRAMMY WINNING SONG

**followingfreeways** (10): I love country music so when I first heard this on country radio I knew it was gonna be good. such a beautiful and heartbreaking song, and really nice to sing to at karaoke!

**jonnl2806** (10): Easily my favorite LBT song

**Piccprincess** (10): fuck Jake Gyllenhaal

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is the best song Taylor has ever written. I'm seeing LBT next month and I am so hype to hear this performed live I'm going to cry.

**rickikardashian** (10): bring back yeehaw taylor. howdy

**skargardin** (10): It's got Taylor's lyrical print all over it, I love it.

**camerinian** (9.5): Holy shit can you imagine if Reputation had melodies and instrumental interplay this sweet

**leviswift13** (9.3): SHOULD'VE WON TAYLOR A GRAMMY

**jhxcb** (9.2): This is such a wonderfully mature version of country era Taylor Swift. I'm glad she's moved on from country, as pop really is her jam, but I hope she continues to write for country artists. She really has a good ear for it.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): THIS IS THE TAYLOR I WANT TO HEAR. This is one of the most mature songs she wrote in her career. I hope TS7 is somehow like this in terms of songwriting.

**itsboogiepanda** (9): I can see the Fearless Taylor performing this song, in fact I wish she did perform this.

**natsby** (9): I miss country taylor. so many f e e l s

**vhqv1997** (9): True, classic country Taylor. I'm thankful she hasn't completely abandoned her roots

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): This is a somewhat unusual message for a breakup song. I recognize that the relationship was toxic and you weren't a good person, but I still miss you. The lyrics are amazing ("I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that"). The only thing I wish for is a catchier/less flat melody, but this seems like a pretty typical melody for country so I may just be unfairly wishing this was a pop song.

**dirdbub** (8.5): yeehaw 🤠

**quaerex** (8.5): Taylor go back to country. Alternatively start songwriting for other people

**crowlily** (8.4): This be hella relatable. Classic Taylor songwriting. The way Taylor sings it is even better. I'm still holding out for the hope that she might release it someday.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): country taylor was never my fave

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I like this one a little-vaguely sounds like something off Red. I wish Taylor actually sung this instead of just wrote it, though.

**specfagular** (8): We all deserve the "Better Man"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Men are cancelled

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): It's Dead Taylor's writing alright

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.8): imiss country taylor

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): A nice country ballad with a bit of power but also could be fleshed out a bit more.

**deadspiderwall** (7.4): written by Taylor Swift®

**Albert\_Cole** (7): Taylor's still got the knack for this kind of music. Shame I don't like this kind of music

**bbfan132** (7): meh.

**cyborglilith** (7): I always loved the South aesthetic. It feels so peaceful/bittersweet/nostalgic.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Taylor's best lyrics in this rate

**ImADudeDuh** (7): A song that everyone calls LBT's peak and ehh, its ok. If taylor didn't write this i highkey would not expect this to get that much buzz.

**MissyBee37** (7): I had a realization during the Grammy's that I would be a far happier Swiftie if Taylor had kept this song & returned to her country-ish days rather than "reputation." But I digress.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This is ok.

**SupremeShani** (7): Country is waiting for Taylor to come back.

**topesmachine** (7): better than i thought it would be oops

**vayyiqra** (7): meh

**whatareblackhole** (7): I'm honestly surprised this song isn't called "Better Man - Written by Taylor Swift" because that's how it is always talked about! It's an all right song. You can tell it's Taylor and potentially a Taylor reject.

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): overrated

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): SEE!! Taylor still writes country!!!

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): It's a decent track but I don't really think it's for me

**izeasklapaucius** (6): Robbie Williams did it better tbh.

**melodyllic\_** (6): this is definitely something my dad would listen to on the radio and complain to me about how music these days is a steaming pile of shit. and my dad's not white so that's saying a lot

**Glennishill** (5.5): I hate country music but can't deny that the lyrics are pretty good hear. Sad to see though because if Taylor had recorded this instead she really could have shown off her writing on Reputation, even if it didn't fit the album.

**awryj** (4): soooomeday iiiill be livin in a big ol ciiiiity (i love mean btw)

**camirose** (4): Personally could never get into this song, not because it's country, but because I don't feel a lot of emotion from it the way I do when Taylor sings songs like these.

**thetimidmartian** (4): the singing is uninteresting and the songwriting is repetitive

**amumumyspiritanimal** (2): no

**MrSwearword** (1): exactly; there's better, man

**dirdbub** (11): anyways guess who's ready to sob

**Mudkip1** (11): love it love it love it it's so cute and nice and sweet i miss this taylor. i think my only complaint is that the piano's a little too loud

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): im such a sucker for piano ballads :,)

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): same as CIWYW, these two are the perfect album closers. it feels like TIWWCHNT is the end of the movie where the bad guy gets what coming to him, after the protagonist and his best friend fall in love(yes its a gay movie) finally, and these two songs are just the epilogue where they get their happy ending and that Portland residence.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): if you don't give this your 10 you are a furry i'm sorry i don't make the rules

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): out of place on the album but so good that it doesn't matter. maybe the old taylor isn't quite dead yet

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Old Taylor isn't dead. She is just kidnapped by New Taylor in her basement and Old Taylor was able to escape for one last song in the album.

**enecks** (10): A beautifully constructed song with some great lyrics. I missed you old Taylor.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (10): I don't know if there's anything that could possibly be changed in this track. That piano theme is beyond beautiful.

**followingfreeways** (10): one of the best slow dance songs there is, one of her most beautiful songs she has ever made, and every time things are rough with my boyfriend, this song reminds me that it's gonna be okay.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We love acoustic pop that is marketed as country for no reason.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Sweet closing track.

**leviswift13** (10): This will be my future wedding song. Thank you queen for inventing the New Year's holiday.

**MashLuke** (10): the feels man

**melodyllic\_** (10): taylor and piano best duo performance grammy when

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): who wouldn't love this after she performed this on Jimmy Fallon?

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): A fantastic song that plays to her strengths for once in this album

**Piccprincess** (10): I literally cannot listen to this song without bawling it touches me so much

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love that there's a song like this on rep. Just really honest and lovely like we've come to expect from Tay. Idk why it was sent to country radio though, that still grinds me gears.

**robbiec\_** (10): little universe

**SupremeShani** (10): I was really hyped for this song as the "ballad" of the album where Taylor would show off her flawless storytelling skills, and was left feeling disappointed. I've changed my mind on it though, and appreciate that instead of telling a vivid story like on "All Too Well", she chooses to capture a sentimental and romantic mood though concise lyrics that are repeated throughout the song. Songs about New Years are often celebratory and larger than life, either speaking about starting over and building a new you or reminiscing of all the good times that year. The song subverts these themes and Taylor instead chooses to focus on the morning after the party, where you wake up without the festivities and only have the few concrete aspects of your life. The way she refers to the tradition of New Years instead of referring to a single occasion makes it an interesting way to tell someone you'll be with them year after year, even through all the plain and bad aspects of life. Combine this with a simple piano, it makes for a rather beautiful song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I would love to analyze this song and give a long writeup of this track, as I've done numerous times in the past but literally my keyboard broke because my streams of tears shorted out the circuitboard.

**TheStarSquad** (10): The secret sessioners were calling it the best on the album, wedding and tear-worthy apparently. I was disappointed at first listen because of all the hype, but after multiple listens it has grown on me a lot. It works very well as a closing-track, and while I was expecting a lot more from a piano ballad, it is very different thematically from what she's used to. Great song.

**twat\_brained** (10): I love seeing glimpses of the Taylor Swift I miss every now and then. This song is no exception. Beautifully composed, beautifully written, it's what a Taylor Swift song SHOULD sound like.

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (9.5): what a great way to end the album

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): I'm not a fan of soppy Taylor - Red and Speak Now are my least favourite albums of hers - but for some reason I love this.

**awryj** (9): this song is adorable ok

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Best song on the album without a doubt.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): This song is so sweet, yet super emotional and gives me warm feelings inside. If you genuinely dislike this, I question your ownership of a heart.

**joshually** (9): A pretty song, slightly boring, but great lyrics.... beautiful lyrics

**skargardin** (9): This song is so cute and a perfect way to close the album with.

**specfagular** (9): i wasn't the biggest believer in this song until I saw her perform it live on jimmy fallon and then it just clicked and I've loved it ever since

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): cute

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Great finisher with two beautiful metaphors

**theNealCutter** (9): when things are over, it's dumb ask to be remembered. maybe I'm getting it all wrong. maybe I'm just bitter, but to say things and give promises like these when nothing has gone wrong yet, it feels like you're setting your self to something that you'd wish you never said. I like the song, it reminds me that I made promises I can't keep.

**topesmachine** (8.7): a good, classic Taylor song. IDK why this is the album closer too. anyway the second half of the album is miles better than the first there i said it

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Better """Country""" song than most of modern country radio

**Elitefourbrad** (8): A great way to close out the album.

**Glennishill** (8): A good song on an otherwise sloppy album. Unsurprisingly, when Taylor scales it back to her voice and a piano, the results are a strong, heartfelt song. Nowhere near her best.

**MrSwearword** (8): under a better album, a cut that sounds like a saccharine movie soundtrack number would get way lower points but because this makes actual sense as a closer [and it doesn't suck at large], legit score of eight.

**natsby** (8): not her best ballad ever by any means, but a beautifully stripped-down and adult-feeling song. I sort of wish her next album heads in a stripped-down adult-alternative direction, springing off from this style. either that or it's just full of songs like lwymmd because I have shit taste. I love how the bridge is like Enchanted pt 2 without feeling forced or stale.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Pentatonix's version is better. But not bad.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Like Don't Blame Me, I don't strive to listen to this one, but when I do, it's sweet and it brings tears to my eyes. Her performance of it live was so lovely. The repetitive chords are a little too much but I think most of us are jealous about the relationship Taylor describes here. She may not always make music or do things to my liking, but I think she's just another person with her own problems and flaws, and i hope she treasures the sentiment of this song forever. Also, this has the best lyrics on this album. Keep up the beautiful closing songs, Taylor.

**vhqv1997** (8): This song is so weird. A few lyrics cut deep, but the rest is just not that memorable

**zamomattel** (8): what's this water rolling down my cheek

**It Just Isn't Like the Rest of the Album**
--- 

**crowlily** (7.8): it's slightly repetitive, quite simple, not her best ballad but has some good lyrics

**camerinian** (7.5): Look, after a genuine rollercoaster of an album, this little bit of comfort and reassurance is quite nice.

**stardustanddinos** (7): Why's the piano so muted? The lyrics are intimate, and it is a perfect closer to an album that is otherwise somewhat jarring and turbulent in tone.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): A minimal ballad that works because of what it doesn't do more than it does. It's almost a breath of fresh air.

**vayyiqra** (7): nice

**whatareblackhole** (7): I don't have a lot to say about this one, but it's a fine song. Classic Taylor ballad.

**MissyBee37** (6.7): This song is totally fine. But Taylor is a stellar songwriter - capable of significantly better than fine, so a blandly pretty ballad does not impress just because it follows a bunch of songs I don't like. It's repetitive and simple - honestly, like a rough draft. 15-year-old Taylor's ballads harness more emotion than I feel from this song.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): This was a pretty good closer.

**fourchip** (6.5): nice attempt but it feels too disjointed and minimalist in production for me to actively enjoy it

**TragicKingdom1** (5): I mean I give it credit for not having any awful decisions involved but it's not interesting at all.

**itsboogiepanda** (4): Lmao at secret sessioners saying this is better than All Too Well. This slower ballad is out of place on Reputation and sub-par for a slower Taylor Swift song.

**kappyko** (4): She really dropped the ball on this one. Get it because New Year

**SkyBlade79** (4): snooze

**dropthehammer11** (3.5): Very boring

**gannade** (3): A pretty song, but Taylor never had the voice to do justice to ballads like these.

**SpanKKy1** (3): this song is like a lyrical hangover which is fitting given the title

**thetimidmartian** (3): i feel like ciwyw would have been the more fitting ending, theres no reason for this ridiculous acoustic production to conclude this album. has all of taylor's hallmarks-- the nostalgic and reflective songwriting, the laidback production, the standard singer-songwriter talk-singing-- and none of her strengths.

**fifthchevron** (2): It's heartfelt sure, "you and me forevermore" has me shook every single time, but overall the song is trying way too hard to evoke emotion. Like she's shaking me, yelling "NOW CRY!!!"

**VeganSquash** (1.5): I don't like this song, its the worst from Reputation imo. The problem is that the verses are too damn short, and they don't tell enough of the story. I feel like it needed more lyrics.

**I'm Hurt, But TBH? Tea**
---

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): zzzz i guess she had to have one purposefully boring dramatic song or it wouldn't be a taylor swift album

**nooodisaster** (6): People really stan this song as the return of Old Taylor, but if this was on Speak Now, you wouldn't even remember it.


**DAE Witness?**
--- 

**quaerex** (5): The sound is great, the lyrics are terrible. Honestly, reputation was Taylor's Witness and you can't convince me otherwise.

This made me sad. A true bop, and it gets robbed of a higher spot on the top 10? 

It was a safe top 10 entry for sure, and was top 5 at some points, but eventually dropped low enough and just stuck it out in the 8/9/10 range. 

Sad.

**DAE this is witness' witness?**
--- 

**angusaditus** (11): One of my all time favorite songs. I listened to the demo on repeat and I'm SO happy that she included it on the album despite the leak. I'm still not over this song, it's still gets me. I wish Katy would have made it a single etc cause it really deserves to be the center piece of the era. One of the strongest album openers in pop music imo https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-06/12/23/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/anigif_sub-buzz-23492-1497325564-8.gif

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): not actually my favorite track on the record (a close second though), but quite possibly the most complete artistic statement Katy has ever made. it has depth without feeling pretentious, and her vocal performance is one of her best. production is IMMACULATE on this track, and it just feels like an event. in a perfect world, this would have been a 10-week chart topping lead single with an amazing galactic video. does it set a high bar that most of the album falls short of? of course, but it's also easily one of the best songs of her career (and her best title track, feel free to @ me about it)

**gannade** (11): An absolute masterpiece. A lowkey inspirational bop. More heartfelt, vulnerable, and authentic than pretty much every ballad in this rate. Idk why Katy didn't release this as a single. I will be your witness Katy if you release songs like these :)

**ignitethephoenix** (11): If only the rest of the album followed the quality of this song. Lyrically this is one of the strongest songs on the album, the production is great (but pretty much the entire album has great production) and the entire chorus is fantastic. Katy really made a mistake not pushing the song as a single at some point. Also I'm giving my 11 to Katy because she deserves not to be slaughtered in this rate for every song, and also we all know Praying is going to win (which was my other choice) and I think that song will be okay without my 11.

**PuggleMaster** (11): it was tough choosing between this CTTR, and Swish Swish, but i just love this song.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): aight, this song bumps. but the album goes down from here.

**Albert\_Cole** (10): Katy is trying really hard to write deep, relatable lyrics. Well *I relate*, fuck all the haters

**callmetidle** (10): This is a career highlight tbh and it never being a single and getting a video is a crime

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember hearing this song when it was leaked as a demo and I honestly thought this could potenitally be one of Katy's best songs to date and I am glad the final version confirms that. An excellent song to open the titular album.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): You know, if this was the lead single, or even the second single, I may have had hope for this era. Alas, Witness now has a place as perhaps Katy's best album cut.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Productions in here are top notch. Interesting and left-field lyrics yet still catchy. I love it!

**melodyllic\_** (10): 100% shouldve been the lead single. modern, unique and lyrically sound, unlike 'chained to the cliche'. that first verse with the pulsating bass is EVERYTHING and the lil whistle section is actually quite cute

**MissyBee37** (10): Solid opening & tone-setter. Longing, yet hopeful & unifying because we're all looking for someone, so even if we're alone, we're not alone in our aloneness. I love the piano & the production; love the punch & percussion on each word in the last line of the chorus; love the melody.

**strawberryswing1** (10): u/sletrab07

**TheLastAxolotl** (10): Should've been the lead single tbh

**therokinrolla** (10): god what an intro. one of katy's best written and best produced songs. wow.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): my wig can you find it

**whatareblackhole** (10): I really, really love this song. I think she sounds beautiful and this sound is really good for her.

**cyborglilith** (9.7): Witness should have just been this song ten times and then bon appétit at the end.

**Mudkip1** (9.5): i like the leaked version better but this one's still good and i'm glad it got released

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I haven't listened to Witness in a while and I forgot how absolutely gorgeous and surreal that opening is. If Katy absolutely had to do "purposeful pop", I hoped it would be more like this.

**1313Harbor** (9): I love the balance between her vocals, the synths, and the beats, and then the whistling coming in at the end.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Why wasn't this a single?

**dropthehammer11** (9): Great opener. Very punchy and catchy.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This is a very catchy song to open up the album. It should have been the lead single but nope!

**leviswift13** (9): This chorus is sooooooo good. The house vibes really fit Katy.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): CAN I GET A WITNESS

**skargardin** (9): bouncy bop, why in the world wasn't this single #2 or #3?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): can i get a shitness

**twat\_brained** (9): I don't see what's so wocc about this first song, or how the "Witness" theme will be upkept throughout the album. It's pretty good, though.

**vhqv1997** (9): If anybody wonders why Katy made this album, please listen to this song, it sounds so personal and purposeful and explains so much of Katy's state of mind and the entire point of the album

**Glennishill** (8.5): Great opening track for this album. It sets the tone really well and I think it's pretty groovy. It has a lot of phases and flows between them effortlessly, a credit to good writing and production.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The pre-chorus and bridge to this are DIVINE. There's great momentum and purpose to them. However, the actual chorus is just kind of there by comparison.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I love everything about the hook on this track, from the production to the vocals Katy serves.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): This is the song on the album that I feel the most believable emotion from. The lyrics are pretty basic but the production is surprisingly atmospheric.

**zamomattel** (8.5): love this but wasnt this supposed to be with chance? that would have been a tune

**jhxcb** (8.3): I think it's got kind of a nice, subdued flowed. It's not a slow song by any means, but it's nice and smooth.

**acedino** (8): Should've been the lead single

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): this is the song that tries to save the album and it's not even that good

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): Clean wonderful production, and some intersting ideas, brought down by a couple bad lines, and akty's bad voice on the pre chorus

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (8): The piano works SO WELL here & the vocals (esp. on the outro) are lovely. The songwriting is a little too straightforward, especially

**m4ttycool** (8): This is actually good???

**MashLuke** (8): this is really nice, it's a cute song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): A pretty good opener.

**Piccprincess** (8): can you :point_right: see :eye: :eyes: me? :woman: i mean i know :rolling_eyes: you can see :eye: me. :laughing: but can you really see me? :virgo: :aquarius: :taurus: my name is Katheryn Hudson. :nail_care: :haircut: I'm vulnerable :cry: , strong :muscle: , i'm a woman :ok_woman: , an artist :musical_note: :paintbrush: , i'm liberated :no_good: , goofy :rofl: and not always right :shrug: . i'm katy perry :dancer: and i'm not just one thing. :100:

**SkyBlade79** (8): great chorus tbh

**tevinterimperium** (8): This song would be my 11 if it was the demo version. There is something about the official version that just doesn't have the same emotion or depth as the demo. It's still a good song though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A great intro, one of her best imo, and it would be a 10, but then Katy had to fuck around and add the shittastic whistling that just brings the track down on a whole for me.

**topesmachine** (8): a low key bop but a bop nonetheless

**vayyiqra** (8): hey this is pretty good

**robbiec\_** (7.3): why isn't this a single

**bwc222** (7): a solid album opener imo

**followingfreeways** (7): it's my first time really fully listening to witness and trying to enjoy it. this isn't that bad of an opening track

**jonnl2806** (7): I liked this a lot more when I first listened to the album but after a while I started to enjoy it a lot less. It feels like there's something missing and I can't put my finger on it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I'm not sure I get the hype for this. It's a good opening track, and it's better than what I expect from Katy, but it's not such a big standout on Witness like some people claim it is.

**specfagular** (7): It's nothing special, but it's not bad.

**stardustanddinos** (7): It's a great opener, and should've been a single. The instrumental is phenomenal and Katy's voice sounds so good!

**theNealCutter** (7): i'm not sure how to take this. it seems very earnest, but it comes from a naive eye. l'm not saying that Katy's feelings are invalid, but this weird generalization of "We're all just looking for connection" makes it apparent that Katy haven't really experience much of the outside world.

**TheStarSquad** (7): By far the best song on the album

**thetimidmartian** (7): the chorus is strong, the falsetto vocal layering is an excellent choice, but ultimately there's nothing much else here

**VeganSquash** (7): when I first heard this, my wig was snatched. Now its still cool but that magic has worn off and I realize how silly the song is. A witness for what? We already witnessed your flop honey.

**Raykel** (6.5): Why are you guys obsessed with making this a single?

**camerinian** (6): The skitter of the beat is actually quite groovy, but holy shit what a mess of a pre-chorus to kill it. Hook is one of the better on the album though, so that's nice

**CarlieScion** (6): An okay opener, but this also opens the gate to this albums awful lyrics (if shit hit the fan??) and all-over-the-place production. But the chorus is a bop

**enecks** (6): This song wants to be a cult deep cut in the same way as Legendary Lovers or Walking on Air so badly - inextricably tying itself to the album. It's a cry for attention for an album with nothing to say, though it is not inherently bad in itself as a song.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): It's good but the prechorus seems like there's way too much stuff going on at the same time and it kinda ruins the song.

**MrSwearword** (6): largely boring but goes nowhere

**Was Outsold/Out Lyricized/Out Rated**

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): it's a mediocre song. pretty overrated, maybe because it's still an outstanding song on the album. thats kinda sad tbh

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): Boring

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): i don't see where anyone says this should've been a lead single it reminds me of rise

**camirose** (4): forgettable

**natsby** (4): this is just so boring

**quaerex** (4): Everything in this album is perfectly encapsulated by the first song. It has so, so much potential but it's completely wasted with inane lyrics. Like the production is incredible, but then Katy Perry's singing about mats and you forget what you're listening to. It destroys the integrity of the song. It's unfortunate that the chorus has become something of a meme, but honestly it deserves that.

**SpanKKy1** (4): I wish I didn't have to witness this

**dirdbub** (3.5): pretty production but it's just kinda.. there and drags on for a bit too long

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.3): Katy starts the album off appropriately with one of her actual “woke” songs. The lyrics are some of the better ones on the album, but there are points where some of them don't do super well together. At a point Katy asks if her witness “Will you be the one who speaks for me?”, which is weird since that's not what a witness is supposed to do. This is the opening track after all and it holds the message that's supposed to be most central to the album. The biggest mark she missed with the song (and with the album to an extent) was going into it not knowing exactly what she wanted to say. The meaning is still kinda of ambiguous which was one of the biggest criticisms of CTTR (we'll get to that). Nonetheless, the song sounds good and gives off a chill vibe.

Uncontroversial, yet somehow didn't seem to have enough power from 6 11s and 32 10s to push it higher than #9 in the rate. 

A lot of people thought the writing and rock write-ins didn't work, and made the song directionless, and a lot of people took it for the fun fuck off song it was. 

**BOPS ARE SHAKING** 
--- 

**camerinian** (11): It has been so long since a song gave me such an instant rush of overwhelming joy like this song did. I had the dumbest fucking smile on my face when I first heard this, and I almost didn't want to listen to the rest of the album because it set such a high water mark so early on. I'll be hella salty if she doesn't play it live when I see her

**enecks** (11): Mood established, the album jumps to its niche - pop rock shot of energy which isn't afraid to say fuck you to the haters. It's such a rush with so much charm - especially in the bridge where Kesha tells the haters to suck her dick (I'm not going to lie I love singing along to this song - I enjoy it as an unofficial trans anthem, hence my 11) and says UN DEUX TROIS FOUR! I love this song it makes me happy. Kesha's best song.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Everything on this song works, the delivery, the verses, the fun lyrics, the fucking HOOKS! I normally imediately despise any song that uses the word "haters" but I don't mind it here cause it's so catchy and works well for a fun song.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): imagine being able to resist dancing anytime this song comes on. It's pure fun and energy, and a perfect execution of its concept. Eagles Of Death Metal were a wise choice.

**1313Harbor** (10): My first true obsession with a band was My Chemical Romance, and I screamed my head off singing along with them in concert as a teenager. This song basically replicates that feeling for me and I love Kesha for making such a kickass song. "Don't let those losers take your magic, baby!"

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): holy shit fuck me up queen i never even knew i could like an Eagles feature and i never have ever dreamed that i would listen to this song more than 100 times in a month. what a true icon. this song literally forced me to listen to EoDM only to go back to disliking their music

**awryj** (10): When shall the dick sucking commence, Ms. Sebert?

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Kesha goes pure pop rock and it's so so good

**dropthehammer11** (10): Kesha sounds so damn good over guitars. She should lead a band lowkey

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is my favorite song on the album for sure! The catchiness works so well and Eagles Of Death Metal really enhance the song with background vocals and guitar. Just Let'Em Talk, be yourself.

**fourchip** (10): a big, loud, in your face bop

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Love EoDM contribution in this song. YES FOR HER TO GO FULL ROCK ANYTIME SOON.

**jhxcb** (10): This is how Kesha should've always sounded if she had a producer who gave a damn. I wouldn't change a goddamn thing.

**kappyko** (10): /u/therokinrolla wanna kill a guy to this song?

**leviswift13** (10): A BOP IF THERE EVER WAS A BOP THAT BOPPED

**MashLuke** (10): this is so carefree damn, I couldn't stay quiet on my chair

**melodyllic\_** (10): living for the grating vocals and high-pitched screaming!! sorry grimes but kesha did this 10x better

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I really want to see more songs from Kesha like this. Her sneering voice manages to shine through the aggressive guitars and this is exactly the music she's been born to make.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Kesha needs to put out a rock album immediately

**nooodisaster** (10): Pure joy in three minutes. It's defiant and fun and feels like bouncing in a dunebuggy across the desert. This is a self-help anthem that ACTUALLY helps. There's no pretension or faux-inspirational quotes, just crude and insane lyrics that somehow are infinitely more inspiring. Listening to this is like getting a shot of adrenaline to live life fully.

**skargardin** (10): I love how this song is just one giant middle-finger to all the haters out there, this is an absolute anthem and one hell of a weird collab. "Don't let those losers take you magic" is a line I really needed to hear.

**specfagular** (10): This is my second favorite song behind Praying. Such a fun bop about going wild.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): megabop

**theburningundead** (10): "un, deux, trois, four" was a choice

**therokinrolla** (10): god when this dropped my ass was shook as hell. How is such a EUPHORIC chorus possible? It goes awf better than that SpaceX rocket

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): YES KESHA. SHAKE THAT ASS. FORGET ABOUT YOUR HATERS. ICONIC.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): The hook for this song would be a 9 at least on its own, it's so fucking good and one of the best pop hooks of last year. The 'suckkk my dickkk' at the end of the bridge kills me.

**zamomattel** (9.5): as much as this is such an end credits song, it bops

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (9): Best guitar work of the rate, but something about the sing-songiness of the chorus sounds like a disney-empowering anthem with a couple curse words

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): When I listened to this last night, Kesha's shrill vocals were a little annoying, but now I'm listening to it wide awake and it's a huge pop. I don't think anybody was expecting an Eagles of Death Metal collaboration,  but it's awesome to see widely different artists make a song together after coping with trauma. I don't think I've ever heard a song express a 'fuck the haters' message as good as this one.

**poppinmmolly** (9): serving Avril!

**theNealCutter** (9): this is the Kesha I missed. Cocky, fun, and full of energy. I'm in love with the gritty pop-rock production. Honestly, this should be a hit single.

**topesmachine** (9): you can't NOT dance to this

**whatareblackhole** (9): I LOVE this song, it's so fun!

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I love how Kesha delivers a philosophy about going "balls-out", doing exactly that on this track.

**Mudkip1** (8.5): i like how energetic it is especially because it's not overbearing at all.

**Piccprincess** (8.5): is this lorde

**quaerex** (8.5): This makes me want to dance so I will.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): Only Kesha can sing lyrics like "haters everywhere can suck my dick".

**cyborglilith** (8): we're dancing in a world alone

**followingfreeways** (8): this song is sooo fun omg. her voice is made for this type of music. I dont listen to this song enough, thanks rate for making me realize this

**Glennishill** (8): This is a very Kesha song, which I appreciate as someone who prefers her earlier albums.

**itsboogiepanda** (8): First few seconds is reminiscent of a Grimes song

**jonnl2806** (8): A solid bop

**joshually** (8): This song PUMPS ME UP... I feel like I'm in a chick flick montage getting a makeover from my new best gal pals on our way to hit the town and paint it RED and leave dudes unconscious in our wake! YES HUNTAY!

**m4ttycool** (8): I've decided all the haters everywhere can suck my dick. Queen

**MissyBee37** (8): A highlight. Her fun, high-energy pulses through every element. Electric.

**MrSwearword** (8): I'll give her credit for her splitting the difference between 2009sha and better production. Some of the vocals do suck, though.

**rickikardashian** (8): This sounds like the song of a Disney movie that was only aired on TV and released on DVD. Thanks god i love those:)

**SpanKKy1** (8): we love a fun bop

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Great song placement

**vayyiqra** (8): this is more like it

**vhqv1997** (8): If the lyris were less explicit I could totally hear this on the Hannah Montana original soundtrack

**crowlily** (7.7): Ooooh I like the chorus! And I feel like actually I like this quite a lot! Ooooh I like the oooooh before the LET THEM TALK! I should adopt Kesha's mentality really.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): a bop but also very Guitar Hero

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): So I was raised by a dad who LOVES classic rock so I actually freaking love the energy in this song and I feel like this could be a track that we can jam out together, rather than me playing it and him turning off the radio.

**robbiec\_** (7): I thought she sounded like a cat the first time I heard this and she still does but it works

**sletrab07** (7): I'm always in two minds about this one. I think the power pop throwback is pretty cool, but her vocals in the verses grate a little bit. The bridge is pretty ballsy, I like it a lot.

**stardustanddinos** (7): I am constantly struck by how sincere the delivery of lyrics is in this album. Shows here too.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): When I heard Eagles of Death Metal would be on a Kesha album, I was intrigued, but when I heard the product of both of these songs, I was iffy. This is easily the best of the two songs they were involved with, but even here it's a bit muddy and overwhelming. There's a great chorus here but it's obscured by just how much is going on.

**Lazy, fun, but overall misguided**
---

**dirdbub** (6.5): it's a fun song but I absolutely emember nothing about it

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): yall overrate this song so much.... the lyrics are cute but its probably the least best on rainbow besides finding you

**DraculaWeekend** (6): This song is fun but there is something about the production on the EODM songs on this album that I just don't like.

**Raykel** (6): I like the verses but hate the chorus. Something feels childish (in a bad way) about it.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this is lazy rock writing but whatever i can't drag the whole album

**VodkaInsipido** (6): it's a shame her delivery is ruined by the production all around because it'd be a 9

**CarlieScion** (5): I was gonna give this an 8 for the catchy chorus until I realized that the chorus is a straight rip-off of Shake it by Metro Station.

**SkyBlade79** (3): sounds like a watered down version of old kesha lyric wise, without the charm of old kesha's musical style

**thetimidmartian** (3): misled, it sounds like 2000's pop rock

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): i don't like this at all

I'm one of the few Swifties that doesn't love this song. (as I gave it a 10, oop). 

The writing in the first verse is clunky, and doesn't flow well, and the opening lines of the choruses aren't great. 

Do I regret giving it a 10? A bit. 

But it ultimately didn't change its placement.

---

**Call It Like It Is. Perfection**
--- 

**MashLuke** (11): this is perfect. The best song in the album and in the rate

**nooodisaster** (11): "At least I did one thing right." It took the whole thing, but here's the song that justifies this album. Lyrically, it's a beautiful mix of her themes of reputation and the drama, and heart-fluttering love. Jake goes ALL OUT here, from the echoing intro to the little whispers in the chorus. This song feels so at peace with itself, to the point where I can see the jet streams and head-down lovers she describes perfectly.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): I know this is gonna get demolished, and I've come to terms with that. 2017 was a rough year for me, full of some ups, a lot of downs, and a lot of loneliness. I drank too much and loved too little. I scampered to party after party to find some reason to keep partying. Around September of 2017, I met someone who would change my life. Call It What You Want is our song. I didn't actually like this track all too much when we first listened to it together, but ever since it's only grown on me more. In fact, it's my most played song of 2017, and by quite a large margin. There's something here, only contextualized by going through countless heartbreak, that Taylor wrestles with, and you can hear it. Sure, there's the trap-influenced instrumentation that I'm sure elicited a few eyerolls, but there's layers here. Vocal effects, a decadent range of synths, and perhaps her most unfiltered songwriting on the entire album easily makes this my favorite track on the album, and there's a feeling ofnostalgia and comfort that sounds like an entire decade of searching, and finally finding what it is you are missing. Sure, there's the admittedly underwritten first verse, but there's also the blessed bridge, one of my favorite moments of 2017, music or otherwise. A day 1 song or a day 3 song, call it what you want, but it's still one of my favorites from last year.

**1313Harbor** (10): Easily my favorite single from Reputation. Sort of like the junior version of Run Away With Me (all shade).

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): the most acclaimed song in the popdom and for a reason. it feels honest and personal but its also cute and light-hearted and honestly who doesn't want a relationship like this??

**CarlieScion** (10): I'm just gonna call this song a 10

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): very safe like Delicate, but the lyrics are actually a bit sweeter and meaningful imo

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (10): wow

**cyborglilith** (10): call me Tory Lanez, because I'm whigless.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): "Trust him like a brother"

**dropthehammer11** (10): This is honestly really fucking good. Sounds like a 1989 leftover except its better than like...every song on 1989.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This song works for me, unlike that flop /u/wailordfan, do our rates btw! But anyways, call it what you want, but I love this song.

**fifthchevron** (10): "He built a fire just to keep me warm" - I really hope I find someone who makes me feel like this song. Every time I hear this I think "We weren't ready for romantic Taylor lyrics". Well I wasn't, anyway…

**followingfreeways** (10): this song has had such an impact on me. I love singing this to my bf cause im cheesy like that and also I love how it's all about how she's doing better than she ever was, because I felt the same way when this song came out. I'll forever love this song

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): Okay this was my favourite song on the album immediately. Loved it ever since I heard it as a single. Even tho New Years Day serves as a nice epilogue, CIWYW is the true and rightful closer of Reputation.

**itsboogiepanda** (10): The perfect love song and really nice place to round off Reputation. This is Taylor finally finding her happiness and not caring about anything else or what anyone says. So happy for my girl finally, but also lowkey sad that it's not me she chose

**joshually** (10): As white bread as Call Me By Your Name so that I keep mistaking the 2 for each other, but it is a really pretty song, like opening up a colorful MOMA umbrella during a dreary wet rainy dusk.

**leviswift13** (10): One of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard. This is the kind of love that we all aspire to.

**melodyllic\_** (10): taylor does not disappoint with her emotional, slow tracks. soft, sweet and peaceful, while still maintaining an undeniable sense of movement

**Piccprincess** (10): This is my and my bf's "song" I love him so much <3 <3

**robbiec\_** (10): love the SNL performance of this and would like to hear a RED version of this

**skargardin** (10): A pretty, raw and emotional ballad. It's so darn cute and the production is so soothing in a sense.

**theNealCutter** (10): you made happy jelly boy, don't forget that. you may not be mine anymore and i may not be yours anymore, but it doesn't mean I don't cherish what we had.

**TheStarSquad** (10): Such a perfect song. One of the best out of the many love songs about Joe purely because of it's lyrical and emotional superiority. It references her past songs and her reputation just enough where it is appreciated but not overdone. The way she talks about Joe in this song specifically makes their relationship seem much more real than in King of My Heart or End Game. The stand out lyric for me is "at least I got one thing right". After everything that has happened to her over the past year, this song is all about rising above and focusing on the positive things that are in her life, especially Joe. I absolutely love CIWYW.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): the bridge is the only thing I want to listen to when I get to heaven

**zamomattel** (10): i hated this when it came out but now it definitely is one of my faves

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9.5): a bop

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Great penultimate song.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): woot for incest

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): cute

**jonnl2806** (9): Reminds me of 1989

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): this is really good, but I feel like it's also relatively weak when put with other edgy songs such as "End Game".

**natsby** (9): this really grew on me. at first I was extremely underwhelmed, but there is something gorgeous about the instrumentation and the uniquely jaded but hopeful tone it has. also the melody of 'I recall/late November/holding my breath/slowly I said' is so beautifully violin-like. captivating.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): First song released from Reputation that a majority of people liked, and I'm one of those fans of this song who associates it with somebody I love very much. Funnily enough, even if this is Taylor's most adventurous album so far, this is one of the better songs despite the simplicity. Crowning Moment of Heartwarming indeed.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I'm amazed at how strong this album finishes given it starts so mediorce. Definitely my favorite single from rep.

**VeganSquash** (9): everybody says the brother line is creepy but it isn't? It means she trusts him like family why is that creepy?

**crowlily** (8.9): this is my favorite song, it makes me feel so safe and warm. I love the synths and the softness of it.

**jhxcb** (8.9): Almost a nine, but not quite. It's sweet, but it also sounds like a reworked reject from 1989, rewritten to try to fit Reputation. It ends up sounding kind of messy, when it could have been a great, really sweet song.

**awryj** (8.8): surprisingly catchy, makes me think of the postal service in a weird way

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm calling it a retread of "Liability (Reprise)".

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): this song has grown on me so much. I absolutely hated it when it came out and it was made worse by everyone loving it because I just hate hype trains and circlejerks, but it's a good song.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): My favorite part of the song is how the song seamlessly builds up the chorus as the song goes on, but I can't ignore the lines about jet streams or necklaces.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): My first listen upon release were that it was a lot of good buildup to nothing-- I listened to it and literally didn't realize I had heard the chorus. However, it's really grown on me since then. It has a subtle catchiness and great production, as well as real, believable emotion. I really wish the rest of the album was like this.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): really pretty. that's all

**camerinian** (8): I like that Taylor, at least for once, feels content in herself in her partner. This would have been a fine way to close the album tbh

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Similarly sweet and soulful, good show of how nice Taylors voice can be

**enecks** (8): This is like snapping out of a bad dream when it plays after This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things. Look, old Taylor isn't dead! She knows how to use lyrical details to tell a narrative right now! Parts of the bad dream echo in the mind - the bad fly like a jetstream metaphor, the excessive hihats. But at least the worst is over.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (8): The lyrics in the verses feel clunky but I love the vibe here. Carly Rae Jepsen is shook by that bridge.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): it's a sweet song aside from the weird kanye bashing first part

**stardustanddinos** (8): This is like a warm cuddle and light breeze bottled into a cute love song. It's earnest and adorable, well done.

**strawberryswing1** (8): clean's inferior little sister and the brother line and "liars calling me one" is straight cringe, but this song is cute

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): The juxtaposition from TIWWCHNT is relieving

**vayyiqra** (8): Born to Die meets Emotion

**vhqv1997** (8): It's a good song but can be better. I just feel like it doesn't reach the same songwriting standards that Taylor has exhibited in the past

**whatareblackhole** (8): I actually really love this song. I wish it would've been the album closer though…

**swadadu** (7.5): The production feels like it belongs in a Donkey Kong Country game water level. This is a big compliment.

**topesmachine** (7.5): kinda basic but good basic i guess

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): Kind of redundant. New Year's Day is basically a better version of this, without the short, distracting tangents about drama (and the apparent interpolation of Carol of the Bells)

**fourchip** (7): so overrated and kind of boring but i like the production

**letsallpoo** (7): the popjustice rate host described this song as a "masterclass in missing the point" and that description has stuck with me ever since. still a cute song though

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): this is fine.

**quaerex** (7): It had so much potential and then she had to invoke incest with the "trust him like a brother" line. I also have an unhealthy hatred for the "I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck/Not because he owns me/But because he really knows me" line because it's so stupid, unsubtle, and immature. Stop wearing initials, Taylor, this isn't junior high.

**thetimidmartian** (7): some of the better songwriting on the album, but it sounds too similar to other reputation tracks

**I'll Call It a Lack of Taste**
---

**specfagular** (6.5): She's good, but she ain't great

**MissyBee37** (6.2): I didn't like this when she released it, but with the rest of the album, it fares a little better.

**MrSwearword** (6): lack of self awareness/case of unfortunate irony 101; Taylor Swift singing "All the drama queens taking swings"; because there are way worse songs on this album, I'll be nice again with scoring.

**gannade** (5.5): This song was a solid 9 or 10 but that bridge is one of the cringiest things ever.

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (5): A wonderful song dragged so far down byt Taylor clumsily throwing in reputation references

**DraculaWeekend** (5): This goes nowhere…zzzz

**Glennishill** (5): This song is just sad honestly. What should be sweet instead sounds like a teenager bragging about their bf in a myspace post.

**SkyBlade79** (5): would be good without the petty undertones

**dirdbub** (4): it's just.. boring. nothing's there

**JackLebowski** (3): The thing that annoys me the most in this tracks are the best. This could've easily been a pop country song and it would be a 7-8.

**kappyko** (0): I'm sorry but this is hopelessly boring and unmelodic.

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.6): First I'm just gonna get my controversial opinion out of the way: The “trust him like a brother” line is actually my favourite line in the song. Yes I understand why people don't like it, but for me (no I don't have a thing for my brother) it just feels like something you would say to someone who you really care about.

This was another anti-grower for me. The more I played it, the more I realized this doesn't really fit with the rest of the album at all. 

It was a cute bop, but nothing more, and didn't really pack anything to make it stand out. 

---

**LITERALLY INVENTED FEMINISM, Beyonce can't relate** 
--- 

**milkywayinradius** (11): horns in pop songs is my weakness

**1313Harbor** (10): My mom can be old-fashioned about music and thinks that cussing in songs is highly inappropriate. However, I played this song for her after telling her about Kesha and the background of the song's creation, and she is now fully on board and added it to her running playlist. Kesha queen of feminism.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): BOP!!!!!!! i love this empowering anthem wow it really deserved better. too slept on. those horns fucking slap throughout the entire thing. talk about a collaboration that we never knew we wanted but we always needed.

**Albert\_Cole** (10): She opened the concert with this, it was fucking *amazing*. The entire room yelled along, and she flipped us all the bird. 10/10, would shout "I'm a motherfucking woman" at the top of my lungs again

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): another fucking bop, it made me scream "im a motherfucking woman" in a middle of a club and like, im not even one. queen of making me do things i dont want to

**CarlieScion** (10): IM A MOTHERFUCKING WOMAN

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): She really fucking did it I love her so much

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): camp! fun! bop!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Kesha basically took a concept of a Meghan Trainor song and made it 1000 times better. I may a gay man but I feel fucking empowered in this song. And that bridge? Kesha DID THAT.

**dropthehammer11** (10): This is fucking LIT. I'm not a woman but goddamn I wish I was when I hear this shit. So fierce, so fun, so full of life.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Kesha back to her fun party self, but with her new style incorporated into it. A album highlight for sure. I'm a motherfuckin" woman, are you?

**enecks** (10): I'm not going to lie - I love this album so much because I enjoy so many songs in it as trans anthems lol. I love singing along to this song - the most fun track in the album - hell even Kesha's laughing along and having a good time! Whenever someone calls me a he or deadnames I want to sing this song right to their fucking faces. I'M A MOTHERFUCKING WOMAN!

**followingfreeways** (10): do I even need an explanation for this? one of the best feminist bops of 2017. makes me proud to be a woman and I loveee screaming this at the top of my lungs

**jhxcb** (10): There' a reason Rainbow became one of my top albums instantly. I've very rarely encountered an album that deserved multiple 10/10s on individual tracks. Woman is no exception. I don't think there's a way to improve this song.

**kappyko** (10): With one song, Kesha does Mark Ronson better than Mark Ronson did with Gags lol

**m4ttycool** (10): MOTHERFUCKING WOMAN

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Invented Feminism, Invented women, invented music. Don't @ me.

**poppinmmolly** (10): feminist af!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this is the only 10 i have i don't even think it's that great but my god i really don't like any of these albums

**SupremeShani** (10): I am still in awe that Kesha created feminism on this album.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): megabop

**topesmachine** (10): god this song is beautiful and the interactions between her and the band are so cute

**vhqv1997** (10): I don't care what gender you are, either you scream the chorus of this song every time it comes on or you're a sexist monster

**whatareblackhole** (10): Fuck yes, women!

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): This song is pure FUN. The horns are so much fun here. The only reason this isn't a 10 is cause the last part of the second verse just going to laughing is not that good musically imo, while it definitely shows Kesha's having some fun.

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Perfect mix of the fun attitude we all loved from "Ke$ha" with the maturity & artistry of Kesha. It's funky, sassy & carefree in the best way, but it doesn't sound like a drunk party anthem; it has more teeth than that with themes of both female- & self-empowerment. The Dap-Kings kill it! Their horns are supreme.

**skargardin** (9.5): A funky, sassy, infinite bop. I love the ad-libs and the horns are magical.

**zamomattel** (9.5): invented being female

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (9): "Im a motherfucker" is possibly the worst way to enter into that horn breakdown. The rest of the song is perfect.

**gannade** (9): a bop

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): This song is carefree, it's unapologetic, like cmon, she's a motherfucking woman yall!

**leviswift13** (9): Feminist icon, we stan!

**MashLuke** (9): this dude here feels like a proud woman

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Not terribly deep or anything, but sometimes an empowerment anthem just needs to mix being campy, defiant and fun, and Woman does it particularly well. Mmm, yeah!

**tevinterimperium** (9): This is such a fun song to listen to even though the lyrics are a little cringey

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): There's still a part of me that feels like this too on-the-nose substanceless, but it's kinda all washed away by how fun and brash this song is. Kesha doesn't exactly sell the "IDGAF" attitude, and I'm not a fan of the way she enunciates "motherfucker," but the horns and the explosiveness of the song bumps this one up a few points. It's a wild song from Kesha, and it's just a ton of fun.

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): Unapologetic fun for all the right reasons

**theNealCutter** (9): same comments with Let 'Em Talk, Kesha's best quality is her amazing stage-presence. Paired with just as fun production from The Dap-Kings Horns, it's just match made well. ITS A BOP.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Another kick-ass hook. I honestly think Kesha's hooks have never been better. I'm so glad this song exists in today's climate, we need more empowerment tracks that go off.

**thetimidmartian** (9): defiant and confident. her placement is very forward as opposed to bastards, she verges on screaming often.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): yee haw 

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): This song is sooo fun. Love the horns!!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This song took me a while to warm up to it, but now I just love to internally shout 'I'm a motherfucking woman' in my head because I am a woman.

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): Love the horns and the playful and cheeky tones of the melody and lyrics. The bridge kinda drags a bit tho.

**jonnl2806** (8.5): The bridge on this should be an anthem

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): A MOTHERFUCKING BOP

**PenOrAPencil** (8.5): DON'T TOUCH MY WEAVE DON'T CALL ME HONEY

**It's a Bop, but not a BOP, you know what I mean?**
---

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): This is definitely a good pop song all around but I feel like it's slightly lacking in momentum. Also this was a bad choice for 2nd single imo, Learn To Let Go deserved

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): i mean it's a bop but doesn't reach issa bop status if you know what i mean

**dwarfgourami** (8): This song grew on me a lot after I saw it live

**melodyllic\_** (8): sorta like a diluted version of let em talk tbh. memorable for the "ok shuT UP" and "dont call me honey"

**vayyiqra** (8): : fuck yeah feminism

**VeganSquash** (8): is that a chicken laughing at the end of the song? lol

**twat\_brained** (7.7): "OKAY SHUT UP" me when this comes on. The Precision F Strikes on this song are expertly placed. Could do without the out-of-place laughs though.

**crowlily** (7.6): Wow empowering! Feel-good wow! I love her laugh during the song wow! Is this a bridge? I like this bridge-ish thingy! I love this message honestly! DON'T TOUCH MY WEED... omg is it weave or weed

**awryj** (7.5): That second verse is absolutely great, I love it when singers don't sing in their songs (and that's why I stan Selena)

**deadspiderwall** (7.5): I like when she starts laughing in the middle.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): can't relate. It'd probably be BOMB live tho.

**stardustanddinos** (7.5): The horns! This song is so catchy, and come thru with the girl power message mama. Scheiße is shaking!

**fourchip** (7): this aged really quickly for me

**Glennishill** (7): I dig the sentiment of this song but it's soooo on the nose. The chorus is catchy and I dig the horns a lot. It's one of the better songs on the album.

**MrSwearword** (7): great production but the fact she didn't end the chorus right on I'M A MOTHERFUCKIN' WOMAN is egregious as fuck.

**SpanKKy1** (7): ended sexism

**Piccprincess** (6.5): why is there a fucking child at the end

**robbiec\_** (6): As a Sharon Jones fan

**Meghan Trainor out-feminized**
---

**sletrab07** (5.5): The cheap "girl power" lyrics were tired when Meghan tried them and they're tired here too. The sentiment is great, but there's gotta be a better way to serve the message.

**dirdbub** (5): I liked the song a bit before (minus the "don't touch my weed" line coming off to me as one of those "look guys, I smoke" lines for some odd reason), but this song is falling victim to radio overplay where I live :c

**itsboogiepanda** (5): Not my vibe, too jazzy

**swadadu** (5): This would be much higher if the bridge wasn't almost a minute long.

**MaximumFriendship** (4): this song just felt so weird after Praying was released and she seems screechy

**SkyBlade79** (4): cheap and pandering, this is just made for drag queens to walk down the runway to. Outro is nice, bridge is horrible.

**fifthchevron** (2): idk it just reminds me of commercialised feminism, like t-shirts that say, "my pussy grabs back!" and vagina hats.

**joshually** (2): Call me old and conservative, but all that unnecessary cussin and fussin, I don't like it, I tell you!!!

**cyborglilith** (0): no.

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (8.4): I actually really liked this song right when it came out, but now its probably in the lower half of the album. Lyrics are kinda weak, Katy does a better job with the theme on Power, but we'll get to that later (or maybe we already have? I don't know). Tbh though there isn't exactly anything bad with Kesha's bold lyrics. Sometimes you just want scream that you're a woman, and for that I give it points.

Fun fact. 

This song started at number 1, and stuck around for a few days. It left the top 5 about a couple days before the end of the month, and never was able to get enough traction to crack it again. 

Katy unfortunately leaves the rate, about .03 points shy of a top 5 song. 

--- 

**CERTIFIED GOOD TASTE**
--- 

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (11): Dark disco. Aesthetics. Killer instrumental. Awesome hook. Tastefully woke lyrics. No Rubiks cube references. More than anything, I love the transitions between the verse, pre chorus, chorus, and outro. Also Skip Marley's voice sounds really good on this track.

**izeasklapaucius** (11): You laugh now, but this song is gonna be an underrated classic in the next 10/20 years. Ping me if this happen (it will don't worry).

**MrSwearword** (11): hell has frozen over and a KATY PERRY song got my eleven...and it's this one. Why? Because it's the 3rd time I've been legitimately impressed by a Katy Perry single because more oft than not, those usually suck but not this time. Sanction me or Crimea river, I love this song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): bop and fuck you if you disagree

**tevinterimperium** (11): I understand people don't like this because of the vague, milquetoast political message, but this song is absolutely amazing, and the Skip Marley feature takes the song to the next level.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): Easily one of my favorite pop songs of 2017. The hook is just melodically great, Max Martin brings some groovy production, and Katy slays vocally. It stays wonderful every time I listen to it.

**Albert\_Cole** (10): Deserved better than #4, but I'm still glad this was the lead single and got a decent amount of airplay.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): nothing to say about it. i love the lyrics, love the mv, loved the hype, lived for this song. also IT HAS SIA LYRICS IN IT HOW CAN I RATE IT DOWN

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): disco-tinged goodness! a pop confection of the highest order! is it faux-woke? a bit, especially considering the now over-pointed-out point that she's been one of the biggest stars on the radio this decade; maybe it's a bit of an acknowledgement of her own complacency in the "system." regardless, as an actual song it's amazing and so fresh and gorgeous. plus it has one of her best music videos.

**dirdbub** (10): me: this era started out on the premise of "woke pop", but then released "Bon appétit" as a single? what the fuck is this, do it the other way around so people don't roast you for this. kinda damages the song's reputation a bit | also me: this is a SOTY

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Ah fuck, imagine if Witness is an album with this type of sound, I am sure Popheads would fuck with it. I would say that besides seeing the song not doing well in the charts, the rollout and hype around CTTR was a moment I would never forget, from putting a snippet into disco balls around the world to the music video. Ugh, she is good at doing promo, unlike another fave of mine who is in this rate. 👀 It's such a shame everything else after that went downhill from there.

**dropthehammer11** (10): Super groovy production by Max here. I dig this song a lot.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Katy Perry being woke is better than most being woke.

**fourchip** (10): i will gladly let myself be chained to this rhythm

**m4ttycool** (10): I'm wok now

**MissyBee37** (10): Gorgeous, glorious disco. Call it fake-woke if you want, but I hear nothing but genuine reflection & concern, implicating herself and everyone else, too. Also, a pop banger that could make me dance for hours. And I don't think those ideas clash; she means to catch our attention and keep us dancing but thinking at the same time.

**PuggleMaster** (10): Deserved better!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**rickikardashian** (10): Okay, maybe Katy Perry shouldn't have gone for the W O K E P O P route, but damn this song is really good. The production is one of her bests and the lyrics aren't all that dumb im trying hard to ignore "wasted zombie" k, like, in some ways she kinda has a point, and the video is really nice visually. This song deserved better than what it got

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i unironically love this, even is the lyrics are kind of fake deep/contradictory coming from her

**sletrab07** (10): God I bopped to this for like all of February and into March. This song saved me from succumbing to college anxiety.

**zamomattel** (10): the vid for this is so good

**Glennishill** (9.5): An essential Katy track at this point, especially last year. The song's got a lot of personal meaning for me because I know many people who live in bubbles and ignore real problems because they don't affect them. I didn't give a ten because I'm not that into Skip Marley.

**kappyko** (9.5): Somebody on RYM called the pianos on this "velvety" and I love that description but it still somehow doesn't do that justice? The sounds of the keys throughout this are so fluttery and gossamer-esque, it's really entrancing to hear that in this track. The urban "wooh!" sample before the chorus is fun, I still think the delivery is a little weird, but this is a strong outing. Somebody is going to reference the tone-deaf line about Katy's own vocals lol

**VeganSquash** (9.5): Katy is more woke than most of you don't lie to yourselves when you say this isn't woke.

**angusaditus** (9): a messy intro to the era but we love a disco bop http://i.imgur.com/Opu83WB.gif

**enecks** (9): I'm coming out of the closet as pansexual. No wait trans. No wait a furry. No wait one of those furries who finds lizard ladies hot. No, the most shocking of all - a fan of this single. Once I interpreted it as Katy criticising herself and not trying to make everyone woke, it works so well. This production is just slick as hell. I love it.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (9): Shamepop: pop that shames you for listening to pop. Love the bassline; this would be an easy 10 if the lyrics packed more punch.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): my mom once heard this song in the car and asked me sang it. I said Katy Perry and then she said "wow Katy Perry knows how to make good catchy music".

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Aside from the woke part, I still really like this song tbh and never really understood the major problems it had

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): I actually really like Chained to the Rhythm. It's a catchy song, has a meaning behind it without being too divisive (I wasn't expecting an incendiary message just yet from Katy so this was a good enough step), and I'm a sucker for an amazing outro.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Woke™ Katy doesn't do much for me, but I still like this.

**nooodisaster** (9): My relationship with this song in four acts: 1) This is a decent comeback song, it's pretty catchy! 2) Wtf, why are the lyrics serious, how am I supposed to bop to this mess now? 3) Wow the rest of Witness is AWFUL, maybe I should reconsider this one. 4) TURN IT UP IT'S YOUR FAVORITE SONG DANCE DANCE DANCE

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I was really surprised when I ended up liking this song a lot after it came out in early 2017. Katy's vocals are really good here, especially near the end of the song, and Skip is surprisingly good. The lyrics aren't very effective in what they're trying to do, but it's still one of my favorite songs from Katy.

**skargardin** (9): Skip wasn't really necessary imo but everything else is so insanely catchy.

**thetimidmartian** (9): the belted ad libs are amazing, the outro is perfect, she's a little heavy handed with the political theme and im unsure about the skip marley feature

**jonnl2806** (8.5): I actually thought it was a great lead single and Skip Marley is amazing here too!

deleted: **Issa Bop, but not the Bop That We Wanted**
--- 

**Marshynarsh** (8.5): I love the production/instrumental of this song, could had done with a few lyric tweaks though

**CarlieScion** (8): This song is good, albeit slightly hypocritical

**leviswift13** (8): I think this song is good, but shouldn't have been the lead. The "dance-dance-dance to the distortion" is one of the best pop moments of 2017.

**MashLuke** (8): woke or not, trite or original, this is really a nice song.

**melodyllic\_** (8): mindlessly catchy and vaguely meaningful, not fit for a lead single.

**strawberryswing1** (8): would be better without the feature

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Should've been the second single

**TragicKingdom1** (8): This gets WAY too much flack lyrically. The lyrics aren't flawlessly executed but at least she had a concept and stuck to it for the most part! Also it has a great melody and production which are both more important than lyrics for me.

**vayyiqra** (8): solid bop

**vhqv1997** (8): I'm sure many people found it a bit vague vague and that it didn't go anywhere particularly meaningful. Still a bop tho

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7.6): ok so i liked it when it came out i guess but in context of the album does it really fit??

**twat\_brained** (7.6): It's been a whole year and despite many in-depth analyses of this song + Todd in the Shadows' review of it, it's very hard to see this song as being the very thing it's supposed to criticize. I guess Skip's verse was supposed to increase the overall "wokeness"? It's got some of the best production on the album, but the lyrics just make me feel weird. The video sure doesn't aid matters, either.

**crowlily** (7.5): I actually like this song quite a lot. I know the lyrics ain't very good but I like this!

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): This chorus is so fun

**Raykel** (7.5): This song gave me a nightmare once about me and my friends getting to the amusement park late and only getting to go on 1 ride and somehow this song warned us about it. I think it represents the song message well.

**stardustanddinos** (7.5): Ayyy I like the reggae influenced production and the message even if muddled and ironic coming from a popstar, works just fine.

**theNealCutter** (7.5): it's the irony of everything she sung about, it's the ultimate self-depreciating anthem. and seeing her flop more and more commercially, it just proves the lyrical content more and more correct with each failing single.

**1313Harbor** (7): Sylvan Esso did this song better with Radio.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Actually pretty fun, the instrumental finally has some character and theres an actually decent melody and hook

**joshually** (7): This song isn't bad per se... it's just awful in the context it was placed in…. maybe in 20 years we'll areppcaite it for the anthemic mis-en-place song of the times it truly was in a post-Trump America????

**natsby** (7): I don't like this song but it scores higher because I think Katy just does poppier songs like this better (at least on this album)

**robbiec\_** (7): this may have the most pointless guest rapper verse of twentyseventeen but I thought this was a fun song even if it was a bit misguided as the lead single which totally should have been Power

**whatareblackhole** (7): I like this song, but it doesn't sound like Katy likes it all that much…

**jhxcb** (6.8): It's moderately catchy, but it seems a little generic.


**Bad First Single/Bad Guest Verse/Guest Verse Best Part**
--- 

**quaerex** (6.5): This isn't a bad lead, but it's a little too vague to usher in the era of woke-pop Katy was hoping for.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I do have so many issues about this song, but the song itself is safe enough and easy to sing along to.

**deadspiderwall** (6.3): WOKE

**awryj** (6): I remember an interview with Sia from late 2015 or so where she spoke about her collab with Katy. She called her "dominant and nitpicky/stubborn" or sth like that and she said that she was thankful that at least some of the songs she wrote with got accepted... So please don't blame poor girl Sia for this lyrical disaster.

**Brendon-Urine** (6): I'm an unashamed Sia stan, so obviously I'm going to like this song on some level, but still... eh.

**camirose** (6): This score is heavily inflated by it's company. The beat is a bop but the lyrics are kind of too cringe-y for my taste.

**dwarfgourami** (6): Skip added NOTHING to this song, katy should have just done the bridge

**followingfreeways** (6): I miss Teenage Dream

**Piccprincess** (6): one of the better ones on the album

**SkyBlade79** (6): kind of overrated here imho. It's definitely not the best song on the album by any stretch. Lyrics are bad and fake woke,

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Damnit, Katy. I almost ran around Williamsburg looking for disco balls for this track, hoping for a truly engaging dance bop, and what I got was a half-baked, all-assed /r/im14andthisisdeep anthem that feels right out of those facebook posts where people are chained to their phones. And, while the instrumental is nice (and the chorus is mediocre, but one of the best on the album, actually), Skip Marley comes in and tragically further ruins this song that could've been a lot better. I will say, I really do like the outro.

**topesmachine** (6): most of this song is a jam but the chorus is bad

**itsboogiepanda** (5): Maybe I'm not getting this song because I'm not woke enough

**fifthchevron** (4): Skip deserved better

**Mudkip1** (4): skip's verse ruins this for me

**camerinian** (1): Guys ECHO CHAMBERS EXIST and YOU'RE ALL IN THEM don't you feel ASHAMED time to WAKE YOURSELVES UP and STOP DANCING TO MUSIC. I, KATY PERRY, DECREE THAT YOU SHAN'T HAVE FUN UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE WHY AREN'T YOU AS WOKE AS ME YOU FUCKING PEASANTS

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (0): no https://i.redd.it/uzvkrorw1r501.jpg this tried to be political but failed, i would expect this from a minion memes facebook page

=====

1998tweety: **1998tweety** (9.2): I distinctly remember not being super into this song when it came out, but that could partially be because the video came out the day after Love did and it overtook it in terms of views so I may have just been a little salty. I think the song is good, but I felt like it was missing that kick that most Katy Perry singles have. I think (?) its a bit slower than most of her leads and although the lyrics arent amazing they're 100% better than Roar. I think the may issue with this song was how vague the lyrics are, I recall this being the main critiscm people had with it. It was trying to make a point but wasn't being clear on exactly what it was. I do appreciate Katy taking a risk but I would have preferred if she went all in. The rap-verse is okay, I don't feel like it took anything away from the song, but I also wouldn't say that it added much. Definitely takes a few listens but now I'd say its probably one of the better songs on Witness.

Earlier today, I was having a play around and managed to add some emotes to the sub! For the time being, we've only got 10 or so added, and it'll keep that way while we see how it affects the sub.

Now, we've seen [](#meghan), but I'll leave it to the rest of you to work the rest out for the time being :) If your preview isn't showing for an emote, then it's not an emote.

And in case you don't know how to do it, the code is:

    [](#emote)

So for meghan, you put meghan in instead of emote.

deleted: # Katy Perry - Witness

---

**Overall average**: 6.717

--- 
 
**[ALL AVERAGES](https://pastebin.com/0xYfrM4B)**

---


Unfortunately, we see our first death. 

Katy fails to see the top 5, meeting her demise with Chained to the Rhythm leaving at number 6. 

A fun, sometimes messy, slew of synth-pop, that ultimately was executed a bit muddy at the hands of Max Martin. 

With a meme-d era, and messy roll-out, plus Taylor releasing her discography on Spotify the night of release, Katy ultimately had one of her most tragic eras with Witness. There are pieces of gold here that ultimately won't be admired the way they should because of the context of release, but know that we appreciated the music, and hope to see songs like Roulette and Act My Age in KP5.

**TragicKingdom1**: Witness is undeserving of the level of hatred it gets on this sub. It is not a good album, and the album rollout was a complete trainwreck, but I think it has a few consistent strengths. First of all, the production here is really interesting; it's not 100% good but it does take risks and I can't really call any of it generic. Second, although the "woke" aesthetic is only half-attempted, on some songs she does sell it quite well; the title track and Pendulum would both fit perfectly on the album people wanted to see, for example. The album is flawed in the sense that Katy still has not learned how to make a ballad (this was a place where the production did not do her favors) and that an average of once per song there's going to be a line so terrible it takes you out of the song. So ultimately, the songwriting overall is pretty average, the production overall is pretty good, and there are a few stinkers ruining the package. [Grade: C+]

**enecks**: I described Reputation as an album as a fascinating mess. This album is fascinating, but it's closer to boring mediocrity than anything else. Some of the more retro tracks work, and there's some fun guilty pleasures, but it's bland. I've rethought my opinion on the album as a cohesive piece after my scores - I don't think it's pseudo woke so much as it is a self-flagellating attempt to be relevant. The target for a lot of the criticism this album has to give is Katy. If Do What U Want was on this album, everyone would lose their shit - it'd fit perfectly with this submissive spiral of terror.

**dirdbub**: this album is the definition of whelming

**kappyko**: It's kind of weird how almost every song on this album gets better or even just good by the second or last chorus, building its way to a satisfying ending rather than using its punch on the first hit of the chorus. Not complaining, that kind of structure is used pretty well here. Love the future house influence on a lot of this, the aesthetic is gorgeous, and every song is really a grower.

**stardustanddinos**: This album is now a meme of sorts, because it has been Katy’s fall from pop dominance. It’s a remarkable change of tone – something you’d rightly expect from a 30-something artist. There’s heartbreak, growth and more importantly – introspection. Katy is anxious of her position as a popstar, as a grown woman and it shows. It’s not her best work, the lyrics are terrible in places, but the lush and modern production is among the most interesting I’ve seen this year, something this album MUST get credit for. Katy gets massacred in these rates, but I really hope y’all give it a fair chance.

**Mudkip1**: :/ i think i rated some of these songs a bit too high but oh well. they're good and fun for the most part but i really dislike how she makes so many songs 4 minutes long. there's not enough interesting material in each track to drag them on for so long

**TheStarSquad**: decent

**agentofscranton**: it's honestly such a shame that Witness was as disappointing as it was, but I did appreciate what Katy was going for and that she was using her voice for something 'Bigger Than Her' as it were

deleted: **patronsaintofaspies**: I'm not a huge stan of this album like a bunch of regulars are, but I do genuinely think it's good enough to get at least a 6 out of 10. There's some very interesting and well-done production here, and while the duds are pretty bad, they're ultimately outnumbered by the more compelling aspects. I think the era didn't work because of shitty promo, and I think the album suffers a lot because of shitty lyrics. But, if we're being honest, it's the only Katy album I truly enjoy. (My 9.6 average for Prism was a big mistake please ignore)

**whatareblackhole**: I think my problem with Witness was how Katy promoted it, which I think is everyone else's problem, too. This is a great breakup album and a fine Katy Perry album, but the "purposeful pop" narrative was overwhelming. However, I think Witness deserves more of a chance. I can't imagine how it feels to be proud of something in front of the world only to have it almost immediately shunned. The loneliness of artifice is probably the worst. Kesha is alone mentally, Taylor romantically, and Katy artistically. She's asking for a witness to her legacy and she'll take anyone who will say yes. We are all afraid of losing our legacy once we're gone, and Katy is no different. I'm glad I decided to do this rate because it helped me to realize that Katy is still creating the great pop music we expect from her - it's forward-thinking, candidly written, ridden with cliché, and embraces a personal definition of "purposeful."

**dwarfgourami**: I really tried to give this album a chance but its sooooo bad

**shineflyer**: After listening to this album, I spiraled into a deep depression for weeks. This is a cursed album.

**strawberryswing1**: Katy that album art is tragic stop it

**cyborglilith**: SHOULD HAVE BEEN POPPY.COMPUTER INSTEAD

**amumumyspiritanimal**: im a hardcore Katy fan, almost a stan(my average for Prism was like 8 or something so I'm def not biased against her), but this album was a major disappointment for me. I really really really loved Chained To The Rhythm(I'm proud to say that my comment is next to it in the Popheads Jukebox wiki, and even though I rated it 8/10 back then I'll def give it a 10 this time around because it's just too good), so getting an album this caliber was really disheartening. Thank god Melodrama dropped later and saved everything for me. The only thing I can admit is that this album was definitely that darker thing she wanted Prism to be, though, I don't know if that should've been the main target of this album. It feels rushed, dishonest, and generic. I think Katy really tried to pour her soul into this, but it didn't really happen as with Prism, and with the half-assed project probably fucked up by her label and other people working on the album(okay ill stop excusing her), it didn't had many bops like TD or OOTB did. Well, she still has many chances to make an amazing album again.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: The thing about Wigless though, is that the promotional period was a mess. Period. Katy could have not emphasized that the album was supposed to be “woke” and it could have performed a little better with the critics. Sales-wise, honestly the album is NOT a flop. It fucking debuted at #1 and an independent artist would kill to have her numbers. I feel like we’re simply at that point where we’re tearing someone down and using their downfall as our entertainment, this isn’t unprecedented, though. Still, the messy era from Witness remains a valid criticism and the fact that she went through 3 different eras while releasing 3 songs before the album dropped definitely affected the overall perception of the project.

**1313Harbor**: This album was so much better than my fellow popheads had prepared me to believe, but I still have no desire to add more than a few tracks to my permanent collection. I agree with the criticism of the lyrics, but I do think that so many of these songs have great production that features Miss Perry’s voice and creativity well. Having said that, I still think it deserves to be the loser of the rate.

**angusaditus**: a great album and a great era! http://i.imgur.com/eoLnptA.gif

**nooodisaster**: This album is criticized for being a mediocre album because of various factors, but mostly because it's a mediocre album. Compared to Katy's other albums, the lows are lower and the highs aren't as high. I've never really been wowed by Katy's intellectual POV or politics, so making a woke/personal album to me seems the worst choice she could've made. We stan Katy bc she makes dumb fun pop, and a lot of Witness is the opposite (well, I guess it's still dumb...). ALL THAT TO BE SAID, I'm getting out all my personal feelings on the album to be able to judge each song individually. Witness as an album is like a 5/10 for me, but I'm gonna try and not let that factor into my song rankings. Basically, rant over, let's get into it. (also read my review from Sep: http://forkthisllama.blogspot.com/)

**Elitefourbrad**: An upward trend from Prism at least. This album had some GREAT production on it for sure, Katy’s lyrics just didn’t match it all the time. I think this is my favorite Katy Perry album though! 5.8/10

**MissyBee37**: This is my second-favorite Katy album, hands down. I make it no secret that I am a loyal and passionate KatyCat. Katy's music and her artistry have changed my life. "Witness" only strengthens that connection for me. I've spent a lot of time trying to understand exactly this album didn't click with the GP or even other pop fans the way it speaks to me, but at the end of the day, what matters to me is that it does speak to me and many of her fans and clearly Katy. I love the music, the messages and the cohesion. Even my lowest-rated songs are songs I truly enjoy. The album showcases her voice in the best way, with songs that highlight all of her strengths and range as a singer. Katy took risks with "Witness," and IMHO they paid off. Her sound is fresh and mesmerizing; her words are meaningful, even when they're fun or seemingly lighthearted. This album is so full of spirit and heart that I can't help but connect to it; it's the kind of album I hesitate to turn off because I don't want to skip or miss any song. I could go on and on, but I'll leave at this: I see you, Katy, and I thank you for letting us in and for sharing your spirit with the world.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Despite how messy the era has been, I think this album is very underrated and I think it deserved a bit more love than it gets. Sure, I was disapointed with the album at first, given it took her three years to release a new album but I gave this more listens and I greatly apperciate that Katy is trying something new with this album by experimenting her sound, to the point we wouldn't expect Katy to do. I just hope Katy does better in the next album cycle. These are tough times for our pop girls.

**SpanKKy1**: lol

**Albert\_Cole**: I want to say this is underrated - the music really grew on me, the lyrics have a very distinct style, and the album as a whole is her most coherent since One of the Boys. But on the other hand, I hadn't listened to any of these for months. I don't want to call it a forgettable album... but I pretty much literally forgot about it until this rate came along. I love it though, for all its flaws.

**DraculaWeekend**: You guys are so over the top about this album. It's not even that bad.

**SkyBlade79**: I’m surprised at how much I like this now that I’m relistening. Wasn’t a fan at the start but it has a really nice vibe. Average:7.353

**twat\_brained**: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Witness. The lyrical themes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of purposeful pop most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also Katy’s vulnerable outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Dan Brown literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they’re not just wocc- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Witness/Katy Perry truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Katy’s existential catchphrase “Bon Appetit Baby,” which itself is a cryptic reference to William Golding's literary epic Lord of the Flies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Max Martin’s genius wit unfolds itself on their Spotify Web Players. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Roulette tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the KatyCats’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

**tevinterimperium** (10): I really love this song, but I also think it would be hilarious if Rihanna won this rate.

**whatareblackhole** (10): HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS SUMMER STORM BOP?

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I love Rihanna.

**topesmachine** (9.5): this song is a damn jam even though it's overplayed as hell

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): eh not bad, but not a 10. still, its a great song

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (9): There's my ultra-repetitive queen.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The lyrics are weak and vague but the production makes up for it. Tbh, I understand why Taylor would prefer to use an alias when writing this song. She doesn't want her relationship with Calvin to overshadow the song. I don't know why he had to shade her ex on radio by saying they might not collab. It's fucking stupid. Among the feuds that Taylor has, I definitely side with Taylor aganist Calvin. I like his music but he comes off as a whiny person to me.

**followingfreeways** (9): idk why but I've always liked this song even b4 I knew Taylor wrote it. I like the way its written

**quaerex** (9): iT'S NOT WE FOUND LOVE BUT IT HAS RIHANNA OKAY??

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): I loved waiting to hear snippets of Taylor but Rihanna really carries this song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): One of my favorite non-Funk Wav Calvin tracks. Rihanna has always been able to adapt well to EDM beats, and Taylor does have a talent for writing pop songs. It's a solid combo pulled off well.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.9): I didn't care about Calvin Harris until this track came out.

**jhxcb** (8.7): It's a decent bop. Not a great one, but decent. I'd love to hear what this would sound like if Taylor recorded it. Not that Rihanna didn't kill it, but I think she would've tweaked it to fit the Reputation era, and that would've been cool to hear.

**leviswift13** (8.7): A perfect dance song!

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): overplayed but its quite a good song once y

**cyborglilith** (8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Taylor's amazing song writing coming through here /s (Calvin's production is great however)

**PenOrAPencil** (8): I don't use this song but goddamn do I bop to it whenever it comes on the radio

**vayyiqra** (8): repetitive bop

**vhqv1997** (8): Taylor, are you sure you want to take credits for these lyrics?

**deadspiderwall** (7.4): written by Taylor Swift®

**crowlily** (7.3): This is fun. i don't think it's brilliant songwriting, and taylor probably couldn't have pulled this off as well in this key, but her acoustic performance was great!

**kromosol** (7.2): ~oh wow~

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): i mean add seven points because rihanna but this song is pretty boring

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): What's the relevance of this song for the rate, I like this song though, the You-u-u-u-u breakdown is nice

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Taylor should've had featured credit on here at least, very repetitive but not bad.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): meh

**skargardin** (7): It's a pretty non-substantial bop, a bit more variety would've been nice.

**strawberryswing1** (7): feels too much like we found love's little sister tbh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This might be the most underwhelming Calvin Harris lead single (for an album that never dropped), but with Rihanna it's a megahit. I would've really liked to hear the Taylor Swift version, tbh.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Taylor's best vocals in this rate

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): Not much from the lyrics department, but good melody and production.

**fourchip** (6): the production on the chorus is really irritating

**Glennishill** (6): This song is fine but really only notable for all the drama it caused.

**natsby** (6): this song wouldn't be better if taylor sang it, but it would be more interesting.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I like his latest album, but I was never a huge fan of Calvin's music or his personality. This seems lazily edited to me, especially with the 'oohh's from Taylor.

**A Real Meh Powerhouse Couple**
---

**awryj** (5): This is... a song. It sounds like a template for a song, like something they would include in some Ableton thingy as a demo. The hook is there, the buildup is there, the beat is there... It's not a bad song but it feels sooo uninspired. It's kinda retro so I guess that's cool.

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): It's basic, but in a not so good way

**robbiec\_** (5): I honestly can't tell if I hate this song or like it half the time

**sletrab07** (5): Rihanna remains completely unbothered by Nils Sjoberg.

**specfagular** (5): tbh I've never been crazy about this song

**itsboogiepanda** (4): Dated, overplayed, popularist crap

**MashLuke** (4): this song will never be good

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): This is boring and basic as fuck, glad Calvin ditched this for the Funk Wavs sound...My Way is even worse.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): I always hated this song. Especially because of how out place "and everybody's watching her" right before the chorus is. The dissonance on "her" is really weird.

**OriginalKappa** (3): i'm so glad calvin harris stopped making this kind of music

**thetimidmartian** (3): rihanna sounds ok but there isnt enough artistic space here for her, the production and songwriting are generic.

**camerinian** (2.5): oouoUOUOuOUououoUOuoUouOUOuouoUOUOuouOUoUOuOUOUou <REPEAT UNTIL DEATH>

**enecks** (2): YOUOOOUUOUU Thank fuck Calvin Harris ditched Taylor for Katy (in collabs)

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Godawful. This song does not fit rihanna's voice, the 3 different lines that make up this song are nothing special & "Youuuuuuuuuu ouuuuuuu" is the worst post-chorus/drop/hook/whatever the fuck I heard in a top 3 hit in a while.

**agentofscranton** (1): i would honestly have preferred not knowing that taylor wrote these lyrics

**Leixander** (1): i honestly despise this song. worst song Rihanna has ever sung in.

Old Taylor decide to show up for a writing session with Jack Antonoff it seems, as Getaway Car seems to be the most direct sonically related song to 1989. 

With a (somewhat cliché) call to a Bonnie and Clyde love story, except a stab in the back, coming from Swift's character, sees Taylor off on her own, with all the benefits of a relationship, leaving her Clyde to die alone. 

It is 80s, it is Bleachers, and it is classic Taylor, and as a result seems to be one of the best received Taylor songs of the rate.

--- 

**I WAS RIDIN' IN A GETAWAY CAR**
--- 

**I WAS CRYIN' IN A GETAWAY CAR**
--- 

**I WAS DYIN' IN A GETAWAY CAR**
--- 

**SAID GOODBYE IN A GETAWAY CAR**
---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I wanted to give Praying my 11 but I am very sure it's going to win whether I gave it an 11 or not so I am going to give my 11 to the most deserving in my heart and it's Getaway Car. This song was everything I want from Pop Taylor to be, which is the same magical feeling that Country Taylor had with the imaginative lyricism that feels like a movie playing in your head combined with a more pop sound in the production that Taylor is born to do. If Taylor is still going to do pop on TS7, have Jack Antonoff produce the entire TS7 please.

**fourchip** (11): Felon Taylor™️ is here it's over for you hoes

**leviswift13** (11): This is the song that Taylor Swift was born to make. Every choice made was the right one, the story is thrilling and heartbreaking, the lyrics are some of the best of her career. The only possible flaw is that the central lyric is misleading. She says that nothing good starts in a getaway car, but this song proves her wrong by being one of the best of her career.

**Piccprincess** (11): FUCK. ME. UP. DADDY ANTONOFF.

**VodkaInsipido** (11): tbh… the 11 of this rate. This is what this album should've sounded like, an evolution of the (almost) perfect sounds 1989 had.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): j a c k a n t o n o f f

**agentofscranton** (10): this seems like something out of Terrible Thrills, but i'm not complaining, i'm a sucker for that classic Antonoff production

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): MY FAVORITE ON THE ALBUM. i really cant say much about it. this is the most 1989-esque song on the album, and i love it. it feels like the perfect mix between New Romantics and reputation, like a bridge between the two. still listening to this often, for a reason. perfect 10

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): she did that https://i.redd.it/irjfw5s4fbxz.jpg

**CarlieScion** (10): This song was my fav the first time I listened through the album. It's so catchy and the production is 10/10. The lyrics tell a story from start to finish

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): beautiful, sweeping, huge, amazing

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Taylor left her Clyde behind for an upgrade, Bonnie wins! We stan!

**followingfreeways** (10): this song is just an absolute masterpiece. I gave delicate my 11 because that song makes me insanely happy and I love it but this song deserves infinite 11's as well, honestly one of her best songs she's ever made

**hikkaru** (10): GO GO GO

**itsboogiepanda** (10): The visuals, the production, the lyrics. As a piece of art, this would definitely be one of Taylor's finest. The Bleachers x Taylor Swift song is one of the strongest from Reputation.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Of all the songs in this album, this is the one that always get stuck on my head on the first listen. That chord-change (I don't know the right words) on bridge and key-change is glorious.

**jimmy345960** (10): Ok so this song was my second love on Rep, if Gorgeous didn't exist this would be my eleven.

**jonnl2806** (10): The perfect example of just how good Taylor is at writing a story into a song.

**Marshynarsh** (10): I love the drama of this song, it feel like the most Taylor Swift song on the album

**melodyllic\_** (10): 1989 taylor switched up to max level. can't fault it except for the overdone 'bonnie and clyde' lyric

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): RELEASE THIS AS A SINGLE FAT. Basically everyone in here loves this song!!!

**Mudkip1** (10): just beautiful. really reminds me of a pure heroine/melodrama hybrid

**natsby** (10): this will sound weird but I feel like this song is the structural heir to All Too Well. whilst definitely not as amazing, there's something slightly shifting to all the sections that helps really tell a story in an interesting, expansive way, reminiscent to ATW's ever-changing choruses.

**OriginalKappa** (10): makes me cry :(

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The only part of this album that's worthy of joining Taylor's all-time greats, with the possible exception of Delicate. It may essentially be a Bleachers ripoff, but the production is at its best here, especially near the end, with the violins and the passionate finale. Taylor plays the tragic villain here more convincingly than in Look What You Made Me Do or I Did Something Bad. Oh, and I love the Dickens reference. If this isn't the highest rated song on Reputation I will make Bad Blood #1 on my lastfm for the week.

**rickikardashian** (10): Old Taylor and Jack Antonoff joined together to bring this masterpiece. It has the visual songwriting that Taylor is so well known for, and you can just tell this is a JA song. It feels full emotion, and it kinda feels like Style, that it wasn't about Taylor trying to find the worst in the guy, if any, she's finding the worst in her, but it just tells you the story she went through, without really judging anyone.

**skargardin** (10): It competes with the best tracks on 1989, which to me is filled with pop perfection. It's so well produced and I'm a sucker for key changes as well.

**SpanKKy1** (10): this song made me get my license

**specfagular** (10): NO clap NOTHING clap GOOD clap STARTS clap IN clap A clap GETAWAY clap CAR

**SupremeShani** (10): It may be a reworked Bleachers song, but this is also Taylor at her best, the imagery and delivery in the verses are gorgeous and thoughtful, and I love the use of a getaway car as a metaphor for a rebound.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is literally a Bleachers Terrible Thrills Vol. 2 reject, but by god is this possibly the best Antonoff-produced Taylor song ever.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): orgasmic

**theburningundead** (10): that key change gives me chills every single time

**TheLastAxolotl** (10): The key change, the bridge, pop perfection

**therokinrolla** (10): a bop full of great hooks and great lyrics and is a great taste of 1989 taylor that we wont get back. very dramatic. needs a vid

**TheStarSquad** (10): Getaway Car was an immediate standout for me. Even now as I look back at the album, this song is on another level lyrically and emotionally. When Taylor and Calvin broke up I was definitely looking forward to some emotional breakup songs, which is truly what she does best. I wanted another All Too Well, but sadly it doesn't exist on the album. This song is the only one that even comes close (although it appears to be primarily about Tom Hiddleston). It seems weird considering that was her longest relationship at the time, but looking at some of the lyrics addressing him on this track and I Did Something Bad (possibly) it seems like she wasn't too torn up about it. "I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason." While I am still sad about the fact that there is no emotional breakup balled on reputation, this emotional breakup bop definitely does the job. I absolutely adore the extended metaphor of a getaway car that Taylor uses throughout the whole track and applies to her relationship with Tom. Everything about the track just works so perfectly, and it's actually very helpful in explaining the very short, odd relationship she had with Tom. She takes the blame for using him to escape Calvin, but once she leaves him for Joe, she scolds him for not knowing better. "Should've known I'd be the first to leave, think about the place where you first met me." To her, it was clear that they were never going to work out because "nothing good starts in a getaway car". It's explicitly clear that she never intended for them to last, but only needed a way to escape her relationship with Calvin. This song just works so well, and I also love how no songs on reputation are about Calvin - the best way to come out on top.

**vhqv1997** (10): It was so nice of Taylor to put a Bleachers cover in her album

deleted: **queensparade** (9.8): A great Bleachers song

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): overrated but i also still love it. the bridge is kinda bad tho, but that OUTRO! WIG!

**Albert\_Cole** (9.5): I don't like how Antonoff produces vocals. Other than that... yeah, best song on the album.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): It's like Style, able to capture you in the moment under the specific conditions of the time of day being night and you being alone. This one is more industrial; therefore, it's less emotional.

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (9.5): COME THROUGH SONGWRITING. Not the biggest fan of the bridge but otherwise perfect.

**jhxcb** (9.5): The only complaint I have about this song is the recording of her voice. I think she did it on a bad day. To me, it sounds like she has a cold. I think lyrically, this is the best song on the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.3): Break up song Taylor really is the best Taylor. Tom Hiddleston is truly shook (tbh I can't believe that relationship actually happened I'm still scarred from it).

**awryj** (9): my favorite song from gone now

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Fun fact I've been singing "X marks the spot where we fell apart" since the day this album came out. I don't usually see it getting mentioned as a fave but this is a bop and a half

**m4ttycool** (9): lovely

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This is the Taylor I like, an expert at creating a mood through great writing.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): We stan a Terrible Thrills Vol. 3 demo!

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The first good song on the album. You can definitely feel Jack Anronoff's influence, and it works well here.

**theNealCutter** (9): when I was just in a new relationship and Delicate was on repeat all day, I avoided this song so hard because I know I will have to leave him one day. Like I knew we will not last as long as I hoped we could. I knew we were never gonna work out, but I still went for it because I was desperate for attention, for affection, for love. I was broken when I met him, and he was there when I needed him, but I knew deep inside that a love built out of broken hearts doesn't work out. This song captured the time we broke up. We hurt each other on so many different ways, I ended up changing for the worse, and I had to leave before we get so hurt we forget why we were in love in the first place.

**bwc222** (8.5): i'm a sucker for songs that build in intensity

**camerinian** (8.5): This is really just a mid-tier Bleachers song, but really even the worst Bleachers song stands head and shoulders above the insufferable shite on this album.

**kromosol** (8.5): Jack Antanoff Car

**quaerex** (8.5): It's a Bleachers reject, but at least Taylor's showing off her songwriting chops here. "The ties were black/the lies were white/And shades of grey in candlelight" is one of the only nuanced lyrics on this album.

**zamomattel** (8.5): this is such a classic antanoff tune

**crowlily** (8.2): I love how she tells this story. brilliant songwriting. Bleachers vibe is awesome as well.

**dirdbub** (8): the instrumental should hit harder but it's still a bop

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (8): this song is like 1989 and doesn't have try-hard trap production from jack antonoff and max martin lol, so it's obviously the best on the album

**MashLuke** (8): I'm picturing her like Gwen Stefani on Sweet Escape

**MissyBee37** (8): This song gives me hope. IMHO, best song on the album. My only complaint is the key-change bridge, where it gets cheesy. But before that, it's easily my favorite melody and both her best lyrics & best vocal of the album. Love that it tells a story & paints that picture for you so well, which is exactly what I've always loved from Taylor.

**nooodisaster** (8): Okay but this LITERALLY is a Bleachers song, from the weird phrasings to the shotgun pre-chorus. Good lyrics tho.

**PenOrAPencil** (8): this track would fit right at home on 1989

**stardustanddinos** (8): I warmed up to this song only recently, but it's her story-like song writing at its best. The little things in the instrumental of this song (the outro, the key change) really improve it so much, and it's just a great song!

**topesmachine** (8): cute song!

**vayyiqra** (8): same as above

**callmetidle** (7.5): This is a bop but it feels kinda forgettable lyrically

**Raykel** (7.5): Ok I only love this for the "It hit you like a SHOTGUN SHOTTOTHEHEART!"

**sletrab07** (7.5): It's great, but that key change is so unearned.

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): Overrated by the sub, a nice song but nothing amazing

**dwarfgourami** (7): This feels like a Steel Train song but like… I don't mind

**fifthchevron** (7): I don't know if Tom deserved such a harsh kiss-off but the juicy details of the Hiddleswift epic was something I'd been anticipating for this album and I got it. It's like if the Wildest Dreams film came to life. I live for the wistfulness of "We were jet set, Bonnie and Clyde...". I feel like Hiddleswift will be the last great celebrity drama for a while yet. It captivated everyone - except Taylor, apparently. But she's still human and she still walked away from a romance, and that humanity comes in at the very end as she once again leaves another man in the dust makes all the harsh "you were a rebound" quips worth it.

**Glennishill** (7): So Taylor is still in there somewhere huh? The lyrics are good and the beat is strong and you could be mistaken for thinking this song was on 1989.

**joshually** (7): The chorus is great... but the verses are lackluster

**MrSwearword** (7): the key change/production change showed more promise than the singing, songwriting or the fact this getaway car drives like a Kia Amanti [overweight and underpowered]

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (6): An 80s synth banger, but the entire metaphor of falling in love in a getaway car falls apart the moment you think about it. Plus the verses have lame production. When will Jack Antanoff learn that smashing a big arena chorus onto quiet, forgettable verses does not a bop make.

**PuggleMaster** (6): this song feels like it's 6 minutes long

**thetimidmartian** (6): an interesting track at first but an absolute lack of vocal quality or lyrical depth leaves it bland by the third listen

**TragicKingdom1** (6): Don't know why she's copying Jack's vocal inflections, it really just emphasizes this is a very below average Bleachers song. There are worse things to be, however.

**whatareblackhole** (6): A Bleachers 9, a Taylor Swift 6. (You cannot tell me she doesn't sing "I knew it from the FIRST Old Fashioned, we were CURSED" exactly like Jack Antonoff would. It's unbearably similar.)

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (5.5): getaway filler. would be a low tier song on 1989 !

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Pretty boring

**dropthehammer11** (5): I'm sorry, but this song does nothing for me. It's not bad, it's just soooo average.

**twat\_brained** (5): This is just "Delicate" but wordier and more downtempo, but hey! There's a key change! Well I don't buy it.

**kappyko** (3.5): I literally just finished a Tale of Two Cities and we are not going to disrespect Miss Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay like this again no sweetie that opening line is fucking stupid and this song is trying to be something it isn't

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3.5): Some of the better vocals on the album, but I'm really not a fan of the production. It feels too loud and overblown.

**SkyBlade79** (2): SO OVERRATED. There's really nothing special about this song at all and idk why the stans chose this song to represent.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): this song is super annoying lol

**enecks** (0): OK so I really need to explain myself. Why, in an album that has Look What You Made Me Do, End Game, I Did Something Bad, and This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things, is this the track I hate the most? This is the acclaimed song it's OK to respect in this deeply hated album. Well, to put it bluntly, it's a song that would've been a mid-tier cut in 1989 if not for a few very forced lyrical and production motifs. The allusions to nostalgic icons - Bonnie and Clyde, Old Fashioned cocktails - don't match the tone of rebellion and love as a crime. It's too self consciously overproduced - every note, every key change, every lyric is exactly where you'd expect. I know I've struggled with pop perfection as a concept before but I have a definition - it's making a carefully constructed song in every element sound seamless. This song is an abomination of seams - not bad when listened into the background, but a song that is weak when examined on any level other than the surface. Unlike the aforementioned consensus lows of this album, there is no perverse joy in analysing its failings. Just a realisation that the ideas of "correct pop" are the poison chalice that have gotten pop to its all time low it is experiencing right now - homogenous nothing. Getaway Car sounds like a future hit. That's not a good thing.

I'm confused, Bonnie and Clyde were a couple and a pair of criminals. How does that not fit rebellion/love as a crime? Also I think she's heavily implying that she didn't break up with Calvin before taking off with Tom, she cheated even though the Calvin relationship was dead. That's the only reason I can think to use words like "crime", "turned you in" and "traitors". Old fashioneds might be Tom's fave drink for all we know, it might be her way of referencing him in a way only he knows, or would confirm to him that this song is about their time together.

=====

enecks: I meant that within the broader theme of the song being lifeless and vapid pastiche. Bonnie and Clyde is the most basic allusion you can make for this sort of stuff - it's so trite a metaphor it might as well not exist. 
[/r/popheads/comments/872jg2/the_2017_ultimate_album_rate_day_3_i_think_we_are/dwac73d/]

=====

deleted: I think in a song with the lyric "You weren't thinking/And I was just drinking" that's to be expected. It's clear she didn't care much for Tom so using a tired metaphor kinda works in that regard.

=====

enecks: "It's not lazy writing it's just intentionally a tired metaphor to show apathy". I don't think I buy that logic. If you wanted to show apathy and not caring, framing it as an adventurous crime spree of intense passion isn't that effective.

=====

deleted: But...she and Tom were exactly that lol. They met at a glamorous event, hooked up two weeks (or less) after her break up, flew around the world in 3 months, met each others parents after a couple weeks, held the insufferable 4th of July promo party with 500 other celebs, and generally performed for the cameras the entire time. 

They were an over the top rebound she was willing to play out if it meant escaping Calvin, but it didn't mean anything *more* to her than that.

**Some Funk Wav Bops + Katy's Highest Rated Song in the Rate**
--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): absolute bop

**Albert\_Cole** (10): I didn't care about Calvin Harris until 2016, and I didn't love him until I heard this song. It's mostly just Let's Groove by Earth, Wind and Fire - but that's okay because Let's Groove is a fantastic song

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): yes today, satan

**Brendon-Urine** (10): SUCH A BOP. Everybody on this track so great, from Katy on the chorus to Pharell and Big Sean. Pop perfection IMO.

**cyborglilith** (10): The music video's aesthetics are on point.

**dirdbub** (10): the instrumental could be used for a children's show opening and I honestly wouldn't even fucking notice

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Funk Wav was such a great album for me and this was my favorite song! Keep on poppin' them fish Katy!

**enecks** (10): Joyously cheesy pop

**Glennishill** (10): This song is fucking banger. I listened to this song nonstop last summer and I love how perfectly Katy is used here. I love her attitude in this song and I think the whole thing is a beautiful fun package. This would be my 11 but Tsunami is too good.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This was the song of the summer for me. Super catchy and fun and it saved this Era of Katy's slightly. Production is great and Calvin really should do more funk influence music.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): It's basic but in a good way

**MissyBee37** (10): Funky, groovy, sexy summer jam. I wouldn't expect four artists to work but they ALL are great & gel well. Katy's vocals are understated & smooooth.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Feels>Slide. Don't @ me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is obviously the best song in the bonus rate. It's not even a contest.

**quaerex** (10): This is a highkey bop, Calvin Harris has mad talentz and this song is such a feel-good summer vibe that you can't give it anything other than a 10.

**skargardin** (10): Major bop! It's just perfect in all aspects, shame that Calvin is abandoning his Funk Waw sound.

**specfagular** (10): I KNOW YOU AIN'T AFRAID TO BOP PILLS (sorry i know its terrible but its 1 AM and i have work in the morning just let me have this)

**sletrab07** (9.5): A wild bop appeared! It used #feels! Critical hit! It's super effective! sletrab07 fainted!

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This song is the definition of summer vibes.

**awryj** (9): It's so badly written and cheesy and yet so great. I'd change up Katy with Carly and release it as a bonus track for CRJ4

**fourchip** (9): super catchy and groovy trop-pop reggae fusion messy bop

**jonnl2806** (9): Funky Fresh

**melodyllic\_** (9): that awkward moment when a random calvin harris collab is better than any of katy's witness singles

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): slide can choke don't @ me

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): A funky bop. This track takes a group of artists in their own lanes, and fits them together so well. Honestly, the highlight for me is Big Sean, who sounds so good on this beat.

**vhqv1997** (9): I still keep hearing it as "fish"

**wailordfan\_** (8.5): Big Sean high-key killed his verse here and is the best part of the song.

**leviswift13** (8.1): It's cute, but Funk Harris doesn't do it for me like it does for everyone else.

**camirose** (8): The direction I wish she had taken on her OWN album.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A song that I also did not like on first listen and said the only good part of it was Big Sean :deadbanana:

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Slick production from Mr. Harris himself.

**JackLebowski** (8): I can't believe I liked the bonus tracks more than most fo the album lol

**natsby** (8): Katy sounds surprisingly good in this kind of style

**Piccprincess** (8): I wish there were more shots of my anti-vaxx daddy in this music video

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This song is actually really nice but Big Sean what are you doing honey

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Really great production and a bop but not really exceptional in any area. It's missing some star power to really elevate it imo.

**vayyiqra** (8): weird but a bop

**crowlily** (7.8): I love the production. it's such a feel-good song, and her singing becomes more bearable here

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): Damn you Calvin Harris for continuously releasing bops

**followingfreeways** (7.5): oohhh I've heard this song before. it's p catchy but also cringy

**hikkaru** (7.5): don't be afraid to catch fish

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): it's... bouncy (don't be afraid to catch fish tho)

**deadspiderwall** (7.4): OOH I GOT SOME BIG ENEMIES

**MrSwearword** (7): the pills lyric and first music video are fucking stupid but at least there's Calvin's pretty good production to act as the Hazelnut creamer/ketchup this song needs.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): odd but big sean makes the song

**tevinterimperium** (7): Thank you to Calvin for getting Katy another hit this era

**TheLastAxolotl** (7): Decent

**Ugh**
---

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): WHY was this the biggest of the singles from this album, why not Slide, why not Heatstroke, it's okay though

**whatareblackhole** (6): This song is okay. I don't like how Katy sounds. And I think it has the similar problem to Tove Lo's "struggle" where its main line is a current phrase that's kind of stupid. But it's cute!

**camerinian** (5.5): I want to give this credit for that fun, almost Ace Of Base-esque groove, but the near total lack of chemistry between the three performers here is jaw-dropping

**jhxcb** (5.1): This song is kind of gross. It sounds like a 15 year old too much optimism song from some one hit wonder that uses a very liberal definition of "hit".

**1313Harbor** (5): I hate the popularization of the phrase "catching feels". They're called feelings.

**CarlieScion** (4): I sorta hate this song bc it keeps coming on repeat at my work radio, and the intro always makes me think it's another song.

**dwarfgourami** (4): Heatstroke deserved better than this pile of mediocrity

**itsboogiepanda** (3): Hate the production

**thetimidmartian** (3): the production isnt annoying enough, so pharrell is here

**topesmachine** (2): i don't like this at all

This is the song. 

This was (to be honest) the only Kesha song that fought for my 11. Praying and Learn To Let Go were nice, and generally good songs, but none of them really hit me the way Rainbow did. It is anthemic, but all on its own it is breathy, soft, and almost out of the way. 

That is what the era is best represented as though. It isn't supposed to be loud and brash, it is peace. Peace *can* be loud, it can be brash, we see it in Boogie Feet, and Woman, but ultimately at the end of the day, you can relax in peace, and find your rainbow. 

--- 


**Albert\_Cole** (11): One writer. One producer. Pure, unadulterated magic. There is only one thing I dislike about this - the fact that she didn't perform it at her London concert.

**joshually** (11): This is IT. I know everyone cites Spaceship as THE song on the album, but for me it's this title track, with its weirdo vibes and that didgeridoo buzzing all over the place and the melancholy/hopeful tone. L O V E I T

**rickikardashian** (11): Praying has been the most praised song out of this album, and rightfully so, but I can't help to feel like a lot of people slept on Rainbow. I was able to relate to this song a whole lot more than praying, because most my problems don't involve other people harming me, but instead not being able with being at peace with myself, and this is what this song is all about, she is learning to love herself and life back, and trying to think positively even when going through hell, and knowing how much she went through, this song hit me just as hard as praying.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): a punch to the heart

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): AHsfHDAFHDAF the titular track on Kesha's comeback proves to be just as beautiful as the concept itself. it is only heightened by its video, look what you made me do is shook

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): the fuck should i say lol this song is just perfect, talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference OR not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it long story short this song is the definition of empowering and uplifting. that second verse hits hard and close home. it also tears me up just like Praying, but in a nicer, happier way.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): The instrumentation is gorgeous. Of course Kesha's voice is gorgeous too.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): The songwriting is really sweet, definitely encapsulates the album.

**CarlieScion** (10): This song is a slow jam. The chorus is so good

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The most emotional song on the album. I can relate to this song so much and it's helped me through some tough times in my life. It'll always be the one song I'll go back to from Kesha.

**enecks** (10): A bombastic song that sounds straight out of a musical - not that it sounds bad. The production and lyrics are big - not in the monumental gravity of Praying, but in a "Defying Gravity" way. Also "our scars make us who we are" is a very good lyric.

**fourchip** (10): this song really does have it all, gays, sadness, slightly overused metaphors, kesha breaking down. an 11 contender

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When you get into the right mood for this song, it hits you like an atom bomb

**milkywayinradius** (10): very grand and uplifting song with that orchestra sound backing her up

**Mudkip1** (10): another pretty song i love her voice here

**nooodisaster** (10): first piano key hits / me: bursts into tears. The end to part 1 of the album, and what an ending it is. Ppl will stan better than I can, but basically this song takes all the good things about the album so far and morphs it into a climactic finale.

**skargardin** (10): The title-track is raw and emotional but also manages to instil that glimmer of hope that everything will get better after difficult times. It's by far one of my favourite Kesha ballads.

**SpanKKy1** (10): put your hands up gays, kesha needs all your energy

**SupremeShani** (10): This is one of the best title tracks I've ever heard, even if some may find it a bit too saccharine, you can tell Kesha truly went through a journey. If this song doesn't make it to the last day, then Popheads truly hates hope and happiness.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of making disney music bops

**theNealCutter** (10): I'm at a loss of words. I don't know. It's very beautiful. Somehow, I think this will fit well on a Disney movie.

**therokinrolla** (10): I will just leave lyrics here in place of a review: "I've found a rainbow, rainbow, baby Trust me, I know, life is scary" "And deep down, I'm still a child Playful eyes, wide and wild I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold" "And I know that I'm still fucked up But aren't we all, my love? Darling, our scars make us who we are, are" "Oh, put those colors on, girl Come and paint the world with me tonight" Nah fuck it I'll leave a review too. Kesha is a damn lyricist with punchy as fuck lyrics. The god-sent instrumentals surrounding the song are beautiful, perfectly done, and push the song from amazing to perfect. YEs, this is a perfect song, and so few of those exist. This reminds me of Get Free by Lana, in that its an anthem to moving forward. And this does it even better (remember I'm a hardcore Lana stan). Its beautiful. Its a rainbow.

**thetimidmartian** (10): the songwriting is consistently good, she has some of the best lines of her career here. her falsetto is painfully underdeveloped, this is audible on the bridge, but this hurts the song none.

**VeganSquash** (10): if only I felt confident putting on the colors...

**vhqv1997** (10): Why isn't this the official LGBT anthem yet?

**whatareblackhole** (10): This song is PURE magic and I love her voice with this sound.

**zamomattel** (10): kesha threw the first brick at stonewall with this one

**jhxcb** (9.8): This song is absolutely amazing. The only thing I'm knocking off for is because this masterpiece deserves more. I want to hear this song with a Andrea Bocelli-type treatment and a full, gigantic orchestra behind it.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): jungshook

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Love the orchestra!

**topesmachine** (9.5): YA MAYBE MY HEADS FUCKED UP

**leviswift13** (9.3): The lyrics here are beautifully evocative and powerful.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Kesha is adorable.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Frozen sequel suddenly found in development hell and unable to get financing to enter production!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Giving this the same score I did in the Charity Rate. I actually never really appreciated this until that event, actually. Now that I've been converted, I see it as a gorgeous, if simple bridge between the first half of the album and the sillier, more optimistic second half.

**specfagular** (9): The title track does NOT disappoint.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): This just makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. The bridge is ethereal.

**vayyiqra** (9): beautiful

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): You can just hear the raw emotion in Keshas voice as she softly croons over the track, also a super big fan of the different orchestral elements gradually coming in to make a final masterpiece.

**PenOrAPencil** (8.5): yes Kesha, you deserve to fall back in love with being alive after everything you've went through

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): An elton John- sounding ballad, nothing special

**melodyllic\_** (8): disney film score who??

**sletrab07** (8): The lush orchestration is lovely here.

**stardustanddinos** (8): The song encapsulates the entire theme of the album, about growth, letting go, self-love and more importantly about optimism. The instrumentals are absolutely lovely, and Kesha sounds amazing.

**TheLastAxolotl** (8): Another good song placement

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Really well-done ballad. I love the "put these colors on, girl" line.

**VodkaInsipido** (8): the strings are gorgeous

**crowlily** (7.6): Sounds very pretty and nice. Gets louder and stronger. I like the oooohing a lot! I really like this but feel that I can't give it higher :(

**awryj** (7.5): This is literally a Disney song

**callmetidle** (7.5): I used to think it was generic for a title track, and it kinda is, but man, it's just so cute and wholesome

deleted: **twat\_brained** (7.3): I like how airy and light this one is but I felt myself starting to doze off while listening to it.

**camerinian** (7): I honestly don't have a lot of tolerance to these sort of inspirational tracks, but the choral swell on this really is something to behold

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): It's alright

**itsboogiepanda** (7): Really really really don't like the ahhhhhs

**quaerex** (7): This entire album is a beautiful ode to forgiveness and getting past wounds you never thought would heal; the title track is no exception.

**SkyBlade79** (7): good use of imagery I guess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I know this is everyone's favorite ballad, but it's quite milquetoast and boring for me. The chorus sometimes reaches these highs, but honestly, Kesha doesn't do anything to improve the wonderful instrumental, and I think that might be a sentiment that stands true for most of the album, (except for maybe her somewhat-improvisational singing before the last chorus). I just don't see the hype here, and while there's moments of ethereality, it never truly stays there.

**deadspiderwall** (6.9): kick-ass bridge

**The Negative-Nelly's**
---

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): Beautiful song, but I find it a bit lacking in the sonic department.

**kappyko** (6.5): A little underwhelming, I kind of dig the fairy tale vibe but it takes a lot longer to get there than it should

**Glennishill** (6): I want to like this song but it's kind of boring.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): dramatic

**Piccprincess** (4.5): if Kesha can write an album about her past then why can't Taylor Swift

**dirdbub** (4): I feel absolutely nothing for this song

**gannade** (4): Bland

**MrSwearword** (1): Kelis did black and white turned to color way better on "Acapella" and having thought she didn't need love until meeting someone better on "4th of July (Fireworks)"

deleted: **Musical Perfection**
---

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): why is this not a single yet; take 3. it literally has half the streams of End Game and it's not even a standalone single... the vocoder goes extremely well with Taylor's and the album's overall aesthetic. also something about this song just feels so intimate, like its your special song with someone... this whole album makes me feel things

**strawberryswing1** (11): This song grew on me so much. It went from a good song with a fun "isn't it (x infinity)" line to something incredible. In Delicate, Taylor masterfully describes what it's like to long after your crush. "Is it cool that I said all that?" describes the uncertainty you have when you're starting a new relationship and you are so scared to do something wrong and mess it all up. "'Cause I liiiiiike you" in the background pushes this song to a whole new level.

**camirose** (10): It was a struggle between this and RFI for my 11

**CarlieScion** (10): A straight banger

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (10): Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it the best song on the album? It is the one time that Taylor seems at all vulnerable, self aware, or emotional (besides vapid smugness)

**dwarfgourami** (10): By far my favorite song from the album

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Easily the highlight of the album. Love airy and chill feel of the song, and Taylor really pulls off the vocoder affected vocals.

**itsboogiepanda** (10): Isn't it Delicate Any less than a 10 is a hate crime, but it's not a 11 because it's not King of My Heart. So raunchy for Taylor (yes more than Dress you nerds) but so distinctly Taylor. In 5 years we'll probably look back at Taylor's greatest works and this will definitely be up there.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Start subtle and sweet and keep its subtlety til the end. I love it!


**melodyllic\_** (10): the first fourfiveseconds (blahblarihannablah) of this song >>> a few other songs on the album

**milkywayinradius** (10): Best song on the album, lyrics and the soft singing and production work really well together

**Mudkip1** (10): reputation's so hilarious to me because this one's so fucking good. delicate should be how the album opens! cut all four of the trash tracks ahead of it (or at least put some of them afterward). maybe she wanted her fans to dig through all the shit in order to find the diamond in the rough?



**poppinmmolly** (10): I go through phases of thinking this song's okay and thinking that it's genius. At the time of rating this, this song is genius.

**quaerex** (10): Finally, the only truly good song on this entire album. Delicate actually feels relatable, and as such it embodies the appeal of vintage Taylor. I could do without the vocoder in the beginning, but the soft verses and delicate (haha) chorus makes up for any small flaw that has.

**rickikardashian** (10): This is not only one of the best songs on the album, is one of the best Taylor songs, isn't it? isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it delicate

**skargardin** (10): Isn't it delicate? This emotional and vulnerable ballad is among, if not the best song on reputation.

**SpanKKy1** (10): this song is so pretty

**SupremeShani** (10): I was tempted to just copy and paste "Isn't It?", but I'm sure someone else has that covered. Taylor's delivery and lyrics here represent everything I love about her, vulnerable and direct, but at the same time managing to beautifully capture her emotions.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I didn't like the weird vocal effects in the beginning when I first heard this track, but this song has seriously grown on me. "Isn't it" is practically popheads royalty at this point, and the lyrics are undeniably infectious. "Dive bar on the east side, where you at?" she bemoans, and for a moment, you really get a feel for what it feels like to be rich, young, and in love in modern New York City. This isn't the Taylor on the opening track of 1989, this is more like a real depiction of the New York Elite, a blistering love track that takes Lyfts instead of Ubers, brunches every weekend, and spends more time at Lululemon than the gym.


**TheLastAxolotl** (10): Vocoder heaven

**therokinrolla** (10): one of those brilliant songs that is just a song made of one hook after another, each part could be the chorus, and the gentle production is a nice turn at this point.

**TheStarSquad** (10): Yet another song that blew me away at first listen. The verses go SO WELL with that beat!! I still scream out those lyrics every time I play this bop. Delicate did not shake me quite as much as the two tracks before it, but it has grown on me so much, and I can definitely see it growing on me even more. The repetition of "Isn't It?" after the chorus just makes me want to move!! It is just such a chill bop. I especially love the flow of the verses and the "My reputation's never been worse" line. The self-awareness had me blown back when I first heard it. To be honest i'm not sure if this would be a great single because the chorus slows down a lot compared to the beat and flow of the verses, but I would love a music video, and the verses and post-choruses are just so catchy.




**whatareblackhole** (10): OOF, sorry, Delicate, but as long as you're in the same rate as Spaceship, you're not getting my 11. But this song KILLED ME and totally redeemed Reputation.

**cyborglilith** (9.8): "Sometimes when I look into your eyes, I pretend you're mine all the damn time" doesn't make sense. I guess if they were separate statements, it would be appropriate, but it's still a little jarring.

**camerinian** (9.5): I'm gonna be honest, I didn't actually listen to Reputation until this rate, I had just kind of written it off as an abject failure and hoped that nobody would seriously challenge that. I was going so well with that assumption right up until this song, which honestly is so, so much better than it has any right to be. It's maybe a bit percussion heavy, but honestly Taylor leaning in to her insecurities and anxieties actually really channels her current persona well. I just hate that I can't hate-fuck this album in the ratings like I hoped I could have.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.5): This song feels a bit trop pop-y without sounding too trendy. Wig is gone.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9.5): Yeahhhh it's kind of trop pop but overall sis went off, made it her own personal song and it sounds interesting and still fun.

**jonnl2806** (9.5): Easily one of the best on the album. Isn't it?

**stardustanddinos** (9.5): Damn, what a delight. She's so vulnerable and loving in this song, a side of her that she makes resonate through the song's mellow beat and soft lyrics. Y'all better make it go top 10 on this rate.

**joshually** (9): The chorus doesn't really make sense... is she breaking up with him, or telling him to leave, or is she saying that it's best they stay together? I's confused y'all... someone answer me pls

**MashLuke** (9): I've never realized how clumsy she sounds in this, it's pretty sweet

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): never really understood why people happen to like this so much until I caugh myself saying "isn't it?, isn't it?" repeatedly. Guess this song is a grower and not a shower.

**nooodisaster** (9): Yes it's beautiful, amazing, great, BUT! I thought she said "This IS for the best" not "This AIN'T for the best", and honestly when I found out the real lyrics I was like.... really tho? "This is for the best/My reputation's never been worse so/You must like me for me" is such a beautiful, tragic acceptance of finding the silver lining in a shit show. The actual lyric just doesn't make sense, like, it's a bad thing that he must like her for her?? And that's why this is getting a 9 and not a 10 lmao.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Definitely one of the weirdest songs Taylor's put out. From the robotic voice to the focus on the song's rhythm, this surpasses all the other songs in terms of being unique. I didn't like it much, at first, and I still don't listen to it regularly, but I'mm finally beginning to get why everybody likes it so much. I'll give this an extra point for u/ComeOnAndSlang.

**specfagular** (9): What a great song to describe the start of a good relationship and all the excited nervousness that comes with it

**vayyiqra** (9): solid bop

**zamomattel** (9): adore this v warm and sweet

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8.7): this song is adorable <3 i don't think it's as incredible as some of you make it out to be, and def not the best on the album, but it's still nice to listen to


**crowlily** (8.4): I LOVE THIS SOUND

**jhxcb** (8.2): I like the subject matter and I think it has some killer lyrics, but I think the vocal effects aren't working. It's a bit much, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

**Albert\_Cole** (8.1): Next single hype (yes I'm sending in my rate results late). Also, obligatory "Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?"


**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Sweet and soft and pretty

**natsby** (8): it just keeps growing on me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): The vocal effects made this song tbh.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): She's really cute

**gannade** (7.5): very pretty and intimate, but small details like the vocoder and the lazy "isnt it isnt it isnt it" post chorus bring down an otherwise stellar song



**MissyBee37** (7): A highlight. I like the beat & her flow; music is pretty. The lyrics aren't bad, which is one of my biggest frustrations with the album. But this is a solid song.

**SkyBlade79** (7): its nice and chill but not as special as people make it

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): pretty forgetable

**dropthehammer11** (6): The production on this thing is silky smooth, but I feel like it was missing some life.

**MrSwearword** (6): I'm not mad at the Imogen Heap/"Hide and Seek" realness; at least it improves Taylor's vocals greatly.

**topesmachine** (6): this sounds like if Major Lazer tried making a ballad... no thanx, also i know that taylor isn't like the best lyricist, but rlly

**robbiec\_** (5.5): I don't understand why everyone loves this song so much like?? it's okay and it just jumps on the trop pop thing which is done (although she did it better than most)

**awryj** (5): this bridge is creepy

**enecks** (5): After listening to Reputation for the first time I predicted the tracks this sub would lose its shit over to be Dancing With Our Hands Tied and New Year's Day. Instead it was this and Getaway Car? Really? This is a fucking Spotify commercial.

**fifthchevron** (5): I have this hatred of audible mouth noises so from "dark jeans" til the first chorus I can't listen to it, she makes a noise at the end of each line. Overall the song leaves me wanting more and not getting it.

**Glennishill** (5): The vocal effect is lame and I think the lyrics are so simple, especially by Taylor's standards. I don't have much to say for this song, it's just kinda there.


**CreepyMannequin** (4): The line "My reputation's never been worse, so you must like me for me" is pretty good; too bad the rest of the song is pretty boring.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): One of the more tolerable songs. I'm a sucker for vocoder.

**thetimidmartian** (4): who thought it was a good idea to use that vocal processing??

**TragicKingdom1** (4): Really weak chorus but nothing else is offensive to me.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): still asleep

**VeganSquash** (3): people overrate this song tbh, I think its boring

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (2): i know taylor fans are clamoring for this as the next single but i really really do not like this, especially the beginning

**Overall average**: 7.080

--- 

**[ALL AVERAGES](https://pastebin.com/2PXeNnwS)**

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is not the worst album I have ever heard but I do think it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of pop music. Taylor clearly thought she could waltz in and make a thought-provoking statement about her relationship with the media and her own persona. However, anyone who cares about any of this has already seen everything before come to their own conclusions on this matter. What made Lemonade so great was the mystery and speculation surrounding it, but there is no debate here, so Taylor just comes off as smugly trying to shift a narrative a year too late. None of this would matter, of course, if the actual music backed it up, but somewhere in the creative process my personal backbones of good pop music (momentum and production) were lost on the majority of the songs. For momentum, a song it needs to maintain a general energy to compel me to keep listening; you need to add more fuel in order to keep the engine running. The worst thing you can do is actively hit the brakes, which happens way too often here, especially on So It Goes and Dancing With Our Hands Tied. And then for production, Max Martin pulls out his absolute worst to date, pulling primarily from dated, circa-2012 dubstep. Overall I only really like 1 song on Reputation, but there are components of good songs buried in the mix of terrible decisions. [Grade: D]

**enecks**: This album is a mess, but in a fascinating way. It is a power struggle between a followup to 1989 full of luscious synthpop and a big shocking "fuck the media" critique with darker sounds. It's more inconsistent than outright bad - for every shockingly awful track there's a hidden gem. But my god, this album's lows are some of the worst pop songs of the decade. And a lot of them were chosen as singles. It's noise and fury, signifying nothing.

**dirdbub**: oh god, is this rate really going to make me rate Taylor's album the best

**kappyko**: It's stylized lowercase because it shows how little of an artistic statement this album actually is. She loses a bit of herself under this unmelodic, un-fun, villainess sheen. Every good song on this feels like a stumbled upon mistake. Also, as an aside, please stop making your bias against reputation obvious and bias for rainbow obvious as well :( it's kind of alienating to a lot of ppl honestly

**stardustanddinos**: I think this is one of Taylor’s weakest works, and it has already begun to feel dated – both in its production and lyrical content. However, Taylor’s introduction to the album in her booklet makes me vibe with this album. We think we are what we choose to show the world, but only we know that we are mosaics of our best and worst selves. Reputation is exactly that – it’s a product of her life at the time. And that’s what we should consider this album as, a view into her life, fame and love – however tentative the attempt might feel. I still feel mixed towards this album, but it does have high highs, and I hope the people rating it consider these aspects when they do the rate.

**Mudkip1**: this album's basically just the thinking emoji in music form

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: I'll admit that I didn't have much faith in Reputation pretty much from the beginning, having a pretty strong distaste for Taylor's music. But I honestly think that of the three Taylor albums I've actually listened to, Reputation feels the most confused and unfocused. In terms of lyrics and production, I'd put it below both Red and 1989 handily. While the simple guitar pop of Red (besides the awfully dated I Knew You Were Trouble) and vaguely throwback synths of 1989 have an element of timelessness to them, the production on Reputation ranges from Max Martin's bizarre 2011 Will.i.am-esque synth beats to weak attempts at a trap sound to loud and overbearing Jack Antonoff production that is the exact opposite of a soundscape. When Taylor sings, there's nothing wrong with her vocals, but when she attempts to rap I just turn the song off. The themes are just as confused, and it feels like three different directions all colliding, with Taylor being mad at her enemies, proud of being the villain, and also falling in love simultaneously, and there's rarely any kind of cohesion to these narratives. The attempts at spinning the Kanye/Kim situation back in her direction just come off as tired and desperate considering she was the only one talking about it by this point. It just confuses me that the most popular, marketed, and image-controlling pop star in the world could put out an album this un-self-aware and confused.

**TheStarSquad**: I was completely blown away by how much I enjoyed this album. Based on the singles I didn’t think I would love it, but it absolutely shook me. It was so cohesive, every song fit on the album but at the same time was able to set itself apart from the group. Taylor’s new sound works so well, and the cultural comeback was insane to witness. As much as I love sad breakup Taylor it’s nice to see her finally singing about a healthy relationship for once. The way she addressed everything that happened to her the past few years through music was also so incredible. My Favourite album of the year for sure and one of my all time favourites.

**agentofscranton**: goddammit taylor

**patronsaintofaspies**: This is the album I'm most ambivalent towards. Well, that's not the correct word. I'm a pretty keen fan of Taylor, even if I don't think I could ever call myself a Swiftie. I believe she's quite talented in both word and music. Well, obviously, she's not that up to shape to the former this time around, but what about the latter? Is this album a healthy way for her to explore the diversity of things she can do as an artist, or is it just a waste of potential? I have strongly mixed feelings about this. Maybe it's a tiny bit of both. I wouldn't call this an unambiguously bad album. It's mediocre to an extent, though it has extremely bright spots. This is the first time I've had such a strange mix of excitement and disappointment towards a work of art. I want Taylor's next album to continue with the creativity, but not at the expense of her skill. 6.8/10.

**whatareblackhole**: I can say I hate Taylor Swift as much as I want to, but it would be more accurate to say I love to hate her. I love her status as a popstar and what she brings to pop culture as being such an innocent witch. I would say this album, like the other two, struggles with loneliness as its main theme. It's interesting to hear Taylor write songs that aren't about breaking up or about being in love, but about being alone. Delicate hurt the first time I heard it because it has to suck to have to approach relationships with that level of detail (My reputation's never been worse so/You must like me for me). I loved the blossoming of the relationship that we got to witness as the album progressed because it allowed our lonely heroine to finally be saved. I like this album more than I expected to, but I still want her to go all the way and create the album she wants to create. I feel like she's still trying to cater to large audiences (queen of capitalism) and could really benefit from some additional editing. However, you can hate it all you want, but reputation is undoubtedly boputation!

deleted: **strawberryswing1**: Repuatation, AKA: I am finally having good sex, I have never done anything wrong, and vocaders are really cool you guys, by Taylor Swift

**SendMeYourSATScores**: i'm pretty sure my average is low enough that i have to make an album comment so this album just doesn't meet expectations. we all know taylor can do better and reputation was lazy

**cyborglilith**: My first purchased album. I couldn’t wait the Two Weeks for it to go on spotify. The end result was that I became attached to it and it’s in my top 10 faves. Each song, to me, has a clear indication of which time you’re supposed to hear it: night, morning, or afternoon.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: reputation was a really controversial album last year, so I feel kind of guilty about loving the shit out of it(my 3rd favorite album of last year). I listened to every song on repeat, and I love even the worst of it(IM SORRY THE OLD ME CANT COME TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW), and im still constantly listening to it despite it being my 3rd most listened album last year. Im guilty to admit that i listened to some of the album more than certain Melodrama songs...

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: I feel like this album could have been A LOT bigger if the singles that preceded the album were different. II was expecting Taylor to go full-on edgy, while she did deliver that, the remaining songs on the record also happens to be her love for Joe which also happens to be the weakest tracks, but since then, I’ve understood how the first part of the album alludes to how the media portrayed her, and the latter part, well, is a mature her.

**1313Harbor**: As a long-time Taylor Swift fan, this album was a roller coaster for me. I was not impressed by the singles, then I was fully on board when I got my hands on the album and heard bops like Delicate and Dancing With Our Hands Tied for the first time. But now, 3.5 months after its release, I find myself rarely going back to Reputation. Most of the songs sounded pleasant and groovy on my first few listens, but so many of them have virtually no lasting power for me (End Game, So It Goes…, This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things, Gorgeous). When looking at this rate as a whole, so many of the songs from Rainbow are timeless and often universally relatable. On the flip side, I feel that Taylor moves through the tracks of Reputation without making any statements that may be considered too strong or powerful (other than her favorite statement that she always has been and always will be misunderstood by the mainstream public and entertainment media). She stays at the surface, making shiny songs with clean production that fail to leave an impact on most people other than her most loyal fans. Maybe I have just gotten too old and cynical to appreciate or connect with surface level pop music (at least when that’s the only thing on the album).

**nooodisaster**: I wish Taylor followed a tracklist more like Rainbow's. Put the Kanye-drama tracks at the forefront, then move on about halfway to explore herself. Like I know Taylor is the queen of petty, but she's REALLY petty on this album.

**Elitefourbrad**: I think this is a decline from 1989 for sure, the theme is sort of a mess. But I like the heartfelt songs for sure. 7.3/10

**MissyBee37**: Oh, Taylor. I wanted to love this record, but the truth is, I don't. It breaks my heart how much I hate it. “Red” is among my favorite albums of all time, "Speak Now" is stellar, "1989" is great. I enjoy the first two! But this era, unfortunately, is most memorable for me when it’s bad. Much of the rest of it is forgettable. I can't think of any other album that stand out to me for its weaknesses more so than its strengths; usually, if I'm bored by filler, I'll still remember it for the songs I loved. This time, it's a stretch to even find anything I love. The closest this album gets to a direction I would've liked to see Taylor take is "Getaway Car." Which is an 8! But Taylor used to rack up 10s in my heart. So, suffice to say I’ll pass on giving a damn about Taylor’s “reputation.”

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: While I don't have the same level of emotional attachment for Reputation as I had with her other albums like Red and 1989, this is an important album that Taylor needed to make in order to evolve as an artist. I didn't think of that until I saw this tweet. and it pretty much summarized how I feel about the album. For all the anxieties, worries and doubts I had for this album when it was still rolling out, I am going to apperciate this era as much as I can because this might be the last time I am going to see Taylor in her peak, both commercial and hype wise and I am afraid signs are showing that Taylor isn't going to sell a lot of singles as she was able to few years ago, if End Game flopping is a good indication. However, I have a feeling TS7 is going to be special, I can just feel it.

**Piccprincess**: I miss Taylor

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: if you were going to make an album with trap production maybe work outside of your bubble of jack antonoff and max martin

**SpanKKy1**: her magnum opus

**Albert\_Cole**: I actually wrote a full review of this (analysing the lyrics and production, and naming the top and bottom 5 lyrics of each track) for my old high school class, as a gag. It got two likes and one sad react. I still read it to myself from time to time and laugh at my own jokes. Hahaha kill me

**DraculaWeekend**: I hate this rate for making me listen to this album again.

**SkyBlade79**: A total disappointment. I had such high hopes for this album, that it would be the dark electropop album that would make me a taylor swift stan… but nope, it’s just 1989 v:1.666 Average: 5.833

**twat\_brained**: precedes me, but it doesn't precede Taylor as much as she thinks. Not even close.

**ComeOnAndSLANG**: why did you do this to me taylor

**camirose**: Sleeping Beauty finally wakes up, except now she’s equip with a baseball bat and an expensive bottle of whiskey

1998tweety: **1998tweety**: In terms of each tracks position, this album is set up perfectly. Sure there is a few filler songs, but their placements are perfect. In terms of listening to an entire album at once, this is my favourite of Taylor's. Personally I loved the album, I liked seeing Taylor bring forth and express different emotions and feelings that she hadn't in the past (with the exception of Bad Blood and Better Than Revenge). Ultimately this album is a product of its time, its hard to know just how good it is right now but I enjoyed listening to it.

This is one of my favorite songs off of Rainbow, second only to the title track. The melody really stands out here, and this really proved to be a fan favorite, and showing an extremely uncontroversial score. The song got exactly what it deserved, and it seems like most everyone would agree. 

The write-up for this is harder to do when almost all of these comments are generally positive...

--- 

**https://giphy.com/gifs/kesha-hi7zeXGYgr2uc** 

**1313Harbor** (11): Simply the best song off Rainbow. Praying is personal and raw, but Learn to Let Go is universal.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): if Praying wasn't in the rate as the automatic 11, this would get my 11. Besides being my #5 favorite song of last year, and one of my favorite songs of all time, it really came in a very specific time when I really needed this song. It helped me move on from some bad stuff, and really, just leave all that shit behind. It might sound corny, but if it wasn't for this song, I'd be in a very different place right now. I might even have to thank Kesha for bringing my self-esteem out of retirement. I don't think this song will get to the top 5, but even if it doesn't, in my heart, it will always be there. It's just a perfect song with the perfect message.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): 2018 mood and anthem

**camerinian** (10): As great as Praying is, I kind of wish this was Kesha's first single. It sums up a serious emotional aspect of her past few years, but it is such a better indicator of her future direction whilst still being at least somewhat rooted in the music of her past that it would have been a great stepping stone. Meh well, great track anyways

**dirdbub** (10): honestly if Kesha just decides to make an album of songs like this one I'd cop the SHIT outta it

**dropthehammer11** (10): This country pop tune sounds fucking amazing. Make it a single pl0x

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I personally love the message on this song, because it is hard to let go of some things, or some people. Kesha knows this better than anyone, and the emotional raspy quality of her voice shines during this amazing track.

**enecks** (10): This track means a lot to me in ways that I'm not going to open up about on a pop forum.

**fourchip** (10): upbeat bop

**gannade** (10): a motivational anthem. "the past cant haunt me if i don't let it" preach!!! 🙏🙏🙏

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Basically a more upbeat version of Praying, which means it'll probably last longer than it.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): Where Praying was the more emotionally heavy side to Kesha coming to terms with what has happened to her, Learn to Let Go is way more upbeat and it's so easy to imagine her just literally dancing her haters away. I love it!

**jonnl2806** (10): The perfect song after the heaviness of Praying. An anthem in its own right and also a bop. Kesha can do no wrong.

**kappyko** (10): Can you believe I actually used to hate this what the fuck

**m4ttycool** (10): I needed this track

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Queen of Healing and Moving on.

**rickikardashian** (10): This had the quality to become an international hit, and it didn't. This is why we as a human specie get all the bad stuff of life

**skargardin** (10): I could just copy my comment from Hymn cause this is the essence of Rainbow that I love so much, pure happiness.

**specfagular** (10): I remember a bunch of people feeling very eh about this song on release but I love it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Easily the best track on the album. The chorus here is absolutely bombastic, and it feels most like the actualized idea of this rock/country pop album, and you can hear hints of both seamlessly integrated into this track. It's catchy, and memorable, and it feels the most like a finished and dynamic track. It's laid back, introspective, and free without being forcibly so, and for that, it's one of the best tracks she's ever made.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): bop

**theNealCutter** (10): I think this song perfectly balances Praying's emotional punch and Let 'Em Talk's contagious energy. It's pretty straightforward, but who cares? It gets the message done, and the final chorus is just amazing.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): A non-generic self-empowerment anthem! I really love the melody and overall this is just a flawless pop song.

**VeganSquash** (10): so relatable when you have anxiety over EVERY CRINGY THING YOU'VE DONE

**vhqv1997** (10): The ultimate upbeat anthem of 2017

**MashLuke** (9.5): a song for happy moments

**thetimidmartian** (9.5): excellent songwriting and singing, the F5 on the bridge has a very good sound. her belting is often screamy and technically uncoordinated but she manages, with perhaps a little pitch correction to keep her fresh.

**zamomattel** (9.5): on first listen this was too kelly clarkson-y for me but i love it now

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Love than banjo on this and Kesha's general not-giving-a-fuck attitude here. If this isn't a single it should be.

**jhxcb** (9.1): It's a soft bop. I love it. It may not exactly be trop pop, but it took just a drop of it in the best way.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): i was never a fan of those verses but that chorus is just the bestest

**Albert\_Cole** (9): So fun, this really should have done so much better on the charts

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is where we get to see old Kesha again in this song. It's a very heartfelt song while manages to be catchy. If you want to hear a more upbeat song that is like Prayer, Learn to Let Go is that song.

**dwarfgourami** (9): This song is underrated but I just can't give it a ten since she tried to rhyme "victim" and "resentment"

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song has such an important message and Kesha nails it in all aspects.

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Subtle banjo on the chorus is life.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I thought this was a little too Pink-esque when it came out, but over time I started seeing it as one of the boppiest recovery songs ever recorded. It's interesting to know that Kesha also wrote this for a friend with a traumatic childhood, not just herself. Sharing your experiences with other abuse survivors can be very powerful.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): How are all the singles for this album so good?

**awryj** (8.8): a wholesome & kinda-generic-but-i-dont-care bop

**robbiec\_** (8.8): this song sound could be seen as twee but it came to me just as I needed it and if it's twee she sold it

**itsboogiepanda** (8.5): Really liked the song before the chorus, after that it goes downhill for me. In fact I like everything but the chorus

**nooodisaster** (8.5): im literally so happy for kesha shes such a powerful person for turning what she went through into something hopeful and not letting the innocent part of her heart die omfg like look at this joyful song right here.

**stardustanddinos** (8.5): Many times, in life we attach ourselves to pain, loathing and people who are not worth it. And at some point, we all have to let go of our attachments and love ourselves. Kesha bottles this entire sentiment into a lovely ballad and it works like magic.

**cyborglilith** (8.3): her chorus voice is weird

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** (8): Its biggest crime is sounding a bit generic

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): i love holding grudges too much but this is good

**crowlily** (8): Hmmm this is great! Chorus brings the points up! I really like the chorus!

**fifthchevron** (8): Why wasn't this a single?

**joshually** (8): I love the message of this song... like she's all "I know I keep telling all y'all to be stronger and move on and whatnot, but TBH I have to do it too and it is HARD" ok gurl?? Thank you!!!

**leviswift13** (8): The verses don't really connect with the chorus for me, but that chorus is perfect.

**melodyllic\_** (8): the poppiest thing we've come across so far. a lil forgettable, but that chorus is DAMN catchy

**therokinrolla** (8): a serviceable bop that snatched me at release, but has calmed down since

**topesmachine** (8): Kesha's voice is so powerful omg

**whatareblackhole** (8): Queen of pop and mental health!

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): one of the better songs on the album, for sure. It's pretty fun, the melodies are good, and the lyrics are above average for this album. Weak bridge but that's it.

**SupremeShani** (7.5): The line about it being time to practice what she preaches is touching to hear.

deleted: **ClocktowerMaria** (7): Pretty good, the hook is incredible but I don't quite love the production

**quaerex** (7): I'll never get over how amazing it is that Kesha went through what she went through and yet is more mature than half the people we see in the news media today.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i remember this being worse than it actually is

**TheLastAxolotl** (7): I like its production but you can hardly understand what she's saying in some verses

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): Honestly not a big fan of the verses, but the hook is great.

**vayyiqra** (7): anthemic

**Some… takes**

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Not gonna lie I thought Katy Perry was singing when this song first started.

**kromosol** (6.5): I found this one bit generic but it's catchy nontheless.

**Glennishill** (5): It's fine

**MrSwearword** (5): trying to split the difference between weird 80s pop a la B-52s and earnest Southern Fried RAWK was a gamble that didn't pay off that well. The cadence on the chorus is just too fucking choppy for my liking.

**Raykel** (3.5): I'm sorry I know people love this, but to me it plays it so safe and ends up being completely bland because of it.

Well you hoes, you did it. 

This song annihilates Taylor's record for the most 11's on a song, beating All Too Well's record of 24. 

The song, while was an anti-grower for me, I guess rightfully deserves it. I've read all the comments for this song, and can see how emotionally attached you were to it, and I can't argue that at all. For some, it was the safe 11, for others, it meant the most to you. Congrats Kesha, you deserved this win.

deleted: **The 11s Assays**

**amumumyspiritanimal** (11): okay literally what the fuck can i say, praying is easily one of the best songs of last year. the production is amazing, no one can tell me otherwise. it feels personal, empowering and uplifting. its such a simple yet so beautiful and amazing song. the lyrics are amazing on their own, and extremely understandable for people with traumatic experiences, and in context, its even more breath-taking. I literally(as in literally literally, not a parabolic thing) get chills whenever listening to this song. not only because of that high note, but the power of her voice, the screaming, the repressed anger boiling inside her, the power of her fury, her ability to control herself even while emotional, its just a beautiful experience. if there was a list of "100 songs you must listen to to understand human emotions", this would be at least number 7. its really just knocks me off my feet, the first few times i listened to it i couldn't stop crying, and i never even had major traumas in my life, but i just felt her pain and anger channeling through the song. there are only a handful songs able to make me feel like that, and only one of them is not from Lorde or Sia(it's Rachel Platten - Hands for the curious). the best way to describe it quick is hauntingly beautiful. she feels regal and poised yet raw and natural. the song both makes me want to punch a hole in my wall and also jump into a forest river and rise out as a nymph. this song is very very special in my opinion, one of the few songs you cant even skip because you would feel bad about it. if this doesnt get at least top 2, there is something fundamentally wrong with the rate and it needs a rig.

**specfagular** (11): I remember when this song came out I could not stop listening to it for at least 2 weeks and now every time it comes on shuffle I have to just let myself feel the music. I know this is a song about Kesha learning to forgive her rapist, but I really connect it with my own personal struggles in life, where I grew up with an abusive, manipulative, alcoholic father who constantly told me I wasn't going to do anything in life or be anything. Once he found out I was gay it was all over from there and he actually made a threat on my life (he was drunk so I didn't think it was serious but thinking back on it, it's VERY fucked up). Whenever I listen to this song I can't help but think about how, despite what he's done and said, I'm currently the first person in my family to go to college (on a free ride nonetheless), and I am graduating with my BA in Psychology on May 12 of this year. Literally every time I hear the line "I'm proud of who I am" it takes so much for me to not just burst into tears because it is just SO powerful. I love this song with all my being and I'm so happy it exists. Also I'm real excited to see how many 11s this song gets (also for the inevitable mass dragging that will occur for the people who rate it low).


**Brendon-Urine** (11): Easiest 11 I've ever given in a rate. This song is EVERYTHING. If it doesn't win, popheads is deleted. The emotion in this song, the lyrics, the pounding drums, the piano, it's all perfect.

**bwc222** (11): this song is one of the best of 2017. i played it on repeat for hours when it first came out, which happened to be right before i left for an amazing european vacation, so i also have many positive memories associated with the track. powerful and heartfelt without being sappy, this is the highlight of the rate.

**callmetidle** (11): The only ballad popheads likes

**ClocktowerMaria** (11): Duh

**DraculaWeekend** (11): An obvious 11. Truly amazing.

**dropthehammer11** (11): This song is absolutely breathtaking. The incredible vocal performance, painfully honest songwriting, beautiful keys, and the context just makes this one of the best pop songs I've heard this decade. I wasn't really that much a fan of Kesha, and I was so fucking proud of her for this song.

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (11): perfect lyrically sonically emotionally etc

**hikkaru** (11): I'm still new to the whole pop music scene and I almost entirely credit Praying as the catalyst for me getting into the genre. It's absolutely beautiful.

**Itsafudgingstick** (11): I wish I could write this super long essay on how meaningful and emotional this song was to me but I can't find the words to put together so I'll just say that I'm still left speechless by the high note.

**JackLebowski** (11): Most powerful song of the last year

**jhxcb** (11): Song of the Year. The Grammys are just straight-up wrong.

**letsallpoo** (11): if you truly believe this is the worst song on this collection of three mediocre albums then i think you have some problems to sort out with on your own time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (11): In a year full of weird trends and surprises, nothing was more surprising than hearing Kesha, the party girl, suddenly becoming the emotional center in pop music. Her fantastic voice elevated by Ryan Lewis' production and the amazing lyrics, make this a song to be reckoned with. And it finally shows Kesha's true talent to her naysayers. And it was the greatest hit song of 2017.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): I'm gonna be that basic pophead and give this my 11. It's one of the most powerful songs I've ever heard.

**OriginalKappa** (11): if this isn't the number one, i actually swear to god

**quaerex** (11): There's not a lot to say about this except that it's brilliant and hard to listen to because of how well-done it is. The high note in the end is amazing.

**Raykel** (11): This is one of those songs I just have no words for cause it's just too amazing to describe. It's overused but - I'm truly speechless.

**skargardin** (11): Kesha came back with a triumphant, earth-shaking return. It's so fucking powerful, emotional and defiant. The context of Kesha's overly-long legal battle can't be ignored when listening to this song. Even though I've heard it dozens of times I get major chills when the second chorus hits and that high note really is something else. If this doesn't win the rate I don't know what will.


**static\_int\_husp** (11): Propbably my favorite sigle from 2017. Raw and emotional, and the high note at the end pushes it over the top.

**SupremeShani** (11): I remember reading a comment that said that if you take away Kesha's story from this song, that it's just a generic ballad. It's true that the instrumental, production, and lyrics are nothing special, but they're still well crafted. The true standout out here are Kesha's vocals though, which are raw and filled with emotion. I also cannot just erase the reason Kesha released this song, as I think that's a disservice to her story and thousands of others who've been through similar traumas.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i think this goes without saying

**theburningundead** (11): hmm I wonder which song is going to win this rate

**therokinrolla** (11): this song has more cultural importance and impact than any other song in this rate. LWYMMD probably was "bigger," but Praying is an important symbol, and an important sign. This song is more than itself, its greater than the sum of its parts. its incredible that after the hell she went through, she manages to come out to the other end and say "i hope you can find peace" and "i hope you can move on." Its huge. Its a monster. #That'sMYGrammyWinner

**TheStarSquad** (11): YES KESHA! I can't put into words how much I love Praying. The way Kesha was able to actually release it, it's message, it's actual musicality, everything is perfect. I will forever be upset about this song losing the grammy to Shape of You, but it remains a literal iconic song in my books. As much as I adore Reputation, Praying deserves the 11 more than anything.

**thetimidmartian** (11): congratulations ms kesha rose on your grammy!

**twat\_brained** (11): Fuck what Adam Buckley says, fuck what the Grammys say, I AM SHUNNING ANY AND ALL NONBELIEVERS IN THIS LEGENDARY RETURN TO MUSIC FROM KESHA. I think the best part of this song is its progression. It swells at the right parts before properly crashing down hard on listeners with its climactic crescendo.

**VeganSquash** (11): ok, so I really didn't want to give this my 11 because its soooo cliché and generic to give an 11 to this, but like this song is so amazing and I'm jumping on the bandwagon OKAY. I still think that Kesha will never be able to hit the high note though, since she's never done it live.

**vhqv1997** (11): This song changed everybody's lives, let's be real. Delete r/popheads if this song doesn't make #1

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I was very sure I was gonna give this an 11 but I decided to give it to Getaway Car. I hope me not giving this song an 11 won't affect the song's ranking because I truly do think this song deserved to win. You can feel the hurt and pain that Kesha went through in this song and this song ages better with wine, with the sexual assault claims that are going around in Hollywood. Man, I want to cry. This song is fucking powerful.

**dwarfgourami** (10): I mean… next level artistry tbh

**enecks** (10): This is a statement. Make no mistake - this is a monolith of pop - a song that I remember where I was when I first heard it. I was on a bus ride home after a holiday. I heard Kesha had dropped a new track, so I listened. And I was blown away. Everything in this song is huge - the lyrics have imagery of heaven and hell and religion, the piano chords hit, the high note is so high. I cried when I first listened to this.

**fifthchevron** (10): One of the best songs of the decade. Kesha being what everyone thought was the worst example of modern popular music but then delivering the type of song those people wish still existed is the height of perfect irony. Also the whistle note means jack shit unless you take the journey leading up to it, the same way Praying resonates so strongly because of who Kesha is, what she originally represented and what she transformed her legacy into.

**followingfreeways** (10): the most powerful comeback ive ever seen and heard, and one of the most powerful songs ive ever listened to. she deserves the world and more.

**fourchip** (10): this is the goat of comebacks. she snapped

**Glennishill** (10): This song is fantastic. The lyrics are powerful and topical and I love how badass Kesha sounds in this song, especially when her voice cracks and soars. Personally, this is the song that changed my perspective of Kesha from dumpster succubus to valid artist.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is how you make a comeback! One of the most emotional and powerful songs as of recently. Kesha absolutely kills every single note and I have nothing bad to say about this at all.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/385943909160976394.png?v=1

**izeasklapaucius** (10): So fucking inspiring.

**jimmy345960** (10): Powerful.

**jonnl2806** (10): Now this is how you make a comeback. This song is perfection and what we all needed. The pain and heartache and that high note. Kesha was robbed at the grammys.

**kappyko** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**leviswift13** (10): A raw, personal, powerful statement that makes me proud to be alive during the same time as Kesha.

**m4ttycool** (10): there's no need to say anything

**MashLuke** (10): DRAG HIM BRO

**milkywayinradius** (10): a 3 min 50 second introspective moment of silence every time. Her emotion in this song is amazing

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is important strictly for the monumental moment that it was for Kesha and women in music. It's such a triumphant return for her, but on top of that... it's soooo good. The lyrics are strong, both in quality & spirit; they're mature, brave, vulnerable yet hopeful with just the right touch of righteous anger. Wow. I was and still am genuinely so proud of her & happy for her. Respect.

**MrSwearword** (10): the video is mainly the reason for this score but let's be real; the video is the best representation of this era because it's cathartic. It's release that means more than new music from a pop girl; Essentially, yas gawd slay a bit.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): we love a rate winner

**nooodisaster** (10): Not even judging this as a song, the EXPERIENCE of listening to this for the first time was one of the most powerful music moments of 2017, and something I'm not sure I'll ever forget. Kesha really truly did THAT, and Ryan Lewis' production does NOT fall behind. The first time the thumping started, and of course, that fucking note... Awe inspiring. Even though the lyrics aren't great and the song doesn't have as much replay value, I can't not give this a 10.

**PenOrAPencil** (10): I get chills every time I listen to the last minute and a half of the song. What a flawless song to stage your comeback with, Kesha

**rickikardashian** (10): There's nothing I could say about this song that hasn't been said and yet I'm still determined to give my unwanted opinion. Easily the most powerful song to hit the Billboard 100 this year, it shows sensibility but no weakness, this is just THE empowerment anthem and I honestly believe there's no way it could be improved, it's just perfection.

**robbiec\_** (10): I mean come on...

**SpanKKy1** (10): dr luke, more like dr puke

**stardustanddinos** (10): I cried buckets when I watched the video, and I still do. It's about forgiveness, something I've struggled with. About letting go, and loving yourself in spite of your scars. We live in turbulent times, even as conversations about abuse, mental illness and suffering are being had like never before. This song will be a symbol of that moment of reckoning for me - of celebrating our fellow spirits that lived through pain and abuse and finally sought justice to be able to move on from their wounds.

**theNealCutter** (10): Hot Take: This is not the best song on the album. It's still an amazing song though. As much as I love this song, all of its greatness comes most from its context and inspiration. It's a gorgeous hell of a ballad. The slow buildup to this carthartic ending makes it worth it to keep it on repeat for days. My only complaint is the track placing. This should've been the opening track tbh.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): A powerful, heartfelt, necessary song. I don't know how to add much to the conversation that hasn't been said already, because all of the praise everyone has heaped onto this song is definitely deserved. It's legitimately beautiful.

**topesmachine** (10): some things... only god can forgive ....... eeYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH

**whatareblackhole** (10): This song is unbelievably powerful. An iconic moment for pop and for sexual assault survivors.

**zamomattel** (10): ok kesha now i am religious

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): A show-stopping ballad with a ton of dramatic swell and emotional power. The high note is one of my favorite moments in any song ever. My only (very minor) complaint is that it takes a tad too long to get to the buildup.

**crowlily** (9.2): I was so shook by this song when I first listened, and this is still such good quality! By the time the second verse sails I'm thoroughly shook again! As the song progresses I'm more and more shook rip me.

**awryj** (9): this can win tbh

**EuphoricNeckbeard** (9): The main reason this isn't my 11 is those "waah waah WAAAH waah" strings in the middle. You know the ones.

**melodyllic\_** (9): truly a modern classic. a bit too emotionally layered for me to listen and bop to on a regular basis, but when i do, ugh the waterworks come pouring

**TheLastAxolotl** (9): No words can describe it

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8.5): that note wig

**Damoojo** (8): Fuck you Dr. Luke!!

**itsboogiepanda** (8): Isolated I don't think the song is that special, fight me

**natsby** (8): I don't feel like I could rate this any lower out of respect, even if it's not necessarily a song I would play on repeat

**swadadu** (8): Loses it's luster after a few listens, but still great.

**vayyiqra** (8): powerful

**VodkaInsipido** (8): great but overrated

**sletrab07** (7.5): Good lyrics and oustanding delivery, marred by uninspired and ill-fitting production. Kesha deserved better than Ryan Lewis B- job here.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): What was once one my favorite tracks of the year has only aged with contempt, and I think most of the hype came from a promise of what would be, a tattered, defiant, nuanced look at what was. And in parts, Praying nails this, with a pulsing synth, and a dramatic chorus, but after more listens, I feel like that initial impact is lost, and some of the more harsh vocal treatments here get kinda grating and annoying. Sorry, Kesha, but I'm praying this one doesn't win.

**The REALLY brave souls who didn't give this a 7+**
---

**agentofscranton** (6.5): i know i'm gonna get crucified for giving praying anything less than a 10 but i honestly just can't get into it as a song - i'm giving it the score i'm giving it entirely for the song as a pop culture moment - but as a song it's really nothing special :/

**ComeOnAndSLANG** (6.5): yikes do i hate that high note... negative points for that

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): it's…. okay. Not amazing. The high note is so overhyped, the lyrics are… okay, the vocals are also above average.

**CarlieScion** (6): I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't love this song. I love the lyrics and how strong Kesha is and most of her vocals - but that damn high note always catches me off guard and makes me jump in a bad way. It's just ruins the song for me.

**gannade** (6): reallly overrated, but an OK song nevertheless. the high note snapped but the rest is just

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): don't hate me but mediocre

**Piccprincess** (5.5): I'll be praying that someday she hits that high note live

**PuggleMaster** (5.5): takes forever for the song to get going. The high note doesn't sound good after multiple listens.

**cyborglilith** (5): I appreciate how she wrote a song about her struggles, but I don't think it's a good song.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): I feel as though even though the song's message is very strong, and I totally support it, it falls short. Kesha can't hit the high note live, despite numerous attempts at it. Honestly, I can only handle Kesha screaming the chorus for so long and I feel like Rainbow does this so much better and is the superior ballad.

**I Hope They Are Praying**
---

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): ugh this pains me because it's such an IMPORTANT song and i love the idea of it but musically it's just... bland. that high note was also serving overly processed modern Mariah on Infinity and i just can't.

**joshually** (3): Can I be honest? I..... dislike this song. I've been lying to my popheads all this time... It's just so overwrought and sounds terribly forced, and the melody/chorus is just unappealing. It's a great song nonetheless which I'm sure/hope will help people who are going through things, but I'm just not a fan. The irony is that it is my least favorite song on my favorite album of 2017. GOD I FEEL LIKE A HUGE WEIGHT HAS BEEN LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDER

**MaximumFriendship** (3): there are a couole personal issues I have with this song that I really don't like about it...

**dirdbub** (0): this song has an amazing backstory and is very emotional, but it's another song from this album that fell play to radio overplay for me. I have no aux cord in my car, so I'm stuck with the radio and I cannot tell you how many times I've had to turn on my car at 6:45AM to the shrill autotuned mess of a high note in this song. it's absolutely ruined the song for me

**OceanSage** (0): I really appreciate the message and Kesha's bravery on Praying, but the higher pitch that she sings on Praying really bothers me. It starts to hurt my head by the time she gets to the highest note. I feel her emotion in the song, but I just cannot stand the way she sings it. That coupled with hearing it on the radio endlessly has ruined Praying, which I originally enjoyed.

[ALL AVERAGES](https://pastebin.com/Pv64q14E)

**Overall average**: 7.627

---

**TragicKingdom1**: I really like this album! Definitely a step in the right direction for Kesha, it maintains her songwriting skill but updates the production to be more mature and acoustic. I give a lot of credit to her for being able to have such a diverse array of songs that also feel cohesive; the only real outlier is Emotional and that's a bonus track. In addition, I think it's very admirable that there are MANY ballads and midtempos yet not a single one bores me whatsoever. It proves that if you have momentum in your songwriting/production, you don't need vocals to sell a ballad. The only real flaw is that with such a non-same-soundy album there was bound to be some production that just didn't work, but there isn't any song that is outright bad. Overall I think that if you're at all a fan of guitar-driven pop you should give this album a listen. [Grade: A]

**enecks**: This album is just an all around gem that hits all its targets with skill. The ballads are emotionally powerful, the rock influenced tracks are energetic fun, the weird stuff is weird. I'm so glad that this album is causing Kesha to get more serious respect and acclaim, because she's long been deserving of it.

**dirdbub**: I really wish this album was better, I really do

**kappyko**: Spitirual

**skargardin**: I have major respect for Kesha for making this album. It’s an album of self-healing and love, I could’ve used this during the darker days of my life. It’s definitely her best album so far and I can’t wait to see where she takes her music next.

**stardustanddinos**: I thought it was just overhyped because her comeback clouded everyone’s judgment. But the first full listen through the album (which I did for this rate) shattered all illusions. What strikes me throughout is how earnest and heartfelt every song feels. Kesha loves music, and this album feels like it was her way of healing. You see different sides of her. It’s to the point, earnest and more importantly, a reflection of her strengths as an artist. There are some flaws, definitely – some of the songs are quite forgettable. But Kesha’s sheer heart pulls the songs into a lovely and moving record. I hope this album is remembered as one of the best pop albums of this decade, as it rightfully should be.

**Mudkip1**: i like this album but it's not really the kind of music i'm into. she did country better than miley though i'll give her that

**TheStarSquad**: What a fucking masterpiece. Kesha Rose Sebert went through something truly traumatic and was able to take those memories and weave them into a stunning musical experience. From front to back, her third studio album reflects her true personality and the musical style she has always wanted to achieve.

**agentofscranton**: it's certainly character development for Miss Kesha in terms of sound, but essentially it's the same thing she's always been peddling in terms of themes and lyricism

**patronsaintofaspies**: Sure, this album may have been received slightly better because of the circumstances around it, but, honestly, who cares? An artist will always reflect themselves in their art, and you can't ever separate the two, ever. I think most of the songs that are specifically about Kesha's trauma are so powerful, they make up for the weaker spots on the album. Even if this type of music usually isn't to my taste, and even if her vocals on some songs aren't perfect, the message Kesha brings here is very important to me and other people who have gone through the problems she has. It's rare we get an album this realistic yet this optimistic. It was a bright spot in 2017, an album to listen to when I was down. And I hold it in high regard for that.

**whatareblackhole**: I love Kesha Rose Sebert so much. This album is such a deeply personal piece and an extremely exciting pop moment. The strength and dignity displayed by Kesha was so breathtaking the first time I listened to this. The albums in this rate are similar to me because they all seem to be approaching loneliness in different ways. Kesha, to me, seems lonely in her fight for mental peace, especially in the final song, Spaceship. Kesha feels so alone on and unfit for this planet that she wishes to be abducted and taken to another…how sad is that? I think this album has amazing moments of lyricism on strength, especially through friendship and being in love, but at the end of the night, when all you have is you, it can be hard to keep going. Rainbow was probably one of my favorite albums of 2017 and I'm happy to see others saying the same.

**dwarfgourami**: I’m planning on getting a tattoo based on this album and I cried 3 times when I saw the Rainbow tour so I’m probably biased

**SendMeYourSATScores**: my least favorite of these 3 even though the average probably is higher

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Rainbow is really THAT album. Kesha came back from her forced hiatus after all the horrible things that happened to her and managed to make an album that not only features songs about her dealing with her personal tragedies but also about many many many other things, which just show how versatile and wholesome and amazing she is. i dont have a song on this album i havent listened the hell out of, and two of them even made it into my top 10 all time favorite songs, the only other artist with two songs there is Lorde and that means a lot to me personally. she really did that. idk i will probably have a perfect score given to her because i literally cant find any problems with this album(okay maybe I don't like Hymn that much as the rest of the album)(P.S. I EVEN HAVE THE PHYSICAL COPY YA HOES DONT DOUBT ME)

**1313Harbor**: I just don’t see how the emotion Kesha conveys throughout this album could even be compared to Reputation and Witness, which largely feel like more superficial albums to me. Although I appreciate that all three women were taking risks with these albums and testing out new styles that may or may not have paid off, Rainbow is the only one that feels truly honest and groundbreaking to me. Kesha’s masterpiece tells stories of love, pain, heartbreak, abuse, empowerment, and forgiveness, all wrapped up in a message of acceptance and self-love. Admitted bias: this is the only album of the three I have seen performed live (not that anyone has seen the Reputation tour yet).

**angusaditus**: an absolute chore to get through, so many of the song were just straight up ugly imo

**nooodisaster**: Can i just give every song on this a 10?

**Elitefourbrad**: Honestly, this album has not aged well, even though it came out last summer. A weak second half complete with a confusing theme and tone problem does take away from the album for me. But nonetheless, there are a few highlights on here that you should check out. 7.2/10.

**MissyBee37**: I wish all the peace & love in the world to Kesha, and I am so happy for her that she could make this record. It's such a triumph. It isn't my cup of tea & I don't enjoy the album overall, but I respect it.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Among the albums in this rate, Rainbow stands out as the most personal, most genuine one here. You can tell that she poured her heart out in this album and she definitely wanted to make an album like this for so long. What amazes me is that even though this album is different from her other albums, it's still pretty much the Kesha we know in a new light. I may be more of a Warrior fan (I can't wait to rate that album again cause it's full of bops) but I am very happy she is free from Dr. Luke. Bye bih!

**SpanKKy1**: i wish pop girls would stop experimenting

**Albert\_Cole**: One Thursday, as I sat in a lecture in Newcastle, my straight best friend in Bristol texted me to ask if I was busy the following Tuesday. And so on that Tuesday, I was stood in a queue with him outside the Electric Brixton in London, eating McDonald's and waiting for the doors to open. It was a fucking amazing night - he gained a new appreciation for my favourite musician (who he had kind of dismissed until then) and I got to skip a couple of days of uni to let loose and be a bit gay. Kesha is *incredible* live.

**SkyBlade79**: IMO, shouldn’t be in a rate. It’s too sensitive of an album to be anything close to truly objective about it, considering the motive, but I’ll be as honest as possible. This album really destroyed my hopes for Kesha’s musical style, disregarding the nonmusic history of it. I expected and hoped for sensitive, emotional bops like The Harold Song mixed in with some newer more acoustic songs. Instead, we get this mess. It has no idea what it’s trying to do… the lyrics are consistently bad, but not in the charming way that Warrior era Kesha was. The ballads are mostly boring, a lot of the songs say the exact same things, and the production features add little. Average: 5.333

**twat\_brained**: Dash is best pony

deleted: ~~youre dead to me~~ but really, i find it... interesting. I wouldve thought that Praying is considered an amazing ballad (i mean it won) and i felt a lot more emotion in it compared to The Harold Song, personally. I agree that its just HARD to rate an album thats basically a diary for an artist, because some people might feel for rating something on it low. 
But i mean, could you explain on the “more sensitive, emotional bops” part? We have praying, emotional ballad, Learn to Let go, which is kind of like a sequel to Praying but is also a dance song (and lyrically one of the best on he album IMO), we Hunt you down which is acoustic/country influenced AND a bop. 
We cant really discuss the lyrical part i guess, because that all comes to personal opinion about lyrics you like. Personally, i thought the lyrics were personal, relatable, and some of the songs feature her best writing to date. They arent all masterpieces in this category, but i dont think theres any song on the album that has BAD lyrics. 
This is my favorite album, like, ever, so im probably very biased, but i hope this was enough to have a discussion with

SkyBlade79: Well, I was talking more about the "bop" part. With the exception of the best song, "Learn to Let Go", this song is either sensitive ballads or ditzy, pointless bops (which isn't a bad thing). I don't remember being so harsh tbh, so just ignore the second half. I just don't think that it would be fair to rate an album that you can't give low scores to without facing backlash.
