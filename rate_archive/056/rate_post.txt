If you're like me, you love holiday music. If you're not like me, I feel sorry for you because I'm great. For those of us that show any inkling of taste, I have a fun game that will last a few weeks on the sub. We are going to have a quick speed rate of some holiday songs. The format for this is going to be slightly different from a normal rate, let me explain:

**Stage one** is this! There is about one billion holiday songs out there. How can we possibly decide what to rate? Well, you guys are going to decide that! I'll post a google forms link, and you'll submit 5 holiday songs you want to rate. I'll get more into details after.

**Stage two** will start next week on December 11. I'll reveal the 25 songs we will be rating, and will include a form to submit.

**Stage three** will be right before Christmas and will be the entire reveal in one day!

So, there's some obvious songs that will be in the rate regardless. We all know we want to rate Santa Tell Me or All I Want For Christmas Is You. I'm going to save some time for everyone, and include some of the more popular or iconic songs to begin with. I'm doing this for a couple of reasons. This way you don't have to "waste" a submission slot for these wildly popular songs. Another reason is if everyone submitted for these songs, the other 15 might have like one submission each and be random songs only one person wanted. This way the submissions will be a little varied, and a better indicator of the top songs we'd want to rate anyways. The songs I have deemed important enough to skip the submission process are:

1. Justin Bieber - Misletoe

2. Michael Buble - It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas

3. Mariah Carey - All I Want For Christmas Is You

4. Kelly Clarkson - Underneath The Tree

5. Ariana Grande - Santa Tell Me

6. Bobby Helms - Jingle Bell Rock

7. Brenda Lee - Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree

8. Paul McCartney - Wonderful Christmastime 

9. Wham! - Last Christmas 

10. Andy Williams - It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year

Now it's up to **[YOU](https://i.imgur.com/u9T6CHl.jpg)** to pick the rest of the rate! To keep the picks diverse, I'm going to enforce a rule of 5 different artists per submission. Don't stockpile your favourite holiday songs on one artist y'all! There's millions of holiday songs out there; Carly's Let It Snow, Mittens, and Last Christmas aren't the only things worth submitting! Also this is for all HOLIDAY songs! So you're more than welcome to submit your Hannukah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, and New Years songs as well! Remember to **SPECIFY WHICH ARTIST IS SINGING THE SONG**! Otherwise I just won't count it because "White Christmas" can be about 800 different options.

Lastly, just for variety and so it's not 15 versions of Last Christmas that get in, I will create a rule. There's going to be a cap of 3 songs per artist allowed in. If the entirety of Christmas and Chill is submitted, only the 3 most popular songs will be rated. This will also be applied to 3 covers per song. The top 3 versions of Silent Night will be let in, and the fourth most popular will be void. If you guys have any questions let me know; I'm bad at words and explaining things lol.
