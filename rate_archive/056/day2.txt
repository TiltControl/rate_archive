Popheads Holiday Music Rate Reveal
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/a7o7yi/popheads_holiday_music_rate_reveal/

The time has come for me to stop pestering you! 

Two weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/a2xjw6/popheads_holiday_music_rate_part_one/) I asked for you to submit holiday songs you'd like to rate, and one week ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/a53wfi/popheads_holiday_music_rate_part_two/) is when I announced the songs to rate. Some notes:

* In one week I managed to get **39 submissions**, the list of people can be seen [here](https://pastebin.com/WXr6TsAr)

* The average score is **7.5503**

* The average controversy score is **2.2912**. Anything bigger than that should be considered controversial.

* Today I will be revealing ALL 25 songs starting at 1:00 EST (one hour after this was posted)

I can't think of someone who has a worse voice for holiday music. Sia has a very theatrical and dramatic voice, and that's not what I want in holiday music. Santa's Coming For Us is almost threatening, and the only benefit to the song is that it's catchy for like 3 seconds in the chorus. The rest of the song is garbage, and it deserves its last place slot.

---
**mudkip** (11): bop sia won christmas (this is also in the bottom half on her christmas album tbh sk)

**jamesfog** (10): Overhated

**pearllouise** (10): The title of this song sounds like a great Christmas horror flick. Krampus outsold

**bigenemies** (9.3): - Sia really does make me sing my heart out with all of my love.

**selegend** (9): sia is a goddess

**twat\_brained** (9): yes santa baby give me all your sweet snowy cummies- Wait. Is this the first time we've rated a Sia song? If it is I have to laugh. I'm glad it's this one, though. I find it pretty underrated for a holiday song. Then again it's only a year old so it's not like we've had an extended period to ruminate upon it. I like it anyway.

**vitriformfoil** (8): - I love it just because how original of a Christmas song it is

**notdallin** (7.7): it’s a great catchy tune but i don’t see it becoming a classic at all

**1998tweety** (7): this is not nearly as bad as I remembered, much better than the other songs on the album though.

**strawberryswing1** (7): I really hate the beginning, her vocals there are NOT the tea. But I actually enjoy the chorus and most of the rest of the song, and it's not as bad as people made me expect.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Kind of cute.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i really want to like this more because it is great on paper but it's also kinda terrible at the same time

**callmetidle** (4): This is one of the more listenable songs on the album unfortunately

**ExtraEater** (4): didn't get it then, still don't now

**skargardin** (3): her vocals on the verses sure are...interesting

**lilguavachan** (1): what homosexual grabbed the monkey's paw and wished for sia to release christmas songs? because this is bad.

**radiofan15** (1): I think I would enjoy this one more if Sia didn't signed as if she was being murdered slowly by the Krampus

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): is this a threat

**gannade** (0): This is the worst song ever made. The fact that she made this for Christmas is so clearly demonic and unchristian.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Fuck this terrible song and its fucking 0 redeeming qualities. Sia's voice is terrible on this, the lyrics are stupid, it's barely christmasy, her pronunciation sounds like she's doing the chubby bunny challenge while recording this and I hate this song so fucking much, this is legitimately one of my least favorite songs of all time, no meme.

So this song is massive in the UK, but virtually non-existent in North America. So I actually didn't hear this until last year when it [came fifth in the Top Ten Pop Ten results](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7n92tw/our_top_ten_holiday_songs_top_ten_pop_ten_results/). So, naturally I went to listen to see what this supposedly amazing song is I had never heard. Well, I hated it and thought the UK had made zero points. I listen to holiday music year round tbh, so in like October of this year I listened to it again and it instantly clicked. I went from thinking it was trash to thinking this is the best song ever. It is just so fun, and the UK has made infinite points. All of you the dragged it, give it another chance because it is big good.

---
**ExtraEater** (11): the best moment: "I could have been someone... / Well so could anyone, you took my dreams from me when I first found you / ...I kept them with me babe, I put them with my own, Can't make it all alone, I've built my dreams around you..." amazing. easily my favorite Christmas song.

**CarlieScion** (10): I stan the f-word

**shipsinker44** (10): I LOVE this type of music

**notdallin** (9.1): the progression for every American hearing this song for the first time: (0:45) lol what is this? Is this a joke? (1:50) oh. Oh wow. (2:55) wow that’s quite beautiful. (3:43) GIVE ME TWO PINTS OF GAT AND A BOTTLE OF BULMERS! AY AND GET ME A SHOULDER OF CAPTAIN MORGAN, I WANT A NAGGIN OF VODKA! ‘AVE A ‘APPY CHRISTMAS ALL YE OIRISHMAN!

**itsabop** (9): Beautiful melody

**twat\_brained** (8): The accents sound like people trying to act like the highest upperclassmen in Britain. The song makes it feel like I'm back in fall 2012 when I visited Ireland to see my mom who was in an interim business position. So I'm unsure why it's called "Fairytale of New York". The outro is a bit too long for my patience, though. Most importantly, I'm on the side of "these guys can say "faggot"". Cancel me :P

**bigenemies** (7.5): - This rating started off pretty low, but as the song went on I kept increasing the score. It gives me theatre vibes.

**1998tweety** (6): this is controversial? its ok......someone informed me they say the f slur and i promptly dropped my score by a whole point hihi

**jamesfog** (5): Mixed feelings

**selegend** (5): good instrumentation but those vocals lol

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this is just okay to begin but i do not appreciate the slur

**vitriformfoil** (4): - I want to like this song, but the instrumentals to me don't scream or even say Christmas to me, and I can't understand their accent for most of the song

**radiofan15** (3.1): The first half is late-era Bob Dylan and the second is a lame pirate Christmas song... ugh your minds for choosing to rate this

**tapdancingpig** (3): Ok, when the main instrumental kicked in, this started to not suck. But I do not forgive this song for the first minutes.

**gannade** (2): interesting.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): jesus christ that first verse. and did they say Faggot? they're cancelled sis, never started, tea bro.

**lilguavachan** (1): that singing voice lmao no thank you dear

**mudkip** (1): what the fucking fuck

**original\_doll** (1): I know lots of people consider this a classic but, personally, I want to listen to fun Christmas music, so for me it fails as a holiday song. And even ignoring that, the vocals sound kinda unpleasant to me :/

**pearllouise** (0): Too homophobic. The slur “faggot” is used in this song. I thought this was a gays only rate

**poppinmmolly** (0): this is the worst Christmas song I have ever heard in my life. It was everywhere when I went to the UK last Christmas. Nobody is serving vocals and it's a bitter, bitter song why do people like this. The f slur is bad too.

**strawberryswing1** (0): what the fuck is this trash. this is the worst thing i've ever heard.

Everything about this is bad and offensive. Please do not sexualize Christmas. /u/Therokinrolla you're a fucking idiot for thinking this is 11 worthy you're almost as terrible as this song is. I hate this song so much omg it's so bad I can't

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10 since its Gaga

**gannade** (10): i want to be under her christmas tree

**lilguavachan** (10): it's not a GOOD song by any means.... but it's a very fun song

**mudkip** (10): kinda sexy

**tapdancingpig** (9): This will get robbed.

**bigenemies** (7.5): - Damn I wasn’t expecting a hoe hoe hoe song.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): VOCAL BATTLE: Andrew Taggart vs Space Cowboy This isn't even like offensively bad, it's white party girl trash bad. Which makes it kinda good, just like Wonderful Christmastime. Looking forward to seeing this have the highest controversy score in the rate.

**jamesfog** (7): A Nadia Oh'd bop

**skargardin** (6): i'm having conflicting feelings once again, i always go between absolutely hating and loving this

**CarlieScion** (4): what the actual fuck

**pearllouise** (4): I’d rather listen to Gaga sing a duet with ~~her sugar daddy~~ Tony Bennet

**callmetidle** (3.5): I’m not a prude, I just take comedy very seriously

**radiofan15** (3.5): I'm a Godga stan and there's a reason I didn't objected when this Deck The Halls-inspired The Fame rejected demo ended that low in my ranking of Gaga songs... also I sweared it felt longer than just two and a half minutes

**original\_doll** (3): I guess I appreciate she was trying to do a ~unique Christmas song?? but this is garbage

**TragicKingdom1** (3): ok i have bopped to this ironically before but it is really not good

**selegend** (2): sounds like D-list pop star music

**ImADudeDuh** (1): gurl.... this is terrible. it sounds like a shitty lady gaga parody from a parody youtuber that has 35k subs, but hasnt put out a video since 2011.

I'm not really sure why this song was dragged and why some of you haven't heard it before? It's super popular, and been remade like every ten years. In the time of giving, it makes sense to have a song about giving to charity.

**CarlieScion** (11): Outsold every other Christmas song ever

**mudkip** (10): ive never heard this before and i really enjoyed it thank you so much naps for this rate! uwu

**1998tweety** (8): this sounds like what a radiohead fan listens to

**callmetidle** (8): I think the original is the only one that really did a good job accommodating all the different singers and feeling like an actual ensemble; the 2014 version didn’t have enough song for that many people, especially since they all had a line.

**jamesfog** (8): Cool

**pearllouise** (8): We love charity work

**radiofan15** (7.8): I quite like it but I remembered it to be more energetic... at least it's miles better than We Are The World

**bigenemies** (7): I can’t bop to this… but it gets like 2 extra points for having such a beautiful message.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Meh.

**vitriformfoil** (7): - freddie should have been here

**twat\_brained** (6.4): Dear God this song is so fucking daft. I appreciate that it raised millions and helped those less fortunate in incredibly impoverished communities, but they know it's Christmas. I wish we were rating the 30th anniversary recording with One Direction on it.

Honestly, Justin Bieber's Christmas album is way better than it has any right to be to the point that I bought the physical CD of it years ago. This song pops off, and the sexism on this sub showed again because there is no way this should be so low.

---
**1998tweety** (10): i do not remember Justin's age when this came out so I will refrain from making a comment

**selegend** (10): wait why does his voice sound so good

**gannade** (8): funfact, at work i said mariah had my fav xmas song and my middle aged coworker said this was her favorite and i was kinda shook.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its cute idc.

**original\_doll** (8): ok but this is kind of a bop honestly

**strawberryswing1** (8): this isn't bad actually

**ExtraEater** (7.5): i should be playing in the play ground

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): holds up surprisingly well...not making it an EDM pop monstrosity turned out to be an excellent choice

**notdallin** (7): you know Justin, you really *should* be chillin with your folks instead of locking lips with this shawty that we all know you’re gonna dump when the next one comes around in the next music video.

**bigenemies** (6.9): - I get the appeal but baby Justin just doesn’t do it for me.

**callmetidle** (6.8): This isn’t really bad, but I can’t say it really does anything good enough to make me want to listen to it

**jamesfog** (5): Thankfully I forgot this song existed until this rate reminded me of it

**pearllouise** (5): Here’s a tip: Don’t stand in the middle of the street when filming your music videos, Justin

**Pugglemaster** (4): it's more boring than anything

**tapdancingpig** (4): I forgot why I used to hate Bieber. I was just reminded.

**twat\_brained** (4): I do not like this as much as I do at age 20 compared to age 13. For one, I've stopped Beliebing. Second, Todd in the Shadows made a number of points in his review. As a whole, it's pretty dopey and hearing Justin say "shawty" on a Christmas song does not work for me. If this doesn't have the sleigh bells on it it's just a cut from Believe Acoustic. For Christmas this year I wish for Justin to make headlines in 2019 for useful reasons.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): this really does absolutely nothing for me

**vitriformfoil** (2): -

**lilguavachan** (1): i just can't stand justin's voice

**radiofan15** (0): Thank God Bieber grew out of this whiny teeny Youtuber musician phase... if he could only leave his cult behind

This song is pretty polarizing, which I didn't realize until this year. I thought everyone just commonly accepted this massive banger. I can somewhat see disliking the heavy synths, but it's so wild and frantic it's just FUN and that's what the holidays are!

---
**bigenemies** (10): - Self-explanitory. Simple, wonderful, Christmas song.

**poppinmmolly** (10): haters back off

**ExtraEater** (9): honestly it works

**followingfreeways** (9): i JUST learned the words to this because of this rate!!!!!!! ive always sung "santa, happy, wonderful christmastime" i hate myself

**JunkyGS** (9): this song is sooooooo bad, but it is one of my christmas favorites lol

**pearllouise** (9): Kanye discovered a true talent

**callmetidle** (8.8): this is trash and i love it

**twat\_brained** (7.6): DING DONG DING DONG DING DONG anyone get any uncanny valley vibes? I like Paul but this is probably the dorkiest Christmas song in existence. And I feel like I can't help but lightly nod my head along. Okay, those claps near the end fucking sent me. I'm surprised that I don't dislike this as much as I thought; it's somewhere in a "so bad it's good" range for me.

**notdallin** (6.8): the weirdest Christmas song in the classic Christmas canon.

**vitriformfoil** (6): - Its great except the synth(?) ringing in the background can get annoying

**1998tweety** (5): ok this is not good at all, the vocals are robotic and lack emotion, the production is definitely a choice too.

**tapdancingpig** (5): This is hilariously awful, but it also kind of bops?

**radiofan15** (4.9): I've heard most joyful Christmas songs in the Interstellar soundtrack

**TragicKingdom1** (2): i appreciate the synthesizer choice but nothing about this works

**gannade** (1): this song is polarizing and im on the "NO" side

**lilguavachan** (1): no

**selegend** (1): i hate this old bitch

**jamesfog** (0): This song always creeped me out. It also goes on for way too long

**mudkip** (0): did the version on spotify go through a toaster or something this is ugly i dont remember it being like this

The Cheetah Girls Christmas album is honestly really choice. That being said, this song pops off. It's not near as good as anything from Cheetah Girls 2 (Strut is legitimately one of the best songs of all time), but it's a cute Christmas bop that gives you holiday cheer without resorting to the classics you've heard 1000 times before. Also when will we rate a Cheetah Girls soundtrack @mods

---
**1998tweety** (10): /u/omgpanda has made some points

**gannade** (10): the cheetah girls is the best girl group of all time

**jamesfog** (10): Put some respect on Cheetah Girls names yall

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): they made SEVERAL points

**twat\_brained** (10): Last song I'm listening to for this rate. Best for last? I wouldn't say so. Definitely a fun one, though! I'm surprised I never saw this on Disney Channel this time of year or anything. CG3 did something right here!

**followingfreeways** (9): omg idk how ive never heard this but it's an absolute bop and i feel like my childhood is disappointed in me!!!

**strawberryswing1** (9): 90's kids stand the fuck up

**pearllouise** (7): Song’s a bop but the shitty low-budget green screen in the video is a mess

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this isn't that good but i do like the R&B production

**tapdancingpig** (6.9): The production bops, but what the fuck are these lyrics?

**notdallin** (6.3): I always thought that the Cheetah Girls sans Raven was kinda jokey, but this was actually a pretty fun song. Though I can’t get that Cheetah print Santa suit outta my head yeesh

**bigenemies** (5.5): - Sorry guys, this didn’t age well.

**radiofan15** (5.5): The genre of this song is mid-2000s... also Cheetah-licious doesn't sound as enticing as they might have expected

**skargardin** (5): why is this a thing

**lilguavachan** (3): no thanks

**original\_doll** (2): admittedly the chorus is slightly catchy but so, so cringey

**Pugglemaster** (2): I wanted to give this a good score for the memes, but this is terrible :skull:

The only thing that can make the Witness era funnier is releasing an *Amazon Exclusive* song. I didn't even know Amazon had a streaming service. That being said, Cozy Little Christmas is better than it has any right to be. I've heard it on the radio a couple times, and honestly if she tried this could have *been* something. It seems a little Zooey Deschanel, but who doesn't want a little quirk every now and then

---
**Pugglemaster** (10): I wasn't expecting a lot out of this since it was a amazon exclusive, but this was amazing omg. Sis needs to put this on spotify omg

**gannade** (9.5): im really surprised but katy made some points

**shipsinker44** (9.5): bangs hard

**twat\_brained** (9.3): As far as I can tell this is the only song I'm going into this rate completely blind. I appreciate Katy's twee sound but I'm not sure about the "keep up the jones" lyric. I like the "popsicle toes" lyric though; it reminds me of California Gurls. All in all, I think it's pretty fun! I don't think it's an instant classic nor do I think it's gonna boost Katy's royalties, but I can appreciate Katy putting her own spin on holiday music.

**jamesfog** (9): a BOP!

**pearllouise** (9): Minus one point because it’s not on Spotify

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): queen of securing free chanel

**skargardin** (8.5): this was actually really darn cute, shook!

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Absolutely adorable.

**notdallin** (7.6): you know what? BETTER than I expected; but NOT good enough for me to jump through all the hoops to find it again. WHO MAKES AN AMAZON PRIME EXCLUSIVE CHRISTMAS SONG? Maybe it’s because of the frisky line… or the caressin’ line … or the popsicle… toes… line.

**radiofan15** (7.5): Katy: "I'm sad that I flopped this era"... also Katy: "this is gonna be an Amazon exclusive"

**1998tweety** (7): Every Day Is A Holiday sweetie....

**callmetidle** (7): Nat king cole deserved a spot in this rate. Also this song is cute, just cute.

**followingfreeways** (7): didnt know this song existed but that is pretty much all i have to say about it

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its fine but why did it have to be an amazon exclusive

**vitriformfoil** (7): - Its not bad but EDIAH should have had the proper release over this if that was a choice

**bigenemies** (6): - I listened to a potato quality version so idk if there’s supposed to be laughing children and car horns beeping or…

**TragicKingdom1** (6): it's cute

**lilguavachan** (5): it's like if sara bareilles and zooey deschanel had a christmas baby they don't talk about.

An iconic anthem protesting the Vietnam war, this song is a classic for a reason. Although, I honestly can't listen to it without thinking of the War Amps commercial they play this time of year and it just shows a bunch of African children looking sad at the camera with this playing and then tells you to donate at the end and ugh the guilt trip is too strong

---
**1998tweety** (10): iconic, miley did it better tho

**bigenemies** (10): - This is a perfect Christmas song. It captures all the feelings of the season - Joy, hope, nostalgia. The choir and bells! It’s just beautiful.

**jamesfog** (10): mess I thought this was a U2 song

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**radiofan15** (9.8): The opening gave me Farrah Abraham's After Prom vibes, but the rest of the track is really great... but I have to deduct 0.2 points for how weird the children choir sounds at the chorus

**CarlieScion** (9): John Lennon was a shitbag but this song is good

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): obviously vocals aren't really john's strength but he really slayed with this song, it captures christmas cheer very nicely.

**pearllouise** (8): Can John Lennon help end Nicki and Cardi’s war, too?

**twat\_brained** (8): "Let's hope it's a good one, without any fear" Oh, like the fear that John is gonna viciously slap Sean for getting him the wrong present? I'll admit it was cute to hear him and Yoko whisper to each other at the start. I don't notice these things on stereo. I also don't notice the strings in the background. The "war" that was over was the Vietnam War, right? I'll admit I'm not a fan of the children shouting "Happy Christmas" at the end over and over.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I appreciate the 6/8 time signature more than I probably should.

**vitriformfoil** (7): - Its a different kind of christmas song that i enjoy

**notdallin** (6.7): I’m not a fan of disguising overtly political themes in Christmas music, especially with (lowkey annoying) children’s choirs singing your political agenda, but there’s no denying that this song has become a holiday classic and a proclamation of peace around the time when peace is most necessary. ^Celine ^did ^it ^better ^tho

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): p cheesy but kinda catchy too

**shipsinker44** (6): kinda creepy ngl

I'll be honest: I don't know why the Britney stans love this so much. This was voted into the rate during the first round, and had double the submissions of second place. Y'all wanted to rate this BAD. The thing is I find this song extremely forgettable? I've listened to it a bunch over the past couple weeks trying to understand the hype, and I don't even remember how it goes until I press play. It's like it instantly leaves my brain when it's over. So, I'm glad y'all found a song that makes you happy but I can safely say it's not for me.

---
**1998tweety** (10): i know this will be sabotaged, Godney served us a bop and deserves the 10

**lilguavachan** (10): is it cheesy? yes. is it dated as fuck? yes. do i love it though? absolutely.

**mudkip** (10): bop!

**pearllouise** (10): The OG queen of 2000s Christmas music. Your faves could never.

**radiofan15** (10): How could I give to the Princess herself (especially in the prime of her voice) anything lower than a 10? if certain other classic from certain skinny queen wasn't here this would be my 11... also you did dirty to this BOP in my Britney rate

**twat\_brained** (10): I really hope the playlist on Britney's Spotify was curated by her and not her team. Wishful thinking but this is such an underrated holiday tune! It deserves a lot more credit from the GP and from Britney herself. One of these years she will perform it live. I'm TYPING this into existence! And that key change? Holiday pop greatness. Hoping for top 3 but I'll settle for top 5. Popheads, that's my only wish this year. (from you guys at least) (well that and my "lock them up" rate idea is chosen)

**skargardin** (9): better than half of her discography

**Pugglemaster** (8.5): I wasn't expecting much but she delivered more than i thought

**CarlieScion** (8): Baby voice Britney :wig:

**jamesfog** (7.5): Basic bop

**vitriformfoil** (7): - its sounds like another Britney hit toned down and made for Christmas, and that's good for me

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I have no desire to hear this again, but it’s still Britney.

**selegend** (6): her voice doesnt really work with christmas songs

**notdallin** (4.9): Britney’s poor attempt at this Mariah mimicry is transparent and mediocre and that’s the tea

**gannade** (2.5): its festive enough but honestly britneys baby coo voice is really not doing it for me for xmas spirit

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this is kitschy garbage and it reminds me of Taylor Swift - Stay Stay Stay which i have already given a 0 in a rate.

Aly & AJ are huge bop makers, and this is no exception. Somehow they've been rated like 5 times, and are played dirty every rate. This is no exception. Although, the competition is pretty fierce in this rate so it makes sense. This song benefits from not having the overplay factor, and honestly is just a massive all around bop. Some people don't like the "Disney" sound to it, but this time of year is for family and what's more family than Disney?

---
**itsabop** (11): Underrated Disney era bop. It was hard deciding between this and Mariah for my 11, but since Mariah will probably take the crown, I'm balancing it out by giving my highest score to these queens.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): literally invented christmas

**1998tweety** (10): ok this is a huge bop

**ExtraEater** (10): great music video

**gannade** (10): MAJOR BOP!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): why does this sound like a phineas and ferb song

**vitriformfoil** (9): - i may be biased as i'm having an aly and aj phase now

**followingfreeways** (8): idk how ive never heard this but it was an appropriate bop.

**bigenemies** (6.6): - it’s cute, but definitely showing it’s age.

**notdallin** (6.5): Today on How to Make Your Own Paint-by-Numbers Holiday Anthem: just take random lines from other Christmas songs and sing them over a generic Disney Rock stock .mp3!

**CarlieScion** (5): I just can't get into their early stuff

I think the most offensive thing about this is that when you google jingle bell rock the glee version shows up first. A lot of you mentioned thinking of mean girls with this song, but honestly the movie I think of with this is home alone 2 when he goes swimming in the hotel pool and this plays. Also Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is the best holiday movie ever @ me idc if you disagree you're wrong

---
**gannade** (10): so festive

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FUCKING ICONIC IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD

**notdallin** (10): this song single-handedly took one of the most annoying Christmas songs (literally bar no cover) and transformed it into a suave, swanky bop where NO grammatical part of speech is safe from being jingled!

**strawberryswing1** (10): THE Christmas song

**jamesfog** (9.5): Mean Girls outsold

**1998tweety** (9): this is so so iconic

**radiofan15** (8.8): Quite annoying but at least it screams Christmas from the first notes so i'm not complaining... also the chorus is quite melodic and sort-of snaps so I can't complain

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): I remember my grandma had a dancing santa that sang this when I was a kid

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): goofy goober rock >

**callmetidle** (7): a bop

**letsallpoo** (7): i think the first time ive heard this outside of mean girls

**pearllouise** (7): Mean Girls did it better

**twat\_brained** (6.6): As a bisexual 20something it's impossible to listen to this without thinking about the Mean Girls talent show scene. I should learn the choreo to it. The REAL gem from this song is the legendary explicit parody of this. More importantly, it's only 2 minutes long! Doesn't overstay its welcome. Pretty alright if you ask me.

**mudkip** (6): mean girls is the only reason why this song is relevant

**vitriformfoil** (3): - another overplayed hit that's tiresome to hear

**tapdancingpig** (2): I hate this song so much. I think my inner child is still traumatized from expecting to hear “Jingle Bells” and hearing this shit instead. It’s basically the same song as Rockin Around the Christmas Tree, but at least there’s Mean Girls.

The opening big band part is honestly one of the most iconic openings in music and there's a reason the song has remained relevant every year since 1963

**ExtraEater** (10): when he says "tales of the glories of Christmases long long ago" i FEEL it

**gannade** (10): so festive

**jamesfog** (10): Iconic

**notdallin** (10): As SOON as you hear that big band fanfare you know EXACTLY what time of year it is. Is there a more synonymous song with the welcoming of the holiday season than this?

**strawberryswing1** (10): THE Christmas song

**tapdancingpig** (9): Just perfect nostalgia.

**JunkyGS** (8.3): says the word "gay". we decided to stan forever.

**bigenemies** (8): - A classic. When you hear this song, you know ’tis the season.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): it's ok but the Will Ferrel SNL sketch of this is forever iconic

**pearllouise** (8): I play this song whenever a mediocre rapper drops from the charts

**poppinmmolly** (8): a classic

**radiofan15** (8): As of this writing this is closer to the Top 10 in Billboard than it has ever being so Mariah better watch out because Andy is coming to steal her skinny crown

**TragicKingdom1** (8): gay happy meetings? more like popheads general discussions

**1998tweety** (7.5): I heard the word gay and was shook for a moment. This is ok but A&A literally just did it better so I've got to dock points.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): Of course you would be saying this, your descendants get an uptick in salary due to this being played EVERYWHERE. It's 55 years old and it's #13 on the goddamn Hot 100. Good key change, though.

This is genuinely one of the greatest holiday songs of all time. I know it's top 10, but you guys still did it dirty tbh. Everything about it is perfect, and while Mariah's version is also super iconic, you gotta give props to Darlene. It was originally made for Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes, but essentially Darlene did it better so they gave it to her.

---
**followingfreeways** (10): this song is truly one of the best christmas songs ever made, it's so good

**gannade** (10): one of the best christmas songs of all time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): :sad:

**JunkyGS** (10): watch 20 feet from stardom on Netflix to learn about this talent who got fucked over.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a great song

**notdallin** (9): it’s too bad this song is actually really really effing sad

**radiofan15** (9): I had years without listening to this BOP and the sax caught me by surprise... Allie X wished the sax in her botched cover of Last Christmas sounded as good as this song... or that her singing voice was something more than an annoying whisper... or that she was half as talented as Darlene or any other singer on this rate

**twat\_brained** (8.3): "A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector". Oh, good. Evidence with his fingerprints all over it, forensics can help us. Also, this first came out in 1963? Feels so much newer than that. Also pretty timeless, honestly.

**bigenemies** (8): - I love me some saxophone.

**1998tweety** (7.8): this was ok but kind of forgettable

**callmetidle** (7): Love this song but man does this show its age

**selegend** (6): oh iconic

**tapdancingpig** (5.5): I fuck with the 60’s girl group feel, but I wish there was a competent tune to go with it. “Christmas” is the only thing that sticks in the brain.

The king of Christmas is finally out. I'm not too sure why this is the most popular from the album, to be quite honest. The entire thing is perfection, so the fact this is the standout track is a little wild. However, his version of this song has literally no flaws, and Michael Buble in general is a God who will be respected at all times and anyone who ever shit talks him will be banned from the sub (@mods plz enforce this).

---
**1998tweety** (10): kingie

**bigenemies** (10): - Another perfect Christmas song. Michael Bublé has that comforting baritone voice that just puts you in the holiday MOOD.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): it's beginning to look a lot like my wig has gone missing

**notdallin** (10): Imagine doing for an already-established Christmas classic what Michael Buble has done for “It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas.” He completely usurped it and made his the quintessential cover, snugly settling in between Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole on every “classic” Christmas playlist created post-2011 and on.

**mudkip** (9.5): silk

**tapdancingpig** (9): Absolutely delightful.

**radiofan15** (8.9): King of modern Christmas bops with a smooth-as-butter voice and hot... ugh I have to stan

**itsabop** (8): His voice is so soothing

**jamesfog** (8): King of Xmas

**selegend** (8): his voice is sex tbh. like i feel anal penetration when i hear his voice. not even like 5 inches, a full 9 inches deep.

**pearllouise** (7): Out of retirement already?

**vitriformfoil** (7): - its my fav that's classical

**callmetidle** (6.9): I hate how boring Buble’s christmas stuff is, this is the one i can tolerate the most

**CarlieScion** (6): I don't know why, but Michael Bublè annoys the fuck out of me

**twat\_brained** (6): This holiday season, I've come to the realization Michael Bublé is the 21st-century answer to Frank Sinatra. I don't really go for much of his music, and this sadly isn't much of an exception. Easy listening is a bit too lulling for my standards. This is peak inoffensive holiday music, so it appeals to everyone. I guess it's better than outright unlistenable music.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): too jazzy for me and kinda tedious

**lilguavachan** (1): i don't really like michael buble at all, don't ask me why.

This song is so fun, but I'm a little shocked you guys rated it so highly? I'm not complaining, just more surprised. For those of you who only speak english, "Feliz Navidad, próspero año y felicidad" means "Merry Christmas, a prosperous year and happiness". The song basically repeats this directly after though and says it in english anyways. An all inclusive anthem we stan.

**twat\_brained** (0): I'm sorry but I've always found this tacky. Mariachi holiday is just not a genre that works, judging from this song. I wouldn't be opposed to artists like Becky G or Maluma making Latin holiday music, but I won't be listening if it's like this. I mean, the chorus repeats like what? 4 times? And the verse another 4? Not for me, thank you. You can't tell me this deserved to be rated over "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays" by *NSYNC.

I did not have enough faith in popheads to vote a song this iconic in. To double down, I did not have faith in popheads to rate an instrumental song well. You guys surprised me here. You did well.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**ExtraEater** (10): perfection

**strawberryswing1** (10): ugh howard schultz fucking snapped

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): my pussy is fucking popping

**notdallin** (9.8): Probably the least christmasy song on probably what is the best Christmas album of all time, but everything about A Charlie Brown Christmas is so iconic that I can’t not rate it extremely high

**bigenemies** (9): - Classic

**jamesfog** (9): Iconic

**tapdancingpig** (9): I feel awesome about including this song in the rate.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the most iconic instrumental we've rated since wall fuck

**shipsinker44** (8): the peanuts are a nice family memory to me so I will always stan

**twat\_brained** (7.4): Schroeder did not fucking come to play when he played this at the Christmas party.

**vitriformfoil** (6): - the best of the songs that I wouldn't put on my main Christmas playlist

**pearllouise** (5): I don’t see how this is a Christmas song, but go off

So I think this placement confirms that Brenda Lee is in fact a main pop girl. Like notdallin said, she recorded this when she was 13 and it has remained iconic ever since.

---
**notdallin** (11): ahem just so y’all know, GIRL WAS 13 YEARS OLD WHEN SHE RECORDED THIS SONG. And if that isn’t enough to earn your 11, behold the song itself! The iconic vocals, background singers, saxophone solo, home alone scene—this song has it all to be considered THEE ultimate Christmas staple for every December. And of course, you will get a sen-ti-men-tal feeling when you hear ᒄ₍⁽ˆ⁰ˆ⁾₎ᒃ♪♬

**1998tweety** (10): another extremely iconic bop

**ExtraEater** (10): oh yes this is it. feels like the perfect balance between the ease of christmas and the wild festivities. overblown or overboring cover versions of this be damned

**followingfreeways** (10): im going to give so many songs 10s omgg so many are just classic pure joyful christmas songs

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I can never think of this song in the same light since when I was a kid, I saw a news story online about how a Hannah Montana doll that sang this got in trouble cause some kids thought it said "Later we'll have some fuckin pie" and they started saying that and the parents' monocles all POPPED off.

**itsabop** (10): For Christmas music, this is usually in 2nd place behind Mariah on the charts. Deservedly so. What an iconic timeless bop.

**jamesfog** (10): Pop icon Brenda Lee

**radiofan15** (10): Damn she really snapped with vocals and festive atmosphere and sax... Allie X and her awful take on Last Christmas are shook

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): main pop girl

**bigenemies** (9): - She said it, you get a sentimental feeling.

**skargardin** (9): she snapped

**twat\_brained** (8.8): The question is, do we prefer Miley's version of this as Hannah Montana or the cover she did of this last year? I'm sorry, that's stupid. Miley at 25 is a much better and more mature singer than she was at 14. Oh, also, Brenda's OG rendition is cute too, I guess. More timeless than I give it credit for.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this captures such a mild form of boppage it's honestly so fascinating that i bump it up an extra point or two for it

**vitriformfoil** (7): - this is probably my fave classic that's actually classic

**callmetidle** (6): ehh, too backgroundy

**pearllouise** (6): [Hannah Montana did it better](https://youtu.be/ORrPdPZknN8)

**mudkip** (5): meh

**selegend** (3): she sounds terrible

**tapdancingpig** (0): It was between this and Jingle Bell Rock, but I think I hate this one a little more because the Mean Girls Dance doesn’t save this one.

Ariana Grande continually puts out terrible music, yet this song fucking BANGS. This is easily her best song, and there's a reason it won the Ariana Grande song survivor on plug that one time.

**strawberryswing1** (11): I'm sure this will be #2 or #3 with Mariah winning the big prize, but fuck you u/gannade and u/napsandnetflix, this song is incredible

**1998tweety** (10): this is a very good example of a great contemporary xmas song

**followingfreeways** (10): i just love everything about this song and the music video is seriously sooo adorable and i just . love

**itsabop** (10): Ari sleighed this one

**letsallpoo** (10): better than all of sweetener combined

**mudkip** (10): ugh quEEN tell me more

**Pugglemaster** (10): ICONIC

**selegend** (10): i might hate christmas but this is a bop

**skargardin** (10): a modern christmas classic tbh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): a modern classic

**TragicKingdom1** (10): an instant classic tbh, i would be shocked if this ends up forgotten

**twat\_brained** (9.5): No matter how many times I listen to this I can never seem to remember the verses or the pre-choruses. I definitely appreciate Ariana's D5 notes on this song, though. It's probably the closest thing we have to a modern-day AIWFCIY.

**bigenemies** (9): - Mini Mariah from the day she first whistled.

**CarlieScion** (9): Cute

**pearllouise** (9): And what about it?

**vitriformfoil** (9): - its great ok

**notdallin** (8.5): A modern take on “Last Christmas” I guess? Lovely, bouncy track but lowkey Ariana talking to Santa like he’s cupid that makes people fall in love and shiz… smh wrong mythical holiday figure girl plz

**jamesfog** (8): Cute

**gannade** (7.5): a major bop but aris enunciation on this is at her all time low. she literally said by the fire place as "buh da buh buh buh"

**ImADudeDuh** (7): amazing chorus but the verses are kinda meh on relisten

**radiofan15** (5.9): I never understood the hype around this song, it's quite generic and don't really feel that festive from a listening POV

A classic for a reason! This song absolutely deserves it's top 3 placement. There's a reason every pop girl has covered this song at some point in their life, it bops hard. Also I am screaming at the wiki page for this being soooooo long because it has to talk about all the covers

---
**original\_doll** (11): iconic classic, sentimental and a bop, my fave Christmas song ❤️

**1998tweety** (10): honestly i always preferred the version on Glee but this is good too

**bigenemies** (10): - It isn’t Christmas if this song doesn’t find a way into your ear canal. It’s inescapable, and rightfully so.

**followingfreeways** (10): it's really unfortunate all i want for christmas was in the rate because if it wasnt this song would win everything probably (if everyone has Taste) because this is the best classic christmas song Ever

**gannade** (10): all the covers of this song are tragic tbh. glee can ROT.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Pop girls stop covering this song challenge.

**itsabop** (10): So many covers of this one. Still, the version by Wham! remains the best.

**jamesfog** (10): A classic. Carly's version too

**letsallpoo** (10): blassic

**radiofan15** (10): Allie X did it better... jk her version is garbage as much as her music, but this is a classic

**selegend** (10): last christmas i gave you my cum, and the very next second you spat it away

**twat\_brained** (10): George was on "Do They Know It's Christmas" so he can't be that mad it didn't go #1. Now if I'm Andrew… THEN I might be somewhat displeased. Then again I'd have royalties from "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" and "Careless Whisper" mailed to me every week so I wouldn't be that mad. God rest your soul, George. And thank you for delivering us an everlasting Christmas gift.

**notdallin** (9.7): this song shouldn’t work. It shouldn’t be as huge as it is. It shouldn’t be a Christmas staple. I mean it’s not even about Christmas or the lore at all! Somehow it manages to thrive as one of the only solely romance-based Christmas songs in the hymnbook against all odds; tightrope walking the edge between 80s cheesiness and sappy balladeering with a wintry flair, transcending this funny anomaly into Christmas canon.

**callmetidle** (9): I think the lyrics are a bit behind the rest of the song, the boppiness overpowers them and i never feel sad in any way listening to this

**vitriformfoil** (9): - the over overplayed classic; also, the remastered album cover was a choice

**pearllouise** (8): George Michael died on Christmas two years ago. I guess that really was his last Christmas

**TragicKingdom1** (8): not to sound circlejerky but carly did it better

**tapdancingpig** (4): Yeah, I still don’t like this song. Sorry.

Fun fact: this was winning the rate the entire time until last night. I was fucking hyped to have an underdog win, and especially one as good as this. Underneath The Tree is what a Holiday classic should be, and it has the bonus of not getting overplayed to death that you're tired of it.

---
**callmetidle** (11): Look it’s a bop and everything about this exudes christmas joy. And what a fucking climax

**gannade** (11): Kelly did that

**selegend** (11): best christmas song in existence. period.

**vitriformfoil** (11): - issa bop

**1998tweety** (10): Kelly is a queen

**ExtraEater** (10): introduces Christmas like a giant parade

**followingfreeways** (10): one of the best christmas choruses imo

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song plays at work a lot and i always LOVE listening to it when it comes on, why isnt this a certified christmas classic yet?

**itsabop** (10): Her voice is so perfect for Christmas songs and this one has definitely made it to my regular yearly rotation. Wish her version of Grown Up Christmas List had made it to the final rate. Oh well!

**jamesfog** (10): The biggest Christmas classic since AIWFCIY

**lilguavachan** (10): she did that

**pearllouise** (10): A bop. Kelly is such a fantastic vocalist

**skargardin** (10): also a modern underrated classic

**strawberryswing1** (10): I wouldn't be mad at this winning, it's spectacular

**tapdancingpig** (10): Absolutely delightful bop. And I will take Kelly’s riffs over almost all current pop stars

**TragicKingdom1** (10): BIG bop that deserves to survive the brutal hands of time

**twat\_brained** (10): Modernized doo-wop done SO DAMN RIGHT! Meghan, TAKE NOTES. I should really check out the entire album. Alexa, save "Wrapped in Red" to my Spotify Library.

**notdallin** (8.7): I love the classic Phil Spector feel of this song. You know, I’ve been wondering… am I excluded from being what all these women want if I don’t fit under the tree? Smh yet another unrealistic body expectation

**bigenemies** (7.8): - It has all the makings of a great Christmas song… so much so that it doesn’t stand enough.

[A classic for a reason. I have nothing to say, we all knew this would win, but peep that average.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PzY8WHzobk)

**1998tweety** (11): iconic

**bigenemies** (11): - This song is winning, calling it. It intersects pop music and Christmas music so perfectly it’s the obvious /r/popheads Christmas song of choice.

**followingfreeways** (11): it's not christmas until youve gotten drunk and screamed all the wrong words to this song

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Iconic, mariah's peak

**jamesfog** (11): No words.

**pearllouise** (11): If this doesn’t win, Christmas is rigged

**Pugglemaster** (11): Honestly is there any other song on this list that compares to this? Well Leona's does but this song will never be beaten.

**radiofan15** (11): This one deserves to win, it's the closest thing to a eternal holiday classic as we have in ''current'' pop music... unless the Arianators come in droves and sabotages this because they don't know any better than being spoiled and entitled little brats

**skargardin** (11): The legend jumped out and all that, if this doesn't win I will finally have lost all faith in this sub.

**tapdancingpig** (11): One of the few redonkulously overplayed Christmas songs that I don’t hate already. It’s pure, snowy joy

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i really wanted to have a hot take on this one bc it would be onbrand(tm) for me but this really is just a flawless christmas and pop song in general

**twat\_brained** (11): I don't have to be a Lamb to give this my 11; no holiday song gets me in the Christmas spirit more than this one. In fact, this song is so ingrained into the Christmas pop culture mainframe, it's impossible to think about Christmas and not AIWFCIY. It's always a welcome delight to see it on the sharp end of music charts this time of year, and any other position other than #1 would be unwelcome for this rate.

**ExtraEater** (10): same as everyone else, of all the songs i could involuntarily hear more than eight times a day i'm real glad it was this one

**gannade** (10): a CLASSIC

**itsabop** (10): Queen of Christmas! I want to see this go number 1 on the Hot 100 so badly. #Mariahs19th

**mudkip** (10): stunning

**original\_doll** (10): obviously it's a ten! Queen of Christmas!!

**strawberryswing1** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7VKQMytX8M Annnnd you! and you! and you!

**tdc8557** (10): though Michael Buble's is also really good

**notdallin** (9.5): a modern Christmas classic. No doubt this is gonna win—a pop song for the ages that resurfaces in the top 100 every December since 1994? Maybe it should win.

**vitriformfoil** (9): - overplayed but still great

**CarlieScion** (7): Now, I really like this, but every day at work I hear this song, the extra festive version and the duet with Justin Bieber and now it kinda makes me want to puke

**selegend** (0): decent but annoyingly EVERYWHERE. EVERY FUCKIN WINTER.

DF44: Okay so I just saw this and y'all put fucking *Fairytale of New York* in 24th and the world's least festive piano mess that was actually painful to listen to the end of in #6?

Work I guess, but I'm calling bs the next time anyone here claims to have taste xD

(Also, not including SLADE? I mean yeah I would expect too much for Walking in the Air ~~even if y'all did include a much worse tv/movie song smh~~, but SLADE is iconic)
