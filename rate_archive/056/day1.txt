Some notes: Y'all really went out and wanted to rate an Amazon exclusive song. If you have Amazon Prime, you can [listen to it](https://imgur.com/Ej7wO08) on Amazon Music [here](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07KGJJCLJ?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_ew_tr_0_0_vscl&trackAsin=B07KGL2GH4) or buy it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Cozy-Little-Christmas-Amazon-Original/dp/B07KGL2GH4). If you're a cheap bitch like me, PM me and I can hook you up with less legal ways to listen to it.

[Here is the spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5y77IQ20ojgoFKjV5HTqMR) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=NapsAndNetflix&subject=Christmas%20Rate&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Holidays%0A%0AAly%20%26%20AJ%20-%20Greatest%20Time%20Of%20The%20Year%3A%0A%0AAndy%20Williams%20-%20It%27s%20The%20Most%20Wonderful%20Time%20Of%20The%20Year%3A%0A%0AAriana%20Grande%20-%20Santa%20Tell%20Me%3A%0A%0ABand%20Aid%20-%20Do%20They%20Know%20It%27s%20Christmas%3A%0A%0ABobby%20Helms%20-%20Jingle%20Bell%20Rock%3A%0A%0ABrenda%20Lee%20-%20Rockin%27%20Around%20The%20Christmas%20Tree%3A%0A%0ABritney%20Spears%20-%20My%20Only%20Wish%20%28This%20Year%29%3A%0A%0ACheetah%20Girls%20-%20Cheetah-licious%20Christmas%3A%0A%0ADarlene%20Love%20-%20Christmas%20%28Baby%20Please%20Come%20Home%29%3A%0A%0AJohn%20Lennon%20-%20Happy%20Xmas%20%28War%20Is%20Over%29%3A%0A%0AJose%20Feliciano%20-%20Feliz%20Navidad%3A%0A%0AJustin%20Bieber%20-%20Mistletoe%3A%0A%0AKaty%20Perry%20-%20Cozy%20Little%20Christmas%3A%0A%0AKelly%20Clarkson%20-%20Underneath%20The%20Tree%3A%0A%0AKelly%20Clarkson%20-%20Wrapped%20In%20Red%3A%0A%0ALady%20Gaga%20-%20Christmas%20Tree%3A%0A%0ALeona%20Lewis%20-%20One%20More%20Sleep%3A%0A%0AMariah%20Carey%20-%20All%20I%20Want%20For%20Christmas%20Is%20You%3A%0A%0AMichael%20Buble%20-%20It%27s%20Beginning%20To%20Look%20A%20Lot%20Like%20Christmas%3A%0A%0APaul%20McCartney%20-%20Wonderful%20Christmastime%3A%0A%0ASia%20-%20Santa%27s%20Coming%20For%20Us%3A%0A%0AThe%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York%3A%0A%0AThurl%20Ravenscroft%20-%20You%27re%20A%20Mean%20One%2C%20Mr.%20Grinch%3A%0A%0AVince%20Guaraldi%20Trio%20-%20Linus%20%26%20Lucy%3A%0A%0AWham%21%20-%20Last%20Christmas%3A%0A%0AEND) is the link to submit. You only have **ONE WEEK** to do this rate! So get to it! The reveal will be next Wednesday, December 19 during the afternoon. It's a weird time because I don't want it getting in the way of the kpop rate and I want it done before Christmas for obvious reasons. So get your submissions in by Tuesday, December 18!!!

Normal rate rules apply, add a number from 1-10 you would rate the song. You are allowed one zero and one 11 allowed per person, this is to signify what you think is the worst and best song, respectively. If you would like to add a comment, add it after the score. Example of a submission:

>Wham! - Last Christmas: 8 Carly did it better

Any other variation is incorrect and I reserve the right to get mad at you if you do it wrong.

NapsAndNetflix: A few other things of note. Honourable mention to the songs Last Christmas (Taylor Swift), Ribbons & Bows (Kacey Musgraves), and Christmas Sharks (Pinkfong) for being so close to getting in! Y'all really tried to get a meme childrens song in huh.

Some other wild submissions was Spongebob Squarepants, Bianca Ryan, Bob & Doug McKenzie, Boney M, Cee Lo Green, Fifth Harmony, Newsong, N*SYNC, and Train all getting more submissions than both Mariah Carey and Michael Buble
