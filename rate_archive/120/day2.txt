If I'm being honest I think a lot of my adoration for this song comes from the fucking stunning billboard performance, visually that is one of my favourite perfomances not just from the pandemic but honestly the last few years. It's *so* well styled and shot I could go on about it for hours and honestly, watch me in the reveal. This song actually lingered around Day 1 almost the entire rate so I'm glad it pulled through in the end, if not mostly because it meant I got to start the reveal with hey breonna...

# My video for Rina and Chloe and Halle for our Day 3

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Love the bouncy production for this song that kind of dissolves in the chorus for something a bit more lively, wonderful track

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m not a baby or a girl so I can’t relate but it’s a whole bop.

**Alumineous** (10): When I first heard this, I immediately thought, "This would be a sick track for a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon water dungeon." Or Strad from Minecraft Volume Beta.

**bespectacIed** (10): Only cxh will make a song with a trop pop beat in 2020 that I'll actually like

**conceptualromance** (10): The post chorus is just ????

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is leaving early and i’ve have not accepted it yet </3 it just feels like a lazy rainy sunday afternoon to me

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): This is such a sweet song both sonically and lyrically. I definitely appreciate it a lot as young woman who feels a lot of pressure and anxiety about the future.

**endcreditouilles** (10): the way they sing 'do it for the girrrrrllls all around the worrrrlllld' has me absolutely soaked

**ManofOranges** (10): I do hate the words "baby girl" one right after the other like that but for Chloe and Halle I will give it a pass.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is a great empowerment anthem, it's message feels really relatable and down to earth, not just a vague "inspire people, you can do anything blah blah". And the beat goes OFF

**ReallyCreative** (10): DO IT FOR THE GIRLS!!! ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I know everyone’s go to video for this song is that really beautiful billboard one, which deserved. But i often think about this version that they shared on their instagram that a group of black women created and organized via zoom, I dont listen to this song alot but I think the timing of this song coming out in a really noticeable time of just how undervalued and under protected black women as a whole was at the forefront. The cry of 'do it for the girls' just really resonates with me/

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): :ascending: the music alone conveys dread and hope at the same time, it sounds as therapeutic as the lyrics are. Chloe is such an amazing producer. I love her and Halle for writing a song of care and compassion for themselves, and dedicating it to anyone feeling the same.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): beautiful lyrics, beautiful voices, beautiful production. when they into that deeper range in the chorus UGH

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.5): going to do groceries while streaming this song during the pandemic, made me forget everything that was going around.Also don't be predictable and make a girl boss joke, this ain't future nostalgia

**wavingwolves** (9.3): love a song i don't need to turn off the feminist part of my brain to enjoy

**urfavgalpal** (9.2): a little more lowkey than some of the other tracks here.  I think it’s nice but it doesn’t get stuck in my head like the others

**bbfan132** (9): the live version of this is excellent

**ignitethephoenix** (9): As a girl I do appreciate this song a lot however I think it’s one of the weaker tracks on the album.

**Qustomar** (9): HEAVENLYYY

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): do it for the girl, do it for the girl, DO IT FOR THE CUTEST GIRL

**ktajlili** (8.5): can't tell if this is an eight or nine. This was an early favorite but I'm already getting tired of it. Still a bop though.

**seanderlust** (8.5): that hi baby girl video has caused that phrase to trigger my fight or flight response

**Vultuxe** (8.5): There is something missing from this song, and it's the chorus. It just doesn't hit as hard as I'd like it too. The rest is cute though.

**juanolsen** (8.3): the melody us really catchy and pleasant, i also like the concept of it

**afs** (8): Man their vocals are top notch. The snapping gets a bit annoying though.

**akanewasright** (8): This song is really nice to listen to, but I do generally consider it one of the weaker tracks on the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): You know Run the World? This is like, the legislative anthem of that reality.

**EnCaine** (8): love the production on this one

**engifear** (8): You heard it here first, "Do It" is for the girls

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): king if you play that fucking Brionna video and taint the good name of Chloe X Halle I s2g…

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): cXh just mopped with this song, they in fact did it for the girls

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Those drums are the best thing about this song, other than their voices of course. That post-chorus, though, ruins this song for me.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This is such a good ‘self love’ song. “Don’t you forget now, that little girl that you met now” is such a bar that I can forgive and forget any references to Casios

**Oberionsynth** (8): if I wasn't a Diet Man™ this song would def make me feel like an independent girl who don't need no man

**pig-serpent** (8): Some cool synths and rhythms, and the post-chorus really kicks the song up a notch, but even then I wish they made the end of the song go even harder.

**runaway3212** (8): this is just really really great, but it loses momentum towards the end

**salivantsonority** (8): The production is super interesting. Cute message.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): The production is my favorite part of this

**SupremeShani** (8): I consider this one of the weaker songs on Ungodly Hour, which just speaks volumes on how strong the album is. We stan an ambiguous feminist anthem.

**TiltControls** (8): hey baby girl

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): the hook is great

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Soooooo catchy and groovy. The lyrics are great, the production is immaculate and (like always lol) they knock the vocals out of the park

**waluigiest** (8): do it for her (that is to say you’ll do it for him)

**liberalitea** (7.5): this one is slower and a bit more one note but I still really like it. their vocals are so smooth !!

# My video for Carly and Charli for our Day 1

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): god they harmonize so well. Wish this had a little more oomph tho

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Closest thing to filler on this stacked album

**rickikardashian** (7.5): Hi baby girl hehe. Everything's okay, I promise. I forgive you. It's okay, don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be okay. I love you. I love you so much. I love you more than there are grains of sand, on every beach, of every planet, of every galaxy of the universe. I-I need you in my life. I need you more than humans need water, and food to survive. You mean more to me than - home depot means to Mr Ladrado. You mean more to me than just anything. You mean more to me than gold and diamonds, mean to the greediest burglar. And you're just the most perfect, most beautiful girl in all of the world, and I love you so much. I hope you enjoy watching this, baby girl kiss, hehe. See you at school tomorrow baby girl. I love you \*raises eyebrows*, hehe. I do, it's true. I love you more than anything else in the world hehehe. Bye baby girl. Stay perfect. Just for me.

**1998tweety** (7): cute, feels fillery tho

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I love the lyrics to this and especially the prechorus. I just think the post chorus sounds a little clunky.

**frogaranaman** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f_ec37PXNQ

**iniekcja\_** (7): this never really goes anywhere for me

**jaztinax** (7): a vibe although one of the weaker songs in here imo

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): One of the more forgettable tracks on this album, but still, beautiful harmonies from these two

**musical\_pyn** (7): the chorus isn't a strong as the rest of the song, but the harmonies are so smoooth

**throwaway7650** (7): the vocals are great but I'm not big on this song

**wasian-invasion** (7): is it just me or are there like owl hoots alternating between ears in my headphones? really distracting lol

**Stryxen** (6.8): this needs an uffie feature

**cashewconstellation** (6.7): kinda boring, i didn't really like it

**fadedblue09** (6): Filler already? Too early for that girls

**KennyEarthman** (6): Chloe produced this one. that's talent

=====

Awkward_King: **nooodisaster** (6): Not bad, just not a stand-out imo

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): not a favorite on the album. it's an ok song, but it regresses a bit back into their older sound which sometimes is just solange cosplay. i think they proved themselves to be past those impulses on the rest of the album, so this one falls flat for me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): CxH really put a song that rhymes “girl” with “world” between two of the best songs on the album huh...

**hakkerj** (5): I mostly skip this song

**Uberpigeon** (5): I'm sorry I just find this song really grating and repetitive

**jman457** (4.8): Doesnt do it for me if i'm being honest, really overstays its welcome

**nick1372** (4.5): vaguely feminist songs are my pet peeve I’m so sorry

**camerinian** (4): I like the spacy production but fucking yawn at these lyrics

I was so surprised to see this make Day 2, if for nothing else than the fact that it has "(Interlude)" in the title which is basically a death wish unless your name is Tina Taught Me. But I was very happy, one of my highlights on the album for sure. I do wish she had gone a little more into the briefly touched on theme of nihilism and disillusionment with society and the planet though, but the second verse will do!

---

# guys im sorry idk what the video im playing in beatsense rn is blame rina for making all her official uploads topic videos and thus blocked in random countries

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (11): I listen to this song when I’m mad at the world and it’s a wretched place. I listened to this song when I’m sad and everything. It’s very much a mood and I really like it.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I find it so difficult to find something bad to say about this track - perfect instrumental, Rina's voice is again just imbued with a beautiful mix of indignation, defiance, and of course self-defeat about the power and money hungry state of the world. Like girl, same, fuck this world. Also love the callbacks to Take Me As I Am and 10-20-40 in the outro.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Interludephobia will strike again but this is IT. A turning point in the album.

**Alumineous** (10): Interlude? Interlude.

**bespectacIed** (10): Wish this was a full song, so beautiful. Especially 1:50 onwards

**Oberionsynth** (10): why is this not a full song

**pat-rickstar** (10): I hate Rina for labelling this an interlude because that means it'll be robbed in this rate. The little snippets of RINA songs at the end is one of my favourite moments on the album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Nobody else does interludes like Rina, this, Through The Wire and Time Out are far too good for little interludes

**runaway3212** (10): bop!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this may be the first interlude that i thoroughly enjoyed, it is honestly a standout track in the album for me.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): even the interlude slaps. like??????? she sends me into orbit during the last verses here

**throwaway7650** (10): this will probably go out day 1 undeservingly. great lyrics, love the callbacks to the RINA EP

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): not her calling out elon like that ??

**artzpop** (9): could have easily been an entire song

**conceptualromance** (9): too short!!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): chloe x halle  rina: making interludes that shouldve been full songs

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): crying to this song when covid cases peaked in my state was my identity for a few months lol when are we building a mars colony to escape ppl on earth

**liberalitea** (9): so fucking good for an interlude.

**lolcevan** (9): i forgot how fucking good this song was when the bit near the end hit it made me levitate

**poptartchill** (9): Over time, this interlude has become one of my favorite songs by her

**Qustomar** (9): This and Time Out both could have been full songs honestly! But even as interludes, they are a lot more substantial than many recent 2-minute long singles so whatevers lol.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I actually adore this interlude, maybe it should have been developed into a whole song, but I love how it fits in sonically after Bad Friend.

**Stryxen** (9): the way that the (interlude) in the title cemented its fate for day 1 when it would otherwise be a DAE Fuck This World (album track) underrated??

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Point off for being an interlude, but it’s a great interlude

**Vultuxe** (9): This is an interlude? It's better than most of the songs I've heard so far. The production pops off.

**xaviersi** (9): I mean she has a point

**anothertown** (8.5): it evokes the Time Out interlude in a way which i love

**celladonn** (8.5): I can't give EVERY song on this album over a 9 so I guess I will be slightly interludephobic

**geraldinewww** (8.5): interlude but it's almost 3 minutes? girl

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): so true

**juanolsen** (8.5): i love the lyrics but I don't like the fact that it sounds so similar to the previous song

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Completely relatable after 2020, and the production is just sooo good.

**racloves** (8.5): when Rina does interludes better than your favs singles

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): There are two types of singers in the world. Those whose interludes are actually the shortest song on the album and earn the title “interlude” and those who are Halsey (but this is a rant for another rate)

**SupremeShani** (8.5): We appreciate a bop about our dissatisfaction with our society. Even if the message isn't anything special or offers any meaningful commentary, it does a good job of getting that feeling across. Someone compared the dreaminess in this song to Utada's work, and I can totally see it.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): We really oughta take better care of our planet.

**afs** (8): It may be an interlude, but it's a damn strong one, albeit a little repetitive.

**CarlieScion** (8): more interludes that are actually just songs thank u

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the way this interlude is longer than a lot of songs in this rate

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): "This is our mission impossible / May be unlovable / May be unstoppable / But it's worth trying" Queen of raising awareness for climate change so that we can have a better future for ourselves.

**ManofOranges** (8): Everyday I wake up and this is what I think to myself.

**notarobot3675** (8): this interlude is better than a lot of artists proper songs lol

**rickikardashian** (8): fuck this gay earth

**skargardin** (8): really stretching the definition of interlude here aren't we

**SmileAndTears** (8): Sis really just called a full ass song an interlude lol

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I bet if this song didn't have the word interlude in its title, its average would be quite a bit higher.

**urfavgalpal** (8): great interlude that work on its own as a song.  Love how it bridges the transition from the very depressing bad friend into the fucking absolutely killing who’s gonna save u now

**vayyiqra** (8): [comment about how this is too long to be an interlude]

**waluigiest** (8): ok Elon musk

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): Love the call back to the Rina EP songs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.9): very nice RINA EP vibes

**ggal2020** (7.8): another song I sing to myself any time something bad happens

**bbfan132** (7.5): the outro <3 <3 stream rina

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The songwriting is really immature and clunky but her emotion sells this for me.

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): I know I wrote for “Overwhelmed” that I can only rate interludes sooo high, but like, this is such a good interlude lmao! Also it’s almost 3 mins, that’s basically a full fledged song!

**jasannn** (7.5): This interlude is more fleshed out than over half of position most of these short songs that everyone is putting out these days.

**Palutzel** (7.5): even the interlude rocks

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Placement is a little weird. Kinda groovy but not that much of a standout.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): She's got a point

**TiltControls** (7.5): me when chosen family ends up bottom 5

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): kinda in a weird limbo between actual interlude and full song

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute i suppose

**engifear** (7): I wonder if this song is gonna flop just because it has "Interlude" in the title

**J\_Toe** (7): this interlude is actually one of the best tracks on the album

**KennyEarthman** (7): I wonder why it's an interlude cuz it sounds like a full song to me

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): We interrupt this album for a brief message from our sponsor: people who hate this stupid planet

**musical\_pyn** (7): definitely an interlude unfortunately because this is great

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i love how this is an interlude but longer than 80% of songs coming out atm

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): aww come on Rina… this is the moment where you finally delve deep into the anti-capitalist themes of SAWAYAMA and you only delegate it to an interlude? At least it’s not that short

Awkward_King: # a list of interludephobes / climate change deniers you choose which

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this sounds nice but its so much more forgettable than most of the album

**nick1372** (6.5): this interlude is 28 seconds longer than montero (call me by your name)

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): this is the least interludy interlude ever

**jman457** (6.1): I like how this “interlude” is longer than a lot of the songs on Charli’s album. That being said it could be a minute shorter

**EnCaine** (6): yes it's getting +1 for the 15 seconds of RINA EP songs at the end

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Sometimes… things that are interludephobia… are correct

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Mixed feelings, but in a positive way.

**just\_thonking** (6): not very memorable at all

**NotWith10000Men** (6): the album is kinda lulling here

**wavingwolves** (6): i mean she spilled actually

**camerinian** (5): I'm glad Rina labelled this an interlude so that I can not feel bad about not really digging this one too much

**frogaranaman** (5): interludephobia

**pig-serpent** (5): How is this an interlude, or is that tag there just to warn us to lower our expectations?

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): "just rating every interlude a 5 because it feels uncomfortable to rate them" - junkyGS, patron saint of interludephobia. jokes aside, i don't know why this is here. it's okay, but we gotta learn when to turn things into bonus tracks.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Not the worst song on the album coming immediately after the best.

**oscarbrierley1** (4): looong for an "interlude" doesn't really do much

**Raxxin** (3): solid skip

Okay yes the memes of Carly saying the f slur at the beginning of this send, but I really love the song too. We *really* need to do away with the whole aBolIsH sHoRt SoNgS thing, not every song has to be exactly three minutes and thirty seconds and that is okay. Some songs, like this, and Bees & Honey, benefit from being shorter and not overstaying their welcome at risk of being repetitive. This is the perfect bite-sized bop, and perfect to replay!

# Comments to do with [spawning](https://assets.sainsburys-groceries.co.uk/gol/7656442/1/640x640.jpg)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): He was born in Vegas

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Unspawn me.

**endcreditouilles** (10): spotting WHO???? Carly knows her audience, good for her

**KennyEarthman** (10): I thought she said the f-word in the opening

**Leixander** (10): Stop spawnkilling us Carly

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): although it sounds like she's saying spotted 'f-words' in the first line and i cannot hear past that. ok her and ari need to go to the same training for just saying the word 'vegas' with extra emPHAsis on the correct syllABLE.

**rosecoloreds** (10): for calling me a slur in the beginning

**runaway3212** (10): the f slur is 'fake mona lisa'

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the intro have the same energy as ariana saying vegas let me hear you make some noise

**welcometoNY** (10): literally a crime for this to be so short. also something something spawning *******

**buddhacharm** (9.5): SPRAWLING FLAGGOTS

**nootnoot781** (9.5): carly! ?? you can’t say that word!!

**racloves** (9.5): I just love this song, it’s just fun. Maybe it’s cause she definitely says a different word at the start lmao

**pheromenos** (9.3): born in vegas let me hear y'all make some noise

**1998tweety** (9): spotting f@ggots

**EnCaine** (9): i haven't listened to this since it came out and i got tricked by the opening lyric AGAIN AAAAA

**just\_thonking** (9): the first line will never not sound like "spawning f****ts"

**mudkip1** (9): spawning f*ggots

**seanderlust** (9): ...???...OHH she said Vegas. got it.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Carly can say it it’s ok

**SupremeShani** (9): Let's get this out of the way, she absolutely said the word, sorry, I don't take criticism. Seriously though, I strangely really love this song for some reason upon re-listening to it. I don't know if it's a warped guitar line or some distorted synth, but the instrumental intrigues me, and the way the pace switches up between the verses and chorus is fun.

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): queen of spawning gays

**vagenda** (8.7): I know Carly doesn’t actually say the F-word in this…….but she could

**juanolsen** (8.6): i love to hear Carly calling me f@ggot

**celladonn** (8.5): How many comments are going to be about that misheard first line

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUjMo0ZXkAEsQ-D.jpg

**hikkaru** (8.5): spawning f-----s

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "spawning f****ts" You know what, she has a point.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): I love this track to bits, but I don't know how not a single person on her team didn't think "Born in Vegas" sounded like something else...

**liberalitea** (8): omg i thought she said the f word when the song started and i was like damn that's bold considering your fanbase. anyways underrated bop

**nick1372** (8): I know every other person here is gonna make a spawing f****** joke but I hear it every single goddamn time

**rickikardashian** (8): pop girls are saying “vegas” like that on purpose now, you cant convince me otherwise

**salivantsonority** (8): Qual qual qual.

**skargardin** (8): You can't convince me that she does not say the f slur in the first line

**thedoctordances1940** (8): spawning what now miss carly?

**Uberpigeon** (8): did she just say the f slur?? this is cute though i like the little sounds

**Palutzel** (7.9): "spawning fa***ts"

**bbfan132** (7.5): spawning what now….

**engifear** (7.5): Haha Carly said the f slur

**fairytalehigh** (7.2): how many [REDACTED] can you spot spotting "spotting [REDACTED]"

**NecroDolphinn** (7.2): The opening line is very easy to confuse for something alot worse than it is and also I wish this song was longer

**akanewasright** (7): When I ban Carly from phcj OMG

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what did she call me

**geraldinewww** (7): still cannot unhear her saying a slur as the second word of the song. carly...

**wasian-invasion** (7): idk what these lyrics mean and im too tired to try to understand

**plastichaxan** (6.8): inb4 everyone misheard vegas for… y'know

**Oberionsynth** (6): I need to get my hearing checked bc i definitely thought carly casually dropped the f slur at the start of this fdjsfiosdjofisj "v*gas, let me hear y'all make some noise!"

**shhhneak** (6): “Spawning ??” is what this rate is currently doing.

**wavingwolves** (5.4): this one will spark some ppl's humiliation kink i think

**bespectacIed** (2): Petition to ban pop girls from saying the word Vegas

# comments not about carly saying a slur

**Vultuxe** (11): The production and melody here are strikingly polished. It's addicting. An immediate standout on this record and dare I say her discography.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the way this is the best song on DSB and its basically an interlude i hate it here

**targetguest** (10): huge contender for my 11. it's amazing. lost out because of the length

**welcome2thejam** (10): Redd can't keep getting away with this! But yeah, love the slinky and sexy vibe it's putting out, don't know if I love the short runtime but at least it makes hitting replay a lot less painless.

**zagreux** (10): horny carly is the best carly

**cashewconstellation** (9.8): i am taking some points out cause CARLY DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE THIS SONG TWO MINUTES LONG

**kirby31200** (9.5): The worst thing about this song is that there isn't more of it

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): THE ONLY REASON THIS ISN'T A 10 IS BECAUSE IT IS SOMEHOW SHORTER THAN MY DICK

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): true ARTPOP

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): cute

**Alumineous** (9): Carly Rae, this is TOO DAMN SHORT.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh Carly is freaky I see. This feels like a deep-cut from EMOTION repurposed to fit for Dedicated. I love this.

**pat-rickstar** (9): Too short, that’s my only issue with this

**ReallyCreative** (9): My working theory is that this song is underdeveloped because it was supposed to have a feature of some kind. I still thoroughly enjoy it, but it is flawed due to its length and feeling of missing something.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Needs to be longer

**urfavgalpal** (8.7): god I love to sing this song.  It’s got some quirkiness to it that I really dig

**camerinian** (8.5): the smoothness of the lyrics are so undercut by this awkward ass production but I'm kinda digging the contradiction

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): one of my favorites on the album for sure

**jasannn** (8.5): This song has so much potential and would've been amazing if it had a bridge but it sounds great within in its short run time.

**afs** (8): This track would fit right into E•MO•TION, which is a very good thing. But what's with the early end? Would have gotten 9 otherwise.

**frogaranaman** (8): that synth is so cute

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): Would be higher if not too short! Just a bop-tease

**musical\_pyn** (8): really great but just too short for me to fully get invested

**jman457** (7.8): I really like the production and vibe of this song

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Don't know how to swim but let's breathe underwater, it's so clever and mind-blowing how she hints on this specific lyric and in other moments on other tracks what is going to happen on the final track. Her mind!

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): why are the bops hidden so deep in the album???

**bookthieving** (7): mona lisa, the original basic bitch

**throwaway7650** (7): that thing going on in the instrumental is kind of annoying

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): criminally short. solid track given its length

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I love the verses on this one but much like a few other songs from the collective Dedicated era, the chorus is just kinda weak. Still bops but not as much as it could have

**waluigiest** (7): okay the material is there!! But why didn’t she finish the song???

Awkward_King: **sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): it was good but not great

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You know after a while, all these vaguely funky pop tracks just kinda blend into each other...

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): maybe this song got overhyped for me but nothing about this stood out imo

**ImADudeDuh** (5): idk why people said this was their fave when the album dropped

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): Well…at least Carly has the best song titles out of everyone, so that’s gotta count for something right?

**lagozzino** (5): I refuse to believe this is a finished song. This is a demo they gave up on during development. It feels wrong to be rating it against fully realized songs.

**ManofOranges** (5): All this song makes me think about is this photoshopped picture I have saved of the Mona Lisa where she's smiling and has her feet up.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I like the production on this but the melody isn't super compelling.

**pig-serpent** (4): The doinky guitar/synth line is a good touch, but it's hard to ignore that this feels like the 5th time this song has appeared on this album.

**TiltControls** (4): I regularly forget this is a song on the album

**fadedblue09** (1): WTF ARE THOSE RUBBING NOISES? To anyone who thinks this is worthy of being an A-side, check your ears please

**bulforster** (0): I was so confused when people were calling this their favourite on release day, it's easily the most annoying song Carly's ever released.

# im screaming

**SideBTrack8** (7): I hope people know my name is for Roses and not this

Another song that made very little impression of me before the rate but significantly grew on me as I heard it more. This really is a lvoely carefree bop. While I think it is slightly upstaged by other power pop songs on the record like TLIC, Stay Away and Summer Love, it is very cute for what it is! Solo/So low is also far from original but Carly makes me not care in the slightest

---

# Happy being solo

**CritneySpearz** (11): queen of giving the single gays bops, who needs a man when you can just listen to Solo ??

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The continuation of Party For One

**bespectacIed** (10): life-affirming

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She and Jason Derulo should collab.

**bulforster** (10): The bop Stay Away thinks it is.

**camerinian** (10): I need to be honest, I think this is the only song on Side B that really stands up with the best of Dedicated. The massive life-affirming chorus is so godly

**CarlieScion** (10): in the verses Carly sings about the «you»-character breaking up with someone with «he»-pronouns, while the chorus she sings «she moved on». This makes Solo a bisexual anthem and in this essay I will…

**CrimsonROSET** (10): THANK YOU! So many songs about people being sad they’re not in relationships, and they seem to just not understand that people can still be happy and single? Like that’s so much energy based on someone else, go enjoy your time! Go enjoy you, dammit!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): 322

**fenellabeach** (10): pop perfection, finally, thank you Carly

**liberalitea** (10): this song is so euphoric

**mudkip1** (10): WHY IS THIS WHOLE ALBUM GREAT

**musical\_pyn** (10): I will always stan a so low/solo rhyme

**nick1372** (10): this one took a while to sink in for me but I think it’s actually better than Party for One. Carly is the only person on the planet allowed to rhyme “solo” with “so low” by the way.

**nootnoot781** (10): SO WHAT YOU’RE NOT IN LOVE. i love a day 3 CRJ song. this is day 3 right? …right?

**runaway3212** (10): An incredible bop

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is my favorite song on the album and it may or may not be because I have been solo for at least a year at this point

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just so. fucking. good.

**TiltControls** (10): another fun bop!

**vagenda** (10): Rhyming “so low” with “solo”, do wonders never cease

**zagreux** (10): carly saying "you'll be alright" gives me so much serotonin aah

**1998tweety** (9.5): mega bop

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): so what, you're not in love? you shine bright by yourself dancing, homo ??

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): now this is DANCEABLE

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): a song for the singletons

**shhhneak** (9.2): SO WHAT YOU’RE NOT IN LOVE

**bbfan132** (9): super infectious, enjoyed this a lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If this album had come out while *Glee* was still airing they could have used this song after a Finchel breakup and reframed it as being about Rachel pushing through her sadness by getting more solos in Glee Club.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): She rhymes "so low" with "solo". One might say this is uninspiring, but I think it is brilliant!

**jasannn** (9): I don't know if it just because I've been single for so long but this hits hard.

**just\_thonking** (9): I know it's generic but it's also so comforting, and the fact that she added it to the album last minute because she knew people were isolated is just so <3

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Side B here really ramps up here at the end, and this bop is everything I want from Carly. It's not memorable in that I don't think of it, but then I play it and go "oh right that's the song that's sometimes in my dead"

**salivantsonority** (9): I wanna dance with someone cute to this song. I love the invocation of her higher register. Super fun.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Why do I genuinely not remember this song it’s a bop

**SupremeShani** (9): Giving this a high score purely on the fact that I am lonely and pretend Carly is personally singing this to me.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): carly: being single is okay not all of us can get sumn!

**juanolsen** (8.7): another great song to add to the list of songs named solo

**Palutzel** (8.7): SINGLE BOP

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): this song is so fun. I don’t even have much to say about it but I like it a whole lot

**cashewconstellation** (8.4): see i usually slander this song, most commonly calling it a PG-13 Party For One but it's actually kinda hitting

**urfavgalpal** (8.4): This is like Party for One Part 2 and I really like it!  I have to say one thing I think Carly and her producers did well this album is capturing you from the first notes and this is one of those songs that does that.  I really like when Carly does songs that don’t center romantic love.  I mean those are all great but it’s nice to have a change of pace sometimes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.1): Party for one, you dance by your phone, it don't have to be lonely being alone

**Alumineous** (8): The chorus kinda brought the song down for me. Also, her vocals at the end! Color me shocked.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Jennie is shaking. Bichi naneun solo.

**frogaranaman** (8): the final chorus lawddddddd

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): ok this song just itches my brain

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Okay I can get into this – I truly don’t dislike this album (even if my other ratings beg to differ) but this really is just a collection of poppy songs instead a cohesive project, so it kind of feels like I’m just giving brownie points to CRJ when a song actually stands out to me in this jumbled compilation.

**pig-serpent** (8): The drop is pretty cool and I like the bells riff in the verses.

**Roxieloxie** (8): ,7 Listening to this song while being in the middle of a deep sadness episode sure is something, i can tell you that

**SmileAndTears** (8): This song used to be my shit but idk, it got old really fast. But then again this is really hitting hard atm so idk I'm kinda torn

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): what a fun bop, those ad libs at the ed

**welcome2thejam** (8): Solo / So low? Poetic Cinema.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): she’s cute

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): this high notes in the back were freaking perfection

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): ok… this is pretty boppy

# these scores are so low

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Not a bad one but definitely one of the songs in the tracklist that just smells like a leftover from Dedicated.

**conceptualromance** (7.5): kinda forgettable

**hikkaru** (7.5): this kinda sounds like an edm collab but it does bop a bit

**throwaway7650** (7.5): another song saved by the chorus

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): she just spent all this album talking about being in love and now she's like oh boohoo stop crying about being forever alone youre harshing my mellow

**afs** (7): And now she tackles house! Don't like those strange sounds post chorus but at least it's not like Windows.

**cremeebrulee** (7): its fine but the other “dont be sad about being single ur so sexy haha xx” song in this rate outsold

**waluigiest** (7): if I see one of the men who broke carly’s heart..... it’s on sight julien or whoever tf

**jman457** (6.9): Its pure blissful pop, but im not gonna act like there a million pop songs that sound just like it

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Anthem to wine moms everywhere

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): I feel like I say this for at least one song per rate, but it sounds like a eurovision song

**engifear** (6): The production is a bit cheesy sometimes, but it's still a fun song.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): sure

**J\_Toe** (6): was expecting something along the lines of Solo by Frank Ocean

**ManofOranges** (6): How many songs about masturbation is Carly gonna make?

**NotWith10000Men** (6): is this album over yet

**Oberionsynth** (6): can people stop trying to convince me that it's ok to be alone, pls i just want some d*ck stop making me feel like it's some kind of self hate

**poptartchill** (6): the "solo" wordplay is fun but generally I'm not super into this one

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Similar lyrical content as Party For One but not as good imo. Feels a little dated actually? And not in the good retro way her songs usually do

**Vultuxe** (6): The production is off, but the hook is catchy. Probably the only real filler on here.

**Stryxen** (5.8): ok and

**anothertown** (5): got me plannin to go… solo...

**KennyEarthman** (5): Jennie outsold

Awkward_King: **welcometoNY** (5): she's cute, but the production feels very plastic at times

**sirpancakeXI** (4): this is so lackluster

**akanewasright** (3): A lot of people like this song a lot... I mean, it’s cute I guess?

**Uberpigeon** (3): no...no.....no... i dont know how to describe them other than "generic synthpop sounds" but theyre all over this song and I cant stand it anymore

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): it is annoying and the other song I was strongly considering giving a 0. What is even that screaming at the end

**fadedblue09** (2): This is the closest thing to a WYIMR on this album, and that alone justifies this score.

It's no Run Away With Me, but I don't think anyone is expecting Carly to top a song like that. And if you are, maybe lower your expectations. This is just a lovely piece of classic euphoric pop fun! And it's what Carly does best, and she doesn't pretend it is anything more than that and that lane she has carved is perfect for her. But Carly, please, why is this the only video for the era. You're killing me out here I have nothing to play in BeatSense.

# gay

**shhhneak** (11): Burning my 11 on this praying it gets to day 3. This is just classic CRJ boppery. It may actually be one of her best songs? Not even surprised she buried this gem on a b-side.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Carly will never not make insanely memorable openers.

**Alumineous** (10): Fuck it, I'm giving it a 10. I gave it a 6 initially because I wasn't getting the childish vocals. Like, I would give both When I Needed You a 0 with zero regrets. But the song grew on me. If that is her vocals in the beginning... I am shocked. The chorus just makes you want to scream it from your... window.

**hikkaru** (10): idc if it's the now that i found you of side b it bops and it bops more than anything else on this project

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This love isn't crazy, but THIS SONG IS INSANE! It's one of my top 5 songs of last year and my favorite Carly song ever (sorry Gimmie Love).

**iniekcja\_** (10): this song absolutely is crazy though

**ManofOranges** (10): She's an icon, she's got a point, and she is the moment, now cmon now.

**mudkip1** (10): maybe her best song ever???? a concept

**nick1372** (10): Carly remakes Run Away With Me and what, I’m supposed to not give it a 10?

**nooodisaster** (10): The fastest I've ever fallen in love with a song; literally by second 2 I knew this was 10/10 and it still is today. My favorite song on either Dedicated. This is sonic euphoria crafted from the hands of two literal music geniuses, and deserves everything in this world. Almost got my 11.

**pros-and-connors** (10): if you don’t like this song you hate love

**savemeaseat143** (10): hopeful love bop

**skargardin** (10): what a slapper

**slimboyfriend** (10): This song is the second coming of Run Away With Me and I don't understand why nobody else is paying attention to this

**throwaway7650** (10): my favorite on this album! hope it makes day 3

**TiltControls** (10): the most fun I've had listening to a carly song in a long time (and I love Carly)

**vagenda** (10): MY song of the summer 2020

**urfavgalpal** (9.9): Someone on popheads when the album came out said this was comparable to Run Away with Me and I remember when I first listened to the album thinking that person was dead wrong but actually I really agree with that.  It’s definitely a grower in my opinion but this has great lyrics, a great melody, and makes you feel.  I sing this song to my dog a lot which is a sign that it’s become One of My Favorites.  I don’t think she likes it but I don’t think that’s Carly’s fault.

**Dekubaku** (9.3): This love may not be crazy but the song is sure crazily fun!

**wavingwolves** (9.3): the millennial whoo whoo

**artzpop** (9.2): This song has such a spring feeling and the start is so euphoric I love it, always puts me in a good mood

**1998tweety** (9): big bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Kind of a formula we have heard at this point but hard not to love this track for all blissful and climactic and kind of powerful it is.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): lol I remember a snippet of this being posted by Carly in like... early 2018 I think (definitely well before Party For One) and I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard (it was just the hook). In reality it's really good but not the show stopper I thought it'd be

**just\_thonking** (9): Honestly I was underwhelmed by it on first listen but I quickly realized how this song is just pure joy

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): This is the most Emotion-sounding bop of the entire Dedicated extended universe

**liberalitea** (9): I love this song, it's so bright and fun

**pat-rickstar** (9): This is better than I remembered

**pig-serpent** (9): Great summer jam that feels like bliss, and has a nice smattering of synthwave elements that are used in a unique way too!

**salivantsonority** (9): Just a joyous, summery track. I want to go rollerskating to this song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this song feels like it belongs on the final dancing scene/credits of The Princess Diaries

**vayyiqra** (9): Peak Carly vibes, a very cute opener.

**fenellabeach** (8.9): gave me overly high hopes for this album

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): that tropical house production is entirely too musty for this song to work as well as it does. those "ooh ooh"s ??

**notarobot3675** (8.8): such a fun opener

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): What a way to open this album. I need to hear more CRJ x Jack Antonoff collabs.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): such a great intro track to Side B and i love the vocal production on this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Loveeee Carly’s Robyn era. Continues Carly’s excellent track record of delivering immaculate opening tracks

**Vromega** (8.5): She's kinda forcing her voice here but I really like the instrumentation, the different sonorities slowly coming one by one to invite us to her album. A good entrance to this album.

**jman457** (8.4): Sure she isnt re-inventing the wheel with her music here, but its a fun synth pop album so what can you ask more from miss Carly

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): easily the weakest of Carly's "anthems" but it's still fun and cute

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): camilia talking to shawn when they left that sushi shop:

**afs** (8): This track is so happy I feel there's some sort of drug involved. But it's a good one!

**bbfan132** (8): some of the production choices were misses for me but i still enjoyed this quite a bit

**CarlieScion** (8): baby!!!!!! We could believe that!!!!!

**cashewconstellation** (8): this song grew on me during the past year, i like it, it's fun!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the backing vocals are a bit iffy but i love everything else

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Ahh this one is going on the summer playlist. If it’s one thing Carly’s gonna do, it’s make carefree tunes

**juanolsen** (8): cute bop to open the album with

**Oberionsynth** (8): carly's a little too bubbly for me sometimes (also me being a kpop girl group stan, make it make sense), but this song is a WHOLE bop, like i feel so happy just hearing it

**runaway3212** (8): I did an writeup for the popheads top 100 for this song, but after that I realized I actually don't love this song that much

**targetguest** (8): I don't have the same love for this song that everyone else does, but a bop regardless

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): this and comeback is really the only decent scraps we have here huh

**waluigiest** (8): it’s cute and I like her little whoops

**wasian-invasion** (8): decent opener but the hook is kinda awkward. This love isn't crazy? ok cool what is it then

**bulforster** (7.9): It's our right to tank this album.

**hakkerj** (7.5): The vocals OKAY

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this does bop but her vocals are annoying on here at points

**Palutzel** (7.5): not crazy about this one

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): it's ok

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's a really good song but ever so slightly annoying, this doesn't feel like a song I'd want to listen to on repeat.

**akanewasright** (7): Cute opener, but like... not one of her best or anything

**anothertown** (7): we love Kiss (2012) castoffs here

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): her voice is bright and full and fun.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is the “Party For One” of the album… like it’s not offensive or anything but it didn’t need to be the first thing that I heard from this release.

**poptartchill** (7): not SUPER crazy (ha) about the middle but overall it's pretty good

**rosecoloreds** (7): i'm not that crazy about this song but i'll let it play in the background while i clean my room

**SupremeShani** (7): An acceptable pop song, which perfectly represents what Dedicated Side B is about. There's peaks and dips in the production, it comes with that signature candid sweetness that Carly has mastered, but it rarely amounts to anything special.

Awkward_King: # slightly less gay but still probably gay

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): this song just sounds like a broadway song in some cheesy “we can get past this” part??

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): has fun moments but I'm not obsessed

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I wanted to like this intro, the verses and production are really cute. But, the chorus and high pitched vocalization are... kind of annoying. Plus I feel her voice is layered with this tinny vocal effect which lessens the quality of the song to me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is catchy and fun but doesn't hold up super well to multiple listens.

**conceptualromance** (6): The bridge is nice, but other than that, there’s just not a lot here that’s interesting to me.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Someone take anything remotely synth away from Jack and let him only produce the more acoustic stuff.

**frogaranaman** (6): that opening synth is annoying as hell but it is a good song otherwise

**jasannn** (6): Jack Antonoff has done better.

**KennyEarthman** (6): would play in a trailer for a dreamworks animated movie

**musical\_pyn** (6): I like it, but the opening is the same as small talk by katy perry

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it's cute. I feel like this is all I'm gonna be saying for most of this album

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is definitely a Carly Rae Jepsen song

**bespectacIed** (5): it's giving Kiss era

**Qustomar** (5): Sounds like a machine learning-generated CRJ song.

**jayjaysortagay** (4): cheap and dated

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I know some people love this but I've always found the vocal layering here to be super awful

**EnCaine** (3): this song always reminds me of the music my church's band used to play when i was a kid. i went to one of those "cool" churches where they would play "rock" music instead of the traditional stuff and i can't stomach this song because of it. I'm so sorry carly.

**izeaklapaucius** (0): bro she really opens this album with a fucking zero bait omfg

**RandomHypnotica** (0): What an absolutely boring song. This is probably my least favourite song in Carly's entire discography, even below Cut to the Feeling. It feels so soulless, empty and has absolutely nothing that grabs me. I've listened to it around 10 times, and I still couldn't tell you a single thing about the track, it just passes through one ear and straight out the other.

I replayed the fuck out of this when it came out and kinda forgot about it since, but it is still a bop I think? The mixing isn't like *noticeably* bad to me, whereas I think it completely turned a lot of people off hahaha. The "you're sort of a dick but, someone out there is surely gonna love a dick" is pure Carly camp.

---

# is surely gonna love a dick

**Alumineous** (10): Carly Rae, this is what I'm talking about. This is amazing.

**bespectacIed** (10): "This was camp" is the most overused phrase ever, but this was camp

**KennyEarthman** (10): I ugly laughed at the bridge lmao

**ManofOranges** (10): Thought it was a let-down at first but I've slowly come around on it.

**moooo566** (10): i'd say like 50% of the time my real 11 is in the bonus. it's this one.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i know i personally said this sounds like an ashlee simpson song but that isn't shade. it's a good thing. ashlee come back we miss u even if your name is spelled wrong

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is way better than it has any right to be, it's just really fun and cute, like all Carly songs should be

**Raxxin** (10): she needs to release a full album like this we need evil spiteful carly

**shesdoingyoga** (10): If there is an audiobook of the dictionary, this would be the example under the definition of “camp”

**targetguest** (10): literally so mad this was one of the first songs eliminated by the crj subreddit it's one of my tops of 2020

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a 10 for the spoken bridge alone

**vayyiqra** (10): wtf I love this

**waluigiest** (10): this made me so sassy for like a month

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): this is fun

**amiriteor** (9): idk its just a nine she has her lil sassy deep voice going

**hakkerj** (9): She was in her bag with this song

**liberalitea** (9): this is such an interesting sound from Carly and I don't know exactly how to feel, but I think I like it

**pros-and-connors** (9): a ghosting anthem! ??

**seanderlust** (9): look, I get that this is about an ex, but this is like...the process of making friends in seattle lol

**hikkaru** (8.5): kinda horrible mixing or whatever but it does bop a lil

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): lord this reminded me that by the time the reveal happens there will finally have been some drama in my friend circle and I live

**jman457** (8.5): love the sarcastic love song

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I really like this song, sorry

**SupremeShani** (8.5): the productions choices and clipping are definitely intentional, you all need to stop disrespecting our indie queen carly rae jepsen

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): "You're kind of a dick"

**AHSWeeknd** (8): “You smiling, like a devil” is the same as “he looks up, grinning like a devil”

**poptartchill** (8): I was super into this song when it came out and it's still a bop

**TragicKingdom1** (8): underrated despite her recording underwater

**welcome2thejam** (8): Loses a point for the spoken word bridge, but makes it back with the great pre-chorus. Also the Carly drawing in the video is super cute!

**urfavgalpal** (7.9): I love to bop to this and then act out the little skits

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): reminds me of February 2020…. a time when I was THRIVING, so now I’m sad hearing this and imagining what would’ve happened if things kept going like that

**jasannn** (7.5): I can see why I haven't listened to the song in about a year but it's still pretty cute.

**racloves** (7.5): sassy break up song I love it

**EnCaine** (7): it's me. i'm the person out there who is surely gonna love a dick

**LostintheCosmicFire** (7): this is fun, although her voice kinda sounds annoying here

**nick1372** (7): This is probably one of the best vocal performances Carly has done ever? The production is not great and the mixing is horrible but I respect that she tried something new

**pheromenos** (7): "someone out there is surely gonna love a dick" omg gay twinks representation

**runaway3212** (7): bop

**Vultuxe** (6.5): The vocal affects are strange but it does kinda bop

# baby ur ma enemy

**afs** (7): I hear the Gwen Stefani influence, and while I do love her cover of Don't Speak, she sounds a bit weird here.

**notarobot3675** (7): this is cute but is lacking something for me

**pat-rickstar** (7): A bop but the vocals are kinda off

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I like the change in sound and the spoken word section but the chorus is lukewarm

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): there is just something OFF about the sound quality of the guitar line that drives me insane and ruins this song for me. the interlude at the end though? ??

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): I really like the melody and flow of the song but the vocal performance is kinda grating

**bbfan132** (6): the concept is fun and there are some decent melodies within the song but overall, it’s kind of lackluster

**fadedblue09** (6): Cute Tug of War throwback, but the bridge is so cringe

**frogaranaman** (6): I mean it’s okay

**hunnybee12** (6): what was the point of this release

**ImADudeDuh** (6): people really went "omfg carly said 'dick' in this song"

**musical\_pyn** (6): hm something's off in the production I think, but a decent track

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): “Never speak again” “Hope we can remain good friends” uhh Carly I’m getting mixed messages. Also the guy in the turtleneck sweater kinda looks like me. Lol.

**celladonn** (5): Mean Carly doesn't really work for me

**geraldinewww** (5): oooooOOOH MOM CARLY SAID DICK MOOOOOMMM

**slimboyfriend** (5): I cannot tell u how disappointed I was when I heard there was a new CRJ song and then it turned out to be THIS.

**wasian-invasion** (5): never bothered listening to this again after it came out

**1998tweety** (4): meh

**akanewasright** (4): this song has good elements (especially the production), but the topline is just kinda... meh

**IIIHenryIII** (4): The guitar ruins this song for me. I would totally vibe to it with a different production.

**pig-serpent** (4): This is mostly a case of just not clicking for me, but I can't imagine having to sit though the "you're sort of a dick sometimes" part every time I wanted to listen to a song and still enjoying it.

**shhhneak** (3): oh I still don’t like this.

**skargardin** (3): the vocals are so terribly mixed

**wavingwolves** (3): someone out there will love a dick? couldn't be me

**welcometoNY** (2): absolutely not

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): I remember listening to this song when it first came out and I was so confused by why this song sounded like a Train reject. I tried listening to this song for the rate and....if I could give a 0 in the bonus rate, it would be this one. I feel like Carly can do much better than this.

**jayjaysortagay** (1): what is this ?????? her voice has never sounded worse. This is just "OMG What's Happening" by Ava Max but 1000x worse

**letsallpoo** (1): was there no budget this time around

I absolutely love Maia, which is why I wish I liked her music more haha. This isn't bad in any way it just doesn't particularly do anything for me, and they both sound lovely on it. Still, I am surprised it outlasted both of Carly's other bonus tracks, and... most of her regular tracks too.

---

# on your own

**1998tweety** (10): smash

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why have I never heard this. This is amazing.

**Alumineous** (10): Wow, I really like this. I love both their voices and the slower tempo. Just a nice song to chill out to.

**letsallpoo** (10): the best thing carly did in 2020

**RandomHypnotica** (10): mxmtoon isn't my favourite artist, but I really do like this song a lot, plus it's nice to hear Carly on a slower-paced, moodier track.

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a LOT better than I remembered

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; the best Carly song here

**amiriteor** (9): this is a big sister song and for that i stan

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): i went into this not wanting to like it but mxmtoon and Carly sound great together on this

**pat-rickstar** (9): This is actually really cute, forgot how much I liked this

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): what a gorgeous song

**ReallyCreative** (9): yeah a joint slay

**vayyiqra** (9): Unexpected collab but cute!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is the first time I’ve ever listened to mxmtoon and OH MY GOD she sounds so good?? I’ll have to check out more of her music! In other words this 9 is for her and not Carly I’m sorry...

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): mxmtoon should have been in the EP Rate (even though her EPs became an album)

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8.5): soo pretty, mxmtoon's voice is so sexy and contrasts so much with carly

**bespectacIed** (8): wtf this filipina queen had a song with carly that i never knew???

**fadedblue09** (8): Ok I think I want acoustic Carly back

**frogaranaman** (8): god they sound so GOOD together

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is cute coffee shop music

**jaztinax** (8): i always thought this song was really cute and pleasant to listen to even though it’s technically kinda boring?? idk i really enjoy this tho

**pig-serpent** (8): Man Carly just slides into this style and eats it up doesn't she.

**racloves** (8): Maia is so cute she deserves everything

**runaway3212** (8): cute but they don't really bring out the best in eachother

**skargardin** (8): actually serving

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): This is really good, I think Carly should explore this sound a bit more in her own music

**fairytalehigh** (7.7): not my favorite mxmtoon tune but like, imagine carly hit you up to collaborate on a song about loneliness in 2020. just imagine

**akanewasright** (7.5): God, Maia is such a sweetheart

**poptartchill** (7.5): I forgot about this song so thanks for the reminder!

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): Can’t relate

**afs** (7): pretty chill acoustic to vibe to when you're in the mood

**iniekcja\_** (7): it's pretty

# (this song is) ok

**nick1372** (7): I’m not a fan of this genre of chill sadboy/girl music and I dislike it even more when it’s driven by these fake, unchanging looped guitars. After a few listens, I’ve decided this is a decent take on this kind of song but I would never have given it a second chance if Carly wasn’t on it.

**SupremeShani** (7): she is basically harmless, but i can't get into mxmtoon for some reason, and i listen to so many adjacent tiktok artist like her too

**wavingwolves** (6.9): just the right amount of relatableness

**Palutzel** (6.8): kinda boring for my taste

**jman457** (6.6): Cute but not really a fav

**bbfan132** (6.5): relaxing song to have on in the background

**pheromenos** (6.5): i'm being so stingy with my bonus scores lmao

**targetguest** (6.5): cute!

**KennyEarthman** (6): run-of-the-mill break up song

**musical\_pyn** (6): cute bop

**Roxieloxie** (6): well, something has to go out first!

**urfavgalpal** (6): i mean it’s a nice song it’s just not my vibe

**IIIHenryIII** (5): The string instrument (I think it's a ukulele) throws me off. I kinda have a hard time enjoying strings on popish songs. They either sound good and fit the song or make it straight bad. I really like Carly's voice on this track though.

**Vultuxe** (5): I listened to it and then immediately forgot it so yeah.

**engifear** (4): Can we ban the ukelele from bedroom pop songs already

**ggal2020** (4): mxmtoon seems like a very nice person, but god her music is so lame

**liberalitea** (4): meh

**cashewconstellation** (1): i blame mxmtoon for this

I always loved how like bouncy and video-game (do the VGV rate) esque the instrumentals of this sounded, it drew me to it a lot. Especially juxtaposed with how dark and self-destructive the lyrics are. I didn't expect this to be one of the top Charli tracks, or at least I didn't expect it to outlast pink diamond and party 4 u so much, but I love it so I am not complaining!

---

# idk i couldn't come up w a pun 

**camerinian** (11): I have already written so, so much about this album, but I need to say more about how incredible this centrepiece of the album is. The reckoning of your own mental anguish with someone providing you unconditional love in the face of your own perceived inadequacy is something that hits me really, really hard, and Charli has such a skill for conveying that turmoil. Her hushed tone is just gorgeous and sells the lyrics beautifully, and the deliberate anticlimax at the end of the track is one of the best moments on the album. Being so deadset on detonation only to be fizzled at the end of it all is oddly comforting, and it's a turning point for a more confident Charli later down the tracklist. I just adore this song, the album wouldn't work without it, and it's also one of the more boppy tracks which really helps its essentiality. I love it, I can listen to this at any time and in any mood, and those type of songs are rare.

**pig-serpent** (11): For as much as I stan Charli XCX she's not a singer I tend to connect with emotionally, but Detonate is a huge exception. The vulnerability expressed in this song is amazing and more relatable than I would like it to be. Also, those arps tho.

**wasian-invasion** (11): i LOVE the frenetic production of this, it fits so well with the lyrics and gets me moving every time. Using my 11 here but i seriously doubt this is making day 3

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): those bubbly synths are EVERYTHING

**urfavgalpal** (9.6): I like this a lot and the way it tick tick ticks like the song is gonna detonate and then that end is perfect

**conceptualromance** (9.5): I like the more calm sound of this song. It works well within the album because of how high-energy all of the other songs have been up to this point.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): this song goes like thirty seconds too long but it sounds so cool

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): An underrated song, one of my faves on this album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Low key BDSM anthem.

**bookthieving** (9): i kinda ignored this track on my first few listens but now i'm kinda obsessed with it? the lyrics about insecurity hit hard, and i love how the bubbly synths distort into something darker towards the end

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Quarantine definitely amplified my feelings of self-doubt and self-deprecation so I definitely feel for Charli here.

**nick1372** (9): can’t really explain why this one resonates with me but it really does

**oscarbrierley1** (9): I get the ending but its still really unsatisfying to me, but I love the rest

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): 'pull you close and then i'll be gone' well that hurts but then 'i don't trust myself alone why should you love me' hits and that hurts worse. the whole song i was like yeah beep boop space pop synth but she'd hit me with the lyrics again. it's like getting beaten up by a clown.

**salivantsonority** (9): So dreamy; one of my fav Charli tracks.

**skargardin** (9): the synths are so good here

**TiltControls** (9): this is also great!

**Vultuxe** (9): Detonate is so cute and bubbly it almost does not fit the album. The lyrics are a high point as well. A pleasantly surprising track.

**Palutzel** (8.8): subtler production, beautiful song

**wavingwolves** (8.7): too close for comfort

**jman457** (8.6): giving me postal service vibes, I like the minimalism of the song compared to her other songs.

**bbfan132** (8.5): better version of owl city

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): I have unironically done the robot to the breakdown portion at the end of this song – I will continue unironically doing the robot to this portion of the song

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The audience relates...

**targetguest** (8.5): didn't have much love for this song until going through this album again and listening to the lyrics. now it's one of my favs

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): boom

**1998tweety** (8): this is cute tbh

**akanewasright** (8): I love AG Cook’s production so much

**bigbigbee** (8): well you are the one, the one that lies close to me / whispers ‘hello, I’ve missed you quite terribly’ / I fell in love, in love with you suddenly / now there’s no place else I could be, but here in your arms (we need to rate this song so I can give it an 11, vote for the 00s one hit wonder rate)

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): sad and cute. The pacing of the sounds reminded me of drinking too much caffeine sometimes especially since the vocals are kinda slow, fun contrast.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is okay but I wish I was listening to “Explode” from the soundtrack to *Angry Birds* though

**IIIHenryIII** (8): That intro is so good and it makes me happy that it plays in the background almost the entire track.

**iniekcja\_** (8): I don't think it's as good as people make it out to be

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): This is so much more fun and light than I ever would have expected from a Charli XCX song called "detonate". Must be the lowercase d

**nootnoot781** (8): halsey when she’s in new york

**runaway3212** (8): This is really relatable, the build up here is immaculate

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I would say DeTENate but it’s not a 10 so instead I will say DetonEIGHT

**throwaway7650** (8): actually like the autotune in this... not a fan of the repetitive outro though, which prevents me from scoring this higher

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Super catchy and I love the synth textures in this one. Some of her better lyrics too tbh

**vayyiqra** (8): Cute but sad. :pensive:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the little bomb beeping songs in here

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (7.5): the least interesting on the album

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): baby shark do-do-do-do-do-do you love me?

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): I absolutely love the beginning but the rest of the song kinda loses me

**afs** (7): I really like the variation this song goes through, but autotune really puts a damper on emotion. Adore the new sound that comes near the end, though!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): oh this is good, thank goodness.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): always been one of the more uninteresting songs on this album but it's still quite nice

**waluigiest** (7): https://youtu.be/RYit5rOyLAw

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): I love this beat

**liberalitea** (6.5): this song is mostly average but i like the outro

**CarlieScion** (6): idk why should i!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): The outro for this detracts a lot. Like, what the fuck is going on here on this day

**ManofOranges** (6): You would think a song called Detonate would sound more like it's going to explode with sound.

**Oberionsynth** (6): this gives me "timebomb" by tove lo vibes. i don't really like that song either

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The instrumentation is like video game music… no I’m serious I’m pretty sure I’ve heard this in a Mario game before

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Is this what a hyper pop ballad is??

**SupremeShani** (5): The instrumental and production go off, just like the rest of the album, but I have so much trouble getting into Charli's contributions for some reason.

**frogaranaman** (4): this is where you can begin to tell this album was made in a month

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): not sure how this type of music can be boring but this song did it

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2): kind of unremarkable to me. feels like background noise, but make it somewhat anxiety-inducing

**NotWith10000Men** (1.5): it's nothing and annoying as hell at the same time, truly incredible

**bespectacIed** (1): cringecore

**fadedblue09** (10): Sounds really subtle considering the title. Anyway, I love how contemplative she sounds here while sounding playful

**hakkerj** (10): As soon as I heard this song, I knew my boyfriend and I were going to breakup.

**J\_Toe** (10): my favourite on the album. It's so poppy and cute while relaying some truly dark thoughts and expeirences of mental health. Reminds me of Chromatica in concept (not in sound as this PC sound is completely different to the 90s house of LG6).

**juanolsen** (10): my personal favorite from this album, extremely relatable

**KennyEarthman** (10): bop. my ears detonated

**Leixander** (10): not ready for this one to get robbed by the anti-bleepbloop gang, such a great song

**Qustomar** (10): Yaaaaaaas, kinda feels like the 2020 version of the more early-mid 2010s PC Music sound, found in tracks like Keri Baby and Drop FM.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The outro for this song is so good. So, SO good, probably the best outro in this entire rate.

**ReallyCreative** (10): the crown jewel of this album, it still hits just as hard a year later

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): detonate the sad grenade!! Charli’s honest lyrics about feelings of unworthiness causing self-sabotage in relationships just break me

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I'M ABOUT TO DETONATE

It's *so* epic I'll give it that, and I do appreciate the first minute of this until the first drop (I am, admittedly, not a fan of the drops, but I really appreciate how different it is). Idk maybe it'll hit different live. BUT, even if she isn't the first to do it, having the last track of the album represent an idea of shedding your snakeskin as you move on to your next step or next era is really simply elegant, and I love it for that.

**Oberionsynth** (10): the song that got me into Final Fantasy just bc of the sampling here, ugh her MIND

**plastichaxan** (10): imagine making an album with a perfect opener AND a perfect closer… her power

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): perfect song. that drop is so good it should be illegal. the stuttering vocals, the sexy vibes, the slave 4 u moment, i stan!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is the closest sonically to the RINA EP imo, and as such I adore it. The instrumental is rich, dramatic and fresh, that final fantasy melody interpreation is god-tier, and it's a fantastic closer. "Buy my expensive, excluisve painwear" lives rent-free in my mind

**skargardin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHx5hCVN26E

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is also unfairly hated??? it fucking samples beethoven and final fantasy and you people hate this? the prechorus is so fucking hype?? it's bottom half of the album... easily.... but it's still super solid

**throwaway7650** (10): perfect album closer and will go out earlier than it should

**urfavgalpal** (10): yeah this fucking kills I mean Dynasty is the best album opener of the year and Snakeskin is the best album closer of the year.

**notarobot3675** (9.8): WHAT a closer

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.6): so lush and epic

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): A little bit of a chaotic closer, but you know, it still kind of slaps? Love just how the progression of the song goes, kind of mellow if tinged a little by drama, and then how it picks up the pace at certain points, with those bell hits, sombre piano and the Final Fantasy interpolations, it's such a strange track but it kind of works? It's also a great tie-in to the beginning where she says she has found the strength to overcome her struggles and begin anew, letting them be placed, cards on the table, for all to see. I kind of wish I knew what Rina's mom was saying over the final Sonata closing, though.

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): and this is THEE closer

**poptartchill** (9.5): Such a good closer! Very epic song

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Yeah this is how you close out such a great album.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): The only problem I have with this song is that it isn’t 10 minutes longer

**juanolsen** (9.4): great way to close the album, absolutely cathartic and brings all the themes in the album to an end

**celladonn** (9.2): We stan the Final Fantasy victory music

**bbfan132** (9): such a fun outro, i love the drop in the middle

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I I really like how she drags out words here.

**EnCaine** (9): i remembered not liking this one but it's great??

**engifear** (9): This is one of my favorite outros to an album

**liberalitea** (9): this is a great closer for the album and i love how it breaks down.

**nooodisaster** (9): You know what... this is a collapse. Again, the production here is just soooo good, it could carry the song on itself.

**oscarbrierley1** (9): thee bop

**pat-rickstar** (9): The chorus is a bit disappointing but the epic prechorus makes up for it

**TiltControls** (9): the FF victory adds at least 3 points onto this song

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): That FF sample tho

**just\_thonking** (8.5): This song is so creative, which makes the song before it come off as even more bland

**pheromenos** (8.5): idk, i don't like dialogues in songs, especially as outros. the song itself is an easy 9.5-10 tho.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Not nearly as good as Dynasty but a great closer nonetheless

**SupremeShani** (8.5): As a closer to an truly amazing album, I think this song perfectly encapsulates what makes Rina such a dynamic figure in pop music. The way this dramatic track that starts off with a stripped down segment, that goes off into a manic breakdown with grand vocals, Final Fantasy samples, and hushed clapping shows that Rina Sawayama really is the moment.

**jman457** (8.4): feels very full circle with Dynasty so its only appropriate for it to get the same score

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): As Rina is finished tackling key moments in her life in this album, this song feels like an appropriate closer. I like how she explained that this entire album is her "snakeskin" and now that she is done talking, she has shredded it off and it's now in the hands of the fans, listeners, and critics.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is really the “Lingerie” of *Sawayama*, a closer that’s unexpected and kinda a disappointment when you first listen to it but after a while you understand why she did it. After everything that we’ve heard before she had to leave us with a battle cry, and “Snakeskin” is a promise that she’s always going to keep pushing and changing,

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): I actually love this song, just never such it would be my pick for album closer

**ktajlili** (8): I love the metaphor about shedding family trauma like a "snakeskin." This is a great closer.

**lolcevan** (8): there’s so much to process here

**musical\_pyn** (8): FINAL FANTASY GANG RISE UP

**seanderlust** (8): the interpolation of the FF victory theme? the beethoven sample? I am scalped. my only complaint is that the chorus can feel a bit anti-climactic

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is probably my least favorite on the album even though I’m scoring it the same as another song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): honestly the best way to describe this is interesting but a GOOD interesting

**Vultuxe** (8): Finally and interesting song, weird EDM vibes with a drop but nonetheless it's welcome after the last few songs.

**wasian-invasion** (8): all i can think of is the "i'm shedding my shedding my shedding my FORESKIN!" tweet

**welcome2thejam** (8): Rina used Final Fantasy victory theme reference! Critical hit! Rina has gained 420 exp. points! Snakeskin has gained a level (Lvl. 8)!

**cashewconstellation** (7.6): i used to skip this but it's good now

**camerinian** (7.5): the Final Fantasy sample ugh her mind

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): this song needed to be like at least one verse longer, but I love closing songs that literally sound like they’re winding down. I literally just imagine someone running down a dark swirly staircase lol

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): Hiss hiss motherfucker

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright, we love final fantasy tho

**CarlieScion** (7): a cute lil moment

**Qustomar** (7): Taylor Swift after Repuation

Awkward_King: # 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's a cool closer, mostly as a vehicle for some more interesting influences, but I'm not a huge fan compared to the others

**Raykel** (7.7): It is pretty lackluster for a closer, but I feel like this song would've been liked more out of that context.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this is such a weird track to close the album on. I like but not sure how I feel about the placement

**savemeaseat143** (7.3): chosen family should've been the closer

**afs** (7): I thought it was gonna be another ballad, but it really picked up. Fast. Not a big fan of that drop in between though.

**J\_Toe** (7): the Final Fantasy sample doesn't fit as seemlessly as the one on Cyber Stockholm Syndrome. It sticks out, and distracts me. But the rest of the song is cool.

**Uberpigeon** (7): I LOVE the prechorus but not as keen on everything else

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): it's alright but Chosen Family shouldda been the closer :/

**jasannn** (6.5): This song is carried by that incredible EDM drop.

**akanewasright** (6): This song is good for sure, but like... idk, I have zero attachment to it whatsoever

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Kind of repetitive and other songs on the album accomplish what it's trying to do better. Still slaps tho.

**hunnybee12** (6): sawayama deserved a better closer. this is ok, just scattered and unmemorable

**KennyEarthman** (6): this song is so boring (except for that drop)

**nick1372** (6): I like how ambitious this is but it just doesn’t suit Rina’s voice I think

**NotWith10000Men** (6): strange one to end on, I think chosen fam would have been better

**slimboyfriend** (6): What do u think Rina's favorite Final Fantasy game is? Would she exalt the 32 bit perfection of FFVI or make the safe choice with FFVII or honor the franchise's JRPG history and choose FFIX or pick FFXbecause it established a precedent for the franchise's step into 3D or choose FFXII because of the detailed but simple combat system, or would she pretend to have awful taste and choose FFVIII?

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't know quite how to feel about this song. I don't really like it musically, but I feel bad rating it too low knowing it's important to Rina and it's the closing track for a reason. But I was going to give it a lower score than this but changed it, so that will have to do.

**wavingwolves** (6): this feels like a halsey song (derogatory)

**brenda\_official** (4): underwhelming closer. should have been chosen family smh

**Leixander** (4): this album ends with Tokyo Love Hotel. this album ends with Tokyo Love Hotel. this album ends-

**ManofOranges** (4): Should made like a snakeskin and shed this from the album, am I right? Omg so funny.

**runaway3212** (4): I really just don't like this

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): a bit too chaotic for my liking

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): There’s a lot going on in this song… I’m not sure if I like it… also what is Final Fantasy doing here!?

**ImADudeDuh** (3): why are all the closers this rate trash

**fadedblue09** (1): Just plain awful

# please

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I like how it sounds so different from the other tracks.

**pig-serpent** (7): This is a really unique song!

I stand firmly on the side of Jack Antonoff rights, I am a slut for the the basic synths he uses with every pop girl, I am the average, bland white person he markets his songs towards and it fucking works. This is such a nice official collaboration between the two of them, and is a song that I think improves as it goes, the "come with me, I am the keeper" bridge is so lovely, and I really enjoy their voices together. However, it is not Hate That You Know Me, and for that it loses half a point.

---

# no no come back dont leave the rate ahahah

**just\_thonking** (11): Exhibit A of why Jack Antonoff deserves rights

**seeyanever** (11): Jack and Carly are at their best with this one

**welcometoNY** (11): jack antonoff supremacy

**1998tweety** (10): we love bleachers

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Obviously Jack's fingerprints are all over this track but it doesn't stop this song from being amazing, love the sort of throwback vibe this one has (I think? It definitely feels vintage without sounding like it), great melody to the whole thing.

**bbfan132** (10): i love this synthpop sound, carly sounds wonderful here (and jack sounds great too!)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Might be the best low-key CRJ bop. That bridge is so pretty.

**celladonn** (10): Not to sound like a Bleachers stan but this is just undeniably the best song on the album

**conceptualromance** (10): I’m mad this wasn’t on the actual Dedicated album. THIS is a B Side, Ms Jepsen?

**fadedblue09** (10): As one of the resident Antonoff haters on this sub, I have to concede to him on this one. For once, instead of drowning Carly in excessive cheesiness, he takes a backseat and let Carly's soulful vocals take center stage. That and the more mature themes (self-love and independence!) makes this one of her best songs since All That.

**fairytalehigh** (10): between the antonoff/CRJ harmonies and oblique references to all-night blowjob marathons, it doesn't get much better than this

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Everything Jack touches turns into gold.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): yes im a jackoff, give me the death penalty idc

**Leixander** (10): COME WITH ME I'M THE KEEPER OF THAT BEAT AND THE FIRE UNDER YOUR FEET, I'M A KEEPER MAAAAAAAN! I'M THE KEEPER!

**liberalitea** (10): best song on the album honestly

**mudkip1** (10): why does this sound so good

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is my second favorite song from dedicated a&b (only behind too much)

**nooodisaster** (10): Beautiful. Works both romantically and as a career reflection, and the production is weighty enough to hold both interpretations with the dignity they deserve.

**pat-rickstar** (10): When balladphobia is defeated by this being Carly's highest song, as it should be

**pig-serpent** (10): The best soft song on the album.

**pros-and-connors** (10): mom and dad together at last ??

**runaway3212** (10): I really love this so much

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This self-care anthem is the best song on the album and I’m not even a Jack stan. As someone who tries to care for others while pushing my own emotions to the side, I feel like Carly is speaking directly to me.

**salivantsonority** (10): Loved this song; wouldn't have been mad if this made it onto Side A. All the best things about a Carly song here. Like a more lowkey sibling to "Your Type". Beautiful post-chorus.

**shhhneak** (10): Jackoff supremacy continues.

**skargardin** (10): we have to ascend

**SmileAndTears** (10): I mean, of course the best song on the album is the Bleachers collab

**Tedyonce** (10): best song on Side B

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is cute

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): i'm such a sucker for this classic antonoff/bleachers sound. and the bridge is fantastic

**Turpamutteri** (10): Bleachers wohoo

**vagenda** (10): Carly knows that everything is better in moderation and that includes Jack Antonoff. Could she make a whole album with him? Probably, if she wanted to. But she chooses instead to keep her options open and put out only the best of the best of what they make together and I respect the hell out of that. All of their collabs are big fat 10s and this is no exception

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes I am an unrepentant Jackoff stan. All haters are directed to go argue with the wall.

**Vultuxe** (10): Comeback is gorgeous, would give it another 11 if I could. I'm surprised at how impactful the hook is while also being deceptively simple and catchy.

**wasian-invasion** (10): i'd let jack antonoff cum on my ba

**zagreux** (10): u/lordemusic

**wavingwolves** (9.8): i love this bleachers song omfg

**notarobot3675** (9.7): i have a confession... i like jack antonoff as a producer :s i think he gets a bad wrap. anyways this is one of the best songs on this album imho

**Alumineous** (9): Bleachers being credited like a female feature on a Taylor Swift song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I haven't heard the main album yet but wow I am surprised this was initially scrapped because the song feels like it could be a nice transition from Emotion to Dedicated. At least we get to hear this masterpiece through a B-side album! Dang, we need more collabs from CRJ and Antonoff.

**iniekcja\_** (9): Jack Antonoff gets hotter with every occasion

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Jack Antonoff is just teasing us at this point….give us new Bleachers! Or actually, Lorde first, then Bleachers, then you can make as many more Carly and Taylor albums as you want and I'll listen to them all

**nick1372** (9): I’m such a sucker for Carly singing over Jack Antonoff production that I can look past the fact that the lyrics to this make absolutely no fucking sense. I’ll be waiting on that carly + jack musical until the day I die

**poptartchill** (9): this is really just a Bleachers song with Carly singing but it's a good one

**Raykel** (9): Imagine if this was on Dedicated instead. I know it's about a relationship, but just the line "I was thinking about making a comeback" would've been so powerful after the long break after Emotion. A very humble "What you gon do when I appear???" moment.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I will continue to defend Jack with my life (give us the new Bleachers album though, Jack!)

**steelstepladder** (9): This album is backloaded AF

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Gay coming of age movie soundtrack ft. Jack Antonoff

**amiriteor** (8.9): it just gets

**savemeaseat143** (8.9): the bridge!

**camerinian** (8.5): more into high-energy Bleachers than vibey Bleachers, but Ugh dreamy

**jsonphile** (8.5): another man??? Can this be true???

**rickikardashian** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwN-BUDSHDo

**seanderlust** (8.5): this is a carly-fronted bleachers song but that's ok because I like bleachers

**SupremeShani** (8.5): when i was originally listening to this album, i really thought i was a genius for clocking the obvious jack off ants's production before i actually looked at the title and saw that it's a literal bleachers cover, ugh my mind

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): One of my favorites from this album. Her and Jack sound magical together

**jman457** (8.4): Carly really Jacked Anton off on here

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): the way I can’t help but associate this with the Lindsay Lohan comeback single that came out at the same time and uses the same lyrical concept

**juanolsen** (8.1): the bleachers feature is nice but is sound too much like something out of strange desire
[/r/popheads/comments/nnsujq/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_2_so_what_youre/gzwl20x/]

=====

Awkward_King: **afs** (8): Guess which main pop girl would have killed this 80s synthpop track on her album some years ago... nevertheless Carly does a great job here.

**endcreditouilles** (8): love Bleachers in this, just don't love this song unfortunately

**Oberionsynth** (8): ugh chill carly is best carly

**Roxieloxie** (8): I've heard 3 bleachers songs, Dont take the money, rollercoaster, and I wanna Get better, and now hearing this im beginning to think i was baited with I Wanna get better

**throwaway7650** (8): I hope this survives day 1 at least... jackoff is overhated

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I was wondering why I liked this song so much… then I saw “Bleachers”

**waluigiest** (8): honest question: what is the difference between a bleachers feature and an Antonoff production/co-write? Background vocals?

**cashewconstellation** (7.8): i have a weird relationship with this song as i think it's a bit overrated but i'm rating it this cause i couldn't not sing along to the last chorus

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): jack antonoff is on it so im not complaining

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I know this is a favorite on here but it doesn’t do much for me.

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I wish Jack would help Lorde with her comeback instead

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): wew that last chorus

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's nice

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Jack Antonoff said “let’s reuse the You Are In Love beat and make it more pop!”

# jackoff antis

**anothertown** (7): we love Lover (2019) castoffs here

**CrimsonROSET** (7): like this is cute but not gorgeous

**frogaranaman** (7): if someone didn’t tell me the feature on this song and told me I had to guess who it was I would guess Jack Antonoff the first twenty times then the twenty first time I would guess a Jack Antonoff wannabe

**jasannn** (7): This was the sub's favorite Carly song of 2020??

**ktajlili** (7): hmm needs more Jack Antonoff

**ManofOranges** (7): Everybody loves a comeback.

**geraldinewww** (6.9): jack antonoff stop producing songs from artists i like. this is a jack antonoff hate zone (from me only)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): "I am the keeper" sounds like it's prime for a cheesy minecraft parody, "I am the creeper"

**artzpop** (6.7): I respect it but it's not for me

**akanewasright** (6): This is a comforting song to play when you feel nothing and are lying on the bathroom floor, contemplating life as you know it. Unfortunately it now reminds me of a time in my life that I don’t like to be reminded of, and the outro is obnoxiously long.

**J\_Toe** (6): certainly sounds like a Bleachers track, lol

**slimboyfriend** (6): slightly better than a mediocre Bleachers song

**urfavgalpal** (5.4): Before I did my relisten I thought this was my least favorite track on the album but turns out it’s not my least favorite track it’s just that the ones I like less are more forgettable so I guess this gets credit for being memorable?  Unfortunately what makes it memorable is that this just straight up sounds like Taylor Swift on fuck I don’t know which album it was it’s the one that was all synth poppy I think Lover?  I listened once and found it forgettable and never listened to it again so the comparison doesn’t bode well.  I disagree with the frequent statement that all Jack Antonoff songs sound the same but god this one really makes me question that.  I think there are some nice moments but Carly’s songs are at their best when they make my heart burst with emotion and this song doesn’t make me feel much

**cremeebrulee** (5): i’m so sorry i love jack antonoff but this song bores me to tears ………… please someone share what you see in this because i can’t and would love to

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Her and Jack made magic together with “Want You In My Room…” but there’s a reason that song was on the album and this is a B-side. (read: this is boring)

**NotWith10000Men** (5): wish it built to something

**oscarbrierley1** (5): meh

**plastichaxan** (5): no<3

**KennyEarthman** (4): this is so Jack Antonoff

**bespectacIed** (0): A bot that makes the median jack antonoff track created this. That man needs a music industry blackout please god

**brenda\_official** (0): snoozefest also sounds too much like a bleachers song

**ReallyCreative** (0): I don't know if this is actually the worst song in the rate, but Cumback stans are easily some of my least favorite Carly fans. Tasteless to the grave. This is by far and away the worst collaboration between Jack and Carly, absolutely nothing happens in this song. It's not even a proper ballad or anything. It's just a few minutes of nothing. And are Bleachers even here besides Jack's production? I'm whelmed.

I appreciate Rina's venture into it's-not-really-hyperpop-but-I'm-gonna-call-it-hyperpop-because-it's-kinda-funky-bleep-bloop-sounding, even if it's not my favourite on the album. I think these are some of Rina's strongest lyrics from the album, even if the chorus is a bit repetitive, and I like that it touches in more detail on what Dynasty did in the album intro.

---

# akasaka happy :)

**1998tweety** (10): this will be robbed but its a smash

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Definitely a grower but man do I love the kind of glitchy, swaggering beat to this, with this sort of chaotic instrumental paired with the internal dilemma on display of being in between East and West that Rina is in, it's super catchy and danceable. Also I might be a few years too young for it but the 'Twenty-eight and I still want to scream' line... bitch, me too. The fuck.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I think this is the song that has grown on the most. Not everyone gets to travel to another country to combat a depressive episode or get out of emotional funk but I think we’ve all tried to look for happiness in something external like a place or person or hobby only to realize it doesn't quite get the job done. Sometimes it all just seems hopeless, no matter what you do or in this case, no matter where you go.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is painful, why can I relate.

**Dekubaku** (10): I'm a sucka for hese wordplays!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): i really love and relate it How Rina talked about family, mental health and being tied to different cultures and countries.

**ggal2020** (10): if this album was an essay this would be the thesis

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The chorus is so simple yet so brilliant. She manages to say so many things using so many few words.

**juanolsen** (10): this song really blows my mind every time, the lyrics and the production are otherworldly

**LuisEnRod** (10): a song about feeling depressed and lost in your 20s? Sign me up!

**moooo566** (10): This has been stuck in my brain for basically a year at this point, just circling round and round and round. Very nearly my 11.

**plastichaxan** (10): the power this song holds over me is insane, everything about this song is just perfect

**sarcasticsobs** (10): clarence did this for US

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Y’all did this one dirty

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): on the note of this one let me just say i'm so fucking proud of her for breaking down the barriers for the uk's awards shows and being recognized for both her identities. literally the best album to come out of that country in YEARS and they stonewalled her.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): I love how the less-traditional structure sort of gives it an anxious quality that enhances the lyrics

**urfavgalpal** (10): this song is so fun to me.  I think a lot of the sounds on this are things she recorded when she was staying at a specific hotel?  I don’t remember exactly what it was but I think it really shows her creativity

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): "akasaka sad cause i'm a sucker, sucker how i suffer" is such a crazy hook! honestly, a banger

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Love when Clarence gets a bit weirder with the production here

**SupremeShani** (9.5): It makes me sad that this will probably be on the lower end of SAWAYAMA songs, because it really is one of the more experimental songs on the album that works.

**akanewasright** (9): I was fully ready to give this song a respectful 7 (aka “it’s good but I don’t personally love it”), but then I listened with good earbuds and realized how fucking good the production is.

**anothertown** (9): 28 and i still wanna scream!

**bbfan132** (9): i love how wonky this is lol, i enjoyed the trap influence quite a bit too

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As an Asian immigrant kid who now resides in my homeland country, I definitely feel for Rina's homesickness displayed in this song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): akasaka triste

**KennyEarthman** (9): Clarence Clarity snapped in this one

**liberalitea** (9): the Japanese in the 2nd verse and the final chorus makes me ASCEND. i just wish it was longer

**Oberionsynth** (9): i too am sad wherever I go

**pig-serpent** (9): If Rina pivoted into only releasing Arca inspired glitch pop for the rest of her career I wouldn't be complaining.

**waluigiest** (9): the “akasaka sad, I guess I’ll be sad” hook is brilliant

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.8): 28 and i still wanna screaaaam

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): would be higher but the production on the second verse bugs me

**nick1372** (8.5): songs about being sad when you’re supposed to be happy get me every fuckin time

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is a cool song for what it pulls off but it's not among my favorites

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This took a few listens for me but the lyrics really brought me into it. It also stands out on the album sonically.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This might be the most weird song on the album? It has such a disconcerting vibe which I love cause it fits so well with the theme of Rina not being able to reconnect fully with her birthplace of Japan and feeling like a stranger

**musical\_pyn** (8): another song that just goes so hard

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ok does anyone else hear the similarity between the akasada sad parts and what goes around comes around by JT??

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): such a haunting sound. it goes all over the place in the best way

**endcreditouilles** (7.8): I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl I am living in that second verse

**wavingwolves** (7.8): love the play of words in this sooo much

**jasannn** (7.5): Not my favorite track but the production goes hard here.

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Experimental. Needed more time in the lab?

# akasaka sad :(

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's fine

**throwaway7650** (7.5): can't get myself to love this song unfortunately

**afs** (7): I wasn't too fond for most of the hip-hop (is it?), but the second chorus absolutely bangs.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): well turn that frown upside down!

**ktajlili** (7): I don't listen to this one much but it's creative and interesting.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's good, just not much more. It's the end of the weakest stretch of the album for me so at least after this everything only gets better.

**Uberpigeon** (7): I like the production but not too keen on the vocals

**vayyiqra** (7): Trap banger (this is a joke). I used to think the chorus was a bit weak but the bridge is really good.

**geraldinewww** (6.6): sucks to be me. sucks to be so lonely.

**jaztinax** (6.5): this song switches between being a 5 and a 8 for me depending on which part of the song it is so i’m torn

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the assonance in the chorus is so satisfying, the rest of the song just doesn't do it for me

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): This one is still good overall, but really one of the Sawayama songs that I've gotten most tired of

**nooodisaster** (6): Screaming that this is technically the title track since she name drops her own name.

**Vultuxe** (6): It kinda pops off but it seems a bit silly and not in a good way?

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): The instrumental is cool but the chorus annoys me

**fadedblue09** (5): I understand what she was trying to do with this but I'm not sure if it worked.

**runaway3212** (5): a bit repetative but good

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): What I expected from SAWAYAMA: a thoughtful and poetic treatise on the negative effects of capitalism on everyday life / What I got: a-ka-sa-ka-sa-wa-ya-ma

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): Alaska, why are you sad :(

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): Alaska sad :(

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): its too late for me to get into my complicated feelings about not feeling connected my fathers heritage so ill just say i read the title of this song as 'Alaska sad' and i was really thrown off for a bit

**jman457** (8.3): Sure it was pretty recent this wasnt called Alaska sad, but it still slaps

**wasian-invasion** (8): "Track number five: Alaska Sad" - AjayII 2020

**zagreux** (8): alaska sad

**frogaranaman** (7): I always read this as ‘Alaskan Sad’ for some reason

**ManofOranges** (6): Not me always reading the title as "Akaska" and simply thinking that she mispelled "Alaska" for some strange reason.

While it may not be Rina's most innovative subject matter compared to the generational trauma, anti-capitalist and immigrant experience themed songs, it fuckin bops. Her exploration into 90s R&B here is very appreciated, and it would be even more appreciated if we got a remix of it with Tinashe like I have spent the past 13 months manifesting (swifties that is not a Taylor hint **do not engage**).

---

# i love myself

**Tedyonce** (11): NEW JACK SWING REVIVAL 2021 PLZ

**afs** (10): I think I've made it clear how much I adore 80s synthpop. But that electric guitar solo... whew.

**akanewasright** (10): Can’t relate, but I do love me some 90’s R&B pop

**Alumineous** (10): I can't explain why I like this song so much. It just immediately grabbed me.

**bespectacIed** (10): It's easy to scoff at self-love songs but I will always be grateful and tolerant of em. I love the cheese. P.S. Rina doesn't frack and isn't transphobic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She really said said let me bring back New Jack Swing real quick. This song makes me want to dance more than any other on the album which is saying a lot.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you know when a song just hits you in an unexpected way? This was that. Fuck beauty standarts.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fun funky

**juanolsen** (10): as always rina is great at instrospective lyrics, the whole song is great but I really love the chorus

**KennyEarthman** (10): has a skating rink at night vibe

**ManofOranges** (10): As clichéd as the message is, she's absolutely right and she should say it!!

**Qustomar** (10): Love this New Jack Swing moment yum!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is basically an Utada Hikaru song, not that I'm complaining, Utada is a goddess

**ReallyCreative** (10): this feels like one of the more RINA tracks on the album, and it's presence is a nice break from some of the more intense stuff on the front half of the album

**runaway3212** (10): more like love me 10 me

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Rina has RuPaul quaking in his Klein Epstein & Parker boots

**skargardin** (10): underrated!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the fact this was almost left off the album (and seeing how the bonus tracks are so much worse than it) is like.. shocking. thank god. this song is amazing.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Love the lyrical content of this one, she’s like CDG’s sensitive little sister and the rhythmic quality it has is so so sooooo good

**wavingwolves** (10): my answer is: i will never love anyone ever, not even myself, that's all!

**welcometoNY** (10): can i get an amen

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.9): without the guitar solo it would be much lower but the guitar solo is hot

**urfavgalpal** (9.9): RuPaul could never!  Honestly this would be a 10 if it weren’t for the fact that the “if you can’t love yourself” bit takes me out because it reminds me of RuPaul. I love it though.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): As far as self-loving anthems go, this is pretty high up there. If you’re reading this, the only one you should be comparing yourself to is yourself. Try to do better than you did yesterday, don’t be too hard on yourself and stay awesome. Bye.

**bulforster** (9.5): The first verse is weak but it's great when it gets into the (new jack) swing of things.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): A panromantic anthem

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): One of the better self love anthems

**bbfan132** (9): the best song from the 90s that was released in 2020

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Loving myself has been a difficult, conflicting journey as I have barely high self-esteem of myself. If I display my self-confidence, I get scared that I might look egoistic. This is such an empowering song from Rina and I highly appreciate it.

**nick1372** (9): woo!

**Oberionsynth** (9): this song makes me feel like i'm watching the dan and phil pastel cooking videos and I'm obsessed with that

**seanderlust** (9): the late 90s vibes on this are impeccable. also rina guest judge on drag race when

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This song is just so boppy!!

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): love the message here but i feel like the verses are too short

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): PLEASE let us bring back teen pop! I'm asking politely

**jasannn** (8.5): Who needs a bridge when you have an amazing guitar solo that is just as cathartic?

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Wholesome Bop

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): This song might get robbed but I think its really sweet!!

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): pretty standard self love stuff, but the production has all these fun bits and that guitar solo kills

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Can I get an Amen up in here?

**J\_Toe** (8): This is the track that most reminds me of her 2017 EP RINA, in how Y2K it sounds.

**musical\_pyn** (8): more like 8 years hahaha wait fuck this isn't even the right album

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i want a more developed version of this sound from her, but it's still a bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): another one that is pure fun

**vayyiqra** (8): This is so early 90s. It's a jam.

**jman457** (7.7): 90’s throwback for this song was an excellent idea

**engifear** (7): I would love to hear the original New Jack Swing version of the song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): the verses on this song went to the Ariana grande school of enunciation but the guitar pulls this song together

# :i_kendricklamar:

**savemeaseat143** (8.3): I don't like that particular quote

**Dekubaku** (8): Not a bad song at all. But compared to the other tracks in the album, I felt like it paled a bit.

**ktajlili** (8): I loved this one for a while, but I'm kind of over it. Still a bop though. I relate the theme of being at odds with your parents.

**throwaway7650** (8): one of my "least favorites" (as an 8 lol) but good message

**salivantsonority** (7.7): Forgot about this song. Good, but not incredible.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): In most other albums this would be a cool kind of rock-inspired pop song about self-acceptance that I think would work for anyone. In the tracklisting though I kind of find this a little bit too muted, a bit too tame for Rina's standards. Nothing much else to say.

**liberalitea** (7.5): I think this is one of the weaker tracks on the album, but it's still great! just falls a little flat compared to the rest.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): RuPaul co-wrote this.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It's forgettable, but it's a good song, though.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): This is good but kind of forgettable - sounds like an NSYNC B-side

**NotWith10000Men** (7): feels like comme des garcons' sister

**pat-rickstar** (7): This is a bop but I never really cared for it as much as other songs here, it has a nice message but it's not a key part of the album's story to me

**waluigiest** (7): it’s got some nice jammy moments and the guitar bridge is nice

**Stryxen** (6.9): i love all my sawayama tracks equally. Earlier that day: i don’t care for love me 4 me

**nooodisaster** (6.5): The simplest song on here, but it's pure.

**poptartchill** (6.5): is it a bad song? No! But it is my least favorite.

**frogaranaman** (6): haha get it love me ‘4’ me

**SupremeShani** (6): The song does get points from me by somehow avoiding being overly saccharine that typically plagues self empowerment anthems, and the fact that Rina can have a New Jack Swing inspired song like this alongside nu-metal and bubblegum pop just speaks volumes about her range. I just don't really connect with it all that much.

**fenellabeach** (5.6): the rupaul quote brought it right down

**oscarbrierley1** (5): ru paul could never, if u can't frack yourself, who can u frack

**Vultuxe** (5): Seemed really generic to me, and I think I don't like her voice enough to appreciate the "generic" kind of pop songs.

**plastichaxan** (4): i'm sorry but she's not on the level of these girlies

**pig-serpent** (3): This one's pretty bland.

# cock

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): What Dixie D’Amelio thinks her song “Fuckboy” sounds like

**AHSWeeknd** (10): why’s he sending so many pictures of his clock?

**akanewasright** (10): ITS 9 O COCK

**amiriteor** (10): always makes me chuckle

**anothertown** (10): huge bop, big smash, funky, fresh

**bespectacIed** (10): "o'cock" iconic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): SO. DAMN. FINE.

**cremeebrulee** (10): men are whores its true

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): Tbh there’s a lot of songs about cheating on the album? But this is fun. I really like how they set up the narrative with firs the nine o clock and then the four o clock. I love how they sing damn fine.

**hikkaru** (10): maybe my fave on the album tbh it's so fun

**Leixander** (10): when i mishear the first line as "it's not a cock", then they go on to rhyme that line later with the word cock...

**ManofOranges** (10): Take away one letter and all of a sudden this song is about the job I had at the local olive garden for two months.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is brutal. it is a brutal ripping into fuck boy behavior, and if this song had existed about six years ago, i could have avoided some mistakes. such as fucking grown men with the names of power rangers. anywhos. i love the bass in this song. it's so vibey even as it's clearly about a painful experience.

# cock

**ReallyCreative** (10): slut shaming men is my favorite hobby

**Roxieloxie** (10): BUSY BOY BUSY BOY BUSY BUSY BUSY BOY

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): end him!!!

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The little laugh in the second verse almost made me give this my 11, I absolutely love songs that just cut into someone like this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the fucking ATTITUTDE this song has

**targetguest** (10): my go-to for the album

**urfavgalpal** (10): this one comes on and I just like my body starts involuntarily dancing I have to.  Really there isn’t much to say about their songs because their voices are so good.

**waluigiest** (10): the Instagram live where they explain the censored line is “it’s 4 oclock / you’re sending me too many pictures of your JUNK” always sends me

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): i like to think they giggle because he has an ugly dick

**shhhneak** (9.6): Obsessed with the vintage Disney record sounding intro and wish they had a song entirely like that.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.5): let's rise for the national anthem everyone

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): FUCK that second line sends me. and the baby's coming any day??? Fuck m*n

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): I love listening to this with headphones so I can hear are the little background details in the music

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): "it's 4 o'clock, your sending me too many pictures of your-" I don't get it, what's wrong with a guy sending you pictures of rocks?

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): so catchy

**Stryxen** (9.5): me when i have to do a single task in a day

**bulforster** (9.2): Okay but she definitely says "9 o'cock" right??

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The way they repeatedly sang "busy boy". Just heavenly. And oh, the fuckbois have been real quiet since CxH dropped this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): the production drags it down a bit but I love how they sell this song.

**iniekcja\_** (9): was it 4 AM or PM though? Cause that changes many things

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Okay but this song is personal to me because I’ve definitely been the Chloe/Halle in this situation before, unlike them though I def fell to the busy boy’s charms dsfkdsf. Also that fucking giggle with “You sending me too many pictures of your…” is sending meeee; this song is nothing but 10/10 drags

**jaztinax** (9): the “it’s 4 o’clock, you’re sending me too many pictures of your (chuckle)” sends me every time

**liberalitea** (9): this is gonna be an early out i fear, but this is a forgotten bop and top 5 of this album!!! the outro and 2nd chorus?!?! superior methinks

**seanderlust** (9): bussy boy

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): tea

**SupremeShani** (9): no this song is not called bussy boy stop that right now

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I’ve definitely never been in a situation like in the song but hey it’s so good I can immerse myself in that feeling! Screw that busy boy!

**astrologicalangel** (8.5): this is fucking hilarious

**bbfan132** (8.5): the second verse is excellent lmao

# cock

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This song is unrealistic… imagine having the option of being with Chloe or Halle and then you trifle with them. I can’t suspend my disbelief like that.

**juanolsen** (8.5): i don't have much to say about this song, but I really like it for some reason

**salivantsonority** (8.5): The Partition of this record. S'cute. Love the bubble noises.

**TiltControls** (8.5): hey busy boy

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Whewwww this one is so good too. Their vocal arrangements and quality really shine on this one and the lyrics are so deliciously cutting

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): "Sending me too many pictures of your chuckle"

**notarobot3675** (8.4): okay its been a minute since ive relistened to this song and i forgot how much fun it was, thanks to this rate for reintroducing me

**hakkerj** (8.3): Haha can’t say the c word!

**EnCaine** (8): i wonder what he was sending pictures of

**engifear** (8): Let CxH say… well, actually can I even say it?

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): As a busy busy boy myself, I feel very called out

**musical\_pyn** (8): bussy bussy boy, bussy boy

**nooodisaster** (8): They way they smack down these boys in such a classy way is just... chef's kiss.

# cock

**Oberionsynth** (8): not this boy sending them dick pics, why are the girls on grindr omg

**throwaway7650** (8): this grew on me, the instrumental is great

**Uberpigeon** (8): unsolicited dick pic anthem

**wasian-invasion** (8): busy boy you stay on my mind fulfill my fantasy

**zagreux** (8): https://azealia-banks.fandom.com/wiki/Bussy_Boy_(product)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): men suck wbk. For some reason although this bops it’s never clicked with me compared to the other songs on here.

**wavingwolves** (7.8): i love the adlibs on the second chorus soooo much but i wish the chorus itself was something more

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop, love the production

**pheromenos** (7.5): itsy bitsy boy

**Raykel** (7.5): pissy pissy boy pissy boy pissy pissy boy

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This song is so Destiny's Child/early Beyoncé

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): groovy! i dig it!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): This kind of starts the downward trend of the album, I do like the lyrics and the instrumental but it doesn't feel like the songwriting and production are as watertight as the beginning few tracks (minus Tipsy).

**Brendon-Urine** (7): busy doesn't sound like a word anymore

**CrimsonROSET** (7): if you STAY busy you don’t gotta GET busy

**fadedblue09** (7): Dips into filler territory. I don't really like songs too fixated on m*n.

**frogaranaman** (7): SAY COCK, BE BRAVE AND SAY IT

**jackisboredtoday** (7): the amount of times I’ve mistakenly read this title as bussy boy… :(

**KennyEarthman** (7): lmao queens of censoring cock

**ktajlili** (7): this lyrics are a lot but it's fun.

**poptartchill** (7): this one has been more of a grower

**rickikardashian** (7): bussy boy

**jsonphile** (6.5): weakest song on the album. “Busy boy busy busy boy” is just not that interesting of a hook. That said, the worst CxH song is still a decent song so good for them

# cock

**runaway3212** (6.5): the dick joke here is lazy

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): busybusyboybusyboybusybusyboy

**Vultuxe** (6.5): Filler. Doesn't stick out to me, don't hate, don't love it, won't want to go out of my way to hear it again. To me, as soon as one of their vocals or production miss, their songs devolve into being very generic and derivative pop-trap.

**jman457** (6.2): its catchy but seems very cliche lyric wise

**afs** (6): Getting big TLC and Destiny's Child vibes from this one. Also gets a little too repetitive.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): You'll never get deep inside. Ouch! I swear I can hear Beyoncé's voice by the end. I'm still not a fan of it.

**vagenda** (5): This song is just kinda annoying! Sorry!

**Vromega** (5): repetitive and boring

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): ok this is nice but a little slow and kinda forgettable on this particular album

Awkward_King: # cock

**nick1372** (4): I’ve found on this listen that I really dislike the songs on this record where the chorus is super repetitive. It feels like they are trying to go for some pop crossover tracks where it doesn’t really fit them?? The four o’clock line made me chuckle but it also feels oddly out of place

**pig-serpent** (4): There's not a whole lot to it outside of the bassline, and the chorus is annoying. It is a nice bassline tho.

This is honestly my favourite of the three CxH bonus tracks so I'm very sad it's the first out of them, it's so smooth and they just sound so good. I really like the clicks in the instrumentation, and clicks in music I usually find to be quite tacky so I'm happy they work here. The two of them also obviously sound absolutely amazing together on it.

# love RECEIVED

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE VOCALS

**Alumineous** (10): Transcendent. Vocals could be brought a bit further forward. But besides that, the vocals are on point and just exquisitely made. I never listened to the original, so take that what you will.

I WANNA BURN LIKE FIRE TONIGHT is so fucking addictive, a year and a half later this is still a fever dream of a collab, and I can't in the slightest imagine how this happened in some boardroom meeting somewhere, but I am sincerely glad it did. I know many people had this pegged as the winner of the bonus, which it was for a little very early on, but had just been falling ever since, and only *just* missed out on making Day 3 of the bonus.

# DO THE FUCKING VIDEO GAME VOCALS RATE

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, we need this on streaming

**akanewasright** (10): I wish this was on streaming woeis

**bookthieving** (10): unironically my favorite in the bonus rate

**Brendon-Urine** (10): iconic.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The fact this isn't on Spotify is a fucking crime. Nintendo when I catch you....just kidding that Mario theme park looks fucking cool. ;_;

**endcreditouilles** (10): the mario mashup makes this a perfect 10 i'm obsessed

**fairytalehigh** (10): frankly, this song's absence from streaming is fucking homophobic

**frogaranaman** (10): Nintendo put this on streaming challenge

**geraldinewww** (10): MARIO???? MARIO?????? HELLO?????????? i almost rated this an 8 until the mario theme kicked in. charli xcx for smash

**jackisboredtoday** (10): PLEASE PUT THIS ON STREAMING… even on iTunes I’d spend money to own it. Just let it be officially out, I want to own this song so badly

**jayjaysortagay** (10): gurl it was camp

**liberalitea** (10): this is such a fun bop!!!

**lolcevan** (10): this song is the best thing charli has ever been apart of

**pheromenos** (10): the way this is my highest-scored charli song in the rate lol

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Nintendo not only refusing to let this be put on streaming, but also removing it from YouTube is a hate crime

**runaway3212** (10): TOAD MAIN POP GIRL

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Charli + Nintendo is a fever dream combination that just works

**seanderlust** (10): gamers rise up!!

**targetguest** (10): literally not a joke I would listen to this before any song Indieheads sent us for the exchange rate

**TiltControls** (10): gamer queen

**vayyiqra** (10): The crossover we didn't know we needed. EDM peaked with this song. Am I being ironic right now? I'll never tell! (Okay maybe a little but it does bop.)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Charli Commits Tax Fraud

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Put it on Spotify challenge

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Invented Disney land

**amiriteor** (9): gold coins everywhere

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Outsold that flop “Electric,” fuck you Katy Perry this is how you make a song for a video game franchise

**hikkaru** (9): this is better than anything else galantis has made in the past few years and deserved to be on streaming i literally hate nintendo so much

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): idc that they invented the ds or wii or Mario kart whatever the best thing Nintendo has ever done is put Charli on a Mario song

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Oh, that's a banger! The drop was a bit disappointing; I was expecting it to go bigger after that build up. Well, it's my first time listening to it, so now I know what to expect.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i want to fucking go so fucking bad

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9): I wonder how that song was made hahahha,this is pure serotonin

**racloves** (9): okay but I’ve seen videos of the land at universal Japan and it looks incredible I need to visit

**Roxieloxie** (9): honestly i just wanna now how they decided on getting charli for this. I dont know if i like this song or if i just really like mario and really want to go to super nintendo land

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Bop bop bop but the video is ruined for me because every time Corey from Big Brother 18 is on the screen I think “hey that’s Corey from Big Brother 18” and it takes me out of the magical Nintendo experience

**skargardin** (9): we love VGV rate promo

**SupremeShani** (9): super fucking mario, gaymers and their enteral obsession with nintendo found screaming

**bbfan132** (8.5): this unironically bops

**EnCaine** (8.5): luigi feat. charli xcx would be a world ending collab

**plastichaxan** (8.5): cuuute

**Vultuxe** (8.5): It's... good? It's actually really catchy. The lyrics are soulless but that's what promotional video game songs will be.

**Palutzel** (8.3): generic, but such a bop

**afs** (8): I wasn't expecting a Nintendo X Charli song. At all. But it's awfully fun albeit generic, and I'm into the Nintendo influence in it.

**astrologicalangel** (8): yes bitch

**oscarbrierley1** (8): cursed but great

**Raxxin** (8): giving this this score simply because of the mv

**throwaway7650** (8): omg I remember this coming out but I don't remember bopping to it... this is nice. love a good pop x gaming crossover

**waluigiest** (8): the idea of Charli recording this is very funny

**jsonphile** (7.5): what the hell is this and why do I actually kinda dig it

**notarobot3675** (7.5): this was super cute!

**celladonn** (7): Do the video game vocal rate

**ggal2020** (7): cue gaymer jokes

**martian\_pet** (7): cute ??::???,??::???

**musical\_pyn** (7): I love xcx world

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): It sends me that Mario is credited as a vocalist in the lyric video I watched

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Charli sampling Mario music walked so Post sampling the Ecruteak City theme could run

**bigbigbee** (6.5): It’s not BAD, but for a song about Mario, I feel like it lacks a lot of fun and creativity (until the original Mario theme comes in towards the end, but it’s too late). It just sounds like a mid 2010’s EDM song. Jump Up Superstar outsold HEAVILY.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): vgv rate impacT

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): omg i forgot this existed. something about charli and toad on peach's castle is extremely hilarious

**wavingwolves** (6.3): hey gaymers

# they targeted gamers

**jman457** (6.2): cute but also annoying

**jasannn** (6): Post Malone x Pokemon Collab outsold. This is just a basic edm song.

**KennyEarthman** (6): would play in the Super Mario movie trailer

**nootnoot781** (6): mario main pop girl

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): this is so fucking stupid

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Oh I'm doing VGV rate already?

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): this song is a mess

**iniekcja\_** (5): this sounds like it would be used in a soda commercial on tv, the Mario adlibs are cool though

**kirby31200** (5): Jump Up Superstar this is not. Everyone involved could do better

**thedoctordances1940** (4): I know it's Nintendo promo but the mario sound effects just don't work at all and while the sample of Mario's theme isn't as bad, it still clashes instrumentally. At least the rest of the song is alright I guess.

**urfavgalpal** (3.4): no offense to charli but I think her voice sounds kinda bad here

**engifear** (3): This song already sounds dated

**pig-serpent** (3): I mean good for Charli for being asked to make this, but this doesn't capture what I like about her music. It kinda sucks.

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): this song is my worst nightmare.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): not the charli and toad collab we deserve

I hated this song ?? And for what ?? Like I remember why I didn't like this song, I found the vocal melodies quite annoying and the rest of it kinda bland but it clicked at some point very early in scores coming in and I upped this from like a 3 to an 8. It's still far from my favourite but it's just so <333 sweet, and nice to hear.

---

# pb's ballot was overall rly good and this was no exception

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): okay so hear me out. this song made me cry the first time i heard it. as someone who lives alone and struggles with friendship because i'm mentally ill, this song was a balm for some pain i hadn't really dealt with. i think that it's just such a lovely song, and it won't go far in this rate, but i adore it. it's just like a warm hug of a song. 'i had to learn to love me lately' - and i like to think that i did.

# however they were lonely in giving this song their 11

**1998tweety** (10): holy shit this is amazing what the fuck im floating

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): “It don’t have to be lonely being alone” is a sentiment that took me a very long time to internalize and understand and it’s something that I still struggle with.

**Alumineous** (10): They brought my mood down with Overwhelmed and suddenly, I'm energized.

**bespectacIed** (10): Second best song on the album and my most played. The harmonies!!!

**conceptualromance** (10): I appreciate Chloe and Halle making a song for us lonely bitches

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really like this song from the production and vocal layering to it’s message. I like to listen to it when I’m sad. Chloe’s vocals are particularly good here.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): It feels like Chloe and Halle are reaching out to me as my friends asking me if I am doing okay but through a song. I love this song so much because I have my moments of being lonely which I hate sometimes so I feel very seen with this song. Thank you so much Chloe and Halle for making this song because this song feels so therapeutic to me.

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the sensual, atmospheric vibe. The message of this hits a lot especially last year.

**fairytalehigh** (10): my favorite track on the album. it's warm, the beat knocks, the harmonies sparkle, the "you don't have to be lonely being alone" hook is perfect. i needed this in 2020

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): There’s so something interesting about hearing a song about loneliness sung by two people but it kinda makes sense because the song is, at its core, about how loneliness is often more a state of mind than a physical state; you can have other voices singing with you and not even hear them. As someone who struggles a lot with pushing people away out of apathy more than anything else this song really resonates with me and I hope y’all are kind to it.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): it don’t have to be lonely being alone is so simple but omg if that doesn’t hit

**ignitethephoenix** (10): me a single person in a pandemic taking in every word of this song. One of my personal favorite deep cuts here

**liberalitea** (10): one of the best deep cuts on this album and gets me emotional :(

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): this is still so underappreciated

**ReallyCreative** (10): their absolute best song, I get CHILLS listening to this song even a year later. The vocals, the production, the atmosphere! the energy they created in the studio could power the entire world for 50 years but the GP just doesn't care!

**Roxieloxie** (10): king hates this song but he's irrelevant so let me talk about it instead. this might be one of my top 5 songs on the album, they we're evil for this song 'who are you when no one's watching' 'arent you afraid of the silence , arent you scared of what you'll find in it' are you fucking kidding me, i want to cry. again the timing that this album came out, no longer being in a dorm room cause of covid and just the general anxiety that comes with living and being black and trying to have your coming of age era while at the same time having to be this huge social justice advocate and try and dismantle oppression. Its alot, and ive found myself just going to bed alot later , usually im the last person up and its literally feels like all my anxieties are choking me and holding me down. I just feel so lonely all the time and this song captures it in a way that i cant even bring myself to try and convey

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song feels like a hug

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is my go to panic attack/depression song

**wavingwolves** (10): please close the sub if this doesn't make to day 3 when it's like the second best song on this album

**welcome2thejam** (10): Instantly hooked me in. Love the pacing of this! That first minute has such a killer momentum and doesn't let up throughout. Favorite song on the album, easily.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.7): self-sufficiency bop

**nick1372** (9.5): a banger in every sense of the word!!

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I know the themes of loneliness explored here aren't really unique or anything, but I feel like they captured the complexities of feeling alone here well enough that it hits hard enough emotionally. It's comforting, in a sad way, that makes this one of my favorites of the album.

**endcreditouilles** (9.4): everyone rise for the endcreditouilles national anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): This song is just so pretty, all the layered vocal harmonies are gorgeous, it's a really chill, pleasant, relaxing track

**afs** (9): Finally something leaning more towards pop, and they nail it, with a little nitpick that the chorus starts off a little weak.

**akanewasright** (9): I didn’t used to like this song but like... it’s so soothing. I’ll be sad when this goes out day 1.

**cremeebrulee** (9): ended crj’s solo

**musical\_pyn** (9): the second best song about being alone in this rate

**NotWith10000Men** (9): "it don't have to be lonely being alone" queens speaking my language

**Raxxin** (9): too relatable...

**salivantsonority** (9): Groovy; I really, really like this track. Can imagine bumping it while cruising down the highway.

**SmileAndTears** (9): a cute moment

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): always gets stuck in my head for hours after i listen to it

**vayyiqra** (9): I wish this weren't relatable. :pensive:

**urfavgalpal** (8.7): I don’t ever hear people really talking about this one but it’s one of my favorites.  I really like Chloe and Halle.

**anothertown** (8.5): ??

**hakkerj** (8.5): This song brings back vivid memories of me driving to Dunkin to get my iced coffee at 10 AM during work hours.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): They really wrote this song for the girlies going through it during quarantine huh

**kirby31200** (8.5): Don't be wasting your life getting sooooo low

**throwaway7650** (8.5): I love the "it don't have to be lonely being alone" line

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This hits harder when Halle posts those sad insta stories from her London hotel room

**bbfan132** (8): i like the production!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The hook to this is so good but I do wish it had more of a substantial bridge.

**camerinian** (8): god these harmonies are just gorgeous

**CrimsonROSET** (8): WHY ARE ALL OF YOU CALLING ME OUT FOR BEING LONELY THIS IS LIKE THE THIRD RATE IN A ROW CAN I HAVE SOME ROOM TO BREATHE

**juanolsen** (8): i really forgot how this song sounded,ni find it cute but it's not a highlight for me

**Oberionsynth** (8): pls i'll just take anyone at this point, girlies where y'all at (lmao @ me taking a song ab "it's ok to be lonely" and using it to talk ab how desperate i am)

**oscarbrierley1** (8): obligatory me in lockdown comment

**seanderlust** (8): "it don't have to be lonely being alone" SPILL

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): I love the vulnerability of this section of the album. This is a bit chiller than the first half of the album but is just as catchy and ethereal

**zagreux** (8): relatable queens

**jman457** (7.7): Justin Bieber is shook

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): kinda funny how it follows Overwhelmed cause this one is pretty underwhelming

**just\_thonking** (7.5): ICarly theme song

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): sorry cant relate im never alone :)

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Not a bad song but again, kind of the same songwriting issues and lack of energy and power that had punctuated the first half of the album.

**jasannn** (7): Chill bop but the stagnant vocals and production is holding it back.

**skargardin** (7): This is a bit weirdly placed in the album coming from the interlude but its good

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Very chill and very cool!

THIS IS SUCH A FUCKING GOOD CLOSER I'M SO SORRY, one of my absolute favourites from the album. It's almost nothing like anything else from the album and yet feels to really wrap the project up well. I like the hook line of it, "won't you live tonight (like the rest of your life)", I like it as in after we've just danced and cried through this whole album that we can hold our head up and go 'alright there's still a whole night ahead of us, let's make the fucking most of it'

---

# yes we WILL live tonight like the rest of our lives

**akanewasright** (10): Everything about this song BANGS

**amiriteor** (10): would be another 11

**bespectacIed** (10): smash

**conceptualromance** (10): love the way they sing this one

**CrimsonROSET** (10): for the rest of my life? I mean why not

**CritneySpearz** (10): honestly perfect way to end the album

**frogaranaman** (10): underrated

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ve heard this song described as “Disney Channel” and that’s a compliment bitch

**hakkerj** (10): This song goes HARD

**IIIHenryIII** (10): That's a ten, with no doubt! It's perfect!

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): Ending the album on an absolute BANGER

**nootnoot781** (10): nah the hate this song gets in unwarranted, monarchs rise up!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this chorus is like crack to me

**plastichaxan** (10): underrated

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i want more of this nu-metal sound from them. I want more of this raw, angry, almost cocky sound from them. I think that they've created something in this track that is very different, and it's just so interesting to listen to because it's so relatively out there. I think this is a good natural evolution of their sound from their first album to here, and it's just such a good song.

**ReallyCreative** (10): rolling on the yloor laughing

**Roxieloxie** (10): The live version of this FUCKS SO HARD but im also just obsessed with it in general

**salivantsonority** (10): Absolutely magnificent bop; I'm also just a sucker for this vibe of track.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i personally think this is a great closer and encapsulates the essence of the album

**Uberpigeon** (10): I think this is the most under appreciated song on the album. The production is so cool and fresh and the song has this scary haunting vibe. It makes for a great closer (ft. halsey)

**waluigiest** (10): it’s crunchy and weird and I’m obsessed with it

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; if I could give more than one 11...

**artzpop** (9.5): I WILL live tonight and for the rest of my life

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): youknowyouknowyouknow this track fine like that

**SupremeShani** (9.5): Okay, I honestly have no idea why the song is titled like this, but hey, hey, why don't you come on my wave now?

**urfavgalpal** (9.3): I think I really underrate this song tbh. Cause almost every time I listen to the album I’m taken back by how good this song is

**EnCaine** (9.1): giving this a +0.1 so i can nudge it just above do it and tipsy. it feels right. this is a total banger

**anothertown** (9): this sounds like MIA

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): so underrated and bombastic literally a perfect ending

**jman457** (9): I really fuck with this, it kind of reminds me of home with you by Fka twigs though

**juanolsen** (9): great way to close the album

**Oberionsynth** (9): "yolo" found dead in a ditch, "royl" is my favorite acronym now

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a very interesting melody and wholesome concept. A good closer.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): the chorus on this feels so heavenly

**ktajlili** (8): bop city

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun outro!!!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): I like the wordplay in this one

# people put a lot of stock into the album closer huh

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): After such a strong run of songs this one kind of falls a little flat, especially as a closer

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's a good song but Wonder What She Thinks Of Me should have been the closer and I feel like this suffers a bit coming after that

**1998tweety** (7): i dont really care for this sorry, its not bad though

**astrologicalangel** (7): just a little too repetitive

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): It was like this year I figured out what ROYL stood for, whoops. I don’t like the chorus of voices that much even if I like the idea of them. I like the lower voices here and it’s a good wrap up of the album

**jasannn** (7): .

**KennyEarthman** (7): just found out that ROYL stands for Rest of Your Life and not Royal or smth

**martian\_pet** (7): i like it but dont get the hype

**nick1372** (7): hey hey

**pig-serpent** (7): I appreciate how different this song sounds from the rest of the album.

**wasian-invasion** (7): kinda underwhelming for the last track tbh

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): A pretty lukewarm finish to the album tbh, I do like the choral vocals and again, not bad at all, but still pretty underwhelming compared to the first half.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Rolling on the Yoor Laughing

**throwaway7650** (6.5): it's not a skip but I don't really feel anything about this song, kind of a weak note to end the album on unfortunately. anyway stream hazy

**afs** (6): More hip-hop with some strange things going on. Peculiar closer.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Beyonce is speaking through them. I'm not crazy about it but I get the appeal.

**Leixander** (6): gets a bit annoying with the repetition (ironic coming from a charli fan heh)

**Stryxen** (6): why did this actually make me laugh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A pretty good song, but the verses aren’t that great...

**Vromega** (6): awful instrumentation and lazy production. At least their gorgeous vocals remain

**fadedblue09** (5): Doesn't really do justice as a closing track. Feels unnecessarily ominous for some reason.

**zagreux** (5): this was kinda underwhelming as a final track

**ImADudeDuh** (4): why do most of the closers this rate suck

**SmileAndTears** (4): Didn't dig too deep into the lyrics so I'm probably missing something but what a weird song to close your with

**Vultuxe** (0): Honestly, it physical hurts how bad this is, there is nothing redeemable to me, it sounds totally different than the rest of the album. Sorry.

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT2_F-1esPk

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a perfect closer

**Alumineous** (10): They made up for the horrible intro with a dope-ass closer. Love this one.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): 10YL, stellar closer!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a glorious, fun and great closer

**runaway3212** (10): the best closer of this rate

**wavingwolves** (9.8): this is actually such a perfect closer to this marvellous album

**pat-rickstar** (9.7): Awesome closer

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): they stick the fucking landing on this one, what a great closer! the chorus is one of their best

**CarlieScion** (9): a good closer!!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is an amazing closer to this perfectly consistent album. This closer alone made me curious to check out their debut album which Chloe said that this song is a callback to their humble beginnings. I'll definitely check it out.

**liberalitea** (9): this is a great closer

**musical\_pyn** (9): great closer, I love the low chorus

Those blaring synths in the intro my god they're so good. Fun fact, I legitimately didn't know this and Felt This Way were lyrically almost identical until actual months after Side B came out and I saw someone mention it in a thread talking about something like this and was like "...huh". But alas, there goes Carly's second top song, I'm still quite surprised at how much Comeback and This Love Isn't Crazy flopped, but I never really doubted Summer Love would be the top. Here's to hoping it lasts a little while longer!!!

---

# Stay Away Supremacy

**cashewconstellation** (11): this song can best be described as an euphoric explosion, just AAAAAAAAAAAAA, the "touch. Touch. TOUCH ME" PART? HDSHSDAJDSA

**1998tweety** (10): the better of the 2, this song bops so hard

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s amazing how this continues the story right after Felt This Way, only Carly Rae Jepsen queen of the swords could do this.

**bespectacIed** (10): The pussy popping drug sniffing sister of Felt This Way that I equally love

**conceptualromance** (10): this is the superior version imo. The production supports the urgency/intensity of the lyrics much better

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song is a gay banger and a half omfg I love it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Carly was like, "so you like Felt This Way, um? Let me just change the arrangement and some of the lyrics to make it a total bop" She's one of a very short list of artists who could do this perfectly!

**iniekcja\_** (10): pop goddess yes!

**KennyEarthman** (10): I'm a sucker for pop song like this

**ManofOranges** (10): The more exciting companion to Felt This Way and delicious to the ear all the same.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I am obsessed with this song, it is just Carly doing what she does best. An absolute joyous bop.

**rickikardashian** (10): this and felt this way are brilliant idc idc

**seeyanever** (10): This is brilliant, don’t pretend it’s anything else. Carly’s mind? On a different level.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This one is the high energy sister who was valedictorian but also would go clubbing with you on a tuesday

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a better version of felt this way

**Turpamutteri** (10): bop

**vagenda** (10): An absolute gem of Carly’s discography and a sublime pairing with Felt This Way. Her releasing both of these songs back to back is one of my favourite moments on a pop album ever. People throw around the phrase “her mind” a lot but, truly, honestly, her mind

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a very well-produced song! Underrated.

**waluigiest** (10): WHEW when this starts right after Felt This Way I feel it. It dials the energy up and creates this totally desperate, explosive track. Amazing

**welcome2thejam** (10): The cooler Daniel.

**welcometoNY** (10): the prechorus is insanely good

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Queen of repurposing songs in a new and creative way

**zagreux** (10): dua take notes

**urfavgalpal** (9.8): I love love love this song especially the echoey-ness of it and the syncopation going on.  It’s a really fun track and one of my favorites on the album.  It’s of those songs that if I get it in my head I have to listen to it immediately and now I have to listen to it immediately

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): this song is Chanel #1 and Felt This way is Chanel #5

**jasannn** (9.5): An Indiehead comment during the popheads exchange: "Omg, even the Carly song is horny."

**nick1372** (9.5): It’s really not fair to not rate these as a packaged set, but they are both incredible in their own way

**Qustomar** (9.5): This feels like a very classic-style, CRJ pop perfection song. Doesn't make sense to me why this didn't open the album? The album doesn't feel like it truly begins until Stay Away.

**plastichaxan** (9.3): the best song in this album to say “stay away”

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): I love the chorus on this, definitely a step up from Felt This Way even if this vibe will be a little repetitive through the record

**afs** (9): lmao I was floored when I realised this was just a more fun and energetic version of the same lyrics of the previous track, normally I'd give it 8 but extra point for the clever idea

**bbfan132** (9): a summer bop!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): It took me a few listens but this goes so well with Felt This Way. Listening to them back to back is so satisfying.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): superior

**juanolsen** (9): paired with the previous song this demonstrates why Carly is a genius

**just\_thonking** (9): Love the felt this way/stay away duo. They are twins :)

**mudkip1** (9): the production in the verse sounds like the noise that lego bricks made when you built them in the video games

**nooodisaster** (9): Sexy, dynamic, this one is surfing out into the ocean and catching the wave that'll take you crashing to shore.

**runaway3212** (9): the beginning sounds like an ad

**thedoctordances1940** (9): ...you know something like this.

**Vromega** (9): In less than 15 seconds, stay away reveals itself to be the superior version. And then comes the chorus which is an absolute bop. Proud and confident voice, upbeat synth sounds, so many great elements on this song.

**Vultuxe** (9): A different song with the same lyrics as the one before it is obviously cute and quirky but that aside, Stay Away is a total banger, no complaints here.

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): That POP in the second prechorus is so fucking good, gives me an eargasm every time

**hakkerj** (8.7): the way I freaked out when I heard this song for the first time… HER MIND

**Palutzel** (8.6): felt this way's superior sister

**geraldinewww** (8.5): is it the same song as felt this way. yes. is it a bigger bop. also yes

**nootnoot781** (8.5): #teamstayaway

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.2): The way Carly repeatedly singing "away" is heaven to my ears.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): boppy

**akanewasright** (8): the bimbification of Felt This Way

**anothertown** (8): sorry i JUST realized that this and felt this way are the same song… that was not needed

**EnCaine** (8): this is like if the church from my TLIC comment covered Felt This Way and somehow it's increasing the score. they did have a single banger they would play sometimes so it makes sense

**hunnybee12** (8): the bright, full chorus makes the song interesting in comparison to felt this way

**jaztinax** (8): yeah i like this one better than felt this way

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): With bops like these....you're right Carly, I can't stay away

**poptartchill** (8): the first time I realized what she did was a mind blowing experience

**liberalitea** (7.5): i think i would've liked this more if it didn't come right after Felt This Way. Tracklist kind of ruined it for me because those 2 sort of blend together, but i do prefer this because the chorus is much better.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.1): it's an upgrade but like still kinda bland

**RandomHypnotica** (7): I appreciate this as the superior version of Felt This Way

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): definitely prefer this more hard-hitting track to Felt This Way

**ktajlili** (6): this is less boring, but still generic

Awkward_King: # Felt This Way Supremacy

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): felt this way outsold.

**wasian-invasion** (9): the production feels more generic than felt this way, but still gets points for the fun concept

**artzpop** (8.7): everyone wants a familiar fruit moment or whatever

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): i don't like it as much as "felt this way" but love how she reshapes the song into something so different, we stan a recycling queen

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): good, but felt this way stays winning in my book

**skargardin** (8): I like the Felt This Way callback a lot

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ok the chorus is fantastic

**throwaway7650** (8): this grew on me

**jman457** (7.7): Another lovely synthpop jam. Its what she does best

**wavingwolves** (7.6): this pales in comparison with felt this way sooo much but it's still a bop

**camerinian** (7.5): This is the better version of the lyrics and melody used in Felt This Way, but on the album it's weakened by the back to back presentation. This works so much better in a playlist, which is kinda sad.

**jsonphile** (7.5): wait this is just the same song

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): carly really released an album about how much she wanted to get dicked down during a pandemic

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): it's really fun but a bit too generic to get a higher score

**seanderlust** (7.3): REMIX!!!!!! airhorn sound

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): Not as good as Felt This Way

**Alumineous** (7): Eh, prefer the sexy version better.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): See Felt This Way

**musical\_pyn** (6): see felt this way

**SupremeShani** (6): Felt This Way's talented, but less charismatic sister.

**Uberpigeon** (6): ok its clever that its the same lyrics I like that

**fadedblue09** (5): So she rehashed Felt This Way but made it more generic and soulless? How groundbreaking.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): carly putting two songs that interpolate each other on the same album really ruined both of them

**NotWith10000Men** (5): I think my problem with carly is that her voice does nothing for me. it's not bad, it's not great, like her music.

**Oberionsynth** (5): the way i was so confused when she started saying the same lyrics, i went back and forth on the tracks like what is happening T.T anyway felt this way is better, fight me

**salivantsonority** (5): Alright...

**bulforster** (4): There's a reason she remade this. It's just kinda bland and lacking the jubilant warmth I expect from a Carly bop.

**steelstepladder** (4): There's standard of quality here because it IS Carly but... this really does feel like a bunch of B sides going against three of the best albums of the year.

**pig-serpent** (2): This is every mediocre dance remix ever. The echo on the clock drums are like an annoying itch that I can't scratch, and overall the song is a not so great combination of empty, obnoxious, and bland.

# frog trying to get on the banner

**frogaranaman** (7): this sounds super similar to “Felt This Way”

It's really haunting tbh, Halle's vocals are so ethereal but singing about such a haunting topic ist quite the juxtaposition. Taking the position of the other woman is really interesting and I don't think this would be the same song without it in the slightest, so I appreciate that they did, even if I know some people aren't the keenest on cheating songs.

---

# feminist brain off

**jaztinax** (11): my favorite since first listen. the storytelling, the perspective, the production and the constant build-up to the end - it’s all perfect

**xaviersi** (11): a song that I relate to having been the other man before on top of being their best vocal performances in this album

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This leaves me speechless every time. THE EMOTIONAL DELIVERY.

**akanewasright** (10): I hold this song extra close to my heart because it helped me distinguish Chloe and Halle’s voices

**bespectacIed** (10): There was a discussion thread at the time I was doing this rate about songs that people don't like the message of, and this was one of the answers. Because it's about cheating. In an album named "ungodly hour". Lmao.

**bookthieving** (10): the way this song fucking builds!!!!!!!!!! those heavy synth hits are so good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i think she’s beautiful

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is easily the best song on the album with its strong lyricism, storytelling, and vocals. The song feels so perfectly cinematic that I can imagine a whole storyline with a bunch of characters in my head. The cherry on top is the amazing production and CxH's heavenly vocals. Ugh, I better not see this song out before Day 3, or else I am questioning this subreddit's taste.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My favorite song on this album, their harmonies are OUT OF THIS WORLD here.

**engifear** (10): The harmonies and production on this song just make me instantly ascend

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I can potentially see this track being divisive but it’s one of my absolute favorites in the whole rate and I very nearly gave it my 11. Placing themselves in the role of “the other woman” was a risky move and I think they were smart to compensate by making this track sound so classy so no one can say that they were being trashy. The gentle intro, the delicate vocal arrangement, the theatrical strings, they really bring you into the world of this character in a way that helps you see past the knee-jerk moralizing reaction to explore the more human, emotional side of the situation. This is the best their vocals sound on the whole album too, I love how they slowly unravel as the song goes on until they completely untether themselves on the bridge, before reigning it all back in and closing out the song just as composed as they were when it began.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Cheating QUEENS

**iniekcja\_** (10): MY SIDE HOE ANTHEM, it's genuinely an amazing song though and deserved to get the grammy

**jsonphile** (10): my favorite on the album. Chloe and Halle just sound angelic here, and not gonna lie this song is...kinda hot.

**KennyEarthman** (10): they both wrote and produced this. it's an amazing song, an album highlight

**musical\_pyn** (10): If this song gets tanked because it's from the perspective of "the other woman" I'm tanking evermore

**Oberionsynth** (10): this is everything illicit affairs wanted to be

**oscarbrierley1** (10): I hope this doesn't get booted down the ranking for being slow because that would be a hate crime

**Roxieloxie** (10): SO TELL ME TELL ME BABY , god the harmonies on this song and that tiny desk concert

**shhhneak** (10): wig in the stratosphere.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i was never a big fan for this kind of r&b song, but sometime i do find myself enjoying one or two and i think this one is one of them.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): gorgeous

**SupremeShani** (10): I know some people here don't like songs about cheating and adultery, but this song immediately stood out to me on this album. The stripped back production with the soft guitars and warbling synths just works so good with the girls harmonizing about such a risque message. Speaking of harmonizing, these are some of the best vocals the twins serve on the whole album.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ok i get that ppl won't like the topic of this song but i think it's absolutely stunning and the bridge gives me goosebumps everytime. potentially the best vocals on the album (which is saying alot)

**Tedyonce** (10): deserved the Grammy

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This song is just absolutely beautiful. The lyrics are probably the best on the album, telling a really compelling story from the perspective of the other girl, essentially painting themselves as a form of antagonist, which isn't all that common in music. Add to that some of their best vocal performances, the high notes they hit are absolutely angelic, and some of the best production and songwriting and you've got the best song on the album

**throwaway7650** (10): I love how this song builds

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is gay idgaf what anyone has to say about it

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): this build knows how to fuck

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.6): loveee a song about being the other woman

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): what the fuck? this BLEW me away. I was just not ready for the mix, everything coming together at the end... wow. Just wow.

**juanolsen** (9.3): interesting concept and good execution, absolutely love it

**plastichaxan** (9.3): me @ hosts when i submit my scores

**amiriteor** (9): I'm suspending my feminist beliefs bc this song goes so fucking hard

**hakkerj** (9): Love the vocals on this track

**IIIHenryIII** (9): That's fire. I can't get enough of their harmonies. They sound so perfect together. Meeeeeeeeeee! Meeeeeeeeeee! Chef's kiss!

**jasannn** (9): This beautiful ballad has the best vocals in the album.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Last 3 songs on this album are just.....so perfect. Could listen to the 3 on loop forever

**rosecoloreds** (9): if i was straight that'd be my cheating anthem

**seanderlust** (9): oh work. the other woman banger

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This feels classic

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Me about my crush’s girlfriend who doesn’t think of me

**Vromega** (9): would be a fantastic Disney song

**waluigiest** (9): love how it flips the infidelity tropes in a lot of ways

**jman457** (8.8): Soring vocals on this makes it one of my favs.

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): narrator deserves better

**1998tweety** (8.5): beautiful

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.5): It’s interesting to get a song about being the other woman. “You’ve done this before so who are you to judge” is a really pointed defensive line in the song that’s interesting to me because you wouldn’t be thinking about what the wife/gf thinks if you weren’t judging yourself. I really like the emotions in the song

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): love the perspective of being the other girl here. They both sound so haunting and great

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): not a huge fan of the disney princess vocal at the beginning, but i love the premise and the execution otherwise

**afs** (8): Normally I don't listen to lyrics much, but this one particularly stood out to me for its theme and maturity.

**artzpop** (8): Well I think she thinks it is a bit weird to make a song about it

**bbfan132** (8): pretty ballad, definitely gets better in the second half

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Really came for SZA’s Heaux Anthems crown with this track

**martian\_pet** (8): Infidelity bop, Unfaithful and The Weekend found crying in a corner

**nick1372** (8): probably the best vocal performance on the album. Love the concept and it’s executed really well

**nooodisaster** (8): I wondered if this was an old classic, so I was shocked when I found out it was solely written and produced by Chloe and Halle. Mad props.

**pig-serpent** (8): Strong vocal showcase with good melodies. I'm normally not into this type of thing but this is actually really good.

**poptartchill** (8): This was one of my favorites first listen and it's still great!

**Uberpigeon** (8): Who doesnt love a song about being the other woman. Beautiful singing from Halle on this one too

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): I love the vocals on this so much, the last couple songs on this album get so ethereal

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): a nice chill one to start bringing the album to a close

Awkward_King: # balladphobes

**pat-rickstar** (8): Still good but a bit overrated imo

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Another fine performance but admittedly not as interesting as the rest.

**urfavgalpal** (7.1): This is a beautiful song that would probably get a higher score if it were not going up against the rest of my Most Played Songs of 2020 playlist but when I think about it in the scope of the songs here I just don’t enjoy this song as much as the rest.  Their vocals really shine here but I prefer a song I can dance to

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): A pretty good ballad for sure with probably the best vocal performance of the album, but doesn't feel as compelling as Don't Make It Harder On Me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is really well built and has some of the best lyrics on the album I just don't find myself returning to it as much as other songs.

**conceptualromance** (7): this is the only song on the record I’m not all that fond of

**frogaranaman** (7): idk girl you know as much as I do

**salivantsonority** (7): Gorgeous vocals but the song itself isn't that impactful to me.

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I didn't hate this one, but not drawn to it either. I wish I had more to say. It picks up in the later half.

**camerinian** (6): call it balladphobia if u want but uh maybe also call it mixing that doesn't get close to the swell it wants

**CarlieScion** (6): v cute production

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.9): happy they got a grammy nom for this but im bored yall

**SmileAndTears** (5): So how is this song supposed to make me feel like exactly?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): this song feels like it could come from a musical

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): I don’t mind it. but its giving me very Broadway musical sad female protagonist explanation song and that kinda knocks it down for me

# cheating is apparently not pog D:

**cremeebrulee** (9): i had to take a point off because i really dont love cheating songs but FUCK do they make it sound so good. i love how much softer the instrumental is, because their vocals really carry this song.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): great song, trifling message

**ReallyCreative** (9): the subject material is meh but the girls do what they do best; serve, fiercely.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Yeah yeah, cheating is bad kids, but god this song is so tragic I can’t help but feel bad for the girls...

**liberalitea** (7.5): this song is so haunting but again because of the message I can't really give it a higher score even though based on the vocals alone this is a 10

**notarobot3675** (7.5): this is a GORGEOUS song but... i also hate songs about cheating :/ so

# great

**runaway3212** (8): great

A moment of silence for this Carly. It pass away. It had beautiful album. It had kinda been a meme ever since this rate was announced that Carly would flop and miss Day 3... but I think it actually happening is a bit of a shock and especially her literally being #17, that's gotta sting. Summer Love is great and I kinda regret not giving it a 10, I love the instrumental break in the middle, I only remember that because I am listening to it as I write this and it just came on and I forgot how good it was, but it's a highlight of the song. I think I'm gonna blast the fuck out of this this Summer.

---

# they tried to save carly, but it was too late

**artzpop** (11): idc i listen to this song every day and it hasn't aged one bit

**Turpamutteri** (11): This is a great summer song that I listened to a lot last summer

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A discography highlight. It’s what singlehandedly makes Dedicated Side B superior to Side A.

**Alumineous** (10): Another grower. For Carly Rae standards, this is as sultry as it gets. Also, I got a bit of ABBA vibes in that instrumental bridge.

**anothertown** (10): everybody say thank you patrik berger

**conceptualromance** (10): I imagine this is what Disco Sweat would’ve been like </3

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love the guitar. I really like the various things she does with her voice here

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The lyrics, the vocals, and the production is so damn sexy and summer-y. This is definitely the mature Carly that I was exactly expecting and she served perfectly.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): DO THE NU-DISC... oh.

**endcreditouilles** (10): the way she says 'summer love' makes my soul leave my body and reenter through my foofer

**frogaranaman** (10): that fucking BASSSSS

**hakkerj** (10): The real song of 2020, reminds me of a Tame Impala song

**hunnybee12** (10): the only track from side b that stuck out to me at release and that I still listen to

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my favorite from the album, love how fun and sensual it is. A nice groovy bop

**jasannn** (10): Combining summer and disco, this song was designed for me to love.

**Leixander** (10): Always reimagining this as a pop-rock song whenever I listen to it.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): that sax

**nootnoot781** (10): gayme impala. i hope she ventures more into this direction, i love this sound on her!!

**pat-rickstar** (10): Need Carly to make more songs with this sound

**plastichaxan** (10): she's so smart putting the best song after the worst one to make this seem better

**poptartchill** (10): I didn't notice this one for a while but now believe me I did

**Qustomar** (10): OH THIS IS THE SERVE.

**ReallyCreative** (10): that guitar, that little string lick, holy shit she was in her element with this one

**rosecoloreds** (10): this should've been on dedicated

**runaway3212** (10): so true

**seanderlust** (10): this is a highlight of the album

**skargardin** (10): this better not be underrated

**targetguest** (10): I drove from PA to Florida in May and was in Florida when this album dropped. Nothing like a northeasterner getting to drive with the windows down to a song like this for their entire quarantine

**throwaway7650** (10): after several listens I couldn't not give this a 10. imo this could fit on aly & AJ's new album (stream ATOTBGYUOYFGYOATITS)

**vayyiqra** (10): An 11 contender but I predict a Carlycide in this rate. Sad!

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the pussy part of the album and we love it

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): The guitar...

**zagreux** (10): carly rae and the feeling. name a more iconic duo.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Dammit Carly you know i cant resist a good bass

**urfavgalpal** (9.7): Another great track.  Honestly I don’t get why people hate on this album?  Most of these songs are really good.  There’s a really weird energy to this that I really dig.  It sounds like a memory which probably makes no sense but I’m going with it.  There are a few songs on this album when as soon as I hear the first few notes by body just automatically starts dancing and this is one of those.

**1998tweety** (9.5): im levitating

**just\_thonking** (9.5): I love Tame Impala

**Vultuxe** (9.5): Summer Love is lush and vibrant, it's an excellent song. I wish the bridge was more than a repeat of the chorus, but can't win them all.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): brb manifesting a summer of vaccinated love

**notarobot3675** (9.4): another one of my favourites from the album. it feels very different for carly and i think she pulled off this particular vibe well, would really like to hear more of this from her in the future!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): Sounds like exactly what it says on the label, and I love that!

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Another pretty good rager in the tracklist, nothing much to say. Love the guitars

**afs** (9): More funk, but this is executed SO much better. Certified summer banger.

**akanewasright** (9): [the bass riff...](https://imgur.com/a/fKs6FaX)

**bbfan132** (9): tame impala but better

**celladonn** (9): Unrestrained summer fun

**IIIHenryIII** (9): It feels like something from the past but it sounds so modern. Future Nostalgia could never (I just really don't like that album at all, I'm so sorry).

**KennyEarthman** (9): groovy and funky

**nick1372** (9): Best production on the album but the lyrics are a bit underwritten

**Stryxen** (9): i feel like i could make this song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): really smooth vocal delivery

**vagenda** (8.9): Kevin Parker was gonna send a cease and desist but he was too busy bopping Fake Mona Lisa: 8.7 I know Carly doesn’t actually say the F-word in this…….but she could

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): i'm embarrassed to say i didn't really vibe with this song at first but NOW? incredible, amazing, showstopping, spectacular

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): love how carly released a better tame impala song in 2020 than half the actual 2020 tame impala album

**ggal2020** (8.5): ready to have a vaccinated girl summer soundtracked by this song

**juanolsen** (8.5): cute bop, nothing else to say

**kirby31200** (8.5): The Less I Love the Summer

**shhhneak** (8.5): Show us the location of Disco Sweat’s body Carly

**jman457** (8.3): This kind of reminds me of a Tame Impala song, and im not mad about it.

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): funky

**CrimsonROSET** (8): got this feeling in my booooody clap

**jackisboredtoday** (8): i’m basic what can i say

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): The bop of the summer….that never was. Robbed of Summer Love 2020 because of COVID hurts afted being robbed of Cruel Summer 2019 due to......poor single choice

**liberalitea** (8): it's a really fresh song and i like the guitar in the chorus

**oscarbrierley1** (8): fun

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Everyone made fun of Dua last year for being a bad disco pastiche but this song kinda feels more pastiche-y to me. Still good, but derivative I guess?

**Vromega** (8): Perfect verses, but I expected a bit more from the chorus. the end is boring too

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the groove in this is really nice. I like how the melody dips on the second "all the time"

**SupremeShani** (7.5): It perfectly captures the mood of a summer night, the guitar work, synths, and little string breakdown make me nostalgic for some reason. Her vocals have this hint of desperation here that really pairs well with the song.

**Oberionsynth** (7): idk why but this song just screams "i'm canadian", also hella ABBA vibes in the bridge synth

Awkward_King: # r/popheads has been a social experiment run by harvard university beginning on august 22nd 2015 to torture carly rae jepsen fans. the experiment has now reached its conclusion. thank you.

**geraldinewww** (7): i think i liked this one a lot when it released but as it's aged... not so much

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This feels unfinished

**J\_Toe** (7): aside from the opening track, the first half is pretty lukewarm. The second half, beginning with Summer Love, is waaaay better. Should have had the same number of tracks as Emotion: Side B and just included the best tracks. Still only a 7/10 though

**nooodisaster** (7): I feel like she just didn't have enough good songs for an entire Side B album but just did it anyway

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This has all the elements of a song I would really like but ends up just being decently good instead

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): the bass really makes this song

**Palutzel** (6.8): oof wish I liked some of these songs more but there is just something missing

**Uberpigeon** (6.8): this is a groovy driving song

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This was one of my favorites when I first heard the album, but the more I hear it the more I feel like it represents the album's acceptance with being just adequate.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): It's quite fun, but I don't think it's particularly good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is good but just kind of bored me a bit for some reason.

**ManofOranges** (6): Something fun, something for the summertime, something for the girls to, you know, get ready and party to.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): ok that little xylophone sounding thing at the end of the chorus is my fave part of the song

**musical\_pyn** (5): it's just a little abraisive tbh

**salivantsonority** (5): I'd prefer autumn

**waluigiest** (4): sorry this is a miss

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): I’m not getting down with her indie accent on this I just can’t

**fadedblue09** (0): Song tries to be sensual and upbeat, but ends up being annoying and dull. For a song called Summer Love, this does not emanate sunshine at all, but more like overcast weather because of how it meanders between generic club bop and dark-pop, which is like the ugliest combo possible.

Awkward_King: in theme with the carlyphobia of today, i forgot to post this...

---

# Dedicated Side B

---

**Overall Average**: 7.571 **// Average Controversy:** 1.816

---

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.358): better than Dedicated

**IIIHenryIII** (9.333): This is actually the album that turned me into a Carly stan. Before its release, I really liked her and listened to a lot of her songs; however, I was not super invested in her music and her in general. Oh man, how I regret it! She is the definition of the word perfection. To the people who say that, NoboDy iS PerFEct, Carly and Taylor say hi! I would literally give a 10 to almost all the tracks, but I don't know if this is allowed.

**nick1372** (8.833): This is Carly Rae’s least consistent, most underwritten, least focused, most hastily produced project since Kiss (and maybe even since Tug of War), but it’s still fantastic because it’s a Carly Rae Jepsen album. I appreciate that she tries some new things here and still sticks to other classic Carly techniques. If you were underwhelmed on the first listen, I’d really suggest listening again with no expectations. This is really a solid album. It doesn’t have the best songs on the rate but will probably end up with the highest score from me because all the songs are just so easy to listen to.

**mudkip1** (8.750): wtf why is this better than i remember it being

**just\_thonking** (8.708): First and foremost, I am a Carly Rae Jepsen stan

**vayyiqra** (8.667): I have to be blunt, when this album dropped I wasn't excited for it. I like Dedicated, but after streaming it once I more or less forgot about this album. However I am an 80s synthpop apologist so Carly cannot miss when she's in this genre. Like everything she does, this is a fun and cute album. It isn't anything more than that, and it doesn't need to be. I love Carly because she makes fun pop that makes me happy, and that's what I want right now.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.567): I was expecting that I would feel underwhelmed by this album considering that the rest of the albums in the rate are way stronger contenders. On top of it, I haven't heard the main Dedicated album in full yet so I felt like I might have missed some context when listening to this album. It's not the case at all as this album can be enjoyed as a standalone body of work. Actually, listening to this album reminded me why I loved Carly's music in the first place. There is a bit of EMOTION sparkled in this album mixed with Carly's more mature perspective on life and romance. Now I am really curious to listen to Dedicated if I get the time because I really loved this B-side album so much.

**moooo566** (8.500): It's no EMOTION (but neither is anything else), and the version we got is missing Let's Be Friends, my favourite of her 2020 offerings, but overall it's really good. I'm kind of surprised at how high I've ended up rating it, actually.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.500): POP PERFECTION, but some of the enunciation in this is questionable.

**pheromenos** (8.500): actually a very decent and sonically cohesive album. i admittedly found it boring upon its release, but it has since grown on me a lot.

**iniekcja\_** (8.417): the truth is I had never really gotten into Carly's discography before this rate (which is blasphemous in a sense I guess), but I really really enjoy this one and I find it much much better than the original Dedicated

**zagreux** (8.417): Carly Rae Jepsen makes the same songs about the same topic over and over again. And I keep putting a goddamn mark to all of them. Over and Over again.

**wasian-invasion** (8.292): This didn’t pack the same punch as emotion side b, which I come back to almost as much as side a. A few great songs & ideas in here, but the rest feels pretty fillery. I can see this getting chromatica-ed pretty hard in the rate.

**TiltControls** (8.292): Not a memorable album but it is a great collection of songs, though Side B > Side A imo

**shhhneak** (8.275): It’s not the feat that Emotion Side B was and it really showcases how consistent Dedicated is sonically but literally any collection that Carly drops is a good day.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.250): CRJ follows up her solid discography with a selection of Dedicated leftovers of which half should have honestly made the actual tracklisting and been given some extra oomf. Unfortunately this record displays a crucial flaw with CRJ's music in that it's really kind of the same flavour, and while good, really leaves the diversity she had shown to be capable of on EMOTION a lot lacking. Not a bad release at all either, though.

**conceptualromance** (8.250): I don’t know why she felt the need to do this

**notarobot3675** (8.242): when your bsides album is better than what most pop stars put out officially >>>> yeah what is there to say but like... a genuinely really solid pop album and its not even a proper album! love that for me

**wavingwolves** (8.117): better than dedicated :noitstrue:

**Alumineous** (8.083): I do have to say: I NEVER listened to Dedicated Side A other than the sexy song, No Drug Like Me. So, I have no context for how these fit in the Dedicated chronology. Taking that into account, I have to say: Carly impressed me. Her vocals were quite impressive, and she clearly occupies a lane of pop that is actually unique and fun to listen to. This rate didn't make me a full-on fan of her, but I'm glad to have experienced her "world", so to speak.

**skargardin** (8.083): For being B sides these are some darn solid songs.

**Roxieloxie** (8.067): why did you all lie to me and tell me this album was bad

**kirby31200** (8.042): While not quite an instant classic like her previous work, this is a very solid, likeable, enjoyable pop album

**Vultuxe** (8.000): I ended up liking this album a lot than I did on release. Sure, it's a collection of songs and not a true album I guess, but most of them are enjoyable and worthy additions to her discography.

**welcometoNY** (8.000): honestly i think this album is a lot better than side a. it has the best song of the bunch (comeback) and none of the clunky lows (for sure, party for one, everything he needs). i get that it feels more like a collection of songs than an album, but since a rate is literally rating individual songs there's no reason for it to do as poorly as it inevitably will.

**jasannn** (8.000): It doesn't have the high highs of Side A, like Julien and WYIMR, but its a lot more consistent project.

**sirpancakeXI** (7.958): my average completely plummeted with the last two song, it could have been a much higher average without them

**poptartchill** (7.958): I understand why these songs didn't make it into Dedicated (my favorite Carly album). That being said, it's Carly, so they're still good. I don't love this as an album but it is a great collection of songs.

**hakkerj** (7.942): I love Emotion Side D

**SmileAndTears** (7.908): "Side A" if I can call it that is one of my favourite pop albums ever so of course

**nooodisaster** (7.833): popheads will praise a random artist for saying they like carly rae jepsen more than they'll praise carly rae jepsen

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.833): This record was actually better than I remember it being. It came out, I was excited, and then I more or less promptly forgot about it. While this is still a pretty average record, my average is something like 7.8 if I did my math right, it is still better than I remember it being. Maybe I'll come back to it more often, but I'll probably just forget it exists again.

**jman457** (7.825): I feel Like i remember this being a lot more forgettable and justifying the B-side names when I listen to it a year ago. But listening too it now its like a whole new album.

**ReallyCreative** (7.758): Is it better than Dedicated? No. Does it have songs that are better than most of what's on Dedicated? Yes. Is it going to get butchered? Probably. Am I that mad about it? Well, let's see where Stay Away places and I'll get back to you.

**plastichaxan** (7.683): this would be perfect as an EP is all i’m saying

**jsonphile** (7.667): well not really much to say about this album, or any songs in particular. Just a handful of pretty fun songs that obviously aren’t going to be her best songs or they would’ve ended up on the actual album. But even Carly’s throwaway songs are still pretty solid

**anothertown** (7.583): It’s not even giving what y’all said it’s supposed to gave

**Palutzel** (7.550): cute album, but definitely weaker than other Carly projects and the other albums in the rate

**pat-rickstar** (7.542): This ended up getting a higher average than I expected, and at the end of the day these are pretty good songs considering they're leftovers. Still my least favourite in the rate unfortunately

**thedoctordances1940** (7.500): It's a good album overall, but it's not very consistent. There's some very clear filler and the closer is really quite bad, but there are also some really high highs, Let's Sort The Whole Thing Out is one of my favourite songs released last year and Solo is also pretty damn great. I'd say I prefer it a little bit to Dedicated, because while the tracks that are very similar to the ones on dedicated aren't quite as good and definitely feel like B-sides, the songs are a bit more over the top pop and probably wouldn't fit on Dedicated stylistically are mainly far better than what's actually on that album.

Awkward_King: ---

**liberalitea** (7.500): I actually really liked Dedicated and love Carly but this album was very inconsistent quality wise. There were some really great songs here and the 2end half of this album was really good but overall, there was a lot of filler. I love that she's evolving her sound too, and enjoyed the aesthetic for this album too. I just think a few songs should've been cut off and would've preferred this as an EP. Sadly, I do think she's gonna be done dirty in this rate.

**EnCaine** (7.500): this is both better and worse than i remembered. I bought a 60 dollar CRJ holiday sweatshirt in 2017 and i am yet to regret it. it's 2 sizes too large and I wear it the entire year long

**ignitethephoenix** (7.458): Yep this is definitely a collection of B sides. There are some good songs on here but for me it’s overwhelming mediocre. Not bad at all but there aren’t really highlights compared to her other albums.

**afs** (7.417): This album definitely has a lot of experimenting around with genres, yet interestingly the scores seem to not vary much with a few exceptions. There are no skips on first listen, and I doubt there'd be for a few more.

**waluigiest** (7.417): I’m a massive Carly Stan. And I was obsessed when this album came out. It’s cohesive and truly feels like a follow up to Dedicated. But that passion dimmed pretty quickly for me. This album is cute, but it’s missing the exceptional tracks and fresh sounds from her last 3 projects. Every time I think about listening to this album I just flip on Dedicated again.

**buddhacharm** (7.333): I shit on this album like every day but...unfortunately it does hold up. Yeah it's a little musty but who doesn't like a little must? Okay I don't, but there's definitely an audience for that. I loved Dedicated but I don't come back to this that often, but honestly "sprawling flaggots" makes it all worthwhile xx

**geraldinewww** (7.208): ok like..... yes it's probably the worst album of the four but i've also listened to it the second most...

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.083): While I go hard for my girl Carly, this album sort of slipped under my radar last year and is still definitely my least favorite of her post-Emotion work. That said, it’s pretty good considering it’s a b-sides album and some songs are still highlights!

**welcome2thejam** (7.000): A good album unfortunately up against great ones with more interesting sounds and songs. Still a perfectly fine place to be in though, especially for a Side B album, and enough likeable tracks on here to think about making a comeback to it every so often.

**camerinian** (6.833): Ugh this album was frustrating. I know it's a B Side collection, but so was Emotion Side B and that felt a lot more complete, thorough and finished than this one does. Maybe call it misplaced expectations, but I'm kinda just happy to pick out the few great tracks here and not return to this again. Bring on the next era

**akanewasright** (6.833): I like some of this but overall... I look forward to her next album in 3 years

**eeveefan01** (6.750): It doesn’t feel fair to rate this compared to the other albums as this is a B side

**RandomHypnotica** (6.725): This album isn't bad by any means, I still enjoyed it, and revisiting it helped me enjoy some more tracks that I otherwise ignored on my first visit. That being said, it IS a collection of B-Sides, compared to 3 absolutely stellar albums, it just doesn's stand a chance.

**KennyEarthman** (6.667): pros: a collection of good pop songs you can bop and dance to // cons: it becomes obvious they're b-sides when you forget all of them after a day

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.617): i listened to this once all the way through the day it dropped. it was boring. it is still boring.

**NecroDolphinn** (6.517): Despite liking this album, I think it’s Carly’s weakest and anybody who disagrees should actually listen to Tug of War before immediately calling it her weakest project

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.500): Well if there’s one thing that I can give this album, it’s that it’s very consistent (check my scores lol). After listening to all the albums, I can finally understand many commenters’ concerns that rating a collection of b-sides against three properly-conceived albums would be unfair, because it kinda is. Most of these songs aren’t particularly groundbreaking, they simply take up space as okay-ish, inoffensive pop tunes. Unfortunately I’ve never listened to the actual Dedicated, so I can’t compare the two, but from what I’ve perceived from Side B, it does what it was set out to do and nothing more: present a little extra material for Carly fans. Sadly, I am not a “Carly fan.”

**lagozzino** (6.500): tbh this shouldn't have been part of this rate. This is a collection of leftovers and it absolutely sounds like a collection of leftovers. Don't get me wrong, some songs are great, but there's not a single song where I question why it didn't make the cut for Dedicated.

**Qustomar** (6.375): Lots of same-y, breezy pop songs, with barely any having much staying power :S A lot of this album feels like Carly repeating her own song formula over and over just with a lot less energy. Many of the songs also tend to get sickly repetitive fast. Idk, there's not a lot of substance here imo, a lot of the songs just drag along.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.375): side B is a pretty good description for most of this album

**NotWith10000Men** (6.333): the most aggressively average album I've listened to in a long time. I didn't rate anything below a five but like… at least shoot for something you know?

**CreepyMannequin** (6.250): This is the only album from the four that I wasn’t very familiar with, as I had only listened to it when it was released and never again since I found it quite bland. Listening to it a couple of times now, I still find a lot of the tracks quite boring and none of the tracks reach the highs of Emotion or Kiss for me, but there’s still some highlights that I was missing out on.

**pig-serpent** (6.250): Carly is a good songwriter, but for some reason she has trouble not making all of her songs sound identical, even when the songs sound nothing alike.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.042): y'all did Carly DIRTY by putting her B sides up against three albums. Granted EMOTION side B was stellar, and this isn't BAD, but it definitely has some... very bad songs on it. Still glad we got a b sides, I'll take it.

**J\_Toe** (5.833): I swear, I'm not sabotaging the scores! I love Emotion, and I love Emotion: Side B even more! While Dedicated is a mixed bag, there's a handful of songs that really resonate with me. But Dedicated: Side B just does not click with me, on any track. It sounds like leftovers when Emotion: Side B was perfect and irreplaceable.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5.750): this album didnt make me a carly fan but maybe ill listen to dedicated at some point idk

**bespectacIed** (5.583): This rate was a set up for carly, pitting her glorified collection of demos to three LPs. But we love her so it probably doesn't matter much. But yeah it was clear why this was made a Side B

**jayjaysortagay** (4.917): I'll never understand the appeal of CRJ's music other than Emotion. Kesha's High Road wasn't great but I wish we had rated that instead. Though to be fair, either of them would be the worst in this rate by far.

**fadedblue09** (4.875): I feel bad but honestly if you aren’t fond of white woman synthpop, then there’s little incentive to listen to this at all. Also, can I just say that I really REALLY hate the idea of “Carly B-sides are better than most artist A-sides”. That’s just pretentious and gatekeepy AF, and Carly is certainly not that good of an artist LOL. Even more baffling are the people claiming this is somehow better than the actual Dedicated which is just ??? Some songs here are legit terrible and if any other artist released them, they would’ve been dragged. I know I shouldn’t be pressed over a bunch of outtakes, but I feel like I’m hearing this differently from everyone else. Anyway, I’ll end this rant by saying Kiss was unironically more fun than this faceless mess.
