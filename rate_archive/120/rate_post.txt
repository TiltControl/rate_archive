[Hey flops!](https://www.reddit.com/user/heyflops666/) 

Today I have gathered this group of popper sniffing, tennis playing, inflatable sword fighting bad friends to ~~have an incredibly stressful and busy two month process just to inevitably watch XS win~~ rate some of r/popheads favourite albums of 2021. In this mix are critical marvels, brilliant time capsules of 2020 and Dedicated Side B by Carly Rae Jepsen, but we love them *all* nonetheless. I’m calling this combination the Four Corners of Pop: Four pop albums which received similar levels of acclaim, however each pull from massively different references and sounds, the one uniting element to these four artists being their almost unanimous popularity on this sub.

r/popheads had quite a year last year, we [finally admitted kesha was not a main pop girl anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/g3iz7b/unfortunately_i_think_its_time_to_admit_that/), [got a surprise visit and shoutout from our second best mod (I’ll be letting all the other mods fight over my affection)](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/iq52sv/hey_rpopheads_your_maybe_secret_mod_miss_janelle/) and survived [*two* surprise](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/hwepbl/taylor_swift_folklore_megathread/) [taylor drops](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kaexds/taylor_swift_announces_new_album_evermore_is/), but the one thing holding the sub together was… No! Good guess but it was *not* united anger over the robbery of Damn Daniel in the rap girls rate, the answer was pop music!! Not just any pop music, *this* pop music. Arguably four of the least controversial releases of last year, none caused any major backlash or uproar and were well enjoyed by the sub as a singular body, and each respective artist’s diehards. So what is the logical way to treat four well liked and uncontroversial albums?

### WE’RE GONNA FUCKING RATE THEM  

Yep before you know it you’ll hate half these songs and hopefully even more of the users who took part, and the best part is, you won’t even know why. So let’s get to it!

I know there are several rate regulars and pop consumers who don’t need all the rules and the links, so **if that is you** then this is for you! And if there’s anything you’re even slightly not sure of, please read the full post!! It’ll really save the both of us trouble haha.

# Charli XCX - how i’m feeling now

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3a9qH2VEsSiOZvMrjaS0Nu?si=9AWf0wnsTsqr2B638mj1Xw) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/how-im-feeling-now/1513162098) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FU8xyVC-tk&list=PL-2HG0C5jJQG5n1GVlif-9S-FnQ1dIuKM) | [Tidal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWiuhNoSEc) 

> I get existential and so strange  
I hear no sounds when I’m shouting  
I just wanna go to parties  
Up high, wanna feel the heat from all the bodies 
 
*- anthems*

Charli’s status as a sub favourite dates back to her dramatic shift in sound with the release of SOPHIE produced hyperpop monster [*Vroom Vroom*](https://open.spotify.com/album/261QvR3MgGdyL2HyYIlgfd?si=w0aNMwXrTayZj4F-zXC27w&nd=1), a dramatic musical switch from the underground synth and pop-punk releases she had up to that point. And to this day Charli is one of *the* most visible figures in the hyperpop movement, collaborating with and bringing ^near mainstream attention to producers such as AG Cook and Dylan Brady/Laura Les, headlining festivals with songs like [Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8) and [Unlock It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP0r5LSbWL4) recently going viral on TikTok. Her position as a cult favourite is undeniable but especially on this community, if you had no familiarity with the outer pop world and only had this subreddit to gage pop culture you would think Charli XCX was Madonna. She is one of the top artists of all time on the [Weekly popheads Charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts), and has been on our [Top 100 SOTY list every year it has been conducted](https://itsrai.medium.com/the-top-100-tracks-of-2020-according-to-r-popheads-full-list-298125f1d576). Basically, her music is adored here.

And that message definitely carries over to her only LP release of 2020, *how i’m feeling now*. Arguably the defining quarantine album for gays^TM across the world, and the first album (I’m aware of, that was) entirely conceived and produced in isolation. It truly is the quintessential Charli album, tackling themes not unique to last year but especially relevant, such as inconsistency and insecurity when you have nothing to do but confront yourself. In typical innovative Charli fashion, she documented and shared the entire process in the form of weekly updates, [scraps of paper she’d written lyrics on](https://twitter.com/charli_xcx/status/1248086868979150849) and even involving her fans in decisions about [cover art](https://twitter.com/charli_xcx/status/1256687584471736320) and [track titles](https://twitter.com/charli_xcx/status/1249834442849312768). The music video for [forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbJE-KVZvTA) was compiled from fan footage she asked for, and [she released the unedited greenscreen footage of the video for claws, which fans used very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECGEE0OgFBM).

# Chloe x Halle - Ungodly Hour

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2HIaUwS0PTUeqFFYHBBGAN) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/ungodly-hour/1512283811) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ksaGmTQ54R63rFFbyiCa-UBr3xZKCWgvw) | [Tidal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47sXhGTvhps) 

> You wanna fly but you don’t  
You holdin’ on your wings  
Look to the sky, why don’t you  
Live for the finer things?   

*- ROYL*

*Ungodly Hour* almost didn’t make it into this rate, with confusion being met over [its inclusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kn5y82/february_to_april_2021_rate_selection_process/) (Slate C supremacy), due to the sound of the project - but really it makes perfect sense to me. This rate is already extremely varied in musical style, Ungodly Hour pulls from R&B and Doo Wop in the same way Sawayama draws from nu-metal and how i’m feeling now pulls from hyperpop glitch pop. Like I said prior, four corners of pop, but all are very firmly rooted in styles and produce results that are adored in this sub. As proven by this album. Going from such carefree highs, like [Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLIGjz1SSwA), a single simply about getting ready to go out for the night, down to [Wonder What She Thinks Of Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rojXXCMCaY), a haunting ballad about being the other woman, makes Ungodly Hour what I’d honestly consider to be one of the most concise and consistent albums I’ve heard in recent memory. Each track is truly just as strong as the last, and yet it manages to not feel repetitive or droning.

Chloe and Halle’s position as main pop girls on this sub are tied directly into this album, they did not receive nearly the same level of attention with their debut [The Kids are Alright](https://open.spotify.com/album/26mqgId4rrypPiYnN9tXuX?si=SSOkm8i5TJWVAFnsz6rf0w), a truly brilliant album made even more amazing when you realise they were just 19 and 17 respectively when it was released. They’ve also consistently acted since they were children, their largest role being [in Grown-ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_MmN6-KLXg), which they soundtracked much of too. Chloe produces much of their music too, and has been delving more into producing for other artists in between [going viral on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@chloebaileywashere?lang=en), while Halle has been in the UK [filming The Little Mermaid](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/little-mermaid-halle-bailey-chloe-x-halle-1203234294/), which she is leading as Ariel. Ungodly Hour though, and more specifically their masterful promotion of it unphased by the pandemic, is what brought them to r/popheads attention, boasting performances at the [BET Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6lxN7-c8MY), [VMAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwZ_hodT5CA) and [NPR’s Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTNZR82fVHw), among literally dozens more. They, along with artists like [Doja Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KbFNKWdnvE) and [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFSmzwnjNSM), really set the standard for what can be achieved even in lockdown with conditions and restrictions, and it paid off because they’re here, as a sub favourite, in the sub faves rate.

# Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated Side B

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1fnvV8n3ol42FcUCrAlu8M?autoplay=true) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/dedicated-side-b/1512161132?ign-gact=3&ls=1) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nPb6KuQstT1VzmMFgbRsje438YXOS5kAo) | [Tidal](

> I was down for the first night  
And I’m down for a second try  
When you touch me, I wanna fly  
I’m so down for you all the time  

*- Summer Love*

This subreddit was birthed from Carly’s womb. Pop music was invented in Summer of 2015 when Carly Rae Jepsen released [Emotion](https://open.spotify.com/album/2oj3FG6fos7zAQJxLQGzou?si=CdaympT7QnqrQCUvwQui9Q) and thus this subreddit was born. And I’m not even joking. It would be disingenuous to say this community is anything more than a glorified Emotion fan club, after being created when carly was too pop for r/indieheads but too gay for r/music. And more or less ever since the bible was released, we have been devoted to her, it’s a yearly tradition on every April Fools to repost Emotion, and [Carly took it upon herself to announce Dedicated (Side A) on April Fools 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/b84ao9/carly_rae_jepsen_announces_new_album_dedicated/), leading to a very confusing day. In essence, you have Carly to thank for you having a space to debate Lana’s unnecessary politics on the internet, so she has more than earned her spot as a sub fave.

*Dedicated Side B* is, in a word, joyous. While her Dedicated era ^mostly shies away from the bombastic synths and saxophones of Emotion, it is no less bouncy or bright - [This Love Isn’t Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyuyf206h04) is the perfect transitional B side opener, sounding like it could fit on any of her albums yet and yet setting such a perfect and unique tone for this one specifically. One of my personal highlights of the album would have to be the two song stretch of [Felt This Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QwBNbSPfXY)/[Stay Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybEODtj2E_8), a testament to Carly’s writing talent that I literally didn’t believe people who told me the two songs had the same lyrics just set to different rhythms with different emphasis. Overall the highs of Side B are energizingly uplifting and even the emotional lows are warm and glossy, while it may not reinvent the wheel, it makes me smile, and I think that’s enough.

u/forthecommongood delivered a [great AOTY write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/l4w7e0/popheads_album_of_the_year_25_carly_rae_jepsen/) for the album :)

# Rina Sawayama - SAWAYAMA

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3stadz88XVpHcXnVYMHc4J) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/sawayama/1493469433) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n0ol1-D43Jxyhec99vDB5eR22J9r0CDqE) | [Tidal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlqVuNMydk) 

> Twenty-eight and I still wanna scream  
Can’t face who I can and can’t be  
5,938 miles between you  
You make me  

*- Akasaka Sad*

*SAWAYAMA*’s release is the closest thing I can think of last year to being an ‘overnight success’, it felt like one night everyone went to bed, and the next morning my friends were texting me asking if I’d heard of this Rina girl and [indie publications were coming through with rave reviews](https://diymag.com/2020/04/16/rina-sawayama-sawayama-album-review) of her debut album - and it’s really not hard to see why. Not many artists could tackle such complex issues as disillusion and withdrawal as a western immigrant from your home, as Rina does so confidently on [Tokyo Love Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m8wpFC56JM), or singlehandedly end capitalism as Rina does on [XS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO2c06p6m5w), especially on their debut LP. The sheer variety in sound and aesthetic, as well as the diversity in topics she sings about, is one thing, but to make it all sound *good*, is an entirely different beast, and Rina successfully tamed it. The album also [topped r/popheads AOTY 2020 poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/l2rvtx/top_ten_pop_ten_aoty_2020_results/), beating out commercial successes like Future Nostalgia and folklore, as well as fellow critical darlings like Fetch the Bolt Cutters and Punisher (which you can rate both of in fellow April rate, the [Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mjy31r/2020_ultimate_pitchfork_acclaim_fiona_apple_haim/))!

Despite being a fairly new sub favourite, Rina is no stranger to a rate, having [absolutely demolished the 2017 EP rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8rsy2h/the_2017_ep_rate_day_3_wheres_your_mind_popheads/) a few years back with [Cyber Stockholm Syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKLxvdFtlZE) taking the win overwhelmingly. Rina as an artist draws her influences from all over, as shown in SAWAYAMA, where you can go from a neon citypop song like [Paradisin’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_v1BVMgJiI) to [Love Me 4 Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGtypOYpUMQ), which sounds like it could’ve come straight from a Ciara record in 2005, but this unpredictability in musical influence is nothing new. [Ordinary Superstar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXnxWFKnPJY), the opening track to her self titled 2017 EP, tackles the subject matter of YouTube fame and how people ‘just like you!’ market themselves. Rina’s biggest song prior to 2020, the stand-alone single [Cherry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn5YFnrD1u8) serves as a coming out song, presenting the artist’s pansexuality as unabashed queer pride.

*NOTE: Tokyo Takeover was released as a Japan Exclusive Deluxe Track, and so isn’t on any streaming platforms. I’ve linked the audio on YouTube for you to listen to, which hopefully should be no extra trouble, and I’d say it is well worth including in the main rate!*

# BONUS RATE

All four of these artists released absolute bangers in the form of deluxe tracks, loose singles, covers and features during these eras, and while a lot of their inclusion would be a bit clunky for the main rate, I think they fit perfectly in a neat selection of bonus songs.

**REMINDER: The Bonus Rate is optional** and **you do not *have* to submit a score for every song in it if you do do it**. You **cannot** give your 0 or 11 to any song in the bonus, as they are not part of the main rate, but that doesn’t mean you should shy away from 10’s or 1’s ;). While it is optional, I can promise you there are some gems among these bonus tracks and it will be worth your time.

*NOTE*: Much like Tokyo Takeover, ‘We Are Born To Play’ by Charli and ‘Me And The Boys In The Band’ by Carly are not on streaming platforms, but YouTube links are provided ~~and I would heavily recommend checking out the Charli one~~. Additionally ‘Sending My Love’ by Chloe x Halle was a spotify single only, but the YouTube version is again linked for users who don’t have access to the Spotify playlist.

# RULES

A lot of people here will be very familiar with the rules and the formalities of a rate, but if this is your first one or you’re still unsure on anything, *please* for the love of god read this you don’t know how much time it will save both you and me:

- You must listen to and submit a score for every song, **ballots with missing scores/songs will not be accepted**

- **Each song must be scored between a 1 and a 10** (with the exception of one optional 0 and 11). Scores are allowed to one decimal point, but no more than that as it will break the rate machine. So a 9.9 or a 7.3 is perfectly fine, a 5.48 or 6.969 however, you will be asked to change. And please use full stops and not commas for these decimals

- In regards to the 11 and 0, they are optional to use, but you only get one of each across the rate, this is **not** one per album. Reserve these scores for your favourite/least favourite or the most impactful songs on you

- *Please* **use the message format linked** [**here**](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Awkward_King&subject=2020%20Sub%20Faves%20Rate%20Ballot&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20How%20I'm%20Feeling%20Now%0A%0APink%20Diamond%3A%0A%0AForever%3A%0A%0AClaws%3A%0A%0A7%20Years%3A%0A%0ADetonate%3A%0A%0AEnemy%3A%0A%0AI%20Finally%20Understand%3A%0A%0AC2.0%3A%0A%0AParty%204%20U%3A%0A%0AAnthems%3A%0A%0AVisions%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Ungodly%20Hour%0A%0AIntro%20%2F%20Forgive%20Me%3A%0A%0ABaby%20Girl%3A%0A%0ADo%20It%3A%0A%0ATipsy%3A%0A%0AUngodly%20Hour%3A%0A%0ABusy%20Boy%3A%0A%0ACatch%20Up%20\(with%20Swae%20Lee\)%3A%0A%0AOverwhelmed%3A%0A%0ALonely%3A%0A%0ADon't%20Make%20It%20Harder%20On%20Me%3A%0A%0AWonder%20What%20She%20Thinks%20Of%20Me%3A%0A%0AROYL%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Dedicated%20Side%20B%0A%0AThis%20Love%20Isn't%20Crazy%3A%0A%0AWindow%3A%0A%0AFelt%20This%20Way%3A%0A%0AStay%20Away%3A%0A%0AThis%20Is%20What%20They%20Say%3A%0A%0AHeartbeat%3A%0A%0ASummer%20Love%3A%0A%0AFake%20Mona%20Lisa%3A%0A%0ALet's%20Sort%20The%20Whole%20Thing%20Out%3A%0A%0AComeback%3A%0A%0ASolo%3A%0A%0ANow%20I%20Don't%20Hate%20California%20After%20All%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20SAWAYAMA%0A%0ADynasty%3A%0A%0AXS%3A%0A%0ASTFU!%3A%0A%0AComme%20Des%20Gar%C3%A7ons%20\(Like%20The%20Boys\)%3A%0A%0AAkasaka%20Sad%3A%0A%0AParadisin'%3A%0A%0ALove%20Me%204%20Me%3A%0A%0ABad%20Friend%3A%0A%0AFuck%20This%20World%20\(Interlude\)%3A%0A%0AWho's%20Gonna%20Save%20U%20Now%3F%3A%0A%0ATokyo%20Love%20Hotel%3A%0A%0AChosen%20Family%3A%0A%0ASnakeskin%3A%0A%0ATokyo%20Takeover%3A%0A%0ABONUS%20TRACKS%0A%0AWE%20ARE%20BORN%20TO%20PLAY%3A%0A%0ARingtone%20\(Remix\)%3A%0A%0ACHARGER%3A%0A%0AHazy%3A%0A%0A80%2F20%3A%0A%0ASending%20My%20Love%3A%0A%0ALet's%20Be%20Friends%3A%0A%0AMe%20And%20The%20Boys%20In%20The%20Band%3A%0A%0AOk%20On%20Your%20Own%3A%0A%0ALUCID%3A%20%0A%0AWe%20Out%20Here%3A%0A%0ABees%20%26%20Honey%3A%0A%0AEND), we do this because it makes it infinitely easier to input scores with and saves a lot of time on the end of the hosts to convert otherwise. If that link doesn’t work for whatever reason, the content is linked in [**this pastebin**](https://pastebin.com/GDm4Cv7F)! If you submit your scores in another format I will simply ask you to re-submit them with this template.

- **Your scores should not be considered confidential**, they will get shared with your username attached come the rate reveal, and ~~if you have bad opinions~~ you likely will be memed and/or dragged, all in good taste.

- If you want to change any of your scores after submitting them, feel free to message me **on this account**, and I will do that for you!

- Not only can you add them, but **including comments with your scores is encouraged**, this is formatted as so:

> claws: 10 the only reliable food is spaghetti

- Any variation from this format will be rejected, such as:

> Comeback: 0**,** please go away

> Do It: **(**7.6**)** omg queens of tennis courts

> Love Me 4 Me: 4 **-** could never be me but go off

- You may also leave comments with the albums, though this is not mandatory. To do this, simply **add a colon after the album title and insert your comment following it (no score)**, such as:

> Dedicated Side B: i dont think we need a Side C

- This one should be obvious but **do not sabotage songs/albums**, that’s no fun for anyone and these scores will be rejected. I have the right to reject scores how I like, and if I have reason to suspect your scores have been altered then I will either just not accept them at all, or I will ask for further clarification on some things.
