I think if XS weren't in this rate this may be my 11, it's definitely one of my favourite songs of last year, which was an incredible year for music. The raw fucking energy this radiates is absolutely peak Charli and I think goes above and beyond for her even. The drop in the chorus is laced with the same crack that Charli inserted into ringtone, and the blaring synths throughout are insane and shouldn't work as well as they do. It is also a weirdly beautiful time capsule of like Springtime last year, when everything was shitty but seemed oddly hopeful still. It's odd to be nostalgic of a time that clearly none of us enjoyed, but it feels like there is safety in familiarity, and at this point we are finally coming out of lockdown and I don't know if I am emotionally and socially ready for that, and so the comfort a song like Anthems brings is appreciated

# **amiriteor** (11): fuck taylor swift

**amiriteor** (11): fuck taylor swift

# its britney bitch

**fairytalehigh** (11): queen of bubblegum bangers about cereal-inspired existential crises, your fave could never

**hakkerj** (11): Song of the millennium

**iniekcja\_** (11): this could go to any of the last three tracks but I feel like popheads might hate this one because of the Dylan Brady production

**izeaklapaucius** (11): imagine if I had the talentry of her and A. G. Cook in my basement 1 year ago. I could've definitely write this song.

**nick1372** (11): No song captures 2020 like this. The glitchy production and slightly off-kilter lyrics expressed exactly how I felt throughout the year in a way that nothing else could. All I can say is thank god for this song.

**Palutzel** (11): BANGER imagine if this kind of music topped the charts

**therokinrolla** (11): an incredible soundscape that perfectly encapsulates the rapturous energy buildup brought to us by quarantine. The production is like a bouncyball stuck in a motor engine and the lyrics are so stupid and terrible it's brilliant. a modern day work of art honestly

**vagenda** (11): This song is like a sandblaster for my brain when I’m getting bogged down in COVID-related anxiety. It has this amazing tension between denial and catharsis, frustration and euphoria. It’s a lament for the nights we’re missing out on that will act as a perfect soundtrack for the moment we get them back; an anthem in waiting. It’s also the dictionary definition of a fucking banger and that sure doesn’t hurt

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (11): ; just absolute perfection. I desperately want to see this performed live.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Even if the lyrics are kind of weird the total chaos of this song and just how hard it goes, continuing with Pink Diamond, really makes this track a standout.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an album highlight

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): HEAD BANGIN' IN BED RN.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): y'all when we get a Charli concert... and she plays this... I don't even want to think about it

**camerinian** (10): IM SO BORED WHOOP best two seconds of this rate

**CarlieScion** (10): goes awf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**celladonn** (10): TRULY the 2020 anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Forever is the sad song for remembering fun times with your friends, Anthems is the happy song for remembering fun times with your friends.

**frogaranaman** (10): this literally hits so much harder as the pandemic continued on.. probably the most impactful song on the album, who knew such an early quarantine mood would literally only grow harder as it continued on

**hikkaru** (10): I'M SO BORED me after listening to party 4 u, good thing this banger is right after

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): Charli lonely ?? but Charli ride ??

**joeeswift** (10): reminds me of early quarantine and im weirdly nostalgic

**KennyEarthman** (10): this song just summed up my pandemic experience

**liberalitea** (10): sEX ME AND MY ROMEO YESSS

**LuisEnRod** (10): this is (to me) the “trying not to go crazy” lockdown anthem

**martian\_pet** (10): the amount of times i've deafened myself playing this at max volume...

**musical\_pyn** (10): other than track 10, this is to me the charli xcx song

**nootnoot781** (10): when this gets played in the clubs >>>

**pat-rickstar** (10): Still think she's saying "island anthems" but it slaps so

**pig-serpent** (10): crazy overactive snyth line and Charli has the audacity to yell "I'm So Bored" this is why I love her.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this is what i mean by chaos. that explosion of sound is just a breath of fresh air after the comparatively laid back tracks. the chorus is just so big!

**racloves** (10): man this hits hard

**runaway3212** (10): I too am bored

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): An10ems amirite

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Go off!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): massive bop

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is my favorite song on this album and encompasses my overarching mood for the last year. I truly do just wanna go to parties, wanna feel the heat from all the bodies.

**targetguest** (10): when I listen to this song I feel nostalgic for the late NY parties I never attended when I was in school

**waluigiest** (10): LYRICIST OF THE CENTURY

**wavingwolves** (10): when i sent this to my best friend last year saying ''i miss us''... a moment i'm fond of

**welcome2thejam** (10): Crazy good chorus carries this song to its super high score.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): My other favorite car crash song

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I cannot stop listening to this song. I know this song is about longing (for something you don’t have), but actually, she’s so good at describing the things that she wants that it makes me feel powerful, and excited; like I’m in the middle of .

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I'm not fond of the abrasive production, but damn these lyrics really hit hard considering last year.

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**akanewasright** (9): me when i’m so bored. woo.

**artzpop** (9): Why is this song still relevant. This pandemi should have been over a year ago already. That being said agreed with everything

**bbfan132** (9): the fan-submitted lyrics… they went from shit to excellent in a matter of two lines

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Any song Charli makes with Danny L Harle is always gold. A PSA for y'all to get vaccinated when you can so we can get fucked up in the clubs again.

**EnCaine** (9): s/o to that part of the instrumental that plays at ~1:50 minutes it's so good

**juanolsen** (9): Charli really puts into perspective how quarantine has affected her as someone who loves ves to party and it's extremely extroverted

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Really the best intro for the whole year...........I'M SO BORED

**ktajlili** (9): Iconic.

**rickikardashian** (9): okay now i understand the gays that say they wanna listen to this album at a club

**Roxieloxie** (9): okay so this is what throtzilla would sound like if it wasnt horny

**slimboyfriend** (9): I'm so bored WOO

**thedoctordances1940** (9): absolute banger and placed perfectly in the tracklisting

**Uberpigeon** (8.7): I think this is the best song on the album, not by much

**Qustomar** (8.5): The first half is ok for me, but I love the second half when the production really gets its chance to shine.

**seanderlust** (8.5): you know, this song grew on me from first listen. the chorus' end I think bothered me bc it feels so anticlimactic ("we might be even closer") but other than that nitpicky thing I really like this

**SupremeShani** (8.5): Just like Pink Diamond, I think I usually only click with Charli when she embraces these harsher and more aggressive soundscapes.

**geraldinewww** (8.2): gotta have my bowl gotta have cereal

**IIIHenryIII** (8): an anthem for an anthem.

**J\_Toe** (8): this song addresses the COVID-19 quarantine the most directly. I think other songs were written a lot earlier, but the themes of isolation, mental health, and being alone with just one person fit the album well enough to be added. But eating cereal as a lyric only makes sense for the quarantine album.

**Oberionsynth** (8): FINALL an anthem anthem, we've hit the meta guys pack it up time to go

**salivantsonority** (8): A vibe! Love the lyrics.

=====

Awkward_King: **wasian-invasion** (8): just bought outside lands tickets and can't wait to feel the heat from all the vaccinated bodies

**poptartchill** (7.5): this is a lot not in a bad way though

**jman457** (7.1): Its feels like a Sucker track turned up to an 11.

**throwaway7650** (7): this song is very... hyper, kind of living for the chaotic energy though. the cereal line is iconic

# im so bored woo

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This would have been an easy 11 if not for the awful (effects on) Charli's vocals.

**bulforster** (7.8): a bit overrated tbh

**jasannn** (7.5): im so bored woo

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I love the lyrics, but the auto tune was too abrasive for me. But it’s really great song for 2020

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): this album is getting okay

**Leixander** (7): she kinda sounds annoying in some parts of this song but does it go off? yes.

**nooodisaster** (7): The most literal telling of the early pandemic/quarantine on the album.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I like it and it reminds me of some of Charli’s career bests but imo the shriek-y chorus is kind of grating after the first repetition

**cashewconstellation** (6.7): didn't really feel it

**Itsafudgingstick** (6.5): This is lit but the lyrics are so…it reminds me of when I was in 7th grade and had to write a ballad for my English class lmao

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): appreciate this being upbeat

**vayyiqra** (6): Okay same @ the lyrics, but her voice is so grating here. This sounds too much like a 100 Gecs song with Charli on it rather than a Charli song.

**urfavgalpal** (5.7): my best friend is gonna kill me for this score but anyway.  I kinda hated this song when it came out but then my best friend wouldn’t stop quoting it and now I kinda like it sometimes?  It’s fun to sing but it’s overhyped imho

**astrologicalangel** (5.5): I miss this part of quarantine honestly

**ReallyCreative** (5): the lyrics and their delivery... there's a point where the slight irony loops around to being, to be honest, very bad

**Turpamutteri** (5): this felt longer than it really was

**Vultuxe** (4.5): Anthems tried really hard to be the next big banger but it's comically loud, the chorus just overpowers your ears and the extreme autotune doesn't sound good to me.

**afs** (4): holy hell I knew it was a matter of time before Charli gets loud again but I was still hit by a train and unfortunately this is reminding me a little too much of the track opener

**Alumineous** (4): Not a fan of the production. Lyrics are nothing special.

**jsonphile** (4): this is actually kinda grating

**NotWith10000Men** (4): I've discovered that I like charli's verses but again, that chorus is just not something I want to casually listen to

Awkward_King: On tour and stuff, typically in the past, I’ve been quite... like... not good to myself. I actually had this... uh, on the last tour, my last record, I had this thing because I was ‘vegan’ and I had this thing where I was like, ‘The only reliable food is spaghetti.’ So I was only eating spaghetti for a year or two years. I only ate spaghetti. And then I was like just so sick and my hair actually stopped growing. I went to the doctor and the doctor was like, ‘You actually are malnourished from not eating vegetables or meat and just eating spaghetti for two years.” So... but yeah, cuz spaghetti is the only thing though in every city that’s good. I also, like, that’s- that will n- I won’t do that again, that was a mistake, I won’t make that mistake again... of only eating spaghetti... on tour. Spaghetti is divine though

If I say this song feels like a clementine is that ? does that make sense? It feels compact and sweet and bright!! This is Dylan Brady at is best imo, just making fucking happy, fun hyperpop songs, and he really shines here I think, despite him not even being on the song.

---

# dylan brady sympathisers

**jman457** (11): This song made me get through the early part of the pandemic, and gave me the energy to finish my work and graduate

**1998tweety** (10): i hate to say it but this is amazing wtf. like I know yall clown Charli for her repetitive songs but this works really well. Also it has just enough weird to stan out but not enough to be abrasive.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): If you hate this song I assume you just hate fun

**amiriteor** (10): UGGGGHHHHHH i wanna be in love

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): such a fun song to feel like a baddie

**celladonn** (10): In this house we love Dylan Brady production

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Dammit Charli we get it you have a cute-ass boyfriend and he is a good kisser. ?? Ugh totally not a bitter single gay here smh. ??

**EnCaine** (10): tbh kinda sick of it (2nd most played of 2020 on my spotify oops) but i'm not letting that change my score

**frogaranaman** (10): when we fucking clowned on her for posting the lyrics on Twitter then it became literally one of her best songs

**hakkerj** (10): Charli really likes rollercoasters

**hunnybee12** (10): the hype after she wrote the lyrics on ig live was such a fun moment

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I like everything about this song, except the outro. It still deserves a 10, though. It's up there on my top 4 favorite Charli songs.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): hit main pop girl yaas queen slay purr house the boots gawd

**Leixander** (10): EVERYTHING BOUT YOU!

**liberalitea** (10): i love this

**martian\_pet** (10): I will get married to this song

**mudkip1** (10): aggressive twerking

**nick1372** (10): pretty good but she should repeat “I like everything about you” more

**nootnoot781** (10): i was a bit skeptical when she teased the lyrics in her livestream, but it works surprisingly well. charli hasn’t missed with dylan so far, and i’m looking forward to see what else is in store from them.

**Palutzel** (10): my friends hate this song and I can't express how brilliant it is (fuck them honestly), dylan brady at his best

**pat-rickstar** (10): yup. Idk I just love this, idc about the stupid lyrics it’s honestly really sweet

**plastichaxan** (10): i don't think the expression "cherry on top" has applied to an outro as much as this one for me

**pros-and-connors** (10): on paper this song shouldn’t work, but oh boy does it work

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really wish this song was called Clementine, it just fits the vibe so much better. Also, is it bad that a part of my brain thinks this version feels kind of empty without Grimes talking about spaghetti over it?

**Roxieloxie** (10): I have been held hostage into liking this song and unfortunately it worked

**skargardin** (10): dylan brady snapped

**wasian-invasion** (10): idgi why is it claws, does his love have its claws in her or something?

**xaviersi** (10): perfect mix of chaos and melody and not to deny the best outro

**zagreux** (10): me writing an essay about my crush in the third grade:

**urfavgalpal** (9.9): okay people like to give Charli shit sometimes because on paper a lot of the times her lyrics seem kinda silly and that is true but I think really what it is is that Charli has a great ear for what will sound great and she has the right presence to deliver anything she writes exactly how it needs to in order to work and I think this is a really great example of this.  The lyrics are cute but kinda basic and I remember them getting some shit when they were posted before the song came out but it really works like you get such a good vibe from it and Charli really sells the whole thing with her attitude.  The production is great and keeps going along at a great little pace.  Also she name drops my favorite fruit.  All in all it’s such an infectious song.

**UselessTacooo** (9.9): my favourite from this album

**Dekubaku** (9.5): Catchy and fun. I like everything about it.

**wavingwolves** (9.4): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Have I been sleeping on Charli XCX. This is insane production.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I expect a jeremih song to play in beatsense right after this or else I will be disappointed

**jasannn** (9): I still don't know why this song is named Claws.

**jaztinax** (9): this is the only song from this album i’ve listened to more than twice

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song fucks. every time i just spend the entire song doing random travis scott adlibs while it plays. IT'S LIT!

**Qustomar** (9): I like Claws a lot, I just can't help but feel it sounds like a sped up and less realized version of Forever lol.

**Vultuxe** (9): Contrary to whatever the hell the first two tracks were, claws is SO good I return to it often. It's actually catchy, the production does not hurt my fucking ears (the outro is testing me though). The lyrics are ... tolerable.

**waluigiest** (9): this song is so dumb I’m gonna stream it 200 times

**juanolsen** (8.7): absolute banger

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): Dylan kinda ate

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I feel like I shouldn't like this song on paper, but in practice I very much do

**cashewconstellation** (8): BOP

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but Troye was so right that this should’ve been called clementine tho

**fadedblue09** (8): Another euphoric chorus surrounded by excruciating noise

**musical\_pyn** (8): stream juice just like clementines

**runaway3212** (8): a bit repitative but still great

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): Continuing on the grimy hyperpop vibe, here we are. Not much to see here really other than it’s a really cute and easily digestible song, but I do love the random shoutout to Jeremih (mainly cause I legit forgot he existed tbh)

# my mother was run over by the very concept of hyperpop 

**salivantsonority** (8): Didn't age super super well but still a decent bop.

**vayyiqra** (8): I can tell this is Dylan Brady by the clanking snare so this is like 100 Gecs but with the distortion toned down enough that it's enjoyable.

**endcreditouilles** (7.3): juicy just like I DON'T NEED ANYONE, I DON'T NEED ANYONE, I JUST NEED EVERYONE AND THEN SOME

**afs** (7): Nooo it's autotuned rapping again! But hey this time it's music! Also love the part after the final chorus until THAT

**CarlieScion** (7): cute

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): fun song and the auto tune/vocal processing is harsh enough to ruin it for me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This album is full of songs that make me go “is it actually good? or is it just awful?” Thankfully for this one I decided on the former

**notarobot3675** (6.6): this was a lot of fun! definitely the kind of stuff I enjoy from Charli

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): love the chorus but the verse's are ....

**throwaway7650** (6.5): not a big fan of this song overall and even less a fan of the outro

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): Never really got that into this one but it’s a good song for sure

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): Mostly pretty forgettable track on this album, although the very ending is.......not my fave

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yY-jctqeJ61I4RMUIAqBsPb6URU=/0x1080/volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/a3168ec5b317f87e458b45c882dde459/repetition_thumb_facebook.jpg

**Raxxin** (5): same as forever LOL

**SupremeShani** (5): every time i hear this, i just think of the phcj post that posted the lyrics and said "found a song i wrote for my "girlfriend" when I was in 6th grade lol" and just start crying

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UosZ4mXL8EI

**jackisboredtoday** (3.5): this would be at least a full point lower if i weren’t happy to hear her shout out Jeremih, who needs WAY more love around these parts

**bespectacIed** (2): Great outro boring song

**NotWith10000Men** (1): aaaaaaand now we're getting into what i was expecting. truly what is this? That chorus makes my ears bleed

I only ate spaghetti. And then I was like just so sick and my hair actually stopped growing. I went to the doctor and the doctor was like, ‘You actually are malnourished from not eating vegetables or meat and just eating spaghetti for two years.” So... but yeah, cuz spaghetti is the only thing though in every city that’s good.

This was my immediate favourite from the album and while I don't think it's still my absolute favourite, it's still so goddamn good. I love how the rhythms of the song actually sound tipsy, as some people have pointed out in their comments. I like the evolution of the idea of being drunk on someone, and because you're quote on quote tipsy you're more loose-lipped with the idea of being like "if you hurt me i'm gonna fucking kill you", I just think that's a smart way they wrote the song and I really appreciate it, I also enjoy songs about men dying!!

---

# i may have slightly traumatised roxie with my constant fake spoilers about this song's placement...

**CreepyMannequin** (11): I love this song. It’s infectious, it’s fun, it’s a bop.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (11): I was instantly obsessed with this song the first time I heard it. It's just so much fun, such a bop, and the "better, treat me better" runs are such an earworm

**Roxieloxie** (11): Im obsessed with this song so fucking much. I love angry girl pop anthems (which is probably why the only [redacted] song i can stand is blank space) I just love how this song plays around with the 'kill men :men:' concept that so often on yt women get to play around with. Like the truly just bubblegum murderness of 'boy dont play with me, i will fucking kill you with a smile on my face and still show up at sunday dinner with your mother :) <3' like just the immaculate southern gothic sexy horror of it all

**anothertown** (10): don’t you just want to go ape shitt

**bigbigbee** (10): I REALLY love this song; I think it’s incredibly musically interesting. There’s some unusual harmony in the verses that almost make it sound off-key (to my untrained ear), even though it’s not, obviously. And I don’t mean that in a bad way. It makes you pay attention, and then when you hit those gorgeous, more standard harmonies in the chorus and the bridge, they stand out even more in comparison.

**CarlieScion** (10): a winner mayhaps

**cremeebrulee** (10): if chloe and halle murdered me do not prosecute them they caught ME slipping ok

**Dekubaku** (10): Found this hidden gem when listening to the album for the rate. Holy shit! Everyone should be listening to this!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Queens of committing a murder while being under a Disney contract!

**endcreditouilles** (10): honestly it was so hard to pick between this, title track, and Do It for my 11, just pretend this is an 11 ok

**engifear** (10): Honestly if they murdered someone it would be a #girlboss move and I support them

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The production on this song is so nutty, it feels like it’s sliding around on my brain. It works well to give this that “off-kilter” vibe that backs up the characters they’re playing here.

**hikkaru** (10): oh to be murdered by chloe and halle

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Love a good men murdering anthem lol. Definitely one of the highlights on here for sure

**jayjaysortagay** (10): ???? end all men ???? except me lmfao

**juanolsen** (10): i love songs about killing men, also the fact that this song was produced by Chloe herself and is the best produced song in the album makes it even better

**KennyEarthman** (10): the way Halle says tipsy really makes this song

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): invented murder, also 2:01

**musical\_pyn** (10): one time I was singing the chorus under my breath and a friend screamed, turns out the part I was singing was going through his head at the exact same time. In conclusion, listening to chloe x halle gives you telepathy

**nootnoot781** (10): what a killer song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this went on my new faves playlist the moment I heard it. goodbye earl's daughter

**pheromenos** (10): best song period

**plastichaxan** (10): this is just extremely fun i love it

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is just. perfection. it's actual perfection. if i didn't love wasting my 11s, i'd choose this. It's clever, it's well-written, and i love the chorus effects.

**poptartchill** (10): SO GOOD! such a fun song!

**ReallyCreative** (10): misandry anthem

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The way this is more subversive than any edgy try-hard song about serial killers made by an industrial dude (just say Suicide Commando). They literally murdered the songwriting game with this. A clever bop that’s as unsettling as it is mischievous, playful and fun.

**skargardin** (10): songs to kill boys to

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): just fantastic, don't FUCK up

**urfavgalpal** (10): If I gave this album my 11 it would be this one but yeah this is the best song on the album.  Best song about murdering a man since Goodbye, Earl

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Few songs are able to elicit a physical reaction from me… but when I heard Tipsy’s second verse for the first time, I literally GASPED

**Vromega** (10): I was really surprised listening to this mysterious first verse. and then a fantastic chorus comes and suddenly everything made sense musically. Great production, gorgeous background vocals

**Vultuxe** (10): I know Tipsy will be a day 1 song but I wish people would hear what I hear with it. I think this song is so creative and silly, while being a total fucking banger. Whatever the production is doing in the chorus is addicting.

**wavingwolves** (10): real misandrists will give this a score above 9.9

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): the tipsy/crazy rhyme + their delivery is soooo catchy

**savemeaseat143** (9.6): melody sounds tipsy somehow

**camerinian** (9.5): More murder ballads from main pop girls pls

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): trend alert…murder that man

**kirby31200** (9.5): Gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**SupremeShani** (9.5): chloe and halle really are out here killing m*n and singing about it, popheads fan favorite right here

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): Cruella be like “yes, this will be my wedding song.”

**AHSWeeknd** (9): not one of my faves off the album but it goes all the way

**astrologicalangel** (9): love me a casual murder anthem

**bespectacIed** (9): Fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): They had it comin'

**Brendon-Urine** (9): definitely had to warm up to this one. kinda hated it on my first listen, it sounds... dumb (which is the point obv) but it's also really fun and I love it now. Like this song SOUNDS tipsy.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I now realized this album would be great with some wine

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The verses and the pre-choruses carry this.

**EnCaine** (9): okay okay so i cant figure out how to word this thought, but i love really like this in the same way I like black heart by crj. there's a playfulness and type of delivery they have that i adore

**fadedblue09** (9): Very fun and flirty

**jaztinax** (9): i prefer the spotify singles version tho but why would we rate a song about murdering boys anything lower than a 9 anyways?

**liberalitea** (9): this is such a fun song and i can't believe chloe produced this herself. the ending is so good with the "dum dum" in the background

**Oberionsynth** (9): queens of killing their man and acting innocent around the family

**pig-serpent** (9): They should make more uptempo songs like this one.

**racloves** (9): go girls get his ass

**salivantsonority** (9): Great don't fuck with me energy; I love the spoken quality of the vocals in the verses. Just a fun song.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Misandry anthem

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Queens of murdering lovers

**Uberpigeon** (8.7): I really wasnt expecting a song about killing your boyfriend from CxH when I first listened, but im so glad that i got it. Its also no coincidence that one of the best produced songs was produced by Chloe herself

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is camp

**throwaway7650** (8.5): "I've been charged with murder" - Chloe x Halle after their VMAs ungodly hour performance because they KILLED IT. love this song's lyrics!

**welcometoNY** (8.5): love a good homicide anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): I LOVE the lyrics here, and I want to love this song, but the instrumental feels really lacking to me, it just sounds kinda messy and muddy.

=====

Awkward_King: **DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I always forget this is a murder song? I actually love the progression of the lyrics from how both explicit it is it’s “i will kill you if you treat me wrong” to being coy in the fact they’re also not going to get caught.

**frogaranaman** (8): the production on this song is WILD

**ggal2020** (8): god I love it when women commit murder

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Making joyful bops about murdering our shitty lovers? Your faves could neverrrr

**Palutzel** (8): smooth song and gorgeous vocals

**waluigiest** (8): the vocals during the chorus oh my goooood

**zagreux** (8): man-hating bop? we love to see it

**hakkerj** (7.6): I love the weird beat

**celladonn** (7.5): I appreciate how weird and dark this song is even if it doesn't fully work for me

**just\_thonking** (7.5): this song is about murder

**seanderlust** (7.5): put your mask up, put your mask up, baby no don't be dumb - me in public seeing strangers with their noses out of their masks

**nick1372** (7): Not a huge fan of the production but it’s still a bop

# must have been drunk when they scored this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): Cutesy, but one of my least favorites on the album. The production on this one is a little bare imo but the lyrics are super cute!

**afs** (7): That first few seconds completely betrayed me on what to expect. Never heard a tipsier way of saying tipsy.

**bbfan132** (7): the theme of the song is fun/interesting but i don’t fully connect with it sonically… still pretty good though

**iniekcja\_** (7): I really really dislike the melody but it isn't terrible

**nooodisaster** (7): truly cannot relate

**runaway3212** (7): overrated

**cashewconstellation** (6.9): interesting but i didn't really enjoy it

**ManofOranges** (5): I don't get tipsy, I get drop dead intoxicated.

**thedoctordances1940** (5): The chorus is decent but I think the beat is just quite annoying

**vayyiqra** (5): Eh. One of my least favourite tropes is "haha murder is so fun and zany". I know they're not serious, but this is a weirdly edgy song from them and feels off to me. I know they aren't serious and it is musically a bop though, so my feelings are mixed I guess.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): The instrumental really turns me off this song, it's a little bit of a grower for sure but the instrumental is just kind of nauseating and the verse melody is one of the worst I've heard in a long while.

**Turpamutteri** (4): this song annoys me for some reason

**lagozzino** (0): wooow they are not pulling off this cocky badgirl schtick at all. The secondhand embarrassment I'm getting from this is gonna make me break out in hives

**wasian-invasion** (0): I know theyre going for the drunk slurring with tiiipsy but its just irritating. Also the drums seem so randomly inserted and really distracting

# outsold taylor

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Taylor "no body no crime feat. HAIM" Swift who?

**vagenda** (9.3): No Body No Crime owes this song reparations

**steelstepladder** (7.5): I think between this and No Body No Crime I just don't like murder songs from pop artists. Musically it's good though

**jman457** (7.1): This reminds if Andy Grammer wrote No Body No Crime, but also can hear the Beyonce influences clearly

# outsold kesha

**akanewasright** (10): Lyrically, this is Kesha’s Hunt You Down without any of the... weird shit in those lyrics (no slurs, for example). Sonically, this song is off the fucking rails and I love it.

# outsold... ariana???

**SmileAndTears** (4): Hmmm I don't really like this sorry. Sounds like a song that could've been on Sweetener, and not one of the good ones

# i didn't know this and this is really cool 

**IIIHenryIII** (9): The pre-chorus is the opposite of Baby Girl's post-chorus, it makes the song 100 times better. It's one of my favorite moments off the entire album. Fourth or fifth best track!
[/r/popheads/comments/nogneu/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_3_everytime_you/h005vuo/]

=====

IIIHenryIII: I must have been drunk when I wrote this because I don't think I got my point across, or maybe I just don't know how to speak English (?) lol What I meant is that baby girl's post chorus ruins the song for me, whereas the pre-chorus in tipsy has the opposite effect: it makes the song a lot better.

IT'S JUST SO FUN!! FUCK YOU CREME!! I didn't really know what citypop was before I'd heard this, but now a year later, being more versed in music I'd like to think, it's wild how perfect of a definition that is for this style - It really feels like I'm just stood in Leicester Square staring up at all the lights and the billboards and just letting the city envelop me and it is such a nice feeling. I grew up in the city but moved away as a young teenager so it feels like quite a nostalgic and comforting place to me, which I think is why this song feels so purely joyous.

---

# living their best life, thrivin'

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): As an Asian kid who grew up in a foreign country with strict parents, this is like the pop-rock anthem that my teenage/young adult self has been looking for all his life. I would often rebel by telling my parents that I would be home early only to return home at almost midnight and I would blame the traffic for it lmao. Good times.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): My Life as a Teenage Robot theme song fucking SLAPPED

**afs** (10): Anime intro now... this girl is trying everything and doing great at it. AND it has a saxophone. AND it has a key change.

**anothertown** (10): this has existential breakdown juice in it

**bespectacIed** (10): Probably my least favorite song on the album but I cannot give this less than a 10, it's still an excellent track. Love the 8-bit realness

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I put this on in the whip and a friend said it sounds like it should play on Rainbow Road

**cashewconstellation** (10): i love this song so much, it's so..... carefree, rebellious, i love it

**celladonn** (10): This just captures a specific atmosphere so perfectly

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Hi creme!

**fadedblue09** (10): This feels so carefree, and that key change in the final chorus...yas

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is such a fucking MOOOOOD

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Rina uses a lot of throwback ‘90s/’00s pop sounds in her music and I think it works best when she’s actually using that sound to help comment on what she’s singing about, like on “Ordinary Superstar” where it’s a commentary on ’00s pop icons or on here, where the dated sound palate and almost cartoonish production evoke the nostalgia and youthful carefreeness of the lyrics. Probably my favorite song on the album actually.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Oh fuck!

**liberalitea** (10): this song makes me wanna be a teen and then i remember im 17

**nootnoot781** (10): another song i don’t understand the hate for. it’s so happy and cheesy in a good way unlike one of her other songs

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the chorus is bottled sunshine and OH FUCK THERE'S A SAX

**plastichaxan** (10): euphoria in music form (the feeling not the show)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Anyone who scores this below a 9 was definitely born after 2003

**ReallyCreative** (10): she saw the gays can't drive and said "let me make a driving anthem to commit vehicular felonies to"

**Roxieloxie** (10): I would 11 this if not for CxH, the first time I heard it i became obsessed with it. Its so bouncy and fun and feels like its the theme song for a show or a game from the early 2000s and I truly love that so much

**shhhneak** (10): The 2000s sound effects and references to MSN Messenger? This is camp. Take me back.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this song is so fucking FUN. like... please give it recognition it deserves. i will never trust anyone who hears this and does not have a good time

**TiltControls** (10): this is a bop and deserves more love!

**waluigiest** (10): the chorus was my biggest source of joy in spring 2020

**akanewasright** (9.9): My immediate favorite from the album and a true delight of a song.

**Dekubaku** (9.9): Wasn't expecting such a happy song given the heavy themes of the album but it fits!

**savemeaseat143** (9.9): next best teen tv show intro

**wavingwolves** (9.8): the mention of MSN messenger makes me feel so old

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): this song makes me feel like i'm in the casino stage of a sonic the hedgehog game and a cartoon cat croupier has just handed me a hit of poppers

**camerinian** (9.5): Never has a song made me want to join a spin class more

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): WE LOVE TO SEE IT!

**jsonphile** (9.5): put a sax solo and a key change in a song and oooh I’m there

**juanolsen** (9.5): i know some people don't like it but this one is actually one of my favorite songs from the album, it captures the pure essence of adolescent rebellion so accurately and fun that i can't help but smile Everytime u hear it

**notarobot3675** (9.5): this is such a fun song that i feel gets lost in this album of stellar pop songs. it really does have that youthful energy of a rebellious teen, and idk if ive ever heard a pop song that explores that relationship between parent and kid during those years

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): I loooooove the 2000’s teen movie this song gives me. It’s so punchy and wistful and just sounds like teen rebellion

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): The only thing that holds this back is that the instrumental might be a tad too barebones for me, but it's still a fun, thoroughly enjoyable song that is a little bit of a palette cleanser after Akasaka Sad; love the transition, the key change is decent enough. Again with the different genres of pop - great shimmering, kind of bitpop-inspired, carefree instrumental that pairs with Rina's own carefree reminiscing of her own youthful escapades. Like who needs the FBI when you have Rina's mom, really?

**amiriteor** (9): gained a point for the beginning on headphones

**bbfan132** (9): super fun!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song makes me nostalgic for a childhood/adolescence I definitely did not have lol. Also that sax.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): idk this is just the perfect warm weather vibe song

**musical\_pyn** (9): I was super surprised to find out people don't like this, this was one of my favorites on initial listen, just so different from the rest of the album while still being rina

**poptartchill** (9): it's just so catchy!!

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Is there a version of this somewhere without the overly long intro? That version is a 10

**Stryxen** (9): this song is about me and the girls in beatsense

**SupremeShani** (9): i definitely relate to this because i totally rebelled against my parents when i was a kid and had an exciting childhood yup yup, but for real though, she literally ended this with a sax solo and a key change, literally has popheads by its balls

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Absolute Bop

**Turpamutteri** (9): this was the standout track when I first listened to the album

**vayyiqra** (9): Unironically, only 90s kids will remember this. It captures a lot of highly specific things about growing up in the 2000s very well.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Honestly surprised to see a track like this on this album… It’s so fun and unabashedly bubblegum pop-y!

**salivantsonority** (8.7): I think this is the most underrated track on the record. Just joyful.

**urfavgalpal** (8.7): lowkey traumatized by this song because it’s my island theme song on Animal Crossing and I haven’t visited my island in so long and I just know that my villagers are gonna be upset that I haven’t talked to them in so long and there will be so many weeds and I’m just so scared to open the game again.  Anyway I like this a lot!  Very fun gives me some retro vibes.  Kinda reminds me of the song “paradisin by the dashboard light” idk if that’s the right name for that song because I only ever knew the Glee version but that’s the vibe I get from it.  Great and relatable

**vagenda** (8.6): I feel like I hear people hating on this song often….couldn’t be me

**jasannn** (8.5): Every great album needs amazing summer song.

**Qustomar** (8.5): The way people hate on this song feels like a personal attack towards me?

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): It sounds like she's telling her life story on a sugar rush over a Sonic the Hedgehog instrumental

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): BOP

**throwaway7650** (8.5): like the song and I like the lyrics even more. so relatable

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): I've never heard a song about overprotective parents like this before and its a really cool song idea

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): ooh an asian mom song, didn’t know I needed this

=====

Awkward_King: **WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Love the transition

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): can’t relate. shitty parents, traumatic childhood and whatnot.

**J\_Toe** (8): i like how this song sounds like I'm listening to it from someone else's car radio on a warm Summer's day at the seaside.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): This song sounds like it would fit in on the original Pokemon soundtrack 2BA Master (a compliment)

**nick1372** (8): the backstory for this song is incredible and really adds to it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): definition of fun

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): And back to the Y2K vibes in this album. I can just picture this song being used in the background of like a Polly Pocket ad or something

**jman457** (7.2): Like how the tempo speeds up throughout it

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I miss being a toddler in the early 2000s.

# 80/20 split

**KennyEarthman** (8): the transition from Akasaka Sad and the sax solo saved this from being a meh song

**pig-serpent** (8): This should be the best song here as it has a fantastic hook, but the song doesn't quite decide if it wants to be a punk rocker or a nice snyth piece. It's trying to climb two ladders at once and the result is disappointing.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): not groundbreaking but super fun and earworm-y

**bigbigbee** (7): I ALMOST love this song. I really love the bridge, and I think the chorus melody is great…but the verses and overall it’s just missing something for me. I really wanted to like this more. It reminds me a little of Avril.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): i was not expecting the saxophone. Also I am to young to know how msn worked so that took me a second. On the genius lyrics she says she was drinking at 14 on a weekly basis and even without that comment the song does definitely like sets up the relationship between her and her mom really well? Like I think you can get the overbearing parent from Rina but also understand the concern of a parent who doesn’t know where their kid is in a city like London.

**nooodisaster** (7): Really like the lyrical storytelling here, tho the production is less my flavor.

**welcome2thejam** (7): That first minute always puts me en route to Skipsville, but if I can make it past that, it's pretty smooth sailing from there and my reward is dat sax

# creme and her alts

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is cute but not a favorite of mine, it’s a tad too cheesy

**jaztinax** (6.5): the extra 0.5 is for the modulation and the saxophone bc all the other elements are kind of forgettable

**runaway3212** (6.5): annoying, but the end is good

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): this is fine

**iniekcja\_** (6): that chorus kinda saves it

**Oberionsynth** (6): Rina, you got school in the morning, get in the car

**Vultuxe** (6): I didn't hate it, but like the previous song it just feels kinda silly? I don't know how to describe it. It's not that silly songs are a bad thing but it's not what I expected and I don't think she's trying to sound like that? But if she is, then it does not come off that way to me.

**Alumineous** (5): SKIP! To be honest, I'm surprised this is a popular favourite! I never really got into it.

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): i hate this song and i make no apologies about that.

**cremeebrulee** (3): i know this is a fan fave but i really cannot hear what everyone else is hearing in this song. i don’t hear the 90s theme song vibes this is supposed to give off, and honestly the chorus is kinda annoying to me

# the duality of popheads

**xaviersi** (9): this would have been a 10 if it was not for the ending

**1998tweety** (8.5): would be a 10 if not for the intro

# 💀 i was born in 2003

**geraldinewww** (8.1): i was in a (non-popheads) music discord server talking about this song and this kid i was talking to goes "yeah i wasn't even born when she had her first kiss" and i aged 20 years reading his comment. i miss MSN messenger

I played the fuck out of this when it came out, to the point where as good as it obviously is it doesn’t like pack quite the emotional punch it did straight away, but god it’s good. I think many people agree with the sentiment that this feels very nostalgic of the beginning of the pandemic, still hopeful but also quite sorrowful. The song really feels like a warm hug if I’m honest, the outro is heavenly and the melody of the chorus just feels like bliss. Honestly, I memed Jules' comment of this in the banner, but it's a really nice story and does a better job of encapsulating feelings linked to this song than I ever could so give that a read!

# i will always love you, i'll love this song forever, even when its not top 10

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): Lovely, sentimental, love the analogy of an AI professing its love in a robotic apocalypse, just the right amount of distortion along with how dramatic it is

**bigbigbee** (11): I know that separation from our loved ones can make people feel really sad during the pandemic, and this song may invoke those feelings of missing/emptiness for some people. For me, though, this song makes me feel love, first and foremost; Charli repeating “I love you forever” is like a reassuring mantra for me. I do love you all, my friends. I’ll love you forever. I’ll see you on the other side!

**Brendon-Urine** (11): best song of the rate, best song of 2020, best song of the decade so far, THE definitive quantine song, shall I continue? (for real this is a life-defining song for me I absolutely could keep going)

**hunnybee12** (11): when the music video dropped i watched it on loop and just cried about how miserable quarantine was making me :)))) anyways this song and album are really special to me and arrived when I really needed it

**joeeswift** (11): one of three songs to ever make me cry, charli should be honoured

**nooodisaster** (11): A fucking masterpiece. There's so much emotion in this: sorrow at time moving past a relationship, hope that the memory will still stay, maturity that both things can be true. The song feels like it's tearing itself apart during the bridge from the sheer weight of it all. Add the extra layer of meaning that when this song released no one could see anyone and the nostalgia for simply existing (which the mv captured brilliantly), and you have the highlight of this project.

**Raykel** (11): I'm always a fan of Charli's more upbeat songs, so the fact that I fell in love with this song as much as I did really subverted my expectations. It's so comforting. Even if the subject is bittersweet, it gives me nostalgia for past friendships/relationships. The intro is my favorite in her discog. It gives me the same feeling I get when falling, except I land in the rest of the song's warm blanket.

**runaway3212** (11): so I get very drunk one night and this was the only song I wanted to hear that entire night, I was with one friend and she got so so annoyed at me, but gave into me anyway, I started playing it at like 10 pm and when I woke up the next day at 9 am it was still playing. I didn't listen to it ever after that until this rate, but I do genuinely think it's the best song here, it's fun but also tackles insecurity in relationships, which is one of my favourite themes in music, furthermore it really goes deep into the 'i hate the silence, that's why the music's always loud' part of hyperpop, showcasing that behind the loud noises, artists are hiding their true feeling and insecurities and the loud noises just give more meaning to these emotions in my opinion.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Without fail, I start crying a little when the third minute kicks in. Charli’s vulnerability in bracing for the worst in the future while cherishing the memories of the past moves me to my core. Hyperpop is often said to be a style cloaked in irony, but the harsh sounds here just bring out Charli’s raw sincerity and lovely melodies even more, sounding like a literal emotional breakdown while she sings the heartbreakingly simple sentiment of “I’ll love you forever, even when we’re not together”.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (11): me and my friends made it into the video and it just makes me so emotional, i love this song sm its v special to me

**bbfan132** (10): didn’t totally click with me at first but i love it now - i particularly love the whooshing sound in the background lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not only a super touching song, but easily the best "quarantine music video" I saw last year.

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**celladonn** (10): The video is an 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): the chanel to stuck with u’s walmart

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean, this was a moment. Early quarantine this got me on my feeling a LOT. I’ve ugly cried to this song before.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): When this song first came out, it hit me that we were truly experiencing the pandemic universally. It's a bittersweet feeling about not being sure when you are able to see our loved ones for a while when going out (with not much information about the virus at that time compared now) is a huge risk. This is the case for me when I heard this song again for the rate and it hit me that I haven't seen my friends physically for a year now. This song is definitely a quarantine anthem and the music video is a reflection of that feeling. When I hear this song years after the pandemic is over, I will remember the bittersweet feelings I had over that song when I miss seeing my friends and being able to go out freely. And gosh, I can't blame Charli for writing this emotional ballad for her boyfriend cause damn he can get it. I hope Charli and Huck Kwong stick together forever. ?

**fairytalehigh** (10): the brightest spot of the beginning of the godless hellhole of 2020, with an instantly iconic MV to boot

**frogaranaman** (10): this shit go wild

**ggal2020** (10): the song that defined early quarantine for me. every time I listen to it I’m transported back to early quarantine, trying to get into charli’s zoom raves and spinning around my room to this song on repeat.

**hakkerj** (10): The video makes me cry

**iniekcja\_** (10): Charli is one of the few artists that have love songs I actually like

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): I think for a solid week, I was just playing this, “Busy Boy”, and “Ungodly Hour” (spoiler alert for some of my faves in this rate lmao) back to back to back as though no other songs existed. To me, I love dedicating this song to my various boys that I’ve fallen in infatuation with but I know it’ll never progress into something huge.

**Leixander** (10): alexa, what is the definition of bittersweet perfection?

**ManofOranges** (10): There's something just so sweet and genuine about this song. It really does perfectly give across the feeling of "I'll love you forever."

**nick1372** (10): it’s really incredible how this song captures the sweet feeling of being with someone you love but there’s this almost imperceptible sad undertone to it that’s pure genius

**Palutzel** (10): such a beautiful song, it throws me back to the lockdown

**pig-serpent** (10): I love the haziness of this song (sorry CxH). It's a great song just to let the sound wash over you, and the growing decent into noise is fairly unique for this type of song.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): so this song makes me weep every time without fail. it's so heartfelt and then thinking about SOPHIE and i just UGH. i don't know if it's getting older and reflecting on my own friendships. but as someone who falls hard and falls fast in friendship love, i have def felt this frenetic, desperate energy because you want so much of somebody and you know that you'll always be connected, except that you won't. but they will still always have a place in your heart, even after they have moved on, or they are gone forever. UGH.

=====

Awkward_King: **RandomHypnotica** (10): When the song first released, I wasn't too crazy over it. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't super strong. But when Charli released the music video, it all just kinda clicked, the memories you make with loved ones will stick with you forever, even if they aren't in your lives anymore.

**rosecoloreds** (10): i don't care what anyone says but just that last part 'front of my mind you stay right in the front of my mind' deserved a grammy. in every category.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The problem with releasing the best song from the album as the lead single is that the rest of the songs don’t seem as good in comparison to this. As good as the other songs are, none of the rest of the album resonates with me emotionally as much as this one does

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): This song makes me fucking sad

**TiltControls** (10): this is great!

**waluigiest** (10): gorgeous perfect vignette of pandemic month 2

**wavingwolves** (10): thinking about how i cried when i saw the music video for this for the first time

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Tfw no bf

# all the people who clearly love this song but cost it making top 10 by not giving it a 10

**akanewasright** (9.5): This song is just too damn sweet. I’m lonely so I can’t relate BUT I do love vicariously through other people’s happiness so I still like it

**camerinian** (9.5): I've rarely heard so much beauty in so much noise

**pheromenos** (9.5): one of the songs that defined my days in lockdown, i know it was just last year but a lot has changed since then. already feeling so nostalgic listening to it again.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this was quite the cultural reset (but seriously, this coming out with the announcement of the album + having such a cute video with the angels and their videos was really beautiful, i love you charli baby)

**Qustomar** (9.5): Love how this song is simultaneously abrasive and soft/warm/inviting.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Honestly some of the best verses I've ever heard. The waves supplement the melody of the vocals absolutely perfectly.

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): one of the best charli songs

**juanolsen** (9.3): probably the best song in the album, i love when charli gets emotional and this song is a great example of this

**jman457** (9.2): Its honestly such a sweet song

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I remember when the Popheads were like “omg so emotional” but like I can’t get past this production, it’s so next level.

**amiriteor** (9): UGH im fucking sad

**fadedblue09** (9): The verses are not pleasant to listen to but wow that chorus is perfection, makes it all worth it.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): this is such a cute song

**liberalitea** (9): the change in the instrumentals from the verse to the chorus is so good but the part after the 2nd chorus to the outro is meh

**poptartchill** (9): going into this rate I knew I liked this one. Still do! Good song that gets stuck in my head from time to time

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): One of my favorite songs and videos from last year. I love how warm and authentic it sounds despite using the exact same sounds as songs like Pink Diamond

**urfavgalpal** (9): this begins the stretch of the album that tells the story of Charli’s relationship and imho has all the truly great songs (the stretch ends at I finally understand). There’s so much in this little song.  It’s a love song but a breakup song but not because it’s about an end that has yet to come and it’s really beautiful.  You feel the bitter sweetness but also the love.  I also like all the little details in this song’s production.  I love when AG slows it down and used the weirdness of PC music as a detail and not the focus.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): How can a song with such loud, static-y, and grating effects still manage to sound beautiful and sentimental? idk charli magic

**wasian-invasion** (9): really love the waves of sound on here

**zagreux** (9): girl. the pots and pans here. fuck me up ms xbox.

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): nice outro

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): This should've been the first track.

**jasannn** (8.5): I love the contrast between the highly textured verse to the cute lovey-dovey chorus.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): such a cute song

**UselessTacooo** (8.3): still one of the best songs of this year

**afs** (8): it also has that noise aspect but in much smaller doses, which is how it should be done

**J\_Toe** (8): the video made up of fan footage in early lockdown is really cute!

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): Hyperpop done well, in a way that is fun and different and still enjoyable enough for casual listening (to my immature ear palate)

**musical\_pyn** (8): bop

**SupremeShani** (8): Love the isolated, pandemic-inspired loneliness vibe she managed to capture in this song.

**vayyiqra** (7): I love retro-sounding synths like this. It reminds me of playing old video games as a kid.

**notarobot3675** (6.5): There is something sweet about this song that I really like and find touching.

# anti pots and pans

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): This gets a high rating mostly because the way the song opens is like nothing ive ever heard and is just... really cool. However........ the rest of the song is just fine.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The thing that frustrates me about a lot of Charli’s work the past few years is that she is genuinely a great songwriter and you can hear the bones of a wonderful pop song here but for some reason she insists on burying them beneath all of this pointless noise that just distorts what we’re actually here for. I don’t think that “noise pop” or whatever is a bad genre and I think the overwhelming, “peeling apart” sounds she uses here can be effective in other contexts, but I don’t think that this is what she’s good at and I wish she’d just tone it back because I want to like this but I can’t.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): okay this is cute. first charli song i've ever saved. the chorus is really pretty

**throwaway7650** (7.5): love the chorus melody and it's a nice song in general but I'm not really a fan of the "noisy" elements of this song

**cashewconstellation** (7.3): i was actually gonna slander this song cause i was very underwhelmed when it came out but it's not bad

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the lyrics and her vocals but the production is so unnecessary at times it kind of ruins the song

**Oberionsynth** (7): this is cute but i'm single and just found out i owe 700 dollars in taxes, so i'm in the mood for a tax fraud anthem atm honestly

**pat-rickstar** (7): I never liked this as much as most people seemed to, it's good but I never really went back to it once the album dropped

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I really disliked this on first listen, mostly because the production felt so much messier than Charli and Pop 2, but the more time I’ve been able to sit with it the more I’ve realized its alright.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): pandemic romance core but kinda forgettable sorry

**targetguest** (6.5): probably my least favorite on the album, still excellent

**LostintheCosmicFire** (6): Remember when everyone was like oh "we are going to get out of this being a better humankind and more united?" and I believe that during this time and this video reflects this belief very well, but obviously that didn't happen. It's way too naive

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's fine but nothing to write home about

**CreepyMannequin** (5): This is just kind of there.

**Raxxin** (5): i forget what this one sounds like always but i'm sure it's okay

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Fourever.

**KennyEarthman** (4): waiting forever for this to get to the ending aka the only good part of the song

**mudkip1** (4): aged like milk

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (3): lyrically this is very sweet and cute, sonically the wave like sound hurts my ears

**ImADudeDuh** (2): when i can hear the lyrics behind the static, this sentiment seems nice

**Vultuxe** (1): How can I dislike a Charli song that even the straight incels of rateyourmusic coveted? For whatever reason, I don't get the buzz around this one. The "noise"... is SO loud and abrasive, it's just unpleasant to my ears. The lyrics are so barebone, the melody doesn't click with me. I think the saving grace of the song is the outro.

**1998tweety** (0): what sucks so much about this song is it would actually be pretty good if not for the random noise at some points, and like it's not one of those songs where I feel like it's necessary, it actively takes away from the listening experience for me. I will never understand what y'all see in this song.

Awkward_King: # how i'm feeling now

---

**Overall Average**: 7.601 **// Average Controversy:** 2.045

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.818): I think I might not be exaggerating when I say hifn is probably the closest I will get to a perfect record. When the 'weak spots' don't really feel like weak spots at all and the whole record is just one banger after the next, deliciously abrasive yet sentimental, lovely yet catchy with every shade of brightness and darkness, it makes such an album that was put together in such a short amount of time so valuable. It makes me so happy to see Charli constantly improve and make pop records so daring yet accessible, and just overall pop perfection.

**Brendon-Urine** (9.773): WOW i love this album. so so so so much. It's absolutely THE album of quarantine, and I can't think of another one that comes close to competing for that title. I know in 30 years when this whole time period is a fading memory, I will associate it with this album. If it doesn't cement Charli as the greatest pop star (and musical act) active rn idk what can

**RandomHypnotica** (9.573): Charli is one of my favourite artists, but HIFN is still far and away my favourite project by her. I truly adore this project back to front, it's always going to be a great time capsule of the start of Quarantine, but it's also just got some absolutely amazing songs on it. Perhaps I enjoy it because the themes of loneliness and self-doubt REALLY resonated with me, but there's also bangers like Pink Diamond that just make me move like nothing else. It's my favourite project in this rate, and I REALLY hope it doesn't get done dirty (but I know it will...)

**kirby31200** (9.545): The best quarantine album that actually is about the quarantine. It's incredible she followed up the masterpiece that is Charli with another masterpiece.

**plastichaxan** (9.445): this album is incredible and not even one of charli’s best… her power… but honestly, this is the best quarantine album since it’s concept and such an event as an angel i will never forget

**steelstepladder** (9.373): Probably the album I am going to think about the most when reflecting on my quarantine listening

**camerinian** (9.318): yeah it's ok

**conceptualromance** (9.182): this album was exactly what I needed last May

**Palutzel** (9.145): call me dramatic, but this is a modern masterpiece

**hakkerj** (9.064): Charli XCX REALLY set the precedent for quarantine albums

**iniekcja\_** (9.045): I always wonder if this specific collection of music would be received so well if it wasn't for the global lockdown, I would say sonically it's one of her weaker projects since the Vroom Vroom rebrand but the circumstances make it feel much better

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.009): personally, not my fav of her work, but it is close

**pig-serpent** (9.000): I didn't love this immediately, but over time I found this to be exactly the quarantine album I needed and it grew into my aoty. Every song on here can be partied too or vibed too depending on how loud you feel like listening to it. A comfort album to sooth my wildly changing states of mind.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.909): Tbh I don’t like the cover. She could’ve worn black, white on white is pretty bland.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.773): Listening to this album a year later after it was made was quite an experience and it felt different from when I first heard it. This is definitely an album I am going to look back on as a classic for different reasons. It's going to age a bit due to the fact this was a "quarantine " album but I think anyone who was able to hear this album when it came out is going to have some kind of attachment to it due to the memories they have during quarantine.

**nick1372** (8.409): Charli has a lot of good songs in her discography, but she’s always lacked the focus to create a cohesive album. The lockdown gave her that opportunity and this is by far my favorite album of hers! It really made me expect a flood of incredible lockdown music from all my favorite artists and that was absolutely not the case, but I am thankful for this album and I’m glad I had it to help me cope with such a terrible year.

**nooodisaster** (8.318): this album is the dark horse of this rate it's just sooo quality and will be out at #5.

**anothertown** (8.273): this album is fine but extremely boring. It’s emblematic of the non-depressed people who were very upset by quarantine for 3 months

**wasian-invasion** (8.273): Parts of this don't connect as well as they did a year ago, but I still appreciate it for being a perfect snapshot of 2020 angst. Even though it's got some of her top songs, I haven't come back to it as much as Charli or Pop 2

**EnCaine** (8.273): not nearly my favorite thing charli has done but still good af, i've loved her since I Love It and i've only been rewarded

**jman457** (8.191): its low key, minimalist production compared to Charli’s other bombastic production makes it a fav of mine.

**akanewasright** (8.155): this is an album that very much reflects the circumstances under which it was created. It’s messy, heartfelt, and restless, and I love that for it.

**ktajlili** (8.091): I haven't listened to this album in full since the start of the pandemic, and wow does it feel like a lightning in the bottle. It was hard for me to process my emotions at the time. It was such a scary, awful, and miserable time that I don't plan to return to this anytime soon. But damn, does Charli deliver.

**pat-rickstar** (8.091): Charli is one of my absolute favourite artists and I love a lot of songs here but it's just not my favourite album of hers. With some of the songs it's a little too obvious that they were made in a short time period

**thedoctordances1940** (8.091): While it's not her best work, I definitely still prefer Charli and Pop 2, she keeps up the consistency she's shown over the last few years and for just how quickly it was made, it is really impressive.

**welcome2thejam** (7.909): I've loved a handful of Charli's tracks, but I've never really clicked with any of her full albums til this one. And while I'm curious to see how it holds up as quarantine eases up around me, the fact that it's only gotten better in my re-listens this week bodes well.

**buddhacharm** (7.864): While I don't think it's as versatile or as robust as Charli/Pop 2, I still think it's an essential listen because it serves as an incredible and disorienting encapsulation of the heavy and mind-numbing nature of 2020. It really does capture the zeitgeist unlike any album I've heard in recent memory, and I think it certainly offers really valuable, introspective, and morose reflections on the state of the world during the VERY specific window of time that it took to craft this record. Thankfully, the album is just as special and volatile as the conditions that informed its make, though I'd be lying if I said that I've returned to it as much as I have her self-titled; maybe that's because HIFN is so inextricable from the triggering imagery that surrounded the first lockdown ??

**bigbigbee** (7.818): I liked this album, then it grew off me, then I started to love it again recently. And the songs that I liked at first are not the songs that I like now. So in the end, I’ve felt every kind of way about this album and I can understand both the people who call it incredible and the people who call it crap. Ultimately, when this album is on, I love the way the songs make me feel – wistful, then inspired; powerful, then sweet.

**waluigiest** (7.818): I was lucky enough to be in the first Zoom meeting about this album. It’s a serve and it’s a legendary piece of quarantine art, but it loses me around the middle tracks

**Roxieloxie** (7.773): im feeling sad

**Qustomar** (7.773): This album is good, I generally like pretty much anything Charli puts out lol. The whole pandemic context gives it a very interesting atmosphere, and seeing everything be created in real-time from the songs to the fan chosen artworks was really cool and memorable. Just what I would love is for this album to be converted into a 1-2 hour, continuous night club DJ set you know? I wanna hear the production of every song get intertwined, every stem of the instrumentals slowly get added and taken away, hear the chaos build up and then go down. I think that would help a few of the more 'underdeveloped' sounding songs get polished, and then some of the other songs could become really really epic and allow the listener to fully relish in the production (especially the last 3 tracks omg).

**vayyiqra** (7.727): I finally understand ... the hype over this album! When it came out I wasn't that into it and found it to be not too memorable. Now I can happily say it is a grower and I enjoy it quite a bit. I like Charli a lot and always have (I first saw her live in 2014) so it's been neat to see her change over time and also write more personal lyrics on this record. The glitchy, distorted sound on some tracks does take some getting used to but after that, it's pretty enjoyable (and relatable).

**fadedblue09** (7.682): Now how did this get such a high average for me? In all seriousness, I’m surprised how much I liked this, considering I normally do not vibe with Charli’s music. I was ready to dismiss this as a bunch of Pop 2/Charli rejects, but it does feel like an album of its own. I love the lyrical themes and the lack of features, it definitely felt like a product of her isolation and there’s an intimate feel here that I haven’t felt from her since True Romance. Her abrasive production is still not for me, but at least I understand her artistry a bit more now.

Awkward_King: ---

**geraldinewww** (7.618): i will say this is my least favorite album in the rate and i am not really a charli fan, though it's not bad. a lot of the album just didn't stand out for me. her continued turn into hyperpop is interesting though and she's still a legend for GUYS ITS SUNDAY

**just\_thonking** (7.591): Didn't blow my mind but very consistent

**sirpancakeXI** (7.545): i have a really mixed feeling for this album there are some song that i enjoy very much and have been on loop but there are also songs that i won't bother to relisten

**liberalitea** (7.545): This is a great album however, with some absolute bangers, but the lows are really low in her discography. I like it as a whole, but I think of all her hyperpop projects, this is one of or the weakest.

**zagreux** (7.500): Um yasss  queen  skinny legend  Versace boots  the house  down slay queen  hunty mama and I oop daddy  work ? Charli XCX  snatch my wig ?

**jayjaysortagay** (7.455): a really good album, I might have scored it sort of low but that's only in comparison to the others in this rate!

**skargardin** (7.455): This album has grown off me a lot I fear this past year. It's still a fun listen with some missteps though.

**jasannn** (7.155): There's no bad songs on here but I don't love any of them. They tend to blend in together to create an end product that I can only describe as being beige. Forever and claws are obvious highlights but even then I rather just listen to Pop 2 again. But props to Charli for making this album in such a short time and making a good quarantine album.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.091): I was kind of upset that I didn’t end up liking this album more, tbh. Charli was one of my favorite 2019 albums and I ended up feeling like this fell a little short of what I wanted from it. The vocal production on almost all the songs is unnecessary and there are some underwhelming tracks. There are also some absolutely great tracks too though, and, I mean, it’s still a good album. Just not my favorite XCX era.

**poptartchill** (7.091): This is an album I don't really listen to. I think what she did is very cool but this isn't really the style of pop I'm into. I can respect it. My thing is that a lot of these songs are meh to me and blend together. There are some standouts, of course, but yeah. Not for me, but I appreciate it. Maybe it'll grow on me eventually.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.045): I'm not a fan of her other albums. They all have some tracks that don't do anything to me, but a few bangers too. However, this changed after this album. I really dig what she did here. Most tracks sound so chill yet are totally bangers. I didn't give higher scores to the songs I really like because they all still have something that kinda throws me off. It's my least favorite album among the four on this rate.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.864): the best "quarantine" album to come out of the panda express. this is charlis magnum opus; everything she does well cumulates her into a perfect blend

**notarobot3675** (6.773): this is one of those albums that I know is objectively good, but on a personal level was just alright for me. charli's discog is one that I overall have pretty mixed feelings about: either I love her work (no1. angel and pop 2 being big examples) or its just okay. pc music as a genre is one that is extremely hit or miss for me, and so I find that when her songs lean more heavily into that sound, they just don't resonante much with me. this album was filled with some real gems, and I'm glad I gave it a relisten for this rate!

**oscarbrierley1** (6.773): some of the songs are just noise but some of it's really good

**KennyEarthman** (6.727): pros: has some nice hyperpop bops with a rougher production style. a reflection of the pandemic era // cons: the lyrics get extremely repetitive and that makes the instrumentals better than the song itself sometimes

**ElizabethDDoS** (6.545): This isn't that good. Y'all really gassed it up just because it was the first major quarantine release by a fave that hardly missed until this point. ?

**afs** (6.364): I guess hyperpop isn't for me is it? But there's a ton of redeemable qualities hidden in all the raving and autotune. I know what it's like to be an old fart now, though.

**ReallyCreative** (6.245): Loved this album on release but it did not age well. It's just incredibly juvenile at points compared to the other albums in this rate, and even Charli's prior work.

**Vultuxe** (6.045): I feel that this record fell victim to a trope of hyperpop so to speak, where lately songs and records are trying their hardest to be as loud and gimmicky and annoying as possible. It's the reason I like PC Music -- their music is so immaculate, it feels professional and polished. HIFN, while having a couple highlights, is an amateur hyperpop record at best, without Charli's name on it I would not have given it much of a second thought.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.045): This is an album that I really want to like, but so many of the songs are just “there” for me, hovering around the 4-6 range. They’re not bland, but they never capture my attention.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.955): I love the raw and vulnerable lyrics on this album but sometimes it does not mesh with the production style at all for some songs, making the song hard to listen to. I know that’s the hyper pop schtick but I think it would have been better if more songs were like Enemy or Detonate if she wanted to have more raw lyrics.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.909): This album is so hard to rate against the other ones… it’s like in a completely different language than the other three, and my biggest concern was trying to make sure I rated it fairly in relation to the others. Ultimately I am NOT a PC Music kind of guy (though there are some SOPHIE tracks I kinda like!) so I did my best in trying not to judge these tracks too harshly. In the end, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would!

**SmileAndTears** (5.727): When Charli isn't doing the pc music thing she's just a female The 1975, and that's not a compliment. So much of this album is just random noises added in to cover up the atrocious lyrics and to make sure the songs don't sound too basic. Overall it's fine but I don't understand the obsession with Charli XCX tbh

**TiltControls** (5.409): "Oh Charli's in this?". In all honesty, this album (and a lot of Charli's work) is just not really for me. There were some standouts like forever and detonate, but compared to the other 3 albums I could not enjoy it nearly as much overall.

**jsonphile** (5.364): okay I really tried to enjoy it. And I kinda like some of the melodies on here they’re kinda catchy. But man do I not get the production. Maybe ten years from now I’ll come back to this album and it’ll finally click for me but man I just can’t get into it sorry Charli

**bespectacIed** (5.091): better than self-titled

**shhhneak** (4.964): Extremely not my kind of music. Hyperpop production is usually too abrasive for my old ass. I also don’t pay attention to the Charli discourse so I have no idea what’s actually considered “good” in this.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.673): how i'm feeling now? like i never want to listen to shit again

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4.591): The record started and I was amazed at my scores. I'm giving 5s and 6s? Was I really just too harsh on this record when I first heard it? Has 100 gecs existing really changed my mind about what sort of music is terrible music to me? Well, it turned out that the answer was no, it is an album that starts strongly and then descends into sounds and instrumentation that I just do not care for. Sorry Charli, I almost was able to appreciate you. Maybe next time.

**welcometoNY** (4.573): i'm a charli stan so this pains me to say, but wow i really did not like this album. this is what i imagine people are talking about when they say they don't like pop music. it's noisy for no reason, there are barely a handful of melodies to speak of, and 80% of the lyrics can only be described as lazy. there are bright spots, like claws, but this simply pales in comparison to the plethora of brilliant albums released last year.

**NotWith10000Men** (4.182): ms. xcx i'm so sorry but I had to do it. fellow popheads, if you like this... i'm happy for you, really, but I simply don't get it.

**ImADudeDuh** (4.091): I have been very open with my dislike for almost all of Charli XCX’s output since 2018. It’s not my genre of music, and I really do not like basically all the music from PC Music/Hyperpop/whatever the genre is called artists. This album was the only one that I wrote comments for each song (even tho most of it is just memes) because I don’t want people to think I just blindly hate this album and didnt give it a chance. I did, and liked some of the songs, but as a whole this was not a fun listen.

I'm so glad I included this in the rate because it's such a brilliantly crafted pop song, it's so fun melodically and the subject matter is very simple and exact, but well done! Elio and Charli work brilliantly here together, and I still need to get into more of Elio's stuff beyond this and u and me but mostly me. I don't know if I'd call this outlasting Born To Play an upset but? I don't think people expected it. And the results were fucking *close* too.

---

**Vultuxe** (10): I'm biased towards ELIO, a few of their songs are stellar and CHARGER is one of them.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is WAYYY better than it has any right to be, the original was a cute moment, but the addition of Charli just elevates it another level

**ReallyCreative** (9): ELIO's album/EP thing is actually a really great listen, I recommend, and Charli takes this already good track and adds some fun elements to it

**racloves** (8): is it controversial to say I think I slightly prefer the original elio version

# should all check out more of elio's stuff :DDD

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): one of my fav Charli features

**bigbigbee** (10): This was my favorite surprise in the bonus rate. It’s so cute.

**liberalitea** (10): one of my favourite Charli features and it's a sound that I miss from her. Just her vocals really.

**pig-serpent** (10): The instrumental on this song is really good and the hook is really catchy. I'm trying not to overly Charli stan here, but this is easily my favorite discovery of this rate

**nick1372** (9.5): Love how this takes something so simple into something so dramatic

**fadedblue09** (9): This slaps actually

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): banger

**skargardin** (9): hold on this bops hard af

**vayyiqra** (9): fun bleepbloop song

**waluigiest** (9): honestly it’s excellent

**Palutzel** (8.6): bop

**jasannn** (8.5): This is why you have two chargers.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): cute bop

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Had to listen a few times to recognize Charli’s voice on this, they sound a lot alike - it’s a fun and catchy song.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): first time I'm hearing this and I really like the vibe but it kinda feels incomplete

**bespectacIed** (8): never heard of this, this is fun??

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): That chorus alone is a 10

**fairytalehigh** (8): perfectly pleasant song but it hardly even registers as a charli feature. i put it on a playlist and heard it half a dozen times before i even noticed.

**hikkaru** (8): cute bop

**KennyEarthman** (8): really picks up at the last minute

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8): I love her voice on this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ok i’m normally not into this flavor of dance music but… that was pretty fire

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): ohhh when that beat comes in at 2 minutes

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): ok ok this is good

**throwaway7650** (7.5): "final" (? this song is so short) chorus is really good

**wavingwolves** (7.1): this is cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): What a fun little bop

**bbfan132** (7): pleasant song to chill out to

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It sounds good. I'll be revisiting it.

# bleepbloop music

**afs** (8): Dig the production on this one. ELIO unfortunately sounds like most female singers I've heard.

**runaway3212** (8): cute but not amazing

**jman457** (6.9): cute song, nothing really special though

**urfavgalpal** (6.3): I don’t think Charli’s verse does much of anything here?  The song is cute enough and I’m sure if I listened to it 50 times in a row I would love it but I don’t really feel much of s connection to it

**frogaranaman** (6): it’s cute but basically the original song as far as I can tell

**iniekcja\_** (6): I definitely don't wanna go back

**musical\_pyn** (6): there are some interesting parts

**welcometoNY** (5.5): this is so stupid why does it slap

**notarobot3675** (5.4): yeah this is perfectly fine lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): So Charli didn’t release XCX World but she had time for this… okay

**SupremeShani** (5): i usually love charli as a feature, but this song is just a cute little tune for me

**EnCaine** (4): oops i do not care about this

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): I dont really like Charli on this song sorry :(

This is honestly boosted for me just by how funny I find it that Halle absolutely fucking hates it LMAO. I get why this is a bonus song, I don't think it exactly holds up especially to be more necessary than any of the original tracks, but it is still a very good song and pleasant to listen to.

---

# chloe

**Brendon-Urine** (10): even the bonus songs are amazing whew

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): flawless, stunning, the moment

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait this is good, why didn’t i save this after i first heard it

**iniekcja\_** (10): I really hoped to get a break from maths after my exams...

**KennyEarthman** (10): that chorus is so sexy

**musical\_pyn** (10): another incredible chloe x halle track

**oscarbrierley1** (10): makes me want to cheat on my non existent boyfriend

**plastichaxan** (10): imagine making these whole ass bangers as bonus tracks

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): why they relegated this + "hazy" to bonus tracks is beyond me, they're two of their best from the era. this is my less favorite of the two though

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): could have been on the standard album I fear

**SupremeShani** (9.5): i will never got over the way halle absolutely despises this song every time it would get brought up on the live lmao

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.3): should have been in the main rate x 2

**akanewasright** (9): “I’m a good girl, but you made me bad” with all that vocal fry... Halle you own my life now.

**notarobot3675** (9): this is such a bop! really wish we could get an mv for this

**Oberionsynth** (9): "thinking bout that 20/20" me everytime i try to read a reddit post without my glasses

**urfavgalpal** (8.8): I also have not listened to this enough to know how I feel but I think I’m really into it?

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): I wanted to give this an 8.2 for the joke but this song is just too good for that

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): I like the darker direction on this one more than on Hazy for sure

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Makes me feel like a bad b

**engifear** (8): Well I guess the guy ended up making it harder on her

**liberalitea** (8): I prefer Hazy but this is still a great track

**pig-serpent** (8): The instrumentation is really just alright, but this is easily a stronger hook than anything they laid down for the album and that bumps it up a point or two.

**poptartchill** (8): This could've been on the original album

**waluigiest** (8): about average for the album (so really good)

**wavingwolves** (7.7): this sounds like a bonus song but it's still pretty good

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The better bonus track, but I don't care for it that much I fear

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I like the guitar. It sounds like something I've heard before.

**bbfan132** (6.5): an understandable bonus track, pretty catchy though

# halle

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): halle seems so bored

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Halle was partly right, this ain’t all that, but it is great.

**amiriteor** (8): just sounds like a chloe x halle song

**throwaway7650** (7.5): hazy should've been pushed instead of this

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): kinda feels like are you that somebody?

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): a bit dated, and not in a good way.

**targetguest** (7): and didn't get the hype for this one

**frogaranaman** (6): this is definitely a bonus track

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): ensuring the album has no skips by putting the worst song last ugh their MINDS, queen shit

**runaway3212** (6): meh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): According to the youtube comments (lol) this song is about cheating, and uh… let’s just say when it comes to CxH infidelity songs I prefer “Wonder What She Thinks of Me”

**jman457** (5.8): Glad this was on the deluxe version

**astrologicalangel** (5): I did not want to think about 2020 again thanks

**Vultuxe** (5): Same as the other one... it's a reject. Nothing special.

**afs** (3): I see why Halle dislikes it lol. Also "I'm a good girl but you make me bad"...

This is one of my favourite tracks on the album, and I'm so glad it made it this high up, it ended up being a real dark horse in the rate tbh. This feels the most reminiscent of their prior album, The Kids Are Alright, but I'm not quite sure why? I think it's the way they're singing, it feels very airy which is how I think of tracks like Down and Fall on TKAA! But yes, so glad it lasted this long, even if it just missed the top 10 :sob:

---

# dont make it harder on me HE HEEEEEE

**musical\_pyn** (11): the impeccable harmonies, the strings coming in on the chorus and then when the chorus opens up, and an incredible hook all make this song easily my 11. I absolutely cannot wait for more chloe x halle

**tectec787** (11): their voices are so beautiful, the melodies and harmonies are mwah! I love this song

**TiltControls** (11): best song on the album

**1998tweety** (10): they just cant stop winning wtf

**akanewasright** (10): Seeing them do this song live (at the tiny desk concert of course, I’m not going to concerts) completely changed my opinion on this song. It’s fucking wonderful.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): the best song on the album

**bespectacIed** (10): Always has been, always will be the best song on the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was the other runner-up for my eleven. The vocals, the production, that IMMACULATE PRECHORUS, the lyrics which are firm but also vulnerable. I feel like this is gonna get robbed in the rate and I'm pre-bitter.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this has such a classic sound, the vocals and production are immaculate. And the strings!!! My heart is on the floor in a puddle

**fadedblue09** (10): The vocals here just give me chills.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song was a sleeper hit for me, I didn’t think much of it when I first listened to the album (it didn’t help that it’s sandwiched between two bangers) but over time I’ve really come to appreciate the cinematic storytelling of the track… like something about the juxtaposition between apparent frustration and mounting joy just tickles me pink. Plus the strings are to die for and I actually think this is one of the best choruses on the album! Underrated imo

**ignitethephoenix** (10): their harmonies i ascend

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh WOW

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): So I always liked this song since the release of the album but very recently (inspired by their tiny desk performance which is def a MUST WATCH) I have started to stan it. It’s just such a beautifully created song, with such an angsty subject matter yet an upbeat instrumental (my fave genre of music). And the adlibs in the outro of the song are just chefs kiss. The girlies did their thing here

**jaztinax** (10): the motown vibe in this is immaculate

**KennyEarthman** (10): a dreamy bop my dad would play in the car

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): The harmonies in this one....and then when the strings pick up towards the end....they sound.............godly

**ManofOranges** (10): Now THIS is an immediate standout for me. This song absolutely hooked me right away. Definitely my favorite discovery of this entire rate. Just so amazing.

**nooodisaster** (10): Ugh I adore this song. The old-school style is a great change of pace too.

**ReallyCreative** (10): such a fun fucking track, yet another masterpiece

**shhhneak** (10): Almost my 11. COME THROUGH HARMONIES. And the strings.

**skargardin** (10): VOCALS

**steelstepladder** (10): SO close to getting my 11

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): stunning

**throwaway7650** (10): this song is so cheesy in a good way

**wasian-invasion** (10): the voCALZ

**zagreux** (10): this song is so relatable omfg they were NOT playing around

**Alumineous** (9.9): I try not to use decimals. However, I deducted 0.1 because I don't like it when Chloe belts "meeeEEEeeeEEEEEeeeahhhh" at the end.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): the vocals i just, wow

**savemeaseat143** (9.6): the chorus!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): That's a straight up banger. That pre-chorus is divine. It's actually better than the chorus, which made me shy away from giving it a 10. That pre-chorus is even better than the one on Tipsy.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): god what a good chorus. not that the verses are a drag or anything but that chorus flies

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): I love this sound for them

**wavingwolves** (9.1): wait... ?? let me listening again ??????????

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Such Beyoncé IASF vibes

**bbfan132** (9): such a good album cut ugh

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me listening to this album trying to not give everything 10s

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I love the prechorus especially. You can really feel the pining for an ex better left alone.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Man, this song makes me regret breaking up with my non-existent ex-boyfriend.

**engifear** (9): I'm a sucker for a song with strings

**runaway3212** (9): bop!

**juanolsen** (8.8): really catchy melodies hut the lyrics are a bit clunky

**hakkerj** (8.6): The last 30 seconds of this song goes offfff

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I love how classic this song sounds; it’s a bit of a throwback for me. I think it really compliments the rest of the songs on this record well. It feels like an ending, to me; I think this might have made a great closer on some other iteration of the album.

**EnCaine** (8.5): really dope ending

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): this is so comforting and old timey plus VOCALS ??

**jman457** (8.5): The production and Vocals are on point, they should take advantage of their harmonies more often

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): The production is gorgeous

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): VOCALS!!! This one will not leave my head omfg

**urfavgalpal** (8.5): again not much to say beyond they have gorgeous voices.  Also they have really good story telling ability.

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): this grew on me a lot once i realized what it was about, but not a standout for me

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): A great, well-written ballad that definitely shines in the second half of the record. Love the energy to this one.

**afs** (8): It was only a matter of time until soul makes an appearance, and even though I'm not too into old school stuff, that chorus forces a high score.

**frogaranaman** (8): queens of making relatable love songs when you want to hoe out but then it becomes hoe out with one person

**Oberionsynth** (8): the vocals on this ugh i'm pregnant

**salivantsonority** (8): Mildly cliché and tonally different from the rest of the record. The All Night of this record. But that chorus is really delicious-sounding.

**slimboyfriend** (8): This would have been such a good album closer if the album didn't have two more average songs after this one.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): the tiny desk concert was what got me into this song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): the honda stage version would've gotten a 10

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I never realized how good this song sounds!!

**Vromega** (8): gorgeous instrumentation, especially the violins

**welcome2thejam** (8): Grooving with this one.

**liberalitea** (7): I love this song but can't give it a higher score than this because the message just...idk

**racloves** (7): I’ll tell you what’s hard on me, this rate as I love all of these albums wtf

**Uberpigeon** (7): romcom vibes

# it should be illegal to say anything negative about this song

**pig-serpent** (6): I love some of the twang on the bass here, but overall the song isn't that interesting.

**Vultuxe** (1): What the hell happened to this album? This song is nigh unlistenable. The vocal delivery is tragic.

# everyone thinks they're twins but they're actually just sisters jdsjaks

**SupremeShani** (9): Such a lovely song, I think the sparser production with the strings and plucked guitar works well here with the twin's voices.

If I'm being honest (and a little rude), I never quite bought Rina's explanation that this song was about toxic masculinity and was anything more than a flex song, which I live for in itself, I just always felt like that was a kinda failed attempt to make every song on the album something more than it was. Having said that, this still fucking BOPS. The post-chorus is one of my favourites from the album, she sounds like such a bad-ass, overall this feels so all consumed with attitude and it just works.

---

# Everytime you see me it's like getting 10th in Reno

**frogaranaman** (11): that SYNTH

**vayyiqra** (11): Don't care what anyone says: this is the best song on this album. One of the best songs of last year, in fact. It is a "bop", it's an earworm. The bassline slaps, the lyrics are clever, the half-singing half-spoken parts tickle the right part of my brain. This song has everything. I'm not even a girl and unironically this feels like girlbossing (joke). I'M SO CONFIDENT I'M SO CONFIDENT

**1998tweety** (10): gay bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Toxic masculinity?? Not from this straight-male-pophead ??

**Alumineous** (10): I dreamt about this song once, so of course I'm giving it a 10.

**bespectacIed** (10): A song that is 90% comprised of hooks, I love it. I love the silliness but the lyrics are still snark as heck. HAWT LIKE A FEEVAH MAKE U A BELIEVAH

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): "Like the boys" but I've never seen a man this iconic.

**CarlieScion** (10): BOPS

**conceptualromance** (10): excuse ????? my ego ?? can’t ????? go incognito ?? every ?? time ?? you see me ?? ???? it’s like winning ?? big in Reno ??

**CreepyMannequin** (10): Absolutely consumed by the knowledge that this song was inspired by Beto O’Rourke.

**Dekubaku** (10): J'adore!

**ggal2020** (10): dare I say her finest song

**hikkaru** (10): i'm not confident at all but i will still bop to this

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was the first Rina song I fell in love with. Love the sound on this and it just makes me feel fabulous

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is so fucking gay whew. When i hear this, i turn into frankie grande i swear.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the beat here is perfection…

**jasannn** (10): This song was made for strutting down runways.

**jaztinax** (10): this song is addicting

**ManofOranges** (10): Didn't like it at first but it did grow on me. I'm still confused as to why anyone would want to be like one of the boys though!

**pat-rickstar** (10): It’s a 10 for "don’t fuck with me, hoe" alone

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's just a flawless pop song. this song is addictive.

**racloves** (10): I kinda want to give this my eleven but I think the song I did give it to just edges it out but like this was a really tough decision

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Ended toxic masculinity and gender roles

**skargardin** (10): a perfect walking song noitstrue

**targetguest** (10): this was the first song that clicked with me on the album and what encouraged me to listen to it another 2/3/4 times to get all the others on board. big reason the album took my number 1 spot for AOTY

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): invented being confident! literally vaporized my insecurity!

**throwaway7650** (10): perfect jogging song

**Uberpigeon** (10): This was the song that got me into Rina. It popped up on youtube and I hated it... but for some reason I kept coming back until it really grew on me and became one of my favourite ever songs. The rap verses are in my head all the time.

**waluigiest** (10): I’ve been obsessed since the day it came out. Perfect glitzy kind of club music

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Dance bop ended male privilege

**zagreux** (10): girlboss gaslight gatekeep

**bulforster** (9.8): The Beto O'Rourke callout never fails to make me giggle.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): When this first released, I definitely noticed the lack of Clarence Clarity, but that didn't stop Rina from making an absolute banger

**urfavgalpal** (9.8): this is actually my most streamed song of 2020 so it should probably get a 10 but I think the thing is that while it’s one of the songs I enjoy the most I actually think there are quite a few songs on this album that are better than it so I’m curving down a little.  I think it’s great though.  Nice little retro feeling song (is this disco?  Ive seen some people say it’s kinda disco but I don’t wanna call everything with a groovy beat disco). The actual funniest thing about this song though is how she saw Beto O’Rourke running for President and was like “why the fuck does he have the confidence to do that when he isn’t qualified at all?” And thus this song was born.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9.6): WE WANT THE PABLLO VITTAR REMIX

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Usually not a fan of these sort of reductive female-empowerment anthems, but the production is so sticky and bouncy that it's just an irresistible bop. Rina constantly just serves up pop songs like these that are so difficult to define in genre - like who is doing this sound? Really? - but are just so universally enjoyable. Also it's really cool that she could dial back her usual operatic singing and have it still be this confident and charismatic.

**liberalitea** (9.5): this song grew on me like a rash. i was meh about it at 1st but came around really quickly. i absolutely love it now

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): this is strutting music

**notarobot3675** (9.4): another bop

**cashewconstellation** (9.2): yass

**Palutzel** (9.2): so good

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): a great club track, I really hope I get to hear it once the clubs open back up

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): This song makes me feel like a bad bitch.

**afs** (9): EXTREMELY catchy house was something I didn't expect after the songs before this, and that's good.

**bbfan132** (9): :velmaserve3:

**celladonn** (9): The postchorus is too good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we LOVE confidence!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I would love to see Rina be on the cover of an elite fashion magazine. She fucking deserves it.

**runaway3212** (9): this is good

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): It’s camp

**Turpamutteri** (9): Teach me French

**juanolsen** (8.8): the lyrics are not my favorite but this song is a certified banger

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): i'm ready to lose everything to this song in the club

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Gender norm-defying anthem

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Rina would have slayed that year at the Met Gala

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The opening "oooooo" has all the glamor of a thousand pearl necklaces on the necks of a thousand rich white ladies

**jman457** (7.9): such a cute club anthem

**IIIHenryIII** (7.8): This song is actually really nice.

=====

Awkward_King: # is this disco

**musical\_pyn** (9): The song is so cool, a little bit more energy would push this to a 10

**Qustomar** (9): Lowkey a basic house song but Rina sells it very well.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): i prefer the remix

**anothertown** (8.5): this song is a little over-simple for the album, but i love how cold the beat is

**salivantsonority** (8.5): Addictive but I don't find it as stand out as some of the other tracks.

**akanewasright** (8): This has grown off me quite a bit, but it still bops

**EnCaine** (8): i was a little disappointed by this one when it came out but it's grown on me a lot

**J\_Toe** (8): I overplayed this when it was new, and it may be a little generic as far as house tracks go, but I still love it.

**KennyEarthman** (8): feels a little empty

**Vultuxe** (8): The post-chorus is so good it almost makes the score all on its own. The rest of the song is alright.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): ; I think I like the remix a tad bit more

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this was cute at first but got really stale over time

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's fine

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): I'm not exactly sure what it is about this but it's just a little bit forgettable. Still good, just feels like something's missing.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Is this disco????? But seriously though, I feel like should like this song more than I do because it checks off a lot of the boxes for a good song but the song’s constituent pieces are just… weak? Like the melody is flat and the production hooks aren’t catchy, there’s a spark of fun (I enjoy the “whooooh!”) but the end result is just so middling. The Pablo Vittar remix is a little better though

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Misandrist queen

**ktajlili** (7): This is also overrated, but at least it's catchy

**nooodisaster** (7): as a boy, I can say she is vastly overestimating how confident I am

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the "whooo" part is so infectious

**TiltControls** (7): like the boys will be boys

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): dont fuck with me ho, take u down like judo

**wavingwolves** (7): where's pabllo in this??? smh

**geraldinewww** (6.5): the music video is better than the song and we've all seen the music video

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): not a bad song AT ALL but it's going to be hard to live up to the previous three

**fairytalehigh** (6): an initial favorite but i grew tired of it. the bassline bops but the lyrics are a little lacking.

**pig-serpent** (6): She's done better songs in this style. The bassline is pretty cool though.

**SupremeShani** (6): A club inspired bop mixed with disco and house influences, this song sounds like something a a basic homosexual like me should adore, but there's something here that just misses the mark for me.

**Vromega** (6): honestly musically nothing is interesting in this song :sob:

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): Lol I feel like such a bad gay but like, this song just did not do it for me; yes the beat is hot, yes the meaning is nice but it just feels like a run of the mill club song and it doesn’t feel like it pushes itself the way every other track on the album does

**nick1372** (5): ok girl I know you’re a gaga stan but of all the gaga-isms you could have copied did it really need to be “repeating the same line except it’s in French”???

**Oberionsynth** (5): beat is catchy but the end goes on too long ngl

# i found the straights

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (0): this song annoys me to no end. it's too repetitive and the production is meh

**vagenda** (0): I don’t know exactly what it is about this song but the whole thing – the melodies, her delivery – just sounds so…lifeless? Uninspired? Like a dead-eyed mannequin version of an upbeat dance song. It doesn’t work for me at all. The lyrics don’t help either, decades-old recycled feminist cliches masquerading as clever commentary, the lowest-hanging fruit possible with no new ideas or unique POV, which Rina shows she can provide on other tracks. The (perfectly good) production would have been better served on a song with shallower goals so the shallow execution could at least match

# ... i dont think it was

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): this is just much weaker than most the rest of SAWAYAMA…the fact this was the lead single was a crime tbh

WHO'S GONNA SAVE YA THIS TIME? You can tell I ain't a musician because I'd never think to make one of my album tracks sound like a live recording for added effect, yet it works *so* well imo. Just as you've had a couple downer, slower paced songs in a row, life is breathed into the album in the form of a crowd chanting and drumming up stadium rock guitars and it feels like a jolt of electricity. And it continues to peak, with each chorus being lowder and more full than the last all heightening up to a glorius final musical climax. This is top tier Rina.

---

# rina rINA RINA RINA **RINA**

**geraldinewww** (11): all her shows sold out and are 10+ hours from me. i'm never gonna be in the crowd chanting her name. who's gonna save me this time

**KennyEarthman** (11): I never skip this when it comes on shuffle cuz it always brings me so much energy, when that high note arrives I feel myself combusting

**notarobot3675** (11): here is my eleven... truly so well deserved. this song makes me feel so powerful!!!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (11): oh hell yeah back to the shredding. And those high notes?? Ended me. I had like 5 or 6 contenders for my 11, and this was the last one. As soon as I listened to it I thought "hmmm dark horse candidate?" and sure enough…

**urfavgalpal** (11): i wasn’t sure what song would get my 11 before I began this rating.  Tbh most of the songs in it could probably get an 11 from me depending on my mood but when I heard the chanting at the beginning the amount of pure joy and excitement I felt made it clear there was no other choice.  This song really has everything that I love about Rina for me.  Lyrics that make me feel, maximalist production, how-the-fuck-is-her-voice-that-good vocals

**1998tweety** (10): i love rock music

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This scares me so much. The power in these lyrics.

**akanewasright** (10): NO ONE! FUCK YOU! ...wait was that question directed at me?

**anothertown** (10): Perfectly counterbalanced against STFU as the two moments of pure escapism and catharsis on the album. STFU’s rage vs this song’s freedom.

**conceptualromance** (10): rock Rina my favorite Rina

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love melodrama and climatic songs so much.

**frogaranaman** (10): that guitar riff in the bridge FUCKS

**hikkaru** (10): BANGERRRR OMFG if this doesn't make day 3 i'm throwing hands

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): almost my 11. There literally is not a single discernible flaw in this, Rina killed this whole thing

**ignitethephoenix** (10): making this a stadium rock song ... iconic, showstopping, legendary etc.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): This song is literally a concert MOMENT waiting to happen. Ughhhh I can’t wait until concerts become safe again and I get to experience Rina (and this songgg) live and in person.

**jsonphile** (10): BANGER

**liberalitea** (10): do i even need to explain? the chants in the beginning get me so hyped.

**musical\_pyn** (10): if I ever see rina live this is absolutely the song I am most excited to hear

**pat-rickstar** (10): This being made to feel live really works, it makes it go that bit harder

**plastichaxan** (10): this always makes me wish to be in that rina concert i may never be able to attend

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song FUCKS.

**poptartchill** (10): I enter another dimension when this song comes on

**pros-and-connors** (10): this song has the perfect level of camp with the production to mimic an cheering arena. I’m obsessed

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This stadium rock style works SO well for Rina, and I ADORE the decision to make this sound like a live recording, it fits the song SO well, and amplifies the energy so much.

**seanderlust** (10): that little "who's gonna save you this time?" gets me every single time

**shesdoingyoga** (10): We don’t talk about this song enough

**shhhneak** (10): I can’t believe more artists haven’t made fake live productions. It combines the energy of a concert with well mixed vocals.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Whenever I hear this I think of the "Holding Out For A Hero" scene in Shrek 2

**Stryxen** (10): me when carly lasts longer in the bonus rate than the main rate

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): god i fucking love this SONG. each and every song here perfectly fits a certain mood and i deeply appreciate the "i tried to help you, but fuck off and good luck finding this elsewhere lol" mood here. she also serves vocals. and talent. like always.

**throwaway7650** (10): rina pulls off arena rock so well

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): She’s a rock chick. She likes to rock out

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this is what speak now sounds like according to some swifties

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The stadium rock sound? The vocals?? The keychange??? Immaculate

**wavingwolves** (10): stadium rock rina is something i never thought i needed and now i just need more of it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Still not sure if I like the arena sounds, but it absolutely rips so who gives a shit. Helps that the interjections improve the song tremendously, like that taunting "who's gonna save you this time?" near the end. And the "woo!" after the bridge is an all-time great "woo!" in music.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; the best song on the album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): I want to hear this in a packed arena, Rina deserves!! Very fun and powerful, reminds me of Xtina’s Fighter with a bit more of a glam metal vibe to it

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.7): makes me feel like i'm singing at a music festival

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I love the whole vibe this song has going on of emulating being performed live.

**pheromenos** (9.5): WHO'S GONNA SAVE U NOW?!?!?!?!

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): love the switch up to more live sounding vocals, it's a really cool choice that I wish was utilized a little more often

**SupremeShani** (9.5): Stadium rock and all related genres usually make me feel a certain way, as they tend to get formulaic and borderline tacky for me, but Rina's pop influence and unabashedly powerhouse vocals here absolutely sell the song for me. When the whole pandemic has settled down, I can't wait to hear her perform this one live.

**artzpop** (9.2): pop punk moment I see you babes

**juanolsen** (9.1): idk what this song is about but it is an absolute banger and i absolutely love it, also rina's vocals really shine here

**afs** (9): The Xtina influence is clear as day here,. If this is performed live, the crowd cheering better be as wild as it is here. Oh, and another sudden key change.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I’ve always said this has ‘building up to fight the final boss’ energy, like ‘who’s gonna save me? Myself, bitch’ and kick some ass.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As a kid who was bullied by a bunch of annoying fuckboi twats, this is the underdog "revenge" (for the lack of a better term since Rina doesn't like revenge) bop that I wish my high school self could listen.

**EnCaine** (9): the answer is rina. she's gonna save me now.

**jaztinax** (9): i love the live stadium vibe, brilliant

**nick1372** (9): ugh

**salivantsonority** (9): Thematically so compelling and sonically out of this world. Can't wait to hear this one live.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Stadium Rock isn't usually me thing, it can often be a bit over the top, but this is so well executed. It's not that this isn't over the top, it absolutely is, but it works so well here and I honestly don't really know why, it's just really fucking good.

**wasian-invasion** (9): this is so extra with the crowd cheering and the key change and I love it

**zagreux** (9): the 'rina! rina! rina!' is so nice to hear aaaah

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): what i wouldn't give to scream along to this in a stadium

**Palutzel** (8.7): rock queen

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Kind of like Love Me 4 Me but feels more committed to the whole rock infusion shtick, and kind of feels a bit more genuine in the self-empowerment thing since it focuses more on herself in a sense? Even if I'm not that big a fan of these songs that try its best to work this kind of heavy-metal in the song, it's still a banger that works in Rina's favour being in this faux-rock-arena crowd that her vocals can eat up hard. A better key-change here than in Paradisin' as well.

=====

Awkward_King: **bbfan132** (8.5): rock banger, this is so 80s

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): I really miss live concerts

**jasannn** (8.5): It's too bad Rina won't be a having stadium tour anytime soon because this song was made for them.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): In my mind she's performing this at a makeshift stadium in a post-apocalyptic city wasteland as wildfires rage behind her and the sky turns red.

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): not sure how i feel about the audience chatter, but when she screams "WHO'S GONNA SAVE YOU THIS TIME?!" 

**camerinian** (8): I mean, fake crowd noise is objectively super corny, and yet at the same time I am desperate to be in the crowd at this fake arena, so maybe I'm the cornball

**ggal2020** (8): the closest I’ve come to a concert in a year

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I kinda like the crazy intense feeling of this one (it reminds me of Power Rangers for some reason) but the verses being so nondescript drags it down a touch

**IIIHenryIII** (8): That's another banger.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): I always forget about this one and then listen to it and think "why did I forget about this song?? It's such a bop"

**Oberionsynth** (8): that key change was unDESERVED

**Uberpigeon** (8): rina! rina! rina! rina!

**jman457** (7.6): The power that this will have when she performs this in a stadium during the Chromatica Ball

**TiltControls** (7.5): who's gonna save this sub when they eliminate chosen family too early

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The chorus is killer, tho I don't think the mixing is perfect on this one.

# need saving

**oscarbrierley1** (8): would be rated even higher if it didnt have the background crowd noise through the whole thing

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Overrated as fuck.

**runaway3212** (7): not terrible

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): disney original movie vibes

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): not my vibe tbh but the key change is sick

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): I LOVE the vocals on this, even though I’m less into this lyrically than some of the other stuff here

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I actually love stadium rock but IDK. Something about this doesn’t click for me. I think it lacks energy that I’d want? I hope she tries more like this, though. A for effort!

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Rock? In my popheads? MODS!

**pig-serpent** (6.5): There's a certain charm to making this song sound like a live performance. It also helps mask the subpar rock production that's been plaguing this whole album because now it feels intentional.

**Qustomar** (6.5): Kinda corny.

**ManofOranges** (5): I wish I knew!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i feel like this tries too hard to do alot of different things but doesn't quite achieve it. fantastic vocals however

**vayyiqra** (5): I like the concept behind this, but Rina doing hair metal just isn't something I can get into. It's not a bad song, but it's so strange.

**Vultuxe** (5): I can fuck with the pop-rock vibes but there are a lot of awkward vocals here that don't hold my attention.

**fadedblue09** (2): Sounds like a parody of nu-metal, which is already a parody genre in itself

The metaphor of equating your relationship with your heritage nation to feeling like a tourist merely stopping into a love hotel for a quick affair is honestly inspired. The idea of feeling like you aren't enough of your culture to be able to sing so intently about it and thus the repetition of "I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo" to indicate her self doubt is awesome. This was actually top 5 quite near the end, it got knocked down in the last few ballots, but still levelled out to a nice 8th which I am more than content with for a deepcut! Especially when it outplaced two other entire albums jksdjkadk

# ✨✨that moviestar glow ✨✨

**Alumineous** (11): Japan is one of the most fetishized countries in the world. Many foreigners come to Japan, treat it like a zoo, and exploit Japanese hospitality to disrespect the culture they obsess over. I think of that jackass Logan Paul, or Ariana's tattoo mistake. Anyway, I played this song over 500 times, and it still blows my mind every time. "Your fascination's my world" is chill-inducing. Rina's career is so young, but I am not afraid to call this her magnum opus right now. It's a masterpiece.

**juanolsen** (11): best song on the bum by far, the social commentary is really clever and i deeply relate to it

**liberalitea** (11): this song was going to get my 11 from the beginning honestly. as someone who's moved around a LOT as a child, i've never really felt i had a cultural identity- despite living in such a culturally rich country. i'm legitimately the only one in my family that can't speak my mother language properly and it hurts. it's a joke between my friends that im a white person trapped in a brown body personality wise but it's something that's always bothered me. i genuinely try to fit in, but it feels like i can't, you know? and when i do i'm made fun of. i don't really feel like i belong anywhere and sometimes it can be a huge mental burden for me. so i really do wanna thank Rina for making this song and making me feel a little less alone. the production on this is great too.

**Oberionsynth** (11): okay this is my SONG. I can't relate to the idea of Japanese culture being used as an aesthetic, but I can definitely relate to the culture side of it. It took me a long time to accept that i was gay and fall in love with the community and culture of it, just for people to start taking it to "normalize" it or for corporations to put a rainbow color on their logo (but only in progressive countries, so like what's the risk). "Your fascination is my world" is one of my favorite lyrics EVER.

**savemeaseat143** (11): Diaspora Feels

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (11): This definitely will not win but this is far and away my favorite song on the album. The lyrics, the emotion, the PRODUCTION (her and Clarence really do make magic together) are all so perfect. The background vocals and layering and melodies are all so perfectly implemented it feels like listening to an angelic pop choir sent from the heavens to bestow this song upon us.

**WeakProduct** (11): Rina at her BEST

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Oh man do I absolutely KNOW this feeling as an Asian person myself, seeing other people cherry picking parts of my culture that they like without really paying attention to the people in the country itself. Not to say it's NECESSARILY wrong, but it just feels strange to have these people pretend they're all into this particular country's culture without really going beyond the surface. What a great metaphor of using the love hotels as a metaphor for this shallow love, too. Also did I mention this is the best instrumental on the whole song? Love the driving synths that kick in in the pre-chorus and how the chorus explodes, that with Rina's usual operatic vocals and the theme make this song just so special to me. "Your fascination's my world" the absolute way she SNAPPED...

**bespectacIed** (10): a love song can't just be a basic love song for rina, it has to be about fetishization. Her mind.

**bookthieving** (10): this is such a specific 1.5-gen immigrant feeling, i didn't even realize i felt like this until i heard this song. how do i, as an immigrant, engage with the culture that i grew up with without participating in the fetishization of that culture as an outsider?

**camerinian** (10): God I just love that this is a perspective we're finally getting in pop and that an otherwise traditional unrequited love song can have so much heartbreaking subtext.

**CarlieScion** (10): ??

**conceptualromance** (10): this shit is in different areas

**cremeebrulee** (10): she made a song about cultural appropriation and it goes the fuck off (this would be my rina 11 tbh!)

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really love the meaning of this song.

**fadedblue09** (10): My personal 11 on this album. I love songs that evoke images of nighttime cityscapes and the message is wholesome and cute, with a pretty mature take on love. I can see this fitting on E•MO•TION perfectly.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): I dont think I have given an album this many high scores but omg this song is so glittery and glitchy and perfect

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i don’t wanna CHECKIN! TOTHE! TOKYO LOVE HOTEL!!!!!!!

**Leixander** (10): TOKY-OOOOOOOOOOO OHHHHHHH

**lolcevan** (10): best song on the album, i know that’s right !

**musical\_pyn** (10): I initially dismissed this song, but it eventually became one of my favorites

**ReallyCreative** (10): this was actually my least favorite track on release but it has grown on me immensely with repeat listens, her power!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Rina never ceases to expand my mind with the intelligence in her metaphors. I interpreted this as a love song for an unavailable woman at first, but it is actually a tribute to her roots, and feeling protective of Japanese culture but an outsider in it at the same time.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The first time the lyrics to this one really hit me I almost broke down at work

**shhhneak** (10): my personal fave on SAWAYAMA. I love that this song calls out appropriation and also grapples with her relationship to Japan.

**skargardin** (10): this is so darn cute

**SupremeShani** (10): While I do love XS as much as everyone else, this song ended up being my favorite off the album. A synthpop ballad isn't the most adventurous sound that Rina explores on this album, but the lyrics hit hard for me with a story exploring the concept of the fetishization and appropriation of her Japanese culture. The songwriting doesn't slow down while dealing with such a heavy topic either, and manages to be equally catchy as it is unique. I don't think it's necessarily wrong when people slap together anime scenes and shots of Japanese cities at night for their album artwork and lofi remixes, but the line "I guess this is just another song about Tokyo" really sticks out to me then.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i will literally never be tired of this song. such an important message and the repeated "toKyYYYYyyYOOOooooOOooOOOooO" is literally so beautiful???? a modern classic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This is essentially a perfect pop song, the verses are absolutely god-tier.

**throwaway7650** (10): the outro "tokyo"s are sooo good. the lyrics too

**Turpamutteri** (10): damn

**vayyiqra** (10): Tokyo "[I] Love [This Song]" Hotel

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.9): the synths are so good

**celladonn** (9.7): Not only is it a bop, but the lyrical theme of cultural identity is so good too

**wavingwolves** (9.7): i love the little details in this sooo much, every time i listen to it its like the first time <3 just like what katy said about virginity on hummingbird heartbeat or whatever

**bbfan132** (9.5): when i first heard that live version of this song from 2019 or so…. UGH, such a good song

**nick1372** (9.5): love this so much!! Incredible concept and Rina really sells it

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): when i hear the phrase "tokyo love hotel" my first thought is of the scene in enter the void where olly alexander is blowing a crowd of dudes in an elevator at a tokyo love hotel. anyway this song is great

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): This is NOT just another song about Tokyo, this is another INCREDIBLE song about Tokyo

=====

Awkward_King: **AHSWeeknd** (9): The penultimate track to the album. After this comes Snakeskin.

**akanewasright** (9): I’ve seen criticism of this song’s lyrics, saying that it’s like pandery or something. And it is well and truly not my place to speak on that, but this is the exact kind of midtempo ballad that makes me melt a little inside

**bigbigbee** (9): I love how this sounds like old-school BoA. This song makes me feel like I’m floating above Tokyo itself, at night, illuminated by the city lights, watching people walk by. I LOVE that.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): In this globalized world we live in, it's inevitable that foreigners are going to appreciate and enjoy another group's culture. That's fine. But what's really concerning is that many people take their "appreciation" of one's culture way too far to the point of fetishizing which is gross. Rina wanted to display her frustration over her Japanese culture being culturally appropriated by Western media. As a Filipino, I feel the same sentiment with Rina as I am very wary of foreigners, especially white people, reacting to my culture's stuff in their YouTube videos. We call this Pinoybaiting because Filipinos, unfortunately, eat this stuff up as we constantly need validation from Westerners (especially white people) that our own culture is worthy of these people. I find it

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Underrated as fuck.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Take me with U, Rina

**pat-rickstar** (9): Something about the vocals are just slightly off, only thing stopping this from being another 10

**TiltControls** (9): I guess this is just another comment about me crying for chosen family

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): sooo dreamy

**waluigiest** (9): I love diaspora art

**welcome2thejam** (9): Grew the most on me over the course of the rate.

**urfavgalpal** (8.9): this is a great example of what makes Rina such a great artist.  She tackles so many different topics, most of which are ones you don’t usually hear in pop music.  There’s a lot of complexity and nuance to this song when you listen to the lyrics and Rina sounds gorgeous as always.  My friend actually did an acapella cover of this song and hearing it fresh like that really made me realize just how much Rina does in this song.  Truly an impressive feat

**jman457** (8.8): A brilliant synthpop jam that stands out in the bottom half of the tracklist

**salivantsonority** (8.8): Super pretty but a bit bored by the chorus. Her vocals are stun though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): underrated track on here

**jasannn** (8.5): You can here the love and hurt in her voice.

**runaway3212** (8.5): corny bop

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I'm amazed that Rina can condense really complex themes about fetishization and commodification of non-white cultures into really catchy, short pop songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): i feel like this song sounds like it belongs in a 2000s chick flick

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): I dont have much to say other than its a fucking banger

**afs** (8): A return to 80s synthpop! And you know my feelings about that. It's not as memorable, though.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): that’s new york

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I guess this is just another song about to get an 8.

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Coming from a Caribbean country, the feeling that people only know your country as some fictionalised, idealized version of what it is instead of appreciating the real culture kind of hurts. Travel destinations don’t exist just for you to live your main character fantasy!

**nooodisaster** (8): Clarence Clarity (the producer) needs to be paid more. I have no idea how much he was paid for this song, but whatever is was, pay this man more.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): what a fun synthy bop. Her voice glides all over it

**ManofOranges** (7): I have had quite a few qualms with hotels in both my past and my present.

# tokyo hate hotel

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): On the lower half of the album for me but still a bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This feels like a One Direction song

**KennyEarthman** (7): giving me chill night drive vibes

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): don't love it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I really enjoy hearing what Rina has to say on this song, especially as someone who has, admittedly, consumed lots of Japanese media and culture without having much in-depth knowledge of its history or contexts

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This isn't bad but it definitely feels like one of the most filler songs on the album.

**frogaranaman** (6): wish the mixing in the chorus was better but it’s a fun cute song

**Vultuxe** (5): Once again ... these songs feel so lifeless, I don't know if it is her vocal delivery or what.

# this is just another song bout kappyko

**kappyko** (0): lyrical concept does not work considered in light of pretty much every other song on the album and its sonically bland as shit

I think this is one of the weaker tracks on UH and it's still this fucking strong, as an opener it packs a hell of a punch, and I'm obsessed with Chloe singing "you must got me fucked up". I remember the video for this dropping with/just before the album and replaying it obsessively, they looked so good.

# im not sure i actually know what the fifth amendment is

**1998tweety** (10): Amazing. I already wrote about the song here for our top 100 songs of 2020 so I'll just link that (it deserved higher though).

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This album has a really strong start and Forgive Me showcases the strengths in the girls' vocal delivery and catchy instrumentals

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way they go off! It’s absolute perfection.

**akanewasright** (10): This song only just now clicked for me. It’s honestly such a perfect vibe

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic intro!!!! Gorgeous song. The delivery is very beyoncé. Like mother like dorters

**brenda\_official** (10): DETONATE THE YASS GRENADE

**Brendon-Urine** (10): It's a perfect song, in any other rate this is probably my 11 (but there are ~5 charli songs in front lolololol). also the music video is so fucking beautiful

**conceptualromance** (10): this shit is in different areas!! This is literally a perfect song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i will be cross referencing the chromatica ii/911 scores to make sure no one is underscoring this

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): the intro is so ethereal and angelic. The song is really great Introduction to the album about becoming an adult even while it’s centered around a soured relationship. Also I love melodrama.

**EnCaine** (10): perfect opener

**endcreditouilles** (10): this transition is fucking heaven. I wish these two tracks were combined into one song on the album. I can never put this album on shuffle bc it feels like a crime to stream one without the other

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yes, this is just hella good esp the bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love the transition from the intro to the song to the song so much. And everything about Forgive Me is just perfection with the build up and harmonies

**iniekcja\_** (10): an absolutely perfect introduction

**jaztinax** (10): queen behavior through and through

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): THOSE VIOLINS, THAT TRANSITION

**musical\_pyn** (10): what an incredible way to start an album

**nootnoot781** (10): what a way to start your album. they both demolished the track

**notarobot3675** (10): my favourite song on this album! ive been obsessed, i mean that bridge alone

**plastichaxan** (10): the transition pushed this from a 9.8 to a 10 for me lol

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): haunting, gorgeous, amazing, talented, never been done before, i cannot deal with the harmonies. the lyrics. the anger. the absolute body covering chills when those strings come in. i do not know what they are saying the whole song but girl i feel your pain! fuck that man!

**ReallyCreative** (10): me when I die and it turns out God is real and he isn't with the whole gay sex thing

**Roxieloxie** (10): im literally obsessed with them

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the intro leading up into the song gives me chills! they brought the drama with this one and I’m here for it

**seanderlust** (10): "I love it because it’s so badass, and it’s taking your power back and not feeling like your self-worth is in the trash" - Chloe about this song, which I fully agree with

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the transition should be talked about more, it was so good

**SupremeShani** (10): I fully came into this rate ready to defend the literal seconds that was Intro, but I'm happy that it was combined with Forgive Me. The vocals and atmosphere here are so hauntingly beautiful, with the production being open and airy while still having each note be perfectly incorporated, which I think just really does a stellar job opening the album.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of my favourite openers ever. the intro is just pure stunning vocals and then forgive me GOES OFF especially the outro omg

**throwaway7650** (10): don't ever ask for permission... ask for forgiveness. iconic. adding the intro pushes forgive me to a 10

**Vultuxe** (10): Forgive Me is an excellently crafted pop song, it should have taken off instead of Do It. The hook and their voices are just enthralling, the production hits just right -- there is not a flaw in this song.

**waluigiest** (10): ask for forgiveness violin frenzy I die instantly

**wavingwolves** (10): LIE-LIE-LIE-LIE-LIE-LIE-LIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!

**xaviersi** (10): honestly best intro and song to set the vibe for the whole album and the intro incorporates my favorite saying

**fenellabeach** (9.7): ethereal and a perfect intro

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Intro > Chromatica II

**juanolsen** (9.6): the transition between this two songs make my buddy throbe

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I don’t know what it is exactly, but there’s something about the verses that just make me think of Beyoncé.

**artzpop** (9.5): this is what plays when you enter the gates of heaven. A place many of you will not be seeing.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Iconic intro. Her voice in that first line, uhhhh. Forgive me for not giving it a 10, but it ends so abruptly that it actually makes me mad.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Intro is gorgeous and transitions so well. Forgive Me slaps especially the outro. LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Their vocals are always stunning but something about their performance on this song specifically I love

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): this gives me disney princess vibes in the best way possible

**zagreux** (9.5): Gosh. The intro mercilessly scalped my wig, and girl, the transition into Forgive ME?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?

**anothertown** (9): You must got me fucked up. You must got me fucked up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Thank you for grouping these two together lol.

**camerinian** (9): the bounce on this is so much fun

**Dekubaku** (9): Love their voice!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A perfect song to open this amazing album. Gosh, their vocals are so heavenly.

**fairytalehigh** (9): The way they sing "Best believe I'll move on to better things" ????

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Tbh this grew off me a bit, but still great, and even better with the intro.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): That. Fucking. Transition. Chloe and Halle’s debut was already a crazy display of raw talent and artistry but they showed from the first 5 minutes of this album that they were A) Not here to play with yall, B) really good at rhythmic humming, C) They can CUSS now yall. I keep forgetting that they’re like my age so it’s kinda weird running into an album that’s basically hitting the same notes of growth/experiences that I’m also going through? Full admission, this album will get an insanely high average from me primarily because of that.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**KennyEarthman** (9): me after using my dad's credit card to buy robux: Don't ever ask for permission, ask for forgiveness

**liberalitea** (9): this is such a smooth, incredible transition. i LOVE CxH vocals and literally just their "ooh-ing" in the intro took me placed

**ManofOranges** (9): Very beautiful intro and very beautiful song.

**Oberionsynth** (9): this song is amazing but i just wanna admit that i've thought these girls were twins for as long as i've known about them (2015 ._.)

**Palutzel** (9): it slaps

**poptartchill** (9): such a good transition and I love the production

**pros-and-connors** (9): never has someone saying you got me fucked up sounded more beautiful

**Uberpigeon** (9): Halles high register in the chorus and Chloes delivery in the verses are such a good match, a great track. And the video is really cool.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): “So forgive me, no not really!” UGH this song just hits all the right spots for me! Just think it’s missing one more chorus...

**welcome2thejam** (9): Helluva first track and tone setter. That opening drop kills.

=====

Awkward_King: **hakkerj** (8.7): This is the song that made me a fan

**bbfan132** (8.5): this bops, definitely grew on me with time

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): people really talked about chromatica when this album has the best intros in the game huh

**fadedblue09** (8.5): An opening track oozing with attitude.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): If you think about it most of the songs on this album are about exploring sinful acts (murder, adultery, sloth, hedonism, etc.) from more playful/sympathetic perspectives so it makes sense that the album would begin with a plea for forgiveness. It’s not necessarily my favorite song musically but it more makes up for it in tone and intention

**jasannn** (8.5): This transition deserves Chromatica II hype and much more.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): no other comment other than they sound lovely

**afs** (8): Beautiful harmonising to start us off, followed by the sort of R&B I was expecting to hear.

**cashewconstellation** (8): very good!

**frogaranaman** (8): absolutely great way to set the mood for this album

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): Opening an album by saying "forgive me" is honestly pretty funny. I don't know what they did....but I forgive them

**nooodisaster** (8): The intro slides perfectly into Forgive Me, which is a great mood setter.

**SmileAndTears** (8): something something chromatica

**targetguest** (8): a perfect introduction

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): A great opener and I loooove me a barely noticeable transition. It really sets the tone for the rest of the record

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): extra half point bc i watched it with the video, which is SUCH a serve

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the "all your life" part is so damn good

**racloves** (7.5): their voices are literally heavenly

**pig-serpent** (7): Apparently trap and R&B work together pretty well.

# you must got yourself fucked up 

**runaway3212** (8.5): intro is a 10 but the rest gets worse

**jman457** (7.9): I really like it, even if it kind of gets annoying

**urfavgalpal** (7): I think this is good intro to the album but I think compared to the rest of the songs it’s a little more forgettable

**Alumineous** (6): What? This is going against This Love Isn't Crazy and Dynasty. Chloe x Halle, this is just average. 6 because vocals.

**salivantsonority** (6): Completely forgot this song exists. That says a lot.

# that's a lot of emotion for "Intro"

**welcometoNY** (5): i love forgive me but the intro is so fucking stupid

Bad Friend is one of those songs that feels equally like a personal anecdote and like an experience which anybody can relate to, and I think that's a testament to Rina's lyricism. The touching re-telling of how Rina lost contact with someone who was once her closest friends, not through any dramatic event, but simply the passing of life, is something I don't know I've ever heard be sung about before? Platonic friendships aren't the topic of many songs, especially in this way, so this is nice. While, as you can probably tell from my score, it isn't my favourite, I still definitely understand why other people love it and can appreciate it for that.

# summer of 2020, singing our hearts out to rina

**astrologicalangel** (11): fuck

**bespectacIed** (11): I love this song. Heck, I *lived\* this song. Well not literally; I never ran through the Tokyo streets at night and got drank and sang Carly at a karaoke with my friends. But I felt in my bones what Rina wanted to evoke in this song: perfectly capturing the tiniest details of pure bliss after they're long gone. The pandemic made me reminisce on all the relationships I lost from self-isolation, depression, growing up and moving on, etc... Bad Friend soundtracked the most self-introspective year of my life (all our lives). I've accepted this won't win but 11 is not enough for this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Media hardly ever makes me cry, especially music. I've listened stone-faced to songs about far more serious/depressing topics than this, but Bad Friend is just so viscerally relatable. There are so many songs about romanic breakups - they crowd up the Hot 100, but the ending of friendships whether slowly/passively or suddenly is something we've all experienced more frequently but is rarely represented in music. And like relationships, friendships usually end for a reason. Bad Friend pierces me so much because it puts to words all my fears that I'm not connecting/reconnecting with people because of my own insecurities, anxieties, and self-induced isolation. That I'm the reason.

**pat-rickstar** (11): These comments are going to be full of people saying how much they relate to this, but it's true! It's refreshing to hear a song about a friendship breakup for once rather than a romantic one, and when it's as good as this, I have to give it my 11

**sirpancakeXI** (11): having a fall out with my best friends are always my biggest fear, now that we have finally graduated and will be going our separate way in university, i was worried that i will actually become the bad friend and said something that might hurt their feeling and slowly drift away because i have unfortunately done it before. i feel like this beautiful song really represented this kind of fear in me and i hope that i can gradually change myself and be a better friend to others.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Read somewhere that the chorus was meant to evoke a roller coaster. And yeah, that first chorus absolutely feels like when you're cresting the top of a hill, feeling weightless, floating out of your seat, and time just slows. It leaves me a bit breathless every time I hear it. And as someone who's lost track of friendgroups by being a Bad Friend, holy shit does this hit. A song that's climbing up fast on my Top Songs that Will Fuck Me Up Every Time I Listen to It list.

**1998tweety** (10): smasha

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A shining crown jewel in the tracklisting, like holy shit the LYRICS are so direct, it just hits where it hurts the most. How often have you just have had friendships in the past where you felt like the world were you two's oyster, and then with no true catalyst, everything just dissipates in a whimper, and you just find yourself thinking: was it your fault? How are they doing now, would they still even fucking remember your name? Rina puts all these emotions out on the table for you, over an instrumental that is doused in a gasoline of nostalgia, heavy with melodrama.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don’t get why people don’t like this. It’s so gut wrenchingly beautiful.

**Alumineous** (10): In 2018, I became friends with this awesome lesbian woman from my university LGBTQ+ club. One night, we went bar hopping together, which ended with drunk karaoke. Eventually, we just... stopped talking. I was an undergrad, she was a masters student, it was bound to happen. Last summer, I made one visit to her Facebook profile just to see how she was doing. She has a girlfriend now. Got her masters. Has a fantastic engineering job. She sent me a message on FB 32 weeks ago. It said, "Hey! I hope you're doing all right!" And I kept it unread. Yup. I'm the bad friend.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): i'm a sucker for a choir moment

**bookthieving** (10): when this song outlasts carly's entire album

**camerinian** (10): Hands waaaaaaay the fuck up. Apologies to all of the group chats and Discord channels that I disappear from for weeks at a time.

**cashewconstellation** (10): i ALMOST gave this song my eleven, i've had so many nervous breakdowns to it, it's amazing

**conceptualromance** (10): yeah ??

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Oh God, this is like my huge fear as someone who is a huge extrovert who wants to be friends with literally everybody. There are a couple of close friends that I don't want to lose my connection with and this song literally tackles my fear of losing a close friend because we are on different pathways in our lives. I still want my close friends to somehow be part of my life despite the changing nature. The thought of not being able to talk to them just really scares me all the time. Thank you so much Rina for this song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I hate myself.

**engifear** (10): I've lost many friendships because I stopped putting in the effort, usually due to depression and anxiety. It hurts to fall out with someone and know it's your fault. I don't think I had a close friend last more than 2 years, except for my partner.

**fadedblue09** (10): Among the Rina frontrunners, this is my favorite. It captures a very emotionally complex subject matter and showcases one of Rina's more intimate performances.

**fairytalehigh** (10): the circumstances of 2020 gave me a lot of time to contemplate all the friends i've lost touch with, and all the friends i miss. this song evokes all that in such a touching, empathetic way.

**ggal2020** (10): sometimes I feel like I’ve been this bad friend more than I’ve been a good friend, and there’s not enough songs about the pain of losing a friend (especially when it’s your fault) which for me is harder than losing a lover. break ups happen all the time, but friends are supposed to be forever.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Hopefully by the time this rate is revealed I’ll have texted back my best friend from high school that I’ve been ghosting for five years despite her consistently reaching back out to me! Wish me luck!

**hunnybee12** (10): such a special song, we really need more songs about friendships over romantic relationships

**jman457** (10): The lyrics hit a little too close to home, but it's still amazing

**juanolsen** (10): one of the best songs of the year, i am a firm believer that loosing a friend hurts more than loosing a lover and this song hits really close home

**liberalitea** (10): well this mentions Carly so it's already above average, but the song honestly is just THAT good, and so relatable for me. especially during quarantine when i've felt really isolated and that i'm losing friends which has brought me down a lot. it's really nice escapism and i wish topics like this were discussed more in pop.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song could have easily been my 11, I absolutely love everything about it

**nooodisaster** (10): PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU'RE NO GOOD AT THIS STUFF

**notarobot3675** (10): this song just gets me so emotional

**plastichaxan** (10): me singing/screaming/crying this everytime i hear it it's true

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): oh no ok so this song also makes me cry every time i hear it because it's directly calling out all of my bad behaviors. but it is also a reminder that i can't be too hard on myself and that i have to have some level of grace for the people that i love, including myself! i also love the layered vocals with the music cut out. so pretty!

**pros-and-connors** (10): this song is a punch to the proverbial gut every time. Also the video is ART!

**ReallyCreative** (10): I'm in this picture and I don't like it.

Awkward_King: **rickikardashian** (10): i would give this my 11 but i replied to some texts today and dont relate to it as much right now

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This one cuts deep. I love to hear friendships sung about with the same passion and regret as romantic relationships, because they are just as significant.

**shhhneak** (10): it’s cliche to say but it’s super relatable. A social anxiety anthem.

**SmileAndTears** (10): Oh bitch. We need more songs about friendship cuz this is too good.

**steelstepladder** (10): OMG she mentioned Carly!!!

**Stryxen** (10): me when i'm not good at this stuff: \o/

**Tedyonce** (10): ??

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): a literal personal attack ft a gospel choir

**TiltControls** (10): reminisce about old friendships? basically an auto 11 contender in my book

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): incredibly relatable and unique subject matter for a song. the bridge is just awesome

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Boy Rina is kinda hot next question

**vayyiqra** (10): :pensive: Feeling guilty now; going to message my best friend who I'm seeing Rina with next year.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This is honestly the biggest hidden gem out of all 4 albums in this rate… if you can relate to this song (which I’m sure you can) it really hits you in the gut...

**wavingwolves** (10): when i listen to this and remember it's been months since i had a real conversations with most of my friends because i'm so unable to connect with people around me for reasons that i actually can't really analyse in fear of it being too much for me to handle rn <3 um anyways... rina looks SOOO hot in this MV!

**zagreux** (10): this is such a relatable song because I'll always make friends with people and then sabotage it just because i can :(

**savemeaseat143** (9.7): more friendship songs please

**anothertown** (9.5): The vulnerability that she showed

**Itsafudgingstick** (9.5): We need more songs about friendship breakups (plugging “Bad Blood” by fellow Brit, NAO, here)

**seanderlust** (9.5): i relate to this so hard

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I just wish the bridge had a bit more oomph to it

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): I'm sure we've all been bad friends at some point and left people behind which we later regret and that's why this works so well, it's just really relatable.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): relatable. I had to “break up” with a friend last year because the friendship was just too emotionally taxing and it was fucking devastating.

**amiriteor** (9): girl yeah...girl....yeah

**Brendon-Urine** (9): I love songs that have layered vocal sections with minimal instrumentation like this song, I can't describe it specifically but this song has it and Stay (Zedd/Alessia Cara) does too.

**CarlieScion** (9): mood

**cremeebrulee** (9): logic voice: who can relate WOO

**jasannn** (9): Friendships are hard to maintain. :c

**jsonphile** (9): okay rina you didn’t need to call me out like this why did you have to make this too relatable

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): This song is so beautiful - I feel like it would have been beautiful in a more stripped down arrangement like Chosen Family got, but this is still gorgeous

**Qustomar** (9): The fact I relate to this song makes me feel guilty while listening to it :S

**salivantsonority** (9): So earnest and her vocals are absolutely gorg.

**throwaway7650** (9): love the lyrics and the carly shoutout (we want a collab!)

**Turpamutteri** (9): we need more songs about friendships

**waluigiest** (9): this sweet song about a Carly Rae Jepsen karaoke anecdote is going to score higher than any song on Carly’s album oof

**akanewasright** (8.8): I feel like there’s a pretty vocal subsection of Sawayama fans that have this as their favorite song, and... well, I feel very bad for them, because popheads is definitely going to tank this for balladphobia

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): she really decided to personally attack me here huh

**vagenda** (8.7): Not Rina giving more respect to Carly in this song than I know the sub is gonna give her in this rate

**bbfan132** (8.5): i can relate to this too hard

**poptartchill** (8.5): Carly snuck her way to Rina's part of the rate

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I've never gotten the hype for this song as one of the best on Sawayama, it's good, but it's definitely in the lower tier of Sawayama for me. The verses just feel really underwhelming.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): At first I thought "ew a boring ballad" then I was like "oh no, she's just singing about my insecurities and I don't like it. But it's good."

**frogaranaman** (8): felt

**hikkaru** (8): a tad overrated imo but it's still good

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): I unfortunately overplayed this song for myself but god if this isn’t so so relatable

**jaztinax** (8): for some reason i always mix this song and chosen family in my head, although this is the superior one of the two

**just\_thonking** (8): I like it but I don't get why people view it as a standout from the album? Like it's good, but pretty average by the album's standards imho

**ManofOranges** (8): Sad :(

**nick1372** (8): Speak for yourself Rina I’m an incredible friend but go off I guess

**Oberionsynth** (8): imagine being the staff member that had to throw out some naked girls in a karaoke bar like

**racloves** (8): bonus point for Carly mention. I mean I also relate to being a bad friend tbh

**Uberpigeon** (8): this has a really great buildup

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Is she referencing Call Me Maybe? I'm Automatically In Love if she is doing so.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): cute song. The choir is a really nice touch

# i've got bad, i've got bad, i've got bad taste

**wasian-invasion** (8): I feel like this topic of friendship is so rare in music, just not a big fan of the vocoder (Also is that a call me maybe reference??)

**SupremeShani** (7.5): You have no idea how much I appreciate that the song takes the perspective of a bad friend that knows they messed up, and makes no excuses on their end, but the production here just falls flat for me. Please check out the End of the World remix.

**afs** (7): Eh... this doesn't have the same appeal as the others. I'm not sure why.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe it’s because (humble brag) i’m a good friend but this never really clicked with me. It’s super personal, so once it does, I imagine I’ll like this much more.

**EnCaine** (7): i think about how pitchfork picked bad friend out of all of these songs to put on their year-end list more often than i should

**urfavgalpal** (6.6): I’m ranking this low, perhaps controversially so, because to be honest I can’t listen to this song very often.  It’s a really gorgeous song and I think Rina’s songwriting really shines here, but it’s just too much for me.  Whenever I listen to this I think of a specific person and I get in my emotions and it messes with me for a bit.  I know that’s great song

**pig-serpent** (6.5): I'm a sucker for robot harmonies. Verses are very boring though.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): interesting topic for a song but it unfortunately doesn't appeal to my ears that much

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i’ll be honest, idk why people love this but drag Chosen Family

**KennyEarthman** (5): the topic is so relatable - I wish the song wasn't so meh

**Vultuxe** (5): Just like the last song, felt like one of those barebone pop songs that any pop girlie could replicate.

# thats my husband right there

**runaway3212** (3): this is bad

I don't know quite how to put it because I'm not particularly musically minded, but this feels much sonically darker than anything on the original edition of UH, like it sounds like it would have like purple cloud effects around it if it were in a video game to suggest it had been poisoned? Does that make sense? Anyway, while this isn't really my favourite, I'm not too keen on that darker sounding vibe here, nor is the drum and bass outro really for me, I'm happy this made it as far as it did, even if it was always a kind of distant second place!

---

# daisybop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is an insane experience. They were holding onto this excellence for too long. Chloe’s production is beyond.

**akanewasright** (10): MASSIVE bop

**engifear** (10): The DnB moment is just chefs kiss

**fairytalehigh** (10): that monster chorus, the harmonies, that DnB breakdown at the end, oh my ??

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I need a music video for this where they’re witches, I’m a good person I deserve that and so do you

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song is so intoxicating the girls kill this

**KennyEarthman** (10): has a horror movie ambience

**liberalitea** (10): one of their best songs me thinks

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): this sounds like Ungodly Hour's evil sexy twin, soo excited for CxH3.Also, it should have been in the main rate

**musical\_pyn** (10): if this was in the main rate it would get my 11

**Oberionsynth** (10): this song makes me feel like such a hoe even though i'm a whole virgin

**oscarbrierley1** (10): I listened to this high recently and it really hit different

**plastichaxan** (10): god this was just the perfect addition to ungodly hour, this should actually be in the album, that outro is just amazing

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i mean it's just one of the best songs i've heard in recent history but that is no big deal

**runaway3212** (10): immaculate

**SideBTrack8** (10): I wish this was in the main rate, it would have been such an easy 11

**SupremeShani** (10): this is strangely specific but half of their songs feels like they're about to murder me but like in a slow and sexy way

**throwaway7650** (10): would be top 3 on the album if this was included in the main rate

**TiltControls** (10): spooky, but like, in a good way

**waluigiest** (10): an 11 contender if it were in the main rate. It’s got this blend of warm and dark sounds that works really well, and the lyrics are gorgeous like the rest of the album. The frantic, sexy bridge just elevates it that much more

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I love this. It’s so ominous and strong. I wish it were on the main CD, it would be in my top 4 songs there.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This should be on the album. What were they thinking? It's such a banger.

**Leixander** (9.5): should've been on the main rate! :(

**poptartchill** (9.5): SO GOOD!!! I get why it's a bonus track but it's one of my favorites! The outro is amazing

**wavingwolves** (9.4): ugh this is everything and that outro is everything and a bit more

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): The bridge is REALLY pretty here, if a little too short

**wasian-invasion** (9): ooh what a sensual song

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I see why this was a bonus track but it's still great

**EnCaine** (8.7): something about the lyric "smell my daisies" bothers me too much to rate this as high as i wanted to lmao really good song tho

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Omg why did CxH scrap this song from the original tracklist? This is so good omg.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): The drum n bass moment, this is their Sine From Above

**Palutzel** (8.3): those deluxe songs might be better than most of the non deluxe

**jasannn** (8.2): My witch anthem

**afs** (8): Kinda slow and has some sort of a... Halloween vibe? Also didn't expect it to switch around like that at the end. In a good way.

**Alumineous** (8): Chloe using her lower part of her mezzo-soprano is just so seductive.

**iniekcja\_** (8): this is mixed weirdly but the dnb outro was cute

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This feels like something somewhere between circus music and something I would be murdered to

**urfavgalpal** (8): I honestly haven’t listened to this song enough times to figure out how I feel about it.  It’s so weird and kinda scary but hey music is supposed to make you feel something

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): I mean its deluxe track for a reason

**bbfan132** (7): the production sounded nice here, nice outro

**pig-serpent** (7): I like what this song is trying to do, but I think it should've leaned into the wonkiness a bit more than it does.

**seanderlust** (7): i like the line "I know it's in you like knives," but tbh I am glad this wasn't on the standard edition

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): Definitely a bonus track for a reason but it’s not bad by any means

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): what in the halloween… actually I like this. Especially the girls’ creepy low singing!

**shhhneak** (6.5): the tempo of this song is giving Luigi’s Mansion.

# it kinda sends that im on the lowest scores i feel like no particular way about this song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Of the 2 bonus tracks, I know people like this but it's just there for me

**jman457** (6.2): kind of boring

**targetguest** (6): didn't get the feel for this one

**Vultuxe** (6): It's okay, definitely feels like a reject of Ungodly Hour.

**astrologicalangel** (5): lowkey sounds like haunted carousel music

**frogaranaman** (5): not really feeling this one

**amiriteor** (4): what the fuck is this

This is... my most played song on last.fm. By... a considerable amount. This is four of my favourite artists who all evidently injected something fucking insatiably addictive into this remix and god it fucks so hard. Charli does what she does best, elevating the hook to be insanely catchy. Sarah's verse is adorable and I find the little sound effects in the background at the end of the lines a perfect addition, but Rico is in my opinion the star of the song, absolutely killing her verse with no remorse. All laid over what was already a brilliant gecs track. I remember when they played this remix a couple months early at a gig, I replayed that live performance online so many times, and even that didn't take away from how much I looped it when it officially came out. This is an awesome bonus winner, if you can't tell I am very happy.

# 227 plays

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): Literally a perfect collab

**bbfan132** (10): this is the main version of the song

**bespectacIed** (10): excellent remix. rico and sarah devoured

**bigbigbee** (10): Okay so I have to say after a lot of thought, I don’t think that this IMPROVES on the original, if only because the original has Laura’s “I got a little thing for you, I got a little crush or something” bridge. But I LOVE the original and I think this is equally good. Rico’s part is my favorite (which is true for almost anything she’s ever featured on).

**Brendon-Urine** (10): gec

**celladonn** (10): Grateful I can't give 11s to songs in the bonus rate because if I was forced to choose between giving my 11 to this or XS I might actually implode

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Charli, Kero Kero and Rico definitely elevated this track over the original.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Rico ate. Give It's Bugsnax your 10s in VGV.

**EnCaine** (10): everybody here went off but RICO NASTY WENT OFF

**frogaranaman** (10): Charli sounds perfect on this chorus

**geraldinewww** (10): can we PLEASE watch the official lyric video and not the video where dylan and laura hold up pictures on pencils. the pencil one is good but the lyric video is high art

**ggal2020** (10): literally invented music.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Everyone on this kills it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the best thing 100 gecs have done

**iniekcja\_** (10): gecs

**jasannn** (10): This is peak hyperpop right here.

**jman457** (10): literally invented music

**ManofOranges** (10): Actually amazing to me.

**martian\_pet** (10): 100/100 gecs

**nick1372** (10): this song got me into 100 gecs so thanks for that but also it’s incredible in every way. I love how it twists the original around and each participant here has their own take on the concept.

**pat-rickstar** (10): The 11 of the bonus rate

**pig-serpent** (10): Probably the only remix I can think of that feels like it's meant to be a sequel instead of a replacement, and follows the original really well. Charli is great, but like all her best collabs she gets out of the way to let the other performers steal the show, and holy cow why can't anything else Rico Nasty's done be this good! Would be my 11 in the main rate.

**plastichaxan** (10): it’s litrally my banner… i’d be crazy to give it anything less

**racloves** (10): it just slaps idk what to say

**runaway3212** (10): 10 Tree Of Clues rate when

**seanderlust** (10): this song is a gateway drug into 100 gecs fandom

**SupremeShani** (10): still shook on how all three of them just fit so perfectly here, this song actually inspired me to go out and assign my friends special ringtones like it was the 2000s again

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): He could be in danger, and yet, I still would not save him

**waluigiest** (10): this song made me a gecs believer

**wavingwolves** (10): this is gonna win this bonus rate isn't it

**pros-and-connors** (9.5): shit slaps

**urfavgalpal** (9.5): this is a cute little song and I considered giving it a 10 but then I realized that while this is maybe the more *fun* of the remixes I think the original is actually better.  It’s a tad disjointed, and I’m not the biggest fan of the whisper end.  I mean I do like all the parts.  Each of the verses is really good, but I feel like aside from then “hey Charli can you do the chorus again” there isn’t enough interaction for me.  Still a great song though.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): i watched this music video high once and the ending gave me a spook

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Inifnitely better than the original (which was still great, FYI), just because of the 3 fantastic features

**conceptualromance** (9): Rico Nasty is kinda the star of the show here

**liberalitea** (9): this is so weird i love it.

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9): but personally Rico and KKB really shines more than Charli on this

**Palutzel** (8.8): my life is 100 gecs

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): every one of these points is for Rico Nasty holy fucking shit

**fairytalehigh** (8): ringtone (remix) (ft. kero kero bonito & rico nasty) (charli's version) (from the tree of clues)

**jsonphile** (8): okay why is this the Charli xcx song I like the most on this playlist? It should be my least favorite it’s the stupidest and most annoying but it kinda works for me??? I don’t get how I gave HIFN a ~5.5 average but this gets an 8

**musical\_pyn** (8): wait, charli, can you sing the chorus again?

**notarobot3675** (8): this song was really cute but the mv was genuinely a little unsettling

**poptartchill** (8): it's a jam what else can I say

**skargardin** (8): rico ate

**throwaway7650** (7.5): quirky ~ rico's part is the best

**afs** (7): This remix is somehow even more of a trip than the original. It's so bizarre I don't know what score to give.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): I like this remix A LOT but I wish there was a full Laura chorus

**J\_Toe** (7): the only 100 gecs song I would willingly listen to, as it's somewhat tones down.

**Roxieloxie** (7): i think my first exposure to this was when i popped into plug during the hyperpop reveal and i was truly lost (for alot of reasons) but i remember this playing and it working its way into my head like the earworm that it is.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song is honestly the perfect mix of PC and “traditional” pop! And it’s very cute!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): the genre for this song is Fantanocore

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Charli's parts sound kinda fun actually

# well you all fucking lost because it won didnt it

**targetguest** (8): music video is musty and I need like rebecca black on this or something

**welcometoNY** (8): the original goes so much harder i will die on this hill

**astrologicalangel** (7): ngl, I prefer the original

**Vultuxe** (7): I never clicked with this as much as people did, it's certainly an improvement over the original (I have some strong opinions on 100 gecs...) but only so much can be done to a song flawed from the start.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Oh hey, it's the one 100 gecs song I listen to without irony! This remix is fun.

**KennyEarthman** (6): only enjoyed Rico Nasty's part tbh

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Recently I've come to realise I don't actually unironically like 100 gecs.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Gonna be generous with this one because I know my distaste for their music is entirely based on personal taste rather than quality, and Charli’s part is nice enough!

**AHSWeeknd** (5): well

**IIIHenryIII** (5): It's not bad.

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): i take it back, hyperpop is not growing on me.

**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry I am known to be a Gecs anti and I like Charli and Sarah but they barely save this. I don't care for Rico's part either way and I absolutely hate the intro. I tried.

**shhhneak** (1): everybody in this song is doing a different assignment.

I have such vivid memories of playing this on the bus to my friend coming home from school, when it was the first and only song out from SAWAYAMA. I don't really have a lead off from that it's just an oddly specific memory I have related to the song, and it's funny to think of how fucking hard this must have been going off as we sat their together on the seats right next to the driver because all the others were taken. Rina's ability to combine a bubblegum pop hook with absolutely raging nu-metal, all combined in a song about her first hand experience with micro aggressions... whew give this woman her awards

---

# yasssssss

**jsonphile** (11): such a great banger of a song. And the line “have you ever thought about taping your big mouth shut cause I have many times” is so applicable to so many situations. Obviously microaggressions as the song is about but also: Boss being a jerk at work? Ex being annoying? Accidentally watch Tucker Carlson? Come across a tweet from Ted Cruz? This line always works.

**Stryxen** (11): yas me at popheads when this goes out at 5th maybe 6th

**xxipil0ts** (11): This was such a standout track. Despite the album being a mixture of different pop genres, the blend of elements of Nu Metal, Acoustic, and Radio Pop has made this track really stand out.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I hate how much I can relate to this song. I’ve had the slit eyes done to me, comments about my rice consumption(???) and other stuff people thought were just harmless jokes. But if you dare call it out, you are made to look like an oversensititive little bitch. Ugh, it can be so aggravating sometimes.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): SHE SHOULD SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE CULTURE-OBSESSED PEOPLE IN THE BACK.

**akanewasright** (10): I love Rina for her music, but I really respect how much she had to stick to her guns to keep this song on the record. Labels shot her down because of this song, but it was 1000% worth keeping. On top of everything, this song just *fucks*

**Alumineous** (10): Once I realized the song was about racial microaggressions towards group minorities, it immediately became a favourite.

**anothertown** (10): dizzying, electrifying!!

**bbfan132** (10): total banger, i can’t resist bobbing/banging my head whenever i listen to this

**bespectacIed** (10): Yup i listen nu-metal artist Rina Sawayama

**bigbigbee** (10): The contrast between hard and strong and sweet and melodic in this song is delicious.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): "Yes I listen to metal."

**CarlieScion** (10): so true queen

**celladonn** (10): HahahahahahahahahaHAAAAAAAA

**conceptualromance** (10): god, her mind

**cremeebrulee** (10): she made a song about microaggressions and it goes the fuck off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is my first proper introduction to Rina. Before then, I only knew her for Cyber Stockholm Syndrome and Comme Des Garçons and that's it. This song gave me this feeling of nostalgia as it reminded me of the dominance of nu-metal in the early 2000s while giving me some kind of action in its anthem against racist microaggressions that POC have to endure. Rina gave us an angry pop nu-metal bop that POC pop fans have been waiting for and she fucking served.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): LIKE THE FIRST TIME, PLEASE

**EnCaine** (10): listening to this live when it debuted was an EXPERIENCE

**geraldinewww** (10): the fact that she opened her album era with THIS... rina your mind

**hunnybee12** (10): HAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA (in melody)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Everything about this song is perfect, that's all I'm gonna say. Actually, I just have one more thing to ennounce, if you don't give this a ten, I hate to break it to you, but you are very, very likely to have bad taste.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): end racism QUEEN!

**iniekcja\_** (10): a literal cultural reset

**jasannn** (10): The first time I heard this track I thought it was doing too much and my least favorite track by far. It wasn't until I watched the Fantano review of SAWAYAMA that I gave this song another chance. He pointed out that evil laugh that goes into a high note and that remains one of my favorite parts of the album. I never seen a song talk about microagressions and fetishizing that asians get and she executes it perfectly. This song is so angry yet cathartic, and I love it.

**jman457** (10): Sure the music video is amazing, but doing just a pure metal song was an amazing idea. We have no choice but to stan

**KennyEarthman** (10): she can tell me to STFU anytime

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): I'm not usually into rock this "hard", but I will absolutely take the opportunity to alterate screaming and whispering "shut the fuck up"

**Leixander** (10): HAhaHAhaHAhaHAHAHA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**liberalitea** (10): a nu-metal song about the microagressions she's faced in the industry?! YES. the switch up into the chorus (especially the 2nd one) & her laugh are so iconic too.

**ManofOranges** (10): Me to myself when I say something stupid.

**martian\_pet** (10): Dedicated to everyone responsible for this song not making it to last day of reveal if it doesnt make it

**nick1372** (10): we love metal music

**nootnoot781** (10): i want to see olivia lux lipsync to this song. idk why i just know she’d kill it

**notarobot3675** (10): oof it was a toss up between this and who's gonna save you now for the 11 score but... yeah. this song is without flaw.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I love how the guitars just drop away and it becomes a bubblegum pop song in the chorus, and her delivery is just so perfect

**plastichaxan** (10): no but the way i was shook when this was the first single and then watching the video… no one is doing it like her

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): what an absolute monster of a song. and it's something i have felt so hard. there's nothing like being attracted to someone only for their jungle fever to come out.

**racloves** (10): there’s so many people I want to sing this to

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really hope this doesn't get done dirty, it's such a well produced, perfect track, even if it's the heaviest track on the album. I took a while to grow on me at first, I'll admit, but once it clicked, it clicked HARD. The melodic laugh in the middle there is incredibly iconic.

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay now if this wins it will in fact be deserved because i love this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Rina is a fucking queen for directly calling out every-day discrimination, and destroying the expectation that she should be quiet and take it, when it’s the racist who needs to STFU. Unlike XS, this is NOT subtle at all in its nu-metal influence, and I LIVE for it.

**seanderlust** (10): as a former(?) evanescence stan....yes. this is everything.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my job is high pressure and dealing w annoying client so i play this at work more than i'd care to admit

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): imma be honest this didnt click with me first. i was like... no way am i going to casually listen to this ever. i was wrong. i was so so wrong. stfu sweetie i am so sorry. this song is amazing please let the anger in your lives you'll feel better

**throwaway7650** (10): so many iconic moments in this song. the laugh into the note >>>

**TiltControls** (10): we rockheads now

**wasian-invasion** (10): i am a heavy metal lover

**wavingwolves** (10): she spilled when she went HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; the second best song on the album

**Dekubaku** (9.8): I listened to and enjoyed a metal-inspired song.

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): not me speeding down the highway cackling "SHUT THE FUCK UP" at every car that passes me

**urfavgalpal** (9.6): my favorite song to play when I feel annoyed
[/r/popheads/comments/nogneu/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_3_everytime_you/h00hxx7/]

=====

Awkward_King: **Itsafudgingstick** (9.5): Not Rina making me wanna go into a full big hair, headbanging, metal stan. “How come you don’t expect me to get mad when I’m angry?” is something that so many people need to hear. Also that freaking SCREAM during the climax of the song??? She did the damn thing

**poptartchill** (9.5): the laughing part is SO GOOD

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): When she first released this I was actually a bit worried because it was so reminiscent of other artists that play with this sort of sound that I did not particularly want Rina to follow but it works sooooo well in the context of the album

**zagreux** (9.5): The laugh in the chorus gives me so much serotonin aah. Also the music video>>>

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): metal isn't really my thing but when fused with some poppy R+B flavors? oh yes I will be coming back for seconds

**vagenda** (9.3): Outsold XS…but you didn’t hear it from me

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If Rina made nothing but music that sounded like this then I probably wouldn’t be a fan of hers, but this is a nice change of pace and as an Asian person who works retail I’m glad she gave me something to listen to on my break after hearing a white woman call my coworker “Oriental” *again*.

**juanolsen** (9): i love metal rina and how this song is about a subject which I find absolutely relatable

**musical\_pyn** (9): the juxtaposition of the chorus and verses is incredible

**nooodisaster** (9): The production is just SO FUCKING GOOD

**salivantsonority** (9): I don't normally enjoy nu-metal but this was fucking great.

**slimboyfriend** (9): This hook is so dumb lol

**SmileAndTears** (9): I love playing this song when someone says someone homophoobic shit

**waluigiest** (9): okay this has been lit since day 1 she popped the hell off

**rickikardashian** (8.8): i havent spoken since this came out. not even once

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): mood

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the cdc says that girls do, in fact, rock

**Palutzel** (8.5): ugh forgot that it went this hard, works much better in the album context

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): Rina really said “I’m going to make the gays enjoy metal whether they like it or not”

**SupremeShani** (8.5): As someone who is not here for a nu-metal revival, I will make an exception for the likes of Miss Sawayama.

**welcometoNY** (8.5): HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT TAPING YOUR BIG MOUTH SHUT BECAUSE I HAVE MANY TIMES

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Gets old after a few listens

**afs** (8): I thought I wouldn't like this one because it's pure nu metal, but she pulls it off anyway.

**Brendon-Urine** (8): the tonal laughing is A+

**camerinian** (8): Now I don't hate Korn after all

**cashewconstellation** (8): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she made some points

**ggal2020** (8): this song plays in my head anytime a man talks to me

**kappyko** (8): i still think its a total meme song but its really good

**shesdoingyoga** (8): You tell him queen

**shhhneak** (8): she has the range.

**Uberpigeon** (8): "ha ha haha hahaha ha haaAAAAAAAAAA!!!"

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I love how the part where she actually says “STFU” is so much softer compared to the rest of the song lol

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.8): I love nu metal

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): mood

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): I hated this song when I first heard it but every time I listen to it I like it a little more

**runaway3212** (7.5): GTFO's little sister

**lolcevan** (7): yasss i love poppy!

**Oberionsynth** (7): she did it, she ended microagressions

# shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up

**1998tweety** (7): i still dont really like this but it has grown

**pig-serpent** (7): I have nothing against 90s nu metal but I don't think it was necessary to produce this song on a Windows 98 machine.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): It's my lowest score on the album (Tokyo Takeover doesn't count) and you might think that's just because I don't like metal and while that will probably be the case for some people it's definitely not the case for me. In fact I quite like metal, more than the average pophead at least and yet the problem for me is still in the verses. The guitars are fucking amazing but the vocals, well they're not it. I'm not even exactly sure what it is, I think it's a combination of poor mixing and possibly just a clash of styles overall, but it really doesn't work at all for me.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): ok i would write more comments but i guess i’ll stfu if she says so

**artzpop** (6): not my favourite

**frogaranaman** (6): I always found the opening few tracks of this album kind of disjointed but I also haven’t spent much time with this album overall so who knows

**vayyiqra** (6): Mixed feelings to say the least for this song. The chorus is fun and catchy, but the nu-metal parts are unpleasant. (Cathartic though, I'm sure.) Also, the video is pretty funny.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): I like the message but this song just isn’t one I gravitate to, and her vocals get drowned out :(

**J\_Toe** (5): not what i personally like listening to

**Vultuxe** (5): Yeah, I don't think this is in my spectrum of taste. Would be wrong of me to criticize it. Indifferent.

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): This is probably a controversial opinion, this song probably single-handedly stopped SAWAYAMA from being a flawless record. Perhaps my taste is too pedestrian for these heavy, relentless guitar droning that pervades the instrumental. There are nice qualities about this - like Rina's singing (like, yeah, that laugh-singing thing was cool), the chorus is like a ray of light in the clouds. Love the sort of anti-racism messaging too, but I can't really enjoy all that amidst this heavy-metal instrumental, paired with this really downtrodden vocal melody; this track just really sticks out like a sore thumb in the tracklisting.

**fadedblue09** (3): Sorry but I cannot take anything here seriously

# mud this sounds so ominous

**mudkip1** (7): v interested to see where this lands

The ultimate pre-game song (I say as a 17 year old who does not drink), it's so simple and so hype and is brilliant at what it does. This was the perfect lead single and I'm so proud of it charting, even if it deserved more. It was a brilliant start to the era and put eyes on them, which they retained until the album. I don't agree with the critiques of this using 'modern' slang making it weaker or more susceptible to aging, a lot in part because that way of speaking is mostly comprised of AAVE which has since been adapted to the mainstream and it feels... problematic to critique black musicians for using terms like that in their own music. Anyway. It's a bop :D

---

# do it

**conceptualromance** (11): they did it!!!!!!

**J\_Toe** (11): this is honestly the coolest track in the rate and I hope it wins. The whole album reminds me of Destiny's Child, but Do It sounds like Janet. if it was released in 2020.

**Qustomar** (11): This song is so satisfying to listen to, the production, the atmosphere, the vocals, everything is perfect. I love it so much, did a great job at introducing Chloe X Halle to a whole new audience like me!

**skargardin** (11): They SNAPPED!! This is so irresistably catchy and fun. Absolutely love it

**1998tweety** (10): this deserved to blow up wtf

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A whole ass bop, a lovely highlight that again captures their strengths in making trap-influenced alternative R&B bangers.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): The song/video that started it all for me. I remember watching the music video last year and just being blown away.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That Uber on the way

**anothertown** (10): I know Scott Storch is seeing heaven ??

**bbfan132** (10): total bop, should’ve been bigger

**bespectacIed** (10): A MOMENT. My favorite pop moment of 2020 is this song and all the performances around it. They really had the recipe for stardom with this one: amazing visuals, unforgettable performances, and an honest to god awesome pop-R&B song. EXCEPT for the gp support smh. This not being a bigger hit than it was is just proof that life is meaningless and nothing matters

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This charted but it deserved to be a 10 week number one hit. Never trust the general public.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i cant believe they dropped the best pregame anthem in years and this fucking pandemic robbed us of using it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): its ok

**eeveefan01** (10): This song was one of the best songs of 2020. Would have been an 11 if ** wasn’t here.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this track look like bae

**engifear** (10): This string of 3 songs, "Do It," "Tipsy," and "Ungodly Hour," is top-tier

**fadedblue09** (10): A rare song that is club-friendly and soulful at the same time, and such a mood lifter. I prefer the title track more, but this song deserves its success.

**frogaranaman** (10): I do a hard side-eye for anyone that doesn’t dig this song

**hakkerj** (10): Smash hit

**hunnybee12** (10): good vibes only ??

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic! Wish this actually blew up and was a massive hit. Such a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I patiently await to see what sexual references people make with the title

**jaztinax** (10): they know how to pick their singles

**liberalitea** (10): TELL THE DJ PRESS PLAY REWIND KEEP IT ON REPEAT YESSSS MY BUSSY IS BOPPING MHMMM

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): invented quarantine mvs

**ManofOranges** (10): FUCKING BOPPPPPPP. That IS just how we do it girls. YUP YUP YUP. This song goes so hard, the video goes EVEN HARDER, it's LITERALLY so iconic to me. This song for me would get an 11 if XS was not in the rate because it's just so good to me. I believe it's actually one of my most scrobbled songs, which says a lot to me.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this deserved to blow up

**nootnoot781** (10): i’m sure i won’t be the only person doing the choreo whilst listening to this

**Oberionsynth** (10): "girl, we so late" is exactly how i feel when i realize i never listened to this song in the whole YEAR that it's been out

**pat-rickstar** (10): Me when I do it

**plastichaxan** (10): the other girlies don’t do it like them (even after hearing them say “and you can do it too”) :eyeroll:

**racloves** (10): I feel like I have played this song way too many times it’s concerning

**RandomHypnotica** (10): literally just the 100 emoji in song form

**runaway3212** (10): a whole bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is such a refreshing partying song for being so laidback and carefree, truly turning the club into an oasis of chill (if we had clubs rn)

**savemeaseat143** (10): instant classic

**seanderlust** (10): i love the vibe of this

**shesdoingyoga** (10): We as a society failed by not letting this get to #1 on the charts

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I can't believe i listened to the remix version first than this, this is so much better.

**SupremeShani** (10): This is the literal definition of a bop, I know that term is so overused at this point, but this song deserved to smash so much. The twin's harmonizing here is so mesmerizing, the hooks are catchy, the way they blend their pop and R&B influences here into something so sultry and danceable, someone make this blow up on TikTok again or something.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly i wasn't feeling this song when it first came out and almost didn't listen to the album but thank u popheads for making me listen anyway bc now it's one of my fave albums. any i disgress, song was a massive grower and a chill bop.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this song is so fucking good god where is that video of her throwing her ass in a circle to it when you need it

**TiltControls** (10): thinking of giving this a 10? do it

**Uberpigeon** (10): This gets a ten because of the amount of times in my day that "I beat my face, Moving fast cause the uber on the way" pops into my head

**urfavgalpal** (10): I love this one it’s so good.  And I love how it’s a hype song for Chloe and Halle that manages to include the listener with the “and you can do it too” so you feel like omg I could totally hang with them even though you know they’re cooler than you

**wasian-invasion** (10): this feels like it shouldve been a massive tiktok hit

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Deserved the grammy

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): This is the Truth hurts to my Juice, the make me feel to my screwed. Is this a good song, yes, but its not the best one on the album and it pains me everytime i only see people talk about this song. It also pains me because for some reason this is the song where i really need you all to go read up on your biases on AAVE and what it is because the amount of ' i dont like the tReNdY words they use in this, eww good vibes, 100,' like shut up you sound like the people who think the DaBaby version of levitating is 6 points worse than the original

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): CxH have the inate power to make me feel like a bad bitch no matter what I'm doing/what my mental state is

**Dekubaku** (9.5): Doing it so smoothly.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9.5): This is such a fun song and I love Halles voice on this

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): nobody ever dances to this song when I put it on at parties and honestly it is sad

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): while it's a smash, and easy to see why it was the song that took off, it actually isn't close to the best track on this album

**salivantsonority** (9.5): Banger.

**shhhneak** (9.5): IT’s a hit song for a reason.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): One of THE definitive songs from last year. So so SO well-crafted. I just love the vibe it creates and how fun it is

Awkward_King: **celladonn** (9): The prechorus is sooo good

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This song took a while to grow on me. At first, I was actually shocked that this song was picked as a single for the album because there are way stronger songs on the album. But now I can see the public appeal of this song as a single and I am glad this is the song that got people knowing Chloe x Halle. And oh, their live performances of the song are just amazing.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): And that's how you do it.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Can. Not. Wait. To finally get ready and pregame to this song once it becomes safe to go out to bars again.

**jsonphile** (9): oooh ooh oooh oooh

**juanolsen** (9): i love this song, the way it meshes so many different sounds it's great and it's just pure unadulterated fun

**KennyEarthman** (9): I can see why this became a hit

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): The bouncing back and forth on the "ooh"'s and "do it"'s is just so fun

**notarobot3675** (9): we all know this song is iconic

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): VMAS! YOUTUBE! BET AWARDS! ELON MUSK'S BACKYARD! THE BASEMENT BEYONCE GOT SIA IN! OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW, WEARING RED JUMPSUITS!

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The Pre-Chorus is soooo good

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): a classic

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Everything about this song, the beat, the lyrics, the vocals, are all the definition of smooooth

**waluigiest** (9): wish it lasted longer

**welcome2thejam** (9): Know how to keep it cool, ooh, ooh / And that's just how we do it / Yeah, that's just how we do it / And [Rob Schneider voice] you can do it [end Rob Schneider voice] too, ooh, ooh, ooh

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): "Left the heels at home, I'm on my sneaker game" what a 2020 mood

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): This song might have the single best pre-chorus in the whole rate but then the chorus starts and I slightly zone out. Still great tho

**akanewasright** (8.5): a good song, make no mistake, but NOT their best. Not by a longshot

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I always forget how good this song is until like halfway through

**camerinian** (8): I honestly do dig the vibe of this, but real talk this song is gonna age like milk, like basing every second line around zoomer slang is a great way to get some TikTok placements, not so good for longevity

**cashewconstellation** (8): a bop!

**ktajlili** (8): A grower for me

**nooodisaster** (8): If this isn't at least top 3, I don't know what popheads is.

**throwaway7650** (8): this had to grow on me for some reason but I like it now! the outro is kind of weak though, which keeps me from giving this a higher score

**jman457** (7.9): just pure summer, but I feel like I over played it

**pig-serpent** (7): Sexy bassline on this one. The ending is really nice too.

# dont do it

**amiriteor** (8.9): docked a point bc the remix end is better

**Palutzel** (7.8): it's a cute bop, but too soft for my taste

**Vromega** (7.5): Even if I like the chorus, I really find it difficult to get into the mood, the atmosphere of this song, especially with the beginning that I find a bit messy. The different musical elements are not perfectly organised ach other imo

**afs** (7): Smooooooth transition. Rap doesn't do it for me unfortunately.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The things that make this the most successful song on the album are also the things that make it the least interesting: it’s a basic party pop song. The girls have talent in spades so it’s not bad but it’s the kind of song that I’d hear at a party and be like “oh nice this is a vibe” but then never seek out on my own. The harmonies and chords are nice I guess.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): the verses are 100/10 but the chorus could be baked a little more? like yeah that is how we do it but now what ?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): a nice pop song but honestly nowhere near a standout on this album. The visuals are a serve but I’m not sure why this was the single

**nick1372** (5): I never got this song and it really discouraged me from getting into chloe x halle. Which is really disappointing because I do like them after a closer listen to this album

**Vultuxe** (5): Do It is an interesting case, I think that the verses slap like nothing else on this album, but the chorus is a total dud. An unforgivably bad dud. Indifferent.

**izeaklapaucius** (4.5): wow who knew a tiktok bait song is the weakest from the bunch

# https://imgur.com/XvTwOBE

**ggal2020** (7.8): the song slaps but god the lyrics are cringey. it’s like middle schooler snapchat madlibs

**zagreux** (3): This was an 8 till they said "good vibes only"

# to which i have to say

**wavingwolves** (10): i hope i don't catch anyone calling the lyrics of this song ""cringy"" and giving it less points bc of that

It's so haunting and yet oddly so reassuring??? Rina's telling of familial pressures especially from her experiences with her east Asian heritage are beautiful, and they pair so gorgeously with the luscious electric guitars, and Rina's vocals over the top are heavenly. Sorry for just torturing you all in beatsense with that note as well, it hasn't happened as I'm writing this but... I feel a need to apologise already. This was pretty consistently in a battle for 3rd with Do It but ultimately pulled ahead near the end, even with a 0!

# outsold the goose lady mimicking a guitar solo in her linedancing through hell song

**afs** (11): The vocals, the production, the GUITAR SOLO, and more. What an album opener.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (11): second best song of 2020, the guitar solo is the best instrumental i have ever heard, it is a perfect opening track, i could literally write a dissertation on how amazing this song is

**CrimsonROSET** (11): From the first notes, this IS the moment. I love when there’s an obvious opening track and an obvious ending track, but this is so much more than that. This is like an opening letter to Rina herself, presenting the main themes of the album, and how she deals with them sonically. This also fucking kills everytime she perforoms it. I don’t see how she can make a song better than this, but I’m looking forward to being proven wrong.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): Rina is a star and this song is proof

**kirby31200** (11): A perfect opener and all around a perfect song. The way she harmonizes with the guitar solo is just... chef's kiss. Also perfectly sets up the album's theme of the family we choose being more important than the family we have by blood. She's breaking the chains of her oppressive family ties and reclaiming her power with the help of the friends she loves

**lagozzino** (11): the best Ayumi Hamasaki song of the last decade

**poptartchill** (11): This is an amazing opener. I was so hooked the moment I heard it, especially when she's singing along to the guitar solo after the bridge. The lyrics are so interesting too. One of the most 11 worthy songs ever.

**seanderlust** (11): a song about intergenerational pain but making it a banger of the highest quality? YES.

**SmileAndTears** (11): When she harmonizes with the guitar? Are you KIDDING me????

**throwaway7650** (11): "won't you break the chain with me?" I love this song and its lyrics. such an amazing album opener and I hope it makes day 2

**TragicKingdom1** (11): perfectly crafted thesis for the album. fuck you /u/ kappyko

**Uberpigeon** (11): there is no opening track more perfect than Dynasty. Lyrically, its an amazing introduction to the rest of the themes on Sawayama and... god it just sounds so fucking good. Rinas vocals are off the rails in this one, the hard hitting guitar accompanies everything perfectly and the bridge. Oh my god the bridge. Olivia Rodrigo WISHES her bridge was this good.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (11): That bridge...

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): An epic, operatic opening with an electrifying guitar backing, it somehow evokes the ancient, oriental atmosphere Rina was aiming for, and one that she nails with her powerful, evocative singing. I also like that this is the opening track that kind of reaches back into her broken familial ties to question if she will truly carry on her origins, like what a phenomenal track to start the album with.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): Serving us vocaaaals and production. Holy shit, what a way to start off this record.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Sets the mood perfectly.

**akanewasright** (10): One of the best opening tracks of last year. Like... it’s legitimately stunning. This announces Rina’s presence, introduces its themes, and overall just *fucks* sonically.  Plus, it *immediately* shows off how much Rina has grown vocally since her last record.

**Alumineous** (10): Shit, she sung the same notes as the electric guitar! Yo, that's dope as hell! It's so amazing how Rina opened the album to something so cathartic for her. She said she will break the chain, she will be the master of her own destiny.

**anothertown** (10): ,mxn,mxcnv.xc;kvlksdjf;lsfiopvixoksndllksdlsc

**bespectacIed** (10): A song about fucking generational trauma as an opener, who is doing like Rina, seriously? Gorgeous, sprawling, stadium-worthy

**bookthieving** (10): an 11 contender! an absolute banger about the conflict between family and identity, setting up the sonic and lyrical themes of the album

**Brendon-Urine** (10): what an OPENER my gawd

**bulforster** (10): I actually kinda dislike how garbled the backing vocals are in the intro but I can't not give this a 10 after that vocal guitar solo burned away all my generational trauma.

**conceptualromance** (10): The “Maps” inspired intro, the singing along with the guitar solo, the choir...she freaked it, ladies and gentlemen

**CreepyMannequin** (10): This is the only songs that leaves me stunned every time I listen to it.

**Dekubaku** (10): An epic start befitting a legendary album

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really love the guitars and drums and how climatic the song is and how she just opens the album with familial pain and how it’s passed down.

**EnCaine** (10): one of rina's best outros (up there with cyber stockholm syndrome)

**engifear** (10): The arrangement and production on this song is so good. There's so much going on, but it works so well

**fenellabeach** (10): are you kidding

**geraldinewww** (10): the synth organ...

**hikkaru** (10): amazing opener

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song was perfection. Literally every single fucking element… and the guitar?!?!?!

**jayjaysortagay** (10): DYNASTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DYNASTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**jsonphile** (10): what a great album opener. Just reels you in with its raw power

**juanolsen** (10): this is probably the best album opener of 2020, everything about it it's great

**KennyEarthman** (10): that guitar solo is really epic

**liberalitea** (10): this song is so exciting. i love EVERYTHING about this. the bridge, the high notes, the guitar solo. it's so good and a great opener for this album.

**ManofOranges** (10): EXAAAACTLY

**martian\_pet** (10): One of the best intros to an album i've ever heard

**mudkip1** (10): wonderful album opener

**nootnoot781** (10): an album opener for the history books.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): listening to this album last and damn it's nice to hear a guitar. I like how she says hereditary lmao

**Oberionsynth** (10): the first song I ever heard from Rina, and I've been popping my bussy to it ever since

**pat-rickstar** (10): Very big 11 contender, when the bridge hits I ascend

**plastichaxan** (10): i am addicted to watching sawayama reaction videos just to see everyone appreciate how powerful this is as an opener

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): what a way to open an album. that sting of strings underneath, the breathy vocals, just chills. chills all the way through.

**racloves** (10): man I relate I hate my family lmao

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love the gothic vibes going on here, with that really crunchy guitar, the bells and chimes, it's a killer start to the album

**ReallyCreative** (10): WHEN I TELL YOU THIS IS HOW YOU START AN ALBUM HOLY SHIT

**Roxieloxie** (10): Yeah this fucks

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): So grandiose and addictive!! I absolutely love this theme, I often think of how my family has influenced me in ways I don’t even realize, and how parents accidentally transfer hurt to their children despite their best intentions. It’s so necessary to learn from those mistakes instead of making them the new normal. Yes, I will break the chain with you Rina.

=====

Awkward_King: **shesdoingyoga** (10): This is literally one of the best songs to have ever been released ever, it really deserves top 5 but top 10 is passable, anywhere outside of that and there’s really no hope for any of you tasteless losers

**sirpancakeXI** (10): ICONIC INTRO

**skargardin** (10): This is how you do an intro

**slimboyfriend** (10): She goes from Evanescence moodiness to Beyoncé outsinging a guitar solo in two minutes

**SupremeShani** (10): Only Rina can open an album with an Evanescence-like ballad about her struggles of growing up with the expectations from an Asian household in a western world. I know Rina's theater kid energy sometimes turns people off, but I think she utilizes that energy here perfectly, making a song about family trauma that is so manic and cathartic and overwhelming all in the best ways possible.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): no other words to say but brilliant opener, brilliant song, sets the tone of the album beautifully, stunning, etc

**Tedyonce** (10): good lord this song is delicious

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): every time i hear this i literally ascend like my ass is fucking levitating

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Everything about this song is so fucking good and it's even got a sick guitar solo!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): One of my favorite aspects of this album is how she tackles family and identity and this song really shoves those themes down your throat and I LOVE it. It’s really sets the tone and demands your attention

**urfavgalpal** (10): I mean come on.  I knew this would be my album of the year as soon as Rina came in on this song.  I mean what an opener.  Maybe the best album opener of 2020?  She really just comes in and slaps you in the face with this one.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): That bridge is GODLY!

**Vultuxe** (10): A hell of an opener. I'm afraid this album will be beyond my tastes, which is why I've been putting off listening to it in full, but I thoroughly enjoyed this track.

**wavingwolves** (10): the bridge of this is everything... it gives me phantom of the opera and melodic metal and i love it

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.8): the infidelity line.. felt that

**shhhneak** (9.7): the pivot to hard rock and “I’m gonna take the throne this time” hits like a nuclear explosion.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): If this had come out ten years earlier, there would be UNCOUNTABLE Naruto AMVs to this song

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): "i'm a dynasty / the pain in my vein is hereditary" is such a kickass, perfect pop hook + way to kick off the album. "won't you break the chain with me?" fuck yeah girl let's gooo

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): this is THEE album opener

**pheromenos** (9.5): die nasty

**1998tweety** (9): beautiful opener

**astrologicalangel** (9): this has to be one of the best album openers of all time

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): At first listen, the opener didn't give me a strong impression. But looking at the lyrics definitely upgraded my feelings on the entire song. Intergenerational pain and trauma is such a loaded topic especially for POC and I feel the pain here so much. I think collectively that my generation of POC wanted to "break the chain" as in we will not inherit the trauma and pain that we got from our parents so that the future generations don't have to suffer the same pain that we had to endure. This is a great opener overall and I feel so seen with this song.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I used to not care about this song, but it has grown on me. It rocks!

**jasannn** (9): This is how you make an opener.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): Incredible opener to an incredible album

**musical\_pyn** (9): the moment the song opens up on the bridge? yup that's an album opener

**nick1372** (9): this is an incredible album opener! Really defines the thesis of the album in a way that’s rare to see

**notarobot3675** (9): WHAT an album opener other pop girls take notes!

**Stryxen** (9): that’s how you do an INTRO

**Vromega** (9): epic opening. It grew in me even though I usually hate electric guitars used like this

**waluigiest** (9): EXCELLENT intro

**zagreux** (9): THIS is how you open your album

**amiriteor** (8.9): bc of the tiny desk it's better

**savemeaseat143** (8.9): the pain in my veins IS hereditary

**bbfan132** (8.5): such an epic intro!!

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): she made a song about inherited trauma and it goes the fuck off

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): She opened up her album with a song about generational trauma and it slaps!

**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): Finally some good fucking food! Queen of breaking generational curses

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The message of this song is so relatable. Wanting to escape the worst parts of your family and wondering if you'll just become what you feared. Rina puts such a personal touch to this, and the production is just fire and makes it so hype.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): solid way to open an album

**jman457** (8.4): Really a good preview of the Journey we are about to go through

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Not the best song to mention breaking a chain but a dang good one.

**cashewconstellation** (8): WHAT A BOP IMMA IMMA A IMMA IMMA A

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Listening to songs about generational trauma won't actually make me address it, will it...

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Love how grand this sounds, this is a solid opening track

**salivantsonority** (8): Really beautiful and even better live.

**J\_Toe** (7): so epic

# the pain in my veins is because of this song

**wasian-invasion** (8): this loses a point because spotify keeps forcing it on me after an album ends

**camerinian** (7.5): If I was more of an Evanescence kid growing up, I’m sure this would 100% be my shit

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A topnotch vocal performance, but I've always found this overdramatic ngl.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The idea for this song is really neat and it has a great hook, but the guitars aren't produced very well and I feel like the rock verse could be more pumping.

**Qustomar** (7): My dynasty could have made me hotter.

**vayyiqra** (7): I wasn't sure how to feel about this for a while. It's pretty epic-sounding and cinematic. but I have to admit, the switchup from it to XS is jarring. (Still good though.) I know a lot of songs on this album talk about family and Rina's feelings about how she was raised, and I respect that. So for this and a lot of other songs, I bumped up their scores a bit because I thought the lyrics were well-written and had something original to say.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): lowkey i always skip this

**runaway3212** (4): this doesn't really pack the punch it think it does

**sssaaage** (0): i genuinely dont get the hype for this song.... like compared to the rest of this album and even the rest of the songs in this rate theres literally nothing about it thats appealing to me.. i remember listening to this the night sawayama dropped without hearing any of the singles beforehand and being worried for the rest of the album ??

# ffs

**frogaranaman** (6): A dynasty (UK: /'d?n?sti/, US: /'da?n?sti/) is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system, but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. Alternative terms for "dynasty" may include "house", "family" and "clan", among others. The longest-surviving dynasty in the world is the Imperial House of Japan, otherwise known as the Yamato dynasty, whose reign is traditionally dated to 660 BC. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a "noble house", which may be styled as "imperial", "royal", "princely", "ducal", "comital", "baronial" etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many nations and civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt (3100–30 BC) and Imperial China (221 BC–AD 1912), using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term "dynasty" may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned, and also to describe events, trends and artifacts of that period (e.g., "a Ming-dynasty vase"). The word "dynasty" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (e.g., "a Ming vase").

Don't get me wrong, I adore XS, I mean it got my 11, but this winning would have been such a lovely surprise. I honestly don't have a whole lot to say about it, melodically it's so pretty, honestly as a package it's just so *pretty*, like it **sounds** pretty as a song, that's so impressive. I love all the layers in the song, all the instruments layered on top of one another, and I love how spacey Halle sounds in the bridge, that's a highlight for me. Overall this would've been a lovely winner, but it'll make a great winner of AS5 too so whatever :)

# honestly the real g's for 11'ing this

**1998tweety** (11): oh my lorde this song is gorgeous, im floating

**AHSWeeknd** (11): This is one of the greatest songs ever created. Mozart whom!??

**akanewasright** (11): This song deserves to win. It is the best song on the album, a song where both girls get to show off their vocal ability, and just groovy and perfect in general. I love Rina, but XS does not deserve over this.

**bookthieving** (11): the production is stunning here, perfectly setting the moody, mysterious late-night vibe while still letting cxh's gorgeous vocals shine through. and the songwriting is lovely, a fresh take on the "loving yourself before loving someone else" theme that matches the poeticism of the title.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Please let this beat XS...

**endcreditouilles** (11): not being able to give multiple 11s in this rate is a war crime, CxH just don't fucking miss. When u decide u like urself and appreciate Ungodly Hour for the masterpiece it is, holla at me.

**engifear** (11): That "Won't you love me?" as the bridge is ending and that final chorus (and let's be real, the entire song) is just heavenly

**fadedblue09** (11): One of my favorite discoveries last year, and fully convinced me to see the talent of these girls. Very slick and hypnotizing, and a magnificent display of their vocals.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This song is just a work of art that I don’t even really know what to say about it; it’s perfect, which is actually something I could talk about a little bit I guess. When this album came out people were *buzzing* about it on popheads and at first I wrote it off because I thought Chloe X Halle were “too perfect” for me but then I stopped and thought about it and I was like wait… is that racist? Because that’s the same shit that people say about Beyoncé. It’s like, we demand that these women be “relatable” and feel “accessible” to us but then pounce on them for doing anything “messy,” but then when they push past all of this and focus solely on their craft they get labelled as stuck up or as robots. And I almost missed out on one of the best albums of the decade (it’s totally not too early for me to say that) because of my prejudices. Idk maybe it’s just me but think about how you interact with black artists is what I’m trying to say I guess. Anyways, this song is a stunning blend of pop/r&b/dance with a bridge that could span the Atlantic, long live Chloe X Halle and may your every hour be ungodly.

**Itsafudgingstick** (11): So this is my ultimate fave song of 2020 actually. There are a select few songs that just latch on to me instantly but the dreamy, atmospheric vibes of the title track pulled me in right away. It’s just such a lush, gorgeous track and I don’t think I will ever tire of it.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): this production is so perfect and I don’t even really have that much to say about this song but its just so good

**jayjaysortagay** (11): nothing in this already amazing rate can match the ethereal quality of this song

**mudkip1** (11): literally the best song ever made point blank period

**oscarbrierley1** (11): the vocals, the production, its amazing

**racloves** (11): this song is just a masterpiece

**rosecoloreds** (11): if covid wasn't a thing i'd be throwing it back to this song in a gay club but im forced to do this in my room

**sssaaage** (11): r&b and house are like my two fav genres so ofc i love this.. we need more like this (stream play with the changes by rochelle jordan btw)

**SupremeShani** (11): Absolute perfection, the combination of Chloe and Halle's soft, concise harmonies and Disclosure's signature production just creates a song that is so impossibly ethereal, spacey, electric, and groovy all at the same time. I could really gush about this song for hours, the production's synths here are so minimal but precise here, and just lets the girls angelic vocals swirl all around in what is hopefully the winner of this rate.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): this song is pure brilliance. the harmonies, THE BRIDGE, the topic, the production. it feels like i'm listening to liquid gold

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): this song really has it all- excellent harmonies, a good beat, a catchy hook, interesting song structure, pointed lyrics... i could go on

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): To me, this song is absolute Pop Perfection. Every sound is right, every melody is sung in the right way, and the icing on the cake is Halle’s harmonious yet haunting “Love Me”s floating through the bridge, each one like a lost soul forever searching for romance

**wavingwolves** (11): in a perfect world this would be the #1 song </3

# if i decided i liked myself i would holler at all these people

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This rate has like 3 songs that I wanted to give an 11 to; this is one of them. Disclosure in extraordinary form in making a sensual, glimmering instrumental that CxH freaking nail, not hard to see why this song's name carried to the album.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): the chorus in this.. and the bridge.. and the verses.. and the outro.. Wowza.

**afs** (10): Ooooh this is slick. Love the nostalgic production on this one, and their vocals are especially heavenly here.

**Alumineous** (10): This is heavily reminiscent of Dire Dire Docks from Super Mario 64.

**bespectacIed** (10): [I did the writeup on this song for popheads top 100 songs of 2020] (https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kyrcji/the_top_100_tracks_of_2020_according_to_rpopheads/gjjlcdi?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) and it was honestly the only time i used brainpower during the entire 2020

**bigbigbee** (10): This song is really something special. A sit-up-in-your-chair song. A scramble-to-open-Shazam song. A download-on-first-listen song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): One of two runners up for my eleven. This is easily the best dance pop song in this rate.

**camerinian** (10): mostly I'm just mad that Disclosure's RnB collabs don't all sound like this. Where was this sort of gold on Caracal huh???

**CarlieScion** (10): a winner mayhaps [2]

**celladonn** (10): The production, the vocals, the vibes... immaculate

**cremeebrulee** (10): if this is somehow 1 point off from beating XS please @ me for not 11ing this but otherwise i hope this gets to be runners up!!! this song literally blows me away every time i listen to it. its gorgeous in every way and it makes me so excited to see where cxh go next.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly, if you give this your 11, no matter where it ends up you get the moral victory. Good on you.

**Dekubaku** (10): So tempted to give this an 11. A masterpiece!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love Chloe’s lines in this. I love how the song is about someone needing to work on themselves (“when you decide you like yourself” is brutal lol) before they can be in relationship but isn’t even a ejection given that’s it explicitly saying come back after.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I don't know what CxH and Disclosure put in this song but my goodness this is fucking perfect. They should collab again.

**EnCaine** (10): i am fully single but the lyrics still hit so hard, favorite song of 2020 contender. This would 100% get my 11 if it weren't for XS

**fairytalehigh** (10): definitely spent most of 2020 thinking the chorus was "when you don't have time to think about it / love me but just don't call me at work." this of course makes no sense. anyway this song is perfect

**fenellabeach** (10): i mean what more can i say

**frogaranaman** (10): that chorus gets stuck in my head so often

**hakkerj** (10): CLUB JAMMMMM

**hikkaru** (10): they snapped and disclosure snapped on the production

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this is just so ethreal, the production’s smoothness contrasted with the brisk claps and Chloe/halles flawless vocals. The girls could not do it better

**ignitethephoenix** (10): such a perfect song. Disclosure did amazing in here and I would love to see the girls continue to work with producers like them

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Checkmate, atheists.

**iniekcja\_** (10): Disclosure always serve but somehow their set was possibly the worst concert I've ever been to

**izeaklapaucius** (10): i heart disclosure

**jasannn** (10): Daddy Disclosure did amazing work here.

**jaztinax** (10): the chorus just hits different

**juanolsen** (10): my personal favorite from the album, i love how sexy and sultry it is while also giving an air of mystery and sweetness

**Leixander** (10): so effortlessly cool, love it

**liberalitea** (10): i just love this song

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): invented singing and harmonies, also the VMA UH is the superior version and i can't believe they were capable of THAT

=====

Awkward_King: **LuisEnRod** (10): that VMA’s performance is still living rent free in my mind

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a 10, plain and simple, but the performance of this song they gave at the VMAs? Now THAT'S an 11, right there. Halle's voice in that version is absolutely heavenely, and the songs got a little bit extra drums or sumn. Nonetheless, iconic.

**musical\_pyn** (10): wait no this one deserved to blow up

**nootnoot781** (10): i wish i had 2 11s to give because this song is just unreal. the way their voices just glide on disclosure’s production, it’s out of this world.

**pat-rickstar** (10): "VMAS! Welcome to the Ungodly Hour" lives in my head rent free. Another 11 contender for me

**plastichaxan** (10): this is a song for hot bitches only, so if you don’t like this song i have some news for you

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i don't even have words, it's just a good song.

**poptartchill** (10): just a great song

**pros-and-connors** (10): this would have been my 11 but unfortunately XS’ grip on my soul wouldn’t let me

**Qustomar** (10): Kaytranada stay mad (jk I love you Kaytranada).

**RandomHypnotica** (10): without a doubt the highlight of an already strong album. The harmonies are divine, the sweeping instrumental is heavenly and it's just a transcendental experience listening to it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Jesus came back from the dead, but could he serve these vocals? I'll wait.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I mean what can i say its immaculate

**runaway3212** (10): if I could give a second 11 this would be it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): A song that’s full of compassion but also no bullshit, I love CxH being direct to a love interest who’s just not in the emotional space to commit. I’m watching Star Trek: TNG for the first time and this reminds me of the connection between Troi and Riker, Trekkies stand up!

**salivantsonority** (10): Fantastic vocals. Slinking melody. Really, really good title track. That bridge is gorg. Love how the vocal quality and timbre changes.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I wasn’t expecting to give this a 10 going into the rate but I guess I had forgotten how good this is

**Stryxen** (10): girls this needs to win and we all know that

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): disclosure!!

**throwaway7650** (10): an 11 contender for me, I hope this makes it into the top 5!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): UGH I wish I could make this my 11 but Sawayama calls, unfortunately. Such a perfect song! Everything about it is perfectly executed and it just feels so otherworldly

**urfavgalpal** (10): Chloe and Halle really have the most gorgeous voices.  Also I really love how this is like a hype song for Chloe and Halle but it includes the listener in it so you feel apart of their world (unintentional little mermaid pun)

**waluigiest** (10): go off dire dire docks OST

**wasian-invasion** (10): ultimate siblings-siblings teamup with disclosure here. They sound soo good on this production

**welcome2thejam** (10): If you don't love me at my Ungodliest, you don't deserve me at my Godliest. Also moved up two extra points from when I rated it in the indieheads exchange! Congrats!

**welcometoNY** (10): this is genuinely one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard; their harmonies here are otherwordly and the lyrics really do their vocals justice

**xaviersi** (10): honestly for the live performances their harmonies and timing is always perfect

**bbfan132** (9.5): youuu youuu youuu, like youuu youuu youuu, like youuuuuu :daisybop:

**jman457** (9.5): Their voices with Disclosure’s production makes for a fantastic song

**jsonphile** (9.5): the way they say ungodly hour is so satisfying what a great melody

**notarobot3675** (9.5): my second favourite song on the album, everyday i thank the gods (chloe and halle) for giving this song an mv

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): The perfect title track, just so beautiful pop perfection

**nick1372** (9): ok the groove on this is TIGHT!! I’ve never heard this track before this rate but I’m in love already

**NotWith10000Men** (9): when the beat kicks in and the chorus starts up it's SOOO GOOD

**targetguest** (9): an undeniably good song

**Uberpigeon** (9): If this was the VMAs version with the drum beats it would be a 10. (its also not complete without chloe saying: VMAs!.... welcome... to the ungodly hour)

**zagreux** (9): this was a grower but slaps real hard once you get into it

**Palutzel** (8.6): gottmik voice gorge

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I love the story here: when you stop being a fuckboy, we can fuck. "When you decide you like yourself" is such a brutal line, I truly hope no one listening can relate.

**shhhneak** (8.5): Their falsettos… I am ascending.

**KennyEarthman** (8): has a night drive through the tunnels vibe

**Oberionsynth** (8): this song is named after the fact that i go to sleep around 5am every day

**NecroDolphinn** (7.8): when the hour is ungodly

# will not be seeing heaven

**Vromega** (8): a good song overall. liked the "shy instruments", the suspended sounds that creates a curious atmosphere. Not that fond of the chorus that doesnt deliver what the verses makes me expect

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I actually like this one, but the song just picks up after the bridge.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): While I don't quite understand the full extent of the hype for this song, I still enjoy it, I just don't really love it like many others do.

**Vultuxe** (7): I think it's alright. The lyrics are clearly decent... melodically it just misses me a bit.

**sirpancakeXI** (6.5): i know it may be a hot take but this never clicked for me, it is not that bad but just not a stand out for me when there are so many bop here.

**pig-serpent** (3): Not a fan of underwater sounding R&B, and the bass drum is jarring and mixed in a way that kinda hurts my ears. The chorus has some alright elements that bump the song up a bit, but it's not enough to save it for me.

Unsurprisingly, this was never not winning. Ungodly Hour put up a good fight, it was like 15/20 points behind until it kind of lagged among all the ballots in the last day, but not enough to overcome the power of what I will be calling Y2Communism. XS wasn't my introduction to Rina but it was the first song I became *obsessed* with by her, and I think that's the case for a lot of people. STFU! and Comme Des Garcons were both bangers, but XS really captures the moods of both of them and manages to smash them together while also being quite poignant commentary on the excess of western life. The haunting almost mystic intro, into the collection of heavy drum smashes into what could honestly be a Pussycat Dolls song from 2005 is, imo, one of the singest greatest musical moments of last year - So it's fitting it's the winner here.

---

# sexy bitches who read marxist theory

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): Fuck capitalism and consumerism. - sent from my iPhone I got one and a half years ago and that I haven’t finished paying off.

**anothertown** (11): this is definitely one of the songs of all time

**CarlieScion** (11): everybody always laughs at me when I say I think of this as a sexy song but it’s like…. Satire that makes Capitalism SexyTM and none of y’all will be able to take that from me!!!!!!!!!!!

**celladonn** (11): The only song ever

**Dekubaku** (11): XS? More like XL in terms of how amazing this song is.

**EnCaine** (11): hello favorite pop song of 2020

**hikkaru** (11): i just thought it was the best song i'd ever heard

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): ugh this song is the favorite to win so I dont really WANT it to be my 11 but it totally is and I understand why. this is an anti-consumerism banger

**ignitethephoenix** (11): truly one of the best pop songs from last year. I feel so basic giving this my 11 but it definitely deserves

**JunkyGS** (11): I hope the cliche of this being the winner doesn't make people overlook and forget how truly incredible this song is. An asian popstar being unapologetically fearless with their instrumental choice and song topic, the production being able to show its influences but be fresh, the very clever song writing to fit the theme but still flow super well and the range of vocals provided. When you look at all of these factors and combine them.... there truly is no other song like this in the history of pop music.

**ManofOranges** (11): RINA DID NOT JUST GIVE MORE SHE GAVE EVERYTHINGGGGGG ON THIS SONG. Something something Karl Marx found dead. Something something oh me oh my. Bottom line, if this song doesn't win I'm starting a revolution.

**martian\_pet** (11): AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!

**nootnoot781** (11): does anyone else think global warming is a bad thing? i love rina sawayama. i think she’s a really interesting artist.

**plastichaxan** (11): predictable maybe but when it’s right it’s right

**pros-and-connors** (11): Rina made a song satirizing excessive consumption and capitalism that is simultaneously an amazing piece of satire and a even better gimme anthem than 7 Rings or Fabulous (from High School Musical 2). We have no choice but to stan!

**RandomHypnotica** (11): As much as I would've loved to give my 11 to something else, there really was no other choice than XS. I remember first discovering Rina when I did the 2017 EP Rate. I was listening to the playlist in order, and I must've accidentally hit shuffle, and 10-20-40 started playing. I was hooked instantly. I went through the rest of the RINA EP, and I loved every single song. It was such an amazing experience, realising you've just discovered a new favourite artist. To this day, the RINA EP is still one of my favourite music projects ever, and most of the songs, but in particular 10-20-40 and Cyber Stockholm Syndrome are some of my top favourite of all time tracks. After a while, we started getting loose singles from Rina. Valentine, Cherry and Flicker. They were all really fun, cute songs, but nothing that really stood up to the same quality as the EP. But I wasn't worried, because these weren't album cuts. Eventually, STFU! came out as the first single. I really did like that track, but it was a very different sound, and Rina admitted as much, so I wasn't too worried. Then CDG came out. It's very much a great song again, but once again, it wasn't living up to the quality of the EP in my head. Was I setting my expectations way too high? Was I never going to feel quite that level of adoration and amazement that I did with the Rina EP?. Then XS happened. Instantly I got that same feeling as I did from the RINA EP, the excitement at how fresh this sounded, how instantly iconic and catchy. How perfect. It was the moment that really solidifed Rina as an all-time favourite artist for me. Of course, SAWAYAMA ended up being a fantastic album, and even if I don't love the entire project front to back as much as I do with RINA, XS will always continue to be one of my favourite songs, and definitely deserving of my 11.

**ReallyCreative** (11): I know we hate predictable winners but girls, let's look at the material. She deserves it.

**rickikardashian** (11): i really cant picture a scenario where this doesnt win and honestly i hope i dont have to witness it:)

**sarcasticsobs** (11): GIMME JUST A LITTLE BIT. MORE.

**SFbby** (11): GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MOREEEEEEEE of this grade A pop banger

**shesdoingyoga** (11): Honestly most of the songs on SAWAYAMA could get my 11 but I’m picking the one that probably has the best chance of winning because I like winning

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): the way she singlehandedly dismantled capitalism with this song

**slimboyfriend** (11): I was going to give my 11 to a CRJ song I liked more, but this song distills everything Rina does well: Boiling a gargantuan theme down to 3 minutes of catchy off-kilter pop music. So congrats.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): for some reason I always mishear the first word of the second verse and assume it's the f-slur

**steelstepladder** (11): Im in my basic bitch era

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): it serves britney. it serves 90s r&b. it serves engaging social commentary. it serves that one reaction picture of miranda cosgrove on the set of icarly with blue hair.... while also serving that one reaction pic of paris hilton wearing the stop being poor shirt. the mv served story and visuals on a budget. she served us what is quite literally the best song ever created. literally what more can we ask for? that being said... [Intro] More ????????????

**waluigiest** (11): best pop song of 2020 I stay obsessed

# no iphone

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): If this track wins the rate, so be it, honestly, what a phenomenal anti-capitalist banger and a half. Not only is it clever in its wordplay (XS, get it, excess which is synonymous with more, and XS for extra small? I see it. Haha.) but the homage to early 2000s "classic" pop works wonders. What an idiosyncratic instrumental too, with the plucked guitars, that super dramatic string opening, the banging breakdown that happens before the chorus. This song flopping is just another piece of evidence for the GP's lack of taste.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a rate winner

**Alumineous** (10): Seeeeeeexxx when all that's left is immaterial.

**amiriteor** (10): i actually am a fucking capitalist in my juicy track suit

**bbfan132** (10): a rocker and a bop all at once

**bespectacIed** (10): I don't want to be too salty about this song being the winner. I love this song so much. Excellent production and thoughtful lyrics about materialism? Yes please. It's just that it's realllllyyy not the best song on the album...it's Bad Friend

**bigbigbee** (10): I’ve said this elsewhere, but – the two white actors playing the TV announcers in this MV didn’t have to go that hard. But they did. they did it for us.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Karl Marx found resurrected only to die again.

**camerinian** (10): “Rina Sawayama, a member of the RADICAL LEFT FEMINIST DEMOCRATS wants to seize the means of production, yet her song is produced by Kyle Shearer, Chris Lyon, Valley Girl? Curious” - Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA

**cashewconstellation** (10): perfect, this is actually my 100th listen

**conceptualromance** (10): ended capitalism etc etc etc

**cremeebrulee** (10): like i said with blinding lights, sometimes the most obvious winner IS the right one. i would love to see cxh pull an upset just because they’re the underdogs here but i will not say no to an anti-captialism bop either

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): not a lot of people could make a fun pop song about consumerism and capitalism criticism but she succeeds. As always I love her rock influences.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): My goodness, the way Rina tackled capitalism in a pop perfection of a song is so fucking genius. This is the main pop girl that we are waiting for tbh.

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): This song has it all: gorgeous string intro, amazing 00’s R&B throwback vibes, a scathing critique of our consumerist culture – it’s EVERYTHINGGGG

**J\_Toe** (10): wish I could give two 11s in this rate! XS will probably win (was voted top track of 2020 after all). I think the music video is a bit awkward, but the song is AMAZING!

**jasannn** (10): I loved this song from the moment I heard those blaring guitars. OH ME OH MY!

**jman457** (10): Dont tell Taylor, but Rina really ended capitalism with this song

**jsonphile** (10): why does rina make capitalism sound so fun

**just\_thonking** (10): There was a point where I was thinking of lowering the score because I thought the song could get annoying at times, but then I realized it's just because it's so catchy that I end up playing it too much and get sick of it

**KennyEarthman** (10): never gets old imo

**kirby31200** (10): Capitalism more like crapitalism

**musical\_pyn** (10): more.

**notarobot3675** (10): comrade rina making iconic bops

**Oberionsynth** (10): weird how Rina invented Marxism but they named it after some dude. Rosalind Franklin vibes here.

**pat-rickstar** (10): The Bree Runway remix couldn’t be included in the bonus rate because it's too powerful, this song would've won both rates

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): banger, bop, best song ever created, it's stunning. karl marx who?

**Qustomar** (10): Of all the 'y2k' songs that have been released in recent years, this is one of the only ones that actually sounds like it could come from the early-mid 2000s lol. Big Pussycat Dolls 'Buttons'/Britney 'Britney/In the Zone'/Disney Channel Original Movie Soundtrack vibes.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is one of the most refreshing genre blends Rina has ever done. It’s not in your face nu-metal or R&B, but a perfect alchemy of the two. Makes me feel like more of a bad bitch than designer clothes ever could.

**salivantsonority** (10): Legendary for a reason. So smart and that guitar drop remains fucking sick.

**seanderlust** (10): my two comments I wrote about this are "capitalism will be the death of us all" and "BOP"

**shhhneak** (10): make me less so I want more bought a zip code at the MAAaaAAllLLllLL

**skargardin** (10): I'm sure this will win no matter what really

**SupremeShani** (10): I would be shocked if this didn't ended up winning the rate. A catchy, 2000s inspired beat lined up with airy violins and a electric guitar that weaves in and out, the song is aggressively glittery that it's no wonder it's became so loved. Add in an anti-capitalist message, that manages to point out the hypocrisy of excess wealth without the usual pretentious wink of irony that many artists do, and it's easy to see why it's a fan favorite.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a popheads fave and for good reason

**targetguest** (10): no other score would be appropriate

**throwaway7650** (10): easy 10, this song is just too good. stream the bree runway remix too!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): I KNEW this one would be her sorta crossover hit the second I heard it and I’m so happy I was right, it’s such a brilliant little slice of Rina’s artistry

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the most obvious rate winner in a while. will i try to stop it? no

**Turpamutteri** (10): Elon Musk is shaking

**Vultuxe** (10): XS is a classic and probably the winner here, but I'll allow it.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Knew instantly that Rina was someone worth paying attention to when I first heard this. So much talent to make this work as well as she did.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Communist anthem

**zagreux** (10): um yes queen skinny legend versace boots the house down slay queen hunty mama and oop daddy work rina sawayama snatch my wig

**urfavgalpal** (9.8): I think this is the most enjoyable and fun song on the album (maybe comme des garçons as the only exception) but in think there are a few songs that are better than it on this album

**pheromenos** (9.5): oh me hee hee

**Palutzel** (9.3): excellent pop song, Rina marxist queen

**vagenda** (9.1): It’s really nothing deep and nothing new lyrically but sonically it’s pretty undeniable

**artzpop** (9): Rina Comradayama

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Grew off of me a little, whoops.

**engifear** (9): Insert Karl Marx joke here

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I think part of what makes the song so successful is that it isn’t just a preachy “capitalism bad” type thing, it actually leans into how perversely enjoyable the act of consumption can be. The maddening pace at which she sings the chorus and the way she jumps between notes makes it feel like she’s trying to grab all that she can *musically*, which is a neat effect that’s both exciting and kind of sickening. Like I’m disgusted by the excesses of modern society but like… just a *little* bit couldn’t hurt, right? Oh me oh my…

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Well, she is the one to blame. She asked for XS, so now I'm giving it to her. I was taught not to be rude.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): god what a fucking chorus. just the tiniest bit more energy would push it to a 10 but it's the tiniest nitpick

**thedoctordances1940** (9): So true bestie Marx

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): oh me, oh my we love consumerism

**wasian-invasion** (9): rina sawayamarx

**savemeaseat143** (8.7): communist manifesto

**akanewasright** (8.5): I’m going to get annoyed when this wins, but I’ll understand.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Queen of both capitalism and anti-capitalism.

**runaway3212** (8.5): this was amazing when I first heard it but got worse and worse the more I heard it, it's still good though

**wavingwolves** (8.3): i love the DAAM DAAM DAAM of the guitar in this sooo much

**afs** (8): Ever thought metal and Britney nostalgia could go together? Neither did I. But it works.

**juanolsen** (8): this is actually one of the weakest songs on the album in my opinion

**nick1372** (8): queen of ironically capitalist bops dolly parton is quaking

**pig-serpent** (8): I wish more pop artists wold invoke the metal guitars for just a few seconds at a time like Rina does here.

# not me being goofy i-

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): even though it is kinda obvious that this will win the rate but i need to say that this is not even top 3 on the album.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I do hear the appeal and the fact that she mixed rock with early 2000s pop is very cool but... I don't know, I just don't think it's that good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i mean she’s cute but not rate winner best song of 2020 cute

**TiltControls** (8): overrated and I really really hope it doesn't win (but still worthy of a 8)

**Uberpigeon** (8): I dont love this song as much as some people do but its a fun bop, and it ended capitalism which was pretty neat.

**vayyiqra** (8): Discourse time! This is almost certainly going to win and it will be boring. It's a good song, yes. It's catchy and relatable. I never quite got the absurd hype this song has though. However, even though the "Rina anti-capitalist queen, singlehandedly ended consumerism" etc. memes are stale by now and were never that funny to me, nevertheless it is a pretty based song, I must give it that. The video was also cool. So I'm not going to be mad when this either wins or lands in the top 3, because I do like it. It's just not a 10 to me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The real unspoken star of this song is the timpani

**frogaranaman** (7): I haven’t read theory but I listened to Rina Sawayama’s “XS” and that’s close enough [note: I have actually read theory, do not let lies on the internet lead you to believe otherwise]

**Roxieloxie** (7): This is gonna win and its not even the best song on the album!!! i hate it here!!! like fuck capitalism but this between dynasty and stfu its no contest

**Vromega** (6.5): I know popheads love for this song, I've tried really hard to enjoy this song more but I really can't. I've done my best but the electric guitars hurt my ears, the chorus is going too fast and is repetitive

**ktajlili** (6): Most overrated song on this sub. Like I get that it is suppose to be satire, but it's not funny. It's not even that catchy. Worst of all, spotify was convinced I would love this song so it would play it over and over if I didn't have it already playing everything. Sorry, BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE ME TO LIKE THIS.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Basically it sounds like Britney-meets-nu metal, and I guess that's why people love it, but I unfortunately care for neither so this does nothing for me.

# jack you are wrong but it's bree stanning so i'll allow it

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): this is fun but i feel alone in saying i actually like the Breemix better

# i hate to break this to you

**welcometoNY** (7): the last time i gave a song a seven, it won and i regretted not scoring it lower. please don't let that happen again

# ???

**oscarbrierley1** (9): I was going to give this a really low score to be messy but I've decided to be nice

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: This is such an innocent question oml chill with the downvotes guys.

But I will answer this question. I think it's quite clever that Rina was able to do some social commentary on capitalism which is wrapped in a pop perfection of a song. It's not exactly revolutionary but I think Rina pulled it off so perfectly that I just can't help but be impressed.

Awkward_King: # Ungodly Hour

---

**Overall Average**: 8.099 **// Average Controversy:** 1.489

---

**Roxieloxie** (9.983): i mean i guess its okay :/

**conceptualromance** (9.625): this album is just so impressive to me (??). They’re incredibly talented

**bespectacIed** (9.583): Flawlessly done pop, r&b, and soul tracks from the two most talented and likeable newbies in the industry. I am banking in on Chloe x Halle supremacy.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.417): One of the best albums of all time.

**wavingwolves** (9.333): i always associate this album with grocery shopping because that was my go to grocery shopping album for a few months but this is a compliment tbh. this is incredibly well produced and i love the textures the songs have, it's all velvet smooth and silky.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.317): one of my favorite albums from last year, I’m so excited to see what they do next. They are so talented and deserve to be even bigger.

**akanewasright** (9.292): Genuinely, how do you make an album this good so early into your careers?

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.250): I regret sleeping on this album for several months after it came out.

**ReallyCreative** (9.167): I don't have the words to express how much I love this fucking album

**musical\_pyn** (9.083): I immediately fell in love with this album, and my love has only grown since to the point where this is probably my favorite album of 2020

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.975): My most listened to artist of 2020 behind like Beyoncé and my most listened to artist of 2019. Very excited.

**geraldinewww** (8.942): i think i'd only listened to this once (?) before this rate and MY MISTAKES.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY GOD!!!!!!!!!

**Dekubaku** (8.942): A seriously amazing album I discovered through this sub and this rate. It has the voice, the lyrics, the production!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.917): I haven't heard of any music from Chloe x Halle until I saw people praising this album when it came out. It's so easy to see why. It's so impressive that this album was worked with so many producers but Chloe and Halle found a way to make this album sonically consistent. Even with one weak song in this perfect album, every song didn't feel like a filler at all. On top of it, their vocals are so heavenly (which you will see a lot in my comments about some of the tracks lol) and their songwriting is top-notch. I can't wait for what Chloe x Halle has up in their sleeves next. And oh, thank you Beyonce for trusting Chloe and Halle so much to deliver a perfect album.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.908): The album I was least familiar with going into the rate. I knew of and loved the two big singles, but the rest of the tracklist impressed me with how well-written it was, the great production, and Chloe and Halle's sublime vocals.

**pat-rickstar** (8.833): My #2 album of 2020, they weren't even on my radar until this came out and I fell in love as soon as I checked it out.

**anothertown** (8.833): slept on masterpiece

**waluigiest** (8.833): it didn’t instantly click for me but in February 2021 wow it hit

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (8.750): love the whole vibe of this album

**kirby31200** (8.708): I had never heard of these two before 2020 and boy have they made a fantastic first impression on me.

**plastichaxan** (8.617): this album is so full of serves, i’m ashamed to admit how long it took me to find this such a great album but i learned my lesson

**NotWith10000Men** (8.583): why the hell haven't I had this album on constant repeat since I first heard it?? I will be rectifying that immediately

**jayjaysortagay** (8.583): this is iconic

**bookthieving** (8.542): the only artist in this rate to not get below a 6 from me. they cannot make a bad song

**jsonphile** (8.542): this was my first time listening to this album, but wow it’s really solid. Chloe and Halle are both fantastic singers, and these are some incredibly well written tracks. If there’s any justice in the world, these girls are gonna be one of the biggest acts of the 2020s

**fadedblue09** (8.542): They mopped the competition with ease! In all seriousness, I’m so glad to discover them. I’m normally skeptical of PH-core albums like these, but this just feels different from the rest in many ways. Despite the high caliber production, the girls and their soulful vocals are the highlight of every song. Not to mention they easily convey a lot of mature subject matter in their lyrics, I find it hard to believe they’re the youngest among these artists. Most popheads-core albums feel very of-the-moment, but I can see myself revisiting this a lot in the future.

**engifear** (8.500): I swear they could sing about literally anything and it would sound absolutely beautiful (as long as there are no men also singing)

**skargardin** (8.500): This is so solid and I can't wait to hear what they do after this! Hopefully it isn't too robbed this rate.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.458): perfection from start to finish apart from that one song...

**Qustomar** (8.417): Such a gorgeous album, everything about it is lush and immaculate, yet very youthful at the same time. Chloe x Halle made something very special here.

**EnCaine** (8.342): i didn't listen to anything from this record until almost 2021 and i am a clown for that. CxH are the future

**moooo566** (8.333): This album is the discovery of the month for me, I didn't really get into Do It when it was on the charts and kind of wrote the whole thing off as not for me, but it turns out they're good!

**iniekcja\_** (8.292): I love the idea behind this album and the way it flows through all the songs with some great storytelling, after many listens there are still some tracks that don't stick for me but it's compensated by amazing vocals, songwriting and production on others

**liberalitea** (8.208): Chloe x Halle are such a talented duo and balance eachother perfectly. They write, produce, dance, sing and perform amazingly well. This is an INCREDIBLE project and I'm so excited to hear more from them.

**notarobot3675** (8.183): like thousands of others have said, this album is such a phenomenal debut! theres not one skip on this album, and it really is just a perfect showcase for these girls stellar vocals. while i know this album got a lot of hype online, it really should have made them megastars.

**shhhneak** (8.183): My first time playing through this whole album so I expect it to grow even more on me. By far the best lyricists in this rate that really elevates their unclockable vocals.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.167): An absolute surprise for me last year! I freaking adore this album! I love how incredibly cohesive it is while still maintaining a really diverse and interesting sound across all twelve songs. It’s also so easy to hear how much love and effort was put into this album by Chloe and Halle, and it’s hard not to feel that infectious energy listening to it.

**mudkip1** (8.167): she's perfect, she's beautiful, she looks like Linda Evangelista, she's a model

**Brendon-Urine** (8.042): So glad this rate made me sit down and really listen to this. I kinda wrote it off on release but this album is beautiful all the way through with just a few meh tracks in the middle. Production is insanse (shoutout Queen B)

Awkward_King: ---

**poptartchill** (7.958): I first listened to Ungodly Hour a little while after it came out, so I was late to the hype but it did live up to it. I think this album is pretty cohesive without being too much of the same. The vocals/production of vocals are the biggest strengths. I come back to this album somewhat regularly and will continue to do so!

**jasannn** (7.958): The is the best R&B album I've heard since Ctrl. They are serving the some of the best vocals and harmonies in music right now.

**sirpancakeXI** (7.917): i have the same feeling for this as i have for hifn, some of the songs are absolute bop and some that are not my cup of tea

**ktajlili** (7.875): This one may have an unfair advantage to the other albums, because it's a lot fresher, but this is a really high-quality project. There's barely any bad song and it's just overall a really consistent and nice listen. I think as time goes on, however, it will be clearer which tracks end up being my favorite.

**KennyEarthman** (7.833): pros: Chloe x Halle have beautiful voices, album is filled with catchy melodies and bops // cons: most songs are growers, so they didn't catch me at first. I also don't like the more trap-heavy songs

**thedoctordances1940** (7.708): I really like this album, even more so after doing this rate, but it still only feels like a step in the right direction for me. The album shows so much potential and there are definitely songs I love, but I'm pretty confident their best album is still ahead of them, I'd even say they still have a future classic up their sleeves. As is though, this album has a little bit too much filler on for me to truly love, but it's still really good, there's no doubt about it.

**vayyiqra** (7.667): Idk why I haven't listened to this album before now, but wow I was depriving myself. R&B music tends to be a genre I like but it can feel samey and uninspired at times. This album though is a nonstop vibe. It hits, it slaps, it bangs, I could go on. tl;dr CxH good

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.667): I was raised on R&B and old school music. My parents always played those stations on car rides. So it’s no surprise how much i LOVE this album! It’s just so amazing, artistic, meaningful… Maybe what puts it over the top for me is the luscious harmonies that Chloe and Halle weave throughout their songs, their voices work so well together. Out of all the 2020 album releases, this was one of my favorites.

**jman457** (7.658): This album just isnt for me, im not really huge into more modern R&B, but it really picks up steam in the end

**just\_thonking** (7.625): Pleasant, although not the most memorable

**CarlieScion** (7.625): damn their voices are soothing af

**afs** (7.583): First R&B album I've listened to that's not by the Weeknd, and had a surprisingly pleasant experience. Didn't like the parts focusing more on rap, but their voices more than make up for it. Insane harmonies.

**welcome2thejam** (7.583): This is the one album of the rate I hadn't listened to beforehand - just never got around to it - and pleased to say that it definitely holds its' own amongst a tough crowd! Lot of strong tracks on here, I'm very interested in seeing how their music careers evolve.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.583): It took me sometime to get into this album but I did. I really like this now more than when it came out. Their harmonies are so beautiful and perfect; it's like a choir of two. I didn't put this on my list of favorite albums of the last year because, like I said, I kinda slept on it. However, this would probably be on my top 10 if I were to make another rank.

**Palutzel** (7.583): great production and vocals, it's not really my type of pop, but it's hard to ignore how cohesive and consistent it is

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.500): CxH would have had a real diamond mine of a record if not for the second half of the record, but overall it's nothing to sneeze at. One of the best releases from 2020, CxH have proven that they have what it takes to make real R&B pop hits. Though honestly if they did an entire record with Disclosure I would probably give it a pre-emptive 9 or something, the title track is phenomenal and for it to lead up to the rest of the record being kinda meh is a little disappointing. I could see this bumping higher in my ratings though, it's a little bit of a grower.

**buddhacharm** (7.458): I don't...really have any nostalgic attachment to this album, but I can identify it as objectively great something I cannot say about Dedicated Side B. I do wish I liked this more, but my average score for this album is probably higher than many anyways lol

**wasian-invasion** (7.458): I would not have listened to this if it weren't for r/popheads, so thank you for broadening my horizons to these amazing vocalists. Still don't know which one is Chloe and which one is Halle, but excited for their future careers

**camerinian** (7.375): I really wish this album worked all the way through, but it is a debut and CxH are clearly still working out their distinct sound, and I trust that they will find it and drop a really great album eventually

**CreepyMannequin** (7.375): Not a perfect album, but a great spohmore album with a lot of great high points. Definitely looking forward to where Chloe & Halle go with their next album.

**SmileAndTears** (7.325): Lots of bops but the last 2 songs are really... uh... something. They saw what Dua was doing with her album and decided to have a Good In Bed/BWBB moment too

**nooodisaster** (7.208): they served with this & showed everyone who doubted them that they're a force to be reckoned with

**zagreux** (7.208): I was kinda apprehensive going into this album since Chloe x Halle's music isn't exactly my cup of tea but it was pretty good. My only gripe with this is that some of these songs needed to be longer.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.933): i REALLY did not want to leave this album feeling like Do It is by far and away the best song here and everything else is just "okay" but..... well...

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.833): tbh i wasnt expecting to like this as much as I do, but after a few listens this album is great. some of the tracks blend into each other but this album has little to no duds

**nick1372** (6.708): This is the only one of the four albums here that I haven’t listened to dozens of times before, so I’ve probably rated it a bit unfairly. Still, after listening to it fully I get the sense that Chloe x Halle are extremely talented and have an insane amount of potential, but a lot of their production & songwriting choices are mediocre in an uninteresting sort of way. I think if their sophomore album is more focused on creating a specific atmosphere and follows less mainstream trends then I’ll become a huge fan.

**pig-serpent** (6.333): These girls are clearly talented but I don't normally consider myself an R&B fan and I find this album to be lacking in hooks.

**Vultuxe** (6.000): While a couple of songs on this record are stellar to me, the majority of it is forgettable. The quality difference between Forgive Me and Tipsy compared to the rest of the album is wild. It's unfortunate that an album can contain some of my favorite songs of year along with my least favorite.

**welcometoNY** (5.692): going into this album i expected to rate it a lot higher, but i guess i don't like it as much as a i thought i did. aside from a few standout tracks, it's not very memorable.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.417): I've heard CxH do covers but this was the first time I had ever heard them tackle their own music. It's fine. It exists. While they have nice voices I just don't vibe with this record and nothing sticks with me. It was just in one ear and right out the other and it completely bypassed by brain.

Awkward_King: # SAWAYAMA

---

**Overall Average**: 8.336 **// Average Controversy:** 1.603

---

**bespectacIed** (10.071): Best album of 2020. Has there been a modern pop album that touched more non-romantic topics than SAWAYAMA? Self-confidence, family, friendship, Asian identity, materialism... even the only song tangentially romantic in this album (tokyo love hotel) is a Mitski-esque song about culture difference. All these themes tied together by such pristine, forward-thinking, and catchy production. When we overhype Rina in these spaces, we are not doing it enough!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10.000): this is quite possibly my favorite album of all time. it's one of my most listened to albums ever. i love it dearly and i will be rating it as such. it's so rare for me to come across a body of work that i adore all parts of the whole, and all of them here are so intricate and unique. and they all slap. she tackles something different lyrically, thematically, and sonically on every track here and she fucking nails it. rina did what she had to do and i love her for it. like... truly... what a time to be alive. anyways stream sawayama

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.679): THE 2020 album of the year. Seriously one of my absolute favorite albums of all time. Every single song is immaculately crafted and tells such a vivid story that is so deeply personal and yet also deeply relatable. I can’t believe it’s Rina’s debut album because it has the seasoned flair of a very experienced musician. Not to be all “I knew her before she got big,” but I am proud that I’ve been following her since Cyber Stockholm Syndrome and now she’s one of the music world’s critical darlings. Ugh... it’s what she deserves.

**conceptualromance** (9.607): This is my favorite album from last year. She is the moment!

**moooo566** (9.607): Wow it's the best album of 2020. Can I give a 10 to every single song or is that prohibited as reverse sabotage?

**Dekubaku** (9.586): One of the best albums I have ever heard! The variety, the mood, the themes, the production, perfection!

**kirby31200** (9.571): 2020 AOTY. A nearly perfect 10/10

**ReallyCreative** (9.500): I was anticipating this album for so long and it delivered on every front. Dynasty is one of the best songs ever made, point blank period. XS is all the hype and more, a masterclass in nostalgia-pop while staying fresh and interesting. Bad Friend is everything. All the bops in between are everything. My album of 2020.

**liberalitea** (9.500): This is honestly the definition of a no-skip album. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th listens are just as good as the 1st and I just don't get tired of it- in face I may even discover more gems. Such an incredible debut and she manages to address such complex topics so well and I love the Y2K sound inspiration but also the fact she doesn't stick to one specific genre. Amazing album.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.414): The RINA EP is one of my favourite music projects of all time, and I was worried SAWAYAMA wouldn't be able to live up to it. While it isn't quite as consitent as RINA to me, I still absolutely love SAWAYAMA, and Rina continues to prove her excellence, and that she's only going upwards from here.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.400): easily top 3 albums of 2020

**pat-rickstar** (9.393): My #1 favourite album of 2020, I just love how eclectic it is in terms of genre/sound and lyrical content. There are no songs on here about romance, love or breakups which is honestly so refreshing.

**Alumineous** (9.357): Immigrated at a young age? Friend ghoster? Immigrant identity clashes? Experienced microaggressions? Felt insecure? Disowned by your parents? Check, check, check, check, check and check! Wow. This was a very personal record for me. I didn't know Rina before the pandemic, and I'm grateful to have discovered it. Finally, I have to note that SAWAYAMA was one of the albums that got me into the subreddit. I loved how we all experienced this pandemic with this music and discussed it together. And I decided to stick around. Y'all are a fun bunch.

**plastichaxan** (9.314): no one is truly doing it like Rina, this album is just her exploring and proving how great she is at everything, this album was such a moment for me last year and i hope it’s not hard to see why

**anothertown** (9.214): cries

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.143): I listened to the album one time before this rate. It didn't give me a strong impression but I was willing to listen to the album again because I probably didn't get the concept and the lyrics at that time. This rate was the perfect time to revisit the album and wow, I am so glad I looked at the lyrics because I heavily resonated with the topics that Rina tackled in this album. As an Asian diaspora kid who grew up in a foreign country and consumed Western media, this is the album that felt like it was tailored-made for me by a fellow Asian immigrant. Thank you Rina for making this album, for all of us Asian diaspora kids.

**steelstepladder** (9.086): YAAAAAAAAAAAAS

**skargardin** (9.071): Pretty crazy to think of how strong this debut is.

**notarobot3675** (9.057): my album of the year 2020, just... what a perfect debut

**akanewasright** (8.921): Genuinely, Rina deserves the fucking world. She could do no wrong for me over the past year and a half.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.893): A record with a rich, diverse palette of influences, genres, lyrical themes, and emotions that are so well-evoked by Rina's singing, SAWAYAMA is one of the most captivating albums of 2020 that puts onto display her tremendous vocal abilities and her knack of crafting slightly off-kilter yet thoroughly enjoyable and sometimes even radiantly beautiful pop songs. Rina proves that she can do it all, and all while marching to the beat of her own drum. Sidenote if you see my SAWAYAMA reviews are way more detailed than the others is because I thought I could put in the effort for the whole thing but gave up after one record... FML.

**jsonphile** (8.893): the first time I listened to this was back in September I was blown away by how good this was. I had heard great things from fellow popheads but even with high expectations going in it still blew me away. Not even exaggerating, this has become one of my top ten albums of all time I love it so much. I don’t know if it’ll stay there or if over time I may start to like it less but I’ve listened to this dozens of times over the last several months and I’m still not tired of it. You go Rina

**ggal2020** (8.879): remember when this and Fetch the Bolt Cutters came out on the same night? I hate to say it, but that was a cultural reset

**bookthieving** (8.679): wow music really hits different when someone with a background similar to yours writes about their experiences and you can relate to them

**Roxieloxie** (8.671): I think the first half fucks slightly more but overall i had fun

**sirpancakeXI** (8.643): i honestly did not expect this to have my highest average when the rate is being announced, but it just keep growing and growing on me

**EnCaine** (8.643): rina is 2/2 right now with RINA and SAWAYAMA and i hope she keeps up the excellence

**wasian-invasion** (8.607): I loved Cherry and Alterlife but for some reason never really listened to anything else in her discography. This didn't click immediately either, but after like the third listen or so, it's probably in my top 4 for the year for how consistently good and sonically diverse it is. Happy to see rina get the critical acclaim she deserves, now lets just hope she breaks through to the gp in her next era

**shhhneak** (8.593): I remember putting this album off for weeks after it was released because I didn’t trust the hype. My jaw was on the floor within the first minute of Dynasty.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.571): smasha

**poptartchill** (8.536): This was one of my favorite albums of 2020. I would like to thank this sub for hyping it up enough that I listened to it the day it came out so I never had to suffer in a world where this album came out and I didn't know about it. I love the rock influences especially. It's so cohesive yet all the songs are SO different. Overall amazing album.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.500): Clarence Clarity is the only good Clarity we've ever rated.

**SmileAndTears** (8.493): best pop album of 2020 (along WYP) yup yup yup

**Palutzel** (8.450): this album gets better with every listen, so many bops, really hope Rina gets huge

**AHSWeeknd** (8.429): Day 3 of this rate is just gonna be a listening party for this album. Without Chosen Family.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.414): As I did to Ungodly Hour, I slept on it for a while. I just couldn't understand what Rina was doing here. The tracks sounded so weird and messy. Fortunately, I woke up just in time to give it another try and it has really grown on me since. There's just a couple of tracks that I don't love so much, but they're no skips at all. I listen to the entirety of this album and when it finishes I just want to press replay, which I end up doing every time hahahah. My second favorite off of this rate for sure.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.386): Another one of my favorite albums from last year, I’m so excited to see what she does next. Rina can do so many different kind of sounds well and it’s refreshing to hear that.

**jasannn** (8.321): I don't know how she did it but she made a bunch songs over many different genres and sounds that still managed to sound cohesive and personal. This would be my 2020 AOTY if it weren't for Future Nostalgia and folklore.

**jman457** (8.314): I slightly prefer her EP, but its still one of the strongest debut album in years

Awkward_King: ---

**geraldinewww** (8.286): this was my most listened to album last year. also found out me and rina were born like a week apart so i think this means we're soulmates. rina if you're reading this... also RIP to my preorder package vinyl copy i bought and then got lost in the mail along with the shirt i was going to give my sibling

**welcome2thejam** (8.286): Definitely not alone in calling this my favorite album in the rate. She pulls off the juggling act of all these different sounds and genres while still staying certifiably Rina. Without a doubt one of the best albums of last year.

**buddhacharm** (8.214): PROJECTION ALERT: The release of this album coincided with one of the darkest times in my life, where everything seemed to be falling apart around me. As tacky as it may sound, SAWAYAMA provided me with a feeling of renewal and sustenance; though it is quite clearly an extremely singular and personal exploration of her own trauma and triumph, the wide range of emotions and narratives that it presents spoke to me on a level that only a few albums have managed. Through invoking every facet of her identity (identities that we share) — queerness, first-generation status, Asian-ness, etc. — Rina created something that I've carried and internalized on emotional, intellectual and visceral levels. I don't think I've heard a popstar provide such illuminating portrayals of intergenerational trauma, cultural displacement, and intersectional identity, and by pulling herself ahead from the pack, Rina has managed to become a niche icon of sorts for me and someone I hope will really pave the way for future queer POC popstars

**Qustomar** (8.214): Love this album! So fun and eclectic! I will say, sometimes the lyrics and vibe can get a little corny, a little theater kid-y, but I can move past that because it bops otherwise. I love how every song is a different genre yet flow effortlessly, like that transition between XS/STFU/Comme Des Garcons shouldn't work but it does??

**iniekcja\_** (8.171): this really is structured perfectly, the strong combination of Dynasty and Snakeskin as opener and closer is truly outstanding and is one of the main things that make the album as good as it is

**Brendon-Urine** (8.107): I definitely don't go crazy for this album like my fellow popheads but I like it a lot.

**nick1372** (8.107): I’ve listened to this album a lot and didn’t realize until this rate how clearly Rina is a disciple of Lady Gaga. But Gaga could never make an album this straightforward and focused. Rina had a clear vision with this album and she really delivered. This is an incredible statement for a debut album.

**cashewconstellation** (8.079): i just want it to be known that i'm a carly stan, not a rina stan, just in case you try to eliminate my ballot for the amount of good scores i'm giving this album , it's just too good

**thedoctordances1940** (8.036): It took me a while to get into this album surprisingly, I'd say I only liked it at first, but as time has gone on, it's risen further and further up my 2020 Rankings, to the point where it's probably in my top 5 now. Apart from one short weakish (with which I mean still good, just not quite as great as the rest) run before the halfway mark, the album is consistently great and the different genres Rina make it all the more exciting, from your standard electropop, to some brilliant stadium rock, to a beautiful ballad, to some motherfucking metal, it just works together so well and really rewards listening to the whole thing in one piece.

**camerinian** (8.000): I just adore how uniquely defined Rina is right out of the gate. She has her clear influences and yet there's really no other rising pop stars performing in the same lane as her, either content or aesthetic. I'm not excited for the future of any other pop star more than I am for Rina, she has buckets of potential

**KennyEarthman** (8.000): pros: an amazing throwback to the 2000s. has a really diverse set of sounds. enjoyed this the most tbh // cons: there's some skips, but with such a diverse sound it's probably unavoidable. also really frontloaded, and it loses a bit of steam at the end

**nooodisaster** (7.964): The gag that this was my album of the year yet I'm rating it lower than some albums in this rate. I just love Rina so much and the idea of this album and want her to succeed so much maybe I overrated her but idgaf.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.964): this album was a hell of a grower for me. the mesh of pop and rock is masterful and idk why it took me as long as it did to see it

**vayyiqra** (7.857): Alright, this was the most challenging album for me in this rate to get into. It's hard to sum up my thoughts on it. It's lyrically the most complex, I think, and covers a lot of ground both in the topics the songs are about and also the way it changes genre so much. I don't quite feel the "this is a masterpiece and AOTY for 2020" hype, but it is a good album and has grown on me over time. It's somewhat uneven to me because of how eclectic it is, but when it hits, it really hits. Also, it got my 11, so clearly I liked it. (And it wasn't even XS!) I felt kind of guilty for a while about not like Rina more since she seems cool and is in the same scene as a lot of my faves, and I'm also seeing her next year. It will be my first concert in over a year, and I admit I got tickets mainly because Hana is opening for her and because my friend would want to see her. Now I can say I'm more hyped and will enjoy it more, and am looking forward to listening to Rina more. As well, her older material is just as good I think, but I see why many Popheads think this album is next level. It is fresh and unique and original, and most importantly, it bops.

**just\_thonking** (7.821): She really is cultivating her own sound and we're all gonna love it

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.679): honestly one of the best debuts ever, rina really shines here incorporating tried and true songs structures and elements and making them all her own. i dont think there is another album that sounds like this out there she is an enigma and a superstar

**NecroDolphinn** (7.671): This album makes me feel like a Japanese-British girl who hates her mom (and capitalism)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.571): It took me some time to “get” this album. Initially I was disappointed because this sub’s constant “anti-capitalist queen” memes made me think this was gonna be some brilliantly written work when in reality it’s just plain old pop songs lol. But after looking closer at the themes of the songs, like intergenerational trauma, materialism, and national identity, it made me realize that, hey wait, this actually IS a brilliantly written work! What makes it so brilliant is that she can write about these complicated themes in a way that makes them accessible, relatable, and still sound like… “plain old pop songs.”

**CreepyMannequin** (7.393): A stellar debut (well, full-length debut, anyway). There are a few tracks I’m not super into but the highs are so high.

**ktajlili** (7.000): I have mixed feelings about this because I don't like the hits but I like the overall album, even if I have varying opinions on different songs (the opposite of ChloeXHalle).

**Vultuxe** (6.750): My stance on this album is similar to Ungodly Hour. A couple of songs are exceptionally well crafted while others are almost comically bad. The whiplash is real.

**welcometoNY** (6.579): i really thought i would be giving way higher scores here but i guess this album has aged poorly for me. that's not to say i don't like it anymore, but it's not as groundbreaking or special as i thought when i first listened to it.

**fadedblue09** (6.500): Being Asian myself, I’m sad this album isn’t resonating with me as it probably should. Which is a shame, cause I like Rina’s voice and I really think she’s talented. First off, I’ll come clean and say I’m not fond of the whole y2k pop movement. Being a 2000s kid myself, these were not the sounds I liked from that era, and I certainly don’t like them any better now. Also her lyrics are very hit-or-miss, sometimes I forget she’s actually 30. Negativity aside, I do get why the sub obsesses over her. Her music and image incorporate very queer and outsider-ish themes in the best way possible, and I feel like she’s more worthy of the popheads throne than Carly and Charli are now.

**pig-serpent** (6.250): There are a lot of good ideas on here and I love how she meshes her disco pop with a lot of other genres, but I wish I liked this more. The songs rarely come together for me into something special and the production on this album could be better.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4.929): Another record in this rate that is just sort of fine for me, even if it is pretty uneven. I don't have any particular attachment towards the melodies or anything, except for the tracks I really don't like. It's, again, not necessarily a bad album, it just exists and there are so many better projects out there. Lyrically, I find a handful of the tracks on this record childish and not in the fun way, just the bad way. In theory I dig the mash up of 90s alt rock style and bubblegum pop on some tracks but it doesn't come together cohesively for me and feels like a lesser version of each thing it is trying to be.

TiltControls: Thank you to King for such an amazing rate!!! Those shitposts are god-tier! I hate to be the whoever the host is to follow you up :grinny:

Anyways, for stats here are the [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) like always!!

##Songs

Well who saw this coming. **XS** sweeps the competition. It lands on the highest rated songs of all time top 25 leaderboard at #23. It also takes a spot on the most 11's leaderboard at #5 with an amazing 34!

**Ungodly Hour** also gets a stellar score and lands at #47 for highest song averages (not enough for the leaderboard unfortunately) and #11 for most 11's! (which IS enough for the leaderboard!)

##Artists

I think most people thought this would be **Rina's** rate to lose and it turns out they were right! She pretty much swept the competition and the scores really show it. Rina's rate results move her into the top 25 for highest artist averages at #23! 

For the only rate newcomers, **CxH** knocked it out of the park. They enter the artist averages at #27/258 with a stellar 8.099! Their records with Ungodly Hours' title track are also amazing. 

Despite the beating **Charli** endured on day 1, she managed to avoid a total bloodbath on day 2 but unfortunately day 3 wasn't enough to save her. She is one of the 6 artists to lose their whole album before the top 10 (in the 5th earliest exit at #12). Charli also moves into the top 10 for most artist 11's at 5th (with 167) and onto the leaderboard for most artist 0's also at 5th (with 98)! Charli is also now tied for 1st with Beyonce for most Popheads rate appearances at 17 each!! Will Sweetnermore 2 push this to 18? Or are we cursed to never get it?

This sub really said **Carly** was more outmatched that Bebe Rexha and Bionic in their rates. She becomes the 2nd earliest exit in a 4 album rate (after Drake with his near-unbeatable out in 25th place record). Carly also moves up records for 6th most songs rated from 10th (73 -> 85).

Also while Carly and Charli both seemed to be destroyed, their scores actually matched up similarly to their previous rates. Carly's average only dropped by about 0.005 and Charli's average actually rose a little! They just had the misfortune of going up against two stellar albums.

##Albums

~~Probably Sawayama idk~~

So definitely **Sawayama** it seems! It ends up with an absolutely stellar 8.336 which puts it at #14 on the leaderboards for highest album average!

**Ungodly Hour** got an amazing average too, but not enough to make the leaderboards (though it should show up on the top 100 made by Niki)

##Rate

This rate turned out to be the 3rd most participated rate!! It also makes it onto the list of most songs to receive someone's 11 at #6 with 77.55% of the songs picking at least one up!!

speaking of rates, I've heard there are some fantastic ones open right now! [Video game vocals](https://redd.it/n3ilq2) is due in 2 weeks and [Breakup Pop Rock](https://redd.it/n3ikze) is due about a week after that! Please do them both!!!
