Okay let me get something off my chest, this is a great song. I've been a CxH fan since sometime in 2019 when i discovered The Kids Are Alright (and I have an ungodly amount of streams of it as an album (vote mine and Creme's r&b girl debuts/mixtapes next cycle xx)), and this was the first song released as a promo single for the album. It didn't exactly make any major moves, which I get, but it really holds up as a song. Swae does a great job on the song, the three of them riff of one another's vocals amazingly and honestly, you know why this is first out? Misandry. Halle singing "you wanna talk bout me what about you" is HEAVENLY, and *at least* raises this song from above a 0 on it's own.

---

# Misandrists

**bespectacIed** (8): this was fun, idc. but i understand the haters lol. CxH is above this havana rehash

**juanolsen** (7.9): it is my least favorite song from the album, i would leave swae lee out of it

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): This isn't a BAD song by any means, it's just not particularly memorable, it's just very generic

**Alumineous** (7): The features didn't add much to the song. Just a low point of the album.

**Oberionsynth** (7): points off for reminding me straight people are out there

**Palutzel** (6.9): TW MEN

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): blehh m*n

**afs** (6): I thought it was Juice WRLD at first... it's alright, nothing special here.

**bbfan132** (6): this could‚Äôve been cut lol

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no i do not want to see ‚Äòyou cha cha‚Äô

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Hmm...I usually like Swae Lee but he isn't give me much in this song. This is probably my least favorite song in the album because it doesn't stand out to me very much. This is very far from 0 material tho so I guess that's something.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): This one used to be a banger for me. I still like the beat a lot, but the chorus is a bit boring.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): it's giving filler

**ktajlili** (6): It has cool groove, but I think the features overwhelm the song and make it feel out of place in the track list

**pat-rickstar** (6): This has grown on me a bit but it's still bottom 1 of the album

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): Should have been a bonus track, it just doesn't fit at all. but that doesn't make it a bad song, just bad for this album which is largely more mature than this sound and lyricism.

**xaviersi** (6): in a perfect album about women and the female perspective they decided to include a man bleh

**jman457** (5.9): I really like CxH vocals on this but there is too much male energy on this

**jasannn** (5.5): This song really wasn't needed at all. It has some of the most boring and generic production here and adds an unnecessary feature to the album. But it's okay, I guess..

**liberalitea** (5.5): this feels slightly out of place on this album sonically? but it's still a fun song, but i wouldn't play this as much.

**notarobot3675** (5.5): this song is nice, very chill, but i think out of the entire album its the least interesting track for me. its very much a song ive heard a LOT over the last few years.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (5): the worst song of all of these

**Brendon-Urine** (5): it's not bad... but it's definitely not good

**celladonn** (5): The most forgettable song on the album

**EnCaine** (5): the only truly meh song on this record imo. just pretty forgettable

**frogaranaman** (5): I mean it‚Äôs okay

**iniekcja\_** (5): I hate Swae Lee on tropical style beats, this is no exception

**KennyEarthman** (5): the girls' vocals snapped, wish this was a solo song

**nick1372** (5): don‚Äôt like how the production overwhelms their vocals, especially on the chorus. Not sure if I don‚Äôt like the mixing or just the beat itself. It‚Äôs just distracting, especially with swae‚Äôs vocals added in.

**racloves** (5): don‚Äôt really care about the feature tbh I just want cxh

**throwaway7650** (5): chloe and halle's vocals are nice as always but this is definitely the worst song on ungodly hour

**Uberpigeon** (5): its fine

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Such a drop in quality from the first half of the album...

**Vromega** (5): I dont like collabs. The music chemistry doesn't work here imo

**WhyDoIExistXD** (5): An abomination why does it exist

**oscarbrierley1** (4.5): it's fine ig but it doesn't fit on the album

**camerinian** (4): nothing personal against this song, it's just that most shitty New Zealand pop has this exact production style of bad plucked guitar and basic trap beat, so this just innately revolts me.

**engifear** (4): No men allowed

**hakkerj** (4): To me, this song is not on the album

**Itsafudgingstick** (4): Oh god I just don‚Äôt like this song lmao? I think part of it is that I‚Äôve never listened to Ungodly Hour except as an entire album in one sitting, and this track comes after a steady stream of perfect or near perfect tracks that it feels like such a letdown. It works as a palate cleanser for the backend of the album at least I guess.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Swae could have been left off tbh

**plastichaxan** (3.5): m*n ruining yet another song...we hate to see it

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): Swae Lee needs to read the title track and Catch Up to the girls because this track is a trainwreck with the complete lack of energy

**LostintheCosmicFire** (3): sorry, it's soo misplaced here

**sirpancakeXI** (3): swae lee's voice is just annoying to me at this point. i don't want to be rude but i don't see myself ever enjoying a song with him in, which sucks because chloe and halle did great here, but the feature just completely turned me off.

**steelstepladder** (3): why those tats do that

**Vultuxe** (3): Once again, there is nothing that holds my attention in this one.

**fenellabeach** (2.5): the features don't work for me

**pig-serpent** (2): I hate more or less everything MikeWill touches, so I was expecting this song to sound like total ass, but most of the production here is actually fine (I hate the drums but beside that) but Swae Lee is uncharacteristically annoying and everything about this song is just boring. Completely dreadful.

**joeeswift** (1): I do not enjoy swae's voice

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I downloaded the full album last year but deleted this song almost immediately, so I had basically forgotten it existed lol. Feels wrong to give my zero to my second favorite album in the rate but this sucks so bad I gotta speak my truth.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (0): fuck the person who made that weird Spotify art with Chloe and Halle tattooed on Swae Lee? Gives me weird misogyny, as if cXh didn‚Äôt save this mediocre song smh. Also it does not go with the rest of the album

**mudkip1** (0): they made this song for the str8s i'm sure of it
[/r/popheads/comments/nn3owd/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_1_my_therapist/gzsiezk/]

=====

Awkward_King: # MISOGYNISTS

**artzpop** (10): men's rights for this time and this time only

**fadedblue09** (10): I'm in shock that people hate this. The girls and Swae Lee ooze with chemistry. But it does sound like the most chart-friendly song on the album, which is why some people hate it I guess.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i know this song is in general one of the least favourite's on the album but i've always loved it

**Roxieloxie** (9.1): This is the worst song on the album, and its not even that bad. Its gonna go out day 1 cause of misandry but it shouldnt

**AHSWeeknd** (9): THAT BRIDGE

**ImADudeDuh** (9): doesn‚Äôt deserve to be the 5th song out, smh.

**izeaklapaucius** (9): naur it's trur swae lee made some points here

**ManofOranges** (9): Why is that everytime Swae Lee is on a song, it's so catchy?? Does he put crack in the melodies or sumn.

**TiltControls** (9): I actually really like this

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): i wanted to dislike this song more than i do, because CxH are so hypnotic by themselves and a guest would be a distraction. but swae lee's voice complements theirs perfectly

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): fuck it Swae Lee is great and so is this song, I don‚Äôt get why people don‚Äôt seem to like it

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this was easily my least favorite on the album at first but it grew on me a lot and it does bop

**kirby31200** (8.5): cha cha real smooth

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): overhated, I think Swae Lee never misses with collabs but CxH could absolutely sell this on their own, and I wouldn‚Äôt mind a solo version just for the serve of CxH carrying an album with no features

**1998tweety** (8): i know yall hate this but it actually bops

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): Grew a lot on me over the last year. I was a little baffled why this was put out as the first song off the record since literally any other song is better but oh well...

**akanewasright** (8): Fuck it. This is a bop. This was my first CXH song, and I stuck around after this.

**CarlieScion** (8): a MAN????? in this RATE?????

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): It slaps and I really like Swae Lee's voice.

**jsonphile** (8): a man??? In my ultimate subs faves rate???? Actually though this a bop too Swae Lee got a great voice but I worry about it getting the misandrist treatment

**NotWith10000Men** (8): "I have a future with shit to lose"

**salivantsonority** (8): Giving it an 8 because Chloe's vocals are stunning. Meh about the track itself.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I had this score much lower at first, but I feel like that was just because I was influenced by what others were saying. But the more I listen to it the more I reallise I actually really like it Swae Lee is great, the beat is really good and CxH are as good as ever.

**wavingwolves** (8): i feel like this will be bottom 5 just because it has a man but it will be undeservedly

**zagreux** (8): never liked swae lee but this was a fun bop

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.7): I feel like I like this song more then everyone else lmao. I feel admit it‚Äôs pretty lyrically poor compared to the rest of the album.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Good duet with good energy.

**runaway3212** (7.5): swae lee is the best part of this song

**SupremeShani** (7.5): Contrary to what people may think, I actually don't mind Swae Lee's presence here and feel like his voice is a nice contrast to Chloe and Halle. The song does feel like a leftover from a older project with a different vision at times though, and I'm not sure why as the production elements and harmonies aren't that different from the album.

**cashewconstellation** (7.3): the feature was really good, if not better than the girls

**astrologicalangel** (7): I wish I liked this more than I do

**cremeebrulee** (7): this is leaving first because of misandry‚Ä¶ yeah its a weird first single but it‚Äôs not completely irredeemable and chloe‚Äôs bridge is incredible.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This just kinda feels like a redux of ‚ÄúBusy Boy‚Äù

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Love the idea of these features, but it wasn't my favorite in practice. Sometimes I forget there are any features on this album gritted teeth emoji

**musical\_pyn** (7): I actually really like swae lee's part on this but the rest just doesn't stack up with the rest of the album

**shesdoingyoga** (7): One of the only songs in the rate with a man on it going out on day 1? Groundbreaking

**waluigiest** (7): the gorgeous bridge redeems it

**urfavgalpal** (6.9): like 60% of the time that I listen to this song I quite enjoy it and then like 40% of the time I don‚Äôt like it, but when I do enjoy it I really enjoy it.  There‚Äôs some fun back and forth here, but I overall I think Chloe and Halle shine best, at least on this album, when it‚Äôs just the two of them.  There are a lot of components for a good song here but it doesn‚Äôt always come together for me.  It also doesn‚Äôt help that in the scope of the album it comes right after what in my opinion is the best stretch of the album.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): A slightly over-hated song and Swae Lee isn't terrible on this one but definitely one of the weaker songs on the tracklisting.


**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): this song is hated on a bit too much. it's not that bad y'all

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): Yeah it‚Äôs not horrible by any means and I actually like Swae Lee‚Äôs voice with theirs, but it‚Äôs not quite on the level of the rest of the album

This is overhated! Yes I gave this a 2! Ignore that! This is overhated. This would undoubtedly fair much better if the original Click simply never existed, because it was never gonna live up to it's big sister's reputation. I'm a big hyperpop and glitchpop and bleepblooppop advocate, but I do have to admit this one at times is just industrial sounding noises and differently pitched voices saying the word click over one another.

# The sequels are always better

**ggal2020** (11): no song will ever capture the feeling of quarantine better than this. it‚Äôs a dance party in your room, it‚Äôs dreaming about being around strangers and not caring, it‚Äôs missing your best friends every day. also it felt pretty special when I was in a zoom with 40 other angels and charli came in to play us a snippet of this song before it came out. and! fun fact this is the second rate I‚Äôve given click an 11.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): clique

**bespectacIed** (10): This is indeed next level so legit

**bulforster** (10): the way every possible version of this song is a 10

**cremeebrulee** (10): people who hate this have no friends to miss

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): For those who don't get it, this is the sequel song to the fan-favorite track Click from the Charli album. Every time I go out with my friends late at night, Click plays in my head. That feeling that you are THE shit is something I never felt before and it was a glorious moment that boosted my confidence....until the pandemic happened. c2.0 definitely captured my feelings during quarantine when I cannot see my friends and I truly miss hanging out with them. I am so happy Charli did a follow-up song on Click that felt very timely during the first months of quarantine. It's definitely a track that evokes the feelings of missing going to the clubs with friends.

**iniekcja\_** (10): is it good because Click was good in 2019 or is it good because it's good? We shall never know

**nick1372** (10): I absolutely hated this at first but I listened closer and the lyrics really hit home for me. It‚Äôs been a year since I first heard this and I miss my friends just as fucking much

**Roxieloxie** (10): it could be the fact that im like extremely sad right now while im rating this album, but this is kinda hitting

**seanderlust** (10): the idea to take a song about having fun with your friends and sample it in a song about loneliness and isolation? talented brilliant amazing showstopping

**static\_int\_husp** (10): [hook] Clique (x96)

**welcome2thejam** (10): For some reason, my first time listening to this song was when the loneliness of the pandemic first really, well, clicked. So for better or worse, it's always gonna have that baggage. Good news is for now, it's a song that fucks me up in a good way. The build-up to and the moment of that first chorus coming in amidst the endless "clique clique clique" is incredible.

**fairytalehigh** (9.9): I MISS THEM I MISS THEM I MISS THEM ??

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): clique cliuqelc uqrlqkcurl cliurq cluiqlcliurlq cluirlq clique clkque clieuql clique clique clique

**bbfan132** (9.5): i love how dreamy/hazy the ending is

**camerinian** (9.5): actually had a mindblown moment on first listen of this. It's just so fun and so lovely

**amiriteor** (9.2): I MISS MY FRRIIIENENENNDNDNSDS

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): My favourite rendition of Click, I enjoy the idea of taking an already existing track, and reworking it for being stuck without your friends during the pandemic.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): A marked improvement over click and a brilliant continuation of the thematic ideas especially in combination with the rest of the track.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): I'll never forget when this album came out and somebody posted a snippet of this to IG with the caption "...y'all listen to this?" and started a whole ass war

**celladonn** (9): Makes me wish i had friends to miss

**conceptualromance** (9): damn I miss my friends too :/

**engifear** (9): clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique clique

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): recycle, reuse, and reducing queen

**Leixander** (9): This is better than Click tbh.

**ManofOranges** (9): A better version of click simply because it doesn't include that HORRENDOUS outro of the audio of a 10 car pile up.

**musical\_pyn** (9): c2.0 > c

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): took a while to click (pun not intended) but now ugh i love it

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): clique clique clique clique

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): ; I already the love other versions of Click so the reinterpretation of it is so good.

**hakkerj** (8.8): I've shaken my ass to this so many times it just reminds me of May of 2020 when my life was OK

**jman457** (8.6): Click just sounds good no matter what version it is

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): the distorted synth in the beginning is so grating that if it was playing throughout the whole song it would be a 0 for me. But then she goes fucking OFF. This would be a 10 if the track started at 1:19

**plastichaxan** (8.5): the urge not to just comment "clique clique clique clique clique clique" so i'm commenting this instead

**runaway3212** (8.5): so much better than Click

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): omg she's talking about how she misses her....... clique :(

**steelstepladder** (8.5): A fantastic companion to c1.0

**Palutzel** (8.3): click is a masterpiece, this remix is not as good, but it still delivers

**vagenda** (8.3): The concept of this is more appealing to me than the experience of listening to it. It has some great sections but there‚Äôs also like a solid minute where you‚Äôre convinced you‚Äôre gonna be hearing ‚Äúclicliclicliclicliclicliclicliclicliclic‚Äù for the rest of your life

**Alumineous** (8): I never want to hear "clique" AGAIN.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): The click Click CLICK part towards the end......is this what insanity feels like?

**ktajlili** (8): I get the hate because this is WEIRD. But it's also so fun and wholesome. I've never heard anything like it. It's a cool take on a classic Charli XCX song.

**Raxxin** (8): it clicks with me...

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Charli leaking the name of Grimes and Elon‚Äôs daughter

**SupremeShani** (8): If there's one thing I love about Charli, it's the way she pulls from and utilizes parts of her past discography for her shows and newer albums. The way she re-imagines Click here is so intriguing here, going from a guest-filled song filled with flashy bravado into a softer tune where she longs for her friends, her mind.

**juanolsen** (7.8): as someone who has never heard the original version of click this was a cute little surprise for me, i think it's good but pales in comparison to the rest of the album
[/r/popheads/comments/nn3owd/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_1_my_therapist/gzsje7c/]

=====

Awkward_King: **UselessTacooo** (7.8): probably the worst song here but still amazing

**geraldinewww** (7.6): i just rated this higher for the bass in the bridge

**liberalitea** (7.5): this is if track 10 > bioyl was done correctly

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.2): Not something I‚Äôd listen to on its own, but I think it‚Äôs a necessary transition between IFU and P4U on the album. Flipping a posse cut from Pop2 is a cute wink to her past discography, and strengthens the themes of pandemic isolation. You can tell that Charli is a person who thrives off socializing and bouncing ideas off her besties, and now she has to cope the best she can with being unable to do that, so of course she's nostalgic.

**afs** (7): Autotune, noise AND higher pitch...? Considered skipping until finding out the song really starts after gwegwegwegwegwegwegwe-

**fadedblue09** (7): Why make a sequel to one of your worst songs. At least there are no terrible features to drag this down. I do love the second half though, especially with how she expresses her longing for social life.

**jasannn** (7): The blame it on your love-ification of Click but its actually ok.

Electric Poo-galoo

**nootnoot781** (8.5): well‚Ä¶ the sequel is rarely better than the original

**EnCaine** (7.5): i like the original more overall but this is still interesting. second half is definitely better than the first

**targetguest** (7.5): the original and its remix are better

**urfavgalpal** (7.3): this is a ‚Äúgood in the context of the album‚Äù song that suffers from being a downgrade of a great song.  I think there is some great meta-ness to it and it captures the loneliness of quarantine so well but I think it has a limited shelf-life since its impact comes primarily from the context and I would also not ever pick it over Click to listen to unless I was feeling particularly lonely.  It‚Äôs a fun little tune though.

**cashewconstellation** (7): interesting but inferior to the original

**Itsafudgingstick** (7): It almost feels wrong in a way to call this Click‚Äôs chaotic little sibling just because Click is already so damn chaotic? But this song is quite possibly Charli at her most hyperpop. Also, ‚ÄúClick (x96)‚Äù is such a moving set of lyrics :‚Äô) But much like how Pink Diamond is a loose sequel to ‚ÄúNext Level Charli‚Äù, ‚ÄúC2.0‚Äù is a direct sequel to Click, and idk, it‚Äôs a nice tie-in of HIFN to Charli‚Äôs previous discography

**mudkip1** (7): ends well but the start's a little too much for me

**nooodisaster** (7): When we get to the lyrics, they're great, but it takes almost half the way through the song.

**pig-serpent** (7): I love Click, especially the 50 gecs outro, and having it incorporated to the full song instead of being a tacked on ending is really cool. Unfortunately, I don't love this as much as I feel like I should because it takes a little too long for the song to really get started with the verse kicking in halfway through the song, and I don't think the instrumental for the 2nd half is anywhere near the quality of the first half.

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): LICK LICK LICK LICK LICK LICK LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE CLIQUE CLIQUE CLIQUE CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK

**salivantsonority** (7): This one makes me miss SOPHIE. Not terribly great though.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): not as good as the original but it definitely still has its qualities

**CarlieScion** (6.5): this is like when my brain short circuits

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): a better remake of a previous single than Blame It On Your Love was‚Ä¶ i wanna defend this more strongly bc there are good sections here but its hard to go to bat for that second minute

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i anticipated this being a lot worse so... points for that!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): this would be higher if the first half of the song didn't exist. sorry!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is pretty good but tbh I would rather listen to the original Click.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): i thought I was gonna give this a nine or ten but then the word clique started and never ended. The comments said this was a remix about her friend to about missing her friend (bc pandemic) and that‚Äôs very sweet and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a six.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is the kind of thing I‚Äôd find buried deep in Bandcamp but like, she doesn‚Äôt have the excuse of being anonymous and having no budget‚Ä¶ not the worst song though, would be higher if the intro wasn‚Äôt so pointlessly long

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I remember really liking this one. It was literally my favorite track. I don't hate it now; actually, I still like it a lot, but the other songs are way better, so I had to lower my score.

**J\_Toe** (6): not the biggest fan of click, and not the biggest fan of C2.0

**LostintheCosmicFire** (6): baby voices are a no

**poptartchill** (6): I think this might be a fan favorite? It's not a favorite of mine though sorry. I know it's the point but I would like it more without the "click" part

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Not quite as good as the original Click imo, but I like the emotional take on it, and it benefits from no Kim Petras :)

**vayyiqra** (6): Eh. I'm not big on the original "Click". It's cute, but (unpopular take) I don't get the hype over the abrasive noisy outro. This is okay, but adding distortion to stuff doesn't always make it better. I would like it a lot more with cleaner production.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I‚Äôm not that familiar with the OG Clique so I‚Äôm judging this song on it‚Äôs own‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs ok, but the intro takes up too much of the song‚Äôs length

**notarobot3675** (5.5): love a throwback but it feels almost like... a really long interlude?

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): Love the second half of this but the first half is a bit much even for me

**throwaway7650** (5.5): initial section of the song is unbearable for me, thankfully the song gets better as it plays. anyway stream the no boys remix

**astrologicalangel** (5): I like the message but unfortunately the song isn't doing it for me

**eeveefan01** (5): I ask myself everyday if this song actually has to exist.

**racloves** (5): I love click and the no boys remix so was like omg a third version of a song I love but it was kinda a let down to me tbh. I do miss my friends tho

**rosecoloreds** (5): one question - why?

**shhhneak** (5): ugh the first half of this song is SO annoying but the second is perfect. It‚Äôs called C2.0 because of duality. Her mind.

**Uberpigeon** (5): It didn't click with me

**wasian-invasion** (5): this one hurt my ears. i didn‚Äôt even mind the original click's pure noise but it was saved at the end so you could just skip if needed but this just overpowers every other aspect of the first half of the song. the second half is the only reason this isn't my 0

**1998tweety** (4): usually the 2nd version is supposed to be an upgrade, so what happened here? it gets good after the intro though

**jayjaysortagay** (4): why does this exist

**Oberionsynth** (4): maybe hyperpop isn't my thing

**rickikardashian** (4): imagine how tired we are

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): yeah .... this is not it. I was already done with the song before we even hit the halfway point (not even Charli‚Äôs verses could not save this even though it was better).

**akanewasright** (3): ...I don‚Äôt skip this on the album but I would never listen to it alone or anything

**CritneySpearz** (3): I usually like her repetitiveness but this is annoying for some reason

**KennyEarthman** (3): thanks to the genius page for telling me that there were 96 cliques in a row

**ReallyCreative** (3): she said "I sound like an operating system, so why not inherit the branding too?"

**Vultuxe** (3): It's intolerably noisy, too far on the hyperpop pendulum for my tastes. I actually do like the structure of the song if the production just wasn't so annoying.

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): Retroactively cancelling out the 9 I regret giving to Click. ??

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): i never want to hear the word clique again

**TiltControls** (2): well it was either the 2 or the 0. And I already gave it the 0 last time soooo

**waluigiest** (2): OG click is a fine song and this is much worse im sorry. any analysis ive seen of the lyrics has been soooo fake deep

**wavingwolves** (2): turning a song that's a 10 into a 2? that's talent baby

**letsallpoo** (1): im not gay enough for this

**bookthieving** (0): it's right there in the song title! stream no boys remix instead

**CrimsonROSET** (0): i‚Äôm going insane, there are flames- flames, on the side of my face, and they all click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**frogaranaman** (0): lmao girl wtf

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I‚Äôm sorry but wow it was terrible to get through the first part of this song. I listened to it, but the other half was meh but I hope to never listen to this song ever again. Clique was also the worst song on the last charli album we rated so at least she‚Äôs consistent.

**NFLfreak98** (0): Did she record this on microphones or just like a series of blenders?

**NotWith10000Men** (0): christ alive this is terrible. Enough with the chipmunk voice. What the fuck is that repetitive part in the middle that goes on and on and on and on and on and we didn't start the fire???

**oscarbrierley1** (0): this song gave me a migraine, the second half is fine but didnt make up for the pain of the start

**sirpancakeXI** (0): i adore this album but i can never get through this song, the intro is just too bad.

**skargardin** (0): I like repetition, I'm a fan of R√≥is√≠n Murphy, but this? this is not it

**Turpamutteri** (0): what the hell is this

# Knows the difference between arteries and veins

**bespectacIed** (10): It's gorgeous. I wish this was on the main album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the best song on the album.

**conceptualromance** (10): the production is really beautiful <3 Feels less busy and more spacious than a lot of the other songs on here.

**fadedblue09** (10): The one song everyone hates is somehow my favorite lol. I just love this, it's like the perfect waltzy slow-dance number, and one of the few times Carly showed emotion in this otherwise emotionless record.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I still say this should‚Äôve been the opener or closer for Dedicated

**nick1372** (10): love love love Carly when she gets slow and sensual

**notarobot3675** (10): another song that is just... peak romance. carly really does know how to make pop that just... perfectly embodies the feelings a good romcom gives you.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't care this is one of her best ballads

**TiltControls** (10): I'm not ready for the balladphobia cause this is gorgeous

**waluigiest** (10): idc this song is beautiful. It‚Äôs an introspective, ballad take on Too Much

**anothertown** (9.5): there are a lot of sounds going on here and they‚Äôre all great

**shhhneak** (9.5): God I love that bridge.

**engifear** (9): This is such a gorgeous song, but I'm afraid about how it will do because I don't trust y'all balladphobes out there

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Ballodphobia better be kind to this one, it‚Äôs so soft and pillowy

**hakkerj** (9): All That 2.0

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I love the weird stuff happening in the background (I'm no music expert). It is fascinating how it works on a track so soothing and calm like this one. Also, not Carly using an actual heartbeat on a track titled Heartbeat. Now I'll take a break to listen to Wildest Dreams.

**musical\_pyn** (9): such a cathartic and warm song

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This one is going to be robbed, she‚Äôs cute

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): feels like a hug

**bbfan132** (8.5): love the hazy production, gives me 80s vibes

**seanderlust** (8.5): there's nothing quite like hooking up/dating someone who's really great and having that moment where you're like "oh wow...I am TRASH."

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): All That's cute little sister

**vagenda** (8.5): It kind of stops the momentum of the album dead in its tracks but taken in isolation, for what it is, it‚Äôs honestly a really nice ballad

**juanolsen** (8.3): a really good laid back track, i like how it reminds me of all that

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): woo-hoo-HOO, woo-HOO-HOO, WOO-HOO-HOO

**jman457** (8.1): a very beautiful slow jam

**Alumineous** (8): Serves the same function as Chosen Family on SAWAYAMA. It's a good break from all the dancing in the first 5 tracks.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is good so I am giving it an 8. But I have a feeling that this song will grow on me that I should have given this a 9 instead. But 8 is a score that I am confident giving right now.

**Leixander** (8): Unfortunate placement in the album, sandwiched between two of Carly's best songs ever.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): This is a REALLY cute, delicate track that is absolutely going to get robbed

**SupremeShani** (8): There's a part of me that has a soft spot for Carly's synth ballads, like All That and No Drug Like Me. All fundamentally different songs, but I think her sweet voice always pairs with those more subdued electronic sounds just activates some happiness in my brain.

**throwaway7650** (8): another good chorus... carly is so good at them. this song is super calming and ironically feels like it could help slow down heartbeats lol

**vayyiqra** (8): Maybe hot take but Carly's ballads are highly underrated and have some of her best songs.

**cashewconstellation** (7.9): i'm not usually a fan of slow songs but this one is quite good and is also very relatable for me "i don't wanna tell you anything about me" go off carly

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): the bridge kind of saves it from becoming just a correct ballad

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Really nice lyrically, it's a gay vibe

**Palutzel** (7.5): slow bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): the All That of Dedicated era

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.1): For a song about speeding up heartbeats this is pretty snoozy, but I still like low-key Carly

**afs** (7): I'm not into ballads but this has got a lot of interesting elements in it.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): That weird drum heartbeat in the bridge is what makes this good.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Omg Carly don't make me cry when I want to bop

**salivantsonority** (7): Bit maudlin but I'm not mad at it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): aww this is sweet!

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): balladphobia will make this a Day 1 song

Awkward_King: # Flatlining

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I wish we‚Äôd speed up the song a little bit

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): Too slow for me but sweet.

**Vultuxe** (7): Not my favorite of her ballads but it's not bad. There are quirks in the production I enjoy and I return to this song every now and again.

**just\_thonking** (6.5): This'll probably be the first song out, and tbh it might deserve it

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): I like the high-pitched vocalizations in the second verse and chorus but the rest is pretty boring

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The space in this song with the lush clicking, psychedelic synths, and 1950s Disney Harmonies that poke their head around are doing wonders for this song. Ultimately I think Carly is the weak link here though.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): It's pretty enough, sure, but a little bit boring

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): eh kinda drags until the bridge

**akanewasright** (6): I think the song is cute but the melody is so close to the melody of Garden by Dua Lipa. That song isn‚Äôt exactly great either, so like... why did she feel the need to rip that off? I like the bridge though, and the production is really cool throughout the song

**geraldinewww** (6): yes i am a ballad hater sorry

**jasannn** (6): This is no "All That", but its an okay ballad.

**nootnoot781** (6): i felt bad if i gave this an even lower score, but it‚Äôs just drags on for too long. there is no reason why this should be 4 minutes when want you in my room is only 2:46

**runaway3212** (6): the weakest track here

**Stryxen** (6): is it flatlining??

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Heartbeat by Carly <<< Heartbeat by Annie, stream Dark Hearts!!!

**wavingwolves** (5.9): it's just... there

**liberalitea** (5.5): this was boring but the chorus & bridge are nice

**urfavgalpal** (5.2): Look I mean this is pretty and I really like the backing vocals she does but I‚Äôm not as big a fan of her slow songs and I think this is a tad boring.

**EnCaine** (5): it's cute enough ig. i just feel like i really need to be blown away by a ballad melodically or lyrically to like one

**hikkaru** (5): snooze

**hunnybee12** (5): I thi-??

**ignitethephoenix** (5): For a song called heartbeat, it‚Äôs pretty lifeless

**ManofOranges** (5): Is she talking about a baby in the womb or sumn.

**plastichaxan** (5): how i'm sleeping now

**steelstepladder** (5): I don't remember this many ballads on first listen... huh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): more like slowing down my heartbeat because im fucking asleep

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): kinda goes nowhere for 3 minutes but the last minute saves it at least a bit

**welcometoNY** (5): sorry but this is literally just a worse version of favourite color

**CarlieScion** (4): this is the only song I dislike on this album

**Oberionsynth** (4): carly out here releasing the cure to my insomnia, got a full 8 hours of sleep after this one started, thx bestie :*

**pat-rickstar** (4): I sleep

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this just like doesn't do... anything

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): I am really not a fan of when Carly goes full ballad on softer songs, this is definitely one of the worst ones; sorry Carly you're really not meant to do these kind of really heartfelt, slow-jam songs at all...

**bulforster** (3): barely a song

**frogaranaman** (3): this is so boring sorry

**Itsafudgingstick** (3): Maybe putting an album of B-sides against fully fledged albums wasn‚Äôt the fairest fight‚Ä¶

**KennyEarthman** (3): "I was busy sleeping" describes this song perfectly

**Brendon-Urine** (2): yyyeeeaaaahhhh this is a big fat miss. sorry Carly. just thankful this didn't make the Dedicated cut.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): I played this in my car the first time I listened and the noises in the beat made me think my damn car was breaking down

**cremeebrulee** (0): i didn‚Äôt plan on giving carly my 0 but this genuinely bored me so much. like, i actually felt like my time was being wasted listening to this

**jayjaysortagay** (0): what is this, maybe there's a reason some of this stuff wasn't on Side A

Tina Taught Me not to fuck with interludes I'm sorry

---

# Me before this rate started

**Alumineous** (10): Interlude? Interlude.

**conceptualromance** (10): so true besties ??

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): jesus this song is beautiful from top to bottom. i don't think i had listened to it as much before doing this rate, and it's just so lovely. the harmonies, the piano, the lyrics. it embodies anxiety and those feelings so well. beautiful transition into lonely as well!

**rickikardashian** (10): interlude solidarity

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love how this album was like horny bangers and then out of nowhere they we're like 'now lets work on you' like what the fuck i forgot this song existed and now im crying

**seanderlust** (10): so pretty

**SupremeShani** (10): Please Popheads, do not let your interludephobia disrespect this gorgeous tidbit.

**throwaway7650** (10): this will go out early and it shouldn't

**waluigiest** (10): I swear I sing the escalating ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do well under pressure‚Äù to myself several times a week

**xaviersi** (10): sooooo many layers of harmonies for an interlude

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): love how dark this is compared to the rest of the album.

**juanolsen** (9.3): i loved how they really went into an instrospective and emotional mood with this song, the lyrics are really good and of course the vocals and production are in point

**geraldinewww** (9.2): anyone play this flash game called auditorium?

**bookthieving** (9): this does not deserve the interludephobia and balladphobia that it will face

**engifear** (9): I wish it was longer, the harmonies are so gorgeous

**LostintheCosmicFire** (9): WHY DOES THIS FEEL LIKE A FULL SONG LOL

**notarobot3675** (9): gorgeous interlude! that harmonising is something else

**runaway3212** (9): cute

**SmileAndTears** (8.9): bye... (third) best song on the album and it's barely even a song

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): can someone help me find my soul, it left my body 4 tracks ago and I think it would really like this song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This is way prettier than a short interlude has any right to be

**jman457** (8.6): A very beautiful slow ethereal song, just wish it was longer

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Very angelic, lyrics definitely hit a lot given last year

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): it‚Äôs so pretty but so short, why must they hurt me like this ????????

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This better not go out day 1 just because it is short, this is better than some artists‚Äô entire discography

**afs** (8): I knew CxHxPiano was gonna come at some point, and as expected it's angelic. Ends too soon, but that's how interludes are.

**cremeebrulee** (8): chloe x halle  rina: making interludes that shouldve been full songs

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): this is basically an interlude for lonely in my eyes. I like it a lot though lyrically and I love the layering.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I think this works well as an individual track because their impressive vocals mean that they can give it a vibe beyond just being an intro to ‚ÄúLonely‚Äù and the solo piano backing makes it unique on the album

**ignitethephoenix** (8): gorgeous and relatable but yep it‚Äôs an interlude so it doesn‚Äôt really compare to the rest of the album

**jsonphile** (8): it‚Äôs so short but actually so nice to listen to

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): Gorgeous interlude expressing a very early 20s sentiment.....by their late 20s they'll be ready to add a Fuck This World (Interlude)

**musical\_pyn** (8): the harmonies here are so tight

**nick1372** (8): for what is essentially an interlude this is fairly ambitious! I think it really accomplishes the mood it set out to make

**Oberionsynth** (8): why do artists keep making great songs less than a minute long, girl i'm tryna get my bussy bopping here and with my old soul it takes a couple minutes just to stand up

**pig-serpent** (8): This is glorious! Why isn't this a full song?

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a pretty good lead-in to Lonely but doesn't really wow me

**Vultuxe** (8): I actually liked this interlude, but I wish it was attached to Lonely. Would have made Lonely a much better song.

**zagreux** (8): the ad-libs or whatever here, whew girl

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): yeah me too

**EnCaine** (7.5): i promised myself i would not be overly interludephobic. this sounds good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): Very pretty and soothing, my super valid complaint is that it‚Äôs too short! Even for an interlude, it doesn‚Äôt have a real conclusion or breathing space at the end. Just as you start to get into it, it‚Äôs over.

**1998tweety** (7): reminds me of kali uchis, we didnt need to rate this but its nice tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Vocal excellence but interludephobia exists

**akanewasright** (7): Cute little interlude. Won‚Äôt be interludephobic because it is fantastically done

**bigbigbee** (7): I love this but wish it were longer. I think there‚Äôs an amazing musical idea here and I would love to hear it as a full song.

**camerinian** (7): I love Kali Uchis

**cashewconstellation** (7): I can't really rate this cause I didn't even notice it went by and it was so short

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ok but make it longer

**KennyEarthman** (7): a nice breather on the album

**ktajlili** (7): Cute, short interlude that transitions into the more serious songs of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (7): so pretty, it doesn't deserve the thrashing it's gonna get

**Qustomar** (7): me preparing for finals rn

**salivantsonority** (7): Pretty but unspectacular.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): A great song that suffers from just being an interlude. If it was a full song it would be an album highlight

**Uberpigeon** (7): this is a cute interlude dont give it zeros let cxh remain zeroless!!

**wasian-invasion** (7): cute little interlude

**wavingwolves** (7): floating hedgehog emote

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): sounds amazing vocally, but my interludephobia is coming out because this is too short

**amiriteor** (6.5): like its a chloe x halle song idk, extra .5 bc I'm a sucker for those choral harmonies

**bbfan132** (6.5): doesn‚Äôt really feel like a song

**poptartchill** (6.5): not sure if this counts as "popheads hates ballads" but I respect this song, it just has less relisten value since it's short

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): cute interlude

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. Your data, my data, the chromosomes match. Exact as in matter, a matter of fact. These amaranth feelings - a cognitive state. Need the love object to reciprocate. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. A chemical reason, if reason's your game. A chemical needing is there in the brain. With pre-programmed meanings, like a little more pep. Alien feelings we have to accept. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. When I think that I'm over you, I'm overpowered. It's long overdue, I'm overpowered. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. As science struggles on to try to explain, oxytocins flowing ever into my brain. I'm overpowered.

**nooodisaster** (5): Cute lil interlude

# Me during this rate

**hakkerj** (6): I didn't know how to rate song

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): Unfortunately I can only rate this song so high because it is a short interlude, but it is very purdy

**ManofOranges** (6): Me everyday.

**Palutzel** (6): more of an interlude than a song

**pheromenos** (6): i'm interludephobic

**racloves** (6): too short

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I don't know how to rate this its too short

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Can't believe I'm being inteludephobic

**vayyiqra** (6): Too short to truly rate but: same

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): A pretty interlude but an interlude nonetheless.

**frogaranaman** (5): interludephobia

**liberalitea** (5): it's great for what it is but i can't give it any higher than a 5

**martian\_pet** (5): Underwhelming

**Stryxen** (5): me when i have to do a single task in a day

**urfavgalpal** (5): honestly the score feels a too low for it because I think it‚Äôs a great interlude but it doesn‚Äôt really work as a stand-alone and should probably rank lower than most of the other songs in this rate

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): An interlude that I really could do without, it really could do with a proper ballad here to cool down here instead of like a 52 second strange intermission that sounds unfinished.

**NecroDolphinn** (4): its fine, but its literally just an interlude

Ah yes, my obligatory bad take of the rate. I was very tempted to give this my 11 over XS, anthems or ROYL, which were all very strong options for me, as this is far and away my favourite Carly song in the rate and honestly one of my favourite songs in the rate overall. I don't know what it is, because I wouldn't exactly but faux-tropical music on a list of genres that I seek out, but I think the melodies of it are just really pretty to me and it feels really transportive! The "love on the beach and the tide is high" is so on the nose but so effective, the whole song is very literal in its presentation, its a beachy song with extremely obvious tides and beach sounds in the background, but idk, it just works for me.

---

# Grimes stans

**IIIHenryIII** (11): Ok, I gotta be honest, TLIC is my favorite, but this is my second favorite for sure. I'm just giving it my 11 to give it the appreciation it deserves. I mean, did you really listen to this track if you hated it? Listening to this makes me feel like I'm levitating on a fluffy cloud that is actually a boat drifting away in the ocean near the coast of California, but I'm actually a straight merman swimming with Ariel and exploring the vastness of unknown, magical waters. Help me, I'm drowning in this sound! Perfect album closer!

**Vromega** (11): instantly fell in love with this song when I first heard this album. I still remember this exact moment I closed this album for the first time, during quarantine. This song quickly became one of my fave of 2020. The dropplets are so pleasing. I don't think I still have this strange feeling of "ascending" "flying" while listening to this song now. I also realize now this is far from being her best in terms of vocals but it still deserves my 11 for everything this song brought me last year <3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This‚Äôll probably be one of the first songs out but it‚Äôs an exotica inspired gem. Love it.

**akanewasright** (10): This isn‚Äôt even my type of music but it‚Äôs just... so nice....

**conceptualromance** (10): cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôm from California‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt say I relate. But I love how dreamy this is, it‚Äôs the perfect closer to the album because it makes you feel like you‚Äôre just drifting away‚Ä¶

**kappyko** (10): vacation bible school bop

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): Best song of the Dedicated era. Not a typical Carly bop, but has me feeling like I'm sitting on the beach relaxing when I've actually been in my garden-level apartment, having not seen the sun for 13 months

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't believe her!

**mudkip1** (10): an amazing bop idgaf what anyone else says

**poptartchill** (10): it has Christmas vibes for some reason but I love it

**waluigiest** (10): obligated to give it a 10 because of how I deeply relate to every lyric oops

**welcometoNY** (10): I already know some of y'all are going to do this song dirty, and if that applies to you, yes you are a bad person and you should feel bad

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.9): so overhated

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): Me when LA Hallucinations comes on.

**TiltControls** (9.5): groovy

**savemeaseat143** (9.4): I like sound effects

**fenellabeach** (9.1): I don't hate how long this song is

**hunnybee12** (9): I listen to After School by Weeekly on repeat a lot and to find it I usually search ‚Äúafter‚Äù in my liked songs, and so then this song plays immediately after everytime. after it playing dozens of times I started to actually like it even though I forgot it existed before that. I guess that‚Äôs my review for side b, it‚Äôs enjoyable when it comes on but it will never be After School by Weeekly

**juanolsen** (9): nice surprise at the end of the album

**ktajlili** (9): I think this was left off the original album because it's not a dancy but it 100% deserves to be there.

**musical\_pyn** (9): this has grown on me so much, I love the hook and production

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): this song is flawed for sure and I won't be mad if it makes an early exit but I do love it, it's so calming and fun

**vagenda** (8.6): A great addition to the ‚ÄúCanadian singers realizing the golden state isn‚Äôt as terrible as they originally thought‚Äù canon, right next to Allie X‚Äôs Not So Bad in LA

**bbfan132** (8.5): relaxing outro, i like the aquatic sound of the production

**bigbigbee** (8.5): east coast beast coast but this song is cute and fun

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): ties with "warm blood" for carly's most 420-friendly bop

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the most interesting song on the album by a LANDSLIDE.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.3): This is basically L.A. Hallucinations' older, more mature sister. What a great song to close this album.

**Dekubaku** (8.1): A sweet airy ending befitting the mood of the album.

**EnCaine** (8): is this california's folklore era

**engifear** (8): This is such a good summery song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Carly said cali was the mission ??

**jasannn** (8): Cheesy but atmospheric.

**just\_thonking** (8): I feel like this will be a controversial one... In my opinion it does it exactly what it sets out to do and it's a fun, relaxing listen

**seanderlust** (8): me deciding that despite her marrying elon, grimes' discog is still pretty good

**vayyiqra** (8): cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I actually really like this‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs strange and different, but in a sea (heh) of 6s and 7s this is a welcome surprise!

**Vultuxe** (8): People are going to love or hate this one, but I think it's nice. Not flawless but despite it's length I enjoy letting it play all the way through.

**wasian-invasion** (8): dancing day-drunk by the pool at a cheap palm springs motel vibes

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): Tropical legend

**zagreux** (8): Now I Don't Hate Now I Don't Hate California After All After All

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): from LA Hallucinations to Now I Don‚Äôt Hate California After All‚Ä¶. this is character development

**cashewconstellation** (7.8): is it a bop? no. but it's pretty enjoyable, even if you have to be in the right mood for it. wait actually i reached the third minute mark and it might actually be a bop

**jman457** (7.6): It really feels like a surreal dream between utopia and dystopia

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): she‚Äôs cute [2]

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Good for you

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I love spongebob music (no but it seriously reminds me of bikini bottom/the beach)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.3): A cute relaxing summer bop

**shhhneak** (7.1): My brain has rotted in the last year so this kind of sounds like a Blessed Madonna song now‚Ä¶

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): A shimmery summery end to a pretty okay record, it's a cool track but I

**afs** (7): I was seriously worried she was going to try hip-hop during the intro, but thankfully she was actually going for a beachy vibe.

**amiriteor** (7): i like madonna

**thegraygh0st** (7): this song gets too much hate its cute! like if spongebob and sandy were in la la land

**wavingwolves** (6.9): this is cute as hell and i have a soft spot for songs mentioning ocean/waves/sea/water soooo

**SupremeShani** (7): I was a bit disappointed in the song after such a fascinating title, but it's still not bad at all. I love those sparkling synths and the underwater feeling here, just wish the lyrics hit harder.

Awkward_King: # Fuck California all my homies hate California

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): eh

**CarlieScion** (7): kinda weak closer

**cremeebrulee** (7): this dropped when i had just moved to california and fucking hated it sm so i literally can‚Äôt relate. fine song tho

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I hate the intro so much...

**fadedblue09** (7): Cute Christmas music. But y'know I could just stream her Last Christmas cover instead.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i can‚Äôt believe this is the best closer out of all these albums and i feel generous with my 7

**Leixander** (7): the intro is both jarring and cute, i still don't know what to think of it

**Oberionsynth** (7): perfect for a nighttime vibe session (aka ignoring my homework)

**racloves** (7): when you‚Äôve listened to ‚Äònot so bad in LA‚Äô by Allie X too many times but want a song with the same message

**1998tweety** (6.5): i like the beachy vibes but theres something missing here

**Palutzel** (6.5): now i don't hate this song, I just don't like it

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The ocean waviness of it makes it stand out from the rest of the album, but I don't think she pulls off the vibe as well as someone like Lana Del Ray could.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): an interesting closer choice... not sure if i truly like it but it's interesting

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): This is SUCH a different sound for Carly, and whilst I don't hate it, it's not really that captivating to me

**CrimsonROSET** (6): well I do and you can‚Äôt tell me how to feel carly

**hikkaru** (6): buzzfeed buzzards and tmz crows

**runaway3212** (6): the instrumentals are so pretty but I hate the lyrics and her melodies

**salivantsonority** (6): This one could've stayed in the drafts. There's some nice vocal moments but generally eh. Needs to be edited down. No business being that long.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): interesting production so i'll give it some credit for that

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Probably her weakest closer since Kiss, imo. It‚Äôs not bad at all but a little meh

**liberalitea** (5.5): i mean it's okay but compared to her other closers, this falls very flat

**nick1372** (5.5): kinda lacks the energy and authenticity of the best Carly tracks

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): kinda boring

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): Pretty forgettable

**Alumineous** (5): Not as much as Baby Girl, but this could be a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon track too! Anyway, the intro sounded like it was going to give me something good, but it didn't.

**frogaranaman** (4): just a really boring way to close out the project to me

**camerinian** (3.5): Jesus imagine how strongly this could have finished on Solo. This is the most b-side of the whole collection, and I do mean that as a drag

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): The simplicity of the opening melody is so simple and derivative it is legitimately insulting. The rest of the song is alright ig.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): WHY IS THIS FIVE MINUTES LONG???

**geraldinewww** (3): i debated giving this my zero but instead decided to give no zeros. definitely the worst song in the rate by far. it's so.... it makes me want to be at the beach but in a bad way

**jayjaysortagay** (3): Alexa, Google "candy pop style beat YouTube copyright free"

**bulforster** (2): There's no reason for this to be the longest song on the album.

**KennyEarthman** (2): made me hate California

**urfavgalpal** (2): I‚Äôm sorry to Carly but I think this is my least favorite song in the rate and its probably the only one that never gets stuck in my head.  Thematically speaking I appreciate the nod to LA Hallucinations but I think the intro is disjointed and sounds like when I was taking piano lessons and I learned a scale right and played around and was like ‚ÄúI made a song!‚Äù because I did an arpeggio or whatever but it‚Äôs not really enjoyable to listen to.  And then it switches to a different melody and I guess it‚Äôs like chill if you want a playlist of songs for like reading to because you don‚Äôt want to be distracted by it at all but to me there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a melody here and it never really goes anywhere which is really a shame because I think the strength of this album is in its melodies.

**Brendon-Urine** (0): I just wanna know what happened in the studio that lead to this song being created... even for a B sides album this sounds awful. Sounds like it belongs on a cheap CA tourism ad from 3 decades ago. Still love u tho Carly! This just isn't it.

**eeveefan01** (0): idk but this song isn‚Äôt it. I appreciate the vibe though <3

**joeeswift** (0): I prefer the 2 songs where she hated California

**NecroDolphinn** (0): This song is probably my least favorite Carly song and this song makes me hate California (after all)

**Tedyonce** (0): I normally love slow songs I swear, I‚Äôm a sad bitch

God I did *not* expect this song to be as hated as it was haha, I always enjoyed this as a weird blend between 2000s electropop and r&b somehow with a kind of unsettling melodic twist? Not quite sure exactly how to put it, but it works for me. It's not incredible, but I think it works. Many of you however, evidently, did not LMAO.

---

# We irritating

**1998tweety** (10): i love britney

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): should have been in the main rate 3 AND THAT LAST MINUTE,I'M A SLUT FOR MULTIPLE VOICES AND THAT DISTORTION WHAT

**pheromenos** (10): rina never misses honestly

**plastichaxan** (10): these bonus tracks being better than love me 4 me (except for lucid)

**KennyEarthman** (9): the production went ham on this one... maybe a little too ham

**notarobot3675** (9): this is another song that really hypes me up

**throwaway7650** (9): the best new/original song on the deluxe :noitstrue:

**urfavgalpal** (8.6): I think this is my favorite of the bonus tracks?  Feels the most at home on the album

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is low-key giving me Jenny from the Block teas.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Yes I‚Äôm giving this a higher score than STFU or Snakeskin, no I would not replace either of those with this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): Reminds me of some of her EP tracks, I like it a lot

**afs** (8): Lots of MJ in the verses there. And it's so aggressive wow.

**amiriteor** (8): amigas...cheetahs...friends for life. only an 8 bc i HATE the beginning and the end and the title

**bigbigbee** (8): I like this a lot. I think it‚Äôs more successful at the 00s Max Martin sound than Love Me 4 Me is.

**musical\_pyn** (8): I was not expecting this to be as good as it is! Could've been on the main album

**Oberionsynth** (8): ugh I love her 2000s vibes music, esp when it's about being gay

**poptartchill** (8): LOVE the end! Overall sounds more like RINA than SAWAYAMA

**SupremeShani** (8): we love a 2000s pop music revival, unfortunately xs does this sound much better, but we still out here

**fairytalehigh** (7.8): kinda reminds me alunageorge ?? also kinda reminds me of alunageorge covering "this is how we do it" ??

**jasannn** (7.5): I get why it's a bonus track but it still fits the nu-metal pop sound she is going for and the track gets better as it progresses, especially with that key change.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The only good Rina bonus track. Justice for her Love It If We Made It and Dance In The Dark covers

**iniekcja\_** (7): the message is good!! (the mix is bad)

**runaway3212** (7): I get why it was cut, but it's fun

**jman457** (6.8): like the techno/rock inspo but not really anything that justifies being on the album.

**bbfan132** (6.5): not on the album for a reason, although it‚Äôs not bad

**EnCaine** (6.5): i like parts of this

# This song irritating

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This sounds so unfinished

**frogaranaman** (6): if rating these deluxe / bonus tracks have told me anything it‚Äôs that these tracks usually stay as ‚Äòbonuses‚Äô for a reason

**vayyiqra** (6): Well, this is a song that exists. I would like it more if the chorus weren't so unwritten. Also, the bridge is weak. (Fully aware of the irony I just gave "Lucid" a 10 when it has a fucking instrumental drop as the chorus.)

**waluigiest** (6): she knew which songs to cut from the standard album

**Alumineous** (5): Heavy 90s/2000s vibes. I'm gonna call it a meh. Would never play it again. It's just a little too on the nose, which makes it sorta tacky and uninspired.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Glad this wasn‚Äôt on the actual album

**Vultuxe** (5): I guess I'm tired but I keep replaying it and then forgetting it and not knowing what to score so it's a 5

**wavingwolves** (4.9): i'm glad this isn't actually on the album tbh

**nick1372** (4.5): ‚Äúwe out here‚Äù is already dated rina and you‚Äôre not helping it by repeating it over and over again and surrounding it by vague corny lyrics

**Brendon-Urine** (4): this is... uhhhhh interesting i guess?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): I like the vocal layering on this but this song really feels like a half baked Britney/Xtina loose, not like a Rina song

**pig-serpent** (4): I have so many conflicting thoughts on this song and no matter how many times I listen to it I still can't pinpoint any of my feelings for it. I think that overall I'm not a fan of more noisy aspects of the song and I don't think the parts of the song I enjoy are good enough to counter the parts I don't.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Well! This song certainly sounds like a statement! Not sure of what though!

**seanderlust** (3): there's just...a lot going on here

**Tedyonce** (3): it didn‚Äôt make the album for a reason

**cashewconstellation** (2): no

**akanewasright** (1): this just sounds ugly I‚Äôm sorry. It makes me feel sick, and I think that‚Äôs a result of mixing but it‚Äôs just... not pleasant for me

**fadedblue09** (1): Excruciating

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Is this a demo or something? What's wrong with the audio quality? I could not finish it.

# this is a cheetah girls song

**hakkerj** (8.4): This sounds like a Cheetah Girls song omg!!! I like it!

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is a cheetah girls song

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): what in the cheetah girls hell. stop making dated pop hits when we know you can be better at references than this, Rina.

**letsallpoo** (5): this is a cheetah girls song

# Calls something 'camp' when it's just bad

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is gonna do poorly because Bloodpop, but I like bloodpop‚Äôs production.

**bespectacIed** (10): this was camp

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): y‚Äôall are SO MEAN to this song for absolutely no reason‚Ä¶ like this is the kind of queer house pop that we beg our faves to release but when Rina actually does it everyone bitches because it sounds like *Chromatica*... well maybe if *Chromatica* had sounded more like this it wouldn‚Äôt have flopped in the other Ultimate rate

**hikkaru** (10): it bops idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc

**LuisEnRod** (10): rain on me, rain rain rain on me

**ManofOranges** (10): I dig it.

**notarobot3675** (10): so good! and the music video is so fun

**salivantsonority** (10): Even though it's a Rain On Me knockoff, bop.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): sometimes I just wanna dance

**vayyiqra** (10): I already know you flops are going to tank this so do your worst, you tasteless peons (this is a joke I love you all). This is a BOP. I'll be praying for you that someday you see the light and admit to yourselves that this is fun. Until then, farewell.

**waluigiest** (10): okay yeah it‚Äôs really really good

**artzpop** (9): some people may call it an obvious reach for a radio hit, I call it art

**bigbigbee** (9): I think this is overhated! It sounds like Rain on Me, which I loved. I won‚Äôt say no to more of a good thing.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): i get why people hate it, but i think they missed the point. it's just so catchy. it's a forever 21 bop. it's the type of song you buy too small shirts to. it's one of those, please get me out of this store i'm too old for this songs. i hate it, which means i love it.

**skargardin** (9): insert stale bloodpop take here

**Stryxen** (9): sawayamatica

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Unpopular opinion but I love this song, it‚Äôs so nostalgic and summery. Weak lyrics but really strong delivery imo

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): God Rina is so beautiful‚Ä¶ and this song is too!

**xaviersi** (9): if this came out before chromatica it would have definitely been a 10 but it just feels inauthentic coming after the fact

**celladonn** (8.5): One of my favourite songs on Chromatica

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Rina could do Chromatica but Gaga could never do LUCID

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): rina sapphicyama

**seanderlust** (8.3): "is #RinaLUCID about masturbating ????????? maybe !!!!!!!!!!" - critically acclaimed musical artist Rina Sawayama

**urfavgalpal** (8.2): okay I kinda didn‚Äôt like this one at first cause it‚Äôs very like Bloodpop and I‚Äôm kinda eh in Bloodpop so to me the production sounded kinda shallow compared to the entirety of SAWAYAMA but it really is a grower.  It‚Äôs a catchy little bop. And while Rina is not a lesbian I think it would be disrespectful to my flair if I didn‚Äôt endorse this song given the subject matter

**akanewasright** (8): I just love Rina‚Äôs voice on everything

**Alumineous** (8): I actually liked it when it first came out, but I kinda don't care about it anymore. I have ran to the song several times, so it's still a dope song. I also didn't love love Chromatica, so I'm very ehhh on BloodPop and his generic beats.

**conceptualromance** (8): bloodpop a one trick pony at this point but Rina makes it work!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Yeah, this is definitely a BloodPop-produced track alright.

**ggal2020** (8): I‚Äôd never heard this song, only the hate for it, and I must say that while it is different from sawayama, it still slaps hard. bloodpop isn‚Äôt evil, lucid and chromatica are good shit.

**J\_Toe** (8): works better with the Rain on Me instrumentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBf34SLEaIE

**jasannn** (8): Better than Chromatica

**Oberionsynth** (8): Probably unpopular but I really enjoy this song. love the WLW representation too

**Palutzel** (8): yass take us to chromatica

**pheromenos** (8): i like bloodpop's production here tho

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it‚Äôs a Chromatica track so therefore I do like it to some extent

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): this is overhated. I get that its basic but it does still bop

**kirby31200** (7.5): So nice of Bloodpop to give Rina Gaga's scraps

**nick1372** (7.5): yes I know BloodPop ruins everything he touches. Yes I know we should have left his career in 2017 where it belongs. Yes I know this sounds like a Chromatica C-side. It‚Äôs still a queer masturbation anthem and it slaps!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): How can the drop be that annoying but also slap that hard?

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): the song is bad but it kind of bops i am not elaborating

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**frogaranaman** (7): how is this any different than some basic pride anthem made by some white pop star I don‚Äôt get the hate

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its fine

# Calls something bad when it's actually camp

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the chorus is just so uninspired... the rest of the song is fine

**afs** (7): Feel-good British club now, any genre left? Its mashup with Rain On Me is sooooo good though.

**bbfan132** (7): not amazing but much better than rym would have you think lol, this sound works better for her than i expected it to

**jaztinax** (7): i‚Äôd rather be dry but at least i‚Äôm aliveeeeee

**oscarbrierley1** (7): fun but kinda basic for her

**WhyDoIExistXD** (7): Bloodpop ruined it

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7): ; this does sound like a Gaga leftover

**geraldinewww** (6.9): me every single time this started on the rate playlist: huh wait why is chromatica on this

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): yeah it sounds like a chromatica goes trop pop outtake.... :/

**hakkerj** (6.3): Compared to the rest of the tracks on SAWAYAMA this one definitely falls short. It's a fun song, but not the type of music I am normally into. I am glad that it is just a deluxe track.

**EnCaine** (6): i did not care for chromatica :/

**engifear** (6): This is gonna get a lot more ones than it deserves

**LostintheCosmicFire** (6): bl*dpp really had the audacity to ruin a potentially sapphic anthem about masturbating and I hate that it sounds so much like rain on me, deplatform him.Rina slays with her vocals as always

**ReallyCreative** (6): god damn, it's not unpleasant to listen to, but there is so much more that could be done with Rina than this. Also I'm calling Kamala and arresting every producer/songwriter that puts a drop as a chorus or utilizes no lyrics/vocals as a chorus. It needs to be a federal crime YESTERDAY.

**SupremeShani** (6): i am open to revising my score if bloodpop ends up delivering on this chromatica remix album

**thedoctordances1940** (6): It's fine, not really something I'd expect from her but whatever

**welcome2thejam** (6): She does her best, but not feeling that drop. Kinda basic without the right punch or bounce to elevate it.

**jman457** (5.3): Its sounds like a lady gaga reject song

**amiriteor** (5): this was disappointing and boring also wheres the anthem for sleep paralysis HUH!

**fairytalehigh** (5): this... should have been left on the cutting room floor of the chromatica sessions where it belongs. SORRY RINA I LOVE YOU

**KennyEarthman** (5): I can't believe Rina released a single for Chromatica

**liberalitea** (5): fck bloodpop for ruining Rina's almost flawless discography. at least this song is sapphic.

**musical\_pyn** (5): this is my new standard for a 5

**Vultuxe** (5): I liked it until the drop

**iniekcja\_** (4.5): bl**dpop discourse aside, it really feels regressive

**nootnoot781** (4): rina, never leave clarence clarity EVER

**RandomHypnotica** (4): OK, this isn't as awful as everyone makes it out to be, but it's SO generic, painfully generic. Anybody could've sung this song, and it's a comparitively dull point in Rina's discography

**targetguest** (4): not my fav

**fadedblue09** (3): who let Lady Gaga into this rate

**IIIHenryIII** (3): It sounds like a Chromatica track, not better not worse. Actually, it sounds like a worse version of Rain On Me, and that song is not that good.

**letsallpoo** (3): someday bloodpop will pay for his crimes

**plastichaxan** (3): bloodpop you're gonna d word in 7 days

**static\_int\_husp** (3): Truly a chromatica reject

# ur gay

**moooo566** (11): I feel like this would work really well as a duet, maybe with a dude and a piano? Would be a 12 if you did that.

**pheromenos** (11): extra credit for introducing me to rina. also do i get anything if my 11 goes out first in a rate?

**zagreux** (11): as a gay person in a homophobic place this song means so much to me. also the npr tiny desk version is superior thank you very much.

**1998tweety** (10): yall dragged this and for what, its cute

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This is probably where most people will deck points off from SAWAYAMA but, there's something so pure about this song that is hard to hate at all. I love this message about 'choosing' your family and your home, your own safe space. It's definitely the song most people will be waving their hands Graduation (Friends Forever) style, fingers perching lit candles, some having tears streaming down their face... you get the idea. Love the simplicity overall of the production and melody, appropriately cheesy guitars and all - they just work together really well.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): Should I ever get married, I will pick this as my wedding song just to spite y‚Äôall haters.

**akanewasright** (10): King ily but also fuck you

**Alumineous** (10): I don't know how I haven't cried to this song yet. As a kid, I grew up watching all those coming out videos on YouTube. I was... an idiot to believe my Asian parents could accept me for who I was. I used to spend so much time at the LGBTQ+ centre downtown because it was the only place I felt safe. Look, I'm over feeling resentful or envious of other queer people who didn't have to face what I faced. If you do have parents who truly love you, treasure that love forever. I don't think I'll be talking to my parents any time soon.

**amiriteor** (10): this song.......YEAH

**bespectacIed** (10): You have to be cop to hate on this, like come on. It's a bit sappy but that's the fucking point, the queer experience is a melodramatic affair. If a youngster who has ever felt isolated in life hears this and it compels them to be find/create their chosen families, more power to them. Love this to bits, and the Tiny Desk version is even better.

**brenda\_official** (10): best song of all time if this comes last i will be very upset

**Brendon-Urine** (10): tears. real tears.

**celladonn** (10): This will be a victim of balladphobia but sometimes cheesy things are good!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING !!!!!!!!

**izeaklapaucius** (10): fuck you and your balladphobia popheads

**musical\_pyn** (10): yes it's a little cheesy, but god this song touches on a subject that is so, so close to me and so many others

**nick1372** (10): This song is so incredible it‚Äôs almost difficult to believe it‚Äôs real? Like you listen to it and you can‚Äôt fathom how it hasn‚Äôt existed for your entire life? It‚Äôs just a truly transcendent experience.

**nooodisaster** (10): I feel hugged.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): makes me cry every time

**Roxieloxie** (10): i mean she said she was gonna write a song called chosen family so idk what i was expecting. this is a 5 but its gonna go out first and i wanna make king mad so ill give it a 10

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I have a complicated relationship with the term ‚Äúchosen family‚Äù because my own family is so shit that family doesn‚Äôt seem like something that I would ever want to choose, and I am fine with just calling my friends my friends. But while this song is on my opinion changes and I just get in this weirdly bittersweet emotional state? Anyways, I feel like Glee would totally have done a bad cover of this and I have never even seen Glee

**static\_int\_husp** (10): popheads balladphobia is gonna tank this undeservedly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): do i stream this one a lot? no. will i ever listen to the elton john version? probably not! but it's fucking cute and overly hated!!! maybe it's not the ~GAY RIGHTS!!~ anthem she heralds it as but it's a still a touching little song that i like a lot.

**TiltControls** (10): overhated bop! can't wait to get down on the dancefloor to this song once things open up

**wasian-invasion** (10): such beautiful songwriting and rina's vocalsss <3 also i don‚Äôt think ive ever heard surname used in a song before lol

**wavingwolves** (10): when this goes out bottom 5 because gay people are literally the worst!!! still, i appreciate this a lot as someone who was (and will probably never be) accepted and supported by their own family. i find the melody to be really nice and i like her voice in this a lot. also, fuck you /u/Awkward_King

**plastichaxan** (9.5): say what you want about this and the lyrics but they hit really close to me idc

**bigbigbee** (9): I get why this song is hated on so much; the lyrics are definitely a bit trite (esp. the bridge), but I don‚Äôt know. It just works for me. Musically speaking, I really love the melody and the underlying instrumental; it reminds me a little of Owl City (have I mentioned that I love Owl City?).

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This has grown on me a lot since it was released. It works well on the album and stands out well. That bridge into the final chorus is gorgeous.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): y‚Äôall are about to do this so dirty, and for what?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh gosh, I hate that I am might have to witness this song going out on Day 1. This is such a beautiful song that heals me every time I hear this song. Sorry to add something about Taylor here but this is something she should have written about her appreciation for the LGBTQ+ community instead of You Need to Calm Down.

**jsonphile** (9): is this song cheesy as hell? Yes. Do I love it anyway? Yes.

**juanolsen** (9): i unpopular opinion but this song is great and the message is absolutely beautiful

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): This may have been a 10 for me before I heard the Elton John version.......and now that I know what's possible......this gets a 9

**NotWith10000Men** (9): this song is precious and I absolutely love the elton collab

**ReallyCreative** (9): the Elton John version did redeem this track a few points for me, the message is just too good to really subtract points from, queer friendships are so precious and special in a way that can be so hard to articulate, but this song makes a vary valiant attempt

**skargardin** (9): fuck the haters, this is lovely

**thedoctordances1940** (9): I know not everybody's too keen on this song but I find it absolutely gorgeous and the Elton John remix even manages to improve it.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this has several layers of camp

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): this song grew on me a lot. it's heavy-handed, sure, but it's deeply heartfelt. and the elton remix has such a glorious gay passing of the torch energy. i have to stan

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): I love how warm and sincere this is. Pretty tame for a Danny L Harle collab but not every song needs to be an experimental masterpiece, and I definitely underrated the production before, the electronic touches are giving me Frou Frou.

**afs** (8): A ballad, which isn't what I'm particularly into. Would have given a 7, but that note and the part after convinced me otherwise.

**anothertown** (8): people are so weird and homophobic about this song like we get it you hate songs about gay people loving and supporting each other

**conceptualromance** (8): I don‚Äôt get the hate for this song. It‚Äôs sweet!! Sometimes being corny is good!

**ggal2020** (8): this song is good you guys are just mean

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I‚Äôve heard people say this is too cheesy but I literally stan Meghan Trainor so like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not above that

**ImADudeDuh** (8): an INNOCENT song

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Fully resisting the urge to post that RuPaul quote from Season 5, I really do love this song. I‚Äôm not usually one for a schmaltzy ballad moment but god it‚Äôs so beautiful.

**kappyko** (8): this does not make me recoil the way the carly lyric in bad friend does

**liberalitea** (8): yeah this song is kind of corny and the balladphobia is gonna make this an early out, but it's a good song imo. i love the message and her vocals are amazing as always.

**pat-rickstar** (8): Something something overhated

**salivantsonority** (8): Sonically not my fav but I love the message. And her vocals are gorg. A little too waving flashlight on phone for me.

=====

Awkward_King: **throwaway7650** (8): hopefully this doesn't get too many 0s... it's not that bad

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Probably my least favorite on the album. It‚Äôs good but it definitely feels a little cheesy in contrast to some of some of the album‚Äôs more nuanced lyrics

**waluigiest** (8): it‚Äôs corny as hell but like‚Ä¶. So am I

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): ; idc what everyone on this subreddit says. It‚Äôs a good song!!!

**LostintheCosmicFire** (7.8): this is soo hated for no reason

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): I never really noticed how prevalent Danny's style is here, the Elton version hits a bit better though

**jman457** (7.5): Sure its heavy handed and corny as hell, but I still feel like its a sweet song about the strong friendship bonds

**rickikardashian** (7.5): i never expected to hear an interpolation of the "i love you you love me" barney song

**shhhneak** (7.5): y‚Äôall are going to try your hardest to get this out day 1 huh?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): honestly just a beautiful topic

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): I would have thought popheads of all people would enjoy a song about chosen families but apparently not! I think its very sweet.

**EnCaine** (7): sweet song

**ManofOranges** (7): Now wait a god damn minute, I've seen COUNTLESS people absolutely rag on this song over and over and over again, I was thinking it was going to be absolutely awful but... it's not?? Y'all have been complaining about this song and for what?? It's at the very worst serviceable and at it's best, a pretty good song.

**Turpamutteri** (6): I like the idea of this song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): its corny but its cute

# Homophobes

**pros-and-connors** (7.5): I love the sentiment and idea of this song, but when every other song on this album is damn near perfect it makes this song and it‚Äôs corniness stand out.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (7.5): Worst song on the album but still good

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (7): love the message, especially as someone from the lgbtq+ community, but the song is the worst on the album

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): sweet song but I think it drags

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Good night to Awkward_King only!

**Oberionsynth** (7): this is so cute but I will skip it most of the time lmao

**poptartchill** (7): I think it's a good song but it has Glee vibes (I was a Gleek)

**seanderlust** (7): the way this is a just okay song on an album full of bangers..."good in bed" teas

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm almost afraid to rate this song. It's about a concept that's very important to the LGBTQ community, and I'm acutely aware of how not gay I am while rating this. It's not meant for me, and that's okay, but it feels weird to be giving it a numerical rating, you know? I don't enjoy the song that much musically, but its message is beautiful. We agree on that, surely. I hope it doesn't place super low. It's really not bad.

**camerinian** (6.5): this is a bit too X Factor winner's song for me, but it's also not for me and that's OK :)

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I don‚Äôt hate it like everyone else on here but it‚Äôs definitely the weakest track on the album

**jasannn** (6.5): oop, the Good In Bed of the album. It's honestly not that bad.

**notarobot3675** (6.5): her version with elton john >>> i really love this song but the OG sonically just doesnt do it for me like the rest of the songs on this album. but i DO really love her singing about friendships, i wish more pop artists did this.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I can't help but compare this to Bad Friend, and I think her POV on friendships with that song is more unique than on this one. But I can tell this song is really special to her just from her delivery

**geraldinewww** (6): very sweet sentiment and lyrics but i just... don't like the song...

**oscarbrierley1** (6): borders cringy, kinda boring

**RandomHypnotica** (6): This isn't an AWFUL song, but it's easily Rina's weakest song. I appreciate the sentiment of it, but the delivery feels cheesy and hamfisted, the instrumental feels incredibly basic and boring, and it's a song I like to forget exists, especially for an artist with an insanely high quality discography

**urfavgalpal** (6): Listen I think this song gets a little more hate than it deserves but in my opinion it‚Äôs the only one that doesn‚Äôt stand up that much on its own.  When this was first released on its own I remember I didn‚Äôt like it that much.  I thought it was beautiful but boring.  Tbh I think I‚Äôm just not as much a fan of Danny‚Äôs production.  When I heard it on the album though I appreciated it a lot more.  This is a really nice break from the rest of the album and I think works well as a penultimate track.  It‚Äôs like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs all this pain in my veins here‚Äôs all this that I‚Äôve dealt with but at the end of the day I have my chosen family‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs really beautiful.  And while the more boring production means it‚Äôs the one song from this album that doesn‚Äôt usually make it onto my playlists, I think it‚Äôs a nice breather on an album with such intense production.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Unfortunately I‚Äôve been able to really relate to this song lately...

**Vultuxe** (6): The production is nice here but what are these lyrics? I don't hate the melody though. It's alright.

**vagenda** (5.9): chosen family in real life? beautiful. important. gorgeous concept. happy for everyone who has one. ‚Äúchosen family" in music? has never worked. stop trying to make it happen. its an awkward phrase that doesn't work in song. shut up

**just\_thonking** (5.5): The instrumentals remind me of fireflies by owl city. I gave it an extra half point because of the subject matter, but overall, the mildly catchy chorus cannot overcome the song's schmaltz and genericness. Far below the rest of Rina's work

**jackisboredtoday** (5.1): this is one of the only Rina songs going out early and I have no problem letting it

**astrologicalangel** (5): great message but boring af

**CarlieScion** (5): the definition of ¬´eh¬ª

**fadedblue09** (5): I love the message but god the lyrics are just so hamfisted and corny. Also why does the chorus remind me of Jessie J - Flashlight

**jaztinax** (5): it‚Äôs a beautiful song but it‚Äôs also rly boring

**pig-serpent** (5): I don't hear anything that really elevates this song above pretty good for a ballad.

**bbfan132** (4): this hurts since i appreciate the message but those high notes‚Ä¶. this should‚Äôve been a one-off single

**mudkip1** (4): this song is stuck in my head and i don't like that it is

**Qustomar** (4): Nice message but such a blah song that sticks out on this super varied and exciting album :/ Which is the popular consensus haha.

**steelstepladder** (4): Just too nail on the head

**SupremeShani** (4): someone said this sounded like that jessie j song she did for pitch perfect and i will never forget that

**artzpop** (3): why would you do this

**frogaranaman** (3): this is cheesy which can be good but doesn‚Äôt work for me on this one

**KennyEarthman** (3): I appreciate the found family message, but something about this song isn't just hitting like the acoustic one

**lagozzino** (3): If I were a teen I'd definitely love this song and think it was super deep and important, but I'm 30 and so is Rina.

**nootnoot781** (3): yeah‚Ä¶ i have this greyed out on spotify for a reason. i don‚Äôt have the heart to give this a 0 but this is just not well done. i appreciate the sentiment but wow i do not like this

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3): it's not too bad but i can't get past the corniness of the lyrics

**cremeebrulee** (2): maybe this is overh- nvm just got to the bridge

**ktajlili** (2): This is perfect example of a terrible bop ballad.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): I like the message of this song, and I know its purposely cheesy but it really just not what I like to vibe with or cry to

**AHSWeeknd** (0): Rina said ‚Äúafter an album filled with philosophical discussion about various ideologies and societal issues I will write a song so bland and so obvious.‚Äù This is not good.

**cashewconstellation** (0): i'm sorry, i get the meaning behind it but let me just say that if this is the only song on the album Rina wrote by herself, that's a good enough argument for her to NEVER enter the studio without cowriters EVER AGAIN

**hikkaru** (0): :loveloses:

**Leixander** (0): this is not a song in rina sawayama's otherwise awesome discography. this is not a song in rina sawayama's otherwise awesome discography. this is not a song in rina sawayama's otherwise awesome discography. this is not-

**runaway3212** (0): this drags and the instrumentation sucks, maybe if you can relate to the lyrics but i can't, it's just bad

**targetguest** (0): sorry lol

I don't know if this is garage - well I do know, and it is not - but it certainly takes influence from early 2010's UK garage and that sound is really weirdly comforting to me because it reminds me of my sister and the phase she had where she was obsessed with it. Anyway this song works well for me, it's speedy and doesn't overstay it's welcome, though I do kinda get why it flopped so hard here, because it definitely tackles the same themes as several other songs here and does it much less interestingly.

---

# OMG I get it!

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Once I heard the robot song from Spongebob played over the lyrics to this thing I was 100% sold on this shit lol. God it is so catchy.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a sad bop

**LuisEnRod** (10): that therapist line hits extra hard lol

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is SO overhated. Like, ridiculously overhated. When this first released, I felt like the only person who loved this. The garage beat is really different for Charli, but works well, and in the context of this album, it really nicely ties up the "I Hate Myself" trilogy

**urfavgalpal** (10): this is the last of the songs that I really love on this album and I really love it!  This whole stretch gives me elevated N1A vibes I really love it so much.  I particularly love here how perfect the transition is.   The voice memo sets this song up beautifully and wow the lyrics are amazing.  I get chills listening to this one tbh.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): this baseline is impeccable

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): make it longer, charli, you coward

**Vultuxe** (9.5): This is an interesting one... I think it's the catchiest song on the record, so much so that I can look past the lyrics.

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): the stuttered chorus is so fucking catchy, she really snapped

**bbfan132** (9): :puggofast:

**iniekcja\_** (9): I absolutely despise this song, it brings pain and trauma, I hate it with a passion, it should be criminalized, it killed my cow and fucked my man, IFY is a cunt, I love IFY so much, why is IFY a cunt? I never said that, we got you saying it seconds ago, IFY is my friend

**nick1372** (9): ‚Äúmy therapist says I hate myself really bad‚Äù is such a childish yet incredible line

**nooodisaster** (9): It's a serve, what do you want me to say?

**vayyiqra** (9): I support almost any song that normalizes therapy.

**waluigiest** (9): charli stans aren‚Äôt brave enough to admit this is a good song. -1 point because I miss when the instrumentals dropped out in the demo

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): a fantastic song, but in comparison to the rest of HIFN this is a dud - ONLY charli could make that happen

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): i love the uk garage influence on this a lot, v fish n‚Äô chips

**cremeebrulee** (8): it genuinely sounds like she‚Äôs singing ‚Äúdababy i love you bad‚Äù

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I really didn‚Äôt like the hug it out lyric otherwise it‚Äôs fun and I like the liquid lines.

**endcreditouilles** (8): [yes hello i was wondering if you could play that song again, the one that goes bee boo boo bop boo boo beep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_i4FbzaYww)

**ManofOranges** (8): Me after learning enough spanish to know what "Hola ¬øC√≥mo est√°s?" means.

**Oberionsynth** (8): imagine charli with an american accent, i literally cAHnt

**akanewasright** (7.9): Bop, but less of a bop than the stretch that came right before it

**hakkerj** (7.9): This song really grew on me after more listens

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): I could‚Äôve sworn this samples Party at a Rich Dude‚Äôs House by Kesha. Not my favourite musically but the frantic energy is compelling, it does sound like a burst of motivation after dragging yourself out of depression sludge. ‚ÄúMy therapist says I hate myself really bad‚Äù iconic line

**amiriteor** (7.6): maybe

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): The drumbeat is really awesome.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): cute song

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): It sounds like she's saying dababy i love you bad

**1998tweety** (7): cute, chorus is catchy

**afs** (7): I thought she was gonna sample Party at a Rich Dude's House at first lmao. Also I realised I've heard this before on the radio. It's alright.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this reminds me of a remix of a 90s eurodance song. Not a 90s eurodance song, but specifically a remix of one.

**KennyEarthman** (7): bouncy bop that. loved it, even tho I forgot half the lyrics after

**pat-rickstar** (7): This will probably be one of the first songs out and it's not deserved

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): but the lyrics are relatable asf just another song i wanted some explosive chaos out of. i think i might be coming around to hyperpop.

**shhhneak** (7): the British accent jumped out on this one.

**jman457** (6.7): I like the melodies on this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): alright this one has a groove

# Wait can you explain that one more time

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I don‚Äôt

**UselessTacooo** (7.9): I barely remember this one

**ggal2020** (7.5): I think I would‚Äôve liked this song much more if it weren‚Äôt a single

**juanolsen** (7): i literally forgot about the existence of this track

**pig-serpent** (7): Normally DnB based songs are among the highlights of their respected album but this one is relatively uninteresting. The bassline is enough to prop it up though.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This just feels unemotional and dead inside even for her. Fun instrumental though

**runaway3212** (6.5): I don't really love this, but think it's a tad overhated

**bespectacIed** (6): sounds like a rookie kpop girl group release ...something from WEEEKLY or STAYC maybe lmao. it's fun

**cashewconstellation** (6): uhhhhhhhhhhhhh kinda bad (also i HATE the way she says understand)

**hikkaru** (6): i don't

**ignitethephoenix** (6): love how raw the lyrics are too bad the song is very mid and kind of boring

**jasannn** (6): yeah, sorta basic.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): This one is fine, but no......I do not finally understand the hype around this album (sry I love you Charli)

**ktajlili** (6): The production on the rest of the album is so fire, then there's this...it's just okay.

**ReallyCreative** (6): literally never me, what the fuck Charli I have never understood anything in my fucking life, how fucking dare you rub this in my face

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I think that the best tracks on this album are when she‚Äôs creating energy and hype, or when she‚Äôs focusing on a really pretty, strong melody. To me, this track lacks both of those.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): feel like i don't rlly have anything to say about this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5.5): Catchy, but not super noteworthy. Also it‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôm just now noticing this but a lot of these songs are about the same thing

**CarlieScion** (5): so mid

**CrimsonROSET** (5): well I dont

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): Unfortunately I just do not understand why this song has never worked for me :/

**musical\_pyn** (5): doesn't really go anywhere

**salivantsonority** (5): Pretty classic baseline but I can't imagine listening to it under any context.

**SupremeShani** (5): me when i lie when popheads asks me to listen to this album one more time

**thedoctordances1940** (5): really uninteresting, nothing bad, nothing good either

**wavingwolves** (4.8): "my therapist says i hate myself really bad" well i don't need a therapist to tell me that but u do u charli

**Qustomar** (4.5): Catchy, I like the beat! But it just doesn't feel like a completed song lol.

**frogaranaman** (4): really weird song in the pacing of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the verses are cool but the chorus is so droning

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Maybe (bebebe) this song is a bit too obnoxious...

**liberalitea** (3.5): this is super forgettable and it really only picks up in the last 30 seconds or so

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This is just kinda forgettable.

I have always been a fan of the theory that this is the other side of the Want You In My Room coin, and while it evidently uhhh hasn't reached the same rate heights that song has, it's cute! It's cute!

---

# A nice cross-breeze through the house

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I really like this kind of style of music that's kind of swingy? Guitary? Really not sure but it has some funk underlying within it, and Carly really nails this kind of song with the kind of 'I'll be your girl' lyrics.

**anothertown** (10): as the only Vulfpeck fan on this webforum i‚Äôm obligated to give this a 10

**CrimsonROSET** (10): SO. UNDERRATED. The windows of time by the song kinda buffering? Iconic!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I love this song idc idc idc

**joeeswift** (10): Carly's best song....like ever

**ManofOranges** (10): The way she says keep a window for me and then the song has "windows" of sort in the sound where there's nothing to kind of sonically suggest a window, ugh her mind.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i love this. what a targetcore bop. what an absolute hmm i need new curtains jam. what a banger to listen to as you spend 900 dollars on dollar section items. what an absolute BOPPER to get a JC Penney's haircut to.

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay so this is like boneless wyimr, the bones in question being mister jackoffs. but honestly all this is reminding me of is how i thought the line in WYIMR was 'slide onto my window and i thought they were just fucking against a window'

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I love the way everything cuts out during the chorus

**targetguest** (10): it's new, it's fun, it grooves

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I'll always keep a window open for this song. I love the bass and the way she pronounces "bo-dy" in the chorus. She sounds so cute!

**KennyEarthman** (9): cafe music

**wasian-invasion** (9): love the instruments and little start/stops on this

**jman457** (8.9): a grooooovy jam, with some fantastic production. Feels forward thinking for her while nostalgic.

**juanolsen** (8.7): i love the production of the song and how it goes perfectly well with the concept

**vagenda** (8.6): It‚Äôs cute but I‚Äôm mad that the shared bridge basically means that Carly chose this over Disco Darling when Disco Darling is SO MUCH BETTER

**akanewasright** (8.5): This and Let‚Äôs Sort The Whole Thing Out belong in different scenes of the same teen-rom-com

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): imagine you're lying on your bed minding your business and then suddenly carly rae jepsen CLIMBS through your window and cries "YOU KEPT THE WINDOW OPEN FOR ME." just imagine

**nick1372** (8.5): If we keep the yonic metaphor from want you in my room then this song becomes INCREDIBLY lesbian and I think that‚Äôs just neat

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is a really cute proof-of-concept, harking back to Carly's Tug of War sound and pulling it off pretty well. It's not super impressive or memorable outside of that though.

**TiltControls** (8.5): fun bop!

**Vultuxe** (8.5): My first impression of Window was tragic, but it grew on me? It's just an enjoyable song, the lyrics aren't special but damnit if I don't love Carly's voice especially compared to the first song.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Tug of war tease

**savemeaseat143** (8.3): the other side of WYIMR

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**fadedblue09** (8): Cute percussion-driven song. Hope she hones this sound more in the future.

**jasannn** (8): TAKE MY EYES TO BORROWWWW

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (8): A perfectly sensible bop

**Palutzel** (8): cute bop

**sirpancakeXI** (8): finally grow on me after a whole year

**Dekubaku** (7.8): A bit 2010's, IMO. But it remains rather fun.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.7): I feel like there‚Äôs an effect on this song that doesn‚Äôt sound great on my phone but otherwise very fun and summery. The abrupt stops were interesting

**urfavgalpal** (7.7): One of my more favorite songs on this album but not my most favorites.  I like how it‚Äôs a little bit more laid back and I think Carly‚Äôs ability to really make you feel shines here.  This is I think my favorite song on this album to have come on while I‚Äôm cooking because it‚Äôs a little more lowkey.

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): she‚Äôs cute

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun but i wish it had a bit more energy/dynamism

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): a chill bop

**frogaranaman** (7): very cute

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I like this one, it‚Äôs very cute lyrically and the sparseness of the production works for the vibe it‚Äôs going for

# Shut the window shut the fucking window now it's freezing in here

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I had this at 9-10 originally, but then the listening party happened.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song is okay but I think it suffers because there isn‚Äôt really a difference between the verses and the chorus? Like the minimalist Motown thing works to get me pumped up but then it amounts to nothing so the song just feels flat.

**Leixander** (7): Disco Darling should've been here Carly!!!

**musical\_pyn** (7): very much a side b track

**notarobot3675** (7): love the vulfpeck inspiration! although tbh after hearing disco darlings... this song just doesn't hit like it used to. disco darling is so good and i just... donut understand the need for the change lmao

**Oberionsynth** (7): this song would be so much better with a different vocalist ngl, something about carly's voice just doesn't hit right for me (not saying she's bad, just not my taste)

**pig-serpent** (7): A fairly basic bass guitar driven song. It's certainly a good song, but not anything special.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's quite cute but feels more like a b-side than any other song here

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): slide on through my window!!! anyway i like this but Disco Darling is so much better so why wasn‚Äôt the bridge used on that instead

**geraldinewww** (6.5): you were the one you were the one you were the one

**afs** (6): didn't really expect the funk at all, and it's not bad! But that abrupt stop in the beginning of the chorus keeps throwing me off.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): A skip

**bespectacIed** (6): I like the preppy late 2000s indie ghorl vibe. But it is as cute as it is cloying

**conceptualromance** (6): I have no excuse, I just don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening here

**ignitethephoenix** (6): yep this is definitely a b side

**RandomHypnotica** (6): Why does this have the same rhythm as Selena Gomez & The Scene's iconic Who Says

**SmileAndTears** (6): Wow I just realized she used the "You were the one, you were the one And I need your love." line and now I'm just wondering why I'm not listening to Disco Darling instead

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's not bad it's just kinda boring

**throwaway7650** (6): definitely my least favorite on this album, it somehow feels slow

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The pauses in this song are very disorienting lol

**Vromega** (6): lacks lyricism, melody, construction. The different elements of this song do not match each other. Exception the nice "you are the one" with the background vocals.

**waluigiest** (6): Want You In My Room Side B

**welcome2thejam** (6): Well, Carly does give me her eyes to borrow after not letting me keep mine in I Really Like You, so I guess that's a plus.

**plastichaxan** (5.8): this is kind of forgettable

**Alumineous** (5): Skip!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Cute but basic.

**nooodisaster** (5): a cute midtempo song that I never willingly listen to

**NotWith10000Men** (5): I like the plunky noise.

**pat-rickstar** (5): Doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere

**runaway3212** (5): this is a c side song

**salivantsonority** (5): I'm bored, Carly. Wouldn't keep the window open for this song.

**fenellabeach** (4.8): go on girl give us nothing

**oscarbrierley1** (4.5): yawn

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): Welp the momentum just stops after This Love Isn't Crazy

**liberalitea** (4): suddenly i wanna live in a dungeon

**SupremeShani** (4): There is something off-kilter about this song that is charming, but at the same time feels unfinished to me.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): kind of unremarkable

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): I just dont like this sorry :/

This isn't going to make any sense but the first ten seconds of this song make me think of Enchanted and then I can't enjoy the rest of the song, even if it was a song I liked, which it isn't, because I just want to watch Enchanted. I should go watch Enchanted. Anyway I'm so sorry kappy you through your 11 away on this but at least you weren't one of the people who threw it away on fucking Chosen Family.

---

# Would put down the ugly blouse they are holding and quietly bop to this if they heard it in a midwestern retail store

**kappyko** (11): it works

**NFLfreak98** (11): Put this drum track on any song and it‚Äôs instantly better

**thedoctordances1940** (11): There are probably quite a lot of songs in this rate that I would consider better songs, but ultimately nothing beats just how blissful this is. It definitely goes more indie than Carly ever dares to but this is just indie pop at it's finest, the driving drum beat, the little guitar lick and the absolutely bombastic chorus, I can only hope she decides to make more songs like it in future.

**bespectacIed** (10): Tweely Rae Tweensen. I love it. Carly and Molly of Alvvays need to do a 'great canadian platinum-blonde bob cut' indie pop collab

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this kinda sounds like a bleachers song but i really like bleacher songs

**endcreditouilles** (10): serving discovering-myself-on-a-cross-country-road-trip-realness

**hunnybee12** (10): bop bop bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is such a coffee shop song, but my inner white leaps out when this song is played

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): Every one of my Dedicated Side B reviews will include the word "bop", but of all the bops.....this one bops the hardest

**ManofOranges** (10): Very peppy-rom-com-with-main-characters-who-love-each-other-very-much-and-live-and-laugh-all-the-time-even-through-the-hard-times kind of deal.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song just makes me so happy

**plastichaxan** (10): she's so smart putting the best song before the worst one to make this seem better

**Turpamutteri** (10): I never see anyone talking about this but it's always been one of my favorites on the album

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): A pretty fun song that's pretty climactic but not in the same way This Love Isn't Crazy is, still lovely instrumental and Carly sounds really happy on this one and sells it greatly.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Ok, guys, let's sort the whole thing out: CARLY RAE JEPSEN is the most underrated pop artist, for real. Why is everybody always sleeping on her?

**urfavgalpal** (9.4): serotonin straight into my veins from the moment this song starts.  Love this one.

**vagenda** (9.3): This song is a delicious slice of 80s movie mall montage fun and if you don‚Äôt like it you don‚Äôt like joy! That‚Äôs all there is to it!

**akanewasright** (9): ~~god I wish that were me...~~

**camerinian** (9): I need to be basically tripping on serotonin to enjoy this, but on the two days of the year when that happens this is fucking incredible

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is really cute! It‚Äôs got this kinda bratty ‚Äò00s pop-punk energy to it but it also feels like something from an old musical

**KennyEarthman** (9): a Carly pop-rock album would be amazing

**Leixander** (9): THEN HE SAID

**liberalitea** (9): this a dancey bop i love it

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This is exactly the in your face, overly cheery pop I know and love Carly for, it's dreamy and soft, "and he said, I LOVE YOU" is so catchy, it's so much fun

**SupremeShani** (9): The whole vibe of the song is so sugary that it almost borderlines on cheesy, but I think that's what I love about Carly, because this is like pure serotonin injected into my brains. The drums and melody reminds me of some soundtrack to a cheap high school movie, and I mean that as a compliment.

**welcome2thejam** (9): A real "sunny day car ride" type of bop.

**welcometoNY** (9): can't wait for this to go out day one!

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): such a perfect song for a rom-com it gives me so much energy and it's so fun to sing along to

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is like the theme song to a really cheesy 80's romcom. I love it!

**hikkaru** (8.5): me when im sorting the whole thing out

**nick1372** (8.5): This one took a while to grow on me but the energy is infectious, especially in the chorus!

**notarobot3675** (8.5): this song is so cute!

**Dekubaku** (8.2): A sweet song. Rather teen and disney but in a good way.

**rickikardashian** (8.2): what romcom did carly write this song for

**wavingwolves** (8.1): this feels like music that would play in a christmas themed romcom during a dressing up montage

**Alumineous** (8): The hook is sonically childish and verbally repetitive. Plus, the song is 40 seconds longer than it should be. But... it's not average and I wouldn't skip it.

**bbfan132** (8): fun song, reminds me of a go-gos/bangles song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): So catchy it's almost annoying. Almost.

**cremeebrulee** (8): wtf idr this being so cute

**ggal2020** (8): society needs more teeny bob pop like this

**J\_Toe** (8): this sounds like a different sound for Carly. It's so quirky I love it!

**jman457** (8): Giving me a 2009 Jangle rock song and im here for it! (even though It can were its welcome really quickly)

**nooodisaster** (8): Cute vibes

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Nine year old me organizing my Pok√©mon cards in alphabetical order then rearranging them by Pok√©dex number

**vayyiqra** (8): Kind of a banger; I get the hype.

**juanolsen** (7.9): the chorus is annoying

**geraldinewww** (7.5): this is very cheese but sometimes i like cheese

**just\_thonking** (7.5): the verses are SO good and then the chorus... happens

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Fun song that rocks.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): this song is so bubblegum pop, feel like I'd hear this song in a magical girl anime or something

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): I cannot get over a comment I saw saying it sounds like the John Oliver theme

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): this is giving me commercial jingle but i mean that in a nice way, it‚Äôs fun!

**afs** (7): Carly trying out teen pop rock! Feels more like she's covering somebody from a decade ago, though.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I can‚Äôt actually follow what‚Äôs supposed to be going on in the song lyrically but i like the drums.

**slimboyfriend** (7): This could definitely play in a JC Penney ad and I would still like it

**Vultuxe** (7): This track is very wholesome and dangerously close to rock-pop which is unique for Carly. Don't hate it, but don't love it.

**jasannn** (6): A little annoying and saccharine but that chorus is so catchy.

# Someone needs to sort this song out

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): I'm not sure how i feel about this...

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Song title describes how I feel about this record. Fun track though. Bit teen movie-y. Very uninspiring chorus without the meme potential of "Store".

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): it's fine, no real other feelings

**CarlieScion** (6.5): low-key feels like a kids song

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the chorus brings it down, too chanty. I wish it had gone a bit more pop rock bc that's kinda the vibe I got from the verses

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): One of the most disappointing choruses I've ever heard, the fact that she repeats the same thing twice completely ruins the song for me. The song also could've gone so much harder

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**ktajlili** (6): I like this one at first but after a while it started to annoy me. It's just too sugary...

**runaway3212** (6): more annoying than good

**seanderlust** (6): target commercialcore

**fenellabeach** (5.5): how about let's sort this song out

**Uberpigeon** (5.5): this was teetering on the egde of cringe and i thought i liked it until the second verse

**AHSWeeknd** (5): late-90s rock influence in a Pop album???

**conceptualromance** (5): not this 2010s indie JCPenney commercial riff. I really can‚Äôt decide if I like it or hate it

**fairytalehigh** (5): the production in the chorus sounds like a jingle for a macy's holiday sale from 15 years ago in the WORST possible way

**frogaranaman** (5): actually I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore

**jayjaysortagay** (5): it sounds like the end credits song of a bad Netflix Original

=====

Awkward_King: **rosecoloreds** (5): sounds like the type of song that would play in the background of disney channel original movie while the main character is going shopping and she's trying out different outfits

**SideBTrack8** (5): this is Carly's ME!

**skargardin** (5): this is very weak compared to the rest

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i'm sorry but her tone in the chorus is really aggravating me. other than that it's enjoyable

**jaztinax** (4): too sweet and cheesy for me and that‚Äôs saying something

**Oberionsynth** (4): target commercial for pride month vibes

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): it's giving 00's romcom montage track

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Sorry, this chorus is kinda annoying...

**pat-rickstar** (3): This one really grates on me, the instrumental sounds like royalty free youtube background music and the high pitched "I love you"s are annoying

**Brendon-Urine** (1): those fucking snare drums haunt me in my nightmares. WHY ARE THEY CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THE TRACK. this could have been good but I can't stand to listen to it because of the damn ass snare rolls.

**fadedblue09** (1): Sounds like one of those Cyndi Lauper B-sides that aged badly

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): c‚Äômon Macys! But no fr this sounds like a kohl‚Äôs commercial

**waluigiest** (0): noooo this sounds like the sims OST in the worst possible way it makes me so mad

# What fucking storyline did Dedicated have???

**xxipil0ts** (0): As much as this song is on-the-nose for Carly, the song felt so lost with the storyline that Dedicated delivered.

Creme, Hypno, I'm so sorry. For my own score and also this song's unfortunate placement jsdsjd. What I will say, is it is certainly the best song called 7 Years that I have heard!!

# my therapist says i love this song really bad

**cremeebrulee** (11): wish charli wasn‚Äôt in this rate so i can give my 11 to chloe x halle peacefully, BUT i still regret not giving official my 11 in the ama queens rate so part of this is to make up for it. but part of it is just really like these more introspective songs that charli does (see: thoughts, feb 2017, detonate etc). yes, maybe i am projecting a lot of personal feelings into a song with the lyrics ‚ÄúWithout the Holy matrimony, I'm wife (I'm wife)‚Äù but idc. this song makes me wanna reach the level of comfort with a person that you only get after being with them for so long. anyway, i‚Äôm not gonna be surprised when this flops and i am still rooting for ungodly hour to win, but it just wouldn‚Äôt feel honest giving anything else my 11 when this is here

**targetguest** (11): one of my favorite Charli tracks of all time. Recently celebrated my 7 year anniversary with my fianc√© and it's a super meaningful song to me

**akanewasright** (10): This just about melts my heart

**bespectacIed** (10): I say this on every rate with her in it: no one in pop music does introspective songs with punchy production better than charli. This is what she does best. See also: silver cross, next level charli, grins, emotional, party 4 u. God this song makes me feel everything

**Brendon-Urine** (10): that little part when the instrumental kinda backs out and she sings the chorus but it's so vulnerable and tender... hrrngghhhh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): i kinda hate this but i like it like a lot lol

**Leixander** (10): the chorus is too infectious

**mudkip1** (10): fucking iconic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This was SOOOOOO close to getting my 11. It's my most listened of the tracks on this rate, and my 4th most listened track of all time on last.fm. This is basically the Official of HIFN (and I LOVED Official), it's a celebration of Charli's relationship, and it's really nice to hear Charli being happy, and making a love song in the way she knows best. The punchy, sharp chords, the autotune on the chorus, it all just comes together so well, and I can listen to it forever and never get bored.

**runaway3212** (10): this song feels like a victory

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I almost gave this 9.7 for the meme but I‚Äôm too attached to it to not give a 10. It just makes me so happy for Charli. I‚Äôve also been with my partner for 7 years (almost 8!) and I connect with the message of growing with someone through hard times, learning to communicate and becoming better for it.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): 1989 came out in 2014, which was 7 years ago, so 1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version) is being released the same day as the rate reveal

**urfavgalpal** (10): My favorite Charli album is Number 1 Angel and this song really gives me elevated N1A vibes.  You just get such a vibrant image of her relationship with this song and it really fits into the theme of this stretch of the album.

**wavingwolves** (10): this makes me want a relationship so i hate it

**zagreux** (10): I love how corny this is

**Palutzel** (9.8): if this had another chorus, it would be perfect. I cannot stress enough how good the production is

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): ; the shock I was in to find out Charli has been in a relationship for 7 years

**plastichaxan** (9.3): i underrated this for a while, and while it's not the best song here it's amazing still

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): It really says something about hifn that this is one of the weakest songs, but it's still every bit as bright and industrial as I would love it.

**amiriteor** (9): what if i was in love

**camerinian** (9): CYOOT

**KennyEarthman** (9): is it just me or the chorus sounds like Porsche's pre-chorus

**liberalitea** (9): underrated but i think it's great

**nootnoot781** (9): flop, lukas graham outsold with ease (but in all seriousness this is such a cute love song ??)

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): speaking of crying but now in a slightly happier way

**sirpancakeXI** (9): Deserve to be a hit instead of the one by lukas graham

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): charli always uses vocal effects so well, but this song is such a serve with them

**waluigiest** (9): the harmonies are so correct

**hakkerj** (8.9): This beat stays stuck in my head on repeat

**bbfan132** (8.5): you're exactly really really my type

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): a really sweet love song, love the more vulnerable charli tracks

**pig-serpent** (8): Digital harmonies will force me to add 2 or 3 points to any song.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): cute bop

**thegraygh0st** (8): im wife

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): Better than the straight version

**Dekubaku** (7.7): It's right there in the name.

**jman457** (7.7): The xcx production about love really goes well together

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): The sleeping pill line and the chorus throw me off. Still a good song, though.

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): quite good! not amazing but almost on Claws's level

**ManofOranges** (7): Any song named 7 Years is guaranteed to outsold Lukas Graham simply by existing.

**musical\_pyn** (7): I really hate the fact I'm giving this a 7

# Lukas Graham stans

**bulforster** (8.8): Those 2nd verse lyrics... maybe the d'amelio comparisons are justified... whatever, the rest is super cute

**UselessTacooo** (8.1): one of the weakest links here, but still worthy

**juanolsen** (8): a little forgettable, but good overall

**nick1372** (8): I really like the writing on this one but it‚Äôs missing something and I can‚Äôt put my finger on what

**Oberionsynth** (8): I love how she sampled the pans from "I don't get no sleep cause of y'all", ugh her mind

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I mean this is the nicest way possible, this definitely sounds like a song about a 7 year relationship.

**salivantsonority** (7.5): Really like the vocals on this track even though the melody doesn't enthuse me that much.

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): ew this made me think of lukas graham

**CrimsonROSET** (7): one for every year in their relationship, good for her honestly

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Lukas Graham who?

**notarobot3675** (7): really enjoyed this! haven't got much else to say about it. production felt a little cleaner, but overall just a really nice Charli track.

**rickikardashian** (7): years

**skargardin** (7): 7 Years

**vayyiqra** (7): Charli XCX, 2013: "Ha! We on some husband and wife shit". Charli XCX, 2020: "I'm wife"

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I swear this is my actual score I‚Äôm not trying to be memey‚Ä¶ the instrumentation reminds me of Closer‚Ä¶ but in a good way

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6.5): sweet song! Really repetitive with the with really really stud but I found the flight lyric with the sleeping pills clever.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): what percentage of these comments will be Lukas Graham jokes

**afs** (6): if I didn't know what hyperpop was and I heard this, I'd immediately understand why it's called that.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): ENUNCIATE SIS

**brenda\_official** (6): the lyrics...charli miss girl

**iniekcja\_** (6): the chorus is the only redeeming quality

**Itsafudgingstick** (6): I don‚Äôt know why this song has never done it for me tbh. That being said I was sooo tempted to give this song a 7; but I really can‚Äôt give filler (to me) higher than a 6 justifiably

**jasannn** (6): The only thing I can ever remember from this song is "swish".

**pat-rickstar** (6): I'll give it a positive score for the production but these lyrics need some work

**seanderlust** (6): eh this is the first one off the album I could take or leave. it's not bad, but it's just fine

**1998tweety** (5): i wanted to give this a 7 to match the title but unfortunately it was not good enough for that, dont really care for her vocal delivery but there are some cute bits.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): There's not really much of a hook here.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Years by Bjork >>
[/r/popheads/comments/nn3owd/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_1_my_therapist/gzstewh/]

=====

Awkward_King: **fadedblue09** (5): This sounds fun, but I do not buy this "I'm finally settling down" song from her. Also "I'm wife" is a cringe lyric

**frogaranaman** (5): the breakdown at the end is nice but the production sounds like discount Flume at points

**jayjaysortagay** (5): kind of annoying and nothing-y

**jaztinax** (5): i zone out every time i listen to this song so i always forget what it sounds like

**Qustomar** (5): This song is nice but Charli's more slow and emotional PC songs blend together and do not resonate with me at all. This song, White Mercedes, Lucky, Official, Thoughts, Enemy, etc., do not do much for me.

**SupremeShani** (5): Anyone who mentions the Lukas Graham song will be sent to Barbz University immediately.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): this started off promising and got worse as it on

**throwaway7650** (5): can't say I love her vocal delivery here, song is a chore to finish

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): Not bad but definitely my least favorite on the album. Gained at least one point from me solely for not being a... different... song.

**Vultuxe** (5): Unfortunately, I'm indifferent to this one, I think the hook is a swing and a miss just sonically, I don't like it. And the lyrics are, once again, rock bottom for her.

**welcometoNY** (5): there's so much to hate here, from rhyming always with always to using the word "really" 15 times. she's lucky it's still a bop or it would be scoring much worse.

**ReallyCreative** (4): It's called 7 years because Charli sounds like a kindergartener

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): congratulations lukas graham, you're not the worst anymore

**TragicKingdom1** (4): the 7s people give this to be cute will actually increase its average

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I just don‚Äôt understand the lyrics of this one, why does she *want* to sound this dumb? This is so beneath her

**ImADudeDuh** (3): thats like 49 years in dog years

**NotWith10000Men** (3): I like the melody but she sounds awful

**CarlieScion** (2): this song fucking sucks!!!!!!!

While I can understand a lot of people find this *too* abrasive and just charli sing-talking over noise, I really enjoy it, and honestly thought it was less divisive than it evidently is, so I was surprised at this staying mid day 1 for pretty much the entire rate. Sure, it‚Äôs not as good as Next Level Charli, but it is fun :D

# [Glow pink in the night](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/828772422034391080/847657336897142794/image0.png)

**bbfan132** (11): absolutely fucking brilliant, already know it‚Äôll be robbed

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Perfect opener, bangs hard, like what can I really say? Even the rapping on this thing is cool

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This goes ~~off~~ real hard

**bulforster** (10): You want to go real hard? Well guess what Charli, you did.

**camerinian** (10): PUNCH ME IN THE FUCKING FACE CHARLI

**CreepyMannequin** (10): This was a big contender for my 11. It just...goes so hard, you could say.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The album peaks with its intro track. It's a career-highlight for Charli (and is better than Next Level Charli).

**fairytalehigh** (10): pretty sure this song is about showing off yr hoo-ha on the webcam and i'm 100% here for that energy, charlotte

**hikkaru** (10): im going feral

**kirby31200** (10): Death Grips for gay people

**LostintheCosmicFire** (10): Iconic intro,I feel this is a more sincere expression of what people were feeling during this pandemic than forever.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is just that meme of gay people's taste in music being the worst thing you‚Äôve ever heard

**Oberionsynth** (10): the beat to this song is the top I've needed during quarantine ugh, even tho we made her sign a douche she really made a song for the bottoms, QUEEN

**plastichaxan** (10): this goes off too hard, i know y'all will do it dirty for whatever reason but this is just perfect

**racloves** (10): goes real hard

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Starting the album off a VERY strong note, Charli really did go real hard here. When that guitar hits, I'm sent into the stratosphere it's so hard.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love this industrial moment, iconic intro

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Charli please tag your Steven Universe spoilers

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song is my gateway to her entire discog and even hyperpop in general, the impact alone deserve a 10

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Charli's openors are always way too amped up

**targetguest** (10): this song has been in my daily rotation since coming out, it hasn't gotten old

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): ; Charli constantly knows how to open an album

**amiriteor** (9.7): i wanna do coke ?

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): every lyric is a potential insta caption

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): kinda feelin like a slut in this pic, might delete later idk tho

**Palutzel** (9.5): it goes hard and it's only the intro

**seanderlust** (9.5): well this does go hard

**artzpop** (9): this song makes me go feral

**celladonn** (9): me when i just wanna go real hard

**conceptualromance** (9): thank u bennifer

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): If this song is an actual pink diamond in the flesh, it would definitely be too hot to touch cause this song goes off.

**iniekcja\_** (9): Lil Uzi Vert is shaking

**izeaklapaucius** (9): getting jojo siwa vibe from this beat

**ktajlili** (9): i love this intro because it's so chaotic and high energy.

**mudkip1** (9): fuck i hated this when it first dropped but whatever it slaps

**nick1372** (9): sometimes you just wanna go real hard idk what else to say

**pig-serpent** (9): After the experimental bangers Click and I Shake it, Pink Diamond is what I wanted a Charli album to sound like. An early favorite and I was disappointed at first there wasn't more like it, but over time I realized that 2020 just wasn't the time for a Pink Diamond Summer and I overall prefer the sound of the rest of the album because of it.

**Qustomar** (9): Edgy Charli is maybe my fave genre of Charli? Would've given a 10 or 11 if this was a full song but it works very well as an intro, kinda the successor of Next Level Charli.

**SupremeShani** (9): A fantastic opener, I think Charli's clean and straightforward songwriting really benefits when it's paired up with the harshest hyperpop sounds possible like this.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): elle woods would approve of this song title

**thedoctordances1940** (9): this goes hard!

**vayyiqra** (9): Abrasive but it bangs.

**waluigiest** (9): pop off steven universe

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): My favorite car crash song

**UselessTacooo** (8.9): iconic

**1998tweety** (8.5): I must admit this is quite good, the chorus is mega catchy

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I too just want to go real hard

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): "Got a tiny bag but I got a big heart" who can relate

**throwaway7650** (8.5): is it weird to consider this song kind of like a sequel to vroom vroom? anyway this is my favorite song on HIFN, hope it does well!

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): its a good song but it is just a low rent next level charli. previous level charli, you might say.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): This feels so specific to the early quarantine period before we all settled into general apathy and despair

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): so true

**juanolsen** (8.4): best way to open the album, the production is great and Charli's lyrics are clever and fun ask always

**Dekubaku** (8.2): Pink Diamond right out says how hard the album is going to go. And it does!

**hakkerj** (8.2): Get me out of this quarantine cage right NOW

**jman457** (8.2): such a ‚Äúhard‚Äù way to open an album

**salivantsonority** (8.1): It's just the industrial moment. Charli invented concrete, probably.

**akanewasright** (8): BOP

**EnCaine** (8): it goes real hard

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This song is legitimately insane? There are several songs on this album that feel like almost a 2020 answer to Charli‚Äôs 2019 album Charli ‚Äì this intro track is most definitely an updated version of ‚ÄúNext Level Charli‚Äù to me ‚Äì grimy in the best way

**lagozzino** (8): I swear half the shit y'all call hyperpop is just late 00s industrial club mixes.

**nooodisaster** (8): I'm obsessed with the entire first verse of this. "Lip gloss on and I'm lookin' like a star / Got a tiny bag, but I got a big heart / On the video chat, cute skirt and a bra / I'm feeling so fine, kinda feelin' like a slut"

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this is a good opener for this album, and i love the sheer amount of noise happening? i feel like this dropping at a concert would make me lose my shit

**poptartchill** (8): it's a catchy opener

**pros-and-connors** (8): this song has Bimini Bon Boulash energy and no one can tell me otherwise

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): One of her better opening tracks methinks!

**zagreux** (8): https://imgur.com/a/3Jso1dx

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): I do really want to go real hard ... but I‚Äôm still unvaccinated in a panera

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Why am I not hating this more

**geraldinewww** (7.5): don't we all just wanna go real hard

**J\_Toe** (7): The first time I listened to Pop2 (particularly Track 10) I noped out of there as the sound was too aggressive and unfamiliar. But I quickly came back to the EP. I had a similar response to Shake It on Charli. I skipped the song half way through as it was too aggressive, but returned after singing it to myself over and over again the next week. Pink Diamond is the equivalent track for this album. I initially hated it, but it's now one of my favourites :)

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): wish it was longer tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): As wild and abrasive as this song is‚Ä¶ I kinda wish it were longer haha

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): not bad? Not what I expected. I actually enjoy the verses

# Are you that blue light

**cashewconstellation** (7.2): not bad, like the energy but it could benefit from being longer and more fleshed out

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It goes real hard but it's a bit repetitive.

**jasannn** (7): She has done better abrasive songs.

**jayjaysortagay** (7): pew pew

=====

Awkward_King: **Roxieloxie** (7): I have like 4 funny comments but I dont think they would be appreciated here so i will simply ask why specifically a pink diamond in the dark

**ReallyCreative** (6.7): I just think her continuously traumatizing Steven Universe from the grave was a girlboss move

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): wild Metapod anthem!

**oscarbrierley1** (6): a bit repetitive, kinda feels like it's missing something

**Alumineous** (5): I just find this so irritating to listen to.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): steven universe fans dni

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): I found it repetitive and irritating with the auto tune and the like.

**frogaranaman** (5): this production is wild but doesn‚Äôt really do much for me in the end

**KennyEarthman** (5): the instrumental is a gem, however the chorus is extremely irritating

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (5): Fun, but gets kind of repetitive and the 2 minute runtime feels.....long?

**liberalitea** (5): her worst intro by far tbh but this is rapping charli (read:talking) which is one of my favourite charlis

**Vultuxe** (5): Not sold on this intro, it has extreme competition though. All of her previous intros are 10's -- and one 11 -- however, pink diamond fails to impress me with its abrasive production, repetition, and noisy outro.

**wavingwolves** (5): i'm still not completely sold on this one

**engifear** (4): I never quite got the hype for this song. It's very intense with little relief and feels fairly repetitive.

**jsonphile** (4): okay sorry I don‚Äôt get this

**Turpamutteri** (4): yeah it's not for me

**savemeaseat143** (3.5): I like singable songs

**IIIHenryIII** (3): Just because you want, doesn't mean you should.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I do not like this.

**notarobot3675** (3): Confession... I think this is a really poor choice for intro song.

**runaway3212** (3): this is messy in the worst way, the only weak song on this record

**shhhneak** (3): I‚Äôm more of a blue diamond in the light gal ??

**urfavgalpal** (2.4): okay so I had a slightly higher score for this and more positive comment but then I did my relisten of the album and.....i didn‚Äôt even make it a full minute into the song before I skipped it which is kind of a big deal for me cause I like to listen to albums all the way through, no skips cause that‚Äôs how the artist intended it.  I mean thats the entire reason this song is one of my most listened to, but I guess it‚Äôs been so long since I listened to the album that I don‚Äôt have as much of a tolerance for it.  This song captures the claustrophobia of quarantine really well but I like.....don‚Äôt like this song very much which I think is a controversial opinion among angels. This is actually my least favorite of her post-Vroom Vroom opening tracks.  (NLC > Dreamer > Backseat > Pink Diamond just btw)   Also I feel like there‚Äôs a Steven Universe joke in here somewhere but I‚Äôm not funny enough to make it.  I don‚Äôt know i feel like when I listen to it I‚Äôm just sitting in melody-less noise.  There‚Äôs some neat stuff in there but yeah not really my cup of tea

**bespectacIed** (1): uzi

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): its a bad bitch song but not iconic or an anthem

**lolcevan** (1): rose quartz outsold her

**afs** (0): I'm sorry but this is less music and more just terrible autotuned rapping over noise

**BoneStreetSand** (0): Sorry girlies, this was my least favourite song of the bunch. Good news was that literally every song that came after it was much better!

**SmileAndTears** (0): noise... insufferable walls of noise

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i'm suddenly straight

The intro to this sounds kinda video game esque right? I'm not crazy in thinking that??? It sounds like the Mario pipe noise. Anyway, this song grew on me massively, I think I had it as a 1 or a 2 when I was first accepting ballots and have gradually upped it as I've kept bopping to it. It's cheesy as fuck, but that's Carly and I think you have to embrace it at the end of the day. Disappointed it is out day 1 but I also think I am in part responsible looking at my score so I guess I can't be too sad :grinny:

---

# Know what falling in love is 'sposed to feel like

**Leixander** (11): Love at first listen, everything is just perfect here.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): the chorus on this is soo catchy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is from the 80s. No one can tell me otherwise.

**EnCaine** (10): i dont know music production at all but the kind of squishy(?? help me please i dont know how to describe it) bass that's on this song instantly makes me like anything. song would still be good even without it

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs in the whole rate, counterpoint of this kind isn‚Äôt something we hear in pop music a lot so I can only attribute this to Carly‚Äôs musical theatre side jumping out. It helps that both melodies are really good and actually have something to say about each other too

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): I love how bouncy and summery this is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song is so fucking HAPPY!!!!!!

**jasannn** (10): that outro is amazing

**jman457** (10): Both Vibey and Anthemic, a perfect pop song

**runaway3212** (10): this layering is great

**waluigiest** (10): okay yeah this is the naive, smitten, horny Carly I know and love

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): The bridge and last chorus are so good

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): big road trip vibes

**cashewconstellation** (9.6): a BOP, the "i like to give as good as i get (GOOD AS I GET)" always makes me scream

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): the last minute of this song absolutely transcends

**Alumineous** (9): The hook gets a bit repetitive, but otherwise, it's a good track.

**artzpop** (9): The bridge makes me go crazy stupid aaahh

**bbfan132** (9): such an infectious song, love the production

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The production in this so good. I am glad she included this in the B-side album.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): God I am such a heaux for a good ass synth backing, also WHO exactly is saying these things miss Carly?

**jaztinax** (9): i feel like this would go well with june gloom by allie x as a mashup... can someone try

**notarobot3675** (9): one of my says on this album

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This is a highlight from either version of Dedicated, it's bouncy, fun and fresh.

**vagenda** (8.7): The lone survivor of the Disco Sweat era that escaped Carly‚Äôs backyard and blessed us all with its sublime boppery

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): super interesting pop track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): A classic CRJ bop.

**frogaranaman** (8): that synth is godsend but the chorus could be a bit ‚Äòmore‚Äô

**IIIHenryIII** (8): A 10, this is what this song would have gotten hadn't the chorus been overshadowed by the verses and the bridge.

**ManofOranges** (8): Me telling my friend what people say behind their back.

**nick1372** (8): The hook is a bit too wordy for my taste, but I like the sentiment

**savemeaseat143** (8): the last 30 seconds saves it

**throwaway7650** (8): the chorus is so addicting

**Vromega** (8): This chorus stays in my mind during hours and it annoys me. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY

**1998tweety** (7.5): something is missing but shes cute

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): "I like to give as good as I get"?? Vers pegging queen confirmed

**wavingwolves** (7.4): i'm disappointed about the fact she's singing ''delicate'' instead of ''dedicated'' in this

**afs** (7): Lots and lots of 90s videogame sounds here.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): We say......bop

**NotWith10000Men** (7): okay this one is a little bit of a bop. I like the chanty aspect of the chorus.

**Oberionsynth** (7): girly singing over the pacman soundtrack

**poptartchill** (7): I like it but it has soft choreo vibes

**KennyEarthman** (6): I love the video game-y synths

# Fuckin losers

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I‚Äôm too cynical and lonely for this

**amiriteor** (7.2): GIRL we fucking get it you wrote the same song 3 times

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Kind of a forgettable track in this one but it's not bad at all. Like the backing vocals but it's just hard to make this one stand out especially amongst a rather homogenous tracklist.

**conceptualromance** (7): I like the vocals at the beginning of the bridge a lot. Overall I don‚Äôt think the song quite works, though

**juanolsen** (7): a little bit forgettable and bland

**Qustomar** (7): This song is alright but what it brings to the table that a lot of other Dedicated Side B songs don't for me is ENERGY.

**hakkerj** (6.9): This song is SO weird. Every time I listen to it I always want more from it though

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): i would‚Äôve expected this to be more quotable given the title but its so forgettable

**liberalitea** (6.5): this is overwhelmingly decent

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): No one says that, but yes

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I always felt like this was a filler track, though it contains everything that could make a top tier Carly song. Still, it just doesn't click the right way as much as it should.

**urfavgalpal** (6.4): Ive had times where I really enjoyed this song and times when I find it to be very boring and I was listening over and over again trying to figure out what it was and then I realized that I like this song when I am cooking or otherwise not paying attention to the song and am casually singing along but I don‚Äôt like actively listening to it.  I like bits and pieces of this song, specifically I like Carly‚Äôs delivery of the lyrics.  I do not like the instrumentals very much though and I find them kind of boring.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): it's giving me budget Kylie

**musical\_pyn** (6): the end is good but I don't know if I'm willing to listen to the rest to get there all the time

**seanderlust** (6): i really don't like the harmony on "falling in loove's supposed to feel like"

**SmileAndTears** (6): Idk man this is too sugary for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6): eh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I think this song is the epitome of my issues with this album: the music sound amazing, but the lyrics are all kinda... lacking

**nooodisaster** (5.5): The bridge is interesting but nothing else is.

**SupremeShani** (5.5): I absolutely love the way she delivers the "got me feeling confident" line, and the fact that she accurately portrays the feeling of falling in love with this song by being just as disappointing.

**salivantsonority** (5.3): The melody's just a bit strange to me.

**Stryxen** (5): Gayle: I haven't heard any of my gay friends use this phrase. Oprah: I've never heard this from any gay person, no.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): meh

**cremeebrulee** (4): this is what they say falling asleep is supposed to feel like

**CrimsonROSET** (4): If this is what it feels like, maybe I‚Äôm better off alone.

**fairytalehigh** (4): if this is what they say falling in love's supposed to feel like... YIKES

**welcometoNY** (4): i really just can't get into this one. it's frustrating because the verses are great and then the chorus is such a letdown.

**zagreux** (3): the 'feels like, feels like' after she says this is what they say falling in love is supposed to feel like is very annoying and unecessary

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Sounds really tired and lifeless.

**akanewasright** (0): I used to have a 2 for this song, because I genuinely find it dull as hell and grating at the same time. But I gave it a bonus point because the ‚Äúgot me feeling dedicated‚Äù line in the first verse was cute. After hearing that she‚Äôs singing something else there, I feel straight up betrayed. Learning that one of the things I liked was... not a thing sent me over the edge.

**pig-serpent** (0): A weird slowed down synthwave song meant to have a feel good summer vibe and fairly ok melodies. I hate the weird choppy synths on this one.

This is so slept on it's criminal, it's so goddamn fun, if this was entirely in English I just know it would've made day 3 :woeis:. Regardless, I'm happy it made it as far as it did, being a song not even available on streaming platforms for most of the world, and I'm happy I only got very few comments referencing Gwen Stefani on this song.

# Abolish region locking

**salivantsonority** (11): THIS NOT OFFICIALLY BEING ON THE RECORD REMAINS HIGHWAY ROBBERY. What a dope ass bitch track. Blows your fuckin' socks off.

**conceptualromance** (10): she‚Äôs sick for keeping this from us

**CrimsonROSET** (10): its a smasha, but i wish it came BEFORE snakeskin.

**liberalitea** (10): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i am LIVING

**nootnoot781** (10): no she‚Äôs sick for not including this on the album???? this is a bop omg

**plastichaxan** (10): rina sweetie why didn't this make it and lm4m did‚Ä¶ we need to talk

**seanderlust** (10): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm headbanging

**sirpancakeXI** (10): she is so wrong for not putting it on streaming

**Stryxen** (10): spelling is fun joke

**throwaway7650** (10): this is actually so good? omg, hope this doesn't tank

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Oh how I wish this song was on Spotify. It combines the best parts of different songs off of the album into one frankenstein-esque monster of a bop

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Release this internationally challenge

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): put it on Spotify RINA

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Yeah this bangs and I hoped it would be included on the deluxe version

**cremeebrulee** (9): deserved to be on the main album

**EnCaine** (9): i didn't know this existed WHAT

**juanolsen** (9): japanese speaking rina is the best rina

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (9): I had never heard this before, but okay Rina, this goes hard

**musical\_pyn** (9): why is this an exclusive!!!

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's fun and it's unfortunate that I cannot stream it

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Put this on Spotify queen I‚Äôm begging

**wavingwolves** (9): i feel like this will be bottom 5 and undeservedly so because it's amazing

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): ; she‚Äôs sick for not putting this on the official album

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): https://imgur.com/a/lyYTrBg

**1998tweety** (8.5): SMASHA get this on streaming NOW

**jman457** (8.5): sure its probably best in the Bonus rate but it sill slaps.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): [feminism](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/739218471535116341/846503317706506300/unknown.png)

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): the whole "cheerleader metal" vibe reminds me of "kill v maim" or sleigh bells, would love to hear more of this sound

**Palutzel** (8.3): first listen for me, crazy good song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): this was new to me during this rate, I feel like such a fake Rina stan! It goes off!!

**akanewasright** (8): This is a bop and a half, but I 100% get why she left this off the main album. She fucked up by not putting it on the deluxe though

**CarlieScion** (8): this could‚Äôve been in camp rock

**cashewconstellation** (8): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm living

**celladonn** (8): I've never heard this before! Secret bop unlocked...

**CreepyMannequin** (8): wait this goes off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I like how most of the song is in Japanese. It's no wonder why reserved this as a Japanese bonus track. Would be nice to see this on streaming tho!

**frogaranaman** (8): I cannot believe this is region locked wtf

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I guess I like this one?

**just\_thonking** (8): wait now I'm mad you made me listen to this song because I like it and it's not on spotify >:(

**KennyEarthman** (8): oh wow I'm glad I listen to music on YouTube cuz I heard this wasn't on Spotify, y'all are missing out

**ktajlili** (8): only heard this song once but it was fun.

**ManofOranges** (8): It's cute

**moooo566** (8): At least she saved the least great song on the album for the exclusive, I guess?

**mudkip1** (8): love the verses but dont like the chorus

**Oberionsynth** (8): why are the best songs never on the streaming services T.T

**racloves** (8): she was evil for not releasing this worldwide I‚Äôm considering tracking down a Japan cd tbh

**runaway3212** (8): should've been on the main album

**skargardin** (8): region exclusive tracks must be stopped

**slimboyfriend** (8): She should've taken one of the two weak tracks off the album and put this one between STFU! and Comme De Gar√ßons

**SupremeShani** (8): I will never like region locked album tracks, but it's Rina so all is forgiven. Am I a bad Pixel for not even knowing this song existed before this rate though?

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow I didn't know this existed. I've always wanted to hear Rina do a whole song in Japanese and this gives an idea of what that'd be like.

**amiriteor** (7.9): i would def like it more if i listened to club bangers more often but if this came on at a club i would def take 2 shots of vodka no prob

**Dekubaku** (7.8): Discovering this song just right now. Good song but IMO, snakeskin was the right ending, IMO.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I can see why Rina didn't include this on the standard edition, it's a good track but it doesn't really fit anywhere in the tracklist nicely

**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): This was fun, this was festive; I wish it wasn‚Äôt region locked so I could shove it onto my hype songs playlist. It‚Äôs like Hollaback Girls but unironically good!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): why is this region locked RUDE

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): why does japan get all the bops

# Spelling is not fun!

**NecroDolphinn** (7.2): Hey Kids Spelling Is Fun!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I don't really mind this song as a whole, maybe it's because the song is on YouTube but the mix just feels really muddy, I have a feeling that the guitar jams interpolated throughout are supposed to feel just as electrifying as in XS, but they just come off as a bit blunt. The way they did Rina's vocals are also kind of weird, not a big fan of her doing this cheerleading thing, methinks. Still not a really bad track as a Deluxe track (No, this isn't the closer, at least not officially...) that is pretty sticky and decently hard-hitting.

**afs** (7): annoyed that I had to listen to this seperately but also get why it's Japan only lol, reminds me a bit of MANiCURE

**hikkaru** (7): i do kinda see why this is not on the actual album

**nick1372** (7): production on this kind of gives me a headache and I‚Äôm not sure what purpose the chorus serves? Still I do like the concept of the song and it definitely adds to the album as a whole when included.

**nooodisaster** (7): she did what she had to do

**NotWith10000Men** (7): tell me why I want to watch all of teen titans now?

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): i don't understand the inclusion, and i don't love the dated sound here. it legit sounds like it's from 2007, not just referencing it. and the x-tina staaaaaaaay part is just eugh. we don't even like it when she does that.

**Raykel** (7): Has anyone noticed that Rina's music on some platforms is so loud? Like if I watch her insta stories I know I'm gonna have to turn the volume down or else an audio clip of one of her song's might come blasting in and startle me...like it did with this youtube video lol.

**SmileAndTears** (7): ok

**urfavgalpal** (6.7): if this had been on the original album maybe I would have listened to this enough times that it grew on me and I liked it.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad necessarily I‚Äôm just not into the sound much.  Maybe it‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs made to appeal to a music market that I‚Äôm not a part of

**camerinian** (6.5): Is the vocal mixing locked behind a different region too

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): queen of region locking

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I was really fucking with it until the spelling, unfortunately that took me right out of the song.

**bbfan132** (6): the concept is cool but the production sounds off and it brings the song down for me‚Ä¶ :/

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I remember liking this more than I actually do.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): the mixing (?) on the vocals isn‚Äôt the best, but the production on this is impeccable and I really wish that she did more songs in Japanese

Awkward_King: **Turpamutteri** (6): The lesser song that has "Tokyo" in the title

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): brb looking at Tokyo on Google Maps to figure out where the neighborhoods are

**AHSWeeknd** (5): This sounds exactly like an early unreleased Gaga track.

**Alumineous** (5): I had high expectations. But in the end, I didn't like it. Vocals are way too buried, compressed and processed, production is less refined, and lastly, Akasaka Sad, Tokyo Love Hotel, and co. are the same lyrically as this song, but are better in every way. I also did the same with Jessie Ware on the Nu-Disco rate, like I don't understand why people rave about Overtime and Please so much. Those two songs also never grew with me, too. Guess I don't like bonus tracks by my favourite artists.

**izeaklapaucius** (5): i pretend i do not hear it

**lagozzino** (5): This is the Tokyo equivalent of Taylor's "London Boy".

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I see why this was left off of the standard album!

**Uberpigeon** (5): im glad this isnt on spotify

**pig-serpent** (4): My brain refuses to focus on this song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This feels kind of blown out.

**martian\_pet** (0): not my favorite yet it's a crime this song its not available to stream

**thedoctordances1940** (0): Most of the song is just a bit generic and doesn't really stand out, the only thing that does manage to stand out is the cheerleader chanting and let's just say it doesn't stand out in a good way, it is absolutely, completely and utterly awful.

# Please dont compare a song by an actual asian artist where they are speaking actual Japanese to a song by a white artist which is very culturally appropriative of Japanese culture :)

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Harajuku Girls (Rina‚Äôs Version). Pre-chorus is super addictive though.

Is it ethically wrong to bust it down to a song that includes a voicenote of the artist in therapy? Is it morally questionable to fucking pop it to a song about torturing yourself by loving somebody too much? Is it fucking rude that the shitpost I wanted to use that was a two minute video demonstrating why Bowser is actually a very good father didn't work because you cannot add child friendly videos to playlists with non child friendly videos in it? The answer to one of these questions is yes.

# Baby you're my best-ie-ie

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Which British soap did she sample in this?

**Alumineous** (10): Charli needs all the 10s from me. The production is gorgeous. I love the meaning of this song. It's very related to Bad Friend, in a way.

**bespectacIed** (10): god this is excellent..

**conceptualromance** (10): idk this one just sounds soooo good to me

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): fun song about being paranoid about your significant other and intimacy as whole. Reminds me of the Hedgehog‚Äôs Dilemma hence the ten lol.

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably my favorite on the album? For some reason I am really sold on the songs where Charli contemplates on her relationships

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite Charli songs, I love how she sings about vulnerability on here and how hard it can be open to someone you are close to without having their fear of losing the person and becoming emotionally wrecked after getting close.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the catchiest song on the record for me, she makes the inherent danger in getting close to someone so appealing

**seeyanever** (10): Can you find something wrong with this? Lyrically? Gorge. Vocally? Gorge. The sound choices? Gorge.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Lovers to Enemies, Or Is It?, Angst, Character Study, Songfic, Canon Compliant, 354 words

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Every time I do a rate there is usually one song per album that I realize I‚Äôve been sleeping on, and for this it is this one

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): "it hurts here, it like HURTS here" i know girl i knowwww

**UselessTacooo** (9.2): MAYBE YOUR MA ENEMYYYY

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Think this is one of Charli's better vocal performances, love the post-chorus to this as well

**afs** (9): 80s synths, my saviour, comes to boost my hopes, yet it's so unmistakeably Charli.

**akanewasright** (9): I love the three track stretch from detonate to IFU, and this is the best of the lot. Just three songs about how much quarantining with a significant other just kinda sucks, and this is the one that feels the truest for some reason.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh this is a fun song! I like this one! I do!

**ReallyCreative** (9): GIVE ME THOSE STARCRAFT TERRAN THEME GUITARS!!!! Additional supply depots required for this slay!

**seanderlust** (9): shaking my ass to a song containing a recording of the artist talking to her therapist

**juanolsen** (8.8): i loved the concept behind this track and i think it's well executed

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): I don't know how I feel about the literal clip from Charli's therapy session, but the rest of the song is nice enough

**urfavgalpal** (8.6): my least favorite of my favorite tracks on this album but I still quite love it and I think it‚Äôs so integral to the narrative this section of the album tells.  It‚Äôs one of those songs I maybe don‚Äôt love as much on its own but I think is the most brilliant thing in the context of the album.  Like that voice note at the end where she says she finally understands and then it kicks into high gear and goes to I finally understand?  Brilliant.  And I think it‚Äôs great for right after detonate cause it‚Äôs like she detonated and now she‚Äôs having these self-doubts and all that.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I trust people too easily so I cannot process over a possibility that a future boyfriend of mine could be an enemy. ??

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): one of my early standouts

**ggal2020** (8.2): every time something bad happens to me I say ‚Äúit hurts here, it hurts. yeah.‚Äù in my head

**wavingwolves** (8.1): my biggest enemy is me pop a 911

**bbfan132** (8): probably my least favorite track on hifn but it‚Äôs still good, nice production

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a really cool lyrical concept.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maybe the true enemy were the friends we made along the way? I‚Äôll get back to you on this one

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I love how this song is so chill but still has that Charli vibe. Not a big fan of the chorus though.

**musical\_pyn** (8): one of my favorites from the album

**vayyiqra** (8): 80s as hell which is Good

**plastichaxan** (7.8): in the words of detox: "i ain't saying it's the best but it ain't the worst" (in this rate)

**hakkerj** (7.7): The chorus solidifies this song for me, probably my least favorite on the album though

**geraldinewww** (7.6): charli spending her quarantine writing songs for her 160k work enemies to lovers fic huh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): ok I hate spoken bits of songs in the middle of a song (babes spending too much time with Matty Healy :/ ) but the chorus is a straight banger

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): the hook is reallyy catchy. i love it

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): good, i like it, almost as much as to add it to my liked songs

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): probably the most ‚Äúpop‚Äù friendly track on HIFN, but even though this is less experimental its one of the strongest songs here

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Outtro here is great

**NotWith10000Men** (7): cute bop! The effects on her voice work better on this song

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): i love the vibes, i love how homegrown it is, i just wish it was a bit bigger. i feel like there was room for this song to explode into animal collective level chaos and it just doesn't. but it's so good!

# Enemies of XCXheads

**amiriteor** (7): eh

**hikkaru** (7): girl who asked for your monologue

**jasannn** (7): Alexa play My Nemesis from Phineas and Ferb.

**nick1372** (7): this one kinda gets lost in the album but it‚Äôs a really cool and unique concept

**runaway3212** (7): I like this song, but I feel like the theme has been done better on this album

**salivantsonority** (7): Bit forgettable.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): i just hate spoken parts in songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i feel like i'd really like this if there was a little extra oomph somewhere

**throwaway7650** (7): nice chorus, song feels kind of slow though

**wasian-invasion** (7): damn she really took the whole music as therapy concept and made it therapy as music

**camerinian** (6.5): I don't actually return to this one as much sssshhhh don't tell the comment section of my writeup

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6.5): A nice slower song from Charli but nothing super groundbreaking

**KennyEarthman** (6): kinda wished it picked up tho, not a fan of slower hyperpop

**nooodisaster** (6): I appreciate how personal the track is to her but it's not my fav.

**skargardin** (6): cute lyrics but it's kinda whelming

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): the instrumental sounds like the music that plays on Forensic Files when it returns from commercial break

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The intro got me really hyped for an epic, Kiss It Better-esque power ballad, but sadly the rest of the track did not live up to my presumptions...

**jman457** (5.9): this song kind of bores me ngl

**cremeebrulee** (5): i used to really dislike this and its still my least favorite on hifn, but i‚Äôve come around to not giving this a 0. i appreciate the story behind it but i also wouldn‚Äôt miss it if it were cut from the album.

**frogaranaman** (5): really wasn‚Äôt my favorite single during the rollout and hearing it in the context of the album did nothing for the song

**mudkip1** (5): ah, a typical charli mid album track

**Oberionsynth** (5): i'll be honest i just listened to this song and i can't even remember it enough to rate it

**Vultuxe** (5): Enemy falls under the same category as a few other songs on this record where the hook does not click with me and the lyrics are subpar with little to say about them other than I guess this is fine.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Charli made an enemy when she released *Pop 2*‚Ä¶ it was me

**liberalitea** (4): this is pretty boring sonically compared to rest of the album and the sample is unnecessary imo

**SupremeShani** (4): Maybe we all are our enemies.

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): Spotify stuffed every single playlist with this song at one point, and it's not even good, I am TIRED.

Believe it or not, this is my favourite Rina song. This is probably one of my favourite songs point blank, I find it so addictive to replay, and if the bonus songs were included in the main rate, honestly my 11 decision would've been between this and ringtone, none of the main songs would have been in the picture. I still maintain this would have served as a great interlude between XS and STFU! if it were included in the regular tracklisting, as it tackles themes similar to XS in worker exploitation and existing in the working class, while also leading perfectly into STFU! with the literal screaming outro. Pretty heartbroken for it to be out day 1 ngl, and for it to complete the 1-2-3 of Rina going out straight away, but at least it was pretty unanimously the best of the three hahaha

---

# Workers' rights!

**akanewasright** (10): this fucks idc

**amiriteor** (10): I'M A CAPITALIST almost my 11......

**KennyEarthman** (10): those screams are so satisfying

**liberalitea** (10): i love marxism

**sarcasticsobs** (10): make it LONGER

**skargardin** (10): are we ready for the conversation of this being a ten?

**geraldinewww** (9.9): why yes rina i do like to party

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): This is cute, it sounds almost like a HOLYCHILD track, very bratpop

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9): low key awful, but i love it

**fairytalehigh** (9): in my 2020 pop girl headcanon "bees & honey" is the name of the cereal that triggers charli's anxiety attack in "anthems" and this is its jingle. i need therapy

**frogaranaman** (9): wtf why is this fully fleshed out idea and well executed song shorter than three minutes and thirty seconds to four minutes and fifteen seconds, this is absolutely unacceptable and I demand that song be longer. the streaming era has ruined song lengths

**hakkerj** (9): it would be a 10 if it were 90 seconds longer

**runaway3212** (9): honey is overrated but this song is good

**SupremeShani** (9): i actually would love to see this developed into a longer song, i guess rina said you can have more anti capitalism, and it even ends with distorted screaming this time

**TiltControls** (9): buzz buzz

**notarobot3675** (8.9): the chorus goes off

**bbfan132** (8.5): short but fun as hell

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is low-key giving me M.I.A. teas.

**EnCaine** (8.5): i want to mash this up with a bratz rock angelz song

**nick1372** (8.5): better than XS tbh

**seanderlust** (8.3): BANGER

**jasannn** (8.2): I'm so surprised this song is only 1:47 long but it feels so full.

**jman457** (8.2): my favs from the extended version of the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): So is overconsumption good or bad Rina, which is it?

**lolcevan** (8): THIS SONG IS TOO FUCKING SHORT!!!!!! ??

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8): SAME RINA I'm broke too

**plastichaxan** (8): too short

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Very very catchy, but the lyrics are a bit weaker than some of her other tracks

**vayyiqra** (8): Got some extra points for being incredibly silly but making it work somehow.

**welcome2thejam** (8): An extra point for that insane last 20 seconds or so

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): My parents never gave me the talk and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm gay

**throwaway7650** (7.5): overhated, I say as this song is tied for my lowest bonus rate score (so technically it's the worst song in the bonus rate for me?)

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): is this vaguely anti-capitalism? Kinda hard to tell

**urfavgalpal** (7.2): when this one hits it really hits and when it doesn‚Äôt it really misses.

**wavingwolves** (7.2): why isn't this longer :(

**afs** (7): There's SO much going on in this sub 2 minute track, and before you know it it's over.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I really thought there was a Beyonc√© Party sample

# Fuck the working class

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): one of those songs where I like what its about more than I actually like hearing it

**ggal2020** (6): I think I can safely say it‚Äôs a good thing none of the bonus tracks were on the main album. here for the anti-capitalism though.

**musical\_pyn** (6): incredible hook but not much else

**Oberionsynth** (6): I beez in the trap

**pig-serpent** (6): lol

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): what did i just say rina. this is a mark ronson track. in the year 2020, you made a 2003 mark ronson track. you should be ashamed of yourself. and go listen to early mark ronson if you haven't, it's so bad it's good.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): A little bit annoying

**iniekcja\_** (5.5): this is cluttered, and I love cluttered, but this is cluttered in a bad way

**pat-rickstar** (5): It's meh, the outro is weird. There must have been better unreleased tracks to put on the deluxe

**fadedblue09** (4): Kinda embarrassing

**jsonphile** (4): sorry rina I love you but this ain‚Äôt it

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song is a bit too much metal and not enough pop for me to enjoy...

**1998tweety** (3): no

**Vultuxe** (3): The hell is this lol. Why did we have to end on this

**Alumineous** (2): Wow. This is shit. This is Rina's Monday Blues. I'm also thinking Birthday by Selena Gomez, and I also don't like that song.

**cashewconstellation** (1): why did she have to do that

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): This sounds like a song the antagonist band in a Disney Channel Original Movie would sing

**IIIHenryIII** (1): What's with the male voice on this? Let me get back to the actual album to wash my ears.

**waluigiest** (1): she REALLY knew which songs to cut from the standard album

**xaviersi** (1): THIS AINT IT RINA I AM SO SORRY

and introducing my co-host for this singular song...

**Roxieloxie** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG. Im not even joking when i say that if this was in the main rate it would be my 11, i literally am obsessed with this song. Its not on spotify and im tired of spotify deleting my local files every time i try to add it. this song came out and i litterally had a day where i looped it on youtube for an hour straight while i danced around my room and took pictures and im not even joking when i say that was one of my best summer moments from lockdown (last summers version). like how can you hate this song???? its so perfect and fun i want to be in the world that this song creates its pure serotonin, miss jepson i am begging you to put this song on streaming because it makes me so happy. Like truly just no thoughts just fun summery vibes. ON THE ROAD FOR HALF THE YEAR AND REAL LOVES JUST A SONG I GUESS I AND I FEEL LIKE THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, OR SOMETHING ABOUT ME

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This ain't it Carly. I'm sorry. As a fan, I really wish I'd like this, but...

**jasannn** (4): Why do I have a crush on her sax player? He's so cute. He does an amazing job during performances of Let's Get Lost.

**KennyEarthman** (4): boring and never goes anywhere

**TragicKingdom1** (4): the fact that this has <1 million views on youtube despite that being the only place to stream it is sending me

WHY DID ALL OF YOU HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS SAYING POTTY 4 U WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?????

---

# I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna throw potties

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Hard not to love this song from how oddly sentimental it is in how Charli pours her love out so openly, love how the instrumental swells at the end.

**bespectacIed** (10): Still jawdroppingly beautiful. Magnum opus type of song. Best song on album tied with 7 years

**Brendon-Urine** (10): the only grower for me from this album. I thought it was meh at first but it just clicked out of nowhere for me and it's stunning. The charli choir? EXCUSE ME?

**cremeebrulee** (10): this the clit of the album

**ggal2020** (10): as a hardcore angel, the process of this release was incredible. the parody lyrics about umru being on lanaboards, the ‚Äúleaked‚Äù backing track on her sub, the come to my party fakeout. so iconic. what a moment in angel history.

**hunnybee12** (10): it's definitely a grower but i love it now it's so hopelessly romantic and sweet

**iniekcja\_** (10): true romance ??????

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): For a song with party in the title, this is such a mellow track; adding this to my sad rave playlist

**ManofOranges** (10): Kind of catchy!

**nooodisaster** (10): YOU COULD WATCH ME PULL UP ON YOUR BODY LIKE ITS SUMMER-- Look, this song is just such a serve. The narrative is so clear, the emotions so poignant, the bop so severe. "Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?" still hits like a bag of sand.

**nootnoot781** (10): why is it still sending me that people thought this would be a repackaged ‚Äúcome to my party‚Äù

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Another VERY close contender for my 11. The idea of throwing a party for someone, and they don't even show up, or rather, the fear that they won't, is heartbreaking, and the track does a fantastic job at conveying that. The instrumental being the party happening in the background, people having fun, but Charli can't focus on anything but wanting that one person to walk through the door, for them to be here, to be with them and to see that Charli appreciates them. She's trying to dance and party, but her mind is only thinking of one thing.

**runaway3212** (10): I'm so happy she released this it's literally so great, also we need the host to play 'come to my party' after this

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): this is soo sweet

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): sad twerk intensifies

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): party on you party on you pottyonu partyonu

**bbfan132** (9.5): the intro and outro are both gorgeous

**conceptualromance** (9.5): gatsby moment

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I find it interesting how two of these albums transition from track 9 to track 10 by including crowd cheering sounds like a live show

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): Definitely my favorite song on the album! So raw and emotional and I love the lyrics on this one even if they are trademark Charli repetitive. The intro still makes me a bit sad and reminds me of last summer

**fenellabeach** (9.3): luxe

**jman457** (9.3): This albums track 10

**hakkerj** (9.2): She wrote this song for me after I had my quarantine Animal Crossing birthday party.

**1998tweety** (9): this is actually really good wtf, i kept getting scared that it would go batshit at a point but thankfully it didnt

**AHSWeeknd** (9): she raps??

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I almost cried when this started playing‚Ä¶ I was like finally‚Ä¶ a song‚Ä¶ thank you mother Charli

**liberalitea** (9): come to my party was the better of the party songs on xcx world but this is still great

**pig-serpent** (9): Maybe a little too repetitive, but it is catchy as all heck and there's plenty of instrumental variety. Also there's an extended callback to Next Level Charli, and that's cool because Next Level Charli rules.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): the layered vocals, the harmonies, the effects, the all of it. great song!

**Qustomar** (9): The cheering at the end makes me sad :,

**wasian-invasion** (9): aww this just exudes complete love

**juanolsen** (8.8): cute

**amiriteor** (8.5): I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.

**Leixander** (8.5): potty4u

**salivantsonority** (8.5): A nice, earnest track. I want to see a lip sync to this track, especially the long passages where she doesn't take a breath.

**seanderlust** (8.5): party on, garth! party on, wayne!

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I think I‚Äôm going to stop giving reasons now

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): wtf I love The Great Gatsby now

**bigbigbee** (8): The instrumental to this sounds like Zelda dungeon music, but from the handheld games where there isn‚Äôt unique music in each dungeon. Anyway I like that, so

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I want to go to this party but also the idea of it kind of scares me.

**cashewconstellation** (8): i didn't like it at first but then it grew on me, very good

**Dekubaku** (8): Not what I was expecting from a song called Party 4 u. Plus, 8 is a party 4 2.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): It's quite fascinating that this song was actually made even before the concept of the album even existed. The fact that this was a scrap from Number 1 Angel and Pop 2, only for this to be brought back for this album is so cool. This 2017-ish song fits well into this album mostly made of songs in 2020 and I can definitely see this making it to the top 20 at least.

**fadedblue09** (8): Sounds really empty in the first few minutes, but I love how intimate this sounds.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I actually like this. My opinion on this track changes every time I listen to it.

**Oberionsynth** (8): boom clap girl tryna get clapped anthem

**savemeaseat143** (8): ok gatsby

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i can't work out whether i love this song bc it starts strong, then goes downhill, then comes strong again

**TiltControls** (8): this was going to be like a 3 or 4, but that ending bridge is a solid 10. she could have had maybe cut down on the number of the party on you's in the song and it'd be solid

**vayyiqra** (8): someone find that meme of Charli as a doge that says I just want to go parties :(

**akanewasright** (7.8): I‚Äôll never forget how this was leaked on r/XCXheads by (we think? I forget if there was confirmation) Charli herself. That‚Äôs just fucking awesome. I‚Äôm glad this song is finally out and released, but... I can‚Äôt pretend that this is my favorite charli song. Still, I like it a good amount

**bulforster** (7.8): I like this but you can tell it wasn't written for this album.

**fairytalehigh** (7.6): i like this song, but stuck between "i finally understand"/"c2.0" and "anthems"/"visions," i can't help but feel it sticks out too much

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): ever since I heard "potty on you" I can't hear anything else

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): Me when i turned 17 and invited 3 friends out to lunch and they stood me up lmao

**jasannn** (7.2): wtf does "party on you" mean

**afs** (7): I understand why she chose a loop for her visualiser.

**EnCaine** (7): a decent track with one part in particular i really really live for (youcouldwatchmepulluponyourbodylikeitssummertakemyclothesoffinthewateretc)

**J\_Toe** (7): iirc this song was written a while ago, but the themes just match the intimate feeling of the album so well (i only threw this party for you, because we share a house and share a social bubble and i can't invite anyone else)

**ktajlili** (7): I have mixed feelings about this song. It's a well-written and emotionally impactful song, but I dislike her singing style because I think she sounds a bit like a baby. The ending sounds like POTTY ON YOU. POTTY ON YOU. sorry I can't help it but Charli's still a queen.

**shhhneak** (7): this should‚Äôve been the last song on the album. That outro!

**Vultuxe** (7): When she leaked a snippet of this to r/xcxheads... people lost their goddamn minds, and rightfully so -- that snippet was ear candy. Unfortunately, the studio release changed it up (the interlude/breakdown is not the same) so it ended up being a letdown to me somewhat. Still, it's a decent song.

Awkward_King: # Long songs ruined the streaming era

**welcome2thejam** (7): Is for me?

**just\_thonking** (6.5): HELP does the beginning instrumental remind anybody else of music from a specific video game? Like Spore or Pikmin or some Super Smash Bros stage?? Every time I hear this song that's all I can think about and I barely play any video games. Am I going crazy???

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): maybe the only song on this album that grew for me? I hated it on release but it's fine now

**celladonn** (6): This could stand to be a little shorter

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is why I always say surprise parties are a SCAM and a TRICK and I don‚Äôt like them!

**ignitethephoenix** (6): would be better if she cut the last 2 minutes out

**jayjaysortagay** (6): meh

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (6): Sad Charli.......have you considered Party For One??

**musical\_pyn** (6): more like 6 years hahaha wait uh

**throwaway7650** (6): I find this too long and repetitive but there are some parts I like

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): fantastic palate cleanser after c2.0. so fresh and clean, so soft

**urfavgalpal** (5.3): When the album first came out I considered this a transitional song between the songs I liked and the ones I didn‚Äôt and I just considered this a song I liked less than the others but still one of the more enjoyable ones.  However over time this song has become a little less interesting to me.  I mean honestly when it was hyped by angels pre-release like way before HIFN was even in the talks I didn‚Äôt understand the hype but I think when the album came out I bought into the hype and tricked myself into thinking I liked this song more than I did.  This song is kind of slow in a non interesting way.  I actually quite like when Charli slows it down a bit. I think her and her producers do some really neat work with detail sound effects in the slower songs but this just don‚Äô

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): part on you repeated way too much for me to like it. Like at that point I wanted to skip it. But I do think she conveyed her emotions well and I like the idea of being that invested in someone and not even knowing if they would show up.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): kinda long and doesn't go anywhere

**SupremeShani** (5): This is what Charli fans threatened her to release? The section of the bridge with just the autotuned vocals goes off though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Out of all the songs on this album Charli could have made 5 minutes‚Ä¶ why this one??

**frogaranaman** (4): haha get it party ‚Äò4‚Äô you.. eh this song kinda sucks

**ImADudeDuh** (4): during a PANNED EMICK??????? She‚Äôs over. Also, it‚Äôs crazy how this song manages to be annoying and boring at the same time.

**lagozzino** (4): There are so many songs on this album that start off great and then just fall into endless repetition. It's almost hard to believe that her main gig is being a professional songwriter cuz it seems like she has a hard time coming up with lyrics.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): this feels eternal

**hikkaru** (3): party 3 u

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): i just hate how she pronounces party

**KennyEarthman** (0): I only threw this farty 4 u

**nick1372** (0): This song does not objectively deserve a zero but I can‚Äôt fucking get over the fact that she‚Äôs literally saying ‚ÄúI just wanna potty on you‚Äù Did NO ONE tell her this? Is everyone on her team British? I can‚Äôt fucking deal with it

**wavingwolves** (0): i actually don't want to come to your party i'm sorry

**zagreux** (0): I'm not saying that repetitiveness is bad but this song is sonically boring, so it basically fails on all fronts

The best way to describe this song is definitely transcendant, it really feels like you are being lifted into another plain when Charli is singing with those heavily effected vocals in the first verse. Though the breakdown is... not my favourite, I really love the parts of this that I love ajsdkajks

---

# Raven-Symon√©

**LuisEnRod** (11): I transcended the first time I listened to this song and that‚Äôs that on that. If she doesn‚Äôt close out her shows in the future with this song idk what I‚Äôll do.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A wonderful send-off to a basically almost perfect album, the outro reminds me a lot of 2099 in how apocalyptic it is but with such a manic energy as well.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It sounds like she sampled a fire alarm at the end

**bbfan132** (10): :poohascend:

**Brendon-Urine** (10): and of course a perfect album ends with a perfect closer.

**camerinian** (10): Holy fuck this is just the perfect way to close the album. The intimacy and the euphoria all wrapped into one spellbinding package. All I want is to be back in a sweaty gig with a DJ dropping that second half somewhere for me to lose my fucking mind. Is that too much to ask

**eeveefan01** (10): the outro is an out of body experience

**engifear** (10): This was an 11 contender for me. I want to dance to this song with other people so bad.

**fairytalehigh** (10): one of the main things that got me through 2020 was the fantasy of losing my mind to the outro of this song live. still excitedly awaiting that day

**iniekcja\_** (10): the whole pussy was inserted into the outro

**KennyEarthman** (10): that drop ascended me to another plane of existence

**pat-rickstar** (10): B.A.N.G.E.R.

**pig-serpent** (10): This is a great song, but what if it was 10 minutes long and had a video of Charli going swimming. Haha, jk. Unless...

**plastichaxan** (10): i got pictures in my mind too!!

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): rave intensifies

**seanderlust** (10): i love this album bc my alexa timer has been going off for like five minutes and I just thought it was part of the songs

**skargardin** (10): the album is uneven but it does end off SO strong, what a banger

**steelstepladder** (10): Best closer of the four albums?

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Definitely one of Charli's all time best tracks, the gorgeous opening verses set up the ridiculously banger-tastic rave section so well, it's quite literally been proven impossible to not bop your head at the end of the song.

**vagenda** (10): when she said [ALARM BLARING NOISES] i really felt that

**zagreux** (10): the outro lives in my head rent-free

**juanolsen** (9.5): really great way to finish this album, it ties everything together nicely and it's classic charli

**liberalitea** (9.5): this is a super fun song

**nick1372** (9.5): maybe best production on the album? The version at appleville really made me appreciate this track more

**Palutzel** (9.5): what a closer, what an album

**CrimsonROSET** (9): c‚Äômon oracle of charli

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is a nice full circle moment on the album, it uses some of the same techniques as the other songs on the album (especially similar to ‚ÄúForever‚Äù) but it has comparatively tamer production as if she‚Äôs finally achieved clarity after all the turmoil of everything that‚Äôs come before. The dance breakdown at the end is nice too

**ktajlili** (9): I love the outro

**mudkip1** (9): wait i'm hearing sumn

**nooodisaster** (9): A classic last song, this is just beautiful from start to finish. The slow ethereal start building to the chaotic instrumental descent to pure electronica

**Qustomar** (9): The combo of Anthems and Visions ending the album kinds reminds me of how Homogenic ends with Pluto/All is Full of Love, thoughts?

**runaway3212** (9): a great closer

**vayyiqra** (9): A banger! I love that outro. It almost feels like being at a live show again.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Absolute bunker buster of a back half. This and Anthems together is such a strong one-two punch to close the album on.

**geraldinewww** (8.5): solely for the breakdown at the end

**Vultuxe** (8.5): I like visions, it steps away from hyperpop and dangerously close to eurobeat, which is... nice. The build up is great. Somehow this 3:49s song feels like 5 minutes or more.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): what an impressive album closer

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): This isn't a bad song, but in the context of the rest of the album, it definitely feels underwhelming. Once again though, the outro is jaw-droppingly good. This album has consistently good outros

**amiriteor** (8.3): get me into a club

**afs** (8): the first minute and a half was the second most unexpected part of the album, but Charli couldn't contain herself and decided to shake things up just a little bit.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This is a banger, but a lot of the first half is basically recycled Unlock It...

**hakkerj** (8): COULD the club even handle us...?

**Itsafudgingstick** (8): So I mean you have to play this right after Unlock it (lock it) in a club space right? Also the outro goes so fucking hard! Charlotte did not have to bless us like this

**lagozzino** (8): hello mid-00s futurepop. Charli getting ready to play Wave Gotik Treffen with this one.

**pros-and-connors** (8): would have been higher but the last minute is there

**throwaway7650** (8): really good album closer, almost reminds me of KARA - step

**Uberpigeon** (8): I forgot this one existed but it kind of slaps

**jman457** (7.8): Im unsure where to put my feelings for it but its certainly a way to end an album

**1998tweety** (7.5): ascend, this was a 10 until we got to the end

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song is kind of a mess? But also I think it‚Äôs kind of great?

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): I like the bouncy sounds.

**jasannn** (7.5): It's odd that there are two EDM-esque closers in this rate but this is the superior one.

**Leixander** (7.5): the outro is godly [9999]

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this song gets a lot of hate but I genuinely would prefer if more of the album sounded like this?

**Turpamutteri** (7.5): the ending was kinda annoying but other than that I enjoyed this

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): The alarm ending is a fun way to end an album like this, but doesn't make me want to re-listen or add it to any playlists

**musical\_pyn** (7): it's a fine closer, I wish there was more to the song though

**notarobot3675** (7): great album closer

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this is a really nice closer. I like the drum that goes through the end.

**Oberionsynth** (7): why did i think this song started with charli saying "bitches in that ass" with her whole chest

**poptartchill** (7): sounds like a song that would play in the club that I'd jam to but it's while I go to get another drink

**SupremeShani** (7): Going out with a rave is the most Charli thing she could have done, and I appreciate it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is a strong closer

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): A good song but very sonically similar to Anthems. I love a closing track that feels ‚Äúfinal,‚Äù though, which this one absolutely does

**NecroDolphinn** (6.8): I absolutely hate the moment right after the first chorus because I want the build to start and then it just doesn‚Äôt and ugh, but the rest of the song is good

Awkward_King: # Adore Delano

**wavingwolves** (7): a song that exists and happens to be the closer of this album

**Roxieloxie** (6.3): yall remember that random ass intermission on A fever you cant sweat out, well

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Conceptually and production wise this is a good closer. Just not my fave from the album.

**EnCaine** (6): this is definitely the only track i'm pretty indifferent about on this record, but the cool outro gives it a little boost

**frogaranaman** (6): shame that this album kind of peeters out at the end

**waluigiest** (6): flop, they should just double the length of Anthems and make it the closer

**CarlieScion** (5): why was this the closer!

**jaztinax** (5): she had me until the outro help

**salivantsonority** (5): Meh.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): kinda boring...

**urfavgalpal** (4.8): I think to explain my score I will just share that one time I was listening through to this album and I was doing something else so I was kinda distracted and all of a sudden something that just didn‚Äôt not mesh well with me at all came on and I was like ‚Äúwow the how I‚Äôm feeling now radio is playing a really shit song‚Äù and then I picked it up to change it and well it was actually just the end of visions.  There‚Äôs some neat stuff in here that I can appreciate when I am in a very specific mood but I am not in that mood often enough to like this song

**fadedblue09** (4): Kind of a lazy closing track unfortunately

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this was definitely a closer to the album.

**Tedyonce** (4): YAWN

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): i think this would be a 10 at a club but i am not feeling it otherwise

**bespectacIed** (3): it's obvious from my scores that i am not the biggest fan of hyperpop charli. Darkwave/electropop charli will always be the best

**IIIHenryIII** (3): I like club songs that are not actual club songs, and this is not it. The outro is cool, though (the very last few seconds).

**joeeswift** (3): the only song on the album I could never warm up to

**jsonphile** (3): please this outro make it stop

**shhhneak** (3): like every song on Dance Dance Revolution playing at once on extreme mode.

**ignitethephoenix** (2): when Charli has good lyrics again only to go ham with the production but not in a fun to listen to way

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): this reminds me of chromatica ??

**TiltControls** (0): I'm really not a fan of alarm-type sounds in songs. the song was already on thin ice before that point and the ending really didn't help with that. cut it and maybe i'd give this like... a 3?

It was so funny to me getting all these ballots and seeing how few people gave both Felt This Way and Stay Away high scores, Carly really waged a war within her own fanbase simply by releasing two of the same song. Evidently this one didn't fair quite as well as it's other half, and as nice as it is, I certainly see why! This is one of those songs I kind of find myself getting bored of halfway through, because it tends to repeat itself quite a bit.

---

# Felt This Way Supremacy

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): Far better than Stay Away

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): one of her best songs

**bespectacIed** (10): This deserves to be in the main album

**CarlieScion** (10): the horny version of stay away

**cashewconstellation** (10): a standout in her discography, the ENERGY OF "if it was only an attraction, how come nobody ever felt this way" carly owns my ass

**fairytalehigh** (10): best moment on the album. the bottom anthem of 2020. gay yearning incarnate. we stan

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): :(

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I can't stay away (away, away, away, away), this part is so catchy. It's so chill and emotional.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song makes me feel some type of way, that being incredibly good. It puts me in a trance that Carly just says "if it was only an attraction how come nobody ever felt this way?" It's absolutely mesmerizing and grooves me down to the core of my existence.

**nick1372** (10): The slightly better of the two versions, if only because Carly sounds a bit more comfortable cooing then belting

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is sexy as fuck, i love it. want more of this sound from her, too.

**poptartchill** (10): I know it's part of the pair but this is by far the superior one

**Tedyonce** (10): I already know Popheads will do this song dirty

**vagenda** (10): People will rate this lower than Stay Away because it‚Äôs the slow one, but it‚Äôs just as perfect

**wavingwolves** (10): everytime i listen to this it's like having carly gaslight me into thinking i'm in love with someone

**welcometoNY** (10): the fact that she had a song this good and then went and made it into another song just as good and had the audacity to put neither of them on the main record...sick and twisted

**zagreux** (10): I love love love love love love her voice on slow songs like these. also felt this way into stay away is better than chromatica II into 911

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Sultry, great momentum, this one is an endless wave pool lapping up against you, the warm water inviting and relaxing.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): the lesser twin but still a serve

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): makes me cry

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): listening to these two was so confusing the first time i heard this, really cool idea ms carly!

**bulforster** (9.3): I'm a Felt This Way supremacist.

**Alumineous** (9): This sounds so innocent, but then she says "the city's so hard". Fuck, I'm mentally 12 years old lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I'm almost always a fan of the more low-key CRJ songs and this is no exception

**Brendon-Urine** (9): this shit diabetic fr

**juanolsen** (9): a real classic Carly song, i love everything about it

**notarobot3675** (9): THE ROMANCE

**Oberionsynth** (9): i love it when carly uses a softer tone rather like here omg i'm whipped

**pros-and-connors** (9): this feels like the electricity in the air before you kiss someone for the first time, I‚Äôm obsessed

**Turpamutteri** (9): I love how she decided to put both Felt This Way and Stay Away on this album, it's a really cool idea

**waluigiest** (9): Felt This Way/Stay Away is hands down the biggest serve of this album

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): I honestly can't decide which version is better so I'm giving both the same score lololol

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song just makes me feel all nice and fuzzy inside

**conceptualromance** (8.5): a classic CRJ horny moment

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i tried to give this the same score as stay away but i really prefer that version so much more

**fadedblue09** (8.5): There's an introspective feel here that makes this one of the standouts.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): There‚Äôs a nice hypnotic vibe to this one, it makes me feel like I‚Äôm walking through the city on a chilly afternoon just kinda thinking about *him*‚Ä¶ Also the ‚Äúaway away away away‚Äù refrain always makes me kinda think of ‚ÄúCranes In The Sky‚Äù

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): She's cute, very chilled

**endcreditouilles** (8.3): me: mom can we get Stay Away / mom: we have Stay Away at home / the Stay Away at home:

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Part 1 of the "I CAN'T STAY AWAY" song idea, it's a nice softer but still somewhat romantic and song that Carly pulls you in with her rather gentle singing. Really lacks of the oomph of Stay Away though

**hakkerj** (8): I love the chill sexy vibe of this song, that is when I like Carly most

**iniekcja\_** (8): this isn't spectacular in any way but at the same time checks off all the boxes

**jsonphile** (8): wait this is just the same song

**pig-serpent** (8): Smooth song with a nice melody and interesting rhythms.

**runaway3212** (8): beautiful

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This one is the chill sister you would probably smoke weed and do spontaneous road trips to national parks with

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): ok i really love the chill, muted vibe

**jaztinax** (7.5): i hadn‚Äôt heard this prior to the rate but i had listened to stay away a lot so i‚Äôm cONFUSED. i can‚Äôt tell if i like this one or stay away more tho

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): This song suffers the same way a lot songs on Dedicated (the main album) do for me and it's that the song is almost a bit too laid back and uninteresting. It's still a really good song, don't get me wrong, but it feels like it could be better...

**throwaway7650** (7.5): cute song and chorus in particular

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): I did not know the lyrics on this were literally the same as Stay Away until I read the post for this rate??? This is my personal favorite of the two, but they‚Äôre both great

**Vromega** (7.5): I really like the beat but her voice seems a bit too superficial. Not fond of the production

**AHSWeeknd** (7): So many questions but no answers! We want answers!

**anothertown** (7): takes way too long to get to the choruses which are the good part

**brenda\_official** (7): she should have put a transition between the two and made it one song that would have been the serve of all time

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Hi belb!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like elements of this but I don‚Äôt love it

**KennyEarthman** (7): has a driving to the beach vibe

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (7): Classic Carly "ballad" (still a bop)

**liberalitea** (7): it's slower, but i think it's a really pretty song

**musical\_pyn** (7): this is so intimate and I defintiely like this better than stay away

**sirpancakeXI** (7): a worse version of stay away

**SupremeShani** (7): Invented songwriting and music, Carly's impact knows no bounds.

**targetguest** (7): possibly my least favorite on the album, but Carly never misses

**Vultuxe** (7): I like Felt This Way, I feel the production doesn't exactly match how sensual the song is trying to be.

# Stay Away Supremacy

**bbfan132** (8.5): i prefer stay away but i like the mellower feel of this version too

**jasannn** (8): Stay Away outsold but I love how they share lyrics but elicit two different moods.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): inferior

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): I appreciate this as the lesser version of Stay Away

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): these early Dedicated Side B tracks blend together so much that I almost wrote this score for the wrong song multiple times before the song ended

**urfavgalpal** (6.4): The biggest crime this song commits is being my less favorite of the Felt This Way/Stay Away pairing.  It‚Äôs a nice song and if Stay Away weren‚Äôt on the album I might rank it higher.  I enjoy it in the context of the album, and I actually think it helps build some anticipation for Stay Away that in turn makes that song more enjoyable.  I think it‚Äôs really neat to see how the same lyrics can create two completely different tracks and gives a neat insight to the writing process, but personally I tend to enjoy Carly‚Äôs upbeat tracks more and so I will always choose to listen to Stay Away over this.

**afs** (6): soft and frankly boring, though I thought this was Stay Away at first and got confused

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this is some cool recycle reduce but stay away is much superior
[/r/popheads/comments/nn3owd/2020_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_1_my_therapist/gzt1s7z/]

=====

Awkward_King: **salivantsonority** (6): Meh. That one RuPaul .gif reacting to the Silky/Nina lip sync.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): kind of a plain song...

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): it's fine? It's chill but it's just there

**ktajlili** (5): it's borrring

**frogaranaman** (4): maybe this should have been on side c

**jman457** (3.8): This def feels very b-sidey. The parts of the songs just dont gel well together

**camerinian** (3): I don't actually think this song is that bad, but the reason I'm rating this so low is because it's maybe the worst piece of album sequencing I've seen. The idea of making two versions of the same melody and lyrics isn't a terrible idea, but wedging them right at the start of the album that's already a B Side collection really makes it seem like a collection of half-baked ideas, and to then put the more low key version in front of the upbeat one only blunts the impact of the latter rather than reflecting the resourcefulness of the move. Maybe space these throughout the album and allow for a bit of breathing room for the callback and it would be a much cuter idea I think, but where it is, the presence of this song on the album makes the whole project awkward.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): just a more boring version of the song that follows it
