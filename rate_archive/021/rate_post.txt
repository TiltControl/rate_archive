[RATE] Electronic Producers: KAYTRANADA - 99.9% vs. Disclosure - Settle vs. Flume - Skin
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6ejovg/rate_electronic_producers_kaytranada_999_vs/

#Welcome to the Electronic Producers Rate!

*full name: welcome to the feature-filled, festival-ready, hipster-appealing, overtly-sensual, alternative-R&B-influenced, AlunaGeorge-collaborating, almost-an-hour-long, great-album-cover, from-a-non-US-Anglosphere-country electronic producer rate!!!*

This rate marks the first time we've ever dealt with producer albums in a /r/popheads rate. You might be wondering why these albums were chosen over, say, more popular artists like Skrillex, Zedd, or Calvin Harris. I wanted to do a rate that represented a larger spectrum of electronic music that /r/popheads might not have experience with. KAYTRANADA, Disclosure, and Flume are all producers who seem determined to prove themselves as artists, and these albums are the results of that goal. These albums have distinctive aesthetics that separate themselves from each other, yet they also fit surprisingly well when placed together. There's a certain underlying ethos behind all three that connects them. The records cover a diversity of styles in comparison to other electronic works, which means that you'll most likely enjoy at least one song from each of these records. From my own experience, it's almost impossible to hate any of them!

*Cool rate and all, but I don't recognize any of these people. Who's KAYTRANADA?*

#[KAYTRANADA](http://www.billboard.com/files/media/Kaytranada-bb13-2016-billboard-650-1548.jpg) - [*99.9%*](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2016/xllp765-kaytranada.jpg)

Kaytranada (stylized KAYTRANADA) is the stage name of Louis Kevin Celestin, a Haitian-Canadian music producer. He was raised by his mother in a poor household, and spent much of his time listening to hip hop such as J Dilla and Madlib. Celestin soon started expanding his horizons, and became engrossed in collecting a variety of records across genres. Soon enough, he began releasing [music under the name Kaytradamus on YouTube and Bandcamp](https://youtu.be/mRCwAAU03ug). In 2012, he garnered popularity through his Soundcloud remixes, particularly [his take on Janet Jackson's "If"](https://soundcloud.com/kaytranada/janet-jackson-if-kaytranada), a stunning interpretation that mixed Jackson's vocals into a euphoric dance track. He was soon signed to XL Recordings, but had struggles in releasing his album due to touring. He's had credits on tracks by Chance the Rapper, Katy B, Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Azealia Banks, and Kali Uchis, and opened for two shows in Madonna's Rebel Heart Tour. Finally, after several long years, he released the record *99.9%* to critical acclaim, promoted with even a [game](http://kaytranada.com/game/).

*99.9%* is the record that proves eclecticism can be pulled off successfully. Kaytranada goes into a diversity of styles right on his debut, and never takes a risk that feels too much for him. On the album, he creates chill instrumental beats, high energy dance, and entrancing hip hop numbers with the utmost confidence. Kaytranada covers sonic territory that most artists don't touch in their entire career. He features a cast of some of 2016's most buzzed artists alongside lesser-known performers. Kaytranada knows what he wants from his collaborators, and he brings that out from them with. The entire album feels like a personal statement, with influences from the hip hop that he grew up listening to. *99.9%* is rooted in Kaytranada's Haitian origins, and even his father was proud of his son's usage of rhythms that evoke his native country. The summery disco synths that Kaytranada loves are featured heavily on the record, yet there's also a bit of a nocturnal quality to the record with its heavy bass. His record exudes consistency and vision as a debut, feeling like a culmination of all of his previous efforts. The title implies Kaytranada's progress towards the future, and he gets closer to reaching 100% every day.

*Could you explain who Disclosure are?*

---

#[Disclosure](http://www.electronicbeats.net/app/uploads/2015/08/Disclosure-2015.png) - [*Settle*](http://www.manhattandigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disclosure-settle-1500x1500-1370291426.jpg)

Guy and Howard Lawrence are the brotherly duo that make up Disclosure, a UK garage duo that has made its mark on the British pop landscape. They started out making house music influenced by classic house and 2-step, posting tracks to their Myspace and gaining attention on music sites such as [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/news/12050-street-light-chronicle/). The [distinctive white outlined drawings over their real faces](http://cdn.albumoftheyear.org/album/carnival.jpg) was a very reserved and unique image for them, which they still maintain in their more recent releases. After the release of their *The Face* EP in 2012, they began pulling in a larger fanbase and were even booked at Coachella, where they performed [their mix of Jessie Ware's "Running"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXocNWrQ0sM). Their remix was a popular song in the Netherlands and Belgium, and they soon signed to Universal to release their debut album *Settle* with PMR Records. The release of several singles signaled their endeavors into more accessible pop, yet managed to receive critical acclaim and a nomination for the Mercury Prize.

The alternative R&B scene is one of the most defining parts of the 2010s music climate. As producers like Burial, Dev Hynes, and Julio Bashmore collaborated with vocalists, they created R&B with distinctly atmospheric and subtle production. The amount of artists working in this grew, and slowly dance elements were added to the mix. UK electronic musicians would feature singers with sensual, passionate vocals over their bass-heavy beats. Disclosure's *Settle* is the epitome of this evolution. Vocalists like AlunaGeorge, Jessie Ware, and Jamie Woon are best known for their futuristic, atmospheric production; however, on *Settle*, they find themselves holding their own in a completely different setting. *Settle* manages to bring to mind classic UK records with its groovy house beats and soulful singers, yet also feels modern and fresh. The Lawrence brothers' sound is clean, polished, and meticulous, with every detail being used to create fine pop songs. The album was a huge hit, debuting at #1 in the UK and appearing on the UK Singles Chart multiple times. It was like the start of something new in the electronic world, and it was: ever since its 2013 release, so many records have been filled with diverse features and aim for the same kind of aesthetic consistency that the Lawrence brothers pull off. If there's one thing you couldn't call this record, it's unimportant. *Settle* is an assured proof that dance music can pull off the album format.

*Okay, who's Flume?*

---

#[Flume](http://cdn2-www.musicfeeds.com.au/assets/uploads/flume-2017-press-pic-supplied-photo-by-Cybele-Malinowski.jpg) - [*Skin*](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wCAOtIBAL._SL1500_.jpg)

Harley Streten is the man behind Flume, a name picked up from the opening track of indie folk act Bon Iver's *For Emma, Forever Ago* (do /u/dirdbub's rate on /r/indieheads!!!). His career started after winning a competition to sign with Future Classic. After the release of his debut album, *Flume*, he became an istar. The album topped the ARIA charts, and [beat out One Direction on iTunes hilariously](http://www.gigwise.com/news/77585/producer-flume-mocks-one-direction-fans-after-topping-australian-chart).  His style was distinctive, with sidechained synth drops that garnered imitators throughout Soundcloud. [Even Zedd was accused by deadmau5 of ripping off Flume when he released the M&M collaboration "Candyman"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/35870509/diplo-accuses-zedd-of-selling-out-and-ripping-off-flume). Flume released several remixes afterwards, which helped his profile grow on an international scale. In fact, my first experience with his work was with [his remix of Lorde's Tennis Court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ATu1BiOPZA).

When Flume started working on *Skin*, he felt like he wanted to make a statement. How could he meet the potential that he displayed on his debut? With this record, he decided to recruit an all-star cast of features, and aimed to show off his versatility as a producer. The result of this is a record of ambition: 16 tracks of futuristic beats underlying rap tracks and alien pop singers. While his sound is more festival-ready than ever, and the closest to typical "EDM" in the rate, Flume has a clearer artistic scope than his imitators. Rather than diluting his unique aesthetic to appeal to the masses, he opted to experiment and play with pop sounds. *Skin* feels defined by its intense contrast, as beautiful synthesized atmospheres clash with noisy, abrasive glitch elements. Even the artwork embodies his vision as an artist: featuring a computer-generated floral arrangement, it reflects his creation of an organic sound through his digital palette. Flume's work on the album often feels intense and emotional, with the best parts of many songs being cathartic drops or gorgeous vocal parts. *Skin* is a portrait of a future pop landscape painted with shimmery synths, clattering percussion, and hypnotic vocals.

#[This is a link to a Spotify playlist of all of the songs included in the standard rate, courtesy of /u/letsallpoo!](https://open.spotify.com/user/thepopheads/playlist/3pSDCuPbpBZ50aSigfKgSa)

This might be helpful to those who don't have Spotify Premium. While I'd prefer you listen to the albums in order, on mobile you don't have that choice, so shuffling the albums together at least prevents you from having to listen to unrelated tracks when rating as Spotify doesn't add suggested songs until all other songs have played. They go together surprisingly well when shuffled, too!

*Wait, but what about...*

#Bonus Tracks

Due to the fact that studio albums can only show so much of what a producer has to offer, I decided to add a bonus rate to the mix! The songs included are remixes, one-off singles, and deluxe edition tracks. I didn't include the *Skin* companion EPs only because I have no idea which one I should add and both is a bit much. **These songs are optional to rate**, and if you don't want to listen to all of them, that's perfectly fine! **Just rate the ones you want to.**

#The Rules

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots**: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).

* Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later). I highly recommend listening to these albums in full, they’re all cohesive experiences that blend a bit more than most albums.

* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential. They aren’t.

* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is ONE song total, **NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM.** Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results. I'll tell you if you need to revise your scores.

* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.

* I am using a computer program that the great and wonderful /u/letsallpoo designed in order to parse these votes! You can see it [here](https://github.com/jnlu/popheads/blob/master/popheads.py). While this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link at the bottom of this post. PLEASE USE THAT.** You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in your scores.

* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.

#Adding Comments

If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

Do it like this:

>Grab Her!: 0 fuck Donald Trump

Not like this:

>Grab Her!: 0: fuck Donald Trump

>Grab Her!: fuck Donald Trump 0

>Grab Her!: fuck Donald Trump so this song gets my 0

>Grab Her!: 0-fuck Donald Trump

>Grab Her!: 0 (fuck Donald Trump)

>Grab Her!: 0 - fuck Donald Trump

You can also comment on albums! Just add a colon to the album name and add your comment, like this:

>Album: Skin: he make loud noise drop aa

Not like this:

>Album: Skin he make loud noise drop aa

>Album: Skin - he make loud noise drop aa

>Album: Skin (he make loud noise drop aa)

>Album: HE MAKE LOUD NOISE DROP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Skin
