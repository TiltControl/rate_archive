[RATE REVEAL] Electronic Producers, day 2: To the left, take it back, y'all, now...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6ovo6g/rate_reveal_electronic_producers_day_2_to_the/

Welcome to the second day of the electronic producers rate!

If yesterday's reveal didn't impress you, this one hopefully will!

* We're revealing #10 and #8 - #6 of the bonus rate, and #30 - #16 of the main rate today, starting at HOPEFULLY 1:00pm EST.

* We had **46 participants!** Not too shabby, especially considering it was at the same time as the lovely /u/therokinrolla's hugely popular 2013 rate.

* The average of every track is a **7.2877**.

* The controversy average is **1.9907**! Anything above this should be considered controversial.

tbh i feel like 99.9% might have the highest album average but a single from Settle (ideally White Noise) might come in 1st

Like "Rocket" before it, /r/popheads once again shows its own virginity. A bop that actually samples a porn video (I don't know where it is, though), it was unfortunately robbed. The production is absolutely pristine, with the vocalist's singing being manipulated masterfully. It's classic funky, so most would probably enjoy it.

Could anybody send a link to the sample's source, please? I'd love to do some research and write a paragraph for the rate.

I feel bad, because I quite literally can't remember this song. It's pleasant, but pleasant in the way wallpaper is nice to look at. It's virtually meaningless. **jvickery13** thinks different: "yas sinead".

It's a shame, because Harnett's own work is definitely worth getting into. ["No Other Way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnIoZsD2X84) features producer Snakehips, as she sings over funky UK bass synths. It's wonderful stuff, and her most recent EP, a self-titled, came out last year.

By the way, do **NOT** search up "boiled" on YouTube. I'm scarred forever.

**mokitsu**: "nnn i love sinead but this is kinda boring"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It’s certainly a Disclosure song."

**dirdbub**: "I reached my boiling point. I'm not having another discussion or debate with white liberals anymore. Done. They're the most condescending, arrogant, wifully ignorant, stupid,racist,stubborn, thick headed people on earth. They ask for your opinion, only to insult and bash you if you don't give them the typical liberal responses. They don't know shit about the black or Hispanic community but they have the gall to tell you that what you see is not the truth, although they never go there and have almost zero interactions with either group outside of social media. They only like the criminals in these communities and they stick their nose up at the ones who obey the law and reject the theory of white supremacy. I hate these people with a passion and I wish them nothing but ill. They're in need of a serious ass kicking."

I think this is probably THE least commented song? Not sure entirely, because I'm typing this write-up quickly. "Tenderly" is a stellar UK funky track, with beautiful percussion (**mokitsu** thinks it's steel drums, and frankly, I'm not sure: "pretty repetitive but i love the steel drums (?)") and hard synth riffs. It's classic dance music, and I don't think anything could change about this to make it better. **SkyBlade79** thinks differently: "this does not have to be 5 minutes".

#THIS IS REALLY GROSS BUT I'M NOT CUTTING ANY COMMENTS SO THIS IS NSFW

**dirdbub**: "A few years ago, while browsing around the library downtown, I had to take a piss. As I entered the john a big beautiful all-american football hero type, about twenty-five, came out of one of the booths. I stood at the urinal looking at him out of the corner of my eye as he washed his hands. He didn't once look at me. He was "straight" and married -- and in any case I was sure I wouldn't have a chance with him. As soon as he left I darted into the booth he'd vacated, hoping there might be a lingering smell of shit and even a seat still warm from his sturdy young ass. I found not only the smell but the shit itself. He'd forgotten to flush. And what a treasure he had left behind. Three or four beautiful specimens floated in the bowl. It apparently had been a fairly dry, constipated shit, for all were fat, stiff, and ruggedly textured. The real prize was a great feast of turd -- a nine inch gastrointestinal triumph as thick as a man's wrist. I knelt before the bowl, inhaling the rich brown fragrance and wondered if I should obey the impulse building up inside me. I'd always been a heavy rimmer and had lapped up more than one little clump of shit, but that had been just an inevitable part of eating ass and not an end in itself. Of course I'd had jerk-off fantasies of devouring great loads of it (what rimmer hasn't), but I had never done it. Now, here I was, confronted with the most beautiful five-pound turd I'd ever feasted my eyes on, a sausage fit to star in any fantasy and one I knew to have been hatched from the asshole of the world's handsomest young stud. Why not? I plucked it from the bowl, holding it with both hands to keep it from breaking. I lifted it to my nose. It smelled like rich, ripe limburger (horrid, but thrilling), yet had the consistency of cheddar. What is cheese anyway but milk turning to shit without the benefit of a digestive tract? I gave it a lick and found that it tasted better then it smelled. I've found since then that shit nearly almost does. I hesitated no longer. I shoved the fucking thing as far into my mouth as I could get it and sucked on it like a big brown cock, beating my meat like a madman. I wanted to completely engulf it and bit off a large chunk, flooding my mouth with the intense, bittersweet flavor. To my delight I found that while the water in the bowl had chilled the outside of the turd, it was still warm inside. As I chewed I discovered that it was filled with hard little bits of something I soon identified as peanuts. He hadn't chewed them carefully and they'd passed through his body virtually unchanged. I ate it greedily, sending lump after peanutty lump sliding scratchily down my throat. My only regret was the donor of this feast wasn't there to wash it down with his piss. I soon reached a terrific climax. I caught my cum in the cupped palm of my hand and drank it down. Believe me, there is no more delightful combination of flavors than the hot sweetness of cum with the rich bitterness of shit. Afterwards I was sorry that I hadn't made it last longer. But then I realized that I still had a lot of fun in store for me. There was still a clutch of virile turds left in the bowl. I tenderly fished them out, rolled them into my hankerchief, and stashed them in my briefcase. In the week to come I found all kinds of ways to eat the shit without bolting it right down. Once eaten it's gone forever unless you want to filch it third hand out of your own asshole. Not an unreasonable recourse in moments of desperation or simple boredom. I stored the turds in the refrigerator when I was not using them but within a week they were all gone. The last one I held in my mouth without chewing, letting it slowly dissolve. I had liquid shit trickling down my throat for nearly four hours. I must have had six orgasms in the process. I often think of that lovely young guy dropping solid gold out of his sweet, pink asshole every day, never knowing what joy it could, and at least once did, bring to a grateful shiteater."

#MEMES LOST

#I COULD *NOT* BELIEVE IT

This performance of "My Boo" (originally by Ghost Town DJs) is live, just in case anybody didn't know. So, it does sound a tad clumsy. However, I found it a really charming and cute track, even if most of it felt thrown together last minute.

**awryj** sums it up best: "This is what memes from the parallel universe sound like". It's a glitch pop/rap take on the Miami bass classic, which had blown up around the time due to the [Running Man Challenge](https://youtu.be/L1xT_0aQ2iU). The synths are typical Flume fare, and it's surprising how much this sounds like it came from the studio.

Ngaiire is an Australian singer, and her style is quite artsy R&B. /u/letsallpoo showed me [Diggin](https://youtu.be/-9P7lilYw-c), which is actually a really cute track! Definitely a great recommendation for anybody into the modern R&B scene. Vera Blue is another Australian artist, whose music is along the same vein but mostly edges towards Maggie Rogers style pop. Her song [Hold](https://youtu.be/3Cv6JEjevKQ) was an interesting listen, with intense production elements surrounding her voice.

Our first song of the day is also our first track with a feature from *Settle*! Showcasing the talents of artist Jamie Woon, Disclosure create a very smooth, poppy track. So, what made it go out so early? I think the thing that might've turned people off are that it's rather generic in terms of the album (**MrSwearword**: "beat work is different for them and the vocals are nice but this is a sedate version of Defeated No More"). "January" is not a bad song by any means, but when you have nearly the rest of the album with stunning instrumentals and vocalists, it's easy to see why it'd get forgotten. If there's one thing that does make this song stand out a bit, it's the fact that it has a recognizable bridge.

**cloudbustingmp3** makes a convincing case for the track, saying "when i saw Disclosure last May, there was a guy next to me who kept shouting for this song and honestly #same. the drama and intensity in it is ridiculous, and that bridge makes me wish they did them more often tbh". **eklxtreme** is kind to it as well: "the synths give a nice light, airy vibe and his vocals work well with them."

Believe it or not, Jamie Woon was one of the first artists to be working in alternative R&B, alongside Jai Paul and Jessie Ware. *Settle* was basically a compilation of the most influential British singers in alternative R&B at the time, recontextualizing them into vintage dance music. Alternative R&B's roots are in UK bass and garage, and we can trace this all the way back to 2007 with the [influential British musician Burial's remix of Woon's "Wayfaring Stranger".](https://youtu.be/cp7Wnf0zm58) The remix is very representative of the sound of modern R&B, with atmospheric synths and UK dance-inspired rhythms. Eventually, the two would work together again and produce the wonderful ["Night Air"](https://youtu.be/EL0pTo9Z_XU), an exercise in airy beats and emotive sounds.

>Me sinto contente!

>Me sinto muito contente!

Well, fuck me. I thought this song was perfect top 10 material! The first song by KAYTRANADA out today is one of his most popular songs, and a single, at that. This is easily my favorite instrumental off the album, and to see it get out so soon is just bewildering, honestly. Utilizing a sample from Tropicália singer Gal Costa's ["Pontos de luz"](https://youtu.be/HD1okZpPwzg), he creates a funky house track that's uniquely KAYTRANADA, all caps not just because I'm confused at this song's low placement but because no other artist could have produced this song. A;; he did was add a sidechaining kick drum to the sample but it changes the entire track from a chill funk groove into a dance song. It's so wonderfully summery and happy.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** puts it best, despite his 11 going out so early: "This song is a treasure, an unlikely standout in an album full of impressive collaborations. This is probably the best thing Kaytranada’s ever done, an unintelligible sample-heavy bop that has so much damn texture. It’s like really hard to explain why this is so damn good and my 11, but it’s the most captivating instrumental track in this whole rate imo. And the outro is fantastic as well, a trance and amazing way to wind the song down." **10footnotes** is impressed with the track as well: "Several of the instrumentals on this album try to be different, but don’t go far enough to interest me. This one does." **VodkaInsipido** is also among the people who enjoyed the track's sampling: "Now this song. I usually don’t enjoy fully instrumental songs, but this is one of the exceptions. It has something, maybe it is the sampled vocals, maybe it is that it goes fast and hard as fuck, maybe it is that the instruments sound incredible, but I still don’t know what it is."

**mashluke** has the most insightful negative comment: "Now, this is probably the song I like the least. I'm not giving this a 0 because that would be a crime but while I don't mind this at all, it's not as good as the others." And even despite that, he still gives it an 8! What a guy.

Every other negative comment was either "what is this" or "I can't dance to this" so I'm not putting them in here.

Yet another Disclosure song is out! This time, I'm a little upset, because this is easily one of my favorites from the album. "Defeated No More" is a bit of a switch-up in terms of the style of the album, being much less of an immediate pop track like "Latch" or "White Noise", or a repetitive house track like "When a Fire Starts to Burn" or "F for You". It's very synth-based, with aquatic synths complementing Macfarlane's very lifting falsetto vocals. **mokitsu** makes a very good point about its sound: "this could've been in caracal - very moody and chill".
Despite taking two verses to get into the chorus, it's easily one of the most rewarding payoffs in the entire rate, with a hypnotic hook. The slow buildup into the second drop is my favorite moment on the entire album.

In my opinion, the length is what makes this song great, because it feels more like it's building rather than just adding extra verses unnecessarily. However, that's clearly not how others felt about it. **Mattymooz_** gives their 0 quite harshly: "Literally the most boring track ever". **SkyBlade79** isn't impressed, either: "Why tf is this so long and just uninteresting?". The general opinion was that it was mostly pleasant, though.

Ed Macfarlane is the lead vocalist of alternative dance band Friendly Fires. The group had popped up in 2006, around the peak years of the whole "nu-rave" movement where everybody was trying to be Gang of Four or Talking Heads or some weird electroclash group. Their debut album, a self-titled, was released in 2008, mostly featuring bouncy rhythms that bring to mind LCD Soundsystem or Friendly Fires' own XL label-mates Vampire Weekend. Their song ["Jump in the Pool"](https://youtu.be/ofRCldHb7X0) is a cute little perky dance-punk single, with some cowbell and a dreamy chorus.

**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*

**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*

Actually, it's not *that* crazy. I mean, of course it is, but it's not like this is the most extreme beat anybody's ever made.

Anyways, here's "Wall Fuck". Easily the most abrasive song from all three albums, this track surprisingly got usurped from the "most controversial track" title by "Free". Personally, I adore this song, despite the noisy glitch noises in here. I feel that most of Flume's instrumentals on here were really underwhelming, only using quick high pitched sounds to experiment into the more noisy side of his aesthetic. However, this track is the culmination of every second of total glitch hop weirdness that the rest of the album only hints at. Straight from the intro we have a constantly skipping vocal track, and then it goes straight into a heavy drop. Using echoey, mechanical dark beats between sections of repeating vocals, Flume creates a fantastic build-up to a really wonderful climax of synths and hard beats.

**SkyBlade79** has a nice comment, and introduced me to Superjail! in the process: "Okay, not sure why I like this song. Not even sure if it deserves this 10 or not. It’s just so weird. I adore how it goes from cute and happy to this completely FILTHY noise, that sounds like it would fit perfectly into Superjail!. Maybe that’s why I like this song so much; it’s how I imagine that the inside of the Warden’s mind would sound like (from the aforementioned Superjail of course). Soft and creative at some parts, then dark, murderous, and cruel at others. It’s really the perfect song for him.". **therokinrolla**'s comment is pretty hot: "i think this is supposed to represent an orgasm? Okay well the beginning made me reverse orgasm bc it was so putrid but the rest of it is smooth". The word "putrid" is so nasty and vivid, I love it.

**jvickery13** has a choice comment, and I'd probably agree with him if I listened to Arca more: "how does a song called "wall fuck" manage to be this boring. it's just noise. arca does it better". **seferre2** is irritated by the vocal portion: "anyway edm is weird and every edm album has the weird instrumental track but wtf is with the stuttering seriously ruins a great song otherwise". **awhile2** explains their 0: "guys I think my MP3 is broken. It keeps skipping and sounds like trash".

---

**MrSwearword**: "mind numbing trash"

**timothy444**: "Honestly, this song doesn't even deserve a ten but god damn, this song is just fricken' hilarious to listen to and I can imagine a music video being creepy, dark but obviously somewhat relaxing. I don't know, I just feel obliged to rate it so high!"

**mokitsu**: "sounds like a bad ass backdrop for a beyoncé or gaga concert"

**mashluke**: "The title sounds inappropriate but it describes the song perfectly."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "after reading the title I thought this would be really good, plot twist: it was not good"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "The. Best. instrumental. On. Skin. Don’t get off-put by the abrasive title, this song bangs like no other song on Skin."

**skiddos**: "Reminds me of when I'd drop my Gameboy and my game would start glitching"

**PossumAloysuis**: "This shit goes so goddamn hard. No slander tolerated"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this is fun tbh"

**awryj**: "Why on Earth is it called "wall fuck"? Like, humping it Can't Remember I'm Not Lesbon style? Is it a fetish or what?"

**10footnotes**: "King of running into walls (I hope)."

**robbiec_**: "sex w/o words"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The vocal sample weaves effortlessly through the particularly heavy synths. I really like how the tone shifts several times throughout the track."

**theultimatetrol**: "Okay this is great, title is perfectly descriptive. When he brought this out as a single everyone was losing it lol. Also seems a bit like a prequel to the Yeah Right which is also really good"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a mess, but a great mess of a song."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "fuck man i really need my boy vince staples to rap over this beat"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Like Helix, it’s alright. Nothing crazy. Although I love the deja-vu sensation it leaves on the second half."


**eklxtreme**: "i don't think the song needs the vocal sample, but it's kind of a banger otherwise"

#you forgot to replace some "anco"s in there, smh

**dirdbub**: "I've been super into Flume since I had *Self Titled* in 2012. Everyone I'm friends with now is very aware of this, and they tease me about it, whatever. Most of us like similar music outside of this, so it's not really a big deal. But I have to always listen to my anco privately. But I like to share with people, I like forming a community of bonds, whatever, you know? So here I think, ok, I love this music, and a lot of other people do too, right? So clearly there's something there. And I know my friends love dancing. I have seen them. And I don't usually get to dance to my Flume, even though it is awesome whenever I do. And my birthday is coming up, so I'm like-- I am never allowed to do stuff like this, but if it's my birthday, I can throw whatever party I want! And people will want to celebrate with me, so they'll come, and then I will show them how fun it is to dance to Flume and we can have a cool moment of togetherness. So my roommates agree, whatever, I invite people, I borrow some good speakers, I make a bumpin playlist of anco's best dance songs. I am filled with joy as I'm making it because of how much shit is packed into this music and how I can't wait to give people the opportunity to feel the way I feel, or at least give it a shot and like have a fun little dance party where all you gotta do is move your body how you want. The friends arrive, we Inebriate, whatever-- there's some chill music playing, I have a short little Event, and when the Event is done, I turn off some of the lights and turn on the anco dance playlist and I start dancing. No one else does. So I'm all, whatever, I'll roll with the punches, I thought I started off using a good, more recognizable song with "Never Be Like You," but maybe they just need to take awhile to get used to it sonically, they'll join in. They don't. A few songs go by before I vacate the dance floor myself, to try to do the Dance-Drag Some People Over There. Everyone flat-out refuses, standing and talking instead. I had two allies, two dudes who helped bring over the speakers beforehand. They'd go around and convince people to dance too, both real likeable dudes, and nothing. People refused. People I've been friends with for years. I was getting frustrated, cuz you know, I want people to be having fun but the Literal Name that this party was marketed as was "Flume Dance Party" or "my Australian bb dance party." They knew what this was going to be. My next move was to try to announce to the group that we should all dance, because dancing really just needs some momentum. Once everyone is dancing your own moves don't mean anything and you're less self conscious. So I flip on the lights and remind people it is, in fact, an Flume dance party, so dance, or please leave. Lights back off, and then me and those two dudes and one of the dude's little sister and I start dancing and everyone else goes back to talking. And mind me, I put on a real banger at this point: “Wall Fuck”. That song is so likeable, it's fucked up. While I'm dancing, this other dude walks up to me and decides to hit me with the "You just can't dance to this is the thing. There's no beat." And I'm super like dude what, because the only rule that I made for this party with regards to the dance was "no bitching about the music." Those were my words. And here is this dude, BITCHING ABOUT THE MUSIC. So I tell him to leave, and he reassures me, "I was already on my way out." So after that dude and his bad mood were gone, I was hopeful. Maybe he was like pulling down the General Comfort Level with the music. But nope. After dancing by myself for few more songs I'm ready to bail, so I shut off the music. People continue talking, but the smoke alarm starts going off and so that makes everyone leave except the two speaker dudes, and we chill for a bit, whatever. And you know, it's really bothering me. I don't know what the reason nobody danced was. I don't know whether I was just being too weird about everything so anyone would have felt uncomfortable, or if this was just a shitty group of friends who would rather drink free booze than put a bit of effort into participating in something I was excited about. Since, I've been feeling weird when I listen to any Australian bb. My Advice for others on this undertaking: maybe don't. Just hope you can see them live next time they tour."

This is one of two songs that I have trouble with remembering the title, along with You Know, so I usually just think of this as "the song with BADBADNOTGOOD on it". Is it a bad song? Not at all! Personally, I found it a bit of a weak spot, but I can see why people would enjoy it. It's just pleasant jazz fusion type hip hop, with some interesting wobbly electronics occasionally making their way into BADBADNOTGOOD's jamming. It's really good at what it is, though, with the guitar being a little repetitive but still nice.

**timothy444** isn't impressed with the album's loops, but enjoys the bass: "Welcome to the world of Infinite Loops. One point extra because of that bass bit that sounded epic.". **PossumAloysuis** loves BBNG: "BBNG & Kaytra are golden together. Love the synths at the end with the bassline".

In fact, the only completely negative comment is by **seferre2**: "i swear this is one boring af instrumental". Nearly everybody else appreciated the song in the comments. Even **10footnotes** enjoys it: "One of the more interesting instrumentals on the album because 1) it changes and 2) it doesn't drag. This track has stepped off the elevator and is on its way to a business meeting." Most comments just wish there was more to it, like **VodkaInsipido**: "A bit too spacey for me." **eklxtreme** agrees: "nice groove but I wish there was more"

BADBADNOTGOOD is a jazz fusion group, and while reading comments for their second LP I came across a really interesting summation of their sound:

>[For nearly its entire existence, hip-hop artists have paid homage to jazz. Toward this purpose, enthusiasts invented the nomenclature "jazz-rap". The members of BBNG, however, are jazz musicians by trade, and they prefer to pay tribute to hip-hop.](https://rateyourmusic.com/review?id=49745661)

I remember their music being hyped up a lot, and I still have yet to listen to a full album by them. However, I remember that their song with Snoop Dogg and Kaytranada, [Lavender (Nightfall Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4i3bAtEuJE), was controversial for the music video, which features Snoop SHOOTING A CLOWN DONALD TRUMP. Legends only.

Oh shit, I found this [tribute to Kanye's "Flashing Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6EomECg2Q). That's INSANE.

---

**MrSwearword**: "nice and captivating"

**mokitsu**: "woo i love BBNG and this has their sound all over it! a standout."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is a short instrumental track with the addition of BBNG, and it’s honestly shocking how well the two pair together. They also worked together on a song called Lavender on their new album and hot damn is it fire."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "it feels like something you'd hear during a heist scene in a movie and i love that"

**therokinrolla**: "oooh. nice guitar. Soothing. Gentle. This song is the literary equivalent of a nice bedtime story. lovely"

**robbiec_**: "dynamic duo"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Short instrumentals that slowly keep adding elements generally work really well."

**theultimatetrol**: "BBNG should do more features. Don't really like their solo stuff but their features and collabs are always gold"

**booooam**: ",5 its sounds like the typical BADBADNOTGOOD track for the first minute and then dissolves into a KAYTRANADA track. Pretty solid"

#how did nobody make a "this song is bad bad not good" joke?

**dirdbub**: "I’m super fucken gay you guys"

Our second opening track out (first if we don't consider "Intro" a song) is the glowing "Track Uno", the first and longest song on his debut! It's really quite stellar, a series of bright loops and disco synths repeating and being mixed around. It's really lovely, and even though it's obviously quite long he manages to do enough rhythm changes to keep things interesting. It's a great halfway between study music and danceable bops. **ThatParanoidPenguin** is probably the most positive about it: "A really strong instrumental intro. It’s extremely long, which might put off quite a few users here, but it takes a little loop and plays around with it for the duration of the near-6 minutes. It’s fantastic study music. The ending is especially great." The ending to this is actually used in GoldLink's "Meditation", which is a pretty cool usage of it! Albeit a little bit lazy, but who cares?

**skiddos** is also a fan: "one of the few instrumental tracks that are thoroughly interesting". When I told **therokinrolla** to participate in my rate, they were absolutely pumped after this song: "this track feels so fluid and organic. Its constantly switching up and doing new things. This guys technique is good and if the rest of the album is like this than we have good things coming". By the way, did you guys know that "Applause" is actually #2, not "G.U.Y."? I preferred the second one as #2, honestly, because the results were much less predictable. But yeah, therokinrolla loved it.


Knowing /r/popheads, most are obviously going to be turned off by its length. **timothy444** gives their 0 out with no regrets: "Sounds like one of those first-time projects where you're handed a brand new music making software and don't really know much of it. It's literally a bunch of random noises and stupid loops. So far, it's not an amazing start to this album." **MrSwearword**, my fellow *99.9%* fan, even thinks it's a bit long: "pleasant primer into the album but it does drag on". **dirdbub** seems to think it's long, too: "I’m super fucken gay you guys". I think **jvickery13** gets my thoughts well on this: "doesn't really go anywhere but i know a bop when i hear one".

---

**PossumAloysuis**: "A great introduction to the album. Love the funky basslines. Also love the beat at the end which GoldLink used on his own song Meditation."

**10footnotes**: "Feels like elevator music that's trying to escape from the elevator but not quite succeeding."

**robbiec_**: "the most pointless intro of these albums tbh"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is insanely long but gooddamn this makes me wanna dance for straight 5 minutes."

**VodkaInsipido**: "It’s like going to a retro ball on a space station where you start to get drunk and drunker."

**eklxtreme**: "I fuck with this vibe heavily. great way to start off and it really gets you into a trance"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "a little too long but groovy enough to make up for it"

Yet another KAYTRANADA song is out, with the wonderfully tropical "Leave Me Alone"! Shay Lia's voice on this is very seductive, with an almost whisper-like tone that complements the vibe well. The instrumental leads on from the vibe of "Lite Spots" well, with Caribbean rhythms and organ synths. It's quite trippy and fun, and the single line "sorry, baby, no time for this" is really cute.

Surprisingly, some found the instrumental controversial. **MrSwearword** thinks the vocals are the weak part of the song: "the vocals don’t quite work here but Kaytranada’s beat work covers all sin". **PossumAloysuis** and **ThatParanoidPenguin** were also fans of the very Caribbean percussion vibes. However, there's a constantly repeating vocal sample in this that likely turned most people off, like **theultimatetrol**: "The vocal samples get a bit annoying after a while". **BlasiFeelsSwift** seems to harbor a lot of hatred for this song, giving it his 0: "I hate this so fucking much and the worst part is that I don’t know why".

A couple of people were done with KAYTRANADA's sampling of interviews, like **SkyBlade79**: "Really big fan of this one, until the end. Considering what the name of the song is, this just seems like it’s throwing shade towards the guy in the interview." and **10footnotes**: "The song is nice, but -1 point because I’m so done with the self-hype on this album. It’s not even part of the actual song, just awkwardly tacked onto the end."

In an interview, KAYTRANADA discussed Shay Lia's voice and how he discovered her:

>[We have another song that gonna be on my album, and some girl that nobody knows yet—she’s from Montreal, her name is Shay Lia— \[she’s\] so original I can’t even explain. You should hear her voice.](http://www.thefader.com/2014/05/13/interview-kaytranada-xl)

It's clear that KAYTRANADA enjoys Shay Lia a lot: he's produced several of her songs including ["Losing Her"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10yVhVqEEY8) and ["Blue"](https://youtu.be/ykBmiFiBTZg), the latter also featuring Kay collaborators BADBADNOTGOOD. Her music is a wonderfully subtle type of alternative R&B, and very enjoyable for my taste. She even appeared at his Coachella set this year!

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh man, I adore that instrumental. It’s a really nice contrast to the vocals, and reminds me a bit of Lite Spots."

**PossumAloysuis**: "Love the island sounding drums and percussion. This sounds like it should've been all over radio"

**mokitsu**: "an anthem! hino!"

**dirdbub**: "I’m super fucken gay you guys"

**seferre2**: "fresh beat"

**therokinrolla**: "she meh"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "a little too repetitive"

**eklxtreme**: "her voice and the harmonies are so nice and I love how it alternates between the left and right audio. it's pretty trippy and it really grabs your attention."

#sorry baby no time for this

**jvickery13**: "introverts anthem bets part is the "SORRY BBS I'VE NOT TIME FOR THIS" slay me shay"

**booooam**: "this really sounds like something NAO would do, love the sorry baby no time for this part"

#DISAPPEARS

**dirdbub**: "\*leans out of window at 3:24am on a Tuesday night before a big final\* *phYSICAL EXIST****ANCE DISAPPEARS***"

Among my absolute favorites on the record, this song takes a while to get moving, but it's all so wonderfully crafted. From a slow, abrasive intro of buzzing and uncomfortable glitch effects, it goes right into a beautiful reverberated, airy drum and bass wobble. This is probably Flume's production at its peak: noisy percussion elements clashing with atmospheric pop synths. It's pulled off smartly and the pay off is so satisfying.

That isn't to discredit Kučka's own work on this, however. Her voice is sped up a bit, according to Flume, and the result is a very alien effect on her singing. Does she sound a bit like other high-pitched EDM girls? Sure, but why does it matter? She sings well, and she knows what she's doing. Her delivery on the bridge is such a climactic moment on the album, and it's what lifts this song into a 10 for me.

Most people felt that it dragged, however, like **therokinrolla**: "i feel like that intro was unnecessary, but it gets so much better afterwards". I'm beginning to see a theme here, honestly. Do you guys not like extended intros or outros to songs? **ThatParanoidPenguin** understands what they're going for best: "This song takes quite a bit to get started, but when it does, it’s a damn certified bop. It’s more atmospheric and smoky than most Flume songs, but it’s all the better for it." **seferre2** is one of the more positive raters, saying: "this is a weird song. weird production at parts. love the hook".

Others were mixed with the production choices. **thenshecamelikeaaah** says: "there's a little too much going on at times and I'm not sure everything fits well together but i still fuck with it." **TragicKingdom1** isn't too fond of this track's attempts at experimenting: "I think the SOPHIE-esque sounds filling this song really clash with the tinny and high-pitched vocals from Kucka. This also kind of lacks a melody."

And with that, the final KAYTRANADA instrumental is taken out! This song is admittedly quite funky, starting off with a funky guitar riff then slowly shifting into pointillist synth melodies. It's basically space-funk. However, this is probably on the lower end of my opinions on instrumentals in the rate, as it doesn't do too much for me. It's a bit too repetitive for my tastes, but I can see why people liked this.

Actually, I'm surprised at how overwhelmingly nice the response was:

**skiddos**: "FUCK ME UP"

**dirdbub**: "I’m super fucken gay you guys"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i cant dance but i try to when this song comes on anyway"

**PossumAloysuis**: "Straight outta the 80s and it's wonderful. The instrumental songs might be my favorites."

**mokitsu**: "SO funky and dance-y OMG! BOP."

**therokinrolla**: "this is so goddamn funky omfg"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Fun all around, keeps things mixed up so it never becomes boring."

**MrSwearword** has the most insightful comment: "it does capture 1980s style breakin’ music vibes but it feels like fresh take and not some retread"

In fact, **timothy444** is the harshest on KAYTRANADA: "This isn't a breakdancing lesson though. This is a lesson on how to make yourself the Lana Del Rey of Electronic Music". Yikes, that's one hot take! If we were really going to call KAYTRANADA boring, at least call him the Twenty One Pilots of Electronic Music. Lana Del Rey can at least make hip hop appropriation interesting.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Another good instrumental. Not much to say on this one, but it is a bit more entrancing than most of the songs on the record. I love the background synth."

**seferre2**: "pls dont roast me i dont like instrumentals"

**theultimatetrol**: "This feels more like an interlude, but goes on a little too long I think. Still really good tho"

**VodkaInsipido**: "It’s a bit too long, but still nice to listen to."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "when my wig starts to burn"

Our final Disclosure instrumental is also out today! The wonderful "When a Fire Starts to Burn" is such a great flip of a sample, honestly. It's genius to sample a motivational speech, and the way it's used is so catchy. The  way he says the words "right", "spread", and "fire" are so percussive and catchy, and it comes off as almost rap to me. It's classic UK dance, and the instrumental is excellently crafted. The song is best known from the [Chromecast commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G15Us30lsLE), which is pretty funny, I guess.

**timothy444** loves it! He says that "I used to hate this song so much when it came with a compilation album of all the latest 'hits' but not after giving this a listen again, I can't believe how much I was missing! Seriously, the beginning is probably the worst part of the song but as soon as the beat comes in, it goes BOOM!" **ThatParanoidPenguin** also loves the vintage vibes: "This is honestly timeless dance, with a vocal sample that just fits perfectly. Disclosure lends a hell of an instrumental here, and it only gets better as the song progresses. Despite the heavy old house inspiration, it sounds extremely fresh." **10footnotes** loves its structure: "That transition from the intro is everything. I love how smart this song is: every time the repetitive lyrics start getting annoying, the production changes and keeps the song interesting."

Most were obviously concerned about the sample, like **mokitsu**, who gave it their 0: "so boring and unenjoyable, very bad".

This songs is excellent, honestly, and I'm really happy that it outdid my expectations! This song is such a tonal shift from the rest of the record, eschewing the summer chill vibes for something more psychedelic and dark. It transitions from "You're the One" smoothly, using the shaking percussion and then adding bass-y synths to the backing. The song has less structure to it, and the result is a very interesting track that ends in a groovy climax with trippy synths and pleasant crooning from River Tiber.

I love the lyrics to this track, by the way. Here's a sampling of them:

>She’s burning here below my mind

>The green and purple smoke it rises, rises

>As every hidden wish collides

>Those illusions but I can’t deny it

That imagery is so dreamy and gorgeous, and it complements the atmosphere of the track well.

**SkyBlade79**, who wasn't very responsive to the album as a whole, enjoyed River Tiber's more dark vocalization: "I really like his delivery for some reason. This song really does bop." River Tiber really is a bit of a stand-out in term of what he contributes to the record, and that's likely what won him over. Even **dirdbub** enjoys it, saying "I’m super fucken gay you guys".

River Tiber is a Canadian musician best known from Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, as a sample on the track "No Tellin'". While his solo output consists of mostly alternative R&B and atmospheric pop featuring his vocals, he's worked extensively as a multi-instrumentalist, which is also why he's a contributor on the track "Bus Ride" with Karriem Riggins. His best known solo song is [West](https://youtu.be/sRsoE8q5sE8), a soulful track featuring singer Daniel Caesar.

**eklxtreme**: "nothing much happening here except for those keys which are really nice"

Yet another KAYTRA song is out! "Drive Me Crazy" was one of the first songs released from the album, and I'm just completely disappointed in how low this is. This song is a stellar experience front to back, and the beat switch at the end confirms it, with a guitar solo leading into an astral synth break on the album version. It even has a great "Lose Yourself" sample.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** is impressed: "Okay, this isn’t as good as Wimme Nah, but hot damn. Vic goes off on Kay beats, and this is no exception. This beat absolutely slaps, and Vic GOES OFF. This is a standout on an album of standouts, and I need them to collab more. Please. Also, the outro of this track bangs in a way little outros bang. So glad he added it on the album." **cloudbustingmp3** sums the entire vibe well: "hype!".

Vic Mensa is one of the many talented rappers working in the Chicago scene, first arising around 2013 with the mixtape *Innanetape*. He rose to popularity after touring with rappers such as Wale, J. Cole, and Danny Brown, as well as collaborating with rising contemporary Chance the Rapper. After this, he was featured in the XXL Freshman Class of 2014 to cap off his popularity. His debut single, "Down on My Luck", is a stellar hip house tune, which I honestly believe should've been a hit. It's danceable, fun, and well written pop rap with amazing production. Asides from that, he's also a featured vocalist on Kanye West's "Wolves" along with Sia Furler. His first album, *The Autobiography*, is set for release later this year.

Our final intro and instrumental is out! The lovely "Helix" deserves to rank high just for its gorgeous drop, which is slowly led into by flute synths and tropical ambience. When it hits, it hits HARD, and this introduction left a great impression on nearly everybody. The heavy bass intro is covered in exotic synths, and after this portion is extended as far as it can, it goes right into a build-up until the drop hits with clattering trap percussion and heavy sidechaining.

Flume himself considers the song two parts:

>[I started the first half of this song in Venice Beach and finished the last half in Mexico, a year later. It took me a long time to make it work. I still think of it as Helix pt.I and Helix pt.II](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFuVF7uTYhm/)

Instead of explaining their 11, **Mattymooz_** instead goes on a tangent likely about a penis: "FML THIS IS JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH AND GOES SO HARD and please don't take this out of context". If only there were context! **timothy444** loves it as well: "The official theme song to the Helix Fossil. Amazing start to an album!". By the way, I've never actually paid attention to Twitch Plays Pokémon. Did they complete the game?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** isn't really interested in the ambient lead up, but he's very pleased with the end result: "It’s an intro that is really kinda boring until the second half, but the second half is like a straight 10, it’s a banger instrumental and one of the better ones on the album." **theultimatetrol** thinks it's almost perfect, but wishes he'd cut some parts: "Flume invented airplane takeoff noise. Also that drop should be a bigger part of the track, the buildup was too long and the drop too short"

Oh, yikes. Another 11 on a KAYTRANADA song is out! The wonderful "Glowed Up" is absolutely glowing with energy from .Paak, one of the most hyped artists of 2016. The intro to this is easily one of the best, with a Moog-style synth waving up and down before breaking into .Paak's iconic delivery of the opening line:

>AND THERE STILL

>AIN'T A

>GOT

>DAMN

>THING THEY COULD TELL ME

The pairing is basically destined to be great, with KAY's pointillist disco electronics providing a backbone to the heavy bass and Anderson .Paak's raspy rapping. Then, when you think it's done, KAYTRANADA hits us with a brilliant beat switch, going into a calmer, chill instrumental to underlie a more moody half about fame and love.

While this pairing is almost perfect for me, some felt it didn't live up to what it could've been, like **MrSwearword**: "on paper/in theory this should work but oddly it feels like such a clash of funky personas". **mokitsu** and **SkyBlade79** share the same sentiment, the former saying "i HATE paak's voice but the production is amazing so i'm a bit coonflicted lol", and the latter "I really hate Paak’s voice. Forgive me. Also, this seems like two separate songs."

Of course, there was still a lot of love for the track. As **VodkaInsipido**'s 11 passes on, he has this to say: "This thing is a bop. A masterpiece. Front to back. Anderson Paak maybe doesn’t have a perfect voice, but he definitely has one for funk, R&B and hip-hop. And that’s perfectly mixed with the synths and drums on the track, plus the vocals before the switch. And then the switch. When those drums appears my pussy starts to quiver, and Anderson and Kaytranada snatch my wig, hair by hair. It’s too much. If you haven’t given this song a 11 wyd with your life." **eklxtreme** has a nice, vivid description as well: "the pounding synths and bass are incredible and paak's vocals are perfection as usual. the switch up at the end is the best moment of the album."

If you're unfamiliar with .Paak's work, the most /r/popheads friendly song is likely his work on Mac Miller's ["Dang!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR3GQfryp9M) and his own song [Am I Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvPeJLcK2Lk), both of which feature gloriously synth-y backing tracks. His trade is neo-soul with funky overtones, and he was featured on 6 of the tracks on Dr. Dre's "grand finale" comeback *Compton*. Another underrated track by him is on *Venice*, his debut, with the song ["Might Be"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl0N9hppt08). The beats are hot, with really gorgeous backing vocals. Apparently, the track/instrumental was given to artist DJ Luke Nasty, and the result was a lesser version.

---

#lately i've been GLOWED UP

**TragicKingdom1**: "Anderson .Paak is pretty great on everything tbh"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Do I need to explain why this is a 10? Anderson. Paak’s glorious vocals on a prime Kaytranada beat? This is some cosmic alien shit, and it eternally slaps. And there’s another amazing outro here? Flawless."

**skiddos**: "groovy"

**theultimatetrol**: "I think this is the first Paak track I heard. Also the first KAYTRANADA track. I was blown away but little did I know that the rest of his album would be even better"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "Paak is life <3"

**elvis-gold**: ".Paak kills this"

**mashluke**: "One of the best songs off this album, it's trippy and I love it, Anderson. Paak gives justice to the beat."

**PossumAloysuis**: "Another certified BANGER. Need more Paak/Kaytra. Love the outro"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "that change up in the vibe of it is soooo good"

#SHIT AND PISS ON YOUR HEAAAAAAD

**robbiec_**: "I hear this in bars and other places but no one in Northern Ireland knows who Kay or Paak are and frankly it's sickening but also sometimes the outro is too long so it lost not point two lmao"

**jvickery13**: "bit trap. bit shit. needs more melody 4 me"

This is the last rap song on Flume's album to go out, and one of the few singles. Why?

"Smoke & Retribution" is the perfect mesh of Flume's experimentation with synth tones and his pop sensibilities. Flume, Vince Staples and Kučka are essentially *the* dream team of electronic music, with Vince Staples riding the wonky beat fantastically until a sudden fade into a slower chorus, with Kučka vocalizing some shit about whatever smoke and retribution is. Her voice is so wonderfully suited to this track. I don't really know what the lyrics mean, but they're gorgeous. The build-up into the first chorus is jarring at first, but it makes the suddenness of the second hook even better, until the short instrumental break with the electronics from the intro reappearing. And then that beat hits AGAIN, even harder this time. **MrSwearword**: "it bangs hard".

Vince Staples is best known for[ pissing off Christian moms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NmvEt_cVA) with his Clams Casino-produced "Norf Norf", a dark banger from his debut *Summertime '06*. This year, he pissed off white gays on the charts with his sophomore record *Big Fish Theory*. This record took a radically different musical direction, instead focusing on more electronic, experimental beats influenced by dance music. ["Big Fish"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l9kzS_B7gg) features aquatic hip house beats, while ["Yeah Right"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iAzyhm0p0) has production from Flume himself and known PC Music-related act SOPHIE.

The latter even features Kučka herself alongside underground noname flop Kendrick Lamar! I don't know much about her and I honestly can't be arsed, but it's really good, and her work with Flume is always great! Her song ["Honey"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLEP0ceIc88) is gorgeous sifting pop, which sounds like the alien pop she makes with Flume, albeit tuned down a bit.

---

#YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Another certified Vince bop. I love the synths behind him here, and the contrast between him and Kučka. Also appreciate the Ramona Park reference."

**skiddos**: "okay, kinda cool"

**SkyBlade79**: "This was really fun to listen to. Vince Staples will always remind me of Gorillaz but this is a bop, and whatever her name is still sounds cool."

**PossumAloysuis**: "The best word to describe this is epic. Vince murdered this shit. The hook is incredible too."

**robbiec_**: "BANGER NEED MORE OF THIS"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The clash between Vince and Kucka isn't very expertly crafted imo, but I really like Vince's parts regardless."

**theultimatetrol**: "dis hard :fire emoji:"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "yes Vince fucking tell them"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Thought Kučka was Sophie. Talking about the elephant in the room, VINCE REEAAALLY CAME THROUGH."

**eklxtreme**: "the bass and the synths really hold the song up and vince and kucka are pretty good too"

**mashluke**: "I love this song. I can't describe what the contrast between Vince and KUČKA's voices makes me feel. It's just cool."

#:(

**mokitsu**: "vic mensa and vince staples sound too much alike"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "I’m sorry this isn’t doing it for me"

**seferre2**: "amazing synths. above average soundcloud rapping. boring hook tho"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "vince staples's parts are okay, but that knockoff aluna francis adds nothing yet again"

**awhile2**: "kučkas just a knockoff Aluna on this song but I don't mind"

#i'm deleting most of this, no
