[RATE REVEAL] Electronic Producers, day 1: When a fire starts to burn, right...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6opj3x/rate_reveal_electronic_producers_day_1_when_a/

Welcome to the first day of the electronic producers rate!

Are you ready to dance the pain of watching your fave die away?

* We're revealing #13 - #10 of the bonus rate, and #45 - #31 of the main rate today, starting at 3pm EST.

* We had **45 participants!** Not too shabby, especially considering it was at the same time as the lovely /u/therokinrolla's hugely popular 2013 rate.

* The average of every track is a **7.2383**.

* The controversy average is **1.9818**! Anything above this should be considered controversial.

The first bonus track is something pretty much everybody expected. This song is exclusive to an [online game](http://kaytranada.com/game/) which I suck at. It's a groovy instrumental, but it feels like he somewhat phoned it in on this. Asides from some interesting filtering and a nice breakbeat backing, it's basically what a parody of KAYTRANADA's music would sound like.

According to some nice YouTube commenters, this song was shouted out by Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui! A bass-heavy, chill instrumental, it's a bit of a far cry from the sound of *99.9%*, but I like it! Wonky influences on the synths and some nice vocal sampling makes for a decent beat track.

Here's a non-KAYTRANADA track! Disclosure features the ever-controversial crooner Sam Smith, Chic guitarist and musical legend Nile Rodgers, and... uh... Jimmy Napes on a groovy funk track. The Lawrence brothers mostly contribute a squelchy bass wobble that stays consistent through most of it, but it's clear they aren't the star of the song. It's mostly led by Sam Smith's soulful vocals as he sings lyrics that are basically a large wine metaphor for sex.

While I like the song, it's very short and gets little done in its two minutes. 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** echoes my sentiments, saying "Man I feel bad becaue Nile Rodgers is like one of the most important producers in pop music (she literally worked with Madonna) but this is not doing things for me at all." However, despite my qualms about it, it is a good track that makes me wish Sam Smith takes this direction on his next LP, as does **mokitsu**: "wow so good. i want sam to do more of this".

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "How have I never heard this before, this is amazing."

**SkyBlade79**: "sam is okay but this isn’t great"

**dirdbub**: "idk this has a groove it good"

**elvis-gold**: "Speaking of Sam Smith, why did he just drop off the map?"

Come on, guys. You could've done him better than this :(

"At All" is mostly just fucking around with a vocal sample of "AaaAAaA^aaat AAA^AAA ^^A ^AAA LL" and it still sounds amazing. Disco synths abound.

The music video is pretty cute, featuring KAYTRANADA and several female bodybuilders hanging out.

Yikes.

The first to go is the penultimate track to Flume's *Skin*, a 3 minute instrumental to provide a break after the emotional climax of the prior song. He uses a lot of high pitched wobbly synths and noises to open the track. When the track drops, the synths get heavily sidechained noisily as a sort of emotional climax with drums on every beat. Flume explained the title to "Free" in an Instagram post, saying that after months of writer's block the song was ["the moment I broke free"](https://www.instagram.com/p/BF1MwHqzYuy/).

It has the glitchiness and abrasiveness of other instrumentals on the album, but most thought it was really grating considering its late placement in the album like my dad, who compared this song to kung fu music in the car and wanted me to skip it. **skiddos** explains their 0 succinctly: "I never want to listen to this ever again lmao".

---

#free your mind

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "My second favorite instrumental. This shit bangs on vinyl, that is all." 

**SkyBlade79**: "This track is just AWESOME. One of the best instrumental tracks in the rate to just LISTEN to. It’s just so PRETTY!"

**PossumAloysuis**: "An absolute mess but gorgeous at the same time"

**dirdbub**: "this song makes me think about that one Mad Decent video that was in response to the Silicon Valley joke “40 MINUTES OF SNOWBOARDING VIDEOS SET TO DIPLO REMIXES” for no goddamn reason and I just want the world to know that"

**mokitsu**: "pretty nice"

**awryj**: "At first it sounded atrocious to me, but then it transformed into something incredible. Honestly, I think the more experimental Flume songs get, the better they are."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I read up that Flume had trouble writing music and had creative block. He decided to buy a one-way ticket to Tasmania, found a log cabin in the woods and just basically isolated himself for 10 days and that's when his creative block was broken. Hearing the song in this context really made me apperciate the song more as this is Flume letting his creative freedome fly free again."

#and your ass will follow

**MrSwearword**: "if I could nuke two songs with a “0” this would be the 2nd one."

**jvickery13**: "turn it off"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "it feels like a more interesting song is being fast forwarded and slowed down at the same time and im dizzy now"

**seferre2**: "ok i swear i don't hate instrumental tracks but face it.... this one's lame"

**therokinrolla**: "ieufhgoaiwsuefilzsehgfiulsdzerghfoiuesargfoiuegfszeoidygfoswedzfsgy"

**robbiec_**: "lol he's just going up and down on the keyboard but the drums stopped this from getting a two"

**eklxtreme**: "i suppose i like the concept he was going for but it's a bit too much"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The wailing sound that dominates this song makes it hard to enjoy."

"Pika" is an interlude that exists, I guess. It's not bad musically, per se, but it doesn't stand on its own. There's some weird pitched down vocals in the track that are kind of off-putting and some low humming synths that are somewhat emotionally evocative. However, asides from the repeating 8-bit melodies, it's just a break after the chaos of "Wall Fuck" in the album. Nothing more, nothing less.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** says it best: "I’m a sucker for electronic instrumental weirdness, but this is not at all captivating or interesting to me. I like the sounds by themselves, but as a whole picture, it’s bland and without direction." As one of the highest ratings, **awryj** considers one of the most important electronic producers ever to be an influence on the track, saying "Weird and jittery, I love it. Makes me think of Aphex Twin."

Can you believe that this once rated actually pretty highly? The first track out of *Settle* is the predictable choice, but hilariously makes it over two "real" songs. I think this actually does somewhat pass as a standalone track, which is part of why I kept it in the rate (the other part being that it evens out the tracklist to 45 songs). It's sonically different from the track it leads into, with a different, more subtle beat with finger snaps and a woozy backing. It's genuinely quite pretty, but it lasts for one minute. Serves its purpose well, though, which is why it stayed so long.

I thought the sample was from an actual preacher, like from the video, but it ended up being a [sample from a motivational speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvz7nHbKhfY)! Fun fact of the day, I guess.

And another Disclosure track is taken out!

I have to say, I'm kind of disappointed this track didn't go too far. Sure, it's a short centerpiece(?), but it's the furthest that the album strays away from its own sound until the final song. Disclosure use vocals from "Get Along With You" by Kelis to create a nice division between the first and second half of the album.

Despite the amount of screwing around Disclosure did with the sample, they definitely use it tastefully, building a quality future garage track around their vocal cutting and pitching. **MrSwearword** catches the sample's source immediately: "OH MY GOD THEY DID A WEIRD INTERLUDE STYLE COVER OF/HOMAGE TO “GET ALONG WITH YOU” BY KELIS".

Several people found it a little boring or irritating as an interlude, however, such as **ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I literally don’t remember this existing? Like, I’m now remembering why I don’t play Settle in full often."

**PossumAloysuis**: "2 minutes of pure euphoria."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "honestly would work better as a shorter interlude"

**10footnotes**: "Sounds like you’re listening to a song called “First Chance” while on drugs."

**seferre2**: "overproduced just a little. not very exciting"

**therokinrolla**: "jesus fucking christ"

**robbiec_**: "lad"

**theultimatetrol**: "meh. Kinda weird interlude that's pretty unnecessary"

**awhile2**: "this is like what flume tried to do with Wall Fuck and when everything was new but failed"

**jvickery13**: "insert donald trump joke here"

Featuring a [sample from the late J Dilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ZidlrDJZs), Disclosure create another house track with the four-on-the-floor beats they've used throughout the album. It's very bound to its own concept, mostly using variations of the same metallic, plinky lead melody against the vocal sample. **ThatParanoidPenguin** seems to enjoy it: "I love the sound of this. It’s really UK and it’s really sinister, with one of the weirdest instrumentals I’ve heard on dance track in a while." **cloudbustingmp3** felt that it was "repetitive but JUST varied enough in the way it ramps up and down to keep it exciting", which just about sums up my own thoughts. It's classic UK house, and even though the sample can be a bit grating, there's enough detail to it that I can forgive the 5 minute long duration.

A lot of users weren't so keen on it, however. **MrSwearword** says something that I can actually kind of see considering the production: "It’s supposed to read like “GET HUH” or any type of vogue battle/drag queen magic but the vocals need to commit to the beat". "Grab Her!" is the last of the instrumentals featured on Settle, and most felt that the album's beats weren't varied enough, like **thenshecamelikeaaah** (lmao): "There's some cool stuff going on with the instrumentation, but it gets old fast when you've been listening to the same thing for almost an hour."

Yet another instrumental is out! Does this show that the instrumentals so far aren't nearly as good as feature tracks on the albums, or that /r/popheads is biased against instrumentals in general? "3" is mostly just a nice hip hop beat with glitch elements and sounds. **dirdbub** takes a moment away from shitposts to say that "I feel like this just kind of drones on too long as a song, nothing particularly interesting happens except for the slightly off-kilter drop buildup that happens". It's not a bad song, per se, but it's only a beat with some weird moaning from Harley Streten himself and interesting wonky percussion.

Some people found it good, however. **awryj** says "I really like these shitty MIDI drums." Are these really MIDI drums? I'm not too familiar with it, but hey. Even **MrSwearword** at least saw something nice in it: "well the beat is all over the place but still distinct of Flume, I suppose"

Our first track with a featured vocalist is out!

Instead of making a pop track like the other producers did using Aluna Francis's talents or what Flume had done with the other female vocalists on the record, he created what ended up being the longest track in the entire rate: an almost structureless ambient track with hazy electronics and clattering percussion. It's mostly a track of progression and slowly shifting elements rather than a pop track, which is probably why this ended up the first feature track cut. It was definitely an outlier of the three AlunaGeorge tracks in this rate.

It was pretty controversial, reactions ranging from absolute pain (**MrSwearword**: "OH MY GOD MAKE THIS STOP IT IS SO BAD") to finding it completely beautiful (**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Ahhhhh, this tragic is so airy and cinematic. AlunaGeorge is used sparingly here, and it gives the feature all the more impact."). Most commented on how weirdly Francis's vocals are used on the track, feeling like her contribution was wasted on meandering. My dad asked me to skip this in the car, and he said that he felt like he was on drugs.

**seferre2** wins for the most vivid description: "i love alunageorge but her voice is very annoying here. i was hoping for some flume-y synths that would compliment her voice well but i was disappointed. all i got was a sound of what i believe is cp30 and r2d2 dry humping. also it drags on forever"

---

**jvickery13**: "added 2 points for my bae aluna. it's actually kinda magical"

**mokitsu**: "AlunaGeorge deserve better than to repeat the same lines 50 times over a boring production!"

**skiddos**: "I wanted to like this because of AlunaGeorge, but the score just kept getting lowered as the song progressed. Really grating."

**SkyBlade79**: "why is this song 10 years long? Regardless, it’s really great and varied, though the crinkling sound in the background is SUPER annoying."

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "a song shouldnt take nearly 3 minutes to start getting mildly interesting"

**therokinrolla**: "why is this 6 minutes long nnn"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Way too long relative to how much happens on this track."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This doesn't need to be that long."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "I kinda like the chilled out vibe of this, but AlunafuckingGeorge's voice, combined with the repitition, combined with no progression, combined with it being too long, makes it a no for me."

**elvis-gold**: "Despite being six minutes long, it doesn't really feel like this song goes anywhere."

**VodkaInsipido**: "like going to hell but from your home"

#comparisons to the other aluna features

**eklxtreme**: "waste of alunageorge feature. pretty repetitive and kinda boring"

**booooam**: "the weakest AlunaGeorge collab tbh"

**theultimatetrol**: "This one>Together>White noise. I doubt popheads agrees tho"

**awhile2**: "the worst track to feature Aluna in this rate and possibly the worst song I've ever heard her on"

**PossumAloysuis**: "AlunaGeorge does it again. 3 for 3 on all these. Love the chimes and distortion in the background."

**awryj**: "Absolutely gorgeous, best AlunaGeorge collab in the rate. The structure of the track is very original."

#this is interesting but I don't see it tbh

**robbiec_**: "interesting, I think Aluna said this song was inspired by Amy Winehouse which I thought was interesting/nice"

Finally, a song from *99.9%* is out! It's a cute little 2 minute interlude, not much to it, with a sample of [an interview between Skrillex and radio presenter Sway](https://youtu.be/z2dlKX5SKDg?t=896) discussing KAYTRANADA's music. Is it a good standalone song? It's nice, I suppose, but there's nothing to it other than some nice elevator beats. **cloudbustingmp3** describes it as a "retrofuturistic martini lounge moment", which is pretty nice and vivid for a 2 minute track to portray. **MrSwearword**, the only 10, loves it: "jazzy style electronic interlude? YES PLEASE".

Of course, being mostly an interlude, it drew some displeasure with those who weren't in love with the album's style, like **jvickery13**: "boring. skip.".

Another feature track is out, this time featuring British singer-songwriter MNDR! I really, really thought this would go further, but I think its placement on the latter half really destroyed its rating. By the end of the album, most were tired of Flume's production tricks, like **therokinrolla**: "honestly this isnt anything new or special. It feels like its using the same tricks from all the other songs".

I really love what this track does as a standalone, despite most not finding it too special, like **eklxtreme**: "pretty repetitive and boring, waste of feature". In my opinion, it's very cute and emotional, and honestly makes a better closer than "Tiny Cities" does to the record. The climax with the whole "ALL I NEED, ALL I NEED" screaming is amazing.

MNDR is best known for her featured vocals on Mark Ronson's [Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hlcG7TnpuM) alongside A Tribe Called Quest's own Q-Tip. Her first album features a lot of dark electropop, like the title track [Feed Me Diamonds](https://youtu.be/wmuT1qUFA4Y), the video of which features RPDR contestant Raven. The single [Kimono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJXwyFVv8G4) was released as a teaser for her upcoming album, *The Mainstream* in 2015. Her most recent work is a collaboration with the Scissor Sisters on the single [SWERLK](https://youtu.be/yj6O-z8IwzQ), a single released in honor of the one-year remembrance of the Pulse nightclub shooting.

mmmm

"Stimulation" is probably the closest to being downright vintage stylistically *Settle* gets, with a sample of soul vocalist Jill Scott being cut up and placed over snappy percussion and a gorgeous UK bass wobble. Its production is very sexual and raw, which **robbiec_** clearly enjoyed: "this is still hot though".

**mokitsu** was clearly not impressed: "here they go with the repetitive samples again". The main problem most had was that 5 minutes was too long for the song, which is pretty reasonable in my opinion. **theultimatetrol**, who otherwise enjoyed it, said: "Good funkay. That delayed bass note makes this track. Only thing it's a little too long".

And there goes my 0!

"You Know" is probably the furthest any of the albums goes from the record's aesthetic. It's a clear contrast to the two other hip hop songs, because this one isn't really anything near some sort of "banger": it's clearly a more dramatic, cinematic song. Allan Kingdom contributes soulful vocals to the beginning and end of the track, while Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon illustrates an honestly pretty interesting story about killing somebody who betrayed him.

Honestly, I have nothing against lyrical rap songs! I just felt like this song didn't do anything in particular other than tell a story. Flume's production on this feels nonexistent, and Allan Kingdom's parts feel like a throwaway. I feel like they kind of phoned it in on this track, which is why it got my 0. 

**skiddos** notes the tonal shift positively: "wow! didn't expect such a serious song, I'm shook", while **seferre2** isn't wowed at all: "i don't like the idk... dark vibes that this gives i just want that flume sound". **SkyBlade79** also agrees with the fact that it's a hugely weird outlier in the album, but still manages to appreciate it: "This song just seems so out of place on the album. It just doesn’t fit at all. Regardless, it’s a good song, even though it’s not what I was expecting."

My own personal experience with Allan Kingdom's solo work is limited, but something I think most people will recognize him from is his work on [All Day](https://youtu.be/_ABk7TmjnVk) by Kanye West. His song [Wavey](https://youtu.be/kCw_uXuil8k) with Spooky Black might be of interest to some, featuring very dreamy production that gave me Antwon vibes. Fuck, wait, how many popheads are seriously gonna know who Antwon is? It's cloud rap.

Raekwon is a member of Wu-Tang Clan, a classic 90s hip hop group that most should really get into for an understanding of music as a whole. To be honest, when I listened to 36 Chambers I didn't really dig it, but I wasn't actively listening. His song [Ice Cream](https://youtu.be/Oz3z33Zyg3s) is a beautiful ode to mint chocolate chip and rocky road.

**timothy444**: "Australian Linkin Park! Nice!"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Flume with Allan Kingdom and Raekwon is a wild combination, but it’s smooth as hell and all I’m wondering is why that didn’t happen sooner."

**PossumAloysuis**: "Flume keeps the certified BANGERS coming. Rae killed this like the guy in his verse. In the words of ODB, Wu-Tang is for the children"

This track honestly made it higher than I expected! Attracting two 0s, this song was clearly quite controversial.

**jvickery13**: "yas go home beck (and flume)"

As the closer for the album, you can tell Flume wanted to make a very euphoric finale for the whole thing. Beck provides some rather emotional vocals to the track, singing something about finding his way home or whatever. It's clear that there's an attempt to end the album on a high note, with a very unique, almost airy drop that manages to bring closure to the album's very chaotic instrumentals. Beck's singing on this track occasionally even goes into really pleasing melodies.

However, the main problem most people had with this track is how *weird* Beck sounds on it. His voice has a very nasal tone to it, which is what used to turn me off of listening to this track in full. Its attempts at bringing out emotion fall flat for me. Flume's very subdued and atmospheric production on this does not match Beck's vocals well.

As the closer to the record, opinions on it were varied. **MrSwearword** thinks Beck works on it, but he's mostly relieved that the whole thing's over: "at least Beck sounds like he belongs as a collaborator but screw this album". **PossumAloysuis** enjoys their collaboration, though: "Excellent outro. Need more Beck over electronic production." However, most responses to this were general disappointment. **Wtucker4** is the only 11, summarizing their love quite eloquently: "the drop at 1:50 scalps me everytime".

If there's one thing Beck loves doing, it's delving into different styles whenever he pleases, which is the most likely reason he's on here. His song [Dreams](https://youtu.be/oTM3YPTYNo0) was pretty popular on alternative stations, and had come just after he won the Grammy Album of the Year award for the soft folk rock *Morning Phase*. Throughout his career, he's delved into genres from hip hop to electronic funk. My favorite track I've heard from him is [Devil's Haircut](https://youtu.be/aa3rBVb3v4g).

---

**timothy444**: "A perfect closer to an absolutely incredible electronic album!"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I know this is gonna get fucked real hard. It’s a song with a Beck feature that most seem to have distaste for, and then has a rough instrumental portion that seems dissonant and unattached to the first part. I love it all though, and had no idea there was hatred for this track. It’s a wild and yet fitting closer, something that really speaks to Flume’s production style."

**skiddos**: "yawn"

**SkyBlade79**: "Sorry Beck but I can’t dig this…"

**dirdbub**: "this is getting a higher score purely to spite kappy’s hatred for this song, but I can’t force myself to give it anything higher than this"

**seferre2**: "i think if flume wanted beck so much he should've just stuck with a remix. still good production. beck's vocals in this song do nothing for me"

**therokinrolla**: "damn talk about a good closer. Beck has an amazing voice, and coupled with some of Flume’s best production on this album this is just fantastic"

**robbiec_**: "what was Beck doing in twenty sixteen and yes I'm typing every number that isn't a score in letters because I know the perils of programming haha"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Beck sounds great on this but the subdued-yet-upbeat tone isn't a perfect match with Flume's production."

**theultimatetrol**: "I dunno why he got Beck on, but it kinda works"

**awhile2**: "love beck, love flume but this song is ass"

**-dolantello-**: "ok flume i love you. beck i love you. but holy shit this song is painful to listen to. pretty tragic way to end an album :/"

**eklxtreme**: "grabs the nostalgic vibe nicely, but i think the unconventional song structure made this a little forgettable"

Another *99.9%* track is out! This time, it's "Bus Ride", the gorgeous chill instrumental featuring strings and horns played by River Tiber and drum work by the talented Stones Throw artist Karriem Riggins. It's no banger, obviously, but it's clearly a wonderful, if subtle, instrumental. I love the drumming on this, and how it start to quicken its pace near the end of the track, and the horn arrangements are gorgeous.

Most reactions were mixed, however, at how ambient this track is. **MrSwearword** was not impressed, particularly at this song's contrast after the intro track: "after trippy funk to be taken to bland ambient adjacent work is disappointing".  **elvis-gold** feels the same: "A little slow for the second track. Would have been nice to keep up the momentum coming off the beat switch of Track Uno." **10footnotes** disagrees, however: "Progresses well from the track before it, but still very elevator-y." **BlasiFeelsSwift** is familiar, saying "I recognize this, it’s played in trains here. Lmao. Also after this track an ad came up and I totally thought it was part of the song."

There were some people who felt the same way I did about the song, though. **PossumAloysuis** adored it: "Everything about this song is perfect, from the drums to the beautiful keys". **mokitsu** is rightfully confused, considering the fact that River Tiber is usually a vocalist, but is still charmed: "wtf does river tiber do on this? anyway, love it. the percussion is everything."

Karriem Riggins is a member of the amazing hip hop label Stones Throw. His first album, *Alone Together*, was an array of beats mostly featuring his jazz drumming, with samples abound. Listening to the record, it's clear why KAYTRANADA would want to work with him: from the Portuguese flavored ["Summer Madness"](https://youtu.be/hfEAusoydGQ) to the cheesy 60s/70s synth inspired ["Moogy Foog It"](https://youtu.be/k-Ru_Y24dFo), it's clear that Karriem Riggins enjoys the same type of eclecticism that KAYTRANADA explores on *99.9%*. Riggins' sophomore album, *Headnod Suite*, was actually released this year!

Our last song for the day is probably a shocker! The first of two songs on *Skin* that demand you to perform an action on an unnamed "it", "Lose It", was once one of the first couple of songs out. After a couple of later scores, the song almost managed to make it to another day! Unfortunately, it couldn't.

What used to turn me off about "Lose It" was that Vic Mensa's flow on this was absolutely *clumsy*. Most of this track just felt like a mess, including the somewhat tacky pre-chorus ("aaaAAAyYYYYY") and the whooping "loooose it!", but eventually it grew on me enough. The outro is the type of sidechained synth play that I love from Flume, so I was generous. The piano bridge surprised me a bit, and I feel like Flume really paid attention to the production on this to make it a well-done pop song.

Here's what Flume himself had to say in an Instagram post:

>["I thought the weird sound at the start of the track sounded like electronic whale calls, so before Vic got on it, this track was called Electro Whale Symphony."](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFu9-OCzYjt/?taken-by=flumemusic)

The comments were surprisingly quite negative near the start, with **jvickery13** being irritated by the high pitched sounds: "it physically hurts my ears. call me basic but i'd rather flume just chilled a bit. hook is especially abysmal". **10footnotes** sums up my main thoughts: "That Nagasaki lyric is definitely not okay. The production is fine, but it's hard to appreciate when Vic Mensa is yelling at me and going "aaaeeeuuuaaaaaeeeee." The outro is the best part - even though it's aggressive, it still feels like peace and quiet because of the lack of vocals."

**ThatParanoidPenguin** compares it to the other Mensa collab that's on *99.9%*, saying: "This isn’t the best Vic Mensa collab in this rate, but it’s a great one. Vic snaps here, and the beat winds up and up and doesn't let you down at the final drop. Vic and a raging electronic beat go hand in hand, and this is no exception." **PossumAloysuis** thinks it's just as good: "Just like with KAYTRA, another BANGER from Vic. Catchy pre-hook".

**MrSwearword**: "what kind of midi file beat and blugh Vic Mensa again"

**timothy444**: "It's kinda a weak track for me. The beat is pretty good don't get me wrong but (I can't believe I'm saying this) the vocals just break the atmosphere a little. It would've been great as an instrumental."

**mokitsu**: "love vic but this just doesn't work"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "not my thing"

**skiddos**: "so noisy!"

**SkyBlade79**: "I’m not quite sure how I feel about this song. The production is really cool at the start but it gets repetitive fast, and Vic sounds really bad, and I like Vic Mensa. Sorry."

**dirdbub**: "**hits biggestf uckcing blunt** yeah I've smoked weed twice"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "this annoying ping! sound tho"

**seferre2**: "maybe i don't like the featured artist but the production is great"

**therokinrolla**: "i like the production here MUCH more than Vic’s really inconsistent vocals"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The way he says "lose IT!" is kind of grating but otherwise this is pretty good."

**theultimatetrol**: "Great production, but the Loooose it is annoying"

**awhile2**: "love the chorus and drop on this song but these are some of Vic's worst verses"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I really don't like Vic Mensa's flow here. It's an interesting song proudction wise though. The final minute of the song tho.....so good."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "insane"

**elvis-gold**: "The "LOO-OOSE IT!"s in the hook are just... not good."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Vic (almost) always kills it, and the production on the chorus is amazing."

**eklxtreme**: "absolute banger. i love the keys and the synths so much."
