[RATE REVEAL] Electronic Producers, day 3: Will you be the one to take a stand, make the girls dance?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6p357v/rate_reveal_electronic_producers_day_3_will_you/

Welcome to the final day of the electronic producers rate!

Who will win?

* We're revealing #5-#1 of the bonus rate, and #15-#1 of the main rate today, starting at HOPEFULLY 4:30pm EST.

* We had **46 participants!** Not too shabby, especially considering it was at the same time as the lovely /u/therokinrolla's hugely popular 2013 rate.

* The average of every track is a **7.2877**.

* The controversy average is **1.9907**! Anything above this should be considered controversial.

1. Never Be Like You
1. You and Me
1. Together
1. Say It
1. Latch
1. F For You
1. Help Me Lose My Mind

The first remix in the bonus rate is out, with the gorgeous "Running" remix that launched Disclosure to an audience! Featuring excellent vocals from the original song, this track is high-quality UK dance with flair. It's not WOW good, but it's just objectively at least pleasant, you know? It's music for shopping at Express, and it's great at what it does. They use a lot of the same fade ins of vocals they use on the album, and many of the same techniques. The verses are great, with classic garage beats and shakers.

**mokitsu** seems to enjoy it, comparing it to their other track in the rate, "Confess to Me": "further proves my theory that jessie ware only makes good music with disclosure".

**skiddos** is the only truly negative comment, saying: "wish jessie ware's voice wasn't drowned out in the remix tbh"

Alas, KAYTRANADA leaves the bonus rate, at least with a banger! This remix takes the vocals of Janet Jackson's song "If" off her album *janet.*, and uses them to create a funky house banger! It's a gorgeous reinvention of the track, featuring huge bass drums and sidechained vocals to create an ethereal remix of an already legendary song. Jackson's vocals are reduced to a whisper until the chorus hits, then going into a smooth hook section that soon gets amazing as the bass kicks in. This remix is honestly perfect in my eyes, but hey.

In all honesty, I agree with **cloudbustingmp3**! The remix is amazing, and for me it lifts the track to a whole new level. He said: "not to be blasphemous but i prefer this remix to the already godly original version. everything about it is so RIGHT and smooth and i just LOVE IT"

Surprisingly, **dirdbub**'s comment is also insightful: "I’m super fucken gay you guys"!

An astonishing track straight from the album *Settle* is made even grander by featuring the vocals of noted new jack swing/R&B artist Mary J. Blige! Her vocals on this are amazing, taking the track's already catchy monotone vocal track and then adding classic house soul to it. She sounds like she could be on a number of 80s/90s deep house tracks with the way she naturally fits into the song.

On her new record *Strength of a Woman*, Mary J. Blige actually works with KAYTRANADA and his frequent collaborators BADBADNOTGOOD on ["Telling the Truth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdyYYwokhI0) on a pretty great dance number featuring clattering percussion and gorgeous synthetic tones courtesy of Kay and BBNG. Kudos to /u/Kaphox reminding me that this collab existed several, several months ago! Another excellent track from the record is ["Love Yourself"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLO5gdSqY7Y), a song featuring an amazing Kanye West verse over LR/CD-esque (that's possibly off-base) neo-soul beats and her excellent vocal abilities.

This song is a great second place, honestly. It's a future house track, with metallic kick drums and Kučka's vocals being manipulated around the really amazing glitch backing. In essence, "Hyperreal" is what I wish the second half of *Skin* had been like, and would have improved the record by just being tacked on the end. It's brilliantly fun, and **Mattymooz_** honestly puts it best: "When Flume can Disclosure better than Disclosure can". These synths are some of the most gorgeous Flume's ever used.

**jvickery13**: "i really like this, if this is where flume is headed im back on board"

**mokitsu**: "wow why did he throw away the best tracks? this and the companion pieces would've made an incredible album"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not the best song in the rate about white noise, but a damn good one. I love the way Kučka’s vocals and the beat fall apart before the chorus, it’s so visceral and menacing."

**SkyBlade79**: "now this is pretty cool"

**dirdbub**: "#**why the fuck wasn’t this forest fire on the album**"

**awryj**: "There's something in this song that makes it stand out for me, but I can't really pinpoint it. Maybe it's the weird slowed down vocal thing? The intro? Or is it this terrifying distorted noise around 2:00? Anyway, I really like it. Also Kučka sounds here like Aluna more than ever."

The bonus rate winner that NOBODY AT ALL expected!

Oh, whatever. The race was surprisingly quite close, though, but this was the only #1 throughout the entire bonus rate. The remix of Tennis Court is an amazing reinterpretation of the original, managing to evoke the moodiness of the original but makes into a grand statement of Flume's aesthetic. Like the other remixes in the bonus rate, this one put Flume on almost everybody's radar. Lorde is one of the subreddit's favorites, and a Flume remix as well? There's no wonder everybody loved it:

**Mattymooz_**: "WHY WAS THIS NEVER OFFICIALLY RELEASED"

**jvickery13**: "best flume song, hearing this live was an ethereal experience"

**mokitsu**: "remixing a Lorde song is probably a big challenge but omg he made it work. chills."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this I like"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is one of Flume’s greatest works ever. A song that transforms the tone of the original song while retaining what made it great. You can feel the sheer intensity and power in this one."

**skiddos**: "the original is a 10 and this is almost as good as the original"

**dirdbub**: "one of the best remixes I’ve ever heard, simple fact. Flume just effortlessly transforms this song into something magical, almost out-of-this-world. if you’re remixing a song, there are really two acceptable routes you can take: a) taking the feeling/meaning of the original mix and giving it a new vibe, or b) completely tossing out the original feeling/meaning of the original mix and going for something new. somehow Flume accomplished both methods for me"

In fact, several people wished the bonus rate was in the main rate JUST so they could give it their 11:

**awryj**: "If I could, I would probably give it my 11. This song introduced me to Flume and it's still unreal."

**robbiec_**: "would-be eleven"

**theultimatetrol**: "Okay I don't care about the other bonus tracks but this deserves an 11. Even though I gave it away already. Fuck"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This remix is fucking amazing oh my god. I wish I could give this my 11."

A Disclosure song makes its way out, along with 2 11s! The intro to this song sounds like water dripping, before going into Jessie Ware's silky, sensual voice. It's a great complement to the track, and then it hits that metallic synth chorus and drop. **dirdbub** puts it best: "man I fucken love bass house, these synths always slay me". I honestly can't believe it wasn't a shitpost. **This is one of two songs that feature vocals from Disclosure member Howard Lawrence, singing the chorus to it.** The chorus to this is easily one of the most fun and different on the album, and it's so vibrant and pretty.

Most people were familiar with Ware, and were pleased with her performance. **mokitsu** is a fan of the singing on this, giving it his 11: "what a banger, such an infectious chorus, luv it. jessie ware sounds SO good." **cloudbustingmp3** shows their opinion on Jessie Ware clearly: "im kinda biased because i love Jessie Ware, but i'll be damned if this isn't a bop anyway".

However, some weren't too keen on her performance, like **MrSwearword**: "great beat, but Jessie Ware is bad on this". **skiddos** wishes her vocals were used more, but still enjoys it: "Jessie Ware has a wonderful voice that is sorely underutilized in this song. Great song tho." **seferre2** is probably one of the few with a negative opinion towards the techno-esque production: "i think the production ruined it for me tbh. i like the vocoder effect and melody"

Jessie Ware, along with Jai Paul, James Blake, and Jamie Woon (JJJJ???), are amongst the scene of British singers and musicians who laid down the framework of modern R&B. Their bass-influenced production eventually created alternative R&B's aesthetic of atmospheric beats and soulful crooning. Her song ["Wildest Moments"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMJkddvJ4L4) is very anthemic, with punchy drums and wonderful backing vocals. The Julio Bashmore-produced ["Running"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvlFWmvgeVI) was one of the first tracks of the alternative R&B scene, and Disclosure's remix only helped the style develop.

**jvickery13**: "the build is sexy, the hook/drop.... not so much"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is the best beat on the album, purely and simply. It’s got those Katy B vibes, and Jessie Ware brings the absolute heat on the vocals. It would’ve been a phenomenal closer tbh."

**SkyBlade79**: "I really loved her voice and delivery!"

**PossumAloysuis**: "Wonderful all around."

**therokinrolla**: "a nice bop to even out the rest of this tragic album"

**robbiec_**: "this is the audio equivalent of tanning to me"

**theultimatetrol**: "I mean this differs a lot from the other tracks but it's also really annoying"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "I really like Jessie Ware so I enjoyed this. The instrumental felt fresh too."

**elvis-gold**: "Jessie sounds great here, especially considering how subdued her own music is."

**VodkaInsipido**: "The distorted vocals and the more techno beat makes it stand out from the last songs. Crazy bop."

**eklxtreme**: "jessie's vocals are angelic. very nice dynamics on this."

Our second closer is out, and another KAYTRANADA song! The gorgeous "Bullets" starts out great with a drum beat that hits hard, until Little Dragon vocalist Yukimi Nagano comes in to provide her wonderful vocals to a very subtle track. The bassline is funky, and the sifting electronics are gorgeous. Her vocals are perfect for the closer, as it feels like a very entrancing, hypnotic song to end on. The drumming on this is fantastically used, and the rising filters on the synths are masterfully utilized to add a lot of depth to the track. Near the end, there's a fantastic bridge, with her singing being reduced quietly while the filtered synths are amped up in distortion. Slowly, it almost feels like KAYTRANADA is gonna end the album on an electro house drop. Then, it switches back to the original instrumental, with a subtly added plinky little synth. It's a closer that made me wish for more, and the ending bass note is what takes me back to the beginning of the album.

**jvickery13** isn't impressed by KAYTRANADA's drumming on the album, and compares the track to another Little Dragon collaboration: "bit sick of these drums now. wildfire is better". If you haven't heard it, "Wildfire" by SBTRKT is a fantastic UK dance track featuring Nagano's vocals in an erotic bop. It's dripping in sensuality, and it's a great single from the producer, who I need to check out more. **skiddos** points out the similarities between *Skin* and *99.9%*: "interesting that this album and Skin both have AlunaGeorge, Vic, and Little Dragon as features". Those three artists were clearly quite busy that year in terms of electronic music!

**therokinrolla** is very upset: "who the hell is little dragon and why is her shitty voice paired with shitty production". This is just confusing, though. Wait until you see their comment on "Take a Chance".

---

**MrSwearword**: "doesn’t really do anything that unique but it proves that for the most part, 99.9% is a consistent album throughout."

**mokitsu**: "i love her voice, not his best but still pretty good"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Someone convince me Little Dragon isn’t the secret queen of electronic collabs. On Bullets, she services well on the closer track, a smoky song with some awesome synths and drums."

**dirdbub**: "I’m super fucken gay you guys"

**ExtraEater**: "underratED AS FUCK"

**PossumAloysuis**: "Another absolutely perfect song. Yukimi's vocals compliment the beat very well."

**TragicKingdom1**: "I was hoping for a more bombastic conclusion to the album, but Little Dragon also works well with Kay's style."

**theultimatetrol**: "This production is so tight. Heavily underrated track"

**eklxtreme**: "one of the groovier and catchier songs."

Another Disclosure anthem is out! This time, they feature British singer Sasha Keable on a typical Disclosure style track, with thumping house beats and a strong vocal performance by Keable, bringing to mind classic dance divas of the 90s. The "I-TRIED-TO-RE-SIST" chorus is stellar, proving Disclosure's knowledge of pop songwriting well. It's not too different from other Disclosure singles, but it's strong on it's own.

I remember **MrSwearword** even considered this track his 11 once, simply saying now: "Disclosure’s GOAT". It's practically flawless, and I don't even remember why I gave it only a 9. **mokitsu** isn't too impressed with it: "a standard disclosure banger. there are better ones." It does feel quite unoriginal, and even 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** has little to say about it: "Are the drums literally any different than on Stimulation."

Sasha Keable's music isn't on Spotify with the exception of a feature on [Zinc's track "Only For Tonight"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwMsa8SKA1c), her singing being highlighted well by the "Confess to Me" bass synths.

This song was once #3 in the entire rate! What's with the drop in ranking? The only track on the second half of the album to survive the first day, it survived surprisingly gracefully. Perhaps it was the huge climax at the drop, showing that Flume still knew how to make a banger? Perhaps it was Nagano's gorgeous singing, creating a genuinely emotional track on a record that sometimes delved into melodrama? Perhaps it was the gorgeous melodies in the build-up to the drop, with video game-esque synths and filtering? Perhaps it was what **eklxtreme** calls a: "slow buildup, but it's so worth the orgasmic synths. very nostalgic warm vibbe."? Maybe it was all of the above. It's a fucking masterpiece of an electronic song, and earned its top 15 deservedly.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** is delighted: "Hot fucking damn, this is what woke me the fuck up this album. Little Dragon lays the foundation for a fucking massive drop, and Flume does not disappoint. I own this record, and I blasted it once and it was fucking life changing. God, I love this song." **SkyBlade79** is familiar-ish? He liked it: "I swear I’ve heard this drop on some random youtube gaming/comedy video before. Regardless, the drop is amazing."

I was first introduced to Little Dragon's work from a commercial. I found it a bit disconcerting, but I eventually grew to love Nagano's crooning. The song I heard in the commercial was ["Klapp Klapp"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM--TtkGNa4), a fantastic electropop song. Nagano has collaborations with several electronic artists, including a couple with Gorillaz.

**PossumAloysuis**: "I love everything about this song. The buildup to the drop is a spiritual experience. Yukimi, just like with KAYTRA, sounds angelic"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "my favorite Little Dragon songs are kinda chill so this is another good production/guest combo tbh"

**awryj**: "It's great, but the beat sounds suspiciously similar to the one in Say It."

**therokinrolla**: "ahhh this is so good. There is no rapper, there is some kind of bells things, little dragon sounds great. Yas icon!"

**theultimatetrol**: "Similar to Helix, the buildup is a little too long, but damn if it isn't still great."

**VodkaInsipido**: "like EDM, but great"

The track to just be one too many spots from the top 10 is, coincidentally, titled "One Too Many"! A groovy hip house track, the song features Phonte switching between soul vocalizations to very cool, funky rapping. It's a track that works just well enough with KAYTRANADA's aesthetic, with not too many embellishments to it. Phonte provides pretty much everything, from the Cupid shuffle-referencing intro to the transition into an amazing outro of rapping. KAYTRANADA knows when to add production elements, and this track is mostly a backbone of G-funk synths and pads. It's pop rap at it's best.

**jvickery13** is not impressed with the rapping: "nice pop song, lyrics are trash again tho. have sum more respect 4 women pls phonte". What a shame! **mokitsu** isn't too keen either, and I can see this: "hmm not sure about this, sounds like other tracks without being distinctive". While Phonte's performance is great, their aren't too many elements to the song that make it immediately a stand-out; it's mostly pleasant music.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** describes Phonte better than I can: "Phonte is not a no name, if you are all wondering. He was part of Little Brother, a dope rap group from NC, and you should put some respect on his name. On One Too Many, he raps over a smooth Kaytranada beat. What makes this track great is how solid the final verse is, a breath of fresh air among the dope hook."

"Help Me Lose My Mind" is the final outro to go out, and it's a fine one, at that. After 13 tracks of relative similarity with the exception of "Second Chance", the album ends on easily the biggest change from the aesthetic. Because of this, the song benefits: it's an amazing exercise in deep house, and the vocals are the dreamy indie pop type that complement it well. It's bassy and well-written pop, and it provides excellent closure to the longest album in the rate. The brothers even discussed this in an interview, saying they were considering changing the song to fit the aesthetic.

The video for the song was actually pulled for glorifying drug use! Unfortunately, that makes it a bit harder to find on YouTube.

**SkyBlade79** I can't: "for some reason I thought this would be London from Sweet Life…"

**dirdbub**: "You will either die or lose your mind if you reach the end of this sentence, so stop reading it — in the early 1930s, a research group of psychologists, semioticists and English professors in Austria were researching the fundamentals of understanding language; it was believed, rather than language simply being an arbitrary (albeit varyingly complex) system of mnemonics for our conceptualization of reality, that perhaps once learned and internalized, our use of language actually became embedded within the root thought processes involved in our filtration of external, ordered stimuli and thereby our very grasp of reality, and this team of researchers distilled what turned out to be a symbolic halt mechanism into a new kind of punctuation: not a period, or exclamation point, or question mark, but a cognitive “escape character” they referred to as the “ablation mark,” or fulcrum for short — though whether the word “fulcrum” betrays the visual appearance or actual textual annotation of this new punctuation really, REALLY should not be dwelled upon even though as a glyph it is fairly unremarkable (it operates differently when encountered as a component of grammar) — regardless you should have stopped reading this sentence long, long ago because at some point I’ve got to end it and it won’t be with a period, or an exclamation point, or a question mark, but with a fulcrum and only a fulcrum, because I’ve used all the colons, semicolons, parentheses and em-dashes I possibly can, and yet you continue reading, making it very difficult for me to continue to make this sentence grammatically correct, which it MUST be for it is the only thing keeping ME from dying or losing MY mind, because I DID see the fulcrum and began writing this sentence in an attempt to maintain my already-faltering grasp on a world of ordered concepts and symbols tied to meaning, to stave off the deconstruction of my earliest memories of language, since it is this deconstruction upon viewing the ablation mark that is so sudden and so SEVERE that the victim’s sensory perception actually briefly HALTS, leaving the mind locked in total isolation that cannot be described as darkness or even absence of darkness, which in turn brings about a catastrophic sympathetic response of the central nervous system, a response that I have only managed to DELAY with a PURELY GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT SENTENCE which I CANNOT ALLOW TO END, and yet MUST END, because I CANNOT TYPE FOREVER A PURELY GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT SENTENCE WHEN I HAVE USED ALL AVAILABLE PUNCTUATION, INCLUDING COLONS, SEMICOLONS, PARENTHESES, EM-DASHES, HYPHENS, SAVE FOR THE DAMNED ABLATION MARK WHICH IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE YOU WOULD BREAK YOUR GAZE WITH THIS SINGLE SENTENCE IMMEDIATELY FOR THE FULCRUM IS REAL AND IT IS ABSENCE OF ABSENCE AND I CAN’T GO ON USING WORDS LIKE “FOR” AND “BUT” AND “AND” TO STRING MORE CLAUSES ONTO THIS STILL-BUT-NOT-FOR-LONG PURELY GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT SENTENCE, SO GOD HELP ME AND HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL, AND FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO, BUT I NEVER SHOULD HAVE OPENED THAT DRAWER IN HIS OFFICE AND IF I HAD NEVER READ THE PAPER I’D HAVE NEVER SEEN THE FULCRUM BUT GOD HELP ME I DID ☼"

Honestly, despite this being a single, am I the only one surprised it made it this far? No disrespect, by the way, it's a fantastic tune! However, the vocals are obviously a bit monotone. This is one of two tracks that features Howard Lawrence's vocals, but this is the only one with them at the forefront. While his vocals are flat, it falls in the same vein of "When a Fire Starts to Burn for Me": flat vocals providing rhythm to a repetitive beat. **MrSwearword** explains it best: "the vocals may lack emotive quality but its flatness work very well against the beat.". It's amazingly catchy, and the production is A1.

**Mattymooz_** has a perfectly fine opinion!: "Mary J Blige version is better". Blige really does add a lot of soul to the track, and it's stellar. **ThatParanoidPenguin** also has a great comment: "Another strong track in the beginning, F for You is repetitive, but in a great way. It’s the same type of entrancing song that keeps you in a blur and daze in the club. It sounds like it was made for that time in the night when alcohol kicks right in."

**dirdbub** needs help: "you fool. you absolute buffoon. You think you can challenge me in my own realm? you think you can rebel against my authority? you dare come into my house and upturn my dining chairs and spill coffee grounds in my Keurig? you thought you were safe in your chain mail armor behind that screen of yours. I will take these laminate wood floor boards and destroy you. I didn't want war. but I didn't start it"

Lawrence has sung on another song, the track in question being ["Jaded"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVSewbKllk), where his vocals are much more soulful and practiced.

**seferre2**: "fifa"

**TragicKingdom1**: ""Jaded" is the better version of this song tbh, but I still like this a lot."

**theultimatetrol**: "No wait this would have been my 11. Fuck why are all these tracks so good. I dunno if people can appreciate this when they have never produced music, but this is literal technical perfection"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "dis slaps"

**VodkaInsipido**: "I’VE BEEN INFECTED WITH RESTLESS WHISPERS AND CHEATS"

**eklxtreme**: "great nightlife vibes and great production"

**mashluke**: "This is one of my favourite songs of theirs.

Somehow surviving with no 11s, this track managed to survive into the top 10! With good reason, too. Right from the claps at the start, this is easily one of the most hype tracks. Aluna Francis's vocals are gorgeous here, even if I didn't realize that she was saying "together" for the longest time. The handclaps make this entire song, like **jvickery13** mentions, who found this track their favorite: "the handclaps are everything and aluna sounds like a sweet giggly angel with her adlibs. love it best track 4 me". GoldLink's performance isn't to be overlooked, however. His rapping over the song is so rhythmic, and he's experienced with electronic production. He rides the beat well, and even if you disliked the rapping you're likely to enjoy Aluna's vocal climax of "oooh-uh!" It's amazing.

**timothy444** isn't keen on the production, but finds the vocal performances excellent (as they are!): "AlunaGeorge's vocals and the God orgasmic rap is amazing but the beat is boring tbh." **seferre2** seems to like it, too, but not necessarily for the handclaps: "i dont think the production is necessariy good just the songwriting in general". In general, it's a great song that most people enjoyed.

GoldLink's best works for me are the emotional R&B bop ["Late Night"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6SDrZMPX0) featuring Masego, ["Spectrum"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHkdbd-pLqI), a hype hip house track sampling Missy Elliott, and ["Crew"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNqbe6QENY).

One of the best songs on the album, and one of the first I heard! "You & Me" is your typical Disclosure banger, but it has a strong, wonderful chorus. I honestly don't know what to say. "So, please don't let goooooooooooo" is irresistible. The beats are about the same, but it's all done so tactfully.

Eliza Doolittle's own solo effort, when I explored it, felt like your typical Lily Allen/Amy Winehouse-esque affair of jazzy tunes. It's cute stuff, like ["Pack Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTIqd9pNxnw). She's actually now known under the name ELIZA. Either that, or Spotify messed up.

---

**MrSwearword**: "vocals come up short against a sick beat"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is honestly an underrated track on the album, it got a ton of play when I first listened to this album, and one of the instances where their instrumentals really suits a featured artist."

**SkyBlade79**: "Her voice is really nice!"

**ExtraEater**: "disclosure have never sounded more UK garage than in this song, and i love it"

**PossumAloysuis**: "It's just you and me, and LUV in the TUB (HOT TUB OF LOVEEE)"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "home is where the wig is"

**10footnotes**: "Ending is a little weak, but damn the rest of the song is great – catchy, well-produced, and interesting. Eliza Doolittle's voice, especially in the verses, is so smooth and fits very nicely in the song."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "this one is very british"

**awhile2**: "yo who's that person on the sub who thinks Caracal is better than Settle and are they listening to the same thing im listening to?"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "hooray for vocals and lyrics but they're not that good. this album is wayyyy more repetitive than i remember."

**eklxtreme**: "her vocals are PERFECTION. I get a nice nostalgic vibe from this and the whole thing is beautifully written and produced."

#hot take: i don't like the Flume remix

**mashluke**: "The Flume remix is more famous but the original is also fire."

**Mattymooz_**: "tbh I prefer this to the flume remix"

**jvickery13**: "the flume remix is better but still u know good song boys xoxo"

**timothy444**: "Flume did it better"

**Wtucker4**: "Flume Remix >>"

**seferre2**: "i thought i had heard this before but i guess not. only the flume remix which is a 10/10 btw check it out"

**theultimatetrol**: "The Flume remix of this is GOAT, which is maybe why this seems underwhelming now. It's one of the weaker tracks anyway. Also apparently Eliza Doolittle is now called ALIZA? KAYTRANADA's influence, when will your fave"

**dirdbub**: "wow this is the third best version of this song right behind Flume’s and then right behind Baauer’s"

Another *99.9%* track bites the dust, this time with the lowest controversy score! Craig David is one of the classic British R&B singers of the 2000s, and his vocals on this feel completely updated. From the honestly gorgeous vocal sampling, to the bassline, to the crisp drums, to how David's vocals feel absolutely effortless, this song is a banger front to back. Craig David pulls off sing-rap better than anybody, and he pulls off an effortlessly cool R&B song. With easily one of the most catchy choruses in the rate and being the first banger with vocals on the album, it's no wonder it has the lowest controversy. Best part? Probably the outro, where the female backing vocalist comes to the helm.

**timothy444** is impressed: "Craig David basically saves this song." **ThatParanoidPenguin** loves the production aspects: "Wow, this is a ridiculously chill bop right here. I love this dude’s sing-rap going on, and the beat flows so well. And those drums. Those are some of the crispest drums I’ve heard in a long time." **SkyBlade79** enjoys the track: "Far better than the previous songs. This guy’s voice is quite nice and the outro is also pretty sweet."

Craig David's work is quite extensive, but I believe his best known was ["Rewind"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR02Zt90Vos)? His collaborations with UK garage producers Artful Dodger produced several quality tunes, including ["Something"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBYBOrz5Fl0).

Alas!

My 11, and now my favorite album in the rate, has died. :(

"You're the One" is the best bop in *99.9%*, and one of my favorite electronic songs ever. It's the song that introduced me to KAYTRANADA, and the one that got me into his music. Syd tha Kyd, of neo-soul group The Internet, provides excellently dreamy vocals to a danceable alt R&B track. Asides from subtle flourishes in the chorus, the electronics are reduced to only some 8-bit synths and a groovy drum machine rhythm. There's a hip-hop "wooh!" in the song that's wonderful. It's short, but sweet. The outro is gorgeous, with woozy synths and a shaker rhythm leading into the next banger.

Syd's first single for her 2017 debut *Fin* was ["All About Me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIOrsxsa0A), a dark R&B/rap track with trap production and ominous synths. Her work in the Internet produced several groovy neo-soul bops, with ["Girl" (feat. KAYTRANADA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmY8mG4_3j4), ["Dontcha"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28JAS1ZUUqw), and ["Special Affair"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESxDzsv3CkI). Check it out when you can, it's brilliant.

**letsallpoo** sums up my thoughts succinctly: "kaytranda".

**MrSwearword**: "Seriously one of the greatest songs in recorded music history."

**eklxtreme**: "her vocals bring the song up really nicely and compliment the vibe"

**jvickery13**: "this song turns me on"

**mokitsu**: "so catchy and fun. syd and kaytranada do magic together."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "/r/popheads needs to fucking stop snoozing on Syd. Fin was a dope debut album that mixed R&B and hip hop really well and I adore it. Her feature on this song is pure haze. It’s muffled in the best way, and one of the slow burns on the album."

**SkyBlade79**: "Great voice! Pretty nice production too."

**PossumAloysuis**: "Groovy as fuck. Syd sounds heavenly."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this was soooo close to getting my 11. everything about it is so perfect, and the groove is like unbelievably sensual but in a sweet way? idk it's like infatuation perfectly translated into a house bop."

**awryj**: "Gets a 10 mostly for having introduced me to Kaytranada a while ago - and it's still [FRESH]"

**10footnotes**: "Her voice is beautiful, and the dreamy filter over it fits perfectly with the synths used in this song and throughout the album."

**robbiec_**: "first introduction to Syd"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Pretty subdued, but Syd's vocals complement Kay's production nicely."

**theultimatetrol**: "Syd is extremely underrated. Also this song is again very good"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Another bop. I like Syd in some tracks, but when she mixes something more danceable with her voice songs like this appear. The instrumental is gorgeous, the drums are nice and her vocals are on point, what else could we ask for in a bop?"

KAYTRANADA's exit was a bit sad for me, seeing "You're the One", "Together", and "Got It Good" drop ever so slightly until only one song made the top 10. However, the album as a whole managed to rank highly. So, while *99.9%* may have lacked the single stand-out single to attract /r/popheads, it managed to be consistent enough for most to adore, eventually landing the top average in a close call.

I'll still continue to stan his work, but I'm glad he put up a fight for most of the rate, with "You're the One" being #1 several times, and being in the top 3 consistently.

Does anything need to be said about this track that hasn't been explained by its rabid fan, 
**SkyBlade79*?: "Of course, this is my favorite song. As the resident Tove Lo megastan, it’s inevitable. I just love everything about this song. From the strong deliverance of the lyrics, to the vulgar lyrics, to that delicious “oh uh ohhhhh” in the drop. Even the humming is great. This production is also so delicious to listen to. There's really nothing that I can find bad about this song."

It's an excellent pop track, featuring Tove Lo's excellent future-pop girl vocals over distorted synths and Flume's classic drops. Flume shows his pop side well, highlighting Tove Lo's humming well. Her vocals are powerful on this, and while I was considering giving this my 0 for the hilarity, I really can't. It's good. The chorus has gorgeous walls of synths and an amazing clattering drum beat after every line. It's amazing.

Resident Flume anti-stan, **MrSwearword**, even enjoys it a lot, giving his only 10: "at least Tove Lo sounds good on the song". **timothy444** will unfortunately be very disappointed by this result, saying: "I will be so disappointed in everyone if this doesn't get #1 from everyone :angery:"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** loves it ("Oh my god, this is one of the best things Tove Lo has ever done. The buildup is so palpable, and the drop is so cathartic. The chorus is infinitely singable, and Flume builds and releases so much tension here. What a fantastic song. Easily my favorite song with a feature on the album."), **PossumAloysuis** loves it ("Probably the catchiest song here. The drop on the hook is great."), **therokinrolla** loves it: "oh my god Tove Lo just kills her role in this song. Literally iconic". So, how did it get so low? After all, this was once #1.

**cloudbustingmp3** isn't a fan of the hook: "whyyyy is the chorus so drawn out on this with like 0 payoff. tove slow does not work for me; i always need her more upbeat tbh". **theultimatetrol** is fine with the song but is mostly disappointed: "It's an okay pop song, but underwhelming for Flume. Please don't hate me for this popheads". Several late low scores eventually dropped this to #4!

**mashluke** has a really cute story: "The day the news of their collab came out I was fucking excited. I have always been a huge fan of Tove Lo and in that period I was getting into Flume's music and I was loving anything he was doing. Can you imagine my reaction when I had discovered 2 of my favourite artists had a song together? I downloaded it illegally on my phone 3 days before its official release because I couldn't contain the excitement. I fucking love both of them and this song."

You know, I did this rate so several unrecognized, unpopular, unknown artists could get exposure to /r/popheads. Tove Lo is the definition of that.

Only kidding!

Tove Lo's one of the few artists in this rate to actually chart solo. The remix to her song "Habits (Stay High)" was a hit, and "Talking Body" lifted her popularity well! She's a well-known pop singer with alternative tendencies who I need to explore more.

**mokitsu**: "a bop, made me like tove lo. that pre-chorus!!! so glorious"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "QUEEN AND THIS IS SO GOOD THIS DESERVED BETTER, THIS BETTER WIN"

**skiddos**: "The only song I regularly listen to and thoroughly enjoy on this album tbh. It just goes OFF."

**dirdbub**: "I love how this song was absolutely set up by both Flume and Tove Lo for the perfect sexy video that would prolly include couples of all races, sexuality, ages, etc. and preach sexual positivity in life and they jsut fucking decided. "you know fucken what? spaceman trying to walk on the side of som efucken building""

**robbiec_**: "sex"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I feel like on this song more than any other one Flume's throbbing, heavy production style really works with the pop melody and vocals."

Did you really think this would land #1?

Well, **therokinrolla** did, who I enjoyed torturing over the past couple of days: "let me tell you why this song is gross. Aside from the fact i am biased bc sam smith stole gaga’s grammy, sam smith is a boring lame-o prude of an artist that somehow managed to make an EDM TRACK a snoozefest."

"Latch" is a perfect pop song, and you can tell from every aspect of production and track placement that it was meant to be *the* single that put Sam Smith and Disclosure on the map. Did it work?

Uh, haven't you heard "Stay With Me" enough?

Everything on this song, from the gorgeous rising synth tones in the build-up, to Sam Smith practically yelling the chorus is such high-class pop music. It's what they play in Express, basically. **PossumAloysuis** gives their 11 with a nice paragraph: "I still remember where I was when I heard this for the first time and I remember thinking holy shit what the fuck is this. Back then I knew there was something special about it and all these years later the feeling is still there. This is without a doubt, one of the best songs that radio picked up in recent years. It's absolutely flawless."

And uh, **Mattymooz_**, that opinion is just HOT: "The acoustic version gets a 10".

---

**MrSwearword**: "Eww, Sam Smith; gross"

**jvickery13**: "i hate sam smith."

**timothy444**: "Instant BOP! So sad how this wasn't as popular in Australia :("

**mokitsu**: "legendary song, sam carries this as much as disclosure imo, every part is perfect"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "We all know this one. I’m kinda surprised it smashed this much in the US, but I’ll definitely take it. This is easily the best thing Sam Smith has ever done, a tremendous dance anthem that honestly stole an entire summer. His vocals are fantastic here, as are the lyrics. The main complaint of Sam Smith songs is how boring and same-y they are, so having Disclosure handle production really helped things."

**skiddos**: "one of sam's best songs"

**SkyBlade79**: "This beat is SO good even though the “never” annoyed me at the start, I love it now. Just so bubbly and awesome. Sam Smith’s best work, imo."

**dirdbub**: "Sam Smith probably: “I am an artist. I appreciate all forms of art, whether it’s visual art, performing art, written art, interactive art, or even the art of playing video games and preparing food. You could call me a mediaphile, I guess. A jack of all trades and a master of few. My main endeavor is to create grandiose independent video game epics someday. I make short films and other miscellaneous videos on YouTube. My favorite movie is A Clockwork Orange. Honorable mentions include Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, As Good as it Gets, Silence of the Lambs, Star Wars, and many more. I create short films about abstract and often ridiculous situations. I also create video game related content and just random ideas that pop in my head. I watch YouTube gaming related content, BrainScratchComms, Vinesauce, Retsupurae, and ChipCheezum are among my favorite. For my more gaming oriented channel, check out ‘OTHER CHANNEL’ in the banner above.”"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i need mutha smith to nut in me record a whole house/garage album! his voice floats along the groove of this sooooo nicely, and literally every little element is so right."

**awryj**: "Legendary. I think that it's the 6/8 time signature that is what makes this and Run Away With Me so great. Imagine Latch and RAWM with a simple four-to-the-floor beat - it wouldn't sound nearly as interesting."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "his voice is annoying"

**seferre2**: "this is a disclosure staple and this is the song that made the album what it is. i'm trying to be strict with my scores but this is 10-worthy. more sam collabs please."



**robbiec_**: "iconic career launcher"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I'm probably the only fan of In The Lonely Hour on this sub but even I think the EDM Sam is the best Sam."

**theultimatetrol**: "The only good Sam Smith song. I mean really he should stick to electronic songs, at least these do not make him sound boring. Would've gotten my 11 if not for Got It GOAT"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Feel like the chorus needs to be more powerful but otherwise issa bop."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "I know popheads has some sort of problem with Sam Smith but this is a certified banger."

**booooam**: "I really wanted to hate this because of Sam Smith but this song is honestly very good."

**VodkaInsipido**: "highkey a bop"

**Wtucker4**: "Best song Sam Smith's ever done"

**eklxtreme**: "sam's vocal performance is absolutely perfect here. This is crafted into a perfect pop song."

**mashluke**: "I think this is their most famous song and it probably made me discover their discography, thank you Latch. I love everything about you."

Did anybody EXPECT this to be #1, asides from some hopefull wishers? Nevertheless, it easily deserves its place. Opening with a classic drum beat then going into the distorted synth melody, it's essentially one of the perfect songs in the rate. AlunaGeorge provides sensual vocals to the track, creating a track that embodies sex. The chorus is wonderfully catchy, and the pre-hook of "you wanna play rough" is so addicting to listen to. It's a brilliantly produced song, and managed to grab #1 in the second half of the month somewhat consistently.

**jvickery13** fucking loves it, and compares it to the other 2 AG collabs: "BANGER. best alunageorge collab out of all like 14000 in this rate, also the brit perfomance with her and lorde SLAYS my existence." **cloudbustingmp3** gives their 11 with pride: "the buildup at the beginning is so perfect, and the bouncy vibe of everything makes it impossible to not dance around to it. i'm still shook that they opened with this on the Caracal Tour bc i truly wasn't ready to hear my favorite song of theirs first. honestly probably my favorite dance song of the decade".

Among the few who had something negative to say are **MrSwearword**, who likes the beat but not her singing: "funky beat, but the vocals don’t measure up", **theultimatetrol**: "The worst AG collab imo. Doesn't mean it's bad tho", **therokinrolla**: "i cannot stand this highpitched voices edm producers love to shoehorn into their songs. Issa shame bc this production is 50 shades of :lit:", and **thenshecamelikeaaah**: "oh yay more AlunaGeorge :| instrumental is nice tho".

Everybody else pretty much loved it, and it was well-liked enough and not controversial enough to make #1.

**Mattymooz_**: "Introduced me to Alunabae"

**timothy444**: "AlunaGeorge vocals amplifies the bop factor on this song! Amazing!"

**mokitsu**: "omg at this 1-2-3 punch, excellent song and one of my fav AG tracks"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is probably the best AlunaGeorge collab on the entire rate. Like damn, she’s serving some fantastic vocals here, especially on the chorus."

**skiddos**: "huge bop"

**SkyBlade79**: "This is the best Alunageorge song on all three albums. It’s just so funky and her voice works so well!"

**dirdbub**: "Static. White Noise. They say it’s good for you. Your brain can tune out all the distracting noises of the world and instead just focus on the one important thing of the moment. I always enjoyed static, the mindless noise that suffocates all others. Mo [REDACTED] ed the girl tipped her head to the side and waved at me. I must have stared at her. I waved back and she, shyly, ran after her mother. The voices followed her. “A fire,” said one of the voices. “I like to hear her scream.” “A good idea,” said another. “We just need to make sure that her mother will see -” The rest I didn’t hear. At the beginning, when I still thought they were just in my head, the voices that follow me were gentle most of the time. But they get more angry whenever I talk about them, whenever I mention them. I can hear them scream, right now. I can hear them argue that it can’t be that I know. I know that they want to break my chair to punish me. Still, I can only hear. I can’t see them. I can’t touch them. And whatever they want to do - I can’t stop them."

**PossumAloysuis**: "This sounds like white noise for sure, and i mean that in the best way possible. Spectacular"

**seferre2**: "idk what to comment on this but ITS GOOD"

**robbiec_**: "Aluna is a highlight of all of these fantastic albums"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The best AlunaGeorge collab in this but I can't unhear "just gonna get my butt.""

**awhile2**: "Alunas the queen of EDM collabs and no one can tell me otherwise"

**elvis-gold**: "The best of the 3 AlunaGeorge collaborations on these albums"

**booooam**: "this is not white noise this is literally a wall of sound"

**VodkaInsipido**: "this is amazing"

**letsallpoo**: "original is better but this is still great"

**eklxtreme**: "a lit club anthem. the keys are fucking infectious and this is produced wonderfully."

**mashluke**: "THIS. IS. MY. FAVOURITE. DISCLOSURE'S. SONG. It's just flawless, I would dance my entire body off to this song. God, why do they play reggaeton and not Disclosure in all the clubs I know? I would happily spend 20€ to go but noooo, you have to play Enrique Iglesias like he's the only singer ever existed. Subeme la Radio a fuck."

"Never Be Like You" attracted the most 11s in the rate, and for good reason. It's the hit single from *Skin*, and you can tell. From the gorgeous intro, to the obvious bridge, to the conventional pop structure, and to the toned down glitch elements, it's the most well-crafted pop song by Flume. kai offers a beautiful vocal section to this, and the emotions in this clearly resonated with many, including **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Just looking at the lyrics, I relate to this song so hard like you have no idea."

In one of his few truly messy/controversial moments, **MrSwearword** makes his 0 count: "this knockoff “My Love” by Justin Timberlake sounding song…BOO. NEXT". An odd comparison, but hey, I can see it. **cloudbustingmp3** doesn't like it much, either: "smh why is the first song w vocals THE best song on the album? it's a bop but like the rest of the album just never rises back up to anywhere near this level of greatness again" **jvickery13** seems mad: "trash song trash lyrics. middle eight is nice tho".

There were so many GLOWING comments though, and with good reason. The song's emotions really cut deep into many.

**10footnotes**: "This song is just so beautiful. Kai's voice is gorgeous and has enough personality to carry the verses and bridge, which are fairly understated, and her "never be like you" falsettos are iconic. Then the chorus hits and the mood of the song changes dramatically. This song perfectly shifts between these intense choruses and smooth verses without giving listeners whiplash. The lyrics are good too: they fit the tone of the song well and are more than just a couple throwaway lines, which, considering that this is an electronic album, shouldn't be ignored."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Honestly, this is the one. I knew either this or Say It was gonna be Flume’s smash single, and I’m a little shocked it was this one, but upon revisiting, I’m not shocked at all. This song is the perfect marriage of Flume’s dynamic whips and cracks and Kai’s tremendous vocals. The chorus hits all the right points, and the drums just feel perfect. I wish it charted higher."

**SkyBlade79**: "This son is honestly just super epic. It’s poppy but not too much, and it’s awesome how the synths just saw in and out. The lyrics are pretty awesome too, and it’s one of the few songs that actually sounds better censored." I agree! The vulgarity seems a bit shoehorned in, and it put me off on ADORING it, but it's still good, lmao.

---

**mokitsu**: "a cute bop. probs the track with most replay value in this album"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this shit is good."

**dirdbub**: "I think it took me about six weeks to realize the lyrics were "he'll never be like you" and not "I'll never be like you" and that kinda fucked me up for a bit"

**PossumAloysuis**: "Thank god this did well on radio. Restored my faith in it."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "I'm in love with this"

**seferre2**: "fantastic production and i'm glad flume got a decent hit from this song"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The thodding production captures the haze of emotions that are expressed in the lyrics. I do have to take some points off though because the melody is fairly awkward."

**theultimatetrol**: "This is when we knew Flume also made GOAT pop"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "this was my favorite song for a while and i love it everytime i listen to it. very nice."

**VodkaInsipido**: "OK I’M LIKE FUCKING SCREAMING OUT-FUCKING-LOUD? BECAUSE I HAVE LOVED THIS SONG FOR A YEAR BUT I NEVER FOUND OUT WHO IT WAS BY? AND IT’S A BOP FRONT TO BACK, THIS IS AMAZING THANK YOU KAPPY FOR MAKING ME DISCOVER WHAT THIS SHIT IS"

**eklxtreme**: "very mellow and summery but also disguised as a sad song. the synths are just great."

**mashluke**: "Perfect. What else can you say about this song?"

#my sister told me about her!

**Wtucker4**: "R.obbed Tash Sultana of Hot 100 no.1"

# #2. Settle

---

**Overall average**: 7.406 **// Total points:** 340.7 

---

A dance record that's SLIGHTLY repetitive, but as individual songs all are perfectly crafted. The Disclosure brothers were highly influential to electronic albums, and it's a shame their second release didn't reach such a level of ubiquity.

---

**jvickery13**: not to be bias but this is the best dance album of all time

**skiddos**: The production on these songs is indistinctive between the songs, but the style is very enjoyable. Disclosure really set a precedent in electronic music. Kings!

**SkyBlade79**: average 5.107

**dirdbub**: for almost every comment on this album, I looked up the title and the word “copypasta” onto Google and copy/pasted the first result

**ExtraEater**: their best album since original pirate material

**robbiec_**: a classic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: I honestly didn't think I would be into Disclosure that much so I listened to this album last for this rate and honestly and I was shook and this is a good album! I really enjoyed it a lot.

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: (Average: 6.46)

**elvis-gold**: You can't help but dance listening to this! A really energetic fusion of pop and house.

**mashluke**: If this album was a person I would make out with them, no matter the gender.

An amazing, stellar experience of an album slightly marred but not entirely by a confused second, Flume clearly knows what he wants to do to achieve success and steps outside of his bounds excellently.

---

**jvickery13**: i low kii hate this album, it's just not fun to listen to

**skiddos**: The cover art is really pretty, I'll give it that.

**SkyBlade79**: Average 7.0625

**dirdbub**: hhgye guys it's your friendly neighbourhood Australian with you**r fucccckennnnnn uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh** \*gets handed note from label\* ..16 track album with a below average back half and two companion EPs that should have been the back half of the album?

**seferre2**: i've listened to skin in my car a few times and i've fallen asleep every time. i have mad respect for flume and his unique sound though

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: This is probably the most interesting album out of this rate because I really like the production style here. I have a bad feeling not everyone is into this style though so I hope Flume is not slaughtered in the rate but we'll see.
