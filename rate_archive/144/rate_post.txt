Rateggaeton (Bad Bunny / Karol G / J Balvin)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/t560sa/rateggaeton_bad_bunny_karol_g_j_balvin/

After our All Stars latest results, the fight against popheads’ xenophobia is stronger than ever! And my plan to make more rates in spanish happen is in full effect, welcome to rateggaeton!

Reggaeton is a genre that has been important to latin culture for decades now, and it just kept on growing and expanding over to the U.S. and the whole world, with hits from many different artist through these past years, with songs breaking streaming records, charting and the genre only becoming more popular with time. In this rate we’re focusing on 3 artists (cause the bonus rate was actively killed, but with enough participation, we could dive deeper into the genre so get to work besties) that have represented the sound in the last few years: Bad Bunny, Karol G and J Balvin

For the regular rater besties, who want to get into it and enjoy the music, here are the important links, however, we encourage you to read the writeups on these albums, especially if you’re unfamiliar with them.

# Bad Bunny - YHLQMDLG

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5lJqux7orBlA1QzyiBGti1?si=Ea1lNs42TTi88B683w5M_w) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/yhlqmdlg/1500776322) │ [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiBVpY8hua4oDZ7EdHm78TuU3YBIih9u8)

&nbsp;

>An ounce of krippy, with that I calm myself

>Every chorus I make turns into a psalm

>They come at me but I don't get alarmed

>A Cuban on my neck, the other on all fours

\- *Hablamos Mañana*

&nbsp;

Bad Bunny has been writing music for quite a lot of time, and started posting his early stuff since around 2013 on Soundcloud before he got signed. His first hits, “Soy Peor” and “Krippy Kush” cemented him as someone to look for in the latin music sphere and as a trap artist first, which led to a bunch of collabs with artists we will be hearing from soon, and other big names in reggaeton, which led to his recognition going further from collabs like “Mayores” with Becky G, “Te Boté (remix)” with Ozuna and Nicky Jam. After this he released his debut album, X100PRE, which was acclaimed critically and after his collab album with J Balvin, “OASIS”, everyone was curious what was next for Bad Bunny.

&nbsp;

YHLQMDLG (acronym for “Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana”, “I Do Whatever I Want” in English) was one of the most expected albums of 2020, especially after the hit singles anticipating it: “Vete” and “Ignorantes”; when the album finally came, it came at a weird time for a lot of us, late February of 2020, which either meant countries were on lockdown or soon to be on lockdown cause of the pandemic, however this album delivered on everything it promised and more, it’s Bad Bunny’s peak in my opinion, and just delivers on the title’s promise of him doing whatever he wants, not only sonically, which can be seen in some production choices and the wide range of influences from 90s and 00s reggaeton, like “Safaera” being basically a passage through the history of reggaeton, to even latin rock in “Hablamos Mañana”, but the title also refers to Bad Bunny being outspoken about different things in tracks like “Yo Perreo Sola” and the music video, which tackles misogyny on the reggaeton scene and publicly speaking out political issues in Puerto Rico.

&nbsp;

YHLQMDLG has a lot of personal lyrics, a lot of nostalgia that Bad Bunny has for the music he grew up with, as he mentioned this album being somewhat a way to capture garage parties he used to attend growing up, and on top of that, it has a bunch of collaborators from Daddy Yankee to Yaviah and many more, that elevated this album to a whole new level for Bad Bunny, and reggaeton in general, it truly felt like a cultural reset for reggaeton, making way for songs being new classics of parties all through Latin America and the world.

# Karol G - KG0516

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5CS8E6JVACItYto4OOJoPW?si=FuQqCZUjTkaY5BoFURtTkQ) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/kg0516-apple-music-edition/1560071303) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpTxN0bsTsj6OP2O5EOKMOh5GxGO58qeK)

>I go out well-dressed from head to toe

>Because you could maybe run into my ass

>I feel like a BICHOTA without leaving the block

>Everybody wants to part me but they don’t have what it takes

\- *BICHOTA*

&nbsp;

Karol G has been in the music scene for a very long time, her beginning happened in 2006 after her participation in Colombia’s X-Factor, which allowed her to be signed since then, she released music since then and got to perform opening for acts like Don Omar and J Balvin himself, but it wasn’t until a few collabs with artists like Bad Bunny in around 2017 that allowed her to release her debut album “Unstoppable”, which got her recognition as one of the first women to have a trap/reggaeton project have the recognition it got with awards and such, since this she’s been everywhere becoming an even bigger name year after year…
  
&nbsp;

KG0516 was released last year, in 2021 after being anticipated since the release of probably her biggest crossover hit, “Tusa”, which features Nicki Minaj, and Karol cites to be a song that changed her life, it gave her the crossover hit and made her an even bigger name, now worldwide. KG0516 is a play on both, the date she signed her first deal after her X-Factor participation, and its meant to look like a plane ticket, as she cites the album to be a journey for her fans through her musical inspirations that range from early reggaeton, as can be seen very clearly in “LEYENDAS”, trap and even corridos or ranchera influences that can be seen in “200 COPAS”. As well as YHLQMDLG, KG0516 has a wide arrange of features with songs like “EL MAKINON” and “GATO MALO” showcasing female collaborations with relatively new/up-coming artists, with names like Ozuna, Nicky Jam among other reggaeton artists, artists like Ludacris & Nicki Minaj and of course, “LEYENDAS” paying homage to reggeaton classics through the likes of Zion, among others but specifically Ivy Queen, an artist that Karol highlights as a big inspiration, being one of the very few women making reggaeton and being just as successful as the men in the scene. Another highlight of her album is her hit, “BICHOTA”, a single from the album that became a hit in Latin America, starting the use of BICHOTA as a word to refer to confident and empowered women, tracing back to the song and her being called “La verdadera bichota”.

# J Balvin - Vibras

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5kprdYds6oZb4iSldfflOT?si=pFhi20R2QqGOjJk_wgOfhA) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/vibras/1368816332) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVajZkaSh1eU3dBI4P0RNLc-g3Vb7P3T)

&nbsp;

>All of my people are moving

>Look at the rhythm they have

>I make music that entertains

>My music has them dancing strong and they dance like that

\- *Mi Gente*

&nbsp;

As a Colombian, I don’t remember a lot of the time where J Balvin wasn’t everywhere, from his songs everywhere on the radio, parties, even ads, he’s huge here and at one point in the past decade this success spread through him performing in different festivals, award shows in different parts of the world, there is a lot to say about him, with many projects and collaborations on him, it’s clear that he’s one of the biggest names in reggaeton and has been for quite a few years.

&nbsp;

In spite of being in the industry for quite a long time and releasing several projects, Vibras is Balvin’s third studio album, released in 2018, which would cement him as a reggaeton artist in different ways, being an album that didn’t have the usual critics reggaeton albums have, which is not necessarily a well received genre in latin music for some reason (*cough* classism and racism). Vibras, has a double meaning, for “Vibrations” and “Vibes”; the success of the album comes from Balvin wanting to branch out a little bit in sound, seeing the success of his crossover hit “Mi Gente”, he workshopped the album to use different influences of R&B, dancehall and reggaeton, of course, in his search to make music that would be universal, his main purpose with this was making an album that people could connect to through sound first and foremost, and ignore the language barrier in a sense. Contrary to the other two albums, Vibras does not have that many collabs, but it has a few that bring out freshness into the album, from names we’ve seen in the previous album like Zion, Wisin & Yandel and artists that personally surprised me at the time like Carla Morrison and ROSALÍA.

- **We'd encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:
>Bichiyal: 8 wow I am almost single too I relate to this.

    Any other format such as:
    >Brillo: Shining without highlighter? I don’t think that’s the serve you think miss Rosalía (7)

    >Tusa: 9: Nicki just ended all the HAP girls in a single verse!!!

    will get your ballot rejected.

- If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving colon then a space after the album title:
>Album: YHLQMDLG: I just think it’s the yassest album to ever slay!
