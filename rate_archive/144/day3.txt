my god as soon as this opened with Ivy Queen I knew this would be a HUGE SMASH and I was right this was day 3 for so long I was shaking besties

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): A party in my ears!

**shipperondeck** (11): when it starts with an organ you know it's gonna be good- HOLY SHIT IS THAT SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS

**akanewasright** (10): I love me a big, blunt, goofy sample, and this song has like 3 of them. Reggaeton “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” is God tier

**celladonn** (10): hold on... this rules

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly i dont even care if this doesn’t sound that great at times, the concept and execution of the parts that work make this a 11 contender

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Ivy Queen thee queen. Another megamix smash!!!

**jay?** (10): like gag omfg

**nicolas :D** (10): pussy tight pussy clean pussy fresh

**nt96** (10): Homegirl literally got the entire reggaeton crew with her! Queen!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this goes so hard, I thought about giving it my 11

**Stryxen** (10): pussy tight pussy clean pussy fresh pussy pretty pussy fat full a flesh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): great closer and great overall vibe. i do love a long song that has four different songs inside. also the section around 4.40 sounds like "sweet dreams are made of these"

**welcome2thejam** (10): Said that I felt the last track Tusa was stuck in second gear; well, makes sense they were saving that big shift for the final track, cause this is a helluva way to end the album

**seanderlust** (9.5): THIS INTERPOLATION I AM LOSING MY GD MIND!!!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): the way this just switches up half way through and then those interpolations omg it's incredible

**afs** (8.5): I shall be using 'I declare I want to spank you' more often; also I picked up on that everybody sample

**MrMoodle** (8.5): this album is actually pretty cool at the maybe three points where it allows itself to sprinkle on a fraction of personality. also why is almost every single good guest feature on this entire album concentrated in this one song couldn’t you have spread them out a little more karol

**runaway3212** (8): slay closer

**ignitethephoenix** (7.6): could this not have been two songs?

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): i feel cheated when this comes up and it's not yo quiero bailar 😭

**RandomHypnotica** (7): this track feels like an underwhelming series of plot twists

**skargardin** (7): the switches were pretty intersting

**cremeebrulee** (6): this wants to be safaera so bad

**ricki** (6): i appreciate the concept

**DaHumanTorch** (5): she thought she gave safaera but she gave domesticación

**IIIHenryIII** (3): I hate Nicky Jam, and this is a mess, except for Wisin & Yandel's verse

**kielaurie** (3): feels much too flat for a track that should be as energetic as this

**frogaranaman** (1): they ate! but left a shitton of crumbs wtf were they thinking

cute as a closer but somehow the other 2 albums have way better closers

---

**runaway3212** (10): me @ my mom

**Stryxen** (10): having to put a \ infront of this title whenever i talk about it on discord to stop it emojifying is my villain origin backstory

**throwaway-7650** (10): ❤️

**MrMoodle** (9.9): the little gap in the transition between hablamos mañana and this is SO frustrating, it would’ve been an absolutely perfect way to close this album but there’s just this tiny little fucking thing. idk if you guys are as nerdy as me but you know how in the breath of the wild theme song there’s this random pause in the middle that completely throws the momentum out of whack for a second in what’s otherwise an absolutely gorgeous song? this is the reggaeton equivalent of that

**akanewasright** (9): yo hago is actually a really chaotic album, and it’s pretty hard to actually find a way to wrap that up, but this really does put a beautiful bow on it

**jay?** (9): served.

**nicolas :D** (9): i moved you moved we all moved

**Roxieloxie** (9): this is such a nice way to end the album, it has end credits energy but in a really sweet way

**CrimsonROSET** (8): awwww i love you too

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): help i forgot Bad Bunny said in this song he was gonna retire. Glad that’s a lie!! Hope it’s the same for Daddy Yankee!!!

**kielaurie** (8): the transition into this is beautiful, but there's just not enough to this track to rate it higher

**welcome2thejam** (8): Appreciate that I can immediately tell what this song is about off context clues

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): Honestly really surprised at how well the transition from the last song to this worked given how it went from bombastic to soft but it worked, and this is a definitely highlight on the album

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.5): this song isn't for me bcs the first time i heard a bad bunny track i became a hater 😊 in my defense krippy kush is a terrible song and now im a believer

**TiltControls** (7.5): ❤

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): cute moment

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): cute. anyways

**afs** (7): finally my English translated lyrics come of use, shout out to genius

**frogaranaman** (7): bitch scared the shit outta us for a sec

**IIIHenryIII** (7): great ending, so chill and vibey

**shipperondeck** (7): very sweet lyrics but was he serious about the album thing? (i know very little about this guy. although i like him now)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): something something balladphobia

**babadork** (6.4): This title really messed with my rating system.

**fadedblue09** (6): Really cheesy but it does feel like end credits music

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Proud of him for making it this far but like a lot of “fan songs” this is just kinda middling. The harp and the outro are nice though!

this is a hit for a reason Nicki an honorary latina now she didn’t do all this verse for nara

---

**1998tweety** (11): Nicki ATE, me giving this my 11 should come as no surprise.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): nicki realmente es una chica mala ahora smh. iconic song tho

**akanewasright** (10): fuck Nicki, but like….. this is the best song ever made

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I can’t get over how Nicki starts with a spanish couplet and then just goes “eh fuck it, idk this language” and raps in english

**nicolas :D** (10): a modern classic no its true

**runaway3212** (10): im so mad at this song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this SLAPS i can see why it was her first crossover hit. love the vibes, the vocals, the melody and nicki DELIVERED

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): pero ✋🏻 hice 🔨 toro🐃 ese 👉🏻 llanto 😭 por ❌ nara 🕳️

**jay?** (9): youre an epic fail

**skargardin** (9): unfortunately this is a massive bop

**afs** (8.5): You gotta Jack ANTON Off

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This is a rare song where I don’t think Nicki necessarily improves it, and I’m not even saying that because of her recent actions. I think her part is nice, but Karol has such a lovely voice that when Nicki comes in singing it’s a bit jarring for me. I do think her part is nice, and her rap is great as always, but I’m used to Nicki being by far the best part of any song she’s on, and she just isn’t that here for me. Love the orchestral instrumental.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): goddamn you Nicki

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Did nicki just say epic fail? In the year of our Lord 2019???

**seanderlust** (8): (hears nicki say "epic fail" in her verse and googles what year this came out)

**shipperondeck** (8): also expected this to sound different (yes i've never heard this before lol)

**throwaway-7650** (8): the strings remind me of Starships (Pachelbel - Canon In D Version)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): okay wait so I recognized this song from [the Laura León cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJ-ADYlz0U) that they used on La Mas Draga and her version kinda eats this one up

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): For a Nicki featured song, this is kind of boring. Maybe it’s cause the production is stripped back a lot but it doesn’t give me much

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i love high controversy scores

**indie\_fan\_** (7): ugh No me gusta cuanto Nicki canta la mayoría del tiempo

**kielaurie** (7): the best thing Ovy had touched on this project, but the feature verse doesn't hit for me at all

**welcome2thejam** (7): Very good, but felt like it could've went up another gear, especially with the orchestral use

**MrMoodle** (6.5): i don’t know if i sort of like this or if it’s just that it follows one of the worst songs i’ve heard in months. i definitely didn’t like it before this rate so i reckon it’s the latter

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): Sorry I don’t really care for this sob. The string sample looping I find somewhat annoying and Nicki is fine here but the song is not one I return to.

**frogaranaman** (4): it's fun but absolutely overplayed to death for me

**TiltControls** (4): katy perry saying epic fail in 2010 already sounded dated

**kappyko** (2): shit from a butt

I can see why this was a hit wow what a moment

---

**kielaurie** (11): just a stunning song, no more needs to be said

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This a 10 even tho Bad Bunny is breaking up with me here yes this is canon 😔

**frogaranaman** (10): I hope he got his ass ate for this one fr

**jay?** (10): dined

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): that piano in the last chorus is SO pretty

**akanewasright** (9.5): someone I know once said he would suck dick to this song and that’s never left my mind

**babadork** (9.5): I am really invested in the break-up between Bad Bunny and the possibly fictional woman that kept their dog.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this should be very annoying to me but idc it bops

**MrMoodle** (9): the instrumentals on this album are the perfect mix of vibey but also catchy. so much “vibey” music just ends up feeling flat and melodically lacking but these have just the right amount of melody to be catchy and memorable while still maintaining the atmosphere the vibiness is trying to capture

**runaway3212** (9): this sounds weirdly like lift me from the ground by san holo

**Stryxen** (8.5): i sense pussy and cunt

**afs** (8): leAVE, ave ave ave

**CrimsonROSET** (8): why the fuck would you cheat on bad bunny

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): it's fine, i'm not sure why this has more streams than yo perreo sola and safaera though i feel like i've never heard of it

**welcome2thejam** (7): Sure, you seem like you're coming out of this relationship in a much stronger place, but she gets the dog, so who's the real winner here?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): it would be filler if the beat was worse

**throwaway-7650** (5.1): +.1 for the "hazen" outro but I'm rather unimpressed as a lead single

**IIIHenryIII** (4): you make better music horny

What darj said

---

**akanewasright** (10): if this song were in English, there would probably be at least a few comments that miss the point (and the video) and her mad at the lyrics… thank god it’s in Spanish and those people are just throwing ass instead

**frogaranaman** (10): the night this came out I was in Madrid still and I literally heard it 10 times, I wasn't even drinking that long

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): UNA ESTRELLA PORNO CHINGA COMO RILEY REID

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my favorite when the album dropped but it waned a tad on me and other songs grew on me much more

**jay?** (10): tricked

**runaway3212** (10): it wasn't difficult to give this a good score

**throwaway-7650** (10): "...even comparing her with women like the hermanas Hadid..."

**shipperondeck** (9): a banger

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): Can’t relate to the woman in this song I’d be with Bad Bunny 25/8

**1998tweety** (8.5): this bops...

**sebgup** (8.5): Ok this is where the album starts getting lit to me, a straight up bop

**afs** (8): should have switched Riley and Khabib but oh well

**IIIHenryIII** (8): king of enunciation

**kielaurie** (8): the build to the last chorus bumps it up

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): i love how well the opener blended into this

**seanderlust** (7.2): I love the steel drum-sounding instrument towards the end. overall a very good vibe on this song. i'm going to ignore the subject matter of calling a woman "difficult" because she won't have sex with BB for an entire week. feminist brain off, bop brain on.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i mean he just sounds hot i dont know what to tell you

**nicolas :D** (7): when he said "eh, uh, uh" i felt that

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): this feels a lil like filler

**jay?** (10): waitttt omfg.. gag the girls a bit

I considered 11ing this. And I guess I can now reveal that at one point BICHOTA was Karol’s only song in the top 20, but it was #3, we did this album dirty and I hope y’all can see it some day dsfksdflk

---

**throwaway-7650** (11): they (karol and nathy) hit the PRAK (SLAY) button @ 0:36

**akanewasright** (10): nathy put her whole hip hip hoppussy into this one

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait maybe this is a slay

**fadedblue09** (10): very stunning vocals and the probably the one time where I enjoyed the feature as well

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): not to be basic but I’m giving this a ten

**ImADudeDuh** (10): damn, i wish i was just getting over a breakup cause this album would hit so much harder

**jay?** (10): jesus omfg i was team bad bunny just looking at the artists in the rate but wow.... karol for rate winner i gasped

**seanderlust** (10): Nancy Pelosi spitting here (yes this joke has been made but I DON'T CARE I'M MAKING IT ANYWAYS!!!!)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is such an ear worm

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): This whole song sounds hot I fear

**ignitethephoenix** (9): idk what they are saying but I’m sure they ended men

**runaway3212** (9): omg not the cat going to purrrgatory

**1998tweety** (8.5): Nathy ate a bit

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): are they singing about Puss in Boots? I mean, I wouldn't hold them accountable for it, the kitty has its charm

**afs** (8): that switch up early on caught me by surprise

**frogaranaman** (8): speaker of the house ate Karol UP

**shipperondeck** (8): nathy peluso slay!!!

**you2009** (8): nancy pelosi going off on karol g songs when she needs to be fixing climate change or whatever I don't know I'm not american

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): Iba ser un 9 hasta que Nathy empezó :/

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): [insert tired speaker of the house joke here]

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): the producer tag is starting to kinda annoy me at this point

**nicolas :D** (6): :notfeelingher:

**MrMoodle** (5.5): nancy pelosi what have you gotten yourself into this time

**kielaurie** (4): with better production, this would be an easy 8, but what should be a springy beat just feels lifeless due to the terrible percussion, and the bass can only carry the low end so far

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (3): nathy peluso sets off my fight or flight response

**shipperondeck** (8.131): i still think this is a horrible title for an album but she slayed

**throwaway-7650** (8.031): am I really a pophead if I didn't prefer *her* album over m*n's

**welcome2thejam** (7.875): Feels like this could be a fine stepping stone for people like me who aren't familiar with Reggaeton, cause it pulls from a handful of places and mixes it fairly well with the sound. Source: me. A merely good middle-back keeps it from hitting that top tier, but a super strong front and final track are worth remembering.

**TiltControls** (7.750): Also I know producer tags/calls are a thing and I don't want to take a way from the work they do, but damn did it get grating hearing it for the 12th time in a row when looping the album

**afs** (7.719): pretty decent! I would've liked if she experimented more with the tracks and her voice, but there aren't any poor tracks. so not a bad listen! with a few cuts of the generic tracks and more vocals, this could be a very sharp album. but I don't mind what we got instead too much!

**xnowayjosex** (7.631): never heard this entire album, but damn she surprised me lol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.506): This album had a lot that I really liked that was new to me. Loved the variety of different genres covered for an all-around fun album.

**babadork** (7.312): I didn’t start listening to KAROL G until 200 COPAS, which is still my favorite song on this album. I’m glad that this rate led me to checking out more than just the singles, because I like a lot of the other songs better.

**DaHumanTorch** (6.950): Becky G is the superior reggaeton girlie with a G initial as her last name and I urge everyone to stream MALA SANTA, her debut, and ESQUEMAS, her upcoming sophomore album releasing on May 13th. She is so much more than just "the Shower girl"!!

**thedoctordances1940** (6.550): has some highlights but overall kinda eh and one really really bad song

**IIIHenryIII** (6.481): I don't mind long albums, except when they could definitely do it with a shorter tracklist, which is the case here.

**skargardin** (6.438): I think this album could've benefitted from being like 5 songs shorter or so. I fear that the singles are the highlights for me.

**frogaranaman** (6.063): I still don't feel comfortable with that cover art knowing the story behind it

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5.750): I really do not care for this album, it's too samey sounding and karol g sounds like she's bored in a couple of tracks

**MrMoodle** (5.281): it’s hard to tell from a distance bc the album picture on spotify is so small but i am pretty sure that's a penis (i know there’s a plane ok the dick looks like it’s pointing out from behind it)

I love this song but I don’t get how it got to top 10, good for her though, and for my besties that 11d it you are valid <3

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): ok so it’s not one of the Bangers here, but i love any song that can capture the twinge of sadness you get when you’re going out and you don’t really want to be there. plus the vocoder at the end is like the cherry on top. easily my most played & fave song of the album

**jay?** (11): slaughtered

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this is just a reggaeton version of a charli xcx song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): srry for being basic but this is a big vibe

**akanewasright** (10): the vocoder at the end :poohascend:

**fadedblue09** (10): An album highlight

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): i want to live in the vocoder bit at the end

**kielaurie** (10): I shouldn't need to explain, but that outro does things to me

**runaway3212** (10): one thing about me is that I love that cool multilayered autotune voice thingy, if you put that in your song I will give you a 10

**welcome2thejam** (10): Adding the electronic element to the beat adds sooo much. Wish it continued on to more of a climax after the cool vocoder bit, but still great overall

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I imagine this song is about that girl Drake was singing about in Hotline Bling. She’s still out here away from Drake living her best life yassss

**MrMoodle** (9): this one has such a generic modern aesthetic in the instrumental but bad bunny just sprinkles MAGIC on this shit, i don’t know what it is. i used to dislike bad bunny’s vocals but they’ve really grown on me soooo much

**afs** (8.5): alright how many comments are gonna talk about the Kanye + Kardashian line

**seanderlust** (8.5): "the kardashian is no longer down for kanye" ok wait...what did bad bunny know in 2020

**TiltControls** (8.5): Love the vocal processing thing at the end there

**sebgup** (8.4): Underrated bop, and that autotune part? Okay dad bunny you did that.

**1998tweety** (8): wait those last 30 seconds with the vocoder im ascending

**CrimsonROSET** (8): hyperpop

**nicolas :D** (8): daft punk moment

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): wasn’t feeling this until that outro hit, but I’m a sucker for that vocodered kind of sound

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the outro with the vocoder(?)

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): daft punk serve at the end but the rest was kinda mid

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this was not good but the vocoder at the end made me raise it a tad

I don’t know why this gets to me so much, I really appreciate a lot of what he did here and I get it stuck on my head more than I give it credit for.

---

**letsallpoo** (11): i would let this man impregnate me

**akanewasright** (10): SUCH a strong opener, my god

**babadork** (10): That reworked sample of “The Girl From Ipanema” is perfection.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): girl from ipanema type beat- wait it literally is girl from ipanema

**frogaranaman** (10): fell to my fucking knees when the Tiktok of Benito singing "maldito año nuevooooo" with his gf popped up on my fyp fr

**IIIHenryIII** (10): what a fun opener, it's such a nice treat. Guess I found my eleven

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://gfycat.com/neatbabyishgordonsetter

**kappyko** (10): YOWCHHHHHHHHHHH THIS ONE HURT ME

**seanderlust** (10): solo comparto memes - me going through an actively bad time but sharing that demi ringtone meme to my friends instead of talking about my feelings

**MrMoodle** (9): mii channel core

**nt96** (9): "Me botaron del trabajo" Same :'(

**TiltControls** (9): The production on this sounds a little like it came from the Wii era (complimentary)

**shipperondeck** (8.8): honestly i didn't expect the video game inspired sounds. i love it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): How many artists start their albums talking about their ex’s mom? Both king shit but consider leaving that nice lady alone

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): this beat starts out sounding like Nintendo soundtrack music, I’m into it

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): that tiktok that’s like putting on this album expecting to throw ass and then it opens with this heartbroken ass song

**jay?** (8): slayed

classic but mi gente outsells

---

**1998tweety** (11): i cant make the music not bop

**frogaranaman** (11): cannot lie.. I like both remixes but I actually remember this remix compared to the other and that's the deciding factor for me

**Ghost-Quatet** (11): My friends back in school really liked this song and so my main memory of it is when it came on at a party and they all started screaming the lyrics and dancing along with it. Like yeah Bieber is an asshole but that's not the song's fault, people had fun with this.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): this remix is bad, but the other one is worse

**Jerry1014** (11): it made reggaeton mainstream globally and will always be a classic

**afs** (0): Despacito 2 at home:

**akanewasright** (0): See I do like Despacito at a baseline, but even without Bieber I greatly prefer Mi Gente… and then you throw in Bieber’s strained ass vocals and it’s all over

**creme** (0): the girl i had a crush on was obsessed w singing this song after studying abroad in [redacted south american country i do not want her to find this comment] and i was still in love w her after that what was wrong w me

**jackisboredtoday** (0): This isn't 0 worthy, I actually enjoy hearing it these days, then again if this were a little less dominant Wild Thoughts could've gotten Rihanna her 15th number 1 hit so maybe it does deserve this 0

**nicolas D:** (0): i want to kill myself

**nt96** (0): I never liked this song whatsoEVER. Easiest 0 I had to make.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I couldn't give Justin an 11

**Roxieloxie** (0): do you know how much energy it takes to make despacito sound bad??? are you kidding me???

**seanderlust** (0): writing this comment while asking my Alexa to set a timer because I'm cooking. I say "alexa..." and pause briefly to consider my options. Remembering that I risk burning my omlette if I make this joke that only I will find funny, I sigh and resignedly say "set a timer for four minutes."

**Stryxen** (0): BEST SONG EVER

**tchalla1966** (0): Too much Bieber not enough Daddy Yankee.

**thedoctordances1940** (0): I mean it's genuinely not as terrible as many have made it out to be but it's still not a good song. bieber adds fuck all and the production at times can be not particularly good let's say, but now it's no longer ridiculously overplayed i probably wouldn't complain about it too much if it came on. flawed but catchy

**welcome2thejam** (0): I'm watching the video, and at 3:25 Justin Bieber is straight-up driving backwards at 40 mph

PERIODD

---

**afs** (11): wait why is her verse so lyrically disconnected from the rest of the song is it a sign

**akanewasright** (11): What else was I gonna do?

**creme** (11): smasha

**jackisboredtoday** (11): I mean I had to... the night this dropped had me so excited, plus it's Bey and she always brings it on these sorts of things (I say while willfully ignoring the eminem feature she did only a couple months later)

**nicolas D:** (11): actually never knew this existed but i yassed

**nt96** (11): Is it weird that I never heard this before? Even tho I'm Spanish??? Tbh I really like this!

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I couldn't give Beyoncé a 0

**Roxieloxie** (11): okay so im rating the homecoming version of this because i want to and like are you kidding me ??? i listened to it last night while doing the rate and like I want to ascend to a higher plane of being when i hear this

**seanderlust** (11): banger to end all bangers

**Stryxen** (11): :who:

**tchalla1966** (11): I mean she’s obviously been taking lessons since Irreemplazable

**thedoctordances1940** (11): the beat definitely gets a bit annoying after a while, as with the original, but the production is also really good so I'd take it over despacito

**welcome2thejam** (11): The normal versions of these songs would be a tough decision, I rate them similarly. But Bieber Despacito vs Beyonce Mi Gente? C'mon now.

**1998tweety** (0): bey is queen but unfortunately jb outsold

**frogaranaman** (0): it saddens me to report that I forgot this remix for the longest time and thus it gets my 0 by default here

**Ghost-Quatet** (0): ...anyways can't wait until we rate The Gift (Deluxe)!

**IIIHenryIII** (0): sorry, but Bey ruined this

**Jerry1014** (0): smash hit

“No te hagas la santa el perreo te encanta” is just a life-changing sentence everyone who discredits reggaeton needs to listen and take into consideration

---

**frogaranaman** (11): Benito said this was his favorite song off YHLQMDLG and honestly? taste way to promote a rate 11

**akanewasright** (10): you guys… I don’t think this is about the big guy in red who says “ho ho ho”

**cremeebrulee** (10): SMASH!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Daddy Yankee retired to actually become a saint yasss

**fadedblue09** (10): this is fire

**jay?** (10): devoured

**MrMoodle** (10): maaan this one hits. the backing track feels so melancholic and the hooks are fucking stupid catchy. bad bunny and daddy yankee have amazing chemistry and the ad libs throughout the track mesh perfectly. almost considered giving my 11 to this over safaera but fuck i want my 11 to win for once lol

**shipperondeck** (10): dear god daddy yankee never misses does he

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): daddy YANKEE bad BUNNY

**tchalla1966** (10): ooh they came together and made such a bop

**seanderlust** (9.5): bad bunny and daddy yankee work so well together on this!! even as someone who only knows the reggaeton world by proxy, daddy yankee retiring is sad to me. i mean, good for him - get your bag and enjoy your life, king - but he has such a great flow and is fun to hear on a track

**nicolas :D** (9): esto es lo que yo llamo "un clásico"

**runaway3212** (9): STREAM CHRISTMAS EVEL BY STRAY KIDS

**welcome2thejam** (9): Catchy chorus melody, and the two bounce off each other well

**sebgup** (8.9): Ok this is fire ngl, Daddy Yankee adds so much to this song and it makes it greater.

**afs** (8.5): 'don't act like a saint, you love to twerk' stan twitter to phcj when they're clowned for the thousandth time

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.5): "no te hagas la santa, el perreo te encanta" is directed to the annoying hipsters who would never listen to reggaeton bcs it's so nasty and banal... ok throw ass to the strokes then

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sometimes some good dick and moving on is good, at least you got to fuck him

**IIIHenryIII** (7): daddy brought his a-game, but the song didn't help

**throwaway-7650** (7): kind of expected more from these legends but this still slays a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I’m sorry but the dude in the background is really taking me out of it T__T the rest of the song is nice I just wish he’d quiet down a bit

This was quite a hit and cultural reset, but I’m not the biggest fan, still, huge smash

---

**Jerry1014** (11): one of the best Latin party songs of all time

**nicolas :D** (11): this is not just a song this is an EXPERIENCE

**Roxieloxie** (11): forgive me for being basic but that instrumental does something to me

**runaway3212** (11): best song ever???

**akanewasright** (10): HE FUCKING DROPPED THE YASS GRENADE AAAAA

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i wish i had a raunchy story to share about this song because like it calls for one

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this classic omg it aged wonderfully too it still pops off

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Yeah this still bangs. And the Beyonce version an 11, excited to be clustered with all my besties who mention Bey on this song <3

**frogaranaman** (10): one time this came on in the (American straight) club and I was obviously throwing ass as one good willing latino would. then my friends looked at me halfway thru like 'you good?' and I was like oh great someone's grinding on me. so I turned around and it was this like 30 year old man?? randomly walked up to me and started grinding on me. he was kinda a hot bear type so I didn't mind but then he disappeared before I could chat him up (according to my friends, 'darted' away) and then I didn't see him until later. so when I finally found him I walked up to him and started talking but then he IMMEDIATELY cut me off and was like "I'm sorry, I'm closeted. I don't know why I did that. I feel embarrassed" and then ran away. anyways ¿dónde está mi gente?

**jay?** (10): CLASSICCCCCCCCC GET YOUR FUCKING ASS UP AND SHAKE IT. IT SEEMS LIKE NOBODY WANTS TO SHAKE SOME ASS ANYMORE

**kappyko** (10): i made the sickest mashup of this song and bleep techno classic "Nurture" by LFO for a Rave.dj competition and it didn't win. what did win however was my mashup of Khia's My Neck My Back and Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy

**kielaurie** (10): the original from just Willy William was already strong, but this elevates it so much

**nt96** (10): You can tell Billie took some notes from this but she still failed.

**skargardin** (10): it's the smasha

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a strong 11 contender

**MrMoodle** (9.5): yeah ok this fucks even without beyonce

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): and Beyoncé?

**seanderlust** (9.5): this is a good song but i fear that now that i've heard the beyonce remix, the original feels like an unfinished demo

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): “Francia, Colombia. Me gusta (FREEZE) J Balvin, Willy William Me gusta (FREEZE)” will never not set me off

**welcome2thejam** (9): If this ever hit overplay I'd probably be sick of that beat, but thankfully (?) radio around me didn't care about it, so it's still good to me!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): bop but it’s not as good as I remember

**1998tweety** (8.5): now where is Bey

**afs** (8.5): I HATED this song so much when it came out along with Despacito but that transition still lives rent free in my head, trans really makes everything better

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.5): sorry to j balvin and willy william but this does need Beyoncé's "yo soy la reina de los nenes"

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): how on earth was queen b able to ruin a song???

**indie\_fan\_** (8.2): “Mi música no discrimina a nadie” ¿Estás seguro de eso José?

**TiltControls** (7.5): solid, but the production never grew on me enough to give it higher (even if it is a super iconic and memorable track)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kinda middling for something that’s such a big hit? But not bad

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): it's good but the beat is kinda annoying tbh

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): hate to be that person but ... beyonce version outsold

**you2009** (6): I've only ever listened to the homecoming live ver of this song which I have dozens of plays of so hearing this for the first time and having my mind fill beyoncé in where she isn't...[pinocchio emoje]

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): i'm sorry but that vocal sample has always been super grating to me, to the point where the rest of the song is distracting

**shipperondeck** (3): THIS IS WHERE THIS FUCKING SONG COMES FROM?? sob emoji

**throwaway-7650** (3): [B?](https://media2.giphy.com/media/10clvJfIPQpWes/200.gif)

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I’m sorry, but I have hated this song since it came out. The initial beat is fine at first but after about 30 seconds it becomes the most irritating thing imaginable. I hate this song SO FUCKING MUCH!

**akanewasright** (9.5): oh Anitta fucking came to kill

**Stryxen** (9.2): this is so cunty so cunty that it actually was too similar to the cunt barrier of 10.000 and repelled against it, so it bounced back slightly

**1998tweety** (9): serve a bit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): BANGER. Everyone here really serving and the production is hard-hitting.

**kielaurie** (8): it's hype, but a touch too repetitive

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this whole song is kinda kpop coded

**indie\_fan\_** (7.1): Iba darle un 8.5 y luego escuche ese coro.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this sounded better when it first came out, oh I totally forgot Anitta was here, take an extra point

plastichaxan: # Vibras

**Overall Average**: 7.569 **// Average Controversy:** 1.533

I think the journey of Vibras is pretty interesting in the rate, some surprises, one or two robberies and some fairness so yeah, I’m not too mad and I don’t have much to say dsfjsdfkjl

**frogaranaman** (8.000): this album goes by so quick (in a good way lol)

**afs** (7.885): this album was much better than anticipated! that transition upfront really set the tone for the album, and I also appreciate that we actually have a decent length (unlike the other two) so we don't fall into filler territory. good listen!

**welcome2thejam** (7.769): Solid! No big lows, but didn't have a major smash til Machika came on the scene. J Balvin just isn't a big presence comparatively, but don't take that as a hard diss to him or the album, cause I had good time listening.

**kappyko** (7.731): This is so nonbinary vibras

**xnowayjosex** (7.700): few great songs, others could be better, probly his best album

**bigbigbee** (7.615): I was really surprised to hear that this was most people’s least favorite. I think it’s a super tight album that, even at its worst, is still fun and boppy.

**TiltControls** (7.462): I don't think this album had the same highs as the other two, but it was consistently solid throughout at least.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.346): I like the songs here with features. Bad Bunny and Karol have charisma and compelling singing voices that draw me in. J Balvin does not. I get very bored when it’s just him on the track, sadly.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.154): I don't think j balvin is ever going to make an album like this one ever again

**indie\_fan\_** (6.985): Estoy diciendo la verdad cuando digo que casi no participe en este rate por este p*****o. Todavía me acuerdo de ese vídeo para “Perra”. Pero voy a intentar no dejar que me afecte tanto por este rate.

**throwaway-7650** (6.808): this album will probably be robbed when the real enemy is YHLQMDLG. neither is that much better than the other btw, both are ~6.5/10

**babadork** (6.762): If I were to be teleported into the video for “Ambiente” with this on repeat, I would hope that I would enjoy myself. Unfortunately, the overall vibes were just too chill and mellow for my preferences.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.692): most of this album really just exists and is fine for me, there really isn't that much notable here

**shipperondeck** (6.615): the best thing about this album is the cover tbh

**IIIHenryIII** (6.500): What a horrible cover. It doesn't sell the album at all, which is very ok. It's missing the bang element. Most of the songs sound so lifeless and not fun at all.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.231): that was definitely an album made up of songs that J Balvin provided vocals to.

I just think it’s the best song ever made and y’all who tanked are ugly for it

---

**akanewasright** (11): God, this is a literal goddamn masterpiece

**babadork** (11): This is an absolutely epic megamix of a song that I can’t imagine being replicated any time soon. Mostly because you do have to pay people for all of those samples.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I love the megamix take of this song and how bold and brash it is. SO MUCH IS HAPPENING. Whew what a song

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): this is my 11 for this rate and it just makes sense. It's like 4 songs in one, it has callbacks to classic reggaeton songs, started two differente trends and it has some of the best rhymes of this whole album. Mostly it just leaves us with an important lesson: si tu novio no te mama el culo 😔 pa eso que no mame 😇

**kappyko** (11): multi-part songs tend to be incredibly overrated but this is still as brilliant as it was 2 years ago and is arguably one of the most legitimately interesting mainstream hit songs we will have this decade

**MrMoodle** (11): i absolutely do NOT have the fucking time to do this rate, i’ve literally been so busy and will continue to be for the next several weeks and doing this will make it twice as bad, but when i saw yhlqmdlg would be part of this i HAD to do it so i could give this my 11. this is the centerpiece of the album and the centerpiece of this rate and was the centerpiece of my life for like 3 months in 2020. 9.5+ average incoming??? 😳😳

**nt96** (11): Perfect for the church playlist

**tchalla1966** (11): ugh what is there to say this song is perfection

**welcome2thejam** (11): Keep Betty Boop's name out of your mouth

**bigbigbee** (10): OBVIOUSLY the Get Ur Freak On sample is amazing, but my favorite part of this (excellent) song is the opening part. Something about that synth is just so….MMMMMMM! love it. Gets me hype every time I hear it.

**cremeebrulee** (10): fuck maybe i should’ve 11d this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): throw that ass in a circle ‘uh

**frogaranaman** (10): got my ass ate to this once! true to form

**nicolas :D** (10): you just got slayed... slayed...

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh yeah... i can see why this is the smasha, that sample is used VERY well

**Roxieloxie** (10): I mean what do you want me to say, the song is fucking insane

**seanderlust** (10): did cupcakke ghostwrite this wtf this is filthy

**sebgup** (10): By taking a look at the past he might have just changed the game, the mix of samples and structure is so crazy and just iconic.

**shipperondeck** (10): this blew my mind. idk what else to say

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is the definition of a "straight banger." love a long song that changes vibes multiple times

**TragicKingdom1** (10): he put his full bad bussy into this one

**1998tweety** (9): this song stands out so much from the rest of the album and in a good way

**ignitethephoenix** (9): is this the Sicko Mode of Reggaeton music?

**jackisboredtoday** (9): Ok the production here is really something special, instant standout

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): banger purr

**afs** (8): holy shit the lyrics are DEPRAVED but too blunt, carried by the switch ups

**fadedblue09** (8): The beat switches are interesting, but I can't say I like the song fully

**runaway3212** (8): using the jaws theme cause he's a shark chasing that gay adoration and he gets it

**jay?** (7): bowel movement beat for that first minute :/

**kielaurie** (7): the track is pretty hype, but I really don't understand how it's constantly rated as anywhere near the best song on the album. Also, not enough Bunny

**TiltControls** (6.5): the Missy sample is a ton of fun, though I wish I liked the front half more

**IIIHenryIII** (6): they lost me in every single transition

**throwaway-7650** (5): curse jowell & randy, forcing me to give kali uchis a negative score

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I wish I had a picture of my face when this came on because I was so confused… this is like those kitchen sink Kpop songs that are just a bunch of parts jammed together but usually some of those are good while these are all really ugly? I was like “maybe it has good lyrics” but I looked them up and they’re kinda disgusting too? Really don’t like this. I listened to it a bunch more times because people in the Discord said it was critically acclaimed but it didn’t get any better.

A cultural reset, and that MV… I looked respectfully AND disrespectfully. Predictable winner? Absolutely. Deserving? Sure. Would I prefer a different outcome? Yes, but I’ll take this. We did the rate and I’m really happy I could host yet another slay rate.

**celladonn** (11): This may be a really basic 11 choice but ummm... it bangs

**CrimsonROSET** (11): all my comments in this album are horny for a reason and this is the peak

**ignitethephoenix** (11): intense twerking alone

**ImADudeDuh** (11): a last place PHVMA video of the year loser

**jackisboredtoday** (11): BANGER!! and one of his most iconic songs & videos for a reason

**seanderlust** (11): this has been an absolute earworm since i first heard it. the attitude is perfect, the beat is danceable, both BB and the girl sound amazing

**thedoctordances1940** (11): just an absolute fucking banger

**akanewasright** (10): god this video is like the best thing I’ve ever seen

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): can’t believe Safaera invented music so I can’t give this an 11 :( This music video coming out at the very start of quarantine really got me through it

**frogaranaman** (10): big titty benito yasssss

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): feminist anthem, bi anthem, everything anthem, QUE NINGÚN BABOSO SE LE PEGUE anthem

**nt96** (10): siiiii reina MATAR

**Stryxen** (10): more like yo serve

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): it's a banger

**TiltControls** (10): just a blast to listen to

**shipperondeck** (9.5): i looked up the lyrics for this one bc i didn't know who the female singer was and i was genuinely surprised??? like ok badass!

**fadedblue09** (9): A hard hitting club bop

**nicolas :D** (9): people were singing this in funerals, graduations, homecomings, weddings, proms...

**skargardin** (9): this is a smash

**throwaway-7650** (9): VOTE FOR CARTUNES (CARTOON TUNES)! u/Ghost-Quartet

**babadork** (8.9): I like the idea of the song, but I wish it was more obvious. I also don’t get why Nesi doesn’t have a featured credit.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this shit is good

**jay?** (8): that breast plate literally pushed thru the screen and hit me in my face

**afs** (7.5): if only those horrific background sounds were replaced by something more listenable...

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): my ass is moving slightly

**kielaurie** (7): some of the synths are awkward as hell, but he absolutely snaps here

**runaway3212** (6): this is the first time a woman has added negative value to a song

**frogaranaman** (9.100): it's latinophobic that this album released right before the pandemic

**Jerry1014** (8.695): One of the best albums of all time!

**xnowayjosex** (8.660): this is a crazy album, mostly hits, his best album so far. I knew this was gonna be the best album on here lol

**akanewasright** (8.525): I am still a little bit in awe that an album this long can keep up the pace and not really miss much at all? Bad Bunny is a brilliant artist ~~please return my calls~~

**MrMoodle** (8.520): so i reckon this kind of eclipses the other albums in this rate looool. i graded this higher than the others initially but then when i compared similar scores across albums it became apparent that i'd graded them on a much easier scale and i had to readjust a little. this just isn’t in the same league tbh. if bad bunny doesn’t absolutely dominate day 3 i’ll be let down.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.485): All of the music videos for this album are an 11/10. Love the range he brought here. And I could listen to his voice all day.

**shipperondeck** (7.940): i get the bad bunny hype now

**welcome2thejam** (7.850): Before this rate, my only heavy exposure to Bad Bunny was the dude showing up in WWE, wrestling at Wrestlemania, and actually being a complete goddamn natural at it and hitting flip piledrivers/Canadian destroyers to my delight. So I came in predisposed to like him, and thankfully, turns out he's super good at his actual musician job too lmao. A fun, musical flow makes it an easy listen. Does feel like it's hour runtime for sure, but it's generally very good on a track-by-track basis.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.675): this is THE album. It completely changed my opinion on Bad Bunny

**skargardin** (7.650): Even though this was slightly too long for my liking, there's still a lot to enjoy! The vast majority of the songs bop hard and the constant flow of new guest verses keeps things interesting throughout the album listen.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.640): i enjoyed this album it is good 👍, i think this maybe benefitted from being the first album i rated and without longer breaks between rating the albums the whole sound wore me down a little but it definitely does have the most highlights so i'd say it's deserved

**babadork** (7.560): I hadn’t sat down and listened to this entire album since it came out. It’s still great. 20 songs is too many, and I’m annoyed it’s going to bring down my average.

**TiltControls** (7.350): Bit long which causes it to drag at parts, but also a ton of really great stuff in here

**afs** (6.650): oh my god what happened to this album after safaera, I was somewhat enjoying it too 😭 this was a difficult listen honestly, because bad bunny's drawl and the album length aren't really digestible on the first couple of listens. but hidden amongst the madness are a few good tracks, and I can certainly get some idea of why he's acclaimed.

**throwaway-7650** (6.605): as the longest album in this rate, I predicted that I would have the hardest time with it of the 3 and it was a bit too bloated for my liking, also I still don't like bad bunny's voice very much, this was an issue I had with my first bad bunny album, El Último Tour Del Mundo (lol I remember back then I thought he was retiring... wait is he still? I don't remember how that saga ended, if it did). however, as someone who is another minority in the U.S., it's amazing to see bad bunny/reggaeton (including becky/karol G) thrive! here's to more non-english music on the charts in the 20s! vámanos!

**IIIHenryIII** (5.500): Way too long. This would have been a better album had 6-7 tracks not made the final cut

**indie\_fan\_** (5.275): Me gustan más canciones que pensé que iba a gustar, pero todavía no me veo escuchando este álbum completo en el futuro. (BTW yes I speak English as well, but I want to speak mostly Spanish for the sake of this rate :P).

plastichaxan: ##Songs

Congrats to **Yo Perreo Sola** for the win today! With its 9.047 score it takes 285th overall out of all rated songs. It sits just behind Lady Gaga's Paparazzi from the Billboard 2009 rate and just above Dua Lipa's Physical.

No other 9+s today, but with 13 11's Safaera would end up in the top 100 for most 11's gotten (not leaderboard worthy, but still super impressive!)

##Artists

Since J Balvin and Bad Bunny have a couple previous scores (aka us rating I Like It 3 times), they've got some previous history affecting their scores however this is their first time having enough to chart on the boards.

Out of 303 artists

* 91st: FKA twigs (+0.004 points)
* **92nd: Bad Bunny (New)**
* 93rd: Aly & AJ (-0.003 points)

-

* 120th: SZA (+0.008 points)
* **121st: J Balvin (New)**
* 121st: f(x) (tie)
* 123rd: Lil Nas X (-0.001 points)

-

* 181st: Ludacris (+0.006 points)
* **182nd: Karol G (New)**
* 182nd: En Vogue (tie)
* 184th: Hayley Kiyoko (-0.004 points)

-

* Despite the competition over the past few cycles, Nicki retakes the crown for most rate appearances with 20. She surpasses Ariana, Taylor and Rihanna who are both still sitting at 19 (and also continues her streak of most appearances with no win)

##Albums

**KG0516** almost takes the 'D'Angelo/Kylie' award for 'earliest in a 3 album rate' by still managing to land in the single digits. However this is still bad enough to make the leaderboard. Karol G sits in 3rd tied with superstar albums Charli XCX's True Romance and The Vamp's Meet The Vamps which both left in 9th as well.

For some good(?) news for the rate, **YHLQMDLG** lands on a leaderboard in 7th place for 'highest 11 split' for managing to take 56.4% of the 11s in the rate! The current leader of this stat is One Direction's FOUR which had 65.8%
