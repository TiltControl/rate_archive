My original comment for this was ‚Äúdo 2021 Acclaimed Indie Girls rate periodddd‚Äù and I don‚Äôt remember why but I spilled

---

**jay?** (10): a cover slay idek who the original is by but theyre fad karol queen

**runaway3212** (10): I actually love this

**Stryxen** (10): girl??? Sean kingston??? Why is this just in the middle of the album??? This is so funny i can‚Äôt hate it - this is how oxford dictionary defines ‚Äúcamp‚Äù

**celladonn** (9): I was not expecting a Ludacris feature but I'm not complaining

**nicolas :D** (9): spanglish serve

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i feel bad scoring this so high bc it's one of the few songs that has engish but i'm obvs not scoring a ludacris feature low and i love the vibes

**TiltControls** (9): This shouldn't work (and it kind of doesn't) but my ears still really enjoy this. Also what happened to Sean Kingston after his 2-3 years of chart hits?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): The interpolation works really well here

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): I know I saw some people tanking this but idc this sample is camp

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I actually kinda like this even if it sounds like YouTube musician's content

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i‚Äôm sorry but the sample in the beginning took me the fuck out. Rest in peace my king, fly high angel üôè üëº

**Roxieloxie** (8): lisa staring at plate jpeg

**afs** (7.5): Sean KINGston outsold

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): the lyrics... it's giving kpop song translated into english

**seanderlust** (7.2): no this entirely outsold the sean Kingston original. EDIT: nvm Ludacris just showed up

**akanewasright** (7): This is disappointing for a Sean Kingston sample and Luda verse‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still a Sean Kingston sample and Luda verse so

**nt96** (7): Cortizone?

**ricki** (7): karol eilish

**welcome2thejam** (7): The Beautiful Girls hook? LUDACRIS!? Song's outta control

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): yes Sean Kingston get your coin (and also Ben E King through sampleception)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): oh no this sample is giving me war flashbacks and Ludacris‚Äôs verse is corny in the bad way‚Ä¶ yet I don‚Äôt hate it

**fadedblue09** (5.5): The sample choice is camp though

**CrimsonROSET** (5): the sample choice is camp as fuck, the verses are a slay but the chorus does NOT make up for it

**frogaranaman** (5): what is this sample üíÄ

**rotating3Dtext** (5): :\

**shipperondeck** (5): mixes are usually fun but unlike other mixes in this rate, this one is just boring

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.5): Yeah I really don‚Äôt like this. The Beautiful Girls/Stand By Me interpolation is not working at all, and can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but Luda‚Äôs verse is not his best. A miss for me.

**1998tweety** (4): this sample :skull:

**you2009** (3.3): :(...

**babadork** (2): I had never heard the uncensored version of ‚ÄúBeautiful Girls.‚Äù It‚Äôs pretty messed up. It avoids a 0 only because I cannot resist Ludacris.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2): No.

**kielaurie** (2): just no

**cremeebrulee** (1): this sample hello???

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i know people are gonna say "it's camp!" no it's just bad. the only camp this could be is Camp Crystal Lake because this murdered music as a whole

**MrMoodle** (0): how do you make ludacris boring. LUDACRIS. HOW HAVE YOU DONE THIS KAROL G. this might be even more impressive than when maroon 5 made megan thee fucking stallion boring. also, movie trailer version of a sean kingston song??? WHO DEVISED THIS???

**skargardin** (0): good god I had erased this completely from my memory

**thedoctordances1940** (0): just oh so very kitsch and not in a good way

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i cant decide if its more baffling that a) someone came up with the idea for this song or b) someone thought it was a good idea

Yeah this isn‚Äôt my favorite but maybe not bottom two on the rate for me, I‚Äôm not bothered though

---

**Stryxen** (10): poppy told me this was a good song and i‚Äôve listened to this too much it‚Äôs starting to blend together lemme stan because i trust their taste

**jay?** (9): demolished

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): the panning on this track is so satisfying omg

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): ‚ÄúRay Charles flow‚Äù u/2dina3dworld promoting tradpop (idek if Ray Charles is in that rate list lol)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): got jumpscared by that synth that bounces between headphones lol‚Ä¶ was feeling this up until the outro which was kinda cringey and I knocked it down a bit for that

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): this has the more harsh and foreboding synth of some of my favorites on the album, so I do enjoy it, but something about the delivery doesn‚Äôt hit quite as hard as the other ones in this vein

**ImADudeDuh** (7): yes i frantically googled if Myke Towers was afro-latino before deciding my score

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): thoroughly enjoy the final rap

**akanewasright** (6): when he said I ain‚Äôt got shit‚Ä¶ he was right

**rotating3Dtext** (6): by this song I‚Äôm tired of the macho posturing on this album‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (6): Beat's nothing to write home about, but the attitude's and aggressiveness is carrying the track through sheer force of will

**seanderlust** (5.5): I mean, it's fine but at this point I either want to back up to safaera or skip to P FKN R

**runaway3212** (5): me when im meh

**shipperondeck** (4): ok i don't think it's horrible but i spaced out every time i listened to this song

**cremeebrulee** (3): what is this outro help üò≠üò≠

**kappyko** (3): all these points are for the feature

**afs** (2): I miss reggaeton

**CrimsonROSET** (0): a bad beat brings a bad performance, it just has no energy or nothing that I want in a reggaeton song, especially the random narration at the end like ???

**IIIHenryIII** (0): what happened? This album was kinda good a few tracks ago

**nicolas :D** (0): grinny

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the dudes almost completely ruin the song

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why do they sound so bored here

**CrimsonROSET** (5): why are the feats on this album so hit and miss

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): The outran on this album are a bit over indulgent

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.5): this song seems like... lazy??? to me?? idk technical terms

**MrMoodle** (4): i feel like this album has just been the same spacey ‚Äúdum. ba-dum baa-dum.‚Äù stock reggaeton beat on loop for like 25 minutes now lol

**kielaurie** (1): Ovy are you taking the piss, this is bloody horrible, low end filter makes it sound like a wet fart, the snare is fading out of existence, hats could have raised the atmosphere but there's about 5 in the entire song, plus it's much too slow. Karol does her best, but the features take over the song and don't do much either

**jay?** (10): chewed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This one fell flat for me sadly

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): kinda forgot this was playing both times I listened to it

**fadedblue09** (4): Unremarkable

**ImADudeDuh** (4): spectrum pulse is somewhere fuming

**throwaway-7650** (3.5): yeah the lyrics of this song are just uncomfortable to listen to

**IIIHenryIII** (2): I mean, it's literally in the title

this is kinda dumb but i‚Äôm a hyperpop girlie and this samples a song that‚Äôs so heavy on autotune i would‚Äôve absolutely adored to hear her go at it with the autotune sdfljfsdk UPDATE: ~~the song is not as autotune heavy as I remember, in fact, this outsold it~~

---

**jay?** (10): take a sit girl. @ariana

**runaway3212** (9): insert that one wendy Williams gif here

**Stryxen** (9): yo yass√© üò≠

**nicolas :D** (8): period

**afs** (7.5): I see the bad bunny connection

**ImADudeDuh** (7): oh yeah thats why im single to haha yeah

**shipperondeck** (7): SHE MENTIONED BAD BUNNY omg they shout each other out on albums. ok i guess thats inevitable when youre two of the titans of the genre but whatever

**welcome2thejam** (7): Neat voice effects

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oh that autotune (?) on her voice on the chorus is NOT it

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): nice beat but unfortunately the rest of the track lets it down a bit

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): you're not wrong, it's a shame you don't take this seriously, I mean‚Ä¶ look at contigo voy a muerte and arranca pal carajo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): both this and the next song... hard to differentiate

**MrMoodle** (5): the autotune is a thing that happens and somewhat sets it apart from the monotony of this stretch of tracks? i‚Äôm looking for things to like here i promise lmao

My least favorite on the album so‚Ä¶ Could‚Äôve gone sooner tbh

---

**Stryxen** (10): this is such a slay ????

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it is interesting how these three albums have songs about bad one night stands

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): really like the instrumental for this one

**jay?** (8.5): period

**nicolas :D** (8): this is so laced

**welcome2thejam** (8): J Balvin has a good voice, and it's very much doing its job here, but it's not that interesting unfortunately. Will probably keep him from hitting the heights unless he surprises me or the production/beat blows me away

**afs** (7.5): enchiladas

**MrMoodle** (7.5): you know what this is pretty smooth. i‚Äôve been critical of this album for being kinda lowkey but i get it here.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): this album picks up significantly as it goes on, probably bc it gets a little bolder in its instrumentation, but this dude's voice is still boring as fuck lmao

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): oooooo so smooth and relaxing

**runaway3212** (7): this isn't bad but it's kinda less than a lot of other stuff here

**akanewasright** (6): truly cannot decide how I feel about the tongue clicking‚Ä¶ I know I think it‚Äôs okay aside from that?

**seanderlust** (5.5): nothing sticks out about this one. it's pleasant, but a touch boring if i'm being honest.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): definitely not bad, but it's lacking fun

**akanewasright** (6): I started checking the genius English translations for the songs I didn‚Äôt have comments for already, and every now and then I come across gems like ‚ÄúBut I don't know why now whenever I pray, I ask God to let me see you naked‚Äù

This kept growing on me I‚Äôm kinda glad I closed the rate before this was a higher score sob

**jay?** (10): ate again why lie

**runaway3212** (10): another fucking slay

**kielaurie** (9): there's not much to say about this project, it's just immaculate vibes

Contrasting last comment, I realized I overrated this after making the banner but oh well, Karol needed all the help she could get. Or not? We‚Äôll see.

---

**jay?** (10): move mojito @badbunny

**runaway3212** (10): the trend of this rate is I like the men more than the women, can't believe this rate finally cured me of being gay

**indie\_fan\_** (8.5): Normalmente Ozuna no me cae bien, pero no ten√≠a tantos quejas sobre el aqu√≠

**afs** (8): eek that Ariana Mac line might not have been the best

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I like the vibe

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Ozuna kind of brings this down

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): this would be a beautiful track if it was Karol only, Ozuna‚Äôs voice is so grating here

**akanewasright** (7.5): agreeably pleasant, and yet the previous two tracks of questionable collaborators are better than the one with someone who seems to be an okay dude

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): when I was in middle school I competed in odyssey of the mind

**CrimsonROSET** (7): by homer

**nicolas :D** (7): shes cute

**shipperondeck** (7): a reggaeton song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): it's a fine collab but they've both done way better

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Very generic, and the Ariana/Mac lyric did not help

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): Wish I liked this song more but it doesn‚Äôt jump off the page for me

**kielaurie** (2): there is a single song that Ozuna doesn't ruin with his presence, and this ain't it

**kielaurie** (9): brilliant performance from Karol as usual, and Ovy managed to not totally screw up the production for once

**seanderlust** (9): of all the mid-tempo ballad-ish songs on here i think this is the one that works the best. her voice, the backing instrumentals and beat and subject matter all come together very cohesively

**TiltControls** (8.5): it's no dvd menu but it'll do

**kielaurie** (8): one of the smoothest tracks here

**nicolas :D** (8): perfume genius twink de 40 a√±os

**akanewasright** (7.5): these lyrics are somewhat mild for reggaeton? I was fully ready to read that the lyrics just meant ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you right now‚Äù and am somewhat disappointed (I would throw a little ass to this though)

**runaway3212** (7): iconic

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): it's not bad at all but it drags a bit too much for me to fully enjoy it

**ImADudeDuh** (6): was robbed a bit on UK2 but she was annoying after it finished airing so w/e

**MrMoodle** (5): starting to see a trend in this album where the track starts, i think ‚Äúoh this sounds cool‚Äù and write down a high-ish score, then the song just goes on and on and literally nothing fucking changes and i start readjusting the score progressively and then by the end of it i just look like a spiteful cunt lol

Everybody stand up for Puerto Rico‚Äôs national anthem!!! This was A HUGE ROBBERY. WTF POPHEADS!!!

---

**you2009** (11): [anthony ramos off key singing] PUERTO RICOoOoOOOOOOOoOoO!!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): I wish I went to this show

**jay?** (10): i too am from p fkn r

**runaway3212** (9.9): girl calm down Public Relations aren't this exciting

**nt96** (9.5): AHHHH

**seanderlust** (9.5): PHEW they did PR proud on this one. the beat is a banger and everyone delivers their verse with such confidence and pride you can't help but bang your head a bit

**kappyko** (9): arcangel has a limp wristed voice [complimentary] he sounds like a mischievous flamboyant queer coded disney villain

**MrMoodle** (9): ee ee ur ur ur

**shipperondeck** (8.9): love the diversity of voices here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): camp

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This has such a good build up and beat, but then it doesn‚Äôt really build up to anything? I wish it just exploded. The features ate tho

**Roxieloxie** (8): i went to PR for a school trip once and i lost my glasses at the breach 3 hours we got there and I legit couldnt see the rest of the trip (4 days) , but the blobs of color i made out of the shapes the buildings in san juan i always remember being really beautiful

**Stryxen** (8): woah the p stands for puerto and the r stands for rico. woah.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Honestly, once the intro started getting heavy, I was super hoping for a more explosive track coming out of that than we got. That said, the sound works well for the dark tone, and that climactic "aaahhh!!!" in the third verse is explosive enough

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Pitch fuckin ork (that's how i read the title in my mind at least)

**akanewasright** (7.5): Benito really put his whole Bad Bunussy into this chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I really respect the lyrics and message of this one so I‚Äôm going to ignore how much I dislike that chorus‚Ä¶ also Arc√°ngel crushes that verse!

**1998tweety** (7): wild

**ImADudeDuh** (7): oh if you dont like the noises he made throughout this album, you will hate this

**TiltControls** (7): I keep reading this title as üî•üî• PK FIRE üî•üî•

**CrimsonROSET** (6): not the rererererepeating

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): I appreciate this one more in concept than in practice tbh, its just the vocals for me

**afs** (5.5): I think I figured out which one went to prison

**cremeebrulee** (4.8): where is he from again

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): ngl this could've been cut

**fadedblue09** (2): I appreciate what this tries to do but it's not for me

**IIIHenryIII** (2): exhausting

**throwaway-7650** (5): well this song never graduated from "placeholder 5 purgatory"

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I should have saved my ‚Äúthis is filler‚Äù comment for this song
