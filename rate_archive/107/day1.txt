https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kba2qw/pollen_rate_reveal_day_1_please_comment_in_this/

Hello, and welcome to the Pollen rate reveal, day one! My name is frog, and I have had the pleasure to host this rate the past month and ~~see your rancid hot takes~~ enjoy the scores you have sent in! Some quick facts before we get started:

- There were 58 participants in this rate! [You can see them here.](https://pastebin.com/5JFYKbVX)
- The average score amongst all songs is 7.754. Impressive!
- The average controversy score is 1.684. That means anything above it should be considered controversial, and anything below it should be considered agreed upon.

Today we will be revealing #37-25, along with bonus positions #6 and #5.

Fun fact about the host before we get started: pee pee poo poo.

See you at 3PM CST! Join [the plug.dj](https://www.plug.dj/popheads) room while you're at it, we'll be revealing every position there along with some fun shitposts to go along with it.

Please do not ask. If you do, I will get back in 3-5 business days and even that isn’t guaranteed. I will be worse than a job app you are overqualified for.

I only gave this a zero for the memes. I’m not actually sure why I even included this interlude, honestly. 

&nbsp; 

Fun fact, this song is actually replaced on the vinyl run of _IGOR_! The song that replaces it, "BOYFRIEND", can be found [here;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOlNhcdlcB4) and while it does take its place on the vinyl, the outro of the song is still the interlude that is found on the streaming versions of *IGOR*. Quite honestly, I think the song is just alright and that this was not needed for the narrative nor the overall greatness of the album, so I get why Tyler left it off. Still, a cute interlude that was doomed to be in last place since it is the only interlude in the entire rate.

---

**pat-rickstar** (4): Nice of Tyler to give us an obvious answer to the question "what should we eliminate first in this rate?"

---

#I get it. You guys are a bunch of comedians.

**CreepyMannequin** (10): yeah...

**cremeebrulee** (10): straight to the point i appreciate that

**laurent1683** (10): the perfect interlude

**Mysario** (10): 🤡

**rickikardashian** (10): yall rude as shit for making us rate this. but im giving it a 10 because it helps the flow of the album and i know it will receive a bunch of 1s

**steelstepladder** (10): He's spitting straight facts

**tomandother** (9): i really like this interlude

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Janet Jackson school of short and impactful interludes.

**Verdantshade** (8): I'm rating this as I would boyfriend (the full version of the song that replaces it on the physical edition), which imo is a really important song in the narrative of the album. the squeaky voice gets a bit annoying after a while though

**ReallyCreative** (7): this is weird because I can't see myself chasing my responsibilities tyler, kind of a clown moment for you

**TragicKingdom1** (7): when this places ahead of several brockhampton songs :heart_eyes:

**team\_kockroach** (6.7): This shouldn’t count. I think everyone else’s scores, averaged out, will be 6.7 - so I’m voting to make as little impact as possible.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): spill

#Fair enough.

**bbfan132** (5): giving this a neutral score since this isn’t really a song

**bigbigbee** (5): I do not know how to rate this. It works well as a transition, I guess.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this was super fucking eery because I have a friend that sounds just like that (voice, not words)

**kappyko** (5): on flower boy the interlude led into perhaps the centerpiece of the entire album. on igor it leads into like the seventh best song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): song

**seanderlust** (4.5): where's that tweet where the guy is like "damn i'm so scared of a billion dollars?"

**ManofOranges** (4): Well, this isn't even 20 seconds so I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to give it...

**RandomHypnotica** (4): it's cute, but it's just an interlude

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): well this is clearly going first but uh...great enunciation!

**Macadamic** (2): I don’t really care for this pseudo-deep interlude

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): why are we rating this? I don’t even know that this is particularly good advice.

**TiltControls** (1): There is no reason this should be above anything else.

#You guys fell for my trap. Getting rid of your zero so you can’t give it to an actual song. Muahahahaha.

**1998tweety** (0): yall know you didnt have to include this right

**akanewasright** (0): Frog... why are we rating this? It’s an important beat within the album, but like... it’s 12 seconds long. It doesn’t even scrobble on Last.fm. I’m giving it my 0 in protest of it being here.

**DaHumanTorch** (0): why was this included in the rate????

**hikkaru** (0): why is this included sob

**static\_int\_husp** (0): giving this a 0 out of principle of not thinking it's worth it to rate interludes

**stickywheels46** (0): If this ends up scoring higher than an actual song in the reveal, that's embarrassing.

#Drake has competition.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): great for insta captions

#This comment has perfect comedic timing now.

**waluigiest** (5): why they abbreviate this like this, we can’t act like swifties

Marriage? Unrealistic in this economy. 

&nbsp;

The production on this song is dope, but man I get tired listening to this song. It definitely has to do with the tracklist ordering for the back half of the album, which brings down the enjoyment of the album as a whole. Shit happens!

---

#Getting married.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I ascended during the last minute of the song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): those synths cured COVID-19

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I love Joba.

**bbfan132** (8): i thought this was nice, even if a bit filler-y

**laurent1683** (8): Worst song here, still a banger

**tomandother** (8): merlyn’s best verse

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.2): the “edgy rap boyband” thing pops on this track, I like it when they pay homage to that ‘90s boyband sound like they do with the chorus of this one

**ManofOranges** (7): Yet another track that started off strong for me, but didn't quite live up to what I envisioned it to be. But in terms of the songs on this album that start off strong and finish weak for me, this is actually one of the better ones.

#Needs a pre-nup.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.7): i feel like merlyn’s verse here could really be removed and nothing of value would be lost rip

**steelstepladder** (6): Decent but I always forget about this song when I listen to the album

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): everyone kinda does what they're best at but for some reason i can't quite figure out it is the most forgettable song in the album and the one i'm least likely to come back to

**1998tweety** (5.5): dont care for this except for the very end

**CrimsonROSET** (5): maybe i've grown spoiled with the last few tracks but yeah the flows are really basic until they aren't

#Getting divorced.

**kappyko** (4): bearface sounds good here

**Macadamic** (3): would’ve given this 1 point, but Merlyn convinced me otherwise

**team\_kockroach** (2.5): The production’s good, but the droning verses bring it down by so much. (Merlyn comes on and goes too far in the opposite direction, droning too much.) The songwriting is the worst on the album.

~~One time, a guy I was super into referred to himself as a big boy because he is a bear and it's stuck out in my head forever and I cannot look at this song title the same.~~

&nbsp;

Another slower song on the album, and while it does fit into the album quite frankly I dislike it as a whole. I'm not too mad about it being out early. 🤷🏼‍♂️

---

#big boi

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I love Joba.

**pat-rickstar** (10): This song is pretty moving honestly

**sirpancakeXI** (10): It is underrated

**tomandother** (10): this is a great song with a great joba verse and an incredible chorus (one of my favourite kevin hooks)

**cremeebrulee** (9): idk what the consensus on this song is but this is top half of the album for me personally

**stickywheels46** (9): I just found out that people hate this song? WTF.

**team\_kockroach** (8.8): The song should’ve stopped before Bearface’s verse.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.4): i think this album is when i finally started seeing the appeal of joba tbh

**bbfan132** (8): i didn’t even know that this song existed before this but it was good

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): in terms of rapping it's got some of the best verses but it does lack the catchiness that makes some of the other tracks so good

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i cant stop thinking about how the beat sounds like that one snoop dog song

#smol boi

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**steelstepladder** (6): Kinda moves too slow for me to really embrace it :/

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): some of these lines are just... I don't know but it's not great

**ManofOranges** (4): Don't really care for this one though. Skip!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): honestly this is probably one if my least favorite brockhampton songs idk why it sounds so awkward, those first few lines of the first verse are PAINFUL

**Macadamic** (1): boring, just boring

**kappyko** (0): wrote in rate channel that this wasnt bad but i guess i lied because this is quite unsavory. terrible hook

**seanderlust** (0): pull ups has ruined the phrase "i'm a big boy now" for me

#You use your brain, Ghost.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): how am I supposed to find something to say about this

Damn, I haven't experienced this much religion since grade school made me go to Church weekly.

&nbsp;

An extension of "IF YOU PRAY RIGHT" and a track featuring British rapper slowthai, I find the placement of this track quite odd. I think it would work better if it was either before or after "IF YOU PRAY RIGHT" on the tracklist, and would be more enjoyable for me as the album flows. Still, a pretty great rap by slowthai and it's great to hear him working with the band.

---

#British.

**team\_kockroach** (10): Slowthai killed it. Stream “Nothing Great About Britain”

**waluigiest** (10): at first I didn’t like this but I’ve decided it’s really funny actually

**tomandother** (9): my most relistened to on the album

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): More of an interlude than a full song, with slowthai delivering a sick verse over what's basically a preview of the IF YOU PRAY RIGHT beat. Kinda wish he was on the full song.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): roll credits

**sirpancakeXI** (8): Honestly surprise about his appearance

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): seeing slowthai perform this live was stressful ngl

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): king slowthai killed this

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.2): i love how slowthai is on two of the albums in this rate...his mind

**Verdantshade** (6): shoutout slowthai, if you haven't heard his music please check it out, he's easily the most exciting artist from the british rap scene

#American.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): cute but it’s like a interlude basically

**bbfan132** (6): hmm, it wasn’t bad but it was very short and didn’t do a lot for me

**ManofOranges** (6): The sound of a british accent in a rap song never fails to amuse me.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): "fuck god I'm a dog backwards" uhhhhh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is like eating a piece of plain popcorn, it’s not bad but there’s really no impact to it

**steelstepladder** (5): Shaggy remains unbothered

**kappyko** (4): break da law!!!! slowthai's a bit annoying here

**1998tweety** (1): dont really care for this

**Macadamic** (1): hope I don’t have to listen to this song in hell

How many parts are there to this conversation? I need to know. I’m impatient, why is there a tease for multiple parts.

&nbsp;

Honestly, not the biggest fan of this one! Really my least favorite on the album. It's overall less interesting, lyrically and sonically, to me than the super funky and fresh productions of the rest of the album. A shame, really, but they can't all be winners!

---

#Communication Majors

**Macadamic** (11): love this! LOVE THIS!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): amazing production

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Flying Lotus helped out on this song, and you can really tell from the dreamy, layered vibe. Great track.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): this is probably the most lyrical on the album, and a great transition towards the end

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this feels like a direct attack on me :/

**seanderlust** (7.8): "All you do is sit around the house, you gettin' faded" yeah mac, it's a pandemic and I have depression, and what bitch

**tomandother** (7.5): i find this song super fun

**bbfan132** (7): a lot of this kind of blends together but it’s all pretty good so i’m not totally complaining

#Speech Club Dropouts

**cvyspharmacy** (7): It's okay. honestly.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The themes of this song are so tired but there are some really snappy lines in this that elevate it a bit.

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why are these outros 50 seconds long mac we got more songs to listen to

**ManofOranges** (6): Also fine

**pat-rickstar** (5): Somehow I always forget what this sounds like immediately after listening… it's ok I guess

**steelstepladder** (4): Kinda wish the production was more memorable on this one tbh

**laurent1683** (0): I get it he's bored, but I can't stand this delivery and repetitive beat

#You really underestimate this sub.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This is a grower. Really hope it won't get eliminated on day 1 :/

The Church trying to convince me to become straight again when they found out I am gay.

&nbsp;

One of the longest songs in the rate itself, I understand why this song placed so low on the ranking. It’s basically four minutes of straight bars with a moody beat shift at the end to lead into "DEARLY DEPARTED" as a song, which is even moodier. Honestly, I really fucking dig it. The placement in the tracklisting is perfect for this song, and it’s such a fun song to bump while chilling with you friends.

---

#THIS IS GOOD 😇 CHRISTIAN ✝ SUBREDDIT

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): First-time listener to all this albums and this was the clear standout for me; the horn line and flow just hit perfectly for me

**1998tweety** (10): this is weird but that good kind of weird

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i think i'm on the minority here when i say i really fuck with religious themes in music, and this is a good example

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): On paper I should dislike this because it’s very traditional rap and that’s not my thing but damned if I’m not bopping my head along with that beat and that horn is so addictive! There’s a “dirty” vibe to the track and their lyrics are sharp, but then the outro (which again, I should hate but don’t) flips it on its head and just gives you a minute to vibe after the party. One of the highlights of the album for me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): the horns really get me here

**waluigiest** (9): okay the transition from st. Percy to this??? So clean.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I wish I liked the outro to this song more because the first section is peak Brockhampton for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): ugh the brass here is so good

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): What a funky trombone(euphonium? Idk). Dom’s verse was a little wack, though.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): One of the most BROCKHAMPTON-y songs on the album, with the horn being so pathetic it comes back around to being awesome and all the verses and Kevin's hook all working. This would be higher, but the outro doesn't really fit and feels like it goes on a little too long. Would've preferred getting the outro from the music video.

**tomandother** (8.5): also cool song

**steelstepladder** (8): That horn is so great but I feel like they cover similar territory in other songs better

**engifear** (7.8): I'm legally required to somewhat enjoy this song as a trombone player

#Agnostic

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): the first half alone would make me score higher tbh

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): this was a 10 until that god awful outro

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): classic case of just a little too much going on here but still fairly enjoyable

**bbfan132** (7): the first half was fine but sort of underwhelming - i liked the last two minutes though lol

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I love how interesting the production is here but I feel like everything else here is just mid. The back half of the song isn’t great either

#Atheist

**ReallyCreative** (6): avoid the Melodrama??? avoid Lorde??? FLOP!!! okay but what is actually going on here towards the end... it's hurting me and my eardrums

**RandomHypnotica** (5.3): the instrumental for this is absolutely awful, it sounds like a jam sesh from a group made up through random assignment in middle school band class

**cvyspharmacy** (5): it's eh /:

**ManofOranges** (5): I started off being really into this song but at some point I just felt like this song was going on way too long. I don't think it had to be 5 minutes, and honestly, given how many times this song switches up the tempo and the melody and all that, they probably could've made several better songs instead of one fine song.

**sirpancakeXI** (5): That outro feel out of place it is like two different songs merged together

**static\_int\_husp** (5): The outro to this doesn't jive with me right

**Macadamic** (2): this sounds dumb

**Mysario** (0): absolutely bin that musical fart

> The sun is shining, I can't look at the horizon

Mac, just put on some sunglasses.

&nbsp;

In a way, this is the happiest depressing song I've ever heard. Finally recovering from his emotional wounds, Mac is saying here that the future will be looking up for him and he’s feeling happy. Ironic, sadly. Nobody could have predicted that when we first heard the track. In a way, he did get his wings. Huh.

---

#Angels

**1998tweety** (8.5): like the ending

**cvyspharmacy** (8): I think it's sad when I think about it, but it's a really chill song that I don't really prefer. I feel like dying in it,, I won't lie.

**Macadamic** (8): so vulnerable, miss him so much

**steelstepladder** (8): When the chorus hits in its so good!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): :(

**bbfan132** (7): another chill song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): again, a pretty long outro with the song just kinda fizzling out

**ManofOranges** (7): I can dig this one.

**ReallyCreative** (7): I like this one but I'm not sure why

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): 🥺

#Devils

**sirpancakeXI** (7): Honestly not a big fan for those sound effects

**tomandother** (6): i find this quite boring :(

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): I sleep but the production is nice though. I like the strings

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Why does his accent on the verses make it sound like he’s about to try to sing “Coal Miner’s Daughter?” Do people from Pittsburg sound like this? I looked up a map and it’s above the Mason Dixon line. I don’t know why, it just hit me at this point in the album for some reason. Anyways the production on this track is really weird and largely unsuccessful.

**team\_kockroach** (5): The first real hiccup in the album. Its instrumental is too lowkey, and the rhyme scheme too basic, to feel finished.

Like church, this album ends with preaching. Neat.

&nbsp;

This track is interesting, as it's actually the first time Victor Roberts II has ever appeared on a track. He's new to the group, and really I hope he contributes to it more. The story here is depressing as hell, but one that's much needed and has to be heard. I'm glad that this is the closer, quite honestly. It fits the album theme wonderfully and stories like Victor's need to be heard.

---

#Loves Skate I

**laurent1683** (10): My respect for Victor is huge (he performed this live JUST as good). What a verse then it's finished by my two favourite white boys, bearface and Ryan Beatty

**tectec787** (10): Best song on the album and it ain't even a BROCKHAMPTON member. Almost got the 11.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this actually is my favorite outro to any of their projects, there’s a great backstory behind it and it’s honestly the best lyrics on the album

**waluigiest** (10): powerful song. The concept (title is rapper they are introducing) is very funny to me but it works extremely well

**team\_kockroach** (9.8): An amazing debut. The vocal recording quality is a little muddy, but that’s my only issue.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i dont know who victor is but shoutouts to him

**seanderlust** (9): i know, I know, one of my highest rated BH song doesn't even have a member as its main rapper. still, the story is compelling, the sung parts are gorgeous, and the energy of the overall track is perfect

**steelstepladder** (9): This is getting shafted but its good guys

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): dude is good at rapping and the outro just works.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Pretty unique final track in that the bulk of it is taken up by a person who is not in BROCKHAMPTON, but Victor's story is genuinely interesting and he's got talent as a rapper. Ryan Beatty's pitched repeated hook really adds a lot as well to close the album out nicely.

**tomandother** (9): a great album outro truly, very expressive verse and beautiful outro

**ReallyCreative** (8): I do love some of the vocal chords

**bbfan132** (7): interesting closer… the first half threw me off but the second half brought it back to a nice place

**bigbigbee** (7): The end melody is pretty (except the word “bitches” kind of sticks out as awkward when it’s sung so slowly and melodically).

#Hates Skate I

**1998tweety** (6): I feel bad dragging this but in terms of something I wanna listen to, this ain't it. Ending is nice though.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Man... I usually like bearface, and of course it's not a BH closer without him, but this track should have ended with the monologue ending.

**sirpancakeXI** (6): A rather disappointing closing track for this great album

**ManofOranges** (5): Well I can appreciate it but... that doesn't mean that I like it.

**stickywheels46** (5): Idk who this Victor guy is.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): i laughed out loud at how bad that opening line was

**kappyko** (3): the vocals of victor are muffled and bearface sounds awful here

**Macadamic** (1): over four minutes of getting nowhere. Wasted time.

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): god i hate this song. really the only stain on an otherwise great album

Another B-side for *IGOR*, this song just proves that Tyler is good at cutting the fluff off his albums. It's quite honestly a forgettable track, but still pretty fun. The production is nice to listen to, I'll give it that!

---

**cvyspharmacy** (10): I LOVE THE VIBE AND THAT CHILD VOICE AHAHHA. It's so goooooooooooood.

**laurent1683** (9): Super cute

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): honestly sounds like a reject recorded between flower boy and igor but it slaps

**bbfan132** (8): even his loose singles are great

First Christianity with all the saints, and now Buddhism? We love a multi-faith identity group.

Repeat it with me now: banger, banger, banger, *BANGER*! This song is probably my favorite off the album, as I love the vibes and everything about the track. It just fucking GOES without warning and does it well.

**seanderlust** (9.2): "she's so hot I let her touch my butt" #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch

#Taste

**waluigiest** (10): I gave this a 10 for Kevin’s verse it’s SO GOOD

**team\_kockroach** (9.1): Sounds like a cypher, and all verses smack, except for Kevin’s (which isn’t even that bad).

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Kind of a divisive song, but I can't hate this at all. It's stripped down, and not a good first single to sum up GINGER with, but it slaps so hard.

**bbfan132** (8): another bop from them, maybe not the most interesting track in the world but it’s still fun

**ManofOranges** (8): That's right!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): she so bad i let her touch my butt!

**pat-rickstar** (8): Kind of a banger

**sirpancakeXI** (8): Merlyn what the fuck

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): me when i practice reincarnation

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): lovely as well but it does kind of drag on and not go anywhere in the end

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**tomandother** (7.5): just a cool song

**bigbigbee** (7): It’s a little one note for my tastes. I love Merlyn’s verse, though - it has one of my favorite lines ever (“She’s so bad I let her touch my butt….MERLYN, WHAT THE FUCK!”)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the beat started out kinda weak, but we got somewhere

#Has COVID-19 (lack of taste symptom)

**akanewasright** (6): The mouth noises in the beginning...

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I like the production on this one but the lyrics and vocals kinda sink it

**Macadamic** (6): kind of like this one, but it’s not great

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Meh.

**steelstepladder** (5): A non essential listen tbh

**kappyko** (2): still might easily be the worst single these guys have ever done. like right from the moment they decided bearface should act hard in the intro they screwed up and it gets WORSE. the only thing that saves this is the outro

#This comment reminded me of the time I was on a Zoom lecture for my world religions class and some girl was discussing her opinion about Marie Kondo. In order to explain her opinion, she used an example which was “Instead of using Marie Kondo’s ‘does this spark joy’ method to clean out my grandma’s house, we just burnt it down instead.” Nobody brought it up a single time again. I think about her often.

**ReallyCreative** (4): it does not spark joy

This version of "It's A Small World After All" sounds different here.

&nbsp;

"Small Worlds" was the first track he released since *The Divine Feminine*, his breakup with Ariana, and his DUI crash. Alongside "Buttons" and "Programs", Mac is showcasing that he knows the bullshit he's been pulling is bad and he’s putting forth some effort to fix himself. Honestly, the song is depressing as fuck and really shows the pitfalls of fame and celebrity life really well. One of my favorites from the album, and it’s a shame you guys didn’t love it as much.

---

#I only have the most perfect timing in the world, thank you for asking.

**rickikardashian** (8): this blew up on tiktok right on time

#Short

**Macadamic** (10): he’s got a point here

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This song is a love at first sight

**tomandother** (10): i love this song A LOT and would give it a second 11 if i could, far and away the best instrumental on the album and mac’s best lyrical performance, really emotional and serene and the outro is incredible

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): very few artists can talk about celebrity suffering as well as Mac. heartbreaking stuff

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): The only of the 3 singles Mac had released in May to make the final album and also the best. This one is just a mature look at the struggles of fame that were driving Mac's life after his breakup with Ariana Grande and subsequent DUI. There's a dark edge to the song with current knowledge, but it's also incredibly chill, especially John Mayer's guitar licks.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): a little too long but definitely a highlight of the album

**seanderlust** (8.2): "Why you always at the mall when you're broke?" okay rude of mac to go back in time and assassinate 16 year old me

**bbfan132** (8): probably my favorite mellow track so far

**CrimsonROSET** (8): 'building up a wall 'til it break' is a very dark metaphor

**steelstepladder** (8): It really do be a small world

**waluigiest** (8): okay come thru outro!!!!

**engifear** (7.7): yeah

**1998tweety** (7.5): this was meh but the piano at the end kinda saved it

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): “why you always at the mall when you broke” ok mac just attack me like that i guess

#Tall and mean about it.

**ManofOranges** (6): This one is fine, although it's not a stellar standout like some other songs that this album has to offer.

**team\_kockroach** (4): His older flow, full of quirky pronunciation and drawls, is back. I don’t think he uses it well - but the repeated chorus is really the worst part of the song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This is kinda insufferable actually, I don’t want to speak ill of the dead but he really sounds like a tool in this song. I think there’s nothing wrong with simple, straightforward lyrics that just kind of state the message of the song plainly and clearly but this is just comes across as banal; there’s a difference between being “real” and just being boring. He’s reaching for depth that just isn’t there, which is unusual because he shows on a lot of the rest of the album that he can be much better than this. Also he just sounds bad. A big old dud but it gets points because I kinda like the structure of the chorus though.

**pat-rickstar** (0): I'm about to drag my album average way down with this one but… something about the intonation on this just rubs me the wrong way

**ReallyCreative** (0): this is one of the worst things I've ever heard, 9 times out of ten you get it wrong, that's why you wrote this song to make those other 8 fuck ups look better I guess

What are we, Spanish now? Which, I mean, I kind of am and I can read and write it decent enough, but that doesn’t excuse my question.

&nbsp;

One of the more mellow tracks on *Swimming*, this is not one of the tracks I find myself revisiting ever. It's quite boring overall, and the beat switch at the end just kind of elongates the track past what is needed.

---

#Bilingual

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is just so good ugh

**CrimsonROSET** (9): some of these lyrics really are really getting to me now knowing what happened

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): not my favorite off the album but it does serve as a great introduction to the centerpiece of it all

**tomandother** (8): this song really connects with me emotionally, it feels very successfully intimate and i love mac’s lyrics and the outro is beautiful

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): The chorus comes in one too many times, but it’s fine otherwise.

**bbfan132** (7): another relaxing song, i want a bit more than this though

**cvyspharmacy** (7): It's okay. On a Mac Miller scale, it deserves a 7. In a real world comparison, I think it gets a 7.5. But, I like it in general. I just expect better rip

**steelstepladder** (7): It's good but it kind of has a weak hook

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): a somewhat forgettable track but a solid one

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): love the instrumentation but it’s a bit boring to me

#Monolingual

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**akanewasright** (6.5): This is nice, but his vocals aren’t awesome

**Macadamic** (6): I like this song, but it kind of drags.

**ManofOranges** (6): It's not perfect, but I don't mind.

**sirpancakeXI** (6): I mean it is not a bad song in general but it is the worst track on swimming

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): ehh

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): these lyrics are stupid, and I know I’m not the only one who thinks so because this track has the second least views on Genius by a decent margin

I don’t know why we're naming off saints right now and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.

&nbsp;

That guitar, holy *fuuuuuck*! The production on this song is INSANE, and that delivery is *sinister* on Dom's behalf. A great crew cut on the album, but y'all were not a fan. A shame, a shame I tell you!

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Noooo don’t make music that sounds like this your so sexy aha

#Catholic Church when selling indulgences in the early 1500s: Okay, this song kinda bops.

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok wait this is a serve

**sirpancakeXI** (10): On my initial listen I thought it was unlistenable but it really grown on me a lot. Matt's verse is honestly a highlight in the album.

**seanderlust** (9.5): okay, was anyone going to tell me that there's a video of kevin abstract participating in a rap battle in a middle school bathroom or was I just supposed to read that on a genius annotation myself?

**1998tweety** (9): production on this kinda ate

**bbfan132** (9): this was a serve, enjoyed the production and all of their parts a lot

**team\_kockroach** (8.7): The outro was crazy, and so was the beat.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): really like the production and everything happening in the background on this one

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Another simple but effective beat, even though it's basically just other beats on GINGER blended together. My favorite part is honestly the sample flip on the hook.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): bearface’s verse here slaps tbh

**cremeebrulee** (8): the outro >>>

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): tbh this was my favorite snippet but not my fave on the album

**tomandother** (8): cool song

**steelstepladder** (7): Kinda filler but still bops

#Martin Luther to the Catholic Church: Your song does not actually bop.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): things already got ugly

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): This is kinda just noisy to me

**Macadamic** (5): it’s ok

**pat-rickstar** (5): First song on this album I'm not really feeling

The eczema line… king of respecting skin diseases.

&nbsp;

One of the great things about *IGOR*, as an album, is that it follows the typical storytelling chart extremely well and is fairly easy to plot out. To me, this feels like the climax of the project. Finally admitting that his ex lover is behind him, Tyler is able to move on and look forward to becoming a better person. It really is such an admiral point to finally get to and one many of us need to get to in our lives.

#Fell out of love

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): easily the most underrated song on this album. i feel like nobody cares for it but it's so good??

**tomandother** (10): i like how dark this is while still maintaining the album’s pop sensibilities, it a very pretty song

**laurent1683** (9): A huge grower, i disliked it a lot at first

**sirpancakeXI** (9): Me saying this to me imaginary boyfriend

**steelstepladder** (9): idontloveyouanyMORE

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): More of an understated track, but necessary in between two huge anthems. Some more gorgeously layered vocals from Solange and Charlie Wilson.

**1998tweety** (8): shes a chill bop

**ManofOranges** (8): I'm not entirely fond of the oddly pitched voice that repeats throughout the song, but it's kind of intriguing to me in some kind of way. The same goes for the rest of the song for me too. At the very least, it's really interesting to me.

**bbfan132** (7): honestly didn’t realize that this was another song but i still enjoyed it

**kappyko** (7): bop but i hate the vocal sample here

**seanderlust** (7): the high pitched voice on the chorus sounds like the gingerbread man from shrek to me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): title is a mood tbh

#Still in love

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): This is my least favourite on the album, excluding the 15 second one, and despite that it's not even that bad

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): that happened I guess

**Macadamic** (6): love the energy

**Verdantshade** (6): squeaky voice returns

**CrimsonROSET** (4): the mix on this one was... odd
