###Intro

Have you ever wondered what [this fit](https://i.imgur.com/Q5mCX7l.jpg) sounds like as hip-hop / rap music? The answer would probably be these three albums.

Welcome to the **POLLEN Rate!** Aptly named after the [Spotify playlist of the same name](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWBHeXOYZf74?si=kTcriOsoRTSb5toMxveLSA), we will be rating three genre-bending indie rap albums from three influential artists in the indie rap genre: Tyler, The Creator's _IGOR_, BROCKHAMPTON's _GINGER_, and the late Mac Miller's _Swimming_. Centered around the genre of hip-hop / rap yet aiming to be genre-less albums, the albums we are rating this month work better as pieces of art rather than a collection of songs.

If you know how rates work, **the submission link is at the bottom of the post.** If you do not know how to do rates, however, read on to the end! Here are the albums you will be rating:

###Tyler, The Creator â€“ _IGOR_

On his fifth studio album, Tyler, The Creator is found in the depths of a love triangle as his unnamed male lover is discovered to be seeing another female lover. As Tyler tries to figure his way through the emotional turmoil that comes with this discovery, listeners are met with his inner narrator: Igor. Voiced by American comedian Jerrod Carmichael and first appearing on the fourth track "EXACTLY WHAT YOU RUN FROMâ€¦", Igor pops in throughout the album to help bring out what goes on in Tyler's head as he goes through this emotional journey.

_IGOR_ was met with widespread critical acclaim, being noted as Tyler's best work to date by multiple music publications. Following its release, _IGOR_ became Tyler's most successful album to date and his first album to win him a Grammy (Best Rap Album, 2020).

###BROCKHAMPTON â€“ _GINGER_

For rap's only self-proclaimed boy band's fifth studio album, BROCKHAMPTON lets their hearts out on their multi-genre album _GINGER_. Recorded over four months during what Kevin Abstract, the group's unofficially-official frontman, calls a "lack of creativity for [his] solo album" on Zane Lowe's Apple Music 1 radio show, BROCKHAMPTON is found in the midst of an identity crisis. Not living together anymore, holding a bigger social profile, and having higher expectations than ever, the group focuses on refinding their footing and trying to remain tight-knit as the project becomes bigger than they ever anticipated. "We all want the same thing out of this at the end of the day," Kevin Abstract tells Lowe on their Apple Music 1 interview before the album's release. "No matter what it is we're doing, we put our heart and soul into it."

_GINGER_ was met with generally positive and favorable reviews, being hailed as "their most complete effort to date" by AllMusic's Neil Yeung. It produced the band's only US Hot 100 hit, "SUGAR", peaking at #66 in March 2020.

###Mac Miller â€“ _Swimming_

On his fifth studio album, Mac Miller battles the pitfalls of fame and his demons. _Swimming_ acts as a continuation of Miller's fourth studio album _The Divine Feminine_ and the first half of a double album, the second of which became the posthumous _Circles_. It's not quite a breakup album, yet not quite a makeup album; rather, Miller wants it to be viewed as a 'complete picture of his life.' "I'm just talking about things that I'm proud of myself for, things I'm afraid of, or things that are just thoughts and emotions," he told Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1. A reflection of the state of mind for an artist gone too soon, _Swimming_ is a direct reminder of the humanity of everyone, no matter what they are going through.

_Swimming_ was met with generally positive and favorable reviews, being called Mac Miller's "most impactful album of his career" by Rolling Stone's Mosi Reeves. Following Miller's death in September 2018, the album produced his highest-charting song as a lead artist, with Self Care peaking at #33, and became his first Grammy nomination (Best Rap Album, 2019).

###Bonus Rate

Alongside the regular rate, we will be rating six bonus songs! This includes the following:

-	[Tyler, The Creator â€“ "GROUP B"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVj6lW3V7Q0)
-	[Tyler, The Creator â€“ "BEST INTEREST"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMTKGM-efw)
-	[Kevin Abstract â€“ "Baby Boy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UPJGFT1HuI)
-	[BROCKHAMPTON â€“ "Sugar - Dua Lipa Remix"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tbNVkIlNYo)

-	[Mac Miller â€“ "Programs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvm5GuDfAas)

This rate is completely optional, but highly recommended. Rate however many of the songs you please, and give them a score between one (1) and ten (10)! Comments on this section are highly encouraged if you participate. It becomes more fun that way.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use your zero (0) or eleven (11) in the bonus rate.

---

###Rules

These are definitely not copy / pasted from the mens rate and are clearly originally written with this rate in mind:

-	Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). Please. I beg of you.
-	You have to rate every single song in the main rate. If you skip any and do not give us a score when we ask you for one, your ballot will not be counted. This is because the program used to determine the results will break if scores are not successfully put in and I will cry if the program breaks because it will be a pain in the ass to do this manually.
-	You may give **one song a zero (0)** and **one song an eleven (11)**. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track.
-	Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! That is the only form of ballot I will accept. I spent a lot of time and effort on it, so do not be afraid to use it.
  - Note: if youâ€™re trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; I have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, so you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!
-	If you desire to change any of the scores after you have already submitted them, simply message me and I will be glad to help! My life is boring anyways.
-	If we believe your scores include any form of sabotage, we reserve the right to ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. Sabotage will be defined as extremely low album average(s) that show a clear bias against one (or more) artist(s) in the rate. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, we strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)
-	Your scores should not be considered confidential! Donâ€™t be scared to share them. Go nuts. Campaign for whatever song you gave an eleven to. Or not. It really is not that deep.

###Commenting Guideline

It is also highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heartâ€™s desire, like this:

>	EARFQUAKE: 10 What I cause when I shake my fat ass anime booty. ðŸ¥µ

Any format other than this is NOT good and you will deeply hurt me if you do not follow the example given here. This includes:

>	BOY BYE: 10: Me when I find out the guy I am talking to is not practicing social distancing guidelines.

>	I THINK: this song is a 10!

>	2009: I will give this song a 9 because â€˜09. Hahaha. I am funny.

>	IF YOU PRAY RIGHT: 10 - The Church trying to convince me to become straight again when they found out I am gay.

>	WHATâ€™S GOOD: (10) I love the energy here!

You can also add comments to albums! In order to do this, simply put a colon (:) after the album title. Like so:

>	Album: Swimming: I liked this album the most because the tracklist is not yelling at me, like the other two.

On a personal note, I'm excited to be hosting this rate for y'all! I adore all three of these albums and really think you guys will too. See you in December for the rate reveal, and don't be afraid to hit me up with any questions if you have any. :)
