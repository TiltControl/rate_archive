pls it'll be entertaining

&nbsp;

Hello, and welcome to the Pollen rate reveal, day one! My name is frog, and I have had the pleasure to host this rate the past month and realize how much you guys fucking hated BROCKHAMPTON, holy fucking goddamn shit! Some quick facts before we get started:

- There were 58 participants in this rate! [You can see them here.](https://pastebin.com/5JFYKbVX)
- The average score amongst all songs is 7.754. Impressive!
- The average controversy score is 1.684. That means anything above it should be considered controversial, and anything below it should be considered agreed upon.

Today we will be revealing #24-13, along with bonus positions #4 and #3.

Fun fact about the host before we get started: I forgot a fun fact for the post yesterday and did not realize I left my filler fact, 'pee pee poo poo', until I was writing up the post for today.

See you at 1PM CST! Join [the plug.dj](https://www.plug.dj/popheads) room while you're at it, we'll be revealing every position there along with some fun shitposts to go along with it.

&nbsp;

Another hard track to listen to on this album, this one feels directly addressed to Ariana. Reminiscing on the times they had together, getting high and being care-free. It's a beautifully rough listen and one of my favorites from the album, sonically. The production on it is really smooth and crisp and seems extremely heartfelt. Perfect for my "crying rn" playlist.

---

#lmfao

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.8): how many comments are gonna mention ariana

**Macadamic** (10): so emotional, makes me want to root for them again...

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is a good companion piece to pov in my opinion

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Probably the most explicit breakup track on Swimming, a solemn look back on his relationship with Ariana. Another one that's heartbreaking given what would happen. You have to wonder what would've happened.

**pat-rickstar** (7): I'm wondering if this album inspired some of Ari's later stuff, specifically the strings used throughout

#Confused

**braydentv** (10): Spotify sessions version is my favourite mac song ever

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is legitimately one of the saddest rap songs I‚Äôve ever heard... even before he passed I listened to this on repeat to get through a breakup and it just hits different

**TiltControls** (10): Probably my favourite on the album

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): man

**cvyspharmacy** (8): I feel dreamy, and I really like that. the background vocalish noises are really dream-like

**ManofOranges** (8): The "let's get lost inside the clouds" part of this song is kind of ethereal to me, interestingly enough it actually gives me a sense of getting lost in the clouds.

**ReallyCreative** (8): I think this should be the ending track of the album, but it's not, so there you go

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): Maybe I‚Äôm too gay and straight laced to appreciate this song about having a vaguely toxic relationship with a woman and drugs, but I actually appreciate his vulnerability here and the overall sound of the track is pretty. If the lyrics were tightened up a bit this would be a ten.

**bbfan132** (7.5): don‚Äôt have much to say lol - another mellow track

**1998tweety** (7): the ending is great

#Has an answer

**sirpancakeXI** (7): I dunno how to feel about this track but it is not bad

**tomandother** (7): quite pretty and dreamy i like the atmosphere

**steelstepladder** (6): Issa vibe but kinda fades into the background

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): This is offensively boring...

...doesn't melt steel beams.

&nbsp;

Basically a metaphor for getting drunk and high and staying there as long as he can, Mac really goes deep in it with "Jet Fuel". Sonically, this one doesn't stand out to me too much compared to the rest of the album. Lyrically relatively uninteresting to me, too, compared to the rest of the tracks present. But shit happens. Everyone else seemed to have felt the same way about this song, so at least I‚Äôm not alone.

---

#Total drinks: 2 (including me)

**seanderlust** (9.5): drink every time someone mentions steel beams in the comments

**CrimsonROSET** (8): cant melt steel beams or something idk

#Fueled up

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): an incredible experience... that outro? come on

**waluigiest** (10): honestly this is a whole experience and it works

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Idk what I like about this but I do like it, the outro is also excellent.

**Macadamic** (9): absolutely love this song, but the Imogen style outro does do nothing for me

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): That outro could be better but overall a good song

**tomandother** (8.5): one of the better songs to me, love the beat a lot and mac‚Äôs flow is nicer than most of the others

**bbfan132** (8): i saw people calling this boring but this is probably one of my favorites :S i like the chorus and production

**bigbigbee** (8): Kind of weird, but it‚Äôs catchy. Even without the context of Mac Miller‚Äôs passing, there‚Äôs something achingly sad about the sentiment ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here longer than I expected to be‚Äù.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): the back half of this album is so good it‚Äôs not even funny

**1998tweety** (7.5): why are all the endings to his songs serves

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the beginning made me think of that song that was Hawaiian from hsm2 and I don‚Äôt know how to feel. But the rest of the song is good

#Running out of gas

**cvyspharmacy** (7): It's okay.

**kappyko** (6): kind of a mess near the end

**ManofOranges** (5): You know what, maybe my attention span is really just dying a slow and painful death, but here's yet another song that fails to keep my intruige for the whole duration of the song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I‚Äôm sorry, these lyrics are stupid and his delivery is bad. ‚ÄúCome down when I run out of jet fuel / and I never run out of jet fuel‚Äù ~~this is why we have co-writers~~ there are five co-writers credited and none of them could come up with something better?

**steelstepladder** (3): Probably my least favorite song in the rate unfortunately. I love all these albums though so it's only getting a 3

Plane trips have never been so depressing.

&nbsp;

One of those songs that's almost *too* on the nose, but it's for that reason that it's such a good track. Dom's verse at the end is rough, angry, and overall a needed catharsis for the group as a whole after kicking Ameer out of the group. I think the most important line in the song has to be this:

> I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time

As much as it applies to the group here, I really think it's important to remember this in life. Whether it's with friends or family or even the media you consume, just because you have a connection with them does not mean you need to ignore the truth.

---

**stickywheels46** (9): The boys hurting on this one frfr.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is vaguely related to the song but I had a coworker during college who went to elementary/middle school (I think?) with one of these guys and so now whenever I hear them sing about hard hitting topics like this all I can think about is like, a little white child singing in an auditorium and it just takes the air out of the sails. Hope she‚Äôs doing well.

---

#Serving taste

**CrimsonROSET** (11): no yeah this is fucking beautiful

**laurent1683** (11): and people have the nerve to say they miss the SATURATION era...

**steelstepladder** (11): The end of the third verse is one of my favorite musical moments of the last decade

**team\_kockroach** (11): Sonic whiplash from ‚ÄúIf You Pray Right‚Äù. Holy fuck, though. Deserves to be top 3.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I wanna hug Dom.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): that completely random "SEASHELLS" at the end of the first verse had me dying. Otherwise though, this track was really powerful, the raw emotion in this song is so palpable, definitely a highlight

**skargardin** (10): WHY WHY WHYYYYY

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): honestly dom‚Äôs verse on this is better at explaining the situation better than all of iridescence

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Probably the most deeply personal song on GINGER, a direct confrontation of the fallout of the Ameer Vann drama (amongst other things) that's played dead serious. It works, especially with the almost psychedelic soul production. Everyone on the song brings it, but Matt's verse is probably my favorite. He's got the perfect tone for this song, all over the place but trying so hard to keep it together. Classic.

**tomandother** (10): the most emotional point on the album and dom‚Äôs final verse is one of the more striking verses i‚Äôve ever heard i have never listened to it and not gotten goosebumps

**1998tweety** (9): i like this

**bbfan132** (9): was not expecting a psychedelic song from them but it works

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): dom SNAPPED. also obligatory fuck ameer

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This song is hard for me to score. I can‚Äôt say I listen to it often, but when I was really FOCUSING on it for this rate, I came to appreciate how emotional it is, and how important it seems like it was to them. Dom‚Äôs final verse is heartbreaking.

**engifear** (8.2): This is a clear high point on the album. Too bad it doesn't really save the rest of the album

**seanderlust** (8): WHEW the last verse....the library is open

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i always loved their slower songs and while i do love this too, it does not hit as hard as their saturation era ballads, the last verse is really good though

#:(

**sirpancakeXI** (7): I appreciate the message behind this song but the song itself doesn't sound that good

**Verdantshade** (7): this is such a rough song to listen to... dom's verse at the end

**ReallyCreative** (6): this is okay but dear god what the fuck is that note he's trying to hit, get down from there before you hurt yourself

**ManofOranges** (4): This song also feels like it's moving in slow motion to me.

**kappyko** (3): dom is emotive and interesting as usual but god is this a bore to get through. it feels like studio energy wasted on someone who doesn't deserve it

**Macadamic** (0): this must be the worst song on the album. Think it‚Äôs pretty cringe.

This is me every finals season, but especially this year. God, I fucking hate being in college during COVID-19.

&nbsp;

While this is probably my least favorite track on the album, I still enjoy the song quite a bit! It‚Äôs the only song that I have nothing to say for, so this is probably my shortest Tyler comment. Huh.

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): hahahahahahaha how the fuck is love sickness real hahahaha just walk away from the relationship like close your eyes

---

#Too many.

**kappyko** (9): how many ‚Äúomg tyler dont take your mask off corona!!!‚Äù comments is this gonna get

**engifear** (8.2): No, Tyler! You can't just ask people to take off their mask during a pandemic!

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Why is he telling people to take their masks off in a pandemic smh (I'm sure this will be a very unoriginal comment, sorry I'm just not funny)

#Time: Out.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): That ‚ÄúRUNNING OUT OF TIME‚Äù refrain is always the first thing that jumps to mind when I think about this album. I actually kinda think that this is the most straightforwardly ‚Äúpop‚Äù that the album gets, if this were just tweaked a bit and made less grimy it could easily fit onto a Drake album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): it does fit so perfectly in the album, but individually it may be the song that stands out the least (for me personally please don't kill me thanks)

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Kind of a transitional song on the album, but not in a bad way. I love the processed guitars and layered background vocals.

**bbfan132** (8): a bit underwhelming in comparison to the previous tracks but it‚Äôs still good

**ManofOranges** (8): Really like the production in this one

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): the last 40 seconds of this >>>

**tomandother** (8): good song i like it a little less than the other songs

#Time: In.

**steelstepladder** (7): Groovy but I don't see me going back to this individual track that much

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**CrimsonROSET** (6): it just... ends so suddenly, after so much repetition i expected something to actually build?

**sirpancakeXI** (6): It is mediocre

**ReallyCreative** (5): it just kinda shows up and leaves

#Frank stans really starved this year, I swear.

**Verdantshade** (8): remember when frank was rumoured to have vocals on this? crazy that he was supposed to drop an album this year but we only got 2 songs (not to mention the vinyl fiasco)... as for this song, I liked it a lot at first but it doesn't have the same replayability as the rest of the album

**Macadamic** (7): really like this, sounds like a Frank Ocean song

What does everybody think about ginger ale? I think it's great. Probably a top three soda of all time.

&nbsp;

Production is dope, but I get super bored listening to this track if I'm being quite honest. The back half of the album, besides "VICTOR ROBERTS", is a lot slower than I would have liked for it to end but that's not to say it's bad! It's a very well done end to the album and fits thematically. I just don't ever plan on revisiting it.

**bigbigbee** (11): Yeah, I can‚Äôt explain the 11 either. I just love the melodic production ‚Äì it reminds me of a few songs I heard around late Y2K that I loved (e.g. Here In Your Arms). It‚Äôs just really really pretty‚Ä¶..

**1998tweety** (10): the vocoder kinda ate here, BOP

**cvyspharmacy** (10): why dis so boppy for. i love those BEATS

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A song without Joba getting a 10? It's more likely than you'd think.

**skargardin** (10): brb crying

**stickywheels46** (10): This track coulda absolutely banged on the charts in like summer 2011.

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): Kevin‚Äôs a great singer, and I just want to melt into this song.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i think this'd grow on me even more if i had more time with it

**ManofOranges** (9): This is a really soothing one, I like it.

**sirpancakeXI** (9): A great title track

**tomandother** (9): this song has a really unique atmosphere , it captures very specific feelings for me

**Verdantshade** (9): the biggest grower on the album for me, it gives me saturation 1 vibes

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): great song but why is this the name of the album lmao

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is so good!! and i never see any discussion on it

**seanderlust** (8): coco peru voice too much ginger, honey! less ginger next time! but actually, this is fine

**bbfan132** (7): pleasant song to listen to but it‚Äôs a bit all over the place

**kappyko** (7): great chorus on this one

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): still mad they didn‚Äôt perform this song on the GINGER TOUR

#Hates spices. Possibly white.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.7): one of the weaker songs on this album but still good

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): A YouTube video started autoplaying while I was in the middle of listening to this and I went ‚Äúoh thank god something interesting is happening in the song‚Äù before realizing what was happening.

**Macadamic** (3): I like the beat

**waluigiest** (3): lyrics are nothing special, the sound kind of just blends together

**ignitethephoenix** (0): ehh don‚Äôt like the vocal effects being over used here. It just doesn‚Äôt work and it just oddly standouts compared to the rest of there album

So it goes, so it goes, so it goes.

&nbsp;

This is a hefty ending to the album. This song was on the last Instagram story Mac Miller posted before he passed away, and even was [the subject of his last tweet.](https://images.genius.com/6d3940b0f0921f65dd031c9cb6bc54cd.563x1000x1.jpg) Lyrically, this song is kind of a genius one. Referencing *Slaughterhouse Five*, the phrase "so it goes" becomes one about fame and the pitfalls of its repetitive, jaded nature, and sadly takes on similar meaning to the novel after his death. The second verse too‚Ä¶ haunting. Rest in peace, Mac. Hope things are kicking back well wherever you are.

---

#It goes.

**tectec787** (11): This song is beautiful and sad, but also happy kinda, but not really happy tho. I love it.

**bbfan132** (10): the album was a bit disappointing in general but damn if this isn‚Äôt an awesome closer‚Ä¶ love the synths at the end

**bigbigbee** (10): This such an amazing way to close the album ‚Äì I love strings, and the end melody is hopeful, peaceful, and beautiful. (It‚Äôs very similar to the ending of Daylight by Taylor Swift ‚Äì same key, even! ‚Äì which is also a great album closer.)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): that last outro is what i wanted all other outros to be, thank you mac

**Macadamic** (10): this is how you end an album. Feel like I‚Äôm getting ascended to heaven.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Those echo tho

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This, more than any other song on the album, gives me chills in the aftermath of Mac's death. The last song on the last album he released (when he was alive), as well as the song he had playing in Instagram stories posted hours before his death. It's an introspective, melancholic, bittersweet end to the album with an absolutely gorgeous final synth solo by Jon Brion, one Mac would describe as the "ascension into heaven." Wherever he is, I hope he's happy. RIP Mac.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): The outro is beautiful

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): :(((

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): i miss him

**seanderlust** (8.3): the nods to circles! clever

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The instrumental reminds me of Nightcall a little... For some reason. I actually lowered the score for this the moment I heard "her pussy gets wetter when it's Heartbreak Weather" or whatever that lyric was...

**steelstepladder** (8): solid ender

**1998tweety** (7.5): ending saved this [3]

#Stays still.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is very wavy and spacey but kinda a strange choice for a closing track? Like it‚Äôs pleasant but it doesn‚Äôt leave much of an impact beyond the synths at the end, which are admittedly pretty nice.

**ManofOranges** (7): It's a pretty alright closer.

**ReallyCreative** (6): the ending synths are cool but everything else about this one is very forgettable

**tomandother** (5): i don‚Äôt really like this song i don‚Äôt think it does the album justice as an outro and i dislike mac‚Äôs delivery :(

#Do NOT-

**waluigiest** (10): do I make a Taylor Swift or Kurt Vonnegut joke

Listening to Whitney? A man of TASTE, I see.

&nbsp;

Oof, that synth is *funky*. One thing that is always consistent about Mac Miller albums is the production being silky smooth and fresh, and *Swimming* is absolutely no exception. That vocal deepener in the chorus, too, goddamn he really nails it. While this isn't one of the tracks I revisit on the album a lot, it is always one that sticks out in my head because of the production. Something I can always count on with Mac songs.

---

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): good title to describe this whole rate tbh

#Feelings: Hurt.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of the first songs I heard from this albums and I really liked it (and I still do but I have other songs I like more now)

**Macadamic** (10): thought about giving this my eleven. This too good!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this beat is so good

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Forever grateful that this song introduced me to Mac's discography

**cvyspharmacy** (9): The beats and the sound. I miss his yeah yeah yeah's ): It's such an integral part of his music hahaha. It's between rap and sing, and I like how it sounds a lot more than IGOR and Ginger.

**ManofOranges** (9): Pretty cool

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): One of the more straightforward "classic" Mac songs on Swimming, but it has that nice sheen of refinement. Also credit to J. Cole for one of his best beats.

**akanewasright** (8): I really like the beat

**steelstepladder** (8): Wish the beat was a lil stronger but it's still good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): this is the best mashup of old and new mac on this album, gives me watching movies vibes

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

#I don't know what it's like to feel.

**bbfan132** (7): nice song, nothing special though

**tomandother** (7): this song is cool but again it has significantly lost impact for me since first listen and it does bore me a little nowadays

**CrimsonROSET** (6): maybe its me but this never really went anywhere

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): His vocal delivery is really weird here? Like I know that‚Äôs just kinda what he sounds like but it really sounds like he‚Äôs only singing out of the corner of his mouth on the chorus of this one. The lyrics are solid though.

**seanderlust** (6): this is the part of the pollen playlist that I zone out during

Yes king, come through with that lofi anime beats to relax and study to intro!! 

On the real, though, this is honestly one of the most interesting productions to me because not many mainstream rappers take hold of this lofi sound and actually flow well on it! What a fun loosie.

I appreciate that this goes hard, he did not need to snap like that! It's a fun rap banger with a fresh Mac Miller twist. Really one of my favorites in the bonus tracks.

Snape. Snape. Serverous Snape.

&nbsp;

Another track with a hidden feature, this time it's Kanye West. Personally, I feel like this feature fits SUPER well into the track and I love the addition it has to the album overall. And while it may be one of the slower moments on the album, it still keeps the overall shine the other songs carry. Go Tyler!

---

**seanderlust** (7.5): first time through: haha financial freedom! a hug! relatable. second time, when I realize that he is portraying desperation getting a guy back willing to do anything: oh :(

---

#Is being controlled, like a puppet.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): kanye kanye what's good

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): The first minute of this song is one of my favorite parts of IGOR. Tyler's flow is all over the place but still works so well at conveying his emotional state on this part of the album. The rest of the song is great too, with some great vocal harmonies on the chorus and Kanye dropping in for a verse so unintelligible it might as well be part of the beat. It's no SMUCKERS 2, but that's okay.

**bbfan132** (9): a nice cool-down song after the run before it

**cremeebrulee** (9): uhm mood

**kappyko** (9): the outro good fucking gracious

**steelstepladder** (9): Most underrated song on the album?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): best thing kanye has done in years

**tomandother** (9): cool ye fearure!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i liked the switch up that happened with the lalalas! that's about it, but like, the rest wasnt bad.

**laurent1683** (8): this recorded-on-a-PS4-headset mumbling Kanye verse low in the mix wasn't it, but still a good song

**stickywheels46** (8): Kanye's best verse of the past two years because he wasn't actually saying anything.

**Verdantshade** (8): the production on kanye's verse is worse than nav's on yosemite

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): yeah i do need a hug actually, thanks for asking omg

**Macadamic** (7): love the Kanye feature

**1998tweety** (6.5): like the ending

#Above the government.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I skip this more often than not. It's kinda plain until the second half.

**ManofOranges** (6): It's a nice track but for me it just kind of falls by the wayside whenever I listen to this album. Also I listened to this track a solid 3 times through before realizing that Kanye is on here, for some reason his verse just fails to have an impact I think.

**sirpancakeXI** (5): I don't really like kanye's verse :/

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I usually like songs about puppets/toys, like usually if a song has something like that in the title I‚Äôll end up liking this, but this is pretty forgettable.

Me when I find out the guy I am talking to is not practicing social distancing guidelines.

&nbsp;

LOVE me a good classic rap vibe moment! "BOY BYE" has that boppy, infectious beat and fun as hell sample to it, but couldn't climb high enough for my own liking, most of the rate. Oh well, we can mark this as another time the sub was tasteless!

#Finally, some interesting art assessment on this fucking subreddit. As the son of an art historian,

**waluigiest** (9): this is baroque

#You say goodbye,

**bbfan132** (10): :avatwerk:

**bigbigbee** (10): Please watch the MV, it‚Äôs one of my favorite ever. In fact, I had to stop writing this comment to go watch it. Also the song is so much fun! An 11 contender.

**cremeebrulee** (10): a BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): ugh what a bop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): idk what that instrument doing the arpeggio is, but it's SUPER catchy. Also that regina george line was unexpected but solid

**sirpancakeXI** (10): An absolute banger

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song packs so much into less than 2 and a half minutes, its insane. The beat sounds like psychedelic lounge circus rap, and everyone delivers over it anyway. Kevin's verse, with its speedy flow, is my favorite, but gotta give love to Joba's reverb-heavy falsetto outro too.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): BOY BOP

**seanderlust** (9): this one is fun! a bop

**steelstepladder** (9): Not sure what instrument is doing that ascending and descending riff but it slaps

**tomandother** (9): joba outro is good

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.8): Love those skittering strings that filter throughout the track and the sound of their voices here.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): with each ‚Äúboy bye‚Äù i expected ‚ÄúBoy toy named troy used to live in detroit‚Äù

**CrimsonROSET** (8): highlight for this one is probably 'characters shaped like an arc'

**ManofOranges** (8): It's got an interesting sound to it. Not exactly the biggest fan of it but I could see myself listening to this again several times just so I could try and get a better grasp on what's going on.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Beyonce did it better I'm afraid

**1998tweety** (7.5): its good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this really should‚Äôve been a popheads hit based on the title alone

#and I say hello. Hello, hello!

**Macadamic** (5): I don‚Äôt hate this, the production is fun

**sandyfishnets** (5): I love this beat but it gets too repetitive after a while. Also their vocals are too quiet on this song.

**\*THX intro noise***

&nbsp;

One of the great album intros of the 2010s, *IGOR* opens up with this amazing track featuring a great performance by Lil Uzi Vert. The synth featured throughout the track is *nasty* and a huge earworm, absolutely getting stuck in my head for days on end. Amazing, amazing start to a wonderful album.

#\*ears blasted out by the THX intro\*

**bbfan132** (10): holy fuck this intro is perfect

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The perfect intro.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love this intro a lot

**pat-rickstar** (10): This is great. It feels so cinematic and sets up the album super well

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): cue THX tik tok meme

**Verdantshade** (10): a fantastic opener, making full use of its limited vocals and lofi instrumentation. foreword (with its can sample) really set the bar for intros, and this just about matches it

**Mysario** (9.5): this does a perfect job as an intro to both this rate and to the album

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): very few openers can get you as excited for an album as this one

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): Fittingly enough, this was the first snippet of IGOR heard during the album cycle. Beginning with some menacing ass synths and finishing with a great little solo, IGOR'S THEME is mostly an instrumental intro. Still, it sets up the rest of the album soooo well, the song just SOUNDS like IGOR. Shout out to Uzi too, who I wouldn't have recognized if I didn't know it was him.

**ReallyCreative** (9): a pretty solid way to start off an album

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Just a whole vibe. Really sets the stage for the sound of the album so well.

**steelstepladder** (9): Probably not going too far because it's just an intro but it's a great god damn intro

**stickywheels46** (9): This intro is more iconic than Jaden Smith.

**tomandother** (9): this song is incredibly effective in establishing the album‚Äôs tone and atmosphere and is incredibly relistenable and well produced

**team\_kockroach** (8.4): A great sample of the production on this album.

**ManofOranges** (8): Pretty good opener, methinks

#Did not experience the pain of the THX intro

**sirpancakeXI** (8): Not a bad intro

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe just rating these as I wake up wasn't the best idea on my end

**Macadamic** (7): it‚Äôs pretty exciting intro

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): nice introduction to the album

**DaHumanTorch** (6): cute intro, loved the production

**1998tweety** (4): nonevent

I can be your angle‚Ä¶ or yuor devil

&nbsp;

A pretty beautiful intro to the album, if I'm being quite honest, and a great statement on the fact that this will be a pretty depressing album lyrically. The constant repeating of "I'm sure I'll find it" really gets to me, personally: that feeling of having that goal in sight, but never being able to grasp it or get to and not being sure how to react is definitely a relatable one, for sure. It almost made it to day three, but I'm glad it at least did better than *most* of the other songs in the album.

#üòà

**bbfan132** (11): i couldn‚Äôt help but give this my 11, it‚Äôs probably my favorite song of theirs - i wish i could say more about it but all i have to say is that everything comes together in the best way possible here. i could probably listen to it for hours on end

**TiltControls** (11): There are a lot of great songs in this rate, but there wasn't much competition for my 11. The atmosphere of the song is a great start to the album and it's definitely one of my favourite tracks of theirs.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is SOOOOO good i literally named a playlist after the chorus

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I love Joba.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is very soothing, love all the elements of it

**laurent1683** (10): Marry me Deb Never (if i was straight), marry me Joba, marry me bearface, marry me Dom, marry me Matt, marry me Merlyn (and yeah Kev is my dad but he's not in this song)

**ManofOranges** (10): Reallly solid track

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): deb‚Äôs voice really just elevates this song from good to great

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This sound so good

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): A nice change of pace from previous BROCKHAMPTON openers, which have all been huge bangers like BOOGIE, NEW ORLEANS, HEAT, and GUMMY. NO HALO is understated and personal, with the beat being mostly an acoustic guitar to emphasize the bars of each member well. Matt, Merlyn, and Deb Never do a great job trading off on the hook.

**seanderlust** (9.5): mmm, I love this guitar. some of the verses towards the back half are not my favorite though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): such a good intro to the new version of Brockhampton.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Pretty low-key but I like it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh it's gonna be one of those albums isn't it

**kappyko** (8): yeah this is really good but the chorus carries

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): my response when I open up my new xbox series x

**tomandother** (8): i like this song a lot especially the chorus and merlyn‚Äôs verse

**team\_kockroach** (7.2): Works fine as an opener, I guess, but Merlyn‚Äôs verse sucks.

**1998tweety** (7): cute

#üëºüèº

**waluigiest** (7): I haven‚Äôt listened to Brockhampton since early 2018 and this new sound is‚Ä¶. jarring

**engifear** (6.2): alright but it gets boring and samey REAL quick

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Like the chorus of this one but it feels kinda flat, more like an extended intro than a true song.

**Macadamic** (2): Pretty boring tbh

So‚Ä¶ do you wanna fuck, or naw?

&nbsp;

An amazing outro to an amazing album. It really encapsulates the entire sound of the album well, with the jazzy feel to cap off the listening experience. And while it may not be my favorite on the album, it's undeniable that it fits the narrative well and is a great way to end the album overall.

#Still friends!

**tomandother** (11): this is one of my favourite songs of all time and in my top 3 album closers of all time, it is so incredibly emotional and visceral

**bbfan132** (10): an excellent outro that perfectly ties up the album

**bigbigbee** (10): This is an insane closer and an 11 contender for me. It gives me chills. The sincerity in his delivery destroys me, I love a song in waltz time, and I especially LOVE the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù (the part starting with ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get green skin‚Ä¶.‚Äù to ‚Äúif you made it your friend‚Äù ‚Äì hey I just learned that Pharrell featured on this, that‚Äôs awesome!) A perfect ending to an incredible album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The raw honesty of the project really works here, plus the melody lines are really good to listen to and the production is pleasant as well. It just all comes together for a fantastic closing track, it‚Äôs good that the album ends on a really strong note.

**rickikardashian** (10): me to my friends after ignoring them for 4 months because ive been depressed

**sandyfishnets** (10): fun fact apparently Jack White played guitar on this track

**steelstepladder** (10): Perfect outro as far as I'm concerned

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Just an incredible psychedelic soul song, with some crushing synths and repeated vocals along with a somewhat buried appearance from Pharrell and some nice guitar licks from Jack White. The end of the song, where Tyler builds to a loud, distorted scream of aggression, feels like IGOR in a nutshell.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Great production again, this album starts and ends on really strong songs

**sirpancakeXI** (9): Another bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): beautiful fitting outro

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): me after every relationship :(

**1998tweety** (7.5): nice

#Fucking blocked.

**Verdantshade** (7): like with flower boy I feel the closing track is a bit overindulgent

**team\_kockroach** (6.8): The ‚ÄúGlitter‚Äù moment of the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): production is good just not feeling his vocals but I guess he isn‚Äôt a singer anyway

**CrimsonROSET** (5.5): i think i needed to be on something for this

**ManofOranges** (5): I'm sorry to give this a lower score but to me it's just kind of a drag. That's not to say that it's awful though, cause it's not; it's just not suited to my taste.

**Macadamic** (2): such a boring closer. Pharell ruins everything (jk)
