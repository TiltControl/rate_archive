Pollen Rate Reveal, Day 3: here’s how EXACTLY WHAT YOU RUN FROM YOU END UP CHASING can still win
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kcf887/pollen_rate_reveal_day_3_heres_how_exactly_what/

Hello, and welcome to the Pollen rate reveal, day three! My name is frog, and I have had the pleasure to host this rate the past month and was really, really shocked by the top of the rate even though I should not have been! Some quick facts before we get started:

- There were 58 participants in this rate! [You can see them here.](https://pastebin.com/5JFYKbVX)
- The average score amongst all songs is 7.754. Impressive!
- The average controversy score is 1.684. That means anything above it should be considered controversial, and anything below it should be considered agreed upon.

Today we will be revealing #12-1, along with bonus positions #2 and #1.

Fun fact about the host before we get started: I checked my stats for Tiktok this past week, and I had gotten about 26M views in 2020. Neat!

See you at 1PM CST! Join [the plug.dj](https://www.plug.dj/popheads) room while you're at it, we'll be revealing every position there along with some fun shitposts to go along with it.

2009 was eleven years ago. Please let that sink in.

&nbsp;

Holy fuck. This one is hard to write about without tearing up. Mac's delivery here is emotional, heartfelt, and *there*. He feels every word he's speaking, as he traces the steps that have happened since his debut mixtape to the recording of this song. The rest of the song speaks for itself, and quite honestly it's hard for me to listen to this song without getting emotional so I'll end it here.

---

**ReallyCreative** (8): we knew it wasn't 2009 any more when we took a look at the charts

#Remembers 2009

**nootnoot781** (11): </3

**laurent1683** (10): What an emotional performance

**Macadamic** (10): sweet

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): gorgeous strings

**steelstepladder** (10): maybe my favorite song on the album? That piano is sooo good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): is this his best song? i might dare to say so, the instrumental is stunning, his wordplay is so casual here, and the chorus is just perfect, and it’s even more painful when you consider the context of what he’s talking about :(

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): jet fuel and 2009 should be illegal.

**1998tweety** (9): that intro whew

**bigbigbee** (9): The standout aspect of this album for me is the use of more “classical” instruments, and I have a special place in my hearts for strings and piano. This song is gorgeous.

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is also top half of the album for me .... i miss mac [2]

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i've always found songs that deal with the demons of fame extremely interesting,  this is no exception

**sirpancakeXI** (9): That intro is beautiful

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): This is one of the songs on Swimming that feels almost designed in advance to close out Mac's life and career. It's a beautiful, nostalgic look back on where Mac came from and where he's been. He considers what it would have been like to have taken a different path, one away from the eventual Hollywood excess that would consume him on and off for the next nine years. It's truly eerie and heartbreaking to hear.

**tomandother** (9): super emotional! great song! such a beautiful instrumental and mac sounds very heartbroken and somber yet hopeful, i love his performance here

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): that intro is SOOOOO heavenly, unfortunately the rest of the song doesn't really live up to it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This didn’t need to be this long but it’s otherwise a nice song

**bbfan132** (7.5): yet ANOTHER song that blends in with everything else but is also pretty good lol

#Does not remember 2009, possibly too young for reddit

**cvyspharmacy** (7): I'm sorry. It sounds okay, but I understand it's really personal. I feel like he sounds drunk/crying/high tho LOL

**seanderlust** (6.8): it's a good song, but it's kind of one note

**ManofOranges** (6): I like the strings at the beginning

Please do this, Mac. :(

&nbsp;

Fuck, what a depressing start to an album, huh? Even the opening line is rough:

> My regrets look just like texts I shouldn’t send


This hurts. Feels a bit like a pointed attack. I have an entire note on my phone about stuff I, at the time, feel like I *should* send to people, but ultimately do not because it’s just self destructive. Mac encapsulates that feeling perfectly here with the lyrics. And while quite short, lyrically, it really is poignant in my life and begins an almost therapy-like album (to me).

---

**sirpancakeXI** (11): Honestly this is how heaven sounds like

---

#Back on Earth

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Really love the lyrics of this one, I totally understand and relate to what he’s singing about here. This is such a strong opener for the album, it sets a high bar that the rest of the album doesn’t entirely match but it’s a really pretty piece of music regardless.

**steelstepladder** (10): Such a great opener

**tectec787** (10): almost grabbed the 11, but I think So it Goes is like .000000001% better, so...¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a soul-crushing intro that makes it really difficult to just kinda keep listening to the album as you'd listen to any other album.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): So beautiful and soulful, just a perfect way to begin this album. I honestly think this is the best Mac's singing has ever sounded, still not technically amazing but conveying so much. I already loved this one, but it resonated that much more after Mac's passing.

**seanderlust** (9.3): a solid start to the album

**akanewasright** (9): Beautiful album opener

**cvyspharmacy** (9): I love how sad and smooth this is. It gives me chills. I miss him ):

**Macadamic** (9): love this intro. So emotional.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): cute lowkey vibes

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): great intro

**1998tweety** (8): love the production on this

**cremeebrulee** (8): uhm this lowkey made me cry . i miss mac </3

**CrimsonROSET** (8): outro a bit too long

**ManofOranges** (8): Simplistic, in a way, but nonetheless I like it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): :(

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): heartbreaking

**bbfan132** (7.5): pleasant and relaxing opening track

#Not on Earth

**tomandother** (7): i like this song lyrically and i do think it’s quite pretty but i don’t get much out of relistening to it, it has lost impact for me since first listen significantly

\*insert Nicki Minaj comment\*

&nbsp;

One of the angriest-sounding tracks on the album, Tyler really lets it loose on "WHAT'S GOOD". Honestly, this is one of the catchiest hooks on the entire album for me. It never loses energy and goes fucking WILD live, so I'm glad the sub gave it the love it deserves!

"Self care," I whisper to myself as I place yet another order for boba. This is the eighth time this week alone. My friends and family are planning an intervention. Big Boba says keep going.

&nbsp;

This track is a BEHEMOTH. A two-part song and arguably one of the best songs of Mac Miller's careers, Mac talks about overcoming hardships, self control, and being able to handle yourself. I'm super glad this song did so well in this rate and placed the highest of all the Mac songs. It truly is deserving and I'm glad the sub is recognizing the talent served here.

---

**ReallyCreative** (9): chromatica II into 911 who? I don't know her

#Takes care of themselves :)

**cvyspharmacy** (11): I FEEL LIKE I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN MYSELF, BUT THE LYRICS, SOUND, ETC. LIKE THEY ALL SLAP SO FUCKING MUCH. PLEASE GO AWAY IF YOU DONT AGREE, LUV. I can listen to this happy OR sad, and the versatility makes me wana EXERT PEEEE.

**cremeebrulee** (10): THE BEAT SWITCH!!! THE ENTIRE VIBE OF IT i have so many listens of this song because i love just daydreaming to it ugh

**CrimsonROSET** (10): fuck.

**laurent1683** (10): Played this 10 times in a row when he died. A masterpiece.

**Macadamic** (10): wasn’t a fan of the beat switch when it dropped, but one of the best songs on the album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): another perfect song

**sirpancakeXI** (10): It make me feel good every time I listens to this song

**steelstepladder** (10): Self care, it's important

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I still have not listened to all of Mac's projects, but man... this song is easily my favorite of his and I don't think anything will surpass it. From the first second to the crazy switch to the outro, just gorgeous all around.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of Mac's final (and best) singles. A big part of the tragedy of Mac's death was how much he had been through and fought to get where he was already, and during his final year he genuinely seemed to be trying to defeat his demons and better himself. Self Care is Mac trying to find a better state of mind and focus on himself, and it's crushing how short that feeling would end up lasting. The second part, where Mac sings about oblivion, and the video, showing him being buried alive, are especially eerie. However, in the video he breaks out of the coffin and escapes once again. If only.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): one of his best singles, it’s a shame this never smashed when he was with us

**seanderlust** (8.5): the use of features on this album is really interesting. the thought of having Snoop Dogg and now J.I.D. playing background supporting roles rather than a full verse feels like an odd choice, but in some cases it adds to the track. i'm not sure it adds as much here as it did with snoop on what's the use, but still

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The second half is cute

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute a bit

#Does NOT take care of themselves

**bbfan132** (7.5): i was expecting a bit more from this song but it was fine, just a little boring at points

**tomandother** (7): this is a cool song and i like the second half a lot more but i don’t feel much enjoyment out of returning to it often

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I like the prechorus of this and the verses aren’t bad but oh my god his voice on the chorus is SO punchable. Like the way he elongates the word “soooooo” is just an ugly sound. He sounds better on the second half though, in general the “Oblivion” portion of this track is what saves it because that half is infinitely more interesting.

**ManofOranges** (4): Damn this one is just soooo long but doesn't keep me interested in it long enough for it to be worth.

#Get used to it

**rickikardashian** (8): why does this entire rate trick me into thinking we changed songs, but it’s still the same track? how am i supposed to rate this?

We get it Tyler, you eat your vegetables. Damn.

&nbsp;

This, right here, is a fucking banger and a *half*. It hits hard when you're trying to keep it together in a relationship. It has funny lyrics. It went hard as fuck live. It also happens to be [what Tyler's own favorite song of his is!](https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1304859806008664064?s=20). What more can I say?

---

#No comment

**CrimsonROSET** (8): so is the magic wand a gun or a vibrator

#Ma'am he's into men

**seanderlust** (8.8): i...is he threatening to kill the girl? Uh....

#Ready 2 Kill

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): ah yes, my favourite genre, gay possessiveness

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): probably Tyler's best song yet. seeing him perform this at the Grammys was insane and surreal

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): Even though I was one of the few people who really really liked Cherry Bomb, this feels like the perfect refinement of everything that album was experimenting with. Songs like DEATHCAMP and CHERRY BOMB tried to add elements of rock (in the vein of NERD) to Tyler's sound with divisive results, but NEW MAGIC WAND is that taken to a new level with a psychedelic turn. This is an emotional low point on the album for Tyler, and the song represents the unhinged chaos of IGOR in a way that no other song even comes close to. It's a blitzkrieg, with Tyler screaming and rapid-fire rapping with distortion effects all over his voice. Everything; the synths, the drums, the guitars, I wouldn't change a thing. It's the sound of pure chaotic emotional energy.

**bbfan132** (10): this production is insane

**cremeebrulee** (10): MURDER ANTHEM!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): If you've heard the bridge and the last verse and still did not give this track a 10...

**kappyko** (10): did he just say no need for masks AGAIN come on

**laurent1683** (10): this song GOES, i was on a bicycle and it got me speeding dangerously

**Macadamic** (10): best song on the album, no cap

**ReallyCreative** (10): SANTIGOLD APPRECIATION HOURS PROVIDING THOSE BACKING VOCALS QUEEN SHIT!!! CAN WE PLEASE RATE SANTIGOLD PLEASE

**skargardin** (10): but what a banger

**steelstepladder** (10): BANGER ALERT!!!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is my theme song when i use the magic wand in photoshop

**Verdantshade** (10): that grammy performance! it's great to see the darker pre-flower boy tyler return, and this is the refined culmination of that

**tomandother** (9.5): aggressive jam!

**stickywheels46** (9): Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables! :D

**waluigiest** (9): okay this is so chaotic I’m floored. Wonderful work

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Remember his super freaky performance of this at the Grammys? That visual of him breathing heavily into the microphone probably would have given me nightmares as a kid. Anyways I’m a horrorcore whore so I should probably love this track but I’m just kinda “eh” on it.

#Pacifist

**sirpancakeXI** (7): That voice sound a little bit weird but it is not bad I guess

**1998tweety** (5.5): this is scaring me

**ManofOranges** (5): Not as big a fan of this one as I am the other tracks, kind of a skip for me.

"What's the use?" I say, looking at the fifteen assignments I did not turn in at the end of the semester. It did not impact my grade in that class. I somehow pulled out with an A. There was no use.

&nbsp;

THAT. THUNDERCAT. BASS. GODDAMN. It really makes the song, honestly. That groove has been stuck in my head the entire month of November, I gotta be honest. There’s also appearances by Snoop Dogg and Syd on this track, both doing background vocals! What an absolutely dope collaboration.

---

#Feeling useless😔

**bbfan132** (10): total bop, definitely a step up from the first two songs

**cremeebrulee** (10): the SYNTH this is so good and i hope it makes it to the top 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is so groovy that you forget about how dark the song is

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok now wait a minute this is a hit??? I wasn't expecting a song like this on the album but it's got a groove to it!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BOP!!!!!!!!!

**Mysario** (10): I'm a sucker for funky bass and lyrics drenched in misery

**pat-rickstar** (10): This and Ladders are the duo that satisfy the basic pop fan in me. The bassline <3

**sandyfishnets** (10): someone I really love used to love this song. rip.

**seanderlust** (10): FUN

**skargardin** (10): BOP

**steelstepladder** (10): That bass is so funky omg

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): solid song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): One of the absolute grooviest songs in Mac's discography. Thundercat lays down one hell of a bassline, and everything just goes from there. This one is just a vibe, perfect for hot summer afternoons.

**1998tweety** (9): production on this is good [2]

**cvyspharmacy** (9): Sounds hela jazzy. I looove. It reminds me of that one song with ari I think. It's so good.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): It's somewhat memorable.

**Macadamic** (9): you can love it, you can leave it. I love it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): his singing style here reminds me a little of the masterpiece that is Dang! (feat. Anderson .Paak)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i fuck with the groove on this one

**engifear** (8): That Thundercat bass line makes this song, honestly

**ReallyCreative** (8): the vocals are... well everything else sounds great!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): mood

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like this one because of the smooth, danceable production. I looked the lyrics up they’re pretty well written and intricate, unfortunate (or perhaps fitting?) considering it’s about his battle with substance abuse. I will say though that the bridge sounds like it was cut from *IGOR*, but like, in a bad way.

#Is useful. Suspicious

**tomandother** (6.5): i actually really don’t love this song, i’m not sure why because it seems catchy and fun but i’ve just never connected with it, that being said it isn’t bad and it is a cool tune

While it is a decent remix, I have to admit that I do not like it at *all* compared to the original. The flow of the song gets wonky, and Dua genuinely sounds out of place on the song. However, I know y'all love Dua so it’s not surprising you guys were into this!

---

#Gay, loves Dua

**1998tweety** (10): queen

**CreepyMannequin** (10): I wish I could have given this a 11

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Dua is great here still a bop

**pat-rickstar** (10): Am I basic for preferring this song with Dua on it?

**rickikardashian** (10): [me giving my only score in the bonus rate to the remix with the pop lady i like](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0XyhF-WoAIW8vj.jpg)

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This song slap so hard

**Verdantshade** (10): not as good as the original but I'm giving it a 10 for dua

**bbfan132** (9): bearface’s voice is perfect here and dua sounds good here as well

**ReallyCreative** (9): Dua provides some much needed stability to this track, this is great actually

**tomandother** (9): a great and interesting remix

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Dua is on this? She’s barely noticeable. It’s cute though.

**cvyspharmacy** (8): I LOVE MY BABY DUA

**stickywheels46** (8): I forgot that this remix is almost a completely different song lol.

#Possibly straight, hates Dua

**engifear** (7.4): This remix actually made me appreciate the original a little more

**laurent1683** (7): Perfect intro and outro here, loved that they changed it up so much but nah Dua Lipa is not a rapper and Matt's verse here is a head-scratcher

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): there’s nothing wrong with this version and i dig that it’s different from the original but the original is just too good

**seanderlust** (6.5): a bit of an improvement, but I just don't find this one very compelling

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): Dua fits the vibe but (shockingly) doesn’t seem genuine. Jon B crushes his verse, though.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): this is just an inferior version ugh

"Let's Get Married" rights!!! 

Off of Kevin Abstract's solo album *ARIZONA BABY*, this song was actually one of the most anticipated releases in BROCKHAMPTON history. It definitely lives up to the title, and I'm glad it won the bonus rate. Fully deserved!

---

#Likes babies

**braydentv** (10): This song is better than anything off Ginger, Kevin Abstract > Brockhampton any day

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Will be very surprised if this one doesn’t win the bonus rate. I found this song through the Popheads Jukebox (RIP) and while the album it came from was something of a disappointment this is just so beautiful, I still revisit it from time to time. It’s like that moment in an indie romance film where the protagonist realizes who they’re really supposed to be with and they go running off into the night after them.

**laurent1683** (10): LET'S GET MARRIED gang

**sirpancakeXI** (10): It sounds kinda different from other Brockhampton's album but I like it.

**stickywheels46** (10): Kevin's solo work is the most underrated discography ever.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): the fact this was never released as a full brockhampton song is legitimately a crime

**tomandother** (10): wow

**team\_kockroach** (9.1): When are Brockhampton and Antonoff going to collab? That bridge is SO GOOD.

**cvyspharmacy** (9): I really liked this Brockhampton sample lol. But, I didn't like the verses.

**seanderlust** (9): the outtro!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): not even on the top 5 on arizona baby but she’s cute! also WHEN are we rating american boyfriend!!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): oh this is unexpected but nice

**Verdantshade** (8): all I want in life is another summery brockhampton album with ryan beatty

**bbfan132** (7): interesting song, it’s kind of all over the place but i still like it

#Hates babies. But also American Boyfriend rate when [2]

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Never liked this. Peach is infinitely better. And also I'm tired of Jack Antonoff LMAO. With that being said, American Boyfriend rate WHEN?

Why is Tyler mentioning Sagittariuses and Leos together? What a weird combination.

&nbsp;

Every album, Tyler creates a double track for the song in the tenth slot. And this one is arguably his best. Surprisingly enough, this song was #1 for nearly the *entire* rate. But sadly, it started to slip once the influx of scores came in and lost its grip on the spot. Still super glad this placed so high, what an iconic song.

---

**cremeebrulee** (8): omg outsold tu,n

---

#Enjoys double tracks

**akanewasright** (11): I love the new trend I’ve noticed of making two thematically tied tracks into a single track/medley. I mean, this is less of a trend than it is just this song and Tinashe’s Know Better, but they’re my favorite songs on those albums by far and away, so it’s a trick that I like a lot. Both songs are wonderful, but I was getting choked up toward the end of Gone, Gone.

**cvyspharmacy** (10): It just SOUNDS really good, and I can relate just cuz it's a "BYE BITCH" song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's a reach, but I'm getting a hint of MGMT? Some elements of this are very reminiscent of something off of Little Dark Age.

**kappyko** (10): cee lo green 🙄 but this song is great

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a 10 purely for gone, gone honestly. I just love this one so much, it's probably my second favorite track on the album. The melody is just great. Also, Thank You is actually pretty good too, honestly.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): thank you > gone gone btw

**rickikardashian** (10): this doesn't need to be a whole song, and the “i hate wasted potential” sound on tiktok is insufferable, but *gone, gone*would have been an easy 11

**sandyfishnets** (10): the lyrics here are amazing. They manage to portray so well that healing phase after a break up were you are starting to get over the person. The phase where you are so emotionally bruised and although you can start to look back on the person you loved and the moments you had together with fondness, there is no way you are going to make yourself that vulnerable with someone again for the next while.

**tectec787** (10): bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this honestly may be the apex/climax of the album, honestly an incredibly underrated track

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ok let's see. on one hand you've got GONE which is a 10, but on the other hand it's THANK YOU which is also a 10. so you've really gotta do the math here and average them out.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of Tyler's longest ongoing traditions is making the tenth song of his albums a multi part epic track, leading to some of my favorite Tyler songs like 911 / Mr. Lonely, PartyIsntOver / Campfire / Bimmer, and even the weird but sonically beautiful FUCKING YOUNG / PERFECT. This one joins the canon with two gorgeous halves coming together to make something even better. GONE, GONE makes the idea of a breakup so triumphant, and as someone who has been in a toxic relationship before, it hits so hard. THANK YOU is shorter, but no less welcome.

**Verdantshade** (10): tyler track 10s can do no wrong, and this is another superb pop song that (imo) functions best as the album closer

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): A solid bop

**TiltControls** (9.5): I think it could be cut down slightly, but otherwise an amazing track.

**tomandother** (9.5): i like the sample/interpolation in the last half of this and i think cee-lo sounds hot in the first half

**1998tweety** (9): oh wow this is good actually

**bbfan132** (8): i enjoyed this but it was a bit too long

**steelstepladder** (8): I kinda find the "my love's gone" part annoying but it's still good. Especially that back half ugh <3

#Dislikes double tracks

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): I prefer the "THANK YOU" section of this track

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the choruses on here, they sound like samples of old school songs, but I can’t help but feel like this would be stronger if it was just three separate tracks? Like I like the first part, then it switches and that’s neat, but then it switches a third time and it’s just excessive, especially since the third part is kinda the most boring. Like this is just a general note for all artists, it doesn’t need to be a six minute long double track you can just split it into multiple tracks and it’ll be okay, your listeners will thank you for it.

**Macadamic** (6): love the sample on the second part. Sampling your own music is cool. The first part kind of sucks.

**team\_kockroach** (5.8): A big step down from 911/Mr. Lonely.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): i know the vocals are intentional.... but that doesn't mean i have to like them

omg, the song from Tiktok???


&nbsp;

An instant earworm and easily the catchiest song off of the album, “SUGAR” really was the boy band's chance at winning this rate. Sadly, they couldn't get there in the end. A great effort from the boyband, but that's what happens when you go up against some great competition. Glad they were able to sneak into the top five!

---

**laurent1683** (10): Got me missing the lovers that never loved me

---

#lmao

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): can’t wait for when this wins

#Sweet

**1998tweety** (11): Am I giving this my 11 because the Dua Lipa remix made me listen to it more and realize the original is good too? Absolutely.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): we love a tik tok hit

**Mysario** (11): idk if this is the best song in this rate, or even my outright favourite, but I keep coming back to this song and that's more than most of these other songs. plus, it shares a name with the Maroon 5 hit that is not as good as "Maps"!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): i’m probably the world’s largest fan of the saturation series but this is easily their best song, it’s a thesis statement for this boy band and my god does it slap, easily their best chorus (if we’re not counting let’s get married)

**bbfan132** (10): a total bop

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is the only song of theirs i knew before going in, and i still fuck with it

**cvyspharmacy** (10): so many memories with this song. it lowkey makes me cringe, but it sounds really catchy. i feel like eating ice cream when listening to it.

**rickikardashian** (10): yes, this is the safe, basic bitch choice to like…. but when it’s right it’s right. the chorus is easily one of the best hooks from this year’s hits

**skargardin** (10): im basic but this bops hard as fuck

**steelstepladder** (10): This will probably be the highest ranking of the BH songs and while I think there is better here this is a bopbopbop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): their only hot 100 hit (probably ever lol) aw

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): BROCKHAMPTON have made a lot of poppy songs, but this is up there with HOTTIE as the poppiest. This isn't a bad thing, the song is fantastic and rightfully became their first to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Ryan Beatty is definitely the MVP here with an amazing melodic hook that I honestly thought was Kevin Abstract for a while.

**tomandother** (10): as good as any pop song gets

**Verdantshade** (10): undoubtedly their best post-ameer song

**waluigiest** (10): honestly a very pretty song, love Kevin on the bridge

**team\_kockroach** (9.6): What a phat hook.

**sirpancakeXI** (9): I have been streaming the remix version too much prior to listening this album, not hearing dua's verse feel weird but it is still a bop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I found this generic at release but I still listen to it now a year later, so…mea culpa. If we’re comparing songs that have strong 2000’s pop influences, I prefer Ginger.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): A nice chill out track, I think that their trademark sound is kinda “rap verses punctuated by more traditional boyband melody sections” and that style really shines here.

#Gay

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): I've listened to the Dua remix way more so this kinda sounds empty without her, still great though

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I prefer the Dua version but this is still really good

**cremeebrulee** (8): i don't particularly love this but it is sweet (like its namesake) i think the dua remix is a bit better

#Bitter

**ReallyCreative** (8): I feel like I should like this more but it's kind of a mess? Like there's a lot of great stuff but it feels very disorganized and disheveled

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): This isn't better than NO HALO. I also hate the damn "spinning on my nuts" meme.

**seanderlust** (6): it's just fine idk

**ManofOranges** (5): I go back and forth a lot with this song. There are parts that I do really like, but the more I think about how I feel about this song and the more I listen to it, I slowly start to dislike it again. And then when I go back to confirm my feelings so I can give a cold, hard score, my opinion begins to change again. It's just so hard to pinpoint. I can confidently say that do like the bridge and the hook at least somewhat. The rest is up to interpretation. I'm probably just gonna give the song a score based on what my gut tells me when I turn in this ballot, so we'll say what it ends up being.

**Macadamic** (3): I’m not a fan of this direction

#IDK

**engifear** (6.7): unrelated to the song, but what's up with these alt hip hop artists and using all caps?

As predicted, this album got slaughtered. Poor BROCKHAMPTON.

A complete left-field sound for this boy band, the album may be polarizing but for me is one of their best. As someone who had been around with them since *ALL-AMERICAN TRASH*, seeing their evolution has been a wild ride. To me, this is the perfect rap album to listen to when you're trying to hold it together while it all falls apart. And while I may not like some of the songs on casual listening, I cannot deny that this album is perfect for that mood. Many of you guys disagree, but obviously to each their own.

---
**laurent1683** (9.583): one of their worst albums and still a 10/10. BROCKHAMPTON stan forever

**team\_kockroach** (8.525): Before this rate, I hadn’t listened to a lot of Brockhampton, but I’m pretty impressed by what I heard here.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.333): I love Joba and Kevin is a gay icon. Enough said.

**bigbigbee** (8.250): I think Brockhampton has a huge advantage in that they are a group – I love the contrasts of different vocal tones on a lot of songs on this album. I think this is the least consistent album of the three, but it’s the one with singles I stream the most often. And TBH, I actually appreciate like the diversity of sounds here.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.167): i never heard any of brockhampton's stuff but i've heard mixed things about this one, but i believe in them!

**steelstepladder** (8.000): I'm so scared for this album please do good

**waluigiest** (7.917): I was a Brockhampton Stan at one point in my life but now I just like Kevin Abstract a lot

**skargardin** (7.833): Listening through this I really need to get into the rest of BH's album. For me this is a bit uneven at places but there's still a lot to enjoy either way.

**stickywheels46** (7.833): Very underrated.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.817): i have a weird relationship with this album - sometimes i love it and sometimes i hate it. it’s lucky we did this rate while i’m in my “yas i love it” phase lmao

**cremeebrulee** (7.792): this album was the only one i hadn't heard before but i think it does hold up pretty well considering the other two are some of my favorites. i found a couple of great tracks from here and i can't wait to dive deeper into the BH discography

**pat-rickstar** (7.792): This one gets a little bogged down in the middle with some more forgettable songs, but it starts and ends with some great songs.

**Verdantshade** (7.250): I miss happy brockhampton :( while as a whole I think this is a better album than iridescence, I've found the songs a lot less memorable

**engifear** (7.242): The first few songs and the last few songs on this album are so dull to me. I kept forgetting to even rate them because they became background noise. I think I listened to Sugar like 4 times before I remember to actually Listen to it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.667): Yeah so this was very clearly the album I had the least to say about and reading the comments in the rate announcement thread it seems like the general consensus is that this album is weaker than the other two. I’ve never quite “understood” BROCKHAMPTON, I get the concept and the appeal but on a musical level they often leave me flat, and this didn’t change my mind. There were one or two songs on here that I liked but on the whole it felt like I was just marking time waiting for it to finish.

**ReallyCreative** (6.567): this is a busy album, every song is busy and it is difficult to listen to as a result. There are some cool moments and touches but I don't see myself coming back to much on this. No Halo is an iconic moment however, and Victor Roberts is an excellent closer. I just can't get into a LOT of the middle section.

**kappyko** (4.750): the turnaround on brockhampton was swift and unfortunate, if not undeserved, and it's sad because for a brief moment they genuinely seemed exciting and unique. it's cliche to shit on them nowadays but i can't help but agree they've become predictable and a bit embarrassing as much as they try

frogaranaman: So I ran the results without their scores, and it turns out it changed nothing. "SUGAR" actually placed lower than it did in the official results. The only song of BROCKHAMPTON's to change was "DEARLY DEPARTED" rising one spot.

Mac Miller lost one more song on day two and Tyler gained two songs on day three, with seven total songs in the top ten.

Climb on top of me like a ladder. Haha. Get it? Get it..? Get it.

I dunno.


&nbsp;

Bop, bop, BOP! What an absolutely infectious banger. The bouncy atmosphere from the beginning, the trumpet, the vibes. Just off the charts. What a great song and understandable why it’s the fan favorite off of *Swimming*. I'm glad it kept steady in its climb to the top five, absolutely deserved and a lovely track to cap off *Swimming*’s performance in the Pollen rate!

---

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): depression but make it BOUNCY

---

#Can climb

**cremeebrulee** (11): a bop that landed in my top 100 of 2020 because it's still that bitch. i actually switched this very last minute from a tyler song, so i hope it wins now ..

**hikkaru** (11): 11adders

**kappyko** (11): serve

**sandyfishnets** (11): best song in the rate.

**1998tweety** (10): production on this is GOOD wtf, prob my fav on the album tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i understand why people call this the peak of the album

**cvyspharmacy** (10): It just sounds really good. Lyrics bop as usual

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Finally, some flavor.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): top 3 song from the album for me

**Macadamic** (10): one of my favourites!

**ManofOranges** (10): "I been in this shit so long that it don't smell" I- sdlfjdslkjlds

**pat-rickstar** (10): Banger! That's all I have to say. I expect this to do well bc it's popheads and anything upbeat and poppy we will eat up

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Really like the part when he sing "when the night, meet the light, turn to day"

**skargardin** (10): this is a definite highlight whew

**waluigiest** (10): the intro to this song is sooo beautiful with the layered vocals, and then the beat comes in and makes it that much better. So groovy.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): amazing instrumental

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): BOP

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): That instrumental breakdown is still stuck in my head.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): Another fantastic groove, this time with the addition of a horn section that adds that much more pep to what was already a big bop.

**seanderlust** (9.3): felt cute...might slip into the sea later...idk

**bbfan132** (9): i like the synth funk sound a lot!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Maybe I’m just easily seduced by a funky groove but I quite liked this one.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): ooh this is the funkiest song in the album, almost feels like a downtempo version of something off of the divine feminine

**tomandother** (7.5): one of the more lively songs on the record to me! i like mac’s delivery heaps on the verses

#The user with "ladder" in their name did not give "Ladders" a ten. Interesting.

**steelstepladder** (7): Solid but I wish the horns came in a bit earlier tbh

RIP Mac. Thanks for being such a pioneer and visionary for rap. :')

---
**MoonlightByWindow** (9.285): seriously amazing album. will definitely be doing a deep dive into mac’s discography now

**CrimsonROSET** (8.385): this is gonna be a difficult one to rate without thinking of the context

**cremeebrulee** (8.269): i hadn't relistened to this album (in its entirety) since i found out mac died so it was pretty emotional. it's kind of eerie how some of the lyrics feel like a goodbye at the time :/ beyond that, there's some incredible tracks here that i revisit all the time. i love love love my 11 and i hope it can secures the win for mac!

**kappyko** (8.154): i think this might be the album in the rate with the biggest streaming numbers despite mac's biggest song on this album being behind the biggest songs on the other two? anyways it's very good

**skargardin** (8.077): I really enjoy this album even though it drags a little bit in the middle. It both starts and end on a really strong note.

**bigbigbee** (7.692): Great start and end of the album but I find the middle a bit of a slog. I prefer the more melodic songs. This one took the longest time to grow on me but I’m glad I’ve listened to it now.

**steelstepladder** (7.615): Probably my least favorite of the three because the beats are weaker imo but it's still great

**pat-rickstar** (7.462): This might have been my favourite album in the rate if it were cut down a bit. Also how did Fantano give this a 3/10 lol, no way is it that much worse than the other two here.

**tomandother** (7.385): mac is in my top 10-and i love this album experience as a whole, but don’t really like individual songs (somehow) and my ratings may reflect that

**stickywheels46** (7.308): Rest in peace, Mac.

**Verdantshade** (7.231): I didn't listen to mac until after his death (rip) and this and circles showed how exciting his career could have been. this is the album I'm least familiar with in the rate as I find it drags a bit in the second half, so I've bumped up some of the scores a little bit

**laurent1683** (7.154): Overrated, some absolutely beautiful moments and some very boring moments but i can understand why those that relate more to it like it

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.077): Yeah, this album is just not for me. It's too one-note for how long it is, and the few stand-outs aren't enough to salvage it.

**team\_kockroach** (7.077): I tried to rate this album without considering his death, and it’s sadly not my favorite. It’s a singles album that isn’t that cohesive. There’s a lot of clumsy lyricism and off-beat rhythms - issues that were fixed in the Tiny Desk concert.

**ReallyCreative** (6.654): I listened to this album not long after Mac died at the suggestion of a friend, I think I enjoyed it more then, but there are several tracks that hold up as being really great. Mac's vocal delivery is hard to listen to sometimes, but I tend to warm up to it after a little bit. He still has some moments that are downright corny, cheesy, and have me feeling secondhand embarrassment, but then there's also Ladders so

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.331): I’d previously listened to *The Divine Feminine* and I thought it was like, okay. I think the problem was that I listened to *Freudian* by Daniel Caesar around the same time, an album with similar themes and sounds that’s infinitely better, but on the whole I was just kinda ambivalent towards Mac Miller. This did not change that. When Mac is on he is ON and he delivers great music, but the flashes of greatness are punctuated by a lot of mediocrity, which is to say songs that sound good enough to be released but aren’t really all that much worth listening to. His music exists on a knife’s edge… are his vocals raw/heartfelt or just ugly/untrained? Is the plainness of his lyrics honest or just banal? Are his songs “chill” or just boring? I oscillate back and forth on these points basically from track to track, but more often than not I find the answer to lie on the negative side of the fence. Perhaps he just speaks to a demographic that I’m not a part of.

**CreepyMannequin** (4.769): sorry but Mac’s voice is so annoying

Fun fact, he actually had the top six until the last day of ballots. That would have been a rate first! I can't think of any other artists who got close.

Anyways. Which do you think will win?

The 1983 Korean Airlines Flight #007 to the Soviet Union when they were trying to explain they were a civilian plane with a sitting Congressman on the plane: Don't, don't shoot me down.

&nbsp;

Perfection all around. One of those songs that's absolutely *perfect* for an unrequited crush / love playlist, and Tyler fucking KNOWS it. And the color palette on this music video is literally from a wet dream, holy shit. Also, fun fact: when I saw Tyler live, I saw one of the few shows he actually performed this song and I'm pretty sure it was the first performance of this song! When I tell you the pit went nuts, they went *nuts*.

---

**seanderlust** (11): if kanye also used MBDTF as an opportunity to come out of the closet.

#Is indeed a gun

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Is it bad that I’m giving my 11 to the most straightforward, easy to understand song on the album? Maybe I’m just basic but I really like this track, it’s accessible while still maintaining the weirdness that makes *IGOR* stand out. The backing music sounds classy for some reason and it’s a great juxtaposition with his scratchy voice and the atonal “harmonies” in the chorus, and I love the way the melody seems to stumble over itself. I can actually understand all the lyrics here and I like what he’s saying, boys *are* dangerous and that’s the tea! Hope his next album takes its cues from this track.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): probably my favorite from album. The production is immaculate and it’s nice to see Tyler have a queer themed song

**letsallpoo** (11): copying and pasting a writeup i did on this last year: Gun metaphors routinely feel unearned, with many an artist invoking one without fully considering the cultural significance behind this weapon, especially in the current year. It’s to the song’s benefit that Tyler, the Creator sidesteps the simile as he co-opts the idiom in the title; a boy isn’t like a gun, he is one, as if Tyler’s fully accepting of the implications this comparison begets. “A Boy is a Gun” blends violence and love starting from the opening: “You so motherfuckin’ dangerous,” he gushes sweetly, tenderly, right after a gunshot fires off, and his ability to switch between an affectionate and a harsh delivery with all of the ease of pulling a trigger heightens the instrumental’s unevenness. It’s a song designed to keep you on edge, perpetually unsure of whether there’s a tender chord or an explosive lyric waiting at the end of the beat.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Everything about this is so good, the evolution of the song over it's runtime, the incredible lyrics, it all works SO well together ugh

**waluigiest** (11): This is almost tender. The lyrics are so beautiful, the sample is stunning, the delivery borders on a certain flavor of Frank Ocean. It’s fantastic.

**1998tweety** (10): this was kind of a serve oh wow

**bbfan132** (10): honestly a perfect track, top-tier production

**cremeebrulee** (10): i wish i had a second 11 to give to this song. its so good. it's really just so good. "you invited me to breakfast why the fuck your ex here" still makes me laugh lmao

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): People think that I'm insane - the only gun is in my brain. Each new birth, it gives me hope. That's why I don't smoke that dope. Insane people think I am - brain inside my only friend. Hope it gives me, birth each new. That's why I don't smoke, it's true.

**kappyko** (10): the chorus is a jumpscare. i got over it even though guns always fucking scare me

**steelstepladder** (10): Could have been an 11 on another day

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://youtu.be/QT0oUARKw68

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a boy is a guuuuun

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Tyler isn't known for heavily sampling in his music, but this song shows he can do it with the best producers. Flipping the same sample as Kanye did on Bound 2 but in his own incredible way, this song is just sonic bliss. Even though the song is all about uncertainty and anxiety, the reality of his toxic relationship bearing down on him, the layers of synths, samples, and background vocals are heavenly. Solange in particular drops some amazing runs. This is one to listen to with good headphones.

**Verdantshade** (10): this is the real hidden gem of the album and imo one of tyler's best. he draws a lot from kanye on igor and his sampling on this song rivals (and might honestly be better than) bound 2

**pat-rickstar** (9): I like how the gunshots are incorporated into the instrumental

**sirpancakeXI** (9): This is SOOOOOO catchy

**tomandother** (9): soulful jam!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): the production is a little bit busy for me, I think it could be stripped back a little bit but it's very vibey

#Is not a gun

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.6): cute

**ManofOranges** (7): I really like the sample that plays throughout the song for some reason. This is also yet another track where I like the ending quite a bit.

**team\_kockroach** (5.5): I didn’t like Bound 2, and I don’t really like this one either. This is the first song on the album that felt dragging. The ending is nice, though.

#It’s actually about how it feels to be so in love with someone and find out they’re in love with someone else / still not over their ex... as in, the boy has a gun and just shot you. But the boy is the gun that shot you.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): is this innuendo

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe i just have a more dramatic view but... is this about literally shooting someone down after they admitted their feelings towards you? especially with how most of these lyrics have been going

#😔

**Macadamic** (5): not good, not bad, don’t really care

What happens when I shake my fat ass anime booty. 🥵

&nbsp;

Objectively the poppiest song on the album, "EARFQUAKE" is one of those love songs that you don’t expect to get stuck in your head SO easily but it does. And while Playboi Carti is speaking enchantment table and I have no clue what the ever living fuck he's saying, his verse still bops so I gotta give him credit where credit's due. I expected this song to win the rate, so as I was collecting results I was surprised to see it never take the #1 spot. What happens when your album is *that* good, huh!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): so is it earthquake or earfquake tyler make up your fucking mind was there any censorship that covered natural disasters but not 'a boy is a gun'

#Comments about Playboi Carti

**ManofOranges** (11): I honesty love this song so much, I pretty much did this rate just so I could give this song my 11, I adore it that much. Playboi Carti's verse, in spite of the fact that I don't know a single fucking thing that he's saying other than his line about whoa vicky, is just so addicting to me. And the outro is also great.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): [CARTI VERSE CANNOT BE TRANSCRIBED]

**nootnoot781** (10): i have never looked at the lyrics but i think carti says "ain't got body roll. don't give a fuck about nothin. you're like fuck i'm alone. i might call my lawyer. like gone set me up. bitch don't set me up. don't retaliate (slime). we're all at the club. and he wiggin, like we're vegan. oh my god. damn not titties. summer love. summer love" [*frog note: this is wrong.*]

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Fuck Carti for dumping Iggy with their kid, but this song still slaps.

**Verdantshade** (10): carti lyrics cannot be transcribed

**steelstepladder** (10): Weird to say this but Carti makes this song

**laurent1683** (9): Carti's verse is magical

#Ass: phat

**engifear** (11): This was on my list top songs of 2019 that I submitted last year and I stand by it.

**rickikardashian** (11): for the longest time i had *Sugar* as my 11, but this is just such a wild experience that i had to give it my 11

**bbfan132** (10): melodic king, i could listen to this for hours on end

**RandomHypnotica** (10): another 11 contender right here, this song just hits in ALL the right places, incredible. "Don't leave, it's my fault" just gets more powerful every time Tyler sings it

**skargardin** (10): absolute banger

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): the stage burning down in the video really predicted 2020

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Tyler's biggest song yet, and even though not his best, can't really complain about it

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Much like See You Again before it, I'm really glad this was rejected by bigger pop stars, because it just would not have been the same without Tyler on lead vocals. EARFQUAKE could've been a normal pop song and been great, but the Tyler weirdness definitely kicks it up a notch more.

**waluigiest** (10): the chrous is just magnetic

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this song is definitely an acquired taste because of playboi carti but it does bop

**1998tweety** (9): iconic meme bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I was really into this when it came out but as time has gone on my opinion on it has cooled. I think it’s cool how the whole song is basically just a big long chorus and the way he just screams out “DON’T LEAVE, IT’S MY FAULT” is really cutting but I kinda wish that there was more to it. Still it’s a pretty iconic moment, when this dropped we knew he was coming for blood.

**kappyko** (9): its fucking good what can i say

**Macadamic** (9): I love to shake my big anime booty to do this song 🥵

**pat-rickstar** (9): This was one of the only songs I knew before doing this rate. I wasn't sure if I liked it before, but it's definitely better in the context of the album

**sirpancakeXI** (9): I used to hate this song but it has grown on me a lot

**tomandother** (9): good song

**seanderlust** (8.5): I don't know what the fuck carti is saying, but go off sis

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): DON’T LEAVE, IT’S MY FAULT!!!

**cremeebrulee** (8): i might be a lil sad if this wins bc its far from the best track on IGOR but its still a great song! i love the fault/earthquake pun

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): i don’t get the hype for this, it’s kinda boring 😭

#Flat ass

**team\_kockroach** (1): I hope this doesn’t win the rate. It’s a great song, but not top-10 material, so I dropped my score a lot. It reminds me of “Swimming Pools” by Kendrick Lamar. It’s a radio-friendly, career-defining, top 20 lead single with amazing production, but it somewhat fails by repeating its chorus/refrain too much.

FOUR FORE FOR FOUR FORE-

&nbsp;

Surprisingly enough, this was not the rate leader for a WHILE. That position was actually held by "GONE, GONE / THANK YOU", but as that song began to slip in its absolute stronghold on the #1 spot, "I THINK" snuck in and took its spot on the throne. Tyler dethroned himself for the throne, what an icon.

---

**ReallyCreative** (11): well guess what? I don't. what are you gonna do about it?

---

#Descartes

**CreepyMannequin** (11): I just think it’s neat

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Fastest 11 choice in the west.

**pat-rickstar** (11): Love the production on this song. Choosing an 11 in this rate was tough but this slaps and ended up winning me over.

**skargardin** (11): i think this is the best song in the rate yup! Solange just sounds incredible on the chorus

**Verdantshade** (11): pop perfection? a simple love song that interpolates stronger and its sugary catchiness made it one of my anthems of summer 2019, when I moved to holland... how different times were back then

**bbfan132** (10): 3 perfect songs in a row, i don’t know what else to say about this lol

**bigbigbee** (10): I love this song so much, and I tried to come up with something interesting to say about it, but I just couldn’t think of anything except “yeah well it’s like, really good….”

**CrimsonROSET** (10): did this fucker just go 'bridge' and play the bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Tyler killed it but also Solange is an excellent match here. Easily a top 3 song from the album

**kappyko** (10): the true star of the album tbh

**ManofOranges** (10): I think I've fallen in love (with this song). Solange's voice is real beautiful here.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Hands down the best track on this album

**steelstepladder** (10): I THINK IM FALLING IN LOOOOOOVE

**team\_kockroach** (10): This is the “Where the Flower Blooms” moment on IGOR, and it’s so good.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): in a just world, this is #1 on all the charts for a couple of months. so catchy and so fun and so bubbly! immense replay value

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): There's something really magical about this song, from the grimy house beat to the Kanye-esque flow on the first verse to Solange killing it to the fucking BRIDGE. There's even a nice little call-forward to PUPPET a few songs away. Just an incredible track, and one of the best examples of how IGOR defies genre itself by blending so much together in a bizarre way.

**waluigiest** (10): this whole song is gorgeous: the bridge, Solange’s vocals, the twinkly instrumental. It’s stunning.

**akanewasright** (9): This is probably the most pop song on the album, and I liked it a lot throughout, but the bridge... that sent it to another level

**tomandother** (9): another good song with a pretty bridge and striking arrangement

**seanderlust** (8.7): this was an early favorite listening through

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): solange sounds so good in this ugh

**Macadamic** (8): gets a bit repetitive after a while, but still very good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): it was hard not to give this a 4 4 4 4

**1998tweety** (7.5): groovy a bit

#Billie Eilish

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): One of my main frustrations with this album is that it’s really hard to get a hold on the tracks with how they’re so grungy and constantly shifting; I’m sure for a lot of people that’s a selling point but I’m a bit more traditional. I respect the experimentation and how he chooses to convey a mood but it’s frustrating when we get teased by a melody section that I really like the sound of that isn’t fully explored. I would love to hear the synth wave bridge of this song expanded into its own track but alas, it’s just a pit stop.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): that bridge really gives me wii music vibes

frogaranaman: # IGOR

---

**Overall Average**: 8.118 **// Average Controversy:** 1.632 **// [All Scores](https://pastebin.com/ZRcsGZrM)**

---

By far and away my favorite album of the bunch, and one I have the most personal connection with. It was obvious that Tyler was going to win this rate, but good *lord* I did not anticipate this domination.

I think the most interesting thing about this rate, for me, was seeing how quickly *IGOR* ran away with it. I think there was *rarely* a moment throughout the collection of scores that this album did not own half of the top 10, and **until the last day of scores, the entire top six was basically his**. A rare feat for an album, but well deserved! Easily one of the best albums of the 2010s and deserves every ounce of recognition it gets.

&nbsp;

Oh yeah, I checked what the album average would be without "EVERYTHING YOU RUN FROM YOU END UP CHASING" and it would be an 8.39. Whoops.

---
**laurent1683** (9.583): What i wanted after Cherry Bomb. That distorted sound is my blood.

**steelstepladder** (9.333): My favorite of the bunch and for good reason. I would not be surprised if this is my highest rated album I've ever done in these rates

**kappyko** (9.083): Is Good. Okra Reallyshouldhavebeenonanalbum

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.083): I love this album so much and yet I still haven't listened to Flower Boy, what the fuck am I doing...

**Verdantshade** (9.000): one of the few albums of the late '10s that I would call objectively perfect from front to back (perhaps bar kanye's verse on puppet), and somehow it's still not as good as flower boy. tyler really went and proved that flower boy wasn't a fluke and he has solidified himself as one of the most exciting artists today.

**skargardin** (8.583): Strongest album in the rate for me. There are so many incredible production choices and hooks to appreciate.

**waluigiest** (8.583): WOW I forgot how strong this album was top to bottom.

**pat-rickstar** (8.375): IMO the best album here. As of writing these scores I've listened to each one 3 times all the way through, and this is the one I see myself returning to the most.

**cremeebrulee** (8.333): this project is just . so good. tyler really made this album so relatable and i hate that lol. it's cohesive and i really like the tie in with the narration. there's so many songs here that i love i usually end up just relistening to the whole project if i listen to one song. deserved its grammy!

**bigbigbee** (8.250): Not only is this project perhaps the best album narrative I’ve ever heard, not only is the production incredible, but also most individual songs on IGOR are just so distinct from anything I’ve listened to before. This could of course be because of my rather limited music-listening experience, but I think it also speaks to what an achievement of composition this is. It’s sonically cohesive without being same-y (which I thought that Swimming could edge into occasionally). The associated music videos and performances accompanying this album’s promotions are gorgeous, stylized, and high-concept. I don’t have enough good things to say about IGOR! I never find myself listening to just one song from this album – I don’t typically think “I want to listen to EARFQUAKE”, I think “I want to listen to IGOR”.

**ReallyCreative** (8.233): This kind of music isn't really in my wheelhouse but it's easy to appreciate how well constructed this album is. There are a few moments I don't really like, but pretty much every song has a place, and the downright meticulous intent in the details really elevate the body of work as a whole.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.925): i still prefer flower boy by a mile but this album is also great! shoutout to new magic wand especially <3 i used to hate her but now she’s my fave song on the album, look how far we’ve come

**stickywheels46** (7.917): Tyler's best album to date, next level production.

**sandyfishnets** (7.750): I did not expect to love this album as much as I did (haven't so heard much of Tyler's stuff before). I'm glad that my first experience with this album was listening to it in one go, as opposed to random songs on shuffle, which wouldn't have the same effect for sure.

**akanewasright** (7.667): I did not "get" this album on my first listen. I thought it was obviously well made, but I spent most of it waiting for the thing to end so that I could have rated it and move on to music that I would normally listen to. I'm so, so fucking glad that I gave it a second chance, becauseI now consider it one of my favorite that I've listened to this year. Every track is well done in its own way, and all of them come together to establish a story that I personally found really affecting.

**team\_kockroach** (7.100): It’s not “Best of 2019” material, and it might even be the worst album of the three. The last three tracks are a little stale. The features are perfect, though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.708): This album was such a serve. While Tyler was a solid name before this I think a lot of people just kinda viewed him as a little punk, they liked his music well enough but rolled their eyes at him and his fans, but he shut all his detractors up with this one. It’s one of those rare albums that feels weird and unique but also manages to be *good* at the same time. It really is genre defying and I can understand his frustration at it receiving an award for being a rap album because it kinda isn’t, but the well deserved critical acclaim probably helps him sleep at night. Very curious to see what his next album will be like because he set a high bar for himself here.

**CrimsonROSET** (6.625): tyler is going into this one with a disadvantage because as someone ace/aro, these are... just not quite relatable feelings for me. but i'm happy for him?

TiltControls: Congrats to Tyler for winning the rate and sweeping the top 3!  I've updated the [Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [Leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard)! Not many changes to the top leaderboards, so I'll just list where things are right now.

**Artists**

Now with over 5 performances each, Mac (#46/216) and BROCKHAMPTON (#132/216) take their place on the artist leaderboard. Tyler also moves up from #44 to #30 based on his great performance this rate

**Songs**

The peaking song, I THINK, takes #136 on the Songlist average rankings! (#132 if excluding bonuses). I THINK also joins an elusive club of 22 other songs not to get a score below 7 in a rate!

At the other end, EXACTLY WHAT YOU RUN FROM YOU END UP CHASING ends up as our 42nd most controversial song of all time (#37 without bonuses). 15 seconds - but all full of iconicness!

**Rates**

The rate takes the spot for 18th highest rate average (could have been higher if y'all didn't let BH flop). It also ends up at #16 for least controversial rate.


Huge thanks to frogaranaman for the great rate! Those shitposts were great (and educational)! I feel like I've really drilled down the first 30 seconds of making sugar foods.
