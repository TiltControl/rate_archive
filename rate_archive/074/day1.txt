Here we are! The FIRST song out of the Classic Greatest Hits Rate! I am SO okay with this going out first. This has always been one of my least favorites from Queen. Like Seven Seas of Rhye, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. Unlike Seven Seas of Rhye, this isn‚Äôt as fun to me. - Molly


---

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I‚Äôve heard this song so many times but I had no clue it was Queen until recently! I just associated this song with commercials now.

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): just kinda weird, I'm not a fan of this one.

---

# SAVIOUR OF THE UNIVERSE

**enecks** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**Naomi1998xx** (10): TUUUUNE, I lost my bottoming virginity while the Flash Gordon scene in Ted played in the background, so its very personal to me

**1998tweety** (9): X1 outsold, this bops though

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): Fuck me this is so much better than it should be allowed to be

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Batdance outsold

**peppersmith67** (9): My 3rd grade dance class had to choreograph a dance number with the teacher to this song and EVERYBODY loved this song to death. I need to watch the movie to just to hear this campy dialogue in context.

**Mysario** (8.5): can't name a single person who has actually seen this movie

**bespectacIed** (8): UH HUH

**J\_Toe** (8): this is gonna sound so dumb but I didn't know this was a Queen song, even though it sounds incredibly 'Queen'. I think I've only heard the "Flash -ah ha!" soundbite used in a fast food add here in Australia.

**ggodisawomann** (7): savior of the UNIVERSE

**vayyiqra** (7): This is one of their most bizarre songs ever, and I know it will get trashed, but I admire how original it is. Side note: did you know Brian May has a PhD in astrophysics?

**waluigiest** (7): what is happening?

# Jesus is my saviour not this flash person

**rotating3Dtext** (6): that was weird

**runaway3212** (6): The ARTPOP of queen, want to say more than it does.

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): it's crazy how much queen is in pop culture. i didn't know that FLASH. AAAAAAHHHH was from queen until like last year

**zamomattel** (4): bit of a gimmick really

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like a parody of a superhero song, i can not see anyone actually listening to this. Dayman outpeaked

# The Zeros

**radiofan15** (0): Now, I don‚Äôt know how many of you dogs of the scurviest sea read comics, but I do a big pile of comics. One thing that blows my mind is how completely insane the powers in the DC universe are. Look at Superman. This guy has more powers than French restaurants have ways to say ‚Äúyour taste in wine is atrocious‚Äù. He has powers to do with every part of his body and then some. He forgets powers sometimes. He can shoot heat rays out of his eyes, frost breath from his mouth and red son radiation from his ass. He‚Äôs that sort of crazy dude. All because he absorbs solar radiation. Look at Batman. His power? The anti-power. Sure, he should be some tame, kung fun master of not much, but instead he‚Äôs the hottest shit to ever shit on a plate. You got a power? He‚Äôll find your weakness and give you seizures or heart attacks. He‚Äôll light you on fire when you‚Äôre sleeping or make you recharge your green lantern ring in the power outlet. Ten thousand volts of fuck you batman. That‚Äôs Batman. But the fucking Flash, my god, my FUCKING GOD, this man has the greatest powers of all. If Superman‚Äôs powers are being sucked off by twin super models and batman coming home to discover your wife is not only bisexual but has two friends she wants you to ‚Äòget in on‚Äô then the Flash is an orgy with a thousand women who also want to pay your World of Warcraft billing. And click the mouse for you. This man is just that fucking hot. They have to power him down in the comics half the time just to keep him from doing everyone else‚Äôs job. Ok first off, he can travel at lightspeed. Mother fuck! Not only does he travel at lightspeed, but time slows down for him. So he feels like he‚Äôs having a casual jog or reading the paper, meanwhile, his feet are moving so fast you can hear him coming from Montana while he‚Äôs already gotten to Arizona. That‚Äôs fucking fast. But wait! The ability to move at Lightspeed just isn‚Äôt fucking enough! I know! Christ this guy can punch you so many times in a second you‚Äôve been hit five times in the cock and two times everywhere else. You think you‚Äôre about to fight the Flash and then it hits you, for the last split second he‚Äôs beaned your beanbags with more blows than you had sperm. But no, there‚Äôs more! The Flash can also vibrate through walls. Now last I heard, you can not move so fast you can vibrate through walls, so what actually happens is the Flash is so fast he can pick and choose the movement of his individual molecules and move them through other solid objects, phasing through solid matter like it ain‚Äôt no thing. I mean you think a guy who runs at lightspeed would run into shit but no, the Flash just goes right through them. To top that with a cherry and some whipped cream (which the Flash made in like a millisecond, fucker) he can selectively choose to cause objects to be ‚Äúokay‚Äù afterwards or FUCKING EXPLODE. That‚Äôs right. He can run through you and make you blow up by transferring kinetic energy into you. Like Jesus. IT‚Äôs bad enough you can‚Äôt hit this guy, but he doesn‚Äôt even have to punch you. Now your testicles have exploded and you‚Äôre thinking you‚Äôre about to hit him. Jesus? Just give it up. He‚Äôs the fucking Flash. Now imagine that somehow there‚Äôs someone who can get around the Flash blowing your balls up secret ninja technique. Ok. He can also control the flow of energy between objects. This power makes no sense but basically he can throw a rock at you, and you think it‚Äôs going slow and then he‚Äôs like WHOOHOOO WIZARDLY FLASH POWERS and bam it‚Äôs going at lightspeed. So he can throw seven million rocks at you in a second then make them all goes different speeds thus striking your nads with seven million rocks one after the other. But wait! There‚Äôs more! He can also take energy from the very power of speed and make clothes out of it. Yes. Flash makes his pants out of GOES FAST. The man is so fast he can make Flash pants that GOES FAST go right into. I don‚Äôt even start to understand the physics of that but basically SPEED == REALLY TIGHT UNDERWEAR AND COOL LIGHTNING THINGIES OVER THE EAR. You would think this is the end of it but ok let‚Äôs say Flash is fighting Superman and shit he‚Äôs going to lose and FUCK how is Superman THIS fucking strong? I don‚Äôt know he must be Superman fused with Batman into some sort of guy with tons of plans on how to punch you far harder than anyone else ok to end it off the Flash can GO BACK OR FORWARD IN TIME ON COMMAND. How do you beat this dude? You‚Äôre thinking you‚Äôre hashing him good, laying down the beatdown, missing your balls and suddenly BAM YOUR MOM FELL DOWN THE STAIRS TWENTY YEARS AGO and there‚Äôs a dent in your forehead and Superman not thunk so gud no more. Actually she didn‚Äôt fall down the stairs the Flash put speed into them so they fell up her! Fuck you Flash! You moved the stairs to Soviet fucking Russia! RUSH-A! Bitch. Oh, and lastly his greatest power is he isn‚Äôt fast in bed. He takes it slow and gets all the ladies with his superpowers then actually satisfies them in the sack. Who the Hell is this guy? You‚Äôd think he could AT LEAST be a premature ejaculator since his penis is moving at lightspeed but NOOOO he‚Äôs even good in bed. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Wolverine sucks cock and should go die in a freak greasefire.

**rslashpoopheads** (0): Well I had to give something the zero and this is stupid corny.

**skargardin** (0): This just doesn't work in any way, especially not as a shitty theme song, it deserves last place in this rate.

**slimboyfriend** (0): I hate this song. The Flash Gordon album is so bad because, if you don‚Äôt know, the Flash Gordon movie is bad. I can‚Äôt take any of the songs seriously because all of the songs on the Flash album retain dialogue and sound effects from the movie. This song is a prime example of how all of the songs devolve into sci-fi ridiculousness. The ‚ÄúFLASH! AHHHHHHH! He‚Äôll save everyone of us!‚Äù is so C-list 80s movie that it‚Äôs beyond comedic. It‚Äôs just dumb.

Honestly out of all the ABBA songs, this one deserves to be the lowest. It‚Äôs boring and a bit cheesy and does not scream out Greatest Hit. It seems like most people thought the same. -phoenix

---

**poppinmmolly** (7): I used to love this as a kid, now I think it is one of their weakest (at least that I've heard)

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I love the sitar use in the song, but it just bores me a bit.

---


# I believe in angels
**radiofan15** (10): The instrumental, the choir, the melody... they truly love to sexually arouse me with this bops...

**vhqv1997** (10): The synths!!

**Gews** (8): I'm an upbeat melody kind of person

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): I loved it, then hated it, now I like it a lot

# Dreaming of a better song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): cute the this production.... sis.

**Naomi1998xx** (7): I dont like abbas slow ballads as much tbh

**NuneEtsuko** (7): ,9

**rosesmp3** (7): not a big fan of children's choirs but this is ok

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Probably the most boring song on the album but still nice.

**stardustanddinos** (7): The only weak song in this collection IMO. The lyrics are very cliched.

**runaway3212** (6.8): A good song, albeit a bit naive.

**geekysheep\_** (6): i like the spanish version

**J\_Toe** (6): Yass ABBA come for The Beatles' psychadelic gig!

**skargardin** (6): This was kinda average

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): How did this song get here?

**enecks** (5): This is one of the few tracks in this I argue isn't Gold-worthy. The instrumental doesn't really develop and the musical influences feel half-baked.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): pretty boring and simple

**peppersmith67** (4.5): This song is too much. Like I imagine in the background of a Tim and Eric Skit.

**meaxiobe** (4): Worst song in their entire discography imo.

**zamomattel** (2.5): this is the corniest shit I‚Äôve ever heard

**waluigiest** (0): i HATE the synth harpsichord thing

# We stan ending racism but not this song

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.9): martin luther king who?

**letsallpoo** (7): ended mlk

**Mysario** (7): MLK's impact

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): MLK Jr teas! (Has everyone made this comment) Also this is the most Swedish they‚Äôve ever sounded..... hall√• svenska!

**bespectacIed** (3): MLK outsold

**vayyiqra** (3): This song is not what MLK Jr. died for.

A fun song about an alien pirate?? I‚Äôm not totally sure what‚Äôs going on in this song tbh, but it‚Äôs so fun and the stair step harmonies are very fun! This song was at the bottom for awhile (even though it shouldn‚Äôt have been) as well until all the 0‚Äôs came in for Flash (understandably). - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): so much fun!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): The piano is crazy here which I love. This song is kind of pointless to me though. Filler if I ever heard it.

---

# Swashbuckling

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Iconnery

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.1): credit where credit is due for that high note

**vhqv1997** (9): I kinda wanted this song to have a bit more shantie influence. There are a lot of great sea shanties that people do not know or appreciate enough. Nevertheless, this song is still an amazing rock song.

**Mysario** (8.7): unconventionally popular song

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): One of the more enjoyable listens on the album.

**enecks** (7): aaa

**waluigiest** (7): this is quite busy I am panicking

# Walk the Plank

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): I have always thought this song is overrated...

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): this one's a little all over the place but it's still a jam

**1998tweety** (6): Feels like an interlude

**vayyiqra** (6): I always liked the title of this song. The song itself isn't that great though.

**peppersmith67** (5): This and Keep Yourself Alive have always been the same song in my head im sorry.

**radiofan15** (4.8): Cute little riff and quite energetic song but also so fucking forgettable and bland...

**runaway3212** (4.5): An annoying song without a right to exist.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): what.

**skargardin** (3): I've already forgotten it, sad to say

**zamomattel** (2): wtf is this

Why do y‚Äôall hate this bop about bicycles?? I think the call and response lyrics are so fun. This is so robbed. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (8): fun! Freddie and I have a lot in common in this song. Jaws was never my scene and I don't like Star Wars either.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Lyrically I think this song is kind of dumb. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt want to listen to music about bike riding! I do like the melody though at some parts and it is sung in a super fun way.

---

# I‚Äôve been walking side to side

**bespectacIed** (10): My favorite biking song right after Biking Solo - Frank Ocean

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song is hilarious and I'm loving every second of it.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I want to ride my dickcycle

**waluigiest** (10): this is a mess but I‚Äôm wildly captivated by it. Anyways stream Bike Dream by Rostam

**Mysario** (9.5): the third best song about bicycles out there, being beaten out by Pink Floyd's "Bike" and Coheed and Cambria's "Ten Speed (of God's Blood and Burial)"

**enecks** (9): This almost got a 0 but this is so bad it's good. It can't assemble into anything other than a low-tier Grease number, but it's nonsense well-executed. Freddie Mercury can polish turds.

**Gews** (8.8): don't like Star Wars you get an 8.8

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): ok but srsly i actually don't know how to ride a bike and this song really does annoy me but it's a bop so i can't go any lower

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Literally if you didn‚Äôt randomly know this song by middle school who were you

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the way Freddie just destroyed all of white men's culture.... iconic.......

**slimboyfriend** (8): This song is so WEIRD. The instrumental ‚Äúbicycle race‚Äù in the song‚Äôs bridge is ingenious.

**vhqv1997** (8): I don't like Star Wars and Jaws either

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): it's better than the first time I listened to it

# I still use training wheels

**runaway3212** (6.8): Their song for once does not pretend to be about something and pays off but at the same time makes it feel very useless.

**stardustanddinos** (6.5): umm what

**J\_Toe** (6): prefer Brand New Key by Melanie Safka

**peppersmith67** (6): Freddy Mercury had some pretty weak hot takes here to be honest.

**rickikardashian** (5.7): I feel like this is some metaphor that I'm just not getting. Also, the chorus is the same as ‚ÄúYou say goodbye, I say hello‚Äù

**1998tweety** (5): Not a fan of this at all

**zamomattel** (5): imagine wanting to ride a bike

**NotWith10000Men** (4): idc if it was a joke, not liking star wars is a crime

**skargardin** (4): Fat-Bottomed Girls the better A-Side i said what i said

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Well....it's a song alright.

**radiofan15** (2.5): The fuck is happening at the 2 minute mark of this "song"?

**vayyiqra** (1): I can't stand this song. It's just too silly. It almost got my 0, but Crazy Little Thing Called Love exists, which barely saved it from that fate. Also, I don't trust anyone who doesn't like Star Wars at least a little.

I love this song but I understand why so many think it‚Äôs meh. It‚Äôs very simple and happy but not very interesting compared to their other songs. I feel like it‚Äôs a little bit robbed, but it isn‚Äôt totally ridiculous that it‚Äôs this low. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (9): cute!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love the chorus of eight days a week (and the phrase is fun) but I think it‚Äôs kind of forgettable otherwise.

---

# cute!

**ggodisawomann** (10): this is a classic

**runaway3212** (9.7): An ode to love in it‚Äôs purest form. Love every second of it.

**peppersmith67** (8.5): This man loves his girl so much he made up a day of the week because he wanted more time to spend with her. And EVEN THEN it's not enough to show he cares. The Beatles had gaaaaaaame.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Sang this in school at our Beatles tribute concert.... oof

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a mood, but my mood is more gay

**Mysario** (8): TIL the Beatles lived on a 21 hour a day schedule

**PointlessBibliophage** (8): one point of love for eight days a week as requested

**slimboyfriend** (8): Idk what I can say, it‚Äôs a solid pop song. I wish it was even better because I really like the opening riff.

**vhqv1997** (8): This week of mine has really felt that long

**waluigiest** (8): most of these points are for the short ‚ÄúI lo-o-o-ove you‚Äù

**radiofan15** (7.5): This is not how weeks work!

**enecks** (7): clapclap

# There are only 7 days in a week, dumb beatles

**vayyiqra** (5): sweetie God created the earth to have seven days it's all in Genesis. Read :clapping: the :clapping: Bible :clapping:

**NotWith10000Men** (4): eh just not feeling it. pretty boring. lyrics are been there done that

**zamomattel** (4): taylor taught the kids how to spell just for the Beatles to fuck it up

**bespectacIed** (2): can't even do basic math

**rslashpoopheads** (2): 8 Days of monotony in a 3 minute song.

The ONLY good thing going for this song is the harmonica, this just isn‚Äôt it otherwise I‚Äôm afraid. This is one of the only placements I firmly agree with.  - Molly 


---

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): I only like the harmonica in this, other than that it's just meh.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I just don‚Äôt like how there‚Äôs like 10 words in this song. It‚Äôs just very lazy even if it‚Äôs catchy. This initially didn‚Äôt get my 0 (Hello, Goodbye did) but compared to my other 0 choice i had, the production on this song is way weaker and makes it more boring even though lyrically they both aren‚Äôt great.

---

# I love this song.gif

**ggodisawomann** (10): love me doooo

**runaway3212** (8.6): The only thing does‚Äôt work in this song is that for a two-minute song it feels a lot longer. It can drag on, but the rest really works.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Confession, for a second I thought She Loves You was still playing

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this song title only makes me think of this image https://img.ifunny.co/images/764c12384e54e9dc35ced1931baefbac2fb371d50bdc723018202f63e31a0a2f_1.jpg

**Mysario** (8): the harmonica is nifty

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i always love a harmonica

**waluigiest** (8): STREAM LOVE ME DO

**radiofan15** (7.8): Their Bob Dylan harmonica went hard as fuck tho

**peppersmith67** (7.5): I have no clue how this became I number one hit but it's inoffensive and plot twist I like harmonica!

# There are only 17 different words in this song

**slimboyfriend** (6): ...What does the title mean?

**vayyiqra** (6): I heard of this song when I was a kid in a book where the kid in it was a rock'n'roll stan, and always wanted to hear it, and now that I have I find it underwhelming. But it's still a classic.

**enecks** (5): zzz zz me do

**zamomattel** (4): desperate fools

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Quaintly boring and repetitive. Also that harmonica is half amazing and half fuckin annoying.

**bespectacIed** (2): Those harmonicas make me wanna pull my hair out. The lyrics are so corn

Not much to say about this, really. A nice rock song, but we are decidedly anti-rock here on reddit dot com slash popheads. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (8): I did not know this song until it was in the BoRhap movie and I liked it instantly.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Not a bad song, but if you wanted a definition of 70‚Äôs rock song I feel like this would be in the dictionary. It‚Äôs pretty generic.

---

# Here I Stand

**radiofan15** (9.2): I'm gonna give a high score to this song just because it reminded me of Radiohead's *Palo Alto* and I love that song

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): NOBODY is gonna pay attention to this song because it has guitars and was essentially a deep cut everywhere except the UK, but this is one of the best examples of Queen doing a (mostly) straightforward rock song. Also, another instance of people not caring about Freddie being gay and singing ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I love HIM so?‚Äù

**enecks** (8): Alessia outsold

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Honestly this is spicy

**NotWith10000Men** (8): man i really love their older, more rocky stuff

**waluigiest** (8): this has that classic rock sound that doesn‚Äôt make me like inspired, but is a weird pleasant nostalgia

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): why is the first 40 second literally sounds like busted / jobros / demi / any other 00s Disney pop-rock songs?

**ImADudeDuh** (7): and queer!

**Mysario** (7): worst game of hide and seek ever

**PointlessBibliophage** (7): not a bad song but just not there compared to the others

# And now I‚Äôm gone

**runaway3212** (6.5): It has it‚Äôs good moments, but is mostly mediocre, though it never becomes bad.

**peppersmith67** (6): The opening of this sounded like Freddy Mercury over Jimmy Eat World and it was sick but then the rest of it was Freddy Merucury over AC/DC so eh.

**vhqv1997** (6): This song washed straight off my ears

**vayyiqra** (5): A very mediocre 70s rock song.

**zamomattel** (4.5): this is a greatest hits song???

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I've listened to this 3 times and it's just passed right through.

I could live to be 100 years old and never figure out HOW this is out so early?? This is such a bop. The melody! Is perfect! Please listen to this again. - Molly

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): This used to be my very favorite song by them. When I was in 2nd grade I sang this in front of my class for a reason I have since forgotten.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I really love the melody of the song and the pluckiness of the guitar/bass.

---

# see ya later bitches

**peppersmith67** (10): Easily my favorite of the old school Beatles tracks for channeling that classic boyish energy but with a slight musical somber twist. That guitar riff is toooooo smoooooth.

**Naomi1998xx** (9): The first Beatles song from Greatest Hits I really like tbh, Im more of a revolver/White album/Johns solo work kinda guy

**slimboyfriend** (9): This sounds like it was recorded after they discovered psychedelics, but before they made LSD their personality. It‚Äôs a great balance between heartfelt lyrics and interesting sounds.

**Mysario** (8): the only time I tried to play this was when it was just my friend and I drinking at their place and we didn't get too far into the game before I went down on them so no, I can't say I know how to play

# She said living with me is bringing her down

**runaway3212** (7.5): A worse version of Help! It‚Äôs slower and has a different chorus yet it always reminds me of Help! And it simply can‚Äôt compete.

**radiofan15** (6.5): Lamer than a late-era 13 Reasons Why episode.

**enecks** (6): charming I guess. Can we get to the weird shit already? That's the best Beatles

**waluigiest** (6): why does this sound so messy it‚Äôs just not tight, though I am a thot for rhythm changes

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): A middling Beatles song

**Gews** (4): starts yuck ends meh

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the drums are distracting me in the beginning. ringo wtf were you doing back there

**bespectacIed** (3): bored

**vayyiqra** (3): There's some weird board game with the same name as this song which is very popular in Europe. Anyway I don't like this song. I swear the drums are off time and it's so irritating I can't listen to it.

**rslashpoopheads** (2): zzzzzzz

Phoenix makes an excellent observation when she says that lots of early Beatles songs seem to be centered around how to keep your woman happy by buying her lots of expensive things. This is a good one of those, I think! - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): very cute!

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I feel like all their early songs are on the same topic, buying your girl stuff and loving her. Sometimes it works and it‚Äôs fun other times it‚Äôs just ok and forgettable. This is one of the more forgettable songs. Also why is he calling her little girl? Who call their girlfriend little girl? It just bugs me.

# I‚Äôm Feeling Great Today!

**waluigiest** (10): I fucking love the guitar. This song is hot and sweet and wet and makes me feel... more than fine

**peppersmith67** (9.5): and people say Ringo can't drum smh.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i've never heard this song before but its honestly a bop

**J\_Toe** (9): as a Beatles fan I'm surprised I haven't heard this song? I guess I spend too much time sticking with just the Blue Album. Thanks r/popheads for introducing me!

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): cause there's no one in love with me and i do not feel fine

**Mysario** (8.5): ThisIsFine.jpeg

**runaway3212** (7.5): Doesn‚Äôt really work like it should. It has this boyish vibe in how they song, but the lyrics doesn‚Äôt match with this at all.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): ok

**slimboyfriend** (7): The Beatles single-handedly invented the 90s alt rock scene with this song

# This is fine.gif

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): fine i guess lmaooo see what i did there?

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I may have actually heard this one in my childhood and then erased it from my memory. Listening to this for the rate did nothing to my memory either.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): The guitar in this song is super cool and I loved the layered vocals. I like how Freddie sings a bit softer here it‚Äôs really nice.

---

# Collect $200 as you pass go

**bespectacIed** (9): A very emotional song, Love of my Life's more angsty brother

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): With Queen, what they‚Äôre saying is almost never as important as how they sound. The lyrics here are admittedly basic, but those weird space synths and and that borderline cheesy guitar effectively get the feeling across.

**enecks** (8): Queen guitars are also good huh

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): Oh, i listened to this while alone at home and I did not like this intro.

**radiofan15** (5.6): No idea what the fuck is this song but I liked the mid-portion with all of the distorted shit happening in it... I guess i'm too dumb to appreciate Queen's genius

# Got back home safely mom

**radiofan15** (9.8): Quite more elaborate than their previous boyband stuff but still keeping that pop-rock edge, this is a cute BOP ladies

**Mysario** (9): it's the little things of this song that make me appreciate it but also makes me never wanna listen to it on purpose

**Naomi1998xx** (9): actual rock & roll rhythms, we stan a 12 bar tbh

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): They sound so happy to be breaking up

**vayyiqra** (7): This song really has a nice vibe. I always thought it was boring and low-energy, but it grew on me.

**peppersmith67** (6.5): They shoulda broke up after Abbey Road if we're gonna be real here for a second.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): i ain't feeling this song i'm sorry beatles

**enecks** (6): I am offended at how bad of a tracklist for a Beatles greatest hits this is. So many classic songs The Beatles have released - so non-classic this is. Like the people that only listened to the greatest hits must've thought The Beatles were a super patchy band that didn't really progress artistically.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Demi outpeaked

**waluigiest** (6): get back Joseph joestar

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): This reminded me they are all men so I can‚Äôt stan

**1998tweety** (3): This song is the scraps on the kitchen floor and I ain't eating it. The 1 transphobic line is very yikes though...

We are clearly not r/music. Not a fan of rock! Which is what this is. This was one of their first hits and I think it‚Äôs solid. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (9): very fun!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): All the instruments this song are fantastic! I think song really allows everyone in the band to shine.

# Staying Alive

**vhqv1997** (10): Brian's guitar never fails to amaze me. His pickings here are truly some of his best and that riff is iconic.

**Mysario** (9): too much rock for this subreddit

**NotWith10000Men** (8): iconic drum solo. i see you roger

**waluigiest** (8): this is fun and dramatic and pretty standard for them

**runaway3212** (7.2): The guitar saves it.

**J\_Toe** (7): never heard this before. :) cool

# Dead on the inside 

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I am getting very tired of this long album.

**radiofan15** (5.2): Why does most of Queen songs consists of decent hooks, good guitar riffs and nothing else worth mentioning?

**peppersmith67** (5): Freddy Mercury over Queen's more straightforward rock songs like this always feels kind of wasted. Like Boston could have written this song they don't properly utilize Freddy at all. Cool drum solo tho I'll give em that.

**vayyiqra** (5): Generally good advice to follow but a bland song.

**zamomattel** (5): no thanx

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): Just not doing it for me

As I said in the initial write up, all four members wrote songs for the band. This one was written by the [king of Twitter himself] (https://imgur.com/a/12U1Xpr) Brian May. What can I say? This is *entirely* robbed and you all have 0 taste! Just kidding. I know it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and some of the lyrics in the verses are yikes, but i just love this song. So, so much. I just needed it to go as far as it could go and this is it, as it turns out. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (11): I was working out while doing this rate and while I was doing my squats this song came on. I felt seen. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this song. It gets me going and I just wanna shake my fat bottom whenever I hear it.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This chorus is absolutely iconic. The rest of the song is just okay though.

---

# Stream Tempo by Lizzo

**vayyiqra** (11): This song is kind of ridiculous, but we are a body-positive server, so I can't be too harsh on it.

**ggodisawomann** (10): make the rockin world go ROUND

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fuck yeah. Skinny bitches do NOT stream

**letsallpoo** (10): is this lizzo - tempo

**Mysario** (10): üò≥

**vhqv1997** (10): The original All About That Bass

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.8): i never expected to like a song about attractive women but here we are

**meaxiobe** (9.5): I'd never heard this song before, but now I'm obsessed.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Freddie plays the character really well in this song. And I love how it builds with every verse.

**Gews** (8.8): may be true

**bespectacIed** (8): Ahead of its time but in retrospect this is probably just Freddie's f*g hag beard but in song form

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Cupcakke X Queen collab when?

**skargardin** (8): Banger

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): so ahead of their time. fun to sing along to

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Sir Mixalot outsold!

**zamomattel** (7.5): body positivity gods

# If this was called fat bottomed boys you would give it a 10

**rotating3Dtext** (7): the lyrics kinda make me uncomfortable idk

**rickikardashian** (6.8): They truly just decided to make an anthem in honor of thicc women

**runaway3212** (6.5): It has a lot of silence in the beginning, which is great. The verses are a three but the chorus is actually pretty okay.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): Crunchie actually stans but I just don‚Äôt like the guitar enough sorry Molly

**1998tweety** (4): I'm pretty sure it's not an issue with my headphones, but for a decent part of the song I was only hearing stuff from the right side. Not a fan of the song anyway, but that one detail dragged it down even more.

**peppersmith67** (4): The Buffalo Wild Wings of Queen songs.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (4): not my cup of tea

**waluigiest** (4): I‚Äôm just vaguely unsettled

**TragicKingdom1** (3): what's with the weird instrumental break like a minute into the song

**radiofan15** (1): Not even Noah Pedoman could have saved this song...

**enecks** (0): Imagine being protected by rockism enough that you can release a song like this and still be claimed to be a GOAT band. Deeply clunky, gimmicky, unsatisfying.

Y‚Äôall I really don‚Äôt have a single thing to say about this song. It is truly mediocre. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): used to really not like it but I'm coming around to it

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why do I think of George RR Martin when I hear this song. Literally the story of this man minus the fact he still has not put out Winds of Winter and it‚Äôs been like 9 years wyd George don‚Äôt make me rant about this while listening to the Beatles and doing this rate. Nice guitar part though.

---

# I only read real literature like War and Peace and the Bible

**enecks** (10): Savage diss to (insert bad author). For real, this is one of the best Beatles tracks. Great groove, details depicting the state of the author.

**ggodisawomann** (10): payyyypahback writttahahhhh

**peppersmith67** (10): As a former english major and wannabe novelist I relate to this song on an intense metaphysical level.

**runaway3212** (10): The A Song Of Ice And Fire of songs.

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): When someone rings my doorbell I start blastic this an open the door with my limbs flailing everywhere.

**waluigiest** (9): I learned the Beatles‚Äô music by playing drum kit on Beatles Rock Band in 8th grade and this was my favorite song to play.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.6): My mama‚Äôs favourite after Eleanor Rigby!!

**J\_Toe** (8): this sounds like The Kinks, tbh

**vayyiqra** (8): I really like this song and had it on some vinyl record as a teenager. I like when the Beatles put a little grit into their music so it doesn't get too saccharine.

**radiofan15** (7.1): It's fine I guess... I don't really have that much to say about their pre-Bigger than Jesus stuff

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): THE INTRO CAUGHT ME COMPLETELY OFF-GUARD, IT'S JARRING.

**vhqv1997** (7): Paperback > Hardcover > Kindle

# Fifty Shades of Grey is the greatest book of all time

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): love the beachy vibe but whoever is in the background going AAAHHHH bugs me

**ImADudeDuh** (6): what. is this a song about wanting to write shit? just use ArchiveOfOurOwn.com dude.

**1998tweety** (4): I feel like they intentionally make their songs difficult to listen to

**zamomattel** (1): what the actual shit

# Stan Firestar

**Mysario** (7): the last books I read were the Warriors books. You know, the ones with the cats

Honestly confused why this wasn‚Äôt even lower than it is. It‚Äôs just kinda meh to me, and it‚Äôs very simple. Many Beatles songs are simple, but this one doesn‚Äôt work as well I think. - Molly

---

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It‚Äôs decent but personally it‚Äôs just not a stand out for me.

**poppinmmolly** (7): not my favorite

---

# work, work, work, work, work , work

**ggodisawomann** (10): ofc we can

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Surprisingly sweet.

**slimboyfriend** (9): I LOVE the Beatles when they‚Äôre weird but not too weird and can do so much with a song that seems so simple.

**radiofan15** (8.8): Those circus-esque passages scared me but I really liked this

**runaway3212** (8.5): Reminds me of David Bowie in the best. It just repeats itself a lot.

**J\_Toe** (8): who sings this? it sounds different.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): no

**waluigiest** (8): every Beatles song has a rhythm/texture change passage and it‚Äôs always the best and most memorable part for me

**Mysario** (7.5): Doubt.png

**1998tweety** (7): High School Musical 2 outsold, sorry not sorry

# It‚Äôs not gonna work

**enecks** (6): Naive, but cute.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): another one that's just there

**peppersmith67** (5): Ok so story time: I remember hearing The Beatles music for the first time on a commercial for this number one hit compilation. It was the first CD I ever bought with my own money. I listened to this CD until it no longer could read in the car stereo our family wore it down that much. I know these songs like I know my old telephone number. AND I STILL DON'T REMEMBER THIS SONG.

**vayyiqra** (4): ew centrists

I feel like this is a little bit robbed. It has both elements of a great Queen song: a ballad, but then it‚Äôs an anthem! It‚Äôs the whole package, but there is *something* missing that makes it universally appealing, apparently. - Molly


---

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The vocals here! This is a really good song and underrated in their discography for sure.

**poppinmmolly** (8): I don't have a lot to say about this but I go through phases where this is a skip and right now I am in one of these phases. If this rate had happened like 4 months ago this song would have gotten a 10.

---

# God Save the Queen

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.8): solid song but the chorus kicking in with such volume made me jump so i'm just a tad angry at it

**Mysario** (9.5): BTS stans, where you at?

**radiofan15** (9.5): Cute little ballad... a little derivative of their other ballads but I liked it a lot

**stardustanddinos** (9): this is such a beautiful, vulnerable song, and so beautifully composed, shot into the stratosphere by Freddie‚Äôs incredible vocals.

**vhqv1997** (9): Naked and Far From Home: brand new show coming to a Discovery Channel near you

**rslashpoopheads** (8): save me save me SAAAAAAAAAVE MEEEEEEEEE

**slimboyfriend** (8): The ‚Äúnaked‚Äù part always takes me out of the song for a split sec. Love the bombastic chorus.

**runaway3212** (7.8): It may be that I am still pissed don‚Äôt stop me now exist, but it sounded a lot better than I remembered.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): i forgot about this one! i love the vibe change at save me save me SAAAAVE ME

**enecks** (7): It's weird that this might be one of the more pared back tracks in this.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good but i dont have anything to say about it

**waluigiest** (7): they really do everything big huh

# Naked and far from home

**peppersmith67** (6.5): The most forgettable song of the rate. At least the bad songs here are memorable.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): Kiki hates ballads, even rock ballads y‚Äôall

**vayyiqra** (4): I'm finding this very mediocre and boring, so much I can hardly believe it's Queen.

**zamomattel** (4): Nicki Minaj‚Äôs outsold

Just like a lot of their earlier songs, this is another classic beachy 60‚Äôs bop that is very repetitive and simple but fun and catchy. I mean if the formula works and is getting you number ones, why not keep doing it? But it does get stale after a while. -phoenix

---

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It‚Äôs a cute bop just a bit too repetitive for me.

# People who are glad

**ggodisawomann** (10): yeah yeah yeah

**Mysario** (10): pop-punk before pop-punk

**enecks** (9): This is one of the best early Beatles singles, but the German version is a 10.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): My parents raised me on the Beatles and Motown so like a lot of these songs I love for zero reason I‚Äôm sorry

**peppersmith67** (8.7): Another ridiculously catchy hit from The Beatlemania era. They really could do no wrong then.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): well this doesn't bode well for the beatles

**radiofan15** (8.5): Cute

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Yeah, their rhymes are weak, but it‚Äôs a cute debut with interesting vocal harmonies, and that‚Äôs really all you need for a great boy band song

**stardustanddinos** (8.5): I love this one the best of their old rock and roll songs. The drums are so heavenly.

This song has a nice melody and has an interesting contrast between sad lyrics and happy sounds, but overall it‚Äôs not a standout in ABBA‚Äôs discography unlike most their Greatest Hits. -phoenix

---

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It‚Äôs alright but this song just doesn‚Äôt grab my attention. It‚Äôs a bit filler-y on this album.

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): kinda boring

---

# All of us are crying

**enecks** (10): this song makes me cry so fucking hard i don't know why and the rest is kinda a messy rhythm that doesn't assemble a good groove but that chorus is too sad.

**peppersmith67** (8.6): I think I only really love this song because I can hear its direct influence on Japanese City Pop. if ya ever want to go down a musical rabbit hole youtube Japanese City Pop ya won't regret it!

**Mysario** (8.5): the prequel to B.O.B.'s "Both of Us" slaps

**J\_Toe** (8): this is low-key giving me 1981 Melodrama vibes? Maybe cos of Libaility's lyrics more than any sound.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i love the combination of sad lyrics and a happier vibe

**waluigiest** (8): this funky lil bassline is nice

**radiofan15** (7.6): I can't believe a Greatest Hits album have filler songs

**runaway3212** (7.2): A confusing song, but not at all a bad one. I can just never really get into it.

# All of us are dying (of boredom)

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): a bit boring

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): not a bad song but not a smash either

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I take it back, this is the most boring song on the album.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): If only I was a member of ABBA

**vayyiqra** (6): We do not accept her

And here is the other Game song! It‚Äôs another decent song that probably drags on for some people because it is a little slower (although groovy). The chorus is really good though and this song does make points about trying to figure out relationships and whether you want it to be something more. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): I once sang this at a vocal recital I loved this song so much. Something tells me it's going to be robbed.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): it‚Äôs a middling song that I do like but it‚Äôs not something I would go to first when I want to listen to ABBA.

---

# In a Steady Relationship

**bespectacIed** (10): This song is amazing but y'all need to listen to Fugees ft. A Tribe Called Quest & Busta Rhymes - Rumble In The Jungle . It's the first sample ABBA permitted (not Hung Up), Lauryn Hill did THAT.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I used to be over-the-top obssessed with this one. Low-key I still am. I can never resist singing along to it, the lyrics make my lungs breathe pure happiness. Unfortunately, the name of the game for me is always "He's straight, get over it".

**skargardin** (10): will probably get robbed

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.4): idk i just like this one less than the others

**enecks** (9): This is a little sloppy but a bit of a bop

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): quite underrated

**waluigiest** (9): god that bridge!!!!! The way they completely change the texture and get intimate is wonderful. Spooky

**zamomattel** (9): so many catchy parts

**radiofan15** (8.2): Chill little bop but quite ubsubstantial

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Sickeningly cute.

**peppersmith67** (7.3): I really like the somber production but it does get repetitive. Love the outro

# We have all lost the game (thanks a lot) 

**Mysario** (7): I just lost the game

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i like the little stripped down 'oooh oooh' part

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't get the love for this song tbh. It's just okay.

**runaway3212** (6.5): My least favourite of ABBA gold. It just dragggs on. That said it is still kinda pretty.

**ggodisawomann** (6): good but again no smash

This song is weird for Molly and I. I used to not care about this song but I love it now, and Molly doesn‚Äôt really like it anymore but used to love it. Overall I think it‚Äôs decent but definitely not one of the stronger songs on the album.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song took awhile to grow on me, but I absolutely love it now. The piano part is so amazing and I need to learn it!

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): by far my least favorite on this album. I used to LOVE this song. It used to be my favorite, actually. It isn't bad but, eh.

---

# Spanish is my favourite language!

**runaway3212** (11): The instrumentals, the vocals, the perfect combination of verse and chorus and above the lyrics is just soooo good. In all possible ways perfection.

**radiofan15** (10): They did the whole crossover thing before Shakira, Ricky Martin and J.LO were even a thing... ugh their minds.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): Very underrated.

**rickikardashian** (8.6): I have always heard to this song in spanish because of my grandma so honestly in english it just sounds wrong

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): great

**waluigiest** (8): in the chorus when they all start singing at once that‚Äôs the good shit

**bespectacIed** (7): Love the spanish guitar ish intro and the chorus, the verses are too whiny

**geekysheep\_** (7): a good cheer up song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): damn why the banana bitch so sad

# I don‚Äôt like bananas and therefore my potassium level is low

**peppersmith67** (5.5): I can't imagine the context of this song ever existing outside of a musical this is too specific it's strange.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.3): Poll, can we really classify any Swede as spicy?

**ggodisawomann** (5): I'm sorry but this song is colossally overrated

**J\_Toe** (5): He used to call me Chiquitita

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the chorus gave it an extra point

**vayyiqra** (5): What is ABBA's thing with Latin culture? Anyway this song makes me think of bananas and it's boring.

# Fire Pokemon are the best and that‚Äôs the tea

**enecks** (10): Whomst among us has changed the lyrics to Chikorita

**Mysario** (7): worse than Cyndaquil, better than Totodile

 [This was penned by drummer Roger Taylor] (https://imgur.com/a/9x8LrJP), and what a bop it is! I‚Äôm very sad this isn‚Äôt in the main rate but unfortunately this came out a few years after this greatest hits album was even released. Along with Hammer to Fall, another song that I love. 


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love this song so much. I play it all the time at my job (radio DJ)

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Invented Lady Gaga and saved the radio! But seriously this is a great song.

---

# *clap clap*

**ggodisawomann** (10): RADIO GOO GOO

**radiofan15** (10): Grand Theft Auto V teas.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i love some synths

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Oh wow this slaps. it kinda feels like a male/rock version of I Feel Love by Donna Summer with how space age-y it sounds.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): LOOOOOVE this one too

**zamomattel** (9): GTAV banger

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): I want to give this a 0 so Honey Honey wins but I just can't.

**slimboyfriend** (8): I say this about literally every Queen song, but Freddie is the one thing that keeps this song from sounding like a generic 80s synth pop song.

**waluigiest** (8): this song simultaneously says fuck popheads and gives birth to popheads. Someone explain.

# Radio Silence
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the live aid version of this is a lot rockier and i like it a lot more. plus if you watch the video there's an amazing shot from behind freddie where you can see the whole crowd clapping in unison and god i wish i had been alive for that

**peppersmith67** (1): radio poo poo

# Freddie Mercury gave us Lady Gaga, you better thank him

**J\_Toe** (10): One simple typo regarding this title gave rise to the best stage name any pop star has even performed under this century.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.8): miss stefani germanotta showed the world her taste when she picked this for her stage name

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): curious how many gaga comments this will get

**rosecoloreds** (9): invented lady gaga

**enecks** (8): Lady Gaga has at least 2 songs better than any Queen song

**sailormunelune** (7): Stefani Germanotta has left the building

**vayyiqra** (7): [YAS GAGA YOU LOOK SO GOOD OMG YAS] This song is weird. It kind of slaps, but the lyrics are odd as Queen lyrics often are. It's also much longer than it needs to be.

**vhqv1997** (7): In a parallel universe, fans of Lady Googoo are eagerly anticipating her next album after the middling reception to her fifth record, Yoanna, which was then followed by a critically acclaimed starring role in the movie A Celebrity Is Created. While it is doubtful that her next work can topple what is considered to be her magnum opus, The Reputation, fans and critics are still holding out hope that she can outdo herself on POPART and Bred This Manner.

**Mysario** (6.5): I never got the appeal of this song, sorry Artpop fans

**bespectacIed** (6): Genius said it was originally named Radio Caca. Imagine if that happened and three decades we got pop star Lady Caca instead

Molly and I agree that this song is WAY TOO DAMN HIGH. It almost made day 2 when it did not deserve to make day 2. I guess it‚Äôs catchy and what not but it‚Äôs one of the laziest songs every written imo. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (5): repetitive and the song writing is lazy!

**ignitethephoenix** (3): I like the production but wow lyrically this song is just not it. Doing polar opposites for everything is lazy and this song has no greater meaning or message (even a stupid or basic message would be better). How high were they when they wrote this honestly.

---
# I Love Opposites!

**bespectacIed** (10): One of their best songs imo. A classic no-nonsense pop song.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): You say goodbye and I say hello is just an iconic line

**radiofan15** (10): Bop that's used to teach English in primary schools... ugh their minds...

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This songs SLAPS. It‚Äôs pure happiness, especially that final coda.

**peppersmith67** (9): Flashback to my gay ass in the 5th grade giving my best friend a mixtape with this as the last song the day before he moved across the country. Hope you're having a good day Zach

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): catchy but kinda bland

**enecks** (8): Justin Beiber shooked

**Mysario** (8): a boring song until the song finally says goodbye

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments. I will not make stupid pun comments.

**waluigiest** (7): kinda nonsense but also quite pleasant

# Shut up we are not Pre-Schoolers

**runaway3212** (6.5): One of my least favourite songs of the beatles. The lyrics somehow feel lazier than those of All You Need Is Love.

**stardustanddinos** (6.5): expected kinda better lyrics from the fucking Beatles????

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): so i've heard this song covered a zillion times in commercials and i never knew it was a beatles song. the more you know

**vayyiqra** (4): I say goodbye to this middling song

**1998tweety** (0): the lyrics on this are laughably bad, I can not believe it went #1 in like 10 countries. The lack of taste and hearing

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this is really the most basic songwriting in history. Paula Abdul - Opposites Attract did it MUCH better

And this was the other song that was tied! I‚Äôm just going to say that this song is way better and had way more thought and effort put into it compared to Hello, Goodbye. But according to popheads they are equally as good so obviously that‚Äôs the correct answer.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I really like how cinematic and orchestral this is. It‚Äôs very refreshing change of pace. The fact that this was released after their breakup was very fitting here imo. It feels like the closing song to a movie, and that movie is The Beatles career.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): never one of my favorites, but it is growing on me!

---

# All the Beatles should reunite again

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wow this song definitely feels very grandiose, I kinda wish i didn't listen to this rate on shuffle so I can enjoy this song when the rate was finished.

**skargardin** (10): If yall let this flop i swear

**waluigiest** (10): I‚Äôm not sure what happened here but this track is so beautiful and so distinct. The strings are SO lush, and the writing is like melted caramel. An excellent work.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Their ballads are better [2]. This is a nice closer

**radiofan15** (9.5): I don't want any poophead disrespecting this cute ballad.

**peppersmith67** (9): I'm such a sucker for this kind of production and Paul sounds LOVELY on it. Wild how the sequencing on the Beatles' greatest hits comp flows better than most any album released in 2019. Perfect closer.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): A blissfully sorrowful melody that reaches an... uneventful conclusion. Truly an example of the journey being more meaningful than the destination.

**Mysario** (8): I hate hate hate hate hate all the extra instruments in this, but the "Let It Be... Naked" version is probably my favourite verson of this as it strips it down to its core where it can be appreciated as a good song as opposed to a bloated mess

**runaway3212** (7.8): A tad too sentimental but well intentioned so you can‚Äôt get too mad at it.

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.7): ok song

**vayyiqra** (7): I feel like the late 60s and early 70s were a peak time for lush ballads with full orchestration. Still, I think Let It Be is a much better closer for this album and the Beatles' whole career.

**zamomattel** (7): I‚Äôm not gonna lie I was ready to write this off after disliking so many of the Beatles tunes but I enjoyed this

# I‚Äôm Glad this Rate is Over and That the Beatles Broke Up

**Gews** (6.5): like I said, intentional, and describes this rate

**bespectacIed** (6): This song title describes the beatles part of this rate

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): nothing really special but it is pretty

**enecks** (5): is this all?

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I can't think of any more comments.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): Fuck this boring ass ballad too
