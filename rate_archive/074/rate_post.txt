The Classic Greatest Hits Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/cl3mql/the_classic_greatest_hits_rate/

Hello girls, gays, grandpas and grandmas!

We’ve had enough with the pop girls. It is now time for men (and the two ladies of ABBA) to shine for once. Hello and welcome to the Classic Greatest Hits rate hosted by u/ignitethephoenix (your favorite Canadian, Fuck you, u/NapsAndNetflix!) and u/poppinmmolly (your favorite ex mod) where we pit 3 iconic bands and their biggest songs against each other to determine which song shall reign supreme. Believe it or not, this is both of our first times hosting a rate on Popheads (even though we have both been part of the community for a very long time).

So one fateful winter’s day, u/ignitethephoenix decided that it was a crime that popheads had not rated ABBA yet and was determined to make it happen. After a first unsuccessful attempt of submitting a greatest hits rate idea of ABBA, Queen, and Madonna, she tried again swapping out Madonna for the Beatles (in order to make all artists groups) and succeeded! She asked Molly, who loves Queen and attention, to [help her out as co-host](https://imgur.com/5HM7fWn). She was more than happy to oblige, and so here we have our first ever Greatest Hits rate! We assume most of you are here for ABBA ~~because they are the only group to have pop queens~~ (Phoenix literally put this rate together specifically for this album) but please keep an open mind and be nice to the men (even though they are trash and don’t deserve it) because they also have iconic songs that deserve lots of love and attention too!

**Gold: Greatest Hits - ABBA**

Since 1972, ABBA has been putting out bop after bop when they were formed by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They won Eurovision 1974 with the song Waterloo and shortly after that, they skyrocketed into superstardome with multiple number ones across Europe and eventually across the world (although Dancing Queen was the only #1 on the Hot 100 in the USA because once again America lacks taste). Gold: Greatest Hits is one of the most famous greatest hits albums with over 30 million copies sold worldwide, making it the 22nd best selling album of all time.

2. Knowing Me, Knowing You
3. Take a Chance On Me

**Greatest Hits - Queen**

Formed in London in 1970, the rock group Queen consists of drummer Roger Taylor, guitarist Brian May, bassist John Deacon, and lead vocals by Freddie Mercury. They released their debut album, *Queen*, in 1973 and put out albums pretty consistently for the next decade and a half. They gained international fame with *Bohemian Rhapsody* and its album *A Night At The Opera.* With anthemic rock beats and fun, lively vocals, Queen’s songs and sounds are iconic and you cannot go to a sporting event, or a karaoke bar (insert video of me screaming BoRhap with strangers last winter) without hearing one of their songs.  *Greatest Hits- Queen* was widely successful, selling 25 million copies worldwide, going 8 times platinum in the US, and it is also the best selling UK greatest hits album. All four members were songwriters and wrote some of the most identifiable, and enjoyable songs ever!

For Queen’s Greatest Hits Albums, originally we were just going to go with the regular UK version from 1980. However upon further inspection, we discovered that there is also a US/Canada version that has less songs but also 2 different songs. We both agreed that we should include those 2 additional songs (Under Pressure and Keep Yourself Alive) in order to even things out and also because they are both really good/iconic songs.

1. Bohemian Rhapsody
2. Another One Bites the Dust
3. Killer Queen
4. Fat Bottomed Girls 
5. Bicycle Race
6. You’re My Best Friend
7. Don’t Stop Me Now
8. Save Me
9. Crazy Little Thing Called Love
10. Somebody to Love
11. Now I’m Here
12. Good Old-Fashioned Loverboy
13. Play the Game
14. Flash
15. Seven Seas of Rhye
16. We Will Rock You
17. We Are the Champions
18. Keep Yourself Alive
19. Under Pressure

**20 Greatest Hits - The Beatles**

The Beatles are known to be one of the most influential musicians of all time since their inception as a group in 1960. The Beatles consisted of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr (there’s also the 5th Beatle(s) but that’s for another day). Love them or love to hate them, The Beatles have been inspiring and influencing pop music (and most of your favourite artists) for more than 50 years now. Their first hit “Love Me Do” was released in 1962 and from there onwards they released hit after hit until their break up in 1970. 

Just like Queen, there are two different versions to this Greatest Hits album which came out in 1982, 20 years after the release of their first song. We decided to go with the US version, because most of us are North American (sorry Eurotrash). This album actually isn’t available online, and the current greatests hits album that’s on streaming platforms is 1 (which was a bit too long for this rate). 

1. She Loves You
2. Love Me Do
3. I Want to Hold Your Hand
4. Can’t Buy Me Love
5. A Hard Day’s Night
6. I Feel Fine
7. Eight Days a Week
8. Ticket to Ride
9. Help!
10. Yesterday
11. We Can Work It Out
12. Paperback Writer
13. Penny Lane
14. All You Need is Love
15. Hello, Goodbye
16. Hey Jude
17. Get Back
18. Come Together
19. Let It Be
20. The Long and Winding Road

**Bonus Rate:**

Since these are all legendary bands that we do not rate often, we decided to include some other classics that are our favourites that were robbed from being on these greatest hits album/are on other versions of the greatest hits albums.

ABBA

1. [Angel Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=728c7L_WjxQ&frags=pl%2Cwn)
2. [Honey, Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j6OI9TxqzI&frags=pl%2Cwn)

Queen

1. [I Want To Break Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ&frags=pl%2Cwn)
2. [Radio Ga Ga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azdwsXLmrHE&frags=pl%2Cwn)

The Beatles

1. [Eleanor Rigby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y&frags=pl%2Cwn)
2. [Blackbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Man4Xw8Xypo&frags=pl%2Cwn)

**The Rules**

Y’all probably know how this goes, but maybe you’re new here and need a run down of the rules:

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine so long as it is to only 1 decimal place. Ex) 5.2 is okay, but a 3.69 is not.
* You have to rate **every** song in the main rate. For the bonus rate feel free to rate as many or as little songs as you want (but you’ll want to do the bonus rate because we carefully hand picked some bops)
* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential, feel free to share them, campaign for your favorite song to win. You will probably be bullied for them. 
* You may give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favorite tracks.You **must** leave a comment for these explaining your ranking so we know you’re not rigging. Keep in mind you do not HAVE to give an 11 or a 0 (but there are tons of 11s and not many 0s in this rate). You cannot give an 11 or a 0 to the bonus rate songs.
* You HAVE to do this rate with your dad ~~or else you will be disqualified~~
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM u/poppinmmolly or u/ignitethephoenix again afterwards.
* Make sure you use the prepared link that can be found at the top and bottom of this post ~~(choose whichever one you relate to more)~~

**Here is how to format your shit:**

Bicycle Race: 0 I never learned how to ride a bike and this song is oppressing me 

**Here is how NOT to format your shit:**

Waterloo: I’m giving it a 10 because it’s a bop!! 

Bohemian Rhapsody - 9.9 The greatest song of all time only behind the [Kidz Bop cover of 7 Rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huo8VA1xWhs&frags=pl%2Cwn)

Help!: 0: Taylor Swift did exclamation point songs better 

Mamma Mia 10 Ended Mario and Luigi

This is the *only* way your comments should be formatted, any other way is incorrect and would ruin everything and I would cry. Is that what you want?
