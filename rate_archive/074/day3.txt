This is another big bop however I get why some people wouldn’t love this. Happy this made day 3 though although some people will find this robbed. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): There are about 5 ABBA songs that constantly battle each other to be my favorite and this is one of them. This is so fun!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song has always been a super fun one lyrically and musically. You would think chanting “take a chance” in the background wouldn’t work, but it fits in perfectly.

---

# Honey I’m still free

**ggodisawomann** (10): IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND

**J\_Toe** (10): OMG this song appeared on the 2008 hit comedy movie Get Smart!

**Mysario** (10): back in high school, some people from the chorus group got together and did an acapella version of this to help ask someone out for prom. I thought it was the sweetest thing! Then I saw they took that from The Office. Good looks to you, boner champ!

**radiofan15** (10): A WIG SCALPER RIGHT HERE LADIES!

**rosesmp3** (10): a banger a bop a masterpiece

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): The song is just so euphoric

**waluigiest** (10): idk if they did this on glee but they absolutely should have. If this had been the New Directions’ definitive hit over Don’t Stop Believin, it would have been a good show.

**Gews** (9.5): sooo welcome

**bespectacIed** (9): love this "pick me" song

**enecks** (9): Shoutout to all the monopoly games I ruined by singing this in certain moments

**geekysheep\_** (9): big bop

**Naomi1998xx** (9): Trashy white disco with a TUBA doing a polka bass, I love it

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): The vocal layering weaves between my fave thing ever and kind of annoying lol, but I still think it’s the embodiment of excellence

**vhqv1997** (8): This song barely had verses but for some reason it never felt repetitive

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Unfortunately my personal anthem in this rate.

**runaway3212** (7.3): I don’t know why I don’t like this one that much but it never really worked for me.

**vayyiqra** (7): The repetitive vocals annoy me, but once it kicks in it's a solid pop song I guess.

# you should change your mind

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its kinda weird but idk if im completely onboard with it.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the very beginning is supes annoying and it doesn't get a whole lot better

**zamomattel** (5): have to dock points as this is the start song of the fucking dreadful ABBA megamix

# See you in r/popheads court

**skargardin** (10): If this doesn't make it to the top ten i am SUING

This is one of my favourite ABBA songs and I am very glad it made day 3. Like Molly mentions, it’s a belter. But I guess not everyone felt the same way we did about this song. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another personal favorite of mine! I think it has a great melody and it’s always a treat to listen to.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a great song to belt in your car!

---

# ABBA outsold

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my 11 contenders and my favorite ABBA song alongside Mamma Mia. Just an all-around perfect pop song

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Soul-obliterating song.

**enecks** (10): If yáll bitches complain about Pierce Brosnan's cover of this, you haven't thought about the appeal of Mamma Mia enough - that it's karaoke with the thinnest of plots. What's a round of karaoke without one person trying very hard and failing miserably? Also, this is one of ABBA's best songs i gueess

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Hands down my favorite ABBA song.

**radiofan15** (10): God... the arrangement, the vocals, the writing, the melancholy in her delivery, the BRIDGE... and people dare to say the perfect pop song doesn't exist

**slimboyfriend** (10): You’d think the drastic shift from the verses to the choruses wouldn’t work, but it’s ABBA! Everything is perfect!

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): love it

**geekysheep\_** (8.5): oof

**peppersmith67** (8): Yes, a kick ass chorus can elevate an eh song to a GREAT one.

**skargardin** (8): The hook is a bit.. worse and more fast-paced than i remember? Still a great song

**waluigiest** (8): kinda like a really mad piano etude


**runaway3212** (7.4): It is good, the chorus just never develops towards something truly grand.

# SOS I’m dying

**vayyiqra** (7): Did you know the standard distress call was CQD before SOS, and the Titanic used both as it sank? Just a random fact I know.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): i like the chorus but it feels really different from the opening verses

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): I don’t wike it sorry

# Rihanna drop a new album challenge

**letsallpoo** (11): ended rihanna

**J\_Toe** (10): Rihanna is shaking

**ggodisawomann** (10): SOS PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR ME TO FEEL THIS WAY

**1998tweety** (8.5): Rihanna outsold

**zamomattel** (7): Rihanna outsold but this is cute

# Joe is the hottest brother I said what I said

**Mysario** (8.5): so this is where the story ends, a conversation on I-M - well I'm done, we're texting, sorry for the miscommuni-KAYTSSHION

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Jonas Brothers outsold!

Invented drag!! This is a fantastic song and if ONLY it had been written/recorded earlier I have no doubt it would have been on the greatest hits album ugh. Simply amazing. 


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my all time favourite Queen songs! Also the music video is so iconic that it that the conservatives in the States were shaking at the thought of men wearing dresses! We stan.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a big FAT 10. The music video is iconic.

---

# We’re soaring, flying

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic

**enecks** (10): THAT gay anthem.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I would give this my 11 in the main rate if I could. this is a sin to not be on their greatest hits

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking gay anthem. that music video, we have to fucking STAN if this doesnt win the bonus rate, i will be upset

**J\_Toe** (10): with it's queer context, is so odd that this song wasn't written/made by Freddie.

**Mysario** (10): in their very diverse library of tracks, this remains one of Queen's best as its sadly overshadowed by many of their other songs

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I'm not saying the music video awakened something in me as a child... but all the members of Queen really serve in drag.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): LOOOOVE this one

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is better than most Queen songs in the main rate, what is it doing here?

**waluigiest** (9): ugh YES the synth bridge gives me so much life

**bespectacIed** (8): While Fat Bottomed Girls is Freddie's fg hag song, I Want To Break Free is his fg song

**NotWith10000Men** (8): go watch the music video!!!

# Contained

**radiofan15** (7.6): Cute video but this is the kind of song that deserves to be performed with all of the energy.

**vayyiqra** (7): "Aha, finally, a Queen song which is definitely a covert gay anthem by Freddie - nope, also written by John Deacon". They do crossdress in the video though, so make what you will of that.

**zamomattel** (6.5): the MV invented drag and the song itself is also okay

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

Possibly the most iconic bass line of any song. It’s just so catchy and GOOD. I stan this song so hard. 


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The bass line is so so good! One of my favourites from Queen for sure.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this bass line really gets me going folks. I can listen to this song 5 times in a row and not get bored solely because I love this bass line so much.

---

# DJ Khaled bites the dust

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Most iconic bassline of all time, bar NADA

**ggodisawomann** (10): hey hey

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Just..... phew

**Mysario** (10): another one bites my nuts

**Naomi1998xx** (10): Again Iconic, groovy as fuck, play it waaay more than bohemian rhapsody becuase its fun to bop along to

**radiofan15** (10): The bass is killer, the melody is catchy, the charisma is almost overwhelming... what's not to like?

**vhqv1997** (10): Suggestion for the rate host: play this song every time a song is eliminated, including after it has been eliminated itself.

**enecks** (9): Minimalist to a fault almost, but when it clicks it's like a clockwork calculator - you can see how it works. Also, JOJO HYPE.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Y'all remember on disney channel when they would have that music video of this with that old football goofy cartoon.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): man freddie's voice is so damn cool on this one. this whole song is so cool

**waluigiest** (9): yes a funky lil thing I love this

**peppersmith67** (8.8): or "how a bassline can single handedly carry an entire song."

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): They came for the CLOUGHB with this one.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The bass is iconic. The guitar parts are also pretty cool.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): fun

# I do not consume dust

**runaway3212** (7.7): A good song completely saved by the base line.

**J\_Toe** (7): oh hey, this song made a cameo in Gwen Stefani's hit single "Hollaback Girl".

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Iconic but actually not that interesting of a song.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): feels underdeveloped, the bassline is all it has going for it

**vayyiqra** (6): While the bass riff is iconic, this song is awfully thin and has worn out its welcome to me.

She’s a kilLAH quuuEEEENNN. Great song. This is appropriately ranked I think. It almost was a day 2 song as well until the last few ballots. 


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love how playful this song is (especially Freddie’s vocal’s). I don’t think this is underrated to fans, but I personally think it is to the casual Queen listener.

**poppinmmolly** (9): this song makes 0 sense but it is great! 5 Seconds Of Summer does a really good cover of this.

---

# Dynamite with a laser beam

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my 11s in the rate. This is just an explosion of imagery. Freddie said "guaranteed to blow your mind" and guess what mimi, it did.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Wow I really am inexcusably illiterate. I had no idea this banger was a Queen song. :clown:

**enecks** (10): The best Queen song, by far. I nearly gave this a 11 just to show how much I prefer this to other Queen songs. Killer queen has already touched this song, because it is bomb.

**ExtraEater** (10): best recorded instance of someone saying "Antoinette"

**ggodisawomann** (10): she keeps moet et chandon in her pretty cabinet (I gotta say, 5SOS's cover of this is phenomenal too)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking iconic. wish the ending was better, but the hook is one of the best in the rate

**Mysario** (10): the delivery and instruments in this song are so well done, you could say they're killer ha ha ha

**NuneEtsuko** (10): I feel so fancy singing along this song, one of my all-time favorites.

**peppersmith67** (10): So much personality and swagger. Easily my favorite use of guitar on any song in the rate I wish the outro lick lasted for 4 minutes.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this slaps

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.4): I literally have Marie Antoinette’s death day in my Google calendar as a yearly holiday and have had it in there since I was 14 so

**vhqv1997** (9): Katy Perry wanted to do music because of this song, so if you still jam to Never Really Over or California Gurls, you better not pay this song dust

**J\_Toe** (8): https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Killer_Queen

**slimboyfriend** (8): Despite hearing it a thousand times, I still really like this song.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is very much the campy side of Queen, but it's catchy and has some clever wordplay.

**waluigiest** (8): I’m really into their theatrical style of rock. This is fun and well written

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the lyics to this are wild. like who puts gelatin in a song

**runaway3212** (7.3): Better than most Queen’s song, held down by the chorus but for the most part it works.

# I must decline the invitation thank you

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Sounds like a musical.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): a bit overrated

**radiofan15** (6.5): MEH

**Naomi1998xx** (6): Not their best tbh

**skargardin** (6): Never heard this before, it's kinda average as far as Queen songs go

As I said in my comment below, this is the song that inspired my dad to become a musician. For that reason this song has always been very special for my family and I. The fact that this isn’t in the top 10...is disgraceful! You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Get your life together. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the most gorgeous songs by them! Paul’s solo vocals here are great and I love how simple but effective it is. This will forever be a classic.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song inspired my dad to become a musician!

---

# All my troubles are far away

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Iconique.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh this is very sad and cute

**J\_Toe** (10): oof, this is one of my top 3 Beatles songs but I already gave Bohemian Rhapsody my 11

**Mysario** (10): a world without cigarettes and Coca-Cola is a world I would like to live in

**radiofan15** (10): There's a reason why this is the most played song on radio of all time.

**vayyiqra** (10): :pensive: I've always loved this song. It's just beautiful.

**waluigiest** (10): stunning writing, melodies, and performance. The 7 bar phrases never fail to impress me

**runaway3212** (9.2): Great. As dramatic as it is lyrically awesome.

**enecks** (9): This is a 10/10 melody, but I docked a point for the dumbass movie.

**ggodisawomann** (9): a lil overrated but good

**Naomi1998xx** (9): Its brilliant, its sad as fuck, Johns in his feels, theres a string section, yesss

**peppersmith67** (9): Blackbird>>>Yesterday but still a kick ass ballad.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Really paved the way for Hilary Duff’s 2003 hit song “So Yesterday.”

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): I heard this loads when I was younger. I still like it now.

**zamomattel** (9): sad boi anthem

**1998tweety** (8.5): Their ballads are more tolerable than their other songs.

**Gews** (8.5): see

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): Fuck they Got Me

# I believe in tomorrow only

**vhqv1997** (7): I like this song enough, but I have no idea why this became one of their biggest hits and probably their most iconic song. I mean it's really simple, with not too much going on, so I suppose it's because of its minimalist yet still emotionally potent approach? I don't know, I just don't feel like this song is so interesting that it should be the song they're best remembered for.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it's cute

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I thought I liked the Beatles but this album is such a snoozer.

**bespectacIed** (3): Probably the single most popular song of all time who have been sung and covered by the most people in history. It's a dud.

A classic goes out at #12 due to it being a ballad (pretends to be shocked). . 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is definitely another one of the most gorgeous Beatles songs. I love how it’s a ballad but has rocky guitar parts thrown in.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is a fantastic song and its scene in Across The Universe is also fantastic.

---

# Speaking words of wisdom

**1998tweety** (10): I'm kind of shook at this, it's actually quite good. Mayhaps their best song

**enecks** (10): This is the most moving Beatles song.

**Gews** (10): definitely intentional

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Idk, this song is just comforting to me. like it definitely feels like this emoji https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/500835139551494145.png?v=1

**Mysario** (10): not my personal fave but this is far and away the best Beatles song

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): hands down

**radiofan15** (10): THAT WAS A CLASSIC, THAT WAS A CLASSIC!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): The Beatles' other opum magnus.

**vayyiqra** (10): My dad used to sing this when I was a kid :pensive:

**vhqv1997** (10): My previous go-to karaoke song, it's not now because so many people know this song that whenever I pick it, some others just join in uninvited and ruin my solo

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Powerful, but it hits just a little bit off the bullsye for me.

**Naomi1998xx** (9): OK by this rate I dont like The Beatles as much as Queen or ABBA, but the truth is the beatles songs I like arent on the greatest hits. Rockey Raccoon, Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds, Tomorrow never Dies & a day in the life.

**waluigiest** (8): excellent. Middle school talent shows remain shook.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): an extra point just for the guitar solo

**runaway3212** (7): Sweeter than honey, vague beyond reason. All in All not great. Not terrible either though

# In troubled times

**peppersmith67** (6.8): This entire album does nothing for me.

**slimboyfriend** (6): This is one of the songs where I can’t stand Paul McCartney’s overly earnest lyrics

**bespectacIed** (5): an iconic but a meh song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): Fuck a ballad even with drums

This song just missed the top 10 and I am mad! It was actually number one early in the rate ~~but then the haters came through~~. But I am glad it did place higher because it is a big underrated bop and I’m glad most people recognized that (although if it was like a minute shorter it would have placed higher imo). 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This is honestly the biggest bop ABBA has ever given us. Dancing Queen who? This song deserves all the attention Dancing Queen (a song I love) gets.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): This was so highly rated at the start. Why? It's fine but...why?

---

# J'adore cette chanson

**CarlieScion** (11): this is such a fun bop oml

**didney-worl** (10): Incredible song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I vow to play this song when I'll be about to answer the "This Norwegian pop act is responsible for the creation of the massive global hit 'Take On Me'." prompt on Jeopardy.

**enecks** (10): In terms of no shit ass-slapping ABBA songs, this is my go-to when I've overdone the Madonna. It's got this real sense of groove and escalation. Also this sounds like a Bowser level.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I have such a hardon for this song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Comment dit-on.... ceci est le grand sexy

**J\_Toe** (10): not to be confused with Vol-au-vent

**NotWith10000Men** (10): hell yeah disco i am INTO IT

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): cette chanson m'a appris le francais

**radiofan15** (10): Such a showstopper in ever sense of the word

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): DISCO

**peppersmith67** (9.5): Never heard of this before the rate and I'm kicking myself for never discovering this until now. Definition of a bop

**runaway3212** (9.5): The chorus is awesome. The verses are great. All in all exactly between a nine and a ten.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Formerly my favorite song on the album.

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a bop and a half. I heard it as a teenager and it took me years to track it down and figure out it was by ABBA. Now I'm glad I did, because it slaps.

**waluigiest** (9): this paved the way for Vroom Vroom. I will not explain my thinking.

**Mysario** (8.5): goes on slightly too long for me to thoroughly enjoy

**zamomattel** (7.5): disco queens

And here we have the first song of the top 10, and the second to last Beatles song out! A later era Beatles song (that was already rated in another rate) a lot of people like this song to some extent compared to most of the other Beatles songs. It a weird one, but still a classic. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): a big bop despite making 0 sense.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love the different musical elements this song has! It’s a bit of a weird song but I like it for some reason.

---

# We are all in this together

**bespectacIed** (10): Top 3 best Beatles song ever. Everything about it screams lush and expensive.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My definite favorite of theirs, it's so catchy, and yet quite simple. The schwoorp is hilarious and brings this song its immediately recognizable character. Also, I may just be a sucker for drum-dominated instrumentals, I don't know.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): As mentioned before, in my top three Beatles songs!!! Idk why I even love it so.... maybe how ridiculous it is? Sonic candy?

**J\_Toe** (10): tbh I wish this rate had more late Beatles :9. Like, it's not OP's fault cos this is literally their Greatest Hits album. But one can dream.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Favorite Beatles song even though it does not make sense whatsoever.

**peppersmith67** (10): easily the most sonically unique Beatles song of the rate. Has no business being as catchy as it is.

**Mysario** (9.5): :kisskiss

**zamomattel** (9.5): their sexy moment

**radiofan15** (9.2): MJ outsold but this is cute too

**rslashpoopheads** (9): SHU

**runaway3212** (8.5): This song has such a similar base to The Story Of O.J. It still absolutely rocks every second.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): It’s a TRAVESTY that this is the only song from their best album.

**1998tweety** (8): This is interesting in a good way

**NotWith10000Men** (8): yes. guitar. need more. love guitar.

**vayyiqra** (8): I always found this song fascinating. It's so bizarre, both musically and lyrically, and weirdly catchy. Who is old flattop? Why (and how) does he shoot Cola-Cola? Why do the Beatles feel the need to teach us basic arithmetic? The world wonders.

**waluigiest** (8): their transition from their early music to abbey road is quite wild
# gotta be a joker

**enecks** (7): Weird but slaps.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): i can't explain it but these songs are not sticking with my brain

# let’s not forget about the Beatles inventing circlejerking

**vhqv1997** (10): Mutual masturbation song. And no, I'm not kidding. Paul McCartney straight up said The Beatles used to have group masturbation sessions. And yes, you read that right. Just dudes being dudes. Source: https://ultimateclassicrock.com/paul-mccartney-john-lennon-masturbate/

And here is the song that started it all! Well it’s not their first song but the first major hit and introduced everyone to them in Eurovision! It’s a bop and deserves to be in the top 10.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song absolutely deserved to be the winner of Eurovision. It’s the most iconic thing to come out of it and literally made them a thing! Plus it’s insanely catchy and fun!

**poppinmmolly** (10): For those of you who don't know, I'm from Iowa. There is a city in Iowa named Waterloo and when I was little I thought ABBA wrote this song about Waterloo, Iowa. They did not, as it turns out.

---

# Eurovision icons

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic eurovision anthem

**enecks** (10): hey it's the best song in Eurovision history. Hell, this is way tighter than most of the songs they made since.

**geekysheep\_** (10): very fun

**ggodisawomann** (10): shoutout to Eurovision for giving us this

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Honest to god...... is this even ALLOWED

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yasss fuck the french

**meaxiobe** (10): A very close contender for my 11.

**Mysario** (10): might be my fave ABBA song, it's just so saxy!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): eurovision died the year this song was entered because no other song will ever encapsulate the spirit of that competition so well

**radiofan15** (10): That was a classic, that was a classic

**runaway3212** (10): What started it all is unsurprising on of their best song. It has it all and is still catchy with an incredible hook.

**vayyiqra** (10): Wellington outsold but this is still one of the greatest pop songs ever written. Did you know Napoleon wasn't as short as he is portrayed? This song is short though, but it's perfect the way it is.

**Gews** (9.8): thank you for the music

**1998tweety** (9.5): Bop, a school I almost went to.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): *whitney houston voice* Ahh ☝️☝️ that's history. Literally. Most iconic eurovision song.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The biggest breakthrough to have ever come out of Eurovision. Arguably the best Eurovision entry ever. A lot of things have been said about this song over the years, and I'm not articulate enough to contribute anything meaningful. But then again neither is this song.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Eurovision outsold!

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): The song is so fun

**peppersmith67** (8.7): The little stabs of acoustic guitar thrown in randomly is such a stunt and they're just showing off with the saxophone.

**J\_Toe** (8): it's good, but ABBA definitely improved over time.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i really love the instruments in this one

**vhqv1997** (8): Historian queens

# Defeated and lost the war

**waluigiest** (7): the melody and chords are stunning. I really don’t care for the extended metaphor of a woman being conquered tho.

And this is the last Beatles song out of the rate. I think lots of people love this song but think it just goes on too long. It’s a classic sing along song with an interesting backstory ~~fuck John Lennon~~ and even though personally it’s not my top Beatles song here, I think it’s deserving of being the top one in the rate.


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is really, really basic I know but this may be my favorite Beatles song. It's so sweet.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This is a great song but it’s definitely like 2 minutes too long. Those last 2 minutes really should be cut out. It would be a 10 if they did that.

---

# Making it better

**TragicKingdom1** (11): simply put, an anthem. it played in my history of popular music class this semester and you could visibly tell people were trying not to sing along lol

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The only thing I can say about this is that I'm surprised it's over 7 minutes long and somehow it doesn't feel drawn out at all.

**Gews** (10): oh so the order was intentional?

**ggodisawomann** (10): I love this one sm

**ImADudeDuh** (10): More like, Hey DUDE! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

**J\_Toe** (10): omg my primary school band had to play this song and I'm still sometimes haunted by the sound of 50 poorly-tuned brass instruments attempting this song.

**radiofan15** (10): Komm, SÃ¼sser Tod outsold but this is great too!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): The Beatles' opum magnus.

**runaway3212** (10): Encouraging, Loving and Amazing. Lyrics that are Sweet and Simple. The high point for the Beatles.

**slimboyfriend** (10): My favorite Beatles songs embody the magic of childhood, and even though this one is long, it gets the job done.

**stardustanddinos** (10): might just be one of the most euphoric songs and outros ever. Cultural impact and karaoke aside, it is simple, touching and just a testament to happiness.

**vhqv1997** (10): Can you believe this song, in all of its 7-minute glory, actually topped both the British and American music charts and also became their most successful single in America? Their power, my God...

**waluigiest** (10): this song makes me cry I love it so much they popped off here

**Mysario** (9.5): legendary tune but wow, this didn't need to be 7 min long for any reason at all

**rickikardashian** (9.5): -.5 because honestly this could be like 3 minutes and a half shorter

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.1): My mom named a whole ass cat after this song. (Also: does anyone else’s dad sing the ‘Hey dude / I saw you nude / Don’t try to fake it / I saw you naked’ parody? Or just my wack dad?)

**1998tweety** (9): I've been told this is good and that's it's one of their better songs, and while I do find it significantly better than all the other songs I've listened to here, I still wouldn't put it at a 10.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): points mostly for outro

**bespectacIed** (8): Very whiny. Iconic song but I don't see the appeal. Godly outro tho.

**Naomi1998xx** (8): It just goes on for too long tbh.

**peppersmith67** (8): The most overrated Beatles song isn't even a bad song.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): okay this one i do get the hype behind.

# Making it worse

**meaxiobe** (6.5): My score would have been a lot higher if the song had been 3 or 4 minutes shorter.

**enecks** (5): I averaged the 0 and 10 scores I would give to this. It's a 0 when it's a drunken singalong because it's so overlong holy fuck and it drags. It's a 10 when in the right mindframe.

**zamomattel** (3.5): soo dreary

**vayyiqra** (3): I don't really like this song. It starts nice, but it goes on WAY TOO LONG and by the end that insipid "na na na ..." refrain fills me with rage. The beginning is fine, but the coda did not need to be four fucking minutes long.

ignitethephoenix: # The Beatles: 20 Greatest Hits

---

**Overall Average**: 7.820 **// Average Controversy:** 1.721

---

**Mysario** (8.825): although they're all iconic bops, calling them the "twenty greatest hits" is very subjective

**radiofan15** (8.620): There's some key material here missing, but even if i'm not the biggest fan of their pre-Bigger than Jesus stuff, I still can't deny how generally strong most of these songs are. [Score: A-]

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.450): I listened to a bit of Beatles growing up. Surprisingly, I haven't heard most of these songs until doing this rate. I feel like this would've gotten a higher average from me if songs like Michelle, When I'm 64 or Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da were on here instead of some of the less memorable entries.

**slimboyfriend** (8.250): Listening to this album is so weird because most of the songs on here are very good essential Beatles songs, but I wouldn’t say they’re my favorite Beatles songs, or even the best. This isn’t even the best Beatles Greatest Hits album.

**stardustanddinos** (8.175): the Beatles are not singles artists – this is my hot take. The 20 songs here are not among their best (or my favourites), and their full albums are better statements than their singles – that this collection doesn’t have songs from the White Album, Sarge Peppers, Revolver and Rubber Soul is straight up baffling. But the songs here are decent, and I’ve given them a fair rating. Beatles created the ENTIRE landscape of rock and pop music as it exists, and for that itself their mythos and history must be appreciated by every pop listener.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.465): Throwback to June when I found out my best friend’s BF is a Beatles fan and was trying to talk Beatles to him and he guessed Hey Jude or Here Comes The Sun is my fave Beatles song.... you dumb BITCH JACKSON, it’s ELEANOR RIGBY followed by COME TOGETHER then HERE COMES THE SUN which is a GREAT SONG I WILL NOT APOLOGISE FOR BEING CORRECT

**vayyiqra** (6.450): I have mixed feelings about the Beatles like I do with everyone in this rate. I find their early work boring and their later work can get pretentious, but they had undeniable moments of genius. I still hate John Lennon though and think he's the only one in this rate who was truly, perhaps irredeemably, trash. I don't even like his singing voice, but McCartney's songwriting talent made up for it, and George's creativity, and Ringo was ... there. (Jk I think Ringo is very underrated as both a musician and a contributor to the band)

**bespectacIed** (5.000): The Beatles is my least favorite of the three groups in this rate, and I'm going in this rate knowing fully I'm gonna underrate them. Yeah they're the most successful music act of all time but to me they will always be four mediocre, entitled, problematic yt guys with lazy rhyming and grating voices, who from time to time, make some fluke AMAZING god-tier songs in their final years. This greatest hits compilation doesn't do their discography justice :(

One time I sang this at karaoke with a complete stranger and the entire bar lost their minds screaming along. It was SO much fun. This song definitely deserves this spot in the top 10! Harmonies are perfect. Vocal performance is perfect. This song is PERFECT.


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The arrangement of this song is so perfect. I absolutely love the choir feel of this song, the build up at the end is so amazing, with Freddie’s voice capping it off with some cool vocals stuff. Probably the 2nd most iconic Queen song behind Bohemian Rhapsody.

**poppinmmolly** (10): god fucking damn it. This was almost my 11. I love it so much, this is a near perfect song.

---

# People to love

**NotWith10000Men** (11): easiest 11 i've ever given out. freddie's voice. the piano. the backing chorus. brian's guitar solo. roger's drums. john pretending to sing. just when you think it's over NOPE WE'RE COMING BACK FOR MORE

**static\_int\_husp** (11): My favorite Queen song, and possibly my favorite song period. The emotion is so drawn out and melodramatic that it almost feels like a joke at some points. But it is so heartfealt, and the climax of the song with multiple voices chanting "find. me. some-BAH-dy to looovvee" is so powerful and cathartic whenever I'm deep in my feelings. Gosh I love this so much.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my 11 contenders. This is just a cinematic masterpiece of a song. It makes you feel a complex range of emotions and leaves you crying at the climax goddamnit can anybody find me somebody to love, too

**CarlieScion** (10): nearly my 11

**enecks** (10): WE SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO HAPPY FEET WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE - OVERTHROW RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND POLLUTING CORPORATIONS WHILE WE STILL HAVE THE CHANCE.

**ggodisawomann** (10): somebody toooooooooooo laaaahhhvvv

**J\_Toe** (10): lol when I was in primary school I was in a short-lived all-boys choir and this was the only song we rehearsed before we dissolved. I think this song was chosen cos it just appeared in Happy Feet?

**Mysario** (10): better than Jefferson Airplane, worse than Justin Bieber

**peppersmith67** (10): A great ballad until the acapella buildup and Freddy's vocal solo before the outro elevate it to the damn heavens it's so gorgeous.

**radiofan15** (10): Michael-Jackson-I-LOVE-THIS-SONG.jpg

**rosecoloreds** (10): peak gay loneliness

**slimboyfriend** (10): You just know Freddie was getting his little queer life recording this song. It also takes on a new meaning for me in adulthood, thinking about finding lifelong love, and also thinking of how Freddie must have thought about the possibility of finding and deserving love as a bisexual man in the 1970s.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): My second fav Queen song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.7): another big mood fuck i'm lonely

**rslashpoopheads** (9): One of my favorites.

**vayyiqra** (8): What a mood :pensive:

# You should go and love yourself bitch

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i like the harmonies but that's about it? i don't really find much noteworthy about this

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): I don’t know how I feel about this song so it’s the middle rating

**waluigiest** (5): this song makes me feel like I am physically falling for 4.5 minutes straight

**runaway3212** (4): The intro sounds like a Disney song, the rest sound like a very desperate song, which was obviously intended, but I just don’t enjoy it.

Well...before this rate began I was very sure this would be an easy winner. However as the scores came in, everyone seemed to agree that this would be the easy winner and that it was going to be overrated! So they dropped their scores down lower than where they would actually rank it!  And that’s how it ended up missing the top 5! I still absolutely love this song, it deserves to be a smash and the only #1 ABBA hit in the USA. Also this song is amazing to listen to on a stereo rather than your headphones! Would recommend doing that if you had the chance!

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): It kind of sucks that this their most well known song (cause they have so many other great songs) but it’s pretty much flawless! The production is wonderful and it’s just so easy to sing along to it!

**poppinmmolly** (8): I really don't want this to win because it's predictable but I really can't give this less than an 8. It really is fantastic.

---

# Having the time of your life

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): The signature song. Is it their best? Maybe. I prefer a few of my 10s on this album to Dancing Queen, but I've decided to vote strategically this time around.

**marack99** (11): This is just pop perfection from the opening piano bit to the infectious vocals.

**meaxiobe** (11): There was very tough competition for the 11 in this rate, but, in the end, it had to be Dancing Queen. A truly timeless bop.

**peppersmith67** (11): Almost all of the music in this rate I listened to when I was around 13-15 years old discovering my taste in music. The Queen and Beatles tracks I adored then have aged on me with time, even the ones I still rate highly and love. The pure unadulterated joy I get when listening to Dancing Queen makes me feel like a kid listening to it for the first time all over again. Dancing Queen is timeless, and there's not an ounce of pretentiousness to be found. What all pop songs should strive to be.

**radiofan15** (11): You know songs like that... they are STORIES that people can IDENTIFY with... I mean anybody, children will be singing this song at graduations... at weddings... at funerals!

**rslashpoopheads** (11): It may reference a percussion instrument that hasn't been relevant in decades, but it's still a timeless classic!

**1998tweety** (10): A classic, gay bop.

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the most well-known songs in the world, one of the most effortlessly joyous songs in history. It's an important treasure in music.

**ggodisawomann** (10): YOUNG AND SWEET ONLY 17 (R. Kelly is having a field day with this one) (I'm sorry, too far?) (oop)

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): One of my favourite quotes for awhile is from Fahrenheit 451: ‘I'm seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane.’ This is just such a fundamentally youthful song? That carries so much joy? Like how could anyone hate it?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i mean, I MEAN!

**J\_Toe** (10): Just as is the case with Shawn Mendes' 'Queen', I like to imagine all songs with Queen in the title are literally about Queen Elizabeth II.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Starting this rate really strong, few songs actually can make me get up from my comfortable bed holding my laptop, to dance, this one does it and I'm absolutely not mad at it!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i can neither dance nor be a queen but when this song is playing it sure as hell feels otherwise

**rickikardashian** (10): Truly amazing. This song is just magical and pure joy. There's not a single thing that I would change about this. The only thing I want to do when I hear this song is be dancing without a care in this world, in the middle of an European rich ass mansion. I want to become the dancing Queen

**skargardin** (10): Immaculate, classique bop

**stardustanddinos** (10): one of the greatest songs in any genre ever, period.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): My favourite song as a kid. Nostalgia alone gives it a ten

**vhqv1997** (10): DANCING QUEEN Feel the meat on the tangerine! Oh YEAH!

**waluigiest** (10): this song is excellent and has so many flawless moments: the piano intro, the string passage that leads into the chorus, the low “mood for dance” in the second verse…. This song is pop perfection and is rightfully iconic.

**Gews** (9.5): I did The Beatles first and this is so fucking welcome

**slimboyfriend** (9): Giving this song a 9 is my way of sabotaging it while still giving it a score that it deserves.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): iconic and will probably win this rate BUT it is overrated because it feels like it drags on a little too long

**enecks** (8): I am rating this relative to other songs in this rate. This is not top tier ABBA, and can be kinda obnoxious if in the wrong mood. But those piano chords HIT in the right mood.

**Naomi1998xx** (8): NGL, my grandad used to have this CD and only this CD in the car while I was growing up, so I know pretty much all the songs on here intimately, dancing queen is a confirmed BOP

**runaway3212** (8): Just a great song but a bit overplayed

**vayyiqra** (8): Cheesy, but a classic with a ton of strong hooks.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): what a feel good song. iconic chorus

# Must be under 17

**geekysheep\_** (7): a classic but a little overplayed

**zamomattel** (6.5): this only really hits the spot if drunk on your 17th birthday

Are these results real life? [Or are they just fantasy?] (https://imgur.com/a/YtXfeDJ) Let’s all ping u/TragicKingdom1 and tell him to go fuck himself. Very, VERY early on, this was a winner for a time! I frequently joked to Phoenix that we should close submissions right then and there and leave it at that. This was obviously before we got some...hot takes. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I know this song is one of the biggest “I like real music” circlejerks but it’s one of the most inventive and unique songs of all time. Freddie lyricism is fascinating, the vocals are so weird and fun, and the guitar parts are iconic. I can it’s not for everyone because it is like multiple songs in one and is weird, but I absolutely love it and for being over 5 minutes song it does not bore me one bit at any second. How many songs can do that?

**poppinmmolly** (10): I realize a lot of people are sick of this song. That's completely valid, however, this song is fantastic. Breaking a song into 3ish parts keeps it fresh and engaging. I think it's genius.

---

# We can do the Fandango

**bespectacIed** (11): You know when a song is the greatest of an artist, we call it his/her/their Bohemian Rhapsody? Like Bad Romance is Gaga's Bohemian Rhapsody? Yeah.

**J\_Toe** (11): Yes, Bohemian Rhapsody (like Thinkin' Bout You by Frank Ocean) will always get my 11s because of the delicate, introspective, and nuanced representation of queer experiences. :) This song (and Frank's) are pretty much unrivalled in that regard.

**JunkyGS** (11): Idk how it can be any other song.... game changing for music as an art-form; unifying, timeless, risky and truly iconic.

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): would've gone to abba if it weren't for this talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it, masterpiece

**rickikardashian** (11): I'm a predictable asshole, I gave Bohemian Rhapsody my 11. I won't even try to justify myself, because everything that has to be said about this song has already been said a million times, but from the moment this rate was announced I knew this would be my 11. I love Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia with my life, but there truly isn't an experience that compares to BR. There's nothing like it, and most likely never will be, and I'm at peace with that, because I can always just relisten this song

**sailormunelune** (11): 44 years since the release of this song and it's definitely stood the test of time. A truly captivating and unforgettable roller coaster of a song.

**skargardin** (11): So, I was originally goint to give my eleven to an ABBA song because, well, it's ABBA and I have grown up with their music and their hits especially. But after listening to Bohemian Rhapsody for the uptenth time I can't in good concsience not give it an eleven. It's a pure masterpiece and I fear that it might get sabotaged in this rate. No song in this rate comes close to touching this song, no-matter how much the ABBA stan in me wants it.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**enecks** (10): Is this batshit pretentious? Yes. Indulgent? Yes. Overhyped as the peak of music? Yes, SOPHIE exists. A masterpiece of iconic arrangements that is enjoyable both as a serious work of art and as a camp lip syncing song? Fuck yes.

**Gews** (10): ten for artistic value

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Like wtf is wrong with you if you rate this song below a 10.... I call a lot of things iconic but this is ACTUALLY iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yeah, it might be overrated, but it's fucking great so.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): i mean cmon this is overplayed but nobody has the right mind to give it below ten.

**letsallpoo** (10): this song is okay but its not as good as this https://twitter.com/choiisooyyounq/status/1152065397580976128

**meaxiobe** (10): I have no emotional connection to it, so it's not getting my 11, but it's one of the greatest songs ever written.

**Naomi1998xx** (10): Iconic, campy, huge, extravagant, Love it but only listen to it once a year otherwise I get really annoyed by it tbh.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): ten points for the sheer ballsyness of releasing a 6 minute ballad/opera/rock song as a single and putting i'm in love with my fucking car as the b side

**radiofan15** (10): Glee outsold but this is great too!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I Got A Boy outsold!

**slimboyfriend** (10): I always keep thinking that this song is overrated until I listen to it again and see that it’s not.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): Perfection. My second 11(if I could have it)

**vhqv1997** (10): On paper this song really shouldn't have worked. All the different parts are so distinct in tone and genre and have their own kind of energy. It goes from ballad to guitar solo to opera to rock and back at ballad again. Hypothetically, this would have been a fucking mess of a song. But somehow, through sheer talent, they made it not only work, but also become the single most iconic song in history. The entire song flows together so coherently and every single part just adds to it even more and even more. Everything just sounds RIGHT, which is remarkable for a song as convoluted as this. I can't possibly think of enough praises for this song, because it is really just that good. I don't care that all of you lot are gay and would prefer Charli Tay Jepsen to this, this song is amazing, and no, you can't have a different opinion.

**peppersmith67** (9.1): I remember during a middle school "consumer studies" class (aka the class where I learned to knit) I randomly started humming Bohemian Rhapsody to myself and within a few minutes half the class were screaming the lyrics to the entire song with me. How a song THIS weird can be big enough for 12 year olds to know by heart and love is kind of astonishing. It's sad tho because the more I age the more ridiculous and silly the song feels. Doesn't have the same charm to me anymore :(

**vayyiqra** (8): How do I even rate this iconic song? It's brilliant, tragic, sappy, campy, melodramatic, silly. What do the lyrics really mean? Idk so it gets an 8 I guess.

**waluigiest** (8): I need to be honest and say that I don’t want this to win. I don’t even really like the song rn after going through years and years of extremely Caucasian singalongs. But this song is immaculately written, produced, and performed. It’s a beautiful, dramatic piece of music that is rightfully legendary.

# I sometimes wish I’d never been born at all

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): This would've been a 10 if it all sounded like the first part and was about four-minutes long. I do not care for everything post the thunder and lightning part.

**zamomattel** (6.5): I liked this a lot more before I started to go clubbing and heard this constantly like it barely makes sense to play in clubs you fools

**Mysario** (5): I recognise how iconic and remarkable this song is, but I am absolutely sick of how much I've had to hear this throughout my life

**runaway3212** (3.5): I feel like I don’t get this song because people are acting like it’s the second coming of christ when all I hear is a mess of a song.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): annoying, faux deep and NOT the musical opus it is often called

You mean to tell me Bohemian Rhapsody isn’t worthy of a score above a 0 for its incredible vocals or influential vocal production or genre pushing production or cross genre & timeless appeal; LET ALONE ALL OF THOSE FACTORS COMBINED? This song should be viewed in the entirety of music as bottom of the barrel with nothing positive about it??

I personally am not the biggest fan of Bowie but BOY I guess we have some Bowie fans in the house. I also want you all to know that Shawn Mendes has an acoustic cover of this and although it’s pleasant enough, the fact that he did an acoustic cover of this is a little off I guess.


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I really wish we there were more Freddie duets out there! David Bowie and Freddie sound so good together and play off each other really well even though their voices are so different. And the bass line was so good that Vanilla Ice stole it (and apparently it was the first hip hop song to top the billboard 100 wow how far we have come).

**poppinmmolly** (10): can you believe this wasn't originally in the rate? aren't you glad we decided to include it anyway? you're welcome.

---

# Under no pressure

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): The final verse/outro is one of the best that has ever existed

**bespectacIed** (10): I WANTED TO GIVE THIS SONG AN 11 SO BAD alongside like probably 3 or more queen songs. This song is a fucking experience. What an incredible, mind-boggling collab between two of the three best male performers humanity has ever witnessed. A freddie mercury x david bowie x michael jackson collab would have literallly broken the planet.

**enecks** (10): We should've rated some Bowie in this greatest hits rate. Like this is low-tier Bowie which means it's one of the best Queen songs by far. David Bowie was such a genius.

**ggodisawomann** (10): dundundundundnudun

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): And this is despite the fact I was required to participate in a lip sync of this song in high school

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I think we're ALL under pressure

**J\_Toe** (10): I hope this song isn't too vanilli for r/popheads tastes. (Also, are the lyrics bibimbap eat it up?)

**Mysario** (10): STOP collaborate and listen

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): AND YET MORE ICONIC

**skargardin** (10): I'm ready for yall do to this dirty..

**slimboyfriend** (10): My 2 musical queens united to make a bop for the ages

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Two icons in one of the most iconic duets of all time.

**vayyiqra** (10): Maybe I'm overrating this because I'm a Bowie stan, but I really think this is a brilliant pop song. I feel very much under pressure to finish this rate within my hour deadline after my computer went kaput and ate my first draft of it, then I got kicked out of the library which closed earlier than I thought and in the process lost my second draft, and now I'm doing it on my dying phone at 10 PM after a busy day and no sleep so I hope someone appreciates it.

**vhqv1997** (10): Bowie is one of my all-time favorite musicians. Anything from him gets a 10 from me. But even if I don't idolize Bowie as much as I do, this song is still remarkable. Two legends collaborated and created what is one of the greatest songs of all time. My biggest sadness is that we would never get anything like this again.

**peppersmith67** (9.7): At one point was my favorite Queen song but the more I listen to it I think David Bowie outperforms the fuck out of Freddy here. Besides the "Give love" part I don't think Queen or Mercury added much. A much better David Bowie song than a Queen song.

**meaxiobe** (9): Not keen on the scat parts, but I adore the final verse/outro ("because love's such an old-fashioned word...")

**rickikardashian** (9): ice ice

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Sounds nothing like anything else on this album but kinda a bop.

**Gews** (8.5): to finish this damn rate

**NotWith10000Men** (8): these lyrics bring a tear to my eye. people on streets ee da de da de da de da. pure poetry

# Under immense pressure

**zamomattel** (7.5): I love this jedward cover

**radiofan15** (7.1): Under Pressure's only problem is that it will always remind me to Vanilla Ice's song... and also how worthless is that mid-portion of the song...

**waluigiest** (7): maybe it’s a POC thing but I never got into Queen or David Bowie. Like I know people who weep to this song but I just don’t take anything exceptional away from it. It’s fine.

**runaway3212** (6): Saved by it’s great baseline.

This song never left the #1 bonus rate spot and was also the highest rated Beatles song in the whole rate! I guess I should have chose the UK version of this Beatles album which would have this song in the main rate but oh well. At least the Beatles did good at something here! Fun fact this also got two 11’s by accident so you know it’s a good song.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This really is one of the greatest Beatles songs (I apologize for this not being in the main rate we had to be selective and choose a version of the album). It’s very cinematic and I enjoy the lyrics telling the story of Eleanor Rigby.

**poppinmmolly** (8): i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm so sorry this has never been one of my favorites. Before my scores were sent in, this had a perfect score.

---


# Should have been in the main rate
**bespectacIed** (10): If this and Here Comes the Sun were in the main rate I would have had more 10s for the beatles. This is bone-chillingly good, those strings and lyrics could murder me.

**enecks** (10): The Beatles were great character portraiters huh

**ggodisawomann** (10): I still think this should be on 1 tbh...

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): I’m so sad I can’t give this an 11 :(

**J\_Toe** (10): if this weren't a bonus it would get my eleven purely for it's crazy good lyricism.

**JunkyGS** (10): Favorite Beatles Song EVER! The beat, the lyricism and the back story to this song... iconic

**meaxiobe** (10): A perfect song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i see why you put this as a bonus, this is criminally underrated

**radiofan15** (10): Have you ever heard of a song so sad and melancholic that it starts to become scary? Yes, this song is THAT SONG.

**runaway3212** (10): The best Beatles song. Instrumentals are the best of the best. Lyrics is on fucking point. Beautifully combined into a perfect cocktail of genius.

So this song was number one until the very last score got in, which was the one person who gave it a 1 (oop). It was the least controversial song in this rate until then but you gotta love last minute submissions! However I think the placing for the song is fine and is deserving. It’s a bop just personally not in my very top ABBA song. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): one of my favorites!! A bop song and a bop movie.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I think the ticking noises of this song is iconic, however I always felt like this was slightly overrated. I still love it, but it doesn’t have the punch some of their other songs have.

---

# Meryl Streep Stans

**geekysheep\_** (11): so powerful would sing on full volume in the car

**moooo566** (11): picking an 11 was the hardest decision i've ever had to make

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Those marimbas are some of the most instantly recognizable sound in music. Probably ABBA's best song. Iconic song, iconic title, iconic pre-chrous, iconic chorus, iconic everything, one of my 11s in this rate

**Gews** (10): made me remove a half-point from Dancing Queen and Take A Chance On Me

**ggodisawomann** (10): I can't breathe when I think about this song, it's a total classic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): THIS IS FOR BOTH THE SONG AND THE MUSICAL/MOVIE GOD

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Who else can relate to getting that dumb bitch energy of going back to some dude cause his dick game is THAT good.

**J\_Toe** (10): y'all know if ABBA were around today there would be twenty comments a day on r/popheads about how Mamma Mia is bigger than ABBA, a la Camila and Havana.

**Mysario** (10): fourth best musical I've seen, right behind the Steven Universe Musical, Grease, and the Green Day Musical

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Man, this is taking me back, a bop will always be a bop no matter how many years passed since its release.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): and yet it's the only the second best song in the list featuring these words

**radiofan15** (10): playthisatmyfuneral.mp3

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm going to be real, the video of the guy that sings this song on a Japanese river made me love this song way much more than I already did

**skargardin** (10): I know almost all of these ABBA songs as the back of my hand. I am well and truly living.

**vhqv1997** (10): https://i.imgur.com/vjWpcPb.jpg

**waluigiest** (10): the syncopated xylophone is dramatic and lovely and this song is so wonderful

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This song makes me want to run around a Greek seaside villa

**enecks** (9): Whomst among us hasn't sung this with their aunt

**peppersmith67** (9): Easily the biggest grower on me for the rate. The chorus is absolutely undeniable.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Iconic.

**runaway3212** (9): The instrumentals in this song are just on point. The singing complements it all.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): just sooooo fun

**NotWith10000Men** (7): abba knows how to make a fun little feel good song

# The hottest take in the rate

**vayyiqra** (1): I hate this song and the movie associated with it (though Pierce Brosnan was the best Bond, but I digress).

This was almost the winner before we got a few last minute scores. Not gonna lie I was a bit disappointed...but this is such a fun song and deserves a top spot! 


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is just so fun to listen to! It’s been one of my favourite Queen songs for a long time since I heard it back in middle school. Anyone who does not like this song does not like having a good time for sure.

**poppinmmolly** (10): u/shineflyer and u/ImADudeDuh both called this song gay and they aren't wrong but I would argue it's bisexual because he wants to make a supersonic man AND woman of you.

---

# Supersonic people

**1998tweety** (11): Extremely Iconic. Queen has many 10s but this one feels stronger than the others, it has an infectious energy.

**vhqv1997** (11): Alolan Exeggutor is a very goofy and awesome Pokemon and I'm tired of people making fun of it or shitting on Gamefreak for being uncreative. Yes, there are some real garbage designs in the Pokemon franchise (cough cough Krabby cough cough Sawk and Throh cough cough Geodude), but Alolan Exeggutor is an entirely creative Pokemon that has an actual reason both in-world and in real life to exist. Sure, you can say the Dragon typing is pointless and non-sense but you know what, Charizard is not a Dragon so we all know Gamefreak has a long history of fucked up typings. There are a lot of factors going into creating art, and it's fucking infuriating listening to people yab about how Pokemon has lost its creative spark when Gen 1 is famously the worst in terms of creative creature design. YAY, it's an orange dragon that is not a dragon-typed Pokemon, big whoop. YAY, Muk is just Grimer but bigger and more angry, groundbreaking stuff. You can argue that a concept is not done well, I would love to hear your argument, but to dismiss something as uncreative just because you don't like it and want to cuddle your Mewtwo is both patronizing and goddamn fucking stupid. If you really want to prove that something is not creative and lazy, how about you explain to me what creativity is? Because I am goddamn sure Krabby, a crab Pokemon based on a crab and looks like a crab except it's cooked, is infinitely lazier than Torterra, a Pokemon whose design is drawn from various types of turtles and prehistoric creatures but also based upon the legend of world turtles present in various mythologies. Basically, please stop fucking passing off your personal opinion as concrete, objective proof. Alolan Exeggutor, design-wise, is incredibly fun and convincing. We need Pokemon like this to make the world richer and more colorful, and anybody who disagrees with me can square up in the comment. I WILL fight. Anyway, this song is amazing and I went into this rant because the song was used in a vine featuring Alolan Exeggutor and a lot of comments were just rude. Don't Stop Me Now is 10/10. Whoo!

**bespectacIed** (10): This is my true 11 tbh, not Bohemian Rhapsody. As a non-native English speaker, this is one of the first English songs i've ever memorized. It's just a great hype song and still one of my favorite songs ever.

**enecks** (10): Energy and bliss itself pressed onto a record.

**ExtraEater** (10): should win the rate

**geekysheep\_** (10): bisexual anthem

**ggodisawomann** (10): cause I'm HAVIN A GOOD TIME HAVIN A GOOD TIME

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fucking iconic, I can see this being Queen's best performing song in this rate.

**meaxiobe** (10): An unrelenting bop.

**Mysario** (10): kill the queen

**Naomi1998xx** (10): Again its gran wedding material

**peppersmith67** (10): Nearly got my 11 for being the most Freddy Mercury ass song to ever exist.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): everything about this is heavenly

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Good kind of musical.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): SOOOO FUN. Everyone loves this song.

**waluigiest** (10): this song is happiness bottled. It’s fast and it waits for no one. While it’s bittersweet in hindsight, the confident gay energy in this song is undeniably beautiful.

**radiofan15** (9.8): Obligatory Shaun of the Dead comment

**Gews** (9.5): tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good rate

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): “Supersonic man out of you” liberated me from the binds of heterosexuality

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): The version on the deluxe edition of Jazz with "Long Lost Guitars" is magical. Basically, Brian May didn't want to endorse Freddie's hard partying lifestyle, so he refused to add the guitar to this song except for the solo on the bridge. Basically, this would be a 10 if I didn't know that a better version definitely existed in the world. And it's all Brian May's fault (just like the movie Bohemian Rhapsody).

**zamomattel** (9): his power

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): wanted to give it a nine but then i'd just be giving this whole album a nine so i gotta be a little less biased

# Please stop

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): Sometimes the Queen genre mishmash works for me, sometimes it does not

**vayyiqra** (3): Celsius outsold

**runaway3212** (0): It certainly exists.

AND HERE IS OUR WINNER! After being in the top 6 for the entire rate (and number 1 quite a few times earlier in the rate), and then in the top 3 towards the end, this managed to take down the other 2 songs after the very last submission. Both Mamma Mia and Don’t Stop Me Now held the number 1 spot at points in the last few days (and were both 0.5 points apart before the last ballot) but in the end this song prevailed! And what a fantastic song it is. The production at the beginning is iconic, the lyrics are fun and this reinvigorated Madonna’s career ~~can’t comment on Ava Max’s career yet~~. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The production (specifically the beginning part) is some of the best I’ve ever heard! No wonder why Madonna used it! Also the concept of a man after midnight is exactly what we need.

**poppinmmolly** (9): we love a slut anthem

---

# We love getting men after midnight!

**ggodisawomann** (11): this just had to be my 11. it couldn't be anything else.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (11): Literally the first time I heard this song I underwent a physiological change.... yes I am a friend of Sappho but GIMME GIMME GIMME.... A MAN......

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Fucking iconic. I love the instrumental, I love the energy, I love the lyrics, I love the bridge, I love the tension, I love everything about this song.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I mean the feminist in me rejects the message but… uhm yeah I… find this relatable. Also points for influence in music and by music I mean Hung up.

**zamomattel** (11): a fucking anthem only divas allowed

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah everyone's gonna talk about the instrumental, it's crafted by the GODS and transcends you into a higher dimension. Then the relatable lyrics, too, ABBA really said "this one's for the hornies". And i'll give my 2 cents just because i know everyone will: YES, HUNG UP ELEVATED THE SAMPLE AND IS THE BETTER SONG.

**CarlieScion** (10): lets go girls

**enecks** (10): This is like the Mona Lisa of ABBA songs. I won't elaborate except I will say both are associated with erections in weird ways.

**Gews** (10): yes

**J\_Toe** (10): sounds so good you'll be spilling your confessions on a dancefloor!

**Mysario** (10): I'm all about living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn, lovin 'til the morning, then I'm gone

**peppersmith67** (10): Enough will be said about how much the synth line in the intro kicks ass, but the musical breakdown between the bass and synth around three minutes in is absolute funk bliss. What a jam.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): biggest mood in history of moods

**radiofan15** (10): Outsold the Methuselah of Pop.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Legendary prechorus.

**skargardin** (10): big fat mood

**stardustanddinos** (10): the desperation in their voices, the harmonies on the chorus, the restless momentum of the song. What a track.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): the beginning instrumentation is pop perfection.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Stream Torn by Ava Max

**geekysheep\_** (9): spanish version is soo good

**runaway3212** (9): It’s really good don’t get me wrong, I just like Hung Up better.

**slimboyfriend** (9): a hoe anthem

**waluigiest** (9): YES this is dark fun pop. after hearing the Cher version I think there could be even more drama, but this is a banger for the ages

**NotWith10000Men** (8): okay i really like their disco tracks. this one is super funky

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a classic and that synth riff is iconic, which makes up for the cheesy lyrics. I still think Madonna did it better, but the original deserves credit too.

# fuck men amiright

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I like it. I do NOT love it. I never understood why most people consider it one of their bestest. It's good, but mildly overrated imo. The breakdown is the part that I like the least, personally, and no, not even the undeniably iconic pre-chorus salvages it for me.

**vhqv1997** (5): The first crack of instrumentals at the beginning is iconic and beautiful but the rest of the song feels lengthy

ignitethephoenix: # Queen: Greatest Hits

---

**Overall Average**: 7.933 **// Average Controversy:** 1.803

---

**Mysario** (9.142): it says "Greatest Hits" but it's missing "I Want It All" smh. Plus, I think y'all were too afraid to include "I Want to Break Free" in the main cause you'd know it would win

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.632): I'm not a Queen fan. I know their iconic songs and... that's it. I've gone into this album blind and was postponing on rating it until the very last minute so I hope it didn't reflect on the scores.

**stardustanddinos** (8.237): I am not actually into Queen; this is the first time I’ve heard anything other than their most known songs. Freddie Mercury’s voice and songwriting really reflects one of the greatest strengths of this band. Brian May is phenomenal on the guitar (damn, he might just be one of the best guitarists I’ve ever heard – he really perfected the electric guitar solo) and the songs deal with love and all its lives. A strong collection by a legendary band.

**slimboyfriend** (8.184): As a ginormous Queen fan, it’s so weird to listen to this album because the songs aren’t in chronological order. As a result, the sounds are so all over the place. The only major change I’d make to the tracklist is substituting “Flash” with “The Hero” even though it wasn’t a hit. I’d also add “I Want to Break Free” and Radio Gaga,” but they hadn’t come out yet when this album was released.

**bespectacIed** (7.895): That little kid (me) listening to this more than a decade ago didn't know how much a band led by a queer POC will mean to him, awww. I'm sure this is the first album I've listened to fully, no cap. I remember vividly it was on Windows XP's Windows Media Player, watching those freaky hallucinatory visualizations while the song plays, DAE remember them???? Definitely added to my listening experience.

**waluigiest** (7.421): Queen walked so Mika could run.

**letsallpoo** (7.421): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/532698515957350410/609841427828048064/Screen_Shot_2019-08-10_at_1.11.32_PM.png

**radiofan15** (6.332): Queen either make some of the greatest songs of all time or pure dogshit [Score: C]

**vayyiqra** (5.579): I've never been a huge fan of Queen, but they made points. I still find them hit or miss though, and either brilliant or campy trash. Maybe they're both. At any rate, RIP Freddie.

ignitethephoenix: # ABBA: Gold Greatest Hits

---

**Overall Average**: 8.223 **// Average Controversy:** 1.660

---

**radiofan15** (9.579): The most iconic collection of iconic pop hits and classics of all time, even more iconic than The Immaculate Collection, #1s, etc. The success of this compilation gave us newer generations of ABBA stans (including me), a musical, a movie and a sequel, and a newfound appreciation for the pop pioneers right here. [Score: A+]

**stardustanddinos** (9.079): One of the best compilation albums ever by one of the most legendary pop bands ever. ABBA was a trendsetter, setting the template for modern pop with all its extravagance and campiness. This collection of songs is absolute quality, and deserves respect for how versatile their production and lyrical content have been. Ranging from dance pop to more introspective ballads, and an impeccable ear for melody and vocal harmonies, ABBA is one of the greats and this is a fitting introduction and tribute to their legacy.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.053): I was raised on ABBA and somehow my mother was still surprised when I came out to her. They're the only part of my musical taste that nothing will ever take away from me. I will never be able to fully express how much I love and cherish their music.

**rickikardashian** (8.400): I already knew some ABBA and I knew they were great, but I didn't expect to come out of this rate as an ABBA stan. They're truly genius, and I really hope people don't see them as the weak group against The Beatles and Queen, because even tho they don't have the cultural following, they truly are an amazing band.

**Mysario** (8.053): iconic group that will get the recognition they deserve here

**slimboyfriend** (7.921): No lie, the spanish version of this album bangs harder than the English one.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.805): Here’s an anecdote. One of my closest friends at university (also my first friend! I love you Clara!) is Swedish. So I visited Stockholm in April. Honestly, it’s one of the most amazing places I’ve ever been. I just adored the vibe of that city. The energy. The water. The architecture. I have constant deja vu. When we were walking through Djurgarden to get to the ferry (I’m a boat lovin ho!) we passed the ABBA museum (didn’t go in, though, locals say it’s not worth it). That spawned a ‘listening to ABBA on repeat’ party later. My friend also introduced me to something our university hosts called MJOLK (the Swedish word for milk), where they play scandipop from midnight to like. Four AM. I just have a lot of happy Swedish memories. Most of which also include ABBA. I adore them. And Mamma Mia? Bomb ass movie. We have to stan.

**peppersmith67** (7.468): I'm relatively green on ABBA I only know the big hits and I can't sit through Momma Mia! to save my life I know i'm a bad gay

**vayyiqra** (6.368): I feel nostalgic for this album. My parents had it and I remember the cover of the CD case. Even though it has a lot of bops, there are some weaker tracks, so I can't say I stan ABBA, but they are very talented songwriters for sure.

**bespectacIed** (6.342): I love ABBA so much and is one of the first musicians I've heard thru my parents playing this when I was young, yet I am shocked by how low I am rating this album. ABBA's hits compilation to me is surprisingly full of duds, amidst some of the most well-crafted pop songs in history.

rickikardashian: Ngl, kinda salty that Bohemian Rhapsody, Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen didn't win, but this was an amazing rate and ABBA for what it deserved. Too bad I couldn't be live on the reveal because I truly went through a rollercoaster of emotions reading the results
