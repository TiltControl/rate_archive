This was one of the few ABBA songs I never heard until this rate. And it bops! However in an album full of better bops, this falls behind a bit and is out first on Day 2. The production is really great though and it is a pretty fun song. 
---

**poppinmmolly** (9): I have always loved this song!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like how the guys voices get to shine in this song. However I just find it a bit creepy the topic of the song and the girls voices are a bit chipmunk like which I’m not a fan of.

---

# Yes mom I’ll text you when I get there

**enecks** (10): That bass in the intro is undeniable

**geekysheep\_** (9.5): they didnt have to go that hard

**runaway3212** (9.3): Great song sung by the guys for once and they show they can bring it!

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.2): i love men and all but i kinda prefer abba when the girls sing the main vocals no idea why

**ExtraEater** (9): the guys aren't half-bad here

**J\_Toe** (9): wow how have I never heard this bop? Like the sound, not entirely sold on the lyrics though.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Get it Bjorn! I mean... don't get it!

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): I love the first 20 seconds the best

**TragicKingdom1** (9): hadn't heard this before, caught off guard by how its my favorite ABBA song now ...

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.7): They did NOT come to play

**rickikardashian** (8.5): I mean, the lyrics make me a tad uncomfortable, but that guitar is bitching so I'll purposefully ignore them and just dance to it

**ggodisawomann** (8): yeah she does thanks. also the beat on this song is fantastic dundundundund dundundudundund jsdifjdjdjf

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I did not expect to like this tbh

**peppersmith67** (8): ABBA really were wizards in the recording studio their production has so much going on and everything feels in its right place.

**vayyiqra** (8): I had a witty and insightful comment about gender roles or something in this song which got eaten by my computer so thanks Obama.

**radiofan15** (7.5): This is cute but in a rat kinda way

**Mysario** (7): I asked her and no, she doesn't know this song

# I love to sneak out!

**waluigiest** (6): that intro is a wet arcade beat! It’s so wild! I haven’t settled on how I feel about the lyrical content tho. It flirts with the boundary of what’s okay when talking about a sitch like this

**zamomattel** (5.5): unproblematic kings

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Look. This might be a banger. The "does your mother know that you're out" line might be the gayest thing on this album. But I still can't bring myself to liking this. The instrumental feels kind of.. aggresive to me? It's always been that way. The fact that this song took a spot that my other absolute favorites like Eagle, The Day Before You Came or Angel Eyes could have taken doesn't help my opinion on this song either.

**bespectacIed** (4): Gonna give all the closeted bitches with homophobic mothers everything they want!

**NotWith10000Men** (4): i don't like the man singing nearly as much as i like the woman

This is another okay song. Cute but not a stand out. I think it’s ranking is fine. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (8): a cute song!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song is pure but it’s just a bit too cheesy for me. I love how it has musical theatre flavour to it. I bet this was the song someone listened to and then was like “I need to write a musical on their music with this as the closing song!”

---
# Thank you for the music ABBA

**1998tweety** (10): What an absolute classic (that will get robbed). I have fond memories of this song cause I sang it in choir back in elementary school.

**bespectacIed** (10): When I was little this was my mom's favorite to sing in the karaoke. Remembering how happy she was singing to it is a 10/10 memory to me, so this is a 10/10 song

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): yes thank whoever the hell gave abba their music it's heavenly

**skargardin** (10): An iconic song with such a sense of finality to it, why the hell doesn't it close out this collection? The clownery of it all

**geekysheep\_** (9.5): again the spanish version is great too

**Gews** (9.5): more like it!

**radiofan15** (9.5): No... THANK YOU

**Mysario** (9): I have an avid fear of going deaf

**runaway3212** (9): Lovely and inspiring. It lacks a bit in depth though.

**vhqv1997** (9): Thank YOU, ABBA, for this music

**enecks** (8): An effective emotional coda to a greatest hits

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): thank you indeed

# Thank u, next

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Also cute but less so.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): eh too sugary

**vayyiqra** (6): Thank you ABBA for the bulk of this album which is great, and keep the rest.

**waluigiest** (6): boring honestly, but I appreciate it

**zamomattel** (6): the cover with billie piper put this on the map

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): Also just okay and contender for heaviest Swedish accents

**ggodisawomann** (4): this ain't it

**Naomi1998xx** (4): Waaay too cheesy, even for ABBA

**peppersmith67** (3.5): Sounds like a parody song for the end of Miss America or a PBS special

Molly and I both agree this is the most robbed ABBA song in the rate. I would have not expected it to barely make Day 2 but here we are. This song is pure and I guess people found it too cheesy and or lame even though it’s not imo.

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): big bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I never really paid attention to the lyrics outside the chorus but they are really cute! ABBA is really good at creating memorable chorus’ that’s for sure.

---

# Somewhere in the crowd there’s you

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i've never even had a bf and for the life of me i'm way to anxious to go on any sort of stage why do i sympathize with all of this

**runaway3212** (10): Just ABBA perfection, love every second of it.

**skargardin** (10): Sugary sweet and bittersweet at the same time, another classic for sure

**radiofan15** (9.7): Way better than the movie version... FUCK BLUE LIVES!

**enecks** (9): If you know you know ;-3

**Mysario** (8.5): shenanigans

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Boring bop.

**J\_Toe** (8): I'm not as familiar with this song as the others here, but I really like it

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): overrated but I still love it

**waluigiest** (8): why is this making me think of Christmas and why am I sad

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.6): Am I the only one who only knows the first two lines and that’s it

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The chorus feels kind of clunky, as if all the words crumble up into something whole, yet indiscernible. Okay otherwise.

**ggodisawomann** (7): this one doesn't quite hit for me like the others do but I fully recognize it as a smash

# Concert ditchers

**vayyiqra** (6): Super Troopers was an okay movie. This song is also just okay.

**zamomattel** (5.5): ABBA said support the troops

**geekysheep\_** (5): cute lyrics but its never been a fav

**NotWith10000Men** (4): not digging the synthesizer thing during the 'super trouper' part of the chorus

**bespectacIed** (2): overrated

**ImADudeDuh** (2): lowkey boring tbh.

**peppersmith67** (2): Wack.

It’s fine I guess and the placing makes sense. Once again we hate ballads here so that’s why I’m not surprised. 
---

**poppinmmolly** (9): Cher's version of this is so good

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s a nice song but you have to be in the right mood for it. It can drag a little or be a bit boring sometimes.

---

# Queens of Australia for 14 weeks

**enecks** (10): A weird anomaly in ABBA's discography that was a record annihilator in Australia, this is a war ballad of all things. It has a weird amount of restraint and detail for an ABBA song, but no complaints. It's kinda like a different band, though ABBA is still better than that band.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i want to have a fling with a guy named fernando just to be able to sing this song to him when we meet again in our seventies

**radiofan15** (10): Andy Garcia is a national treasure

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): So sublime. One of my faves

**runaway3212** (9): I feel that this is a lot of ways the best song of ABBA but it lacks in personal feel.

**rosesmp3** (8.5): this song tells a better story than some books and it's only four minutes long

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): on god ON GOD the iconnery but a little slow tbh

**peppersmith67** (7.6): I can't really take this song that seriously at all but the chorus slaps because it's an ABBA song of course the chorus slaps.

**skargardin** (7.5): Not as iconic as the rest of the hits on this album but still boppy

**rslashpoopheads** (7): A lil bit of a snoozer.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Fernando was my Spanish name in my high school Spanish class

# Prefer Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): this is alright but not the turbo banger the rest are

**ImADudeDuh** (6): for a song title that sounds a lot like my name, I'm sad that i didn't like it more.

**J\_Toe** (6): This song makes a cameo in Lady Gaga's Alejandro

**Mysario** (6): still a good song but the worst ABBA song in the rate

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): i'm seeing a pattern of the choruses being a lot better than the verses

**zamomattel** (5): the balls to cover a Cher song

**vayyiqra** (4): This song annoys me and idk why. I've always found it corny.

**waluigiest** (4): does not hit it for me!!

**bespectacIed** (3): no fuckboy deserves a song unless it's a bad one like this

Just like Phoenix, I thought this was an Elvis song tbh. When I found out it was Queen I still thought it was a *cover* of an Elvis song. Nope. Just Elvis inspired. I think this is appropriately rated, and honestly I’m surprised it’s a Day 2 song. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (8): This song was inspired by Elvis! Also Freddie wrote this in the bath.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is a bit too Elvis-y for me(to he point I get confused who actually sings it if I hear it) but it’s fun.

---

# Freddie is better than Elvis

**ExtraEater** (10): appears in just dance

**ggodisawomann** (10): mmmm taste

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of the first music videos on Mtv! also a fucking Just Dance 3 BOP!

**Mysario** (10): possibly my fave Queen song, even if it's basically just simple rockabilly that was written in like 5 minutes

**NotWith10000Men** (10): one of my favorite songs of all time. freddie's voice is incredible in this style. and the ready freddie part just makes me smile

**peppersmith67** (9.5): Feels like a better old school Beatles track than most old school Beatles track. Freddy is a much better Elvis than Elvis.

**1998tweety** (9): Cute

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): elvis tribute but so much better than elvis that i don't even know who elvis is anymore

**slimboyfriend** (9): MULTIPLE people I’ve listened to this song with always think it’s an Elvis song, which is a testament to Queen’s ability to adapt to different genres while still having integrity.

**waluigiest** (9): okay this a little slapper it makes me wanna dance even if it’s dad rock

**enecks** (8): This is like an Elvis song but good

**runaway3212** (7.3): Nicely made, laid back song.

# Elvis outsold

**J\_Toe** (7): this song sounds older than it is

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.1): Am I crazy or is this a little honky tonk!?

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Is this their most normal-sounding song?

**radiofan15** (3.5): Elvis did this better saweetie...

**bespectacIed** (2): How this boring elvis tribute song became one of their most known songs, I will never understand. And I hate this song because it reminds me that The Kooks - She Moves in Her Own Way (a song I love) ripped this song off

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): This 0 is not because I think this is just the weakest track of the bunch. No, I actually hate this song. Usually I can deal with a bit of cheese and corniness in my music, but something about this track feels wrong to my brain.

**vayyiqra** (0): I hate this song. I wish I could explain why, but I can't. I have just always hated it and think it needs to be swiftly yeeted from their discography.

To be honest, I have never loved this song that much. It’s too happy and gooey for my dark and negative soul. But I knew this was a popular song and I liked it more than I Do x 5 so I decided to choose it.

---

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): cute! I really like this scene in Mamma Mia! too.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s nice but just a little too sweet and sugary for my taste.

# Sugar and Spice and Everything Nice

**enecks** (10): I thought this was the mariah song twice so I nearly gave this a 22

**ggodisawomann** (10): taste

**radiofan15** (10): Another classic right here... deserved to be on the main rate above Does Your Mother Know

**rslashpoopheads** (10): This is gonna win the bonus rate or else Pierce Brosnan will eat your [redacted].

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): the song is cheesy but I love it.

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is better than most ABBA songs in the main rate, what is it doing here?

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.9): big bopp but slightly less than angel eyes

**runaway3212** (9.3): Unapologetically in love, but not lacking subtlety. It is the best of love songs, yet the instrumentals are sometimes a bit lacking.

**peppersmith67** (9): this is the sweetest dam song

**Mysario** (8.5): a Winnie the Pooh favourite

**bespectacIed** (8): a good pop song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): oh this sounds so ditzy and cute, oh nevermind a man is here

**waluigiest** (7): sweet but I wish it had more texture

**NotWith10000Men** (6): cute little song. the dude's voice sounds good in this one

**vayyiqra** (6): All I can think of is that 50s song or whatever that goes "sugar sugar / oh, honey honey". It's kind of slick though. Anyway, stream Honey by Robyn.

What can I say except this is ENTIRELY robbed. This is one of Queen’s best, tbh. - Molly

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): I stan, idc

**skargardin** (9): I actually lived for this

**waluigiest** (9): I could say this for any song but Queen really walked so MIKA could run

**peppersmith67** (8.5): THIS IS A GAYS ONLY EVENT

**enecks** (8): Queen's strength might've actually been when the backing vocals hit

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i forgot about this one too! this melody is a bop. love the piano

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): This one's fun, feels a bit ragtimey.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Another song that is oddly charming.

**slimboyfriend** (7): How did they get away with releasing a song this gay

# because I’m bad at loveeee 

**J\_Toe** (6): this song is short enough to fit in with the streaming era.

I’m personally a fan of this song, but I suppose within the confines of this rate this is one of the more middle of the road songs. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): always one of my favorites!

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): it’s cute but just not feeling it completely. Not a fan of the scream in the middle of the song as well.

---

# Lovers

**bespectacIed** (10): Oof a genuinely great song in my beatles hate brigade. It's innocent and preppy, and musically not as grating as their other songs. A gem in their horrible early catalog

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The yang to Money, Money, Money's yin. Editor's note: The score given to this song doesn't reflect the person's opinion on socialism.

**enecks** (10): yo this song kinda kicks ass

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok then please deposit yours in my bank account xoxo

**Mysario** (9): can't even afford rent

**runaway3212** (9): Lyrically great, sonically awesome. The Beatles at their finest

**peppersmith67** (8.2): I would just like to add that my love can most definitely be bought bitch i'm broke

**1998tweety** (8): One of the more listenable songs, but the message is wack.

**skargardin** (8): Preach

**slimboyfriend** (8): the whole song might be a tired cliche, but I love a cute 12 bar blues song.

# Gold Diggers

**vayyiqra** (7): I remember there was a movie named after this song which was alright.

**waluigiest** (7): can’t buy me love hoe!

**radiofan15** (6.8): Quite unsubstantial TBH

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): it's nice to hear a guitar solo

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): This is a direct response to ABBA’s Money Money Money, you’re welcome for blowing your mind

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Boring and cliche.

What is wrong with y’all? Do you not have friends you love? Why is this so low. This is a wholesome song about friendship! - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): fucking adorable as fuck this is so wholesome.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This is definitely wholesome tv show/movie kind of music. It’s decent but it’s just kind of basic to me.

---

# Best Friends

**ExtraEater** (10): beyond relaxing

**ggodisawomann** (10): my god this song is so wholesome. one of my all time favs

**Mysario** (10): name a cuter song, I'll wait

**peppersmith67** (9.3): I don't care how many romantic comedies have tried to bastardize it, still gives me the warm fuzzies. Easily the undisputed cutest song of the rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): me @ teriyaki chicken, binging Garry's Mod let's play videos, and masturbating at 10 pm.

**JunkyGS** (9): Actually didn't even know this was a Queen song.... shook

**NotWith10000Men** (9): john deacon did what he had to do. this song is so fucking CUTE

**slimboyfriend** (9): Yeah, the lyrics might be plain, but they get the sweet message across extremely well.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): reminds me of the fact that irl i have an unrequited crush on my best friend and that takes away points

**runaway3212** (8.5): I really like this song, it’s weirdly charming.

**zamomattel** (7.5): didn’t realise this was a queen song until literally right now

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.2): Aw thanks!

# Friendless

**bespectacIed** (7): Cute, but very beatles

**enecks** (7): It's cute, but this over I Want To Break Free?

**skargardin** (7): cute

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): good

**vayyiqra** (7): I shy away from the temptation to read every Queen song as gay-coded just because of Freddie's sexuality, but I always thought this song was definitely meant to be gay. Then I learned it was written by their bassist about his wife. Well then.

**vhqv1997** (7): It's Nice To Have A Friend by Taylor Swift found dead

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Boring kind of cute.

**waluigiest** (3): this song disgusts me and I can’t articulate why. Maybe I’ve never known true joy.

*Whitney Houston voice:* “But wow, what a moment. A moment I will never forget. A moment that is most pleasing to me in my career.”

This is probably one of the most iconic Beatles songs. If you had to name 5 Beatles songs off the top of your head this would probably be one of them because it is that powerful. It was also the first song by them to go number 1 in America and it literally invented the British Invasion. I could go on about how influential this song is but instead I’m just going to say that this deserved to be a little higher overall. 

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): a HUGE bop that inspired so, so many songs like it.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This was one of the first Beatles songs I ever heard so I always have loved this. Also when are we ever going to get a song about hand holding again?!!?

---

# We love hand holding

**stardustanddinos** (10): a true classic.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.7): God imagine holding hands

**peppersmith67** (8.4): ewwwwww cooties

**runaway3212** (8.3): It works in a way only the Beatles can work. Because it feels like it wasn’t made to be serious but at the same time is serious enough to be taken serious.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Cute rhythm, kind of silly lyrics.

**enecks** (8): Why the fuck are some of the best Beatles vocal harmonies in a song about hnd hlding

**Gews** (8): ha-a-a-a-and

**ImADudeDuh** (8): scandalous....

**sailormunelune** (8): Some of y’all bout to be real mad at me but it must be said: I like the Glee cover better. This still good though.

**waluigiest** (8): love the classic sound, also the rhythm change is very important

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): She’s a cute song

**rickikardashian** (7): i hate that this became the go to song to snobby peopel be like “damn, people used to sing stu with meaning and love, not like today’s rap music that only wants se and drugs”, because this is actually a cute nice tune

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Kinda cute I guess.

**vayyiqra** (7): Was this risqué back in 1963 or whatever

# Ew cooties!

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): the haaaaand part annoys me

**bespectacIed** (2): maybe i just hate 60s music in general

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (0): Ear bleach

# Shout out to my gleeks

**Mysario** (10): one of the few Glee covers where I'd take the far superior original version any day of the week, though I did appreciate the new meaning of the song

**radiofan15** (10): Kurt Hummel outsold but this is great too

Tbh this may be one of the most overrated Beatles songs ever imo. I feel like people love this song because of nostalgia (I mean I guess you could argue that for this whole rate lol) and because its very recognizable and iconic. But it’s kind of messy and not as tight as some of their other songs. Shout out to that scene in Love Actually as well.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The is peak hippiness in music form. I feel like this song was better in my memory. There are good parts in this song, but I feel like it’s a little messy and simple. Also it’s been overplayed.

**poppinmmolly** (7): kinda boring!

---

# I love hippies!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): loveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneedloveisallyouneed

**ggodisawomann** (10): song title speaking FAX no printer

**J\_Toe** (10): who else remembers this song being used for nappy adds in Australia throughout the 2000s?

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): sampling la marseillaise and greensleeves? sold!

**skargardin** (10): classic

**Mysario** (9.5): they backed out last second from keeping the original name, "All You Need is Food"

**bespectacIed** (9): Lazy chorus it literally just reversed the words but it's a bop

**izeasklapaucius** (9): the callback to she loves you is priceless lol

**radiofan15** (8.6): It quites needs more of that psychedelic energy like that of the ending TBH but it's still a cutey song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Someone love me NOW

**runaway3212** (8): A good song, but the whole song is just one sentence repeated over and over and over.

**waluigiest** (8): a little corny but yeah I like this

**CarlieScion** (7): is it really tho

**meaxiobe** (7): Sweet song, but way too repetitive.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): i want to die

# Fuck love, war is all we need

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This song is a little overrated. Lennon sounds so uninspired in the verse, and the instrumentation just makes me tired.

**vayyiqra** (6): [redacted comment about John being a hypocrite] Okay, it's still a good song, but it bothers me knowing that the Beatles did not always comport themselves in such a peaceful loving manner in real life.

**peppersmith67** (5.5): Corny.

**zamomattel** (5.5): soppy bastards

**NotWith10000Men** (3): i don't get the hype behind this song... i can't hear the verses over the music and the AAAAAHHHHs and the chorus is literally just 'all you need is love'? is it just bc it's probably really fun to sing with a group of people? or bc a zillion people saw it on live tv when that was a new thing? or just flower power?

**enecks** (1): This is the side of the peace era of the 60's that doesn't hold up - all plattitudes, no depth or practicality. also deeply obnoxious as an arrangement

I don’t have a lot to say about this. I think this is correctly rated. - Molly


---

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Another song that’s a bit repetitive but it bops! Also the juxtaposition of day’s night is super fun!

**poppinmmolly** (9): when I went to see Paul McCartney in 2017, he opened with this and when he played that first chord my sister and I turned to each other and SCREAMED and all the grandpas and grandmas around us looked at us weird.

---

# Dogs

**ggodisawomann** (10): twerkin like a dog

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): for some reason this song puts a smile on my face

**runaway3212** (9.5): Fun and enjoyable. Enough said.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.4): It’s just good

**Mysario** (9): dogs don't work, I would know, I've seen Clifford

**peppersmith67** (9): THAT COWBELL

**rslashpoopheads** (9): This is that good shit.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Ringo is a lyrical genius for this song title and also that cowbell in the pre-chorus. A proto-banger.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I actually recognize this song, a good one

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I wish it didn't fall flat after every one of iconic namesake couplets. But it does. Unfortunately.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): it's a grower but I like it now

**vayyiqra** (8): Me rn as I struggle to finish my third attempt at this rate (!) after having been up for more than 36 hours.

**waluigiest** (8): when the key + texture shifts that’s that good shit

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): i love the 'working like a doOoOg' part

**radiofan15** (7.2): Cute

# Logs

**enecks** (7): I wonder how much good music we're missing out on because artists are contractually obligated to be touring. The Beatles became truly great when they stopped touring.

**bespectacIed** (6): Iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (6): lowkey their vocals arent good on here

**zamomattel** (5): working day and night by MJ is similar but better

OnE DiREctIOn oUtpEAKed rIgHt gUyS??? This is a jam and I think it’s a little bit robbed. Very simple but in a good way. Fun fact: this is one of the first songs I remember even knowing. We sang this in preschool for some reason. - Molly


---

**poppinmmolly** (9): a real crowd pleaser

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Queen knew exactly what they were doing when they created this song! The go to song for any sporting event (along with We are the Champions but that’s for winners only).

---

# Rockers

**Mysario** (11): I'm a simple cum, so it's only right I enjoy the world's simplest song

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Beyoncé, Britney, and Pink in their sexy gladiator fits could wash Queen

**ExtraEater** (10): we are going to beat you to death

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Middle school jam 1/2

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): ICONIC

**saucymac** (10): because it blessed us with 5ive's cover

**skargardin** (10): A hype anthem, truly iconic

**vhqv1997** (10): Remember that Pepsi commercial that P!nk, Britney Spears, and Beyonce did together?

**radiofan15** (9.5): Overplayed but a BOP nonetheless

**Naomi1998xx** (9): misses out on a 10 because its really overplayed

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): i dare you to listen to this and not get pumped the fuck up

**Gews** (8): hockey stadiums

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Barely 2 minutes long? UGH! I'm so tired of artists making their songs short for streaming...

**runaway3212** (8): As hard to hate as it is to love. But it is enjoyable is ways no other song is.

**stardustanddinos** (8): An absolute classic that everyone can recognize, but idk I find it kinda boring.

# Big Disgraces

**CarlieScion** (7): rock me by one direction outsold

**J\_Toe** (7): fun fact, this song was sampled for Gaga's You and I.

**waluigiest** (7): yeah it’s good but I never want to hear it ever again

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Overrated kind of legendary.

**zamomattel** (3.5): this is honestly such a din

**enecks** (3): hate it every time someone's shaking their leg then some fratbro makes it into this

**vayyiqra** (2): I can't help but hate this song. I liked it as a kid, but now i associate it with sporting events and I'm not for that.

Frankly I am surprised this is so highly rated? I guess you guys like the instruments in this. Honestly I kind of regret giving this an 8 because that seems a bit high now, but it’s too late! - Molly


---

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love nostalgia this song has! If I had to write a song about a street from my city, it would be pretty dark because it would just talk about it being super cold and windy in the winter, and how you could get stabbed. Fun stuff.

**poppinmmolly** (8): you know I went to Liverpool in 2017 and we went on a Beatles bus tour and stopped at Penny Lane and my dumb ass was surprised to see it as a bustling street with a roundabout and several businesses and a bus stop. He literally mentions all those things in the song AND THE FUCKING VIDEO, but the song sounds so quaint and sweet I thought it was going to be a nice, sleepy street. Dumb. - Molly 

---
# Blue Suburban Skies

**radiofan15** (10): That trumpet will always be hypnotic and captivating...

**slimboyfriend** (10): Piccolos! Trumpets! Piccolo Trumpets! What more could you want? This song makes me feel like I’m watching some children’s TV show on PBS.

**runaway3212** (9.5): This base is a lot of fun and combined with the almost non-sensical description of a street. It is just great.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): Sung this and did choreo to it.... wow

**skargardin** (9): we love a key-change

**waluigiest** (9): when the chorus gets loud and the flute comes in, that is bliss

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): dis cute

**1998tweety** (8): The trumpet/bugle on this slays a bit

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Imagine being named Penny Lane tbh, it sounds like a superhero's alter ego.

**Mysario** (8): pennylaneismyrealname.com

**NuneEtsuko** (8): ,4

# Bankers without macs

**peppersmith67** (7.5): A really well written and crafted song masked in some obnoxious overproduction. So a Magical Mystery Tour song.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): i like the trumpet, needed something more in the rest of the song though

**bespectacIed** (6): Horns make everything better

**enecks** (6): I don't like the original that much. BUT STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER - the B-Side? THAT's the good shit. Beatles trippiness >> any of their other artistic modus operandi.

**vayyiqra** (6): I do not really like when the Beatles do their kind of goofy psychedelia thing. Speaking of Penny Lane, Almost Famous made a lot of good points about how shitty this era was despite the "good vibes only" mood that was prevalent. It's still a catchy song, I guess, but I don't love it.

And here we have another Abba song that is well known but is not a big bop! Instead it is a kind of mournful mid tempo ballad about breaking up and moving on. I have always liked this song but if you are not into ballads it may not stand out that much. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This one is pretty nice and I think it’s a good mid tempo song! Maybe a little underrated too.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): This has never been my favorite and continues to be just that. I like it better than I used to.

---

# The best I can do

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A song that manages to be both cute and mature, what's not to love?

**J\_Toe** (10): I want to link this Horrible Histories ABBA sketch, but it's got a weird filter on it to avoid copyright https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJAY2QNtGug

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): The lyrics are so truthful.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.9): ah haah

**bespectacIed** (9): Very pensive lyrics, it's a CRJ song four decades too early

**enecks** (9): I was going to give this a 7 but then I realised how genius the chorus' composition is

**ggodisawomann** (9): mmm a solid tune

**Mysario** (9): this wasn't on Mamma Mia

**runaway3212** (9): A sad song, but also a happy song about how sometimes you just need to break up.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.7): Pirate glam ABBA is iconic ABBA. (Also the ‘walking through an empty house / tears in my ears / this is where the story ends / this is goodbye’ part is SO.... IT’S EVERYTHING)

**radiofan15** (8.5): Cute little summery bop with amazing guitar works

**geekysheep\_** (8): its catchy

**Naomi1998xx** (8): My mum loved mama mia as well so I dont have much to say about these songs on their own

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the change in the beginning of the first verse caught me off guard. i dig it

**peppersmith67** (7.5): Even a mid ABBA song is a ton of fun

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): This music video is so fucking funny.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The verses are so unremarkable, but the rest of the song makes up for it.

**vayyiqra** (7): Is this ... rock? This could almost be a song by Boston. It's very slick.

# There is nothing we can do

**waluigiest** (5): this feels like an eternity it’s not bad just boring

Another bop from ABBA incoming. Although it’s not as iconic as some of their other songs, it’s still pretty fun and it’s placing is fine. Also this song has instagram captions for days. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song is a whole mood. We love a band that encourages to gold dig (sort of)!

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): I mean...tea. It is a rich man's world, but this is not as good as some of their other songs.

---

# yes find me a sugar daddy

**Gews** (11): like I said

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The OG sugar daddy anthem. Editor's note: The score given to this song doesn't reflect the person's opinion on capitalism.

**enecks** (10): this is the most rascally meme song and I love it. When capitalism is dismantled, this song will be one of the few things I will miss.

**ggodisawomann** (10): the theme song to my life

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Okay yes fuck gold digger stereotypes and any member of ABBA would be the rich one but also gold diggers are aspirational and this BANGS

**J\_Toe** (10): Fun fact, the director of many ABBA video clips directed the film Chocolat, which my year 12 English teacher made me watch the entirety of because of one song in the final act.

Out of all the Beatles songs in this rate, this is easily their biggest bop and I’m surprised it didn’t make day 3 over some other Beatles songs. I guess people still prefer the later Beatles music compared to the earlier and simpler bops. The intro just throws you into the song in the best way possible and I love the happy/sad song and lyric contrast. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourite upbeat Beatles songs! I love the harmonizing of all their vocals and the melody. The lyrics are also so relatable and not about love for once which is a nice change!

**poppinmmolly** (10): Help! is my 2nd favorite album from them and this is my 2nd favorite song from that album! (I've Just Seen A Face is 1st)

---

# Panic! At the Disco

**ggodisawomann** (10): I'm annoying bc I yell help like this song does when I need help...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): definitely a mood.

**J\_Toe** (10): Help! How can I give more than one song my eleven?

**Mysario** (10): iconic scene in Yesterday

**runaway3212** (10): This song is like a jigsaw puzzle. Apart the pieces don’t seem to make sense but as a whole it makes a full picture.

**radiofan15** (9.2): BOP

**1998tweety** (9): Kind of a bop tbh

**peppersmith67** (9): Being a kid is loving old school Beatles for being catchy, being a teenager is loving psychedelic Beatles because drugs, and being an adult is realizing drugs aren't that cool anymore and a catchy song will forever be a catchy song. It's science.

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song is so unspecific but so much fun

**waluigiest** (9): this is beautifully written and performed. It just locks together so nicely I really appreciate it

**zamomattel** (8.5): after trashing all these Beatles songs, FINALLY some good scran

**enecks** (8): this song is good, but its best moment is in the premature ejaculation intro

**skargardin** (8): mood

**vayyiqra** (8): same

**Gews** (7.5): much better

Honestly, this is one of my favourite ABBA songs and I do think it’s a bit robbed but then again r/popheads hate ballads so I guess this ranking makes sense. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Definitely one of their most powerful songs! The vocals here are so good and it’s always been one of my favourite ABBA songs.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): never been my favorite but I do stan Meryl Streep so that does elevate this score a bit.

---

# Stan US Open Champion Bianca Andreescu


**enecks** (11): OH GOD THIS SONG MAKES ME CRY SO FUCKING HARD ;_; This is such an impactful, raw song. But also the ABBA camp fun is there - an overextended game metaphor, a real burst of funk. But that just makes it cut deeper. It's a song to add along to the best of Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler in "camp songs that still make me cry super hard". Also, this is the best ABBA arrangement PERIOD. The elements building up, the vocal melodies, the impact of it all.

**ExtraEater** (11): As far as I can tell, Britain considers this ABBA's masterpiece. In two different polls, it was voted their favorite ABBA song in 1999 and again in 2010. Britain is correct

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): if only bohemian rhapsody didn't exist it could've been so much more

**radiofan15** (10): Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog is serving the vocals Selena and Charli wishes they had

**runaway3212** (10): A constant crescendo of perfection followed by a great bridge and that final fucking chorus just wraps it all up so well.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): Amazing. The extended version is even better

**zamomattel** (10): the power this has

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): ABBA please stop I’m already a loser

**Mysario** (9): I think this is one of ABBA's best songs and I never skip it when it's on, but I never have an urge to listen to it

**Naomi1998xx** (9): actually no I take that back.

**peppersmith67** (8.9): How this starts as an arena rock ballad and slowly builds into a disco heartbreak jam is insane. "I was in your arms, thinking I belonged there/I figured it made sense..." personally attacked me.

**Gews** (8.5): like I said

**ggodisawomann** (8): I win

**NotWith10000Men** (8): oh shit this woman can really sing

**rslashpoopheads** (8): It's simple and it's plain.

**waluigiest** (8): it’s quite simple but the melodies are beautiful and the way it evolves is nice

**geekysheep\_** (7): sad song

# Fuck the dirty cheaters the Patriots

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its ok but not much more, don't @ me

**vayyiqra** (4): This is as boring and dry as reading about the mathematics of zero-sum games.

**bespectacIed** (2): corny as shi

Paul McCartney said Civil Rights!!! In seriousness, he did right this in response to all of the coverage of the Civil Rights Movement that he was witnessing and I’m a little gutted it isn’t in the main rate! This song is still amazing to hear live, by the way! Have I mentioned I saw Paul McCartney live yet? Because I did and it was amazing. 


---

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is such a fantastic song and I wish it was in the main rate!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song is so simple but so peaceful and soothing. A underrated track imo (which is why we chose it). The bird could have been more in tune though /s

# tweet tweet tweet 

**peppersmith67** (10): their best ballad.

**radiofan15** (10): That was a classic!

**vayyiqra** (10): Paul really got to shine on this song

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is better than most Beatles songs in the main rate, what is it doing here?

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.8): also wildly underrated this one

**runaway3212** (9.5): In a lot of ways Blackbird is a strange song. But it is really love-able and I do just absolutely love every part of it. Especially the bird itself. It adds a lot of newfound life to the song.

**bespectacIed** (9): countryeatles is a serve

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Okay, this deserves second place in the bonus rate.

**Mysario** (8.5): :sad:

**enecks** (8): its good but common expose the popheads to some A Day In The Life instead

**NotWith10000Men** (8): simple classic

**waluigiest** (8): racism is canceled

**zamomattel** (7.5): both the Beatles songs in the bonus rate deserved better

I’m surprised We Will Rock You and this aren’t closer together. They kind of occupy the same space in my mind as anthems that they play at sporting events. I guess more is happening in this song though, both vocally and instrumentally. - Molly


---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented winners! Before this song existed there was no winning just losing and losers. The power Queen has to invent champions!

**poppinmmolly** (8): despite it being an ANTHEM, this isn't my favorite!

# Champions

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**ggodisawomann** (10): legendary New England Patriots theme song after all them superbowls heheheh

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Middle school jam 2/2

**radiofan15** (10): another overplayed BOP... but it's a classic nonetheless

**rickikardashian** (10): since I realized that they don't say "OF THE WOOOOORLD" i can no longer enjoy this song. Forever ruined for me

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Rated-exactly-as-it-deserves kind of legendary.

**vhqv1997** (10): Somebody needs to create an official version of this song with the line "...of the world" at the end

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.9): ALSO ICONIC but had to deduct a smidge because i just noticed for the first time that the outro leaves you hanging and it bugs me

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): i also dare you to listen to this one and not get pumped the fuck up

**Gews** (9): , my friend

**skargardin** (9): Another absolute classic but i can't help but feel that it's kinda overrated

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): I love it

**zamomattel** (9): Serena Cha Cha & Venus D Lite on AS8 double crowning

**Mysario** (8): would rather be an APEX legend

**peppersmith67** (8): The only Queen song played at sporting events that isn't complete trash don't @ me.

# Losers

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): the chorus is of course amazing, but lowkey the verses are pretty forgettable tbh.

**J\_Toe** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_IAqwrvEuU

**runaway3212** (7): The crazy frog remix is better.

**waluigiest** (7): yeah it’s good but I never want to hear it ever again [2]

**bespectacIed** (3): Can you say legendaric? Iconic? But lyrically this song is laughably bad. This one's for the heteros.

This big bop of a song just missed Day 3. I thought it would make day 3 but unfortunately it slipped some places in the last few days and not even 4 11’s could save it. I feel like lots of you will be disappointed but personally for me I can’t disagree with what remains in day 3 since it’s such a strong group. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song was made extra iconic by the scene in Mamma Mia not gonna lie. I relate to the guys jumping out of the water in their scuba gear and dancing along because that’s my mood.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this was my favorite as a kid. Still up there as one of my favorites, too.

# We got laid

**rosecoloreds** (11): a CLASSIC

**rosesmp3** (11): we stan the best dance pop song in history

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (11): Perfection. Sublime. Brilliant.

**waluigiest** (11): this is flawless. It sounds like a sexy, groovy Muse song and I will NEVER be over it. The dark harmonies on the chorus, the synth/organ thing, the sad girl in love lyrics. I will never again waste my emotions. Thank you ABBA for this.

**didney-worl** (10): My favorite ABBA track. Absolute banger.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Such a shame that this one doesn't have a music video. Then I could've discovered this song way back, watching it on my old ABBA: The Definitive Collection DVD.

**enecks** (10): This is one of the most ridiculous ABBA songs which means it is one of the best. Also it meets one of the top-tier ABBA song requirements, which is that the chorus is god-tier to yell along to when drunk

**geekysheep\_** (10): dont like jealous partners but i am a jealous partner and you cant deny this bop

**Gews** (10): eurodiscopop always gets a 10

**ggodisawomann** (10): mmmm

**radiofan15** (10): *DON'T GO WASTING MY EMOTIONS... LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME...* ugh I left that, I felt that inside of me like a big dick on a lonely Saturday night of binge-drinking and regret.

**skargardin** (9): I don't think I've heard this before but my god does it bop

**slimboyfriend** (9): this song sounds so FRESH

**vayyiqra** (9): The intro reminds me of the church music of my youth and it's also kind of epic

**Mysario** (8.5): in your fantasy, dream about me, don't go wasting your e•mo•tion

**NotWith10000Men** (8): somehow both kinda spooky and fast paced?

**peppersmith67** (8): The disco groove here is awesome but it's kinda one note.

**runaway3212** (8): If it was just the verses and the pre-chorus it would be a ten, but I don’t the chorus matches the rest of the song.

**vhqv1997** (8): Oh my God the bassline is heavenly

**zamomattel** (8): one of their sexier bangers

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): That chorus tho

# Emotions = WASTED

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): The internalised misogyny :/ has me like :/ even tho this is a bop :/ and the chorus is heaven :/

rickikardashian: I'm both excited and scared for Day 3. All the songs still in are just amazing.

These are the scores for the songs left in the rate: 11 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9.5 9 9 8 8 8 7.9 7.5

This is going to be a bloodbath

=====

NotWith10000Men: You know what? The next time there's a rate with an artist that I love and I know popheads doesn't fuck with, I'm going 10s all the way down. I'm ashamed of myself for giving Queen less than an 8.5 on any song now smh 

We are the champions, I am so sorry
