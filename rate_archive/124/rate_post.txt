Early 2010s Pop Rap Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/nqql6v/early_2010s_pop_rap_rate/

Welcome everyone to the Early 2010s Pop Rap Rate. This is going to be a tribute to the nostalgic era of the late 2000s and early 2010s, when pop radio was flooded with rap crossovers built around big pop choruses and heavy dance beats that made for floor-filling club bangers or featured vocalists who lent these raps a pop song's sweetness and bombast. Given that we're now about a decade removed from the height of this era, it feels like a perfect time to look back on it all, and att the center of this rate are three of the most prolific artists of this trend, as well as a selection of the most fun and indelible hits from other artists who used this sound, so without further ado let's allow my cohost u/izeasklapaucius introduce you to....

# Flo Rida:

Tramar Lacel Dillard (born September 16, 1979), better known as Flo Rida, is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from Carol City, Florida, and I did NOT just steal the first sentence of his Wikipedia page to opens this blurb because further introduction would just be too long-winded (or maybe I’m just lazy). At this point, HOW could you not know about Flo Rida? Everyone with age ranging from 6-60 with access to Internet and radio in 2009 have got to know about him. His debut single, "Low (feat. T-Pain)", went to #1 in Hot 100, which is difficult to get, not everyone has that. You need a filler pop track to add in the post for your wacky, quirky scene in [TV shows](https://youtu.be/_fyEarGbpXM?t=62) and [movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr9_GfeoCjk)? The Only One Flo got you covered. He even still finds success as a Eurovision contestant representing [San Marino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkhiH-JXFPs). That’s how relevant he is to this day.

Speaking of Flo Rida’s music, much like all of the other pop-rap boys here, he mainly sings about partying and having a good time. Maybe he’ll rap about girls too. Some dick-sucking bops here and there. But one of his hits stood out for me. On surface level, you might think "I Cry" is just another one of his poppier tracks, but dig into the lyrics and you’ll find that he raps about Japan earthquake and Norway mass shooting, two things that you’ll rarely find on a dance-pop track. Not only that, but few lines on the verses talks about how Flo is still trying to cope on his sister that died because of Bronchitis.

>Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish/Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish

This is, I think, what sets Flo Rida apart from other artists in this rate. Even though this is the only occurrence of him rapping about personal stuff, he’s not afraid to bares it all and show the audience his personal side. You’ll never hear a pop-rap artist gets this vulnerable anymore.

We will be rating selected hits from the debut *Mail on Sunday* to 2015 EP titled *My House*.

# Pitbull:

a.k.a. Mr. Worldwide a.k.a. Mr. 305 a.k.a. *Gotti* soundtrack composer. Unlike the other main acts in this rate, the breakthrough moment of one Mr. Armando Christian Perez had been a slow burn. Before the world knows it, he had already released three studio albums under independent label and scored top 40 hit back in 2004 with "Culo", which features fellow icon Lil’ Jon (they would later become lifelong musical besties, with Jon producing many of his material). Pitbull’s true rise to stardom came in 2009 with "I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)", a combination of hip-hop groove and thumping Eurodance beat that peaked at #2(!) in BB100 (*Boom Boom Pow* blocked it). Since then, he essentially rebranded himself as a pop star and had released many dance-floor bops which ranging from about partying, partying with girls, and, get this, to partying like it’s your last!

Pitbull’s music resonate with a lot of people, including young me who had never been to a party nor club, and I reckon it’s because the themes that are present on every single om ne of his hits. From the samples of popular songs that get smartly (or cheaply on some songs) reworked, varying cities and/or places he shouts out on the verses, and last but certainly not the least, his trademark[(ed, literally)](https://www.nme.com/news/music/eeeeyo-pitbull-has-trademarked-his-signature-yell-2651507) yell and ad-libs that just gets you and your ass going. Whenever you need some kind of escapism in your life, Pitbull is ready to give you some.

His popularity dwindled in the mid-2010s onward ([as did the quality of our lives, which is no coincidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8v689j/you_can_predict_whether_a_year_was_good_based_on/)) since I guess people doesn’t want to go down and yell timber anymore, but that doesn’t and won’t stop us from rating his work. We will be doing that with selected hits from 2009 to 2014.

# B.o.B:

The Earth might be flat, but the trajectory of one Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. in the early 2010s is sure as hell aren’t. After releasing some mixtapes on late 2000s and appearing on 2009 XXL Freshman Class, B.o.B’s name quickly soared to night sky like shooting star with the release of his debut single, "Nothin’ on You". Although short-lived, B.o.B’s commercial peak produced slew of the most iconic singles of the decade. Those come mostly in the form of collaboration with other pop or pop-adjacent acts, including the aforementioned Bruno Mars one, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, and many others.

What makes B.o.B stands out from other pop-rap acts in this rate? I’d say his choruses and the artists he’s collabed with has always been the key to his success. Now, I’m not saying he’s a bad rapper. His verses are fun and at worst, passable on some of the singles. But real talk here, you could probably find more people that could recite Hayley William’s part on "Airplanes" more than the ones with its verses. I think it’s one of those things where the popularity of an artist’s work eclipsed that of artist themselves. Good or bad, take that however you will. But at the end of the day, his songs still bop and we’re happy. And we’re ALSO happy because B.o.B didn’t go out his way to destroy his legacy as the "Airplane" guy or the "Just The Way You Are" guy by releasing a [Neil deGrasse Tyson diss track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMMJ2Dgkrm0) in which he, among other conspiracy theories he believed in, raps about how the world is a “flatline”, right? Right, guys?

Bad cosmography takes aside, in this rate we will be rating B.o.B’s selected singles from his first two studio albums, 2010 *B.o.B Presents: The Adventure of Bobby Ray* and 2012 *Strange Clouds*.

# But Wait, There's More!

Because of the overabundance of 2010s pop-rap outfits that came and went, as well as a number of more credible rappers who tried to jump on this pop rap wave at its peak, we've compiled the best of the best into this kind of mini grab-bag rate. Among the artists spotlighted here we have uncle/nephew duo **LMFAO**, first Asian-American act to hit #1 on Billboard **Far East Movement**, Katy's ex **Travie McCoy** and his group **Gym Class Heroes**, and many more!

# RULES

* Rate every song with a score between **1 and 10**. You may give **one** song a **ZERO**, and **one** song an **ELEVEN**. You may only use up to **one decimal place** in your scores, any more will crash the program (so 5.7 is allowed, 5.73 is not).
* You **MUST** rank **every song** in the main rate if you want your ballot to be counted. You cannot leave any main rate songs blank. The deadline for ballots is not until mid-July, so feel free to take your time and listen to the songs and albums as many times as you like!
