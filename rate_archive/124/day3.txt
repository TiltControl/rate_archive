**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): The best truly solo Pitbull single, and something genuinely fun. Hotel! Motel! Holiday Inn!!! I want to take a vacation now!

---

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): KING OF SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Leixander** (10): HO-TEL MO-TEL

**plastichaxan** (10): seeing how sexual some of the songs i listened to as a child is quite an experience

**Roxieloxie** (10): no pitbill dont be biphobic your so sexy aha

**runaway3212** (10): the lyrics are stupid, the production is terrible, I dont think I've heard a better song so far this rate.

**skargardin** (10): actual paying attention to pitbull lyrics really is something

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is the actual definition of a banger

**waluigiest** (10): I could just be ignorant but this is a genre defining song for me

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): Sugarhill Gang vibin in their old folks home rn

**awhile2** (9): to this day i still dont know what pitbull meant by here goes some egg whites but the iconic sample makes up for the questionable lyrics (i also never want to hear the word gushy used in any song)

**cherryices** (9): incredible use of sampling

**IIIHenryIII** (9): 12-year-old me screaming: We at the hotel, motel‚Ä¶ that's all I can think of when listening to this. I just appreciate Pitbull for being so horny, but not coming through dirty with his songs. I mean, it's all in-between the lines, he is not that graphic with his lyrics, at least not as much as other rappers when rapping about intercourse. He's kinda classy about it.

**timothy444** (9): Pitbull manages to make a song with a sample better than the sampled song itself. The pitbull has amazing talent

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): if Pitbull invited me to his hotel room you KNOW I would be accepting that invite

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Heaux Tale Room Service.

**frogaranaman** (8): imagine being cheated on and the other man is Pitbull

**GARjuna** (8): a bop but these lyrics.....

**Hulnia** (8): Possibly the catchiest song ever made in my opinion, although it‚Äôs gotten annoying to me now.

**jaztinax** (8): a sharp, distinct synth can either ruin a song or make a song. in this case, it makes the song. also this is the first time i‚Äôm listening to the lyrics closely and WHAT IN THE NASTY IS HE SAYING IN THE FIRST VERSE

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): HOTEL MOTEL HOLIDAY INN

**rslashpoopheads** (8): can't believe Pitbull was my middle school math teacher

**seanderlust** (8): if there is a person who knows this song and can resist the call and response of "hotel, motel, holiday inn" I have yet to meet them

**simplyterific** (8): A CLASSIC!

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): i played this so much when i went on holiday for the first time w my friends sooooo this is purely nostalgia blinding me

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): a song that is solely carried by the chorus, I could not tell you what happens in the verses at all

**outsideeyess** (7.7): i only play this song once every 3 years and every time I blast it with my best friend like it's the best song I've heard in my life

**bulforster** (7.5): This is musically kind of terrible but 'hotel, motel, holiday inn' is iconic and Pitbull's charisma sells it so hard I can't help but like it.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): somehow i never noticed the lyrics in the verses :o

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's so fucking annoying, but I still quite like it

**TiltControls** (7.5): king of addition

**1998tweety** (7): shes ok

**Awkward\_King** (7): FORGET ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND AND MEET ME AT THE HOTEL ROOM WE AT THE HOTEL MOTEL HOLIDAY INN WE AT THE HOTEL MOTEL HOLIDAY INN GO FUCKIN WILDDDDD

**catjoon** (7): I like the chorus while the verses üòï

**nyoom** (7): me, shaking and crying, holding a gun to pitbull's head: EXPLAIN WHAT "Two in the 'O' and one in the eye" MEANS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.9): same energy as the obnoxious guy at the bar who won‚Äôt back off even after you mention having a boyfriend

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.5): referring to your semen as egg whites is a bold move

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.1): this is iconic but like not necessarily... good

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , the wrong video played in my mind, sorry.

**musical\_pyn** (6): I really don't know what to rate this because it's such a bad song but a total bop??? What do I do???

**jman457** (5.8): Pitbull is both ugly af because he is bald but would absolutely could shred my bussy

**kirby31200** (5): About as disgusting as the average motel

**hikkaru** (3): i used to work at a hotel motel holiday inn

**jsonphile** (3): god this is irritating

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2.5): I don‚Äôt know where else to add this but why aren‚Äôt we rating Pitbull‚Äôs collabs with Jennifer Lopez? On the Floor and Dance Again deserved

**CrimsonROSET** (2): please dont call it your egg whites

**fadedblue09** (2): imagine listening to a Pitbull song with no features

**FKJVMMP** (1): Google tells me the lyric is ‚Äúthat Gucci stuff‚Äù. Bullshit. ‚ÄúGimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff‚Äù is unforgivable.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): Please do NOT watch the movie this song is from, I have made that mistake and would like to spare the rest of you. However, even if it isn't a strong enough concept to build a feat film around this song is so bright and chill and fun. Its not as clubby as a lot of higher finishers her but its just as fun in its own very different, breezy way.

---

**celladonn** (10): This is so joyous

**endcreditouilles** (10): Snoop Dogg voice: oh my god

**frogaranaman** (10): have any of y‚Äôall watched this movie? it‚Äôs one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever seen in my life

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I never realized how Bruno was everywhere when he got popular. Controversial opinion: I prefer Bruno from the early 2010s.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is honestly such a fucking anthem

**runaway3212** (10): this is such a youth anthem

**steelstepladder** (10): The only good Bruno Mars hook in the rate

**outsideeyess** (9.5): could do without the coughing at the end lmao

**musical\_pyn** (9): ‚Ä¶I really miss this vibe

**jsonphile** (8.5): this is the perfect song to chill at a park smoking weed too. Or so I would assume I‚Äôve never actually done the weed I was never a cool kid

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): this is fun! Chorus is smooooth

**plastichaxan** (8.5): finally a good bruno song in this rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): that time when every 15/16 year olds facebook status was "so what we get drunk, so what we smoke weed"

**TiltControls** (8.5): nice & chill

**timothy444** (8.5): lol only discovered this song is part of a C-grade music thanks to one of the Apple Music Hits radio presenters mentioning that fact.

**akanewasright** (8.1): Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace, but I don‚Äôt give a fuck, I ain‚Äôt no hippie

**seanderlust** (8.1): I mean maybe this is obvious but snoops verses are the best here by a mile. still, both of them do a decent job

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This is cute but I practice sobreity.

**jasannn** (8): Idk why but I started dancing the bridge of Next Level to this.

**kirby31200** (8): The tie-in movie with this song ends with Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa discovering marijuana to be the perfect renewable energy source

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): I can‚Äôt relate but I love that for them

**teenwitches** (8): did anyone ever watch mac and devin go to high school or was that movie a fever dream

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Snoop Dogg hasn't really done anything good since the turn of the century but at least his lack of caring about the music he makes actually kinda works here.

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): Khalid‚Äôs Young Dumb & Broke outsold

**CrimsonROSET** (7): wait they smoke weed?

**simplyterific** (7): this is a nice feel good anthem and I enjoy his and snoop‚Äôs back and forth on the verses. Too bad the lyrics have gotten corny as time goes on

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): maybe if I was a stoner I would like this more. The coughing is too much

**nyoom** (6.5): snoop dogg was 40 when this song dropped, and 43 when he featured on korean hip hop survival show Show Me the Money only long enough to watch a bunch of blustering dudes who maybe saw a guy who might be in the mob once scrabble over each other like rats in a barrel for one mic thrown into the crowd. he was so young and wild and free, little did he know...

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): , this song played whenever my aunt turns his flip-flops into a punishment missile back then.

**GARjuna** (5): it's fine

**hikkaru** (5): high on legal marijuana

**DaHumanTorch** (4): this song annoys me, i hate the beat. snoop does good though

**jaztinax** (4): i always thought this song was a little cringe

**rslashpoopheads** (4): abstinence is the key to happiness!

**Awkward\_King** (3): sure but what about this song not existing

**bigbigbee** (3): My friend went on a road trip with her frat bro brother once, and for the entire ride he only played this song on loop, and her recounting that story to me has actually colored my view of this song

**jman457** (2.8): This song always really annoyed me. The way it was as big as it was confuses me

**1998tweety** (2): smoking weed isnt a personality

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): It feels weird that the one attempt at a more meaningful song from Flo Rida also has maybe the best sample flip and production of his career, to the point where it sounds so good its easy to miss the lyrics, but coming back to this it might be my favorite Flo Rida song of the bunch? Idk everything her just works

---

**fadedblue09** (11): This is Dancing on My Own for the straights (source: my pre-gay realization self)

**akanewasright** (10): I don‚Äôt remember this song super well from its heyday but it FUCKS

**CreepyMannequin** (10): the Piano in the Dark sample is just chef‚Äôs kiss

**endcreditouilles** (10): dONT CRY because it's OVER, SMILE because it HAPPENED~

**FKJVMMP** (10): This is my most played song on my iTunes that I stopped using in like 2013. Classic. How many rappers do you hear calling out the dangers of cigarettes? Flo Rida is a role model for all of us.

**hikkaru** (10): SMASH, everything about this is hype asf

**runaway3212** (10): this is a masterpiece I just absolutely adore

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): me when I spam the sobbing emote

**skargardin** (10): modern classic yup

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i wasn't into this song as much when it came out but over the past month i've been super into it so 10/10 banger

**thedoctordances1940** (10): A Flo Rida song that actually has good and meaningful lyrics? Throw in a typically brilliant chorus of his and you've got one of the best songs of the rate.

**timothy444** (10): An instant 10 for starting off your first verse with "I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida"

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I never thought a Flo Rida song could make me wanna cry.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): noooo don‚Äôt cry ur so sexy haha :D

**waluigiest** (9): this on the other hand (compared to wild ones) has aged like wine

**GARjuna** (8.9): kinda fucks

**jman457** (8.9): This is the perfect song for when your coming down from molly and you hitting the point of euphoria and you want to dance and cry

**musical\_pyn** (8.5): flo rida stop having emotions I just want to party

**nyoom** (8.5): nooo don't think about your dead sister your so sexy aha ;)

**catjoon** (8): this ate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): kind of underrated? Like these lyrics are way more deep and sad than I thought, he‚Äôs literally talking about his sister who passed away when he was younger (and I guess also other global tragedies which is a bit weird ) Idk why he decided to make this a club it but I guess that‚Äôs his lane

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): some of these lyrics on a dance track are so... ugh

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**kirby31200** (7.5): Making sad songs about tragedies for the club shows how the mid 2010s were

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's sweet, but outshone by some of Flo's other stuff a little

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its ok flo rida, i do too.

**seanderlust** (7): this dancey song talking about okinawa and his sister kinda borders on tastelessness

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): normalize boys and men crying

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): would love to know the thought process behind a relatively upbeat sounding club song which references both an earthquake that killed thousands of people, and also the death of the artist's sister? Truly baffling choices were made here

**outsideeyess** (6.5): i remember putting on a "best songs of the early 2010s" youtube video with my friends and they played all the music videos for each song, but for this song they played 9/11 footage. this was years ago and I'm still confused....

**simplyterific** (6): is this song supposed to be emotional??? Why was there a 9/11 clip in the video this is so weird

**frogaranaman** (5): hyperpop inspiration

**Awkward\_King** (2): dont cry ur so sexy ahahahah x

**rslashpoopheads** (2): crying in da strip club

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): Yep. This is a Pitbull track.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): Pitbull and Ne-Yo's second team up, while just as clubby as Give Me Everything, feels like it has an opposite strengths and weaknesses, as this one has a much more distinct theme, but also it lacks the variety of hooks Give Me Everything had and when it comes to Pitbull songs, hooks > theme any day for me

---

# a good time, balling or not

**astrologicalangel** (11): fucking perfection

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): this makes me wanna day-drink endless mimosa at a brunch

**akanewasright** (10): I don‚Äôt like giving 10s to Dr. Luke songs, but this is just‚Ä¶ delightful

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have too many good memories with this song to not give this a 10 [2].

**endcreditouilles** (10): belting this at the top of my lungs when I was 16 and didn't even pay rent asdjkasl

**fadedblue09** (10): His best song by a long shot. Showcases some of his more tolerable rapping and Ne Yo complements this well.

**FKJVMMP** (10): Proof a good concept can save the lyrical ability of even the most worthless writers.

**frogaranaman** (10): Ne-Yo absolutely nailed that chorus on this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.tiktok.com/@jtljaido/video/6969384205222432006

**musical\_pyn** (10): I completely believe pitbull whenever he says "this is for those going through tough times"

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i realized if you just put ne-yo on the song it elevates it to a ten

**TChalla1966** (10): this song shouldn‚Äôt hit as hard as it does but what can I say this but adulting is a thing so

**TiltControls** (10): "We didn't go to church. But I got... blessed" has to be one of my favourite deliveries of the entire rate

**catjoon** (9): absolutely adore this song

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Shake that ass! I won't though.

**runaway3212** (9): yes

**skargardin** (9): BANGER

**timothy444** (9): Literally a forgotten hidden gem until you rediscover it again and you realise that Pitbull is not the rapper we deserve, but he is the one we need. Bring back fun pop back :sob:

**xavieryes** (9): As far as rehashed collabs go, this is pretty good. It's no Give Me Everything, but it's still a really fun song. I'm also glad this song was a hit because it kept the horrible She Knows from being Ne-Yo's last big Hot 100 hit (too bad it's Pitbull's last one too).

**celladonn** (8.5): This sounds like a bop but there's a deep sadness to it

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): I miss Ne-Yo :(

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8.5): Just a squirrel, looking for a nut

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , oooh

**rickikardashian** (8): if pitbull has been here and done this and made it out alive, i believe i can do so too. thanks pitbull

**Roxieloxie** (8): I wanna clown this but like,,, did they not somewhat spill on it ???

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): Ne-Yo really served back in the 2000s

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute, meme carries it tho

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel like the production is too soft here and the pressure chorus is weird. It‚Äôs just not as enthusiastic as I want it to be for a song called time our lives. Ne-Yo killed the chorus though.

**nyoom** (7.5): ALWAYS LIKE A SQUIRREL LOOKING FOR A NUT. in all seriousness this is a pretty real song about spending any cash you have instead of saving it bc you'll never save enough for it to matter anyway and you might as well invest it in your happiness no matter how fleeting and i gotta respect that

**jman457** (7.4): I vaguely remember this song but working minimum wage ass job with thosasands of dollars in student loan makes this song connect with me in a weird way. Can we just party capitalism away?

**awhile2** (7): this song would not fly in todays class-conscious society (see mimunm wage by blake shelton) but it was a bop when it came out

**jsonphile** (7): can we bring Ne-Yo back? I liked him.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6.2): quite chill (which is saying something for this rate lmao)

**bigbigbee** (6): HAH I've never heard this song with swears in it before. Actually I really was kind of touched by the line "This for anybody going through tough times / Believe me, been there, done that"

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): "always like a squirell looking for a nut" HELP

**simplyterific** (6): ‚Äúalways like a squirrel, looking for a nut‚Äù ???????????

# everybody going through tough times

**thedoctordances1940** (6): little bit annoying but nothing too bad

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): that poor goldfish deserved better than that shitty vase/tank

**rslashpoopheads** (4): this might be the most forgettable song on this whole list

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): a poor rehash of give me everything

**Awkward\_King** (3): i dont like this song but i like what it stands for. fuck capitalism dont prioritise paying your bills, PARTY! !!! !!! ! ! !

**moonagenightmares** (3): i thought that was eminem for a second at the beginning, jumpscare

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): more down-the-middle and ballad-esque than pretty much anything else on Day 3, I'm surprised this song made it so far but I'm honestly kinda glad it did. Its simply but it works really well, and has the bonus of being one of the few songs I overplayed in middle school my parents actually liked, so there's also that

**izeasklapaucius** (3): God I don't know what it is but it has that x factor that really breaks the song for me.

**1998tweety** (10): rest in peace christina grimmie :pensive:

**CrimsonROSET** (10): RIP Christina Grimmie

**frogaranaman** (10): this song literally makes me go wild but why is he wearing his fucking coat like that in the single art it makes me so mad

**moooo566** (10): its impossible to mentally separate this one from christina grimmie, it just makes me sad

**runaway3212** (10): perfection

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a guilty pleasure, this is so corny in the best way

**skargardin** (10): classic

**teenwitches** (10): i wanted to rate this song lower but for some reason i physically can't not give it a 10

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Fuck it, I love this song. Don't really know why, it's probably just nostalgia but that chorus is great.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Christina Grimmie :pensive:

**moonagenightmares** (9): i thinking about HER thinking about ME thinking about US what we gonna be opened my eyes and it was only just a dreaaaaaaaaaaam

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): the asians love this song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): a very nice rap ballad from nelly

**Leixander** (8.5): the chorus is just too good

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): [taking off all my clothes] IT WAS ONLY JUST A DREAAAAAAAMMMMMM

**jman457** (8.3): Hot in here but make it dream pop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this was everywhere back in the day what a time

**waluigiest** (8): this has the radio in a chokehold

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Sounds nice but there's something about this one that throws me off and I can't fully enjoy it.

**jsonphile** (7.5): Nelly isn‚Äôt the best rapper to try to deliver a heartfelt breakup anthem but it kinda works for me

**outsideeyess** (7.5): overplayed af

**akanewasright** (7): This is basic radio filler and I feel like I might be overrating this a little but this is fun

**jaztinax** (6.5): this song was so hard to score because i associate it with me being miserable in middle school art class but it also reminds me of fun late summer nights and good vibes

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , i had a bad taste to music, forgive my queer desires overpowering my straight responses.

**GARjuna** (6): It's Fine!

**CreepyMannequin** (5.5): UH UH UH HEEEEEYYYY

**catjoon** (5): kinda boring

**nyoom** (5): sorry your wife left you dude. maybe if you made better music she'd come back

**steelstepladder** (4): Sharkboy's dream song outsold

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): why can i not process that this song exists and isnt just a hallucination after three hours of listening to this playlist

**timothy444** (2): Overplay in the early 2010s really killed a lot of enjoyment I have on this song and also knowing that soccer moms love this song to death doesn't help. It sucks because despite trying to avoid what everyone thinks about it, I just can't help but see it as some boring motivational pop song from an artist that has done much much better. It worked though because Nelly himself even admitted its just a dumb song with not much meaning to it so nobody can't even pretend to say that its "deeply emotional" or whatever excuse people come up with. So yeah, my score should be justified

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): a bop!!! there isn't a ton to say hear but I have heard this song so much and I NEVER mind it because it just sounds fantastic to listen to even if the lyrics are only there for flow and what consonants sound right. It goes off nonetheless

---

# it takes a genius to understand him

**CrimsonROSET** (10): a just dance STAPLE in my house

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A classic

**frogaranaman** (10): imagine hookup up in the bathroom while this track bangs in the background

**GARjuna** (10): chef's kiss

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i remember when adoseofbuckley pointed out that this song samples Levels by Avicii which already samples Something‚Äôs Got a Hold on Me by Etta James and because of that, this is a bad song.

**Leixander** (10): the 2011 nostalgia i get from this is IMMENSE, we love you avicii and etta james

**TChalla1966** (10): excellence lyrical icon ugh

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Pure europhic goodness

**timothy444** (10): Avicii and Flo Rida both approached the "Something's Got a Hold on Me" sample in different ways and while Tim Berg used it as a way to transition from a dancy, up-tempo feel to something more introspective, Flo Rida focused on the vocals of Etta James in the chorus, hooking the listener to the dope-ass Flo Rida verses. In other words: what a banger

**xavieryes** (10): At some point I hated this song, as well as Levels and Something's Got a Hold on Me. Who would've thought I'd end up liking all three.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): It‚Äôs a good vibe indeed, but strangely somber now that two of the players on this track have passed away. Rest in peace, Etta James and Avicii.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I know people get mad when artists sampling old songs and make it modern, but if it‚Äôs slaps it slaps idc.

**nyoom** (9.5): levels has 1 lyrics and that's ok

**jman457** (9.2): Avicii and Etta James outsold but this song is a megabop

**outsideeyess** (9.2): a GREAT song but so overplayed

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): me when my 11 makes Day 3

**seanderlust** (9.2): not the hold it against me dubstep breakdown :deadbanana:

**akanewasright** (9): This was O V E R P L A Y E D but it‚Äôs been a few years since I‚Äôve heard it so I‚Äôm a little nostalgic

**caseyfla** (9): Etta James was EVERYWHERE in the 2010s. God bless her.

**emayzee** (9): levels by avicii was the superior 2011 song to use this etta james sample but it's still great

**fadedblue09** (9): I was prepared to cringe but this is actually better than I remembered?

**rickikardashian** (9): i once almost broke a lamp dancing to this in just dance

**endcreditouilles** (8.8): how do i have depression? how did all this upbeat pop rap from my youth not heal me?

**jasannn** (8.5): The dubstep bridge caught me off guard but it works.

**catjoon** (8): edm done right

**FKJVMMP** (8): Probably the best sample he ever used.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): Levels outsold

**musical\_pyn** (8): bridge/breakdown is super cool

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): flo rida is the king of sampling

**TiltControls** (8): me when I listen to Flo Rida

**runaway3212** (7.5): this is good but it feels a bit empty, the sample is used creatively though

**jaztinax** (7): ahh the eternal battle of 2011-2012 when you turned on the radio and didn‚Äôt know if it was levels by avicii or good feeling that was on the first 20 seconds

**plastichaxan** (7): is the chorus annoying as fuck? yeah, does the breakdown(? tickle my brain which i love? also yes

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7): the beginning sounds exactly like the intro to Die Young by Kesha lol

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): I know they were the norm back then but that cheap ass drop ruins the flow of the song for me

**bigbigbee** (6.5): This song samples, "Levels", which actually also samples a different song, "Something's Got a Hold on Me". ogres have layers, onions have layers

**celladonn** (6.5): "Sometimes I get a good feeling" Can't relate

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): Die Young is such a better song. I'm glad Kesha recycled it.

# feels bad man

**1998tweety** (6): i am sorry but i do not like this cause of the chorus

**jsonphile** (6): i mean there‚Äôs really no reason to listen to this when Levels exists

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): flo rida's verses carry this but the chorus feels like someone hollowed me out and propped me up at the beach and told people i was a palm tree and im like "no im a person help me" but etta james' hypnotic vocals make them look the other way

**simplyterific** (4.5): I always found this song kind of annoying sorry

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): the song started and I was immediately disappointed I wasn't listening to Die Young by Kesha

**moonagenightmares** (3): obnoxious

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I like to think that Die Young by Kesha was lowkey plagiarism of this song as revenge for not crediting her on Right Round

# [A Video You all Should Watch](https://youtu.be/jhFrq0yhaPU)

**bigbigbee** (11): I was going to give this a 10 and comment "If I were scoring this based on 'What Song Was Used Best In American Competition Reality Show So You Think You Can Dance', this would get my 11". Or, that's what I wrote a month ago when this rate was announced. But lately, I can't stop thinking about this song - there are so many little things that stick in your head, like it was designed in a lab to be catchy. It also feels symbolic of what I think of when I think of "pop rap", in a way that some other 11 contenders of mine did not, and I think that should be rewarded. God damn, this is a banger.

**1998tweety** (10): one two three four, add that up and its my score!

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): this song taught me how to count in spanish

**CreepyMannequin** (10): hellll yeah

**cremeebrulee** (10): if anyone wanna play a round of this song on tap tap revolution please lmk

**GARjuna** (10): YES GO SHORT MAN

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Was I forced to dress up as Ellen Degeneres and dance to this song as well as Born this Way for a dance recital back in 2011? Maybe‚Ä¶

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song always reminds me of middle school spin class

**jaztinax** (10): ellen degeneres with top 10 of SYTYCD season 5 anyone?? no?? just me?? i know i‚Äôm not the only one with an ellen phase here

**Leixander** (10): i don't understand a thing but i am living.gif

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): my 13yo self's go to song on the just dance ripoff game my friend had on her xbox. Also a huge bop!

**nyoom** (10): Afshin Gholizade, 18, of Tehran, said he knows all of Pitbull's lyrics and likes to dress up like the bald rapper. "It means, 'let's go,'" says Gholizade, who also doesn't speak Spanish or have any ties to Latino culture, but uses #Dale frequently on Twitter. "I learned how to live in life from Pitbull." https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/08/23/342530922/to-pitbull-fans-around-the-world-dale-is-a-way-of-life

**plastichaxan** (10): pitbull having hit after hit iktr

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i will literally give a 10 to any song with counting in it

**TChalla1966** (10): Damn he‚Äôs hot

**Roxieloxie** (9): üíÉüèæ

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.8): Dale. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the comment

**akanewasright** (8.5): My gym teacher played this when we were using dumbbells for some reason. That‚Äôs a fun little association

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): jack if you love me you'll play want me by baby queen as the interlude

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): He called it.

**outsideeyess** (8.5): imma give it ocho and calle it a day

**seanderlust** (8.5): this era of pitbull went off tbh

**frogaranaman** (8): kinda dummy hard

**rslashpoopheads** (8): if you don't like this song it's because I bullied you in middle school

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): a classic

**TiltControls** (8): I Know You Want Me (To have another top 10 hit so the year won't be so shit)

**waluigiest** (8): this facilitated the forever legendary DJ Earworm United States of Pop 2009

**celladonn** (7.5): Albert Hitchcock

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , nobody else wants me

**catjoon** (7): had no business singing this as a pre teen

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ‚Äòlabel flop but pit won‚Äôt stop‚Äô he‚Äôs self aware at least when will your fave

**rickikardashian** (7): a lil repetitive but you dont notice it when you‚Äôre under the influence of a few tequila shots

**thedoctordances1940** (7): This is not very good. I like it.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): One of my favorite songs growing up, I really did find this song so inspirational and fun to listen to at the same time, and it was an opening for me to discover both Lupe's other, more acclaimed work and Modest Mouse's discography so it was also a huge development in broadening my horizons. I know Lupe hates this song and album, but I still really love it and feel like it was important for me and has some of his best work.

**izeasklapaucius** (8): I love this song! The Modest Mouse interpolation is really cool too.

---

**CrimsonROSET** (11): the first song i remember that made me think ‚Äòmaybe fame bad?‚Äô

**jsonphile** (11): god I love this song. I know it‚Äôs a sort of ‚Äúpop sellout‚Äù track that the record label made Lupe do but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not still fantastic. I love the sample/interpolation of Float On, and the song is genuinely inspiring as corny as it may be. It was tough deciding what should be my 11 but in the end I had to give it to this. It genuinely makes me happy and can put me in a better mood.

**TiltControls** (11): Cheesy? Yep. A song Lupe was forced to sell out on? Also yes. A musical masterpiece? 100%!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): best use of a sample in this, a TRIUMPHANT banger that keeps its energy throughout. if we ever do a 2011 year-end rate this is probably my 11 in that as well.

**akanewasright** (10): This was the biggest ‚ÄúTHATS WHAT THIS SONG IS CALLED!?‚Äù moment in the rate for me

**cremeebrulee** (10): if g6 can‚Äôt win, i hope this does

**frogaranaman** (10): this is genuinely one of the greatest songs of all time

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Hard contender for my 11 too.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i forgot about this song omg

**runaway3212** (10): beautiful

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the way this is one of the "deepest" songs in the rate but it‚Äôs fluff by Lupe‚Äôs standards‚Ä¶ anyways what a smash! I love the Modest Mouse interpolation

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): that second verse UGH

**thedoctordances1940** (10): That chorus is just so fucking fantastic

**waluigiest** (10): I remember when this came out and I thought it was a masterpiece. Still kinda do think that!

**xavieryes** (10): Been a while since I've listened to this, but it's still as perfect as ever. This is an easy 11 contender.

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): i named my cat after this guy

**jman457** (9.1): Lupe is like the left‚Äôs version of B.O.B where he was attacked for saying necessary truths of american imperialism during the Obama era.

**Awkward\_King** (9): bop!

**celladonn** (9): Modest Mouse outsold but this is still a bop

**FKJVMMP** (9): Bonus points for mentioning Auckland in a rap song because like every other New Zealander I get unreasonably excited when foreigners notice us, bonus points immediately removed for trying to pronounce it almost identically to Oakland. Also ‚Äúinto‚Äù does not rhyme with ‚Äúwindow‚Äù. I expect this from Mr. Worldwide, not you Lupe.

**moonagenightmares** (9): not as great as i remembered but i still like it a lot

**rslashpoopheads** (9): iconic but also if you've never listened to Lasers please do yourself a service

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**nyoom** (8.5): pop off mousie

**bigbigbee** (8): I know that I just accused Jay Z of lazy sampling earlier, but I think that this sample is great. Also I just happen to like Float On more, I think.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.6): this is overrated a bit by everyone besides Lupe

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I forgot about this but it‚Äôs alright

**jaztinax** (7.5): the guitar is so annoying but the song is a total vibe if we ignore that

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , i hope mine's not.

**slimboyfriend** (7): It's good but I wanted it to end and then there were 1.5 minutes left

**timothy444** (6): A feel good hit that does exactly that, makes you feel good. Unfortunately once that feeling passes, you start to feel just how mediocre the entire song is. Of course though, you can't exactly put 100% on the blame when you realise that he was basically forced to rap and sing about.

**awhile2** (2): i still cant believe this is a lupe fiasco song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): fun fact: did you know Bruno Mars was credited as a cowriter on this song??? It sounds nothing like him, however it does sound like a club classic and a song that fully deserves its day 3 placement in this rate

# the spinning record

**1998tweety** (10): this song is all chorus but thats fine cause its amazing

**awhile2** (10): my dads friend wouldnt let us listen to this song. i always thought it was only about srippers and thats why he wouldnt let us listen to it

**cremeebrulee** (10): not to read too much into a song about giving head, but i like how during the chorus, when flo says ‚Äúfrom the the top of the pole i watch her go down‚Äù, the background also sounds like its descending too

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): IT'S THE SMASHA

**endcreditouilles** (10): these vocal effects are peak 2009

**frogaranaman** (10): when I saw Flo Rida‚Äôs bara tiddies on the album cover it was actually one of my gay awakening moments

**hikkaru** (10): any song introducing kesha to the world is a 10 regardless of actual content. good thing this also slaps

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the moment Kesha became a main pop girl and we didn‚Äôt even know it yet

**jaztinax** (10): i associate this song with my 7th grade crush just because we hung out at some woodsy area that had a lake and i had that song on my phone (mind you this was when having mp3s on your phone was ~exclusive~) and he was like ‚Äúi lOvE that song‚Äù and i felt like a winner

**JunkyGS** (10): The cover for this album (R.O.O.T.S.) was one of my gay awakenings so thank you Flo Rida for that

**outsideeyess** (10): we love ke dollar sign ha

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can't be the only one who was surprised when Tik Tok came out and I learnt Kesha wasn't the woman in this video

**runaway3212** (10): this is such a great song, the way kesha and Flo Rida alternate, the sample is perfectly used it's simple but so effective

**teenwitches** (10): this song would have flopped without the kesha hook

**xavieryes** (10): I'm impressed at how well this song aged, it almost got my 11

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): classic

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this will be redundant for a few songs this rate but this song was huge to me nostalgia wise i can't give it a low score

**seanderlust** (9.5): Flo rida goes down too!! dj Khaled is QUAKING!!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): the way kesha refused to be credited on this and then smashed out of the gate with her own true debut... iconic

**TiltControls** (9.5): this will always be Kesha's breakout anthem to me, cause it was EVERYWHERE in 2009

**astrologicalangel** (9): a classic

**caseyfla** (9): Deeply trashy but also so amazing?

**IIIHenryIII** (9): When you're tired of getting low, it's time to get down.

**imasalesman** (9): honestly a BOP

**moonagenightmares** (9): sampling you spin me round automatically makes this amazing

**waluigiest** (9): Kesha‚Äôs uncredited feature is iconic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): as with Timber, I wish I liked this way more for Kesha‚Äôs sake

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): I love the synths here lmao

**Hulnia** (8): The dumbest sample I‚Äôve ever heard, I love it.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): anything that samples You Spin Me Round gets labelled as camp for life

**skargardin** (8): smash!!

**GARjuna** (7.5): this is a fun song but the original is better. If you like kpop chungha does a fun freestyle to this on OG PD101

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): iconic but I have to dock points for not crediting Kesha for the entirety of the song's chart run

**CrimsonROSET** (7): cheers to fucking dead or alive

**NapsAndNetflix** (7): a reminder that Flo Rida created Kesha so y'all better put some RESPECT on his name

**nyoom** (7): accidental pussy eating anthem

**simplyterific** (7): score is purely for Kesha

**slimboyfriend** (7): how was I in middle school bopping along to this song about head & pole dancing

**static\_int\_husp** (7): tbh 2000s pop rate has a bad habit of flipping 80s samples in the most generic way that it's kinda weird. Also pretty sure this was the first hit Ke$ha was on? (uncredited of course)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this song just didn't age as well as the others for me but fuck can u believe this was kesha's introduction to the world

**akanewasright** (6): This song could be a 10 for me but I can‚Äôt help but think of the fact that, on top of everything we know now, Kesha was not fucking paid for this. She takes the song to the next level, IMO, and she wasn‚Äôt given a cent. Nothing about that sits well with me, considering everything

**jsonphile** (6): I mean it‚Äôs not as good as the 80s classic but it‚Äôs just fun enough and the worlds introduction to Kesha, so it gets a point for that

# down down down

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): I‚Ä¶do not remember a whole annoying instrumental break happening after the chorus what happened to the rap part what is this version on Spotify

**jman457** (5.1): The most memorable part of the song is a sample of a 1980‚Äôs song. Feels very bland even though it was one of the main introductions for Kesha

**catjoon** (5): it just feels empty without my girl Kesha

**timothy444** (5): Production has aged a bit, mehh

**Awkward\_King** (4): if the concept of tuesday was a song

**CreepyMannequin** (4): this is so bad except for Kesha‚Äôs part

**FKJVMMP** (4): I don‚Äôt remember the production being this busy. And not in a fun way like every other Flo Rida song, in an annoying way. Never thought I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúThis Flo Rida song would be better if he turned it down a notch‚Äù, but... Here we are.

**steelstepladder** (3.6): Flo Rida songs are easy to gauge whether they are shit or not because it all comes down to the chorus. This song has a bad chorus.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): during my middle school phase obsessing over both of these artists I felt like this was a letdown compared to the material they both went onto later, but coming back to it in retrospect its a super sweet song and I actually really like it now. Still wild that this was Bruno's introduction to the GP

---

# beautiful girls all over the world

**Leixander** (11): bruno sounds like an angel here, a great introduction to his career

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): the chorus is so good on this one

**cremeebrulee** (10): no but this song is so adorable and for what ‚Ä¶

**endcreditouilles** (10): this was my little sister's favorite song to sing in the car and she always asked me to sing all the hype man parts, so this is for u sis <3

**FKJVMMP** (10): Top 3 pop rap song of all time, I‚Äôm dying on this hill. If I was grading on a curve every other song in this rate except Whistle would be getting a 6 at most, it‚Äôs so much better than everything else in its genre.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This being our introduction to Bruno Mars, a moment I shall never forget

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I miss this kind of chill bop.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is honestly still so good

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I miss the old Bruno, straight from the heart Bruno

**runaway3212** (10): fuck this is amazing

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): loved it then and loved it now

**TChalla1966** (10): Bruno really came out the gate running ugh love that man

**TiltControls** (10): nothing better than doing taxes

**TragicKingdom1** (10): very pleasant and aged beautifully for a song from this era!

**xavieryes** (10): in retrospect, it's kinda weird that Bruno Mars' breakout hit was on a feature with fucking B.o.B, but yeah this song is great and a classic

**emayzee** (9.5): thank you to this song for kickstarting bruno mars's career

**jsonphile** (9.5): this is a delightful song from two new artists that I‚Äôm sure will both experience equal success throughout the 2010s, and neither will ever start spouting off bizarre, easily disproved conspiracy theories

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , i think I've heard this song before, and I didn't liked it ending

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Remember when Bruno had a ‚Äúnice boy to take home‚Äù image

**simplyterific** (9): ugh I forgot how good this song was, wow! All of B.O.B‚Äôs verses are good and memorable and Bruno Mars is just the cherry on top

**waluigiest** (9): I hated Bruno Mars back then but this feature is really pleasant

**jaztinax** (8.5): bruno mars supremacy

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): An unironically good song in the rate

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**akanewasright** (8): This song just put me in a good mood every time I heard it on the radio

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): I struggle to take B.o.B seriously but this song is very sweet and Bruno's great as always

**skargardin** (8): the amount of bruno features in this rate is so funny

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): extra half point for ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the whole package plus you pay your taxes‚Äù

**timothy444** (7.5): A bit corny even when it was just released

**CrimsonROSET** (7): noooo i‚Äôm not cheating on you ur so sweet haha

**frogaranaman** (7): Bruno‚Äôs part is pretty good

**bigbigbee** (6.5): me, seeing that one guy with glasses in the music video, out loud: "Oh my god, Julio!" I hope he doesn't mind being known as Julio by dumb people like me. I think his real name is Phillip.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This song is good but it reminded me of how much I hated early Bruno Mars for sounding overly saccharine

# Tax Fraud

**seanderlust** (6.1): plus you pay your taxes

**hikkaru** (5): most of the adult contemporary pop rap songs from this time don't rly hit much tbh

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): I feel like this a well written pop hook but it does nothing for me, I feel similarly about most of Bruno‚Äôs debut era

**GARjuna** (4): I don't like slow stuff

**nyoom** (4): not b.o.b writing his dc/marvel crack otp into this song https://twitter.com/PaulWilliams_12/status/952007751546241024?s=20

**plastichaxan** (4): sorry i've never been too into bruno mars cause i can't stand straight romance

**jman457** (3.6): where it started it all for Bruno Mars and his useless rap features, and that for say this can burn in hell

**Awkward\_King** (2): NO . no. this song reminds me of my childhood and ??? theres no trauma linked to it but somehow it is horrible and ugly and i dont like it this song is not pleasing to my ears bruno feels droning and b.o.b sounds uninspired

**moonagenightmares** (2): the song that introduced us to bruno, fuck u bob

**CreepyMannequin** (1): I hate Bruno Mars there I said it

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): I knew this would do well from the start, and its a fine enough song but I've never liked it much as a Jay-Z song or as a smash hit. It might be that I've grown up believing in #WestCoastBestCoast but the hook doesn't hit that hard for me and the main takeaway I like is Jay's Sinatra line. Still far from the worst ode to NYC though *sideyes Taylor and Madonna*

**izeasklapaucius** (5): this song makes me tired.

---

**Hulnia** (11): I mean how could I not? Alicia Keys on the chorus is so iconic, and the whole song just makes me feel like I‚Äôm actually there.

**rslashpoopheads** (11): i don't even have a comment this song is just so good

**TChalla1966** (11): This song is just nostalgic and amazing as soon as the beat starts I knew this would be my 11. Alicia voice???!!! jay verses!!! yeah amazing

**teenwitches** (11): concrete jungle wet dream tomato

**thedoctordances1940** (11): This is legitimately one of the best hip-hop beats and songs of all time

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): CONCRETE JUNGLE WET DREAM TOMATO

**celladonn** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3TsZO7otSs

**DaHumanTorch** (10): inb4 concrete jungle wet dream tomato

**endcreditouilles** (10): this video will forever be one of my favorite mashups of all time

**fadedblue09** (10): This song will be rated a hundred times before we rate an Alicia Keys album (and Jay Z too for that matter).

**frogaranaman** (10): when that Vine pointed out that Alicia Keys‚Äô chorus sounds like ‚Äúconcrete jungle wet dream tomato‚Äù the trajectory of my life changed so hard

**ignitethephoenix** (10): future rate winner?

**jman457** (10): what can I say this is a modern classic, love letter to the best city in the world

**jsonphile** (10): honestly probably the best hook out of all the songs on here. Alicia Keys is fantastic, Jay-Z is great here, the beat is great, it‚Äôs a ton of fun and one of the few songs on this list that I‚Äôm not embarrassed to listen to

**Leixander** (10): CONCRETE JUNGLE WET DREAM-

**musical\_pyn** (10): the song just gets better and better as it goes on, big fan

**TiltControls** (10): I don't think this would be a great winner, but it's an amazing song and still worthy of a 10 every time

**waluigiest** (10): This is so lush, I love this song

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Damn, I kinda hated this song back then because it was so overplayed. I couldn't manage to listen to it on my own.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this lack a little flavour compared to the other smashes in this rate, but it‚Äôs still a bop and I can‚Äôt help but scream CONCRETE JUNGLE WET DREAM TOMATO every time it comes on

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.5): concrete jungle wet dream tomato was a cultural reset

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , you blocked Bad Romance to no.1 and that's a rude homophobic act, so minus 1.

**catjoon** (9): an anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i hope this gets bugsnax‚Äôd because i feel the exact same way about it then i did in vgv, where yes it‚Äôs good but this song winning would just be the lamest answer

**skargardin** (9): the only reason this is not getting a ten is because i do not want to see it win

**bigbigbee** (8.5): My friend once was like "Manhattan smells like pee" and I was like, you are being too critical, it's not that bad. But actually it turns out I only visited her in the winter. I went back in the summer and I was like, Oh

**hikkaru** (8.5): i don't want this to win bc it's been rated multiple times already... she's had her chance... but it's a classic i fear

**cherryices** (8): making bacon making bacon pancakes take some bacon and i‚Äôll put it in a pancake bacon pancakes that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna make bacon pancaaake

**GARjuna** (8): too slow for me but nice!

**jasannn** (8): making bacon pancakes

**jaztinax** (8): not me immediately going ‚ÄúBA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA‚Äù in true glee choir style, i must be stopped

**kirby31200** (8): Very good and tasteful in a kinda boring way. I recognize this as a good song but I've never personally cared for it. My mind registers it as commercial music and checks out.

**nyoom** (8): new york sucks!!! more like EW YUCK

**runaway3212** (8): I like New York more as a concept than as a city

**simplyterific** (8): some of these lyrics are so‚Ä¶. I mean ‚Äúeverybody ride her, just like a bus route‚Äù was so cringey I can‚Äôt

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): concrete jungle wet dream tomatoooo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): is it true that katy's california girls was a response to this song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): concrete bunghole where dreams are made up, theres nothing you can do

**plastichaxan** (7.5): kinda annoying but kinda a classic

**bulforster** (7): Concrete. Jungle. Wet dream. Tomato. Long ago the four borough of New York lived together in harmony...

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is never winning a rate and the sooner we accept this, the sooner we can stop rating it

**slimboyfriend** (6): idk, as someone from the Midwest who's visited friends in NYC, it's kinda very overrated

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): cOnCrEtE jUnGlE wEt DrEaM tOmAtO

**cremeebrulee** (5): the way i did not realize alicia keys was from nyc because her verse on this song sounds so corny

**ImADudeDuh** (5): West Coast Best Coast

**akanewasright** (4): if this wins I will not be impressed.

**timothy444** (4): This song goes on for way too long and as a non-american, it just sounds like boastful singing. Idk crucify me for not liking this but it's just so boring. Feels like watered down Jay-Z

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): LISTEN LISTEN listen its an undeniably culturally important song and i really appreciate how grand it is and i dont think a lot is objectively bad about it, but i hate the production so much. sure part of the distaste is probably because of how overplayed it is but you cant blame me this song is fucking played so much.

**RandomHypnotica** (1): Part of the fun of this rate is not taking any songs seriously. it's all just pure fun, don't look into the lyrics or think about it too much, and most of these songs in any other rate would totally flop. So that's why I was so confused to see this here. It just doesn't fit this rate and all, and considering the rest of my scores are based on just how silly, overboard and fun these songs are, I'm giving this a low score because this song is just far too serious for this rate.

**rickikardashian** (0): this did not need to be added to this rate and im protesting the decision to do so

**moooo566** (11): man, remember rihanna? what even happened to her its like she just vanished from the industry or something

**skargardin** (11): I actually rediscovered this fairly recently and I just adore this song. Everyone ate obviously but Rih's hook is just so chefskiss.

**akanewasright** (10): rate winner RiRi

**cremeebrulee** (10): a fucking TRIO whew

**CrimsonROSET** (10): now this? This is a fucking classic, and I have no problem with it winning.

**fadedblue09** (10): Congratulations to 2-time rate winners Jay Z and Rihanna and 5-time rate winner Kanye West.

**frogaranaman** (10): I don‚Äôt think they actually ran around the entire town in a single night that seems like a lot of work for little reward

**Hulnia** (10): Kanye kinda carries to be honest, but the other verses are pretty good too.

**JunkyGS** (10): This should get my 11 but Britney has a chokehold on my heart at the moment.....

**nyoom** (10): new york rocks!!! more like NAH WERK

**runaway3212** (10): all contributors are at their best here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Rihanna‚Äôs part has a similar dark, sexy Disturbia with rock n‚Äô roll swagger and Kanye‚Äôs verse is more clever than I gave it credit for. Jay-Z is also there and he‚Äôs good.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): 14 year old me thought i was so cool listening to this song

**TChalla1966** (10): we really should have more between these 3 but oh well

**TiltControls** (10): everyone on the track absolutely slays it here. Also this is might be Rihanna's best feature tbh

**jman457** (9.6): One of Rihanna‚Äôs best ever features and it feels so cinematic

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): wow I didn‚Äôt know the Fenty girl made music

**jsonphile** (9.5): it‚Äôs kind of amazing how much more talented these three artists are compared to most of the other artists on here. It‚Äôs one of the best songs on this playlist and I wouldn‚Äôt even put it in the top 20 for any of these artists

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?

**simplyterific** (9.5): illuminati songs just hit different idk (+1 point for kanye washing jay z with just one verse)

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , quality music here BRUV.

**musical\_pyn** (9): I wish everyone was on my dick; homo

**GARjuna** (8.5): kanye is pretty good

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): It's good. Nothing special about it though.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.5): does it sound like a duck quacking in the background to anyone else

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): riri we still waiting for R9

**Awkward\_King** (8): this aint bad at all but a collab between these three artists should not be this forgettable. but in this rate forgettable over controversial might work to its advantage djsjddjs

**hikkaru** (8): rihanna's hook is so good

**Leixander** (8): rihanna and the production can only carry this so far

**Roxieloxie** (8): nice but Rihanna sounds like someone tried to pitch her to avoid copyright on youtube

**steelstepladder** (8): Middle school football would not be same without this song

**thedoctordances1940** (8): For such an insane collab I'd kinda expect more tbh

**waluigiest** (8): quack

**ImADudeDuh** (7.9): 8tracks Mafia AU playlists snapped‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ wait did kanye just say no homo

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Rihanna.

**kirby31200** (7): Takes me back to being 10 listening to the Rihanna parts and skipping over everyone else

**static\_int\_husp** (7): sorry "no homo" lyric from Kanye brought it down a little bit

**timothy444** (5.5): Not that bad but I really can't see how this could've been a hit without the star power of the three artists featured because it's such an average-sounding song

**jackisboredtoday** (10): a FUCKING BANGER, I swear this song goes so hard. The production is solid but Flo sounds great over it, but Nicki elevates this from like an 8 to a 10 with one of the best verses of her legendary run of early guest verses. This song is the reason I went to look up who is Peabo Bryson

---

**awhile2** (11): this is th number one song by a massive margin and i expect popheads to recognize that

**hikkaru** (11): LOOK AT HOW NICKI ATE THAT!!!! NO CRUMBS!!!!!

**rickikardashian** (11): i thought there were so many girls in here flo rida, why do you need to ask where them girls at like you‚Äôre dora the explorer trying to find swiper?

**seanderlust** (11): WHAT is nicki talking about in this verse and why does it slap

**slimboyfriend** (11): Nicki Minaj outraps every person in this rate (including herself on the B.o.B. song), this is one of the least ugly David Guetta beats, and Flo Rida...... is there.

**1998tweety** (10): nicki icon, an 11 contender tbh

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): banger

**akanewasright** (10): The song is already really fun a minute in‚Ä¶ and then Nicki comes in and fucking annihilates her verse completely

**bulforster** (10): Nicki's verse is utter nonsense but she still ate.

**cremeebrulee** (10): WHY‚ÄôD I START MY VERSE LIKE THAT?????

**DaHumanTorch** (10): NO NO I DON'T ENDORSE THAT PPPPAUSE THAT ABORT THAT

**frogaranaman** (10): holy shit I forgot just how fucking HARD this track goes wow

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Nicki‚Äôs most iconic verse outside Monster you can‚Äôt change my mind on this

**kirby31200** (10): I don't know Nicki, why did you start your verse like that?

**nootnoot781** (10): i quote nicki‚Äôs verse daily

**plastichaxan** (10): fun summer bop for the girls to dance to it's true

**RandomHypnotica** (10): put me with the other license renewal comments

**runaway3212** (10): Nicki steals every song she's in it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): suddenly I‚Äôm a Barb

**simplyterific** (10): Dae-dae-dae-dae-dae-dae-dae-dae-dae

**skargardin** (10): I think this song was the first time I heard of Nicki, I still absolutely love it.

**TChalla1966** (10): nicki verse is just‚Ä¶everything!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i dont know what entity possessed nicki minaj here but i love her for it

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): PAUSE THAT. ABORT THAT

**waluigiest** (10): got a friend for my homegirl Lily? Lily? Lily? Lily?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): Yo! It's PB! PB! Who's Peabo Bryson?

**jasannn** (9): They all understood the assignment

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): YO IT'S PB PB WHO'S PB BRYSON TWO YEARS AGO I RENEWED MY LICENCE

**rslashpoopheads** (9): https://i.imgur.com/M8lppIY.png

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): nicki's verse is potentially the most iconic in this rate

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I wish Nicki's verse were more like Flo Today's, you know? Objectifying men just like he did with women. Sounds great though.

**jman457** (8.5): David Guetta truly has no talent other than creating fun bangers. Also one of Nicki‚Äôs best guest verses.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , Nicki made this good.

**Awkward\_King** (8): honestly shit like this makes me understand why barbz are as annoying as they are

**celladonn** (8): Nicki will really just say anything, huh

**CrimsonROSET** (8): say what you will about nicki (and i have) she can carry the shit out of a song

**nyoom** (8): david guetta: friendship is magic

**Roxieloxie** (8): no cause where the fuck are the girls at

**cherryices** (7.9): this is an ode to friendship. flo wants to know where the girls are ‚Äúso we can all be friends‚Äù

**TiltControls** (7.5): nicki kills it here!

**catjoon** (7): her verse made no sense but I still ate it up ü§™

**Leixander** (7): nicki's verse is the peak of music

**ImADudeDuh** (6): my room ahaha

**jaztinax** (6): this song is so annoying but so catchy damnit

**timothy444** (6): Nicki Minaj ruins this song.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): While I do really like some flo rida, this is really him at his worst. At least Nicki is alright though.

**steelstepladder** (4.3): Really don't like how chiptune this sounds, and the autotune on Mr. Rida's voice is grating as hell

**jsonphile** (4): Flo Rida is as generic as ever, David Guetta has another boring generic club beat, and Nicki Minaj...well this isn‚Äôt exactly her best work either

**fadedblue09** (1): This is a David Guetta hate account [2]

**FKJVMMP** (1): Crazy how every David Guetta song sounds exactly the same but some of them are only kind of bad and some make my ears bleed.

This tweet and a few of the responses are perfection. I especially like the response that I can't find that says that the song is about object permanence.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Everyone wins with this track. Gays, straights, bisexuals, the pluses, all of them.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): a song which was HUGE, but honestly this came to prominence in 2014 and that was after I was done with middle school and so I never developed quite the depth of nostalgia for this as I did many other songs here.

---

**1998tweety** (11): her last hit :/

**caseyfla** (11): This is what we call Pop Rap PERFECTION.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): song of the universe right here i'm afraid

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): the chorus on this is so catchy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): if you guys dont mind i‚Äôm gonna add a little hip hop to this hoedown

**frogaranaman** (10): I kind of want them to do another song together

**ignitethephoenix** (10): literal classic, when this comes on when you are on the dance floor, it‚Äôs an exhilarating moment

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimber!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): there‚Äôs like no way this loses the rate, right?

**jaztinax** (10): kesha makes any chorus better

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): ill be shocked if this doesnt win tbh

**outsideeyess** (10): we love ke dollar sign ha

**rickikardashian** (10): when you get so yee you start getting haw

**rslashpoopheads** (10): the way Kesha literally made these mens careers

**seanderlust** (10): on one hand, dr. luke is involved with this one so i'm tempted to deduct points because fuck that guy. on the other hand, GOD this slaps. when timber (kesha's version) comes out we WILL be streaming.

**simplyterific** (10): an absolute BANGER. If Kesha says you better dance, you better dance. The infectious beat with Kesha‚Äôs vocals makes this song pure perfection

**skargardin** (10): it was and will always be the moment

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): is it possible to give this score any less than a 10

**TChalla1966** (10): This song is everything and more what a perfect collab

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Kesha really steals the show unleashing her country twang

**TiltControls** (10): defined my undergrad!! the perfect blend of country and dance (all the behind the scenes stuff sucks though)

**timothy444** (10): The peak of both Pitbull's and Ke$ha's careers

**celladonn** (9.5): Yeehaw

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.5): anyone remember those god-awful parodies on youtube, ‚ÄúGinger‚Äù

**jman457** (9.3): This song is objectively dog shit but that tik tok song with Ride is so ingrained in my mind that if this won it woul be a Lana. Right. Right??

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , i don't know what else to say but yeah.

**astrologicalangel** (9): would have been a 10, but overplay killed it for me

**Hulnia** (9): Since when is this not Kesha‚Äôs song. üò≠ Like it‚Äôs good, but I never associate with Pitbull...

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): iconic

**Roxieloxie** (9): Firmly associate this song with one of my tumblr mutuals way back when

**teenwitches** (9): one of the few songs i heard at both the club and at country dancehalls

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): I think I used to hate this song with a passion. I kinda still do.

**Awkward\_King** (8): all men who arent pitbull need to self improve

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): despite some um, choiceful lyrics from Pitbull in the first verse, this is catchy and Kesha‚Äôs hook is irresistible

**slimboyfriend** (8): kesha absolutely carries this song

**nyoom** (7): "look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, nah, it's just me" - the tree falling on me ke$ha tried to warn me about

**steelstepladder** (7): This has unfortunately shrunk on me a bit after I realized it's like 80% chorus.

**waluigiest** (7): I‚Äôve really lost interest in this song over time

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): so overplayed but extra points for Kesha‚Äôs parts

**catjoon** (5): I love me some Kesha but‚Ä¶

**akanewasright** (4): this would have been a much higher score for me in an alternate universe where Dr. Luke was a good person and where Kesha didn‚Äôt go through what she did. But between the live performances of this where Kesha looks like she‚Äôs on the verge of passing out and the fact that Dr. Luke blocked all writers from being paid because Kesha‚Äôs mon wouldn‚Äôt take her name off the credits‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs uncomfy now. Kesha does a great job but that‚Äôs too much baggage for a basic ass pop rap song

**GARjuna** (4): pitbull saves this tbh but the lyrics are h e l p

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): Even Kesha can't sell this clusterfuck.

**runaway3212** (3): I just think this misses what makes both Kesha or Pitbull special

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (2.5): i hate this song

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Another feel-good track from Flo Rida.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): a good song that has been forever elevated in my mind by the moment it plays in Hustlers (2019), which manages to make this Flo Rida hook sound like the music of the gods

---

**catjoon** (11): this was in the step up 3 sound track and it just reminds of a good time in my life so it‚Äôs getting my 11

**xavieryes** (11): I already liked this when it came out, but a few years after forgetting about its existence, it grew on me again so much and now it's my favorite Flo Rida song and one of my favorite hits of the 2010s.

**1998tweety** (10): call me Camila Cabello cause this song injects nicotine, heroin, and morphine into me

**astrologicalangel** (10): this gives me nostalgia I didn't know I had

**celladonn** (10): Ummm this is a banger

**cremeebrulee** (10): more like i have never been able to handle any club i‚Äôve been to

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have too many good memories with this song to not give this a 10.

**endcreditouilles** (10): timeless. The club has never been able to handle me.

**frogaranaman** (10): why was I getting so fucking crunk in middle school

**hikkaru** (10): the nostalgia rush of this

**ignitethephoenix** (10): dead serious, this was the first song I purchased off itunes

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I slept on this song for so long‚Ä¶ Goddamn it!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i have a very vivid memory of watching a live episode of america‚Äôs got talent where a guy danced to this song and it was very ok and he had some dancers with him but it made me think ‚Äúhow do they expect him to win and then get a live show in las vegas where he entertains people with this?‚Äù

**nyoom** (10): the club is at max capacity right now! the club cannot admit me right now! but i don't respect fire safety regulations and i'm going in anyway!

**outsideeyess** (10): i tried but i can't not give this a 10

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what i tell my friends so i don't have to actually go clubbing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the essence of early 10s pop rap and early 10s EDM colliding

**simplyterific** (10): do you know what I would do to go back in time and experience this song at a dirty club in 2010‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**skargardin** (10): It was this close to getting my 11, I actually think i gave it my 11 last time around we rated it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): literally one of the biggest bangers of all time, i unironically love this song and think its amazing

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): thinking about how nicole scherzinger was too irrelevant to be credited on this and yet david guetta who didnt even sing on it still made it on

**TiltControls** (10): very VERY nearly an 11. This is just happiness in song form

**timothy444** (10): This just screams "party anthem" and I know there's already a song in this rate about party rocking but this is the ultimate feel good club banger you would put when the party just feels a little bit too quiet and you want to liven up the place a little. You get me?

**GARjuna** (9): I MISS THIS SONG!! So many white girls would scream-sing this chorus

**jsonphile** (9): okay this is actually a total bop. As usual Flo Rida is the least interesting part of the song, but god that hook is just so dang catchy and fun. And this might be David Guetta‚Äôs best work

**runaway3212** (9): This is just david guetta goodness and Flo Rida slays it too

**seanderlust** (9): shoutout to the uncredited nicole scherzinger!! this is a legendary bop. flo rida in this era really was the king of "turn your brain off and vibe" bops. this was peak maximalist 2010s pop - and yes, that means it was all downhill from here :grinny:

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The early 2010s really was the best time in history for choruses wasn't it?

**Leixander** (8.5): the uncredited vocals are always the best part of the florida songs

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): who doesn't love a Scarface reference in their club banger?

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): an absolute showstopper, but I have to deduct points AGAIN because this man just straight up can't credit women to save his misogynistic ass

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): it will never not send me that nicole scherzinger was too much of a flop to include as a credit on this

**plastichaxan** (8): me when i'm at the club and have had too much and become the most annoying person in there

**static\_int\_husp** (8): middle school dances loved to play songs called "Club Can‚Äôt Handle Me"

**waluigiest** (8): when David Guetta controlled pop

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): I haven‚Äôt heard this in like 84 years this really took me back

**Awkward\_King** (7): for a while i didnt realise his name was because he was from florida

**jaztinax** (6.5): super catchy but it never stuck with me

**jman457** (6.4): Its a fun song but I like completely forgot this song existed which probably points to how memorable it is.

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Was never a fan of this one

**awhile2** (5): TIL Nicole Scherzinger sings background vocals on the chorus

**FKJVMMP** (5): The fact this album is called ‚ÄúOnly One Flo‚Äù is sending me. We know man, we know.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): I've spent years during the early 2010s believing this was my #1 favorite song of all time, and I still love it in a way I kinda have trouble describing because it was so formative to me as a kid. Up until the final few days of this rate, this was actually on track to win the whole rate, which had me extremely excited before a few ballots in a row came through to tank it. This is top 5 but still a robbery to be honest

---

# people with taste

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): , i swear to my Pastafarian minister, I'll rip your scalp off like a deranged French hippie if you give this a lower score than 7

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): this gets my 11 based solely on the fact that my queen Hayley Williams does the chorus

**1998tweety** (10): https://www.deviantart.com/bluedog444/art/MordeTwi-Airplanes-319272821

**akanewasright** (10): Hayley Williams I am free on Thursday I am free on Thursday Hayley Williams to have lunch on Thursday Hayley Williams

**astrologicalangel** (10): the nostalgia is strong with this one

**celladonn** (10): Out of all the songs in this rate I probably have the most nostalgia for this one

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): THIS HAS BEEN HAYLEY ALL THIS TIME?!

**endcreditouilles** (10): throwback to when my myspace status was "can we pretend that the airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? I just really need a wish rn" mood set to: "blah"

**frogaranaman** (10): I was absolutely in my feels with this song in middle school for no genuine reason at all

**Hulnia** (10): While the version with Eminem is so much better, I can‚Äôt say this version isn‚Äôt the masterpiece that it is. Also, that chorus though. üò©

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Damn, I forgot how good this song is.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shipping/images/c/c9/D5a34hh-3eaf1fb5-107a-4852-9991-2ae81043a2fe.png/revision/latest?cb=20200713000033

**jaztinax** (10): this is THE song of 2010

**musical\_pyn** (10): is this a 10? eh probably not. will I still give it a 10? yes.

**nootnoot781** (10): this, along with a11 of the 11ights used to be my favourite thing to listen to as an 11 year old. ugh take me back to when i had no responsibility :(

**RandomHypnotica** (10): pls paramore, pretend this is an emo rate

**Roxieloxie** (10): this would absolutely be the most PH winner because it would be solely winning for the haley feature but like,,, I tried doing this rate a few nights ago when I was sad and i just started looping this. B.o.B.'s verse on this is actually really good, and like, they're right i could really use a wish rn

**rslashpoopheads** (10): OK, I think when they say "Can we pretend that Airplanes in the night time are shooting star", they mean like shooting stars are not-so-common, so when you go out at night, you'll see airplanes in the night sky and they kinda look like shooting star, even though they're not.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): can we pretend that chemtrails over the flat earth are like shooting stars? anyways‚Ä¶ this is really a 10 for Hayley

**simplyterific** (10): no Hayley we cannot because that would be silly

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): is it too early for this to be considered a classic

**TChalla1966** (10): the original and the remix are so good excellence luvs

**teenwitches** (10): when i was 14 i was convinced music didn't get deeper than this

**TiltControls** (10): iconic

**timothy444** (10): https://www.deviantart.com/bluedog444/art/MordeTwi-Airplanes-319272821

**cherryices** (9): stares out schoolbus window

**jasannn** (9): Why is every track with "Airplane" in its song title a smash? Stream f(x)'s and Mag Bay's Airplane :thots:

**jsonphile** (9): this song just hits different now I don‚Äôt know. Something about Hayley Williams‚Äô voice just makes me emotional and nostalgic

**outsideeyess** (9): such an iconic and random af collaboration

**plastichaxan** (9): bob rapping isn‚Äôt great but hayley makes this song so good

**skargardin** (9): yes we can

**waluigiest** (9): Facebook status the house down boots

**seanderlust** (8.2): I peaked comedically when I was working retail and this song came out and I posted on Facebook "can we pretend my shift is 8 hours long so I can go on lunch? I could really use some fish right now, fish right now, fish right now." been chasing that high ever since

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Classic but I never loved this song it was so overplayed back in the day

**runaway3212** (8): This song is about as deep as a puddle but I love Hayley Williams

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): Can we üå†pretend that üò¢üå†üò¢üå†üò¢üå† airplanes in üçÜüå†üçÜ the night üå†üò¢sky are üë¥üò¢ like üå†shootingüå† üí• üå†stars? üå†üî∞ I üòé could üöÖ really üëÄ use a üëå üå†wishüå† right üëå now, üçëüå†üëã üå†wishüå† üò¢ right üíªüå† now, üå†wishüå†üçÜüçÜüå† üôèüéÅüå† right üî´üíæ now üò≠ Can we pretend that üå†airplanes in the üèî night üò¥ sky are like shooting stüå†ARüå†s? üò¢üò¢ I could üíñ‚ùåüò¢ really üëΩüå†üëÄüò¢ use üòÇüëé a üÖ±üò©üå† wish üå†üôè right now, üò¢üå†wish üå†üéÅ right üë≠ now, ‚¨áüò¢üï• üå†wishüå† right üëãüåÉüò¢ now üò§üçÜüå†üò¢

**TragicKingdom1** (8): very cringe in retrospect but there are parts that are genuinely very good

**hikkaru** (7.5): we love hayley but that's it tbh

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): this was so overplayed it became annoying, the song itself is not bad tho

**rickikardashian** (7.5): where‚Äôs that drawing of mordecai and twilight sparkle crying to the lyrics of this song

**jman457** (7.2): Like Love the way you lie but worse

**avg-vag** (7): hayley serves, the rest is blah

**FKJVMMP** (7): You gotta really fuck something up to have Hayley Williams on the hook and get less than a 7. So good job B.o.B, you did the bare minimum.

**NapsAndNetflix** (7): facebook statuses everywhere are quaking

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): I used to love this song when it came out but now the only part that stands out is Hayley on the chorus, the rest of the song is kind of meh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): my favorite part of this song is the start, the rest is eh

**nyoom** (6): airplanes by *hayley williams ft. b.o.b

# ballots i should have lost somewhere oh no

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i would let hayley williams spit in my mouth but this is a 5.5

**cremeebrulee** (4): b.o.b is unbearable on this so i‚Äôm not sorry!!!!! ily hayley but you can‚Äôt save this song for me!!!!

**steelstepladder** (3.6): Man this is such a powerful and emotionally intense chorus that B.o.B. decided to bitch about how he has a career in music with. I'm just imagining his boss walking in and saying something like "Hey B.o.B. do you think we could see that song you're working on next week." and then he imagines Hailey Williams beside him to get him through that painful heartache. He couldn't have written this song about literally anything else? Literally anything other than how rapping for a living is the worst thing ever? And even if I like the overall concept, now that we have Chinese Satellite by Phoebe Bridgers I have no reason to return to this. Biggest waste of potential in the rate by far where even the strengths turn into weaknesses due to how winy and uninspired B.o.B. is here.

**GARjuna** (3): also boring!!

**Leixander** (3): a meme

**sssaaage** (0): im sorry i cant stand this song

**izeasklapaucius** (10): YES, I went through an LMFAO phase back in middle school. YES, I cringed on it a few years later. NO, I am now embracing it as a part of my identity <3

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): this is camp for straight people. I liked it at the time but tbh its grown off me ever since. Its extremely iconic though so even if I'm not super into it anymore I can't begrudge it a high placement. LMFAO - from the no 11s list to a top 5 finish.

---

# no led in our zeppelin

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): this is truly an iconic song. You could not escape it, it was everywhere. I think this is the first song I watched go viral.

**endcreditouilles** (11): ‚Äúi wish i had olivia rodrigo when i was 15‚Äù was party rock anthem not enough for you

**nyoom** (11): i hope that whoever first figured out this song has the same bpm as the evangelion opening is having an incredible day

**static\_int\_husp** (11): No matter what anyone says this will always be a certified bop.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**akanewasright** (10): This song is good, actually

**CrimsonROSET** (10): congratulations to all the brave soldiers who are giving this a 11 only for 1. Be the first to give LMFAO a 11 and 2. It to still go out day 2 max

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This is my most reluctant 10 ever. The drop itself is ICONIC as fuck and deserves this score, but I hate everything else about this, and it was way too popular for its own good, smh...

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow this is their only good song huh

**FKJVMMP** (10): ‚ÄúRunnin through these hoes like Draino‚Äù is the Plan 9 of so-bad-it‚Äôs-good dance rap lyrics.

**frogaranaman** (10): absolutely shitty song. terrible. anyways it‚Äôs a ten becau-

**hikkaru** (10): just gonna quote my billboard decade end comment here: the way people think they're too good to not go absolutely fucking feral when those opening synths come in

**ignitethephoenix** (10): charlie xox who? Dorino electro who? Sayyytor who? I only acknowledge LMFAO as the kings of hyper pop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Just Dance 3 classic

**jasannn** (10): No thoughts.

**Leixander** (10): GET UP, GET DOWN, PUT YOUR HANDS UP TO THE SUN

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): cringey as fuck but honestly this is a banger

**nootnoot781** (10): is this actually a 10? no, but any other score feels wrong.

**plastichaxan** (10): that was a classic

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): when this song came out me and my friends were convinced it was the best song to ever be released in the history of music and honestly we were right

**RandomHypnotica** (10): how tf did this get so robbed the last time we rated this??

**rickikardashian** (10): closest we‚Äôve been to world peace

**Roxieloxie** (10): party rockers in the fucking house !!!! tonight !!!

**runaway3212** (10): the video for this is pure insanity but it's so great

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): remember a time when we took party rocking for granted?

**seanderlust** (10): i'm on mobile someone add the zootopia comic edit

**simplyterific** (10): the nostalllgiiaaaaaa!!!! I am very glad to have been alive while this song took over pop culture. If I heard this at a club today I‚Äôd probably still go off the same way I used to when it first came out

**skargardin** (10): yes i've come around to liking this in the what, three times it's been rated now. growth i think

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): can you say iconic bc this song is iconic

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): a bop i'm afraid

**thedoctordances1940** (10): If you don't like this you don't like fun

**xavieryes** (10): This song is the epitome of mindless fun EDM-pop and I am here for it. I listened to this song on repeat literally hundreds of times in 2011 and I still love it. This song just wants you to have a good time, and it accomplishes that.

**teenwitches** (9.9): would have been a 10 if i didn't have to see every white dude shuffling at parties for like 5 years after this came out

**bulforster** (9.5): "I'm running through these hoes like Drano" is Cupcakke levels of unhinged.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i believe in god now

**kirby31200** (9): Hating is bad

**awhile2** (8): im in miami is the goat lmfao song and its a crime yall didnt include it in this rate

**GARjuna** (8): IMPORTANT FOR THE CULTURE

**jaztinax** (8): i do indeed be shufflin‚Äô every day

**rslashpoopheads** (8): the cooler Closer

**timothy444** (8): Gave this a 7 last time I rated this, thought I'd just bump it up a bit lol

**TiltControls** (7.5): can't wait for this to get 20 11's to counteract the current no-0 streak they've got going on

**cherryices** (7.2): ‚Äúparty rockers in the house tonight‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs party rock is‚Äù passionate kissing

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , this is fun, not gonna lie, but it aged uglier than my grandma's saggy breasts.

**astrologicalangel** (7): o

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Never was a big fan of this one. I love Lauren's part though. I'm assuming she's the girl on the track (?)

**catjoon** (6.5): cute little shuffling anthem

**jsonphile** (6.5): okay LMFAO you made one good song

**waluigiest** (6): the gorilla grip this had on everyone‚Ä¶

# STOP..... Hatin is bad

**jman457** (5.8): this song was beyond overplayed in 2011 where I dont think I will ever enjoy listening to it again

**slimboyfriend** (1): pls stop making me rate this song over and over again

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): I wish I could give multiple zeroes but Sexy And I Know It is far worse so this one gets one point I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I know this is a #1 hit but I did not expect at the start of this rate to see it make it so far, let alone be the highest Pitbull song and a top 3 finisher. I do like the song quite a bit though, every contributor is playing their part so well, from Ne-Yo's hook to the title touches like Nayer's whisper-singing

---

# go girl give us everything

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Probably my favorite Pitbull song, just 100% a bop

**jasannn** (11): This song sounds like a New Year's Eve Party in the best possible way.

**martian\_pet** (11): this eleven is brought to you by kodak but seriously i love this song i've never paid attention to the lyrics and im not starting now but this is great

**1998tweety** (10): idc the lyrics are iconic

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): grab somebody sexy tell them HEY, im so sorry. That was.. like.. really rude, invading your personal space like that, unless... you... liked it? No? You‚Äôre good? Okay. I‚Äôm gonna go over there now. Bye.

**akanewasright** (10): If this is not top 5 there is something horribly wrong with the sub

**bigbigbee** (10): I like this so much that I thought it was because I heard a minecraft parody of it back in the day, but I was wrong

**celladonn** (10): How does this have so many hooks, my god

**CreepyMannequin** (10): it‚Äôs the Kodak/Kodak rhyme that makes this song

**emayzee** (10): go girls give us everything!

**endcreditouilles** (10): put this song on during sex and guarantee i'll start crying

**frogaranaman** (10): this is actually pop perfection, fun fact

**hikkaru** (10): the opening chords strike me right in the heart

**Hulnia** (10): You heard him, give this song everything. Not my favourite of them all now, but back then it definitely was.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Excuse me, this deserves a full score.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Kodiak, Alaska walmart iconic

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): this used to GO OFF at my local under 18s club night, still a huge banger

**plastichaxan** (10): this is such an easy ten Ne-Yo if you see this i‚Äôm free every day really

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): simple but still one of the best songs on the list. if the entire song was just ne-yo‚Äôs part i‚Äôd probably give it my eleven

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i genuinely thought this was a Ne-Yo song with a Pitbull feature, not the other way

**rickikardashian** (10): kodak snapped hard with this ad

**Roxieloxie** (10): The absolute dream group project, everyone is giving it their fucking all, assignment was turned in on time, an 100% plus extra credit! Do you know the sheer confidence you have to have to rhyme Kodak with kodak and pull it off?????

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): go boys give us everything

**simplyterific** (10): Me not giving this song a 10? Yeah right picture that with a kodak

**skargardin** (10): the nostalgia is SO strong here ugh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): remember that facebook page in 2011 that was like "why is everybody grabbing me and shouting hey" that was inspired by this song

**teenwitches** (10): all i can think about is pitch perfect when i hear this

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I have such fond memories of this song, anything less than a 10 would be an insult to it.

**TiltControls** (10): the kodak lines are the cheeiest things ever, but I wouldn't trade them for the world

**timothy444** (10): was a 10 last time we rated this, it still is a 10 several rates later

**xavieryes** (10): An 11 contender. So much nostalgia and just pure fun.

**steelstepladder** (9.8): Sooooooooo close to a 10 but I just don't like the deflating balloon sound

**jaztinax** (8.5): pitch perfect did it better but the ‚Äúgrab somebody sexy tell em hey‚Äù is probably THE perfect transition to a chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): okay maybe he rhymed Kodak with Kodak, but you still vividly remember that fact 10 years later so honestly he stays winning

**caseyfla** (8): Honestly had never heard this song by itself, just as part of the Pitch Perfect medley. They did it better tbh but it's still pretty great on its own!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): pitch perfect bitches make some noise

**static\_int\_husp** (8): despite some of the cringey lyrics, this is still a bop

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): Take a picture of that with a kodak

**waluigiest** (8): the most dominant radio song in my memory. It could be that I was on a road trip in summer 2011, but it played at least hourly

**jman457** (7.8): this what inoffensive great pop songs should all strive to be

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.5): Fat Amy and Cynthia Rose outsold them

**catjoon** (7): got ate up on his own song again! Ne-Yo voice sounds great

**jsonphile** (6.5): say what you will about Pitbull but no one else has ever had the sheer confidence needed to rhyme Kodak with Kodak

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): used to love this but theres too much going on

**Awkward\_King** (6): i want to give this song both a 9 and a 3 so i used a calculator and it told me to give it a 6

# me not working hard?

**nyoom** (6): honestly gives me nothing tonight

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Thank you Ne Yo

**GARjuna** (5): the beat is good but there's something about it.....pitch perfect nostalgia can't save it

**runaway3212** (5): this is great but also just so so so bad

**outsideeyess** (3.5): this song does nothing for me. the hook is so boring.

**FKJVMMP** (1): Kodak joke.

**izeasklapaucius** (11): Can we talk about how great of an achievement this song is? It's the first song by Asian-American act to reach #1 on BBH100!!! And being the first song by act of East Asian origin since 1963 to do so!!! All the while being a perfect throwback song for so many people in the early 2010s. Also I had a crush on both of The Cataracs guys back then lmao.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): It's the smasha, and one of the favorites to win from the moment this was announced. The electroclash beat here is everything I want in pop music and I am DESPERATE for that sound to return. This would have been an extremely deserving winner, but sadly it couldn't survive one zero that made the difference between this and the song which went on to win

---

**akanewasright** (11): is this a bop? Yes. Does this encapsulate this time period perfectly? Yes. But is it a perfect song? Yes

**cremeebrulee** (11): literally invented aviation, middle school dances, snowstorms, asian american pacific islanders, sexy lizards, etc etc etc

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): BEATSENSERS LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**moonagenightmares** (11): great memories of being 11 and listening to this in the car nonstop on a cd i made where i put this as the first song while my mom was running errands

**plastichaxan** (11): this is the easiest 11 i‚Äôve ever given in a rate

**RandomHypnotica** (11): i've never been to a club in my life, but for this song i'll get slizzared and sip sizzurp

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): A song to go absolutely feral to!!! Even when I‚Äôm a sober girl, I really am acting like I‚Äôm drunk the second I hear ‚Äúpopping bottle in the ice‚Äù. Proto-hyperpop, a collapse, etc. I will be generous and assume that Dev‚Äôs ride is parked while she‚Äôs sipping sizzurp or she‚Äôs not in the driver‚Äôs seat, drunk driving is not cute girl!

**simplyterific** (11): this is one of the few songs from this era that has aged like wine instead of milk. The lyrics are unironcially amazing and the song manages to start off with high energy and carry the momentum until the end. It‚Äôs irresistible catchiness could convince even the shyest of introverts to party hard, making this an obvious choice for my 11. Who doesn‚Äôt wanna feel fly like a G6?

**waluigiest** (11): is this hyperpop?

**1998tweety** (10): reset

**bigbigbee** (10): As an Asian American, I normally have little time for the way that certain Asian American people co-opt black culture and think they get a pass because they're not white. But for this...um....iamlookingaway i love this song

**catjoon** (10): it‚Äôs just something bout that song that makes you get up and bust a move

**celladonn** (10): I remember hating this song when it came out but ever year since I have liked it a little more. Aged like a fine wine.

**emayzee** (10): invented looking camp straight in the eye, karlie kloss whom?

**endcreditouilles** (10): yer a slizzard harry

**frogaranaman** (10): I‚Äôm going to shit myself this is still so good

**jasannn** (10): ‚ú® like a blizzard‚ú®

**Leixander** (10): we're ALL getting slizzard

**nootnoot781** (10): this song is like the equivalent of pushing one of your loose teeth that isn‚Äôt ready to fall out yet.

**nyoom** (10): there must be some kind of linguistic term for the phenomenon of hearing a word you've never heard before and knowing with no frame of reference and yet the utmost certainty that it means "to be drunk"

**rickikardashian** (10): i still havent decided if i unironically like this but it brings me enough joy to give it a 10

**rslashpoopheads** (10): stream Dev & The Cataracs - Bass Down Low

**runaway3212** (10): THE BEST SONG EVER

**seanderlust** (10): artist comment on genius: slizard = sexy lizard. I....I need a minute.

**skargardin** (10): If this isn't top three at the very least we riot

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song just ushered in the decade perfectly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i'm fucking slizzard i'm afraid

**thedoctordances1940** (10): What an absolute banger

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): the women around me are not drinking, but they are trying to convince observers that inebriated

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): wait no this is actually hyperpop

**jaztinax** (9): (holds up wine cooler) LET‚ÄôS PAaARTyyYyy!

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): huge bop

**outsideeyess** (9): dev deserved more but y'all let her flop. on the other hand, if this wins... just no

**jman457** (8.2): This baseline is so iconic. Justice for Dev

**FKJVMMP** (8): Everything about this is terrible. It‚Äôs one of the best club songs of this era. Idk.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): my opinion changes every time i hear it

**slimboyfriend** (8): DEV! We miss you!

**timothy444** (7.5): It's not exactly a complex masterpiece of a song but it still bangs.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , meh.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): they called it like a g6 for a reason y‚Äôall acting up giving this elevens

**GARjuna** (5): the first 10 seconds are great

**Hulnia** (5): Bladee gone wrong. ü•±

**fadedblue09** (4.5): overrated a bit

**jsonphile** (4): they don‚Äôt even use a G6 chord in the entire song talk about false advertising

**kirby31200** (4): This song isn't good but it is iconic

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1.5): I have always found this song extremely annoying

**CreepyMannequin** (1): why would I listen to this when I could instead listen to Dev's iconic track Booty Bounce

**TiltControls** (0): I want to apologize to Far East Movement for this score cause my issue is that I just really can't stand Dev's voice on anything (and it's a pretty important part of this song). I blame early '10s retail for that. Bass Down Low still haunts my nightmares sometimes

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): I would have never expect this to be our winner!! But I get it, it's got all the right ingredients and the perfect amount of them for a pop rap song. Those factors led to the song being as iconic as it is. The hook is a monster.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): and here we have our winner!! it isn't my favorite Flo Rida hit, but it has an interesting scrappiness in its production that felt less polished than his later stuff would come to be, and of course this song is obviously a classic at every single party. Its success kinda sparked the wave of pop rap in this vein, so it does make sense in a way for this to logically become the winner in a rate themed off a trend that it essentially spawned

---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): one of the best party songs ever. an absolute classic.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): an absolute banger

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): an easy 11 for me. fun fact i've had my itunes library since 2005 and this song is still in the top 20 after all these years. iconic, was at the forefront of songs ushering in the upbeat pop/rap songs, also one of my white australian dad's favourite songs

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song was extremely formative in my childhood and i dont think i'll be able to say exactly how for a good nother five years

**CrimsonROSET** (10): WITH DA FUR

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847428744061779968/860600139831836692/unknown.png

**endcreditouilles** (10): the line is "jeans full of guac" and I won't hear otherwise

**frogaranaman** (10): damn this misogyny never fails to go hard as fuck!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): If you don‚Äôt think this is iconic please go find a dance floor to experience the universal moment of getting low when t-pain says ‚Äúshawty got low low low low low low low low‚Äù

**ImADudeDuh** (10): apple bottom jeans, boots with the jeans (with the jeans), the whole club was looking at jeans, she hit the jeans, next thing you jeans, shorty got jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans

**jaztinax** (10): i have two distinct childhood memories of this song, one being the clip of the jonas brothers, selena gomez + more disney people dancing to this at some after party for the disney channel games and the second being my friends making a choreo to this in 7th grade. iconic song

**jman457** (10): Instantly brings me back to middle schoolers grinding on each other in a hot sweaty gym. And unlike a lot of songs on here its aged like fine wine.

**nootnoot781** (10): ‚ÄúFlo Rida, what were your points at Eurovision like?‚Äù

**nyoom** (10): SHAWTY HAD THEM APPLE BOTTOM JEANS, BOOTS WITH THE JEANS, THE WHOLE CLUB WAS LOOKING AT JEANS

**outsideeyess** (10): nostalgia

**plastichaxan** (10): Jessica outsold but this is fine i guess

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmvXCgZr74

**rickikardashian** (10): ‚Äúare you wearing the‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúthe boots with the fur? yeah i am‚Äù

**Roxieloxie** (10): can i just link the entire episode of we bare bears where the entire episode revolves around them trying to get to a Tpain concert for this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this isn‚Äôt early 10s pop rap but it is one of the biggest 2000s bangers

**skargardin** (10): its the smasha

**teenwitches** (10): an all time middle school dance banger

**waluigiest** (10): The chorus is quite legendary

**xavieryes** (10): classic

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this song is too iconic I almost gave it my 11 I‚Äôm gonna cry if this wins

**TiltControls** (9.5): This song gives me middle-school flashbacks (complimentary)

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): ewwww the cringey middle school memories I have to this song

**akanewasright** (9): Literally if you play this song at any party, in my experience, it will light the room on fire. Everyone fucking loses their mind to this

**awhile2** (9): theres a lot of iconic things about this song but perhaps the most iconic is the youtube music video quality

**hikkaru** (9): starting the rate off with one of the most iconic songs to ever be released iktr

**jsonphile** (9): I mean this song is iconic. If you‚Äôve never been at a party where they play this song and everyone gets low at the ‚Äúlow low low low‚Äù part, you haven‚Äôt truly experienced late 2000s culture (I say as someone who was in catholic middle school in the late 2000s, but hey this song still got heavy rotation at our dances)

**kirby31200** (9): Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans), boots with the jeans (with the jeans), got the whole club was looking at jeans, she hit the jeans (she hit the jeans), next thing you jeans (next thing you jeans), shawty got jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): this song had my high school homecoming DJ in a tight grip every year

**seanderlust** (9): it's the smasha!!! if you have been on a dance floor in the past 15 years you know this song. the descending "low" is iconic. if I could rework this song, i'd bring the synths more forward since they're lowkey doing some fun things but otherwise this is perfect

**steelstepladder** (9): I better see a boots with the fur meme or two or three during this reveal

**thedoctordances1940** (9): This is probably the song I remember more vividly than any other just due to how big it was at the time and it definitely deserved that

**cherryices** (8.8): The girl Flo Rida sings about in Low was wearing apple bottom jeans, boots with the fur, baggy sweatpants, AND reeboks with the straps all at the same time so we must conclude that she was, in fact, a centaur. In this essay I will

**catjoon** (8.5): absolute banger

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I wasn't a big fan of this song when it was big. I actually didn't care about it at all, but it has grown on me since. Pitch Perfect really got me into it.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Apple Bottom Jeans / Boots with the Jeans

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i think im getting over my middle school dance cringe association with this

**bigbigbee** (8): This song made me want to wear apple bottom jeans and boots with the fur. still does even though i'd look truly awful

**Leixander** (8): T-Pain invented music.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Inspired a generation

**FKJVMMP** (7): I know it‚Äôs iconic but I honestly don‚Äôt think this is one of T-Pain‚Äôs best hooks. I can‚Äôt hate him though.

**imasalesman** (7): I respect the impact of this song but it was never my fave

**musical\_pyn** (7): jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans

**simplyterific** (7): a classic hit, I used to remember hearing this on the radio as a kid and pretending I was dropping it low at a club

**timothy444** (7): I remember singing this at Christian Karaoke night back when I didn't know what porn was lmao

**runaway3212** (6.5): Look, it's iconic but I also think this song has aged, even though I loved it when this song came on in the club

**GARjuna** (6): a staple of every 2010s dance floor. I'll be honest this mostly gets a lower score b/c whoever is in the second verse

**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): All my friends were obsessed with this when we were kids and while I can understand why this song has never quite clicked for me. I enjoy it more now but a T-Pain hook is just not enough to save a song with shitty production and mediocre rapping.

**caseyfla** (5): Florida boys rise up! And make a bad song. :(

**cremeebrulee** (4): idk i will be excited for the first 30 seconds on this and then i‚Äôm ready to skip

bigbigbee: Thank you so much, jackisboredtoday and izeasklepaucius, for an amazing rate! An iconic winner, a great reveal, and most of all: an incredible premise (jackisboredtoday ‚Äì your mind with this one!!!). 

I think it‚Äôs great when we break away from the main pop girls to rate some parts of pop history that are maybe under-discussed in this subreddit, and this sound was so important and ubiquitous. Hoping we can do this rate‚Äôs counterpart (Men of 2010) sometime in the future!

TiltControls: **I LOVED THIS RATE!!!!** Thanks Jack and izeasklapaucius for hosting such an amazing rate! The average doesn't give an accurate representation to how fun it was!!


[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) like always!


##**Songs**

Wow what a great winner, it's such a good thing this was picked over all the other songs, especially those other ones that might've come close to the win!

**Low** (like the past few grabbag winners) comes in with a high 8 rating (and again, this is pretty normal for grabbags). It takes an overall rating in the top 500 highest averages at #478. Though it does take the spot as the 9th lowest winner so far (again, not too odd with a grabbag)

Low also becomes the 5th song to win on its 3rd appearance, following in the footsteps of We Belong Together, Dancing On My Own, Say My Name, and Damn Daniel

Random other stats!

* **Empire State of Mind** and **Party Rock Anthem** both make appearances on the most times rated board with 4 rates a piece

* **International Love** lands itself on the most 0's leaderboard, with 14. This ties it with stupid horse (All Stars 4) and Blurred Lines (Billboard 2010's Decade)

* **Sexy and I Know It** comes *just* short of making it to the most controversial songs list

* **Good Feeling** has the 2nd highest average jump between its two rates gaining 2.691 points, getting a measly 5.071 in the 2012 Billboard rate and bumping to a respectable 7.722 here. It sits right behind Blown Away (2.854) (which also had massive jumps from the 2012 Billboard rate)and right ahead of Party Rock Anthem (2.604) (which was improving on its score from the last rate it was in, the 2010s Billboard Decade end one). Overall though Party Rock Anthem has the highest jump between any rate, gaining 3.002 in this rate compared to (again) the 2012 Billboard rate

Other writer notes:

* The Show Goes On was robbed. This isn't a numerical fact, but I am stating it as one

##**Artists**

About 33 artists on the leaderboard were rated in this rate so we've got a lot of ground to cover. I'll only go over the highlights

We have some new artists with enough songs rated!

* **B.o.B.** (6.829 average, #225/264)

* **GoonRock** (6.628 average, #240/264)

* **Akon** (6.190 average, #253/264)

also today we say goodbye to some long standing records...

* The madmen finally did it: **LMFAO** has finally picked up a few 11's, taking it off the "no 11s" list after it was basically the only artist on the list for a while.  Now the only one there is Master P, which doesn't really count much considering they were all interludes. If you really want to know the lowest 11's now it's a 5 way tie between Chris Brown, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, Akon, and Elton John with each having a single 11.

* On the other side, **Usher** and **Ludacris** have both lost their place on the "no 0s" list (for the same song too!). **Alicia Keys** also loses her spot on the list too for picking up a 0 on ESOM

other minor random stuff

* **Flo Rida** is now our lowest rated artist who has won a rate (with a 6.747 average, taking the record from Katy Perry)

* **Alicia** drops on the overall highest artist average board from 10th to 15th

* A lot of changes on the lowest average side of the leaderboard, but in summary for the bottom 10 **Pitbull** out and **Bieber** in

* Also some changes on the highest controversy side with **Pitbull** and **Wiz Khalifa** falling off the top 10 and **GoonRock** and **will.i.am.** making appearances instead

* **Gaga** is back on the leaderboard for most rates participated in with 15, **Britney** moves to a tie for 6th with 16, and **Nicki**, **Rihanna** and **Taylor** all move into a tie for 1st with 17 each (tied with Beyonc√© and Charli XCX)

* **Nicki Minaj** is now in the top 25 for most songs rated (at 43, tied with Marina), **Britney** also moves to a solo 3rd (was tied with Lana before), and Rihanna moves to a tied 8th with Katy (was a tied 9th with Kylie before)

* **Britney** moves up the most 0's list from 10th to 8th

* Also some last place loser now becomes the only artist to hold a sub-5 average rating


##**Rates**

This rate takes the 6th lowest average, just slightly higher than 4th lowest by 0.005 points (One Hit Wonderland) and 5th lowest by 0.003 points (Teenage Dream/Fame Monster/Animal + Cannibal)

It also takes the 9th highest rate controversy, placing it just a bit higher than the Redemption rate!

Pop Rap also becomes the rate with the 4th highest percentage of people that used their 0 (at 82.8%) the current leader is (still and maybe forever always) the 2012 Billboard rate around 90% (though with the TikTok rate around the corner who knows if that will hold?)

Though in lighter news, it also takes the spot for getting the 10th highest percent of people to use their 11's! (at 97.85%). Definitely building adding to the love/hate people have with some of these songs.

TiltControls: Like the amount of songs to get a 11 and 0? 

If so, 53.13% of songs got an 11 (34 songs) and 35.94% got a 0 (23 songs). Which would rank it 45th and 35th highest in those two categories. Honestly I thought it'd be higher (especially the 0's), but I guess they were mostly piled onto day 1 songs
