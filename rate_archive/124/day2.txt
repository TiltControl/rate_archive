(2 x5) CrimsonROSET, ElizabethDDoS, ImADudeDuh, steelstepladder, timothy444

(1 x4) CreepyMannequin, rickikardashian, simplyterific, TheQueenOfVultures

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): Our first exit of Day 2 removes an old-school Flo Rida hit, and while I have to admire the audacity of this sample, its not exactly that good and tbh this could've been day 1 without any tears shed

**izeasklapaucius** (5): Idk I feel like the Blue sample is way too awkward in this. Compa

# Sickeningly Sweet

**1998tweety** (10): CLASSIC, so damn catchy. the sample on this is amazing

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): stay healthy and lower your sugar intake

**outsideeyess** (10): this hook is so iconic and repurposed really well. the production holds up so well still

**rslashpoopheads** (10): amazing, iconic, never been done before, one of the 7 songs in this rate that I have downloaded, Wynter Gordon should've been a main pop girl

**awhile2** (9): eifel 65 who?

**FKJVMMP** (9): Europop by Eiffel 65 was the second album I ever bought because I’m old as fuck and I strongly support anybody embracing that cheesy nonsense.

**nyoom** (9): could i maybe get this with one half of the flo and a third of the rida? thaaaanks, i'm on a \~diet\~

**xavieryes** (9): Flo Rida loves his cheesy use of samples/interpolation but somehow it always works

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i have bad taste and all my friends hate me so i feel like i should like the nonsensical and terrible blue sample but i hate it. rest of the song is fire tho fr

**akanewasright** (8): Bang Bang by Rita Ora is one of my top songs of 2021 this is probably gonna grow on me in an ugly way

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , oops, wrong song, nevermind, it's better.

**GARjuna** (8): making some points but BLUE?????

**hikkaru** (8): mopped maroon 5

**imasalesman** (8): The sample works really well here imo

**seanderlust** (8): all 42 teeth? humans have 32 teeth. flo...who or what are you singing to?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): whenever i hear this song i think of my friend singing "my lipe sugar" by mistake

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): The blue sample is certainly a choice

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): I’m a Wynter/Diana stan but this is just OK. Why is it sampling Blue by Eiffel 65 but talking about sugar? Is it an ode to the fake raspberry flavour?

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I do love me some sugar.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): King of sampling dance hits

**endcreditouilles** (7.2): this sounds like a Simlish version of Blue (Da Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65

**celladonn** (7): There are a lot of stupid interpolations in this rate but somehow this Blue interpolation feels like the stupidest of all

**TiltControls** (7): the blue sample... actually kind of works here? It really shouldn't but does

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): i both love and hate all the “da boo di da boo da”’s

**astrologicalangel** (6): ah, a weird and totally misplaced sample, this truly represents the mid 2010s

**frogaranaman** (6): the fact that Flo Rida is actually a pretty good rapper sends me for some reason

**jaztinax** (6): i never really liked this song but it still kinda slaps

**moonagenightmares** (6): the dabadeedabadi part unironically saves the song

# Food Poisoning

**static\_int\_husp** (6): here's another wierd-ass interpolation. Taking the chorus to Blue (Da Ba Dee) to make a generic melody for a chorus? We made some weird decisions in the 2000s

**thedoctordances1940** (6): It's not bad but nothing sampling I'm Blue is really gonna be any good

**bulforster** (5.5): The flow he always uses doesn't really work for a mellower song like this.

**jsonphile** (5.5): now why would you sample I’m blue

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5.5): YO, LISTEN UP HERE'S A STORY

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): This sounds like an alternate universe take of Right Round

**catjoon** (5): the verses are really good but the chorus with the singing is absolutely grating to my ears

**kirby31200** (4): This sounds like when kids movies need cheap pop songs to play in the background

**waluigiest** (4): most songs that interpolate blue make me mad

**runaway3212** (3.5): the sample is lazy and doesnt add a ton, plus like the whole song feels like it was made in three minutes there is so much repetition and none of the lines hit at all

**jman457** (3.3): The Blue-dabu-dee sample was funny for about 30 secs than this song just got really irritating

**caseyfla** (3): I know what let's do! Let's sample a song that was really annoying on its own and then add more annoyingness!!!!

**musical\_pyn** (3): the blue sample sends me literally every time I hear it

**plastichaxan** (3): look how they massacred my baby (and by my baby i mean "Blue (Da Ba Dee)")

**CrimsonROSET** (2): LET IT FUCKING DIE WHY DO WE KEEP BRINGING BACK I’M BLUE

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): Aspartame

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this is camp but also bad

**steelstepladder** (2): Seeing the songs that this was higher than on the year end... lol

**timothy444** (2): What a wasted use of a sample

**rickikardashian** (1): out of all the songs to interpolate...

**simplyterific** (1): god this song sucks, usually the featuring female artists on Flo rida songs save it but she managed to make it worse (also why the fuck would anyone sample “blue” I hate this)

**jackisboredtoday** (5.4): somehow maybe the most distilled essence of Pitbull out of all of his hits and yet still on the weaker end of his discography

**cremeebrulee** (10): “y’all having a good time out there?” no not rly but thanks for asking i guess

**endcreditouilles** (10): me singing the chorus to myself as i sit alone in my apartment

**teenwitches** (9): so many sports teams use or have used this one to celebrate scoring goals/touchdowns/home runs/etc.

**timothy444** (9): Found the chorus annoying in 2014 but in 2021 it's the best part of the song. Dalé

**FKJVMMP** (8): The “Finland” ad lib is the best thing Pitbull ever did.

**plastichaxan** (8): as a latine this is a party classic i have to stan

**Roxieloxie** (8): I dont even know the actual version of this song that well but The absolute camp of the 2013 Kids Choice Awards having Josh Dumel do the opening number being a full a cover of this song is just too much of a memory that lives rent free in my head

**skargardin** (8): WAIT THIS IS SUCH A THROWBACK

**nyoom** (6): we're just not gonna talk about how pitbull is always dressed like a racist dad? #exilepitbull

**runaway3212** (6): god this isnt good but it is also so good

**static\_int\_husp** (6): beer comerical music

**bigbigbee** (5.5): What did pitbull look like as a child? it's hard to get answers because if you search "pit bull young" you get a lot of pictures of puppies

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This one can easily stop a party.

**simplyterific** (4): I want this party to end

**thedoctordances1940** (4): I'm just grateful it's not AJR

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): I would make a joke about J. Cole's reputation for "real rap" as he goes out here, but Cole himself apparently wouldn't regard this as such given the way he has another entire song that basically was an apology for being to pop-oriented on this track.

# damn they don't make em like this anymore

**IIIHenryIII** (11): J. Cole is so underappreciated. He's literally one of the best rappers alongside Kendrick. He really is at the top. He's just released a new album. Y'all should check it out. Now's time to talk about the song: perfect! In a perfect world, this would be the winner.

**frogaranaman** (10): J. Cole was so much better as a musician when he was misogynistic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is mostly just Paula Abdul - Straight Up and that’s a very good thing.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): can j. cole go back to making fun music please i'm begging

**steelstepladder** (9.4): I forgot how good J-Cole used to be. This and Power Trip were on REPEAT for me

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): The Paula Abdul sample really elevates the song

**skargardin** (9): the paula abdul sample HELLO?? I'm surprised that I have never heard this before honestly

**rickikardashian** (8.5): my score is solely for the vocoder

**simplyterific** (8.5): this song never gets old

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh so now we have a problem with stealing someone’s girl ain’t you a gentlemen mr. cole

**ignitethephoenix** (8): J Cole giving Paula Abdul her bag during the bridge love to see it

**jsonphile** (8): I always forget about this song considering how far J Cole’s gone since then. But it’s a pretty fun song and I like the Paula Abdul sample

**runaway3212** (8): Good but kanye's version is so much better

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): paula's impact

**jman457** (7.6): Its cute but I never really saw what Jcole stans see in him

**TiltControls** (7.5): my love for this song is mostly just with the sample pt.2

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , i don't want to.

**Awkward\_King** (7): did he just.. did he just sample paula abdul

**nootnoot781** (7): j cole interpolating paula abdul is sending me

**seanderlust** (6.5): I like the sample a lot more than the verses

# Let popheads down

**1998tweety** (6): paula deserves better

**FKJVMMP** (6): I don’t remember this at all and if J Cole’s face wasn’t staring at me on Spotify I still wouldn’t believe it was him.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): eh just not the most interesting

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Wait, this is the guy who picked a fight with noname?........ that's embarrassing lol

**akanewasright** (5): The random Paula Abdul interpolation throws me the fuck off

**rslashpoopheads** (5): never really understood the appeal of J Cole

**letsallpoo** (4): paul abdul sweetie

**CreepyMannequin** (3): Why would I listen to this instead of The New Workout Plan

**fadedblue09** (3): Sorry this was boring

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): damn j cole has come a long way

**moonagenightmares** (2): extremely boring also who even is this dude

**nyoom** (2): being boring is worse than being bad (2)

**timothy444** (1): wow this sucks

**xavieryes** (1): I don't like J. Cole

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Fun fact: Wale is one of the very few acts to ever get a featuring from Gaga. The other 4 were Beyonce, The Lonely Island, NKOTB, and Chic. Anyways, I still think this is a fun song and Wale carried his verses with ease. Back then I only cared about Gaga parts (obviously bc I was a Little Monster) but over the time I started to appreciate the samples, the M.I.A. shoutout, and the overall vibe to this track.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): Lady Gaga finally exits early on day 2! I actually like both artists on this quite a bit, but this isn't the best showing from either one, and despite some fun lines from Wale (the Jeremy Shockey line sticks in my brain) he and gaga feel sorta mismatched. I do miss when she was willing to do more collabs as the featured artist though.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is lady gaga's best song

**Hulnia** (10): I never expected to have an 11 contender that wasn’t JAY-Z, but here we are. It’s not even carried by Lady Gaga.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): gaga collab w obscure rappers again challenge

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I think this song is just alright, but Wale means so much to kids from DC from 2008-2012 because we finally had a mainstream rapper

**seanderlust** (8.7): shopping! clubbing! nightlife! hanging out!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this was fun!! Make Her Say remains the superior Gaga hip hop collab of the era

**jman457** (8.4): A fun song, I would have loved if gaga made a full song like this with more santigold or Sleigh Bells sounds

**akanewasright** (8): This song is camp

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , this feels like a joke tune that actually works!

**Leixander** (8): gaga walking to the music video purse first, BAM

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I'm being very generous to this one because of Gaga. She's the only good thing in the song. She literally prevents this song from being awful.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): lady gaga’s best song

**RandomHypnotica** (7): how did i never know this was Gaga???

**runaway3212** (7): Not terrible but if gaga wasn't here it wouldnt be in this rate

**1998tweety** (6.5): this launched her career

**nyoom** (6.5): kinda walmart M.I.A. beat

**plastichaxan** (6.5): gaga’s hook actually making this rating lower i can’t believe it

**simplyterific** (6.5): why did gaga have that purse in her hand for the WHOLE video I’m crying

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): I'm not sure, but I think this guy's name is Wale

**celladonn** (6): This really sounds like M.I.A should be the feature instead of Gaga

**GARjuna** (6): what is gaga's verse???

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): lady gaga wants to be kristinia debarge so bad

**rickikardashian** (6): remember when this was one of gaga’s biggest songs?

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Wale is the reason I learned about the countries in the UK so thanks for that Wale!

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I'm so frustrated because the actual song isn't good, but Gaga's hook is a 10

**CrimsonROSET** (5): sorry when are you gonna start making me love it

**FKJVMMP** (5): Damn, Wale ran out of lyrics fifteen seconds into his verse. Rough.

**frogaranaman** (5): why is Lady Gaga on this track

**jaztinax** (5): i was not expecting miss gaga to be in this

**outsideeyess** (5): deducted a point for every person gaga would mercilessly kill to have us forget this exists

**jasannn** (4): Just because a song features Gaga doesn't mean it's good

**jsonphile** (4): well I like lady Gaga. Actually I don’t even like her part in this track either

**musical\_pyn** (4): I reallllly don't like the hook but wale's part is pretty good

**timothy444** (1): this only proves that anyone can make crappy music

**endcreditouilles** (10): Rose's final words on the titanic SO SAD i cry everytime

**frogaranaman** (10): this shouldn’t work but it does

**moonagenightmares** (10): my fatal flaw is liking this song

**Roxieloxie** (10): i like i like i like i like everything about you i like i like i like everything about you

**runaway3212** (10): this beats Turn Down For What as best 2010s pop drop

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop

**1998tweety** (9): I love Dope by BTS!

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): This sounds like a song Lil Nas X would do

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Kidz Bop - Your girl just danced the twirl, I do high kicks

**timothy444** (9): Dang I didn't even catch that double entendre until today lmao

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this sounds like a monsta x song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this has movie trailer energy. you can tell this is from a different pop rap era because it has the same distorted sax every hit from 2014-2015 had

**emayzee** (8.3): bi community ally

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): idk if I've heard this before or if I'm just mixing it up with one of those many other songs with these type of horns

**Awkward\_King** (8): the men on this sound hotter than i remember. like the song is a 4 and the drop is a 1 but their voices are deep

**bigbigbee** (8): This sounds like a Monsta X song

**seanderlust** (8): kinda love the instrumental here. good vibes throughout the track

**skargardin** (8): WAIT IT'S THIS SONG OMG

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Flo Rida honestly makes movie sountrack music, that's the best way to explain it

**outsideeyess** (7.7): Does anyone think fetishizing bisexual women is a good thing? I love Sage the Gemini. I think he's a really interesting artist.

**jaztinax** (7.5): lowkey a guilty pleasure because i can’t really find a redeemable quality about this lol

**jasannn** (6.5): This is the same drop as BTS's Dope.

**TiltControls** (6.5): my scores when i see chris brown on a song

**FKJVMMP** (6): I’d give Talk Dirty a 7 so this obviously has to be a 6. Can’t believe Sage The Gemini was ever a person that had a music career.

**jsonphile** (6): I do like the hook but Flo Rida’s rapping is even worse than usual. But damn that sax riff sample is fantastic

**waluigiest** (6): this is just Harlem Shake right?

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): The beat is sick, but it never clicked to me.

**steelstepladder** (5): Talk Dirty To Me was weirdly influential for about two years or so

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): its ok

**thedoctordances1940** (5): The real problem with this song is that I could far too easily mistake it for Jason Derulo.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): This is the song equivalent of a golden retriever, its so stupid (Flo Rida's singing range is like... 3 notes) but its so eager to please and just pure fun that I can't help but sorta love it anyway. Open up the champagne, POP!!!!

# Quarantine anthem

**akanewasright** (10): This song slaps but I do really love that the writer literally just hated going out and wrote about that

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is a vampire’s favorite song

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont remember summer 2016 being pretty fun, that was one of the first summers I got sent to this music program/somewhat camp. I remember not enjoying it a whole lot since it basically took up my entire day. All this to say at the end of the summer we had some recital/performance thing going on and by this point we we're just all so exhausted. They went through great lengths to separate us by section but all of us just wanted to talk to each other so you had this hallway where each section were in these adjacent classrooms and we somehow decided the best way to communicate to each other was to yell the chorus of my house back and for to each other in this call and response type thing, basically what im saying is,this is the absolute greatest song in recorded history

**celladonn** (8.5): "Sometimes you gotta stay in" Quarantine anthem

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): The chorus makes me cringe a lot, but the beat and the pre-chorus melody make up for it.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): "tell me where you been" we love a covid concious party host

**1998tweety** (8): I feel like I have never heard these verses but that's fine cause the chorus is an 11

**bigbigbee** (8): This was popular when I was a junior....? in college and I think that's why I like it. It's very frat party (but like the song you're excited about hearing at a frat party).

**runaway3212** (8): "sometimes you gotta stay in" this is a quarantine anthem

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Flo Rida juts has a knack for finding brilliant melodies

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrNx_VXmkyI

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.5): I remember this being the song on a Spotify free ad for like a solid 6 months back in 2016 ew

**outsideeyess** (7.3): my high school crush loved this song, so I learned to appreciate it

**catjoon** (7): cute little song

**frogaranaman** (7): I always try to do this then end up failing and going to the bars to blackout anyways

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is one of those songs where you lift you arm and do the little arm bop wave to the beat

**TiltControls** (7): Flo Rida probably makes amazing buildings in the Sims

**timothy444** (7): I love how slow this song is and yet it's still a banger you can dance to.

**hikkaru** (6.5): when the world needed him most, he vanished

**CrimsonROSET** (6): god bless tiktok houses weren’t a thing in 2014

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Where Adele is from.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): kind of messy

**nyoom** (6): imagine having your own house

# go out, touch grass

**jaztinax** (5.5): this song reminds me of something or someone i dislike but i can’t point my finger at what or who... i just have bad vibes from this song

**jman457** (5.5): By this time I was getting really tired of the Flo Rida sound but it is still a fun song if your drunk with friends

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): didn’t really care for the song, but he sounds really nice here

**fadedblue09** (5): Kinda a slump, sorry king

**FKJVMMP** (5): House parties? The fuck? Not in my Flo Rida song thank you very much.

**skargardin** (5): Never really cared for this

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5): his singing is so funny

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): wouldn't go out of my hear to hear it but wouldn't skip it if it came on

**GARjuna** (4): visceral YEET reaction

**slimboyfriend** (4): he's not even rapping!!

**teenwitches** (4): walmart commercial core

**steelstepladder** (3): This song is sooooooooo sloooooooooow

**simplyterific** (2.8): well its a song

**bulforster** (2): That bass synth really kills the mood and makes it sound so sombre.

**rslashpoopheads** (1.5): 2PM outsold

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): It's like fraxiom but straight.

**jackisboredtoday** (5): Lil Jon carried this song so hard. Its still kinda bad but his energy is infectious and makes this so much more fun and tolerable than it had to be

---

**akanewasright** (10): I am the little old lady in this video..and it was a lot of fun to make...FYI the guys were great and perfect gentlemen to this little old lady...

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I am the little old lady in this video..and it was a lot of fun to make...FYI the guys were great and perfect gentlemen to this little old lady...

**endcreditouilles** (10): the first time I ever blacked out was when someone suggested we play a drinking game where we listened to this song and took a shot everytime they said "SHOTS!". Just so you don't have to count, they say shots 77 times in the song. We didn't even make it past the first chorus asjkdasjkl

**frogaranaman** (10): “where my alcoholics?” sir they don’t need your permission to take shots

**Hulnia** (10): Definitely their best song, but honestly somebody just needs to give them an 11 on something.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): IF YOU ARE NOT DRUNK LADIES AND GENTLEMAN GET READY TO GET FUCKED UP

**runaway3212** (10): god im gonna get fucked up tonight

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): it could be just Lil Jon screaming SHOTS on a loop and still be a banger

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ugh i want to go clubbing but australia has fucked up the vaccination roll out so i cannot

**TChalla1966** (10): this song is just so amazing Idc

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): lil jon absolutely makes this track

**TiltControls** (9.5): SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS

**cremeebrulee** (9): I am the little old lady in this video..and it was a lot of fun to make...FYI the guys were great and perfect gentlemen to this little old lady...

**GARjuna** (9): saved by lil jon. Lil jon's verse on its own is an 11

**Leixander** (9): YEAAA-H

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): a song still referenced in my day to day life like very often tbh

**nyoom** (9): me: WHERE MY ALCOHOLICS LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS UP / the AA meeting: *peloton*

**outsideeyess** (8.8): a perfectly applied guest feature

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): I think these guys might want some shots

**seanderlust** (8.5): I am the little old lady in this video..and it was a lot of fun to make...FYI the guys were great and perfect gentlemen to this little old lady...

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Thank god lil jon descended from above to save this song from damnation

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if you were on youtube before 2014 you are not allowed to give this a score lower than 7 i’m sorry i don’t make the rules

**ImADudeDuh** (8): alcoholic anthem

**kirby31200** (8): Would be an 11 if LMFAO didn't bring it down. Lil Jon is the greatest artist of this rate

**plastichaxan** (8): “all the alcoholics” okay fine my hands are up

**skargardin** (8): Solid party bop and it still holds up!

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I blasted this on the bus on my way to get the covid vaccine

**teenwitches** (8): the lil jon feature reminds me we should do a 2000s crunk rate

**waluigiest** (8): LMFAO shined so bright and burned out quickly, but their light lives on in the chorus of Shots

**jman457** (7.6): with Lil John on here how can it not slap

**bulforster** (7.5): Finally, some positive representation for alcoholics.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): This isn't really a song as much as a lifestyle

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): :multiflushed:

**rickikardashian** (6.5): cocks

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , mehhh.

**FKJVMMP** (6): Would have been my 11 if the whole song was three minutes of Lil Jon’s intro.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): would probs be fun in a club but is just annoying otherwise lmao

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Lil Jon is just a little too aggressive for me

**timothy444** (6): I drink to this

**simplyterific** (5.5): this song is just a tad bit too aggressive for me :/ I love lil jon but I don’t want to hear him yell “buttery nipples”

**1998tweety** (5): no

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): this song is more annoying than it is fun im sorry yall

**nootnoot781** (1): i cannot do this today :)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): omg this song infected my ear piercings and blew out my eardrums

**IIIHenryIII** (0): I forgot this song existed, probably for the better. This song progressively gets worse.

**rslashpoopheads** (0): This song is what started the antivaxxer movement.

# on fire

**Awkward\_King** (11): DOO DOO DO DO DO DO DOO DO DO DO DO DO FIREBALL

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Its one of the most fun songs in the whole rate.

**endcreditouilles** (10): bartender: "what can I get you to drink?" / bitches with beach themed bathrooms:

**TiltControls** (10): spicy

**waluigiest** (10): it’s really messy and I like that

**xavieryes** (10): 🔥

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): One word: fireball!

**akanewasright** (9): There was a group project freshman year of high school where someone rewrote these lyrics to be about the catholic reformation and I will always have affection for the song because of that

**jaztinax** (9): this makes me want to drink fireball

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): my aunt loved this song so i feel compelled to give it a high score. also FIREBALL DO DO DODODODODO

**CrimsonROSET** (8): how can i get mad at this like what is there to hate

**GARjuna** (8): LEGENDARY but this feature is ass

**jman457** (8): This is just pure getting drunk in a foreign country that has a history of a dictatorship because of useless US intervention

**Roxieloxie** (8): you know what they both are doing a different assignments but like i can sway to this wii fit 'flamenco' dance type beat enough that i dont mind it

**skargardin** (8): the "or should i say i saw, i conquered, i caaaame" line takes me out JSFGJS

**steelstepladder** (8): White girls, it's time to stand for your national anthem

**seanderlust** (7.9): this is so close to technically being a limerick

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the singer here sounds like Adam Levine if his voice wasn’t a mess

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7.5): "Veni Vici Vidi" - Caesar Pitbull

**fadedblue09** (7): has some fun moments

**runaway3212** (7): this slaps, I hate it

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): I didn't know this was a pitbull song, i thought it was just a commerical jingle

**1998tweety** (6): shes ok

**frogaranaman** (6): one time when I was visiting colleges to decide where I wanted to attend, I was being taken out to bars by my friends and one of their drunk college friends handed me a drink and said “chug this” and it was fireball so I did and then I was like “what the fuck was that dude” and he said “it’s what makes me a MAN, what helped me grow out my chest hair” and then told me to touch his chest. in retrospect, I think he was hitting on me, but I was so thrown off by the entire exchange that I just kind of stood there like “what the hell”

**musical\_pyn** (6): my favorite mid-tier pitbull song

**timothy444** (6): Honestly, it's ruined by all those C-grade animated kids movies using this exact song in their trailers. It's forever associated as the rap version of "Can't Stop the Feeling"

# taking it taking it we taking it down

**nyoom** (5): i would've rated this higher if they did the BABY BABY BABY BABY part again, and also if this guy john ryan weren't on it. don't you have to go save your privates or something

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): i’m sorry Mr. Worldwide this isn’t as good as i remember

**Leixander** (4): that veni vidi vici pun was atrocious

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): nine Pitbull songs into this and I don’t wanna hear the words “Mr Worldwide” ever again

**moonagenightmares** (3.5): this bores me

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): Yeah this is just annoying

**simplyterific** (3): that weird “fireball” kills the whole song

**catjoon** (2): ok…

**FKJVMMP** (1): Boogie oogie oogie, jiggle wiggle and dance. Maybe Flo Rida is one of the greatest poets of our time after all if this is his competition.

# i... well you lived up the URL

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): While this song isn't the biggest hit single in the rate, lasted a little longer than I expected for how known it is, and in retrospect that makes some sense. While this one isn't anything super deep and meaningful (what here is) there are some great synths and a clever enough conceit to make for something more instantly appealing than a lot of stuff here

**izeasklapaucius** (6): Somehow this song was under my radar until now. This isn't even available on my country's Spotify so I had to go to YT to listen to it lmao.

---

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , so schizophrenia?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the song is fine, the synths committed hate crimes.

**waluigiest** (8): if Bottoms Up was in this rate it would have received a record breaking number of 11s

**akanewasright** (7.7): Lupe hates this song but like… idk it’s a cute little bop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Hmmm, good i think

**runaway3212** (7): not as great as the show goes on but still pretty good

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): I have to take off for the featured artist and who he is unfortunately

**frogaranaman** (6): it’s just a touch banger

**ImADudeDuh** (6): jason derulo’s song >>>

**musical\_pyn** (6): the production on this stands out from a lot of these other songs which is a plus! Too bad the rest of the song is kinda meh

**timothy444** (6): I have no strong feelings on this, one way or another.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): its ok but the only memorable thing is trey's vocals

**nyoom** (4): https://bit.ly/36vliyl

**rslashpoopheads** (4): this song went right out of my head

**jman457** (3.8): I forgot about this song while I was listening to it,which sucks because I actually like these two artists on their own

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I wish I could get this song out of my brain.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song brings out the whore in me

**jaztinax** (10): WHY IS THIS SO GOOD

**moonagenightmares** (10): i cant believe i still love this as much as i did a decade ago, an 11 contender

**rslashpoopheads** (10): the better T-Pain hook

**teenwitches** (10): the tpain hook on this is immaculate

**xavieryes** (10): This is one of the 2010s hits I just kinda had forgotten about and just... holy shit this song is perfect.

**GARjuna** (9.9): mr T-Pain making some points

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this rate has told me that T-Pain does not miss. Fuck Usher!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): almost unhinged with how much it bops, they both understood the assignment

**endcreditouilles** (9): two things that will never change 1) I will never not drop ass to this and 2) pitbull's haircut

**1998tweety** (8.5): big bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): bop

**plastichaxan** (8.5): t-pain's hooks are too good

**steelstepladder** (8.5): The good version of Back In Time

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): i want to go party now

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this is dark pop

**jman457** (8.4): Usher can suck a dick because T-pain is the avant-garde pop artist we all need. Like that auto-tone mice i got for xmas, a cultural reset. I can physically feel like i'm turning into a vagina listening to this song

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): this is just sexy bitch??

**catjoon** (7.4): t-pain ate him up I’m sawrry

**FKJVMMP** (7): Would be a 2 with literally anybody other than T-Pain.

**frogaranaman** (7): T-Pain kinda scratches an itch in my brain with this one

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): T-Pain ruins it.

**runaway3212** (6.5): im struggling with rating these pitbull songs because they're so terrible but I love them so much

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): it’s okay i guess

**musical\_pyn** (6): so far this is the song that has made me go "OH MY GOD THIS SONG EXISTS" the most

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Why is pitbull mixed so quietly for the verses?

**jsonphile** (5.5): unsurprisingly T-Pain is the best part of this song, but he’s got better songs

**nyoom** (5): somebody on youtube once said "if dog shit had a voice it would sound like pitbull" and i think about that every time this chorus plays. also i don't like the way t-pain overenunciates "floor" and "more"

**timothy444** (4.5): Production has aged a bit, mehh and Pitbull creepily singing "oooh babey babey" gives me the creeps vibe

**simplyterific** (4.3): this might be the worst t-pain song I’ve ever heard :/

**Awkward\_King** (4): this song feels like an auto generator listened to the other 63 songs and spat one last one back out

**caseyfla** (4): Florida boys rise up! And make another bad song. :(

**nootnoot781** (4): t-pain is the only good part of this song uh

**CrimsonROSET** (3): ok i’ve defended pitbull too much but i have a limit

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): a bop! what can I say? only so much to say here that the comments don't already say better but setting aside the comments about billionaires being awful and other jokes, this is fun!! It being out only halfway into the rate surprises me

**izeasklapaucius** (5): I just know Grimes secretly listened to this back in her communist era.

---

# Grimes Now

**endcreditouilles** (10): WHAT UP OPRAH AH-HA!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): am i going crazy or did he literally describe communism at some point of this song?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this was the first song i remember my parents listen to with the swearing because it just makes the song

**TChalla1966** (10): hasn’t Bruno done most of the things he says in this song except be a billionaire

**TiltControls** (10): fuck billionaires but this song is a bop

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): I can’t unhear this but Travie McCoy’s voice reminded me of Rex the puppet from Victorious

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): the clean version of this is actually kinda better but I dont hate it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , without this song, I would've not give a shit at him, like at all.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Me too, Bruno...

**jasannn** (9): Hearing "fucking" instead of the "freaking" still feels naughty to me.

**jaztinax** (9): unfortunately bruno mars will likely never get to smile next to oprah and the queen

**runaway3212** (9): Bruno applying for the job of dinner

**teenwitches** (9): although it's not possible to become a billionaire without being massively corrupt and exploiting the working class, this is still a bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): BOP

**celladonn** (8): Eat the rich

**cherryices** (8): bruno mars is the secret star of this rate

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is my guiltiest fucking pleasure please dont ask me to justify this

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): unfortunately this is one of those songs that I cannot listen to without thinking of Glee and the way NO ONE in the entire cast could rap for shit. Good song though!

**rickikardashian** (8): grimes heard this song and something woke up inside of her

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): CEO, Entrepreneur, born in 1964, Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos

**jsonphile** (7.5): something something eat the rich

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): Grimes after editing "anti-imperialist" from her Twitter bio

**seanderlust** (7.5): okay but travie after doing that you'd still have like...980 million. I don't think you've thought through exactly how much a billion is

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): elon musk tease

**jman457** (7.1): When Rina sees Bruno and Travis it's on SIGHT!

**akanewasright** (7): I do remember the chorus being more cathartic than it actually is. But I know every word and that doesn’t happen through chance

**frogaranaman** (7): the first time I heard Bruno say “so fucking bad” I almost had a heart attack I thought he legit just wanted to say “freaking” in a song

**simplyterific** (7): one of the best odes to capitalism

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): remember this era when everything bruno mars touched became a hit

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I'm not gonna lie I thought Travis Scott was Travie McCoy until like 2020

**awhile2** (6): cupids chokehold is the goat gym class heroes song and its a crime yall didnt include it in this rate

**Awkward\_King** (6): one of the less offensive of the bruno songs in this rate

# Grimes before she met Elon

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Eat the rich.

**kirby31200** (6): Eat the fucking rich, Bruno

**plastichaxan** (6): yeah you ain't special

**timothy444** (6): Did Bruno really need to say the f-word though? Feels like it retracts from the song quite a bit as a last-ditch effort to sound "cool".

**SFbby** (5): I once lost a point on an AP Econ test because the test quoted the song and asked what the song title was and I had absolutely no idea because I'd never heard the song before but apparently everyone else had and I'm still salty about it.

**slimboyfriend** (5): omg I didn't know the actual lyric was fucking instead of freaking :o

**cremeebrulee** (4): put me under the eat the rich header

**GARjuna** (4): THIS WAS BY HIM?????? WHAT?????? Haunted By My Youth!!!!!

**hikkaru** (4): i just want to be able to comfortably afford rent

**steelstepladder** (4): Not the worst fake reggae beat of the decade but that's kinda like being the nicest guy in prison

**waluigiest** (4): this aged poorly once we realized how big a billion was

**DaHumanTorch** (3): i've always despised this song. one of the rare times the glee version unironically is better

**nyoom** (3): where are all the people who used to put coke cans in their ears now? how're they doing? anyway this is boring and that's worse than being bad

**xavieryes** (2): used to love this, then i got sick of it and it just remained that way, this song is so fucking boring

**nootnoot781** (1): “this song is fucking cringe” - karl marx, i think

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): Eat the rich

**jackisboredtoday** (8.9): the second B.o.B song which probably would've done a little better if this rate were on /hhh, this one doesn't have a great hook and that probably killed it, but both B.o.B and Nicki (especially NickI) are spitting on this. Hardest song in the rate, even if not quite the best

---

**CreepyMannequin** (11): Well, this slaps. Nicki’s verse is one of her best, from the golden age of her guest verses. B.o.B. also kills this, especially with the reference to Being John Malkovich.

**cremeebrulee** (10): now why did she eat hayley up like that

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this nicki verse is SO good i still gag over the airplanes part. she elevates this song from a 7-8 ish to a 10 for sure

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is the better nicki verse in the rate (and also B.o.B.'s second verse is incredible)

**rickikardashian** (10): i gotta run to find a bob wig each time i hear nicki’s verse

**seanderlust** (10): a great song and one of two songs in this rate to contain a truly unhinged Nicki feature. Both artists truly bring it on this banger

**TChalla1966** (10): Nicki ate him up tbh

**waluigiest** (10): WHATCHA NAME B.O.B. SO THEY CALLING YOU BOB?

**xavieryes** (10): both suck as people but the song is a banger what can i do

**outsideeyess** (9.5): trivializes mental illness but this goes hard ://// that outro is amazing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Nicki really elevated this, I gasped when she came on, her verse is an 11. B.o.B also showed off his skill here, and the beat makes me go, well, out of my mind

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Hyperrap

**endcreditouilles** (9.4): omg i love the joker & harley quinn's relationship

**awhile2** (9): iconic nicki verse

**bigbigbee** (9): OH WOW this is a massive breath of fresh air after everything that came before it, and not just because of Nicki's excellent verse - this is catchy, fun, and BoB's parts are also hitting harder for me than anything that came before this.

**catjoon** (9): her verse is a god sent

**celladonn** (9): Can't say he didn't warn us

**moooo566** (9): sampling your own song is cool as hell

**1998tweety** (8.5): nicki carries

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this song is 2012 in the best way

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , heh

**Leixander** (8): this is just hilarious at this point (and nicki's airplanes line is awesome)

**nootnoot781** (8): is this hyperpop?

**nyoom** (8): wait if i'm here, and you're there, and i'm there, and you're here, THEN WHO'S DRIVING THE BUS

**simplyterific** (8): [obligatory Tik Tok reference] but no lie this is one my fave underrated Nicki verses ever

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): “what’s your name B.O.B so they are calling you Bob?” Nicki’s entire verse has me screaming

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): omg this was so nostalgic i had completely forgotten that this song existed

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7.5): Nicki frequently beats people on their own tracks, but rarely is she so mean about it

**cherryices** (7): so they calling you BOB?!

**hikkaru** (7): it's hyperpop. and nicki randomly singing the airplanes chorus is camp

**ImADudeDuh** (7): This is bob. Copy and paste him so he can take over youtube.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): okay that nicki verse was kinda iconic though

**Roxieloxie** (7): this is hyperpop

**slimboyfriend** (7): early 2010s pop rap is just suffering through an entire flop song to hear Nicki Minaj to drop a career-ending feature

**teenwitches** (7): this should be featuring b.o.b because nicki 1000% bodies him

**jman457** (6.3): aint even one of nicki’s best guest verses yet she kills BOB on here

**CrimsonROSET** (6): nicki i really didn’t need to be reminded of airplanes

**hostsmom** (6): would be better without the Donald Duck voice on the hook

**imasalesman** (5): Nicki Minaj was the best part of the song lol

**jasannn** (5): How did this become popular on tik tok? Anyways Nicki carrying as usual.

**jaztinax** (5): it’s a little too intense for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.5): this is one of those songs you only listen to for nick's verse

**frogaranaman** (4): when I saw B.o.B live he performed this song after he performed his flat earther song

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): yiiiiiiiiiiiikes

**runaway3212** (4): the outro is so wild and none of the verses are good

**Bajuko** (3): The Nicki Minaj portion is the only good part unfortunately

**FKJVMMP** (2): At least you can tell it’s unlistenable five seconds in. The original Yummy.

**GARjuna** (2): at least there's noise????

**IIIHenryIII** (1): He really was out of his mind when he decided to make this.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): icawnic

**timothy444** (1): mocking "Airplanes" was a low blow and Nicki is just full of herself here

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): and here we lose BRITney with another will.i.am single that sparked very polarized, love it or hate it responses. As much fun as I have seeing people like todd in the shadows tear this song to shreds, I've never really hated it and its always been very listenable to me thanks to the production and whoever is singing with Britney on the hook

---

**GARjuna** (11): king shit

**jman457** (11): Will.i.am walked so hyperpop could run. Also love britney singing in a lower range with a posh accent

**JunkyGS** (11): Britney's legendary last massive hit. Deserves to win cause it still goes off, the music video is iconic and Britishney JUMPED out. Also Screm & Shit is iconic

**1998tweety** (10): britney is so damn iconic on this

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): #FREEBRITNEY

**akanewasright** (10): I wanna scram and shit and get a big hit

**brenda\_official** (10): high camp

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): 13 y.o. me had way too much fun repeating "you are now-now rocking with will.i.am and britney, bitch!" 24/7.

**endcreditouilles** (10): if there are aliens out there i hope this is the first song they hear. "Take us to your leaders, Will I Am and Britney Bitch."

**Leixander** (10): british myah snapped

**plastichaxan** (10): another classic i can't wait to call it robbed in day 1/day 2

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i fucking love british britney

**rslashpoopheads** (10): IM TURNING THIS SHIT UP

**runaway3212** (10): it's britney bitch

**simplyterific** (10): Britney’s British accent is what makes this song so golden!! This was my second choice for an 11 tbh theres not really anything I dislike about this banger

**skargardin** (10): don't mind if i turn this shit up

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song was basically the theme for my last year of high school so automatic 10

**teenwitches** (10): britney's fake british accent makes this

**xavieryes** (10): turn the shit up

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I can’t make it not bop!! Will.i.am.ney made some points with this and Big Fat Bass, sue me

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , when Britney got possessed by a Bri'ish lady.

**hikkaru** (9): this song is so bad!!! but it's also so nostalgic sob

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I love this. I don't care if y'all hate it. (I'm not really sure if you do, but I get the impression people don't like this one).

**nyoom** (8.5): i think this was one of the first songs i heard that really drove in that my target demographic is out of touch and uncool now, which is a tough realization for a high schooler. "The song's composition was compared to the works of Azealia Banks, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, and P!nk." wow will.i.am, that's a lot of people to apologize to

**outsideeyess** (8.2): a collection of really iconic parts put together in an awkward way

**avg-vag** (8): for britney

**rickikardashian** (8): there was an earthquake after “britney bitch” was said once again

**slimboyfriend** (8): Britney's really pulling a Britney Jean on the verse huh

**waluigiest** (8): the tiktok trend kills me

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Anyone who gives this a low score doesn’t have the big brain energy this song deserves as a listener

**catjoon** (7): aged pretty badly but for some reason I still feel like dancing to it

**CreepyMannequin** (7): I kinda hate this song but I also kinda stan. Britney’s impact.

**jaztinax** (7): i refuse to believe that britney is actually on this track

**bigbigbee** (6.5): My friend once heard an acoustic cover of this in a café

**jasannn** (6.5): Me on the toilet

**seanderlust** (6.5): literally britney is the one part of this thats salvageable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): at least we know now she probably had no say in the british accent

**frogaranaman** (6): this song goes on way too long, to put it shortly

**timothy444** (6): Surprisingly doesn't annoy me as much as it used to

**musical\_pyn** (5): sorry britney

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5): i used to hateee this song but drag race made me change my mind lmao

**cherryices** (4): thanks tulisa

**CrimsonROSET** (4): ‘it goes on and on and on and on’ SO true.

**moonagenightmares** (4): this was released during the tail end of my britney stan era, was kinda the nail on the head

**celladonn** (3.5): This sounds so lifeless despite trying to be a club banger. I can't imagine getting hype to this.

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Scream and Shout. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Britney's conservatorship most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Britney's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Scream & Shout truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Britney's existential catchphrase "It's Britney Bitch," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as will.i.am's genius wit unfolds itself through their headphones. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Scream & Shout tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

**jsonphile** (3): it gets a point for having “Britney bitch” but other than that there’s not much to like about this song

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): Britney I'm so sorry but what the fuck is that accent???

**steelstepladder** (3): Will I Am's solo era was so much worse than everything he did with the group I'll say it

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): we love Myah Marie

**Awkward\_King** (2): it is kind of incredible how verifiably the only words britney actually sings on this song she is the star feature on are "its britney bitch"

**fadedblue09** (1): I’ve never been a big fan of Britney’s voice but wow why does she sound so terrible than usual here?? Making will.i.am sound like the more listenable one is...certainly a feat. No wonder she hired a ghost singer after this.

**TiltControls** (1): Sorry Britney, I don't think up is the direction I'm going to turn the volume for this

**companion\_star55** (0): i've always hated this :/

**ImADudeDuh** (0): thank god for Thrift Shop and Locked Out of Heaven blocking this from #1

**TragicKingdom1** (0): a black hole of a song that is so soulless it's honestly fascinating

**izeasklapaucius** (8): The best thing that have ever came out of Rivers' sellout era except maybe Can't Stop Partying for the "Okay bitches, Weezer and it's Weezy" line.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): this song is fine but tbh on the weaker end of the B.o.B singles here, so I have no objection to its day 2 exit. It still sends me though that this is tied with Beverly Hills for the highest charting song any of the Weezer members have done, what a weird-ass career arc

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly it wouldnt surprise me if this song and the entire rate have the same average, because if you can tolerate this, you can tolerate everything else. I eat this up with a spoon.

**endcreditouilles** (10): i'm 28 and I still swoon at this scene in pitch perfect

**fadedblue09** (10): Holy fuck this was Rivers Cuomo???

**frogaranaman** (10): literally how did this track even end up happening why did they hit up Rivers Cuomo for this chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is the best song anyone associated with Weezer has ever made

**moonagenightmares** (10): i love this song it makes me happy

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is the absolute most corny thing i've ever heard its absolutely terrible, this is a disney channel original movie reject, its the best song i've ever heard in my life

**runaway3212** (10): magic so true

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Weezers best song

**TiltControls** (10): the overflow of magic references is completely corny, but also 100% sells the song

**xavieryes** (10): this is one cheesy song, but idk it's just great. also it's kinda unbelievable that B.o.B gave fucking Rivers Cuomo from Weezer a top 10 hit in the 2010s (and it actually tied Weezer's top Hot 100 hit Beverly Hills)

**caseyfla** (9.5): I hate doing decimals, but it would be a 10 if he didn't claim he sings like Aretha.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Props to B.O.B. for making the verses better than the chorus, which is very rare when there's a feature artist in a rap song.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i am not happy that this bangs and is going off rn, do not perceive my score but this fucking slaps

**outsideeyess** (9): YESSSS bop, loved this in pitch perfect

**teenwitches** (9): another song i 100% associate with pitch perfect

**waluigiest** (9): (I got the magic baby)

**jsonphile** (8.5): this is just a ton of fun. We need more goofy songs like this

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8.5): why do I prefer the Pitch Perfect version lmaoooo

**GARjuna** (8): this is important

**hikkaru** (8): this song is so corny but the nostalgia it exudes is so powerful

**ignitethephoenix** (8): classic but once again this was overplayed for me

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Weezer.

**simplyterific** (8): this song used to go hard at the elementary school dances

**timothy444** (8): A song that Twilight Sparkle probably listens to lol jk she probably listens to classical avant-gande mixed with ska equestrian-dutch warfari stardust electronica

**cherryices** (7.5): this song sounds like a bowling alley

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I haven't forgiven y'all for making Magic the highest-rated Kylie song in Nu-Disco.

**jasannn** (7): Every track named Magic is good cheesy fun.

**kirby31200** (7): The late 2000s were a weird time for Rivers Cuomo

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): oh yeah this was Rivers’s "how do you do fellow kids" Can't Stop Partying era

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): oh god that sink cereal must be so unhygenic

**seanderlust** (5.8): really, rivers? every time you turn that track it turns to gold? you know we can hear Raditude, right?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): i never got into this song but tbh the chorus is kind of catchy

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): meh

**akanewasright** (5): This song’s existence is funny to me. Like… this peaked as high as weezer’s biggest chart hit, and it’s just… this

**steelstepladder** (5): Lol this is lame but there are orse things in the world

**1998tweety** (4): in middle school we did a dance to this and listening to it again wow this song is not really good huh

**awhile2** (4): i cant beleive there was a time in my life when i used to love this song

**thedoctordances1940** (4): Weezer

**nyoom** (3): thank you new york governor rivers cuomo, very cool

**catjoon** (2): the pop rap duo is just not working for me

**pleasegivemeasword** (1): i’m sorry but i hate it :/

**jman457** (0): Im not even a Weezer hater but this song is just so cringe and kidlike af.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): another song where I have to give credit for the audacity of the sample, but like... why??? it works fine, I don't mind it, so it gets an ok score, but still

**izeasklapaucius** (5): Feel like it shouldn't have influence my score but I have a bad memories attached to this song lmao. Xtina sounds cool in this one though.

---

**1998tweety** (10): please dont do legentina dirty

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): bop

**endcreditouilles** (10): this shit got me remembering that I really used to set my Myspace mood to "horny" in hopes that a specific person would see it. smh

**frogaranaman** (10): you know what…… Pitbull is right. we gotta feel this moment. Dale.

**Roxieloxie** (10): They went kinda hard on this i cant even lie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is such a serotonin boost. Pitbull is in full boisterous motivational speaker mode, pushing me to seize the day with a fraction of the force that Christina’s vocals have. I consider this the swan song for a simpler, more fun era of music and life in general. They really said “feel this moment because things are only about to get worse”. And the Take on Me sample, which I used to think was a cheap nostalgia grab, is iconic actually.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): christina's last hit??? tbh deserving

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Yes I also needed somebody else to point out that this samples take on me to notice it :soobcry:

**simplyterific** (9): can you believe that they were able to make a Take On Me sample GOOD?

**skargardin** (9): A-Ha could never

**static\_int\_husp** (9): How did I not know this interpolates Take On Me???

**akanewasright** (8.7): kinda can’t believe he got away with this sample… either way this bops

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): This is such a good bop.

**fadedblue09** (8): Why does this hook have to be wasted on a Pitbull song [2]

**hikkaru** (8): take on me DID outsell but it does bop

**runaway3212** (8): I remember being so into this when it just came out, young me had taste

**timothy444** (8): Besides stating the obvious sample from "Take on Me", I just love how absurd the references are in Pitbull's verses. Referencing 50 Shades of Grey, Slick Rick, and Don Shula? Dang, Pitbull really is Mr. Worldwide

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the take on me interpolation and Christina ate. Pitbull didn’t deliver to his standard tho

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): kind of a mess but still pretty enjoyable

**catjoon** (7): once again the chorus is just so great but the verses are just not doing it for me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i’m feeling bored

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The sample carries this.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): thinking about the time I saw a possible drag race lip sync cut of this song that nearly cut out all of pitbull

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): it was not until this year that i learned this sampled Take On Me

**xavieryes** (7): this is almost a great song but there's just something lacking

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7): forgot this song existed

**outsideeyess** (6.8): christina's vocal is soooo nice but the rest is kinda boring

**jman457** (6.6): xtina totally sells this song but Take on me would rate so much higher

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): doesn’t hit as hard as i remember :/

**GARjuna** (6): not much here

**jsonphile** (6): I like Christina fine but why did they gotta ruin take on me like that???

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Fun fact: the hook is stolen sampled from the iconic Take On Me and the chorus is stolen from inspired by the iconic Primadonna Girl.

**slimboyfriend** (6): Is this not just Give Me Everything Part II?

**seanderlust** (5.4): christina serves and the verses are fine. the a-ha interpolation feels a bit out of place, and overall i just don't see myself returning to this voluntarily

**nyoom** (5): "time is like money, only difference is i own it" i'm old and poor and can't relate

**TheQueenOfVultures** (5): They just cut off at such a weird time? I feel it needed like another 5 seconds of proper outro instead of cutting off so abruptly

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): throwback to the emoji movie cutting out pitbull's parts and just having the hook on loop at least 10 times for the duration of xtina's segment

**jaztinax** (4): not a fan of the way they used the a-ha sample

**TiltControls** (4): Christina sounds a little lifeless here

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this isnt objectively a bad song asnd yet i feel my ife would be infinitely improved if it didnt exist

**Leixander** (3): words cannot describe how much i hate this bland ass production

**steelstepladder** (3): This sample is just... too obvious.

**FKJVMMP** (2): Goddamnit Christina, stop trying so hard for once in your life. It’s a Pitbull song ffs.

**moonagenightmares** (2): idk why but this song made me cringe so hard

**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): I really didn't see this being as controversial as it is, but here we are. This has multiple 11s and a lot of support but multiple 0s that make it too heavily tanked to make day 3. I will say I really like this song a lot though, its just super sweet on all fronts. A bit of a robbery I fear

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): A good song with a surprisingly decent vocals from Adam Levine post-Hands-All-Over? Sign me up!

---

# stereo that only plays for you

**Roxieloxie** (11): This is actually a better song than My House by flo rida but we havent evented 12's yet on the scale

**runaway3212** (11): I just Adam Levine's part so much and every verse adds more energy I just love this song so much, it's the one here I think aged the best

**1998tweety** (10): another song we danced to in middle school but this one BOPS

**akanewasright** (10): Adam Levine is an obnoxious piece of shit who makes bad music 80% of the time (if I’m being generous), but GOD I love this song and him on the chorus. It’s just a burst of positive energy. I don’t have a specific memory for this one, but it was on the radio a lot, and it made me feel good when it was on.

**bigbigbee** (10): I think this song is absolutely adorable. Singing along to this, no matter where I am, makes me feel good. It has the energy I want to carry with me always. Feels like a smile.

**frogaranaman** (10): when people say “everybody moved” they actually are referencing when Gym Class Heroes released The Papercut Chronicles II featuring iconic hits such as Stereo Hearts and Ass Back Home

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Can we get this Adam Levine back

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Everything about this tune screams perfection!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): do you think Scooter Braun’s clients get radio payola in Adam Levine’s heart?

**skargardin** (10): Adam really ate this hook up

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): we love a maroon 5 collab

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I wasn’t expecting to like this so much. Adam’s voice actually works here and the verses really bop

**astrologicalangel** (9): I literally never knew that was Adam Levine omg

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Remember when Levine was actually good...

**TiltControls** (9): one of the few decent things Adam Levine did after 2010

**jasannn** (8.5): Im transported back to my mom's van listening to this song through cheap earphones.

**celladonn** (8): The lyrics to this really make no damn sense

**jaztinax** (8): the chorus melody is immaculate

**rslashpoopheads** (8): this chorus is crack

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i would support adam doing music like this again

**emayzee** (7.8): this probably isn't saying much but this has to be one of adam levine's best songs of the last 10 years

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): Adam's voice sounds really grating here, moreso than usual

**jsonphile** (7): this should be all Adam Levine does at this point just a hook on some rap song that a white suburban mom would listen to

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): this song is probably going to go out early bc Adam Levine but I think it's fine!

**nyoom** (7): GCH drymmer Matt McGinley explained the video to MTV News: "The video basically plays on the idea that we're sort of just being casual, hanging out, being ourselves and our shadows get wild and get loose. It's kind of fun. I've always felt like my shadow has been trying to kill me for 28 years." what? / adam levine? wish he was adam leaving

**teenwitches** (7): you could have told me this was maroon 5 featuring travie mccoy and i would have believed you

**timothy444** (7): Nostalgic family-friendly bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.3): adam levine is such a whiny bitch

**CrimsonROSET** (6): wait adam levine isnt in this band i swear i heard his vocals in the other songs too

**FKJVMMP** (6): I’m kinda surprised Adam Levine doesn’t get more rap hooks, he’s actually pretty good at them.

**GARjuna** (6): for the chorus

**kirby31200** (6): Why does Adam Levine sing how he does

**steelstepladder** (6): Just a bit too jack of all trades master of none for me here. Nothing is bad but I've never felt the need to seek it out

**jman457** (5.8): I feel like they put no effort into this bc they knew it was gonna be a hit

# skipping tracks

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): , lol

**seanderlust** (4.5): sorry I fucking HATE the sound of the verses and adam's voice bothers me on electropop songs

**thedoctordances1940** (4): Spicy hot take but Adam Levine's voice is still garbage

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): if this rate never happened i'd have never thought about this song again in my life and simply put its possible existence down to a lack of affection i received as a child

**simplyterific** (1): this is one of those songs that is so inoffensive and catchy that you either hate it or love it. I hate it

**CreepyMannequin** (0): oh god, I normally just hate Adam Levine’s voice but he is absolutely fucking atrocious on this

**Leixander** (0): kindly stop making music adam levine

**xavieryes** (0): This is foreshadowing how bad Maroon 5 would soon become. It's worse than almost everything Maroon 5 have released. If "good music can be so hard to find", this is a terrible place to start looking.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**cremeebrulee** (10): i am a sucker for space themed songs and this is just SO cute

**frogaranaman** (10): something about this song screams “classic”

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I actually like this one better than Like a G6. I mean… it's Ryan Fucking Tedder. As a OneRepublic fan, I naturally love this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3x4l1NN8yU this was camp

**Roxieloxie** (10): 'We're onto the next level super mario, i hope this works out cardio, till then let's fly: geronimo' This is the best song ever recorded next to My house by flo rida

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Ryan Tedder's greatest work

**runaway3212** (10): ALSO THE BEST SONG EVER

**simplyterific** (10): is it possible to resist singing along to this song?? It’s delightfully catchy and gives me an instant serotonin boost, easiest 10 so far

**jaztinax** (9.5): this takes me back to when nigahiga ruled youtube and i spent unhealthy amounts of my free time crying over kevjumba’s dad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): ascending

**jasannn** (9): Asian Excellence

**TiltControls** (9): deserved the popularity that G6 got

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): not as good as their first song but still a bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): it couldn't possibly follow up Like a G6, but it's still fun (despite the AWFUL rapping)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): i always liked this song even tho most ppl would say its trash. i am proud of my trash taste

**timothy444** (8.5): Let's be real, Ryan Tedder really helps elevate this song to another level.

**astrologicalangel** (8): that chorus is way better than it has any right to be

**bulforster** (8): If there's one thing Ryan Tedder can do, it's write a damn hook.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what song from the bg grab bag this sounds like? I’ll have figured it out by time of the reveal

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.8): not as good as i remember but still not a bad song

**jsonphile** (6.5): much better than the G6 song, mainly because the Far East Movement are terrible rappers, but their awkward rap works better as a dorky love song rather than a song where they try to act like the coolest kids in the club

**cherryices** (6.2): ryan tedder get your feet off the furniture

**akanewasright** (6): this is cute

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , heh!

**FKJVMMP** (6): It’s pleasant I guess. Ryan Tedder is no DEV.

**jman457** (5.8): when Ryan Tedder and co. started going downhill bc One republics 2009 was actually good. (but idk if yall are ready for that convo).

**nyoom** (4.5): come with meeee and you'll beeee, in a woooorld of pure imaginaaaation - the song i wish this was instead

**fadedblue09** (4): If I ever did that, I'd think I'd have a Heart Attaaaaa….oh

**kirby31200** (4): These guys can't rhyme

**Awkward\_King** (2): going to skip these other two and pretend that like a g6 is their only song in the rate

**GARjuna** (1): Y I K E S

# play this song on so many different dials

**cherryices** (11): has any song been used for more sporting events??

**FKJVMMP** (10): I really thought Tinie Tempah was the next big thing. This is still great though.

**frogaranaman** (10): the chorus is literally so iconic it makes up for the rest of the song I cannot do anything but give this a ten

**Hulnia** (10): A lot of the songs here are carried by the chorus, and this is definitely an example of that. The verses are pretty great, but compared to everything else, they pale in comparison.

**jsonphile** (10): okay this song actually really slaps. Also I remember enjoying the song back in 2010 but I do not remember that sick guitar solo radio stations must have removed it or something

**Leixander** (10): I'M ON MY WAAAAAAAA-EEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEEE

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): it’s just a bop and referencing Massive Attack’s Teardrop gets a 10 from me

**TChalla1966** (10): amazed to see tinie on here but what a great song

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Eric's part kinda gives off some eurovision vibes but just the pure nostalgia and grandiosity of this is so fucking amazing

**timothy444** (10): Now this is how you pump up the crowd: with a hella catchy chorus, punchy choruses and a backing track that sounds like it's meant to be played at the climax of a big blockbuster movie like Fast & Furious for example.

**1998tweety** (9): https://youtu.be/zWakVSvDxqw

**teenwitches** (9): my boyfriend gets misty eyed when he hears this because he associates it with when his favorite baseball team lost in the world series

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): now this is a solid pop rap song

**runaway3212** (8.5): This is actually a banger, im gonna be sad when it goes out day 1

**jman457** (8.1): Hopefully Tinie Tempah will get his due here in the US ala Labrinth

**GARjuna** (8): yess

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I'M ON MY WAYYYYYYEEEEAYYYYEEEEEEE

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): OH!

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): "i get more hits than a disciplined child" 💀💀

**akanewasright** (7.4): See I kinda like this but also I kinda think some of its bad. Would have been a 0 if I did this rate in 2012, but a lot of the song grew on me

**steelstepladder** (7.4): Thought I hated this but then I realized I was thinking of Hall Of Fame. They are pretty much the same song but this one is good.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ‘i got more hits than a disciplined child’ has to be up there for worst lyrics i heard in this rate

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7): yall remember that x-factor audition by that trio where the judges just basically one one of them to fuck off and the others to continue as a duo

**Awkward\_King** (6): i hate the chorus with such a passion which annoys me because i love tinie's verses so much. i want to give this a 0 but i also wanna give it like an 12

# going nowhere, running man

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the hook is the only good part

**moonagenightmares** (6): pass out outsold

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): it bothers me SO MUCH that Eric Turner is clearly playing something completely different on the piano than the actual song. Like, at the start of the song there is literally no piano, but he's playing a bunch of chords in the video like????

**outsideeyess** (5.5): i had no idea this was tinie tempah!! great hook, but the mix is lackluster

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): ehh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.5): this is just like... there

**imasalesman** (3): this song never ended

**nyoom** (3): that [message] won't [reach] me, because i can't read

**slimboyfriend** (3): First of all the lyrics, second of all, the featured singer is giving the most mediocre vocal performance yet GASPING for air at the end of every line.

**musical\_pyn** (2): this is that song from the greatest showman right

**TheQueenOfVultures** (2): Whatever 11 year old me was going through when I liked this song, I hope it sucked

**musical\_pyn** (11): I can't believe I've cried to this song

**nootnoot781** (11): correct this song is so good, this song is just straight serotonin.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it’s literally in the song name

**ImADudeDuh** (10): aka how his career could’ve been had he not done all that

**timothy444** (10): With this song, B.o.B. proves that he can carry a song on his own with his own catchy af chorus.

**runaway3212** (9.5): this is so good

**TiltControls** (9.5): feel good pop rap is the best kind

**jman457** (9.3): B.O.B at his absolute best. I would watch the music video on my bros DS all the time. Makes me live my vagabond fantasy.

**steelstepladder** (9.1): Was this the opening of a TV show or a commercial or something like that? It's killing me.

**jsonphile** (8.5): it’s just such a feel good song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): “Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar, in the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad” Omg he already went further around the globe (haha) than Chris Brown in International Love

**frogaranaman** (8): that chorus is so NOSTALGIC goddamn

**IIIHenryIII** (8): This dude got to work with Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift, Rivers Cuomo and Ryan Tedder? Respect!

**GARjuna** (4): HELP

**nyoom** (4): no good

**RandomHypnotica** (3): well this song isn't

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): This is cheesy nonsense

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): the fact that I thought this was a Taylor hook for like... a solid year when this song was big is embarrassing. Anyway, I will also use this space to say that Diddy's late 00s/early 10s albums Press Play and Last Train to Paris are both really interesting for the way they play around with styles of rap production which grew more and more prevalent in the years that followed. Bonus fun fact: These verses were written by both Jay-Z and J. Cole, which is some EXTREMELY star-studded ghostwriting

---

# Ain't No Stoppin Us Now

**frogaranaman** (11): this is just one of those songs that I can’t find a reason to hate. absolutely love it

**1998tweety** (10): good lorde what a bop

**CreepyMannequin** (10): I just adore this song <3

**cremeebrulee** (10): i hear 👂 the tears 💧 of a clown 🤡 i hate 🙅 that song 🎶 i always feel 🤔 like they talking 🗣 to me when it comes on 😔

**endcreditouilles** (10): i see we've reached the "cryin in the club" portion of the rate

**moonagenightmares** (10): this song made me really emotional when i was 10 for some reason

**moooo566** (10): skylar grey was on a bunch of great songs, i wish her solo career had gone better

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Hot take, I might like this more than Empire State of Mind. Diddy might not be the best rapper but he had conviction on this. Skylar Grey, Dawn Richard and Cassie on the same track is also a major serve.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i can't really explain why i love this song so much but that final chorus always makes me emotional

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Really good hook and the horns are fucking awesome

**akanewasright** (9): Hearing this unlocked a memory. My parents were strict about what I was allowed to put on my iPod, and since they didn’t play the radio in the car, I just didn’t hear much pop music or anything. However, I eventually figured out how to listen to the radio on my little iPod Nano, and this song was one that was on there constantly when I was living in a foreign country for a few months

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Part II is great too.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): skylar grey really had a stranglehold on features for this genre huh

**jman457** (8.7): This song was beyond overplayed with features in like every other trailer in the 2010’s, but it still is a modern classic

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Skylar Grey is a main pop girl.

**runaway3212** (8.5): The build is so pretty

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , this is better that expected

**CrimsonROSET** (8): surprisingly deep? but also is this counted as a christian song

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): England :pointandlaugh:

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Skylar’s chorus has provided movie & tv show trailer content for a decade, we love that for her

**jsonphile** (8): “I hear the tears of a clown I hate that song” screw you Diddy that’s one of the best songs ever written. Jokes aside, (yeah I know that’s not really what he means) I do like this song. It’s surprisingly uplifting, and while P Diddy has never been a particularly good rapper, his flow kinda works for this song

**skargardin** (8): good god this was overplayed back then

**timothy444** (8): Hearing him namedrop a song and then states that he hates it is such a bold way to start off your verses but in all seriousness, this is such a motivational banger that makes me smile everytime I hear it.

**jaztinax** (7.5): what happened to skylar grey anyway? she slayed this era

**TiltControls** (7.5): I won't stand for Tears of a Clown and A House Is Not a Home slander in this house

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i just learned diddy didn't write this which makes it very ??? that he didnt just give it to an artist who wouldve made it a bigger hit

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the fuck you do, fuck you do, bitch i hope the fuck you do

**outsideeyess** (7): god, the intro is so nice

**RandomHypnotica** (7): did skylar grey split into 2 black women just for this video

**teenwitches** (7): diddy hates a lot of music

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): i totally forgot this existed help

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): but it didn't come home :(((

**nyoom** (6): this is just a popheads rate ballot set to music

# Tears of a Clown

**seanderlust** (6): yeah, fuck smokey robinson!!! /s

**GARjuna** (5): I hate this beat

**hikkaru** (5): this is the easiest choice that i have had to make this entire rate... i'm going home.

**rickikardashian** (5): i dont like this chorus

**FKJVMMP** (4): I’ve tried so hard to like Skylar Grey, but she just has NO personality. It’s frustrating.

**Awkward\_King** (2): football is not

**nootnoot781** (2): so true 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 edit: nvm

**Leixander** (1): love skylar gray, that being said... blegh

**xavieryes** (1): "Coming Home", I hate that song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): a Toronto rapper who broke out years before Drake music was on anyone's radar! a pioneer!!! and a good song that just about got what it deserved by nearly making it through to Day 3

---

**1998tweety** (10): this is so damn good, dont do it dirty

**CrimsonROSET** (10): trigger warning: possible uwu speak in the comments

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This beat is sick.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): dangerous! Dangerous! BAD giiirl!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Canadian bop!

**xavieryes** (10): a fucking classic

**awhile2** (9): god this song makes me more nostalgic than any other song on this rate and i dont even know why

**cremeebrulee** (9): flabster

**runaway3212** (9): tiktok made points

**steelstepladder** (8.8): The rare occasion of a song in this rate being carried by the verses. Also incredibly surprising considering he's a one hit wonder.

**emayzee** (8.7): akon never missed

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): I cannot take this song seriously right now because of an inside joke at work but it still slaps

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this ssong so good its dangerous

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this chorus, Akon came, saw and conquered.

**akanewasright** (8): I don’t remember this song super well but it’s slaps

**rickikardashian** (8): \*looks to the right* dangerous (that girl is so…) \*looks to the left* dangerous

**Roxieloxie** (8): the misogyny could slap a bit harder i fear

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): banger

**thedoctordances1940** (8): It's slightly annoying but idk I really like it

**seanderlust** (7.5): kings of making every single girl and gay in 2011 feel like a bad bitch

**GARjuna** (7): the autotune??? hmm

**jaztinax** (7): i could’ve sworn this song belonged to the mid-2000s not early 2010s

**skargardin** (7): wait this bops

**jsonphile** (6.5): I haven’t heard this song in years but I immediately was able to sing every word of the chorus. Couldn’t tell you a single word of the verses.

**nyoom** (6.5): "no dissing me" who's gonna stop me, bird boy

**bigbigbee** (6): When this song came on I was like "oh this song is good". and then I realized I don't think it's THAT good it's just from a period of my life that I like

**kirby31200** (6): Virtually indistinct from multiple other songs in this rate

**simplyterific** (6): the song is just a little bit flat

**TChalla1966** (6): I mostly like this song for akon chorus and that’s it

**TragicKingdom1** (6): kinda repetitive and the good parts are worse than i remember

**DaHumanTorch** (5.8): meh

**celladonn** (5): I hate to say it, I hope I don't sound ridiculous, I don't know who this man in. He could be walking down the street and I wouldn't know a thing. Sorry to this man.

**frogaranaman** (5): the girl is dangerous because she eat hot chip and lie

**rslashpoopheads** (5): It's me. I'm the bad girl.

**slimboyfriend** (5): "I want her to make my black snake moan" :l

**timothy444** (5): Ain't a bad song but jeez it's really forgettable.

**jman457** (4.6): Alright, maybe dont have the nostalgic attachment to this song.

**FKJVMMP** (3): Akon still sucks.

**jackisboredtoday** (9): Our last exit of day 1 is a bop that I have played FAR too much in middle school. Despite my regrets for the time I was into Sia this song still does sound amazing in my ears

---

**frogaranaman** (10): I think Sia is like maybe the fifth most problematic person in this rate

**outsideeyess** (10): the vocal performance on this makes me weak

**TChalla1966** (10): David Guetta has a remix of this that’s better but otherwise they ate this up left 0 crumbs

**TiltControls** (10): sia sucks but this song does not

**simplyterific** (9.8): I love any song that references shutting down a club its my kryptonite

**celladonn** (9.5): Can't see me with ten binoculars

**1998tweety** (9): There used to be this game on Facebook called Wild Ones and I would always sing this while playing nnnnn

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): well this goes off a bit, too bad about ableism on the track… Sia does slay vocally but this would be great even without her oooohing in cursive over it, the beat and Flo Rida’s delivery are so energetic

**jman457** (8.5): Its not Sia’s best pop feature from that time but its still a really good on

**seanderlust** (8.5): don't shut down the club sia there's a pandemic we need to support them financially :(

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): fuck sia but she knows how to steal the spotlight and make a hit. Flo Rida + Sia is meant to smash

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Not Flo Rida working with the ableist Sia, the most problematic person in the rate by far.

**runaway3212** (8): okay i've decided im not gonna tank this because of sia just like im not tanking all luke's songs. I think this is a great song with an amazing hook, but it's ouclassed by I Cry in every way imo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): 2012 was sia's comeback year

**timothy444** (8): Definitely has Australian summer hit written on it and with the inclusion of Songbird Se- I mean Sia on it, it definitely feels like an Australian classic even though it's a Flo Rida song lmao

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): lol at the pitch correction on Flo Rida's voice when he tries to sing "oooo"

**catjoon** (7): sia’s voice actually sounds great

**hikkaru** (7): Maybe you're just a bad singer.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): The bridge is the highlight of this one. Also, back then I swore this was Rihanna.

**musical\_pyn** (7): sia's hook is so good here

**static\_int\_husp** (7): a decent song from before Sia was #problematic

**thedoctordances1940** (7): Yeah it's alright, it's exactly what you'd expect from Flo Rida

**moonagenightmares** (6.5): used to hate this song but nostalgia is kinda kicking my ass

**akanewasright** (6): Flo Rida did what he had to do on these verses but :/

**nootnoot781** (6): it’s a good song but fuck sia

**nyoom** (6): if i caught a fly it'd be a buzzer beater/if i unzipped your pants it'd be a touchdown/if i dissed you at a live poetry event it'd be a slam dunk

**rslashpoopheads** (6): horny Titanium

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): I took off 3 points because of Sia

**CrimsonROSET** (5): you heard it wrong xoxo

**TheQueenOfVultures** (5): Can't listen to this without thinking about that early todd in the shadows review where some hipster guy goes on about how indie and unique Sia is and then todd responds with the chorus to this

**waluigiest** (5): this is not as good as I remember

**GARjuna** (4.3): for sia

**jaztinax** (3): oh no i always hated this song, although i will say i like the chorus better now than i did before

**awhile2** (2): i find sia insufferable most of the time, this song included

**cremeebrulee** (2): sia’s chorus makes this literally unlistenable to me

**FKJVMMP** (2): I prefer the verses to the hook. That should never happen on a Flo Rida song.

**Awkward\_King** (1): ????????? why sia sound like she's in pain?? did someone tell her to respect not able bodied people??

**Leixander** (1): sia sounds so bad here it hurts
