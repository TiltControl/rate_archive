plastichaxan: is this the lowest average in a rate yet? cause that's kinda iconic in a way
[/r/popheads/comments/oq7uye/pop_rap_rate_reveal_day_1_some_scores_that_went/h69xvcn/]

=====

TiltControls: It's 6th lowest! With Billboard 2012, Billboard 2010's Decade End, Bangerz vs. Revival vs. Confident, One Hit Wonderland, and Teenage Dream vs. Fame Monster vs. Animal + Cannibal being the only ones lower.

edit: it came pretty close to bottom 5 too! It's separated from #4. One Hit Wonderland and #5 Katy/Gaga/Kesha by 0.005 points and 0.003 points respectively

rslashpoopheads: How on earth did a rate with 3 main pop girls and sub faves at their peaks have one of the lowest averages ever????

TiltControls: Early rates definitely were a very different time with regards to scoring. It'll be interesting seeing the glowup from the 1989 / DW / Emotion rerate next month considering that one holds the 10th lowest rate average. (And 1989 still holds the 3rd lowest album average across all rates)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): This definitely was tanked by the Chris Brown association, which honestly is for the best, even if this is probably one of Pitbull's best songs if I imagine a different hook singer. As it is, the song is fun but I'm happy with it being out at the very beginning of this rate

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): Your zeroes means nothing I've seen what makes you people cheer

---

# Mr. Worldwide

**IIIHenryIII** (10): PG-13 Talk Dirty. "En Cuba la cosa 'ta dura", never mind.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking BOP

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): honestly a 10 but i docked a point for the existence of chris brown

**timothy444** (9): I'm going to separate the featured artist from the song because honestly the hook is just so fricken' catchy and I love how self-aware Pitbull is with the topic of the song LMAO

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , oh.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): can we skip the comments on this one i don’t want to talk about it

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i'm so sorry to all women but this is kinda a smash

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): I hate that I don't hate this

**hikkaru** (7.5): it bops a little but FUCK CHRIS BROWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

**emayzee** (7.3): points deducted for chris brown feature

**1998tweety** (7): minus 1 point for Chris Brown

**ignitethephoenix** (7): not bad but it’s just very bland and boring. Also Chris browns part literally sounds like it was supposed to be sung by Justin Bieber which I would prefer because then wouldn’t have to listen to Chris brown

**jaztinax** (7): i had to skip this because of you know who but i know this is a solid song

**steelstepladder** (7): Pitbull's verses are some of the best he's ever had here and the chorus isn't that bad to where it totally tanks the song (other than the person actually singing it). Chris is definitely the weakest part of this song though

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): tbh this is a lowkey banger but the chorus could go harder

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): Yeah fuck Chris Brown, but the song isn't even that bad. Sure Chris Brown sounds a bit rough here but there's a good melody at least.

**awhile2** (6): this is arguably the most pitbull song in the rate

**caseyfla** (6): Actually not bad? Despite Chris Brown being involved.

**jasannn** (6): For some reason, this was my favorite song in 2011. I even bought it from iTunes. Looking back, the song is pretty basic. The chorus is catchy but it doesn't flow with the verses at all.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): i know this is gonna be first out cos of chris brown yuck but i love the touchdown line

#Local

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Catchy chorus, but wow the autotune on Chris Brown is grating

**frogaranaman** (5): hate that the chorus is so fucking good

**jsonphile** (5): so this song actually represents a significant moment for me. Around the time of these songs, I was at the point in my piano career where I was learning pop songs on my own generally by going on YouTube and finding tutorials. This song however, I was able to figure out how I would play it on piano without even needing a piano. I heard it on the radio for the first time one day, and was able to guess what the chords and melody were, and then when I checked later I was entirely correct. First time I had ever done that. And I was able to do it because this song is so simple and basic with the most obvious chord progression and melody imaginable. So it gets a point for being a significant moment in my life, but it also loses a point for Cs Bn

**kirby31200** (5): One of the most serviceable songs I've ever heard. Not objectable, not notable, not grating, not interesting. It just exists

**nyoom** (5): "cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me" is my favorite mountain goats line from a pitbull track

**jman457** (4.9): yall are lucky Look at me Now wasnt on this rate bc I would have turned into misogynist for that

**Awkward\_King** (3): this would be like a 3.5 if it wasnt chris brown so beyond having an abuser on it its also just bland

**FKJVMMP** (3): A song Chris Brown ruined? That’s normal. A song he ruined that wasn’t really his fault (I’m assuming he didn’t write the lyrics)? It’s novel.

**nootnoot781** (3): why are there massive gaps in the song? i think there should be a chorus after he raps but it’s just instrumental? huh weird. he should’ve got a singer to sing the chorus or something

**rslashpoopheads** (3): why are we rating this when we could be rating Priyanka Chopra - Exotic (feat. Pitbull)

**TiltControls** (3): ew

**outsideeyess** (2.5): Chris' chorus is so jarring and I hate these synths, I just genuinely feel nothing from this song

**pleasegivemeasword** (2.5): it just doesn’t hit

**bigbigbee** (2): Ignoring the obvious, the lyrics for this are really bad

**catjoon** (2): don’t care for it (and him)

**celladonn** (2): "Chris Brown, this for the women worldwide" Keep it

**CreepyMannequin** (2): okay usually I just give Chris Brown songs a 0 or 1 instictively, but this kinda bops so it can have an extra point

**seanderlust** (1.7): we popping the biggest bottles if this gets a lower average score than earth. for the record I am not just tanking this because it's Chris brown - I am also tanking this because it's bad

**rickikardashian** (1): even ignoring chris brown being chris brown, he’s the worst part of this song by far

**runaway3212** (1): no

**Saison\_Marguerite** (1): This gets one point for at least having a hook, but that almost makes it worse because I do not want a domestic abuser’s voice stuck in my head. On pettier note, it always irrationally bothered me how Chris Brown only names American cities in a song called INTERNATIONAL Love with Mr. WORLDWIDE?! Chorus aside, Pitbull’s lyrics make Jason Derulo in Talk Dirty seem like a paragon of sensitivity. It’s a no from me.

**skargardin** (1): goodbye

**waluigiest** (1): bye Chris Brown

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): automatically gets this score because of Chrs Brwn I’m not even gonna bother listening

**95ztaehyung** (0): chris brown (derogatory)

**\_SoulGlitch** (0): Chronic Beater deserves every 0 in this rate

**akanewasright** (0): Fuck Chris Brown

**astrologicalangel** (0): no

**avg-vag** (0): you’re not going to make me listen to chris brown unless it’s forever

**cremeebrulee** (0): i mean even without chris brown, this is definitely pitbull’s worst song of the group

**GARjuna** (0): turns out trash makes trash music

**imasalesman** (0): Thanks for making me listen to Chris Brown

**moooo566** (0): fuck that guy

**RandomHypnotica** (0): do i need to say it

**static\_int\_husp** (0): sorry but Chrxs Brxwn doesn't even add anything to this song

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): a song I associate with a LOT of radio play during my childhood. Despite that, this was one of the least familiar songs in the rate for me. While I don't hate it perse, I can't say I disagree with it being one of the earliest exits here

**izeasklapaucius** (2): Somehow I just learned about this track when me and u/jackisboredtoday were discussing about the song list lmao. Anyways ummm it's shit

---
# on a roll, solid flow

**runaway3212** (9): I'm addicted to buying unbelievably expensive custom helicopters (yeeeeeeaaahhhh) In a brief moment of lucidity I went to the helicopter dealership and told them "Do not, under any circumstances, sell me more helicopters" I was back there half an hour later, wearing a fake moustache, and I said "Hello gentlemen, I am Ray J, a man you have never met before. Give me 10,000 helicopters covered in diamonds"

**rickikardashian** (8.5): my shoes when i was 7 years old and i hadnt learn how to tie them:

**teenwitches** (8): we need to bring swag back

**Roxieloxie** (7): this is reminding me of how jacob latimore - like em all was fucking robbed from being in this rate

**skargardin** (7): bop!

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

# tied down

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): Yes, music, that's what Ray J is known for

**frogaranaman** (5): god this is so late 2000s it hurts

**jasannn** (5): 2010's filler radio hit

**Leixander** (5): not Ray J lmaooo

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.5): this is a lot worse than i remember it lol

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this song is so fucking grating

**CrimsonROSET** (3): … anyway

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I don’t like this, but I support a New Boyz comeback

**kirby31200** (3): We've reached levels of autotune that shouldn't be possible

**slimboyfriend** (3): why are they being so mean to this poor woman

**seanderlust** (2.6): why does every song by or featuring ray j from this era sound like it had a $20 budget?

**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): the production on this is unnervingly crunchy

**nyoom** (2): girl dump his ass

**rslashpoopheads** (2): um hehe

**jman457** (1.8): I feel bad rating this so low as a person who unironically listens to 100 gecs but this is both boring and hard to listen too

**FKJVMMP** (1): This wasn’t a hit where I lived so hatred of it didn’t get ingrained into my DNA like my zero but this is definitely by far the worst song in this rate.

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Please, don't tie 'em down, tie 'em up!

**jsonphile** (1): ughhh every sound of this song just sounds wrong. Also this album cover makes them look like the hip hop version of big time rush

**moonagenightmares** (1): painfully bad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (1): a zero contender, but I can excuse a couple of teenagers and Kim Kardashian’s ex making bad music, not so-called GOAT Eminem

**steelstepladder** (1): New Boys and Ray J confirmed for being against ropeplay. I can't support this.

**timothy444** (1): what the hell is this?

**celladonn** (0): This is just embarrassing. Amateurish in every regard

**endcreditouilles** (0): I miss the old Kim K, ride Ray J's pole Kim K

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Anyone who complains of being tied down is a walking red flag

**musical\_pyn** (0): easily my zero, these lyrics are atrocious and the beat isn't interesting enough to deserve at least one point

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): That parachute line shouldve shelved this song

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): The hook does bop a little bit, but this song is mostly generic, although it remains extremely funny to me that Bieber didn't show up for the music video but, in a true moment of pop-rap synergy, LMFAO did

**izeasklapaucius** (5): God, Justin's vocals are suuuuper boring and flat for a pop rap chorus.

---

**jaztinax** (10): hell yeah dirty bass

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I love me some dirty bass. JB is useless here, though.

**Leixander** (9): video iconic and makes this song better

**RandomHypnotica** (8): the 2 kings of pop rap combine to make a mediocre song

**seanderlust** (8): underrated bop methinks

**1998tweety** (7.5): production is good but lyrics are meh

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I totally forgot this song existed help

**timothy444** (7): This screams 2012 and honestly I don't care. It is a bop and Justin's pre-puberty voice in the chorus nails the fun harmless dance-pop-rap vibe that this song was going for!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , weh?

**bigbigbee** (6): I was watching this music video and I was like I don't recognize them here and then I realized it was because they have hair

**thedoctordances1940** (6): eh no. It's not terrible, pretty run for the par for bieber, but nothing i'd ever revisit

**CrimsonROSET** (5): holy fuck can you go one song without referencing jets

**endcreditouilles** (5): this sounds like the walmart version of a basshunter song

**jman457** (5): Its very in the middle, not the worse but like not the best

**nyoom** (5): "The Live My Life Songfacts reports that song features Justin Bieber on its hook. The Far East Movement guys got to know Justin after Snoop Dogg introduced them at an awards show in 2011." judging from this song, justin might be harboring some resentment about that

**rslashpoopheads** (5): how dare this song remind me of my days spent on Gchat

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): hot take: the worse Justin Bieber collab in this rate

**simplyterific** (5): the chorus is so disappointing :(

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): well this one bops a lil at least

**GARjuna** (4): the beat is uh something???

**jasannn** (4): not the swag asians 😭

**kirby31200** (4): This sounds a little like every other song in this rate but not quite as good

**skargardin** (4): oh no.. i remember liking this but it's absolutely not hitting

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i was such a belieber in 2010 and listened to anything justin put out but even i couldn't get into this song

**akanewasright** (3): this is…. fine :/

**runaway3212** (3): I don't love this that much

**teenwitches** (3): sounds like a lmfao reject

**steelstepladder** (2.7): Oh wow this one just sucks

**frogaranaman** (2): I remember this being better ……..

**jsonphile** (2): okay this is far worse than the G6 song

**plastichaxan** (2): don't<3

**xavieryes** (2): When this song came out I was still around the peak of my Bieber hate so I refused to listen to it. Turns out I wasn't missing much.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): o no

**moonagenightmares** (1): it was painful trying not to skip this

**waluigiest** (0): the style is so derivative of successful artists at the time, but it fails to capture any of their charm or intrigue

**jackisboredtoday** (8): I have a LOT of nostalgia for this because I was obsessed with it in middle school, so I am extremely forgiving to it even as I have to admit that it has not aged well. Also this is one of a couple moments in this rate where the clean version feels clearly better than the explicit, if only because that deletes some of the most awkward lines

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): It's OK, I guess? Nothing to write home about. Em and Royce's verses is alright. Bruno is ballading as he was back then. My sister really liked the Karmin cover one. OMG remember Karmin?

---
# "I woke up, still king"

**frogaranaman** (10): I always really liked this song for some reason.. not for, like, it being a good song or anything. it’s just kind of nice

**skargardin** (10): the nostalgia is too strong in this score i fear, i can't resist giving this a ten honestly

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This one used to get me so emotional. I think I even cried to this at one point.

**moooo566** (9): feel like bruno mars has shown up a lot in this rate

**jasannn** (8.5): I really downloaded this song solely for the Bruno chorus.

**jaztinax** (8.5): this one is for all the 13 year old boys writing “had a dream, i was king. i woke up, still king” on social media back in the day (ps: bruno mars supremacy)

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**jman457** (8): I remember buying this song the first day it came out hating it three months later when it was played like every other song on the radio

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I legitimately wasn't aware of who this duo actually was so before googling I thought "doesn't this guy sound a lot like Eminem"? Yeah I guess it's because it actually is Eminem lol.

**outsideeyess** (7.8): "you're going down on something you don't wanna see, a hairy box"

**endcreditouilles** (7.4): i'm sorry but does royce say he's second best because eminem is on this track too?? He doesn't wanna catch ANY heat jsdkadjls

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , what u gonna do with u, huh?

**DaHumanTorch** (7): had a dream i was gay woke up still gay

**fadedblue09** (6.5): My 13-year old self was disappointed when I found out this wasn’t a Bruno solo song

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): glad that Bruno did all these cheesy choruses so he could make that bag and then eventually go on to better stuff like Silk Sonic

**cherryices** (6): how many times are we going to see that damn piano in this rate

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): i like the chorus but that's it

# "the rap game's nipple was mine for the milking"

**timothy444** (6): Let's face it, we only listened to this because of Bruno Mars and even then its already sounds a bit dated. It's the kind of song where you only listen to it once a year to remember the early 2010s because yeah… it reeks of 2011.

**emayzee** (5.8): this did not have to be 5 minutes long

**cremeebrulee** (5): god how many fucking times is bruno in this rate

**CrimsonROSET** (5): who is this eminem knockoff? what do you mean that is eminem?

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): I enjoyed Bruno on the chorus but not much else to be honest, it feels a bit messy tbh

**rslashpoopheads** (5): enough

**plastichaxan** (4.5): too much bruno in this rate and only two songs are good

**bigbigbee** (4): By the time that this song came out, I was getting sick of songs that sounded like this, and it still hasn't grown on me since then

**catjoon** (4): just doesn’t mesh well to me

**FKJVMMP** (4): If this was like three separate songs fleshed out they could probably all be 8s.

**GARjuna** (4): eminem kills me

**jsonphile** (4): Eminem on this beat with the Bruno Mars hook is like putting hot sauce on ice cream. Yes both of these things can be good but in very different ways and not together

**runaway3212** (4): disjointed

**slimboyfriend** (4): Bruno Mars's early work is so cheesy but at least there's a line about Wendy Williams here

**teenwitches** (4): this song was insufferable and also inescapable on the radio in 2011, it's only saved by bruno's vocals

**TragicKingdom1** (4): i can't believe i ever liked this song there's just so much wrong with it

**waluigiest** (4): I feel like this is a legendary collaboration but it’s just so uninspired

**nyoom** (3): we already had nothin on you once this rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): idk why i had this in my playlist in 2011 bc it's just bad

**seanderlust** (2.8): stop yelling at me eminem

**TiltControls** (2): Much like the foods, Eminem(s) and cheese do not go well

**akanewasright** (1): This is bad but I have memories of listening to it on the radio while on vacation in a city I’d never been to before but now love (along with a few other actually good songs like We R Who We R) and so I have nostalgia

**Awkward\_King** (1): ok but why

**celladonn** (1): I'm holding up my lighter to set fire to this song. Why is Eminem's voice so poorly mixed. Both of the rappers sound so bad over this cheesy instrumental, their flows and delivery just do not match it at all. "Something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box"????? Fuck right off. This only evades my 0 because the Wendy Williams line made me exhale through my nose.

**CreepyMannequin** (1): Not only is this one of Bruno’s worst performances, it’s also an asinine song regardless

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this production sounds like a minecraft parody of itself with a couple more swears

**moonagenightmares** (1): eminem is embarrassingly bad in this

**rickikardashian** (1): where did that wendy william line come from

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): eat the cat to get the pussy

**xavieryes** (1): ran out of fluid pretty quick

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): Did Eminem's verse here inspire Lin-Manuel to make Hamilton? Sorry, Bruno, you deserved to be featured on a better song with a better hook.

**hikkaru** (0): early 10s eminem and early 10s bruno is a duo made of absolute nightmares. like they were literally making the most boring songs to ever exist yet were racking up hits with them and WE DID NOT NEED THEM TO COLLAB

**nootnoot781** (0): I WASTED FIVE MINUTES LISTENING TO THIS???? disgusting song, vile.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): In between Eminem barking about cock, the fucking hairy box lyric, and Bruno’s treacly hook failing to mesh with the aggressive verses, this is a hot damn mess. With none of the fun that makes a hot mess worth it.

**steelstepladder** (0): Ew, no. This is a brain off rate. Stop trying to make me feel things.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): is this supposed to be inspirational because it really only inspires me to find a better song

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): If you think LMFAO doesn't have stans, you're dead wrong. We had this assignment back in the middle school to give a presentation about any figure you think is a legend and why. One of my classmate, of all people, LITERALLY choose Redfoo (the cousin one from LMFAO) as the subject of his presentation lmaooooooooooo Fauzan if you're reading this I still remember our English teacher facepalming as you open your presentation.

**jackisboredtoday** (3.2): Our first LMFAO exit comes with multiple first recorded 11s for the group, finally breaking their no-11 streak. While I can appreciate the silliness of this song in concept, I can't say I would ever want to listen enough to justify anything but an early exit here

---

# Party Rocking

**brenda\_official** (11): masterpiece

**celladonn** (11): This is hyperpop

**kirby31200** (11): I was worried this wasn't as good as I thought it was when I was 12, but it's actually better. This may not be the "correct" 11, and it may go day 1, but it's what my heart says

**Awkward\_King** (10): lmfao could write pride and prejudice but jane austen couldn- 19TH CENTURY GUNSHOTS

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is high camp. i know it's gonna tank so i'm preemptively saying THIS DESERVED BETTER!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this may be my worse take in the rate but I absolutely love this song. It’s not objectively a 10 but like I just have to give it a 10 for nostalgia and how obnoxiously fun it is

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this one has the best instrumental of the 3 LMFAO tracks here, and I kinda love that they made these absolute powerbops have a narrative arc that they absolutely did not need

**TChalla1966** (10): Sorry for Party Rocking: 10 to think this was their last single talking ending it all on a high

**waluigiest** (10): this is transcendental. I can’t explain the plane that this song takes me to

**awhile2** (8): rrhett and link of gmm aare in this music video fyi

**rickikardashian** (8): THIS is how you make an apology

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**GARjuna** (7): did not expect to like this

**moooo566** (7): not convinced theyre sorry at all!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (7): This song isn't quite good enough for me to overlook their bad singing

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i don’t think i have ever blacked out with my sack out, but thanks for the advice

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): "if she has a hissy fit cause you got whiskey dick" Tramps Stamps OVER!!!

# how dare you i demand you apologize RIGHT NOW
**\_SoulGlitch** (5.5): this song is more annoying than it is fun im sorry yall

**jman457** (5.3): The production is really cool but this is really LMFAO at their lyrical and vocal worse, and truly aged worse than most of their other songs

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): , what's with the same fuckin' title, but replacing a single word

**CrimsonROSET** (5): apologize hon

**IIIHenryIII** (5): The weakest of the dumb party songs trinity.

**jasannn** (5): I was gonna tank but i heard the bridge

**plastichaxan** (5): i just keep thinking about that line at the end of the video…………

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): not a banger

**teenwitches** (5): can you believe these guys are directly related to berry gordy

**jaztinax** (4): you should indeed be sorry for party rocking

**pleasegivemeasword** (4): the worst of the party rocking songs

**simplyterific** (4): I’m still not sure what party rocking is but the instrumental sounds like someone burping and I can’t take it

**steelstepladder** (4): Why does the beat have hiccups.

**timothy444** (3.5): I get it's a party anthem so there isn't really an expectation of deep pronounced lyrics but yeah... you only really need to listen to the chorus before you'd want to switch to another song.

**akanewasright** (3): This… isn’t good. I can’t defend it, especially after the music video

**runaway3212** (3): this reminds me of those terrible youtuber apologies that are worse than their first offence

**seanderlust** (2.5): sometimes you look back on songs from this era and you're like "this is fun!" sometimes you look back on songs form this era and think "oh, this...this is alcoholism." this is the latter

**jsonphile** (2): party rock all you like but can you apologize for making terrible music?

**astrologicalangel** (1): apology not accepted this song sucks

**cremeebrulee** (1): their mistake was to apologize smh own up to your party rocking!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): I've managed to avoid this song until this rate... Worst minutes of my life. Edit: /u/RandomHypnotica, worstie, why are you like this...

**frogaranaman** (1): this gave me a migraine

**imasalesman** (1): ew

**musical\_pyn** (1): wow I completely forgot how completely unlistenabe this is

**rslashpoopheads** (1): how about Sorry For Making This Song

**skargardin** (1): god this is even more annoying than I remember

**TiltControls** (1): i doubt it

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): I wish I could give multiple zeroes but Sexy And I Know It is far worse so this one gets one point I guess

**bigbigbee** (0): I think this is pretty bad, and there's a certain line in the MV that really turned me off this whole thing - I know that 2012 was a "different time" but it wasn't THAT long ago and these guys were full-on adults, not stupid high schoolers or whatever. The song itself also feels like a "sell out", as much as LMFAO can sell out; as a friend said, it feels like it's trying too hard to seem like it's not trying hard.

**nyoom** (0): nobody has ever chosen to play this at their house party and that is the single worst indictment anyone can give an LMFAO track

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I’m writing this before ballots open and I just KNOW you’re all gonna rob this and I just want to say I am preemptively upset about it. Coming back to this now that ballots are in and I was right, this is a robbery imo and I'm really sad to see it leave extremely early since this song is admittedly super sentimental for me, but even if it didn't do as well as I would have wished I'm still glad to see it rated

---

# So high, looking down at the sky

**Roxieloxie** (10): I didnt really care to go look up any of the context for most of the songs in this rate but i kinda felt compelled for this song, and like b.o.b. now is a mess but idk, I really enjoy this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): the number of times I listened to this sobbing on an airplane

**runaway3212** (8.5): this is strangely amazing

**jman457** (8.1): Ok this album had a vampire weekend/Janelle Monae collab and yall chose not to rate it. Yall did him dirty by choosing his worse songs. But this song is really catchy

**akanewasright** (8): Oh wow, he produced this song by himself. And it’s like… really good

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Fall in your ways so you can crumble.

**jsonphile** (8): I don’t think I’ve ever heard this song but it’s nice. I mean, don’t let me fall more like don’t let me fall of the edge of this flat earth am I right??

**xavieryes** (8): don't worry B.o.B just stay away from the edge of flat earth and u won't fall

**jaztinax** (7.5): i have never heard this song before what

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): might not be a party banger but B.o.B has some of the best lyrics on the list

**awhile2** (6): i remember loving this song but relistening to it now the production is so messy

**CrimsonROSET** (6): off the edge? (this is my only flat earth joke in the rate)

# you let him fall

**IIIHenryIII** (6): The chorus ruined the song. Why is he singing?

**ImADudeDuh** (6): well you fell off, does that count?

**rickikardashian** (6): this song is trying everything to be emotional and euphoric

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): Is this ironic coming from a flat earther

**cherryices** (5.5): don’t let me fall off the edge of the earth

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): ah this is why B.o.b got other people to sing his choruses for his other songs

**1998tweety** (5): and this is why u get other people to sing your songs

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Balladphobia + Misandry = Day 1

**moonagenightmares** (4): way too long

**nyoom** (4): my guy, you are flopping with or without me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): this would be better if B.o.B let a stronger singer perform the hook, he doesn’t sell it IMO

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): sorry for the slow song phobia but nah

**teenwitches** (4): needs more hayley williams

**waluigiest** (4): too soft

**catjoon** (3): the singing just irritates me

**FKJVMMP** (3): Hey, maybe don’t ever sing without a ton of effects again please.

**frogaranaman** (3): I will let you fall sorry

**GARjuna** (3): too slow!!!

**nootnoot781** (3): zzz zzz zzz

**timothy444** (2.5): Forgettable and wouldn't listen to it again

**kirby31200** (2): "Don't let me fall" - B.o.B. at the edge of the flat Earth

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): what is this doing here

**Awkward\_King** (1): ok but why?

**brenda\_official** (1): headache

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i just don't like bob's rapping so a solo song is my worst nightmare

**outsideeyess** (0): could he just not a guest artist to sing the chorus? sorry bob, but every time the chorus played, my score dropped, until... well, yeah

**jackisboredtoday** (7): a little weird that this song seems to pretend smoking has positive health effects but its still fun and all three of these people deserve to still be more relevant than they are

---

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): tbh i quite enjoyed usher's edm phase

**TiltControls** (9.5): I'm a sucker for live your life to the fullest songs and luckily there was no shortage of that in the early 2010's

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): That breakdown hit me straight into the colon polyp.

**hikkaru** (9): electro house drops are so nostalgic i could cry

**timothy444** (9): Doesn’t really fit under the category of "pop rap" but hey, it's a bop so I'm not complaining

**jman457** (8.4): apparently I went my whole youth growing up during this time without ever hearing the song, but its pretty good.

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**bulforster** (8): If the drop was a tiny bit less grating this could easily have been a 10.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): pre-credits song of a college movie but they’re graduating and its a montage of all the parties they had and the fun they had and the friendships and the moments that’ll last forever in their memory can you tell the pandemic has really fucking got to me

**jsonphile** (7): Huh don’t remember this song at all. But it’s pretty solid until that awful David Guetta drop

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Everything up to the drop is really nice. the drop sounds like a cheese grater though

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): Yeah it's alright, a little bit over the top

**ignitethephoenix** (6): kind of boring and inoffensive

**\_SoulGlitch** (5.5): didn’t care for this one

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): write "women weed and alcohol" on my tombstone too

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this drop is very annoying

**jaztinax** (5): anyone know how this song did in europe? i have NEVER heard this song???

**kirby31200** (5): It's so good all the way up til the drop. This was a huge miss for David Guetta

**plastichaxan** (5): why does this sound like a self-help song idk how to describe it

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): too much is going on

**frogaranaman** (4): you can REALLY hear David Guetta in this track

**jasannn** (4): too cheesy

**nyoom** (4): props to david guetta for having a distinctive sound, but did it have to be this one

**waluigiest** (4): this is all of the bad parts of David Guetta’s style

**akanewasright** (3): This cheap ass drop

**cremeebrulee** (3): this will get points because i find usher cute

**FKJVMMP** (3): I hate to do this to Ludacris but man, David Guetta is just not good.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I've literally never heard this song before.

**steelstepladder** (3): I didn't hate this at first but that drop is awful. Just the worst sound in this rate.

**DaHumanTorch** (2.5): this was so bad, that drop....horrendous

**runaway3212** (2.5): god this drop is ugly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): this sounds like a disney channel friends for change song

**TragicKingdom1** (2): this arguably aged worse than anything else in the rate

**IIIHenryIII** (1): This encapsulates the worst of early 2010s music perfectly.

**imasalesman** (1): ew

**Leixander** (1): somehow combines the worst quirks of music in 2012 in one song, that's remarkable

**outsideeyess** (1): this drop is so jarring

**simplyterific** (1): this was horrible

**Awkward\_King** (0): ludacris only having one song here feels wrong but also im giving it a 0 so idk why im kicking up a fuss

**catjoon** (0): feel like this could be sung at a white Christian church

**fadedblue09** (0): Apologies to king Usher but this is a David Guetta hate account. Also this is highkey unlistenable.

**seanderlust** (0): I was gonna 0 the chris brown song but this is legitimately one of the worst songs i've ever heard

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Biebs Kinda Served I Have To Admit

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Cause When We That And We Power We Tower

**jman457** (8.3): Probably Would Have Scored Higher If It Was Like A Minute Shorter

**outsideeyess** (8.3): Beautiful Hook

**nyoom** (8): daft punk with their fingers on the button and their lawyers' number on the screen: come on come on just one more line

**skargardin** (8): This Does Slap

**xavieryes** (8): Forming A Conclusive Opinion On This Was Tough But Fine Have An 8

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I Know This Will Probably Be A Bottom 5 Song In The Rate, But It’s Not Terrible Outside Will.i.am’s Lyrics And Just His Part In General. The Production Is Good And Justin’s Chorus Works.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This Bops Yall Are So Close Minded

**jasannn** (7): This Aged Better Than I Thought It Would

**jaztinax** (7): I Feel Like I’m The Only One Who Likes This Song, But The Chorus Is The Big Savior Here

**Leixander** (7): Unrelated To This Song, But T.H.E. Deserved To Be Here Just For The Comments Section Tbh

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): It’s So Bad It’s Good, Probably The Most Mediocre Song To Have Interpolated Daft Punk But Also The Beat Bangs And I’m A Will.i.am Apologist

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): Justin Carries This

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , Meh.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I Wish Fall Down, A Much Better Track With A Main Pop Girl, Got The Attention This One Got.

**imasalesman** (6): The Chorus Was Good But The Will.iam Parts Are Painful

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): any will.i.am song that isnt big and chunky was made only to hurt me

**celladonn** (5): #ThatWEAKNESS

**rslashpoopheads** (5): This Is The #Power Billie Was Talking About

**timothy444** (5): I can't believe Justin Bieber is the good part of the song.

**GARjuna** (4): The Beat Is Fine But Bieber Is Something

**bulforster** (3.5): The Rest Is Fine But That First Rap Verse Has Got To Be The Worst In The Rate.

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Literally Every William Song Would Be Better If He Just Wasn't On Them

**caseyfla** (3): Ew, A Hashtag.

**cherryices** (3): Reading The Youtube Comments And 9/10 Of Them Are “Back When Music Was Good 😔”

**CrimsonROSET** (3): This Is A Akanewasright Call Out Post

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): This Is Such A Mess, But I Think The Reason I Dislike Both Of The Will.i.am Songs In This Rate So Much Is They're Just Completely Soulless To Me?

**plastichaxan** (3): Not As Terrible As It Could Be

**catjoon** (2): Felt Like No One Involved In This Tried

**jsonphile** (2): The Bieber Chorus Is Fine But This Beat Is So Monotonous And Will.i.am Is Barely Even Trying With His Rapping. Why Didn’t We Get Some Actual Black Eyed Peas Songs On Here Which, While Not Necessarily Great, Is At Least A Little Better

**thedoctordances1940** (2): If Justin's Hook Weren't Absolutely Amazing This Would Be An Easy Zero.

**TiltControls** (2): I can't believe that the musical mastermind behind Big and Chunky would produce something like this

**FKJVMMP** (1): Will.i.am. Is The 21st Century’s Greatest Monster.

**izeasklapaucius** (4): There was a period of time when me and my guy friends in middle school watch the music video at least 3 times whenever we had a chance in class. I don't really know why. Even as someone who likes guys the MV doesn't look hot in the slightest way possible. Maybe we thought the "wiggle wiggle" part was funny? IDK it's 13-year-old boy tingz.

**jackisboredtoday** (0): I'm sorry but I've hated this song from the first time I heard it way back in 2012, and it has never gotten better. Its far too big a hit to ignore but I cannot stand it

---

**endcreditouilles** (10): This song is the WAP of 2011

**RandomHypnotica** (10): imagine flinging your penis around with your uncle and making millions of dollars out of it

**runaway3212** (10): this is just a confidence anthem

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I kind of enjoy that this MV is purely about objectification of the men in it. I've always said that a little objectification isn't inherently problematic, the issue is how skewed media is towards objectification of women compared to men

**nyoom** (9.5): hilarifying

**hikkaru** (9): the production slaps so much. idc if the lyrics are what they are

**Leixander** (9): did he lie???

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): SO STUPID. I LOVE IT

**thedoctordances1940** (9): This is a bad song. It's great.

**jman457** (8.6): This song is objectively shit, but its bop and I have so many fun and cringy memories associated with this song

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): their second best song in this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I know this song is objectively bad but like it’s camp okay?!!!?

**akanewasright** (8): This is stupid as fuck and I love it

**rslashpoopheads** (8): icawknic

**simplyterific** (8): I always think about the glee version of this song

**static\_int\_husp** (8): the horniest song ever made by an uncle/cousin pair

**TiltControls** (8): this is a song I would never want to hear on the radio, but at the right times it's amazing

**waluigiest** (8): as bad as it is I just can’t hate it!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.9): This one is sooooo much fun. I remember showing my Christian cousin the music video and she was shook to the core.

**seanderlust** (7.2): you can draw a straight line from LMFAO's success to the "le epic bacon mustache" internet humor from the early 2010s. no i will not elaborate.

**jasannn** (7): bops but cringe

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): my friends and i thought “wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle yeah” was peak humor when it came out

**timothy444** (7): Unlike "Party Rock Anthem", I'm not changing my score on this from the Billboard Decade rate despite how fun this song still is

**catjoon** (6): worse than I remember

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i forgot he goes ‘wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wag’

**jaztinax** (6): i keep waiting for ricky martin to show up and go “soy sexy y lo sabes”

**frogaranaman** (5): it’s alright, guilty pleasure kind of stuff

**rickikardashian** (5): makes me laugh as much as it makes me mad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): this is camp for straight people

**cherryices** (4): i can’t give any higher than this to a song with the line “i got passion in my pants”

**musical\_pyn** (3): there's a moment in the music video when someone rips off their thong to reveal another thong underneath and I think that's the best way to describe LMFAO

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): im ugly and you dont catch me making fucking songs about it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): honestly i just hate this song and the video

**aldwin\_is\_here** (1): , I've heard this song way more than my parents telling me that they actually cared and loved me, disappointingly.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Ignorance is bliss.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): a song that outpeaked Bad Romance

**jsonphile** (1): this isn’t funny. This isn’t entertaining. It’s just uncomfortable to listen to. Anyway stream I Just Had Sex by Lonely Island for a song that’s actually funny and enjoyable to listen to

**moonagenightmares** (1): i know it looks like im sabotaging LMFAO but i promise i genuinely passionately despise all these songs

**skargardin** (1): Even Party Rock Anthem makes me feel more sexy than this atrocity

**steelstepladder** (1): DK Minecart Gif

**1998tweety** (0): i absolutely hated this song as a child and i still hate it now

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): this single entendre makes for out first Flo Rida exit during the rate, and honestly I can't say this isn't deserved. The production is nice even if its surprisingly midtempo for Flo Rida, but the rest of the song isn't quite it.

---

**FKJVMMP** (11): True story, I lost my virginity to this song. On purpose. It remains one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. My life is a mess.

**TChalla1966** (10): for the hottest of minutes my innocent mind thought he was actually trying to show us how to whistle but anyway thanks for lessons flo x

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): The Dalton Academy Warblers outsold, though.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I wish I could.

**endcreditouilles** (9): finally, a song with step by step instructions on how to give really weird head

**runaway3212** (9): you know what? i think this is a like a peak of rap pop. The way it's so catchy nobody noticed the lyrics at first.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): it's kinda uncomfortable how much my dad loves this song but look the chorus is catchy af

**thedoctordances1940** (9): I hate whistling in songs. This is still a 9 anyway.

**1998tweety** (8.5): iconic mom bop

**celladonn** (8): The way this has the same guitar line as this song from Silent Hill 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qalGezr76o

**jman457** (8): Sure it hasn't aged the best but I find it so funny how it had soccer moms in a sexless marriage all over the US singing about getting head. DAE Flo Rida queer icon?

**moooo566** (8): this is a really stupid song but its also extremely catchy which is my main rating criteria

**plastichaxan** (7.5): to quote oomf “that’s not even how you do a blowjob”

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): could anybody but Flo Rida get your grandma to sing about a blowjob?

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): not even trying to hide he’s singing about getting head

**ignitethephoenix** (7): never forget when this was sung on Glee by an all male school / acepella group

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i really associate this song with the billboard classic youtube channel and we are never ever getting back together, for no reason other than they were in the top 10 a lot when i would watch that channel

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): I will never not be annoyed by how bad the whistle/bj metaphor is

**TiltControls** (7): we need more innocent and completely free of hidden sexual content songs like this!

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): funnily enough this song would be good without the whistle

**outsideeyess** (6.5): he's way too old to be teaching someone how to perform a blowjob. is that why people hate this song? tramar's talent was wasted on this pedo jam

**seanderlust** (6.5): .......he's talking about blowjobs isn't he.

**DaHumanTorch** (6): i can't believe we as a society really let a song about someone sucking flo rida's panhandle become a hit

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): i remember hating this song so much when it came out. i don’t hate it anymore but it still doesn’t hit the same as his other songs

**static\_int\_husp** (6): soccer moms loved playing songs with incredibly thinly vieled metaphors about oral sex in the car with their kids

**catjoon** (5): not for me

**Hulnia** (5): Funny song, not a good one though. 🥱

**nyoom** (5): finally a nice and wholesome song to play at my christian potluck breakfast at 7am this coming sabbath day :) and darlene if you bring your "vegan hot dogs" again we will be having words, mine is a house of oscar mayer and you will NOT make it a den of leaves

**rickikardashian** (5): the instructions in this song are just going to result in an awful blowjob

**teenwitches** (5): it's just a bunch of lame blowjob euphemisms for nearly 4 minutes

**timothy444** (5): "Really conflicted here. On one hand, the double entendre of innocent whistles and BJs is just plain dumb and just gets on my nerves, especially with the verses that make as much sense as the lyrics to Astronaut in the Ocean. But also, Flo Rida knows exactly what he's doing and no matter how stupid the song topic is, he always manages to conjure up an incredibly catch melody and he knows that it's just a simple fun catchy pop song. This isn't a lyrical masterpiece like ""Some Nights"" by fun. or whatever but it's still a bop. Also, this song haunted my childhood so really all you made me do is write a whole paragraph on a ""5""."

**waluigiest** (5): sometimes I want something subtle

**hikkaru** (4): succ

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Blackpink really outsold.

**cherryices** (3): i’ve never liked whistling in pop music!!

**jsonphile** (3): no I do not want to blow your whistle you weirdo

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): the glee version still has me traumatised, wtf was Hunter Clarington on

**GARjuna** (2): these lyrics hurt me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2): this is unsexy but he knew what he was doing with the whistle hook

**akanewasright** (1): :/

**awhile2** (1): its not enjoyable hearing your 6 year old cousins unknowingly sing about oral sex no thank you

**frogaranaman** (1): that’s not even how you suck dick

**Leixander** (1): wish i could give a second 0 to this

**moonagenightmares** (1): this song has no saving grace

**musical\_pyn** (1): do I need to explain myself

**CrimsonROSET** (0): when he says ‘i’m gonna show you how you do it’ is he implying autofellatio because we love flexibility

**jaztinax** (0): i hated this song, then glee ruined it even more

**simplyterific** (0): words cannot describe how much I despise this song, mainly because I’ll never forget this guy at my school trying to explain the sexual innuendo to me like it was the most poetic thing in the world. Fuck this song

**skargardin** (0): I have only bad assoications with this song. Basically a group of kids would sing along and play this out loud on their phone speakers every single day on the school bus rides which led me to hate this song to my guts to this very day. fuck this song

**izeasklapaucius** (7): What are you guys' favorite Men in Black scene? Mine is the simple tests one from the first movie.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): one of the only songs Pitbull released without a feature after the first two pop singles he put out at the end of the 00s, the lack of a guest does make for a weaker hook on this, and above all this has the most out of place dubstep break this side of I Knew You Were Trouble.

---

**endcreditouilles** (10): this may be controversial but the beat drop in this is the sickest thing to ever come out of 2012, yes i'm including carly rae jepsen, no i will NOT be taking questions

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is the greatest song ever recorded next to My house by flo rida

**runaway3212** (10): I wish every pitbull song was like this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): number two (on the rate)

**plastichaxan** (9): this could’ve easily been in the hispanic art pop rate

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Time for a lazy joke: this song makes me wanna go back in time. For real, I miss my old taste in music sometimes.

**cremeebrulee** (8): how apt of this song to be named this bc this will instantly take me back to a high school cafeteria dance

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): kind of dumb and the outro is a bit messy but this is really fun!

**moonagenightmares** (8): that sample is so good

**simplyterific** (7.5): I dont like it as much as I did when it came out but its still a bop and surprisingly uncorny for a song made for a MIB movie

**TiltControls** (7.5): cheesy movie tie in songs are underrated

**GARjuna** (7): kinda dig it??

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i genuinely don't know if I've heard this song before or not

**timothy444** (7): Decent

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): “you know I don’t give a number two” need to add this to my vocabulary lmao. As for the song, the sample is interesting but this is constructed kind of messily

**bigbigbee** (6.5): "I don't give a number 2" I've been there. try eating cheese

**jaztinax** (6.5): pitbull was starting to lose his momentum after this release tbh but it’s still catchy

**musical\_pyn** (6): pitbull is really just saying things at this point isn't he

**waluigiest** (6): it could be good but it’s just too specific to men in black lmao

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this bangs but also wait nvm i got distracted while writing my comment and now im two songs later and i have forgotten it but im sure i was right and it bangs

**hikkaru** (5.5): never loved this one tbh

**jman457** (5.3): Im so glad this song stayed in 2013 but it still has some fun lines

**1998tweety** (5): meh

**akanewasright** (5): I don’t even know what to say about this song

**cherryices** (5): the electronic break near the end can get to fuck

**ImADudeDuh** (5): ok i can’t defend this song

**skargardin** (5): i go back and forth between deciding if this is genius or a travesty

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): this song never did much for me

**teenwitches** (5): the sample is totally wasted on this one

**thedoctordances1940** (5): Naur

**TragicKingdom1** (5): pretty repetitive but i kinda like the hook

**DaHumanTorch** (4.3): this song is kinda sorta really bad i remember it being much better

**catjoon** (4): I like the use of the sample, and that’s pretty much all I like about this song

**frogaranaman** (4): it’s honestly just boring

**nyoom** (4): After Wal-Mart promised to send Pitbull to the store that got the most "likes" during a marketing contest on its Facebook page, the rapper's haters organized a viral campaign to send him to the most remote Wal-Mart possible using the hashtag #exilepitbull. #exilepitbull

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3.5): I want to support Mr. Spacetimecontinuumwide but the instrumental is so god damn annoying

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): oh god not a reminder of the dubstep era in the bridge

**FKJVMMP** (3): If there’s a single song on this list I’d love to be a fly on the wall for the creation of, it’s this one. How? Why?

**kirby31200** (3): Just about as bad as Men In Black 3

**outsideeyess** (3): sorry pit, i'm not feelin the songs from this album. this feels so undercooked. I remembered it being kinda cool but nah.

**static\_int\_husp** (3): okay yeah very little about this works. That sample is a completely different vibe from the rest of the song, it's a theme song for a bad movie, the dubsetp breakdown at the end comes out of nowehere

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): Pitbull and sound track songs with weird samples, name a more iconic duo

**astrologicalangel** (2): I want this to be so bad it's good, but it's just bad

**bulforster** (2): That really short two-tone sample loop being most of the verse instrumental gets grating real fast.

**fadedblue09** (1): Who listens to a Pitbull song with no features [2]

**rslashpoopheads** (1): I'd like to go Back In Time before I heard this trainwreck.

**steelstepladder** (1): The herky jerky sample, the mismatched verses, the dubstep breakdown... wow this is straight ass

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): Even back then I thought this was the randomest collab ever lmao. It's good though, would be neat if she picks it up again for the Red re-recording.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): Even as someone who loves almost every B.o.B single in this rate, I have to say this is imo, the weakest song of his here. Honestly very fine with this leaving day 1, though I can't tell if that's in spite of or because of Taylor's presence on this hook

---

**endcreditouilles** (10): i hope she can lift both of them now

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Such an underrated song. This was supposed to be my 11, but J. Cole is here, and I won't lose the opportunity to give him my 11.

**moooo566** (10): sorry but im a swiftie

**runaway3212** (10): haha imagine giving a song a 10 just cause Taylor Swift is on it, haha

**TiltControls** (10): I love this song, but I also love seeing swifties suffer so I hope it flops

**timothy444** (10): Unironically amazing and that's not because of Taylor Swift in the chorus. The fusion between country and urban type beats just works so well which fits the lyrical content of this song

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): this is so random, I never knew she had a song with him

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the way I wanted to dislike this but it’s pretty good

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , cuz' it's Taylor Swift duh!

**bulforster** (8): I swear we were promised a stale topic free cycle this go round.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this remains in the top 20% of taylor's discography

**jman457** (7.7): Both of us walked so I knew your trouble could run

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): cute but Taylor Swift is an odd fit here

**1998tweety** (7.5): taylor carries

**jasannn** (7.5): Tayola worked.

**awhile2** (7): could you imagine if taylor did the hook on a b-list rappers song nowadays? shit would be iconic

**CrimsonROSET** (7): no i think that’s a therapist’s job

**jaztinax** (7): “so maybe one day, WEEAHKOOBAW!”

**Roxieloxie** (7): i have to tank this for taylor, im sorry

**waluigiest** (7): no part of this song is bad but it’s kind of just thrown together

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): wonder if taylor just looks back at this and is just like "the hell was i doing with this flat earther"

**emayzee** (6.7): sorry swifties

**martian\_pet** (6.5): Bizarre

**hikkaru** (6): the fact that this exists will never not be funny to me. i just wish it was better

**jsonphile** (6): I honestly forgot this song existed it just seems so strange to me. I like B.O.B., and like any good pophead I love Taylor Swift, but they don’t exactly go together too well

**musical\_pyn** (6): Both of Us (Taylor's Version) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjmzkMxkDOA

**nyoom** (6): wow i love chvrches, death stranding was a great game

**rickikardashian** (6): listening to this playlist shuffle and hearing taylor’s voice was a jumpscare

**slimboyfriend** (6): sorry to be a rabid swiftie but her chorus really carries this song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): wins for the most random taylor collab ever but it's just a knock off of airplanes

**thedoctordances1940** (6): It's a terrible idea on paper, but the execution is actually alright

**bigbigbee** (5.5): The chorus is so plodding? Simple and not in a good way. I like the vocal bridge though.

**outsideeyess** (5.5): tell me how/why tf taylor made it into the male pop-rap rate. popheads, relax

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Taylor is unnecessary here.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): i had literally no idea this existed

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4.5): this TS chorus sounds like an entirely different song

**moonagenightmares** (4): sounds like 2 entirely different songs stitched together

**simplyterific** (4): the switch between his verse to Taylor singing is so odd

**steelstepladder** (4): Even when we're not rating Taylor, we end up rating Taylor

**akanewasright** (3): This isn’t baaaaaad persay, but… it is kinda bad actually. B.o.B and Taylor clearly got very different assignments, and while the last chorus is okay, the other two are weak as hell. The chorus… it feels like a decent prechorus or something, it doesn’t work here. If this survives day 1 or even the bottom 10, the Swifties are out of control.

**Awkward\_King** (3): if this song was a person it would be ugly

**DaHumanTorch** (3): not even taylor could save this horrendous song

**frogaranaman** (3): just kind of doesn’t work too well

**plastichaxan** (3): this feels like a rave.dj mashup

**teenwitches** (3): just a weak attempt at recreating airplanes with a super lame hook

**cremeebrulee** (2): noooo who set her up like this

**FKJVMMP** (2): TIL you can connect Taylor Swift and Lil Wayne with one degree of separation.

**rslashpoopheads** (2): who greenlit this mess

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): this score is an average between a 10 for Taylor’s presence, a -2 for B.o.B’s presence, and a -2 for the song just being awful

**GARjuna** (1): this is hurtful

**nootnoot781** (1): i don’t know why this song fills me with rage, but it does.

**xavieryes** (1): wtf is this collab

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): This honestly outlasted what I thought it would do given that its a rapper doing what is functionally a country single, but I always thought this one was dopey and not super charming even with the double entendre at the song's core

**izeasklapaucius** (4): I just don't really like Nelly's songs :(

# supercar

**Roxieloxie** (10): i absolutely despise this

**timothy444** (9.5): Such an amazingly hilarious song where the listener can't tell if he's rapping and singing about a car, pony or girl. Who cares, it's a bop!

**seanderlust** (9): this is a bop! surprised it didn't do better in the US. fun, summery, very early 2010s but standably so.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this song unironically bops so hard

**celladonn** (8.5): We don't talk about this carfucking anthem nearly enough

**akanewasright** (7): This is stupid as fuck but it’s upbeat and I’m bopping a little

**bigbigbee** (7): God dammit why do I like this

**frogaranaman** (7): naming your album after Missouri’s initials? Saint Louis KING

**GARjuna** (7): serviceable!

**musical\_pyn** (7): sometimes I'll sing "hey there bestie" to the tune of the chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I'm more of a Ferrari man myself.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): Porsches just look like a VW Beetle that's been stepped on by a giant to me, so calling someone a Porsche is an insult in my book

**rickikardashian** (6): this sounds like a country song turned rap pop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): kalia in big brother 13 after dani was evicted

# an audio car crash

**outsideeyess** (5.3): i predicted exactly what year this came out based on the production

**FKJVMMP** (5): One day artists will find out that women are not in fact cars. One day...

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): is this a carfucker anthem?

**slimboyfriend** (5): I see we've reached the Florida Georgia Line

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.5): this is just bro-country, and better than most songs in that genre but I still don’t enjoy it

**jman457** (4.2): It has all the ingredients of being a good song but it just feels like nothing

**CrimsonROSET** (4): no this is just dumb lmao

**DaHumanTorch** (3.5): the quality dip between just a dream and this

**jasannn** (3): I don't get why porsche is sometimes pronounced "portia"

**static\_int\_husp** (3): somehow half of country radio now sounds like this song

**CreepyMannequin** (2): this sounds so bad that I thought it was a New Boyz song

**jsonphile** (2): is he...comparing his girl to a car? Or does he want to fuck a car? Anyway Queen already did sexy cars better with I’m in love with my car, and that song was stupid too

**kirby31200** (2): > "Anyway, the song is terrible. It could have been sung by Taylor Swift and it would sound exactly the same. And, that is why it’s also amazing. Seriously, I listened to it ten times last night. As I awoke this morning, I remembered that this song was waiting downstairs on my computer, ready to be gifted to my ears all over again. I couldn’t wait to get out of the sheets to listen. Nelly, you gave purpose to today." - VICE

**steelstepladder** (2): Maybe Cruise wasn't that bad

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Dumb question because I can't believe this is real: is he comparing a girl to a car? I knew this song only by the title and presumed it was about an actual car. Glad I never listened to it up til now.

**jaztinax** (1): i make it a habit to not rate songs this low because very few songs are really that bad but… this is BAD

**moonagenightmares** (1): sounds like something you would only release in desperation at the end of your career

**teenwitches** (0): just pure unadulterated garbage with cheap production and asinine lyrics

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): We're back to: Songs I played to hell and back in middle school. Sure this isn't the fire-spitting Wayne that his best songs are known for, and some of the lyrics are a little r/im14andthisisdeep but what can I say, I loved this when I was 14 and I consequently will have a soft spot for it forever

**izeasklapaucius** (8): I don't know why this was placed so low. The apocalyptic choir and Bruno's vocal performance really set the stage for Wayne's verses.

---
# Through my rise
**pleasegivemeasword** (11): it’s just sentimental idk what else to say

**jaztinax** (9.5): this song is sooo pretty. also bruno mars killing it as ALWAYS

**timothy444** (9.5): Lil Wayne's only good commerically successful song. This just sounds really deep and sad with lots of emotion packed in.

**1998tweety** (9): cute

**jman457** (8.6): I hate the trend of Bruno Mars featuring on every rappers albums from 2010-2012, because it actually worked.

**hostsmom** (8.5): not usually a Lil Wayne fan but this one is actually sweet

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): the whiplash of this introspective moment after Where Them Girls At on the playlist… that was certainly a change of pace

**jsonphile** (7.5): of all the Lil Wayne songs this seems an odd choice, although I guess a lot of other songs would be just rap rather than pop rap, or just a pop song featuring a rap verse. But it’s nice to hear him be a little more serious, and he pulls it off nicely here

**runaway3212** (7.3): a bit corny

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , not my favorite from him.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): it’s okay it’s definitely a song

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): There's definitely some interesting things going on here, better than most of what i've heard of lil wayne at least, but it's still not great.

**seanderlust** (6.3): bruno mars was getting them COINS in the early 2010s. good for him

# and fall
**cremeebrulee** (6): oh yall on good terms w your mirror?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): mirror mirror on the wall which bruno feature is the blandest of them all

**Roxieloxie** (5): ITS LIKE YOUR MY MIRROR, OHOH, MY MIRROR STARING BACK AT ME OHOH

**simplyterific** (5): I kind of miss the era where Bruno would just show up in his fedora to sing a chorus

**slimboyfriend** (5): I was like "when is lil wayne gonna start rapping" and Bruno Mars immediately BURST to a 10 from out of nowhere

**DaHumanTorch** (4.8): why were all of bruno mars' early features on these pop rap songs so bad

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): this song has the energy of a good song but it is bad

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): these two should have been an explosive combo but this is boring (no i don't have balladphobia bruno can do much better)

**TiltControls** (4): this just bums me out

**nyoom** (3): sorry, i'm cute and have friends and can't relate

**rickikardashian** (3): this refused to end

**steelstepladder** (3): Wow, Bruno Mars choruses are really losing today

**frogaranaman** (2): this track is a bore sorry Lil Wayne

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this sounds like an album track from a shit 2010s movie soundtrack starring Ryan Reynolds before people liked him

**moonagenightmares** (2): corny

**rslashpoopheads** (2): this is very emo middle schooler and not in a good way like Bring Me To Life

---
 # Ms.Red Carpet

**skargardin** (10): I truly hate how nostalgic this makes me feel

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): what an amazing crossover

**RandomHypnotica** (9): I confused this song with Guy Sebsatian's "Who's That Girl" in my head and was a little dissapointed when i heard this again, but it's still a bop

**1998tweety** (8): cute bop

**outsideeyess** (7.7): never heard this song but Who's That's Chick outsold. neverless was grooving by the end

**nyoom** (7.5): whoever she is, she is not main pop girl

**endcreditouilles** (7): who dat girl? who dat girl? who dat girl? it's jess!

**frogaranaman** (7): just now getting that this is a porn star reference

**teenwitches** (7): oh hey this is that song from parks and rec

**timothy444** (7): I like the chiptune infused beats in this but other than that, there's nothing that stands out from making it a genuine Flo Rida banger

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Dangerous outsold

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): holy fuck i completely forgot this song ever existed also I only ever heard it at really loud parties so I just learned that the line is "but she got groupies" not "but she got boobies"

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): The chorus is decent but it's one of the less remarkable singles of his

**CrimsonROSET** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9hXLd1vsag

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): This is camp

# he ain't no rockstar

**TiltControls** (6): this is just fine

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): As weird as this may sound, I actually prefer the verses over the chorus. Akon does a disservice to this song.

**jaztinax** (5): is this song about porn stars?

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): kind of boring

**musical\_pyn** (5): if I had a nickel for everytime I misheard the word "groupies" as "boobies" in a song I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice

**jman457** (4.6): this could have been such a summer bop, but you could tell that Flo was on a creative rut with this project.

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i hate this but i feel safe while i listen to it

**bigbigbee** (4.5): When did songs stop referring to "groupies"?

**bulforster** (4.5): This is quite bad but I can't bring myself to truly hate it after its use in the snake juice episode of parks and rec.

**jasannn** (4.5): Flo Rida's only true dud here.

**\_SoulGlitch** (4): hmmm….

**catjoon** (4): this feels like it was originally a country song

**GARjuna** (4): rancid

**jsonphile** (4): so on YouTube, all the comments are about how this was used for three seconds in a now iconic parks and rec clip with Ron Swanson dancing drunk. And that makes sense, because there’s literally no other reason anyone would ever go back and listen to this song. Unlike other Flo Rida songs, it doesn’t really have a catchy hook, or good production, and just like all other Flo Rida songs, the rapping is boring and forgettable.

**simplyterific** (4): so this was the song from parks and rec

**ImADudeDuh** (3): oh akon is not good here

**runaway3212** (2.5): this is messy and bad, the production sucks and god some of the lyrics are terrible

**FKJVMMP** (2): Was he trying to land a spot on an N64 game soundtrack? Akon is terrible btw.

**plastichaxan** (2): maam this was nothing

**moonagenightmares** (1): akon’s voice is unbearable

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): New Boyz are the first artist with multiple songs in this rate to be entirely eliminated, but honestly this song is kinda fun. Sure, its for reasons that have far more to do with Dev than lines like "I heard you had a baby, you want a new boy in you," but it sure is The Cataracs

---

**akanewasright** (10): I… I heard this song on the radio when I was like 9 and never heard it again. This isn’t worth a 10 but like… I’m just astonished that I found this song after all these years

**Awkward\_King** (10): everything dev touches is magic huh

**cremeebrulee** (10): slay down boots or whatever hikk says

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): :donubop:

**seanderlust** (10): a bop, a banger, an energetic barnburner. yes.

**waluigiest** (10): dev and the cataracs put their whole body into everything they touched

**hikkaru** (9): i'm a dev stan actually

**outsideeyess** (8): my favourite hobbies include hiking, long walks on the beach, and trying to perfect "i-i-it's the cataracs"

**thedoctordances1940** (8): This bops

**IIIHenryIII** (7.7): That's a banger! I thank DEV.

**jman457** (7.7): Its a stupid song but a jam

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): it's physically impossible to listen to a song by Dev & The Cataracs without instinctively throwing it back

**astrologicalangel** (7): this is so cheesy and yet so catchy

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this definitely is a very a stereotypical 2011 party track but it does bop I’ll give it that

**kirby31200** (7): The ultimate guilty pleasure

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): Dev makes this song

**nootnoot781** (6): not sure why i don’t hate this…

**nyoom** (5.5): why isn't this bass down low??

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this gives me big sweet dreams vibes for some reason but this song wishes

**simplyterific** (4): I wish I never heard this song

**TragicKingdom1** (3): the new boyz are so douchey oml

**CreepyMannequin** (2): I threw up a little at “I heard you had a baby, you ant a new boy in you?” who thought that was okay

**runaway3212** (2): oh some of these lines are too much for me

**TiltControls** (2): I'm not a huge Dev fan, but even ignoring that I really don't like this song

**FKJVMMP** (1): New Boyz are the reason Ariana Grande hates America. Thank god these useless morons didn’t catch on internationally.

**jsonphile** (1): were the New Boyz always this bad?? I don’t remember them that well from the early 2010s but wow both of their songs are awful. Also I don’t really like Dev but she’s the best part of both songs she’s on in this playlist

**steelstepladder** (1): New Boys are so bad how did none of us realize lmfao

**teenwitches** (1): this probably already sounded dated when it came out

**timothy444** (0): Why is this song even in the rate? It didn't even make the Top 25 in any main chart and it was already outdated a year after its release.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): A song I fully associate with its appearances in the 2009 smash hit cinematic experience G-Force, Nelly Furtado's hook here is a huge bop. I don't feel like this was a robbery or anything, but this *is* one of the Flo Rida songs I come back to

**izeasklapaucius** (6): G when it's force idk i haven't watched the movie since eleven years ago

---

**jaztinax** (11): sorry this is the best flo-rida song—i don’t make the rules. it hits from the start and it only gets better with each part of the song, PARTICULARLY the little breakdown of the 2nd pre-chorus or 2nd part of 2nd verse oh my GOD!! also my 7th grade girl friends made the most LIT choreo to this and we performed it and i swear i was at my dancing peak then. i wish y’all were there to see it

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the best song i have ever heard. wait gimme one more listen i might hate it. omg ok i dont !!!! yass, best song ever made

**outsideeyess** (10): ok so now i have full choreography for this song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Why does the digital Nelly in the video look like a random GTA Pedestrian

**xavieryes** (10): underrated banger. also it has Nelly Furtado on it so it's perfect by default

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): banger! Nelly’s collaborations hardly ever miss

**musical\_pyn** (9): I really don't understand how this song is so good but I'm grateful anyways

**plastichaxan** (9): i did jump cause this is hyperpop

**awhile2** (8): only reason i know this song is the g-force movie. iconic

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i miss silly rap like this that just goes ‘i’m gonna talk about things that fly for three minutes’ and commits to it

**frogaranaman** (8): this is honestly such an underrated banger

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): the way i forgot this song existed omg. fantastic chorus

**timothy444** (8): Underrated

**endcreditouilles** (7.6): body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody insane

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): we love the theme song to G-Force (2009). also why does travis barker have a writing credit on this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this should have been a hit but I also get why it wasn’t. Nelly furtado was kind of wasted here

**jman457** (7.3): Im like A BIRD, I only fly away….

**1998tweety** (7): I didn't really hear this as a child so I don't have the nostalgia to boost my score

**runaway3212** (7): this has more energy than the song probably deserves but that is what makes it good

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's a bit atypical for Flo Rida's usually very high energy songs and I think that's why I find it suffers in comparison to the rest of his songs.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): Nelly Furtado deserved better

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): Didn’t really care for this one

**akanewasright** (6): Rihanna outsold

**catjoon** (6): listened to this song and nothing about retained in my mind, kinda would expect more with nelly on the track

**skargardin** (6): i don't particularly care for this

**seanderlust** (5.9): how's he gonna rhyme "high" with "astronaut"???

**steelstepladder** (5.7): I feel like this chorus SHOULD be good... why does it feel so monotonous?

**bulforster** (5.5): Why is the hook so monotone??

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): omg I forgot this song even existed. It was locked away in my preteen memories

**jsonphile** (5): Nelly Furtado deserves better than this

**TiltControls** (5): c'mon Nelly (F.) you can do better than that

**Leixander** (4): the cgi nelly in the video is haunting

**simplyterific** (4): can you believe g-force is a real movie

**IIIHenryIII** (3.5): Was this a single? It's pretty clear why it wasn't a hit if the answer to my question is yes.

**cremeebrulee** (3): wow i have not heard this since 7th grade, wish i had kept it that way

**FKJVMMP** (3): This sounds like somebody who’s never seen a computer before trying to make a Timbaland song.

**nyoom** (3): i was vibing until the vocals kicked in and now i'm sampling this on my album "R.O.O.T.S. Route of Overcoming the Struggle" as an example of what i had to deal with

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): This was hurt badly by being a slow song in a rate largely dominated by much more clubby music, and Jay's bars aren't his greatest on here, but this song does well as capturing a certain wistfulness that I enjoy.

---
# forever young

**musical\_pyn** (10): those synths make this really stand out from the rest of the rate and also Jay-Z sounds really great here

**runaway3212** (10): At this moment in time Kanye's production could literally not do wrong

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): i used to be obsessed w this song when i was younger

**waluigiest** (10): I think I saw Mr. Hudson on snl or something and I had a huuuuge crush on him

**jman457** (9.3): I know that Jay-z fans dont really like this album but like look at the material, nothing but classics

**moooo566** (8): feels carried a bit by

**seanderlust** (8): this song got me thinking about mortality in the club right now

**TiltControls** (8): my love for this song is mostly just with the sample tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s nice but a bit boring

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I like it, but begrudgingly. The sample feels low-effort, even for this rate.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): For some reason the only thing I think of when hearing that sample is the axis of awesome's four chords song 😭

**1998tweety** (7): BTS is shaking

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , oooh.

**Roxieloxie** (7): jayz wants to be 1d so bad

**rslashpoopheads** (7): cute

**kirby31200** (6.5): I like how Jay's first lyric is him plainly stating the moral of the song, it saves you from having to listen to the rest

**outsideeyess** (6.5): so overplayed

**akanewasright** (6): there’s nothing here, energy wise

**CrimsonROSET** (6): who looked at forever young and thought ‘this song is missing a rap verse’

**FKJVMMP** (6): There’s enough mediocre rock covers of this song, we didn’t need a rap interpolation too. It is good though.

**hikkaru** (6): the synths are so nostalgic, other than that i fear it's not my fave but it's not bad

**moonagenightmares** (6): i once cried to the original song this samples and jay-z just goes and ruins it. a crime

# isn't jay-z super old now???

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is kinda boring tbh

**timothy444** (4.5): You would think they would put better effort into this…

**bulforster** (4): That drum beat going 4x faster than everything else feels so out of place.

**jaztinax** (4): i don’t like the original and i don’t like this either

**plastichaxan** (4): zzzz

**steelstepladder** (4): Ahhhh this does nothing for me

**IIIHenryIII** (3.5): Zzzzzzzzz… oh, the song ended?

**Awkward\_King** (3): this isnt the only rate where i will have a score as a 9 and then something will flick in my brain and i'll go nvm this is a 3, but it is the only rate where it is acceptable to do so

**nyoom** (2.5): it's funny because this song makes me want to die immediately

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2): I didn’t come to Jay-Z for a flavourless Alphaville cover

**simplyterific** (2): the live version with Beyoncé is more tolerable

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): omg i hate this song so much

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1.5): this is boring lol

**rickikardashian** (1): this is insufferable

**frogaranaman** (0): always fucking hated this release. I HATE how melancholy it is and how fucking annoying the chorus is sung. idk this is just a downright shit song I fucking hate it fuck you mister Jason Z

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): This is one of the few songs here I think would have done better on /hhh than here, since its very much a song with more of a "real rap" tone to it. I do think its actually pretty fantastic though, with both rappers actually going in on the track and the least awkward use of dubstep trends of anything here. I get why its gone, but this one feels like a bit of a robbery to me

**izeasklapaucius** (7): hears blown-out 808s Getting a lot of Dorian Electra vibes from this one.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): i think i might form a parasocial relationship with lil wayne

**CreepyMannequin** (10): this slaps and has a lot of great lines from both artists

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is hyperpop

**Hulnia** (10): This is gonna get robbed so hard, but it deserves Day 3 at least.

**Leixander** (10): this beat SLAPS idc idc

**seanderlust** (10): this one goes OFF! how did I miss this song during this era?

**waluigiest** (10): literally NO reason this had to go so hard

**outsideeyess** (9.3): the production >>>>>>

**jman457** (8.8): It was the start of his Qanon journey but it's actually kind of a serve.

**bulforster** (8.5): The verses go in so hard the chorus is a bit of a letdown.

**steelstepladder** (8.3): B.o.B. is probably the best technical rapper of the big three. I'm not here for good technical skills but I guess it's appreciated.

**akanewasright** (8): This slaps.

**FKJVMMP** (8): I’m gonna hit her with that pipe, call it Nancy Kerrigan. Normally you only get those kinds of timely and topical references from Wayne, good to see the other guy kept up.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): wait this goes off

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): wish i had known about this song in 2010 because i would have been obsessed

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Don't usually like Lil Wayne that much but he works here

**timothy444** (8): Goes way hard!

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): lil wayne calm down!!! nobody wants their pussy jackknifed!!

**hikkaru** (7): that one synth through the verses is kinda hard asf tbqh

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**CrimsonROSET** (6): wait they smoke weed?

**frogaranaman** (6): “[keep your mind] on my lyrics” literally what are you going to be saying of substance B.o.B

**emayzee** (5.6): why is this song so much more jarring than i remember it being

**ImADudeDuh** (5): eh

**runaway3212** (5): meh

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): A NANCY KERRIGAN REFERENCE OMG

**bigbigbee** (4): Based on my eating habits, I probably am, at least partially, Top Ramen

**catjoon** (4): beat kinda giving me a headache

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This one is a hard pass.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): wow this sure is a song from 2012!

**simplyterific** (4): yeah this song was not for me but im sure there’s someone out there who thinks this is hard

**teenwitches** (4): not even a lil wayne feature can save this

**GARjuna** (3): also slow!! beat is fun though

**jasannn** (3): The production doing some heavy lifting.

**jaztinax** (2): it’s a no from me

**steelstepladder** (10): I didn't expect Wiz to sweep like this for me but damn all his songs in this rate are fantastic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this deserved the success black and yellow had

**runaway3212** (9): This bangs

**TiltControls** (9): I think I really underrated Wiz Khalifa's efforts in the area cause these have all been bops, especially this one!

**seanderlust** (8.5): it's giving reblogging kushandwizdom.tumblr.com teas

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , ever heard of this obscure disorder known as I N S O M N I A

**CrimsonROSET** (7): me finishing this rate at 9am

**ImADudeDuh** (7): friendly reminder that Wiz Khalifa was on the masked singer this season. And, as someone who frequents the masked singer subreddit, there was legitimately “Chameleon mask stans” that had to make posts telling people to stop being so negative and toxic against him on the sub because he made it to the top 3 when most people agreed he should’ve gone out at around 7th place

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Rate regulars begging TK to not submit *that charity song* to AS5.

**frogaranaman** (6): god the melody on this is so goddamn fine men would objectify it

**jsonphile** (6): not sure why this was chosen instead of Black and Yellow which I felt was a much bigger hit compared to this

**nyoom** (6): and yet i sleep https://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1056 https://qwantz.com/fanart/PartyPartyPartyHard.m4a

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Getting No Sleep? Listen to this song and you'll be gone in 5 seconds!

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this is just too laid back for a party song, just very forgettable and boring. Songs in this rate should not be forgettable and boring

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this shit is too real

**simplyterific** (4.3): I feel like I would like this song a lot more if I was a 12 year old straight boy

**FKJVMMP** (4): Why does he always sound like such a nerd. Rap scene version of that one person in every big friend group that nobody’s actually friends with but they let him tag along anyway because they know he doesn’t have anybody else.

**GARjuna** (4): sorry I don't think I care for this guy

**timothy444** (2.5): Marshmello levels of mediocrity

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Never heard this one. Could've gone on that way.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): a cute little single from Wiz, its low-key and nice with some great sticky synths on the production. While I like it I think it suffered from not banging quite as hard as a lot of songs in this rate

---

**steelstepladder** (11): I came back to this song over a year ago for a rate interlude I wanted to use and I just kept coming back to it in a way I did not expect to. One of the most perfect pool party songs I've ever heard and just makes me want to float on a raft with a cutie. It's so wholesome and fun and bubbly, how can I not love this.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why is this kinda cute

**Hulnia** (9): No comment on any of these, but where on earth is Black and Yellow?

**teenwitches** (9): i miss the swag rap era a little more every day

**runaway3212** (8): the start is rough but after that it gets real great

**slimboyfriend** (8): ok Mr. Khalifa knows how to write a good pop song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.6): for some reason i remembered his singing being better lol

**catjoon** (7.5): simple but I like it

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): this is one of those songs I vaguely remember but can't quite place, and I think that's helping it? Bridge kinda brings it down though

**nyoom** (7.5): my short ass when i buy new jeans

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , yes, I'm high, no, I'm fine

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it feels wrong rating Wiz without Black and Yellow but this'll do

**jsonphile** (6.5): it’s the better version of Treat You Better

**akanewasright** (6): This is cute but not really much more

**Awkward\_King** (6): this is jarring because of how inoffensive it is in a rate full of songs that i think would've called me the f slur in 2011 for shock value

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ‘shawty it is your anniversary’ god was the copyright that bad

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this isn’t black and yellow

**simplyterific** (6): this song is so cute but I had to deduct a point for that horrible bridge

**cremeebrulee** (5): kinda boring for wiz

**DaHumanTorch** (5): aggressively mid

**frogaranaman** (5): never was a Wiz Khalifa guy so this never clicked

**thedoctordances1940** (5): Roll Up the energy please

**timothy444** (5): Tacky. Reminds me of combining the composition "The Show Goes On" with the lyrical content that you'd find in songs like Charlie Puth's "One Call Away" and Nelly's "Hey Porsche". Basically a dollar store version of "The Show Goes On"

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.2): this is certainly a song

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This one is meh. What the hell is that bridge? It sounds like a whole different track. I miss some happy songs like this though.

**kirby31200** (4): There's a reason most of these songs have a featured artist do the singing

**seanderlust** (4): when popheads says men get away with making mediocre songs this is the kind of song they mean

**Leixander** (3): i have no memory of hearing this song anywhere? shocked with the viewcount on youtube

**FKJVMMP** (2): Worst use of “shorty” since Justin Bieber. Also don’t call your girlfriend “homie”. How is this dude so bad at rap slang.

**izeasklapaucius** (8): We really didn't deserve Neon Hitch probably because she's a Kesha copy but that's for another story

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): Our final exit of day 1 is also the first loss for Gym Class Heroes. I enjoy this song well enough but it is definitely carried by the chorus from Neon Hitch (which I still can't believe is not a stage name)

---

# i am so sorry this couldn't make day 2 for you

**timothy444** (11): This is my childhood song. Yes, the song that, had it not existed, I wouldn't even be remotely interested in pop music in the slightest. And honestly, hearing this song again brings back so many nostalgic memories. The infectious melody from Neon Hitch that touches on all the things that make me a believer of the power of music to tell our stories. The opening lyrics that are inclusive and resonant of the power of every voice. I cannot believe that I still have to explain to people how this song touches me, how deeply the choruses resonates with me. It's like chicken soup (good for the soul).

# Ass Back Home!!!

**1998tweety** (10): what happened to her, she sounds good here

**frogaranaman** (10): Travie McCoy you dumb fucking ass when are you releasing new music

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The only ass song that is not actually about asses. Also, where Dance A$$ at? It's missing from this rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is cheesy and emotional in all the right ways

**thedoctordances1940** (10): the chorus is absolutely beautiful :woeis:

**JunkyGS** (9): Neon Hitch deserved better

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): we love Neon Hitch, us rating Fuck U Be11a when

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): perfect chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly, this is surprisingly fine, and has more lyrical depth than i expected? idk what to say really

**jsonphile** (8): this is a nice song. By the end of the song I’m rooting for these two lovebirds to get their asses back home

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s cute

**runaway3212** (7.5): I love the chorus but the verses aren't great

**akanewasright** (6.8): This chorus has such a nice build up… and then it doesn’t have that release it needed.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): this song is so bland for having ass in the title

**GARjuna** (6): the best rapping gym class heroes did this rate

**jman457** (6): Its cute but not that special

**kirby31200** (6): Neon Hitch deserved more

**musical\_pyn** (6): neon hitch's part is great but the rest is eh

**astrologicalangel** (5.5): every song could use more Neon Hitch

**skargardin** (5): this was fine

**steelstepladder** (4.4): If garden gnomes were singing this it would be Ass Back Gnome

**simplyterific** (4): a corny ride or die anthem

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): Completely carried by the hook
