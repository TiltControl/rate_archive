#My Heart Will Go On

**agentofscranton** (10): one of selegend godmez‚Äôs best

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): deserved a better video

**dirdbub** (10): @me follow it

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is my favorite Selena song because it actually sounds like she‚Äôs singing.

**followingfreeways** (10): this is one of her best songs imo, it's the kind of song u bop to while u cry. truly amazing I appreciate this song thx selena

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of Selena‚Äôs best songs and really the one that signaled her shift into being an ‚Äúadult‚Äù artist. That performance where she‚Äôs crying and there‚Äôs those projections behind her is just beautiful, and probably one of her career highlights. The composition of this song is very smart, it keeps building up and dropping down again in a way that makes it feel like it‚Äôs languishing. In particular the title phrase sits in this sort of choked out low place, it‚Äôs very effective. Selena‚Äôs weak vocals are actually an asset here because it really plays up how pathetic the message of the song is. It really is like that sometimes.

**SkyBlade79** (10): selena‚Äôs best song, probably. It‚Äôs just beautiful

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): what the fuuuuck juan

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Top 2 Selena Gomez song (maybe even Top 1) also how timely is this rn that her and Biebs got back together

**cyborglilith** (9.7): I loved this song before I even knew selegend godmez exists

**10footnotes** (9.5): Oh my god this song is so good, how have I never heard it before? Selena‚Äôs voice complements the chill vibe so well, and she sings with real emotion. The prechorus is honestly an 11/10, especially ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet the odds against it all.‚Äù The only thing keeping this from a perfect score is the bridge, which is a little boring. But other than that, I love this song and it‚Äôs probably going into my regular rotation.

**poppinmolly** (9.5): it sure does Selener. Preach girl!!

**Death\_Soup** (9): I consider this one of my favorite Selena songs. What a bop

**gannade** (9): Honestly the voicemail at the beginning of the mv is everything

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): When Selena just suddenly gained artistic credibility out of nowhere.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.8): Remember when she thanked Jesus after her performance of this at the AMAs and Twitter thought she was thanking Justin. Probably should thank Justin if he gave us this masterpiece.

**jamesfog** (8.5): She has better

**zamomattel** (8.5): not generally a huge Selena fan, but this is an absolute tune

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A good selena song! Not her best, but still good!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): jelena.jpg

**Raykel** (7.5): This song is a 10 when you include the beginning monologue in the music video.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): I still haven't listened to Revival

**awryj** (7.4): google what is jelena and why does it sound like a brand of jello

**shineflyer** (7): no matter how many times i hear this song i think the beginning vocals say "what the fuck"

**enecks** (6): Queen of

#I Think I'm Gonna Have A Heart Attack

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): lmao this boring shit

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): meh

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): a bit melodramatic

**LandoFreeman** (5): the instrumental is cute

**Leixander** (5): Selena Selegend is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Oh-oh no! Oh no! Oh no-oh!

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5): Boring rehash of the theme, you can do better Selena

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Sorry, guys, but my opinion of this song gradually deteriorated over time and now that I'm listening to it with earphones I can hear some effects in the production I don't like :/ It's not a bad song, just not one I enjoy very much. I must admit that the melody is very good, though.

**rocketgamer31** (5): my heart really does not want this song

**JunkyGS** (4): "What the fart wants"

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i would say that this song has the worst hook of every song ever but selena has hooks that are like 100x worse

#Lazy Saturdays

**awryj** (10): A strong contender for my 11 and the best trop pop song in the world. Ever since I heard it, I've been obsessed with Gabrielle and I still am. (Buy Avalon EP on iTunes)

**jamesfog** (10): C'mon pop perfection!

**strawberryswing1** (10): Wow I love this. I've never heard of this artist before.

**VeganSquash** (10): amazing verses

**10footnotes** (9.5): I feel like half of all my comments on this rate are just ‚ÄúThis is a bop,‚Äù but this really is such a high quality synthpop bop. If the bridge was a little more interesting, it would be a 10. Gabrielle‚Äôs voice is Gorgeous: I‚Äôm going to check out her other music sometime.

**cyborglilith** (9): omg new bop discovered

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): OMG a hidden bop. I wish the chorus went off a little more but this is so good.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): i thought this was julia micheals at first

**dirdbub** (8): this production is FULL, I love it

**Mysario** (8): I'd rate it higher but as soon as she said the lyrics "been so lonely on my own" I had bad flashbacks to the last song

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): A peppy, snappy love song, that doesn't try to eclipse its own scope. What's not to love?

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Another alt pop girl that I don't know about, but this feels more digestible than the previous ones, that's for certain.

**rocketgamer31** (8): I wouldn't mind waking up to this song

**shineflyer** (8): I like acoustic Gabrielle better, but like, it's still Gabrielle Aplin. The pre-chorus harmony is golden, btw.

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): harmless pop is nice

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): not bad, but not good either

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): I know poptimism is a thing but I hate that note in the first second of the song and the instrumental just doesn‚Äôt get better.

**zamomattel** (6.5): better than i thought it would be but i still think she's boring af

**Elitefourbrad** (6): I liked it, it was a good bop. Something I‚Äôd dance to while hoeing it out in the club.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I think this track plays its hand way too early, it gets right into the beat and the flow of the song with too little variation. Like, once it starts it stays the same until it ends. The bridge is like, four seconds‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd think a song called ‚ÄúWaking Up Slow‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be in such a rush.

**CrispyEggs123** (5): The rhythm feels off to me for some reason

#Fine

**c0ns3rvative** (11): I really think this ranks up there as one of the greatest songs ever made. The bluesy, drowsy guitars and warbling synths combine to create an intoxicating haze of an atmosphere that allows Lana's vocals to simply drift along the top of the mix with a sense of airy indifference. It's the crown jewel in Lana's discography and a song that will be looked back on in decades as one of the defining tracks of our time

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): queen of whatever her game is. i remember hearing this on the radio a couple years back and thinking that it's so slow and draggy? and the rhythm change shook me. i associated this sound with lana and moved on, then rediscovered her this year and SHE'S SO GOOD WTF. i knew about this goddess and slept on her all along. ultraviolence might be my fave lana album.

**agentofscranton** (10): imo lana's best after national anthem and born to die

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): the alternate mix version is better

**cyborglilith** (10): I love Honeymoon. It‚Äôs the album you listen to when you‚Äôre driving somewhere alone, maybe on an abandoned dirt road, or just in any direction. And you can‚Äôt help but get lost in her relaxing vocals. The singles ‚ÄúShades of Cool,‚Äù ‚ÄúHigh by the Beach,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRadio‚Äù have me scalped. And West Coast is just amazing. The drums in the beginning transition to weirdness I don‚Äôt know how to name, but it‚Äôs a good weirdness. I expected Honeymoon to be rated already because it‚Äôs her second best album, only after Born This Way. bless xoxo<3

**gannade** (10): queen lana

**Leixander** (10): lana's best chorus! also Ultraviolence is her best album and gets unnecessary hate by some people :(

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): a wig snatcher if I ever heard one, that chorus still has me shook

**rocketgamer31** (10): The way she sings "ooh baby" and "move baby" reminds me of how gay I am

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): god her voice is incredible here... I can see my baby swinging

**ExtraEater** (9): aesthetic

**Kaylaboe** (9): invented the pacific coast!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Lana used to be the only main (alt) pop girl I really disliked along with Katy, but Lust for Life made me give another shot at her, and while she's not a favourite by any means, I enjoy her best tracks a lot, of which West Coast is no exception. The chorus shows off some of Lana's edgier vocals, which you can hear on songs like Lucky Ones. I can see my baby swinging...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Queen of shouting out the West Coast on the same album as Brooklyn Baby

**Death\_Soup** (8.9): she‚Äôs pretty hit and miss with me but I really enjoyed this one

**10footnotes** (8): I just listened to Born to Die a few days ago, and I liked it. Hopefully this is a sign of good things to come on Ultraviolence too. The tempo changes are daring, but very cool and unusual. I just wish I knew what she was singing in the prechorus.

**dirdbub** (8): one of Lana's best songs, but I still find the transition from the verses to the chorus jarring and slightly out of place

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Lana Del Rey is a queen who deserves all of the praise. One of her best songs!

**shineflyer** (8): A lot of lana tracks are boring for me. This is not one of those tracks. I really like the verse and chorus being at different speeds.

**SkyBlade79** (8): so chill and I love the high part

**awryj** (7.8): Queen of being in love and sounding as if she wanted to die at the same time

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): the last minute and a half almost makes up for the borefest of the first 2 and a half. Almost.

#Fresh

**enecks** (7): Lana Del Ray is like the West Coast - good but extremely self absorbed and highkey pretentious.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): I was a big fan of Lana in her Born To Die era (I played Lolita on repeat way too much considering how underage I was wow gross), so when this came out, I remember not liking it as much as everything she‚Äôd made before. It‚Äôs still a good song, but Born To Die Lana is still supreme Lana.

**VeganSquash** (7): Lana's music is way too slow for me, but this is lowkey a bop so

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): this song is very interesting but it's not really good. like i'm fascinated by it but idk i don't like it

**dropthehammer11** (6): Lana has better songs

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): ultraviolence is so blah ugh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): West coast represent! East coast is better of course, but you gotta have some hometown loyalty.

#Fierce

**Hogwartsreject1912** (5): WHY DOES EVERYONE CLAIM THIS IS SOOOOOO GREAT?????!!!!!!!!!!

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5): I just always feel like listening to Lana is like listening to an artist I love but through a plate-glass window; there's just too much ~ethereal whatever~ around the content I like

**zamomattel** (4.5): this is good compared to other lana songs but it's just a bit repetitive for me

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I'm sorry Lana fans, but she just seems so boring 90% of the time and this is no exception

**poppinmolly** (3): I'm sorry I just can't get into Lana. I've tried. I don't like voice she affects.

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): lame del rey

**timothy444** (0): Back when Lana Del Rey had a rate, I was extremely bored of her music and consequently gave my 0 to one of her songs, particularly the Cola one which is absolutely devoid of any redemption whatsoever. So here we are, at the charity rate and Lana Del Rey has failed to evolve her musical style and we're stuck back in 2012 where nothing has changed. It's a total snooze fest zzzzzzzzzz.

**VeganSquash** (11): I submitted this to the rate, so I am biased by giving it an 11. But honestly, this song is magical. It's one of my favorite songs of all time and I hope more people look into Emeli's music.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): I know I just wrote a long explanation for Lorde so I‚Äôll keep this one short-ish but this was one of the few shows I went to with my mom at a really amazing venue. It was a complete surprise, I didn‚Äôt even know my mom knew about her (this was right after Next to Me, so around 2013) or had tickets, and I got the most beautiful poster from the show and since all of her music reminds me of that show with my mom and on top of that she‚Äôs just a brilliant musician.

**LandoFreeman** (10): love her voice

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Okay, this is straight up amazing, possibly the best song in this rate so far. Seldom do I hear such good vocals, and nothing harkens back to the good old days of soul like 'oh heaven, oh heaven, oh good intention!'. This is the greatest thing this rate's introduced me to.

**awryj** (9.5): Ooh I love this song, Emeli Sande is SO underappreciated. Yall should listen to Starlight this instant

**jamesfog** (9.5): Very nice instrumental and vocals!

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This beat gives me serious Powerpuff Girls vibes and I love it? I‚Äôve never heard of this singer before but I instantly stan her if the music she makes is anything like this!

**followingfreeways** (9): "will you recognize me when I lose another friend" this makes me wanna cry kinda

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): I dig this drum & bass instrumental, plus the vocals are on point

**10footnotes** (8): This song goes to 100 right out of the gate, and without the bridge probably would have been way too exhausting. As it is though, it‚Äôs a very good song.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): she has other music than that one song ?????

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): i like her voice but the best part is the burial-esque drum production

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): I wish Emeli Sande caught on more, she's just a solid songwriter

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): love the vocals

**shineflyer** (8): that drum and bass beat is in my heart. and juxtaposing it with strings is really cool

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): has a Runnin' (by Naughty Boy & Beyonc√©) feel to it but it's not as good

**cyborglilith** (7): boring but I guess she tried

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Can I just say that as a non-religious person, songs like this always get me weirdly hyped? I almost converted to Christianity in high school because I kept listening to the musical version of Sister Act.

**mokitsu** (7): ok lol i didnt know this was emeli's.

**gannade** (6.7): ok Emile! I thought she was a really one dimensional artist before but this is a cute little bop

**zamomattel** (6.5): i prefer ballad Sande personally but this is pretty cute

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i like how the instrumentals really contrast with her vocals like they're a weird match

# The Bad Place

**dirdbub** (5.5): ooo, wow, a drum and bass beat behind an R&B song. sooooo inspiringggggggg I'm literally shaking in my seat just qualming over how inspireeeddddd I ammmmm

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): i'm sorry but i hate this

**enecks** (3): I was told I was not going to go to heaven by my pastor because I was bi and trans. That's why I don't fuck with songs with Heaven in the title (Heaven is a place on earth is the exception because queer women reclaimed it)

**johnazoidberg-** (9): Can we take a sec to talk about the hilariously bad photoshopping job on this album cover? It makes Nicole and the girl to the left of her - I'd say her name but they only ever marketed Nicole - look like they're missing organs. Skinny sells but can we let women look like actual human beings? They look like if they were in prison, they could just walk through the bars sideways.

**rocketgamer31** (9): I was slutdropping to this before I even knew what slutdropping was

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): a classic

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): There was a period earlier this year where I just kind of randomly remembered this song and I just went around asking everyone if they remembered this song and they were all just like ‚Äú‚Ä¶yes?‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúyeah‚Äù and it was stuck in my head for a long time and I was just walking around everywhere with a little bit of a hoe spring in my step.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A little long but bops

**10footnotes** (7.5): I stared at Nicole Scherzinger‚Äôs waist on the album cover for an inappropriately long amount of time trying to decide whether it was photoshopped or not. She legit looks like a disembodied stick of flesh with no arms.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7): It tries to be both larger-than-life and stripped-back all the time. Why?

**shineflyer** (7): I don't want to like this group, but, here we are.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): slut anthem, but not really a good one.....

#Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows Everywhere

**dropthehammer11** (11): I didn't submit this, but I have to give this an 11. Abbey Road means so much to me as an album, and this song is so tender and beautiful.

**CrispyEggs123** (10): Such a heart-warming song

**cyborglilith** (10): It‚Äôs just perfect. I‚Äôm not a fan of The Beetles, but if I listened to any of their other songs, I would probably still like this one the most. It‚Äôs a shame I can‚Äôt give it the 11, though. Just like Taylor Swift‚Äôs songs, I get nostalgia just from hearing this song, even though I have no memories associated with it. Utada takes it one step further.

**dirdbub** (10): this song literally never gets old, no matter how many times I listen to it. goddamn it is amazing

**enecks** (10): The Beatles are so good at universally appealing bops

**jamesfog** (10): Blassic

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This is a pretty good song for a band that got their name from the episode of The Powerpuff Girls where Mojo Jojo, HIM, Fuzzy Lumpkins, and Princess Morbucks team up.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): George Harrison is one of my favourite musicians ever, and it goes without saying that this is one of his Beatles songs. It captures the kindness and sincerity of his personality so well. Paul's love songs can be as corny as shit, but, if we're going to be honest whenever George does a song like this, it lifts my spirits up by a ton. More to come in January.

**poppinmolly** (10): a wholesome Beatles song. Lovely :)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally so iconic I don‚Äôt need to defend this

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): this is my moms fave song ever

**awryj** (9): HCtS might be my favorite Beatles song. It's one of these songs that literally sound like summer.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a classic!

**LandoFreeman** (9): sways back and forth blissfully

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i'm eagerly anticipating the disrespect this will get

**VeganSquash** (9): a feel good bop.

**10footnotes** (8.5): I think this will be a dark horse in the rate. What monster would rate this song poorly? Then again, I might be giving popheads too much credit. We‚Äôll see :eyes:

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): doo doo doo doo

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.4): This song also makes me think of my parents and I didn‚Äôt want to cry any more while writing down my thoughts for this rate but ok.

**Mysario** (8): flushed

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): Listening to the Beatles I remember that we're doing this for fun and out of genuine love for the entirety of the scope of the music, and I feel small in a vast, vast artistic world, so thanks whoever included this on the playlist, it's a refreshing change of pace.

**shineflyer** (8): may be overrated but it's still p dang good

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): it's a fun little song but nothing groundbreaking

**Death\_Soup** (7): it‚Äôs an ok song. Not their best, but it‚Äôs a classic.

**zamomattel** (6.5): like it's a cute song, but it's no elanor rigby

**followingfreeways** (6): sorry I know it's a classic but I would probably never willingly listen to this on my own

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): To quote the song, ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright.‚Äù

#Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): OVERRATED, I said it. Bye.

**SkyBlade79** (4): I‚Äôm falling asleep

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): i don't like it idk

**Leixander** (2): please don't kill me hammer, but I hate this song

**Elitefourbrad** (1): I don‚Äôt like The Beatles.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (0): i hate this make it stop, the beatles suck like they are so overrated no thanks.

#In This Moment, I Am Euphoric

**Death\_Soup** (11): this is the first time i‚Äôve heard this song. It‚Äôs getting an 11 over my submission. how did this not take off in the US smh

**10footnotes** (10): The title is a great match to the music, this song is like a rush of happiness. It‚Äôs so well-produced too, it somehow avoids becoming just a wall of sound during the choruses.

**agentofscranton** (10): it‚Äôs kinda generic early 2010s europop but the Eurovision performance is iconic and it‚Äôs still one of (if not THE) best winner in recent years

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): THINGS SHE DID: T H A T

**Elitefourbrad** (10): OMG A DISCO BOP IN MY POPHEADS? I SAY YASSSSSSSSSS

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): I‚Äôm still pissed Margaret Berger was so slept on in 2013 but this is the epitome of Swedish Eurovision entries in the twenty first century. Also, Hey Mamma should have won this year! Bye!

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Let's not act like this ISN'T the greatest song of all time 'kay? It deserves to hold the Eurovision record for most points. Also, #JusticeForStatements, because 1.) Robin was terrible and 2.) Of all the people to lose to in Andra Chansen, it's that Shawn Mendes ripoff? Fuck no.

**jamesfog** (10): Perfection

**Kaylaboe** (10): if this doesn‚Äôt make you feel euphoric you should delete your account

**LandoFreeman** (10): i suddenly want to begin a drag career

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I came up with this quote a few minutes ago. I thought r/popheads would appreciate. Just to be clear, I'm not a professional "quote maker". I'm just an poptimist teenager who greatly values his scrobbles of Run Away With Me and scientific fact over any silly Rolling Stone review written several decades years ago. That being said, I am open to any and all criticism."In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony Ed's blessing. But because, I am englightened by Carly's intelligence." - u/ patronsaintofaspies. Eh?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): probably my favorite Eurovision winner ever. This song is a fucking certified bop and listen to the live version if you haven't because it's even better.

**zamomattel** (10): imo the best eurovision song, ABBA are shaking

**bwc222** (9.5): i don't get how this can take off in europe but not even see the top 100 in the u.s. wtf it's so catchy

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): it sounds huge, like a good ellie goulding reject or something the old calvin harris would make

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A major bop!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): I miss when the charts where full of these songs :( this was so good

**dirdbub** (8): oh god another 2012 song? checks the album release date yeP

**followingfreeways** (8): this gives me titanic vibes and vampire diaries vibes but I don't really mind

**poppinmolly** (8): a Eurovision smash hit!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Weird bop that I didn‚Äôt expect to be a bop

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7.5): Getting part Rihanna and part early Zedd vibes from this, and while each of them did their respective selves better, this is still a solid bop

#Not Because Of Any Phony God‚Äôs Blessing.

**awryj** (7): Ok, if you're from Europe, you know that THIS was the song of 2012. It was everywhere. It still is, for that matter. And as much as I love it, I'm kinda sick of it. Sorry.

**cyborglilith** (7): name fits song

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): A fun song but not really my cup of tea

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): beginning sounds like stonemilker by bjork, the rest sounds like everytime we touch

**strawberryswing1** (6): production is really dated

**animefangrant62** (5): The production is fantastic but the singer is terrible.

**VeganSquash** (5): Generic.

**shineflyer** (4.5): she's got a really good voice. she deserves a better song

But Because, I Am Enlightened By My Intelligence.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): It‚Äôs like if Celine Dion recorded a Calvin Harris song, and that‚Äôs a bad thing. This feels like it should be playing over the credits of a Bionicles movie.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): lol this sounds like it's from dance dance revolution but also by p!nk

#You Hold Me Up

**agentofscranton** (10): calvin harris is trash for sabotaging her career like he did and not letting her perform this song, this song had the potential to be huge smh

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I love this song so much! It displays Rita‚Äôs abilities as an artist all the way back in 2014. It‚Äôs a shame she couldn‚Äôt release anything until now, because this is easily in my Top 3 from Rita!

**jamesfog** (10): MASTERPIECE

**Leixander** (10): Calvin x Rita = Perfection. Sad that we are never going to hear the other stuff they recorded.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): godbless whoever sent this for this rate

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The opening to this is literally so iconic

**timothy444** (10): Rita Ora is seriously underrated and the fact that the United States slept on this banger only proves my point. One of the best pop songs to be released in 2014.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the song i picked but i'm not giving it my 11 :eyes:

**Death\_Soup** (9.5): this sub is turning me into a Rita Ora stan

**zamomattel** (9.5): a pop bop, y'all need to stop sleeping on the Ora

**10footnotes** (9): Rita Ora really has released so many bops, it‚Äôs a shame the US is sleeping on her. Side note: this rate has so many uplifting, positive, major-key songs like this one and I love it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): Dropping my new song on Monday if this get 100,000 retweets

**awryj** (8.6): Oficially the boppiest song by Rita Ora, Anywhere being a close second

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): girlie SNAPPED

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): the 3rd best rita ora song. the digital dog remix is better

**ExtraEater** (8): just looking at the name of this song the artist who made it and the year of release i knew exactly what it would sound like. good tho

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A song full of lies (it seems like Rita Ora is constantly letting people down) but a mild bop nonetheless.

**Mudkip1** (8): oh wow this is a rita ora song???? this used to get spammed on the radio i thought it would've been sung by a relevant artist

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): The two instrumental hooks are great, and the bridge is so coy I love it

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Good song, but something feels...off about it. Perhaps it's starting to get dated? I preferred Rita's other song in here to this one, NGL.

**poppinmolly** (8): a bop

**rocketgamer31** (8): I can see popheads letting this song down tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): a lowkey bop

**dirdbub** (7): the opening was so promising but then it just went to... whatever that was

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): Again, I don‚Äôt want to be deported.

**SkyBlade79** (7): so sweet

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): i will never let you down until i'm ready

**strawberryswing1** (6): forgettable

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): average

**shineflyer** (5): i had to look up how old this song was so i could judge it in context, but it's only 3 years old...? I REALLY dislike that guitar tone, but at least it goes away on the chorus.

**VeganSquash** (5): parts of this I loved, others I didn't.

#Take Me In Your Arms

**Raykel** (11): Everything about this amazing. The soft opening, the harmonies in the pre-chorus, the gated reverb snare smashing in and synths filling the production, the "first you gottA ASK ME OUT" to only be stripped down and soft again a second later, then smashing in one last time. 80s-inspired perfection.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): "take me" by aly & aj but every time i hear it my wig gets snatched harder

**10footnotes** (10): This is basically perfect synthpop. I rarely give perfect 10s, but I can‚Äôt find a single negative aspect of this song.

**agentofscranton** (10): easily one of the best songs of 2017, glad the real disney queens are back and delivering B.O.P.S.

**bwc222** (10): a synth pop masterpiece!

**c0ns3rvative** (10): The synths already sound timeless and the unorthodox song structure creates an incredible sense of longing!

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Aly & AJ were a pivotal part of my childhood with Potential Breakup Song. But this is without a doubt the best song they‚Äôve ever done. The 80‚Äôs synths work so well with the drop!

**enecks** (10): First unexpected banger of the rate. A moody atmospheric buildup that leads to a punchy and visceral bit of throwback synthpop that I definitely did not expect from the people involved in "Potential Breakup Song"

**gannade** (10): Potential Breakup Song's Revenge is COMING

**jamesfog** (10): One of the best songs of 2017!

**mokitsu** (10): What a perfect song! A rush of synthpop. The video is great as well and it made me like the song a lot more!

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.2): This grew on me because of this rate!! When I first heard it I was wondering why the hell people were lauding it and then I played it on repeat on the Spotify playlist and now I get it.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): what a comeback !

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): synthpop freak me is screaming it's so smooth and joyful and st. lucia and misterwives

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I have to admit, I don't understand why people enjoy Ally and AJ so much. Their music is fine, but from what I've heard of them, they're not artists I would regularly listen to. This song isn't still quite my thing, but it has gorgeous production and vocals, which I found hard to find in the previous rate the two sisters were in; therefore, it gets a higher score.

**Death\_Soup** (8.5): one of those songs that you can‚Äôt pinpoint to a certain decade.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I grew on this track, I remember hearing it the day it was released too early and not being too impressed by it but as time has gone on I‚Äôve only come to like it more. It still feels somehow underdeveloped but it‚Äôs a bop nonetheless, and it came with one of my favorite music videos of the year.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Honestly? It's a good song! Wish it was a bit more memorable though...

**LandoFreeman** (8): this really does sound straight out of 1985

**awryj** (7.8): They are the Carly Rae Jepsen of this year. They had a pop career, everybody's forgotten about them, and then - here goes 80s themed boppery. This song could easily be included on EMOTION. It's not as great as some of the songs there, unfortunately.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7.5): Good clean pop for everyone that makes me nod my head along regardless of the number of people in the room.

**dropthehammer11** (7): I like this, smooth synthpop

**Leixander** (7): a good comeback single but could be way better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I‚Äôm not gonna paste exactly what I wrote on the jukebox, but I do enjoy this track. It‚Äôs not quite as energetic as I would hope but it still bops. Definitely better than their older output imo.

**zamomattel** (7): this is the sort of song popheads love and i like but dont feel as strongly on

**shineflyer** (6.5): reminds me strongly of MUNA

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): Kind of okay but also a bit immature.

**rocketgamer31** (6): This fits right into those cheesy high-school romance movies, but I like the throwback vibe of the instrumental

#Take Me To The Dentists

**dirdbub** (5): I'm going to be honest, this does not build up properly and it kind of ruins the song for me

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): very average

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): i'm sorry i still don't get why people like them, like at all, mama this is garbage adn it's not even hot garbage

#I miss you, yeah I miss you

**awryj** (10): JANET COMING IN H O T WITH THEMm BOPS I Am QUIVERIIIINgg

**c0ns3rvative** (10): Legendary song from a legendary album featuring downright spectacular dance production

**jamesfog** (10): Queenie

**LandoFreeman** (10): invented chair choreography

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): WE LOVE A CLASSIC MISS JACKSON DID THAT

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Rhythm Nation is Janet's first good album, IMO (sorry, Control) and Miss You Much is a foray into heavier, harsher mainstream pop. Sure, it's no Black Cat, but it's a great headbanger, and I think the prechorus is sorely underrated. Will the 80s Rate Sequel be finally picked next cycle? I want to give this a 10 twice.

**enecks** (9): Janet did THAT

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love this song but I will say that one of the biggest faults of Rhythm Nation is that it focuses a bit too much on sex despite ostensibly being about other things.

**shineflyer** (9): this song's got weird clashing notes in it, which are actually really cool in the context they're used.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): a bop

**Elitefourbrad** (8): A classic Janet song from her second best album. I love everything about this!

**Mysario** (8): :janet:

**rocketgamer31** (8): I'm getting a kind of industrial vibe with the instrumental here, I dig it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A bop that‚Äôs a little dated but still bops

**VeganSquash** (8): BOP

**10footnotes** (7.5): This makes me feel like dancing, and I have less than zero dance skills.

**dirdbub** (7.5): well, this is definitely from the 80s,

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): it's ok but it is so hecking repetitive

**cyborglilith** (7): the beat gets old quickly

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): wtf is she spelling

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.3): Again, I can hear certain users screaming, but I‚Äôm too young for this.

**SkyBlade79** (6): kind of repetitive and the production is generic but I can‚Äôt deny how good she sounds.

#Did you not wanna tell them it's the end

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5.5): This is not even the best musical idea related to the year 1989, and I'm no Swiftie

**zamomattel** (5): I like Janet but I never like her industrial sounding songs as much as her normal ones

#Zing Boom

**AbnormalPopPunk** (11): queen bjork does it like no other. an iconic crossover of beats and strings, sober ii would not exist without her.

**BreezySeason** (11): Bj√∂rk is a queen

**CrispyEggs123** (11): Staaaate oooooooof eemeeeeerrrrgencyyyyyy

**enecks** (11): Appropriately, this song creates beautiful emotional landscapes in a way few songs can. The mix of glitchhop and strings creates majesty in a way that few songs can, aided by an incredible Bjork performance. The funny thing? It's not even the best song in Homogenic.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): Bjork's GOAT(fight me), got me into her music. Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it... it's all of those things. But actually it's a fucking good song.

**agentofscranton** (10): this is my first time listening to a non-it‚Äôs oh so quiet bjork song and she‚Äôs definitely piqued my interest!

**animefangrant62** (10): This was the first Bjork song I ever heard because of this rate and I loved it so much I went and listened to Homogenic and loved that as well. Thank you to whomever suggested it!

**awryj** (10): Bjork makes me wanna go to Iceland and never come back.

**dropthehammer11** (10): omg this is the first bjork song i've ever heard and i'm fucking shook???

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This was my first time listening to Bjork. It was an artistic experience I will never forget and I now stan her forever.

**ExtraEater** (10): a stone cold masterpiece

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): First of all, this is a brilliant song, but it isn't the best track on Homogenic. That title belongs to Bachelorette, and Bachelorette alone. Now that we've got that settled, though, there's a lot in Joga that's enough for you to build an argument for it being one of the greatest songs of all time. Beautiful instruments mixed with futuristic production, Bjork's vulnerability in her delivery, and the lyrics being some of her most relatable ever are all top contenders when it comes to defending that line of thinking, and if her screams during the outro aren't enough, perhaps the person you're debating with is a lost cause.

**rocketgamer31** (10): I haven't looked into Bj√∂rk's music but this instrumental is badass, I love the atmosphere it creates. Her vocals are on point

**shineflyer** (10): one of my favorite Bjork tracks. her voice is so unique and captivating. the strings, the electronic drums everywhere, the time signature jumping around... this song just never gets old, there's so much to it

**jamesfog** (9.5): Oh wow!

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): i can‚Äôt believe this is over 20 years old yet it still sounds like the future

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): BJAERK

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Invented music

**dirdbub** (8.5): there could have been a better Bj√∂rk song chosen cough cough itsonthesamealbumtitled"Pluto"whatareyoudoingwhoeverchosethissong cough cough but it's also Bj√∂rk so it's good

**VeganSquash** (8.5): A Bjork song I actually like?!? What is this?

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): i've slept on Bjork for so long but maybe I'll go check out her other stuff now. it's very...atmospheric and vibey and lana. and her pipes, god.

**cyborglilith** (8): I like this song but I don‚Äôt really understand bjork in general. Like, her song titles and aesthetics are weird and so is her music. Everyone thinks of it as abstract art but I just don‚Äôt see it. It‚Äôs Oh So Quiet is a very weird song because it‚Äôs really quiet and then gets extremely loud, but I guess that‚Äôs what art is. She obviously works hard on her music though.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): This is for the orchestra. Why don‚Äôt more people use strings.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Yeah, this is def a bjork song

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): wig flew to Utopia

**mokitsu** (8): Absolutely stunning

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): I have not listened to much Bjork, and I admit I spent I spent the first two minutes of this just trying to figure out the game of the song, but then I just dissolved into it and everything was beautiful

**10footnotes** (6): Look at me, look at me, I‚Äôm so good at joOoOga.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): i can appreciate that it tried to be classy and elevated but this is basic af. holy fuck this is long somebody make it stop her vocals are horrible i can't believe somebody can stan this. stop screaming ffs you do not have the range!!!!!

#It's All So Quiet

**Death\_Soup** (5): not feeling it. Not my type of music. It is pretty though

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i thought this was halsey at first. anyway i feel guilty giving this a bad score. wtf does joga mean

**zamomattel** (5): bjork reminds me of if Grimes and Kate Bush wrote a song together but took out any hook and added some random noise in that i respect the artistry but prefer the other two to her because they write alternative pop whereas bjork is more alternative than them

**followingfreeways** (4): I'm so sorry...., I know a lot of people love her but this makes me wanna sleep and die kinda

**johnazoidberg-** (3): I get all those old MadTV sketches about Bjork now

**NapsAndNetflix** (3): i dont get bjork

**SkyBlade79** (3): how can something with such a funny name be so boring. It does get interesting for like a minute but I hate her voice

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This song made me feel great because it came out the same year I was born and that means that I‚Äôm no longer the worst thing to come out of 1997. I kept waiting for a drop or something to give this song some life but instead it‚Äôs just some weird electronica soundscape. At times her vocal line feels weirdly cut together, like her lines are running into each other in a way that I don‚Äôt really like, if it was intentional at all. Just because something is lo-fi and contains a lot of grainy sound effects it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs high art or whatever. That said, this song is as old as I am, so living in a post-Homogenic world I‚Äôll admit I probably can‚Äôt appreciate this for how groundbreaking it is. I still don‚Äôt like it though.

**strawberryswing1** (2): Never listened to Bjork before, and after hearing this I don't think I will again.

=====

yunglethe: i honestly think popheads skews pretty young, is very in the "now" and also is a very POP pop subreddit. our gal bjork has never had a number one. she doesn't make super traditional pop. she gets more love on indieheads where they are less likely to question her "weird names" or "lack of drop" or the "weird electronica soundscape" or "grainy sound effects" (the beats i guess??)

as a really young kid i only listened pop music. when i listened to bjork or joanna newsom or anything that wasn't top 40 super saccharine, i was confused because it wasn't always upbeat, went beyond 3:30, had weird instrumentals, or didn't have a "good" voice. i'm certain there are ppl on here who are at the same juncture. the artists i mention as an example have contributed so much to my life that i think it would be a disservice if i only talked about, like, ariana or charli (two artists i both also enjoy!) on here.

I'm pretty young myself, I discovered Bjork on my own when I was 15 I think (so a couple of years ago) and I'm thrilled that some other people, older and younger, can discover such gems as her. But yeah, I don't really consider her music to be pop, art pop/prog pop maybe.

**timothy444** (10): Rating this a 10 because anything lower would probably get my banned and get my popheads bop license yanked out of me! Fun song!

**VeganSquash** (10): first of all, I could not find the 6 minute version lol, so I just rated the normal one. This song is iconic, and the music video is so cringe I cannot! Michael is so cute too, its too bad he's gone

**10footnotes** (9): Another classic song. Even though it‚Äôs 6 minutes long, it doesn‚Äôt drag at all.

**enecks** (9): So much of what would lead to MJ's peak is in this song

**rocketgamer31** (9): I will never not think of Rush Hour when I hear this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): ageless bop

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Is it possible to hate this song?

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): Michael Jackson coasts by with a lot of affectations I hate in contemporary pop music by just being too groovy for his own good, and that's okay

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): not his best but its cool

**gannade** (7): shouldnt be so long but a bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is a classic Michael Jackson song, but it's not my favourite by any means. Despite how fun it is to dance to, it's just really more repetitive and less masterful than his 80s work. There are better songs from Off The Wall, much less his entire career.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I respect Michael Jackson‚Äôs impact, but I‚Äôve never liked his music. This song feels good on the dance floor but once I really pay attention to it I don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs saying most of the time (I‚Äôve never quite liked falsetto) and it goes on way too long without making any shifts. Like‚Ä¶ would some modulation be out of the question? It‚Äôs a six minute extended version but it feels like they literally just played the song twice, it feels like the same thirty seconds over and over and over and over and it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ boring to me. All of the elements of this track are good (those strings are VERY impressive) but when put together, I dunno, they just leave me cold.

#Had Enough

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): it's funky but does it really have to be 6 minutes

**shineflyer** (5): if we're being real, this song doesn't need to be 6 minutes long.

**zamomattel** (5): definitely one of my least fave MJ songs

**mokitsu** (1): sorry i can't stand MJ, his adlibs, his voice. and this is too long and repetitive

#How Did You Guys Figure It Out‚ÄΩ

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Wow wonder who suggested this? hmmmmmmmmmm

**Leixander** (8.5): i wonder who sent this song :eyes:

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): if this wasn't the song /u/ jellboo chose i'm eating my shoes and getting tattooed michael's face on my face

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): jelboo is a legend

**poppinmolly** (6): one of my least fave MJ songs actually, sorry Jelboo!

#Pot Of Gold

**10footnotes** (11): Praying is getting my 11 in the Ultimate Rate for hopefully obvious reasons, but Rainbow is my other favorite song off Kesha‚Äôs album, and I‚Äôm glad I have the chance to give it an 11 too. Musically, this song is so great: it builds up so well, Kesha sings with real emotion, and I live for violins in pop songs. The lyrics are undoubtedly the best part of Rainbow though. The message of hope in this song is one so many people can relate to and find comfort in, and you know that it‚Äôs completely genuine coming from Kesha. Rainbow is a beautiful, uplifting, and inspiring song, and for that reason it gets my 11.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): WE LOVE A SELF EMPOWERING QUEEN !!!!!!! but seriously that "whats left of my hearts still made of gold" gets me every time <3

**agentofscranton** (10): a beautiful and inspiring song of hope, and if my 11 and entry song were to lose to one, I‚Äôd be happy to see it lose to this

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The most emotional song on the album. I can relate to this song so much and it‚Äôs helped me through some tough times this year. It‚Äôll always be the one song I‚Äôll go back to from Kesha.

**followingfreeways** (10): this song is truly beautiful and would have gotten my 11 if what a feeling wasn't on this list. this is one of those songs that I wish was released just a few years earlier because I know it would have helped get me through so much. god bless Kesha for this song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): I‚Äôm so fucking proud of this girl. So. Fucking. Proud.

**jamesfog** (10): Disney realness

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I first heard Rainbow on an Uber when I was going home from a museum tour. I can't lie and say that I cried when this track came on for the first time, but it's been growing on me, to the point where I find the simplistic melody charming rather than slightly disappointing. Kesha, sweetie, you're doing great. Go on chasing that rainbow.

**rocketgamer31** (10): This is gay

**VeganSquash** (10): what a beautiful song

**zamomattel** (10): THIS IS LIKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISNEY SONG AND ITS NOT EVEN DISNEY

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): Disney soundtracks COULD NEVER

**cyborglilith** (9): glad to have her back

**enecks** (9): I like this song. Will expand thoughts in megarate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is the most extra song in the rate, I remember being so confused by it when it first came out. Kesha is just doing the absolute most, this track feels like it was stitched together from a checklist of everything that you need for a grand inspirational ballad. The soft piano intro, the lyrics, the use of the sweeping violins, the backing choir, the bridge that‚Äôs just her riffing, the way it pulls back to her just accompanied by a piano leading into the orchestra blasting back in with the choir, even the softly lit music video featuring a bohemian Kesha crooning in an artsy studio, it‚Äôs all incredibly by the numbers. Mozerella, provolone, cheddar, munster, parmesan, take your pick this track is pure cheese. And I love cheese. Kesha, luminous goddess that she is, manages to sell what could have been a painfully overwrought track with genuine earnestness.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I'll be honest, not even in the top half of Rainbow's best imo, but still an amazing song!

**LandoFreeman** (9): i‚Äôm so glad she started making good music

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): my pussy is praying

**NegativeFiveBelow** (9): I feel motivated like a beautiful end-credits scene I do want to go paint the world now

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): vocaaaaaaaaals

**awryj** (8): Basically a Disney song

**poppinmolly** (8): I like this version of Kesha.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7.5): strangely motivational, it's an acoustic personal song done right

**dirdbub** (7): I feel like this is a song you can really only fully appreciate in a live setting. this sounds.. kinda flat recorded. still lyrically amazing though

**shineflyer** (7): It's a pretty little track. It isn't perfect, but it's beautiful as is.

#Rain On My Parade

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not an album standout for me, kinda slow and doesn‚Äôt do much for me :/

**Death\_Soup** (6): i just can‚Äôt get into her new music

**SkyBlade79** (6): a bit boring

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): don't kill me this is mediocre

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3.5): my least favorite of the whole album

**gannade** (3): a somewhat pretty song but the autotune ruins it. kesha just isnt a talented enough vocalist to pull off a song like this

#Dancing In The Dark

**bwc222** (11): ok sappy appreciation time. words truly can‚Äôt describe my love for this song. it‚Äôs the definition of euphoric, nocturnal synthpop. right with the song‚Äôs opener, the listener is swept away in bliss. for me, i remember speeding down the highway to this song. i remember sitting with a nice pair of headphones on, just admiring the synths in the darkness of my room. but most of all, i think of my best friend. if there was one song to characterize our friendship, it‚Äôs this one. i had heard the song before, but the first time i knew it by name, the first time it truly struck a chord within me, was after i went to a local carnival with my group of friends on an unusually warm night in may 2013. i was in middle school at the time, and was just starting to explore music on my own with my brand new spotify premium membership. after coming back from the carnival, my friend and i played our made-up game of ‚Äútolleyball‚Äù (a cross between tennis and volleyball) while showing one another our favorite new songs. my friend queued up ‚Äúmidnight city,‚Äù and i suddenly remembered how much i loved the song. it‚Äôs really hard to describe, but this song ties up the feelings of elation, innocence, and exhilaration i felt that night. the beauty of this song is its ability to work in so many situations. as i mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs my go-to song whether i am speeding under the stars, or sitting stagnant in my room appreciating all the nostalgia and e‚Ä¢mo‚Ä¢tions that well up inside of me when i reflect upon childhood memories. it‚Äôs truly something ethereal, something that never fails to send chills up my spine when i first hear the opening synths. for these reasons and more, i chose to enter this song into the rate. do i expect it to finish #1? no. (i mean when should we ever expect popheads to have taste amiright? ¬Ø_(?)_/¬Ø) i just hope that by including this song in the rate, i made at least one person fall in love with it too. now here‚Äôs to hoping y‚Äôall don‚Äôt do this song dirty!

**ExtraEater** (11): yeah since my original assay was too stuffed i'll shorten it uhh... favorite song ever since ive gotten into music, the saxophone is dope and one of the best sax solos/buildups in music, cocteau twins and slowdive and ???????? and all are great but can choke, this obviously won't win but im cheerin for it, this is 80's nostalgia and 2010's glamour all at once, it's gloriously timeless, and it's one of the best things to ever exist. sublime

**shineflyer** (11): This is one of my favorite songs, if not my absolute favorite. I love the distorted voice clip that plays throughout, all the different synths, the sudden sax solo at the end, and also some music theory bullshit that I don't know how to phrase simpler lol. Whoever put this in the rate, thank you so much

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): This song is perfection. Literally one of the greatest songs ever written. How could this song be better? Trick question. It can't. It's perfect for various activities, including but not limited to, afternoon jogging on a summer day, late driving on a summer night, staring at the sky on any given night, and having a deep conversation with your significant other on a Saturday morning. It is perfect.

**agentofscranton** (10): oh my god one of the greatest songs of all time honestly, the soft, dream-like vocals compared with that pounding instrumental, ugh it‚Äôs so fucking good oh my god, this would be such a worthy winner and would be an 11 in literally any other rate fuck

**awryj** (10): This song is going to be included in every 2010s compilation on YT in a couple years (if YT still exists)

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): an ethereal bop.

**c0ns3rvative** (10): It's like a 7-8 in the day but an 11 at night so I rounded up

**cyborglilith** (10): The soundtrack of adolescence.

**dirdbub** (10): giving me "high school freshman who just got into indie and claims that this is the best song to grace its presence on earth" vibes

**enecks** (10): Quite possibly the peak of 80s throwback pop. Just genius in every way, and a sax to rival Run Away With Me.

**gannade** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m2fVWj99x4 *(bero note: :eyes:)*

**jamesfog** (10): EDM perfection

**Kaylaboe** (10): BABY! TAKE ME! TO THE! FEELING!

**LandoFreeman** (10): the nostalgiiiaaaaaaaa it stings

**Mudkip1** (10): what a bop

**poppinmolly** (10): this is on the soundtrack of Warm Bodies, a movie that I love. It's a bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): DA DOO DOO DA DO DOOOOO DA DA DA

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.8): if you‚Äôve never played this in the dark in a car with your old friends at two am driving across the river that cuts your city in half towards the hills to watch a meteor shower two weeks before you all start your first year of college.... highly recommend you try that.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): That saxophone at the end was like sex. I love the electronica vibes in this song!

**dropthehammer11** (8): This is probably gonna win even though it shouldnt. Still, good tune

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): The main musical hook is absolutely iconic, but I think this song is just starting to maybe not hold up? It's still incredible, but it's not quite as much of a banger anymore as it was in 2011

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Can't see the similarties to Paris in this one. Beautiful, but most unfortunately I find it slightly overhyped, so I hope it won't win...

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I've heard this song so many times but literally didn't know who sang it until now, but it makes me super nostalgic

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): omg so that sample is from THIS song ok. it's a little too dependent on that one sample though

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song starts off with that amazing beat and hook but then it proceeds to do basically nothing with it. However this reminds me of that weird liminal space where I‚Äôm in an unfamiliar city with my friend and I‚Äôm sitting in the passenger seat of her car and we‚Äôre driving and it‚Äôs night and she‚Äôs playing something like this and we‚Äôre just kind of vining to it so points for that.

**johnazoidberg-** (7): That synth riff is I C O N I C, can we just get 4 minutes of that synth riff?

**zamomattel** (7): this is obviously good but i don't listen to it very often because almost all the charm is in the production

**10footnotes** (5.5): I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this song. On one hand I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs trying to accomplish, but on the other hand it‚Äôs good I think?

#Say it ain't so, I will not go. Turn the lights off, carry me home

**VeganSquash** (3): I hate when songs have epic instrumentals and production, but then there is a basic ass emo voice that offers NOTHING to the song. Like, hire someone who can actually sing.

**SkyBlade79** (2): this is the ultimate white metrosexual anthem

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): no

**Leixander** (0): this song was playing at every commercial back then and I hate it. Sorry the person who sent this, but I really despise it :(

#Step Up

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): If you‚Äôve ever had a broken heart then I won‚Äôt need to explain this 11 to you, but this song is quintessential. A modern pop classic. That synth creates an amazing lifeblood for the song, it‚Äôs so harsh and cold. Robyn‚Äôs rough voice and desperate delivery is a performance for the ages, I don‚Äôt know how she did it but she did that. This situation that she describes is so specific, yet she managed to capture something so universal with it. I think a part of it is the way that this song speaks to how music helps us not just by lifting us up, but also by being with us when we‚Äôre down. They say when you‚Äôre sad you should listen to happy music to switch the mood up, but this song is literally about being sad in the club and having the depression music be there for you and just letting your feelings out. It is the epitome of a breakup bop because of this. It‚Äôs catharsis if you somehow kept the emotions afterwards. It‚Äôs impossible for me to listen to this song without wanting to cry. Fuck that acoustic sad boy version.

**jamesfog** (11): One of the greatest songs of all time!

**NegativeFiveBelow** (11): The original sad bop, completely iconic to the moon and back, the emotion this conjures up cannot be matched by any other song on this rate. Clear winner for me.

**agentofscranton** (10): I think this was the first in a very long line of songs that really established how much I liked the juxtaposition of the depressing lyrics with instrumentals that encourage you to dance your sadness away

**Elitefourbrad** (10): One of the best songs in this rate, Robyn is relatable here. It‚Äôs better to just focus on yourself throughout life and I love that message.

**enecks** (10): a BOP that influenced Liability

**ExtraEater** (10): one of the most perfect things to exist as of yet

**gannade** (10): The perfect sad dance song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): God if you haven‚Äôt cried to this song for no reason whilst a little drunk are you even a real person with feelings?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of the most highly praised songs of the 21st century, and it seriously deserves it's praise.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): Putting this at the end of an episode of Girls so more people could hear it is the only good thing Lena Dunham has ever done.

**Kaylaboe** (10): ugh, such a gorgeous track. the sad, vulnerability of the lyrics just fits perfectly with the upbeat dance track. this will win.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): overplay did not ruin this for me

**Mudkip1** (10): queen of pop

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): what can I say about this song?? A GAY ANTHEM

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally one of the most important songs of the last decade

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i'm expecting this to win, and it totally deserves it

**zamomattel** (10): hot take: Rujubee's lipsync to this is very eh

**awryj** (9.9): SLAY ME ROBYN, QUEEN OF SWEDE POP. Nonameum Sadd can suck it, his version is shit. I would give it a 10 btw but I like Call Your Girlfriend more :eyes:

**JunkyGS** (9.5): single edit where?

**dirdbub** (9): hopefully not me in the future

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): First time listening to this. It's not quite the perfect bop I expected but it's still pretty close. Robyn's voice sounds pretty unique, but pretty cute at the same time. I like that.

**shineflyer** (9): simultaneously upbeat and heart-breaking - that's my kinda song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): relatable bop

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8.5): damn vibes

**timothy444** (8.5): I've only heard this song once (and that's when I was going this rate) and already it's better than that stupid Calum Scott cover.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): SLANDER ABOUT THE OTHER VERSION WILL NOT BE ALLOWED! THEY ARE BOTH BOPS IN THEIR OWN WAY! WE'RE WHOLESOME HERE!

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8): Raven + Jujubee

**Death\_Soup** (7.5): I never really got into this song but it‚Äôs ok

**10footnotes** (7): I know this song is a favorite, but I just can‚Äôt get fully into it. Her vocals and the lyrics are very good! My problem is with the production: listening to the wrong-key-press sound over and over and over again gets grating. Thankfully, the bridge does break this up a bit.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): here, im gonna say it. this isnt even close to robyn's best. still a bop.

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): This song is missing a spark to make it incredible. I like the lyrics and the production is alright, but it's just what lots of people make it out to be. Overrated.

#No Rhythm In Your Bodies

**rocketgamer31** (5): This sounds like an E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION Side B reject

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i want to like this but it's too mellow. the production is good

**VeganSquash** (5): It's...okay. I think the beat is too generic and it didn't really switch to anything interesting. The lyrics were great though.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): overrated and some parts of it hurt my ears

**LandoFreeman** (2): i love her but i hate this damn song

**SkyBlade79** (2): I will never understand why this is so popular

**cyborglilith** (0): I just really don‚Äôt like this plz no doxx

#You have been banned from participating in r/popheads. You can still view and subscribe to r/popheads, but you won't be able to post or comment.

#Water

**GoWestYoungKanye** (11): This is my first rate despite being around popheads a year and posting for half a year and I wanted to make like everyone (ThatParanoidPenguin, you in particular, you awe me) who does those amazing insightful analyses of the songs involved but I just find myself getting really personal when it comes to the songs I like and the ones I hate and this is going to be a lot of text about...me. I guess I‚Äôll try again in some other rate. This is my song, and a lot of the songs in this rate are deserving of 11s so I‚Äôm gonna take my time explaining this, sorry. I‚Äôm getting ‚Äòpretty girls don‚Äôt know the things that i know‚Äô tattooed next year, so I knew immediately this was the song I wanted to pick. Lorde is really special to me because I‚Äôve followed her since the soundcloud days, we‚Äôre only separated in age by six months and there have been so many coincidences around her and points in my life that are impossible to ignore. I saw her for the first time in October 2014, where she played Yellow Flicker Beat live for the first time. I‚Äôd been listening to it on repeat since it came out and I genuinely cried when she played it, the sun was down and she was dressed all in white and she was so beautiful and ‚ÄòI made a little prison and I‚Äôm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me‚Äô just meant so much to me and I‚Äôd become obsessed with it. Before Ribs she spoke about growing up (as Lorde does) and I was at a very strange point in my life (my senior year of high school) and adulthood was looming and those words brought me to tears too. I was hospitalised shortly afterward in November 2014 for problems with my heart (hello donate to the SADS Foundation popheads!) and I genuinely, for a week of my life, thought I was going to die. My heart went into tachy (over three hundred bpm) six times that week, and I had my first seizure since I was fourteen. I ended up having to have surgery and I‚Äôve been fairly okay since, but I spent a few days in the hospital trying to fix my heart before the surgery and during that time her curated Hunger Games Mockingjay album came out, and I played it on repeat in my hospital room (if you don‚Äôt know this, being in the hospital for more than just overnight is the most boring thing oh my god). I loved Meltdown and the Ladder Song cover. I still do. I still play that entire album way more often than I should, but it was exceptionally high quality for a movie soundtrack. That‚Äôs the magic of Lorde. This song, Magnets, came out a few days after I started university in a foreign country a couple thousand miles from where I grew up. And I had PTSD from almost dying a year before, and I couldn‚Äôt move without being afraid I would die alone in a strange land, and I had to drop out of university for a year to deal with my PTSD, and I listened to Magnets on repeat, over and over again. I made a Spotify account just to listen to it (I was a late adopter and an idiot) because the video wasn‚Äôt out for a while. I was bullied severely as a kid and on top of all my other shit have an eating disorder so that line, the one I‚Äôm getting tattooed on me, ‚Äòpretty girls don‚Äôt know the things that i know‚Äô, means more to me than I can say. ‚ÄòWalk my way I‚Äôll share the things that she won‚Äôt.‚Äô carries so much weight too. When she played Magnets in front of me this year, after I conquered a recurrence of my heart disease (I had my first seizure in two years on the day Green Light dropped, why does Ella do this to me?), she was lit by this beautiful halo from the neon astronaut‚Äôs face and it was like she was preaching just to me. I lived through nearly dying and the fear that came after it and when she came to Glasgow half the world away from the place where I first saw her I touched her hand. So. Magnets is my 11. Sorry this is so long and dramatic. I‚Äôve never really told anyone else about these coincidences and maybe I‚Äôm crazy but I feel like if anyone can appreciate this strange connection I have to her, it‚Äôs popheads.

**10footnotes** (10): A Lorde bop, and that‚Äôs all this song needs to place highly in the rate (whoever submitted this was really gunning for a good rank). Whatever placing it gets is well-deserved though, it‚Äôs a great song. It‚Äôs nice to hear Lorde in a song different from the rest of her discography.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): queen of cheating

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): YASSS LORDE KILL ME, tbh if lorde asked me to help her bury a body i would instantly help her and also girlie is serving looks in the video

**dirdbub** (10): me whenever I hook up with a discreet "bi" male on Grindr and leave a red hand print on his ass

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I honestly have never heard this song before, it‚Äôs a masterpiece. From the great eerie vocals from the Melodrama queen herself and then the amazing production from Disclosure makes this song a bop!

**enecks** (10): By far the best Disclosure song, and up there with Lorde at her peak. It's a immensely catchy yet seductive song with smooth and slick production. mmmm yaassss disclosure scalp my wig and call me salmon pie

**gannade** (10): OK I'm not a big Lorde fan but this dark electronic production suits her so well

**Kaylaboe** (10): invented attraction

**NegativeFiveBelow** (10): Disclosure collabs are just pure sex appeal 1000% of the time

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): she did what she had to do.

**SkyBlade79** (10): One of Lorde‚Äôs best songs ever, and I know a lot of people will disagree about that, but that‚Äôs just what I think. The production is AMAZING, ‚Äúdancing past the point of no return‚Äù is one of the best lines like‚Ä¶ ever‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm just shocked at how good this is.

**strawberryswing1** (10): ok I'll admit I'm a Lorde stan but this song actually is a 10/10. Lorde's sultry voice, these low synths, the lyrics that describe a cat and mouse relationship, the perfect "oh, oh" with the drop...amazing. Also I love the line "pretty girls don't know the things that I know"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The best non-Latch named Disclosure collab

#Fire

**cyborglilith** (9.5): undeniable bop

**VeganSquash** (9.5): Damn, this is a bop.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): it's good but i like the cover by priest more! https://www.youtu.be/Wg28SuX3mUI

**CrispyEggs123** (9): The percussions ooh

**rocketgamer31** (9): Oh my Lorde this chorus bops

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): no offense this will win

**shineflyer** (9): interesting percussion, a great pre-chorus, and that harmony on the chorus like, damn. Lorde's voice is really cool, I don't care what anyone says.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Lorde killed it obvs

**Death\_Soup** (8.9): idk how i ignored this when it came out, thank you for reintroducing me to it. Issa bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Lorde pre-Melodrama is talented, but not my thing, mostly due to the relatively minimalistic production on Pure Heroine. Couple with Disclosure, though, her old style sounds absolutely gorgeous. This track is almost hypnotic, in a sense, which is inevitable when you have a chorus that ends with 'let's embrace the point of no return'.

**zamomattel** (8.5): WE NEED MORE LORDE DANCE SONGS

**awryj** (8): I really like Disclosure and Lorde but somehow this song missed the mark and isn't a 10, and I'm not really sure why. It's very good though.

#Air

**agentofscranton** (7): I go through different phases with this song, I can never really decide if I like it or not, but it‚Äôs definitely growing on me enough that I‚Äôm leaning towards liking it more now

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): ‚ÄúPretty girls don‚Äôt know the things that I know‚Äù Lorde‚Ä¶ I hate to break it to you‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ super pretty. Sorry girl :\ Other than that, I can‚Äôt find much to say about this song. It‚Äôs generally pretty competent, I certainly like parts of it, but it‚Äôs just so painfully ‚ÄúLorde‚Äù in the worst way possible. Like, if you‚Äôre gonna do a feature with Lorde, you can‚Äôt just write a basic Lorde song, give her the chance to flex a bit! A prelude to Melodrama I guess, but there‚Äôs really no reason to ever listen to this instead of a full out Lorde song.

**Leixander** (5): #simpleMaths; lorde is 10, disclosure is 0

#Dirt

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I love Lorde but this song is not that good. I would honestly say the only reason it's loved by so many people is because it was the last Lorde song we got until Green Light

**mokitsu** (3): this song sounds so...awkward? lorde just doesn't work. barely any disclosure to this too

The little song that could! Look at that graph, one it gets on a roll it just keeps climing. I love this song, Boom Clap was great, but I was in love with Charli as soon as I went back through the discography afterwards. I might have to get my signed CD of Sucker out at some point. Oh wait...

#SuperClassy

**Leixander** (11): charli's best song, a real pop perfection. if you are not dancing by the chorus, are you a real pophead? dsicuss

**rocketgamer31** (11): I will never understand why this wasn't on Sucker. I'll be 80 years old and be screaming about why this didn't make it on the album tbh; actual pop perfection. I'll ride with Charli any day, vroom vroom

**SkyBlade79** (11): People have a lot of different definitions of pop perfection, and this is mine. Everything about it is amazing: the way that the trippy production is futuristic yet retro, the frantic but raw chorus, the amazing lyrics‚Ä¶ This is probably one of my favorite pure pop songs ever and it deserves the best.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): I FORGOT THIS SONG EXISTED i remember hearing it before but never associating it with Charli or anything it's an amazing bop and i can't believe it's not on an album

**awryj** (10): "Charli is like a talented version of katy perry?" ~YT comment

**bwc222** (10): charli's best song to date

**CrispyEggs123** (10): Pop perfection, deserved everything

**enecks** (10): There are an awful lot of songs named superlove. Let's be real - poptimism should be less of a Taylor Swift circlejerk and more complimenting unashamedly poppy pop works of genius like this.

**gannade** (10): Charli's best song

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was the song that really got me into Charli‚Äôs music, and it‚Äôs still probably my favorite song by her. I know every word to this song and I will sing if at a moment‚Äôs notice. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like her new stuff, but I miss this pseudo-rock Charli. This is one of the songs that really opened me up to the importance of the sound of the words in a song, not just the meaning. Like yeah, the lyrics to this song make sense and they‚Äôre somewhat poetic, but they just feel so good to sing and sit so right on the melody that they elevate the song.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Fuck me I forgot about this song and honestly how dare I??

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): one of my faves of charli to this day

**jamesfog** (10): Charli brings bops

**mokitsu** (10): This was the perfect transition from True Romance and Sucker, and it's better than most of either album

**strawberryswing1** (10): omg what a bop! chorus makes me wanna dance.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): my pussy is quaking even 4 years later

**zamomattel** (9.5): its charlii babyyyy

**10footnotes** (9): I was pretty neutral about this on my first listen, but after a few more listens it‚Äôs really grown on me. It‚Äôs catchy, and Charli‚Äôs personality really sells the song. The ‚Äúooh‚Äùs in the background are a good production choice as well.

**Death\_Soup** (9): I‚Äôm not a fan of Charli but this song bops

**dirdbub** (9): what a bop! very cute, giving me "desperately horny" vibes

**followingfreeways** (9): this is a really groovy song, it's absolutely nothing like what I usually like and I think that's why I like it so much. this goes hard.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): Shane Dawson is better

**johnazoidberg-** (9): I want this Charli back. You know, the one who was allowed to release music

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Charli is kind of an enigma in my music library, because despite me clearly seing her appeal, from her talent to just how boppy her songs are in general, I don't go out of my way to actively listen to more than two or three of her songs-probably because none of the style's she's tried out so far fit my taste. Heck, I don't even know whether this song was a one-off or if it came from an album. That bring said, I believe that it's living proof that Charli can create fun, mindless songs with just a hint of structural complexity, even without the strict label of PC Music.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): shit the verses are fire and then the chorus is fire too this bops

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): not charlis best but still an iconic

**cyborglilith** (8): BOP but tinashe did it better

**poppinmolly** (8): bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Not one of my favorite Charli tracks but damn does it slap. The beat is really nice, a marriage of True Romance and Sucker, and Charli has a good presence here.

**VeganSquash** (8): I've always wondered why this wasn't on Sucker, its better than half the album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): decent

#SuperHate

**animefangrant62** (5.5): Charli's music is almost always exhausting after the first chorus

**shineflyer** (5): not bad, but it's really not very memorable for me

**NegativeFiveBelow** (4.5): Boys this is not, this is just kinda annoying

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This is not Charli‚Äôs best by far. This sounds like a Disney Channel song mixed with bad PC madness. Charli is great in some songs, but just not this song obviously.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): i hate this and i hate whoever decided to put this here.

Piccprincess: #Honestly, I don't understand the low placement for this score. It's not only one of the most influential songs of the last 10 years, but also better than almost every other flop in this rate. In fact, I didn't give it my 11 because I was scared that this track was so talented that it would surge to the top regardless, and I wanted to give every other track an advantage. Not even making it into day 2? This must be a cruel joke. /r/popheads has failed me many times before but today is the last straw. I have contacted /u/kappyko directly and we have decided to shut down /r/popheads. This slander for good music has gone on for far too long and has been far too damaging to the pop world climate. I'm scared of what will happen if a populace with this bad of taste is able to congregate and thrive as community and frankly, I can't have this go on any longer.

#All The Comments Are Fun!
**LandoFreeman** (11): this song makes me idiotically happy

**agentofscranton** (10): a true iconic feminist anthem

**dirdbub** (10): THAT  SNARE  IS  HIGHKEY  ANNOYING  AS  FUCK  BUT  I'M  STILL  HAVING  FUN

**Elitefourbrad** (10): A song that I‚Äôve always loved. Cyndi gets overshadowed by the other main 80s pop stars like Madonna and Janet, but don‚Äôt underestimate her. This song was pivotal in the sexist community that was going on in the US at the time and the music video is one of the best music videos of all time.

**enecks** (10): A campy bop that I nearly gave a 1 because it reminds me of how much my vocals will never pass

**followingfreeways** (10): a beautiful classic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): This came on the last time I went rollerskating (two weeks ago, twisted my ankle, ‚Äòtwas great) and like every girl just gets so lit to this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Did this song invent misandryna ? Discuss.

**jamesfog** (10): This is too iconic

**mokitsu** (10): easy 10! whew, what a classic.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i can't not give this a 10 this is like. the most pop song of every pop song ever

**strawberryswing1** (10): https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.242796165.5926/flat,800x800,075,f.u1.jpg

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally invented the 80s, feminism, and women. Thank god.

**VeganSquash** (10): feminist icon.

**cyborglilith** (9): such a fun song and unforgettable classic

**gannade** (9): an icon

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Goals? I don‚Äôt know them. Aspirations? Sounds fake. Financial stability? Miss me with that nerd shit. I want one thing, and that‚Äôs FUN.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (9): can't beat the classics (ok you can, but shut up and let them have their fun)

**awryj** (8.8): some little girl from the yt comments thought that this song came out in 2009 because that was the upload date and made fun of how dated it sounded... like, gurl, get some e‚Ä¢du‚Ä¢ca‚Ä¢tion

**Death\_Soup** (8.5): when I think of the 1980s, I think of this song. (time after time is still better though)

**zamomattel** (8.5): as a gay man people assume i see this song as biblical but i think its just really good

**10footnotes** (8): A classic song!‚Ä¶ I wish I had more to say about it.

**BreezySeason** (8): a classic

**Leixander** (8): an amazing song that stood the test of time

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I guess I'm not that fun because I've always found this track to be pretty average tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): fun

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): good but overrated

**dropthehammer11** (7): It's classic but idk kinda overrated? still good tho

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I'm giving this a decent score primarily because of how iconic it is and secondarily because I like how Cyndi turned a sexist song into an empowering one. I can't say it's a song I sincerely like, though. Cyndi's vocals have always been too shouty for me, save for True Colors. It's the main reason why I'm hesitant to listen to She's So Unusual. It feels like mall rat Madonna, but worse. I will concede that she's a wonderful person, though.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): she somehow enunciates worse than ariana

**shineflyer** (6): I've never been a huge fan of this song. Maybe because I'm not a girl, or maybe because I just didn't want to have fun. Has that plinky synth solo always been there?

**SkyBlade79** (6): few song are this iconic

Belinda wins it! And one look at that rate graph should tell you the whole story. This never left the Top 10, and if you take out the first 2 ranks (it had still scored 18/20 bear in mind), it never left the Top 3. Definitely popularised in recent years by Black Mirror, but this song still holds its own as an out and out perfect song. Congratulations!

#The Winner Speaks

**letsallpoo** (10): i didn't originally want to submit this song but i randomly listened to it once and it just...clicked for me somehow. i envisioned it as this beautiful winner of a rate for a great cause, and while i don't really care if it wins, it's become the soundtrack of this particular moment in my life somehow. it's kinda weird to describe and idk what i'm saying tbh
#Welcome To Heaven, Population. 7 Billion

**Elitefourbrad** (11): A CLASSIC! Belinda Carlisle is one of the best pop stars from the 80s. Everyone knows this song from the first second it comes on. Heaven may really be a place on Earth, who knows? Also her voice sounds really similar to Stevie Nicks who is another great star of our times.

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I love how Here Comes the Sun and Heaven Is A Place on Earth are next to each other in playlist-it creates such nice imagery. The song itself continues the warmth of the previous one, but this time, it's more upbeat, more 80s, and, overall, better to dance to.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): LEGENDARY LEGENDARY LEGENDARY

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): honestly this song is iconic. Changed the music industry. It's totally heaven on earth. Also my sister would kill me if I gave it less than a 10

**enecks** (10): I'm a queer woman how the fuck couldn't I give this at least a 10?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): You know DAMN WELL this is an 80's classic.

**jamesfog** (10): Wew, one of the best songs of the 80s!

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): holy shit I remember this from my childhood

**mokitsu** (10): Pure 80's perfection!

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): mmm

**poppinmolly** (10): "maybe I was afraid before, but I'm not afraid ANYMORE" is like the best line

**Raykel** (10): This is the first time I'm listening to the song in full and oooh I did myself a disservice for waiting this long.

**shineflyer** (10): what a chorus. the song's got that 80's reverb atmosphere. and it's got such a beautiful melody throughout the song.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): this just brings back memories of singing this in the back of the car with my family lmao

**zamomattel** (10): this was a tune back in the singstar days and it still is

**Death\_Soup** (9.7): one of my favorite 80s songs. that chorus, so iconic.

**cyborglilith** (9): just amazing.

**followingfreeways** (9): a classic bop???? would get a 10 if it wasn't for the horrid key change at the end

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): You KNOW that sexism is alive and well when mediocre songs like ‚ÄúHere Comes The Sun‚Äù get remastered but this BOP has to sound like it‚Äôs being played through a potato.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): Rating this high on my mom‚Äôs behalf. Love you Mama

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Great classic record, really makes me feel nostalgic

**VeganSquash** (8.5): Yas hump that wall Belinda

**c0ns3rvative** (8): The classic production still sounds great and that bridge leading to the final chorus is so triumphant

**dirdbub** (8): ahhh, the 80s. there's a million songs that sound like this but my god if they don't sound good

**dropthehammer11** (8): A classic jam

**johnazoidberg-** (8): More specifically, heaven is a 364-acre amusement park located in Sandusky, OH. You may know it by its operating name, Cedar Point

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): It sounds dated but it is the good kind of dated

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): the hook is catchy but the rest of it is meh

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): Heaven is a place on earth with you/Tell me all the things you wanna do/I heard that you like the bad girls/Honey, is that true?/It's better than I ever even knew/They say that the world was built for two/Only worth living if somebody is loving you/Baby, now you do

**BreezySeason** (5): this is another my mom really liked and its an okay song but overexposure too strong

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5): Maybe not the orignial earworm-i-wish-wasn't-one, but certainly one of my formative ones

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i'm a good catholic boy and y'all can yell at me for recency bias but i don't like it

#San Junipero

**agentofscranton** (11): I‚Äôd loved this song long before the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, but since that episode this song has developed this new resonance with this little gay boy developing a new belief that love exists and is possible, it‚Äôs absolutely my favourite song of all time and absolutely getting my 11 (sorry to the song I actually submitted)

**gannade** (10): I will forgive Belinda for plagiarizing Lana because this song is a bop and San Junipero is beautiful

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Kelly and Yorkie ended your flop heterosexual healthy same-race ships.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): DAE BLACK MIRROR

**ExtraEater** (9.5): i liked this song but for some reason i started to like it more after october 21, 2016

**awryj** (9): Yeah, I know, it was featured in that Black Mirror episode, blah blah blah, but can we talk about CGYOOMH BEING INCLUDED IN THE 2000S SEQUENCE? I WAS S H O O K

**10footnotes** (8): OOH, HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH. Something about this song just makes me want to belt out that line. By the way, Black Mirror season 4 comes out December 29th! (and I still haven‚Äôt watched San Junipero, why am I even making this reference)
