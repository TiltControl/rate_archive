berober04: #CONTEST TIME

I'm giving away my $40 donation reward, the **public flair** to whoever wins my contest over the 3 days of the rate.

For today, all I need you to do is reply with your answer to the following two questions before the rate starts:

* Which song will be out first on Day 2?
* Which song will be out last on Day 2?

I will tally up how far your song choices are from the real positions, and keep that in record when I ask the same question tomorrow!

I'll post an updated table sometime during the rate of how everything shapes up after Day 1.

First out: Main Girl. It’s going to be a lowkey nobody. You need to be relatively iconic/known to get inflated scores by popheads tbh.

Last out: Craving You. I still think it will be last out today. People like it, but is country enough to miss the last day.

**dirdbub** (8): giving me "scene in Lifetime movie where black woman musters up the courage to leave her abusive husband she's still in love with" vibes

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Cute piano ballad, I like her voice.

**jamesfog** (8): It's cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is like an inversion of the classic (and terrible) “you should leave your current partner and love me instead because I’m better for you” song and I’m down I guess. I too relatable to be pathetically in love, so it’s cool I guess. It’s pretty okay.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): whom this

**rocketgamer31** (7): This song is a cute girl, but unfortunately not my main girl.

**SkyBlade79** (7): this is so nice and smooth

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Reminds me a bit of Bishop Briggs. Nice stuff.

**10footnotes** (6.5): This song is definitely a grower. The personality in her voice also improves it a significant amount.

**zamomattel** (6.5): this is good but every week my discover contains at least three songs like this

**c0ns3rvative** (6): Kind of sounds like a Sia B-side to me

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): We've already had three alt pop girls nobody knows anything about so far and this one is definitely the least interesting. What is it supposed to be? It's fine to listen to, but I can't see how this leaves a lasting impression on anybody.

**awryj** (5.8): It's ok, but it doesn't stand out from all of these bops

#Beths

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5): So many aspects of this just feel like they conflict with one another, I'm not vibing with this

**VeganSquash** (5): her voice is like Florence but the lyrics are too basic.

**cyborglilith** (4): forgettable

**shineflyer** (4): workplace music tbh

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): oh i like this, oh wait no i hate it

#Highest Highs
**awryj** (11): Give Up is one of my favorite albums ever. It's flawless. I want to hug whoever chose this song, and I usually hate hugs.

**Piccprincess** (11): Lamps

**dirdbub** (10): https://i.imgur.com/mWqw1so.png

**ExtraEater** (10): best song from one of the best albums ever. the whole indietronica chiptune aesthetic and dreamy, spaced out city-like vibe has yet to be replicated well (sorry owl city), if at all afaik since chiptune is tragically underused in indie pop

**Mudkip1** (10): ooooo LAWDY LAWD this is a bop with such an iconic music video. owl city who

**NegativeFiveBelow** (10): The entire build on this from the first pulsating noise (I liken it to raindrops idk) is just perfect. And the lyrics are sentimental and cute and self-aware and just all-around great.

**shineflyer** (10): I love how the intro switches between channels, I love the drums, the string-synth, Ben Gibbard's voice in general... I just love this song, okay?

**strawberryswing1** (10): Beautiful, perfect song. Also make sure to listen to the Iron & Wine cover :) https://open.spotify.com/track/4LmKIqPIQOER4KpqJA4eMh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of my favorite songs of all time. Just indie pop perfection.

**cyborglilith** (9.3): Sounds like Lana’s Lucky Ones. Idk which is better.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): This honestly sounds like it could've been produced by jack antonoff

**bwc222** (7.5): wow, this is a pretty timeless song... i don't remember hearing it before and guessed it was from the last 4-5 years, so i was shocked to learn it's almost 15 years old!

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.4): There are some songs that like everyone knows and doesn’t know how they know and this is one.

**rocketgamer31** (7): hello mid-elementary school throwback

**10footnotes** (5.5): It’s not incredible, but it’s a decent song (just my opinion though!)

#Lowest Lows

**Death\_Soup** (5.5): boring

**zamomattel** (5.5): so bitch are you gonna lose my parcel too

**Elitefourbrad** (5): For singing about great heights, this song was pretty boring.

**VeganSquash** (4.5): I would need to get high to really like this song.

**animefangrant62** (4): Where does this postal service operate, Ga'Hoole?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): listen to this: https://open.spotify.com/album/19AxGebIDoa4PrkvuZ2ACZ y'all instead of this boring track

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Ugh I hate this song my family played it all the time and for the longest time this is what I thought of when I thought of popular music so I just refused to listen to it. Fortunately there’s better stuff out there and now that I give this song a listen again it’s not awful, but I have such bad memories of it being shoved down my throat for years. I also really hate this guy’s voice.

**NapsAndNetflix** (3): the voice is nice but this backing beat is too obnoxious to listen to tbh

#You Would Not Believe Your Eyes

**poppinmolly** (8): ngl I thought this was Owl City before I saw who it was

**CrispyEggs123** (7): Is this Owl City?

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I thought this was Owl City at first. Like, seriously. Other then that, it's kind of generic but it's also really infectious. Not the best of its kind, but it does what it does.

#Shine A Light

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is one of my favorite songs ever, I think it’s a front to back bop and it’s the song that made me fall in love with disco. I have an entire dance routine choreographed to this song in my head, never done it in real life but in my head it’s fire. This is just pure joy personified. I think disco gets a lot of flack as a genre for being shallow and fake (an attitude stuck to it partially due to a racist and homophobic smear campaign run against it) but I don’t think that’s a fair assessment. Disco is about immediacy, it’s about energy, it’s an escapist genre. It’s dance music that’s devoted to making you feel good and enjoy the present moment, which can be a tall order sometimes (I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it’s a genre primarily born from outsiders and marginalized groups) and I think that this song captures that beautifully. It’s sort of a cross between “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” and “Shut Up And Dance,” it’s all about the magic of getting lost in the music and in someone else. There are people who argue that the remixes are better but they’re wrong, I think it’s pointless to distort perfection and none of the remixes capture the same energy as the original.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ok this makes me want to go to my nearest roller skating rink and just fucking BOOGIE!

**VeganSquash** (10): Iconic. This is my runner up for my 11.

**animefangrant62** (9.5): OH MY GOD this is pure joy in a song Bruno Mars is shook

**timothy444** (9.5): The remix is better but whatever [2]

**jamesfog** (9): The remix with Jess Glynne is better!

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): nile rodgers should do more pop/EDM stuff

**10footnotes** (8): This has a crazy good beat, I’m bopping back in forth in bed… I might look like a seizing turtle.

**agentofscranton** (8): a groovy bop, I’m glad to see unique from glee is getting work still

**awryj** (8): Carly release CRJ4 pls

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Someone needs to team up with Nile Rodgers and make Confessions on a Dance Floor 2.0

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Jess Glynne makes any song she’s on a bop!

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7.5): Cute groove, cute most things, but the lyrics feel like a TV-movie-musical starring the next generation of aspiring HSM stars

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): remix is an easy 10 you fuckwads but this is still good

**zamomattel** (7.5): I love Alex's voice so much

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Nice song, nice to dance to. My main problem with this one is that I'm not a huge fan of the vocals, and that aside from being a tad more creative, this isn't any different from a lot of tracks I hear when I tune into a crossover station when I'm bored and in the car. Seems very retro.

**rocketgamer31** (7): Pretty funky instrumental and a catchy chorus

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.3): Nothing to say. For once.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): NOT a remix

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): slay me jess

#Blackout

**Mudkip1** (5): i used to love this song but i'm a big fan of either of their voices anymore :/

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): Jess Glynne manages to still sound exactly the same even when there are 3 other people credited in the song.

**dirdbub** (4): I don't remember how this sounds like but it was meh

**shineflyer** (4): tbh this style of disco died for a reason

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): hot garbage

**cyborglilith** (3): not a fan of upbeat but somehow still boring songs like this

**Hogwartsreject1912** (0): Tbh I just really wanted the remix.

#Keys Under The Mat
**agentofscranton** (10): it’s bizarre to me that anastacia never managed to really make it in the us, but europe is glad to have her, and this is just pure pop-rock goodness

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): omfg this is one of those songs that i used to listen on the car with my family and i never knew its name holy fuck thank you so much i finally know it.

**LandoFreeman** (10): she deserved better!!!

**Leixander** (10): ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN WAITING, FOR YOU TO BRING A FAIRYTALE MY WAY

**mokitsu** (10): Wow this brings back childhood memories! Anastacia was an icon

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Ah, isn't this the Disney movie set in Russia? Corny jokes aside, I really like this one-it mixes power pop, Broadway, and even some religious music and creates a fierce show of a bop. My one complaint is that the singers's vocals do take some getting used too, but I think her rough delivery is part of the charms of this song.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): underrated queen

**zamomattel** (10): this is a song of my childhood so i can't give any lower with good conscience

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Surprising bop!

**jamesfog** (9): A VOCALIST, wew!

**awryj** (8.2): If I were ever to release a CD with the soundtrack of my childhood, this song would be the opener. I always called her "Miss Froggie" cause... you know... her voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is kinda a bop actually, but the problem is it’s too long. I got into it but the last minute of the song I was just like “oh you’re still going? Okay.” Her voice doesn’t seem particularly suited for this type of music.

**c0ns3rvative** (7): A nice blast of pop rock angst that follows Alanis' template pretty faithfully!

**dirdbub** (7): she looks like she's just started her meth addiction in that album cover

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Okay I really loved this song and her voice is stunning. I’ve never heard anything from Anastacia before so this was a really welcomed surprised!

**enecks** (7): A versatile but inconsistent vocal performance on top of an instumental that can't carry itself through the whole way.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): the hook is very memorable but her voice is agitating as fuck

**10footnotes** (6.5): I love how dramatic this song is. /u/lassidoggy, I know you submitted this, and I went back and read your writeup while rating this. It’s so depressing that she was successful everywhere except America. At least her talent got recognized elsewhere.

**Death\_Soup** (6.5): honestly I can’t form an opinion on this song, and idk if that’s a good thing or not. One thing i can say is it’s a bit generic.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): sorry rock'n'roll is not my thing, her voice is pretty powerful though

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): I’m trying to remember what Eurovision song this reminds me of. Wait, was this a Eurovision song???

**johnazoidberg-** (6): This sounds like Tina Turner teamed up with a Christian pop rock band

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6): Angry Alanis Morisette over here telling me to get mad with her!

**shineflyer** (6): Queen of Christian rock...? she sounds older than she is

#Frantically Calling The Housemates

**VeganSquash** (6): her voice is too nasally for me

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): what IS this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Long and boring :/ I don’t hate it but it’s really not up my alley and I’m not a big fan of her voice or the instrumentation.

**rocketgamer31** (4): Not gonna lie this kind of sounds like a country-Evanescence reject to me

**SkyBlade79** (4): Don’t love the voice.

**BreezySeason** (2): My mom really liked this song when I was growing up and it was played so much that I really dislike it soz

**strawberryswing1** (1): omg this woman's voice is awful. it's like she wants to be the evanescence singer but without the talent. i can't even focus on any good parts in the song because of it. sounds like a singer in the band that plays at a bar and grill on friday nights.

**dropthehammer11** (10): I submitted this because MORE PEOPLE NEED TO APPRECIATE RB THE KWEEN

**gannade** (10): ok this has a better drop than most edm songs and rebecca kinda slays. i thought it was just okay, but then the song ended and i had a double take. it submerged me in its edm euphoria and i didnt even notice until the song ended, and i felt a little empty.

**Mysario** (10): she retweeted me once she deserves this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): buy foolish on itunes

**cyborglilith** (9.2): BUY RE/BL ON ITUNES

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): the original is better but this is still good

**Elitefourbrad** (9): Rebecca Black has made it a long way since Friday and this song shows her talent!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): OOOooooooOOo this is a good remix here bois

**jamesfog** (9): Ms. Rebecca did not come to play, she came to slay! The Chainsmokers are quaking.

**SkyBlade79** (9): a great drop and even better vocals

**agentofscranton** (8.5): kind of a bop queen of character development

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): QUEEN OF UNDERRATED BOPS!!

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): the drop is kinda dated and annoying tbh

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I always thought Rebecca Black had potential outside of that stupid meme song, and this is proof of that hunch. Pretty good remix.

**rocketgamer31** (8): Rebecca Black making decent music in 2017? Truly a strange timeline we live in

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I’m honestly so amazed Rebecca Black isn’t making trash anymore

**10footnotes** (7.5): Pretty good! The melody in the chorus is nice. I’m probably not the only person to mention this, but it’s interesting to see Rebecca push forward with a decent music career. Wait, oh no, the “hey”s in the background just came in and I am docking at least half a point. Crash Cove, why would you do this, it was going so well.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7.5): It's not particularly inspired, but it's a far cry above the Rebecca Black I know. I am afraid to listen to the non-remixed version though, because I really like the production choices here.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): it's a generic drop but i like it tbh

**VeganSquash** (7.5): amazing chorus

**shineflyer** (7): Can you believe Rebecca Black now sounds like Selena Gomez? Only with a better voice?

**CrispyEggs123** (6): Nice song but that drop is grating

**enecks** (6): Huh Rebecca isn't 100% trash any more

**Hogwartsreject1912** (6): Would've been an easy 10 with the original tbh.

**Raykel** (5.5): Oh my god I thought she was saying "Christ, the great divine" and was comingforthatChristianaudience

#Fall Apart

**BreezySeason** (5): Thought the EP was okay but really don't dig this remix

**LandoFreeman** (4): her vocal isn’t horrible tho

**letsallpoo** (4): hamemr why

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Look, I don’t like Rebecca Black. I don’t think she’s a good vocalist and her presence on a track annoys me, and normally I can at least commend her songwriting skills and her production but these lyrics are painfully banal and this Chainsmokers lite production really isn’t doing it for me.

**dirdbub** (1): this sounds like every single generic future bass remix producers do for pop artists I'm fucking laughing they even have the "YUH" trap sample this is the fucking most hilarious thing to me I cannot deal with this holy ufcking shit I am literally just giving this a 1 out of pure genericness and cash grabbing I cannot deal with this holy fuckING SHIT

#Bet You Wish This Was Out On Day 1...

**Death\_Soup** (8.5): is this the same Rebecca Black who did “Friday”?

**awryj** (8.2): hahha remembr fridey she sux

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): it's better than friday i guess

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): Quick story before I get into this one, my dad is a big fan of Friday (and by extension TGIF, the Katy Perry song, which I completely forgot existed until he brought it up this summer in conjunction with Rebecca Black?). He’s this Buddhist vegan lawyer-law professor genealogy geek and every Friday after a rough week he sends me ‘Friday’ on Facebook Messenger so I have a soft spot for even that hellish song. (It’s catchy too. Don’t come for me.)

**zamomattel** (7.5): Friday>>>>

**strawberryswing1** (7.2): Wow, what an improvement from "Friday"

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): it's alright but it's not quite Friday

#Thinking Bout You

**mokitsu** (10): i love this, jorja's vocals and her delivery, plus preditah's garage production...GOAT track

**awryj** (9.2): I have a weak spot for UK garage so excuse me while I bop

**c0ns3rvative** (9): Jorja's voice sounds decadent over this house beat

**johnazoidberg-** (9): This chorus has some of the best glitch work outside of a speedrun. This is a damn jam.

**LandoFreeman** (9): pussy popping like kettle corn

**VeganSquash** (9): I really liked this! I was dreading there would be a pop drop after the repeated "on my mind", but nope! Thank god.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Bop

**10footnotes** (8): Does this interpolate some other melody? The “Now I’m going wise to your sugar-coated lies” part feels familiar, but maybe it’s just a common melody. Anyway, this is a chill bop and Jorja sings it well.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): I loved the emotion that Jorja was able to convey in her voice in this song. I added this to my Hoe Anthem playlist ;)

**rocketgamer31** (8): Jorja's voice is so smooth and her tone is awesome here

**zamomattel** (7.5): girl deserves better than to be known for Drake songs

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.4): Ooh. That’s really all I’ve got to say. Ooh. She surprised me with that voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song is cool but it really couldn’t hold my attention. Electro-easy listening Guess?

**ImADudeDuh** (7): would be higher, but the vocal chops are so irritating that I had to remove 2 points

**Leixander** (7): Ellie Goulding outsold, outperformed, etc.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7): Good chill vibes, wrong song to do the disjointed-words-as-accompaniment shtick on

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): pretty good, Jorja Smith is very talented, but that little Kiiara effect ruins it

**dirdbub** (6): I just remember annoying vocal chops

**NapsAndNetflix** (6): forever 21 music

#Get Out Of My Head

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): The opening is terrible. There's a pretty good song past that but it's not good enough to stand against a lot of other songs in the rate, so meh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Not super into the vocal chopping here

**cyborglilith** (5): not a fan of the chopped vocals, just like in Ain’t It Me. time to listen to Gold, Kiiara’s top 10 hit.

**shineflyer** (5): would be nice background music. I'm not begging to hear it, though

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): kiiara did the chopped vocals better, stream wishlist on spotify thanks

#The Great Escape

**awryj** (10): QUEEN OF EDM

**jamesfog** (10): Dance club anthem

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): my pussy is twerking

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.1): She’s always been such an intriguing artist, I remember when TiK ToK dropped and it was all we played for a while (as will be established at some point depending on how songs stack up I was like twelve in 2009), just these really dumb carefree sheltered kids who didn’t know anything about Jack and Cokes and Mick Jagger and we loved it. I played it on repeat with my best friend at the time. And then there was Your Love Is My Drug, and We R Who We R then she disappeared. A few years later I heard the stripped down version of Blow, and it’s just haunting, and this song is similarly haunting even with the bass going like that. I love nihilistic pop so much, and I love this girl and I hate that I can relate so much to this hurt.

**agentofscranton** (9): when this song started I thought it was dirty talk by wynter gordon (a true hoe bop)

**c0ns3rvative** (9): Much like the entire Warrior record, this track does such a great job conveying a feeling of youthful invincibility

**ImADudeDuh** (9): If this was released in 2015 as a single this would've totally been a fucking hit.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): As much as I like Rainbow I still think that Warrior is my favorite Kesha album (and honestly the one that holds up better on repeated listenings, Rainbow has too much filler) and this is one of the more impressive tracks for me. She explores a similar theme on “Die Young,” but that song is much more cheerful. “Die Young” is a celebration of making the most of the moment, this song is a tribute to hedonism and escapism in the face of fear of mortality, and it’s lowkey terrifying, but still a banger.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): i never realized i missed 2012 EDM

**Elitefourbrad** (8): I live for Kesha’s screaming vocals on this song! It’s a great dance bop from Warrior, which is SEVERELY underrated tbh.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I enjoy pre-Rainbow Kesha in small doses. I have a few recurring nitpicks in here, such as her vocals getting shouty and relatively forgettable verses, but they don't detract this song from being a bop and two-thirds!

**rocketgamer31** (8): Underrated bop and album

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): where is this party so I can go bc I reaaaaaally wanna like die rn

**10footnotes** (7.5): The production is kind of dated, but in an I Knew You Were Trouble way where it doesn’t affect the quality of the song.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): gold trans am would've been a 10

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not a Kesha track I’m a big fan of unfortunately, dancey but I don’t like the chorus that much.

**zamomattel** (7): kind of a bop but fairly generic

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): she's done better edm-pop

**dirdbub** (5.5): was this 2012? checks album release date this was 2012

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5.5): DAE early 00s club music? Her voice also sounds just so much less refined here than on Rainbow and it makes me appreciate Rainbow more tbh

#Leaving Your Great Aunts House

**shineflyer** (5): honestly just not a standout track from the album

**VeganSquash** (4): never really liked Kesha before Rainbow. Songs like this are so generic and too loud for me.

**Raykel** (3.5): So glad the EDM trend is over.

**cyborglilith** (3): the production is nice, exciting, adventurous, video-game worthy. Kesha’s delivery is just really bad, and the song’s beat and drop are too generic.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): why

**gannade** (1): I hate this basic EDM sound, i'm glad it died in 2012. And the way she shouts "NO ONE IS GETTING OUT ALIVE" gives me the same amount of pleasure as screamo

#Fifty Shades of Yay

**agentofscranton** (10): this is getting a 10 because this song was playing when I had my first kiss literally like last week (but it’ll be over a month when the results get revealed) – didn’t know what the name of the song was so lo and behold I find it here

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.1): every time i see neiked i think "neigh kid" and laugh

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.9): Like literally the most positive ho bop there is and I love it

**10footnotes** (8.5): This song is such a massive bop that I’m going to gloss over how the lyrics are kind of awkward.

**bwc222** (8.5): zara larsson did it better tho

**CrispyEggs123** (8.5): I'm still not a fan of the lyrics but the vocals, music, really made this track grow on me

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8.5): Not at ALL what I was expecting when the first chorus hit ("hit" may be too strong a word), but the choice to make it super chill even after the build is striking and really cool and yes i am feeling sexual now thank you

**poppinmolly** (8): I like the instrumentation but the chorus is a bit lacking for me.

**rocketgamer31** (8): same.

**zamomattel** (8): i love this, but it might have been a 9 if it was the Oliver Heldens remix, now that's a TUNE

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): my friday night honey oh honey

**enecks** (7): this is so not sexy but issa bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It’s nice, but lacking in depth. I don’t think that that’s what they were going for, but for a song like this I think you needed a bit more of a hook, a bit more imagery rather than just “I feel this way.”

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I find myself liking the prechorus and verses here a bit more than I like the chorus, which is delivered weirdly imo.

**VeganSquash** (7): great key change, unlike some other songs cough Perfect Illusion cough

**dirdbub** (6.5): awh someone's horny

**awryj** (6): "I was playling roblox and I was listening to this song and my mom came up to me asking what pizza I would like for my dinner and cause I had my earphones in I had to stop the music and my mom saw the video and I paused it on 2:47 wowwwwww?" ~YT comments

**Elitefourbrad** (6): a sexy bop?

**shineflyer** (6): that bass + that breathy voice = good shit. but it also feels a bit repetitive

#Fifty Shades of Ehh

**mirandacrocsgrove** (5.5): i really never understood this song’s appeal

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): Just say you feel the way that I feel / I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual. These are some of the most problematic lyrics I've heard in a while. I mean the song sounds alright but it's getting a 1 for that shit show of a hook.

#Ooh, ooh ooh ooh been wishin' for you

**timothy444** (11): The sexiest song to have ever existed! Unfortunately, a little sellout band called Maroon 5 ripped this off and made it so family friendly that my local Christian radio station is constantly playing it! Uggghhhh it's so annoying. Anyways, the lyrics and theme are sexual (obviously) and explicit enough to be considered very sexy while not using any actual explicit swear words. It just shows how much you can imply to make someone feel horny over this fricking bop!

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Very good, the high pitched voice was surprisingly very enjoyable and the track is just so fun and casual for being relatively explicit. Also, no shade, Maroon 5, but stop ripping people off.

**jamesfog** (9): I love What Lovers Do!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): maroon 5 eat your heart out

**SkyBlade79** (8): I never heard this song before and purposefuly avoided it but it kinda bops. Doesn’t this sound exactly like “what lovers do”???

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): a maroon 5/sza rip-off!

**ImADudeDuh** (5): it really does sound like What Lovers Do, but What Lovers Do is honestly a better song than this.

#I can be your hero baby
**mirandacrocsgrove** (11): i will choke anyone who gives this a low score

**agentofscranton** (10): I’m surprised tegan and sara don’t get more love on the sub because their discography seems like it’d be right up popheads alley

**jamesfog** (10): Underrated QUEENIES!

**10footnotes** (9): Ok this is a serious bop, definitely saving this one to my library.

**enecks** (9): I'm a queer woman so I'm obliged to give a 9 at minimum

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I love every part of this song except for the chorus.

**shineflyer** (9): This entire album is so good. Tegan and Sara know how to make their voices work together so well.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8.5): Usually listening to Tegan and Sara I get the sense that they are somehow too austere to be making pop music, but for this song only! when they say "we're one and the same" I'm like "okay I believe you where do I sign"

**zamomattel** (8.5): I always like their songs whenever I hear them, I need to get more into them

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Closer is the true queen on this album but this bops as well

**followingfreeways** (7.5): I just don't like tegan and Sara but this song doesn't make me want to die that bad so good job

**letsallpoo** (7): i love them but why do they always sound like they have a stuffy nose

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I've never been able to get into Tegan and Sara, probably because they were the group I needed to listen to back when I identified a lesbian, which...came to a halt after I realised I wanted to be a dude. That said, I can recognise that this song is a bop that appeals to a lot more people than I do, so it gets a decent score.

#You can take my breath away

**awryj** (6.5): I like Tegan and Sara but this was just meh

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): Am I a bad baby bi because I don’t like anything Tegan and Sara have made??

**Raykel** (6): The production is so muddy. I can't hear individual instruments properly.

**dirdbub** (5): I feel like I've heard this a million times before

**rocketgamer31** (5): It feels a little homophobic to give this a low score but I've never been able to get into them

**VeganSquash** (5): This sounds like something that would be played on an NBC show that gets canceled after 5 episodes

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Sort of a bop I live?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): boring, if i wanted to listen to stuff like this i could just go to the nearest street corner and watch street performers playing the violin

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This sounds like a fanmade song that plays over an AMV made by a white person for an anime I’ve never heard of.

#Together Forever
**agentofscranton** (10): 2017 is truly the year we begin to truly appreciate rita

**Death\_Soup** (10): I feel biased cause this is my entry, but what a bop! America needs to wake up smh

**dirdbub** (10): honestly it's generic but my fucken GOD if it's not perfectly produced and Rita doesn't sound great on this then I don't even know anymore

**Elitefourbrad** (10): When I first heard this song, I was so impressed. Rita Ora’s vocals are criminally underrated. Avicii provides a great beat and Rita shines here with her whispery vocals. The drop is great in this song and it’s the best song on Avicii’s EP this year.

**jamesfog** (10): A 2017 highlight!

**Leixander** (10): ahhh I am in love with this song. Rita sounds so great here and even though the drop is really simple it is amazing

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): you see, the main problem with this song is the pitched vocals. i can only tell this was Rita due to utmost 2 instances in her vocals throughout this whole thing. still a mega-bop, nonetheless.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): rita ora is the definition of a flop but this song bangs so hard i can't deny it

**timothy444** (10): Basically, Avicii's 2017 EP has got to be the best EP that has come up this year. I swear this would be my 11 if there weren't so many other great songs in this rate. Rita Ora's voice is just pure :bopgasm:

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): is this europop? avicii has never disappointed me. it's beautiful.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): First short song on the playlist. This is admittedly the first Rita Ora song I've listened to that isn't Black Widow, and it's pretty okay.

**poppinmolly** (9): how have I never heard this bop before???

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i wish avicii would go back to experimenting genres but he still provides us with this bop. avicii and calvin are the only real edm producers that aren't dead and this song just reminds me of how edm is dead

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A transcendent bop from queen of getting her music cockblocked from release, Rita Ora. I love the prechorus and chorus here, and the whole thing just bops for days. The beat in the chorus is so lovely.

**10footnotes** (8.5): This is a nice, chill bop. Rita is great on EDM-lite tracks like this and IWNLYD, and Avicii’s production complements her well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is technically impressive, there’s nothing quite wrong with this track but I’ve heard this exact same song done better, and much better songs on this same topic. Rita Ora, weirdly, was one of the only artists to have two songs in the rate, which I did not expect.

**awryj** (8): Rita strikes me as kinda bland but recently she's had some bops in her repertoire.

**mokitsu** (7.5): Rita's voice sounds super weird, but it's surprisingly good!

**bwc222** (7): a little mainstream sounding, but catchy and a trop pop bop

**enecks** (7): A polished but unremarkable modern EDM song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): I feel like if I rated this any lower Rita would speak to the Home Office and get my visa suspended :/

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7): it's a good beat and manages to sound like an Avicii song without sounding like every Avicii song but I hate hate HATE that they couldn't find a more elegant hook than "let's be lonely together/a little less lonely together" THOSE ARE OPPOSITE THINGS ugghhhhh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I love my man Avicii but he's gotta change it up at some point. This could have easily been released in 2013.

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): not bad but also not that great either

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): a pop girl collabing with an edm producer, dare i say it? http://gph.to/2hhYvfR also i'm so tired of that verse - chorus - drop without vocals that sounds like somebody going tadadady- rest of the song

#I'm Mr. Lonely

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): meh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): scared to be lonely >>>>>

**zamomattel** (5.5): i wish anywhere had been submitted instead but ok

**c0ns3rvative** (5): I like Rita's vocals but the chorus is generic af

**shineflyer** (5): nothing i haven't heard from Avicii before

**SkyBlade79** (4.5): Rather generic, don’t love it.

**gannade** (4): Really basic EDM song

**cyborglilith** (2): super boring and undistinguishable from any other song by a producer featuring some female singer

**VeganSquash** (1): it's generic, has a pop drop, and yet it's flopping? Shows how bad this song is.

#Wolves

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): STOP SLEEPING ON THE KINGS BRASSTRACKS

**dirdbub** (10): Brasstracks is iconic. their "Weight In Gold" remix is amazing

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I love Brasstracks, they definitely deserve more recognition. This song merges the fun energy of jazz music with the slicker elements of electronic music and I really like it, I keep waiting for this combination of sounds to take off because everyone seems to love it but it’s still weirdly niche.

**LandoFreeman** (10): def the best nu edm song in this rate. she sounds like kelis

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): shit this song. goes so hard fuck i'm adding it to my library /u/AbnormalPopPunk i've been anticipating this song the whole time because of your spam comments

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): ooh i love this! whoever sent this, thanks for introducing this bop

**dropthehammer11** (9): A lot of very bouncy bops in this rate! i am happy!

**NegativeFiveBelow** (9): I love the production on this so much, it just feels visceral in a way that a long of songs don't. I want to dance to this, and I have two angry left feet

**rocketgamer31** (9): Okay this is a bop, that instrumental is funky as hell

**Death\_Soup** (8.8): i love this kind of music.

**10footnotes** (8.5): This is a major bop! I love the brass instruments, I’ll try and check out Brasstracks sometime.

**jamesfog** (8.5): This slaps

**mokitsu** (8.5): Wait this is a big bop!

**awryj** (8.4): I detect a bop. I have no idea who either of these artists are though.

**followingfreeways** (8): never heard this in my life but it sounds like it's a Spotify ad. in a good way? I'm bopping to this

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Much like Dye Your Hair, this is a great beat mixed with a couple of generic alt pop elements, but the small EDM influences here kick the score up a notch. It's very, very catchy.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Love the instrumental here!!! So lush and full and fun. The vocals aren’t exactly my thing and they don’t stand out as much but this bops.

**zamomattel** (7.5): this is an absolute bop but the production seems quite muddled

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): an easy unassuming bop, i stan

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Basic ass EDM song. I can barely understand what’s going on. But I’ll still bop to it!

**enecks** (7): A catchy positive song

**shineflyer** (7): I strongly appreciate the idea of a brass themed electronic group. Score got bumped up for that that part where the voice drops out for an electronic "you."

**SkyBlade79** (7): this is quite the bop actually

#Sheep

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): Honestly I completely forgot what this song sounds like when I was going through the final check of this list which is weird considering that it’s pretty damn distinctive. Maybe shame on me and my goldfish memory, but I never rate things I forget high. I like it regardless, so I’m giving it my highest low. If that makes sense.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): lol going from Björk to this is a little tragic but it's not a terrible song

**VeganSquash** (4.5): amazing production, but she's off-key. Or is that her nasally voice? Idk.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): The instrumental was sort of distracting imo.

#Oh wait no these are the wolves

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): this is my song so i'm not allowed to give it my 11, but god do i love it. this song hooked me onto luna's music, it's incredibly catchy and one of her more upbeat songs. you can tell how much care she puts into her production and her voice is something special.

**agentofscranton** (10): of the songs I’m hearing for the first time this is definitely the one I’ve liked the most, I’ll be sure to check out some of her other stuff

**10footnotes** (9.5): I love this! Luna’s voice is so pretty and calming, and it really fits the vibe of the song. 100% checking out her other music soon.

**followingfreeways** (9.5): um I have never heard this and I'm so upset I haven't??? this is GREAT

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Cute, not much more to say about this.

**jamesfog** (8): Cute bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A driving song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.5): Reminds me of a lot of other indie pop songs but it makes up for it with fun lyrics

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Cute little bop.

**rocketgamer31** (7): Nice vocals

**dirdbub** (6): @everyone listen to Crywolf's essential indietronic album Cataclasm, out now on every platform

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6): Nothing exciting within this, but I can pretend to be exploring a ruined city while it underscores me, so that's cool

**shineflyer** (5.5): one of those cases of having so many great things in it, and not knowing why it doesn't work for me.

#And these are the fluffly sheeps

**awryj** (5): generic synth pop

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Generic but in a bad way.

**VeganSquash** (4.5): she sounds like Allie X

**zamomattel** (4.5): the boy who cried NEW SKY FERRERIA

#Seeing skies of blue

**animefangrant62** (10): The definition of a classic

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): this makes me wanna dance with a glass of wine

**gannade** (10): a classic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): The most fucking relatable. My god.

**jamesfog** (10): Nostalgia!

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This C L A S S I C makes us all proud to be dumb. Teach us about love, Sam! Also, a sliderule is for doing algebraic calculations

**Mysario** (9.5): is this the oldest song rated?

**Elitefourbrad** (9): A classic song with classic vocals. Sam Cooke really did invent Soul.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Ohhhhh that's what this song is called! This is a nice simple throwback! It's not the most complicated or super deep osng in the world, but I can't help but gently sway to the beat while this song plays.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Short and sweet and serves major nostalgia

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): aw

**ExtraEater** (8): idk it's good but not even sam cooke's actual best (see Shake or A Change Is Gonna Come), not even the best song called what a wonderful world

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): This is so cute and nothing can take that away from me :)

**poppinmolly** (8): cute!

**shineflyer** (7.5): a very sweet, simple song. i also don't know much about history

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): lmao this man is speaking the truth I don't know shit about any of this stuff either

**awryj** (7.2): slay mama

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): In fifth grade we did this little musical thing for all of the kids in my class and we got put into groups and we all learned a little scene and a song that they rewrote the lyrics to to make them kid friendly and the group that I was in sang this one and now I’m a musical theatre major in college and it sucks so thanks a lot bro.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): “I don’t know much history, I don’t know much about biology” me irl

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): it's cute

**zamomattel** (6.5): this is a little sweet and joyful for my liking

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this song's cute

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): cute

#Think this to yourselves

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Wow, this is bigoted against Ravenclaws. All references aside, I was expecting this to be a cover of the Louis Armstrong one and I was disappointed. Sorry.

**10footnotes** (4.5): Theory: this is actually a song about the failings of the American education system.

**dirdbub** (4.5): my grandpa probably has listened to this song on repeat

**enecks** (4): Optimism is so last millenium

#Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): thank you to whoever entered this i didn't know what i was gonna give my 11 to but this made it easy

**agentofscranton** (10): ayy it’s the song I submitted! I submitted this song because not only is it one of my favourite songs of all time, but also I’ve mentally linked this song to my transition from living closeted at home with my homophobic parents to going to university and finally managing to gain myself a social life, because here at university, I’ve somehow fooled people into thinking I’m a decent person to be around and those people then wanted to be around me and then suddenly I have my very first solid core group of friends who I can rely on and feel comfortable to be out around and be myself, and one time, when my friends and I were on a road trip to the beach, and I played this song on my playlist and everyone sang along, belting the chorus with all our hearts, and it was one of those stupid moments where you kinda feel like you’re in a movie or something? to this day I’ve never really felt as happy and free as I did in that moment, so I constantly find myself turning back to this song when I’m feeling down so, yeah, that’s why I submitted this song, I guess

**Kaylaboe** (10): a bop!

**poppinmolly** (10): honestly I have never heard this bop before and it's amazing where has this been all my life. Whoever submitted this has TASTE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): OMG WHO SUBMITTED THIS IM LITERALLY DEAD IVE LISTENED TO THIS BAND RELIGIOUSLY SINCE THE SMALLPOOLS EP AND I SAW THEM THIS YEAR AND THEY WERE SO GOOD AHHHHH

**cyborglilith** (9.5): wow I love this

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): I love feel good songs like this

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song sounds like a good time, makes me wanna play a video game.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): Some songs are just good and that’s how it is?

**LandoFreeman** (9): a passion pit tea

**NegativeFiveBelow** (9): I have only ever run into this in party contexts, which is quite funny. It's still a total bop though.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): FIFA 14 memories omg a classic

**dirdbub** (8.5): this is exactly what I expect from a band called Smallpools and I am happy that I was right

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): wow that was... in my face

**jamesfog** (8): It's cute but his vocals are a little grating

**shineflyer** (8): i love this song, even if it is a bit trailer-themey.

**Raykel** (7.5): I hate when the chorus isn't as good as the rest of the song.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.4): v catchy

**awryj** (7.3): The verses in this song sound like the verses in Sleepyhead by Passion Pit. I'm suing

**Elitefourbrad** (7): This reminds me of that Treasure song by Bruno Mars beat-wise.

**enecks** (7): my dreams are half surreal nightmares of me being brutally murdered and half me transcending my human form

**10footnotes** (6.5): I can’t think of a comment for this song, so here’s all the words I used way too much in my other comments. <Pretty> <nice!> <Chill> <production> <song>. <Check out> <good> <love> <vibe>. ^^^<Listen ^^^to ^^^Leo ^^^Rising ^^^by ^^^Karmin>.

**rocketgamer31** (6): it's upbeat and okay but that's really my only comment on this tbh

#Who Are You To Disagree

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Kate Bush is...not shook. Not shook at all. This would have been good if the voice wasn't an instant turn-off...sorry.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): this sounds like 2008

**zamomattel** (3.5): sounds kind of like a more mediocre Mika, and i definitely don't like that

#Body Positive

**c0ns3rvative** (10): This track is basically the best that this style of maximalist early 2010s EDM has to offer. The hooks are just massive and Christina's belts sound fantastic over the Max Martin production

**dropthehammer11** (10): This is a fucking BANGER of EDM pop, seriously underappreciated

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Christina shines on this track so much! It deserved all the success that it sadly never got. The production is amazing on this song and Christina’s vocals are the best I’ve heard in awhile, certainly better than they are now.

**gannade** (10): If only I had another 11... This song was supposed to be Xtina's comeback and the GP ROBBED it.

**jamesfog** (10): This deserved to smash

**Leixander** (10): why was this not a hit?!?!?!?!

**mokitsu** (10): que HINO! xtina delivered pop perfection and we paid her dust!

**strawberryswing1** (10): pure pop

**zamomattel** (10): the word bop was invented for this song

**Death\_Soup** (9.7): oh hell yes. what a goddamn bop. deserved better

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): lol i can't believe i forgot this song exists i haven't heard this in literal years

**cyborglilith** (9): Lotus was the first album I listened to in full. It was bad.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): I can't believe Christina invented murder and sex in the same video.

**LandoFreeman** (9): screamtina dirrtylera snapped

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): “Let There Be Love” is a better lead single IMO

**SkyBlade79** (9): This is like my favorite Christiana song ever. However it IS kind of rapey

**awryj** (8.5): The production is kinda jarring but it's a banger

**enecks** (8): Yep this is the maximalist early 2010s pop that is my guilty pleasure. Is it overblown and unsubtle? Yes, but it has a PUNCH to it that is so rare in mainstream pop these days.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I poke fun at Christina a lot (she’s kind of an easy target) but honestly every time I hear one of her songs I like it… I need to listen to one of her albums these days because she turns out some bops.

**rocketgamer31** (8): Underrated sex bop from everyone's fave oversinger

**dirdbub** (7.5): I honestly thought this song was sung by someone else and honestly I still do for at least the first verse every time I listen to this song

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): not as good as candyman

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): I can already feel certain users screaming but I’m just not that into her voice. This seven is for how catchy this song is.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): It's like the precursor to Into You...but with obnoxious early 2010s prduction instead. Okay, I may be a Britney stan, but this is one of the only post-Keeps Getting Better songs people who aren't huge fans of Christina can stand, and despite the forced belts and datedness of the song, there's still a reason for that. Fix a few of that stuff and it's bordering on an anthem.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): it's pretty fun but not something I would wanna listen to a lot

**VeganSquash** (7): queen of eating oreos and screaming

**10footnotes** (6): It’s decent, but at the same time it’s SO LOUD. The verses are much better than the chorus for this reason.

**shineflyer** (6): this honestly feels like it could have been a Gaga track. Not a great Gaga track, but... I still wouldn't mind it on the radio.

#Bodied.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Not one of my favorite Christina songs, and the synths really didn’t age well.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (3): ohhhh xtina...this sounds embarrassingly 2012 and embarrassingly 2003 at the same time and that's not a good look

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): why did you do this to yourself xtina, also WHERE IS THE ALBUM XTINA WHERE IS IT?

**ExtraEater** (2): no artist has ever been more 'i don't care' for me than christina aguilera

# Don't Pick Up The Phone

**agentofscranton** (10): petty in all the best ways yas

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I love that this song shades ZAYN’s sex abilities lol. But nonetheless this is one of Little Mix’s catchiest songs ever and I live for them. Perrie really shines here, along with Jess. Flop Harmony is shaking!

**followingfreeways** (10): such an uplifting bop, anyone can relate to this, my 14 year old sister bops to this, I bop to this, my mom bops to this. "I hope she gettin better sex" is ICONIC and no one can tell me otherwise

**gannade** (10): Local Mix managed to make at least one bop in their career

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song always takes me back to the time when I had just broken up with my first boyfriend and I was just getting into pop and this song popped up in my recommended videos and I was like “what’s this” and then I played it and I was just so fucking EMPOWERED! I don’t care if this song is petty or whatever, he left you, fuck that guy! I wanna drive off into the vibrant, multicolored horizon with my best gal-pals and just kind of complain about how men are shit. But on a deeper level, what really makes this song work as a breakup jam is that it’s specifically from the point of view of someone who is past the pain of the breakup and can now reflect on it peacefully. I listened to this song and I felt like I was gonna get through the pain and I knew that I was gonna be stronger because of it. And I am! And now I’m a Little Mix stan! It’s silly, but I don’t hesitate to say that this is a song that really helped me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yeah, it sounds a LOT like Ugly Heart, but it's a bop and honestly improves on Ugly Heart.

**jamesfog** (10): Pop perfection!

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This was the song that introduced me to Little Mix and holy mother of fuck does it slap. #TeamPerrie. Also when I first learned about Little Mix I thought her name was Pierre so I'm still waiting for an all frenchman reboot of Little Mix

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): shout out to my non-existent ex!!!!

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): whew local’s mix’s best song

**poppinmolly** (10): a BOP and a HALF omg I wanna be best friends with whoever submitted this.

**timothy444** (10): Wouldn't it be hilarious if Fifth Harmony sang this instead when Camila left? haHAA

**enecks** (9): This is a great song. Remind me why Fifth Harmony is more popular?

**Mysario** (9): thank you based Glory Days

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Biggest problem with this are the verses, which, while good, are hampered by the relatively lowkey melody in comparison to what a huge triumph the chorus is. The chorus, however, as I mentioned, is amazing. Easily one of the best of 2016. Screw you too, Zayn, honey.

**dirdbub** (8.5): hopefully not me in the future

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.3): I too had my heart broken by Zayn Malik. This chorus makes all my friends so happy and I love it when my friends are happy and I love them.

**10footnotes** (8): Shout out to whoever submitted this: we’re finally rating a Little Mix song! This is not one of their very best tracks (let’s be real, this was only a lead single because of Zayn), but it’s still a fun, lighthearted song.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): this is my first listen but issa bop

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): is cute, also they recorded the video in my country

**c0ns3rvative** (8): It's not too impressive of a song when broken down but all the girls deliver their vocals with a really fun sense of spunky confidence that lifts the track higher than the sum of its parts

**Kaylaboe** (8): i love the refreshing lyrical take on this!

# Don't Let Him In

**rocketgamer31** (7): Looks like Little Mix followed Dua's rules

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): It’s no Touch but I’m a sucker for Little Mix

**awryj** (6.8): why are thoe tree blue

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6): Much as I appreciate the statement of the thesis right away, the production and the heavy breathing and squeaks are not doing it for me, nor does it get that much better when the chorus arrives

**Raykel** (5.5): It's not bad, I just have nothing good to say about it.

**VeganSquash** (5): it's meh.

#Don't Be His Friend

**LandoFreeman** (4): i love a good ol petty “fuck you and that new bitch” song but this ain’t it

**zamomattel** (3.5): ok i love little mix, but i think this is mediocre at best & have to dock points for ripping off GRL and the much superior Ugly Heart

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): ok you're pretty. your face is a work of art. your smile could light up new york city after dark. ok you're covergirl pretty, stamped with a beauty mark. but what a shame that a girl so pretty, has an ugly heart

**cyborglilith** (2): too happy and manufactured for me. it sounds like it would be played at a high school party, but that’s just a guess

**shineflyer** (2): if we're trying to prove that Little Mix is good, this really isn't making a good case.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): I almost wanna give them credit for making such an uninspired, shallow, boring, worthless, cliché, forgettable song. They only get one point for making a catchy hook (even though it's the annoying kind of catchy bc it sounds like shit).

#Counting Down Until We Say Hello



**ImADudeDuh** (11): I remember being blown away by this song since it first came out. This is seriously a country pop song for the ages! Thomas Rhett can seriously become a great pop hitmaker, especially since he's been practically making pop music, ESPECIALLY on Life Changes (it has an EDM song for pete's sake!) Either way, this song is a major bop with one of the most extra videos of the year that I eventually grew to love so much.

**agentofscranton** (10): I kinda wish maren had a bigger part in the song, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that this song is fucking great and easily a 2017 highlight

**awryj** (10): Whoa, unexpected pop perfection. I thought that the mv was an trailer. Such a cool concept. Zayn wishes.

**dirdbub** (10): me before Thomas Rhett: listen guys, country music in general is just bad. I can't figure out why everyone loves this stuff so much it's just so trash | me after Thomas Rhett: YOU'RE LIKE THAT CIGARETTE THAT SHOT OF 100 PROOF NO MATTER HOW MUCH I GET I'M ALWAYS CRAVING

**dropthehammer11** (10): YEEHAW MOTHERFUCKER

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Thomas Rhett is a daddy and Maren Morris is a country legend.

**ExtraEater** (10): iconic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): This ten is all for Maren. I got sent back into my own country roots (like Taylor should be :meghan:).

**jamesfog** (10): Country pop perfection!

**letsallpoo** (10): a GAY ANTHEM

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): These are country people, right? I'm shook the r/countryheads invasion is coming jk this is actually a great song

**poppinmolly** (10): a bop. Daddy Rhett slays.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): wow i guess im republican now

**TragicKingdom1** (10): we need to rate Hero at some point

**10footnotes** (9.5): Wow I love a song about robbing a bank??? Is this song about capitalism??? Has Thomas Rhett compulsively gambled away all his money and now needs to rob a bank to get his fix???

**followingfreeways** (9.5): could be more but maren's voice annoys me. if it was just Thomas Rhett and all his glory, he would get a 100 in my book.

**Kaylaboe** (9): cute country bop!

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): my parent s collaborated im crying

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): /u/ letsallpoo

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): r/countryheads

**cyborglilith** (8): wow this is great, but Maren needs more presence

**CrispyEggs123** (7.5): This is 80s flavored country-ish pop, I like this way more than I should. It's a bit generic but still a solid song.

**zamomattel** (7.5): i definitely like the verses more than the chorus

**Leixander** (7): :yeehaw:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): shout this is actually good. especially the verses and prechorus. this is pretty much a pop song if it wasn't for the subject matter

**SkyBlade79** (7): this actually kinda bops

**Death\_Soup** (6): as far as country goes it ain’t bad. as far as country goes

**shineflyer** (6): needs more maren, but she's still here, so it's okay.

#I ain't got no patience

**rocketgamer31** (4.5): This sounds like that country-pop noise that I stay far away from

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): the country guitar kills everything i like about this song

**NegativeFiveBelow** (4): Totally bland pop country...cool! Next?

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Country music? Sung by men? Not in this house of god.

**VeganSquash** (2.5): Maren feels tacked on, and the country accents are disingenuous and fake af. Not to mention the lyrics are cornbread.

#Naptime

**gannade** (11): How I feel about /u/ napsandnetflix . Thomas Rhett is hot, Maren Morris is talented, and this video is an Oscar winner.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): is this nap's song?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): it's good for a country song (also Naps and Netflix we all know you submitted this)


**NapsAndNetflix** (11): I remember when thomas rhett started teasing this song in march and i was like oh hype. Then it was announced Maren Morris was on it and I was like wow the collab I never knew I needed, both artists are consistent 11’s. It came out and I was blown away. Everything about this song is absolutely incredible. I went to a country bar later that week and drunkenly tried getting the DJ to play it - but he wouldn’t. There’s a video somewhere of me in a cab on the way home muttering how the DJ was trash for not playing craving you because it’s the best song ever. Well, it turns out I was right and that DJ was absolute trash because the song went to #1 on the country charts. This song is genuine perfection and after 9 months I still listen to it somewhat regularly and bop hard every time. Maren wasn’t even in the song originally, but her vocals bring this song to a whole other level and slay me every time. I’m so happy /u/ poppinmmolly submitted this song to force people to actually listen to it and be blown away by how perfect it truly is. deadbanana

#Sugary Sweetness

**animefangrant62** (11): Sonic sex from start to finish

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): One of my favorite songs ever. Everything from the drummed up delivery to the beautiful release makes this just indie rock perfection. I found myself curled up in my bed listening to this song on dark lonely nights. JUST STAY THEREEEEEEEEEEEEEE

**agentofscranton** (10): an orgasm in musical form – a masterpiece in production and those soaring vocals are so fucking good damn

**dirdbub** (10): is this Radiohead

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Makes your chest ache in the best way. And amazing to scream in a crowd with people you adore.

**Mudkip1** (10): aaaaa i forgot how much i loved this song

**NegativeFiveBelow** (10): "Songs of desperation/I played them for you/A moment, a love" takes me right back to being small and awkward and making mixtapes to express my ~feelings~ and this is one of the best songs for rekindling that feeling full stop

**awryj** (9): So good.

**ExtraEater** (9): a song with those opening chords needed to exist and im glad this song took them on

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): this song makes me both happy and sad at the same time and I'm not sure why

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): I'm getting too tired to write comments but this a bop

**zamomattel** (8): the song that launched a thousand like 'Best of 2009' videos

**mokitsu** (7): not as good as i remember it

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Was this song used in a car commercial? I think I’ve heard this.

**shineflyer** (6.5): this is an 80's song in disguise, and I'm down with that.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): i'm shook

#A little bitter

**Elitefourbrad** (6): The beat was sweet here, not so much on the vocals.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I've...already heard songs like this about five times in this rate, so it only gets a 6.

**10footnotes** (5.5): I keep confusing the title of this song with Sweetest Devotion by Adele (which tbh is not one of the standout tracks on 25, go listen to All I Ask instead. Why have we never rated an Adele album?).

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.5): it's ok but it doesn't stand out

ThatParanoidPenguin: Honestly, I don't understand the low placement for this score. It's not only one of the most influential songs of the last 10 years, but also better than almost every other flop in this rate. In fact, I didn't give it my 11 because I was scared that this track was so talented that it would surge to the top regardless, and I wanted to give every other track an advantage. Not even making it into day 2? This must be a cruel joke. /r/popheads has failed me many times before but today is the last straw. I have contacted /u/kappyko directly and we have decided to shut down /r/popheads. This slander for good music has gone on for far too long and has been far too damaging to the pop world climate. I'm scared of what will happen if a populace with this bad of taste is able to congregate and thrive as community and frankly, I can't have this go on any longer. It's been a good run, but goodbye /r/popheads.

#Remind Ya

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): lmao @ when i saw cupcakke and everyone was gay and went AWFFF

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): holy fuck is it catchy, and a great message to boot. only cupcakke

**cyborglilith** (10): Ok first of all, that video is great. CupcakKe shows her caring side: she isn’t just some dumb slut. Whereas many popular artists don’t really advocate for lgbt because it’s controversial, she and Gaga are truly legends for their support. Also, this sick beat.

**Death\_Soup** (10): conservatives are shook. bussies quaking

**Elitefourbrad** (10): CupcakKe is a legend, and I don’t think very many people realize that in the world. She is a great rapper that spits bars faster than I can say “hi”, and she always has great production to rap over. Here she brings a LGBT+ pride song to life, where she shouts out all the communities and even has drag queens kissing the video. Don’t sleep on her when she gets big one day, trust me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The one true ally. LGBT stands for “LGBT (is) God Bop Tier.” I like this song because it really feels like a celebration of the LGBT community. Songs like “Same Love” annoy me because they’re very “hey, gay people… it’s okay that you exist, you don’t have to want to kill yourself” and I’m just like thanks, I already knew that? Whereas Cupcakke is just like “yeah y’all are fabulous and I’m here to turn up the party!” And I’m just like “thanks.” Arguably her best song so far.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): I’M ROLLIN WITH THE LGBT!!!!! I played this with my straight Christian flatmates in the room and almost came out it’s that empowering.

**jamesfog** (10): An actual gay anthem! Queen!

**SkyBlade79** (10): This is amazing, and probably Cupcakke’s best song. THIS is how you be an ally. “shout out to the bis you ain’t gotta pick a side” is amazing. I love this woman

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy has immaculate taste

**VeganSquash** (10): The Born This Way remix is 1000x better, go listen to it

**enecks** (9): Cupcakke was always wasted potential to me. A genuinely talented rapper content to tread familiar sex rap ground. Yet, LGBT was the track that began the increase of quality and respect Cupcakke had. On top of a fantastically energetic poppy beat, Cupcakke's lyrics are a campy embrace of what makes the LGBT community so great. Only reason this doesn't get my 10 is that it doesn't actually talk about the trans community - you know the T in your fucking song title.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): iconique

**rocketgamer31** (9): Queen of queer representation, when will your fave

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.9): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular

**followingfreeways** (8.5): this is surprisingly very good since I usually don't like cupcakKe

**dropthehammer11** (8): This is actually pretty dope, idk what i expected, but not this

**Kaylaboe** (8): invented gays

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): i love her i love her

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): what the fuck did i just listen to

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm too young to listen to the vast majority of Cupcakke songs and given their subject material I have no intention of doing so. But I can understand why this is perhaps her earliest song that people love non-ironically. Hearing support for our community in hip hop songs is refreshing, and to her credit, Cupcakke actually mentions bisexual people, which is great, though I'm a bit sad trans and ace people weren't mentioned here.  Other than that, it's really cute.

**zamomattel** (8): I love my girl Cupcakke i mean what a queen

**awryj** (7): Gaga shook

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): it's good but also memes, honestly this makes me emo it's so unabashedly gay and not in a pretty, modest way, it's gay in a guns out blazing screaming and making a scene kind of way and i'm 10000% here for it

**ExtraEater** (7): exotic

**letsallpoo** (7): bts lost

**sasuke-lp** (7): not bad! her flow is sick

**strawberryswing1** (7): why does this have a Chinese instrumental??

**BreezySeason** (6.5): I don't really like this as much as some other Cupcakke stuff but it still bops

**bwc222** (6.5): i wish this song was longer... it ends a little abruptly and it's v repetitive, but still catchy as hell and an inclusive bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Sorry, just not for me!

**shineflyer** (5): cupcakke has been among us all this time

#I'm Kinda

**Mudkip1** (4): love the message but don't like the song

**poppinmolly** (4): honestly not a big fan of Cupcakke even when she's not memeing sorry Doc :emofish:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i can't believe i'm getting into details of this but the hook is pretty dumb imo and her flow is off. female pitbull with shock factor.

**10footnotes** (3): I have nothing against Cupcakke as a person, she seems very genuine, but I’m just not into her music. Lyrical high: “good hygiene,” because it’s important. Lyrical low: the line about poop, because why.

**dirdbub** (3): to be rude and entirely dragged this song is pandering with a catchy chorus

**mokitsu** (2.5): Cupcakke doesn't represent me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): the beat is ok but it's ruined by the least talented human to ever be stanned on r/popheads

#This comment was too long for the post, so Whale gets singled out

**AFlyingWhale\_** (11): This piece is absolutely brilliant - the experience of the audience is solely dependent on ambient noise, and therefore the audience themselves. I went into this piece knowing what to expect, playing it 3 times in a row, and never once was I disappointed. On my first listen, at 1:41 I heard my heartbeat through my headphones (I use IEMs) for a few seconds; it happened again at 0:37 during my second listen, only this time it lasted about 20 seconds. My mom laughed at 3:14 during my second listen for a yet-undetermined reason. During my third listen, I looked up and cracked my neck at 1:50. Throughout, my listening experience was colored by many constant, ambient sounds - my breathing, the blinking of my eyes, the wall fan, the TV in the living room - and every playthrough was unique. Just to be sure, I listened to it once more on my phone speakers. It sounded much louder than previous playthroughs, truly a testament to the versatility of this composition and also the strong noise-isolation of my headphones. This piece led me to think: did John Cage or the performer create music? Or do I create music merely by existing? Everybody listens to the same piece, yet we each experience it differently. Overall, I was wowed by this track and its incredible tendency to create controversy. Thank you to the person who submitted it.

berober04: Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, I had gotten two songs the wrong way around. This means that The Great Divide is actually in 34th, and On My Mind was 35th. To account for that, have some more graphs!

cyborglilith: I REALLY did not expect LGBT to go out today. First of all, it's a bop, and secondly, /r/popheads can relate to it. I don't know what went wrong. :<
