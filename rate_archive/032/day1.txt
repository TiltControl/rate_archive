[RATE REVEAL] Charity Rate Day 1: Hide Yo Kids Hide Yo Bops
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7ljqev/rate_reveal_charity_rate_day_1_hide_yo_kids_hide/

Hey guys! MistletoeBer here, and let's get revealical! I've got 20 songs to get rid of today, and we're gonna count 'em down together!

Couple notes to be aware of today:

* I'll be revealing songs 59-40 today
* We had a truly humbling 72 people participate in the rate. Thank you to all of you, especially the ones who sat on their scores right to the end, I'm really just glad so many voices were heard.
* The average average score for the rate was 7.0910
* The controversy average score was 2.0437
* Come make a mess of [plug/dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/), myself and /u/leixander will be revealing as we go along!
* I had an arse kick of a week at work, and so write ups on my side will be kinda sporadic. Apologies in advance for that one, but /u/imadudeduh has graciously offered his opinions on some songs as we go along, so look out for his writeups in the post.
* To make up for that, I've got a couple little statistical tricks up my sleeve, which I'll announce a little bit before the rate begins.
* Just to be clear. I'll also be revealing who submitted which score as it goes out. This rate was done in the name of fun, any trolling or abusing over songs won't be tolerated. It's fine you gave a song a 0, but don't let that extend to the person behind the song, okay?
* While I've done a rate reveal before, that was a joint effort with Kaphox, who did much of the heavy lifting. Bear with me as I do this one, fingers crossed the only mess are your opinions on the scores!
* Rate starts at **4pm EST**

berober04: #ALSO. It's contest time!

I'm giving away my $40 donation reward, the **public flair** to whoever wins my contest over the next 3 days of the rate.

For today, all I need you to do is reply with your answer to the following two questions before the rate starts:

* Which song will be out first on Day 1?
* Which song will be out last on Day 1?

I will tally up how far your song choices are from the real positions, and keep that in record when I ask the same questions for tomorrow and Sunday!

deleted: ¿Qué cojones acabas de decir de mí, puto enano? Te voy a hacer saber que me gradué entre los mejores de mi clase en los Navy Seals, y he estado involucrado en numerosas incursiones secretas en contra de Al-Qaeda, y tengo más de 300 muertes confirmadas. He sido entrenado para guerra guerrilas y soy el mejor francotirador de todas las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos. No eres nada para mí, sólo otro objetivo. Te eliminaré con una precisión que nunca se ha visto antes, recuerda mis malditas palabras. ¿Crees que puedes decir que estas mierdas de mí a través de Internet y librarte? Piénsalo de nuevo, hijo de puta. En estos mismos momentos me estoy poniendo en contacto con mi red secreta de espías en los EE.UU. y tu IP está siendo rastreada en este momento así que prepararte mejor para esta tormenta, gusano. La tormenta que arrasará con esa cosa patética que llamas tu vida. Estás muerto, hijo. Puedo estar en cualquier parte, en cualquier momento, y te puedo matar de más de siete mil maneras, y eso es sólo con mis propias manos. No he sido sola y ampliamente entrenado en combate sin armas, pero también tengo acceso a todo el arsenal de la Marina de los Estados Unidos y lo voy a utilizar a fondo para eliminar tu culo miserable de la faz del continente, pedazo de mierda. Si sólo hubieras sabido qué castigo impío tu pequeño comentario "inteligente" estaba a punto de hacer caer sobre ti, tal te hubieses callado tu maldita lengua. Pero no podías, no lo hiciste, y ahora está pagando el precio, Maldito idiota. Cagaré furia sobre ti y te ahogaré en ella. Estás muerto, chico.

Here's a fun little note, if you click that Rank Graph above, you'll see that this song was in last place for **the entire rate**. Congrats Farrah, you've set an unbeatable record!

*Dude: On My Own is a song not by someone we'd think of as a singer, Farrah Abraham, one of the stars of MTV's Teen Mom. Her album "My Teenage Dream Ended," is a divisive one to say the least. However, that didn't stop it from getting it's [own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7458ou/discussion_its_time_we_stop_sleeping_on_farrah/) praising it on r/popheads! On My Own is a song that deals with the sadness of being a single mother after losing your husband. The song uses a lot of autotune and some interesting synth production. Sadly, many people couldn't get through those to see the lyrics, leaving this song in the dust on day 1.*

#You're Not Alone

**Hogwartsreject1912** (11): This song. THIS SONG. This song uses a method in which she distorts every bit of her vocals with autotune and uses mediocre songwriting to express regret about her actions, and it works.

**jamesfog** (10): This song is part of the "outsider" genre and is actually a lyrical masterpiece about post-partum depression and her daughter's father's death.

**letsallpoo** (10): i love OUTSIDER ART

**mokitsu** (10): farrah did THAT. emotional lyrics, emotional delivery. truly an amazing song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): what the fuck was that

**LandoFreeman** (6): had no idea she’d attempted music. i like the instrumental but she ruins it. i’ll def be playing this to death within a week

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): blowin' did it better

**cyborglilith** (5): this is weird

---

#Leave Me Alone

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): I’m so unsure how to rate this track. I mean, on the one hand, like, I get what it’s going for (exploring the cold, manic confusion and isolation that comes with living a life like she’s had) and it’s kind of cool in that regard, but ultimately it’s entirely aesthetically unpleasant.

**timothy444** (3.5): The vocals just ruin this. Sorry.

**Elitefourbrad** (3): Autotuned mess that shouldn’t have been in this rate in the first place.

**enecks** (3): u wot m8

**mirandacrocsgrove** (3): why

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): I'll say this much-this is good for an ironic listen, since the concept of somebody detailing the struggles of teenage pregnancy via a generic beat coupled with some autotune crosses So Bad, It's Good territory. But am I one of the people who could stand to do such a thing on a regular basis? No. Could I become one of the people who actually like this song? Absolutely not.

**dirdbub** (2.5): me when I'm drunk and crying over a boy I have a crush on

**AFlyingWhale\_** (2): i heard about her backstory but this isn't my thing

**BreezySeason** (2): this song is pain

**Leixander** (2): :despair:

**sasuke-lp** (2): WTF?

**10footnotes** (1): why

**awryj** (1): This is really nightmarish. It sounds like the music for one of those viral creepy videos. Like, the scare factor is so high that I can't give it a 0. There's some value in this thing.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): holy fuck what is this production this hurts, is she even trying to sing?

**CrispyEggs123** (1): wtf no

**gannade** (1): /u/ mokitsu PLEASE.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): yeah I couldn't finish this.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): i feel bad giving this a low score but. i don't like it

**SkyBlade79** (1): this is total trash, sorry… the beat is generic, and I find it funny that if this had a metal instrumental, it would be redditcore.

**strawberryswing1** (1): Fuck Farrah Abraham forreal.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): can you believe someone listened to this and thought "yeah, that's good enough, let's release it"

**VeganSquash** (1): Friday is a masterpiece compared to this trash

**agentofscranton** (0): I feel like if there were better vocals, better production, and someone to just polish the lyrics a bit, this could be a tolerable emotional song considering the subject matter at hand, but as it stands, I could barely get through it

**bwc222** (0): this might genuinely be the WORST song i have ever listened to

**c0ns3rvative** (0): No

**Death\_Soup** (0): what

**dropthehammer11** (0): yikes. I rated a song thats pure silence ahead of this

**followingfreeways** (0): oh my god.... I was going to give my zero to dare to be stupid but this even worse and I can't believe it. dare to be stupid is a 10 compared to this

**GoWestYoungKanye** (0): Fuck this song and fuck Farrah.

**johnazoidberg-** (0): I just made popcorn and my pussy is an unpopped kernel. This is just 3 minutes of somebody who was on the 14th minute and 59th second of their fame talking into autotuning software over a rejected level theme from a Super Meat Boy ripoff. Whoever submitted this, thank you. Seriously, thank you. I was worried about giving a 0 to a song in a charity rate but you gave me the perfect "song" to do that with.

**Kaylaboe** (0): queen of socialism

**Mysario** (0): I'm glad we got two of his tracks but sadly it's not Weird Al's best work

**NegativeFiveBelow** (0): I genuinely fail to understand the motivation for this song being here. Both in this rate, and on this earth.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (0): @ whoever submitted this: you're messy

**poppinmolly** (0): this is honestly terrible. I can't stand it even ironically.

**Raykel** (0): PC music if it was bad.

**rocketgamer31** (0): I'm suing whoever submitted this for pain and suffering tbh

**shineflyer** (0): it's a shitpost, like, what am i supposed to say?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): This is like dead petz and yeezus had a kid but it died

**TragicKingdom1** (0): funny for the first minute but then i had to finish the song

**zamomattel** (0): i wish this was a bit more like 4:33

Your eyes are not deceiving you, that was 4'33" in first place in the rate. And lo how the mighty have fallen...

*Dude: Oh 4'33... In a rate that involved Kesha, Little Mix, Charli XCX and Cupcakke, you still managed to be one of the most discussed song in the rate. The song is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of just background noise from when it was first played live. Despite what many of us assumed, this song was not written as a joke. This was a serious piece of music. However, just the idea of hearing white noise on spotify was enough for this to go out on Day 1, where not even memes could save it.*

#Let's be honest, nobody was silent on this one.

**dirdbub** (11): this is my slutdrop anthem

**Mysario** (11): during this time, I usually reflect on how terrible my life is because I continue to make bad decision after bad decision, self-destructing any chance I may ever get for just a taste of my own happiness damn what a solid banger

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): I almost gave this my 11. That drop at 3:45 omg made me pop my thrussy

**enecks** (10): The people talking shit about this song saying it's nothing don't get the point behind it at all. It's not silence - you can hear ambient sounds. That's the whole point of this work - deconstruct the impact of the recording environment on music by making it the music itself. Yet, anti-postmodernist memers think that this is just "lol silence XD".

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Popheads missed the point. There's no such thing as silence. What they thought was silence, because they didn’t know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could hear Katy's career dying outside during the first movement. During the second, drops from wonderbitch26's pussy began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of disappointed sounds as they listened to Reputation— John Cage speaking about the premiere of 4'33?[9]

**Piccprincess** (10): Popheads when they can't dance to this https://media.giphy.com/media/ykgZU04Qy5UUo/giphy.gif

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Considering I hate music, this is by far my favorite song in the rate

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.6): Invented silence. Also this is a four point three times two because I wanted to be clever but also innovation deserves more than a four point three, mkay.

**ForretressArtillery** (7.5): The spotify version sounds like a white noise track... Weird.

**Kaylaboe** (5): is this the song swifties sent to top of iTunes

**timothy444** (5): Going to give this the same score (a 5) I gave the other version over at the worstsongsever rate. I'm bedazzled to why this song is in the rate in the first place?

**TragicKingdom1** (5): reminds me of bon iver's last album

#Funny Score Brigade

**AbnormalPopPunk** (4.3): too edgy for me

**Leixander** (4.3): this is what she deserves

**mirandacrocsgrove** (4.3): i just heard my dog bark the entire time

**NegativeFiveBelow** (4.3): So here's the thing, the whole point of the "experiment" of 4'33" is that what you're listening to is the ambient noise of the performance space you're in. John Cage isn't even the first guy who wrote silent pieces, but he was on this whole Zen Buddhism trip and was remarking on how he'd always hear sounds until the day he died, even in purportedly silent places/at silent moments. So while I'm all for the philosophy of it, the recording is somewhere else's noise. I am not going to sit here and reflect on my own understanding of what art is and what my resposibilities to it are as artist and listener when some concert hall recording setup static I will never actually be present for is playing instead of my 4'33"

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.3): https://pastebin.com/k40zLmUC

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.3): definitely not the least interesting thing in this rate

#Hello Darkness My Old Friend

**followingfreeways** (3): still better than dare to be stupid and on my own... o god on my own was so bad I want to throw up

**shineflyer** (3): lots of people are going to make this their 0 i expect, but lets be real, there are songs where you'd rather turn off the radio than listen to them.

**poppinmolly** (2): giving this 2 poinst purely for the fact that someone submitted a song that is honestly just static but that's the most points I'll give to static and a few bangs.

**agentofscranton** (1): a neato concept, I get that it’s meant to represent the fact that anything can be music, but 4:33 of just silence with the odd cough here and there just doesn’t appeal to me, sorry

**bwc222** (1): would've given this my 0, but farrah abraham exists and silence is better than hearing her voice

**c0ns3rvative** (1): It'd probably be cool to experience this in a venue with other people all around you but as an isolated personal experience it really embodies pointlessness

**CrispyEggs123** (1): Not a fan of the concept, also, no point in it being on any streaming service or any recorded format if it is more of a live performance thing, the record is literally radio static.

**cyborglilith** (1): why

**Death\_Soup** (1): let’s be honest here it’s a 1

**dropthehammer11** (1): no thanks

**johnazoidberg-** (1): First of all, fuck you. Second of all, this is still a better song than that Farrah Abraham mess

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): i dont get this meme

**Raykel** (1): Man when the beat dropped at 3:06

**rocketgamer31** (1): I thought my headphones broke when I listened to this. This gets a point just for the fact that I think it's funny someone is making money off of this track

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): y'all really thinking this is deep or dramatic or something are boring. i'm not even wasting my 0 on this

**SkyBlade79** (1): oh I see. I remember reading about this in Music Appreciation, and well it is interesting, it just CANNOT be recorded. This static that they added makes absolutely no sense.

**zamomattel** (1): not a 0 because this choice is BALLSY

**10footnotes** (0): This isn’t a song, so it doesn’t get scored like one. After reading its Wikipedia page, I don’t care about the theory behind it: I’m listening to music because I want to hear actual melodic sounds in my ears, not because I want to keep listening to the sounds of my roommate watching a movie or the heater working. Also, static does NOT equal an absence of sound: this idea did not translate well from “performance” to digital recording. Finally, the fact that this is a “three-movement composition” is bullshit pretentious posturing. As a way to spark discussion about the characteristics of music, sure, this is fine. As an actual song? No goddamn way.

**awryj** (0): This choice has never been easier

**Elitefourbrad** (0): Taylor’s white noise song outsold! Also this is a terrible excuse of a waste of my time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Honestly? Fuck John Cage, I’m not tolerating this nonsense. I have such a hatred for this “piece,” and it pains me to use that word. “The music is the ambient noises created by the audience during the piece” BULLSHIT. Even if this remotely made any sort of sense, how can John Cage claim to have “composed” silence? He didn’t write this. He didn’t do anything. He just wasted everyone’s time. He wasn’t even the first person to try and pull off the “silence is music” schtick. And yeah, sure, art is supposed to draw a reaction or whatever, but honestly all of the discussion surrounding this piece can basically be boiled down to sensible people trying to tell everyone that this is ridiculous, and obtuse artsy assholes twisting themselves in knots to try and pass this off as a work of genius. This is peak “famous people get to pump out shit and it’s okay because they’re established.” Whoever this was, you wasted your submission. This doesn’t challenge the ideas of what music is, it challenges my patience for y’all fools who tolerate this nonsense. It’s performance art in a sense, but it’s not music and I if this makes it any higher than the bottom ten, well, that’s the power of memes.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): If I'm gonna give a 0 to a song in this rate, it's gonna be the one that was obviously sent as a meme and the person who sent it doesn't have a real attachment to the song.

**jamesfog** (0): Bullshit.

berober04: To take a lull in the rate, let's explain the extra bits and bobs.

First off are the easy ones, the graphs!

**Rate Graph** shows exactly that, the position a song was in as the rate went on. Simples.

**Scores Graph** is every score as it came in

**Totals Graph** is the line to where the song finished in the scores. The y-axis is locked to 700, since all songs scored below 700 (72 songs need an average of 9.8-ish to make 700, you can see where that leads to).

Oops, the silence is nearly over, I'll be back in a bit for the median/mode/lower/upper!

A real shame this was ranked so low, I legit enjoy this song and the impact it had on the band it was lampooning, Devo.

#dare to believe you can survive 

**johnazoidberg-** (11): It should surprise a grand total of none of you that I submitted this song. After all, I'm our resident Weird Al stan. But I chose this song because it shows Al's true genius and talent. This is not a parody, it's an original song he wrote in the style of Devo - and it is more Devo than their entire discography combined. My favorite movie is Scream - it poked fun at everything that was a signature of slasher movies and pointed out their cliches while also being a great slasher movie - and Al did that to Devo and arguably the entire New Wave movement in this song. This isn't just a silly comedy song, it's a perfect representation of the music industry in the 80's. As Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo put it: 'It was the most beautiful thing I has ever heard." Oh, I also chose it because it's a fucking bop.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Honestly? This is a full unironic bop. It can be funny at times and the Devo inspired instrumental and feel of this song is so perfect.

**VeganSquash** (9): this song is supposed to be stupid so I cant rate it low can I lol

**Mysario** (8.5): Devo's best song

**enecks** (8): A bop that gets deducted a few points for its influence on Trump's policies.

**dropthehammer11** (7): Not crazy about this one but I bumped it up a point or 2 because Weird Al is a legend

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): he makes some really valid points

**awryj** (6.5): Mashed potatoes CAN be my friends? Finally someone accepting of my life choices.

**Raykel** (6.5): I don't like joke songs but this has great one liners.

**10footnotes** (6): me now that finals are over

**jamesfog** (6): Not his best

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6): I had never heard this Weird Al song, and as with all of them, I thought it was very clever but I will probably never go back and listen to it. I'm also not familiar enough with Devo to really get into this I think

**rocketgamer31** (6): I do stupid shit all the time so this is relatable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Not one of my favorite Al songs, this seems like the epitome of /r/all

**agentofscranton** (5.5): weird al is a legend but he has better

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): I get Weird Al is supposed to be a parody act, but I'm just not feeling this lol. It's...ok I guess.

#dare to keep all of your dreams alive

**mirandacrocsgrove** (5): the charity rate was a mistake

**NapsAndNetflix** (5): i dont get the weird al hype sorry

**shineflyer** (5): his low Devo voice is so enjoyable. but it is only a silly little song, in the end

**TragicKingdom1** (5): idgi

**zamomattel** (3.5): what sort of devil's work

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3.2): I had a thing with this guy who liked Weird Al and you know how some people just completely ruin something for you like a show or a band or a name.

**Elitefourbrad** (3): I mean it’s Weird Al so bye bitch!

**Kaylaboe** (3): no, i am a sensible human bean!!!

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): We should have rated Amish Paradise instead :/

**bwc222** (2): i will not accept this slander against devolution

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This sounds like it should be the theme to Uncle Grandpa, but as one of the few people who actually seemed to like that show I don’t want to attach this song to it because I don’t like this song. Y’all are gonna make fun of me for liking Meghan Trainor when you’re out there listening to this?

**LandoFreeman** (2): richard cheese outsold and outfunnied

**sasuke-lp** (2): lmao no.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f6m90BbCu4

**cyborglilith** (1): I don’t understand everyone’s love for Al. Could not even get through a minute.

**dirdbub** (1): this is from the Transformers soundtrack

**mokitsu** (1): I get this is supposed to be a parody, but it's not funny IMO...sorry!

**SkyBlade79** (1): this is not funny or charming

**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): i hate how this is produced well and it's kind of clever asdfghjkl

#Blubbering

**HalfAlienRobot** (11): obviously

**Mudkip1** (10): yas what a jawline

**CrispyEggs123** (9): A grower for sure. Is it weird that I find this comforting and warm?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Literally the video for this is flawless thank god

**zamomattel** (8.5): i love this, i'd love to hear a combination of this kind of sound and the more classic SOPHIE

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): it's a nice song but in context of what sophie has created before, this is way way toned down and unexciting. maybe it's her new sound, but after PRODUCT EP and vroom vroom/number 1 angel, this is a step down for me. however there are highlights like the panning voice sample in the chorus, and the breaths and other small production details that make it a joy to listen to. and the final chorus is fun.

**followingfreeways** (7): I kinda like this but it also creeps me out kinda,

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): ok i really, really, really, really loathed this at first, but it quickly got stuck in my head and the final 20 seconds are actually great

**rocketgamer31** (7): Queen of crying, who can relate (woo!)

**shineflyer** (7): I want to like this more than I do tbh. The whispered title is a bit extra - but then again, this is SOPHIE we're talking about.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): Sophie producing > Sophie whispering into a mic

**awryj** (6): This is a good song but I hate the whispering in it, it makes me cringe. It's like I can hear all the saliva dripping down Sophie's throat... Ugh

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6): I'm not in the right state of mind to really buy into the content, but also the whispering is super jarring

**10footnotes** (5.5): It’s okay (seriously, not in a joking way), but the sentiment behind it is definitely very important. The whispered vocals in the chorus make me uncomfortable, but the production is good. Yikes, except for the last chorus, what is that noise in the background.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.1): Thank you for your advice Sophie, I’m a fool and I’m not going to take it.

#Sobbing

**enecks** (5): oh no this production is nice but oh no SOPHIE I stanned you what are you doing

**Kaylaboe** (5): can i cry at how mediocre this is

**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): i love sophie but what is this mess

**ImADudeDuh** (4): This song feels kind of empty imo.

**jamesfog** (4): I'm sorry but this is just bad.

**Mysario** (4): sorry this song actually makes me feel uncomfortable the longer it goes on

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): The biggest problem with this song is that it's not where it's supposed to be, i can see snippets of a lovely melody here inserted in avant-garde pop I really didn't need. I think I'll pass, though I'd like to congratulate SOPHIE for finding her identity.

**SkyBlade79** (4): not much payoff for a song that feels like it’s just a buildup

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): thanks hunny i really needed to know i was allowed to cry thank you so much, this song is too string-y for me, but that CONTOUR SIS CAME TO SLAY

**Elitefourbrad** (3): SOPHIE, stick to producing sis.

**Leixander** (3): a really weird song that doesn't really work at all.

**strawberryswing1** (3): why does he sound like a predator?

**bwc222** (2): i'm sorry, i normally love SOPHIE's work but ugh this is such a dud... i hope this isn't a new route for her.

**gannade** (2): this is elevator music

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): idk how to say this but. this is the gayest song ever. i hate this kind of singing and how super dramatic it is.

**VeganSquash** (1.5): end of the song is pretty lit, but I'm going to be honest, this sucked ass. It was her (him?) whispering the entire time. Also, who is SOPHIE? Popheads always talks about how amazing her production is, and yet I have no clue what songs she has produced.

**cyborglilith** (1): boring

**dirdbub** (1): I'm sorry SOPHIE but this is terrible. the whispering, the snares, hell the final chorus in general hurts my ears so much that it's just not good

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): This makes me… uncomfortable. They say that, in animation, even if you want to give a character “doll-like charm” not making them blink is a bad idea because even though it conveys that they’re a doll it’s weird to watch. This song is like that, whispering gives you the aesthetic you’re looking for but it also makes it sound weird and creepy. I’ve never quite gotten the appeal of SOPHIE, either their avant-garde noise concoctions or their pop production, and this does nothing to change my mind.

**animefangrant62** (0): This is the lamest thing ever. Whispering the lyrics doesn't break down the emotional barrier between the artist and audience, just ask Selena that.

**mokitsu** (0): god this is awful...her vocals are horrible

**LandoFreeman** (9): really digging this. giving me riot grrl teas

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): is this rock? i feel like my dad would like this

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): I went through so many cycles of loving > hating > loving > hating this song...rockin' intro, those guitars, that babyvoice, those lyrics, that scream, that solo, aaahhhh I just don't know what impulse wins out

**agentofscranton** (7.5): the guy who voiced dash in the incredibles is the guitarist? wtf?

**jamesfog** (7.5): Is this Poppy

**animefangrant62** (7): Seems like Taylor owes someone a writing credit

**enecks** (7): Good vocal performance, good beat, do not mesh together at all.

**shineflyer** (7): and here I thought Grimes was the one who sometimes sounded like an anime girl

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Kinda forgettable track on this album for me but I really like the album. Charly Bliss is dope y’all!!!

**dirdbub** (6): not sure what to think about this song. on one hand, I feel like this is some Japanese fetish song due to the abnormally high, Poppy x hentai voice actor-esque vocals going on. on the other hand, this is from an album titled Guppy and I can't exactly think of a more appropriately titled album

#See You Later

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.1): I heard this song a lot because I played the Spotify playlist starting at SuperLove while I was in the shower at least twenty times and I almost cracked my head opening tryin to hit that skip button. I just find her voice annoying and the lyrics are worse :( im sorry charly

**awryj** (5): I had no idea what a percolator was. I checked the dictionary and it turned out it was a mediocre alt rock song.

**c0ns3rvative** (5): Some nice riffs but the combination of this vocalist over these power pop instrumentals just doesn't work for me

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Grimes audition tapes for the Foo Fighters

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Hmm, we're steering a bit off course here. I like the idea of a pop track with punk and rock influences like this one, but the only bits I can remember of it are unpleasant sing-shouting.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): I’ve never been a huge fan of the in your face, unpolished aspects of punk, and that’s what this is giving me. These lyrics are all over the place, but more than that this track feels… incomplete. Like there should be another verse or something.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): it's a no from me

**10footnotes** (4): Put me with the other Taylor comments.

**ExtraEater** (4): inspired by old indie rock styles and it doesn't sound that great. it's definitely made a latte greater

**rocketgamer31** (4): I was feeling this until the vocals kicked in :/

**SkyBlade79** (4): noah fence but is she 12

**zamomattel** (3.5): i thought this was a k pop song at first because of her weird diction

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this song would probably be good if the lead singer's voice wasn't nails on a chalkboard and the mixing wasn't so odd

**Elitefourbrad** (2): The screams were disgusting in this song and it deserves your bad scores.

**strawberryswing1** (2): wow so much noise, like a heavy rock band, but the vocals are from a 10 year old girl?

**cyborglilith** (1): not a fan of this chipmunk

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): this voice wtf

**VeganSquash** (1): her voice is too high, like a fake-baby girl voice similar to the fake-indie girl voice. Yuck, horrible song.

#Luck of the Irish

**dirdbub** (10): the guitar at the beginning reminds me of "There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back" by the white twink himself Shawn Mendes

**animefangrant62** (9): I picked this song because I couldn't decide and last minute picked the song I'd been listening to a lot at the time. Whilst I think it's great it does wears thin. Really wish I picked a different song :/

**rocketgamer31** (8): No shade, I didn't know Jason Derulo made decent songs tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): there are soooo many Jasooooon Deruloooo bops to choose from... this isn't really one of them. Still better than his other recent stuff though.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): I hate how much I love Jason Derulo even though he’s a dick to people in the UK for some bizarre reason. He just makes good pop music, alright?? Stream Cheyenne on Spotify!

**johnazoidberg-** (7): In college somebody told me a story that on his high school's basketball team, the star player's girlfriend cheated on him with Jason DeRulo so when they played their biggestrival, every time he got the ball everybody in the stands sang JAAASON DERUUUULO. He doesn't start songs by singing that anymore :(

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Torn, because this is a good song, but I dislike Jason Derulo a lot. His voice always has this weird creepy vibe to it.

**10footnotes** (6.5): What garage were these verses recorded in? It’s kind of generic but also a bit of a bop. Wait, hold up, this is a song about reincarnation after death. Jason, is everything okay?

---
#Narrowly Avoiding A Black Cat

**awryj** (6): generic, but boppy

**BreezySeason** (6): This is just inoffensive pop, which I feel sums up Derulo's career

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Mm, turns out I’m only really interested in Jason Derulo when he’s featuring Meghan Trainor. (Stream “Painkiller” please.)

**Raykel** (6): Out of all his songs to flop it's gotta be his best one. (I realize I only gave it a 6 but just cause it's his best song doesn't mean it's a great song.)

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): jason can do better "if not not gay. aye"

**SkyBlade79** (6): this is really chill

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Not one of my favorite Jason tracks, kinda forgettable.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): desrouleaux

**cyborglilith** (5): who is jason derulo

---
#Stepping On A Crack

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Jason can keep this awful confuzzled mess. But I will give him props for at least ruining it over a somewhat catchy beat.

**jamesfog** (5): Yeah, I'm not feeling this.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): what

**NegativeFiveBelow** (3.5): If I'm lucky I won't have to listen to this generic low-hanging fruit again, gottem

**shineflyer** (2.5): It's Jason Derulo, so...

**VeganSquash** (2): uninspired garbage

**zamomattel** (2): its just so boring, and to think once upon a time i liked Jason

berober04: If I could be so lucky as to get back to Math for a sec...

So, the last bits to be aware of are also pretty easy! Let's round them up:

* **Median** is the middle score given to a song. If the median is lower than the average, then odds are there were more high scores, but the lows were BIG lows. The further a median is from the average average, the more controversial a song was. Generally.
* **Mode** is what score y'all gave it the most. Again, look at the average average, it's pretty similar to median.

* **Lower** is the lowest position this song was in the rate. Aside from On My Own, which was #59 on its own, the better a song was, the lower the lower will be.

* **Upper** is the songs peak. Generally, the higher the peak, the higher the song should place. 4'33" is special in that regard I guess...

*Dude: Fix You is your normal break up anthem but this time, the singer wants to try and make the relationship work again, with her love being very hesitant to it. Fix You was released in 2012, and the production and the drop definitely shows it. Vita has a good voice but the autotune added on top of her does not help this song get more emotion packed behind it. All in all, the song is good, but not insanely memorable.*

#Handyman

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): i have no words

**NegativeFiveBelow** (10): I thought I knew where the song was going. Then the first drop happend. I did not know where the song was going. I sat up straighter, restarted the song, and started raging furiously in my room alone. The second drop melted my brain anew. This has POWER. Definitely my favorite discovery on the rate.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Ahh, 2012 music

**Death\_Soup** (8.2): certainly a product of its time but a bop regardless

**enecks** (8): My life will never be fixed

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A great song! Unfortunately, I'd say that Vita is the weakest part of the song.

**LandoFreeman** (8): the drop gagged me but she’s way too screamy in the chorus. not everyone can be legendtina

**SkyBlade79** (8): reminds me of early krewella

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is the most 2012 shit I’ve ever heard and I love it

**agentofscranton** (7): I can see myself getting my life to this in a club

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): I feel like this one is pretty generic. Sorry. Really.

**shineflyer** (6.5): that pre-chorus is so good. the song gets to be a much at some points, though

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): lol this sounds like play hard by david guetta

**rocketgamer31** (5.5): I feel like I've heard this Krewella track a million times already

**zamomattel** (5.5): as if when i search this girl's name the first result is the pod thing on bioshock lmao

**cyborglilith** (5): meh generic singing but exciting production

**awryj** (4): Wow, the production of this song is so messy. I guess it's a banger but her high notes are so grating and the synths are so annoying. I kinda like it but also hate so many things about it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Was she on one of the Real Housewives? This sounds like something that they would put out.

**Raykel** (4): This reminded me of how headache-inducing that EDM craze was a few years ago.

---

#The Ikea Instructions Are In Swedish

**10footnotes** (3.5): Her voice is good, but she’s way too screamy in the choruses. The production is a bit dated in a not-great way as well. Sorry to whoever submitted this, I just personally don’t like it.

**Mudkip1** (3): i thought her voice was way too shrill but i can see why people would like this song

**VeganSquash** (2.5): this is so 2010s

**Kaylaboe** (2): i remember listening to this back in 2012! it was really generic and whiny back then, and it still is

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): this sounds like every EDM song to come out in 2011 but worse

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): This seemed like a nice song at first but then the weird-ass production ruined it. Still miffed on what they did to the chorus.

---

#Maroon 5

**strawberryswing1** (8): Coldplay did it better. Really basic 2012-ish EDM but luckily I love that era's sound.

**dirdbub** (6.5): this is a weird cover of Coldplay's iconic single "Fix You"

**CrispyEggs123** (4.5): When you try your best but you don't succeed

I'm really sorry Zamo, this one actually physically hurt my ears. I don't mean that in a stan twittery way, I mean I had to take my headphones off halfway while the song was playing. And hey, check out those twin 11's!

*Dude: BTSTU was Jai Paul's first song to be released on his MySpace page (it was 2007, it made sense.) It's definitely a unique song that just isn't for me. The percussion is way too punchy for me and the production is only ok. The vocals being drowned out by the production makes this almost too difficult to listen to which is a shame cause these are some pretty damn good lyrics. All in all, I can definitely see why this song blew up online and why there were tons of labels ready to sign him.*

#Big Time Song Turned Up

**Mudkip1** (11): the coolest, most innovative song of the last 10 years. jai paul has literally changed the entire UK r&b scene i can't wait for popheads to ignore the lasting impact he's had and eliminate him day 1. he's been a source of influence for so many wonderful artists, like Lorde, Beyonce, Drake, NAO, Miguel, Mura Masa, Sky Ferreira, and more.

**zamomattel** (11): ok this was my choice. BUT. I think it's a masterpiece. I mean that opening line with that damn falsetto? Genius

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): pure original hybrid-experimental genius

**dirdbub** (10): DON'T FUCK WITH ME, D O N ' T   F U C K   W I T H   M E

**Kaylaboe** (10): i’m back and i want what is mine: we’re still waiting sweaty

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): come back jai paul

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally both Jai Paul’s songs are flawless and this one has some of the greatest beats in modern music and I can’t gush about this enough but this is literally musical perfection.

**Death\_Soup** (9.9): gosh that’s a beautiful song. (I didn’t know jake paul had that in him /s)

**rocketgamer31** (9.5): The beat during the chorus is insane, I'm shook

**enecks** (7): weird but kinda goes AWF

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): What does this acronym stand for? I like the production but this just feels so lowkey to me. No thank you.

**Raykel** (6): I didn't like it at first but I was shaking my body after a bit not gonna lie.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Production is killer but I’ve never been a fan of that sort of “faded out vocals” style.

**10footnotes** (5): Neutral score because I don’t personally enjoy it that much, but I appreciate how he made unusual and interesting production choices.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (5): Nothing ever really happened, is the thing

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): WUUBBUBUUBBUBUBBUBUBUBUBBUBUBUBUBUBUBUBUB

#Looking Forward To The Weekend

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The two issues I have with this song are a. The fact that Natalia Kills is a jerk and b. The eerie similarity between the prechorus here and the one from The Way I Love You (one of my favorite deep cuts off Fearless). That being said, I always greatly admire pop songs that detail the life of people who've been abused or fallen on hard times, like a lot of Mariah songs or Praying. Despite this being synthpop, Natalia's smooth delivery adorned with an intriguing British accent mashes surprisingly well with the track's stellar production and its retrospective, harrowing lyrics. For once, I won't feel guilty about giving this a 10.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8.5): sounds like janelle monae. i like it.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Riri and Gwen Stefani vibes.

**zamomattel** (8.5): honestly, this might inspire me to listen to more natalia

**Elitefourbrad** (8): This is what I’d think of if Lana ever did electropop and this was great. Saturday Nights would be more fun with this song.

**Raykel** (8): The problematics always have bops why???

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7.5): This was gonna be lower but then something about "I'm a fuckin' teenage tragedy" brought me back to a simpler, edgier time and then I started feeling it

**10footnotes** (7): Fun fact: according to her Spotify bio, Natalia was once the number one unsigned artist on MySpace.

**agentofscranton** (7): god i’m so mad she sabotaged her own career with that x factor tirade because natalia made some bops

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I always felt kind of bad that Natalia Kills destroyed her career publicly in the most embarrassing way possible because honestly? I like her music. She’s more of an albums artist though, I’ve never quite been drawn to her individual songs as I have been to her full bodies of work.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): That riff in the beginning is really nice. It’s a shame she had to say such ugly things, she’s talented. I still love ‘Kill My Boyfriend’.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): kinda long but a synthpop track i can get on board with

**gannade** (6.5): Natalia Kills is slightly problematic but she def didnt deserve for her career to completely die when her songs are this good (well this ones only decent, but I enjoy her work with cruel youth)

**cyborglilith** (6): lmao I saw her mishap on /r/cringe and did just that. Anyway, this song is a good anthem but her voice is bad.

**rocketgamer31** (6): It's all right, not memorable for me though

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): We have a doppelgänger in our midst. As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted by how much you have copied Lily Allen's bop Friday Night (available on iTunes with a purchase of the iconic album Alright, Still) Do you not have any value or respect for originality? You’re a laughingstock. It’s cheesy. It’s disgusting. I personally found it absolutely artistically atrocious. I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.

#Wish It Was Sunday

**animefangrant62** (5): Sounds like a boring Gaga and also why the hell is this 5 minutes long?

**Kaylaboe** (5): acshually, this song is just okay. NOT better than her husband!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): this song is so mediocre

**awryj** (4): She somehow managed to make domestic abuse seem bland and boring

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): more like Natalia kills her career amirite lol

**dirdbub** (2.5): this is literally so fucking boring

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): https://youtu.be/LuZ1TvBZNB8?t=5m12s

**shineflyer** (1): I've heard this song like three times but it's so unoriginal it feels like i've heard it a hundred times.

#oop.

**VeganSquash** (1): Natalia killed her career when she and her husband were major bitches to that poor guy. She has no talent and the songs I've heard of hers suck ass. I appreciate the message of this, but the delivery is abysmal and the way she sings "Saturday night" is fucking annoying. **I would've given this my 0 if that stupid ass 4'33" wasn't on here. Like who even submitted that? Is it supposed to be a meme?**

It's not only one of the most influential songs of the last 10 years, but also better than almost every other flop in this rate. In fact, I didn't give it my 11 because I was scared that this track was so talented that it would surge to the top regardless, and I wanted to give every other track an advantage. Not even making it into day 2? This must be a cruel joke. /r/popheads has failed me many times before but today is the last straw.

#Life After Love

**LandoFreeman** (10): wig orbiting saturn. she sounds a tad like céline

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Such a gorgeous and inspiring song, and as Delta's suffered from cancer since an early age, it's quite obvious that this is wholly authentic. It reminds me of Ray of Light mixed in with a little bit of Disney. There is a little New Age influence here, but that doesn't really bother me all that much.

**VeganSquash** (10): This is like a Mariah song but better

**awryj** (9): late 1990s inspired dance pop goodness, Madonna is frozen but quaking

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.6): Aussie Aussie Aussie OI OI OI

**10footnotes** (8.5): This is really nice! I love the violins, her voice, and how well the song builds and creates this euphoric mood that’s missing in most mainstream pop songs right now. I’ll try and listen to the full album sometime! (Also, the beginning instrumental sounds like the coronation scene in the Return of the King, and I am completely okay with that).

**cyborglilith** (8): nice

**Raykel** (7.5): Was confused until 1 minute and 35 seconds in.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): slow start, but picks up!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This feels like it was written to play over the credits of a movie.

**c0ns3rvative** (6): It teeters on the edge of being too saccharine throughout the entirety of the track up to the bridge... which just pushes it way over

**CrispyEggs123** (6): not really a fan of this song but I love those strings

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Is this Christian music

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5.5): for some reason this is unavailable in my country, thanks youtube, omfg those vocals

**Kaylaboe** (5): apparently this was released in 2011, but it sounds more like the 90s or early 00s if i’m frank

**rocketgamer31** (5): This is fine I guess

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i'm not really feeling the song but damn that intro was beautiful and i usually hate dramatic intros

---

#I Really Don't Think You're Strong Enough

**johnazoidberg-** (4): I must've slept on my hand again because I am not feeling it. Her voice is gorgeous, though

**shineflyer** (4): does not have nearly enough substance to warrant being six minutes long. The intro's a nice build up to the song, though

**SkyBlade79** (4): I forgot about it instantly

**dirdbub** (3.5): I feel like I'm in an anime closing for a tween girl who got out of the reigns of a pedophile teacher but wants to go back to him

**NegativeFiveBelow** (3.5): ~1:30 of bad musical I-want song into Vanessa Carlton reject

**zamomattel** (2.5): this is so Eurovision non-qualifying song

---

#Disney Has Bought Out This Comment Space

**jamesfog** (9): Magical and enchanting!

**Mysario** (7): this song makes me think of The Cheetah Girls but it's the fourth iteration and it's on ABC Family

**Elitefourbrad** (6): This reminds me of Disney Channel in the best possible way?

With a chorus that is part high energy, part DNCE, this one goes hard. A definite grower, I probably ranked this one a bit low, but definitely an above average song.

#GooD Music

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (11): OMFG HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIS AND RHE BEST YOU HAD? Okay but tea guys this album and this song changed my life. My most played album ever. I relate to this song and this album so hard and I don't even believe in god like holy fuck Tyler Glenn genuinely did that. "You see me freaking out / I'm thinking I might do something dumb / Yeah, I wanna tell you and I'm-I’m not the only one / I’m not the only one" like holy shit same."Go on, give up on me / I think my father still loves his son" like holy fuck I relate so hard cause ya know daddy issues (my dad is amazing is mainly me that I'm stupid and afraid of stupid shit and general fear of being a disappointment and all that, also not having a lot in common with my dad and ta know stuff). Like ffs this is the song that I needed when I was like 16 and I'm so grateful this song and its album exists cause it treats themes that are not really talked about in a real way. Cause even tho I never wanted to be straight and I'm proud of who I am there is always that voice in the back of your head that goes "If you were straight this would be so much easier and you would disappoint your dad" like holy shit I relate so hard to this song. Also the whole alum is my most listened album of all time for a reason: https://imgur.com/a/3nziq

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this gay anthem made me catholic

**awryj** (9.4): Really good lyrics. Great new wavish production. I'm bopping, but I'm sad.

**cyborglilith** (9.1): his voice is great

**shineflyer** (9): this entire album is so good and y'all been sleepin on it. I'd honestly rather he stay solo than keep with Neon Trees tbh. I can see peple thinking this is "cringey" or some shit but like, fuck that noise.

**SkyBlade79** (9): these lyrics are amazing lmaooo. The beat is good too

**agentofscranton** (8.5): a coming out bop yas I’m into it

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): It's so heavy-handed in its treatment of everything and calling God "she" just feels SNL-high-school-theatre-troupe to me, but the emotional core of this is obviously earth-shatteringly-powerful and sometimes I too just want to feral queer rage scream over a sick beat? I don't know.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): this is cool

**dirdbub** (7.5): enjoyable! also the singer is lowkey very cute

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): song is good, but not one of my favorites from Excommunication. I did really enjoy that album though. John, Give Em Hell is a personal favorite.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.3): Gay and emo. Love it.

#MiddLing

**Elitefourbrad** (7): This is too straight for me a little but I still like it cause it’s a bop.

**Kaylaboe** (7): invented gays

**rocketgamer31** (7): I don't really like this sonically, but this song gets bonus points for the lyrics

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): What is this song title wh

**10footnotes** (6.5): I’m not the target demographic of this song, but I think it’s catchy and well-produced.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (6.5): nice beat but they lyrics are kinda cheap which is sucha shame

**VeganSquash** (6.5): WHAT?! He's a solo artist now? How did I not know about this.

**zamomattel** (6): Cupcakke still has the best LGBT anthem here

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Yeah I had a gay friend back in high school so I relate to this.

**mokitsu** (5): ok blasi

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): I really appreciate the message here, but I'm not huge on it a lot sonically speaking. I think Troye did this a lot better.

#Efficiency

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of the best tracks on the album!!! I love Japanese Breakfast and this new album was totally slept on, it’s so good.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.8): I had never heard this song before this rate and it sounds like the love child of that neon tinted Drive soundtrack and the Stranger Things theme tune and I love it.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): have heard of someone backing off from liking this bc it got mainstream. imagine

**Leixander** (9.5): the sax outro makes this song legendary

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): i'm vibing with this a lot and her voice is lovely

**animefangrant62** (9): First song I've heard by this group and it's great!

**jamesfog** (9): Hey, that's pretty good!

**awryj** (8.2): The sax elevates this song to a whole new level

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This track is super ahead of its time, if society eventually successfully integrates robots or whatever we’re gonna be bopping to this, this is gonna be playing at weddings. It’s not her best track though.

**LandoFreeman** (8): the brass at the end elevated it

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I've heard of Japanese Breakfast before. This song of theirs was a bit hard to get into at first, but it's weird and hypnotic in a good way. Pretty good first impression.

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I like this but some of the vocal effects are weird imo

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): not my thing but i can appreciate it

**NegativeFiveBelow** (7): Definitely a song that has built on me with each successive time I've listened to it; still don't like the intro at all

**zamomattel** (6): this is a nice tune but i can't find myself going back to it

**shineflyer** (3.5): slightly better vocoder use than Farrah Abraham. (on the other hand, that sax)

**VeganSquash** (2.5): Amazing production, but the auto-tune is too much for me. I get that it's meant to be like that, but meh.

#Got You

**Kaylaboe** (11): a grammy nominee! Freudian is one of the best albums of 2017, everyone please listen to it

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): shit i love daniel ceasar

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh I really like this! This is such a nice slow jam. The production on this track is killer, it’s a sonic love nest. The lyrics are tasteful and their voices are gentle but still passionate. I miss straight up love duets, just genuine songs about loving and appreciating people, you don’t really hear them anymore.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Daniel Caesar could sing Gangnam Style and make it sound good.

**gannade** (9): atmospheric

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oooooooooo this is SMOOOOOOOOTH

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): i forgot how lit this daniel caser album was until you made me listen to this again thank you whoever submitted this

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): A fun combination of Frank Ocean and the songs you hear on a crossover station late at night. Definitely the best vocals we have so far.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.5): This is one of my best friend’s favourite songs and I love my best friend.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): schmexy

**awryj** (8): thats some s e x y j a m right there

**jamesfog** (8): Khalid is shook

**rocketgamer31** (8): A chill bop

**mokitsu** (7.5): cute, chill bop..

**cyborglilith** (7): sleep

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6.5): good to space out to, but easy to miss

**Raykel** (6): I liked it but yeesh I thought it was a 6 minute song before I saw the time stamp.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I like Kali on here but this song is just really long and unfortunately not too interesting for me.

**VeganSquash** (6): Kali is underutilized here. Daniel's vocals are amazing, but I don't like this song for some reason.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): this makes me sleepy but that doesn't mean it's bad.

#Lost You

**dirdbub** (5): well that was boring

**strawberryswing1** (5): basic r&b song by basic r&b singer

**zamomattel** (4): a male vocalist? in my popheads?

**Elitefourbrad** (3): This was a boring snoozefest, sorry jan.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (2): sorry it's way too sparse and it doesn't go anywhere in 4½ minutes

**shineflyer** (2): pretty boring to me. like, i get it, it's a slow jam. but like... that doesn't mean it can't be good tbh

#Friends Don't Leave Friends Behind

**awryj** (10): This song is so cool. The sample, the tension, it's brilliant. We stan now.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh wow I really like this? Those Asian sounding strings (anyone know what instrument that is?) form such a cool foundation for this song. This song is a weird sort of mishmash of elements that really shouldn’t work together, but miraculously they made magic together.

**Kaylaboe** (10): another swedish bop!

**Mudkip1** (10): i'm surprised by how interesting this song is. love it

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this was my submission but i just wanna say this is the absolutely best-produced song in the whole entire universe. my pussy is dripping in the intro and the vocoder voice effect made me bust a nut thank you for listening i hope i helped someone else discover this masterpiece

**shineflyer** (10): i love the electro-harmony, i love the use of shamisen(??or something??), and idk man it's a good song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): omg I totally didn’t expect this to bop after seeing the album art but it most certainly bops

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8.5): Definitely a grower for me, at first I was so used to Imogen Heap that I was adamant these vocal fx and this beat couldn't mix, but no they totally can and it's pretty cool actually

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Good song, but the extra vocals can be a little distracting.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): A little forgettable at first, but it's very sweet! I love the singer's expression on the cover. She seems so pure and friendly.

**zamomattel** (7.5): this was cute i enjoyed it

**SkyBlade79** (7): this is pretty

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6.5): i stan

#Left At The First Opportunity

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): I think I'd like this more if those distorted background vocals didn't exist

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): Another song that I’m just not feeling even after so many listens. 

**dirdbub** (5): this is so boring

**10footnotes** (4): There’s nothing wrong with it, but, at least to me, there’s not much special about it either.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This girl’s voice is awful

**strawberryswing1** (1): holy crap she has an awful voice and the rest of this isn't good either.

#[Everybody Wants To Know Her Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8wcYrqIzhg)

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This is a damn bop but it makes it sound like dying your hair blonde is the absolute worst thing that could happen to a person, and as somebody who grew up in the suburbs of Detroit when Eminem started to get famous, there were WAY too many people volunteering themselves as tribute.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): wow the production on this is banging shit i'm picky but i'm giving this a 10 already even though the lyrics are kinda dumb thank you to whomever entered this

**dropthehammer11** (9): Wow this ouncy op

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): Already blonde, can’t relate.

**jamesfog** (9): A cute bop!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): A BOP how is this the first time I listen to this girl?

**zamomattel** (9): i would dye my hair cream for you

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8.9): i actually like her green hair

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): solid bouncy electropop vibes

**bwc222** (8): at first i didn't find too much appeal in this song, but i kept finding myself listening to it more and more and it's really grown on me. "hair" by gaga is shaking!

**CrispyEggs123** (8): The instrumental is nice...

**Death\_Soup** (7.6): super generic but ALMA has a great voice and this sub just ignores her.

**dirdbub** (7.5): a cute bop with not much else to offer

**sasuke-lp** (7.5): oh I like that drop!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I’m gonna be real, I think this is a pretty generic track, but I don’t necessarily think generic is a bad thing. This checks off a lot of marks common to this kind of song, the distorted vocal hook, the swallowed and somewhat hoarse vocal inflection, those synths, the style of production, the colored hair, the one word all uppercase artist name, it’s all very typical indie pop. However that doesn’t mean it’s bad, in fact I think the song works quite well because even if these elements aren’t necessarily novel, they’re at least done very well and the song is nice to listen to. Sure there are plenty of artists like this girl, but she distinguishes herself by creating something actually nice to listen to.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): "I will do anything for you.... like dye my hair" SOMEONE STOP THIS MAD WOMAN

**LandoFreeman** (7): suddenly i wanna go to bath and body works

**mokitsu** (7): This is good. I love UK pop!

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): See, I get why this song was submitted-there are so many elements of it that I like, mainly the extremely catchy melody it carries. But mixed in with a stereotypical alt pop girl's voice, as well as incredibly generic production, it becomes a little less amazing than what it should be.

**shineflyer** (7): k you made a good song, but don't do shit if it ain't for yourself, girl

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Cute song! The chorus is really fun and I love the beat change during that part but the rest isn’t that interesting to me. Her voice is really nice though.

**awryj** (6.6): That girl could be a good Sia impersonator

---
#[She Changed Her Hair...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxMwWmPXpMk)

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): this is good, but it's not my thing ya feel me? but like it's like 90% a bop. I totally get the dye my hair thing but it's like a really stupid thing to base the whole metaphor of the song. Like for example talk about how the ohter person doesn't like it when you wear heels for example, that makes more sense, at least to me.

**cyborglilith** (6): I wanna dye my hair white but it costs money. Also, this is very generic.

**Elitefourbrad** (6): A nice cute bop, but that chorus and drop need some work. I like the message though.

**enecks** (6): A good vocal performance wasted on a mediocre beat.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6): Kind of a filler track, it just feels like a non-memorable-but-fine combination of contemporary pop elements

**rocketgamer31** (6): Girl you don't have to dye your hair to please anyone, just sayin

**SkyBlade79** (6): not a big fan of the deep voice and it’s kinda generic

**10footnotes** (5.5): The production is good (especially the prechorus), but the lyrics in the chorus are confusing. Sweet and sour? Why is she specifically dying her hair blonde? Also, someone needs to have a talk with her team about why her remix album covers are just the negatives of the original images, because they’re tragic https://open.spotify.com/album/20JA6DTyBSMgsZNRWMxKR7.

#[He Punched The Highlights Out Of Her Hair!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmI-lKraj7g)

**BreezySeason** (5): this was pretty decent at the start but I don't really like the drop

**strawberryswing1** (5): the production is really nice but the lyrics are not good. "i will dye my hair blonde for you"...wtf kind of chorus is that??

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): ah, dying your hair blonde, the ultimate sacrifice of love

**VeganSquash** (1): the chorus is SO stupid. What does dying your hair do for a relationship?

I love a good violin in my music, so the opening chords struck a, well uh, chord with me. And then they disappear at the start of the chorus. Why Karmin, why did you do that?

#Oh, Honey Honey
**10footnotes** (10): This was my submission! If you liked it, feel free to read on for more about Karmin and song recommendations (please validate me). Karmin is a husband and wife duo: Amy sings and Nick produces (they’re now making R&B/hip hop under Qveen Herby). You probably know them best from Brokenhearted, but they went independent a few years ago and changed their sound from bubblegum to more mature and alternative pop. Their last album, [Leo Rising](https://open.spotify.com/album/5yK5daoc1IQ8zmgFj3t5MJ) (where this song comes from) is seriously slept on, and I love introducing people to it because it’s one of my favorite albums of all time. It has 13 songs, each loosely based on a zodiac sign (plus one extra). In my opinion, there is not a single bad song on this album, just good and great ones, and it’s worth a listen for anyone who’s into any kind of pop music because of its musical variety. It really doesn’t have any areas where it stumbles: good production, good lyrics, good vocals, and a general sense of cohesiveness and commitment. If you liked Sugar (or even if you didn’t but are still curious), check out some of these amazing songs, handpicked by yours truly. If you like instrument-based pop and/or general bops: [Easy Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWsWgN9GHsI&index=11&list=PLmIVsOFsJzA1sm76tHeNX3TbhNq00_Z4D). If you like synthpop: [Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaZlH2JOtHo&list=PLmIVsOFsJzA1sm76tHeNX3TbhNq00_Z4D&index=6). If you like hip-hop and badass female rap: [Save Me Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJJI2tOX0jo&index=10&list=PLmIVsOFsJzA1sm76tHeNX3TbhNq00_Z4D). If you like hopeful ballads: [Along the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1D0RWHwtV0). If you like funk: [Blame It On My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOIjvoSVCaQ). I highly recommend checking out at least one of these songs: I promise it will be worth 3-4 minutes of your time. I haven’t even talked about the actual song yet, oop. Basically, Sugar is catchy, unique, fresh, and well-made, and it’s a perfect representation of the amazing album that is Leo Rising.

#You Are My Candy Girl

**CrispyEggs123** (10): An unexpected bop.

**jamesfog** (10): Underrated bop!

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I've only heard Brokenhearted and Acapella before, and this already stands out as far better than either to me. From the funky beat to the lead singer's wonderfully entertaining sassiness, it easily gives me a better impression of Karmin than ever.

**SkyBlade79** (10): God, I love Karmin, and this is one of their best songs ever. It’s so deliciously smooth; that outro is perfect. The song keeps evolving as it goes on, until that amazing rap breakdown; the lyrics "My best judgement fights with the liquor/Is that a spark in your eyes, or a flicker?" are great. Finally, the song ends with a long, outro that's mostly vocalizations set over smooth strings. The instrumentation is great throughout; the guitar, strings, and drums all go together so perfectly. This song is only 4 minutes long, but it packs so much into it, and that's amazing.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): thanks /u/ ThatParanoidPenguin for telling me the existence of karmin's 2016 lp it truly is underrated

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): that a cappella outro

**timothy444** (9): The remix is better but whatever

**cyborglilith** (8): rap god

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): this is such a bop and it makes me sad bc practically no one listened to this record

**NegativeFiveBelow** (8): This is a great earworm. To the point, and a force of nature. And the ending is great in a totally different direction

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): i love karmin

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Not one of my favorites off of the truly iconic and totally slept on Leo Rising (Easy Money!) but this bops, as does every track on the record.

**VeganSquash** (8): what ever happened to Karmin? They were such a one-hit wonder its a shame.

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Is this an ode to food because honestly same

**dirdbub** (7): your sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me I'm right here 'cause I need little love a little sympathy

**gannade** (7): Karmin's debut album was atrocious lol but they do have some talent

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): fun

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6.5): lol arent these the look at me now ppl

#Gone Sour

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.2): I don’t know why but I don’t like her voice on this, I’m pretty casual about it on her other songs but this isn’t doing it for me.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Okay I love some of Karmin’s other songs like Hello and Brokenhearted, but this one just did not do it for me sadly.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Sorry, but her voice here sounds too much like Amy Winehouse mixed with Iggy Azaelia.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): an unassuming bop that is trash

**shineflyer** (3): another song for the playlist my work uses - songs that i've never heard, and never really wanted to hear.

**Kaylaboe** (2): songs like these are the reason karmin never happened

**letsallpoo** (11): WHY IS THIS SO GOOD I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS OR THIS SINGER BEFORE WTF I LOVE THIS SO MUCH WHOEVER SUBMITTED THIS PLEASE BE MY FRIEND AAAAAAA

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): I wake up with this song in my head so often often now. I love it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally a flawless body positivity bop

**Death\_Soup** (9.5): who’s responsible for putting this in? I need to personally thank them.

**cyborglilith** (9): This is a very weird song. I remember randomly browsing youtube, which is very rare, and stumbling across this. I was weirded out at first but on a second listen, this is a bop.

**gannade** (9): Lizzo is an icon, but Good As Hell should have been submitted instead

**jamesfog** (9): Thicc queenie

**10footnotes** (8.5): The lyrics are a little strange, but she sounds confident and it’s a serious bop so I’m fine with it.

**dirdbub** (8.5): yes daddy please water me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I love Lizzo! I’m not a huge rap fan so I’m not super into her early stuff but everything after The Coconut Oil EP has grabbed me. I actually almost submitted “Good as Hell” for this rate just because of how much I love that song, so I’m glad to see she got a song slipped in. This is a lovely ode to self-care with a great music video. I didn’t quite “get” it the first time I listened to it, it took a few listens to sink in. She flows through this song like a river, the way she transitions between the rapid fire rap verses and those weird high notes and sound effects is super impressive. This is a track of pure fun and vibes.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Um...what the heck is that cover art?! I....that aside, I can't tell if this is trash or a bop-and I'm not saying this in a 'so bad, it's good way'. It has an absolutely fire melody that makes me want to get up and dance, but on the other hand, this is a straight up thot anthem. Perhaps I'll compromise and give it an 8.

**shineflyer** (8): i recommend giving this a second listen, because my opinion of this one improves every listen

Probably the most difficult song to rate. Not because it was bad or anything, but it wasn't in the spotify playlists, just youtube. Thanks to people for seeking this one out and keeping the questions for this one to a minimum.

*Dude: Simple And Clean is a great song. Utada Hikaru's voice is so calming and yet so eerie at the same time. It's the perfect fit for this kind of song. The lines "When you walk away/You don't hear me say" is such a perfect buildup it gives me goosebumps. The fact that this came from a video game soundtrack is especially shocking considering how astounding this is! ** This is where I'd make a kingdom hearts reference, if I knew anything about the game. **

This song had the unfortunate problem of being the only song in the rate not available on spotify, which I feel definitely hurt it's chances of making it past today. Note to all artists: Put songs on spotify if you want to do good in a rate!*

#Clean

**cyborglilith** (11): Where to start? From the beginning. I discovered this song a long time ago. I think it played in a commercial for Kingdom Hearts? My sister was also there, and on the first listen, we were captivated. Everything about Simple and Clean is perfect: the Kingdom Hearts aesthetic, which I can clearly visualize without ever having been in the fandom, is amazing, but the song is even better. Hikaru’s desperate, resonating voice reflects on the past, enjoys the present, and hopes for a bright future. Coupled with the lyrics I think I can understand but don’t seem to be able to grasp completely, her voice takes me to a dimension more immersive than ARTPOP can ever hope for. The clean production is just right. Even after all these years, I have never forgotten about this sacred gem, which unapologetically pops up in my mind from time to time, in a similar fashion to Jason Mraz’s I’m Yours; I don’t try to shoo away the nostalgia. I can still sing this piece of the past perfectly without looking it up, and I’m rating it by memory. It sucks that Japanese music is difficult to access now, and I have to go on youtube to listen to this, but it’s worth it every time. To fully experience it and cry to a song (something Melodrama, a perfect and meaningful album, failed to do) for the first time in my life, I believe I have to play Kingdom Hearts. Thanks to whoever decided to include this song for making me remember.

**agentofscranton** (10): yas this childhood bop, I’m personally a bigger fan of the Japanese version, but I can’t not give this iconic videogame theme the full marks

**gannade** (10): im not a weeb but this song goes off

**LandoFreeman** (10): invented video games

**Mysario** (10): THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE TAKING KAIRI'S HEART

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): hilary duff is shook? touch it (final fantasy orchestral version) is shook? every video game soundtrack ever invented is shook?

**VeganSquash** (10): I've never played Kingdom Hearts, but I know this song because its I C O N I C. The orchestral version is hands down one of the best soundtrack pieces I've ever heard.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.9): She is the queen and I hope we’re all giving her the respect she deserves.

**enecks** (9): A bop that is indeed simple and clean, unlike the clusterfuck of a Kingdom Hearts timeline

**jamesfog** (9): Wiggy

**johnazoidberg-** (9): Major Key(blade)

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the most rewarding part of any Kingdom Hearts playthrough is getting to hear this song in non-YouTube quality

**awryj** (8.8): I've never played a Kingdom Hearts game. If they're as good as this bop, I must've missed out a lot. EDIT: Wait that was a remix?! Well it was better than the original, but not much. Both versions are pretty great.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I was excited when I saw this song on the list because I love Utada and I had never heard this song but then it was a pain to track down a non-remixed version of it, and then it was not her best song. The lyrics are quite nice though, the song bumped up a point once I started really listening to them. However I watched the music video for the Japanese version and girl… she can’t wash dishes. As someone who washes a lot of dishes I was offended. But also, like, me.

**shineflyer** (7.5): nostalgia bias here I come! but really though, hikaru utada has such a good voice.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I didn’t know they let weebs on the sub /u/ raicicle

**zamomattel** (7): not me feeling this damn kingdom hearts song

**10footnotes** (6.5): Aw, this is cute.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6.5): Not a Kingdom Hearts fan. How does this work in a video game? Like, what? [screams in Koji Kondo] Beyond that, it's...fine. Again, the

**bwc222** (6): felt a lil dragged out and v 2000s emojified lol, it's aight tho

**rocketgamer31** (6): I'd probably like this more if I had actually played Kingdom Hearts

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): idk if i listened to the right thing cause it's not on spotify but this is pretty

**dirdbub** (5): sure

**Raykel** (5): Why is this song not available anywhere? Lol I had to listen to her sing it live. I'll remain neutral on this.

**timothy444** (4.5): Well, that was boring and not engaging.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): is it me or is the singer out of key, like it sounds bad

**Elitefourbrad** (4): okay it’s bad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3.5): I can't tell if this is a meme or not

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): This sounds like it would have been better in the original Japanese :/

#Take Your Passion

**followingfreeways** (11): this is one of the best songs one direction has ever made and it is BEAUTIFUL and deserves all the 11's in the world please fight me. 2:30 to 2:43 is 13 seconds of pure heaven on earth.

**poppinmolly** (11): god bless whoever submitted 1D to this rate!

**strawberryswing1** (11): My most played song on last.fm, and my song that I submitted to the rate. This song is honestly just perfect.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): ONE DIRECTION YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): Wow, my patience is really being tested here. I would probably give this an eleven under different circumstances, because this song really tied my best friend and I’s relationship up tight (I love dramatic metaphors) with a little bow and solidified our friendship and sent us back into the hell of One Direction fandom. This song is the prime example of why Liam Payne is brilliant and such a fucking idiot, because he’s excellent on this but refuses to deliver anything as good as this in his solo career. It’s stunning and a little heartbreaking.

**animefangrant62** (9.5): I haven't dived into 1D's music much but if it's anything like this I stan.

**jamesfog** (9.5): Wew, Fleetwood Mac are shaking!

**cyborglilith** (9): Larry Stylinson

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This kind of feels like something from Walk the Moon’s latest album?

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): First post-Four song of theirs I've heard that isn't a single. This is pretty good.  I feel like the pop rock sound it has is more interesting than some of Harry's debut, not doing to lie. 'Through the wire' is a phrase that belongs to Kanye, though!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Not the biggest 1D fan but this seriously bops

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): f

**shineflyer** (6.8): 1D really did just keep improving. this feels more like Fleetwood Mac than original 1D.

**10footnotes** (6.5): Nothing particularly special (at least to me), but it’s nice. I would listen to this on a rainy summer evening.

**NegativeFiveBelow** (6.5): I gotta say, it's much better than the 1D hate I've heard would have me believe, but I wish the vocals didn't sit so awkwardly in the mix

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): not my fave 1d song but it's cute

**enecks** (6): TOYOTA

**Leixander** (6): i wonder who sent this song part deux :eyes:

**rocketgamer31** (6): Decent chorus but I've never cared for this band and still don't tbh. This song is better than all the singles I've heard from them on the radio though

#And Make It Happen

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): nope

**gannade** (5): honestly i thought this was irene cara first and i instantly gave it a 10 and was disappointed when i discovered it was not on the spotify playlist

**awryj** (4): I don't get 1D. Everything about them seems so artificial, not even in an adorable cheesy Nsync way.

**zamomattel** (3.5): Trashdance (What A Feeling)

**dirdbub** (2.5): entirely too fucking boring
