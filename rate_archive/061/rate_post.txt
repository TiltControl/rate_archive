##THE RULES (as copied and pasted from the EDM/Pop Girls Rate)

* Listen to every song listed and assign each of them a score from 1 to 10. Decimals are allowed, but refrain from going past one decimal place - 7.5 is fine, 7.75 is not!
* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track!
* Rate all sixty-five (65) songs! If you skip any, your ballot won’t be counted (I’ll let you know if you do so you can remedy that).
* Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! Note that if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout it may not work - as such, I have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, and you should use a computer to send in your scores if possible!
* If you desire to change any scores after you’ve already submitted, simply message me (u/InfernalSolstice) and I’ll be glad to help!
* If I believe your scores include any form of sabotage (extremely high or low scores that have extreme differences between the rest of your scores), I’ll ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. It’s no fun if the results aren’t natural, don’t ruin it for everyone else. If you really do actually truly hate or love the songs I ask you to change the scores for, write a comment explaining why and it’ll go over far more smoothly!
* Your scores should not be considered confidential!
* It is highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, like this:

>Love Story: 11 Literally invented Shakespeare

* Any format other than this is NOT good and you’ll deeply hurt me if you don’t follow the example I'm giving here.
