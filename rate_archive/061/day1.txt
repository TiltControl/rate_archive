https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ar36bz/all_stars_2_rate_day_1_they_never_ask_you_haw_yee/

Good evening my east coast popheads!

This evening I am taking the place of the lovely /u/infernalsolstice who is too busy getting drunk at a party ~~with his boyfriend (I think)~~ He isn't with another romantic interest. Just a friend. So in his place, you get the third alternate, /u/_wailordfan, me! 

I am honored to take the reigns for the first day, and will reveal the first 25 songs from the group of great songs. 

I will edit in the list of all songs in the rate, as well as the list of participants, but here are some fun facts: 

1. 93 beautiful popheads participated in this rate!

2. The average score was 7.6374

3. The average controversy score was a whopping 2.2162, that means anything above this should be a controversial placement for a song! 

We will begin hopefully at 7:30PM EST, please join us here in this thread, AND over at the plug, where we will have a great playlist of songs picked by isol! 

**[THE PLUG IS HERE!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**

You know, I don't think this is that bad personally, but I can see why it came in class. It's weird, it's blunt, the lyrics are clunky, and it's for freaking Suicide Squad. Despite this, I still found charm in the song personally. It's also a really weird inclsion here in general, seeing as it only placed 27 in its original rate (Female R&B Debuts), with an average of only 7.362. A decent enough song, but very far from an All Star.

---
**enecks** (10): I refuse to engage with Kehlani so I'm just going to review Nuthin But A G Thang. And that is a classic - the beat is simple enough to be a recognisable meme, but the texture is there. And while the rest of The Chronic isn't super good, let's not kid ourselves this is a classic.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Dark, yearning, and well-paced.

**Brandon6099** (9): will probably go out in the rate early idk but I really dig this song a lot, kehlani slays

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Such an under appreciated song (with such an under appreciate artist).

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Bay Area Queen

**selegend** (9): this will be the first song out but it’s a huge bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): The first Kehlani song I heard, and still one of my favourites.

**nooodisaster** (8): when kehlani has an actual budget. Honestly the lyrics would be cringey if ANYONE else sang them, but she actually can sell them somehow? Bisexuals are too powerful..

**notdallin** (7.7): still kinda weird that this song is about Harley getting that joker d. good song tho

**ggodisawomann** (7): I like Kehlani's voice in this

**J\_Toe** (7): not m favourite Kehlani track. I guess I should have participated in the rate :(

**ReallyCreative** (7): Not the genre for me but it's okay

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): This is okay, but there’s not a lot here.

**swadadu** (6.3): This song matches Suicide Squad well and that isn't a good thing

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is corny but it's on the SS soundtrack so thats to be expected

**Arybeck67** (5): this ain’t it

**frogaranaman** (5): This is just okay.

**lilguavachan** (4.5): it's the best song on the suicide squad soundtrack so at least she's winning in that way.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): i love khelani but i do not love this at all

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): this song sounds like hot topic

**RVA\_101** (3.6): Maybe the movie would have been better if Margot Robbie had lip synched this at one point. Or maybe not. Probably the latter.

**wtferrothorn** (3.5): The fact that this is from the Suicide Squad soundtrack is a good indicator for how good this is (not very)

**Brendon-Urine** (3): no thank you... this beat is awful

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): what even is this doing here

**camerinian** (2): holy shit this is dull. I guess it makes sense that b-grade trailer music was the first release from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, but literally an inch out of that context destroys any need for this to exist

**xxrandooxx** (1.8): sigh

**ariannagrandtitties** (1.3): sounds like a white girl trying to be edgy

**ryjomom** (1.1): i guess she is singing

**animefangrant62** (1): I hate everything about this.

**radiofan15** (1): I have nothing against Kehlani but this is garbage, it's almost as bad and dull as a Ava Max or Allie X or Bleachers song... almost

**kappyko** (0): Sorry, Kehlani, it's not me, it's not you, it's this ugly production and songwriting between us. Why does every Suicide Squad song sound like Alex da Kid taking a giant shit?

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (0): this song is just so offensively boring. I feel like every element is just wrong, listening to it is an unpleasant experience.

**twat\_brained** (0): u/mokitsu I will not forgive you for choosing this when Prom and Cold Sweat were right there for the choosing.

**vhqv1997** (0): There is absolutely no reason a song needs to be written about Harley Quinn and Joker

A clear trend at the bottom is emerging of "a decent enough song, but not really an All Star". Work from Home came in in 31st in its original rate (Ex-Factor Excellence) with an average of a 6.798, and throw in a divisive reputation, and it was doomed to fail. Personally, I think WFM is a bit overhated, it's a fun bop, but there's nothing really special or deep or unique or original to it, and didn't really deserve a spot in this rate over, say, Little Mix.

---
**gannade** (11): i CANNOT believe this got out day 1 in the rate. Mixers can CHOKE. theres a reason why little mix havent broke thru to the US yet and its because the US has taste and little mix SUCKS

**kappyko** (10): I found out one of my friends isn't a virgin in casual conversation today. Good for him!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love Camila Cabello

**nooodisaster** (10): i mean it's no "Down" but

**rickikardashian** (10): I truly believe this got done bad in the original rate, and it will pain me see it get MURDERED again. Also don’t blame me for having to rate this again, I wanted to submit That’s My Girl

**selegend** (10): /u/imadudeduh suck my ass. any gay who gives this less than a 7 is deaf and deserves to get their gay card revoked

**strawberryswing1** (10): guilty pleasure bop

**tapdancingpig** (10): This was the song that made me briefly care about 5H. That ended quickly, but the song’s still great, and TD$’s verse is great.

**twat\_brained** (10): I have heard this song at least 200 times before. Let's make it 201. Being a Harmonizer in early 2016 was a prosperous time; the band were riding high off the success of Worth It and its parent album, Reflection, they'd confirmed a new album was on the cards, and with it, we got "Work From Home", a hip hop/pop tune which may be repetitive, but it seeps into listeners' brains and it's hard to get it out. We also have a guest verse from Ty Dolla Sign, who happens to be in a relationship with one of the members. Seeing the music video was like a rebirth of sorts and it confirmed any lingering suspicions I may have still had about my bisexuality. It may have bombed in the X Factor rate, and it may not even see the top 50, but I'm glad to have had the chance to rate the work of one of my favorite musical acts of the 2010s. Best of luck on your solo careers, women.

**1998tweety** (9.6): I wanted to give this a 10 but I feel like there's something missing. The chorus is kind of monotone tbh. This was so so robbed in its first rate though so please do it justice here.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Another ridiculously catchy song. I appreciate how tongue-in-cheek the lyrics are, and the rent-a-rapper bit works surprisingly well. I only wish the production was slightly more polished.

**Brandon6099** (9): YOU DON'T GOTTA GO TO WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK, BUT YOU GOTTA PUT IN WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK

**ManofOranges** (9): This song is like a guilty pleasure for me. My only issue is the weird sound that plays during Ally's verse. Like why is there an asthmatic dog barking in the song????? Doesn't make any sense. Still iconic though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I still remember going on a road trip with my family and half falling asleep and I think hearing my dad singing along to this song when it came on the radio. Could have been a fever dream.

**lilacsweetener** (8): The guiltiest of pleasures...also the video is perfection

**xxrandooxx** (7.8): This song is my “selling myself for sex on minecraft” anthem

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.7): we stan a stay-at-home mom

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): a victim of overplay but still a bop

**HerculesMeow** (7): Should've submitted That's My Girl instead because I know popheads hates this song :(

**ReallyCreative** (7): Chorus is fun, that's about it for me

**J\_Toe** (6): outshone by Rihanna (as well as that wild song with DJ Khaled, which until I googled it was also a song about work)

**ryjomom** (6): https://youtu.be/fGy8Dv0Yn3A?t=45

**notdallin** (5.5): reductive, unsubtle, uncreative, unrealistic. I’m not the first to say this, but I haven’t enunciated it in this way before—I’m so sick of pop’s constant sex-obsessed agenda.

**RVA\_101** (5.1): The toy xylophone rhythmizing with an 808 drum brings out a flair to the song that I'm not sure I wanted

**radiofan15** (5): I prefer Camila as a solo superstar rather than singing the same word ad nauseaum alongside 4 talentless nobodies with a beat stolen from the Rugrats theme song, thank you

**Roxieloxie** (5): this will forever be a discount "He like that"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This song kinda bops but against all these other tracks? Please.

**vhqv1997** (5): They said "work" a total of 95 times, which is 3 times more than Rihanna's "Work", and 46 times more than Britney Spears' "Work Bitch", for your information

**Arybeck67** (3): Utter. Trash. This was first sign of the downfall of Fifth Harmony in my opinion lmao

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3): I remember when i first heard this song it was on one of those morning show performances, and my mum said “this song is so annoying, it’s just repetitive”. My opinion is the same

**wtferrothorn** (3): let's just say I'm not a harmonizer :/

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i'm unemployed

**frogaranaman** (1): Camila sounds like a dying parakeet.

**lilguavachan** (1): and nothing of value was lost when they split up

**\_wailordfan** (0): holy shit what a shit song. How dare you all put this song into a rate of all star songs. I’m disappointed.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): I think the stigma for employees working from home since bosses are worried their quality of work will drop to something like this.

**camerinian** (0): Fuck me, when’s smoko

**enecks** (0): The fuck is this doing here?

**hikkaru** (0): I genuinely don't get the appeal of this song. It was my 0 in the original rate and it's my 0 here. The stupid lyrics, Camila's grating vocals (I don't dislike her, stream Consequences), mind-numbingly repetitive chorus, and mediocre and unnecessary rap feature are one thing, but oh my GOD the production on this song is SO FUCKING ANNOYING. It's got the booming trap beat we've all known to love over the past couple years (zzzzz) in addition to the blooping noises playing the same sequence of notes over. and over. and over again. Hearing this on the radio when it was big was maybe the worst time period of my life. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go stream That's My Girl, which would have been a far better Fifth Harmony track to include in All "Stars".



**static\_int\_husp** (0): Believe it or not, the easiest part of this rate was choosing what to give my 0 to. The only thing a gave a 0 in it's previous rate. Amazed that this even got picked to be here.

**swadadu** (0): This song is bad. Camila’s voice turns an extremely basic song into a bad and basic one. Insert that one live performance.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): if this finishes higher than my 11 I will request one of the mods to ban me from r/popheads

As one of the hosts who submitted this song from their rate, I feel a bit obligated to defend our decision here. We decided to add Act My Age because we felt that, due to its limited availability in many regions at the orignial time of rating Witness in the 2017 Ultimate Rate, where it came in 21st with a 7.284 average, it may fair better in a follow-up rate now that it's widely and easily available. This assumption was clearly wrong, despite it being, IMO, a highlight from Witness. It's a delightful throwback to Katy Perry's sunnier, brighter days of pop.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I fucking love this song

**lilguavachan** (10): #justiceforwitness

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i wonder how the Witness era would have been like if it took a direction more like this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is the best song on witness and it wasn’t even on the standard album

**twat\_brained** (10): I swear, you guys trashed on Witness just because it was Witness, this song deserved so much more. Katy has no obligation to do or say what everyone else wants her to; her life and her music are her own, and I'm glad she told us using this song.

**tapdancingpig** (9.9): HOLY FUCK KATY DIDN’T LOSE IT

**1313Harbor** (9.5): I fuck with this song so hard because I am very basic

**1998tweety** (9.5): Another song that should've been on the album. Again, it fits the theme and it bops. Its fun but also has a deeper message. WOKE. With that being said though, why is this in the rate when Bon Appetit deserved?

**Chevsapher** (9): Wait, what? How have I not heard this? It's far better than some of the singles off the album. The lyrics are a little cheesy, but Katy's vocals are satisfyingly dynamic, and the production is next-level.

**hikkaru** (8): This is such a weird pick for All-Stars but I'm kinda living for it tbh. It's a cute bop. Go off on those Witness haters, Katy!

**rotating3Dtext** (8): drop that f bomb katy!!

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): i mean, this is decent, but it's still far from katy's even best 20 songs

**Arybeck67** (7): after hearing all the hate Witness got, honestly this song wasn’t bad, it was just mediocre.

**frogaranaman** (7): – Tyler “Ninja” Blevins

**HerculesMeow** (7): I actually really like this song and its message. But I also think the lyrics for the bridge are pretty dumb. "How old would you be if you didn't know how old you really were?" ???

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Why was this the song chosen for this rate off Witness? Roulette and Witness were robbed again smh

**ManofOranges** (7): Soooooooooo... out of all the songs on Witness this one's in the rate???? I guess I just don't get the appeal to this song because everyone else seems to say it's great or something but I just don't hear it. I mean, it's not bad, but there's nothing special about it. I mean, Save as Draft and Power were right there but I guess they'd be at the bottom because taste is a hard thing to come by but still, in my opinion those are the true Witness stand-outs.

**plastichaxan** (7): Justice for Witness

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): I want to like this song so bad but it just doesn't work for me. The sound is there, but I just don't like the lyrics, and the chorus gets boring after a while.

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): Why the fuck was this chosen to be in this rate

**RVA\_101** (6.4): Points to you mods for making me unwittingly listen to a song from 'Witness'

**radiofan15** (6.2): Dance with the Devil outsold this Teenage Dream reject!

**\_wailordfan** (6): I was part of the group that picked this song, and I don’t know what I was thinking...

**camerinian** (6): I was ready to give this my 0 because I forgot what it actually was and I just hated the principle of a non-single from Shitness being in the all stars rate, then I actually listened and realised this was like one of 3 decent songs from it so I guess it gets a pass, but now I have Witness back in my Spotify play history so thanks for nothing GUYS

**Roxieloxie** (6): something something one direction remains unbothered

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): not terrible

**gannade** (5): an interesting choice to include this filler in a sea of bops

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why was this in instead of Roulette

**J\_Toe** (5): sorry katy, you've never clicked with me

**vhqv1997** (5): Where is Bon Appetit?

**wtferrothorn** (5): I don't hate it...

**notdallin** (4.2): and nothing of value was lost

**ariannagrandtitties** (4): shoulda stayed in 2010

**enecks** (4): What are you doing here

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Man, Katy Perry should be glad that Fifth Harmony is here to steal the 0 from this song

**xxrandooxx** (4): boring

**ryjomom** (3.4): Funky beat, lyrical choices...

**selegend** (3): shouldve been left in 2010

**kappyko** (2.5): Awkward production/mixing ruins a really cute Katy performance. Why?

**Brendon-Urine** (0): Katy honey... no...

**nooodisaster** (0): So here's the TEA about this mess. There's a subsection of Katycats that are bitter about Witness flopping and believe (delusionally) that if this was the lead single, it would've hit #1 and Katy would still be huge. What that theory doesn't take into account is several things, one being that this song SUCKS. It sounds like a cheap Prism B-side from the dated production to Katys worst habit of awful cliche filled songwriting. Evidently one of the rate hosts believes in the theory tho and made everyone rate deluxe versions of all the albums just so this could be included, and once that flopped, included it in All Stars. Bone Apple Tea, bitches.

**saucymac** (0): This song had 4 writers and they all were like "yes, this is it, this song does not need to be improved", and then it went through a lot of other people and they all said "the people need to hear this song", and it was released. "how old would you really be if you didn't know how old you really were?" 70 bitch because this song aged me. Also while i'm ranting Katy was what? 31? when she wrote this, does she really think we believe she looks in the mirror and is like "wow i look old but boy do i feel young!". this is it, this is my hill to die on. The music doesn't even have the decency to make up for the lyrics. Its generic as fuck.

Yeah Right was, in theory, an obvious song to submit from the 2017 Hip Hop Rate, due to its second place ranking, 9.060 average, and a general sub liking for Sophie. However, the song just feels too niche to work for anyone outside of the small overlap between hip-hop fans and Sophie fans, which is essentially the popheads who chose to do the 2017 Hip Hop rate. In a wider sub rate, it never really stood a chance. Sophie's style in this (and many others) seems to simply be too brass and over-the-top when placed against other songs. Vince Staples was great on this imo, but Sophie's style is just too much for me.

---
**camerinian** (10): This is a perfect synthesis of every single artist involved that somehow doesn’t sacrifice any of their unique qualities, yet works as a perfect hip hop banger. A Kendrick and Sophie collab should not work on paper, but fuck they both snapped

**enecks** (10): SOPHIE produce more rap music please

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Vince + Kendrick + SOPHIE is perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Quite literally, the only good SOPHIE song.

**lilguavachan** (10): sophie (and flume) did that

**piccprincess** (10): BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT BOY YEAAAAHHH

**tapdancingpig** (10): Yes to Sophie, yes to Kendrick, HELL YES TO VINCE STAPLES! This song will get robbed, but it’s brilliantly good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): screams in pots and pans

**radiofan15** (9.5): No surprise this sub embraced this song that easily, seeing that Kendrick, SOPHIE and Flume are here... I dig it, of course.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Vince x Kendrick = match made in heaven

**wtferrothorn** (9.5): Bless u SOPHIE <3

**Brendon-Urine** (9): SOPHIE for president 2020. I just want her to produce every song ever.

**Chevsapher** (9): Abrasive and messy in the very best way.

**frogaranaman** (9): Fuck all y’all that disagree, this song slaps hard. [5]

**hikkaru** (9): Sophie and flume snapped ugh. EDM rate teas... isol do my rate pls

**LuckyKidA** (9): probably Kendrick's 2nd best verse of his entire career

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Your face is the front of shop? BOI YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT YEAH RIGHT. The way it goes from Vince's flow, to KUCKA's singing, then to Kendrick's guest spot; this is a definite SOPHIE production, I don't even know where Flume fits into this. That said, this is a great change of pace for SOPHIE, imagine a collab between her and Cupcakke or Tkay Maidza!

**Arybeck67** (8): good confusion?

**kappyko** (8): Okay, this is either last place or second to last place. SOPHIE + rap? A recipe for /r/popheads rate disaster!

**rotating3Dtext** (8): don't listen to it on a plane. It hurts

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3): this feels like the rap version of faceshopping. The heavily distorted production, the weird break in the middle that sounds like a pleasent nice normal song, and then back to normal. Except this song doesn't pull it off

Girls is definitely one of the most accessible songs from the 2013 Alt Rock Rate, where it came in 7th with an 8.268 average, due to it being basically a pop song. However, the vocals of Matty Healy have never clicked well with popheads, and they never really stood a chance against poppier songs, classics, and sub icons. Also, why wasn't this Chocolate???????

---
**animefangrant62** (10): They really are, huh?

**Arybeck67** (10): yes she cannot be what you need when she’s just 17. (note: I’m a 17 year old girl and this song needs to be broadcast to all girls my age lmao)

**kappyko** (10): The 1975 have always been one of the most enduring bands of the mainstream Tumblr aesthetic rock. Before the vague political-isms, the proggy meandering, the long album titles, their aesthetic was simplicity with a touch of ambitious sheen. Pop rock with polish. "Girls" has the whole deal: pointillist dream synths, guitar riffs ripped this side of *Contra*, and Matty Healy being cooler than ever.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Rita Ora outsold

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): This track is The 1975 that I like. Snarky, fun and kinda immature but who gives a fuck cause it’s a bangin song

**twat\_brained** (10): Who let One Direction record "Change Your Ticket" without listening to this first? God, they were less original than I thought. Remind me why I was a hardcore Directioner. Moreover, when are we gonna rate A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships? Modernity may be a failure but this song is the polar opposite.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is pretty groovy.

**camerinian** (8.5): Hey remember when this band weren’t drowning in self-important wank and knew how to write a fun hook?

**frogaranaman** (8): Call Me By Your Name teas.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This is something that would play at Forever 21 in the background while shopping.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Man The 1975 can be really good sometimes

**vhqv1997** (8): "girls" is the only word I can hear in this song because it's the title

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I don't love the lead singer's voice but it's a cool song

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): not the worst song name girls i've ever heard

**Chevsapher** (7.5): This wasn't one of my favorite songs off the album, but I enjoy the crisp rock-pop soundscape. The guitar work at the end is the best part.

**hikkaru** (7.5): where's chocolate

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): this is fine but god they've gotten so much better

**nooodisaster** (7.2): I feel like the lyrics are .2 of the depth I expect from them, and beyond that it's alright. "A Brief Inquiry" was my AOTY so no hate to band.

**J\_Toe** (7): I really like the sound of the song, but I need someone to fill me in on the lyrics, cos I'm not too familiar with the 1975. Like, is this okay? How old was he when he wrote the song?

**moooo566** (7): i loev the 1975 but this is not my fave

**rotating3Dtext** (7): OK what's the deep meaning here I'm so tired

**unovachamp** (7): They're just GEWWS!! Breaking HEARTS! Also I appreciate this moral message

**tapdancingpig** (6.8): That disco groove is perfect. The top line isn’t great, but that guitar...

**RVA\_101** (6.5): Solid song from a solid album

**Brendon-Urine** (6): There are much better songs on this album, this one kinda falls short

**enecks** (6): I mean the 1975 is wank, but this is nicer sounding and less pretentious wank than their godawful new album.

**notdallin** (6): this song makes me feel icky

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Bleta "Bebe" Rexha (/ˈbiːbi ˈreɪdʒɑː/; born August 30, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer.[1] She is known for songs such as "I’m a Mess", "Meant to Be", "Me, Myself & I" and "In the Name of Love". She has written songs for various artists including Selena Gomez, Nick Jonas, and Eminem.[2][3]

**wtferrothorn** (6): Grade-A guitar licks, but uber-cleanly produced rock isn't my favorite flavor of rock, even if it's pop rock

**xxrandooxx** (5.8): This sounds like it could be on a toyota commercial

**ggodisawomann** (5): this was okay, I like it a little better than some of their other songs I have heard

**plastichaxan** (5): Me trying to listen to the 1975 is the "What's not clicking?" video

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.8): the only redeeming factor is the tempo

Nothing from the K-Pop Girl Groups Singles Rate, where this got second with an 8.578 average, was ever going to hold up here. K-Pop is too niche to work for the sub as a collective whole, especially when up against much more beloved song. However, that doesn't chnage the fact that Red Velvet are icons, Bad Boy slaps, and you all deserve absolute hell for letting this get so low thank you for coming to my TED talk.

---
**1998tweety** (10): A serious contender for my 11. This is my most played kpop song of 2018 and deservedly so. Switching to their Velvet side, RV delivers a sexy and seductive R&B track that leaves you captivated from start to finish. Artist: TWICE Twice are known for their big bop singles. Although they can get a bit repetitive and stick to the same safe stuff, its good and thats what matters.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): rihmember when Red Godvet took up the entire top 3 and redeemed the hot doodoo mess of the KPOP rate?

**kappyko** (10): I can understand xenophobia-heads with this a little but Red Velvet is pretty impossible for me to even not love. The DJ Mustard squelches and R&B influences are done with undeniable finesse. Once again, Max Martin is clutching his pearls watching these girls kick his ass. Back to the drawing board with you, Mr. Martin!

**moooo566** (10): gimme kpop goodness

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song could single handedly get me into k-pop

**selegend** (10): kpop perfection

**1313Harbor** (9.5): QUEENS

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Holy shit this sounds like 7 Rings but good

**Chevsapher** (8.5): I'm not fond of the "oh oh" vocals in the chorus, but the basslines are quite interesting.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This slaps not going to lie

**notdallin** (8.4): [I find this way funnier than it should be](https://imgur.com/O5mGemC)

**enecks** (8): REMEMBER THE FEELINGS REMEMBER THE DAY MY STONE HEART WAS BREAKING MY LOVE RAN AWAY THIS MOMENT I KNEW I WOULD BE SOMEONE ELSE MY LOVE TURNED AROUND AND I FELL BE MY BAD BOY BE MY MAN BE MY WEEKEND LOVER BUT DON'T BE MY FRIEND YOU CAN BE MY BAD BOY BUT UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T NEED YOU IN MY LIFE AGAIN

**RVA\_101** (7.6): Yes, a much better K-pop song than whatever was above.

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): this is good oooo

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I mean comparing this to Girl Front, it just doesn't quite match up. The melodies and hooks are cute, but they're not as bombastic and in your face as LOONA are, so I can't grapple as much with it here

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I went to a Lip Sync at my old high school and they did this song and tbh they kinda slayed

**ReallyCreative** (7): I don't really get K-pop but this is alright

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): dang that chorus is so good. Too bad much of the rest of the song is passable

**camerinian** (6): K-pop really isn’t my genre. This seems fun I guess, but I just have really struggled to jive with it when it’s not essentially just an EDM song

Paper Bag is just a weird song honestly. The lyrics are nice, Fiona's voice is great, but there's something that's just missing in her delivery here. It came in 5th with a 9.163 average in the OG Art Pop rate, but this is just another rate that was potentially too niche to really generate more than one All Stars contending song.

---
**\_wailordfan** (10): deserved better in the art pop rate, and will likely not do much better here... :(

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the imagery

**plastichaxan** (10): Why is Fiona such a relatable legend?

**swadadu** (10): This is my first exposure to Fiona Apple and I would like to thank god. Thank you, god. This song is amazing. I want to make all my captions on Instagram “Hunger hurts, but starving works,” but I don’t have an Instagram.

**RVA\_101** (9.5): Has to be one of the premier unappreciated songwriters of the 90s, if you consider her first two albums.

**notdallin** (9.3): this was my 11 in the OG Art Pop rate, but that rating feels weird to me now. I suppose I gave it an 11 because it was favourite in the rate, not necessarily because the song itself is an 11 (I wonder if anybody else rates like this?). Amazing lyrics and instrumentation, but not quite perfect.

**1998tweety** (9): The predecessor of Firework

**Chevsapher** (9): Somewhat monotonous, but instrumentally and lyrically fascinating.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): [insert katy perry firework meme]

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): Chill bop that builds into a beautiful and bouncy good time, Fiona is such a queen, though this isn't my favorite from her

**Arybeck67** (8.3): first Fiona Apple song I’ve ever heard and I’m pleasantly surprised.

**enecks** (8): I got her... paper bag

**frogaranaman** (8): Love yourself before you love someone else, it’s the only way to feel okay.

**wtferrothorn** (8): lyrics are perfect

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I'm not sure I "get" Fiona just yet, but this song didn't feel like the right introduction to her. The talent and songwriting ability is there, while the delivery feels absent.

**itsabop** (7): This entire album is underrated

**LuckyKidA** (7): i don't think i really "get" fiona apple, i must be an orange kinda guy.

**nooodisaster** (7): I feel like I don't hate myself enough to relate to Fiona, but it is catchy lmao.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): eh, I'm sure this is better in the context of the album

**J\_Toe** (6): hmm, i definitely heard a backing instrument which sounded like You Got A Friend in Me

**kappyko** (6): I wanted to drag this but I'm really partial to the swagger-y swing of this piano rock singer/songwriter stuff. This might be bottom 10 unfortunately but it's really quite good. Echoes a more stripped down, tempered "Mushaboom". I feel hungry too, Mrs. Apple.

**strawberryswing1** (6): Sorry I don't understand the Fiona Apple hype. She isn't for me.

**Brendon-Urine** (5): Still can't get into Fiona Apple's style :/ maybe someday

**camerinian** (5): I've never listened to Fiona Apple before, but do people really put this coffee-shop whatever up next to Bjork and Kate Bush? I don't get it

**radiofan15** (4.5): Paul Thomas Anderson's exgirlfriend left me... whelmed

**xxrandooxx** (3.5): I prefer a reusable bag

**ggodisawomann** (3): this song throws me back to the era when it was released which is nice, but something about the way she sings reminds me of the way Susan Collins talks which makes me want to die, so this is a miss for me

**ariannagrandtitties** (2): do u ever feel like a paper bag?

This ranking is one of them that hurts me the most, because Craving You is a spectacular country song IMO. The instrumentation is delightfully peppy, Thomas Rhett and Maren Morris play wonderfully off of each other, and it's super catchy. But, being a male driven country song in a popheads rate, this was doomed from the beginning. It came in 22nd in the Charity Rate with a 7.535 average, so it was never really going to do that amazingly here, but it was still robbed as all hell.

---
**ExtraEater** (10): /r/popheads cult classic

**gannade** (10): a duet between two legends

**ggodisawomann** (10): this was a contender for my 11 honestly, I love this crossover

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This song single handedly invented music.

**letsallpoo** (10): this is better than anything grimes has ever made (including kill v SHIT) and /u/kappyko can stay MAD!

**radiofan15** (10): Daddy Rheet and Pop Country Princess FUCKING SNAPPED, DON'T SLEEP ON THIS WHOLE ALBUM YOU HOES

**selegend** (10): better than most of what the twinks here stan

**vhqv1997** (10): Never heard this before and not even sure from which rate this song comes from but dammit if it ain't a jam

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This is the kind of country music I try to avoid, but this song is honestly a banger! It doesn't pander, his delivery isn't insufferable, and the melodies are great.

**animefangrant62** (9): I may not be big on Maren Morris but even that can’t stop this song from being a knockout country BOP.

**frogaranaman** (9): Yeehaw. [6]

**hikkaru** (9): "country" queens omg. Bebe is shaking. I've never heard this before the rate but it BOPS

**nooodisaster** (9): Still a bop.

**1998tweety** (8.8): 2 icons, of course it bops. Stream Girl and Common!!

**ryjomom** (8.8): Pop-infused country got me bopping

**twat\_brained** (8.8): What rate was this in? Also why does this video appear like a trailer for a studio filler movie about some knockoff Baby Driver flick? If nothing else, I rate them for thinking outside the box. OH right, there's a song. The song is okay, nothing spectacular or groundbreaking. I think it works well for both Thomas and Maren, whose voices complement one another surprisingly well. I can see this coming in at something like #36.

**Brandon6099** (8): Not really into country music but I could get behind this, Maren Morris slaysss

**enecks** (8): This is barely country but it's good

**Roxieloxie** (8): a man... in my country music.. and it bops... wild

**rickikardashian** (7.5): a male country singer? in my popheads? it’s more likely than you think. yeeYEE

**Arybeck67** (7): it’s not great, it’s just okay

**bbfan132** (7): i actually… kind of like this? it isn’t wonderful or anything but it’s a pretty good track for someone like thomas rhett (maren morris already had bops so)

**lilguavachan** (7): i mean it's better than the rest of the ugly white men singing about mud, trucks, and beer the rest of male pop-country tends to be

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): flight facilities weeps in the corner

**notdallin** (6.7): say what you want about “The Middle,” at least Maren wasn’t reduced to just harmonies and echoes.

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.6): im not fucking french fries

**tapdancingpig** (6): This is okay, but... why are you wasting Maren!?

**camerinian** (5): This would be substantially better with either more country elements or less, but instead a decent groove and harmony is thrown off by this funk production used to leverage twangy guitar plucks and the standard fucking lyrical references every Nashville-core song needs for some reason

**plastichaxan** (5): Maren saved this song

**ReallyCreative** (5): Cute face, but I think its scientific fact at this point that men shouldn't sing country songs, they still will for the rest of time, but I just can't relate to this or enjoy this on any level

**xxrandooxx** (3.8): Cannibal anthem, Hot singer too

**kappyko** (3): I'm so glad /r/popheads is willing to give so much attention to country artists, mainstream or not. However, this song does not fit up my alley. Take every criticism leveled at "High Horse" for pop concessions and take it up to 11 for "Craving You". "Craving You" is '80s in stylistic affectations, but feels heartless. I don't like the chorus lyrics, either. I would like to apologize to Will, my friend who likes Thomas Rhett, and offer a stream of Florida Georgia Line to make up for it.

**wtferrothorn** (3): I honestly have nothing to say about it. It's just really milquetoast

The fact that this made it in from the Mid 2000s Dancepop Comebacks rate (where it placed 9th with an 8.401 average) and none of Blackout did honestly baffles me a bit, since Gimme More, Piece of Me, and Break the Ice would probably all push top 10, and Get Together never really stood a chance due to its more subdued tone. It almost sounds like background music to something bigger imo.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Think about it; when you dab your Dabbing Arm is bent at approximately a 45 degree angle. The pyramids are also triangular and are roughly 45 degree angles. Start to see connections? Madonna understood this, which is why she wrote the song "Walk Like An Egyptian". Madonna truly is one of the brightest minds of this century. But that's not it. There's more about Egypt than most would think. Who was hiding out in Egypt, and had incredible powers? That's right, Dio Brando. Was The World a Stand brought about by mastering dabbing? Perhaps not, though images from the Speedwagon Foundation paint a very convincing picture. I'll let you be the judge. I've almost mastered the Dab, and when I finish my studies and research my power will be absolute. No one will be able to stop me. All the fundies and roasties will feel my strength. The Chads and Staceys will cry and scream "Please, u/Piffinatour, don't kill us!" and I will proclaim "Forget Gumwaa. Have Funwaa!" as I destroy them with my concentrated Dabs. The day of retribution is nigh, brothers.

**twat\_brained** (9): Of course I believe in the best song Kylie Minogue has made to date, Madge. I don't believe in Madonna's vocals, however, particularly in the first verse. -1 point

**notdallin** (8.2): I love that 2005 era Madonna was all about taking disco at a time when disco, or even electronic dance music was not big, and completely modernizing it and making it her own. It’s like she knew where pop music would be heading in the next 15 years and got a jump start on everyone else.

**J\_Toe** (8): wow, she really loved her telephone sound effects in this album

**tapdancingpig** (8): I really love this song, but it will get slaughtered.

**1998tweety** (7.6): Why is this here???? Break The Ice??? SORRY????????

**camerinian** (7.5): This definitely is a banger, but I feel like I would enjoy it 1000x more if I was shit-faced

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s good but a little lengthy which makes it drag

**ManofOranges** (7.5): I like this song but it's a slow burn for me. I don't really begin to like until like the last third of it.

**enecks** (7): I guess?

**ReallyCreative** (6.7): Meh, it's okay but Madonna's done better

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.5): it’s a song

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): Hung Up still is that bitch but this is pretty good

**Arybeck67** (6): agh shes trying so hard to be hip here but it just ain’t working for me.

**Roxieloxie** (6): I liked this one more than hung up so thats saying something

**nooodisaster** (5.5): Get [it] together: Me to the rate hosts when I saw this was chosen over the 83 better songs in that rate.

**xxrandooxx** (4.8): Parent trap did it first.

**wtferrothorn** (4.5): I feel like this didn't age well

**RVA\_101** (4.2): Yakka foob mog. Grug pubbawup zink wattoom gazork. Chumble spuzz.

**frogaranaman** (4): Boring as shit.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (4): this song is just a painfully generic eurobeat song that happens to have madge singing

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): this hurts

**kappyko** (2): Suffers from the same trappings that I found only mild on "Hung Up": weird mixing (hisses on every "Search" make me cringe) and over-staying its runtime. Oh my God it's perfect illusion

**ryjomom** (2): Confessions on the Dancefloor has BOPS but she is not that girl

Poor Tinashe. She has a lot of talent, but no one outside of popheads/standom cares about her, and she couldn't even succeed in that regard here. This makes the Female R&B rate the first to lose multiple songs. 2 On got an 8.828 and second place in its rate, but a terrible guest verse and trendiness in the wrong direction for popheads made this an obvious day 1 cut.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i have yet to hear this in a club and that's honestly a violation of the geneva convention

**Coll19** (10): TINASHA

**strawberryswing1** (10): We love a one hit wonder

**twat\_brained** (10): [I mean did they lie?](https://twitter.com/ELLEmagazine/status/527935873711886336) We're still talking about Tinashe to this day and now that RCA can stop sucking her blood she'll be free to maximize and fulfill her immense potential. I'm looking forward to future Tinashe music!

**1998tweety** (9.9): I wanna give this song a 10 but the awful rap feature takes off a little bit.

**radiofan15** (9.5): We love one hit wonders!

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): FUUUCK why do I sleep on Tinashe?

**ggodisawomann** (9): Tinashe and muddardondabeathoe did THAT

**nooodisaster** (9): Honestly I forgot this didn't win, it's that natural of a rate winner. In that it wasn't the best song in the rate, but so impossible to hate that basically everyone agrees it's at least good, and stans all agree it's godly.

**selegend** (9): far from her best but it’s still great

**notdallin** (8.6): That fire beat and that Schoolboy Q verse are the best and worst things to ever come out of a Tinashe song, respectively.

**kappyko** (8.5): Tinashe drew way too many comparisons to FKA twigs in 2014. "2 On" is accessible enough for all, eschewing the artiness of her peers and going for something many of them can't: fun. No wonder it was a hit! DJ Mustard snapped.

**camerinian** (8): It makes me sad that DJ Mustard's production is already starting to sound dated, because Tinashe really is drop dead stunning. Not sure about Q being so aggressive on his verse tho

**Chevsapher** (8): I'd probably enjoy this if I wasn't so embarrassingly white.

**J\_Toe** (8): oh how I wish Tinashe was bigger than she is now

**lilacsweetener** (8): should've been the start of an amazing career...oh well...

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): catchy banger

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It’s kind of sad that this is Tinashe’s peak song for success. I mean it’s fine but she’s capable of more.

**enecks** (7): Yeah it's OK

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): How this song became so big is a mystery but I’m glad it did

**ReallyCreative** (6.7): It's very okay I guess

**rickikardashian** (6.5): i really was tempted to give this a 2 and make my comment just “on”

**frogaranaman** (6): This is so 2014, holy shit lmao.

**Roxieloxie** (6): tinashe keeps trying to happen and after hearing this... shes gonna have to keep trying

**vhqv1997** (6): That rap verse gave me whiplash

**Arybeck67** (5.5): Tinashe has smooth asf vocals, but even that can’t save this track from becoming the mediocre trendy crap it is.

**hikkaru** (5): the gang vocals most certainly did not snap

**wtferrothorn** (4.5): really basic but harmless

Considering that St. VIncent is rather well liked in popheads and has even won a rate against Lorde before, I'm a bit surprised that this funky, upbeat, and even moderately catchy song from the Real(iTi) Art Pop Rate, where it scored 6th with an 8.661 average, faired so poorly here. I guess this song was just too weird sonically to succeed against more traditionalist pop songs.

---
**enecks** (10): Huh if you add Digital to bad albums you get a good track. What next, Digital Reputation?

**frogaranaman** (10): This is a classic. [7]

**kappyko** (10): St. Vincent's rise from /r/indieheads icon to one of the many stars that have niche stan communities on Twitter (one of my friend included!) has been amazing. It all started with the announcement of the art pop rate: the beloved Grimes! The sensual FKA twigs! The... no-name St. Vincent? Literally NOBODY knew who she was, and /u/letsallpoo can attest to that. However, her showing in the December 2017 rate was amazingly better than expected. Her showing in it was better than we expected, and she later WON her first rate as her Jack Antonoff produced MASSEDUCTION showed she could hold her own as a major label plasticine alt pop star. However, it really all started with this self-titled record and "Digital Witness". Hints of it can be smelled here: the warped electro synths evocative of futuristic urban cities (passed down from Congleton to Antonoff, surely), the cult-like lyrics and demands, the pure catchiness! Take some horns from her stint with David Byrne of Talking Heads and some disco guitars and you've got a tune that is filled to the brim with ideas of what pop could be.

**plastichaxan** (10): I live by "What's the point of even sleeping?" almost every day.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I love Black Mirror

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): ugh this was SO good live

**camerinian** (9.5): Look the lyrics are mad weliveinasociety-core, I get that, but the fonk of those trumpets and the fuzzy guitar and the groove over that chorus and everything about this from a technical level is peerless

**ggodisawomann** (9): SHIT THIS IS GOOD my v first St. Vincent song

**ReallyCreative** (9): I actually don't like this song as much as when I first heard it, but its still a great song

**1998tweety** (8.5): Having only heard MASSEDUCTION from her, this is not what I was expecting at all.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The chorus is lacking, but there are some really great moments in the production. The horns are amazing.

**wtferrothorn** (8.5): yaaaassss Annie inject that wacko funk into my veins

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I loved MASSEDUCTION but something tells me I'm not gonna enjoy Annie's self-titled effort; I appreciate her art but I feel like her music is an acquired taste. One which I have not acquired as of yet.

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): I've only heard 4 St. Vincent songs but they all have a very specific vibe that i cant place

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): decent, but definitely not one of my favorite St. Vincent songs

**ignitethephoenix** (6): eh

**nooodisaster** (6): Remember when I had no idea this was the St Vincent stan's favorite and rated it a 3, destroying its chances simply because I truly hated this song? THAT was iconic. But yeah, now that I understand her more from Masseduction, I've mellowed to it. The lyrics are still fucking stupid tho lmao.

**notdallin** (5.7): the subject matter of Digital Witness is tired now and was tired back in 2014. By then, people had accepted the ubiquity of social media and had started to embrace the positives of it, but St. Vincent rolls in 4 years after the discussion was pertinent with one of her most amelodic songs with one of her worst vocal performances over synthesized farting horns

**strawberryswing1** (5.5): I like the chorus but nothing else

**J\_Toe** (5): still don't get the St Vincet hype. pls someone explain it to me

**RVA\_101** (4.2): Fuhgeddaboudit

This is probably the biggest surprise of day 1 for me. What a Feeling came in second in the Ex-Factor Excellence rate with an 8.870 average, making said rate the first to lose all of its songs. It's smooth and catchy, with a pretty big chorus and generally great songwriting, and a fan favorite. Slutbopheads just finds this song uninteresting I guess, although it's super pretty.

**Coll19** (11): An underrated gem that I discovered while lurking this subreddit.

**lilacsweetener** (11): we need more 1d rates...

**Roxieloxie** (11): No matter what your personal favorite 1D song is I like how we all agree this is their best song

**ggodisawomann** (10): my GOD they did THAT

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is honestly one of One Direction’s best songs and yet it was never a hit. This makes me sad.

**kappyko** (10): I'm sorry for calling this boring in the X Factor rate so I'll make amends. I want to make a boy band now. Amazing vocal harmonies juxtaposed over a pastiche of the Christopher Cross-es and Totos of the world. Yacht rock done great, in a way that should have been a hit and deserves a poptimist raise.

**rickikardashian** (10): Blame Chris for making this song a 3 times loser, I wanted to submit Perfect

**strawberryswing1** (10): Y'all better do this better than y'all did it in the Charity rate!!!!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): honestly I didn't think I'd be handing out 10s like this but fuck this is such a beautiful song. well done Zayn and Harry and the other guys.

**twat\_brained** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWE9Ban5yQw the only thing I can think about when I hear this song. apart from how I still haven't got my soul back from when I sold it to One Direction when I was only 13. I miss when these fuckers were still a band and it hurts. Hard.

**ryjomom** (9.8): Best One Direction Song https://youtu.be/MWE9Ban5yQw

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I remember adoring the radio singles from this era, but I never actually listened to the album. This is great.

**swadadu** (9.5): The pinnacle of boy bands. The Beatles could never.

**1998tweety** (9): I love the mood and vibe this song gives off.

**frogaranaman** (8): This is a classic. [4]

**J\_Toe** (8): I never listened to 1D, but I like that one r/popheads comment that pointed out how Harry Styles' debut music isn't as worlds apart from 1D's later work. It's just that 1D was discredited for a) being a boy band whose music is aimed at girls (which is a sexist mindset) and b) because they're early music is a lot different, and chart-topping by design.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this is nice

**camerinian** (7): I really dig the groove, but 1D's best songs were always the huge, larger than life pop smashes, and restraint isn't necessarily a bad look, just isn't them at their peak

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This sounds like a good Maroon 5 song

**unovachamp** (7): I enjoyed this Irene Cara cover

**wtferrothorn** (7): why does the chorus sound like it's from 1985, and why does it still fit in with the very much not 1985 verses

**\_wailordfan** (6.5): it’s nice because you can hear each of their distinct sound, and what they used in their solo music, but this just sounds like a B-track to any of their solo work now.

**radiofan15** (6.2): WAIT... this is not Irene Cara

**enecks** (6): toyota

**ReallyCreative** (6): decent chorus but I just don't like their sound I don't know what to say

**ariannagrandtitties** (5.2): i may have actually listened to 1d if i had heard this song before

**RVA\_101** (3.2): In retrospect, not as bad a group as people chalked them out to be. Doesn't mean the songs are any less vapid.

I'm not surprised that a song about a girl murdering her friends while singing in an indie girl voice went out on day 1, but I am disappointed considering Billie Eilish's weird style and voices is one of my favorites in pop right now. It came in second in the 2017 EP rate with an 8.775 average. Perhaps its fall is due to more stiff competition, or perhaps its due to Billie Eilish's recent explosion of sub and general populace popularity, but either way, this fantastically written and delivered song deserved better. A HUGE grower.

---
**animefangrant62** (10): This is the edgy Billie I like. Do more of this and less of whatever it is you're doing now @billieeilish

**Brandon6099** (10): MY V IS FOR VENDETTA, THOUGHT THAT I'D FEEL BETTER, one of billie's best songs, popheads better not sleep on this bop

**frogaranaman** (10): I am now ready to go commit crimes with my friends.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): When the beat drops in the chorus, my soul is saved, my acne is cleared and I feel blessed.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Billie's EP is much better than the rest of her songs made after it.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just so strangely good. Like it's about murder??? Somehow that doesn't even matter like I stan having bodies in the back of my trunk now thanks billie.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): In theory, I should hate this song because of its premise and because of Billie’s personality. In practice, this is one of my favorite pop songs of the last few years, it’s just so massive and I just love the lyrics, the execution is just wonderful.

**twat\_brained** (10): One of my many previous 11s to appear in this rate, which I actually had the pleasure of covering last year. I might be able to find recorded footage of it somewhere. Also, I still LOL when I think about screaming at Billie to tell y'all to give this your 11s. Anyway, this still slaps and I'm looking forward to seeing Billie perform it live AGAIN at the When We All Fall Asleep Tour.

**tapdancingpig** (9.8): This was my first Billie song, and I was IMPRESSED! She sound amazing, the hooks are strong, and the lyrics are the right level of emo story telling.

**1998tweety** (9): I love that this song takes its time to get to the chorus, makes the payoff so much stronger. Honestly I find Billie a little overrated, but I'd be wrong to give this song a lower score cause I love it.

**camerinian** (9): I miss upbeat Billie :’(

**Chevsapher** (9): It's all very Lorde, but that chorus is perfect.

**kappyko** (9): Blah blah blah, oh my God avocado voice oh my God her image is so edgy oh my God she's an industry plant oh my God Spotify-core oh my God all her songs sound the same. Well, Billie naysayers, this take on singer/songwriter affair intertwined with bass-y dance synths is pretty damn unique. The minimalism isn't anything like the artsy-fartsy atmospheric muffled-hoovers on Pure Heroine, nor like the grossly transgressive creepiness of Melanie Martinez, nor like the intense attachment to appearing great that Halsey has.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): me when i overdo douching

**vhqv1997** (9): Unlike Billie, I don't have a bellyache after murdering someone

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): interesting lyrical content

**Arybeck67** (8.5): a depressing bop, of which Billie has many of

**RVA\_101** (8.1): I'm a sucker for reverb soaked harmonies and tasteful rhythm acoustic guitar accompaniments

**\_wailordfan** (8): not my favorite Billie song, and I adore her.

**enecks** (8): Billie Eillish is amazing and talented, but this isn't her best stuff. Her 2019 album is going to be fucking incredible though.

**J\_Toe** (8): first time I've heard this song, though I've already seen that video of that stan telling Billie to get people to give it an 11 (sorry to fail you)

**nooodisaster** (8): The lyrics are super emo middle schooler who watches Naruto, but Billie literally is that?? So I stan.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): stream Bury a Friend

**swadadu** (7.9): Keep everything the same, but change the lyrics and it would be much better

**radiofan15** (7.8): This is everything Anal Marx's 'Bland but Psycho' wanted to be and failed miserably by being an overhyped and disgusting piece of shit song that's only being embraced because people want outdated pop back no matter what... but anyway... what the fuck is bellyache?

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): This song is almost really good but it gets a little too weird in places, and I don't love the way the chorus is produced, a full on acoustic or electronica version would be better tbh

**ggodisawomann** (7): this is a pretty unique sounding song, I appreciate this

**moooo566** (7): this sounds like its going somewhere but never actually does

**ryjomom** (6.5): I don’t like many Billy Eyelash songs but this surprised me

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Eh it's aight. I'm so excited for her new direction, bury a friend is much better imo

**notdallin** (5.8): what’s that sound? Oh it’s the sound of all of billie eilish’s friends pressing the unfriend button as soon as they hear the lyrics of this song

**wtferrothorn** (5): The chorus alone bumped this up an entire point tbh

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.2): she sounds like she just took some zquil and is trying to finish before she passes out send tweet

**xxrandooxx** (3): This song is confused

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): still bad even long after the EP rate!

**lilguavachan** (2): the more i listen to billie, the more i just don't see it

**Roxieloxie** (0): Generic white girl youtubecore and edm do not mix well

**therokinrolla** (0): Hmmmm Billie is an uninteresting and unappealing knockoff of Lorde who is an unappealing knockoff of Lana. Her bad wacky persona is unattractive and overdone, her voice, spare a few songs, is weak and try hard, and her songwriting is about as interesting as a tootsie roll wrapper. Also this is my least favorite song of hers. Stream when the party's over tho that's the SHIT

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a masterpiece

**notdallin** (9.3): rare sighting of Jay out-rapping Kanye but the real winner is the thought-provoking hook from fresh-off-an-EP newbie Frank Ocean, where a towering hierarchy of rulers eats itself and becomes one eternal round over electric guitar

**RVA\_101** (9.3): When you hear an opening guitar riff like that you know it's about to go down.

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Kanye's verses a little bit much, but this track is coherent, well-produced, and lyrically interesting.

**camerinian** (9): The auto-tune second verse is literally the only thing holding this back from a 10. Everything else about this is jaw-dropping. Also I know we don’t really consider it but I love the video for this

**enecks** (9): yeah yeah fuck kanye (and he is the worst verse in this) but HOLY FUCK THAT BEAT AND HOOK

**nooodisaster** (9): Production? CHECK. Lyrical content? CHECK. Iconic-ness? CHECK.

**vhqv1997** (9): Frank Ocean and The-Dream are the best parts of this song

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): solid minus that random bit of autotune

**1998tweety** (8.2): Has a nice beat, but I don't get the hype.

**frogaranaman** (8): Y’all really gonna make me rate Kanye again, huh?

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I remember this meme

**twat\_brained** (7.9): This is the last song I'm listening to for this rate. The "you will not control the threesome" lyric is still a perturbance to me, and it feels like Jay and Kanye's verses have too many non-sequiturs for it to make sense. This isn't helped by the music video which depicts riots, which feel like a prophetic preemption of what's been happening in Paris lately. Frank, as always, sounds great, and is this song's saving grace, because boy does it need saving.

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): I can vibe with this.

**lilguavachan** (6.5): i love frank's part. the beat was wonderful. that trump supporter and beyonce's husband were... definitely on the track.

**animefangrant62** (6): Solid production but not a fan of the Frank Ocean hook.

**Arybeck67** (6): not my cup of tea

**ggodisawomann** (5): this sounds like video game music

**wtferrothorn** (4): I might be one of the few people that prefers Otis to this

**kappyko** (2.5): No part of this song makes sense except for Frank who really should have taken it all. Jay Z is fine, Kanye West sounds kinda contemptuous in an uncomfortable way, The-Dream does messily, the production loses its charm in 20 seconds. Frank singing the chorus of the song at the beginning is functionally the entire song's reason for existing.

**ariannagrandtitties** (1.4): okay whip em out let’s get this over with

Sweater Weather was basically the only hit song from the 2013 Alt Rock rate (where it came in 4th with an 8.561 average) to become a hit, so it's obvious that it would be included here. However, in the end it mostly feels like angsty alt radio filler made for people who want to feel aesthetically edgy. The 2013 Alt Rock rate becomes the second rate to lose all of its songs!

---
**1998tweety** (10): An incredible song, it does an amazing song of invoking a lot of anxitety and melancholy in me.

**animefangrant62** (10): This is just so damn good.

**frogaranaman** (10): Fuck all y’all that disagree, this song slaps hard. [3]

**J\_Toe** (10): it's not the kind of music I generally listen to, except for the fact that I listen to this song, specifically, a lot

**kappyko** (10): I'm partial to this song's emo trappings, plus I submitted it. Sorry "Hannah Hunt" gays! The only song on the damn album that doesn't sound drowned out in ugly melancholy sounds.

**ManofOranges** (10): Literal bop I didn't think sweater's could be sexy but here we are.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): What exactly is sweater weather? Like quantitatively, what constitutes sweater weather? Let’s find out. First of all, we can assume that Jesse Rutherford is singing about the temperature him and a woman are experiencing, and the lyrics explicitly mention that he is speaking to a woman, so this supports that theory. We know that both of them are in California at the time of the song, and we can assume that this song takes place in the winter, as California has very warm temperatures outside of the winter season. The average temperature of Los Angeles, where it appears the music video takes place, is 56 degrees Fahrenheit. However, a national survey shows that the average California resident would start wearing sweaters around 62 degrees Fahrenheit, which would also correlate with the fact that despite it being Sweater Weather, Jesse proclaims they end up shirtless, which directly contradicts the idea of there being cold weather in the region. So, perhaps, I would skew higher on the proposed temperature of what constitutes sweater weather, and I will in fact state that the most possible temperature for Jesse’s sweater weather is 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I haven't heard this in years, but it's definitely a grower.

**notdallin** (9.1): is there any more romantic gesture in this age of millennial love than wrapping your arms around that special person and holding their hands in the holes of their sweater?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): is this song good? not necessarily. will it always remind me of the last time i felt happiness? yes. therefore, a bop.

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I remember being the only person in my friend group to like this song

**twat\_brained** (8.7): this is weed to my ears. the tempo switch coming a bit out of left field keeps this song from being a 10 from me, but the b&w video aesthetic paired with the calming music just entrance me like nothing else. A great piece of indie rock from one of its most prosperous periods.

**Brandon6099** (8): CAUSE ITS TO COOOOOOLD, FOR YOU HEEEEEERE

**camerinian** (8): Weird to think that these guys actually got a major fanbase off of this song over all the other indie crossovers, given how they really haven’t done anything even remotely as good as this since

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i could've sworn the first few words of this song was sung by a woman

**radiofan15** (8): I can't believe that other garbage like Shup Up and Dance and RUDE! were Top 10 hits but this wasn't... America, you dissapoint me as usual

**Roxieloxie** (8): why dose he have a sweater if he's in Cali?

**nooodisaster** (7.9): Anything below 70 degrees for Angelinos.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): this is the only neighbourhood song that doesn't feel like it's trying oh so desperately

**ryjomom** (7): I haven’t hear this song in years, but I’m so happy I re-found this.

**hikkaru** (6.5): it's like -30 celcius rn i think i'll need more than a sweater

**RVA\_101** (6.1): Like indie rock on heroin.

**\_wailordfan** (6): Halsey wishes she was this angsty

**enecks** (6): This is a dead middle fluke indie hit sweepstakes winner - not exciting, but not bad. Radio fodder for people who think they're too cool for radio.

**wtferrothorn** (6): sometimes basic, moody faux-indie pop is exactly what the doctor ordered

**tapdancingpig** (5.8): Oh my God, that’s what this fucking song is called. The song is actually okay, but this guy’s vocal is awful.

Another rate is fully eliminated, as Don't Kill My Vibe is the second and final song eliminated from the 2017 EP rate, where it scored 5th with a 8.439 average. I love the massive chorus in this and I think Sigrid's voice is delightful, but I'm not surprised that people would feel to the contrary. (Maybe we should've had Rebecca Black instead)

---
**frogaranaman** (10): This is one of the best songs of 2017.

**kappyko** (10): Sigrid's "Don't Kill My Vibe" was perfect for its time and place, still sounds freshly anthemic, and yet lost some of its spark ever since she released "Strangers" and "High Five" which kind of did this way better. The climax of this is still one of the best moments of 2017 in pop.

**ManofOranges** (10): Sigrid really knows how to make a bop.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): big grower. i hope we rate Sigrid's debut when it comes out

**twat\_brained** (10): Sigrid's accent is so adorable and infectious when I listen to this; it just gives me so much life and so much joy. The video just elevates the spark of jubilation I get from hearing this tune. This girl is a brilliant musical presence, I should pay more attention to her.

**Arybeck67** (9.7): she didn’t kill my vibe

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): bad bitch energy in song form

**1998tweety** (9): Huge bop

**Brandon6099** (9): DON'T KILL MY VIBE, Sigrid slaying as usual what else is new

**selegend** (9): i know sigrid’s made like 3 worse versions of this which is sad because they simply don’t compare

**tapdancingpig** (8.8): Oh this is badass.

**hikkaru** (8.5): I think I actually like Plot Twist more. Still, Sigrid is a queen and I'm really excited for her debut album

**Chevsapher** (8): The production is interesting, especially the bass in the chorus, but the songwriting leaves a little to be desired.

**enecks** (8): UwU UwU

**Roxieloxie** (8): whats the norway version of targetcore?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): bangs pretty hard ngl

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I keep expecting her to say “bitch don’t kill my vibe” mostly cause there’s a Kendrick song called that.

**notdallin** (7.1): it’s a bold move to name your breakout song the same thing as one of the most popular singles by the biggest rapper in the game right now but Sigrid holds her ground here

**camerinian** (7): This doesn’t really showcase why Sigrid is such a promising talent. Like, the intensity in her delivery is really notable, but the production is just really bland trap-ish whatever. Give me Strangers any day over this tbh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Kendrick is shaking

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.7): did she just inhale helium?

**nooodisaster** (6): Vibe firmly in coma.

**ggodisawomann** (5): not my fav Sigrid song but good

**RVA\_101** (4.2): There's only room for one song with the phrase "kill my vibe" in this world, and it's not this one.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): don't kill my ears

**ryjomom** (3): I feel like was mixed or mastered weird.

**wtferrothorn** (3): Well this is bland

**animefangrant62** (2): I hate Sigrid’s voice.

**radiofan15** (1): Don't worry sweetie, you already killed the vibe more times than Netflix users killed Colin's dad in Bandersnatch

**strawberryswing1** (0): Sigrid stop making songs with quiet verses and weirdly loud/screechy choruses and overdone cliches in the lyrics challenge

This is probably the biggest surprise of day 1 for me. What a Feeling came in second in the Ex-Factor Excellence rate with an 8.870 average, making said rate the first to lose all of its songs. It's smooth and catchy, with a pretty big chorus and generally great songwriting, and a fan favorite. Slutbopheads just finds this song uninteresting I guess, although it's super pretty.

***

Coll19 (11): An underrated gem that I discovered while lurking this subreddit.

lilacsweetener (11): we need more 1d rates...

Roxieloxie (11): No matter what your personal favorite 1D song is I like how we all agree this is their best song

ggodisawomann (11): my GOD they did THAT

ignitethephoenix (11): This is honestly one of One Direction’s best songs and yet it was never a hit. This makes me sad.

kappyko (11): I'm sorry for calling this boring in the X Factor rate so I'll make amends. I want to make a boy band now. Amazing vocal harmonies juxtaposed over a pastiche of the Christopher Cross-es and Totos of the world. Yacht rock done great, in a way that should have been a hit and deserves a poptimist raise.

rickikardashian (11): Blame Chris for making this song a 3 times loser, I wanted to submit Perfect

strawberryswing1 (11): Y'all better do this better than y'all did it in the Charity rate!!!!

thenshecamelikeaaah (11): honestly I didn't think I'd be handing out 10s like this but fuck this is such a beautiful song. well done Zayn and Harry and the other guys.

twat_brained (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWE9Ban5yQw the only thing I can think about when I hear this song. apart from how I still haven't got my soul back from when I sold it to One Direction when I was only 13. I miss when these fuckers were still a band and it hurts. Hard.

ryjomom (11): Best One Direction Song https://youtu.be/MWE9Ban5yQw

Chevsapher (11): I remember adoring the radio singles from this era, but I never actually listened to the album. This is great.

swadadu (11): The pinnacle of boy bands. The Beatles could never.

1998tweety (11): I love the mood and vibe this song gives off.

frogaranaman (11): This is a classic. [4]

J_Toe (11): I never listened to 1D, but I like that one r/popheads comment that pointed out how Harry Styles' debut music isn't as worlds apart from 1D's later work. It's just that 1D was discredited for a) being a boy band whose music is aimed at girls (which is a sexist mindset) and b) because they're early music is a lot different, and chart-topping by design.

rotating3Dtext (11): this is nice

camerinian (11): I really dig the groove, but 1D's best songs were always the huge, larger than life pop smashes, and restraint isn't necessarily a bad look, just isn't them at their peak

ThatParanoidPenguin (11): This sounds like a good Maroon 5 song

unovachamp (11): I enjoyed this Irene Cara cover

wtferrothorn (11): why does the chorus sound like it's from 1985, and why does it still fit in with the very much not 1985 verses

_wailordfan (11): it’s nice because you can hear each of their distinct sound, and what they used in their solo music, but this just sounds like a B-track to any of their solo work now.

radiofan15 (11): WAIT... this is not Irene Cara

enecks (11): toyota

ReallyCreative (11): decent chorus but I just don't like their sound I don't know what to say

ariannagrandtitties (11): i may have actually listened to 1d if i had heard this song before

nooodisaster (11): Songs in the key of nope

RVA_101 (11): In retrospect, not as bad a group as people chalked them out to be. Doesn't mean the songs are any less vapid.

Arybeck67 (11): 1D??? No thank you, my ears are bleeding.

Brendon-Urine (11): Generic and boring :/

cloudbustingmp3 (11): Irene Cara outsold

A lot of the results of the K-Pop Girl Group Singles rate (where this was 6th with an average of 8.1869) were weird to me, but I was especially surprised that this was the highest scoring Loona song. This is cute and boppy, but Hi High and favOriTe are much better imo. I'm also surprised at how much higher this scored than Bad Boy here, considering Bad Boy beat it out in the K-Pop rate itself, and Bad Boy feels like it would be more generally appealing to Western audiences due to English elements. K-Pop Girl Groups Singles is now the 3rd rate to lose all of its songs.

---
**enecks** (10): Stan Loona

**kappyko** (10): If a LOONA stan told me to die I'd consider it considering nobody will ever release a song this good again. Max Martin is beaten at his own game and the xenophobes on this subreddit can't handle it!

**moooo566** (10): if only i had another 11 to give

**Roxieloxie** (10): stan loona

**selegend** (10): anyone who gives this less than an 8 is racist

**twat\_brained** (9.6): This song is a sugar rush. I think that's one of the reasons why I've never been all that into K-Pop; it's all high-octane, high-energy all the time. That and the working conditions for the members are despicable. This is fun, though. The only prevention from a 10 it gets from me is that weird low voice that keeps reappearing throughout the song. Apart from that it's a major slapper.

**Brandon6099** (9): All these comments gonna be saying stan loona but who actually knows a loona stan irl...... :thinking:

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9): i'm not sure what they're saying but they sure sound catchy saying it

**1998tweety** (8.9): This sub-unit is working a lot better for me. The chorus has a lot more punch and is way more memorable.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): This style of Asian pop is my guilty pleasure. The song feels disjointed in some places, but I love those synthesizers!

**hikkaru** (8.5): I probably should have actually done the k-poop rate because the boppy production in a lot of it is right up my alley, the only thing I don't like is the drop thing with the low pitched voice

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Maybe "Stan Loona" twitter made SEVERAL points.

**notdallin** (8.3): so I’m a k-pop convert. Do we memorize the romanization lyrics? Or is that problematic and we just say the occasional English words “cool!” “wow!” “all night!”

**frogaranaman** (8): Stan LOONA.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): bops, but i can’t understand shit

**unovachamp** (8): I just became a LOONA stan ten seconds ago.... what a bop

**wtferrothorn** (8): I think I #STANLOONA now

**xxrandooxx** (8): am i a kpop stan?!?!?!?

**radiofan15** (4.5): I got diabetes listening to this song...

**camerinian** (3): look k-pop really isn't my genre, but with the millennial whoops, pitch-shifted vocals and pop girls trying to rap, I still feel qualified to say I hate this. Good to see those remain awful beyond language barriers

**RVA\_101** (2.7): I've enjoyed K-pop melodies before. I'll probably enjoy more in the future. I don't enjoy this one.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2.5): not interested

**Arybeck67** (2): come at me y’all but I hate K-pop. Like, a lot. I’m somewhat biased cause I was turned away from K-pop after seeing all of these stans of them at school and just how flip flopping insane they are. It’s just, no.

**1998tweety** (10): HAIM and Q-Tip might have small parts but I feel like everyone's contributions make this song what it is. I don't know where this plays in the movie but its a great opener for the album.

**hikkaru** (10): Lana deserved her win but this was really robbed in the soundtrack rate

**radiofan15** (10): I gave a 10 to this one on the Soundtrack Rate and i'm reprising my score here, mostly because the combination of the two public figures who had 2018 controversies related to Whitney Houston's bathroom is better than expected

**ReallyCreative** (10): When the HAIM sisters come in, this song is sheer perfection, like this SLAPS as it is and then they come in for the kill

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is the most hunger games sounding song on the entire album

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I remember this song! My sister was obsessed with the album back in the day. This track is anthemic banger with a lot of great moments; HAIM's bit is probably my favorite.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): This is much better than I remember it being! Mostly because I remember the soundtracks rate being the most underwhelming rate I've ever completed so far. No offense to Carlie. This is brilliant, though, I need to check out more of Stromae's music.

**Brandon6099** (9): An interesting combination of people to say the least.... and somehow it kind of works???

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Somehow this random combination of people gave us a good song.

**notdallin** (8.7): it’s like someone made a board of trendy artists and started throwing darts furiously and said “yeah ok”

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): i feel like this song shouldn't work at ALL with such an eclectic mix of artists, but surprisingly it low-key bangs

**camerinian** (8): I always keep forgetting how this song goes at the end of it but honestly I’m adding this to my gym playlist, total slap

**enecks** (8): This is really good

**frogaranaman** (8): This song is so many experiences at ONCE.

**ggodisawomann** (8): didn't know if I was gonna like this but tbh I really do

**nooodisaster** (8): Lorde could spit on me and I'd wipe it off and put it in a bottle by my bed.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This song is like when you’re super drunk at 3 am and just start throwing shit from your fridge in a bowl and it comes out tasting fire as fuck

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): honestly just the fact that this exists is so wild

**ryjomom** (7.9): I didn’t know this song existed. I am in LOVE

**Arybeck67** (7): when I first saw how many people were freaking ft on this track I was shocked. It’s not a bad track, it just feels like it drags on, that it’s longer than it is and I lose interest in the track.

**jlim201** (6): I'd like this way more if the whole song was Lorde without that opening part

**wtferrothorn** (6): I never expected all these artists to be on one song, but I'm not mad!

**kappyko** (5.5): Stromae has been in more rates (4) than ABBA (0, 1/2 if you count "Hung Up"). Q-Tip is low-key the best part of this song, lmfaoooo. We're gonna make u famous...... a LINE

**RVA\_101** (5.2): If you told me there was an official collab between Pusha T and Lorde, I would have laughed our ass out of my complex.

I was really close to giving this my 11 in all honesty. Kelsea Ballerini is one of my favorite country artists right now by far, and this song goes hard. The chorus is super catchy, and it's just generally an all around great song. Popheads, sleeping on country songs that aren't blatantly liberal or Taylor Swift? Color me shocked. This hails from the New Country Girls Rate, where it came in 7th with an 8.444 average.

---
**poppinmmolly** (11): this is such a bop and a very strong album opener

**1998tweety** (10): This is a huge bop, I love the rock edge to it. The fast singing bit is cool too, queen of 3 genres.

**HerculesMeow** (10): This song SLAPS I don't care what anyone says. Yeehawing into 2019 let's go ladies

**ManofOranges** (10): I have never seen so much disrespect to an artist as I have with Kelsea and the country girls rate. Kelsea did not deserve ANY of that. XO is a classic. Peter Pan is a classic. Underage is a classic. Stilletos is bad, I do admit that. BUT, Kelsea did NOT deserve to be stomped on repeatedly so the delusion that 80s Mercedes is an incredible song could prevail.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I would love for this to be a dark horse winner. It’s a deep cut, and it’s delightful

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://media.tenor.com/images/fcc0a5c78c7741d49be8fcf7cc86d404/tenor.gif

**Chevsapher** (9): The actual chorus is a bit weak, but only because the rest of the song is so strong. For a country song, this is excellent.

**hikkaru** (8.5): I'm kinda shook this was voted in. Countryheads won but maren still outbops

**\_wailordfan** (8): I saw the ballot first and got excited that Beyoncé got a second song

**Roxieloxie** (8): Ex's and Oh's is shook

**selegend** (8): idk how this got voted into all stars but i hope she survives

**twat\_brained** (8): Wait this didn't get a music video? Yet it was Kelsea's highest-rated song? That's a double disappointment. Especially considering she sings like 30 syllables in 6 seconds or something like that. And I think the title is rather clever, too. Not much else going for it, though.

**ryjomom** (7.8): OMG carrie underwood who?

**ReallyCreative** (7.3): It's better than a lot of country stuff out there right now but it doesn't do much for me

**ariannagrandtitties** (7): XOXO

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this is halo 2.0 halo reloaded

**frogaranaman** (7): Yeehaw. [4]

**ggodisawomann** (7): I am rooting for Kelsea, her voice is good

**letsallpoo** (7): this song isnt that good. you guys just felt bad for miss tortellini

**nooodisaster** (7): I really thought we were gonna rate the Bey song for a sec :( First listen it's good tho.

**strawberryswing1** (7): In Kelsea's defense, this is much better than I remembered.

**notdallin** (6.9): ehhhhhhhh elle king did it better

**radiofan15** (6.5): This is not a Beyoncé song

**Arybeck67** (6): she sounds oddly like Carrie Underwood here? Just not really the kind of music I vibe to.

**kappyko** (5.5): Awkward chorus but it's fun! Kelsea seems like a more traditional country pop artist compared to the Marens and Kaceys of the world, but there's a great place for her.

**enecks** (5): I regret all the praise I gave Beyoncé's s/t. It's a bad album.

**J\_Toe** (5): I thought this would be the Beyonce version :( my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

**camerinian** (4): don’t make me tap the sign points to sign that says “no white girls rapping”

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): i'm sorry i just don't care for maren morris like that

**wtferrothorn** (3): not good pop country

**xxrandooxx** (3): XD

disappointed_but_not_surprised.gif Halsey gets so much hate here for her decided aesthetic, but that doesn't make her songs less fantastic!!! This is synth pop glory, and her and Lauren play fabulously off one another. This came in 11th in the 2017 Alt Pop rate with an 8.407 average, and I'm sure that u/CarlieScion is shaking rn.

---
**\_wailordfan** (10): 20biteen MUST prevail this year.

**Brandon6099** (10): SAID THAT WE'RE NOT LOVERS, WE'RE JUST STRANGERS, Halsey's and Lauren's voice go so well together on this song, one of Halsey's best song by far

**gannade** (10): Halslay and Legend Jauregui

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Greg Kurstin snapped

**Roxieloxie** (10): i've rated this song so many times i ran out of funny comments for it

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song was did dirty in it's first rate and I guarantee it will be done even dirtier this rate

**twat\_brained** (10): I love Halsey, I love Lauren, I love the song and I think the video portrays an excellent metaphor. It's my favorite Hopeless Fountain Kingdom song and probably my 4th favorite Halsey song to date. We need more collaborative works focused on same-sex relationships sung by LGBT musicians, and if they're anything like this, society and art would be much better off for it.

**itsabop** (9.7): Huge bop, best song off hfk

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Say what you want about Halsey, but it's hard to resist the highlights of her discography.

**hikkaru** (9.5): Ugh this is synthpop perfection, ROBBED from being a single. Halsey's second best song only behind Roman Holiday

**radiofan15** (9.5): I love the voices, the athmosphere and the melody... this is a goegeous song and deserved better

**Arybeck67** (9.3): chorus is pretty damn relatable, not gonna lie and their vocals are pretty haunting as well

**enecks** (9): This is the path Halsey works best in - relationship melodrama duets with enough of a retro groove to keep a pulse. Like this is incredible but apparently we needed Without Me to be a hit.

**ggodisawomann** (8.5): gotta give this credit, this is surprisingly good for a Halsey song and somehow I just added this to my library

**1998tweety** (8.4): If there's one thing I like about Halsey, its how unapologetic she is about being bi. At first I was not feeling this song at all, and tbh I feel like you guys overrate it because its a lesbian bop, but if we're being fair that's a valid reason for liking a song. I still don't think its a 10, but it has grown on me since my first listen.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I love their voices together but it’s just kind of a boring song and had more potential.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): tri-bi

**RVA\_101** (7.1): A duet that works about as predictably well as one would expect it to

**camerinian** (7): I like the production on this, as well as the narrative, but god I can’t stand Halsey’s delivery on pretty much any of her songs. Lauren sounds good for what it’s worth, I hope she ends up doing well for herself.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): it's... aggressively okay

**HerculesMeow** (7): I think Lauren should've been featured more in this song. "I must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind" is so good!

**ryjomom** (7): this bald bitch came through with nair

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIriwVhRPVA

**xxrandooxx** (7): no thanks

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.2): wait, there was more than one singer in this?

**notdallin** (6.1): somebody explain to me how this is related to Romeo and Juliet

**nooodisaster** (6): popheads really needs to stop with this one, it's decent production with messy lyrics and nothing else besides lesbianism going for it.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6): can you say OVERRATED

**wtferrothorn** (6): Halsey's best song still doesn't rank high for me. Sorry sweaties.

**unovachamp** (5): I thought this was Sigrid and was gonna rate it higher... nevermind

**frogaranaman** (4): Halsey stop only mentioning your bisexuality when it sells and start doing that all the time instead challenge.

**kappyko** (4): Turns out the way to get people to care about the too-often maligned Halsey is to make pleasant synthwave. It's fine, but hook-less. Synthwave pop did better on "Lightyears", sapphic pop did better with Hayley Kiyoko, songs about strangers did better with Sigrid in the very same year.

**vhqv1997** (4): Who put this here? Why re-rate this song when The Louvre and Supercut are right there?

**selegend** (1): this is so basic and overdramatic

If this was by Carly Rae Jepsen instead of Shura, this would be at least 30 spots higher and THAT'S the tea for today. What's It Gonna Be came in second in the queer synthpop rate with an 8.907 average, and honestly I do think this would've done a lot better if Shura had anything resembling name brand recongition in the sub.

**Arybeck67** (10): wow I love this song

**camerinian** (10): who the fuck is shura and why haven’t I listened to her before omg this is pure joy

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was gonna be my 11 until the wild card songs were added. pop perfection.

**kappyko** (10): Intimate synth-pop that makes teenage romance important. '80s revival has been beaten to death but Shura's idealizations of love in the music have always felt a step ahead of the pack.

**letsallpoo** (10): highkey deserved to win. amumu did nothing wrong

This is kind of a classic to a degree, but also like, it's absolutely pure fluff, and it's very blatantly dated and only really respected nowdays due to nostalgic factors most likely. This came in third in the All-Time Classic rate with a 9.185, and honestly I'm surprised it even made it this far here.

---
**Arybeck67** (11): Omfg this song is just the definion of heartbreak and tragedy. What a fool I would be if I DIDN’T give this song my 11. This is one of those songs you start to understand as you get older and holy crap, I understand it now.

**animefangrant62** (10): If you don’t stan this song you must be deaf or lying.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): fuck beatless lives beach boys are skinny

**enecks** (10): This is one of those songs that will outlive humanity as a work of immortal genius.

**kappyko** (10): /r/indieheads is going to kill us when they see the ranking for this one, man! "Greatest pop song ever made" might be the words that exit most of their lips, but I'll settle for "one of the greatest." The sprightly gait of this song is lush and has only been contested by the Beatles and the Zombies. This song still beats those two out in how much weird stuff they get away with, though: horse clip-clops, sleigh bells, a quick organ (?) interlude, and harmonies that practically scream at Animal Collective to forget their careers at the door. It's romantic as hell and deserves its place in the pop canon.

**notdallin** (10): should any middle school band kid attempting to play the French horn doubt the beauty of their instrument, play the intro to this song and illuminate them on what they can become

**strawberryswing1** (10): One of my top 3 favorite songs ever, and one of the greatest songs of all time.

**vhqv1997** (10): I love when BBC Music did a cover of this song featuring like 30 different artists and bands

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): iconic

**wtferrothorn** (9.5): hauntingly beautiful

**RVA\_101** (9.2): Ethereal beauty; Brian Wilson is a genius.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): I think Pet Sounds is a little overrated, but this song is an obvious exception.

**Chevsapher** (9): I've never heard this, but the production is something else!

**ggodisawomann** (9): I was not expecting this song to be on here but I love the youthful, tropical sound that the Beach Boys had so I love this

**nooodisaster** (9): VoHiYo ~cute chat only~ VoHiYo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): God Only Knows Why Dreams Lost This Rate

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I feel like this song has become a Christmas song, even though it’s not. I think it’s a jingle bells at the beginning.

**1998tweety** (8.2): A bit boring, but the lyrics are cute.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): I mean for everyone who complains how repetitive modern day music is you don't have much of a leg to stand on here. Speaking of which did the Beach Boys use clopping horseshoes for the beat here? +2 if they did, that's a great way to think outside the box

**1313Harbor** (8): The rounds are so ethereal and pleasant

**J\_Toe** (7): I mean, I can see it doing well on certain rates, but not on an All Star rate (oh god, I sound just like gia gun :P )

**Roxieloxie** (7): it's not bad but it's not amazing

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): Never been a Beach Boys fan but it's okay I guess?

See You Again came in 3rd in the 2017 Hip Hop rate with a 9.014 average, which is now yet another rate to have all of its songs eliminated. Tyler and Kali both sound great here, but the song feels really underbaked and lacking a climax that it felt it was building too. It had a lot of potential but it just really ended up falling short for me personally.

---
**Brendon-Urine** (10): Kali really killed her performance on this one. Amazing hook.

**enecks** (10): I used to consider this a low in Flower Boy, but one day it clicked and it just made me start sobbing. The beat change is awe-inspiring.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Why is this song so soothing

**kappyko** (10): Hi please notice me @ person i like thx

**ManofOranges** (10): This song came out of left field. I saw it and I was like I'm probably not gonna like this but it's a 10 like wow.

**plastichaxan** (10): I would die for the Kali Uchis/Tyler, the creator combo

**radiofan15** (10): I still miss the Old Tyler but I'm not mad with his new direction; this song is just one example of why he's one of the greatest right now

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): can't believe he really just blessed us with Flower Boy like that

**selegend** (9): tyler is a gay icon

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CxK8EKFwMc&feature=youtu.be

**wtferrothorn** (9): 2011 Tyler would be shook that 2018 Tyler made this

**notdallin** (8.5): the most delicate Tyler can get and it really shines

**1998tweety** (8.4): This song has Kali on it so I expect it'll be my fav on the album.

**camerinian** (8): Part of me thinks the sadboi set really overrates this song, as if they've never heard a melancholic hip-hop song before, but also I'd be lying if I didn't say that everyone really did turn out on their performances here.

**Chevsapher** (8): I was expecting Charlie Puth, but this is nice too.

**J\_Toe** (7): it's okay

**nooodisaster** (7): I'll agree, this is nowhere on the level of Miley Cyrus' "See You Again", but it's cute.

**twat\_brained** (7): this reminds me I still need to check out Isolation. Eyy, I like the 4/20 reference in the first verse. All in all I think it's good music for chill vibes and all that good shit, but it's not gonna wow me enough to deserve a day 3 spot.

**ggodisawomann** (6): not what I expected from TTC but this is good actually

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): did Charli XCX write this

**RVA\_101** (4.8): Shares title with a Furious 7 track. Furious indeed.

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.2): see you never

This was another big surprise for me today, because even if country is fairly disliked by popheads in general, 80s Mercedes is essentially a straight up pop song, and only really country by artist association. This came in third in the New Country Girls rate with a 9.180, and deserved much much MUCH better. At least Follow Your Arrow survives day 1!

---
**1998tweety** (10): I know this is a country song but I love the huge pop song chorus, and I appreciate that it takes time to get there cause it makes it feel more rewarding.

**\_wailordfan** (10): the second best country song in this rate

**Chevsapher** (9): Cute song, fun hook.

**selegend** (9): maren morris has more billboard top ten hits than tinashe. why?

**tapdancingpig** (8.9): This song is delightful.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): The video is evidently cheap, and the song doesn't feel all that country compared to most of Hero, but I still get a bit of a kick out of it. I'm not planning to give it another 11, but I'm happy to be hearing it again.

**ggodisawomann** (8): god yes Maren

This is the second and final song out from the Mid 2000s Dancepop Comebacks rate (where it scored an 8.687 average and 8th place), and honestly this song is really catchy and fun and has like 50 million hooks in it, but I can see why it's out now. The delivery of the "wowowowow" hook can be offputting for sure.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITP1QfRAFEw

**moooo566** (10): wow

**selegend** (10): pop perfection

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This song is lyrically generic, and perhaps even campy, but I've loved it for years. The buoyant electropop production puts it among the highlights of Kylie's discography.

**notdallin** (9.2): this song was a part of a musical renaissance I experienced in 2007 where I realized that there was more music outside of what I heard on the radio and what was pimped by my siblings. For a while, I felt like I was the only one who knew this song and because it sounded like nothing else out there in pop music in 2007, it felt special and individual to me. Today Kylie’s theme park exclamations pay off and sound natural in our post-electropop world and now I have a whole sub to empathize with me about how wowing this song really is.

**camerinian** (9): I can’t tell if this was ahead of its time or too late to it, but dang it bops

**ggodisawomann** (9): ahhh Kylie

**plastichaxan** (9): Kylie deserves more recognition for all the quality she delivers

**ReallyCreative** (9): I'm convinced that no one has as much fun as Kylie, she's able to convey something most other artists can't

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): owen wilson intensifies

**1998tweety** (8.8): A bop on an album for of duds, The One deserved this spot.

**radiofan15** (8.5): WOW indeed

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): ya waawaawaawooooooooow

**twat\_brained** (8.2): It's super dancey, and with the color palette of the music video I'm glad to call this a bisexual anthem. What's preventing 10 status is how the climax of the chorus just feels clunky; I'd prefer if it was "you make me go wow" or "you got me like wow" or something like that instead of just "wow" four times

**Roxieloxie** (8): wow

**ryjomom** (7.5): title really summed it up

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This is a cute bop, but nothing really more.

**enecks** (7): If you swap the w and o you get owo

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Not a fan of Kylie’s voice in this song with the weird effects, but it’s okay otherwise

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Post Malone is shaking a bitch

**vhqv1997** (7): Owen Wilson's favorite song

**kappyko** (6.5): I always expect the "wowowowow" part to be better than it ever is. I appreciate the French house influences that Kylie incorporates there, but nothing ever feels tightly written on this song. It feels like it fell down a staircase into bop status.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): posty sweatie i'm so sorry

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): I love sugar in my funk, but this is a LOT of sugar

**Arybeck67** (6): ...her voice...annoys me.

I'm open that I've never really been a big fan of Kimbra, because I find her voice really offputting. That being said, this song is moderately better than some of her others, although it really doesn't hold a candle to anything else in this rate for me. Cameo Lover comes from the 2010s Indie-Pop Debuts rate, where it came in third with a 9.138 average. Let's all be thankful for a moment that Dog Days Are Over was fan-voted in.

---
**camerinian** (10): What a magical, euphoric song. The chorus is a beautiful explosion of joy, and that key change is mind-blowing. Why tf don't she play this live anymore

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): OPEN UP YOUR FUCKING HEART, /R/POPHEADS

**ExtraEater** (10): dictionary example for "uplifting (adj.)"

**J\_Toe** (10): THE BLINDFOLDED GUY IN PINK IN THE MV WAS ON A SEASON OF AUS SURVIVOR!

**kappyko** (10): Pop soul excellence that will undeservedly get dragged by this new audience as she never found her audience of Tumblr girls like Lana or Marina. Sad, because Kimbra has more creativity filling her veins than any other star this generation. Fuck your avocados, it's radical soul pop with heart.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I will never forgive popheads for letting Marina win, never

**twat\_brained** (10): Initially my 11 when I completed this song's parent rate, I have not yet listened to Golden Echo or Primal Heart yet. Cameo Lover's magic isn't lost on me, thankfully. It's grand, it's overpowering, and it's guaranteed to command attention wherever it goes. I'm glad Kimbra is saying "Open up your heart" to me, I'm inspired to check out her other music. If it's anything like Cameo Lover, I'll be mighty chuffed.

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): Music video for this song is amazing, but it's also fantastic on its own

**1998tweety** (9.3): This is very good, jamesfrog made points.

**Chevsapher** (9): A bit wordy, but that arrangement is magical.

**enecks** (9): Kimbra was kinda a cameo in terms of musical history. Shame - she's got talent.

**notdallin** (8.8): Kimbra, like her niche partner-in-crime Gotye, is such an anomaly. Everything she put out in 2012 sounded like nothing else out there in the pop landscape. And oddly, it sounds like nothing else out there today either.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): I been sleeping on Kimbra and today I say Not Anymore

**Roxieloxie** (8): open up your heart and dont let this go out day one

**tapdancingpig** (8): This is cute.

**wtferrothorn** (8): 'The Golden Echo' is my favorite Kimbra record, but she definitely snappedd here

**\_wailordfan** (7): I can’t really get into Kimbra much, I don’t think I love her voice paired with her production choices.

**Arybeck67** (7): nice but I feel blasé after it

**frogaranaman** (7): It gives me electronic doo-wop glam vibes which is very enjoyable!

**LuckyKidA** (7): she has a very big mouth

**RVA\_101** (2.8): If you're like me, you came to her from Gotye's song hoping she had more of that in her. Whatever it was, it wasn't found in this song.
