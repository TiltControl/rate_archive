Love Story came in second in the 2008 Super Mega Ultimate Deluxe rate with a 9.223 average. For a while, this was surprisingly struggling to crack the top 20, so I‚Äôm very glad it pulled through in the end and made it to day 3, because it‚Äôs one of Taylor‚Äôs classic, signature songs, and for good reason too. Every part of this song just screams iconic.

---

**animefangrant62** (11): This is one of the big songs she‚Äôll be remembered for, in a good way.

**ManofOranges** (11): One of Taylor's best songs of all time. Fucking wig and a half.

**Arybeck67** (10): In the ‚Äúwise words‚Äù of Kanye West when he ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift discovered Shakespeare

**Coll19** (10): MARRY ME JULIET YOU NEVER HAVE TO BE ALONE

**ExtraEater** (10): i like the positive twist on the story

**ggodisawomann** (10): tbt to the heart patterns on the light up bracelets at rep tour

**ImADudeDuh** (10): taylor fucking ICONIC song!

**itsabop** (10): Fearless is such a good album

**moooo566** (10): 50% responsible for me listening to pop music in the first place

**strawberryswing1** (10): You Belong With Me is superior but this is one of the songs that is so good that even people who don't care about Taylor enjoy it.

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is probably in my top 10 for Taylor. It‚Äôs just a perfect pop song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): incessant headbanging when the chorus hits

**twat\_brained** (10): As I saw the ballots roll in I was very disappointed that Britney wasn't gonna win but I felt even worse for the Swifties who would have to see their girlie come as close as she has yet to winning a rate only to lose to Hot n Cold. Realistically I don't see it winning either this rate or the 2009 year end rate, but I'm on your side, Swifties of r/popheads.

**vhqv1997** (10): insert comment about key change here

**1998tweety** (9.5): Usually I'm not a huge fan of songs that rely too much on existing stories that everyone knows, but for some reason this works. I think its the way Taylor say ‚Äúits a love story, baby just say yes‚Äù. Its aware that this is a common trope, but thats fine cause sometimes its really the best way to convey a message. I also love this thing Taylor does where she switches the last chorus in the song, something she later does on Speak Now for example.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.2): BABY JUST SAY YES we all love a happy ending

**Brendon-Urine** (9): THE KEY CHANGE >>>>>>

**Chevsapher** (9): One of the better songs from Taylor's yeehaw days. The fiddle (?) is probably my favorite part.

**frogaranaman** (9): This is a classic. [8]

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song is great until you remember the real story of Romeo and Juliet. Then it‚Äôs just good.

**ryjomom** (9): 9th Grade Shakespeare Teas

**notdallin** (8.4): I recently gave this song a 10 in the Taylor Swift ranking and it is in a way. It‚Äôs vintage Taylor Swift and has basically become iconic at this point even though the use of Romeo and Juliet as a foil for star-crossed love is nothing new. The lyrics are those laughably typical of a high school girl where everything ends with a wedding and how talking to her dad made everything cool ([Magic! tried that 6 years later‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt go so well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIh2xe4jnpk)) but there‚Äôs something special in the naivety of young Taylor. She was still the girl who was ending the song with the white dress instead of the dress that was bought to be taken off.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): bb just say YAS

**Brandon6099** (8): MARRY ME JULIET YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO BE ALONE, classic taylor swift song <3

**Roxieloxie** (8): its cute but it's no you belong with me

**unovachamp** (8): Ugh yes queen make the children appreciate literature

**radiofan15** (7.5): I guess it kinda invented Shakespeare

**enecks** (7): A lyrically incoherent bop.

**letsallpoo** (7): why isnt you belong with me here. why can the swifites on this subreddit do NOTHING right

**hikkaru** (6): here's my scorching hot take: this song is meaty ogre and the only thing going for it is the key change - good enough for me to give it like an 8 in the original rate but alongside tougher competition I can't go that high

**ReallyCreative** (6): Romeo and Juliet is so overdone, this is an ok take but like still, read some different Shakespeare y'all

**wtferrothorn** (6): Oh gosh, this was a flashback

**camerinian** (5.5): ok I get that this is a sweet fantasy love take and it's very well-delivered, but I've got these two friends who essentially started dating over their mutual love of Taylor and it's very sweet and they're both lovely but holy shit am I goddamn sick of hearing this song every time I'm at their house

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5): ok when i first heard this song as a kid i absolutely despised it. My feelings aren't quite as strong now, but I still am not a fan honestly.

**RVA\_101** (4.2): God knows I can't remember the verses for jack

**selegend** (4): i dont get how the sub loves this but not the far superior teen bop come clean by hilary duff

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): i don't like this song

**kappyko** (3.5): I give into and accept so many weak love stories in weak pop songs that it's a shame I really feel so unconvinced about this one being romantic at all. The chorus melodies are okay, but isn't "You Belong With Me" just this but better? This song feels functionally useless.

**xxrandooxx** (1.2): What did juliet ever do to you?

Cosmic Love came in fourth in the 2010 Indie-Pop Debuts rate with an 8.893 average. I was surprised this song made it as far as it did, but I‚Äôm very glad it did because it‚Äôs one of Florence‚Äôs best vocal performances that I‚Äôve heard, and deserving of any and all acclaim it gets. It honestly gives Dog Days a run for its money imo.

---

**\_wailordfan** (10): a beautiful song

**animefangrant62** (10): I discovered this in an AMV for Madoka Magica and it blew me away.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): i want florence welch to curbstomp me

**Chevsapher** (10): That harp is magical.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THE STAAAAAAAARS! THE MOOOOOOON! MY WIG HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT!!!!!!!

**enecks** (10): MY WIG IS IN THE COSMOS

**ggodisawomann** (10): one of Florence's biggest slays imo

**lilacsweetener** (10): I can only listen to this occasionally because it emotionally overwhelms me too much

**plastichaxan** (10): There really is no other like Florence this is easily in my top 5 (or 10) of her songs.

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is my favorite Flo song. It‚Äôs killing me not to give it my 11, but I had other causes to serve. But seriously, this song is perfect. It‚Äôs immaculately produced, performed to perfection, and written for the sole purpose of thrilling.

**vhqv1997** (10): When are we gonna rate Florence's other albums guys because the celestial order will never be balanced until she has won a rate

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Classic Florence at her finest.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): A classic Flo song, the instrumentation and production are just so perfect for the song's lyrics.

**wtferrothorn** (9.5): that harp <3 her voice <3 that song structure <3<3<3

**1998tweety** (9.4): The guitar on this is such a nice small touch, I love epic songs like this.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): I do not appreciate Florence enough as a musician. That needs to change

**hikkaru** (9): the harp? a wig snatcher

**Roxieloxie** (9): i feel like i'm swimming through the milkyway

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song sounds like a Steven Universe finale

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): i am so god damn close to becoming a full time florence and the machine stan

**notdallin** (8.7): I miss harp Florence so much

**camerinian** (7.5): I personally prefer my Florence a bit heavier, either musically or lyrically, than what this provides, but those pounding drums over the hook really are something else

**kappyko** (7.5): *Lungs* is a high-flying show of grandeur. It's a song for movie theaters to play at full blast, advertising a grand blockbuster. Perhaps befitting an arthouse film where some elven children discover the meaning of love? Asteroids come crumbling down in drum beats and sunlight is filtered into pretty harps. She's got the pipes.

**xxrandooxx** (7.3): Cosmic brownies found dead

**radiofan15** (6.5): This is not Dog Days Are Over!

**Arybeck67** (6): okay hear me out, this is my least favorite Florence song even tho I‚Äôm a huge stan of them. It‚Äôs my opinion so please don‚Äôt @ me

**frogaranaman** (6): Love this STRFKR tribute!

**J\_Toe** (6): sadly Florence, like Lana, is one of those artists I just don't know how to like. Her sound just doesn't 'click' with me.

**RVA\_101** (5.2): Loud and abrasive and then suddenly quiet and brooding. But then I suppose that's Welch's idea of what cosmic love feels like.

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.5): need to learn how to enunciate. sounds like a 1 yr old trying to talk

Circus came in fourth in the 2008 Super Mega Ultimate Deluxe rate with a 9.002 average. Someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm almost positive that this is the first popheads rate that Britney has been in that she didn‚Äôt make top 10 in. Circus is a strong upbeat bop, but honestly imo it doesn‚Äôt really compare to a lot of the other day 3 anthems.

---

**gannade** (10): This goes off everytime I go on the treadmill

**hikkaru** (10): where the FUCK is gimme more and/or break the ice??????????????????

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song and Womanizer hold a soft spot in my heart because it‚Äôs when I started listening to pop music. Anyway this song still bops.

**J\_Toe** (10): i can't hear people making "two types of people in the world" statements without thinking of Ms Spears :)

**radiofan15** (10): Such a heavenly prechorus and catchy song overall, the Princess SNAPPED as usual

**ReallyCreative** (10): One of the most CRIMINALLY underrated Britney bops, this song beats out Toxic for me, and it right up there with Oops! and One More Time.

**twat\_brained** (10): There's only two types of people in the world: people who like this song‚Ä¶ and r/music subscribers. For a title track that went top 5 on the Hot 100, I find this to be one of Britney's more underrated singles. I say that as it went #4 in the 2008 rate, and I'm sure it'll be near the sharp end of the results for the Billboard 2009 Year End Rate as well. For real, though, post-Blackoutney songs have a lot of untapped potential which I encourage many a pop fanatic to seek out for themselves, starting with this song.

**1998tweety** (9.6): One of my fav Britney songs, this song is such a huge bop. And its pretty easy to sing to. It's hard for Godney to do wrong.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Is it perfect? No. Is it insanely catchy and danceable? Definitely.

**ryjomom** (9.5): There are only 2 types of people in the world: the ones that BOP and the ones that are WRONG

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): one of the last times britney sounded truly alive

**1313Harbor** (9): The pre-chorus and chorus are just next level Britney for me

**ExtraEater** (9): undeniable chorus

**RVA\_101** (9): Frenetic, anxious energy in F#minor

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.9): look at britney bringing us music as god intended it

**nooodisaster** (8.5): If this wins I'm sabotaging. Like she's GOOD. But there are at minimum 20 better songs in this rate.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): late 00s britney remains undefeated

**notdallin** (8.3): underrated wonky ghost synth noises in the final chorus

**Arybeck67** (8): solid song from our dear Godney

**ggodisawomann** (8): this is good Britney

**lilacsweetener** (8): underrated and underappreciated peak britney in her post-prime era

**rotating3Dtext** (8): i live for that whip crack

**wtferrothorn** (8): It commands, demands, and deserves everybody's attention. The presence is unparalleled.

**tapdancingpig** (7.6): I feel like I have to be meaner to some of my favorites this time around.

**xxrandooxx** (7.5): Still better than an actual circus with torchered animals and drunken clowns with hepatitis

**kappyko** (7): Sure kicks "Funhouse"'s ass, that's for sure.

**Roxieloxie** (7): britney who are we serving?

**camerinian** (6.5): This isn't a bad song but honestly this whole era of Britney is kind of overrated don't @ me

**\_wailordfan** (6): it‚Äôs like Toxic, but not as good, and with worse production.

**frogaranaman** (6): This song sounds like it‚Äôs trying too hard to hoe it out. I still bop, though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I‚Äôm sorry, drag me now but I‚Äôve never liked this song and I probably never will

**bbfan132** (5.5): this is way more boring than i remembered it being :/

**enecks** (3): This is a clusterfuck. Britney sold her soul and quality so she could be relevant post-Blackout.

The Fear came in third in the British Sophomore rate with a 9.222 average. Honestly, I‚Äôm still a little shellshocked that it made day 3, because I didn‚Äôt even notice that it made day 3 until yesterday. That being said, Lily Allen does a great job on this track as she usually does, even if it just isn‚Äôt one of my favorites in the rate due to some all time personal favorites being included.

---
**ExtraEater** (10): i admire this song's atmosphere

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented woke pop

**itsabop** (10): A powerful statement about consumerism and capitalism. "Life's about film stars and less about mothers" indeed. Also a bop tho

**J\_Toe** (10): revolutionised pop music in the late 2000s along with Beyonce and Gaga (just check the song's wikipedia page!)

**nooodisaster** (10): Honestly people aren't going to rate this as highly as they should, and I'm at peace with that.

**notdallin** (10): the snide, subversive indictment of pop culture in 2009 felt like an *fucking fantastic* prophecy as the world teetered on the edge of poptimism at the turn of the decade; each and every line brimming with sarcasm, dripping with disdain. As we stand on the other side of the decade, latest iPhones in hand, worshipping skinny queens, consuming clickbait, and yassing the clothes and fuckloads of diamonds, do we see the irony? Do we see what Lily Allen is saying? Are we unknowingly being taken over by the fear? Or are we aware of our part in the perpetuation, claiming that well, I'm not a saint, but I'm not a sinner and everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner

**radiofan15** (10): Gorgeous pop classic... 'I look at The Sun and I look at The Mirror' is one of the most clever lyrics i've heard in a long time... it's a shame that this was Lily's peak

**ReallyCreative** (10): Packing plastic does make your life fucking fantastic

**strawberryswing1** (10): why isn't this Fuck You? This is really good though.

**unovachamp** (10): Remember when Lily Allen literally invented meaningful lyricsism

**1998tweety** (9.3): Lily's vocals aren't a highlight but I really like the lyrics and the production.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): her lyricism

**camerinian** (9): I haven't listened to this song since it was big, so I assumed it would sound kitschy and kind of dated like her first album kind of does, but holy shit this slaps wow

**Chevsapher** (9): The chorus is a bit anticlimactic, but the lyrics are riveting.

**enecks** (9): This is like a better British version of Lady Gaga's fame deconstruction songs

**selegend** (9): unfortunate that she hasnt released a new album since INMIY

**twat\_brained** (9): queen of shading subpar UK publications. I love the cheeky cynicism on this song. Alright, Still was a hard act to follow, but she almost singlehandedly managed to do it with this song

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): This song will be robbed. I can taste it. But it aww deserves the world.

**kappyko** (8): Somewhat disillusioned by the anti-celebrity sentiments that feel condescending but I can still love it. The production has the quirkiness that characterizes Allen around this era. The sudden rush of synths in the dreamy chorus remind me of Sonic Heroes.

**wtferrothorn** (7.5): damn is this a well-written song

**RVA\_101** (7.1): As necessary a song for modern times, it's still not as good an anti-consumerism rant as 'Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)'.

**Arybeck67** (7): curse away my girl, curse away

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): why does this instrumental sound like a smash bros song sped down

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): god i love garageband

**frogaranaman** (5): This deserves a more bombastic chorus.

**lilguavachan** (4): i don't know why i can never really mesh with lily allen or her music. this is no different.

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.8): too melodramatic

**ryjomom** (2.6): It‚Äôs more like The Ear because that was a‚Ä¶ song

Delicate came in third in the 2017 Ultimate rate with an 8.361 average. Delicate essentially redefined the entire Reputation era post-LWYMMD, RFI, and End Game, making it from one that was scorned to one that may be beloved down the road, especially thanks to the tour. Fun fact: this was actually top 3 for a very long time, until some low scores near the latter half of voting brought it down.

---
**piccprincess** (11): something something ts7 is coming something something

**1998tweety** (10): The calm before the storm that is LWYMMD. After getting all of her angst out, Taylor takes a moment to talk about the vulnerabilities expressed in her relationship. This song fits perfectly into the album, it feels like a Taylor Swift song but it also has a place in reputation, the production being what sets it apart from previous albums.

**animefangrant62** (10): I used to think this was on the lower end of reputation but something about it has really grown on me recently. A mega bop.

**Arybeck67** (10): It‚Äôs SWIFTIE TIME! This song is pop perfection and NO ONE can tell me other wise. 123 LETS GO BEECH

**frogaranaman** (10): Fuck all y‚Äôall that disagree, this song slaps hard. [4]

**HerculesMeow** (10): My second favorite song off of Reputation, after Getaway Car

**hikkaru** (10): I absolutely adore the progression of this song. The vocoder intro without instrumentals sets the mood perfectly, and I love the fact that the drums don't kick in until the second verse which gives the song as a whole a real swell - not to mention the amazing bridge (all hail bridge queen Taylor) that leads into a great final chorus. This is some of Max Martin's finest production, with the vocoder and electropop synths complimenting each other incredibly well to create the exact vibe the song and lyrics are going for. So happy this became a pretty big hit (top 25 on the 2018 year end chart!) and ended the reputation era on a high note.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of the very, very few good songs on Reputation

**J\_Toe** (10): it's this kind of introspection that deserves the album title reputation, mores than songs like LWYMMD

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm curious as to how many times we're gonna see "isn't it" on this song. isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it

**ManofOranges** (10): Isn't it?

**radiofan15** (10): ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT

**ryjomom** (10): DIVE BAR ON THE EAST SIDE WHERE YOU AT

**selegend** (10): i hope taylor wins this rate if any of the noughties‚Äô rate songs don‚Äôt

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£

**twat\_brained** (10): When I see a Max Martin song I (dance)floor it. In all seriousness, this is the clear best song on reputation, and I was disappointed for it not to hit top 10 on the Hot 100. It's a joy to listen to when it comes on the radio, and just boosts my mood when it comes on. And the video makes me happy to see Taylor being her quirky self. I just love it. isn't it

**vhqv1997** (10): Was this song submitted to this rate just so everyone can have the chance to spam "isn't it" another thousand times as if it weren't already super lame the first time around?

**nooodisaster** (9.9): You know a song is good when radio overplay just makes you like it more. The lyrics would still be better if it was "This IS for the best" so yeah, gotta deduct some points for that. / I S N T I T ? /

**camerinian** (9.5): I remember doing the 2017 rate and hearing this for the first time, and it felt like a revelation that maybe the reputation era wasn't all for nought. I mean, it was still fucking embarrassing through and through, but at least something good came from it

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.4): dynamic, fun, catchy

**Brandon6099** (9): isn't it isn't it

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I love that Taylor tried something different with this song on the album. It‚Äôs refreshing compared to a lot of the more dated things in the album now.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9): isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?

**notdallin** (8.9): the debate for whether reputation was a good project still runs rampant in the popheads community, but ‚ÄúDelicate‚Äù is one thing we can all agree on. If nothing else, the rep era gave us this slice of pop perfection from a past country starlet that seems more like a fever dream in 2019. Delicate bounces gently as Taylor‚Äôs lyrics bob lightly on top of the beat and you wonder how the lyric ‚Äúdive bar on the East Side, where you at‚Äù can sound so masterfully smooth

**Chevsapher** (8.5): I wish the songwriting was more polished, but the production is satisfying and the melodies are fabulous.

**itsabop** (8.5): GP slept on this

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): A lovely little song.

**Roxieloxie** (8.3): when i said modern taylor swift has never contributed a good song to the music industry i was not talking about this song

**enecks** (8): Type isn't it in your rate comment if you think Reputation was a mistake but this is great. Isn't it.

**lilacsweetener** (8): the bridge doesn't get much attention so i'm here to say the bridge is literal magic and combined with the video choreography has made me weep a few times...

**ReallyCreative** (8): She gets points for something very different than usual, and it's pretty pleasant, but it's not as much of a game changer as this sub has led me to believe

**swadadu** (7.6): Isn't it false to assume that the guy being with her despite her bad reputation means that he truly likes her? I mean he still gets exposure which is good since he‚Äôs an actor.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Probably the best song on reputation but that's not saying much

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): reputation is still a dumpster fire of an album but delicate and ready for it are listenable

**ggodisawomann** (6): this is not her best sorry swifties

**wtferrothorn** (5.5): Decent song Tay, but if I have to hear you say the word "reputation" again imma snap

**kappyko** (4): Once a 5, then a 10, then... I like this song but it takes too long to like it. Vocoders sound pretty but the climax is never quite the show it wants to be.

**xxrandooxx** (4): This isn't the worst on the album, that's all the credit it gets.

**RVA\_101** (3.2): I miss the old Taylor, country guitar Taylor, never lies on the web Taylor, always disguised to hide Taylor.

**gannade** (3): this is so overplayed and i am sick of it

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.2): holy WOW has overplay totally killed this for me. generic drivel.

Countdown came in third in the 2011 Ultimate rate with a 9.100 average. This is one of Beyonce‚Äôs biggest, wildest, most entertaining songs imo, and it deserved to not only be a way bigger hit, but to go higher in this rate because WOW this is so catchy I‚Äôm actually kind of shocked it didn‚Äôt push top 5.

---
**StrawberryQueenAsh** (11): ok this is easily the most exciting and entertaining Beyonce song I‚Äôve heard in a rate before why is this not one of her bigger hits

**1998tweety** (10): This is THAT song. Huge bop and was majorly robbed. One of Bey's best songs no contest. The different song structure threw me off at first but now I really like it.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): HOW was this song not more popular. Shit this might be her best, the instrumentation is amazing.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): boOoOoOooOoOooyYYYYYY

**ggodisawomann** (10): one of Yonce's best

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I can‚Äôt believe y‚Äôall let this song flop when it came out. It is one of Beyonc√©‚Äôs best and should have not charted as low 71 on the Hot 100.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Beyonce's best song not on Lemonade

**J\_Toe** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GohpyK5Y3g

**kappyko** (10): Bey's coolest song deserves its second chance. It's an assault on the senses with marching band horns and pointillist synths, the most hype in a hook ever created, and drum fills that kick ass. Snap, snap, snap all the way to **[INSERT PLACEMENT HERE]**, baby!

**ManofOranges** (10): A timeless masterpiece

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i don't know why beyonce sings that first line so weird like is she drunk or high will we ever know

**nooodisaster** (10): TASTE SQUAD. From the second the horns kick in Beyonc√© is at once her most aggressive, while also her most domestic. gun photo She SAID her baby is a 10!

**Roxieloxie** (10): i'm giving this my (10)

**wtferrothorn** (10): Manages to do literally everything in 3 1/2 minutes and make it work perfectly.

**notdallin** (9.4): cringey Jay-Z gratifying aside, the bubbly production of this song alone is enough to rocket it to classic pop status. Add a colourful and iconic music video that becomes even more iconic with a snuggie parody and you have a song of biblical importance

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): How this song flopped I'll never understand, it's such a fun sexy bop, it's a top 10 Beyonce song for me, probably top 5

**Chevsapher** (9): This is a little bit messy, but very fun. The actual countdown bit is a highlight for me.

**enecks** (9): An out of control sugar rush of a song, this has raw energy to make me forget it's way too goofy to be a sex song.

**ExtraEater** (9): 'grIiInd'

**LuckyKidA** (9): this is where Beyonce earned her keep, nothing she did before this should have given her "icon" status

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): wtf i love math now

**vhqv1997** (9): This song makes me feel like I just did cocaine, even though I've never actually done it so I'm not even sure what that would feel like. This song just goes so hard and it almost never stops, just hooks after hooks after hooks. I don't even know why this is the first time I've heard it, even though this has to be one of her best songs.

**tapdancingpig** (8.8): I think I heard this song forever ago? Anyway the chorus is pure euphoria.

**itsabop** (8.5): Queen of clocks

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I always found this a bit overly herky-jerky and it feels like Beyonc√© is doing more than the most, which I suppose I should expect from her, but yeah, I've never loved this song. It's great, don't get me wrong, but a bit overrated.

**selegend** (8): make me feel so lucky

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://xkcd.com/1159/

**Arybeck67** (7): not a fan of Beyonc√© (plz don‚Äôt kill me)

**frogaranaman** (7): This is as much math Beyonc√© knows how to do.

**moooo566** (7): ive never watched the video for this song before and its making my head hurt

**xxrandooxx** (5.8): This song had me all over the place with parts i loved and parts i hated

**ryjomom** (4.9): Countdown to this being eliminated

**RVA\_101** (4.7): Would much prefer to have voted on 'Party' off that same album instead, but we're not voting on that are we

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.5): i love it all except for the actual countdown-sounded like a demon who lost their will to go on

**radiofan15** (4.5): Nice beat but this song goes nowhere

**hikkaru** (4): The production is so messy

**camerinian** (3): This is actually really annoying. Like, I totally got down with Love On Top, so I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve got a high tolerance for Beyonce, but this is just so much all at once from every angle.

Dancing On My Own came in fifth in the Charity rate with an 8.282 average, making it the first song in this rate to improve its score from it‚Äôs previous rate. It‚Äôs basically a near perfect song and a quintessential gay anthem, and actually held the lead early on in the results collection! It‚Äôs not the best song here imo, but it feels very popheads-core and I was expecting a little bit higher in the end.

**1313Harbor** (11): perfect in all ways

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): No joke, the first time I heard this song I'm pretty sure I actually cried. I was just coming to terms with my sexuality and (unfortunately) had fallen into the trap of crushing on a straight friend (aka recipe for disaster). I think this is the perfect song for learning to get over someone who shows no interest in you and will likely never show any interest. There's no resolution, no real pay-off, no happy ending, it's just the reality that not everything happens so smoothly in life and sometimes you have to just keep on going. That's okay, it's not the end of the world. And while it may not always be the case for everyone, it was a nice awakening for myself. Also it helps that it's just a fucking fantastic song on its own and easily deserves the 11 regardless of background.

**Chevsapher** (11): Beautiful yet heartbreaking lyrics juxtaposed with a jubillant interplay of disco-style synthesizers.

**nooodisaster** (11): THIS IS HISTORY. THIS IS PERFECTION. This is sorrow, ecstasy, denial, processing, loneliness, and triumph, all wrapped up in one. This is Robyn at her most powerful and you WILL respect her.

**tapdancingpig** (11): I still think this is the ideal song. The best and production are pitch perfect, the lyrics are wonderfully sad, and the hooks stick. But most importantly, the song uses its medium as a sad dance pop song to the fullest. You feel like you are in a club, dancing and moping.

**1998tweety** (10): A gorgeous incredible song, this song evokes so many different feelings perfectly. A classic for sure.

**camerinian** (10): its ok

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): calum scott's cover can choke but he can choke me tbh

**enecks** (10): Stone cold modern classic.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FUCK CALUM SCOTT!!!!!!

**kappyko** (10): Robyn's "Dancing on My Own" is the greatest claim of Sweden to the electropop pop throne, with all due apologies to the Knife. Never before has a break-up song sounded so desperate, with Robyn's pleas feeling genuine and the disco beat being both forward thinking and evocative of the environment that she wants to escape in. The vacuum of despair and hopelessness is slowly opened up as Robyn provides beautiful chorus vocals over this rubbery house beat. Suddenly, the song climaxes as the weight of the song crumbles upon itself into tears and electro drums. The most interesting juxtaposition between hope and hopelessness in a pop song ever.

**letsallpoo** (10): shut up naps

**ManofOranges** (10): I throw around the word classic too much but this song is actually a classic. Robyn was onto something when she made a melancholy that you can dance to when will your fave ever.

**notdallin** (10): I can‚Äôt be the only one who thought that the lyric was ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM IN THE CAR NOW, WATCHING YOU KISS HER, OHHHH-OH-OHHH‚Äù as if she was some sort of lonely omnipresent serial killer????

**plastichaxan** (10): Robyn can do no wrong and I should've known since I discovered her through this song.

**radiofan15** (10): One of the few great things r/Popheads introduced me to was this song, so thank you I guess

**ReallyCreative** (10): literally invented the concept of loneliness, when will your fave

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): hannah diamond found dead

**twat\_brained** (10): When people talk about how Swedish pop is the best pop out there, this is a brilliant example of why. On a deeper level, I feel this very personally; I don't have friends in town who I can just call up and chill out or hit up a club with at a moment's notice. I just show up, dance not necessarily on my own, but also engaging those around me, before I just take public transit or an Uber back home, and just like that I'm gone. I like the illusion I get from having people around who enjoy me, but that's as far as my social life really goes. I'm glad to have a song that personifies me, so thank you, Robyn. üíû

**unovachamp** (10): I thank Robyn every day for gay synthpop

**wtferrothorn** (10): This is what crying in the club truly sounds like, though I do prefer the album version over the radio edit

**Arybeck67** (9): I‚ÄôLL KEEP DANCING ON MY OWWWWWN

**frogaranaman** (9): This is a classic. [5]

**vhqv1997** (9): Is there any bigger injustice in the world than the fact that the Calum Scott version is way more popular but also way inferior?

**Roxieloxie** (8): if she was in the corner dancing by herself, how did he not notice her at all?

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): ok hot take but this song is pretty generic except that it's a song that's upbeat with depressing lyrics before it was cool to do that

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): bop

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.6): catchy

**J\_Toe** (7): I hope I don't get my r/popheads membership redacted for saying this, but I neither care for Robyn nor hate Callum Scott.

**strawberryswing1** (7): Y'all have overrated this way too much. It's nice, but it's missing something.

**\_wailordfan** (6.5): this is a strange case of a song where I prefer slow acoustic covers way better than the original. A ballad version of this conveys the feelings directly, and may lose a bit of the charm, but this song needs to punch, not jive.

**hikkaru** (6.5): To all the sad gays out there, I'm sorry. This song is just uninteresting to me

**LuckyKidA** (6.5): for such an iconic song, this is really underwhelming

**Brendon-Urine** (5): The production on Robyn's songs is always fantastic but they still always fall flat for me. The chorus should be huge and epic but it's such a let down

**xxrandooxx** (5): absolutely nothing stood out to me

**ryjomom** (3.3): I don‚Äôt understand Pophead‚Äôs obsession with this song? I‚Äôm so sorry! ;-;

**selegend** (3): sounds super dated

**RVA\_101** (2.7): God forbid I get to a point where I'd want to slit my wrists, I hope the blade isn't as dull as this song.

**animefangrant62** (1): I just don‚Äôt understand what any of you see in this. It‚Äôs garbage.

You and I came in fourth in the 2011 Ultimate rate with an 8.794 average. While Gaga‚Äôs vocal talents were never truly hidden, this is one of the first major singles she released that put them on the forefront of the track, which makes it feel a lot like a retrospective incredibly important moment in her career going forward. Plus, it‚Äôs just a damn good song all around.

---
**1313Harbor** (10): i lub dis song

**Arybeck67** (10): It‚Äôs Godga so what other score would you expect

**camerinian** (10): it seems weird to praise a song's aesthetic, but I just love the kinda glitzy yet grungy feel of this song. There's basically nothing like it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented joanne

**gannade** (10): i play this everytime i go home and it makes me cry

**ImADudeDuh** (10): honestly, might be my fave gaga song next to paparazzi

**J\_Toe** (10): I really liked the Southern Gothic vibe of Tim Burton's Big Fish, and just when I was looking for me, Gaga dropped this. Perfect!

**kappyko** (10): Gaga fits the bill of arena rock god perfectly. I love ya.

**lilguavachan** (10): one of her best ballads, don't @ me

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre closer to 2020 than 2011

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is my absolutely favorite gaga song

**radiofan15** (10): Queen spanned... and Brian May too

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh this is really good

**ryjomom** (9.9): How Country Music Should Be Period However Comma See Me And The Girlies In Nebraska With My Dad, Nebraska, And Jesus Christ

**1998tweety** (9.5): Looking back, this was actually an amazing single choice to make the album look super diverse.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Perhaps Gaga's most epic love song, and still one of my favorites.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): i want her to peg me

**twat\_brained** (9.4): True Monsters remember when Gaga performed this on the Monster Ball Tour, before Born This Way was even conceptualized. Those are fun memories. The finished product is even better, don't get me wrong, but I always felt like it was missing something. Either that or it's a bit overrated by Monsters. I love it, but it's somewhere around the #20 range of Gaga's best songs

**frogaranaman** (9): Chaotic midwest energy from this song.

**itsabop** (9): One of Gaga's most underrated songs

**strawberryswing1** (9): yeehaw

**tapdancingpig** (9): I loved this song so much. It just reminds me of better times, even if I don‚Äôt love some of the production choices.

**vhqv1997** (9): The visual of Taylor Kinney aggressively making out with mermaid Gaga still turns me on

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The aesthetic is confusing, but the melodies keep it from falling apart.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Joanne: Origins

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin#As_food

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.5): catchy

**enecks** (7): I always found Gaga's Americana attempts to be shallow and lacking in depth. This is one of the better attempts, but that artificiality remains. That uncomfortable tension with attempting Americana in Gaga's music actually did work well in A Star Is Born in aiding the narrative though.

**RVA\_101** (6.2): Points ded√ºcted for √ºnnecessary √ºmlauts.

**wtferrothorn** (4): I really don't like how stiff the production is

**notdallin** (3): I guess there was precedence for *Joanne*‚Ä¶ I guess I can see why people were not stoked for a return-to-roots Gaga, this song is terrible

**LuckyKidA** (2): Shania Twain remains unbothered

Green Light came in fourth in the 2017 Alt-Pop rate with an 8.960 average. This is one of very few songs that I can vividly remember where and when I was when it came out. I was sitting on the bus coming home from school in junior year in the fourth to back row on the left, and I remember getting goosebumps and trying not to cry and scream that first time. It‚Äôs just so anthemic and perfect.

---
**enecks** (11): I saw this song on the tracklist and I knew I would have to give it my 11. This is the best pop song of the decade. It's a quiet storm building into a rainy rave. The bitterness of the relationship seeps through all - even though catharsis is offered, the structure of the song makes it temporary. Lorde is desperate and evocative enough of a performer to really make this material work, and add subtle power to it. This isn't just a song that's good, but instead a song that gets better throughout. Though traditional in structure, the production is clever enough to add an expansion of layers throughout. And oh my god that outro. This song is a transcendent masterpiece that will only grow through time. It is what pop can offer in dark times - offering an opportunity to sing along through pain, joy, fear, rage, or regret. It's a goosebump generator.

**swadadu** (11): Hearing this song live is the closest I've come to losing my virginity

**TragicKingdom1** (11): one of my favorite songs of all time

**1998tweety** (10): This song was a great lead single and opener to the album, I get that people say that its a weaker cut off the album but to me its one of my favourites. Some songs like The Louvre get boring near the end, but Green Light keeps its energy up and never lets go.

**Arybeck67** (10): didn‚Äôt truly get the POWER of this song till I saw it live. Let me just say, it changed my whole perspective on the song.

**Brandon6099** (10): I'M WAITING FOR IT, THAT GREEN LIGHT, I WANT IT, honestly one of my favorite songs off her sophomore album, people didn't really seem to like it that much but it's a fking boppp <333

**camerinian** (10): Was highly considering giving this my 11 purely for the experience of seeing this live. That last chorus drop is orgasm-worthy

**frogaranaman** (10): Fuck all y‚Äôall that disagree, this song slaps hard. [2]

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lorde is a fucking icon fuck /u/napsandnetflix

**lilacsweetener** (10): underrated because idiots heard a fast beat and assumed she sold out...smh

**ManofOranges** (10): Lorde snapped we love a girl who references 1920s literature.

**radiofan15** (10): I'll never forget the first time I listened to this classic... the beat switch literally made gasp out loud and the first chorus turn me into u/wonderbitch26... ugh what an experience

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): lorde really loves her teeth huh

**twat\_brained** (10): When I hear those three piano chords coupled with "I do my makeup in someone else's car", the music just yanks me right in. And it doesn't let me go until Lorde yells "I want it" for the final time. One of my top five songs of 2017 that I'd love to see make it to day 3.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): ugh the escapism

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): we love gay representation, a queen who knows that gays cant drive

**Chevsapher** (9.5): As a single, this song was lackluster. As a piece of music, it's exceptional. Lorde makes cliche themes seem refreshingly interesting through her choice of words, and the chorus is undeniably catchy. The house-style piano is a highlight of the production.

**vhqv1997** (9.5): I'M WAITING FOR IT THAT GREEN LIGHT I WANT IT I'M WAITING FOR IT THAT GREEN LIGHT I WANT IT I'M WAITING FOR IT THAT GREEN LIGHT I WANT IT I'M WAITING FOR IT THAT GREEN LIGHT I WANT IT

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Slaps

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): enormous bop

**wtferrothorn** (9): Fun in spite

**xxrandooxx** (8.7): Great Gatsby, Stoplights, Alien beams‚Ä¶ Lorde really did create all these things!

**notdallin** (8.6): remember when everyone heard that piano snippet in the Green Light teaser Lorde released in early 2017 and we were all weirded out joking that she was going to release an album of piano ballads? And then she kind DID??

**kappyko** (8.5): House pianos seal the deal for best dance-pop Lorde's made. Awkward transitions and screechiness mark down the song a bit.

**J\_Toe** (8): not my favourite from Melodrama but I'm happy to see it here (also, had to check if this was somehow the Beyonce song)

**nooodisaster** (8): Voting this in ruined Lorde's chances for winning bc its gonna split the stans 11, and it's still only like the 6th best song on Melodrama so like wtf guys. Yet.... I'm a slut for Lorde.

**strawberryswing1** (8): Why the fuck was this voted in ahead of Bon Appetit. I love Lorde but this is the worst song off Melodrama.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGY4NPpkFSA

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I really like this song, but... it‚Äôs not the best song from the album by a long shot.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (7): The song does feel a little disjointed at parts, but overall it's a good listen

**ryjomom** (6.9): More like a Yellow/Red Light cause this shit fire.

**RVA\_101** (6.4): I'm not beholden to this New Zealand native as some popheads are. But I'll appreciate a good track when I hear it.

**selegend** (6): not top 5 melodrama but it‚Äôs still good

Viva La Vida came in fifth in the Grammy SOTY rate with an 8.643 average. This is probably one of the most epic sounding songs I‚Äôve ever heard, it makes me want to hop on a horse and ride into a warzone screaming battle cries. Everything about this is basically perfect, but, alas, it‚Äôs a song performed by a male vocalist, so it never had a chance at top 5.

**CactusWithinUs** (11): One of the most cinematic pop songs I've ever heard, only propelled by Chris Martin's gorgeous vocals and the elegant strings. I adore this track immensely, and it's probably up there with some of my all-time favourites

**frogaranaman** (11): Fuck all y‚Äôall that disagree, this song slaps hard.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): One of my favourite Coldplay songs. I love the story telling and perspective of this song; it‚Äôs really unique.The production and instrumentals is fantastic too with all the strings, chimes and choirs, and this has allowed the song not to age a day at all. It‚Äôs one of the few songs that I loved the first time I heard it, and I still listen to a lot even to this day. It was hard to choose my 11 but I decided to support my boys since popheads probably won‚Äôt.

**1998tweety** (10): This song feels like a cinematical masterpiece.

**camerinian** (10): this song made 11 year old me quiver, this is the straightest and whitest of bops but bop it does nonetheless

**Chevsapher** (10): I still don't understand what this song means, but I like the lyrics regardless. The lush, ultra-melodic production is incredible.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): those strings

**enecks** (10): A grandiose masterpiece that defies words.

**hikkaru** (10): so iconic whew

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my alarm clock in middle school played this song so it's so fucking iconic.

**kappyko** (10): Theatrically overproduced art pop that wallows in its grandiosity, slowly closing in on itself with atmospherics that best U2. Chris Martin is wistful in a way that I haven't heard done better from him on any other song bar maybe "Strawberry Swing". Perhaps the most uncontested-ly gorgeous song to become a hit this century so far.

**ManofOranges** (10): Ever since I've heard this song I've stanned. I've had such a hard time trying to figure out what it's supposed to mean but that's part of what makes it so intriguing to me on top of the fact that the instrumentals like the bells and stuff are just so good. What a classic.

**notdallin** (10): it‚Äôs unimaginable now to think that Coldplay or even pop music used to sound like this 10 years ago but honestly it was pretty foreign-sounding on pop stations in 2008 as well. Viva La Vida, the song and the album, flourished with poptimists, hipsters, and moms everywhere because of its timeless, analog, and upbeat sound with intriguing imagery; lyric analysts and music critics argue about the meanings even now. ‚ÄúViva La Vida‚Äù ebbs and flows with armies of strings, exploding in swells especially as the song closes, mimicking the bygone lullaby of its narrator.

**radiofan15** (10): I still prefer Violet Hill from this same album but even I can't deny how fucking huge is this song not only in chart success but also in composition and sound

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): This is one of those songs that I refer to when people say coldplay are generic and formulaic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): they really be snapping sometimes oh oh ooo hh oohhh ohhhh ohhhhohoho o woowowo ohhowo owowowo ohowoowoww oowo wooo h owowow ow owowhohwo

**twat\_brained** (10): Chris has a point; from a historical standpoint, being the king of a landing sounds incredibly daunting and undesirable. Hell, there are revolutionaries in Venezuela waiting for the President's head on a silver plate. Never has a history lesson sounded so poignant and overpowering.

**vhqv1997** (10): This is not my favorite Coldplay song, hell, I don't even consider it the best song on its album, but it is arguably their most iconic one. Every time I hear the violins at the beginning I immediately know what song it is, and it always gives me this very cinematic, epic feeling. It is geniusly composed, so divergent from their usual works, but also so uniquely Coldplay's that it's difficult not to consider it a musical triumph.

**xxrandooxx** (10): You give me instrumentals like this and it's gonna be a 10 (11 would have gone to fallen kingdom by tryhardninja tbh)

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.5): Middle School Dance‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and fuck me UP VOCALS

**Arybeck67** (9): The Song of my childhood that my mother would always run to on the treadmill, it‚Äôs literally ingrained into my brain lol

**Brandon6099** (9): classic bopp

**ggodisawomann** (9): taste

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The original YOLO, change my mind

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): A great song but not my favorite from Coldplay.

**ryjomom** (8.5): MINECRAFT GAY ANTHEM

**RVA\_101** (8.2): Little did Chris Martin know that it was all downhill from here. Mylo Xyloto fans withhold comment.

**J\_Toe** (8): i got excited thinking i could play this song on piano, but then I remembered that's clocks

**Roxieloxie** (8): u/strawberryswinging

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): it was so overused over the years...

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): Maybe milquetoast white men aren't completely worthless

**selegend** (6): pretty

**gannade** (5): men LOST

**nooodisaster** (5): Lol, I remember when I thought Coldplay was Real MusicTM.

**plastichaxan** (0): I wanted to give my first zero (this is my second rate) and this truly couldn't be more perfect for that.

Not Ready to Make Nice came in sixth in the Grammy SOTY rate with an 8.398 average, making it the second (and final?) song to get a higher average here than its previous rate. Believe it or not, I had never heard this song before the rate, but I ended up giving it my 11 over one of three of my all-time favorite songs (Perfect Places, Edge of Glory, Rainbow). It‚Äôs probably my favorite country song ever, the pure emotion seeps through the song and it‚Äôs so powerfully delivered, and just such an important message. You don‚Äôt need to apologize if you did nothing wrong. You can speak up on what matters to you, no matter what anyone thinks. You don‚Äôt need to forgive someone who did you wrong, and you are justified in your emotion to them.

---
**mylps9** (11): The Dixie chicks took on the president of the US, George Bush, And their career suffered for it. This iconic song explains Natalie‚Äôs frustration towards the American citizens and media in amazing unapologetic fashion.

**Arybeck67** (10): damn this song is eerily relevant in our modern day times. Just fantastic.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): After the 'controversial Bush statement' (which was just idiotic from the public end, I'd recommend reading up on it if you've got time and want to get pissed at something) this was the perfect response. You can just feel the amount of anger and frustration coming out of this song, even without knowing the past events. If one of my favourites of all time wasn't in this rate it'd be an easy 11.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ended GWB

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Republit*rds OWNED with FACTS and LOGIC and COUNTRY BOPS

**kappyko** (10): Poignant country from an act that ought to have their dues paid to them ever since poptimism kicked in after *1989* dropped. The Fantano-RateYourMusic-/r/indieheads complex of middle class guys is still struggling to realize that Kylie Minogue is respectable, how the hell are we supposed to convince those guys that many mainstream country artists have meant something to so many people and are considered pretty highly by critics worth a damn past Internet cred? "Not Ready to Make Nice" is a fantastic indictment of the conservative media that was so ready to instantly drop them into the flames of hatred. It's braver, if nothing else, than any acclaimed indie record this decade. And probably more passionate, too.

**lilguavachan** (10): drag those disgusting and ugly conservative white men, queens

**ManofOranges** (10): I'd never heard of this song until this rate and when I did hear it, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Every single thing the song did just made it better and better and the way it builds up to that line of "shut up and sing or my life will be over" is amazing. I also had no idea that this song was about the Dixie Chicks' controversy but like I didn't even need to know this song stands so well on its own. It can speak volumes no matter how you think about it. Flawless song.

**nooodisaster** (10): The bridge of this will forever be on of the most powerful ever put to song.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Everything about this song is amazing, from the story behind it, to the song itself, and the fucking middle part of this song just YES DIXIE CHICKS, we will always stan

**selegend** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**twat\_brained** (10): I actually felt somewhat emotional listening to that; I thought I'd forgotten how that feels!

**1998tweety** (9.5): country queens

**itsabop** (9.5): Slayed President Bush

**Chevsapher** (9): This song is inspiring me to make a country playlist...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I can only imagine the fury Dixie Chicks would‚Äôve demonstrated on this administration

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): a yeehaw women power anthem

**camerinian** (8.5): I think I appreciate this song more than I actually like it, but any ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the conservative set who disingenuously say they don't like politics in music as code for never challenging anything is a-ok by me

**ggodisawomann** (8.5): does this mean I've been sleeping on the Dixie Chicks...holy shit

**hikkaru** (8.5): liberal queens

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): We stan vocal queens who don‚Äôt pander to their fan base.

**notdallin** (8.4): the lushest, most anthemic country you‚Äôll ever have the pleasure of hearing

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): those strings won me over

**enecks** (8): Can I get a "Fuck country radio" in the replies to this rate placement?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): ok so do i care about country? no. do i care about country pop? no. do i care about the dixie chicks? hell nah. but does this song absolutely slap? it sure does.

**RVA\_101** (7.8): Knowing the backstory behind the song makes it that much more enjoyable

**frogaranaman** (7): Yeehaw.

**wtferrothorn** (7): The yeehaw bad bitch energy emanating from this song is powerful

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.8): pleasantly surprised

**lilacsweetener** (6): I used to love this but it doesn't resonate with me anymore...maybe because it's not as revolutionary now to see a celebrity torn apart due to political mob mentality...

Perfect Places came in second in the 2017 Alt-Pop rate with a 9.128 average, posting an iconic shocking loss to Los Ageless. This is another of my favorite songs ever, my favorite Melodrama song, and my second favorite Lorde song. It just feels like it encapsulates everything I love about Lorde. Considering the sub‚Äôs love for her, I‚Äôm a bit surprised she didn‚Äôt wind up in the top 3, but the competition was so steep and 11‚Äôs were split with Green Light, so I guess it‚Äôs not too shocking.

---
**Brandon6099** (11): WHAT THE FUCK ARE PERFECT PLACES, iconic CH-CH sound, I had to give this an 11, I loved Melodrama so much and this is definitely the best song on it for me tbh, the perfect ending to an amazing album <3

**Brendon-Urine** (11): When I heard her sing this live my soul felt true happiness.

**camerinian** (11): This is quickly joining the ranks of my favourite songs of all time. It‚Äôs incredible how many levels this song works on both as a single and as an album closer. The chorus is triumphant, the verses are evocative, and the outro is the perfect piece of closure, brilliantly providing that feeling of contentment and finding joy in what you have and those that love you. This song feels like the equivalent of a long, warm hug. Everything is great, we‚Äôre all here, let‚Äôs have a good fucking night.

**hikkaru** (11): Now that there's less Melodrama songs for Lorde stans to spread their 11s across, maybe this can win!

**itsabop** (11): Takes me to a happy place, a perfect place

**static\_int\_husp** (11): What the fuck are perfect places? I don't know but this song could count as one of them. This song captures the chaos and unkown of young adult life so well, while still feeling oddly calming.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): The fuck are Perfect Places anyway?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the real perfect places are the scores we gave along the way

**enecks** (10): Yeah this is amazing. Lorde is best operating in bittersweet emotions, and this acceptance of life as imperfect but beautiful allows her to express them evocatively.

**frogaranaman** (10): chk chk

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song has HEAVILY grown on me, I love

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song should have been the big song from Melodrama but sadly life doesn‚Äôt work the way we want it to

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lorde is a fucking icon fuck /u/gannade

**J\_Toe** (10): she really delivered a perfect closing lyric for her sophomore album!

**lilacsweetener** (10): chk chk

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is perfect. It's definitely one of Lorde's more pop-oriented songs but like everything about is so appealing. The ch-ch gets me everytime.

**nooodisaster** (10): "Are you lost enough?" This is how you do it!! This shoulda been number 1 for 17 weeks. When this single first dropped I finally thought Lorde had dropped a smash, and in the context of the album it's even better. At first brush, it seems like this is a simple party anthem for jilted millenials. But at the end of Melodrama, it becomes much more bittersweet. After we've seen the journey of Lorde's breakup and lonliness, lines like "Now I can't stand to be alone" hit like a fucking truck. The world is on fire, she's lost the love of my life, and alcohol can only create an illusionary escape. Let's give into it. Fav line: "I hate the headlines and the weather/I'm 19 and I'm on fire"

**radiofan15** (10): https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6rf0ns/fresh_video_lorde_perfect_places/dl4jdgx/

**ReallyCreative** (10): The best song from Melodrama, and my would be second choice for an 11

**Roxieloxie** (10): CH CH

**ryjomom** (10): ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM 19 AND I‚ÄôM ON FIRE‚Äù - Me (screaming as I night drive with this blasting my car stereo)

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): chk chk

**strawberryswing1** (10): I would die for Lorde

**tapdancingpig** (10): Perfect is right. This is pure euphoria with enough of a twinge of darkness to really stick out. This is the perfect rolling credits song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPcNAJ6txjA

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): should have been a smash hit but this country's justice system is trash

**twat\_brained** (10): The "ch ch" is Lorde loading the gun that she'll blow her brains out with, right? And the beginning of the chorus the radio? It has to be, right? I don't know what the fuck perfect places are, but I know one is at a Lorde festival set, screaming these lyrics back to her.

**1998tweety** (9.7): I was in love with this song when I first listened to it, but some of that shine has worn off since then. Really this song just needed to repeat its pre-chorus since thats my favourite part of the song.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Oh crap, am I a Lorde fan now?

**wtferrothorn** (9.5): the perfect closer for Melodrama

**ariannagrandtitties** (9): this song sends me to perfect places

**Arybeck67** (9): I‚Äôm a teen so this song really hits me hard because honestly I just see everyone around me desperately trying to find a perfect place away from the stress, whether that be some pretty bad vices. It‚Äôs a great song cause it‚Äôs blatantly true.

**vhqv1997** (9): Why didn't she sing the pre-chorus the second time, that would make this song fucking perfect but she didn't so I'm not gonna give it a perfect score

**notdallin** (8.7): Melodrama‚Äôs take on ‚ÄúTeam‚Äù which has always been my favourite Lorde song. And as great as Team is, she takes the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs all chant the chorus together‚Äù bit and amplifies it to 11 so that u/wonderbitch26‚Äôs bussy resonates every time someone streams it

**xxrandooxx** (8.2): amen lordt

**RVA\_101** (7.8): Two from the same album? Whoopty doo!

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): this works worse outside of the context of the album for me, which is unfortunate, but I really need the preceding songs to make this a powerful song.

**kappyko** (4): I don't care for it, it's like Pure Heroine which I liked initially but I eventually realized it was Pure Heroine but fart-ier and uglier. I don't feel adolescent urge, I feel tinnitus. "Supercut" is a superior closer. Somebody take the fucking pianos away from her. And the hoovers away from Jack. "What the fuck are perfect places?" is not as profound as it wants to be.

**animefangrant62** (3): I liked this when it came out but man it has gotten so much worse over time. I actively dislike listening to it now.

Dog Days Are Over came in second in the 2010s Indie-Pop debuts rate. This was a far and away favorite to win said rate, and I had this as one of my favorites to win here too, but here we are. This is the highest song to be voted in, and rightfully so, because it‚Äôs probably one of the best breakout singles I‚Äôve heard. It‚Äôs so huge and epic in sound and style and vocals and everything. 

---
**HerculesMeow** (11): Can you hear the horses? 'Cause here they come BITCH

**ReallyCreative** (11): perfection, this song literally could not be improved in any way, it is absolutely amazing

**vhqv1997** (11): You will never know true happiness and divinity until you listen to Flo belt out the final chorus to a crowd of a thousand people all simultaneously jumping up and down to the song and screaming their Lungs‚Ñ¢ out to the goddess on stage.

**1998tweety** (10): A classic, the pre-chorus into the chorus gets me so hyped.

**\_wailordfan** (10): another beautiful song, and almost stole my 11 from Taylor.

**Arybeck67** (10): a bop, plain and simple, and what got me girl the exposure she deserved.

**Brandon6099** (10): THE DOG DAYS ARE OVER, THE DOG DAYS ARE DONE

**Chevsapher** (10): This is amazing. I don't even know what to say.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): run fast 4 my wig

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the song that made me fall in love with Florence‚Äôs voice when I first heard it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ahhhhhhhhhhhh my fucking WIG she did THAT

**kappyko** (10): This song is clearly a happy song, y'all know that, right? It's the pop soul distillation of Florence's aspirations on her debut record, but it's damn fine as hell. She's captured the feelings of sudden happiness so vividly: terrifying in power, sublime in effect. Good terror, really, something that inspires in handclaps and arena-ready eccentricities. I love the second verse, the head voice that she uses over the woozy guitars. Then the storm comes in and takes over, letting go only briefly before whipping into a hurricane of baroque sound once more.

**nooodisaster** (10): That 2-1 clap is a classic, but stil NEVER fails. The lyrics are nonsensical but hit perfectly, creating a joyous, delirious state of ecstasy that birthed my stan-dom for life.

**radiofan15** (10): The Glee version outsold, but this still bops hard

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I have really good memories from school strongly assoicated with this song, so I feel real good whenever I hear it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song sounds like taking a final thinking you‚Äôre gonna fucking fail but then getting the test back and you see you got a goddamn A

**twat\_brained** (10): It's Florence at the top of her game! How could anyone not like this? The fact that it was released in 2008 makes it even better for me.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): This was my introduction to Florence and little did I know the level of quality I was getting into I've stanned since.

**enecks** (9): Slightly overplayed but FLORENCE + THE MACHINE YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**notdallin** (9): ‚ÄúHappiness hit her, like a train on a track‚Äù honestly same

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): üó£ DOG DAYS ARE OVER

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): i have become a full time florence and the machine stan

**wtferrothorn** (8.5): not as amazing as cosmic love but it's a powerful bop no doubt

**camerinian** (8): While I will totally lose my shit when this comes on, there really are a lot better Florence songs out there that tap in to her actual emotive range with a lot more catharsis. This is still fun as heck though

**frogaranaman** (8): They aren‚Äôt because dogs still slay but I think this song is cute.

**ryjomom** (7.6): see Life of Pets 2 in theaters coming soon

**tapdancingpig** (7): I like this song, but... Flo has so many better ones and this is the one radios decided to stan?

**xxrandooxx** (6.6): Cats are in!

**RVA\_101** (5.8): Very popheads-vogue to include two F+tM songs in an 'All-Stars' list. Almost like if there were two Taylor Swift songs in one list. Oh wait.

**lilacsweetener** (2): Just never came around to this one

**1313Harbor** (0): I don't think I've ever given a 0 in a rate before, but I really really dislike this song. Sorry, Florence fans

Countdown came in third in the 2011 Ultimate rate with a 9.100 average. This is one of Beyonce‚Äôs biggest, wildest, most entertaining songs imo, and it deserved to not only be a way bigger hit, but to go higher in this rate because WOW this is so catchy I‚Äôm actually kind of shocked it didn‚Äôt push top 5.

***

StrawberryQueenAsh (11): ok this is easily the most exciting and entertaining Beyonce song I‚Äôve heard in a rate before why is this not one of her bigger hits

1998tweety (11): This is THAT song. Huge bop and was majorly robbed. One of Bey's best songs no contest. The different song structure threw me off at first but now I really like it.

Brendon-Urine (11): HOW was this song not more popular. Shit this might be her best, the instrumentation is amazing.

cloudbustingmp3 (11): boOoOoOooOoOooyYYYYYY

ggodisawomann (11): one of Yonce's best

ignitethephoenix (11): I can‚Äôt believe y‚Äôall let this song flop when it came out. It is one of Beyonc√©‚Äôs best and should have not charted as low 71 on the Hot 100.

ImADudeDuh (11): Beyonce's best song not on Lemonade

J_Toe (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GohpyK5Y3g

kappyko (11): Bey's coolest song deserves its second chance. It's an assault on the senses with marching band horns and pointillist synths, the most hype in a hook ever created, and drum fills that kick ass. Snap, snap, snap all the way to [INSERT PLACEMENT HERE], baby!

ManofOranges (11): A timeless masterpiece

MirandaCrocsgrove (11): i don't know why beyonce sings that first line so weird like is she drunk or high will we ever know

nooodisaster (11): TASTE SQUAD. From the second the horns kick in Beyonc√© is at once her most aggressive, while also her most domestic. gun photo She SAID her baby is a 10!

Roxieloxie (11): i'm giving this my (10)

wtferrothorn (11): Manages to do literally everything in 3 1/2 minutes and make it work perfectly.

notdallin (11): cringey Jay-Z gratifying aside, the bubbly production of this song alone is enough to rocket it to classic pop status. Add a colourful and iconic music video that becomes even more iconic with a snuggie parody and you have a song of biblical importance

ReallyCreative (11): How this song flopped I'll never understand, it's such a fun sexy bop, it's a top 10 Beyonce song for me, probably top 5

Chevsapher (11): This is a little bit messy, but very fun. The actual countdown bit is a highlight for me.

enecks (11): An out of control sugar rush of a song, this has raw energy to make me forget it's way too goofy to be a sex song.

ExtraEater (11): 'grIiInd'

LuckyKidA (11): this is where Beyonce earned her keep, nothing she did before this should have given her "icon" status

thenshecamelikeaaah (11): wtf i love math now

vhqv1997 (11): This song makes me feel like I just did cocaine, even though I've never actually done it so I'm not even sure what that would feel like. This song just goes so hard and it almost never stops, just hooks after hooks after hooks. I don't even know why this is the first time I've heard it, even though this has to be one of her best songs.

tapdancingpig (11): I think I heard this song forever ago? Anyway the chorus is pure euphoria.

itsabop (11): Queen of clocks

twat_brained (11): I always found this a bit overly herky-jerky and it feels like Beyonc√© is doing more than the most, which I suppose I should expect from her, but yeah, I've never loved this song. It's great, don't get me wrong, but a bit overrated.

selegend (11): make me feel so lucky

ThatParanoidPenguin (11): https://xkcd.com/1159/

Arybeck67 (11): not a fan of Beyonc√© (plz don‚Äôt kill me)

frogaranaman (11): This is as much math Beyonc√© knows how to do.

moooo566 (11): ive never watched the video for this song before and its making my head hurt

xxrandooxx (11): This song had me all over the place with parts i loved and parts i hated

ryjomom (11): Countdown to this being eliminated

RVA_101 (11): Would much prefer to have voted on 'Party' off that same album instead, but we're not voting on that are we

ariannagrandtitties (11): i love it all except for the actual countdown-sounded like a demon who lost their will to go on

radiofan15 (11): Nice beat but this song goes nowhere

hikkaru (11): The production is so messy

camerinian (11): This is actually really annoying. Like, I totally got down with Love On Top, so I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve got a high tolerance for Beyonce, but this is just so much all at once from every angle.

enecks: Kacey Musgraves' Same Trailer Different Park came out in 2013, and is probably the actual most influential album for the 2010's wave of women in country. It did that not by watering down the genre or trying to woo pop radio, but by being more daringly inclusive within the existing country conventions. 

And make no mistake - in between Alice Wallace, Pistol Annies, Lori McKenna, Brandi Carlile, Courtney Marie Andrews, and Caitlyn Smith - there's enough talented women in country the past few years that I don't need to endorse any random pop crossover. Country has so much more to offer than just the Nashville to pop radio pipeline.

Dreams came in second in the All-Time classics rate with a 9.403 average. Is there anything I can really say about Dreams that hasn‚Äôt been said? It‚Äôs Dreams. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to make it this far in a popheads rate that always values bops over slower songs, but here we are. It‚Äôs a super pretty song.

---
**ExtraEater** (11): best ever

**kappyko** (11): "Dreams" is something personal to me. It means three-day long D.C. trips with friends that felt real. It means awkward coming outs. It means over-stimulation of Batman movies playing on bus speakers and insomnia as my friends lied down beside me slumped asleep. It means seeing snow for the first time in my life, a beautiful shade of blueish white in the early, early morning to the same song on loop. It means shitty YouTube downloads of songs that mattered to me in middle school all set in one playlist I would play to death. It means that sometimes the greatest music never dies or loses its magic. It means woozy soft rock and poptimism and living life to the slow groove of guitar solos and Stevie Nicks vocal witchcraft. It means the constant fear of adulthood that I've been driving myself mad. The fear of losing my memories of what I've had with these people that mean my entire life. A song that constantly loops in my subconscious in pretentious writing and overblown reflection. Whatever. I do wish I could escape from the trappings of responsibility.

**letsallpoo** (11): PLEASE

**LuckyKidA** (11): Man this is BoRiNG where are the BangeRz. How can I bop my bussy to this?

**ryjomom** (11): SHE IS... THE SONG THAT I NEVER HAD. SHE IS‚Ä¶ THE SONG THAT EVERYBODY WOULD WANT. SHE IS THE SONG THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES. I DON‚ÄôT KNOW A BETTER SONG‚Ä¶ I DON‚ÄôT KNOW A BETTER SONG.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): I‚Äôm sure this won‚Äôt win but honestly as someone who rolls his eyes at most classic rock I‚Äôve always had this insane affinity for this track. It‚Äôs just the goddamn percussion, it‚Äôs some of the most emotionally charged percussion I‚Äôve heard on a rock song in my life. /u/frogaranaman and I have had discussions about this track with very differing opinions and I see why it may be bland to many, but this song kicks my ass. It speaks a language that seems so far away from mine, but when the crash comes in the chorus, it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm omniscient. Everything makes sense and everything sucks forever but I understand, I just fucking understand.

**1998tweety** (10): This is way better than The Chain lmao. This song feels very nostalgic for some reason.

**Arybeck67** (10): We stan a scientifically incorrect masterpiece

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): inb4 a million comments about that one iconic tweet

**ggodisawomann** (10): Stevie Nicks did that

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is so soothing yet catchy. Fleetwood Mac totally aced having a dream like quality to this song, and Stevie carries it so well.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Bop

**itsabop** (10): Classic

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember watching the rate this was in and hoping and praying that the Chain and lo and behold it did and I guess I was too busy celebrating that the chain won to really appreciate how good of a song this is. Wig.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): https://twitter.com/emiiluzz/status/1079414923216732165?s=21

**radiofan15** (10): An eternal BOP

**RVA\_101** (10): Fallen in love with Lindsey Buckingham's reverb-echo laden guitar and John McVie's steady pulsating bass. And the 10 is without even considering the Gold Dust Woman's enchanting vocals.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song is so soothing. Even though I gave The Chain my 11 last year, this song probably should have won it's first rate.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): This song was probably the first song I heard that I knew was made well before I was born that managed to prove to me that old music isn't necessarily too old for me to enjoy. It's a timeless, beautiful song.

**strawberryswing1** (10): One of the greatest songs ever.

**Chevsapher** (9.8): I'm not a rock fan, but Fleetwood Mac is always an exception.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): i mean come on

**camerinian** (9): I really like how there‚Äôs this sort of underlying tension in the song between the harmonies and the instrumentals, it‚Äôs really where the whole backstory of the album comes through clearest

**enecks** (9): Heck yeah

**wtferrothorn** (9): that chorus is an absolute stunner

**xxrandooxx** (9): this witch bitch out here making thunder only happen when it rains smh

**notdallin** (8.9): just imagine how awkward the room must have felt when they were all recording this

**twat\_brained** (8): It's great, and I definitely see the appeal, but there's a reason this didn't win its rate and "The Chain" did. As pleasant sounding as it is, it doesn't have that sensational tempo change "The Chain" does. I appreciate it nonetheless, but not enough to give it a full 10. Sorry to any and all Fleetwood fans.

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): wow sick what a feeling reference

**nooodisaster** (6): good advice.

**hikkaru** (4): the "all stars" rate, otherwise known as the "hikk gives really popular and probably objectively good songs made before 2000 an offensively low score" rate

And here we are, your All Stars 2 winner! The Edge of Glory is, by all metrics, a perfect pop song imo. It came in second in the 2011 Ultimate Rate with a 9.345 average. Gaga has so many classic singles that this isn‚Äôt even her signature song, but if any other artists released this goddamn masterpiece, it most certainly would be their signature song. The production, the lyrics, the delivery, everything is 10/10. Even if these results were messy as all hell and there were a few songs I would‚Äôve rather seen win, this is a deserving winner.

---
**therokinrolla** (11): Bad Romance is easily her most iconic and invented song, but EOG can easily be considered her best. Unlike the rest of BTW, which is a beautiful cacauphony of Electronica and unruly synths, EOG feels perfected. It's emotional, it's strong, and it has one of rhe most iconic hooks of all time. A 5 minute track with a 1 minute trumpet solo hit #3 on the BB100? Hell yeah. Its frankly gorgeous and one of my fav songs of all time.

**Arybeck67** (10): When Lady Gaga was the only modern artist your parents let you listen to when you were a kid, you develop a soft spot for her.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Just pure, fun pop.

**Brandon6099** (10): I'M ON THE EDGE OF GLORYYYYY, one of the songs that I first heard by Gaga before I started getting into pop music and I absolutely loved it

**camerinian** (10): Springsteen rate when

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): run away with me found DEAD

**enecks** (10): Yeah this is a classic.

**ExtraEater** (10): sax at the end

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Easily a top 3 Gaga song of all time. Anyone who disagrees can fight me.

**kappyko** (10): Gaga takes a note from "Moments in Love" to bring us club excellence. Her voice is front and center on this grand arrangement, and this era (despite my discontent with several songs) is a testament to how weird pop can really get. "The Edge of Glory" flies off the edge and becomes sublime in anthemic arena rock synths, bass rumbles, and beautiful sax. Isn't it weird how the indie kids are so damn prejudiced against caring about people like Gaga or Beyonce circa 2011 when they were making more inspired music than any damn boring indie record that year? This is "Midnight City" without the whoops or fear of itself becoming too pop.

**lilacsweetener** (10): descending from super bowl ceiling I'M ON THE EDGE!!!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): This is like one of Lady Gaga's best songs, if not her best. Other songs of hers like from the Fame era are catchy and all but this song really is on another level.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a highlight of my 2011, no doubt

**nooodisaster** (10): Carry me off to the sunset, ra ra bitch.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song is inspiring to me, one of Gaga's best.

**radiofan15** (10): Gaga's best album closer, don't @ me

**ryjomom** (10): I‚Äôm not longer on antidepressants. Thanks Edge of Glory! From the maker of Bad Romance, Lady Gaga! Side effects may include gay, homos having panic attacks, and hearing loss.

**strawberryswing1** (10): I fucking love when songs have horns in them

**tapdancingpig** (10): UGH This is one of my very favorite Gaga songs. It goes on a little too long, but... I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just too euphoric.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): legendary

**twat\_brained** (10): The best song on Born This Way and roughly Lady Gaga's 4th or 5th best song she's ever put out. Clarence Clemons deserves to fly high for his superb contributions to this musical masterpiece.

**vhqv1997** (10): I can't believe Lady Gaga invented this instrument called the "saxophone" for this song! Ugh, her mind!

**1998tweety** (9.7): Queen arrived, the sax solo on this is killer and makes it the perfect ending to the album.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.6): IM ON THE EDGE

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The mixing is muddy, but the song itself is ridiculously addictive.

**frogaranaman** (9): Isn‚Äôt this a masturbation anthem?

**ggodisawomann** (9): mid-tier Gaga but it still deserves this score, impressive

**wtferrothorn** (9): what a journey of a song

**Roxieloxie** (8.9): this song transported me into a skate rink

**notdallin** (8.4): such an anthemic song for marching into the dark and unknown. TAKE ME BACK TO THE TIME WHEN SAXOPHONE SOLOS WERE COMMON IN POP MUSIC

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): It's not even close to my favorite Gaga song, not even on my top 5 from Born this Way, but it's pretty fun and exciting.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge

**xxrandooxx** (6.8): Not my favorite gaga song ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**RVA\_101** (4.4): More commercially successful than 'You and I', and as the theorem of popularity foretold, it's not as good.

**selegend** (2): this is so noisy
