All Stars 2 Rate, Day 2: DAE only like white music???
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/arb3l5/all_stars_2_rate_day_2_dae_only_like_white_music/

Good afternoon everyone!

Today is the second day of All Stars 2! Today is also the 5th day a rate I've hosted has ever revealed, and the 1st reveal of those 5 I'll actually be hosting the plug and sub reveal! Took me long enough to finally get my life together I guess.

Some fast facts:

1. I had 93 participants!
1. The average score was 7.6374
1. The average controversy score was 2.2162, which means anything above this should be considered controversial!

[Here is the plug link!](https://plug.dj/popheads) We will be getting started promptly at 2 pm EST (just a little over an hour from now).

We will be revealing songs #39 - 16 today! I slimmed down my shitposts list to just the best, so it'll hopefully go a little faster than last night.

Thanks for coming! Have fun!

U-turn came in 4th in the Queer Synthpop rate with an 8.735 average, and is the final song out from said rate. Honestly, I never listened to this song before doing this rate, but this is a massive bop. Can we have synth pop be trendy and relevant and have all major artists doing it again? Please? Pretty please?

**gannade** (10): lesbians made a point

**kappyko** (10): I want to be launched into space someday. Wouldn't that be neat? Everything is awesome.

**lilguavachan** (10): lesbian queens

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is what carly rae jepson would sound like if she was trying to get the wlw audience

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Total bop material, love the pre-chorus in particular, it's fantastic and fun and the lyrics are strong too

**ryjomom** (9.5): I thought U-turns were illegal in my state

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): a simple bop

**Arybeck67** (8.6): first Tegan and Sara Song I’ve heard and I like it

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The 80s-style production is a lot of fun!

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): I was not expecting this to be such a bop

**1998tweety** (8.4): Bop

**enecks** (8): I'm just going to review the Usher track I found instead. This bumps.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Almost there.

**notdallin** (7.3): u-turn rhymed with “you’ve earned” is a great line.

**hikkaru** (7): Boyfriend outbopped

**twat\_brained** (6.6): this video is laughably cheap and the song, albeit catchy, doesn't do a whole lot for me. As a Canadian I feel I should give these girls more credit but let's be real, they're never gonna reach the highs of "Closer" again.

**camerinian** (6.5): I never really got the hype around Tegan and Sara. This is fine I guess

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): Gets less interesting as it goes on, but I can't be mad at it!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): a 6

Flesh without Blood came in second in the Real(iTi) Art Pop rate with a 9.246 average, and is the final song out from said rate. I think I can kind of see the appeal of Grimes, but her whole style and aesthetic just feels a bit too weird and offputting for me to get as invested in this song as I would like to be.

---
**xxrandooxx** (11): My slavic faire pixie witch grimes sucked all the blood from my flesh and made a song about it.

**1313Harbor** (10): The ultimate friendship break-up song

**animefangrant62** (10): Best Grimes song

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Kill V. Maim will always be my fav Grimes song but this one is SUPER close behind

**camerinian** (10): why is grimes making nu-metal now, what did we do to deserve this

**hikkaru** (10): witty comment about elon musk

**kappyko** (10): A fine addition to the pop canon from somebody that sincerely cares about pop being fun. Pop rock guitars are twisted around, bizarre sound effects add the right amount of quirk, enunciation makes Grimes into a badass pop star. I believe you!

**twat\_brained** (10): oooooooh aaaaaah ah I love this song but it's hard to imagine this as a Clairelon song. Is that their ship name? Well it doesn't matter because they weren't meant to be. Also have this shitpost https://twitter.com/fatandfem/status/994004946478620673

**ExtraEater** (9.5): takes me back to my first days on /r/popheads

**1998tweety** (9.3): Kill V. Maim deserved but this is still nice

**notdallin** (9.1): how grimes came off of her critically acclaimed 2012 album cycle and swung back onto the scene 3 years later with a complete aesthetic u-turn (but in hindsight, a natural evolution of her left-field electropop) will always astound me. She was already an indie darling with not a whole lot more to prove, but the first few notes we hear from her comeback are surprisingly analog, making a ballsy return that completely paid off. Art Angels’ first official single is at once immediate and vulnerable, carried by an unrelenting guitar line and words to mince from Ms. Boucher.

**nooodisaster** (9): I feel like Grimes is gonna get slaughtered bc we all hate Elon now but seriously, this song is everyone ARTPOP wished it could be.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.change.org/p/popheads-replace-the-whip-crack-in-johnny-test-with-the-whip-crack-at-0-14-in-flesh-without-blood?recruiter=931623917&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition

**ryjomom** (8.8): This song grew on me like Grimes’ nickel scent.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): Grimes is so creative; unfortunately, her vocals and lyrics often drive me the wrong way. Thankfully, that's not the case here. The chorus is definitely the highlight of the track.

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): This was a bop and a half

**ImADudeDuh** (8): luckily, one of the few good grimes songs

**Roxieloxie** (8): indie kitchen pokemon vibes, but it still works

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): need me a goth gf

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.2): halloween has come again

**ggodisawomann** (7): the album art is what I look like in the morning.

**Arybeck67** (6.7): uhh so offense, a little too weird for me oof

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): it's like a shot of cotton candy flavored vodka: disgustingly sweet but it's the venom within it that makes it worth it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): this is so overrated lmao

**selegend** (6): i saw this as a choice at a karaoke place and i was thinking how tf could i sing this. i wish i could understand what she says

**frogaranaman** (5): This sounds like cultural appropriation.

**RVA\_101** (4.7): 'Song without Staying Power'

**radiofan15** (4.2): Miss Musk really though she did something

**\_wailordfan** (2): I do NOT get Grimes. The appeal, the sound, etc.

**enecks** (1): Begone pedo

**lilguavachan** (1): oh god no

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Eh it’s okay but I’m just not a fan of Grimes’ voice at all. It ruins the song at points. I felt like I needed to give a 0 in this rate so this would be the song closest to a 0.

**J\_Toe** (0): I just don't like grimes. I like unions

Bachelorette came in fourth in the OG Art Pop rate with a 9.171 average, and is the second of three songs out from said rate. Bjork is another artist I can see the appeal of, but her voice just feels like it demands so much of my attention at any given moment that it almost feels offputting. It’s like a musical overdose to me, there’s too much for me to focus on at all times.

---
**plastichaxan** (11): Björk is just TOO GOOD, probably my favorite artist. Picking my eleven was a debate but after I listened to my top 4 of this rate like 10 times each I could decide and I'm happy with this.

**wtferrothorn** (11): A song that could soundtrack the destruction of a continent, a planet, or men as a whole. IN THIS HOUSE WE STAN BJORK

**\_wailordfan** (10): iconic. Did: that.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): It's Bjork, and even more it's Homogenic. Easy 10.

**camerinian** (10): i need to listen to more bjork holy shit.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of the greatest songs ever

**enecks** (10): The best Bond song because it grounds the strings-based intense vocals and grounds them with some crunch and a clever instrumental change.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): wgere is Jóga

**moooo566** (10): can i get a bjork IV into my veins

**nooodisaster** (10): Utter perfection of experimental pop. This is what it sounds like when the devil orgasms, except he's the standard red horned one not an orange president.

**radiofan15** (10): I love how cinematical is this song, and th

**selegend** (10): a masterpiece holy fuck

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This literally sounds like a sci-fi western in the best way possible

**1998tweety** (9.5): Usually I don't enjoy Bjork songs but this is nice.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Dark, lush, trippy, poetic... wow. Also, is that an accordian at the end?

**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): trying to picture a fountain of blood in the shape of a girl

**J\_Toe** (9): this song is so Bjork I'm surprised the title is a word I recognise

**vhqv1997** (9): I'm pretty sure this is the soundtrack to a Spanish soap opera

**hikkaru** (8.5): I really like the production on this, with the strings and the menacing piano and the harsh electronic synths. doesn't sound like it's over 20 years old at all

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): oh come on now I gotta start listening to Björk too?

**twat\_brained** (8.3): So, going from Florence to Bjork, I definitely sense the latter's influence towards the former. I really hope that's the case. I'm not sure how the music video relates to the song, though. I mean the whole tree branch lyrical subsection matched with the trees, that makes sense. The "my story" aspect? My best guess is that Bjork has lived her life as a woman without room in her life for romance, yet motherhood is still an important part of her life. I suppose. I appreciate the emotion she sings with; it wouldn't be a Bjork song otherwise.

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's weird but seems pretty tame for Bjork, love the instrumentation and the mood

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is my first time listening to Bjork and it’s... interesting. This song is very dramatic and feels like it should be part of a musical or something. Not sure how I feel about this song as a whole though.

**kappyko** (7.5): A lush arrangement outlined by trip hop beats, with crystalline instruments outlining one of the best vocal performances by Björk. Yes, I love "Joga"!

**1313Harbor** (7): I have bad taste so this song doesn't really do it for me

**Arybeck67** (7): leave it to Björk to give me an existential crisis whoop

**xxrandooxx** (6.4): Loved the instrumentals

**frogaranaman** (6): I’m not horny enough for this song.

**Roxieloxie** (6): This is alot to take in, and i dont want it

**ryjomom** (5.7): The instrumentals are everything; however Comma those lyrics and vocals...

**ariannagrandtitties** (4): reminds me of the theme tune to sherlock with bandersnatch curlycue

**RVA\_101** (3.8): Bjork is definitely an acquired taste. One of the strangest influential albums I've forced myself to listen through.

**strawberryswing1** (2.5): Bjork just isn't for me

**ggodisawomann** (2): I do not like Bjork's music at all, too weird for me, this is a miss

Coat of Many Colors came in second in the 1971 Women in Music rate with a 9.186 average. This is a really lyrically pretty song, and Dolly Parton slays on the vocals as always, but something just feels a teeny bit off in the delivery at some point that holds this down a little bit. That being said, I’m very pleasantly surprised that a country song from 1971 managed to make it even this far. Is there hope for popheads after all?

---
**Arybeck67** (10): beech when I first listened to this own the 70’s rate, I cried. It’s just beautiful ahh.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): yee... and I can't stress this enough... haw

**Chevsapher** (10): One of the best story songs I've ever heard. Great lyricism, expressive and tonally interesting vocals, spot-on melodies, and fitting production.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): dollysus part-the-red-sea-ton

**enecks** (10): A song about how human compassion and generosity is more valuable than materialism and hatred, this stands the test of time.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking country QUEEEN

**kappyko** (10): Crafted vividly, with care, and made with love. A sweet family intimacy yarn sung over warm country production that belongs anywhere between 1940 and 2019. Sewn together perfectly.

**lilguavachan** (10): if i don't give this a 10 as a tennessean, i think dolly would come over and literally snap my neck. and honestly? i'd let her.

**ReallyCreative** (10): An amazing song through and through, I don't care if you don't like country music, this song is gorgeous and sad and happy, I just fucking love it

**twat\_brained** (10): I'll listen to her The Voice performance. Impressively, she's doing it in the same key as she did in the '70s. Even more impressively, she sounds like she's never lost her touch! I also love how she's playing a guitar of many colors, to boot. This gets a 10 from me because it proves how timeless this song is that Dolly can just rock up on national television and perform it just as brilliantly as she did upon its release, four decades later. I'm gonna give COMC a listen after this rate.

**vhqv1997** (10): Holy fuck I miss my mom

**camerinian** (9.5): This song is fucking adorable omg

**1998tweety** (9.3): Dolly's ability to tell a story so well is definitely her strong point.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i cannot twerk to this

**notdallin** (9): the wholesome case for when one has mo money one may in fact expect mo problems

**plastichaxan** (9): Maybe I would've respected country sooner in my life if I had been shown country made by women.

**swadadu** (9): I don’t know why I’m crying in the stable right now

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/gucci-rainbow-cat-zip-front-hooded-jacket-prod211290033

**selegend** (8): dolly liberated the gays

**radiofan15** (7.8): Cute and embracing and warm... this is the kind of country I can get behind

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): don’t make me sad!!

**RVA\_101** (7.2): Not one of my favorite genres but Dolly Parton makes it a lot better

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Those who bullied Dolly went she was young are probably poor and broke now. I hope they got their karma

**jlim201** (7): Not really my 'thing' but once I looked up what it was supposed to do, it does that really, really well.

**frogaranaman** (6): Yeehaw. [2]

**wtferrothorn** (5.5): it's cute

**ariannagrandtitties** (5): come on dolly, u can do better than this

**hikkaru** (5): cute! but i'm like three years old so i'm not a huge fan

**nooodisaster** (5): "one is only poor only if they choose to be" has NOT aged well LMAO.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (4.5): look, I adore Dolly Parton as a person, but her music is just NOT my cup of tea

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): ????????????????????

**ggodisawomann** (4): the wavering in Dolly Parton's voice has driven me nuts since I was a kid, i can't. I can only do 9 to 5

**Roxieloxie** (4): she sounds like shes singing into a fan

**xxrandooxx** (4): is this a song about the ever growing diversity of America???

**ryjomom** (3.6): Cute story of the creation of the pride flag

Rainbow has been rated twice recently and performed best in the 2017 Ultimate where it scored fourth with an 8.356 average, however it was actually submitted from the Charity rate where it came in seventh with an 8.169. Rainbow is, hands down, one of my favorite songs of all time, it’s absolutely beautifully written, it’s raw, it’s genuine, and just hands down incredible. It helped get me through some of the lowest points in my life. I cannot believe how hard you all robbed this smh, the lack of taste jumped out u/kappyko please delete popheads now thanks

---
**lilguavachan** (11): this song feels like kesha walked into the room and is giving me the biggest hug.

**Arybeck67** (10): frick this song I relate to so much, like most of the album as well. The tears are free following on this track.

**Brandon6099** (10): I'VE FOUND A RAINBOOOOOW, Kesha's album is amazing and this song is definitely one of the best on it showing her growth <3

**Brendon-Urine** (10): The instrumentation is SOOOO GOOOOOOOD

**hikkaru** (10): This song is just so beautiful. Following Kesha through the years and seeing her unable to release music for years because she was standing up for herself was so disheartening, but when Rainbow finally came out I cried to this song the first time I heard it. The orchestral arrangement makes me so emotional every time I listen and I'm just SO FUCKING HAPPY FOR HER

**ManofOranges** (10): This is simply a beautiful song. I don't think more needs to be said.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I’m so glad this song was finally released. I wanted to hear it since Kesha’s interview with the New York Times years ago, and it’s just as wonderful as that interviewer said it was.

**Chevsapher** (9.8): I cried.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.8): i can’t believe this album is turning 2 this year

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Ugh still so powerful. This album was such a revelation and songs like this show it's going to age amazingly. Everything is overflowing with sincerity and hope and it just lifts my spirits while breaking my heart. "Just put those colors on girl/Come and paint the world with me tonight."

**twat\_brained** (9.5): I love this because while Kesha's life may still bring these large storms every now and again, she'll always have rainbows to look forward to. And this one feels like a rebirth of the Kesha we all grew to love when she first burst onto the scene. I have the utmost respect for this woman after listening to Rainbow, and I hope she continues to channel her inner peace into her music.

**1998tweety** (9.1): Highkey sounds like a Disney song, really cute and wholesome

**1313Harbor** (9): Such a beautiful song, but I'm bitter that she skipped it in her set in Seattle

**selegend** (9): ive seen kesha 2 feet away from me with my own two (2) eyes

**vhqv1997** (9): This really does sound like something a Disney Princess would sing and that definitely ain't a criticism

**\_wailordfan** (8): it’s cute, but I just don’t think Rainbow aged that great.

**notdallin** (7.8): it’s not everyday that an uplifting pop song is flourished with such beautiful orchestration. Every single instrument really embellishes the beautiful message.

**RVA\_101** (7.8): An artist abandoned commercially successful electro-dance pop, overcame abuse and intimidation from her producers and wrote something heartfelt of substance? Yes, and I'll have more of what she's serving.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): kacey outsold

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): i hope kesha is having a good day today

**wtferrothorn** (7.5): Sounds like the best-case scenario pop ballad sung by the lead in an animated movie

**camerinian** (7): I honestly don’t have a lot of tolerance to these sort of inspirational tracks, but the choral swell on this really is something to behold

**enecks** (7): Weird pick to represent this album - it's a little bit too artificial and Disney-esque to deliver the pathos that makes the album amazing.

**radiofan15** (5.9): This was... underwhelming... I understand the context and everything, but if you strip the song from it you're just left with a sappy boring song

**kappyko** (5.5): Broadway musical climax full of heart and wisdom. Side note: isn't it crazy that the album, considered her most personal, is the first to feature songs not written by her? Obviously, the context is important and it's still obviously personal, but it's just an interesting tidbit.

**saucymac** (5): idk its just boring? The lyrics are nice and meaningful, but I just can't get into it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This is an okay song but like there’s too much good shit here for this to compete

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.9): little boring instrumental-wise and kinda amateur-ish

**ggodisawomann** (4): this is eh Kesha for me and I really like her

**frogaranaman** (3): I get why people enjoy this song, but holy shit it’s so trite and shoddy to me.

**xxrandooxx** (2.8): I'll stick to “Praying” the gay away

**ryjomom** (1.4): i feel like this sounds like an indie girl trying to be deep

**gannade** (1): white woman stop appropriating gays challenge! this is a really bland inspirational anthem combined with an equally bland vocal

River came in fourth in the 1971 Women in Music rate with a 9.040 average, and is the last song out from said rate. I actually don’t think I had heard this before this rate, but wow it hit hard, this was sad and beautiful and I can’t believe it didn’t make the Christmas rate.

---
**Arybeck67** (10): y’all seriously want me to start sobbing during this rate, don’t ya? Well guess what? I am thank you very much

**J\_Toe** (10): I have to give Joni Mitchell a 10 because Blue is my favourite album of all time, even though I wish Carey or California was here in its place.

**radiofan15** (10): The second greatest Christmas song of all time behind All I Want For Christmas Is You

**vhqv1997** (10): I will never forgive this subreddit for chopping off the entirety of Blue except for this one song before the top 10

**Chevsapher** (9.8): I love pianos, I love good Christmas music, and I love Joni Mitchell.

**wtferrothorn** (9.5): omg how can something be this beautiful

**1313Harbor** (9): We should all play this song at Christmas instead of Jingle Bells

**camerinian** (9): How have I never heard this before??? Sad Xmas tunes are literally the only types of Xmas songs I can listen to all year round, and this is stunning wow

**kappyko** (9): I have no idea how the hell this song was so well received. Perhaps the "Jingle Bells"? I love Joni Mitchell, though, and this is part of one of my favorite discoveries of last year. I just pray it's not dead last.

**nooodisaster** (9): Honestly, smart by the rate hosts to include this one bc it's barely a Christmas song. The lyrics are gutwrenching, and her vocals... wonders. We're ALL crying. EDIT: SKSKSKSK I TRULY THOT THIS WAS FROM THE XMAS RATE!!

**ReallyCreative** (9): One of the best, most accurate Christmas songs regarding love, I love realism

**tapdancingpig** (9): This will get robbed, but it’s just too beautiful for me to let it die without throwing a fit.

**1998tweety** (8.7): This makes me really sad :pensive:

**itsabop** (8.5): Pretty lyrics and melody. I've only ever heard Big Yellow Taxi by her.

**enecks** (8): Forbidden fruit FUCK

**notdallin** (8): WHICH OF YOU FLOPS DIDN’T VOTE THIS INTO THE CHRISTMAS RATE LAST MONTH

**selegend** (8): kinda sounds like jingle bells but a classic nonetheless

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): jingle bells

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): good

**RVA\_101** (7.9): Impossible to listen to just one song without listening to the rest of the album. Such is the power of Blue.

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): this song sounds happy then it just kinda goes oh

**twat\_brained** (7.4): Ooh, I like the piano here. It reminds me of "New Year's Day" by Taylor Swift. It doesn't really go anywhere from there, unfortunately, which was kinda what I was hoping for. In fact, it feels somewhat sleep-inducing.

**ariannagrandtitties** (7): strike against for the pitchy high notes

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): it’s a nice song just not my cup of tea.

**xxrandooxx** (5.6): I live on a river... I fell into it a few times… It won't solve all your problems Joni

**swadadu** (5.5): He loved me so naughty

**ggodisawomann** (5): I love the piano in this song but the rest is just meh

**ryjomom** (4): not my cup of tea but i’ll dunk my mug in the river

**frogaranaman** (3): This sounds like a fourth grader wrote this.

Pyramids came in third in the Modern Classics of Hip-Hop rate with a 9.478 average. Am I going to complain about this song being too long? Yup. Maybe I just have a short attention span, but I really can’t stand it when songs are much longer than 6 minutes. There were a lot of good parts in the song, but there’s really no reason it couldn’t have been slimmed down or split into two at some point. It’s just too much for me.

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): please ban anyone who complains about the song being too long; they don't deserve this level of greatness

**unovachamp** (11): channel? oranged. pyramids? built. music? saved.

**Chevsapher** (10): What a rollercoaster! I thought Frank Ocean made R&B, so I never delved into his discography—a decision I now regret. The lyrics, the melodies, and the production are all complex and gripping. I am also impressed by the length; very few ten-minute tracks by anyone not named Donna Summer are worth the time it takes to listen to them.

**enecks** (10): An epic of sexuality, power, and music history. Also frank can make me cum oceans any day ;-3

**frogaranaman** (10): This is a classic.

**J\_Toe** (10): I know this isn't one of Frank's songs about same sex relationships, but the first half just sounds really drag-y to me, which I like.

**kappyko** (10): Prog R&B that precedes the art-y experimentalisms of *Blonde* yet slams harder than anything on it. Does better with 10 minutes than JT does with... well, take your pick. Narrative storytelling that is focused more than Frank's nostalgic muttering in recent years which I'm admittedly partial to. Dance-electro-pop groove into dreamy pop rock into beautiful hip hop. Swag holla. I find it hard to imagine somebody liking big budget pop music and not liking this. This is blockbuster stuff, man! If I can love this as an attention deficit 6th grader...

**radiofan15** (10): Ay ay ay ay Sad Vegeta on the loose

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song was soooo close to getting my 11. This is Frank Ocean’s masterpiece, a massive epic R&B track that feels like a journey. The high point of Channel Orange for many reasons, with the main one being that this was this the first sign of Frank’s dedication to iconic beat switches.

**twat\_brained** (10): okay this is epic. I'm not kidding, the runtime literally totals nearly 10 whole minutes. I love the synth breakdown after Frank's intro, it reminds me of "Break the Ice" in the BEST WAY. I also love the throwback disco sound Frankie's working with here. I'll admit, I'm not paying the most attention to the lyrics. Something about Cleopatra? I guess he's going for an Ancient Egypt theme with this song. Of course, this song is more than just its first part. Now that this second part is playing, I guess "Cleopatra" is a stripper, and her "pyramid" is a strip pole? In any case, not many people can pull off a 10-minute song. Frank Ocean can. For that he gets a 10 from me.

**wtferrothorn** (10): It feels as if the evolution that R&B went through for the past 30 years were meant to lead to this

**notdallin** (9.7): in what modern pop song can you find biblical and historical references settled so comfortably next to lyrics about pimps and prostitutes, motel blinds and VCRs, while weaving them together in a narrative with a triple (!!!) entendre about pyramids? A true contemporary pop epic.

**1998tweety** (9): For some reason this is giving me mild early Justin Timerblake vibes, I like it.

**camerinian** (9): I think this works better in the context of the album than on it's own, but it is still an incredible piece of narrative, and the first half is a straight fire tune

**ExtraEater** (9): things change

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): too long. good first half

**RVA\_101** (8.7): It's rare to find an example of when Frank Ocean is out of his element. It's not here either.

**hikkaru** (8.5): I haven't listened to a ton of Frank Ocean and I came in to this song expecting a 10 minute long sadboi snoozer, but wtf is this BOP? I still prefer songs I can throw on in a playlist and aren't centuries long, but this is really good

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I enjoy the first half of this song much more than the second half. Although, I have to say the pyramid shaped synth progressions in the first half almost make this a top-tier song by themselves.

**Brendon-Urine** (8): Goes a little long but that synth line is SO good

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Where is she working again? And what time of day?

**nooodisaster** (7): it's no Runaway but yea

**ManofOranges** (6.5): This song just went on waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long.

**\_wailordfan** (6): I took a point off for every minute too long this song was.

**ggodisawomann** (6): the first half of this song is a 7 and the second half is a 5, so I averaged the scores. first half is better, I enjoyed this actually

**napsandnetflix** (6): this was really good but then it went on for 7 more minutes

**Roxieloxie** (6): this needed to be two songs

**xxrandooxx** (4.3): 10 mins no thank you

**poppinmmolly** (4): docked points for length ALONE

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.9): frank’s really drowning in that ocean of his

**ryjomom** (3.7): Come to Egypt Frank Ocean !! ;) Egypt!!! Desert Brazil!

Power came in second in the Modern Classics of Hip-Hop rate with a 9.605 average. Funny how both songs from it go out right in a row, right? Anyways, I’ve never really gotten in on the Kanye hype. I can appreciate the big sound, and it’s definitely well written with a strong message, but something just has just always prevented me from getting into Kanye, especially as someone who never really experienced his music until his recent turns.

---
**RVA\_101** (11): Egotism is forgiven when you have the genius to back it up.

**camerinian** (10): This really is the culmination of all of Kanye's egotistical chest beating both before and since this song. The biggest sounding song he's ever made, and perhaps a semi-ironic sentiment then which is a way too sincere cry nowadays because fuck me it's hard being a Kanye fan

**enecks** (10): I've reckoned with Kanye. Long story short - everything after MBDTF has soured hard for me, but I respect a classic. And make no mistake - this is the best beat of Kanye's career. Maybe even the best beat of the 2010's. Prove me wrong.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): If you don’t have this on your workout playlist, did you even work out?

**notdallin** (10): every track off of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy feels mythological now. It’s like they always existed

**radiofan15** (10): Those who didn't pardoned Kanye for Taylor-gate after lsitening to this song are soulless abominations from the Obama Nation

**Roxieloxie** (10): i dont need your pussy bitch, im on my own dick

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I know Kanye's a little out there these days but you can't deny that this goes hard. The King Crimson sample is one of Kanye's best

**strawberryswing1** (10): "HOW YE DOIN? I'M SURVIVINNN'" I love the confidence in this part lol

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(TV_series)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): the icon jumped out

**vhqv1997** (10): Thank you Kanye, very cool

**wtferrothorn** (10): Kanye turning into an absolute nut job is worth it just for stuff like this tbh

**1313Harbor** (9.5): This song will be featured in media/sports for the rest of forever

**animefangrant62** (9): I listened to this so much on the radio in Saints Row 3.

**frogaranaman** (9): Y’all really gonna make me rate Kanye again, huh? [2]

**twat\_brained** (9): Kanye wasn't lying here, he was at the top of his game and was the most powerful man in hip hop at the time. The Obama's nation lyric is harsh to think about, though, knowing Kanye's political affiliations.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A mega bop; I already know some of y'all are gonna rate this lower cause Kanye is controversial.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): This track is punchy and flows well; the synths toward the end are my favorite part. If only the artist wasn't so controversial.

**kappyko** (8.5): Kanye West is the artist that a million nerds learned about the word "braggadocio" for. I simultaneously don't want this to get far and want it to get far. Either result is vindicating.

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): I had to listen to this song too many times while doing high school track it's alright tho

**ggodisawomann** (8): sample here is a win, I actually really liked this

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): i still think Black Skinhead is ironically a better power anthem but this one still bangs alright

**lilacsweetener** (7): Back when his videos used to elevate his artistry instead of further meme-ifying him

**tapdancingpig** (7): This would be an 8 if Kanye wasn’t a twat. It bops really hard.

**\_wailordfan** (6): -2 points for republican teas

**hikkaru** (6): the production nearing the end is nice but the rest? meh

**lilguavachan** (5): unfortunately i'm not one of those people who could remove the art from the artist. i did like this song when i liked kimberly's boy toy however

**nooodisaster** (5): I can't remember the last time I listened past the first minute of this song, which makes sense because it gets fucking tedious quick lmao.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): katy outsold

**ryjomom** (4): I like the instruments and the choir in the back.

Her voice is nice, her songs are nice, but nothing I’ve heard of hers has ever felt like *that* song to take her to a higher level, and Drew Barrymore is no exception to this for me. It’s nice while it lasts, but I almost completely forget it by the time it ends.

---
**ImADudeDuh** (11): SZA is an icon and deserves all the love in the world.

**1313Harbor** (10): As an eternally lonely girl, this song absolutely wrecks me in the best way

**camerinian** (10): This was the song that won me over completely on SZA. There's such a sexy groove to this track, and she just controls the groove and the overall vibe so fucking well.

**frogaranaman** (10): This is one of the best songs of 2017. [2]

**kappyko** (10): Underwater guitars line SZA's definitively singer/songwriter take on alternative R&B. It's soulful and warm and fuzzy and sensual. Sex can be so lonesome sometimes! SZA has trapped the labors of contemporary loving into one tune. Being a 20 something in 2019 seems weird from the distance I'm at, but I feel like SZA's music has resonated so much because it reflects the malaise and passions of this generation of young adults. Strings help, too.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): CTRL has honestly become one of my favorite albums ever and this song is just so good

**notdallin** (9.8): among the multitude of emotions and personas Ctrl presents, that of “Drew Barrymore” is the most affecting. We may not be writing a diss track to our boyfriend who’s dumped us for a supermodel or sharing our beau with another lady while we get him on the weekend, but somehow SZA’s vulnerability universally resonates when she croons to anyone who will listen, “am I warm enough for you?” When the answer is ultimately negative, it doesn’t matter who was in the wrong; we run through the spectrum of apologies of things we don’t need to apologize for, we wallow in our insecurity, and we hunger for someone—anyone—to provide warm body as we eat tacos and binge-watch Netflix thinking about the one who got away

**1998tweety** (9.3): This song has grown on me a lot since my first listen, def an album highlight now.

**enecks** (9): Yeah this is good but Doves In The Wind is the best song SZA will ever make

**radiofan15** (9): Two extra points for Drew's cameo on the video, be sure to check out her family show Santa Clarita Diet on Netflix

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): just remembered how badly i need a SZA album this year

**wtferrothorn** (9): That chorus is so smooth and sexy, like syrup

**Chevsapher** (8.5): This song never been particularly appealing to me (or my imagination), but it's an objectively good track.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love SZA’s songwriting on this.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Ctrl was a brilliant album and this song is part of the reason why. Some days I'm far from warm enough, but this song will warm me up inside when it comes on.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): to paraphrase a legendary lamb, SZA CAN'T SING! SZA CAN'T SING! TINASHEEEEEEEEEE!

**Brandon6099** (7): Not really into all the SZA hype and this album tbh, it's good I guess.....?

**nooodisaster** (7): The first verse I actually kinda like.

**strawberryswing1** (7): RIP SZA's vocal chords

**ariannagrandtitties** (5.2): v mellow

**xxrandooxx** (4): almost forgot that there was a song playing.

**animefangrant62** (3): SZA is booooooooooooooooring.

**ggodisawomann** (1): SZA is not the tea, I genuinely think she is one of the most boring artists I have ever had the misfortune to listen to and this is not a sabotage either. this song is no exception. this song was produced by Scum which is fitting for this song.

**ryjomom** (1): Sandra Bullock

SuperLove is from the Charity Rate, where it came in third with an 8.508 average. SuperLove is honestly pure pop bliss. I’m glad that she pivoted to music a bit more experimental than this because this sound probably would have grown tired quickly for her, but as a singular song, this is just delightful.

---
**camerinian** (10): wtf how have i missed this this is such a massive tune ok I need every fucking b-side and deep cut charli ever released now, even though this was an actual single god i’m mad at myself

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): wig

**ExtraEater** (10): energy bomb

**kappyko** (10): Charli ascends into "Last Friday Night" or something slightly to the left of new wave revivalism that characterizes everything after 2013. It's one of her best, dropping the ugly goth bass sounds on True Romance and instead going into a pure pop saccharine sound that she thankfully embraced slightly more since Number 1 Angel. The bubblegum vocal loops in the background are a plus.

**lilguavachan** (10): charli should've released more songs like this instead of the pile of dog shit that was sucker

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): idk what rate this was on but this deserved to be here good job popheads

**rotating3Dtext** (10): one of charli’s best, don’t @ me

**Roxieloxie** (10): this kinda sounds like a robot love song but im here for it

**strawberryswing1** (10): I love u/leixander for many reasons, but one large reason I do is because he introduced me to this song. Leix, you deserve everything good in life :comfy:

**1313Harbor** (9.5): PSA to everyone to go watch How to Be Single which is not always a great movie, but it features this song excellently

**CarlieScion** (9): /u/leixander

**Chevsapher** (9): It hasn't aged as well as some of Charli's other songs, but the melodies are exceptional.

**plastichaxan** (9): The first Charli song that clicked with me and this sub helped rediscover her (and my love for this song), thank you popheads.

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): Fun and catchy, love the verses

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm glad we have the Charli XCX we currently have, but she has some excellent True Romance cuts she ought to add to her setlist. This one's no exception

**Arybeck67** (8.5): boppy asf is all I can really say

**wtferrothorn** (8.5): Anybody who says Charli didn't make any good music before PC Music are homophobic tbh

**1998tweety** (8): One of Charli's more normal stuff, honestly I prefer her weird bops.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is what Sucker should’ve sounded like smh

**notdallin** (7.8): the pre-chorus takes forever but that chorus absolutely BLASTS

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): This is.. good but BOY am I glad she found SOPHIE bc Pop 2 >>>>>>>> this

**hikkaru** (7.5): Cute but generic. Maybe I have higher standards in that regard for Charli bc of her newer stuff tho

**frogaranaman** (7): Reminds me of courtship., but not as good.

**nooodisaster** (7): Back when I knew Charli as that weird I Love It girl. Honestly quite fun and bobby but one of her safer hits.

**selegend** (7): her best song tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): decent song but cannot hang with all these timeless bangers

**xxrandooxx** (6.6): It's a song

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.4): is this what acid feels like?

**\_wailordfan** (6): anything pre-Vroom Vroom by Charli isn’t worth living for.

**enecks** (6): This reminds me of those parts in movies where the musician sells out and makes vapid pop. Yeah it's competent, but the soul and personality is gone.

**J\_Toe** (6): not my favourite Charli song. Also, Australian tv and radio has conditioned me to associate "superlove" with Dami Im.

**ryjomom** (4.8): pure white 100% colombian pop music

**radiofan15** (4.5): Damn, those were dark days for Miss XCX

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I do not like Charli's music besides Boom Clap, I Love It, and Boys.

**vhqv1997** (3): I will get lynched for this but Charli has never done it for me. I am just not into the type of mindless repetitive joyful music that she represents and I immediately forgot what this song sounds like the moment it ended. I know it is a bop, and I know it sounds good, but it's just not for me, at all.

**RVA\_101** (2.3): Pump synthesizers and 808s like they're steroids and you get what seems to be a modern 'Don't Stop 'Til you Get Enough', but without the requisite funk

Last Christmas is, believe it or not, from the Holiday rate, where it came in third with a 9.095 average. If this was the first time I ever heard this song, I’d consider giving it an 11. Overplay hasn’t quite killed it for me as it has for many people, but it’s clearly done a number for most. The unfortunate timing of All Stars so soon after Christmas couldn’t have helped it either.

---
**1998tweety** (10): honestly I always preferred the version on Glee but this is good too

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): Love the gays !

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I can’t believe that this depressing song about someone who was dumped around Christmas was a smash. WHAM’s mind is powerful!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): :(

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): wgere is the Carly Rae Jepsen version

**radiofan15** (10): Better than Allie X's misguided and awful cover which is still somehow the highlight in her terrible discography

**Roxieloxie** (10): the only good holiday song next to Mistletoe

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): God, I fucking hate Christmas mu- LAST CHRISTMAS I GAVE YOU MY HEART BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY YOU GAVE IT AWAY

**twat\_brained** (10): While many see it as unfortunate irony that George Michael passed away on Christmas day, I see it as kind of a poetic justice; he's achieved such a ubiquity with Christmas that it's what he becomes in death. A fitting prophecy, if you will. It doesn't make me miss him any less, nor do I think Andrew Ridgeley's keyboard contributions deserve to go unnoticed either. I'm glad this is a Christmas classic, it's a deserving one at that.

**unovachamp** (10): Fight me, best Christmas song to exist

**notdallin** (9.7): this song shouldn’t work. It shouldn’t be as huge as it is. It shouldn’t be a Christmas staple. I mean it’s not even about Christmas or the lore at all! Somehow it manages to thrive as one of the only solely romance-based Christmas songs in the hymnbook against all odds; tightrope walking the edge between 80s cheesiness and sappy balladeering with a wintry flair, transcending this funny anomaly into Christmas canon.

**Brandon6099** (9): LAST CHRISTMASSSS, I GAVE YOU MY HEART

**Chevsapher** (9): It's so annoying, but it's also one of the best earworms ever written, so...

**xxrandooxx** (9): Giving me nostalgic christmas feelings in january fuck you popheads

**Arybeck67** (8): ahhh George Michael’s sweet vocals

**enecks** (8): This is gay so it's good

**hikkaru** (8): i like it because it doesn't sound that much like a christmas song outside of the bells

**rotating3Dtext** (8): only Christmas song I accept and it's sad!!

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): iconic, but unfortunately, it's a christmas song in a January rate

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): classic

**nooodisaster** (7): lmao i cant believe im rating christmas songs in februrary popheads got me fucked up

**selegend** (7): gays own christmas

**RVA\_101** (6.8): Hard to think about the song without thinking about George Michael. Still seemingly hurts two years later.

**ryjomom** (6.6): Carly Rae Jepsen did it First

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Not bad it's not the glee cast version.

**\_wailordfan** (6): it’s nice, but the song just feels out of place in this rate tbh

**camerinian** (6): Like this is one of the Xmas songs that holds up best to replay, but still, good luck getting a good score in the middle of Jan georgie

**wtferrothorn** (6): It's no AIWFCIY, but it's nice enough!

**tapdancingpig** (5): I still don’t like this song. I’m sorry, but I just can’t get into it.

**vhqv1997** (5): Is this song actually good or does the overplay just condition us to think it is?

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.1): ariana grande did it better

**strawberryswing1** (3): Santa Tell Me deserved

**kappyko** (2.5): I'm so sorry the melodies on this song have never felt anything more than awkward and weird and with this production I do not feel a thing. Too sweet for me, too saccharine, etc. George Michael was always best with a bit more funk in him.

**ReallyCreative** (0): Thanks for making a song everyone and their fucking dog wants to make a breathy, obnoxious cover of. I will be taking it out on you via this internet forum song rate, thank you very much.

ThatParanoidPenguin: >SZA goes out before the top 30

###Something really needs to be done about the racism this sub exhibits.

Like it’s been discussed before how stormfront/4chan-like this sub gets, but it seems like every reply I get is someone being racist or hostile towards me just because I may not have the majority opinion. That’s another thing, if you’re not part of the majority opinion, be prepared for downvotes in order to silence you or your remarks being thrown your way (or just low effort rate comments that don’t even encourage any real discussion). I can be outspoken, but I rarely lash out at people the way this sub dogpiles on anyone who doesn’t agree with them.

Even in the rate threads you’re not safe. I stated that I think it’s pretty unfair how people are treating Ariana and thank u, next just because it’s not the skin color they wanted from her, only to be met with downvotes and people challenging my opinion.

I’m at breaking point, which is sad because I once loved this subreddit and it was a safe space from all the racism that goes on in pop music circles, but it’s just become like every other forum. 

Surely I am not alone in this?

Lush Life is the first song out from the Pop Girl Prophecy rate, where it came in second with an 8.9182 average. I only really like two or three Zara songs, and thankfully, this is one of them. Her voice generally bothers me, and while it’s not significantly better here than in other songs of hers imo, this is boppy and enjoyable enough to be decent despite it.

---
**animefangrant62** (10): This was the bop when I was leaving school so I’m nostalgic for it.

**Brandon6099** (10): I LIVE MY DAY AS IF IT WAS THE LAST, LIVE MY DAY AS IF THERE WAS NO PAST, Zara's best song period

**ExtraEater** (10): it actually does feel like summer, thank you zara

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Zara kinda won

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember watching the pop girl prophecy rate and hoping and praying that Zara Larsson wouldn't win like I was so worried that Dua wasn't going to win and when Zara didn't win I let out a sigh of relief. But... you know, after thinking about it for a while I kinda think Lush Life deserved to win. Like Blow Your Mind is good but at this point I honestly think I prefer Lush Life. Alternatively, Be the One could've won but that would've required too much taste to be exhibited.

**selegend** (10): shouldve won

**strawberryswing1** (10): deserved to win, pop perfection tbh

**twat\_brained** (10): I adore this song but u/mrswearword thank you so much for giving it a bad score so Blow Your Mind would win instead. I hope this still sneaks into the top 10 somehow.

**Chevsapher** (9.8): I'm going to be honest, this song reminds me of snorting heroin and working at Walmart... it was not a healthy part of my life. Regardless, I still love this track; it's one of the best pop songs of the decade.

**1998tweety** (9): Pop masterpiece, but she's a disgusting misandrist so she losses a point.

**Arybeck67** (9): isa underrated bop y’all

**enecks** (9): mm lush

**ryjomom** (9): Summer Anthem! I said it!

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song is delightful and Zara needs to get these writers back.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): lush.com life

**nooodisaster** (8): I like how this has like, 4 choruses. That's creativity.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It’s fine but it doesn’t stand out as a song. It’s another one of those songs that would play while you are shopping at Forever 21 (I feel like I’ve made this comment like 3 times already this rate IM SORRY)

**radiofan15** (7.5): How was this one the big hit on her album when Never Forget You, Ain't My Fault and even I Would Like are infinitely better?

**ariannagrandtitties** (7): giving me summer vibes in the dead of winter

**camerinian** (7): As fun as the melody is, I always think songs that are explicitly about crushes and mentions them as such are really immature, and the lyrics kinda make me cringe, even though Zara is six months younger than me and oh god what am I doing with my life

**Roxieloxie** (7): something something WOC queen

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): there was a period of time when i was really into zara larsson and even during this period i didn't really care much for this song

**xxrandooxx** (6.8): fun song

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): that baseline deserves a shoutout

Underneath the Tree came in second in the Holiday Music rate with a 9.505 average. This is honestly unironically one of my favorite Kelly Clarkson songs ever, the massive chorus is delightful and she serves vocals all throughout the song. A queen, this song deserved way better.

---
**ariannagrandtitties** (11): OOOoooOooOoHh

**1998tweety** (10): Kelly is a queen

**ExtraEater** (10): it's like a giant christmas parade you can't hate this

**hikkaru** (10): I normally can't stand Christmas music but Miss Clarkson really unwrapped my wig here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Oh my she did that

**itsabop** (10): One of the BEST Christmas songs!

**lilguavachan** (10): ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ kelly clarkson take my energy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

**ManofOranges** (10): I'd never heard this before the rate, so I had no idea that Kelly was going to absolutely serve. Love this.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love Kelly

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is one of the only X-mas songs i like

**saucymac** (10): can this please be the new 'all i want for christmas is you' song? thanks

**selegend** (10): better than mariah

**strawberryswing1** (10): FUCK ME UP KELLY

**twat\_brained** (10): Kelly straight up dropped a future Christmas classic like it was nothing, we don't deserve her.

**\_wailordfan** (9): I feel bad because I voted Last Christmas pretty low, but Kelly’s vocals deserve everything

**Brandon6099** (9): christmas boppp

**HerculesMeow** (9): Miss Clarkson serving VOCALS

**vhqv1997** (9): I forgot that there was a holiday songs rate and kept asking myself why this song was here

**notdallin** (8.7): it’s weird and just plain depressing listening to Christmas music in January. But despite that, freaking underneath the tree holds up against all these other 11-month appropriate pop songs!!!!

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): I hate Christmas music but I have to get behind this BOP

**1313Harbor** (8.5): Kelly knew we needed a Christmas bop for the 21st century, and she delivered

**Chevsapher** (8.5): Wait, Kelly Clarkson sings this song?!

**ryjomom** (8.5): kelly invented cats under trees

**Arybeck67** (8): Kelly Kelly Kelly, damn good Christmas song.

**ggodisawomann** (8): we stan Kelly

**ignitethephoenix** (8): it’s feel wrong listening to this in January

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): as far as christmas songs go, this is a bop, unfortunately, it's still a christmas song

**tapdancingpig** (8): This is lovely.

**kappyko** (7.5): The intro is a 10/10, the rest of the song is great. I have literally never heard this until I consciously decided to after the rate. It's really good.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): honestly if we did this rate in December I would be shaking my ass to this

**radiofan15** (7.2): This is the same score I gave to this forgettable BOP in the original rate... my opinion hasn't unsurprisingly changed absolutely just some weeks after having originally rated it

**Brendon-Urine** (7): It's February and this song still held up? Impressive.

**nooodisaster** (7): One More Sleep, Santa Tell Me, and more found alive. The ad-libs are fire tho.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I feel so awkward listening to Christmas music in late January

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): christmas music is not my thing

**enecks** (6): Yeah it's an OK christmas song but that's a low bar

**moooo566** (6): pales in comparison to nostalgia for the xmas songs i grew up with

**BearlyEvenAPun** (4): As we get further from the holidays the lower this score will go. Some holiday songs are fine to listen to year round. This is not one of them.

**wtferrothorn** (3.5): Sounds like it should be playing over a trailer for the newest Hallmark Christmas movie

**camerinian** (3): it's already hard enough listening to this when the southern hemisphere has Christmas in summer, now you want me to listen to it and rate it in the middle of January when it’s even hotter??? Good luck Kelly

**RVA\_101** (2.6): Creative starvation for a musical artist always manifests itself in the form of a Christmas album.

**bbfan132** (2): snore, keep this in kohl’s and bed bath & beyond

**frogaranaman** (1): Something about this song irks me and I don’t know why.

Smooth came in second in the Grammys Song of the Year rate with an 8.700 average. Honestly, never thought Smooth stood a chance here, but popheads proved me wrong. It’s a fun song no doubt, but honestly I’m almost sick of it at this point. Definitely deserved to do well though.

---
**ggodisawomann** (11): Rob Thomas is the unrecognized king

**moooo566** (11): I'd Rather Be Listening to Grammy-Award Winning 1999 Hit Smooth By Santana Feat. Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty

**camerinian** (10): I’m cackling at the thought of all the Northern Hemisphere cucks rating “man it’s a hot one” in the middle of a snowstorm. Come enjoy this song in the South Pacific heat wave like it was intended

**enecks** (10): Maybe this is the best song ever. But Lorde didn't sing it so no 11.

**frogaranaman** (10): This is a classic. [6]

**ignitethephoenix** (10): An iconic song still 20 years later. Santana’s guitar parts are so amazing still.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we stan a song that made 2 different decade end lists

**itsabop** (10): Classic throwback bop

**ManofOranges** (10): The first #1 of the millennium and deservedly so. This song is amazing in every way possible I love it so much.

**poppinmmolly** (10): I have a bad feeling this will be robbed even though it deserves much more than it will get.

**radiofan15** (10): EVERYONE STAND UP FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM

**strawberryswing1** (10): FUCK ME UP ROBBIE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Someone: … Me: MAN IT’S A HOT ONE

**Chevsapher** (9.6): The song is overhyped and the pronunciation is ridiculous, but it's an addictive and masterfully crafted piece of music regardless.

**1998tweety** (8.7): Iconic af

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): this has gotta be the straightest song to feature in any rate on popheads

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): stream Lonely No More

**RVA\_101** (8.3): Probably a good thing I wasn't old enough to hear this everywhere I turned and wanting to kill myself

**twat\_brained** (8.2): As brilliant as this song is, imagine how much more legendary it would be with a Latin vocalist like Enrique Iglesias or Marc Anthony. Like I can hear Enrique on some of the notes Rob sings here, and I can just see it being even more classic than it already is. That's my big takeaway from listening to it. That's not to discredit Carlos Santana's immense guitar talents, he can do things most guitar players only dream of. I just don't think this song's full potential was realized.

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): what are we, jazz heads? But it’s cute, but the melody is so played out in my head at this point that it is almost aggravating

**nooodisaster** (7): If this was "Hairy" it'd get my 11.

**notdallin** (7): so is it like, 7 inches from the tip (of the sun) to the bottom (of the radius)? You know, just over here asking the real questions

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): More PTSD from my childhood but this song just drags on for way too long for me to enjoy it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): my bf hates this song lmao. it's aggressively meh

**xxrandooxx** (6): Don't even get me started about this song, I played it for jazz band and pep band for 4 years.

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.9): semi-jazzy track playing before my homicide

**ryjomom** (4): catchy but not in a good way

**selegend** (4): i’m gay.

**kappyko** (3.5): This song is the sound of oil on my face baking in the sun. Nickelback vocals over good Latin rhythms. Sorry ffourth

**wtferrothorn** (3.5): I'd rather be not listening to the Grammy award winning 1999 hit Smooth by Santana feat. Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty off the multi-platinum Supernatural

The second in a row song to go out from the Grammys Song of the Year rate, where it tied for third with an 8.645 average. Funny how the 5th and 6th place song in that rate (Viva La Vida, Not Ready to Make Nice) have outlasted the second and third. Anyways Alicia Keys is still an icon and serves some great vocals here.

---
**gannade** (10): One of the best songs of all time!

**lilacsweetener** (10): Still gets me every time

**strawberryswing1** (10): We love a homewrecker

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I gave this an 8 in my own damn rate but I have learned my lesson.

**twat\_brained** (10): Wait… the album says Songs in A Minor, yet this is in the key of E minor? INSTA-ZERO /s Alicia did not come to play on this, and it's hard to imagine her coming out with a better debut single. We should rate an album of hers sometime!

**ggodisawomann** (9): fallin, a song for when you're deep in your feelings and need to BELT

**ReallyCreative** (9): A classic, amazing song from a total queen

**rotating3Dtext** (9): wow classic

**Roxieloxie** (9): queen of piano

**vhqv1997** (9): This song has been performed so many times on singing competitions that I'm not even sure Alicia is the original singer anymore

**notdallin** (8.8): I really hated this song at the time and I don’t think I can articulate quite why. It just wasn’t my style but it really is groundbreaking for a pop song. All at once catchy and soulful, dipping into Motown, R&B, and jazz, snowballing into a beautiful collage of plinks, strings, and harmonies.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The strings are lovely, and the vocals are impressive.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Is this song in A minor? No. Is this song THAT BITCH? Yes. Yes it is.

**RVA\_101** (8.5): Practically a neo-soul standard at this point

**1998tweety** (8): This is a little boring not gonna lie

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): stream In Common

**wtferrothorn** (8): Impossible not to stan those vocals

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): not so off-keys here

**Arybeck67** (7): great vocals, but idk, I wasn’t really enamoured with it

**enecks** (7): This has a smoothness to it I admire

**kappyko** (7): Alicia Keys has never been quite on my radar, and I always wonder why I never have sudden urges to listen to her. "Fallin'" is surprisingly great to hear in the car, and I sang along to this in the car. Her vocals maintain a smooth soulfulness, latching onto every "fallin" and transforming them into a restrained force of power. Lush arrangements and a hip hop beat (produced entirely by her!) complete the arrangement.

**camerinian** (6.5): Alicia Keys is a stunning vocalist, but I think one too many X Factor covers by singers who sound exactly the same as her has taken the sparkle off of this song a bit

**frogaranaman** (6): It’s cute but I never was fully into this song. Sad.

**selegend** (6): Iconic debut single, I miss her

**radiofan15** (5): This is the song version of the movie A Wrinkle In Time... as in boring, uninteresting and technically nice but overally flat

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.3): just alicia keys showing off

**xxrandooxx** (4): Her voice is great, but this song is drier than my school’s cafeteria turkey. She did not win the “key” to my heart

**ryjomom** (3): WTF is this song, it is messy but i like certain aspects

Tears Dry On Their Own came in fifth in the British Sophomore rate with an 8.978 average. It’s a big bop and one of Amy’s better songs, and I was expecting it to go a bit higher than this, but it’s far from my favorite song in the rate. Rest in peace Amy, you’ll always be an icon.

---
**radiofan15** (11): Storytime... The day Amy died (a Saturday) I was getting ready for a friend's birthday with a sleepover and everything but I find out a little bit too late that it was a plot to get me to have sex because I was in the closet at the time and he only invited some of his gay friends to the sleepover, I didn't find out about this until it was too late... anyway, I lost my virginity that night to a guy that looked like Stifler from American Pie and the next day (Sunday) I found out that Amy had died, which immediatly made the whole experience awful because I could only think that Amy (which helped me to diversify my musical pallette and has remained as one of my faves ever since she became popular) was being mourned by the whole world while some greasy fingers were entering my asshole... anyway, may she rest in peace.

**1313Harbor** (10): brb crying forever and looking up how to send dog shit to Amy's dad

**camerinian** (10): Ten-year old me was one of those stupid little boys who joked about Amy Winehouse for all of her stupid tabloidy drama, and never gave most of her music a second glance, but this was the one that broke through to me. The Motown-ish groove is undeniable, the hook is perhaps the most powerful she’s ever had, and the emotional journeys Amy goes through in the space of this song are nothing short of breathtaking

**enecks** (10): Yep this is amazing. A kind of amazing we don't get - yeah Adele has some of that retro vocal style, but her instrumentals just aren't this compelling.

**gannade** (10): is amy overrated? yes. does this song bump? yes.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song took a few listens for it to grow on me, but I think it’s one of Amy’s best songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my wig flies on it's own

**kappyko** (10): Amy Winehouse's take on soul music had a remarkable singer/songwriter flair to it, and as much as Ronson's '60s pop pastiche is fantastic it's really her presence as a charismatic lyricist and storyteller that seals the deal. It's pure pop soul excellence, utilizing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" and creating a new scene of dismayed lives slowly unraveling. The edges of her music have always been underrated.

**lilguavachan** (10): rest in peace, mother winehouse

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): Amy deserved the world.

**1998tweety** (9): I love how this song builds up towards the end, Amy's vocals do a very good job at adding towards that build-up.

**Chevsapher** (9): Detailed production, expressive vocals, solid songwriting.

**moooo566** (9): amy <3333

**ReallyCreative** (9): The only thing about this song that isn't amazing is how it ends, everything else is just about perfect

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm pickin it up, pickin it up, loving and living and pickin it up. Never really been one for the 1970s soul sound but Amy knew how to make it her own!

**Arybeck67** (8.5): we stan moving on

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Timeless classic.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): My tears dry on their own because a) I cry a lot and I’m used to it and b) I’m too lazy to wipe them away

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): OK i originally gave this song a really low score, not sure wtf was going on because this is definitely one of amy’s best songs.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): not quite goddess level like some of her other tracks but still a good song

**notdallin** (6.9): great sample but it just doesn’t quite reach the itch that I get when the chorus climaxes and I just want to break oUT INTO BABY THERE AIN’T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH~~

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): I think her voice and this sample really work well together

**frogaranaman** (5): The “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” sample really throws me off and I don’t like it.

**wtferrothorn** (4.5): I love Amy but this is a bit too derivative of it's inspirations

**RVA\_101** (4): This one makes me mad because out of all 5 of the singles on that 10/10 album you picked what's actually my least favorite single. Still give it points for the excellent reuse of the (far superior) Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrill duet.

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.5): very repetitive. not much to make it stand out.

**xxrandooxx** (3): very theatrical and fun but not my cup of tea.

**ryjomom** (2.5): not my type of music, but I understand the appeal

**strawberryswing1** (2): can we please stop rating Amy and Adele oml

Bye Bye Bye came in second in the Y2K rate with a 9.410 average, and honestly that’s what its average should’ve been here too because this is one of the biggest bops to ever walk the planet and deserved day 3 for sure. One of JT’s best.

I was reminded of how much JC Chasez carried not only this song, but NSYNC as a whole, no matter how many solos they gave JT. I'm reminded of this song's energy, the firepower it has, and how "bye bye bye, BYE BYE!" will be remembered as two of the most enduring and everlasting seconds in not only teen power pop, but pop music in general. Others believed in a song I'd neglected to give a second chance. You've given me an opportunity which I'm not going to waste this time around. NSYNC is my muse, and Bye Bye Bye is my 11. I can only hope it goes top 5.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this is a huge bop, iconic song, timeless.

**animefangrant62** (10): I forgot how good this was.

**Brandon6099** (10): BABY BYE BYE BYE, I mean how can you not like this song and give it at least an 8, issa classic bopp

**Chevsapher** (10): Vocals, a great bassline, a harp... pop doesn't get better than this.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song (and music video) is the definition of iconic

**itsabop** (10): Classic throwback bop

**ManofOranges** (10): 90s classic I love this song so much.

**selegend** (10): honestly i want it that way, genie in a bottle, and bye bye bye should be the top 3 of this rate

**strawberryswing1** (10): 90S KIDS STAND UP !!!!!!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): /u/piccprincess is bi bi bi

**camerinian** (9): I was 2 when this song came out so my closest association with this bop is the prawns from Shark Tale dancing to it on a DVD extra please tell me I'm not the only one who remembers that

**frogaranaman** (9): This is a classic. [3]

**ReallyCreative** (9): Sometimes I think the late 90s/early 00s were actually just a fever dream and its songs like this that reinforce that belief

**vhqv1997** (9): Iconic

**radiofan15** (8.5): R.I.P. in peace N*Sync... GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): banger

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.2): @bois who think they can get this

**enecks** (8): Okay this might have flaws if you analyse it but that chorus is the right flavour of punchy to make me love it

**moooo566** (8): i wish i could dance as well as j timbz

**notdallin** (7.8): did anyone else have the realization that *NSYNC just adapts the chicken dance for the choreography of this song? o.O

**RVA\_101** (7.2): Very similar to 'I Want it that Way' in that I don't care much for either of them and still end up singing along if it crosses my ears.

**Arybeck67** (7): hehe NO...just no

**nooodisaster** (7): Are str8s necessary, part 2.

**Roxieloxie** (7): the true bisexual anthem. strangers wishes

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): can't wait to say bye bye bye to this song

**wtferrothorn** (6.5): one of the times I prefer to *NSYNC to Backstreet

**\_wailordfan** (6): another boy band, another overrated song with too much harmonization. If frosted tips was a song, this would be it.

**ryjomom** (6): I prefer Boys Boys Boys - Lady Gaga

**xxrandooxx** (5.2): In twenty bi-teen we refer to this song as bi bi bi.

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): nostalgia doesnt make something good

**kappyko** (3): Justin Timberlake really dodged a bullet huh

**lilguavachan** (2): i wasn't a fan of the backstreet boys, i was even less of a fan of nsync.

Cloudbusting is the last song out from the OG Art Pop rate, where it came in second with a 9.706 average. The lyrics and instrumentation here are wonderful, and while Kate Bush’s delivery here is great, something about her voice has just never quite 100% done it for me.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (11): i'm legally obligated to give this an 11 also it's my favorite song in the entire world and everyone who scores under a 10 WILL be hearing from my lawyer

**1313Harbor** (10): obsessed with the strings

**1998tweety** (10): This song feels kind of surreal honestly, it make me think of the meaning of life and all that weird stuff

**\_wailordfan** (10): another 11 stealer potentially!

**camerinian** (10): This song has convinced me to actually go and listen to more Kate Bush beyond the two songs everyone knows, because this really does sound magical

**enecks** (10): I am actually speechless at how good this is.

**J\_Toe** (10): The OG Artpop deserves a 10

**kappyko** (10): Kate Bush original alt pop girl slam dunks on every alt pop girl by singing producing and writing a song about making a cloud machine who else would do this smfh

**plastichaxan** (10): This is unlike any other song and the only song that it hurt not to give my 11 to.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): wow this track is incredible, the gradual progression and evolution of the song building to a this crescendo of harmonizing voices is gorgeous

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song sounds like a flaming cotton candy centrifuge

**vhqv1997** (10): We're cloudbusting daddy

**wtferrothorn** (10): Fitting title, because the scope of this song could break through the atmosphere

**Chevsapher** (9.8): Lush, intricate, dramatic. Plus, it's aged very well.

**twat\_brained** (9.6): I wonder what Peter was thinking when he first heard this song. I was surprised to find Genius notes on this but sure enough they were there. I'll definitely think of this song next time I travel to Britain, and it's raining out in the countryside. I get the hype for it.

**notdallin** (9.4): takes notes Lana! This is how you write a song that includes the words “daddy” and “yayo”!!!!!

**Roxieloxie** (8): this feels very much like a broadway song

**radiofan15** (7.5): Let me guess... this is gonna be u/cloudbustingmp3's 11, isn't it?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): need to listen to the album

**nooodisaster** (7): Ever since I found out the lyrics are about like some dead son's radioactive father getting sent to jail or something I've connected with the song a lot less.

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.5): fun but dated

**frogaranaman** (6): This Final Fantasy song isn’t as good as I expected.

**RVA\_101** (5.7): Staccato violins and that voice.

**gannade** (5): interesting

**ggodisawomann** (5): these weird ethereal vocals are not for me

**xxrandooxx** (5): wholesome fun song

**ryjomom** (2): huh

I Want It That Way came in seventh in the Y2K Teen Pop rate with a 9.015 average. This is, in my honest opinion, one of, if not the best boy band songs to ever exist. This is a classic in every sense of the word, everybody knows this song and everybody will get going to this song. How it missed top 20 here is beyond me. 

---
**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10

**ggodisawomann** (10): one of the first songs I really love loved

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A legendary song

**lilacsweetener** (10): YOU ARE...

**ManofOranges** (10): Classic 90s song ugh Max Martin really just has a way with words.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): key changes are the shit 🔥

**radiofan15** (10): This is the best boyband song of all time and you can't change my mind

**Roxieloxie** (10): I love this song entirely to much for someone who first heard it summer 2018. If it wasnt for 1D this would be an 11

**selegend** (10): One of the most iconic songs of the turn of the century

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song is perfect and no amount of toxic masculinity or boyband fatigue can convince me otherwise.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): giving this anything less than a 10 feels like betraying my childhood i cannot do it i'm sorry

**twat\_brained** (10): Max Martin forgot to write meaningful lyrics here but I'd much rather this than Break Free, for one because you can hear what each Backstreet Boy is saying here, and I mean EACH ONE because they all get a solo here. I never understood why NSYNC didn't give more solo time to Joey, Chris or Lance. Anyway there's no boyband ballad more quintessential than this one, respect it like the classic it is!

**vhqv1997** (10): Hey look they made that Brooklyn Nine-Nine cold open into a full song

**camerinian** (9.5): I never really thought about it, but isn't it wild that the verses and chorus are exactly as iconic as each other? Like, even in the best pop songs, that's pretty rare

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The lyrics are trite, but it's all so ridiculously catchy! Pure, unapologetic pop.

**1313Harbor** (9): Really truly a great song despite the lyrics making zero sense

**Brandon6099** (9): I WANT IT THAT WAY

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiAo5PDKawI

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I think I had PTSD from being closeted in elementary school knowing something was different about me but not knowing what it was from listening to this song. It's a bop though.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (8): Weird Al did it better

**LuckyKidA** (8): I member when this video premiered on mtv (or was it vh1?) in 1999, i was there watching the tv, it was epic and that's all i'm have to say.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): so much of their dicography is cheesy beyond enjoyment but this… good

**notdallin** (7.9): I ship Brian and AJ singing that they are each other’s fire *and* desire in adjacent verses r/songsthataresecretlygay

**ryjomom** (7.9): I was 2 months old when this fire dropped

**plastichaxan** (7.8): iconic song maybe men have made some points

**RVA\_101** (7.3): Embarrassed to admit I'd probably unwittingly sing Wierd Al's 'eBay' parody lyrics if this were to pop up at a karaoke

**frogaranaman** (7): This is an iconic dad anthem.

**J\_Toe** (7): can someone please explain how the lyrics don't work, cos I get it but also don't get it

**nooodisaster** (7): me: Are men really necessary for pop music? me: Listens to pop music, which is overrun with men producers.

**xxrandooxx** (7): This song gives me strong memories of watching animated harry potter puppet pals videos why would you do this to me.

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.8): very good but mainly out of nostalgia (and b99)

**\_wailordfan** (6): I don’t care how iconic this is, 5 piece boy bands that harmonize everything are annoying and so overrated.

**swadadu** (5.7): The fire/desire rhyme knocked one whole point off this for me

**Arybeck67** (5.5): hahahaha NO! God NO!

**wtferrothorn** (5.5): Needs more oomph in the production tbh

**enecks** (4): This gets on my shit list for fire/desire rhyming

**kappyko** (3.5): Turn of the millennium pop production and songwriting has aged weirdly. There isn't a hint of dance traditions in this, mostly vague R&B cues, drum machines, and vocals that mostly echo a Celine Dion song on 2x speed. It's not bad at all and I like it. It's just up against songs that mean more to me.

**lilguavachan** (3): i was never really a fan of boy bands as a child. i haven't changed at all.

Midnight City placed 6th in the Charity Rate with an 8.296 average, and is the fourth of five songs out from said rate. I’m surprised this even got the fan vote support to make it into the rate, let alone made the top 20. It isn’t a song I’ve seen particularly strong stanning for on here ever besides a strong performance in the Charity rate, and it outdid some actually somewhat widely loved songs here. That’s not a complaint though, because this song is pure sugary electronic fun and deserves this placement entirely.

---
**animefangrant62** (10): I wish it was Wait that made it into this rate but this is still amazing.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): I can hardly tell what they're saying, but with a track like this I don't think it really matters.

**camerinian** (10): Legitimately half the reason why I bought GTA V a second time for PC was so I could hear this on Non-Stop Pop. It took me eight years of trying to get this song’s appeal to understand it, but there you go. Iconic.

**Chevsapher** (10): I don't know what it is, but there's something magical about this song.

**enecks** (10): This was in heavy deliberation for my 11. It's what we think the 80's is, but in fact it's way more.

**ExtraEater** (10): good but far from 11 good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of the most iconic songs of this decade

**notdallin** (10): Like so many indie pop greats before it where the tendency is not to sing the vocal line, the subdued verses, or even the countermelody with actual lyrics but the wordless, anthemic ghostly synths as they hoot and holler in every direction in one of the most anthemic choruses of this decade. And all at once, I feel like the classic small-kid-moving-to-the-big-city movie trope riding in the back of my parents’ station wagon widely gazing up at the fish-eyed skyscrapers, so entranced by the city that I sacredly utter the lyric, “the city is my church.”

**strawberryswing1** (10): u/tragickingdom1

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m2fVWj99x4

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): iconic ever-lasting banger, never gets old

**twat\_brained** (10): Genius tells me the high pitched sting is just Anthony Gonzalez's pitched voice. This song is literally ahead of it's time holy shit. Midnight City and Lean On are probably the only two examples of vocal pitching done correctly. I positively adore this song because it doesn't focus on the lyrics.

**ManofOranges** (9.5): A classic

**frogaranaman** (9): This is a classic. [2]

**hikkaru** (9): A couple weeks ago my drunk friend collapsed on the floor crying to this song and we thought she died

**1998tweety** (8.2): This is nice but it makes my head hurt a little honestly.

**ryjomom** (8.2): I can see myself driving through downtown Chicago at night to this bop. No cares in the world just driving with friends.

**Roxieloxie** (8): Those beeps in the background are impossible to forget

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): the production is so overpowering, I get the love, but the vocals are too weak for my liking.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this song is the ultimate teenage indie movie/tv song

**wtferrothorn** (7.5): The synth line that shook the nation

**kappyko** (7): I admire the arena synths and I hope it does well but I also just realized I don't love this that much. I think the vocals have really rubbed off their value. The descending synths are crazy.

**nooodisaster** (7): file this under "oh, so THAT's the name of that riff"

**radiofan15** (7): Synths aside, this is nothign particualry special or catchy

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): ngl, I like M83 but this song is so overplayed and overrated i can't take it seriously

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.3): not something i would listen to but good for background noises

**plastichaxan** (6): This used to be one of my favorite songs and somehow I stopped listening to it, coming back to it I can see why. (still kinda like it)

**xxrandooxx** (5.5): It's a song that exists on this playlist

**Brendon-Urine** (5): Overrated. Never liked this song, probably never will.

**J\_Toe** (5): I guess I never committed the name M83 to memory, but I recognise the hook of this song (or whatever that riff in the intro is)

**selegend** (5): definitely iconic. but also sounds like meme music.

**RVA\_101** (4.7): Listen to the song while staring at the cover for the single. It amplifies the effect. Or so they say.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): all offense but this is SO overrated and Go! (ft. Mai Lan) is what this song thinks it is

Follow Your Arrow came in second in the New Country Girls rate with a 9.463 average. This is easily the most progressive relevant country song of the modern era, and essentially kickstarted Kacey Musgraves’ career, who is now a sub icon. I’m surprised it didn’t make it to day 3 honestly: Kacey Musgraves is beloved here, it’s pretty explicitly LGBT allying, and there are even country songs still left in the rate (let’s go Love Story and Not Ready to Make Nice!). I guess this had just a little too much twang for popheads as a whole.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10. When this was released I wasn't a huge fan of country, but this like the one country song I loved.

**Arybeck67** (10): yeehaw beech

**Brendon-Urine** (10): God this is such a cute song. This is my first time hearing it and I was legit smiling the ENTIRE song. All hail the yeehaw queen.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): kacey can say f----t

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Queen of the gays fuck ariana lives

**itsabop** (10): Love the message, fave Kacey song

**lilguavachan** (10): queen of the rural LGBTQ community

**ManofOranges** (10): I gave this song a 10 in its original rate and I'm giving it a 10 because that's what it deserves. We love a transgressive hit.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Ended body shaming, ended homophobia, legalized weed across the world, is there anything this song CAN'T do?

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I just really love the message in this song. It's so wholesome :comfy:

**strawberryswing1** (10): I would die for Kacey

**twat\_brained** (10): Since doing this rate, I've really come to appreciate the song and the message behind it. It's something I'll carry with me and say to myself next time I think I might get ridiculed for doing something I think is fun. Nay, I'll think of me and about a thousand others chanting the final chorus in unison to Kacey on the Oh, What a World Tour. Wherever my arrow points :)

**Chevsapher** (9.8): A catchy, clever song validating my sexuality and current abstinence from drug use? Thanks, Kacey.

**1313Harbor** (9.5): Kacey Musgraves is the future

**\_wailordfan** (9): a cute gay anthem, but not tooooooo gay because I can pander to my cuntry fans, but not abandon them cause $$$

**enecks** (9): Fuck Girl Crush - this should've been the standard bearer for LGBT country

**ggodisawomann** (9): WHAT A CUTE SONG

**kappyko** (9): I always admired her kitsch take on country pop in this, I ought to check out the album.

**notdallin** (9): Kacey Musgraves advice flow chart for anyone feeling marginalized—>roll a joint

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Not really a fan of country but this is such a good song. Basically because lyrically it’s almost anti-country.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I was a straight sober Christian before I listened to this song, and now I'm a gay weed atheist. Thanks Kacey!

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Ugh I wish I was one of the gays Kacey bullied in high school. /s needed?

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): we love a swear-dodging PG friendly queen

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): ➡️

**Roxieloxie** (7.2): Kacey is still a little too corny and country for me but this isnt bad

**xxrandooxx** (7.2): I love the lyrics

**tapdancingpig** (7): I like this song a lot, but... Naps I see you trying to appeal to the gays.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Born This Way and The Motto found dead in a ditch

**radiofan15** (6.7): Cute YYEHAW song I guess?

**RVA\_101** (6.4): A song's greatness is quantified through lyrics like 'if you don't save yourself from marriage you're a [w]hor[e]rible person'

**animefangrant62** (6): it’s wholesome but I’ll never listen to it again

**camerinian** (6): I really want to like this more, considering how great the rest of Kacey's stuff is, but honestly I just can't work with the lyrical delivery. It feels really fucking high school “vent all your problems at once”, and that doesn't really make for compelling material. Nice tune though

**swadadu** (6): Gay Rights! – Kacey Musgraves

**wtferrothorn** (6): the lyrics are anything but subtle, but tea was spilt

**frogaranaman** (5): Yeehaw. [3]

**J\_Toe** (5): the beat/tamberine(?)/musicality sounds like a children's song

**ryjomom** (3.9): I love the lyrics even though this type of country disgusts me

Genie in a Bottle came in 3rd in the Y2K Teen Pop rate with a 9.397 average, and honestly I’m a bit surprised it didn’t fair better here. Genie in a Bottle is a classic hit and one of Christina’s signature songs, and deservedly so. The central metaphor of the song is super entertaining, it barely sounds aged, and the chorus is extremely catchy. A song that pop stars of today wish they could make!

---
**selegend** (11): one of the best songs in existence

**1998tweety** (10): Crying in the Club was robbed of success

**gannade** (10): Legendtina

**itsabop** (10): One of my faves from the 90s and Christina

**J\_Toe** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdDsa0jnD4

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is me and my friends' go to karaoke song

**ReallyCreative** (10): I really should have known I was gay when this song was released but alas

**twat\_brained** (10): Legendtina burst out onto the scene in a BIG WAY here, and you shouldn't let a lacklustre comeback get in the way of that. Britney may be my main ho but this past year I've started to appreciate Christina more and I refuse to accept anything less than an 8.6 average for this song.

**Chevsapher** (9.8): A gem among gems.

**ggodisawomann** (9.5): gotta rub me the right way

**plastichaxan** (9.2): This was fundamental in my raising as a gay kid.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): a classic

**hikkaru** (9): Dirrty was supposed to be her turn to sexual songs (god what a bop) but she was really out here singing about someone "rubbing her the right way"

**tapdancingpig** (9): I really don’t like Christina Aguilera, but this song is great.

**wtferrothorn** (9): The production on this snapped tbh

**radiofan15** (8.9): Gorgeous song... Britney outsold but gorgeous song nothenless

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): that rub innuendo is too much

**notdallin** (8.6): I was such a naïve 9-year-old hearing this song in 1999. After reading those lyrics, I’m definitely all grown up now.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "My body's saying let's go/But my heart is saying no" is a HOOK.

**Arybeck67** (8): og bop that I cannot deny

**enecks** (8): The verses are just tense enough to make the chorus explosive - a well-composed take on that scene.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): ok but why aren’t we rating the dove cameron version

**vhqv1997** (8): Back when Christina knew about this thing called "restraint"

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): It's kinda slow but it's still pretty good

**ryjomom** (7.5): If only my boyfriend rubbed me the right way like this song.

**RVA\_101** (7.2): Points added because listening to the song on YouTube just now so I could review it made me realize this is one chorus melody I always recognized and could never get a name on

**camerinian** (7): lol i’ve always hated xtina but she avoids most of her xtina-isms here so this is fine

**ImADudeDuh** (7): not as good as i remember?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): slightly overrated

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The Aladdin remake never should’ve been greenlit

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): a 7

**frogaranaman** (4): Unsurprisingly mediocre.

**kappyko** (3): Casey Frey did this better. This song does very little for me in its tinny production and swaying vocals. The hook works and that's about all I'm here for.

Love came in 6th in the 2017 Alt Pop rate with an 8.906 average, and was the highest placing non-Lorde song besides the eventual winner, Los Ageless. It’s a beautiful and fantastically written song, providing a rare glimpse of happiness in her life. However, despite this, it is to its core very much a Lana del Rey song, and anyone who doesn’t like her slow, brooding style probably won’t be the biggest fan of Love either.

---
**1998tweety** (11): One of Lana's best songs honestly, I don't get while people ranking it lowly among her lead singles. This was my favourite song of 2017 and still remains a song I listen to regularly. I know people jokingly call Lana "mom", but she really feels like a mother singing to her children in this song.

**notdallin** (11): this song stands out as a unique snapshot in time for Lana Del Rey compared to everything she had released previous and everything she’s released since. Dropped around Valentine’s Day in 2017, I first heard the song while working in a local ice cream shop right after I graduated from undergrad and although it was massively different sonically, I appreciated the track for how it narrated my provincial life rather than swirl glamorously and egocentrically; for once, Lana’s pronouns changed from “I” and “me” (as in “will you still love me when I’m no longer young and beautiful” or “Kiss me hard before you go” or “I’m in his favorite sundress watching me get undressed”) to “all you kids.” Suddenly my traipse to work and transitional lifestyle felt approved from someone with experience, telling me that I’m the future and that this short time for *me* just to be young and in love was enough. There’s still plenty of room in my heart for Lana’s Hollywood sadcore music that writhes in self-loathing and self-indulgence but for that lowkey Valentine’s day in 2017, “Love” was all I needed. *Don’t worry baby…*

**Arybeck67** (10): freakin LOVE this song ahh

**Brandon6099** (10): And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy, maybe not one of her best songs but I absolutely love this song when it came out and still do <3

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): robbed in the alt rat

**ExtraEater** (10): really good music video like wow

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of Lana's best

**kappyko** (10): Brill Building pop in a moon dome with Emile Haynie. If that's love I want it now.

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember when I tried to listen to Lust for Life I just really couldn't get into it but this song kept me coming back. It's so soothing and it just connects with me in a way I can't even explain.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i forgot about this song omg

**selegend** (10): so fuckin beautiful

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song lulled me to sleep each night in early 2017, of course I’m giving it full marks.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): If my girl👧😍 and my Crosley record player💯🔥 are both drowning🌊😦 and I could only save one😄☝️️ you can Catch me letting it spin Love by Lana Del Rey at my girls funeral😅👻💀 Cause it's Lust For Life or catch a fade my pophead🙏👊

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this song is so fucking beautiful ugh how does she do it

**vhqv1997** (10): Just want to point out that this is the sixth rate Lana has been in and except for the first All Stars rate, Lorde is there every single time. I'm not saying this is a conspiracy, but if Love gets cut before Green Light, I'm calling the FBI

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The atmosphere is palpable.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9.5): "I look at The Sun, and I look in The Mirror" is still one of the most genius lines i've heard in any pop song

**nooodisaster** (9): Me wanting this song not to be completely snubbed: hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it.

**ryjomom** (9): She really rhymed “particular” with “enough” ughhh her mind, like the mind of a master, so creative

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Don’t get why their are random gun loading noises in the song but I like it!

**radiofan15** (8.5): This is... definitely a Lana del Rey single...

**twat\_brained** (8.5): The bridge leaves something to be desired, but it's a beautiful Lana song, and just hearing this makes me look forward to Norman Fucking Rockwell, I hope there are songs like this on that album. Mariners Apartment Complex seems to already be one, thankfully

**camerinian** (8): I didn't do the rate this was originally in entirely because I could not get through Lana's tar pit of an album, but at least easily the best song from it is here

**enecks** (8): Lana the romantic is infinitely more interesting and enjoyable than Lana the tragic.

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's pretty but it drags a bit for me

**frogaranaman** (6): It’s cute.

**Roxieloxie** (6): this sounds to similar to young and beautiful for me

**TragicKingdom1** (6): the way she pronounces "coffee SHAWP" should make this a zero but i will ignore it and give a fair score

**wtferrothorn** (5): This is a Lana Del Rey song, alright

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.7): id rather be young and single

**xxrandooxx** (4): Lana Del Rey is my melatonin

**RVA\_101** (3.1): Del Rey strikes again with her moody, sultry, ever so slow moving songs. Good remedy for the most stubborn insomniac.

**CactusWithinUs** (3): Lana has never really been interesting enough for her slower songs to not be drawn-out and exhausting for me

**ggodisawomann** (1): I hate Lana's music except Summertime Sadness, this is a no, no sabotage here

New Rules finished third in the Pop Girl Prophecy rate with an 8.6990 average. This song really needs little introduction to popheads as a whole, considering it was one of the biggest radio songs of 2018 and one of popheads’ biggest stan songs. Catchy chorus, fun beat and melody, and just a clever song overall, but it’s definitely overexposed to a degree.

---
**1313Harbor** (10): I will stan forever

**1998tweety** (10): The beat drop feels like going over a speed bump, it still bops though.

**Brandon6099** (10): I'VE GOT NEW RULES I COUNT 'EM, Who knew that this song was so big, absolute jam for the summer it came out

**ggodisawomann** (10): ended men

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Very iconic

**itsabop** (10): Should've peaked in the Hot 100 Top 5!

**J\_Toe** (10): my brothers don't like listening to pop music, but accept me sending them dua lipa memes

**ryjomom** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, and give birth to it

**strawberryswing1** (10): :parrotcop: :parrotcop: :parrotcop:

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): we stan an albanian queen

**twat\_brained** (10): Is it Dua Lipa's best song? I wouldn't say so. Is it the best song of 2017? In popheads' eyes it is, and I'm not about to disagree. I've loved it since I heard it, I loved the video, I loved hearing Dua close with it when I saw her live over a year ago now, I just love this song and I love Dua. I'm proud to stan her.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This track has grown on me a lot since I first heard it. Dua's vocals work well with the song, and the production manages to be punchy yet brooding.

**radiofan15** (9.5): I can feel the lack of stage presence lurking in her vocals but i'm not going to deny this is a BOP

**nooodisaster** (9.2): Lyrically, vocally, productionally (sp?) this song is a modern classic. For as long as you can't dance, we will never forget your rules, Dua.

**Arybeck67** (9): The real 123 LETS GO BITCH (and this is coming from a hardcore Swiftie too lol)

**Roxieloxie** (9): it's overplayed but its still a good song

**tapdancingpig** (9): Okay this grew on me. Emily Warren deserves the world

**wtferrothorn** (9): the production is so flawless and colorful, it's hard not to love

**notdallin** (8.8): basically the only nostalgic thing about summer 2017. Who didn’t get pumped at the gym to the exacting and meticulous sonics and lyrics? Who wasn’t charmed by the music video that made us all google what hotel Dua filmed it in?

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.7): excellent tutorial

**camerinian** (8.5): I really wish that drop wasn’t so lousy, otherwise this could easily be top 10 pop songs of the decade material

**enecks** (8): I added together all the audible ones in the intro to get my score - and this adds up. Dua Lipa is a talent, and though this isn't her at her rock-infused best, this is undoubtedly an iconic bop.

**kappyko** (8): "New Rules" was /r/popheads song of the year 2017 for plenty of reasons. The slightly hip production, embracing the dynamics of the clever and cute narrative style. The video, making the most of its budget with well choreographed girl power fair. The soulful voice of Dua Lipa serving it right. I loved it too, but time can really take its toll once this became an actual hit. Here's to her next album being a bit more successful.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): i can’t believe popheads was boring enough to name THIS our top track of 2017

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): 1) Don’t pick up the phone, I’m alone 2) Don’t let people in 3) Don’t be anyone’s friends - I got new rules I’m crying

**plastichaxan** (7.5): What is the opposite of a grower? Don't get me wrong I still like it but I used to think this was excellent.

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): Meh? I don't see it for me, beat is catchy and the lyrics are alright, but something just doesn't click with me

**lilguavachan** (6.5): like it's an okay song but i've heard it 7 quadrillion times at this point so i'm tired of it

**ManofOranges** (6.5): My feelings with this song have changed so much over time. I used to dislike it and then I grew to like it and now I dislike it again for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): the drop is still doodoo!

**lilacsweetener** (5): I literally considered this filler and was surprised to see it even get a video so...oops...

**frogaranaman** (4): While the music video elevates this song to different heights, the song itself is really grating and tends to get annoying after a listen or two. Something about the lifeless, metallic production combined with Dua’s vocal annunciation just makes this song not for me.

**vhqv1997** (4): This is literally another mediocre pop songs being so memed into popularity that everyone has to pretend that it is good

**RVA\_101** (3.3): One of the songs whose popularity seemed to be amplified a lot more on this sub than it played out in real life. Probably for the best.

**selegend** (3): don’t be his friend you know you’ll only wake up in his bed in the morning
