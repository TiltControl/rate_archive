The 2010s Country Classics Rate, Day 3: The Story of Us Watching Taylor Lose Again
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/dnw6t7/the_2010s_country_classics_rate_day_3_the_story/

Welcome to the second day of the 2010s Country Classics rate starring Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, and Miranda Lambert! 

Yesterday we decided Miranda had too much baggage left, so we cut her off and now Taylor is the fastest girl in town. It is 4 v 9 v 2 going into the top 15!

--- 

Before we begin, here are some fun things to note: 

I had **46** beautiful popheads participate in this rate, meaning we will see a $30 donation to charity, and a nitro giveaway today!

The average score was **7.494**, a pretty skinny average if you ask me. 

The average controversy score is **1.874**, anything over this should be considered a controversial placement! 

--- 

We will begin at 2pm EST in this thread, as well as in the **[plug!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)** Join us for some country songs, some shitposts, and some other assorted bops! 

Also, I have a big homemade shitpost I'm showing today that took too long for me to make.

Well, she finally did it, and wow, what a trip. 

There were only ever two songs competing for the top spot, and both spent almost equal time on top, with Blown Away having the most dominant lead due to a middle of the month ballot from /u/MrSwearword, and some subsequent 7s and 8s gave Blown Away a 15-18 point lead at one point. 

In the last 6 ballots there were 5 more 11s for Enchanted, and the second to last ballot gave Blown Away a 5. The point difference after that ballot was 409.5 vs 409.8. The last ballot? An 11 for Enchanted, a 10 for Blown Away. It was a crazy wild ride, and definitely hard fought. Congrats to Taylor for her very first rate win, with a 6 minute ballad. Seems fitting, right? 

---

**1998tweety** (11): One of her bests songs periodt no discussion. I love love love when the first chorus is lowkey and subdued, it makes the second upbeat chorus have a much larger impact. The bridge and buildup to the last chorus are incredible.

**agentofscranton** (11): I legitimately tear up every time I hear this song, I go back and forth a lot on what I think is the best song in Taylor's discography is, but I always end up coming back to Enchanted.

**Damoojo** (11): Such a beautiful song. I was really shocked when I found out she wrote it about Adam Young lmao.

**hikkaru** (11): the build and swell of this song... iconic

**Memph5** (11): I really love this song and have too much to say to fit into a comment so I'll just post the link to a review I made a wrote a couple months ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/cq0q0d/my_reviewanalysis_of_enchanted/

**moooo566** (11): I've flip flopped on where my 11 goes like five times during this album but this song manages to be so beautiful and so huge at the same time and its amazing

**paper\_books** (11): I keep switching my eleven between Dear John, Enchanted, and Last Kiss but I think this has finally gotten it. The chorus is just so beautiful

**poppinmolly** (11): this is among her best songs. So, so good. Whimsical, captures a mood, just beautiful.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): this song is so atmospheric and magical <3

**Sopejoonkook** (11): I could listen to just the bridge of this song on repeat all day. PLEASE DON'T BE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE. PLEASE DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY WAITING ON YOUUUUU.

**CarlieScion** (10): you would not believe your eyes if 10 million fireflies :kimbryell:

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): The lyrics in this song are great and their ability to tell a story in 6 minutes is incredible. Taylor's voice and the production really shine on this song, especially in the chorus!

**radiofan15** (9.5): This should have been the title track!

**synthpopprince** (9.5): What else needs to be said about this song? Breathtaking.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): the atmosphere JUMPED and she didnt even need to resort to a vocoder to achieve it, new taylor take notes

**vhqv1997** (9): Still trying to forget that cover Owl City did. I love the guy, but, come on man.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song is a real slow-burn, it takes a while to rev up but it ends strong. It takes a bit too long for my tastes though.

**waluigiest** (7): the verses are beautifully written and performed, but I think the loud chorus is kind of bland and detracts from the atmosphere she set up

**vayyiqra** (6): it's nice but why does this album have so many long songs? i can fw longer tracks (unlike much of popheads i have something called an attention span) but this album is so gd long and it's nearly 4 in the morning as i try to finish the rate

**NotWith10000Men** (5): it's fine i guess

**MrSwearword** (1): I just flat out don't like this

The vocal power train that almost could. 

The single here was poised to take the crown for most of the back half of the rate, especially after /u/MrSwearword’s ballot, until its .3 point lead got overtaken with the final ballot. 

Robbed? A bit. 

Legendaric? 100%

Now all of you better support her in All Stars. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Blown away by Carrie’s vocals. But honestly this such a good song and is a perfect pop country song.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): fuck men

**MrSwearword** (11): I'm not an idiot. A song this stellar deserves nothing less than full marks.

**radiofan15** (11): Miss Underwood came into my house and say ''fuck the other bitches and fuck your wig, that bitch is mine now''

**skargardin** (11): This song has grown on me like hell over the past month. When I first heard it I really didn't think much of it but slowly it crept into my mind and then I saw it for the perfection that it is.

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): #menareoverparty [3]

**1998tweety** (10): Naps told me to give this a 10 so I did for him, but after listening to this song I can say it still deserves that 10. Tbh this would be a very deserving rate winner.

**paper\_books** (10): oops I already used a ten I really really like this song it's just so good and the imageryyyyyyyyyyyyyy

**synthpopprince** (10): We love a Grammy-winning, career-defining murder ballad. Another example of her sheer vocal power.

**vhqv1997** (10): The name of this song perfectly describes what Carrie's godly vocals did to my wig

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): catchy, well written song with a haunting atmosphere

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma to wash the sins out of that house… but there is enough to snatch my wig! I didn’t expect this kind of emo country from Carrie, I’m literally blown away. My only complaint is that I wish the vocals on the bridge were more different, Carrie’s voice lacks heaviness but it really would have taken this song to another level.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the piano adds so much to this song. incredible choice

**Sopejoonkook** (9): Every review I write on this album is just going to be about how amazing Carrie's voice is. It's amazing.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): This gets my zero because Carrie is CANCELLED for being insensitive to people who tragically lose their homes in natural disasters. /s

**waluigiest** (9): the chorus is powerful. Such a good moment in country music history

**poppinmolly** (8): good but I don't think it is AS good as everyone says

**vayyiqra** (8): i was prepared to hate every song in this rate but this song was edgy and unique enough to say surrender dorothy

**CarlieScion** (7): those vocals yas

**Memph5** (7): best song on the album

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): I’m sorry I find this song so boring I’ve never understood the hype

The longest song on the album making it into Day 3? We HAVE to stan. 

The lyricism here is definitely a magnum opus of her career, and is on par or better than All Too Well, and I think it is best seen in her bridge for one small decision: avoiding rhyming on the last couplet at the end. 

“So I’ll watch you life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep / and I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe / and I’ll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you ARE” 

Instead of finishing with the similar rhyme scheme, and singing ‘you’ve been’, to rhyme with friends, she decides to go with ARE. It’s jarring, unexpected, and shows that she is still out of place without him. Ugh, gorgeous. 

---

**synthpopprince** (11): Her best break-up song ever. A single lyric from this song has the power to emotionally destroy me. Her vivid songwriting at it's best. All Too Well who??

**vhqv1997** (11): Okay hot take: this song, in my opinion, is better than All Too Well. The way I see it, both songs are lyrical masterpieces with layers upon layers of complex story and poetic lines about her relationship from its starting to ending point, which can leave anybody with half a heart emotionally devastated even if they haven't experienced any kind of relationship similar to the ones she's describing. However, Taylor's vocal delivery in Last Kiss is far superior, it's haunting, it's gut-wrenching, it's much more devastating than All Too Well. I'm not saying her delivery in All Too Well is weak, I'm saying it's amazing but not as good as Last Kiss. Everytime I hear her voice quivers in the bridge, I automatically cry. There's a reason she doesn't like to perform this song, yet performs All Too Well like every chance she could to get her fans rabid. This song is an achievement, a testament to her artistry, her true peak, and I would literally commit mass genocide if you guys let this song flop in the rate.

**1998tweety** (10): Love this song. It's meant to be a slow sad ballad and Taylor keeps it at that. Doing anything more would take away from the song, she plays it perfectly. The lyrics are the standout here and they work really well.

**CarlieScion** (10): all too well 0.9

**paper\_books** (10): AND I'LL KEEP UP WITH OUR OLD FRIENDS JUST TO ASK THEM HOW YOU ARE HOPE IT'S NICE WHERE YOU ARE

**poppinmolly** (10): I once remembered a dentist appointment solely because it fell on July 9th, which is obviously "Last Kiss" day!!

**Memph5** (8.5): I'm not someone who cries to songs easily and this one's done it for me multiple times. "So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep and I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe." Tragic.

**radiofan15** (8.3): This is too cute and serene for words...

**waluigiest** (8): love is temporary and I am sad. She has a talent for communicating strong, vulnerable, romantic emotions

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): There’s a lot of times that I’ll really relate to Taylor Swift songs but I really think not being a WASPy girl has held me back from liking this song. It sounds pretty I guess but again, too long. There’s nothing wrong with a long song but these songs seem long more for her sake than for ours, if that makes sense. Like she wants to keep repeating herself whether or not it’ll make sense to the listener.

**vayyiqra** (6): :pensive: [2]

**MrSwearword** (5): boring and I couldn't get myself invested in this

**Sopejoonkook** (5): It's boring. There is a middle part in there where I start getting into it but then it goes back to being boring. It's a skip for me.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

**NotWith10000Men** (3): i need more going on, her voice is NOT enough

A major fan favorite for Swifties, and acknowledged by Swift herself, it was interpolated into a performance of New Year’s Day during the reputation stadium tour, and damn is it fitting and gorgeous. I’m upset it didn’t make it to the top 10, but we will always remember her legacy. 

---

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Long live is a really good, climactic song on this album. Also, the piano version of this Taylor did on the reputation tour mixed with New Year's Day is on of my favorite things Taylor has ever done.

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): long live walked so that next level charli could run

**1998tweety** (10): A GOOD closer to the album, finishing it off on a high note. I love when Taylor does the first chorus and then the later choruses are twice the length (same thing on Enchanted). It makes the buildup stronger.

**CarlieScion** (10): this song makes me wanna sob

**hikkaru** (10): one of the best songs to scream... I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE FIGHTING DRAGONS WITH YOU

**rickikardashian** (10): This is an amazing song overall, but it gets elected to a 100 after the bridge

**synthpopprince** (9.5): Just when you think you've survived past Lass Kiss she hits you in the feelings with another smash. Her songwriting on this album is just incredible. I miss this Taylor.

**poppinmolly** (9): this album came out my senior year of high school so I remember thinking this song was so appropriate!

**Sopejoonkook** (9): I'll fight dragons with you all day Taylor.

**paper\_books** (8.6): I do like the song a lot, but it starts to drag a little at the end. Still such a bop

**Memph5** (8.5): I'm not sure how this song would stand on its own as well but in that moment of her career and as the closer for the Speak Now tour, it it's an ANTHEM. She also does that thing she likes to do (see also Love Story, Mine and Enchanted) where she doubles up the the chorus for the second go-around so that it goes off that much harder. And then there's that "I'm not finished" moment with the bridge, and the tweaks to the vocal melody on the closing chorus to elevate the song that much higher.

**vhqv1997** (8): This song has a lot of interesting production choices but also some of the weirdest production I have ever heard. Taylor, if you do re-record your catalog, please re-record this song too and update it.

**waluigiest** (8): celebrating a era this is glorious

**radiofan15** (7.6): Cute little song... but why is this over 5 minutes long?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Oh wow I’m really noticing Taylor’s “country accent” on this song. I really like the guitar on this song and the melody/chorus are great, but the story she’s telling is really uninteresting. Also, the song is too long again! It stops and starts up again like four times towards the end, it’s okay Taylor, you can just finish a song.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): just doesn't do a whole lot for me

**vayyiqra** (5): i don't even know anymore ok i'm so tired i've been rating country songs for three hours now they're all blending together i just want to go to bed

**MrSwearword** (3): rather unpleasant dreck

NEXT CHAPTER and THE END are iconic pieces of Taylor’s lyrics, and my sister and I will scream these at each other randomly out of nowhere just because we first became major Taylor fans during Speak Now and this quickly became one of our favorite songs. 

---

**CarlieScion** (10): NEXT CHAPTER!!!!!

**Damoojo** (10): The End!

**hikkaru** (10): taylor make a full on pop rock album challenge

**synthpopprince** (10): My personal favorite from Speak Now, and one of the best example of how Swift can take a singular experience that we've all been through (running into that ex you've still got feeling for) and turn into the perfect relatable bop.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): probably the most pop/rock taylor has ever gone and it works very very well!

**vhqv1997** (10): My sister and her ex once sat back-to-back in a restaurant once with neither of them wanting to acknowledge each other, and later when we got home, I put this song on repeat and forced her to listen to it.

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): catty at times but i still love it.

**1998tweety** (9): The transition from the second verse into the chorus, yep that's the moment. It took me a second to switch on this song, but I'm glad I did cause it's GOOD

**paper\_books** (8.4): I used to love this so much omg

**Memph5** (8): BOP. The drums give the song so much energy. Favorite lyric: "but you held your pride like you should've held me".

**waluigiest** (8): Love how real all of this is she really nails the sentiment. I don’t care for the orchestration, it’s a little too Disney for me

**radiofan15** (7.4): THE END.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the girl can write a chorus. damn

**Sopejoonkook** (7): I don’t really have anything to say but it's a fun catchy song and I enjoy it.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): The most filler song on this album so far

**MrSwearword** (6): the verses are far better written than the chorus but even then, I can do without this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): That spunky little “the end” at the end of the song is cute but I have no idea what this song sounds like, it’s just a wall of noise.

**vayyiqra** (4): faux edgy

**gannade** (1): sounds like its from demis sophomore album but offkey

And the first of Carrie’s remaining songs are out here. 

Receiving no 11s, Good Girl coasted into the top 15 with the fact that it is fairly universally enjoyed, especially as an album opener. It just works, it’s upbeat, lyrically very on point for Carrie, and also a great showcase of her vocal ability.

---

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): carrie said when she sees a m*n she floors it

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): By one minute into this song I was ready to burn this guy’s house down, Idk who he is or what he did but he’s dead to me. I’m gonna become one of those people on /r/relationshipadvice who just always advises people to dump their significant others. He’s no good for you.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck men

**moooo566** (10): holy hell what a banger of an opener

**1998tweety** (9.5): Oh WOW I was not expecting to start the album with a bop like this.

**radiofan15** (9.5): She's serving vocals but the song is not that far behind

**synthpopprince** (9.5): A mega bop and a perfect first single choice. Her vocals on the bridge slay me every time.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Definitely a country bop

**rickikardashian** (9): This song is perfectly impregnated in my head because of Just Dance. Time has passed and I still know not only every word, but the choreo perfectly. As soon as it started I was 14 again in my old house playing with my Wii on my living room

**agentofscranton** (8.5): i love this, i get the feeling that there are probably tonnes of thinkpieces that claim this song is problematic

**hikkaru** (8.5): i love when country leans into rockier territory like this. bop!

**paper\_books** (8.1): One of the better songs on the album, I remember being twelve and thinking that the good girl was only a good girl if she had her goodbye shoes on I was not the smartest child

**CarlieScion** (8): love me some rock-country

**poppinmolly** (8): a bop but...this is just discount Cowboy Casanova and that's the tea.

**Sopejoonkook** (8): Carrie's voice is so powerful the country rock vibe suits her.

**waluigiest** (8): I’m a simple man. I like how she says “good girl” to refer to the subject of the song but also to say this man is “no good, girl”

**vayyiqra** (6): i hate that i am kind of bopping to a country-rock song yet here we are

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): eh this one is so overplayed

**harsh-femme** (4): it feels like a Cowboy Casanova redo to me.

**MrSwearword** (1): Carrie is a very gifted vocalist but the title of the song is just really shitty and the intent of "stay away from that motherfucker" is buried under calling the person a "good girl".

Another Taylor single departs us just short of the top 10. This may be one of her best singles lyrically and its instrumentation is great, but her lack of vocal power is kinda evident here, and her held notes just feel a little… underwhelming. I still gave it a 10 tho :kisskiss:

---

**CarlieScion** (11): the bridge in this is so good. i cant believe this was originally written for fearless but im so glad she recorded it when it became a fan favorite as a live track

**1998tweety** (10): Big big bop, sounds like one of those songs that's 10x better live.

**Memph5** (10): I wanted to give this song an 11 so much (after Enchanted) that I reduced my score for all the other songs by one. Ten reasons why this deserves a 10/10 (in no particular order). 1) "The way you move is a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards" 2) The drums are awesome and moving to them is about as irresistible as whoever the song is about. 3) That guitar riff at the start that plays through a good chunk of the song. 4) The way all the instruments drop out at the start of the chorus and the vocals are doubled to give "drop everything now" that much more urgency. 5) The vocals/melodies evoke so much wistful yearning. 6) The little vocal inflections (ex on "kinda know that I won't get far"). 7) The way the song strips back at the end of the bridge. 8) The angelic backing vocals as the last chorus starts to pick up again.

**paper\_books** (10): one of my favourites from the album, the chorus is so uplifting and happy :DD

**rickikardashian** (10): hello, this song is about sex, goodbye

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the chorus S L A P S

**Sopejoonkook** (8): Taylor has always been amazing at capturing the first moments of a relationship

**synthpopprince** (8): Her energy here is infectious, you can practically hear the smile on her face as she sings.

**vhqv1997** (8): For some weird reason I have always thought this song was on Fearless despie the fact I listen to Speak Now pretty regularly, which means I get surprised by its inclusion here every single time I listen to this album. The reason is that I always associate this song as a companion to Fearless, the song, which means Taylor kinda wrote the same song two times, but we have always known that she can do that since All You Had To Do Was Stay and I Wish You Would exist, literally on the same album.

**waluigiest** (8): a fantastic look into teenage perspectives on romance..... balances naivety and horniness well

**radiofan15** (6.9): Sparks algo gets lost in the dust Tay Tay... just like my interest in this song...

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It’s fine but a little basic? Maybe it’s just the age of the song but it felt very formulaic in terms of the writing/production. Miranda Cosgrove did it better.

**vayyiqra** (6): An electric spark is an abrupt electrical discharge that occurs when a sufficiently high electric field creates an ionized, electrically conductive channel through a normally-insulating medium, often air or other gases or gas mixtures. Michael Faraday described this phenomenon as "the beautiful flash of light attending the discharge of common electricity". The rapid transition from a non-conducting to a conductive state produces a brief emission of light and a sharp crack or snapping sound. A spark is created when the applied electric field exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the intervening medium. For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level. Experimentally, this figure tends to differ depending upon humidity, atmospheric pressure, shape of electrodes (needle and ground-plane, hemispherical etc.) and the corresponding spacing between them and even the type of waveform, whether sinusoidal or cosine-rectangular. At the beginning stages, free electrons in the gap (from cosmic rays or background radiation) are accelerated by the electrical field. As they collide with air molecules, they create additional ions and newly freed electrons which are also accelerated. At some point, thermal energy will provide a much greater source of ions. The exponentially-increasing electrons and ions rapidly cause regions of the air in the gap to become electrically conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown. Once the gap breaks down, current flow is limited by the available charge (for an electrostatic discharge) or by the impedance of the external power supply. If the power supply continues to supply current, the spark will evolve into a continuous discharge called an electric arc. An electric spark can also occur within insulating liquids or solids, but with different breakdown mechanisms from sparks in gases.

**gannade** (1): this feels like the dollar store version of Fearless. also miranda cosgrove did it better

This may be the biggest shock for me in this rate, the fact that this is the third Carrie single in the top 10, and that it shut out Good Girl. See You Again seemed to be pretty safe for Carrie, and doesn’t have her famous story telling lyrics that seem to garner her the most success. 

Color me shocked, but it is a VERY welcome addition to the top 10, and unfortunately she departs immediately, but it was nice while it lasted. 

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I’m crying, I’m throwing my lighter up to the sky, I’m shaking my head and my ass. This took me to church, I live for these kind of cheesy, string heavy inspirational songs. It’s like the best parts of Christian music but they don’t keep mentioning God every five seconds.

**CarlieScion** (10): this is so pretty. the piano! her vocals!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Cherish your friends and family

**moooo566** (10): way better than that other see you again song i will fite u about that

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): this song has a special place in my heart (and almost got my eleven) <3

**/u/lilguavachan** (9.5): when i read up that this song was supposed to be in a movie, it made so much sense. also it outsold that abomination by that little whiny shit with the fucked up eyebrow.

**1998tweety** (9): The "oh-oh"s kind of dragged it down for me a bit. Everything else is a 10 though.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): i love how it builds at the end of the verses. the melody of the whole song sounds so different

**poppinmolly** (8.5): cute! really serving vocals here

**paper\_books** (8): These first four songs on the album all have a really special place in my heart :')

**rickikardashian** (8): I really didn't want to make this references but I just have to….. THE LAST TIME I FREAKED OUT, I JUST KEPT LOOKING DOWN, I STUTTERED WHEN YOU ASKED ME WHAT IM THINKING BOUT

**Sopejoonkook** (8): Her voice makes every song great.

**radiofan15** (7.9): Can the millenial whoop die? like please?!?

**MrSwearword** (7): energetic but I don't care about it much beyond that

**waluigiest** (7): …Miley?

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): It’s fine but kind of substance-less and too simple

**gannade** (5.5): carrie is easily the most talented vocalist in this rate but sometimes i dont think she knows how to tone it down

**synthpopprince** (5): Hint, If a song is rejected from The Chronicles of Narnia soundtrack it's probably not good enough for your album. Still mad this was the final single, way too sappy for my taste.

A massive bop, and was en route to sit pretty in the top 5 for its entire run, but the 20th ballot shot it down and it had a very slow climb back up into the top 10. 

---

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): fuck John

**rickikardashian** (11): I'm aware that the 11 magnets from this album will be Enchanted and Back to December, but I couldn't not give my 11 to this song. It's one of her most sincere and heartfelt songs, and I'd would argue this is on the same level than All Too Well in every aspect. I will straight up fight anyone that doesn't recognize this song as a glorious masterpiece, and I will delete this entire sub if it doesn't make it to at least Day 3

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): imagine dating someone as ugly as john mayer... to be young and dumb

**1998tweety** (10): Wow. This is that songs, especially one of her bests ever. The lyrics on this (especially the bridge) are so so good. If it weren't for Enchanted this would definitely be my 11.

**paper\_books** (10): This literally has such good lyrics like WHAT HOW IS THE BRIDGE SO GOOD

**poppinmolly** (10): an 11 contender, truly. Some of her best song writing is in this song right here.

**waluigiest** (10): oh my GOD this is nuts. She straight up puts his name in the title and says “I would never disclose who my songs are about” she’s a wild snake and I adore her for it. Also the writing and performance are beautiful too this is the whole package

**vhqv1997** (9.5): Okay John Mayer is a douche who somehow still refers to himself as "a boy" despite being 40 years old, but this song kinda paints him as an insane sociopath, which I guess is kinda rude, but I don't know how their relationship actually was, so I won't really go there. Let's just pretend John here is the same random Johnny dude St. Vincent sings about, then, well, okay this song is goddamn savage and I love it. The entire energy of this song is basically just that bridge and ending chorus of White Horse but amplified, and the bridge here is very brutal too. I love when Taylor used to be this heartless, despite the fact it's kinda problematic. Nowadays, her diss songs have no bite to them.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Ended John Mayer

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I mean, I'd totally let myself get fucked by John Mayer too tbh.

**synthpopprince** (9): Has John Mayer ever recovered from this??? ICONIC!

**CarlieScion** (8): all too well 0.5

**Memph5** (8): I'm supposed to feel sorry for that bitch? I don't! Skulldrag him! The verses have some of her most poetic lyrics. A fun song to sing to super-dramatically, and the songs climax in the bridge is one of the most satisfying in her discography. "And you'll add my list to the long list of traitors who don't understand" nails it and makes me feel like she was definitely listening to "Slow Dancing In A Burning Room" when she wrote this (btw, easily my favorite John Mayer song). It really feels like some twisted caricature of a John Mayer song at times.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i don't think i've ever heard this one before and i really like it!!! she really can write

**Sopejoonkook** (7): Dear John walked so All Too Well could fly.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Probably her most melodramatic song. This is not a bad thing

**MrSwearword** (6): wow an effective telloff of John Mayer that has nothing to do with Katy Perry and anything released from 2015 to 2017! What docks this to hell is that it's SIX ALMOST SEVEN MINUTES LONG, EVEN LANA DEL REY CAN SHOW RESTRAINT MOST OF THE TIME.

**vayyiqra** (6): more background music for the tv guide channel

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I looked it up and apparently John Mayer was like, in his thirties when he was dating a nineteen year old Taylor Swift. He creeps me out, roast his ass Taylor, you were definitely too young and he definitely should have known. That said, this song is low-key plodding it did NOT need to be seven minutes long.

I was SHOCKED that this song wasn’t a top contender, but after 10 ballots it left the top 5 and never returned :/

**vayyiqra** (7): good another nice ballad to make up for the awful track before this

**letsallpoo** (6): erm why do people like this so much

**MrSwearword** (3): some of the lyrics feel very underwritten and it's just a sadder but original version of Last Christmas or some weirdly depressing shit around December.

One of the absolute best Taylor songs in this rate and y’all did it dirty!!!! I’m ashamed. 

---

**/u/lilguavachan** (11): it's so deliciously overdramatic, how could i not give it an 11

**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): Possibly my favorite Taylor song ever. It's just epic and cinematic, both sonically and lyrically

**1998tweety** (10): I would not be disappointed if this song pulled a surprise victory. The production on this is so so good, and Taylor kind of serves great vocals? Taylor really needs to go back to this pop-rock sounds especially now that her vocals have gotten better, I'd love to see it.

**CarlieScion** (10): emo bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): that bridge UGH legendaric

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This may be her most underrated song? This should have been bigger

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): oh my god this is amazing??

**paper\_books** (8.7): Haunted walked so Wildest Dreams could run.

**Memph5** (8.5): I love the way the drums kick the song off, the dramatic vibe the song as, and the panting sounds during "whooaa I'm holding my breath", and the tormenting sounding voices towards the end of the song (the "I know, I know, I know"s). The tour version with the guitar intro that gives me Metallica vibes, the bells and all the dramatic choreo and visuals would get a +1.0 from me.

**synthpopprince** (8.5): I have a soft spot for pop/rock Taylor and I think Haunted paved the way for some of the most revered tracks on RED.

**radiofan15** (8.4): Evanescence and Queen B outsold but this is cute too.

**Sopejoonkook** (8): I don't know instruments but whatever is playing at the beginning of the song I love.

**waluigiest** (8): I’m so shook at this vaguely punk/emo rock sound! This wouldn’t sound out of place on an Evanescence record.

**gannade** (6): this instrumental is amazing, finally some drama in this album. feels a bit like panic in the disco

**MrSwearword** (6): this song is haunted by a presence of barely above par ghosts

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This song is loud but it doesn’t know why.

**vayyiqra** (5): what evanescence song is this

And Taylor’s chances at sweeping the podium are officially gone. 

My hot take is that this is a bottom three lead single for her. 

Also, fun fact: This song is a response to her parents’ divorce, something I didn’t know about until a couple of years ago. 


---

**sailormunelune** (11): so good

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): honestly. truly. iconic.

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, I surprised this didn't do super well on the charts, I guess it was too pop and not country enough at the time. I feel like Mine gets forgotten among Taylor's other singles but it's still one of my faves.

**agentofscranton** (10): 'you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter' is such a moment

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This one probably the first Taylor song I really liked. It’s cute and I think it still holds up well.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Her best lead single period. Love Story is a very close second but legit all her others (aside from Tim McGraw) have been absolute trash. This is not an opinion, its a fact.

**MrSwearword** (10): quality Taylor Swift music...nice to hear you again.

**radiofan15** (9.5): We love songs about Cory Monteith... also we miss Cory Monteith.

**CarlieScion** (9): you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter,,, iconique

**paper\_books** (9): this is such a great song :comfy:

**Sopejoonkook** (9): it's like love story but better.

**waluigiest** (9): A song that made me believe in love. I cannot believe she did this.

**vhqv1997** (8.5): Mine was the last time Taylor actively chose a decent song as a lead single, please don't pay this song dust if you want her to stop putting out shits like ME! just to bait public attention and also massive eye-rolls.

**Memph5** (8): That line everybody's going to mention is great but "I was a flight risk with a fear of falling" is even better. Also it feels like she's randomly channeling Def Leppard's Hysteria on the bridge? Anyways, this song goes off, great power pop song.

**synthpopprince** (8): The amount of detail she packs into this song is mind-blowing.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Oh boy, this song takes me back to hearing it on the radio and not liking it that much. That was during my “I hate pop” phase but even now that I’m older and more sophisticated I still am not crazy about this song. It’s kind of like, too peppy and too much screaming for my tastes.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): overplayed but it's undeniably a bop

**vayyiqra** (6): background music for the tv guide channel

PRAISE JESUS

But like seriously, this song is one of the best vocal performances I’ve heard in a song this decade. I’ve said it before and I’ve probably said it a lot this rate, but DAMN Carrie’s vocals have only gotten better as her career has progressed, something you can’t say about other massive vocalists like Mariah, Florence, or Kelly. The only other vocalist that comes to mind that is similar in improvement is Gaga honestly. 

---

**radiofan15** (10): VOCALS! OMG! FUCKING VOCALS!

**Sopejoonkook** (10): One of my favorite Carrie songs ever. It feels genuine coming from someone who has been outspoken about her faith and actually seems like she tries to live it out. Her voice is amazing. I love the Gospel choir coming in with Amazing Grace. And then ending with Carrie singing Amazing Grace by herself gives me chills. It's a beautiful testament to her faith.

**vhqv1997** (10): Carrie singing Amazing Grace should be a full song

**paper\_books** (8.9): the chorus feels so big and huge - I mean all Carrie Underwood songs have huge choruses but this one especially for some reason

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I love the video but I’m more of a godless kind of guy. The song is great though, I’m glad she’s having a good time. I love the inspirational aesthetics of Christian music I just wish they didn’t come with, you know, the rest of it.

**synthpopprince** (8): Not a personal favorite but I think it's a perfect Carrie Underwood song, if that makes sense. I get goosebumps at the end when she transitions into Amazing Grace and lets her voice rip.

**vayyiqra** (6): environmental contaminants in the water supply are no joke

**moooo566** (10): this was my first favourite pop song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): one of my favorite songs of all time. i think it's the melody that does it for me and the way she goes up and down on the last word of the lines in the verses

**rickikardashian** (10): around this time the teen girlies had an obsession with having songs related to December. We are all goes for Christmas time ig

**vhqv1997** (10): Taylor's vocal delivery during these early eras can... vary wildly, but at least this song is proof that she can always deliver an emotional soft song.

**waluigiest** (10): with that first echoey guitar strum I feel like I exit my body. I look back on this song and really this whole album and wonder how she was able to live an entire layered life and write nuanced songs about them before being legally able to drink. Taylor Swift is nuts.

**paper\_books** (9.9): I've heard people say that this is one of Taylor's most mature songs, and they're all right.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (9): Wish it was the accoustic one

**Sopejoonkook** (9): It's always a mistake to go back to old relationships but Taylor captures the temptation incredibly well.

**synthpopprince** (9): One of her most underrated singles ever.

Almost a top 3 song at one point. A couple of later ballots with some low scores kept her solid in the top 5, but just short of the top 3. 

As a result, we are now left with all three artists inside the top 3! Take your bets now!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck men

**MrSwearword** (10): Damn. An immersive and fucked story set to country music of all things. Werk.

And now, Carrie is left with the majority of songs, and Taylor is out of singles. It marked a change in theme for her, and the world was shocked. She is admitting she was wrong???? WOW!

---

**bbfan132** (11): ugh, perfection. possibly her best bridge ever.

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): did the acoustic version of this outsell? yes. is this still a great song? yes.

**1998tweety** (10): This song will always hold a special part in my heart cause it's the one that converted me to a big stan. I remember posting all the lyrics on my Facebook page (yes I posted the chorus several times too) and the next people asked me why I did that lmao. Yeah, I was that kid.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WE HAVE TO STAN VULNERABILITY

**moooo566** (10): this was my first favourite pop song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): one of my favorite songs of all time. i think it's the melody that does it for me and the way she goes up and down on the last word of the lines in the verses

**rickikardashian** (10): around this time the teen girlies had an obsession with having songs related to December. We are all goes for Christmas time ig

**vhqv1997** (10): Taylor's vocal delivery during these early eras can... vary wildly, but at least this song is proof that she can always deliver an emotional soft song.

**waluigiest** (10): with that first echoey guitar strum I feel like I exit my body. I look back on this song and really this whole album and wonder how she was able to live an entire layered life and write nuanced songs about them before being legally able to drink. Taylor Swift is nuts.

**paper\_books** (9.9): I've heard people say that this is one of Taylor's most mature songs, and they're all right.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (9): Wish it was the accoustic one

**Sopejoonkook** (9): It's always a mistake to go back to old relationships but Taylor captures the temptation incredibly well.

**synthpopprince** (9): One of her most underrated singles ever.

**Memph5** (8.5): The song that got me to check out Taylor's discography beyond the singles I enjoyed on radio. THISISMESWALLOWINGMYPRIDESTANDINGINFRONTOFYOUSAYINGI'MSORRYFORTHATNIGHT TURNSOUTFREEDOMAIN'TNOTHINGBUTMISSINGYOUWISHINGI'DREALIZEDWHATIHADWHENYOUWEREMINE

**CarlieScion** (8): 😔 the song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I remember this song being… softer? More maudlin? I thought this was gonna be an easy ten but listening to it now with headphones it doesn’t hit me like I thought it did, it’s kind of overproduced. The writing is strong though, great chorus.

**radiofan15** (7.2): It might be because English is my third language but what's with all of these pop girl songs using December as a metaphor for dark times in your relationships?

**vayyiqra** (7): december > october don't @ me

**TragicKingdom1** (6): i feel like i should like this a lot more but i find the melody really awkward for some reason

**MrSwearword** (5): mediocre but I think there's some emotive output that wouldn't hurt to see on future releases.

There's always a little hint of mysogynistic undertones in a couple of Miranda's biggest singles, and this one is definitely one of them, but I think that in itself is a recurring country thing, and not necessarily a Miranda thing.

As a side note, I am really surprised with how this song moved. 

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): The lyrics are definitely strong in this song, and Miranda Lambert's powerful and emotional vocals really add to them. The instrumentals also work well with her vocals, especially in the chorus. The demo of this is also really pretty and it's interesting to see how the song changed between then and the commercial release of the song.

**letsallpoo** (11): FUCK moms

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): was this the song she took from kacey musgraves?

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10, a MASSIVE bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Imagine if this was a lip sync song on RPDR, ugh can you say legendary?

**NotWith10000Men** (10): incredible song. miranda is the perfect artist to sing it. barflies and baptists lmao

**radiofan15** (10): Miss Musgraves did not come to play!

**Sopejoonkook** (10): Does anything really need to be said? Miranda at her best. I was very close to giving this my eleven.

**waluigiest** (10): the imagery here is stunning, and I love the rebellion. Country excellence

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a country wig snatcher. Ended her mother.

**synthpopprince** (9.5): The biggest bop from the album thanks to Kacey Musgrave's excellent songwriting. Even my friends who hate Country music love this song.

**gannade** (8.5): this is a bop but pretty overrated. far from the best on the album

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Kacey Fucking Musgraves.

**hikkaru** (8): kacey-penned bop!

**MrSwearword** (8): because of the energy and nothing else

**vhqv1997** (8): Dear Miranda's mama, she has already written at least 5 songs about murdering her ex at this point, you're late. Please do a better job.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the lyrics, they’re really silly and relatable, but musically it’s not my favorite.

---

**Overall Average**: 7.423 **// Average Controversy:** 1.760

---

**moooo566** (8.464): I know the other two albums really well but have never actually listened through this so I was expecting to be rating it lower but it's actually really great.

**radiofan15** (8.279): I can't believe Miranda of all people outsold Taylor and Carrie! [Score: B+]

**agentofscranton** (7.929): Before this rate I had literally never heard of Miranda Lambert, let alone listened to a Miranda Lambert song so colour me surprised to find that this album was actually really good! consider me a new Miranda fan!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.607): This was good, it started strong and finished strong but it kind of dragged in the middle. But I really loved those first few and last few tracks.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.500): Miranda is the most country artist in the rate and that's why she'll probably do the worst, but she really does not deserve it because this album is quite touching. It shows off pretty much every aspect of Miranda's personality, from the sassy to the heartfelt. The main problem with it is that a few tracks in the middle blend together but ultimately it is a quite enjoyable listen. [Grade: B+]

**synthpopprince** (7.357): Very possibly my least favorite Miranda album but it has it's moments. After three very successful, mostly self-written albums, she felt the need to bring in a lot of collaborators here. Maybe because of the success of 'The House That Built Me', a song she didn't write? Four The Record does not feel like one of her more personal albums but rather an album designed for success at Country radio, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it's not my favorite version of Miranda either.

**hikkaru** (6.607): This is the most country album in the rate and my scores suffered because of that... sorry that I'm a basic pop bitch.

**Memph5** (6.500): This album was a surprise, I never heard most of the songs before the rate but I actually like it quite a lot. Gives me vibes of like a really good Dixie Chicks record, but maybe even better? I'd give the songs higher numbers if it wasn't matched up against the songs of one of my favorite albums ever which I do still prefer that much more.

**vayyiqra** (5.143): Overall score: 5.1.

**yoereyesr** (4.036): I didn't like this one

**moooo566** (8.536): I feel like I'd be rating these higher if not for such tough competition

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.464): Carrie DUMPSTERED the other two albums, it isn’t even funny. The other two albums aren’t even bad but damn this album is fantastic, I’m gonna have to check out more of her stuff because I’m stanning this hard.

**radiofan15** (8.136): The mid-portion of this album DRAGS but the opening and ending portions compensates for it... also she's serving VOCALS in here [Score: B+]

**EricX** (7.214): Back in 2012-2013 i used to be a huge billboard fan and Country is not a thing in Latinoamerica. Songs like Dirt Road Anthem-You and Tequila-Are You Gonna Kiss Me Or Not-Remind Me were my first country songs = Classics, Carrie-Miranda discography is really good Omg. Not a bad song at all.

**hikkaru** (7.071): Carrie's voice is very powerful and a lot of these songs are very catchy and have good pop appeal, which appeals to me. I love her on the more rock-y songs!

**synthpopprince** (6.964): I think this album is remembered fondly because the singles were so strong, but there's a lot of filler going into the second half. It's definitely not my favorite Carrie album, but I love that she took some creative risks as they definitely paid off in the long run.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.429): The fact that this album opens with the first four singles in order of their release...really sums it up. Those four songs are some of Carrie's best songs of her career (well, not See You Again) but the rest is fairly disposable. [Grade: B-]

**gannade** (6.393): this entire album is so average

**vayyiqra** (4.786): i did not really like this album. it started a bit stronger than the first album in the rate but had a couple of really awful songs that dragged it down. overall score: 4.8

# Speak Now

/u/davidcelli was so nice to make a nice write up for speak now, so I included it below, and included links to his podcast, Pop Squared! Make sure to check him out and support this great pop podcast!

POP SQUARED


About Us: Hello! We are Pop Squared, a pop music podcast hosted by Zack & David. We’re two inexperienced gays with too many opinions, here to keep you up to date on the latest music news, albums, songs, & random ideas our gay mind’s dream up.
Today the Pop Squared team is here to reflect and discuss our opinions on Taylor Swift’s third studio album, Speak Now. Remember to check out & subscribe to our podcast, as well as stream Episode 3:” Speak Now. Period.”!


David: To me personally, this album is a time capsule. Taylor perfectly captured and represented a crucial period in her life in the most honest way. The main reason this album truly stands out from the pact is it’s lyricism, and how stunning it was for an 18/19 year old to be viewing and telling her life stories in such a magical way. As we all probably know at this point, Swift wrote the entirety of the album herself as well, which is almost unheard of in this day and age (speaking from a pop perspective, obviously with exceptions). On songs like Dear John & Enchanted is where (I believe) Swift truly shows her talent in writing and song structure. Both songs are packed with beautiful & somber verses, as well as bridges that will make your heart ache for days. I will admit my bias towards Taylor because I’ve been stanning this woman since 2006, however if you are someone who is on the fence about Taylor, I implore you to listen to Speak Now with an open mind and heart.


Zack: To me, I wouldn’t rank Speak Now as Taylor’s best album (sue me) but I feel like this is the moment that Taylor Swift truly arrived. The album is entirely written by herself and a lot of the material here truly shows how great of a writer she actually is. Being a songwriter isn’t everything in the pop music sphere, but Taylor’s writing is what makes her stand out amongst her peers. A song like Dear John is something that most artists dream about creating. This album is what made me into the Swiftie I am today. Not all of it has aged well (Better Than Revenge, although it still slaps tbh) I think Speak Now is the album I would force anyone to listen to if they want to fully understand Taylor Swift, the artist.

**1998tweety** (9.265): My favourite Taylor album! It was hard rating this cause I wanted to just give straight 10s to everything (and I know I kind of did lol), but decided to at least lower a few.

**moooo566** (9.235): This album changed my life and made me a better person. I was a proper "le wrong generation" kid (culture peaked with The Who for 12 year old me) and that feeling of superiority really impacted the way I acted. Then I heard a promo spot for Speak Now on the radio on the drive home from school and something clicked. I went home and binged Taylor's music and had this revelation that I could enjoy something just because I liked it rather than because enjoying it made me better than everyone else. Discovering that the "normies" were right all along ended up helping me realise that maybe they weren't so bad, and that differing tastes didn't mean I had to be an arsehole to them. As well as being less of a dickhead, being able to actually enjoy things has really helped me connect to people and enjoy the world a lot more. It's super silly but I do sometimes feel that a 30 second Taylor Swift advert is the thing that saved me from being a genuine piece of shit. This may not actually be her best album but it will always be special and important to me in a way no other piece of media will ever manage to be.

**paper\_books** (8.694): Literally the best Taylor album I love this so much

**rickikardashian** (8.559): Honestly I did this rate very scared of looking like just a blind Swifty that gave every song a 10 just so it could win, but I truly love this album so much and I think many of the songs in here are masterpieces. The transition from Fearless to Speak Now showed a lot of growth on Taylor as an artist, and although Speak Now is sandwiched in between of the more successful Fearless and Red, I think this is the moment that truly marked her as the huge force that she is nowadays.

**Damoojo** (8.559): One of my favorite albums by Taylor.

**hikkaru** (8.529): I definitely am a Taylor stan that stans her pop albums more than her earlier, more country work, but Speak Now's pop-rock influence is amazing and I would love for her to make an album with that style in the future.

**EricX** (8.294): Taylor is one of my favorite artists all time and some of her albums are my most played but i never checked Speak-Fearless-Debut can you believe that? Omg better than revenge? Taylor singing pop rock?

**Memph5** (8.059): Strong contender for my favorite album of all time

**synthpopprince** (7.706): Still in my Holy Trinity of Taylor albums (along with Red and 1989), Speak Now is when her songwriting genius really became apparent. I love that she didn't work with other co-writers. The songs on this album are sprawling, emotional confessions, and each feels like it serves a distinct purpose in the narrative of the album. She tried out a lot of sounds here, but what I think pulls it all together is the urgency with which she delivers her messages.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.306): This album was alright, I think the songwriting was generally solid but the production felt a little overcrowded and the songs were too long. Like, most of them didn’t need the final chorus repeat that they had. It’s weird that this album was the most successful of the three because it felt like it had the fewest songs with hit potential, but history has already proven me wrong there I guess. It was very ambitious for someone for someone her age.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.941): This is Taylor's happy medium between country and pop and it's her best album because of it. She matches the high energy of the production throughout and even though commercially this album probably did the least to advance her star power, she just sounds like a superstar on most of these tracks. Unfortunately, like all Taylor albums, there are a handful of downright embarrassing songs that bring down the average dramatically for me. [Grade: B]

**radiofan15** (6.906): Sorry Swifties but this was more missed than hits for me, as this album features mostly underwhelming tracks and some outright terrible material that nearly made me forget of the genuinely good material here. [Score: C+]

**vayyiqra** (5.647): this is my first time hearing this album, after meaning to listen to it for years, because i've never heard taylor's old albums and want to hear her whole discog at least once; this album is the only reason i did this rate. i found it to be the best in the rate but still far from anywhere near as good as 1989, the only album by her i really like. my scores are going to make some swifties want to murder me but i don't care because they're truthful to what i thought. i see some potential here but a lot of middling, boring songs, and the whole thing is too damn long at 17 tracks and over an hour in running time. overall rating: 5.6

Arguably the best song to be spawned from a Hunger Games soundtrack, and damn did Taylor and the Civil Wars mesh seamlessly. Sung almost entirely in her head voice, Taylor’s traditionally frailer vocal range especially at her age, created a chilling atmosphere that felt like it was created during a very real post-apocalyptic world. 

---

**1998tweety** (10): One of her bests

**agentofscranton** (10): we rated the wrong hunger games soundtrack - eyes open also slaps

**CarlieScion** (10): taylors most beautiful song

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Maybe the best song in the rate, I love how delicate Taylor sounds here this is the best vocal performance of her career.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Holy fucking shit this is taylor's best fucking song of all time, if she ever makes anything better than this, I might just kill myself cause I'll never be happier than that moment.

**moooo566** (10): The Civil Wars are so good and its a real shame they only got two albums out. Stream those, and then stream their solo work too. They deserve it just as much as that other lady on this track.

**paper\_books** (10): where is my 11 for the bonus tracks >:v Can I at least use a 12 for it

**radiofan15** (10): God I miss when The Hunger Games were actually good!

**vhqv1997** (10): Throwback to me auditioning for a music club at my high school with this song and they said I shouldn't sing it since it's a girl song lmao. Thank God I failed that audition because it turned out the club president was exposed as a crackhead who oftentimes tried to share his drugs with the members. This only came out after they were dragged by the entire school for trying do an a capella performance of Telephone with similar outfits to the ones in the video. Man, I also dodged a bullet there because they were trying to get me to film their performance lol.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): this would be a contender for the 11 if it were in the main rate, just a hauntingly beautiful song

**Memph5** (7.5): a really unique touch to her discography.

**synthpopprince** (7.5): Stunning. We need Taylor to experiment with this sound more in the future.

**Sopejoonkook** (7): I really liked this song when it came out but haven't listened to it for years. I still like it. It's a really sweet song and perfect for the Peeta/Katniss love story but wouldn't rank it particularly high in Taylor's discography. Something about her voice in this song bothers me and normally I'm a defender of Taylor's voice.

**vayyiqra** (7): i've heard this before it's nice she can write good ballads
