The 2010s Country Classics Rate Day 1: I'm Blonde, I'm Skinny, I'm Rich, And I'm a Little Bit of a Bitch
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/dmyr67/the_2010s_country_classics_rate_day_1_im_blonde/

Welcome to the first day of the 2010s Country Classics rate starring Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, and Miranda Lambert! 

Hold on tight while we reveal the first 15 songs out, (#45 - #31), as well as the first three songs out from our bonus rate! 

--- 

Before we begin, here are some fun things to note: 

I had **46** beautiful popheads participate in this rate, meaning we will see a $30 donation to charity, and a nitro giveaway on Sunday!

The average score was **7.494**, a pretty skinny average if you ask me. 

The average controversy score is **1.874**, anything over this should be considered a controversial placement! 

--- 

We will begin at 12pm EST in this thread, as well as in the **[plug!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)** Join us for some country songs, some shitposts, and some other assorted bops!

A critically panned /r/popheads rate song? Indeed it was, and it was close to being non-controversial too. Fortunately it is the only song below a 6.0 average. 

I unfortunately have to agree, the song is a mix of super cliché, grating, and a full mess. C’mon Carrie, I know you can do better. 

---

**1998tweety** (9): This has a bit of a Carribean twist on it? Wild but I love it.

**gannade** (9): .... is this and the song before it .... some white girl reggae?! im for it

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Miss Carrie taking us to the islands! I like the tropical influences on this song, and I appreciate that they actually make sense with the lyrical/thematic content of the song rather than just being a trendy sound choice. This is just pure sunny fun.

**vhqv1997** (9): Commercial music never sounded so good

**poppinmolly** (7.5): fine

**rickikardashian** (7.5): I'm actually very down to a vacation and a nice break Carrie, but some of us are poor and need to work. Who's paying for this break you're talking about? Will I have to pay for the ticket to go back home? I have children to put through college and dogs to feed

**CarlieScion** (7): the instrumental,,, is this reggae-country???

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i'm a sucker for country songs with a beachy vibe. this could have easily been a duet with kenny chesney

**waluigiest** (7): this is kinda fun and funky I guess

**radiofan15** (6.7): She's serving vocals but the songs aren't fully there

**Sopejoonkook** (6): Cute but doesn't stand out to me. I like the whistling though.

**synthpopprince** (6): Am I here for Carrie's Kenny Chesney imitation? Not really. Do I still play this song at the beach every summer? You bet.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): This song is just too corny for me and it also has ukuleles so nah.

**MrSwearword** (4): this does sound like a one way ticket...to a fucking Sandals cruise & resort commercial.

**skargardin** (4): the pseudo whistling completely ruined this for me

**lilguavachan** (2): can we go back to dramatic songs about killing men, and cute little songs about being in love? what is this hallmark channel shit

**TragicKingdom1** (0): the WORST transportation themed song in this rate and the WORST overall song in this rate as well

**vayyiqra** (0): awful and irritating; more or less a low-tier jimmy buffett song but with a nasal southern drawl

Another bottom tier Carrie song, features only two scores above an 8.0 :yikes:. 

The Yee Haw, religion, and conservativism LEAPT out with this song tbh, it just feels stereotypical country and an attempt at rehashing Temporary Home from Play On. 

---

**CarlieScion** (10): 😭😭😭

**/u/lilguavachan** (8): i'm glad we're away from whatever the last two songs were, but as someone who lived in towns in the south like she described... i cannot say i feel the same as carrie.

**1998tweety** (8): Lyrics on this are great

**ImADudeDuh** (8): awww this is so sweet. the opening verse is too relatable and really hits me.

**waluigiest** (8): this song stepped on my midwestern, West Coast-transplant throat :/

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): As someone who’s burning through his savings trying NOT to have to go back to his hometown I’m triggered, but the song is cute and I’m glad she’s happy.

**radiofan15** (6.6): Punk: I will live and die in my hometown :( ... Country: I will live and die in my hometown :)

**hikkaru** (6.5): this is a little too on the nose

**synthpopprince** (6.5): Very average.

**Sopejoonkook** (5): It's okay. I find the lyrics a little too sweet. The country trope of romanticizing little hometowns gets old for me. There are a million other versions of this song and I don't need another one.

**vayyiqra** (4): reminds me of a twitter meme i saw a little while ago that says emo is about not wanting to die in your hometown and country is about wanting to die in it

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): maudlin lyrics, forgettable melody

**NotWith10000Men** (2): fuck my hometown

**MrSwearword** (0): thank god for the skip button because this song is actively unpleasant as fuck. BYE

Ok I’d say this is the first ‘robbery’ of the rate, and fully expected this to last further in day 1/early day 2, but nope. After a harsh drop with one of its 0s it never recovered above the #40 mark. 


As /u/poppinmolly said, it is indeed ‘cute!’.

---

**poppinmolly** (8.5): cute!

**radiofan15** (8.2): The second half alone is a serve and a half.

**MrSwearword** (8): I'm actually not mad at this chicken fried self-confidence anthem. Sure it's more ham fisted than a pig trained to box but that's actually the charming part of it.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Cute message

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like this song, it’s a little presumptuous but it has a good heart. The main problem is that it’s too long, it could have stopped at three minutes, the last minute isn’t unpleasant but it’s basically nothing.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): sorry Carrie I’m ugly but thanks for trying

**rickikardashian** (7): This a empowerment song to young girls and I think it's great she acknowledges how many women feel very insecure in their own bodies, but I'm very confused with the line "Turn off the static of the TV", is the broken TV that only shoes grey static making these girls insecure? Why is the broken static TV on if it doesn't show anything? How much is the girl's electricity bill?

**Sopejoonkook** (7): It's a fun cute bop. The type of song I could dance around my apartment to.

**vhqv1997** (7): This is the country equivalence of mom-pop.

**synthpopprince** (5.5): The verses are kind of corny and preachy, but I like the chorus and the bridge. The Blown Away album came out the same year I did, and the message of self-acceptance in this song meant a lot to me at the time.

**CarlieScion** (5): ah yes. condescending "you are beautiful without makeup"-song number 9435

**NotWith10000Men** (5): pretty bland but good message

**waluigiest** (5): this has no spark

**vayyiqra** (4): this irks me

**/u/lilguavachan** (0): "beauty is only skin deep! shine bright like a diamond! you don't need makeup to be beautiful!" gurl if you don't shut the fuck up istg.....

**wanderingimpromptu3** (0): Carrie's highs are high but her filler is definitely the worst, objectionable bc they are so boring and flat without any evidence that someone tried to at least put care into the lyrics. This one has some annoying sonic elements so it gets the 0

Out goes Taylor’s first song, a bonus track, and honestly her worst album, deluxe or regular, closer of her career. 

---

**poppinmolly** (10): cute!!!! but fuck John Mayer.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Superman is one of my favorite heroes, I don’t get the argument that he’s boring or overpowered or whatever. Also he’s the hottest superhero, Tom Welling on *Smallville* was such a #moment for young me. I do genuinely really like the song, but it’s no [“It’s Superman” from the 1966 Superman musical.](https://youtu.be/LE8Q7pE-Th0?t=413)

**vhqv1997** (9): I still don't understand why this song gets so much hate, it's cute, it's fun, and it's cool, what is there to hate? Sure it's not a lyrical masterpiece, but it did its job well and never overstayed its welcome and pretended to be anything else but a fun cute love song, so why...?

**CarlieScion** (7): cute i guess [2]

**MrSwearword** (7): Superman doesn't put papers in a briefcase, that's Clark Kent you fucking twit. That aside, I'm going to be very generous by seven points.

**paper\_books** (7): I really don't know what to think of this. Oh well it's alright

**Sopejoonkook** (7): It's a fun bop.

**waluigiest** (7): no man is this valuable

**Memph5** (6.5): Lyrics are a bit eh sometimes but it's still a fun light-hearted song. A lot of the electric guitar sounds similar to the ones on State of Grace.

**1998tweety** (6): Yeah I'm not really a fan of this...

**vayyiqra** (6): finally this rate is over

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the back half of this album was a struggle to get through

**synthpopprince** (4.5): 99% of the time you're one of the best songwriters on the planet and 1% of the time you write Superman.

**radiofan15** (3.7): God this is as bad as Switfies said it was!

**Sopejoonkook** (6): Still can't believe B.O.B managed to land on of the few Taylor Swift features out there. I really like Taylor's intro/refrain but when the rapping comes in for the first verse the sudden change in is jarring.

**synthpopprince** (4): I went to a Lover release party where we ranked every single one of Taylor's singles. This was dead last.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): it's like two different songs stitched together, Taylor's part is pretty in a bland way and the other part is kind of annoying

And now Miranda is down a song! Everyone has dents made to their totals, and tbh the songs out all deserve. 

You’ll see a pretty common theme that most of these songs are starting in the middle and will drop to the bottom by the 10th-12th ballot. 

---

**waluigiest** (9): this doesn’t reinvent the world but it’s such a solid little chunk of music. Super cute, tight melodies/harmonies, I’m super into this

**1998tweety** (8): This feels very country so I assume it'll get dragged.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This kind of twangy, laid back country always gets a kick out of me.

**vhqv1997** (7): I mean... This song has the same first line as literally the next song on the album... I guess I could see there being some kind of progression since it's raining in this song, but will be snowing in the next, but... does she only have one line...?

**hikkaru** (6.5): well, this is exactly what I expected a song called "Easy Living" to sound like

**synthpopprince** (6.5): Lyrics are cute, but the weird background noises really bother me.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): way too meh

**MrSwearword** (5): more like easy skipping considering how goddamn boring this song is

**radiofan15** (5): This song sounds like a cliche

**Sopejoonkook** (5): cute but kinda forgettable. I don’t dislike it but I wouldn’t listen to it outside of the album

Shockingly almost at the very bottom of the rate, and I don’t really get it. It’s a fairly solid song and always a great vocal performance. My issue with some of Carrie’s stuff is that thematically it always seems as though she has a different song with similar themes that is just better.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Kind of filler-y oop

**rickikardashian** (7.5): damn the third verse is a hard one to swallow:(

**synthpopprince** (7): One of her saddest songs, and another one that really benefits from her vocal restraint.

**vayyiqra** (7): pretty

**poppinmolly** (6.5): more like FOREVER BORED

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its sad but thats it

**Sopejoonkook** (6): It's a little slow for me without anything that really hooks me in.

**vhqv1997** (6): I'm sorry, Carrie, this song is very sad, but I have also forgotten the lyrics

**radiofan15** (4.5): Typical mid-album ballad that you just wish to skip and SKIP forever.

**CarlieScion** (4): find this rather boring tbh

**NotWith10000Men** (4): unpopular opinion but singing about pregnancy is weird to me

**MrSwearword** (1): not even Carrie's talent saves a song this goddamn maudlin

Who Are You is a great introspective album closer, and the belts are a great way to close the album that starts with such powerful belts. 

---

**moooo566** (10): hell of a closer too

**1998tweety** (8.5): Good closer

**radiofan15** (7.6): God her vocals are amazing... but why is this the album closer?

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): carrie + piano + belting = chef's kiss

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I have a sneaking suspicious this song is about Jesus or something like that, I don’t mind it necessarily but it is still kind of a weak song.

**Sopejoonkook** (6): I like it more once it picks up but not a big fan of the beginning. The 'who are you' belt is a little repetitive

**waluigiest** (6): imagine a guy worth this much I literally cannot

**Memph5** (5): gives me Shania vibes

**MrSwearword** (5): and who am I? Well dear, I'm glad you asked. I'm someone who despite thinking the singing is mostly there, the album itself manages to have me blown away at how inconsistent it is.

**vayyiqra** (5): the who outsold

**gannade** (1): honestly a terrible melody

**synthpopprince** (0): She can do religious songs so well (Jesus Take The Wheel, Something In The Water) but to me this fails epically. It's too vague, and has some really clunky lyrics. Please explain to me what "Who are you, who fell on me like fire" means???

Throwback to when I really wanted to get the lyric ‘Today’s never too late to be brand new’ tattooed on me. 

I like the song, but wow I probably would’ve regretted that *heavily*.

---

**1998tweety** (10): A GOOD diss track, rep is shook. I like this song but it gets a little lost especially when sandwiched between BTR and Haunted. With that said, I do think this is the best place in the album to slot this song in. It's a nice song, the lyrics are the prime focus and they deliver on that front. Someone said the line "You're still an innocent" can sound like "You're stealing innocence." all I have to say is that some of y'all don't give Taylor enough credit cause wow the way her mind works is powerful.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): Beautiful, haunting song when it stands by itself, I choose to ignore the context

**poppinmolly** (8): honestly and truly, fuck Kanye West. This is usually a skip because compared to the rest of the album it falls short.

**waluigiest** (8): I didn’t know this song existed!! Interesting to revisit in a post-Rep world hahahah

**/u/lilguavachan** (7): i'm sick of her talking about that republican rapper

**CarlieScion** (7): pretty but also petty

**Memph5** (7): I have a really hard time deciding how I feel about this song and whether it's genuine or intentional condescending. It sounds very beautiful though.

**paper\_books** (7): tbh I'm never sure where to put this. Better Than Revenge and Innocent are the two songs on Speak Now that drag it down a bit.

**rickikardashian** (7): Honestly the best part of this song is the production, because the lyrics of this song can come off a bit backhanded and preachy, it's a bit "you can still be a nice person, not like now that you're a piece of shit". It also has aged terribly considering all the drama that was going to come, but I guess we can't hold her responsible for that

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensive:

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I think she has a point, I’m not sure what it is but this song is five minutes long so SURELY these lyrics must have a point

**MrSwearword** (6): boring but as Taylor albums of the past I've rated have taught me, it could be much, much worse

**radiofan15** (5.2): Sorry Taylor, imma happy for you imma let you finish but Runaway is the best song about Taylorgate of all TIME!

**Sopejoonkook** (5): I've always found this song boring. One of my two skips on this album.

**synthpopprince** (5): If only the Kayne/Taylor feud ended here with this passive aggressive lullaby - the worst song on the (standard version) album.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): she doesn't sound her best on songs like this

The #2 peaking mega hit Today Was a Fairytale is out next in the bonus rate, and Taylor is already down to 1 song left in the bonus rate. 

And honestly? Thank god. This song is a wreck and cheesy as HELL. 

---

**vhqv1997** (9): Taylor should have won an Oscar for her performance in Valentine's Day, she would have been well on her way to an EGOT by now (a Tony for Cats, an Emmy for CSI, and a Grammy for The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection)

**moooo566** (8.5): i like this song more than it deserves, but its pretty cute

**Sopejoonkook** (8): The best movie song Taylor has ever written. The fairytale theme is classic Taylor but it doesn't feel repetitive. The refrain is so catchy and definitely brings up the song. The verses are a little weak lyrically with Taylor just listing out fairly standard boyfriend activities but the refrain is just so good.

**Memph5** (6): I'm conflicted about this song because it's really catchy with some really strong hooks but the lyrics can get kinda basic and repetitive at times...

**radiofan15** (5.5): NOPE!

**synthpopprince** (5.5): A cute song, and a big indication of how powerful she was becoming when it hit #2. This sort of feels like a farewell to the Fearless era, and I prefer the more mature songs that came afterwards.

**vayyiqra** (5): middling taylor song #28217

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): girl have you ever read a fairy tale, those are messed up. “today was a fairytale, I wore a dress” oh my godddddddd

It’s a bit cookie cutter for Carrie, but wow she is a queen at getting strong hooks carried almost completely by those pipes. 

---

**radiofan15** (9.5): That first chorus is the definition of edging and I LOVE IT.

**CarlieScion** (9): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8.9): well damn, leave it alone carrie. this is how restraining orders start

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Oooh, the chorus of this one caught me off-guard. This is a neat little track, every time I start to get bored with it it switches itself just enough to keep me hooked.

**poppinmolly** (8): oh mood

**synthpopprince** (8): A fun song but not a standout.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This isn't really hitting it for me but it's decent.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): love having a guitar front and center

**Sopejoonkook** (7): I really like the refrain.

I’m not even sarcastic when I say I actually like this song because I love a good song about drinking. Plus typing this up makes me crave a good glass of red and a shot of whiskey.

---

**harsh-femme** (10): my god she really went all in on this one.

**poppinmolly** (10): did she have to go this hard??? absolutely not!! but she did! I almost cried straightening my hair getting ready one morning.

**1998tweety** (9): Please drink responsively

**synthpopprince** (8.5): A classic Carrie power ballad.

**radiofan15** (8.1): Having wine after whiskey normally means you're an alcoholic Carrie.

**rickikardashian** (8): this bangs but is she implying that wine is not as good as whiskey? because this doesn't tell me anything about the love she once had, but tells me everything about her shitty wine taste

**CarlieScion** (7): standard ballad [2]

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I listened to this song yesterday and forgot to rank it so now I’m coming back to rank it and I forgot what it sounded like? So it must be a 7 then, neither great or bad.

**skargardin** (7): at this point im ready for this album to be over

**waluigiest** (7): I don’t know if I get the similie but I feel it. This Carrie needs to listen to Good in Goodbye

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I don’t drink so this song means nothing to me.

**Sopejoonkook** (6): Like it don't love it.

**vhqv1997** (6): Isn't whiskey also a kind of wine?

**NotWith10000Men** (5): tell us how you really feel about wine girl

**vayyiqra** (5): you know the order in which alcoholic drinks are taken does not matter since the alcohol in them (which is ethanol to be specific, C2H5OH) is absorbed the same way in the body and that is the most relevant factor in intoxication though of course it can vary based on the stomach contents and the rate of gastric emptying, and enzyme induction leading to tolerance with frequent drinking though that is outside the scope of this discussion

**MrSwearword** (4): liquor before beer, I could have something better in my ear or beer before liquor, this songwriting is making me sicker.

Another middling Carrie track? Color me not surprised. Like most of the middle/end of the album, these tracks gradually blend and just get same-y pretty quick.

---

**waluigiest** (10): wow we love a mature breakup reflection! This is gorgeous and real and such a sobering experience overall

**synthpopprince** (9.5): This song has my favorite Carrie lyric ever - "I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved." I'm a fan of the rare moments where she works with pop songwriters, and I'd like to see her write with Ryan Tedder again someday.

**1998tweety** (8.5): :sad:

**poppinmolly** (8.5): this one makes me VERY sad!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like the piano on this track, it was a neat change of pace at the start of the track and I wish that the song had leaned into that more and stayed simple. It’s still a beautiful song but a piano ballad would have been a serve, and instead it’s just kind of another track on the album.

**MrSwearword** (8): at least there's something like good vocals and no "thank god for church pews" level lyrics but some that are good.

**vhqv1997** (8): Very good Christian music, sadly I'm not Christian, but I can still appreciate that it's a good song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): damn shes really christian huh

**paper\_books** (7): bumped up from a 6 to a 7 because I laughed at the title when I first heard it

**radiofan15** (6.9): All of her songs sounds like they are like 6 minutes long but they're not.

**CarlieScion** (6): a standard ballad. nothing much.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Good message but a snooze fest

**Sopejoonkook** (6): Again it's a perfectly fine ballad and her voice is amazing but nothing really hooks me in to make we want to listen again.

**vayyiqra** (5): bland as unsweetened rice pudding

**NotWith10000Men** (4): i wish her slow jams had a little more oomph to them

This song? Meh. It’s low key a mess lyrically and doesn’t really have any kind of foundation or stand out moment. 

---

**/u/lilguavachan** (10): one of my favorite taylor songs... watch this bitch go out the first day because popheads is a pit of stupidity

**CarlieScion** (10): come back to me ELIIIIIIIIIIII

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a song that plays at my job a lot, whew. Also, hannah montana DEFINITELY outpeaked.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this song didn’t need to bitchslap me like this

**radiofan15** (7.9): Not Like The Movies outsold!

**rickikardashian** (7.3): Honestly the bonus tracks really feel like songs pulled together to make a deluxe version and boost sales, since none of the songs are either that different from the others nor better than any in the normal version

**paper\_books** (7.2): It's alright. Hold onto me like sounds so much like Hold onto Eli I'm surprised that we haven't found that Taylor has an ex with that name

**1998tweety** (7): It's on the deluxe for a reason...not bad, just underwhelming.

**Memph5** (7): Along with Superman, it's one of the Speak Now songs that don't really have any standout lyrics but it sounds nice enough. I like the instrumental intro (which also sounds really similar to Stilletos' by Kelsea Ballerini).

**Sopejoonkook** (7): It's a good song but Hannah Montana's version is better

**waluigiest** (7): this feels entirely unoriginal, but she’s good at this form

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the little repetitions in the chorus are cute but Hannah Montana outsold

**synthpopprince** (6): A little too juvenile for me.

**vayyiqra** (6): i thought i'd be done by now with this rate yet here we are

**gannade** (4): hannah montana did it better

**MrSwearword** (1): it'd be a goddamn Nicolas Sparks movie with how fucking sappy and basic it is

wanderingimpromptu3: I hope so, her best album deserves it. 

But I bet Carrie is going to snatch #1 with Blown Away. The Taylor 11's are going to be spread across many songs.

wanderingimpromptu3: Pleasantly surprised by the well deserved Carrie slaughter, her top 3 songs are GREAT but the songs out today are what happens when you aren't a songwriter yourself, and can't insist that some effort get put into the deep cuts. No shade to Carrie, she sold them as hard as possible, but it shows when the other two in the rate are songwriters. Nobody else has tracks that feel like pure paint by the numbers filler that no one *tried* to craft with care (even if they failed.)

wanderingimpromptu3: I'm used to being the only Innocent stan so it's ok, but... Innocent was robbed. Sure if you take it in context of the Kanye drama it's a passive aggressive snotty mess, but if you take the song on its own, it's a beautiful song about redemption with a *lovely* haunting melody.

deleted: Besides, there's a place for passive aggressive snotty messes, particularly in the situation Taylor was in at that time. Completely justified and still eminently listenable imo.
