Hello and welcome to the Turn of the Decade Country Women Rate! Myself, along with /u/JCarson24x are proud to bring you back to the country genre, a genre rarely touched upon by /r/popheads. This month, we bring you three iconic country masterpieces from three of the biggest names in country music, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, and Miranda Lambert.

##[Carrie Underwood – Blown Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blown_Away_(album)

A return to form, most definitely. After Play On’s tepid critical reception, Carrie Underwood returned to a twangier sound, but brought with her the more powerful hooks she was able to make from her past era. 

Bringing in three top 40 hits, with two breaking into the top 20, Carrie Underwood brought her A Game for Blown Away, with all four singles certified platinum or higher, and having one of her strongest international debuts of her career. Blown Away was also met with much better reviews than Play On, with a 70 metacritic score, it is technically the lowest reviewed album on this list. Blown Away is the culmination of her best parts of her career preceding her. The country sound of Some Hearts, the lyrics of Carnival Ride, and the hooks of Play On. The staple of Carrie’s discography is of course, her arena filling voice, and it’s a voice that seems to progressively grow and get better, something rarely seen in the industry. Her voice has stood the test of time, and she marches into this album with her most confident and consistent performances of her career. 

1.	Good Girl
2.	Blown Away 
3.	Two Black Cadillacs
4.	See You Again 
5.	Do You Think About Me

##[Taylor Swift – Speak Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now)

Widely considered to be her best album, Speak Now was a strange choice on paper. After the massive commercial success of Fearless, winning album of the year and spawning two of Swift’s biggest hits to date, Big Machine Records and Scott Borchetta decided it would be a good idea to let Taylor release a completely self-written album. Somehow it worked, and it worked exceedingly well. It would go on to be the first of four album eras to move over 1 million in pure sales its first week of release, and included two top 10 singles, and three additional top 20 hits. It also featured the largest amount of entries from a single album onto the Billboard hot 100, with all tracks from the standard edition of the album charting except for its title track, Speak Now, within the top 100. 

Speak Now was also Swift’s best reviewed album before Lover’s release this year, Speak Now has a 77/100 metacritic score, with critics raving for her writing and maturity, especially for a 20 year old. The album was largely ignored by awards during its respective award cycle, however, losing its one Grammy nomination, and being left out of the running for Album of the Year. Despite its lack of major commercial hits in comparison to Fearless, Speak Now is rightfully considered to be one of her best for being one of the best examples of Swift’s potential, a superb singer-songwriter, and one that shouldn’t be held down to a singular genre. 

1.	Mine 
2.	Sparks Fly 
3.	Back to December
4.	Speak Now
5.	Dear John
6.	Mean
7.	The Story of Us
8.	Never Grow Up
9.	Enchanted
10.	Better Than Revenge
11.	Innocent
12.	Haunted
13.	Last Kiss
14.	Long Live
15.	Ours
16.	If This Was a Movie
17.	Superman 

* We will **NOT** be rating the acoustic/pop mixes of the songs here. It makes the album way too long compared to the other two.

##[Miranda Lambert - Four the Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_the_Record)

The critical darling of this rate, Miranda Lambert delivers us one of the most consistent records here, and the best reviewed. Miranda Lambert also delivers one of the most diverse albums here, combating Taylor Swift’s self-written album with an album made up by 18 songwriters over her 14 songs. 

This is widely seen as a positive note, however, with her guest writers creating some of her best tracks on the album, and these guest writers are heavy weights in their own right, with help from Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile, Blake Shelton, and Chris Stapleton, Miranda had a country music wet dream create some of the best songs in the rate here. The album is a cohesive masterpiece, and like much of Miranda’s music, is criminally underrated. 

1.	All Kinds of Kinds
2.	Fine Tune
3.	Fastest Girl in Town 
4.	Safe
5.	Mama’s Broken Heart
6.	Dear Diamond
7.	Same Old You 
8.	Baggage Claim
9.	Easy Living
10.	Over You 
11.	Look at Miss Ohio
12.	Better In the Long Run 
13.	Nobody’s Fool 
14.	Oklahoma Sky

#these are the rules, follow them.

- Listen to each song and assign each a score **between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots. This means that giving a 7 is fine! Giving a 7.5 is fine! Giving a 7.55 is absolutely out of the question!

- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total, not one song per album**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results and is very annoying! 

- You may **NOT** give your 0/11 to a bonus rate song.

- You have to listen to and rank each song!

- Your scores are not confidential!

- If we suspect you from intentionally giving certain songs or artists low scores for the sake of sabotage, I will not hesitate to tell you to clarify or change your scores!

- Your scores can be changed at any time! Just PM the corrections to /u/_wailordfan!

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Like this:

###THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT TO SUBMIT:
>Enchanted: 11 Teenage love is such a new subject for Taylor to cover, we stan. 

###THESE ARE WRONG, LITERALLY ANY FORMAT THAT IS NOT LIKE ABOVE IS WRONG:
> Enchanted: 11: Teenage love is such a new subject for Taylor to cover, we stan.

> Enchanted: 11 - Teenage love is such a new subject for Taylor to cover, we stan.

> Enchanted: Teenage love is such a new subject for Taylor to cover, we stan, this gets my 11

>Enchanted: eleven Teenage love is such a new subject for Taylor to cover, we stan.

###You can also comments on the albums as a whole by adding a colon after the title:

>Album: Four the Record: Four really outsold Five. 

###Don't do it like this or anything that's not like above

>Album: Four the Record > Fourfive Seconds
