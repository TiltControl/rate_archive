Alternative Pop Queens Rate Day 1: Now another one bites the dust, and let's be clear, I trust no one
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bf3wxt/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_1_now_another_one/

Good evening to everyone! at long last, the Alternative Pop Queens rate reveal!!! Jesus y'all this rate killed me

Today is the first day of the Alternative Pop Queens rate, after like 2.5 years. Unfortunately, it didn't get as many people participating as you would think after all that time (or because of that time), but the results are really interesting and I'm 99% sure that there something happens for the first time ever in a rate. 

The rate will start at 5PM EDT (half an hour from now). I'll be revealing #30-#16 tomorrow at the same time!

We'll do songs #47-#31. Bonus tracks will be revealed tomorrow and the day after.

46 beautiful people participated!

[Participant List](https://pastebin.com/hZdYfqLc). if you aren't here and you sent scores yell at me ASAP and I'll see if I can add you.

____

##The average score for the entire rate was 7.6265.

##The average controversy score for the entire rate was a moderate 1.7432. Anything higher than that is controversial.

The average score for the songs today is 6.9053. 

I'll be active in the thread, with hints and bad jokes for the next songs out. AMA one of pophead's most controversial users!!!

For SOME reason I thought that y‚Äôall would actually like this song, but holy crap, it got MASSACRED. Only 17 0s were given in this entire rate and this one got 10 OF THEM. More than HALF of the 0s in the entire rate! I for one hate this with every fiber of my being. It‚Äôs just so bad and straight up disrespectful to the original emotional impact of this song. It doesn‚Äôt fit the essential tone of the original, the vocals are messed up, and the track just becomes a homogenous mess.

---
/u/hikkaru says it well:

**hikkaru** (0): lmao I really don't like this and it's kind of offensive to me that this was the version of the song that was far bigger in a lot of the world. I hate that her voice is pitched up like that and that it's changed to be so repetitive, and then the new production isn't even interesting at all like why bother remixing it if you're not going to make it have cool production? Habits is like the perfect song to get a producer to come in and remix it to make it a crying-on-the-dancefloor-bop (where's the chainsmokers remix in this rate smh) but this hippie guy just gives it these melancholy synths that put me to sleep, but then I'm jolted awake by the high pitched Tove vocals that are manipulated so much for some reason I don't know why because they're good and get the message of the song across very well in the original! if this outplaces the original song hands will be thrown you'd best believe

____

***This is okay***

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Remixes just don't do it for me compared to the original. HS made this a dope one for sure.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): never heard this remix before  makes the song a little lighter

**passionfruits2** (7): Not as good, but a decent breakthrough hit.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): for real, this is no where as good as the original

**vayyiqra** (6): As a rule I don't listen to remixes because they're rarely as good as the original, let alone better. This one isn't bad exactly, just pointless.

***This is totally garbage***

**nooodisaster** (5): Ouch, I thought I was gonna like this as much as the original but as usual, the gp has NO taste. This is too repetitive and gets rid of literally all of the verses, killing so much of the personality, and the drop stunts the emotion. Kinda ugly, ngl.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This is probably the most overrated remix on the planet. I used to be really really into EDM and electronic music and I‚Äôve literally never understood the hype for many reasons. The drop is bland, the percussion is so mediocre, and the remix cuts out the edgy verses, which is easily the best part of the original track.

**waluigiest** (3): the little tweaks all annoy me - the pitch altering, the tempo bump, repeating lines here and there. This remix provides no new utility

**akanewasright** (1): Why the fuck are we acknowledging this garbage? Its functionally useless. Like, I‚Äôve has people tell me it‚Äôs better for dancing, but I can‚Äôt imagine dancing to this dreariness.

**selegend** (1): europe sweetie i‚Äôm so sorry that this was the version that smashed there

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (1): trash

**1998tweety** (0): I genuinely do not know why people were so obsessed with this remix, it takes away every single thing I love about the original version and replaces it with and an absurd amount of repetition. The drop isn't even that satisfying.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): I can definitely understand the 'sabotage remix' part of the name


**jamesfog** (0): Mawma this is garbage

**ManofOranges** (0): Sabotage is a very apt word because, judging by how bad this is, you'd think they were trying to sabotage Tove Lo's career

**skargardin** (0): I absolutely loathe this remix, bye bish.

**tapdancingpig** (0): Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, but I find nothing appealing about this bullshit remix. Everything I like about the original dropped. The painfully sharp lyrics, the two part chorus, the big hook, it‚Äôs all gone. She doesn‚Äôt sound good anymore either, since she‚Äôs pitched up and her vocals are... quieter? And while the production isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs not as good as the original, and it‚Äôs nowhere near as evocative.

**worlds\_okayest666** (0): It's good background music. That's the only thing I can say about it.

The first ‚Äúreal‚Äù song out in this rate. The low score on this is not surprising at all to me. Unlike the other ballads on this album, there really isn‚Äôt anything that special about this song at all. I don‚Äôt like kid sounds in songs. Instantly lost a lot of points from me. The backstory to this song is really sad. It's an ode to her father and their relationship.

---
**tapdancingpig** (8.5): A really good ‚Äúplot point‚Äù for the album, and just a gorgeous song in general.

**effervescentemu** (8): Down-tempo piano ballad that tugs at my rusty withered homo heartstrings - especially at 3:00 when she belts 'I knooow you careee' but you can tell she doesn't truly believe that ha man does.

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): makes me wonder what the story behind it is

**nooodisaster** (8): Gurl, I'm not sure that he cares.

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is really cute but also sad, which is what she does best.

**1998tweety** (7.8): Ellie is better with interesting production, her ballads blend a bit too much.

**waluigiest** (7): sweet ballad but doesn‚Äôt quite reach anything for me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Ellie Goulding‚Äôs ballads are just really boring and the production on this is so unfeeling and unfitting.

**ramskick** (4): Apparently Ellie Goulding knows someone who cares.  Based on her tone that person is clearly not her.

**passionfruits2** (3): This is not good.

I personally adore this song but I can see why its placed so low. Unlike the other pop/dubstep songs in Ellie‚Äôs album, this song is so dark that I‚Äôm not surprised that some people hate the droning bass and downer vocals. I feel like this is such an iconic song to this album and I‚Äôm sad to see it go so, so soon.

---
**ManofOranges** (10): This song sounds so good it just kinda sounds mysterious and dark and I like it

**MashLuke** (10): underrated song

**passionfruits2** (9): NEVERMIND BITCH. I'M LIVING. LI-VING. LI-VING.

**1998tweety** (7): Charlie Puth greatly outsold

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): ...idk what to say. Emotionally drained

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is okay

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): dubstep Tove fuck me up

***We hate Dubstep in Popheads!!!***

**vayyiqra** (7): This is one of those "I like it but it's a bit fillerish" songs in my opinion. It's fine, but not one of the best songs on the album.

**waluigiest** (7): this is a little bland and dated but it still gets the job done

**nooodisaster** (6): Sad but kinda disposable.

**tapdancingpig** (5): This is kind of a dud.

**twat\_brained** (4): Tove's voice sounds rough and the instrumental just sounds ugly

**akanewasright** (3): Tove sounds bad here, and the hook is boring.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): the production on this sucks even more than the rest of the album

I actually don‚Äôt hate this as much as a lot of people seem to. It‚Äôs slow, yeah, but I like the theatric quality to it and her voice sounds good. The production is also pretty cool. I do wish that it was about half the length it is, though.

---
**akanewasright** (10): This might be my favorite power ballad-y Sia song.

**nooodisaster** (9): Not sure if any song has captured the synesthesia of 'black' better than this one. Sasha Velour's lip-sync of this is a great companion piece https://youtu.be/I0S7-iKzEBE?t=40

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): uuunngg her voice

**1998tweety** (8.5): I don't know why but I'm kind of digging this.

**waluigiest** (8): her voice does things

**twat\_brained** (7.3): oh this song is a longboye. Feels pretty damn long too.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a really interesting song. It's so dark and atmospheric, and sounds nothing like the rest of the album. I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me a lot.

**namiko\_shuuya** (6): wished I connected, didn't

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Quiet track that just doesn‚Äôt build up to anything worthwhile imo

**passionfruits2** (4): wrap me in.

**hikkaru** (2): this song just makes me really uncomfortable lmao it's so creepy... then it tries to sound brighter with the guitar parts and her vocals but it just makes it even worse tbh

Best Lana Del Rey diss track I‚Äôve ever heard! definitely a bop regardless of anything else, the production is just really good. It‚Äôs just a fun little song, and the message is innocent IMO. Ever heard Young Girls by Bruno Mars? Why is that acceptable when some of you guys are hating on this one?

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this makes me want to ride dick

**passionfruits2** (8): Leaving Tove Lo. (too soon?)

**rosesmp3** (8): queen of calling out double standards

**vayyiqra** (8): I can't listen to this song without cracking up. The lyrics are hilarious. Having said that, she has a point - there's nothing wrong with women liking men younger than them. [Within limits, of course.]

**waluigiest** (8): lana del rey found dead in miami

**worlds\_okayest666** (7.7): Queen of age-gaps! Sarah Paulson found shaking while eating a cookie

Really controversial and I don‚Äôt get it. I think the instrumental is very dry and the lyrics aren‚Äôt anything special, and it doesn‚Äôt have the pizzaz of Explosions or JOY. Regardless, it got two 11s so some people like it!!!

---
**1998tweety** (11): This song is so gorgeous, makes me teary-eyed. Has a good concept and isn't boring unlike the other ballads on this album.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): something about the element water makes me calm. in fact, i actually wish i could die by drowning. no, i don't think it would be a pleasant moment by the time water starts to fill my lungs, but they will surely bring me a moment of clarity and peace. as someone who has been suicidal, this thought has continuously struck with me repeatedly. this song is just so beautiful it makes me feel like i'm floating on the sea. the strings, Ellie's beautiful soaring falsetto, the production aberration at around 4:24 where the left then right channel "pops"‚Ä¶ everything about this song is just perfect to listen to when i'm sad to make me feel more sad and i LOVE it.

**akanewasright** (10): Just purely thrilling.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I‚Äôm sorry, but this may be the perfect closing song. Ending with Ellie‚Äôs ethereal head voice was a killer choice.

**nooodisaster** (9): :(

**effervescentemu** (8.5): A killer ballad which manages to pull off both ethereal and emotional perfectly. It's a great representation of what made Halcyon era Ellie stand out - she truly forged her own unique sound and sold it with authenticity and actual emotion.



**vayyiqra** (8): This is a great ending to the album, and I feel weird because I like the bonus tracks, but I still feel like the "story arc" ends here. There are way too many versions of this album, and I like Halcyon Days better but the original is great too.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): makes me think she must have been lonely through this album. I feel sad for her

**twat\_brained** (7): i know people love this song but this album's beginning to fade in quality for me. thankfully the next three songs all pop off

**waluigiest** (7): maybe it‚Äôs fatigue from the volume of similar songs on the album but this doesn‚Äôt do much for me. Sounds pleasant but eh



**worlds\_okayest666** (5): Does this serve a purpose? Yes. Do I like it? Meh.

***DAE title pun?***

**ramskick** (8): my interest in this album is no longer dead in the water

**ManofOranges** (6.5): Kinda cute but it also sounds dead in the water

This song is so sad and I‚Äôm shook about it placing so low. The lyrics are really great, but it is kinda slow so I guess I‚Äôm not too surprised.

---
**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): despite being about 4 minutes long and me listening to it more than a few hundred times, it never really feels that long.

**effervescentemu** (9): Re-listening to this song took me back and smacked me directly in the teet! I forgot how damn sad and beautifully mournful it is - 'I think of dying all the time/But I've got joy to take my side/Fear is my favourite ride.'

**namiko\_shuuya** (9): I didn't expect the raw emotion

**nooodisaster** (8): "And this is far from joy." Ellie is actually so good with ballads. The way this builds to its final choir backing adds more power to the already emotional lyrics.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a really good but bittersweet song. I'm not sure why it's in all caps, but the title sure is ironic.

**1998tweety** (7.7): Cute lyrics

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I really hate her ‚Äúsee-ehn Stars‚Äù delivery. It sounds so unhealthy. Other than that, this song is great.

**passionfruits2** (7): No comments.

**ramskick** (7): I get some joy out of listening to this song

This song is SO weird but has a mythical and cool feeling to it. I‚Äôm not a fan of the ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd you go!‚Äù in the background but the rest is super cool and I like her pitched voice. It‚Äôs also the ideal song to point to when people say that this album isn‚Äôt alternative.

---
**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is a filler, but it's one of the rare moments where Ellie's full burd-like vocals are full-on present

**ManofOranges** (9): The verses sound so good I love how ethereal they sound but then the chorus is kind of a let down for me

**waluigiest** (9): kate bush headass

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): beautiful voice  heavenly sound to this one :)

**1998tweety** (7.4): Gorgeous vocals, unfortunately the chorus is just a little grating

**nooodisaster** (7): The weirdest song here, and when I listened to this album I'd always assume this was a bonus track. Really hard to rate tbh, it's so jumbled and muted yet beautiful in its own way.

**tapdancingpig** (7): This song has never quite connected with me.

**vayyiqra** (7): I can't imagine the album without this song, but I wish the chorus weren't so repetitive. : / Nice strings though.

**twat\_brained** (6.7): it feels like we're deep into the filler portion of the album now

**effervescentemu** (6): Probably my lest favourite on Halcyon. It sounds like drinking a bottle of cough syrup and becoming uncomfortably disoriented.

**letsallpoo** (6): remember when bridgit mendler was a thing. /u/mudkip1 do you remember?

**ramskick** (6): man I thought this song would be interesting based on the title.  Instead its level of entertainment is lost, just like Atlantis

Yikes. Why is this down here?????? I‚Äôm going to just chalk it up to the song being so late in the rate. The production is amazing and the lyrics are reminiscent of a feeling that we‚Äôre all chasing.

---
**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love drum n bass and i love Tove Lo, so this is an automatic pussy popper

**namiko\_shuuya** (9.5): I don't know why  I just felt connected

**passionfruits2** (8): This is going for too long. But it's all good grl.

**1998tweety** (7.7): I like the production on this but everything else is mediocre.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): the drum n bass is an improvement from the last few songs but still nowhere near the front half

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm not really grabbed by any of these bonus tracks, honestly. They're all just fine, but none of them stand out too much.

**waluigiest** (7): I‚Äôm kind of unsettled

**akanewasright** (6): This song feels like the producer wanted this song to be a bop, but Tove wanted it to be an optimistic ballad, and the producer just tried his best with what Tove gave him? Basically this song is a fucking mess.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): An okay D&B-esque track

this song feels SO long and the production is lazy. I like the end but that‚Äôs it.

**akanewasright** (10): This song won‚Äôt make it past day 2 because popheads can‚Äôt stand album cuts, but it deserves everything.

**MashLuke** (10): this instrumental is cool

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): I remember thinking this song was so boring, but the hook has always stuck with me, and the lyrics are an alum highlight. Also, I totally forgot about the xylophone interlude. Not sure how I did that.

**1998tweety** (8): I love the instrumentals on this, super different and stands out a lot. I will say though that the song goes on for way too long and that I hear "f*ggot" instead of "fair game" which is weird lol.

**nooodisaster** (8): Probably my favorite lyrics of the album.

**passionfruits2** (8): good song.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love the way she sings the verses to this. Also, the xylophone break is so random but I love it.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): a literal song like this is so refreshing after hearing Sia blend her syllables into one another for the past 13 minutes or so. not really into the xylophone solo or whatever the hell that was.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): she sounds pretty powerful  first time I heard this.

**worlds\_okayest666** (7): WHY does it take so long for there to be any sort of added elements in the chorus??? It feels so incomplete

one of her best vocal performances in the album IMO! It does feel kind of homogenous, though, which is probably part of the reason that it didn‚Äôt do so well in the rate.

Truly iconic start and I love how many phases the song goes through. The end is admittedly weaker than the rest, a point that other participants pointed out. Overall, this is just such a great album opening and a great rate opening too IMO; really embodies a lot of the atmosphere of the rate.

---
**MashLuke** (10): man what the heck is this song? The instrumental is so good and the vocals. Wow.

**nooodisaster** (10): Such a power move to open an album like this. The production is front and center on this experimental piece of pop that sounds more like a trailer song than radio fodder. A definite highlight.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): equal parts beautiful and breathtakingly haunting

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I haven‚Äôt heard this song in a while and it‚Äôs pretty unique, it‚Äôs brooding and cinematic up until the glittery drop which works damn well, surprised me for a bit.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I was confused why Ellie was included in an Alt Pop rate, this song tells me why. A great opener.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): a really stong album opener that sets the stage for the rest of the album pretty well

**tapdancingpig** (8): Ellie knows how to OPEN an album.

**vayyiqra** (8): I really like this as an opener and the bridge is great.

**waluigiest** (8): doesn‚Äôt say much, but it‚Äôs got a good atmosphere

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I listened to this album a lot in 9th grade, how did I never remember this?

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song is mostly valid for its opening seconds. I don‚Äôt love the rest of it. Like, it‚Äôs fine, the weird glitching is cool, ‚Äúif you never‚Äù is okay... but the opening seconds as an album opener is *perfect*

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): pretty standard for her

**effervescentemu** (6.5): Ellie opens Halcyon on a decidedly haunting note and I love how the production swells in intensity as the song progresses. However, the song lacks that extra punch and isn't all too memorable.



**ramskick** (6): I can't really say a word about this song

**rotating3Dtext** (6): it‚Äôs just kind of weird

***okay this is just factually untrue***

**passionfruits2** (6): Bad choice for a first song, starts the album badly, and makes me not want me to listen to it again.

passionfruits2: The day I listened to Halcyon I was actually really down. I put some low scores on songs that didn't deserve so. I actually like this song. Some of my scores, mainly for Halcyon, were low because I was in the worst mood possible, and the album wasn't really helping, which made me frustrated. I would actually give this 7.5 or 8 out of 10. 

I'm sorry if I ruined the rate for the Ellie Goulding stans.

this would actually be a pretty good song. BUT the chorus is really weak, and a lot of the lyrics are generic at best. The production is really cool and the non-chorus vocals are quite strong. Popheads lives up to its name with the higher than expected score of this song IMO.

---
**1998tweety** (10): A massive bop, love the chorus in particular and it shows how autotune can actually add more to a song.

**hikkaru** (10): Ellie tends to get only one hit per album cycle and this was it for Halcyon (Days). A good pick for a hit single, it bops hard and I love the incorporation of the steel drum near the end

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a hit

**MashLuke** (10): hit

**twat\_brained** (10): the intro, the buildup, the crashing synths, the hooks, the melodies! i swear if Chandelier wasn't in this rate this would be my 11. I know it's clich√© but that's how much I love "Burn". Ever since I saw Ellie close her concert with this back in 2014 I've just loved this song like mad and it gives me such a rush when I hear it.

**passionfruits2** (9): WTF. This hidden BOP. I wasn't expecting THIS. Thank God there's a good track.

**ramskick** (9): yeah this song is great.  No pun needed.

**vayyiqra** (8): I feel weird about this song, because I like it, and it's one of her most successful songs (I even heard it last week) but I feel it doesn't really fit.

**effervescentemu** (7.8): Burn marked the transition of indie-pop Ellie to fully fledged pop Gouldigger. It's a faceless bop but I've definitely lost my shit to it at the clurb.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): Pure nostalgia

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this feels weirdly soulless and i've never been able to get into it for that reason

**worlds\_okayest666** (6): If I had a dollar for every time she said "burn", I'd be able to afford a non-used copy of Halcyon Days

**akanewasright** (5): Meh. It sort of bops, but it‚Äôs kind of boring?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Yeah I know everyone loves this track but holy shit is the chorus annoying, production dated when it dropped, and entire track generic as hell. This song and Love Me Like You Do plagued my radio listening experiences when they were played all the time.

**nooodisaster** (4): It's a fine pop song but so generic and bland.

**tapdancingpig** (4): This song is just so boring. I‚Äôm sorry, I just can‚Äôt get into this.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): trash

**letsallpoo** (0): ***the beginning of ellie's nosedive in quality***

I'm really surprised this made it so far, given how popheads feels about EDM. This is one of my favorite EDM songs ever. Just, jesus. The video is what really made me love this song so much. The first drop is a bit weak but the second drop more than makes up for it. The bridge and the outro are just heartbreaking to me. Together we fall.

**hikkaru** (10): I'm not entirely sure why this is being rated again after it flopped in its last rate but it's fine I'll gladly take another opportunity to give this the 10 it deserves

**MashLuke** (10): underrated song

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): either version is a 10, honestly

**effervescentemu** (9): Lucas Nord's production and Tove's voice seamlessly blend together on this pessimistic bop. It's a travesty I've never heard this in a club.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I think I love the opening line of this song a little too much. ‚ÄúI had one mission but I committed treason‚Äù is such a hilarious, but kind of evocative lyric? Either way, the song bops.

**1998tweety** (8.2): Pretty standard EDM dance track
