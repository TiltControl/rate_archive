what an album opener! It doesn’t really suit the tune of the album but it gets me hyped up so hard. I love the stylistic changes and production so much. My only complaint is that the amazing gunshot sounds aren’t in every pre-chorus!!! Should be top 10 IMO

---
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): if tove lo shot me i would be ok with it

**namiko\_shuuya** (9): upbeat and I’ve never heard this one!! Nice!

**radiofan15** (8.3): Prechorus (chorus?) is quite dissapointing but this is a really bouncy pro-gun BOP... the NRA would be proud

**1998tweety** (8): This bops a bit

**akanewasright** (8): This song is a grower, but it’s a HUGE bop, so it’s fine.

**effervescentemu** (8): What exactly is Tove's gun? Perhaps we'll never know...

**nooodisaster** (8): The "that's my gun" hook is the strongest thing here, and tbf it's excellent. I also do like how she starts motif here with "jump on my cloud".

**passionfruits2** (8): Great start.

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't even care if that trop-pop beat is overdone, this song is a B O P. I know it's about sex but the lyrics are really kind of dark.

**waluigiest** (8): yee haw get it started!!

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This song is a little disjointed, but it’s a bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): ??????

I like MOST of this song but the drop is mixed SO LOUD. The rest of it is so good, especially the strings throughout the track. Ugh, so close to being amazing.

---
**hikkaru** (10): This is an EDM/pop collaboration classic and the fact that y'all put this below Outside in that rate? i have to vomit

**MashLuke** (10): perfect edm song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Justice for the fucking EDM rate, Calvin Harris deserved so much better and outperformed all your faves so goodbye

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i want this song to impregnate me

**twat\_brained** (10): this reminds me I still need to listen to 18 Months. I should listen to a full Calvin album period. INYL, Sweet Nothing

**akanewasright** (9.9): This is probably my favorite Calvin Harris song.

**1998tweety** (9.5): A mega bop, Ellie's vocals are a perfect fit for this track.

**waluigiest** (9): yeah this is tasty

**effervescentemu** (8): Points deducted for the dated Calvin Harris production, but overall still goes off.

**passionfruits2** (8): The most underrated gym song.

**radiofan15** (7.5): I gave this one a 5.5 on the EDM/Pop Girl Collaboration Rate but now I'm increasing my score because this is not AS BAD as most of the deep cuts of the album

**ramskick** (7): I dig this song.  No pun needed

**vayyiqra** (7): I forgot this song existed, because I deleted it from my Spotify with the rationale that it's not really an Ellie Goulding song. It's not bad, though, if you like that sort of thing.

**namiko\_shuuya** (5): nostalgia but I didn’t like it much then. Better now that the radios don’t overplay it.

**nooodisaster** (3): Calvin Harris at his most bland.

Very mystical sound to this one; it’s seductive and powerful. The production is SO good, especially the violins. Best fifty shades song IMO.

---
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): These synths slap

**waluigiest** (8): this is really neat and the pre-chorus is great but the chorus is annoying

**radiofan15** (7.2): This movies are awful but they have the occasional bop here and there!

**passionfruits2** (5): A sequence of bad songs is unexcusable. I'm gonna give you three stars on Yelp.

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x2) bigenemies, NachoLiterary (5 x2) CreepyMannequin, TragicKingdom1 

---
Definite 11 contender. The pre-chorus is probably my favorite EVER, and the rest of the song is just as good. The fact that it was robbed to be a single is a crime against humanity. I can’t believe that the meaning of this song actually goes over some people’s head but the contrast of this song to the prior tracks on the album is perfect.

---
**MashLuke** (10): this is so captivating

**namiko\_shuuya** (10): She captures a feeling. Intense

**twat\_brained** (10): Blessed be Tove and her Swedish music making abilities. When I hear that opening riff and those drums I am just lost in the music and then when the chorus hits it's like a gigantic wave crashing into my senses. I love everything about it

**worlds\_okayest666** (10): There's an edit of this where the "not on drugs"/"just in love" are switched and I've spent far too long trying to find it.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Another mega bop that was robbed

**akanewasright** (8): Kind of a weird song and hook, but it definitely sticks in the head.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I really like the post-chorus (?) of this track, it’s really bombastic.

**vayyiqra** (8): I always imagined this song as being from the viewpoint of someone who's totally desperate and in denial [like, well, a drug addict], which is really emotional to me for personal reasons.

**radiofan15** (7.8): Although the drug-love methaphor is way overplayed I still liked this one, it's somewhat irresistible, especially with those ''aays'' at the chorus... also, ROLL CREDITS

**nooodisaster** (7): Not really single worthy, but fine as an album track.

**waluigiest** (7): your other songs beg to differ

**passionfruits2** (6): Please don't fuck this up Ms. Lo.

First song with an 8+ average! This is nice and chill. I was a bit surprised to see that it was such a fan favorite. But… after, many relistens, I can never actually remember how the song sounds like???

---
**effervescentemu** (10): Gorgeous/stunning/that bitch. Ellie is in peak bird-woman fluttery voiced form here - providing perhaps the most magically anthemic chorus in her discography.

**rosesmp3** (10): this slaps

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i want this sung at my funeral; a serious contender for an 11, honestly

**akanewasright** (9): I still remember this song mostly from the Divergent movie. Maybe that’s a bad mental connection, but this song still bops, so...

**vayyiqra** (9): This isn't the best song on the album, but it is one of the most emotional.

**1998tweety** (8.7): Damn this is good, the break in the middle was a bit unneeded though cause it stops the momentum of the song for no reason.

**passionfruits2** (8): Nice bop.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): isn't that the same hook from Coldplay's "Princess in China"? They sound similar to me. Apart from that, the soundscape is brilliant but I can't really understand Ellie.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Skrillex confirmed vampire.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): kinda edgy for her  I was surprised

**ramskick** (7): this song doesn't really pump My Blood

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Solid album track, if a little forgettable.

**waluigiest** (7): this song has a lot going on, and the majority of it is good

**radiofan15** (6.7): This sounds quite vapid TBH

**NachoLiterary** (5): sounds like enya... & that is, like, 1/4 of a compliment

How did this not become the instagram girl anthem? I have no idea. It’s so quotable. The explosive chorus and brash lyrics work so well together to create one of the most genuinely effective “love yourself” songs I’ve ever heard.

---
**effervescentemu** (10): Relatable queen!

**nooodisaster** (10): Amazing. The vulnerability she shows in the lyrics is so powerful.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the minor single remix was quite unnecessary but this still bops

**vayyiqra** (10): I'm really baffled how this song didn't chart at all anywhere. Tove Lo can write a really catchy hook, and the prechorus is one of the best examples. Also, the lyrics are relatable, well, as fuck.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): big mood

**1998tweety** (8.7): A robbed bop

**radiofan15** (8.5): I can't believe i'm enjoying this album this much, HOLY SHIT!

**ManofOranges** (8): Cute song. A moment.

**tapdancingpig** (8): ...who thought this would be a good single? It’s relatable as hell, but... huh

**waluigiest** (8): she really is a sad gril

**namiko\_shuuya** (6.5): she's good at being relatable

**passionfruits2** (6): Well. You ruined my good mood.

painfully generic. I never liked this one very much at all.

---
**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song would honestly be an 11 if it was in the main rate. It just feels so good

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i really wanna give this a 10 because in hindsight, it should be perfect. but something about the combination of Tove's sad-girl-suited-voice and the song's hopeful post-apocalyptic vibe just does not mix n match

**twat\_brained** (8.6): let's avenge the EDM collab rate results

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I’m still not in love with this drop, but everything else in the song just works so well.

**1998tweety** (8): solid bop

I had so many 11 contenders in this album. The total, soul-crushing sadness of this song, the relevance to my real life, and the many, many times this song made me cry are what finally tipped the scales towards it for me. I feel like you haven’t really experience heartbreak until you’ve had the kind of utter defeat portrayed in this song, when you would do anything for the person. The fact that this barely slipped into the top 10 is amazing to me. This is also the last non-single in the rate.

---
**namiko\_shuuya** (11): amazing  her best work on the album

**1998tweety** (8.6): Why were so many of her bop singles robbed?

**ManofOranges** (8.5): The Proclaimers are quaking in their kilts

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Tove said FUCK Vanessa Carlton lives. the desperation in her voice just sells it for me

**passionfruits2** (8): GOOD.

**waluigiest** (8): she’s kind of like a hornier, sadder Taylor Swift

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Vanessa honey-

**vayyiqra** (7): [Insert Vanessa Carlton meme] No really, this song isn't one of the best, but it's still good.

**radiofan15** (6.2): Once again repeated metaphors... but this time they aren't that effective

**NachoLiterary** (6): it's fine, but it sounds like generic pop that you would hear playing in the dollar store

very fun song but I’m really surprised at how high this song got!!!!! It reminds me of a Carly Rae Jepsen song, so I guess that makes more sense. The bridge, in particular, screams Carly.

---
**TragicKingdom1** (11): didn't expect to give this my 11 going in but it's a super finely crafted pop song

**hikkaru** (10): bop! It sounds so fun but the lyrics are not and I like that dichotomy

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just so cute. Also I swear I've heard it from something somewhere but I just can't remember for the life of me.

**MashLuke** (10): I love this instrumental so much

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): goodness gracious i can't seem to STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**worlds\_okayest666** (10): I was so, so close to giving this my 11

**akanewasright** (9): I wish this song caught on in the US instead of Burn. Like, I get why some people aren’t in love with the chipmunk vocals, but it’s all just so... bright and fun!

**effervescentemu** (9): This song sounds so damn happy - it's always evoked imagery of some elaborate dance sequence from an animated movie featuring forest creatures dancing through the treetops.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): always really enjoyed this one. not a fan of when my sister tries to play it on the piano

**1998tweety** (8.6): Mega bop

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I get why some people don’t love this, but I just find it too delectable to resist.

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): upbeat  not sure what feeling it makes me feel

**nooodisaster** (8): Fan favorite for a reason, this is dangerously catchy while still feeling distinctly Ellie.

**vayyiqra** (8): I have nothing except that this is a B O P

**waluigiest** (8): yeah this is real

**radiofan15** (7.8): Finally the light and happiness came back on this album!

**passionfruits2** (7): This is decent.

**ramskick** (7): Goodness Gracious this song is solid.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The production and verses on this are so soooo good, but the chorus is really bland unfortunately.

Hearing Flo Rida compared to the rest of the songs on this rate is SO jarring.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Bop, king Flo Rida can do no wrong.

**NachoLiterary** (10): wish i could give this an 11

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is probably the best song of all time

**worlds\_okayest666** (9): Flo Rida hits are a whole 'nother level of nostalgia for me

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I really love how kind of ominous Sia’s chorus made the rest of the song feel just through its inclusion in the song.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): his best song ngl

**twat\_brained** (7.3): lol remember like the 10 minutes Flo Rida was relevant

**radiofan15** (6.2): Hearing Sia giving her everything just to hear Flo Rida's lame-ass raping after is like eating caviar and washing your mouth with warm beer

Definitely one of the best songs on this album. It is a little bit generic but the lyrics are so good, and the chorus is one of the best on the album. One thing that I don’t like about it, though, is how Sia totally distanced herself from this song and video. It had so much potential!!!

---
**mcquillan64** (11): The keyboard!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): We love a combustion reaction between a hydrocarbon and oxygen gas to form water and carbon dioxide

**nooodisaster** (10): I just love this song so much the epic climactic production the ever moving hooks the emotional delivery the lyrics so much of this is the cumulation of the entire album in terms of theme and purpose and all for it to be paid dust by the gp.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): explosive chorus (ha ha)

**twat\_brained** (10): I've heard good things about this song so it'd better live up to the hype. EDIT: I've heard it in full, but I've had to check MetroLyrics to clarify the lyrics to the chorus. And I'm on a train right now so I can't check the music video, but I'll be sure to do that once I arrive back home.

**1998tweety** (9.5): A massive bop, good singles were picked (but the rest of the album falls flat).

**tapdancingpig** (9.3): Honestly, this song is a giant bop that deserves better.

**akanewasright** (9): I get why this wasn’t as big of a hit as the other two singles (this one doesn’t have the same kind of in your face lyrical content and it doesn’t have a great video), but it deserves the world.

**NachoLiterary** (8): powerful, beautiful song

**worlds\_okayest666** (7.6): This feels (production-wise) like a better version of Eye of the Needle

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): very passionate

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Exxon has left the chat.

**vayyiqra** (7): I used to think this song sounded like generic mom-pop, like the background music for something. I still kind of think that, but it's not a bad song.

**waluigiest** (7): uninspiring but her vocals are still unparalleled

**passionfruits2** (6): lesson learned: celebrities don't know how to pump gas.

**radiofan15** (5.2): Another Sia song composed on the Sia template

This is probably the best Sia song in the rate to me, not gonna lie. Easy 10. Great vocals, production, and it’s so dancy.

This is the best pop-dubstep song ever (except for maybe Alive by Krewella). The variety of instruments is what makes the production so good; the strings, the way that there is harmony even on downbeats, and the way it all wraps around Ellie’s voice. The lyrics are also great and very quotable to me. The placement is a bit lower than I would like, though. I thought it would do way better.

---
**effervescentemu** (11): Perhaps my favourite Ellie track of all time. The intensity and build up of that pre-chorus followed by the production crashing down on you is sonic ecstasy.

**hikkaru** (11): a SLAPPER through and through. Love the blend of the harp with the intense electronic production and how this song builds from calmer verses into a bigger chorus, and that wobbling bridge, and that part at the end with the escalating buzz that is SO satisfying. I don't think this will win, but it really should, because this song is just so amazingly produced and I'll be bopping to this for the rest of eternity.

**akanewasright** (10): This may be the biggest bop of the decade, to be honest.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song was seriously a contender for my 11 the production is immaculate

**nooodisaster** (10): If anyone rated this less than an 8 I'm turning in a figure 8 and walking away https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/265/714/fd1.gif

**ramskick** (10): this song should be called Figure 10 because that's the only number I can think of when I listen to this song.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Piano based Dubstep never caught on, but between this song and Supernatural by Kesha, I think there’s a damn good case that it should have.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this is how you do early 10s EDM production without aging poorly

**twat\_brained** (10): I never understood why Figure 8 wasn't the opener. Or at least track 8 on the album. Ellie opened her Halcyon Tour with this so it would've made perfect sense. What doesn't make as much sense is the music video; I've just watched it, and for some reason I thought it'd be far more grandiose; this song is a personal Ellie favourite of mine so I feel a bit disappointed. Nonetheless this song remains a towering achievement for Ellie in my regard

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): an explosive song that i think a lot of people listening to this for the first time would be scalped

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this song even though it emotionally devastates me. Fuck me up, queen.

**1998tweety** (9): Figure 8? More like Figure 9. Love the heavy production on this.

**MashLuke** (9): badass

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): anyone else remember the bop figure 8 song from schoolhouse rock

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): it’s so repetitive but also catchy, what do

**letsallpoo** (8): HAHA I AM VERY FUNNY BECAUSE I AM GIVING THIS AN 8 AND IT HAS AN 8 IN THE TITLE. UPCARLYS TO THE LEFT

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): kinda sad in a good way

**waluigiest** (8): “not too old to die young” lyrics are a little trite but slaps nonetheless

**radiofan15** (7.9): It's nice I guess but I don't understand the love for it... everyone seems to treath this one as if it was the second coming of Christ

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Would love to give this an 8 for the meme but it’s not that good

**worlds\_okayest666** (7): It feels wrong to rate this song anything other than an 8. But I'm gonna do it anyways.

**NachoLiterary** (6): one of the better songs on the album

Wow. For the first time in a while, this song isn’t even close to second. Still, this is always #2 in my heart. Such a totally era-defining song for me. One of the first electropop songs I truly loved and I always will love it. I think that its spot is deserved in the top 5, still, and I’m happy to see that we get to rate it again. This very well might be the last time; I can’t think of any other places we could rate it.

**radiofan15** (11): Harmony Korine SNAPPED when he put this one on the end credits of Spring Breakers

**vayyiqra** (11): Even though this song doesn't really need to be on the album, I'm glad it is because we're probably never going to rate [Bright] Lights, and it's one of my favourite pop songs ever. It also has a lot of meaning to me knowing that it's about her childhood anxiety when my brother has some really severe phobias and he likes Ellie Goulding too, so it reminds me of him. Maybe it's a predictable choice for my 11, but whatever. It's a great song and deserves to win.

**effervescentemu** (10): The unlikely breakthrough hit that started it all remains a timeless groove that bewitches the mind and ensnares the senses.

**hikkaru** (10): This is absolute synthpop perfection. It's just so tightly made yet feels so breezy. A definite 11 contender and I would love to see this pull out a win after it's infamous #2 spot from last time

**letsallpoo** (10): outsold fadele

**ManofOranges** (10): I know this song is iconic because I heard it playing over the radio when I was at my local pool one time and it caught my attention and that's an achievement

**MashLuke** (10): perfect pop song

**nooodisaster** (10): So this really is the new Rolling in the Deep where I'm gonna keep giving it a 10 even tho I rated it like 13 times, huh?

**passionfruits2** (10): THIS IS THE BEST THING ELLIE GOULDING HAS DONE (SO FAR FROM WHAT I LISTENED)

**skargardin** (10): Few songs come close to this level of perfection. Sends me every single time.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): rolling in the deep shaking

**TragicKingdom1** (10): so this is finally gonna win huh

**twat\_brained** (10): I mean every non-remix version of this is pretty great if you ask me.

**ramskick** (8): I would love to dance to this song with flashing lights

**waluigiest** (8): thank you miss Ellie

**1998tweety** (7): This is a cute bop but wasn't it on her previous album?

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): heard a remix of this once  best remix and best single to dance to

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is like… okay? The opening is really nice but every time it starts up I just want to listen to the godlike Bassnectar remix instead (which should’ve been in the bonus rate ??).

Really genre defining to me. I remember hearing this song for the first time while playing Lyroke like 10 years ago… it was really fun to listen to then and it is really fun now. I really do love the production on this song. It shows how you can use vocal cuts without making them annoying, and the marching synths work so well. Also, “I don’t think I need you!” is iconic.

---
**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Amazing! The song just builds so well to the final chorus

**akanewasright** (10): This song is just a joyful little bop.

**letsallpoo** (10): i remember my friend messaging me about this song and how good it was and how ellie goulding finally has more than 1 good song (the previous one was "lights"). this was in 2016

**ManofOranges** (10): A legendary song

**MashLuke** (10): this is such a cute song

**radiofan15** (10): DAMN IT ELLIE, YOU DIN'T HAVE TO RIP MY WIG OFF LIKE THAT

**tapdancingpig** (10): The US should have made this skinny dipping anthem a hit.

**vayyiqra** (10): One of her best (and catchiest) songs. Its only fault is that the chorus is repetitive, but it doesn't bother me. [Side note: how could she have known anything in '86 if that was the year she was born? ??]

**waluigiest** (10): wow the way this song builds and grows is masterful. The way she yells and builds to the final hook? Woah

**worlds\_okayest666** (10): This song makes me think of summer and/or cable commercials

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Only #47 on the Hot 100? This is why the U.S. has no taste. also if i'm honest i only really came around to this song after Fifth Harmony's X Factor rendition oop

**1998tweety** (9): Bop, this song builds up so well and has an awesome release.

**effervescentemu** (9): Legendary bop for that last chorus alone featuring the iconic scream-sung 'I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE, I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE, I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE OHHHH YAHHHH'.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This would be a 10 but the chorus is a little too repetitive. The drop is great though

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i can't believe an entire song was born out of an ad-lib

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I do think this track is a bit overrated, but I do like the instrumental quite a bit. It’s dated but it’s explosive, and I respect that.

**NachoLiterary** (7): weak anthem

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): reminds me of the summer this came out and hanging with my friends.

SkyBlade79: # Halcyon

---

**Overall average**: 7.627

---

**TragicKingdom1**: Consistently great hooks, production and vocals. Ellie became my favorite pop girl at the time this was released. Also, Delirium does NOT deserve hate simply because it wasn't quite as good as this!!! [Grade: A]

**hikkaru**: i'm sorry if it seems like my scores for this album are inflated i just really really love it

**akanewasright**: This album was basically the soundtrack to my middle school experience (well, this and Blackout). Ellie just... made me feel things. Plus, her voice is just cool as hell.

**waluigiest**: I’ll be honest and say I’ve never actively chosen to listen to Ellie Goulding. This album has some great moments and is good, if not generic at times, sad girl club music.

**vayyiqra**: I'm so glad we got to do Halcyon. I listened to this album probably more than anything in 2017, when I had a really bad breakup and was incredibly depressed. I streamed it almost every night. Now it doesn't have the same emotional reaction with me, but it's still one of my favourite albums ever, and my favourite by Ellie. Ironically the first time I heard it I didn't think it was that great, but that was because it was so long [the deluxe Halcyon Days that has like 25 tracks]. It's too bad this version doesn't have "Tessellate", which is amazing, but the rate is rather long as it is.

**CreepyMannequin**: A fine album that I could definitely imagine myself coming back to.

**nooodisaster**: Back when Ellie was talented, what happened gurl??

**ManofOranges**: This album is really good. I do prefer the songs that are more upbeat and I personally think that the slower ones are just kind of a drag but the production on here is grade a. Ellie definitely knew what she was doing with this one.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove**: i have waited about 2 years for this fucking album to be rated. one of my absolute favorite releases and basically the main reason why i got into indie-pop in the first place. unfortunately, i think this is peak "Classic Ellie" as her fourth studio album doesn't seem to be returning to this sound, which i think is fine, but definitely something a lot of fans have been clamoring for over her years of disappearance

**twat\_brained**: I have a copy of the album from 2012, I think my mom got it while on business in Ireland. Funnily enough we saw Ellie at the O2 in 2014 with my Dad on our last day in London for March break. Naturally our sisters were mega jealous.

First, I do like the version with The Weeknd much more. That one is a 10, but this one is still a very, very solid song. I attribute most of that to Diplo’s outstanding production with such a good use of a vocal sample, but Sia herself also serves great vocals, especially on the pre-chorus, and even better lyrics.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Another highlight, a really good follow up to Chandelier that sounds similar enough but still different.

**ManofOranges** (10): Shia Labeouf really kinda served in this video not gonna lie

**MashLuke** (10): love this

**NachoLiterary** (10): love love love since the first time i heard it

**nooodisaster** (10): Okay so explain this: Before the solo version, Elastic Heart was a Hunger Games soundtrack song featuring The Weeknd. On Spotify, it credits Abel with songwriting for the Hunger Games version, but not the 1000FoF version. But literally the only lyrical differences are changing "Then another one bites the dust" to "And another one bites the dust". So Abel, why the songwriting credit? #popheadsExpose

**passionfruits2** (10): I honestly gave this a 10 because the clip had Shia LaBeouf.

**radiofan15** (10): The Hunger Games version with The Weeknd outsold but this is fantastic too

**tapdancingpig** (10): Bop of the century, honestly. Getting rid of The Weeknd was a GREAT choice for this song, too.

**vayyiqra** (10): This song both devastates me and makes me feel hopeful at the same time, and that's impressive. I have a couple of minor quibbles about the lyrics, but this song is so good that I overlook them.

**waluigiest** (10): she’s so strong!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The original on the Hunger Games soundtrack is better but my god is the production on this stellar. Sia and Diplo are an unstoppable combo.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the weeknd version >

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Tove was onto something when she called this her favorite song

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): connected to the chorus

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Honestly, I am sometimes a fan of the "Wall of Sound" approach this song takes, but not here. It just honestly sounds like a mess at points

quite literally pop perfection. Just wow. What an AMAZING song. One of the best pop instrumentals I’ve ever heard, such a bombastic chorus, lyrics on point… I do wish that we had the demo version, or that the bridge was better, but DESPITE that it’s still perfection. Ugh. Tove’s mind.

---
**akanewasright** (10): I never really got into this song when it was big, but honestly, it’s a delight. This was the obvious second single choice.

**effervescentemu** (10): A transcendent hoe anthem and the soundtrack to millions of benders.

**hikkaru** (10): Electropop perfection, the perfect song to be Tove's only non-Habits solo hit in the US

**MashLuke** (10): this takes the worst out of me. The worst.

**namiko\_shuuya** (10): always gonna be a thot song. Not sorry

**nooodisaster** (10): Pop perfection and really that's all I need to say.

**passionfruits2** (10): B is for Bussy, as in my bussy, which you destroyed. O is for Only, cause only you could have done this. P is for Please slay me with this track. B-O-P.

**radiofan15** (10): Horny Queen really makes my bussy wet with her BOPS

**twat\_brained** (10): why the hell this is not a bigger hit than Habits I will never know. Best song on the album and honest to God Tove's 3rd best behind disco tits and Out of my Head.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the evolution of this song from the demo is so impressive, but it also showcases what the artist initially envisioned a song is

**vayyiqra** (10): Even though I heard "Habits" first, this song is what got me into Tove Lo. I randomly heard it playing during orientation week, and the "day drunk into the night" hook got stuck in my head and I just had to figure out what it was. Also, lowkey the countermelody on the synth during the chorus is one of the best things about the song. This is pop perfection. [At least, the uncensored version is.]

**waluigiest** (10): I love this chorus and think about it a lot

**1998tweety** (9.5): Sexual bop

**ramskick** (9): my body talks (dances) when listening to this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): boppppp

**ManofOranges** (8): I don't hate this song but to me it's actually kinda weak compared to some other songs on this album. Not bad by any means though

**1998tweety** (10): Masterpiece

**akanewasright** (10): Basically perfect, got me to pay attention to Sia (even if I didn’t pursue any albums until 1000FOF came out.

**MashLuke** (10): bop

**radiofan15** (10): A CLASSIC, A BOP, A GEM... ugh their minds

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song invented titanium

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a pussy popper

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): I still have a special place in my heart for this song.

**waluigiest** (9): thank you pitch perfect

**twat\_brained** (8.2): good but overrated

**passionfruits2** (8): THE MOTHER OF ALL GYM SONGS.

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't have time to do the bonus rate, so I'm just going to rate this song because I've heard and like it. Sure it's overplayed, but it's a bop, and I can't get enough of Sia's self-empowerment anthems. I need that right now after all the emotional songs in this rate.

SkyBlade79: Some fun facts about the top 2!

The #1 track has almost a 0.25 higher average than the #2 track.

The #1 track has too many 11s for the program to even show 10s.

The #2 track has more 10s than the #1 track. #2 has 26, #1 has 22

The #1 track only has a 1.2 controversy score, the second lowest in the entire rate. The lowest was Elastic Heart with a 1.18 controversy.

The #1 track had a 10+ average and under 1 controversy for the first month. If I had ended the rate at that time, it would've given us our highest and least controversial score ever.

Undoubtedly one of the best radio hits I’ve ever heard. I didn’t really get into Tove until Talking Body, but the cultural impact that this song had is undeniable. I don’t know how long it had been or how long it will be for us to get a hit this totally RAW and powerful. The production is amazing, especially if you listen to it without vocals. The chorus is a total earworm and the emotion of this song is palpable. A completely rightful winner.

---
**akanewasright** (11): I low key think it’s hilarious that this song was projected to a bunch of soccer moms in suburban America over the radio. And given how fucking huge this song was, they ate it up like Tove Lo’s Twinkies. This song kind of traumatized me when I heard it on the community pool’s speakers, but I quickly learned to appreciate how catchy it was, and now I love it pretty much unconditionally. It’s become one of my go to songs to test out headphones with (it’s low key really well produced).

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): This song is a great example of how Tove's honest writing can really amplify the feelings in a song. The writing allows for moments to feel natural and have a lasting effect, in a sense. The production sounds great and the echoing in the chorus is really well done.

**MashLuke** (11): this song will always be one of my favorite songs ever. Thank you Tove.

**passionfruits2** (11): YASSS TOVE LO!!!! SLAY MAMAAAAA!!!! YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUUUUUUUUL!!!

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I love Tove Lo

**skargardin** (11): Her songwriting and vulnerabiity have never shone as bright as they do on this track, it's absolutely fantastic.

**tapdancingpig** (11): I love this song so much. I love the weird hypnotic, dreary mood it creates. It pulls you into Tove’s world so much - the producers and writers created the right dreary yet addictive soundscape to support the theming of the song. She sounds great on this song, and the hook she wrote sticks in your head so nicely well. But of course, the star of the show is the lyric. I’m continuously surprised by how amazingly sharp the lyrics are, and honestly, she has better pronunciation than most native English speakers, so she forces you to listen to every last painful word. Honestly, I should probably be giving my 11 to an Ellie song, but this song is just too brilliant for me to ignore it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): life hit better when this was top 3 on the hot 100

**worlds\_okayest666** (11): I used to hate this song. I now wonder what crack I was smoking to think this song was anywhere near bad

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this song is so so good. It's so raw and emotional, the lyrics are hard hitting, and it bops too. Another contender for my 11.

**hikkaru** (10): original version outsold hippie remix wbk

**ManofOranges** (10): Such a good song ugh we love depression

**namiko\_shuuya** (10): one of her top songs

**nooodisaster** (10): I remember when I finally decided to listen to this song even with its generic party title, and wow. I was blown away by how blunt the lyrics were, how emotional the song was, and how much pain she could sing with. Still just as powerful.

**radiofan15** (10): where was this Horny Queen excellence when I was suffering though Blue Lips?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is such a bop and 17 year old me was truly shook when she dropped that first line

**twat\_brained** (10): Tove: and i drank up all my money, tasting kinda lonely; 16-year-old-me: (https://imgur.com/a/xwEsYq5)[**YOU'RE GONE AND I GOTTA STAY HIGH ALL THE TIME TO KEEP YOU OFF MY MIND, OOH, OOH**] the millennial whoop is fucking killer here and Tove knows it. If this is not top 5 fuck r/popheads' lives

**waluigiest** (10): Ever though I could relate to 0% of this song, it was the anthem to my senior year of high school

**vayyiqra** (8): I've heard this song so many times, but it never gets old somehow. I can't really relate to the lyrics, but they feel honest.

And, here’s our #2! This song is obviously a fan favorite and one of the most recognizable songs in the rate. The production is really great and I’m not surprised at this placing so high. okay… my score might be a bit controversial. I’ve never liked this song at all, and it’s almost entirely because of Sia’s voice. How she drops the consonants off of almost every word in the chorus, the almost unintelligible verses… just ugh. Also, her voice hurts my head in the chorus. I think the production and post chorus are the only good parts in this song. The rest is from it being overplayed.  I’ll let other people say how good this song is!

---
**JunkyGS** (11): Honestly iconic. Only choice any reasonable person could make for an 11. Besides Lights maybe...

**ManofOranges** (11): I was fairly certain this was going to be my 11 since the beginning of this rate. The only contender was Figure 8 but ultimately I just had to give it to this song. Chandelier is truly a feat and a pure expression of carthasis and it's truly amazing.

**nooodisaster** (11): This song has so many reasons I love it that are way to personal to share, but one listen is all it takes to see how amazing this song is.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): I really thought this was Rihanna for like half a year but my god is this song so good. I originally found the counting generic but now it just is so perfect, and that chorus is incredible. Sia’s so great live and this song slapped so hard when I saw her.

**twat\_brained** (11): …wait this didn't win a single Grammy? Not even SOTY? I like Stay With Me and all but whoever chose it over Chandelier is a moron. If this is not your 11 you have no taste.

**1998tweety** (10): Love this song, the first time I heard it on the radio I thought it was super weird and unconventional but I kept wanting to hear it over and over again. Def a contender for my 11.

**akanewasright** (10): This song is somehow both ridiculously addictive and really hard to listen to. Sia sells every last syllable of it, wailing away with the best of them.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): The power in this song is actually astounding

**hikkaru** (10): okay.... I'm going to be honest here - I REALLY do not want this to win because I very much stan Ellie and Tove, with Halcyon (Days) being in my top 5 albums and QOTC being something I really enjoy too. Meanwhile, I don't really love Sia at all and her album is by far the weakest out of these three in my opinion. But Chandelier is just such a powerful song, I can't give anything less than a 10 to her screaming vocals filled with pain and the great production led by booming percussion and that roaring electronic synth line. While I may not love her, Sia is definitely a very good artist and this song becoming an iconic hit was what she deserved. I'd love it so so much if Figure 8 or Burn or Lights or Habits or Talking Body could win over this because all of those are among my favourite songs ever, but this is for sure deserving of a 10.

**MashLuke** (10): bop

**passionfruits2** (10): slay.

**radiofan15** (10): Maddie's mother truly did that!

**vayyiqra** (10): I liked this song, then I found out it was about alcoholism, and that just make me like it more. I love how Sia isn't afraid to sing about all kinds of dark things she's experienced and how honest her lyrics are. This song is a classic.

**waluigiest** (10): sis the vocals!

**worlds\_okayest666** (10): Ahm gohna sween frahna chehndolee

**rosesmp3** (9): i love this song but everytime i hear it i think of that one video featuring dobby

**tapdancingpig** (9): I was ridiculously happy to see that Sia, the singer from that Titanium song I loved so much, finally had a hit again. Then I heard it, and I was completely enraptured. This is one of the best pop songs of the decade, one of the best videos in that time, and is among Sia’s best pop songs.

SkyBlade79: # Queen of the Clouds

---

**Overall average**: 7.545

---

**TragicKingdom1**: I really like Tove Lo's aesthetic but she's always been held back by poor production or just randomly very uninteresting songs. This is her weakest album because those problems pop up more frequently than they should. There's some good songs on here though. [Grade: B-]

**selegend**: some amazing tracks and some absolute stinkers

**akanewasright**: I’m so glad I finally got to listen to this album. I’d been meaning to listen to it since I finally began to appreciate Habits, but I’d always stopped after Like Em Young (which I now like?). It’s probably the most inconsistent album in the rate, but it’s got some of the highest highs as well as that fucking remix.

**waluigiest**: I was expecting to like this album more

**vayyiqra**: I slept on this album for a while because I thought Tove Lo seemed kind of crass and edgy, and it wouldn't be my thing. I was surprised that I ended up really liking it, and it's a surprisingly emotional and vulnerable album. I didn't really like Lady Wood [it's good, it's just not that memorable] but I've listened to this album quite a bit. I can still never decide if I like the cover or not though.

**CreepyMannequin**: An excellent debut! Although I prefer Lady Wood, Tove really knocked it out of the park with QOTC.

**ManofOranges**: I do like a majority of the songs on this album but you know what it's just sooooo long. By the time I get to Love Ballad or Paradise I'm just surprised about how it's not over yet. And it really should end after Paradise honestly because I don't think the other songs are anything special. The album's still good though.

**twat\_brained**: I would play this a lot in 11th grade but I'm forgetting just how much it falls apart after Habits.

**radiofan15**: HORNY QUEEN snapped... DAMMNIT now i'm gonna have to give her another opportunity [B ]

SkyBlade79: # 1000 Forms of Fear

---

**Overall average**: 7.699

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a weird album to me because the songwriting is consistently great but some of these songs should have been given to other artists. I think overall I lean towards liking it a fair bit though. Plus Chandelier is one of the most iconic songs of the decade !!! [Grade: A-]

**akanewasright**: This was one of the first albums I listened to when I first got Spotify, and while I didn’t quite *get* the album then, I still loved it and I still have nostalgia for it, and now I’m more able to appreciate the songwriting and the stuff on mental illness

**waluigiest**: This album is amazing and I know it’s going to get done dirty :(

**vayyiqra**: This is one of the albums that got me into pop. Every song on it is good, and that says a lot about Sia's talent as a songwriter. I first heard of her in the early 2000s and was surprised when she suddenly had so much success with this album a decade later. I don't listen to her much anymore, but I really respect her as an artist and person.

**CreepyMannequin**: A few knockout tracks but bogged down by tracks that just don’t do it for me.

**nooodisaster**: There's probably only like 4 forms of fear here, but it's alright.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove**: this album has really high-high to the point that they are indeed career defining, but man the fillers drag this album down so much

**radiofan15**: At least she was kind enough to spread out the obvious highlights here and there to prevent this quite samey album to fail as a listenign experience... although I don't regret the listening [B]

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: no thanks

vayyiqra: Late, but I just have so many *feelings*.

1) Ellie got robbed, you flops

2) The single biases is real as always

3) But still, thanks so much to /u/SkyBlade79 for hosting this rate and allowing us to rate three of the best alt-pop albums ever, and three of my favourites of all time! Even if my fave lost, the top 5 were all great songs and we are better people for having rated them.

oh and 4) the most robbed song besides "Lights" was "Got Love"

deleted: “Dead In The Water” finishes at 43. **43!!!!!!** That LP is fully my number 1 of the decade and I just don’t know what to think my heart is smooshed. At least she had the most songs in the Top 10

vayyiqra: A bunch of my faves on it went out *way* too early and honestly I am still not okay

vayyiqra: Tove Lo literally titled a subsection of her album "The Pain" but nothing was like the pain Ellie stans felt when the results were revealed.

deleted: “Got Love” is GREEEAT also
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/elhcu0f/]

=====

SkyBlade79: Got love was a casualty of the rate being too long :(. Single bias was definitely real, in some forms. Remember that the first two songs out were singles! At least we had one non-single in the top 10
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/elhvwzx/]

=====

vayyiqra: I know it's a bit late now but I think it would've been better to cut all the bonus tracks. Three ~45 minute LPs is about the longest I can handle for one sitting at least. Just in case you ever host another rate, which I would totally do.
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/eljn0lv/]

=====

SkyBlade79: Oh, I totally agree. I added them last second. I really forgot how much people procrastinate on these things. You're **REALLY** not supposed to listen to them all at one time but people will do that.
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/eljn4nd/]

=====

vayyiqra: Doing rates is a lot of work if you write a comment for each song (which I always do) and doing them in one sitting is probably the only way many of us get them done. It is definitely better to do them over a couple of days though. Ideally it's also better to listen to the songs at least twice because scores can change with repeat listens.
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/eljnbtx/]

=====

SkyBlade79: Yeah. You'd think that 49 days would be enough but people want to do one sitting. I learned my lesson
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/eljni21/]

=====

deleted: OKAY BUT HOW THE FUCK DID SUMMIT GET LAST IN THE BONUS RATE???

WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF TASTE OR LACK THEREOF
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/elheo1b/]

=====

vayyiqra: I'm speculating but I'm thinking the rate was too long because of all the bonus tracks, so by the time we got to the bonus rate proper, many of us either just didn't do it (guilty) or put no effort into it and just gave a high score to "Titanium" because it was the only song we all know.
[/r/popheads/comments/bftmm5/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_3_whats_the_worst/elherer/]

=====

SkyBlade79: Yeah, that contributed. It was very apparent in how toves tracks went out too.

Regardless, I think summit would still be last either way lol
