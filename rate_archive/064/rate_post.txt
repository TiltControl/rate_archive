##Welcome to the Alternative Pop Queens Rate!


This rate is for some of the most popular and impactful female pop singers who still maintain a mostly alternative sound. All of these artists have had huge influence in the music industry, from worldwide hits to their many songwriting credits.


Hey everyone! I’m /u/SkyBlade79, and I’m so excited to finally host this rate. I hope that everything runs great and we get an amazing reveal. All of that depends on y’all have good taste, of course, so it’s unlikely!


For now, this rate is due by midnight on April Fool’s Day – April 1st.  Here is the [submission link] (https://goo.gl/RVXjhF), if you don’t think you need to read anymore! Not counting interludes or the bonus tracks, this rate is for 47 songs.


The basis of this rate is female alternative pop singers who, while staying in the alternative stream, have had commercial success. Some are more consistently successful than others in this rate (billboard 138 O_O), of course, but they’ve all had their moments.


This rate has been in development for two and a half years, as I submitted it to rate suggestion threads again and again. During that time, it’s gone through a lot of changes. It has always been Tove Lo vs Ellie Goulding, but the albums rate and the third artists have changed a lot. The third artists changed were MØ, Halsey, Banks, Lights, and Sia.


Just a heads up, we are NOT doing Halcyon Days or Queen of the Clouds: Blueprint because they’re so much longer than 1000 Forms of Fear and I’d like to keep the albums about the same length.

###Ellie Goulding - Halcyon

**Release Date: October 5th, 2012**

**Billboard 200 Chart Peak: #9**

**Album Certifications: UK 4x Platinum, RIAA Platinum** 

**Song Certifications: “Burn”, “Anything Could Happen”, “I Need Your Love” & “Lights” – RIAA Platinum, “Hanging On”, “Summit” – RIAA Gold**

**Metacritic: 69/100**
*Halcyon* is English singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding’s second album. It was a huge worldwide hit, topping the UK charts and earning a top 10 spot on the US Billboard 200. Ellie’s team certainly took advantage of this to no end, with countless editions of this album released. There are country-specific bonus tracks, a deluxe version, the 2013 reissue of the album “Halcyon Days”, the 2014 reissue of *THAT* album, and a lot more random editions thrown out everywhere. Regardless, I think that it was definitely worth it. This album has a lot of great standouts and is cohesively very, very good. Moreover, it has that distinct electropop sound thanks in part to producers Jim Eliot, Monsta, and Billboard. Goulding is the lead writer on every track of the album other than Ariel Rechstaid-penned “Hanging On”. 

Ellie’s beautiful, elflike voice is highlighted throughout the album as it spans a lot of different sounds. The album consists of a great mix of pure electropop with “Hanging On” and “Figure 8”, synthpop in “Anything Could Happen” and “Atlantis”, and a veritable amount of more strip-backed, heartfelt tracks like “Explosions” and “Joy”.

This album received generally positive reviews, with a Metacritic score 4 points higher than her debut album, “Lights”. On the UK singles chart, “Anything Could Happen”, “Figure 8”, and “Explosions” peaked at 5, 33, and 13, respectively. “Burn”, off of Halcyon Days, reached #1 on the UK chart, #13 on BB100, and 1.3 billion youtube views. “Goodness Gracious” achieved #16 in the UK, and “Lights” achieved #2 on Billboard (and Popheads) and #49 in the UK.

I’m using the tracklist from the North American 2013 Digital Edition because it has her #1 hit single “Burn” in it, as well as the amazing “Lights” and fan favorite “Goodness Gracious”. Note that the video for Hanging On has Tinie Tempah in it, but we aren’t rating that version.

###Tove Lo – Queen of the Clouds

**Released on: September 24th, 2014**

**Billboard 200 Chart Peak: #14**

**Certifications: UK Silver, RIAA Platinum**

**Song Certifications: “Habits” & “Talking Body”- RIAA Platinum**

**Metacritic: 73/100**
*Queen of the Clouds* (or QOTC) is Swedish singer-songwriter Tove Lo’s first solo studio album. This album is very near and dear to my heart – I would consider it my favorite album of all time, evidenced by my ratings for it. The album came shortly after (and includes tracks from) Tove Lo’s first EP, *Truth Serum*. This album is unique in this rate in that it is a concept album: it is based off of the stages of Tove’s relationships. There are three main sections with four songs each: “THE SEX”, “THE LOVE”, and “THE PAIN”. Tove is the lead writer on every song on the album and helped with a lot of the song production as well. The Struts, Ali Payami, and Shellback lend some more production credits. 

QOTC covers such a wide range of genres. Electropop and synthpop are the most common, but there are songs with dubstep, rock, and R&B influences. While Tove’s voice has a distinctive edge and a unique lilt to it, it’s certainly nowhere near as unique as Ellie Goulding’s or Sia’s. She makes up for this with bombastic production and stellar raw lyrics. This album is far more upbeat than the albums that it competes against, despite the content matter. The heartbreaking “Habits (Stay High)” and “Thousand Miles” both have explosive choruses that let you hear the impact of her heartbreak. The powerful choruses and hard-hitting lyrics span the entire album. “Not on Drugs” has my favorite pre-chorus ever, “Talking Body” is basically pop perfection, and “Run On Love” is sad in the best way. I love almost every song on this album like nothing else so it’s really hard for me to describe them in an objective manner. 

QOTC as an album had the least commercial success as an album on this rate, but some of the singles on the album outperform everything else on this rate in the USA. “Habits (Stay High)” peaked at #3 on the BB100 charts, and the Hippie Sabotage Remix of this song was a massive worldwide hit, with 675 million views on Youtube. “Talking Body” peaked at #12 on BB100. However, her label botched the release of other singles on this album in the worst way. “Not on Drugs” was supposed to be the second single, but was replaced with “Talking Body” at the last moment after the video for both songs had been replaced. Then it somehow happened again in the exact same way: the explosive power ballad “Timebomb” was meant to be the third single, replaced with “Moments” at the last second. All great songs that ended up with little promo, other than “Talking Body”. QOTC received great critic reviews.

This album has two versions: the main version, and the Blueprint version that has 24 tracks. We’re doing an edit of Blueprint version has some amazing songs on it. We aren’t rating THE SEX, THE LOVE, and THE PAIN for obvious reasons. We’re not rating “Heroes” (in the main rate) because it was just rated. We’re doing the original version of “Run on Love” because it’s vastly superior to the QOTC edit. We’re also rating the Hippie Sabotage remix of Habits because it is her biggest hit worldwide and is on the original tracklist.

I would also recommend very highly that you watch the videos for Run on Love, Out of Mind, and Habits to show just HOW raw Tove’s emotions really are; Out of Mind and Run on Love in particular, have amazing acting, especially in Tove’s facial expressions.

###Sia – 1000 Forms of Fear

**Released in: July 4th, 2014**

**Billboard 200 Chart Peak: #1**

**Certifications: UK Platinum, US Gold**

**Metacritic: 76/100**

*1000 Forms of Fear*, or 1000FOF, as I will call it, is Australian singer-songwriter Sia’s sixth studio album. Though Sia’s last two albums peaked at #37 and #26 on BB200, this album is what really rocketed Sia into the mainstream. Sia certainly had quite the mainstream presence; she showcased her unique personality by never showing her face on live TV, by wearing a short blonde wig that has since become her signature icon, and by teaming up time and time again with the child dancer Maddie Ziegler from *Dance Moms*. Every track on this album has Sia as the lead writer and Greg Kurstin as a co-writer and producer. 

Sonically, 1000FOF also covers a wide range of genres, with electropop bops like “Chandelier” and Diplo-produced “Elastic Heart”, pure alternative pop like “Free the Animal” and “Eye of the Needle”, and a few vocal-intensive, theatric tracks like “Straight for the Knife” and “Dressed in Black”. Sia’s voice is certainly the star of the album; it’s so unique and there’s really no one in the industry who sounds quite like her. She is able to add her unique sound to songs with reggae and hip hop influences or ballads with no issue.

1000FOF has very interesting chart and sales statistics. It is the lowest selling album in this rate by far with only 370,000 sales in the US. Despite this, it was the highest charting album on this rate, with a #1 US debut with only 52,000 units sold! This album spawned the wildly popular single “Chandelier”, with a #8 BB100 peak, 2 billion youtube views, and inclusion on many year end best lists. “Elastic Heart” peaked at #17 with the original alternate version that features The Weeknd from the *Hunger Games: Catching Fire* soundtrack. However, the rest of the singles from the album kinda flopped, with “Big Girls Cry” reaching 3 on Billboard bubbling under and “Fire Meets Gasoline” not charting in any way.

This album has the least songs on the rate because the deluxe versions just have remixes of the songs in the main album.

Fun fact, this is the only album I’ve ever bought. It was for my mom’s birthday.

Rules

•	Rate each song you listen to a score from 1 to 10. You may only use a single decimal point- i.e. 5.5, but not 5.55. 

•	You may give one score of 0 and one score of 11 over the ENTIRE rate. They can be on the same album, different albums, whatever you want. You don’t have to use these scores if you don’t want to, and you may not use them on the bonus rate.

•	You can include comments for each score! I highly, highly encourage this because it makes the reveal more interesting for everyone. They don’t have to be anything special; they can be as funny, as in-depth, or as short as you want.

•	Write comments in the correct format, as shown here. You can also do comments for albums in the same format (without a score):

**Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix): 0 This remix is garbage, Tove deserved a better breakout hit!**

•	This is how you incorrectly format comments. Don’t do this. The format above is the ONLY one that will work:

Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix): This remix is garbage, Tove deserved a better breakout hit! 0!

Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix): 0 (This remix is garbage, Tove deserved a better breakout hit!)

Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix): 0- This remix is garbage, Tove deserved a better breakout hit!

Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix): 0: This remix is garbage, Tove deserved a better breakout hit!

Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix): This remix is garbage, Tove deserved a better breakout hit! That’s a 0 from me dawg!

•	Listen to every single song. I mean it. If that means that you can’t listen to every song in one go, spread it out over a few days or weeks. You really shouldn't listen to the whole thing in one go anyway. No rush.

•	Your scores and comments for songs are not confidential; expect for them to be revealed.

•	If you have already sent your scores, feel free to PM me again if you want to change any of them!

•	This rate will have a minimum average. Thus, if your average score for any of the albums is lower than an undisclosed threshold, I will not be accepting them and you’ll have to resend with modifications. If you have an extremely high average, I’ll probably investigate your comments to find proof that you really like this album, and if I don’t find sufficient proof, I’ll likely PM you. Don’t let this sway your scores, though. Give all songs what you feel is a fair rating and send them, and I’ll tell you if something is wrong. You’re allowed to hate or love songs.

Have fun with the rate!!! I hope this rate is worth the wait!

e: regarding confusion about my definition of alternative pop for this rate: Alternative pop, as a genre, is very flexible. I do acknowledge that some of these songs are not often defined as alternative pop, but all of these artists have made a large number of distinctly alternative pop songs that have made an impact regardless of where they are now. To be honest, this was originally an electropop queens rate, but I had to switch the third choice to Sia so I changed the name to match the one connection that they all had. I hope that this doesn't affect your participation in the rate!
