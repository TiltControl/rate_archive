Alternative Pop Queens Rate Day 2: You promised forever and a day, and then you take it all away
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bfgtx8/alternative_pop_queens_rate_day_2_you_promised/

Welcome to Day 2, in which I prove that I am a flop!

I forgot a set of scores yesterday. The number of participants in this rate is now 47. The Average score is now 7.6171, and the average controversy score is 1.7480.

The final day of the rate will be tomorrow at 5:30 PM!

Of course, me forgetting caused some of the scores revealed yesterday to shift. Here is the whole changelog.

    Changes:
    
    Burn and Run on Love are not out anymore!!!!

    Over and Burn the Pages are tied 
    
    Burn the Pages: -2, #33 to #35
    
    Crave: +2, #35 to #33
    
    Fair Game and Straight for the Knife swapped spots;
    
    Fair Game #38 to #37, Straight for the Knife #37 to #38
    
    JOY and Atlantis swapped spots;
    
    JOY #41 to #40, Atlantis #40 to #41

    Like Em Young: +1, #43 to #42
    
    Cellophane: +1, #44 to #43
        
We will be revealing the first 6 bonus rate songs, as well as songs from #31 to #16. Interludes will be more sparse this time, so don't get shocked!

I’m surprised at the ranking of this song, given how y’all treated the sonically similar JOY. Strong lyrics but I was never a fan of the sample in the background. I do like the violins though. However, THAT BRIDGE is so good.

---
**akanewasright** (10): I don’t know if this is my *favorite* Ellie song, but I think it’s probably her best.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Probably my favorite Ellie song.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): popheads hates ballads wbk

**vayyiqra** (10): This is the single most heartbreaking song on this album, and that's saying a lot. I want to cry every time I hear it. : (

**waluigiest** (9): she needs an orchestra tour

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Ellie sings with so much conviction and meaning yet it feels like the instrumental isn't keeping up. I think I had a more idealized version of this album as a teenager.

**effervescentemu** (8.3): Her voice literally sounds like a lil explosion during the chorus plus the tune is super breezy and makes me feel like I'm on the set of a music video with a wind machine making my caftan billow dramatically.

**1998tweety** (7.5): https://tenor.com/view/explosion-gif-9488133

**nooodisaster** (7): Knowing this song was about her estranged father makes it more affecting; another affecting ballad.

**ramskick** (5): this song's production is disappointingly low on explosions

**radiofan15** (4.2): This album lose steam really fast OMG

***these two comments confuse me immensely***

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This sounds like a Transformers song

I thought this was a lock for top 15. Does anyone remember the God of War trailer with this song? this song is AMAZING and makes me miss pop/dubstep crossovers. The vocalizations throughout the song are breathtaking and the drop is really powerful without being jarring. The lyrics are also great, especially the “touch me and then turn away” part; you can just feel her emotion. Love the vocals too! A bit robbed IMO

---
**nooodisaster** (10): Idk what it is about Ellie's voice that makes it so perfect for vocal manipulation, but this is a perfect example of it. The editing distorts her voice near every line, but always in a way that I wouldn't be able to imagine it any other way.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): it didn't occur to me that this song was a cover until i looked up the Wikipedia entry for this album.

**selegend** (9): why does it sound like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOAcVPPzfpc

**vayyiqra** (9): Popheads loves to drag early 2010s electropop production. I can't get enough of it.

**akanewasright** (8.5): Just the coolest little cover.

**hikkaru** (8.5): this feels a bit more experimental with the weirder electronic production and the things her voice does and while it does sound odd in some places, I really like it

**1998tweety** (8.3): Ellie really needs to go back to this heavier and grittier electronic production, it suits her voice so well.

**ramskick** (8): This song gets an 8 by hanging on to its excellent production

**tapdancingpig** (8): Apparently we’re rating the version with Tenie. I had to dock points because I hate the practice of just throwing on rap verses, and this verse doesn’t justify its existence in any way. But this cover is ethereal as fuck and UGH I LOVE ELLIE SO MUCH

**twat\_brained** (8): Anyone else reminded of Ellie's "High For This" cover?

**waluigiest** (8): legend of zelda headass

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): something’s bothering me about the vocals

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): liked it but didn’t connect

**worlds\_okayest666** (7): I can never quite figure out how I feel about dubstep

**effervescentemu** (6.5): Glitchy and enjoyable but by no means a highlight of Halcyon.

***so we don't have to he hear tinie tempah's dumb verse***

**passionfruits2** (6): Why is there an "Edit" in front of the track's name?

***why'd you have to point this out***

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): 1:46 is one of the awkwardest transitions I’ve ever heard jesus christ

***this song is so sonically different compared to the rest of the songs on it...***

**radiofan15** (3.8): This album starts to sound very samey for me

SkyBlade79: # Bonus Rate #12: Skrillex - Summit ft. Ellie Goulding
---
**Average:** 5.340 **// Total Points:** 133.5 **// Controversy:** 2.738

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x2) MashLuke, u/MirandaCrocsgrove (9 x1) ThatParanoidPenguin (8.5 x1) rotating3Dtext 

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x4) jlim201, passionfruits2, selegend, tapdancingpig (2 x1) radiofan15 

---
Y’all REALLY fell for my ultimate trap! The whole reason I included this song in the bonus rate was that this was the only way that I could think to include Krewella in an official rate. They made an edit to this song, called Breathe, that I think is WAY better so it’s what I’m playing in the plug. But for real, I’m not at all surprised that Summit flopped in the rate. I personally really like the production, but not the length of it. This song almost got good at the end with the great buildup but didn’t even have a new drop. A shame, in my opinion.

---
**MashLuke** (10): I love this song so much. This has to be of the best instrumentals of that time

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i want more Skrillex x Ellie Goulding, but i don't think we'll see them working again anytime soon

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I think this might be one of Skrillex’s best honestly

**waluigiest** (7): it’s like fine but I almost wish it were crunchier

**hikkaru** (6.5): EDM without vocals is something I can enjoy if the production stays interesting throughout the entire song, with a solid melody, and while what's here is nice it's just not interesting enough to keep my attention. The bit we get of Ellie's vocals are lovely as per usual, and I wish there were more.

**akanewasright** (4): This legitimately hurt me to listen to.

**radiofan15** (2): Look... I don't have a problem with Mr. Skrillex but it took Ellie over 3 and a half minutes to appear and there wasn-t anything interesting before that and nothing that great to compensate for such a long wait and such appareance

**passionfruits2** (1): I RATHER LISTEN TO 6IX9INE (jk).

**selegend** (1): oh no

**tapdancingpig** (1): I feel like this is me having bad taste, but I found this song actively unpleasant.

This song is sweet to listen to but its very forgettable, IMO. It’s a good winter song but it’s not something I actively seek out.

---
**hikkaru** (10): This track does everything it's going for PERFECTLY. The guitar line that opens the song eminates the feeling of desperation and anxiety, and its build into the explosive chorus is amazing. Ellie screaming "It's gonna be better. It's gonna be better. It's gonna be better." is just so heartbreaking

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this never fails to make me feel calm

**akanewasright** (9): Really lovely.

**namiko\_shuuya** (9): tied for one of her best on this album

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "When it's just us/you show me what it feels like to be lonely." Ooof, that one hurts.

**passionfruits2** (8): My best friend loves this song and plays it ON REPEAT when we go on trips. I literally listen to it TEN times in one trip. I grew on me a bit, as a token of our friendship.

**vayyiqra** (8): For some reason I can never remember how this song goes unless I listen to it, but then I do and remember I like it. It's probably because it's one of the least Halcyon-like tracks and the most [Bright] Lights-like.

**1998tweety** (7.8): This is cute but also feels like filler.

**effervescentemu** (7.6): One of the more acoustic tracks on the album which emphasises story telling and is definitely reminiscent of her debut.

**twat\_brained** (7.5): cute

**waluigiest** (7): she let me down by not using the title in the lyrics…… flex that vocab Ellie please

**ramskick** (6): Is the rest of this album really gonna be better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This title track has an instrumental kinda drowns out her voice and really isn’t all that special.

**radiofan15** (5.2): I'm not a big fan of the slight'country vibe

The tone of this song is so satirical and defeatist that I can’t help but love it. It really shows how insignificant and powerful love can feel at the same time. This song is what made Tove Lo who she is; it was her first ever single as a solo artist.

---
**MashLuke** (10): underrated song



**passionfruits2** (9): Yaaassss.



**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is great but how many goddamn songs does Tove Lo have in this rate



**akanewasright** (7.8): This is kind of a bop, and also Tove sorts sounds like early Gaga (like Eh Eh and Paparazzi early) in parts of this.

**vayyiqra** (7): I zoned out during this song and had to relisten to it, which is never a good sign.



**waluigiest** (6): not bad but not great

**nooodisaster** (5): Slightly catchy? I guess.

**twat\_brained** (5): had to listen a few times just to properly get a sense for it. sadly for Tove this got old rather fast

***ugh her mind***

**namiko\_shuuya** (9): the message is the opposite of her title  genius

**effervescentemu** (8.5): 'Poor gasoline on me/Oh yes I'd burn slowly/So that you feel I am for real'. Queen of hyperbole and my heart.

**1998tweety** (7.8): This is pretty decent, I like the verses but it loses some steam at the chorus. Not the kind of song I was expecting with the title Love Ballad though.

**radiofan15** (6.2): The title lied to me!

For real this time!!! this would actually be a pretty good song. BUT the chorus is really weak, and a lot of the lyrics are generic at best. The production is really cool and the non-chorus vocals are quite strong. Popheads lives up to its name with the higher than expected score of this song IMO.

---
**1998tweety** (10): A massive bop, love the chorus in particular and it shows how autotune can actually add more to a song.

**hikkaru** (10): Ellie tends to get only one hit per album cycle and this was it for Halcyon (Days). A good pick for a hit single, it bops hard and I love the incorporation of the steel drum near the end

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a hit

**MashLuke** (10): hit

**radiofan15** (10): Ahh After 10,000 years I'm finally awake! Time to keep listening! (AKA this song literally woke me up from how bad and stale the album was getting)

**twat\_brained** (10): the intro, the buildup, the crashing synths, the hooks, the melodies! i swear if Chandelier wasn't in this rate this would be my 11. I know it's cliché but that's how much I love "Burn". Ever since I saw Ellie close her concert with this back in 2014 I've just loved this song like mad and it gives me such a rush when I hear it.

**passionfruits2** (9): WTF. This hidden BOP. I wasn't expecting THIS. Thank God there's a good track.

**ramskick** (9): yeah this song is great.  No pun needed.

**vayyiqra** (8): I feel weird about this song, because I like it, and it's one of her most successful songs (I even heard it last week) but I feel it doesn't really fit.

**effervescentemu** (7.8): Burn marked the transition of indie-pop Ellie to fully fledged pop Gouldigger. It's a faceless bop but I've definitely lost my shit to it at the clurb.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): Pure nostalgia

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this feels weirdly soulless and i've never been able to get into it for that reason

**worlds\_okayest666** (6): If I had a dollar for every time she said "burn", I'd be able to afford a non-used copy of Halcyon Days

**akanewasright** (5): Meh. It sort of bops, but it’s kind of boring?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Yeah I know everyone loves this track but holy shit is the chorus annoying, production dated when it dropped, and entire track generic as hell. This song and Love Me Like You Do plagued my radio listening experiences when they were played all the time.

**nooodisaster** (4): It's a fine pop song but so generic and bland.

**tapdancingpig** (4): This song is just so boring. I’m sorry, I just can’t get into this.

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): trash

**letsallpoo** (0): the beginning of ellie's nosedive in quality

**waluigiest** (0): I fucking hate this song. It was so overplayed when it came out and I can only associate it with like promotional videos for fundraisers and college sports teams. And it's pretty meaningless.

I love the production to this, the imagery, the general adoration it makes me feel for those I love. However, it is a casualty of the length of the album :(

**MashLuke** (10): underrated song

**vayyiqra** (8): I love the chorus to this song, and also the strings at the end.

**radiofan15** (7.2): It's not trying to reinvent the wheel but it's still cute

**nooodisaster** (6): Got... kinda like

**tapdancingpig** (6): A little boring, which is a weird look for Tove.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is like at the center of the Tove Lo starterpack

akanewasright: >casualty of the length of the album

Honestly, I don’t consider the Blueprint stuff to be a part of the album. The album has a pretty clear arc to it, and all these songs are just dropped in at the end. It’s a very reasonably sized album if you don’t count the stuff that was haphazardly thrown at the end.

All is back to as it should be! This is one of my favorite EDM songs ever. Just, jesus. The video is what really made me love this song so much. The first drop is a bit weak but the second drop more than makes up for it. The bridge and the outro are just heartbreaking to me. Together we fall.

---
**hikkaru** (10): I'm not entirely sure why this is being rated again after it flopped in its last rate but it's fine I'll gladly take another opportunity to give this the 10 it deserves

**MashLuke** (10): underrated song

**radiofan15** (10): Why wasn't this on the EDM rate? it's absolutely better than most songs of that rate, including the Bowie-killer 'Zeroes (We Could Be)'!

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): either version is a 10, honestly

**effervescentemu** (9): Lucas Nord's production and Tove's voice seamlessly blend together on this pessimistic bop. It's a travesty I've never heard this in a club.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I think I love the opening line of this song a little too much. “I had one mission but I committed treason” is such a hilarious, but kind of evocative lyric? Either way, the song bops.

**1998tweety** (8.2): Pretty standard EDM dance track

**akanewasright** (8): This is just a wonderful bop

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): upbeat but the message is bittersweet

**passionfruits2** (7): I just ran on a decent track.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Another reminder the EDM rate was a disaster

**vayyiqra** (7): I like this song, but it has no emotional resonance with me. [shrug]

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is just average

**nooodisaster** (5): Generic lyrics and such a dated drop.

**waluigiest** (4): is this a ringtone?

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Sia's raw vocals, holy shit



**1998tweety** (8): I like this, it falls off a bit at the end though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I feel like this will be robbed but it’s so underrated.

**vayyiqra** (8): I like Sia's bops, but I can't get enough of her ballads, and I don't even like ballads. [Also, that iconic voice-cracking thing she does.]

**waluigiest** (8): the bridge is exceptional

**twat\_brained** (7.1): again with the millennial whoop, it's actually surprisingly effective. Also, are those the infamous "Sia vocals" people seem to think are damaging her voice? I must say, I'm rather inclined to agree. The song doesn't really go anywhere else though, which is my pain criticism

**nooodisaster** (6.5): A mid-tempo bop, but it's still filler.

**worlds\_okayest666** (6): It's basic. It's like the Sia equivalent of Uggs



**passionfruits2** (5): needle right through my ear that's what

**namiko\_shuuya** (3): didn't relate

***the voice crack that KILLS*

**akanewasright** (9): I really hate that ugly ass voice crack at the end, but this is low key one of the best songs on the tracklist.

**tapdancingpig** (8.6): I haven’t listened to most of this album in years, but I still keep randomly singing the “oohOOOOHohohOOOOHohohoh” hook randomly throughout my life. Every point I docked is for that fucking crack. I hate the practice of damaging your voice for emotional effect, and this probably the most blunt example of this.

**radiofan15** (5.2): Sia's thing gets tiring very quickly... WAIT WAS THAT A VOICE CRACK AT 3:01? Britney us SHOOK

---
this one is fairly good, even though the production is super uninspired. I like the lyrics and her voice on this song more than normal. I like the bridge a lot.

---
**NachoLiterary** (11): brilliant track, really stands out on the album

**waluigiest** (11): I’m gay! you make me cry and you make me come. queen of marimba bridges

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a bop

**twat\_brained** (9.7): this is already at least 18 times better than Billie Eilish's "Hostage". Sia should do more rock-infused songs, it really suits her vocal style. I'm also intrigued by the lyrical dissonance going on here. That is, I assume there is lyrical dissonance judging from the title but it's hard to tell because Sia mumbles every 3 words out of 4 for some reason.

**1998tweety** (8.6): Not the kind of song I was expecting with a title of Hostage, but it's different from the rest of the album and stands out.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I literally forgot this song existed and wtf was wrong with me, this slaaaaps. Highlight of the middle half of the album, tbh.

**radiofan15** (8.5): OMG this is actually an interesting twist for Sia... I like it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The production on this is so nice my god

**akanewasright** (7.7): I completely forgot about this song until I did this rate, but it’s kind of a huge bop? Like, it’s probably the most blatant filler in the album, but it’s catchy as hell.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): made me think of a first love

**tapdancingpig** (6): This is one of the only songs on the tracklist that I forget about. It’s not enough for me to skip the track, but it’s probably my least favorite in the album.

**vayyiqra** (6): This is the one song on this album I don't love. It's not bad, I just feel like it doesn't fit that well. It would be great on, say, a Lily Allen album. However, the lyrics also make me think of BDSM, which makes it kind of hilarious.

**passionfruits2** (5): ITS OK SIA WE WILL GET U OUT OF THIS BASEMENT!!!

A masterpiece of a song and one of my favorite soundtrack songs ever. It was written, produced, and sang by Tove Lo and NO ONE ELSE. That’s just such talent. The lyrics are powerful and the imagery that they evoke is both provocative and kind of terrifying.

---
**namiko\_shuuya** (9): one of those battle songs

**tapdancingpig** (9): I don’t like “yeah you know what I mean” at a baseline, but this song is basically pop perfection.

**waluigiest** (9): groovy but I wish there was more screaming. LOVE the tiny callback to Habits

**worlds\_okayest666** (9): I was expecting a slut bop from the name. This...is quite the opposite.

**radiofan15** (8.8): I rated this one of the Curated Soundtrack Rate with a 6.8... now I'm increasing my score because it works better outside of the soundtrack and as an album closer

**1998tweety** (8.3): This is pretty good, I like the lyrics and Tove's voice suits it well.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): oh right I'd repressed this rate after Lorde lost. ~~also all three soundtracks were incredibly forgettable oop~~

**vayyiqra** (7): I admit I'm feeling kind of checked out by this point in my ratings. I like all three of these albums, but relistening to Halcyon and QOTC with all these bonus tracks in one sitting is a bit much.

**passionfruits2** (6): hahahahaah

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Probably one of my least favorite Hunger Games songs tbh

***indirectly proving the point of the song***

**nooodisaster** (1): I wouldn't even whisper it.

The production on this is really outstanding but I feel like the chorus is kind of a letdown. The vocalization in the background may be annoying to some. The placement for this is a lot higher than I expected, actually.

---
**letsallpoo** (10): smellie's peak



**hikkaru** (9): I love the vocal sample or whatever it is that plays throughout this

**MashLuke** (9): smooth

**vayyiqra** (9): I have nothing to say about this except it's a B O P. Wait, and the looped vocals are cool.

**waluigiest** (9): this goes so hard. She’s good at using small bits of material in big ways.

**effervescentemu** (8.5): Go off - the interpolation of her whispery mmmmhmmhmm and Alvin and the Chipmunks-esque distorted vocals throughout shouldn't work but they 100% do.

**1998tweety** (8.3): Little Mix and Selena Gomez are not shook because all 3 are good songs.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): a common theme with this album seems to be the production swallowing up Ellie. it's not often i come across this interestingly enough

**radiofan15** (8.2): The distorted chorus really sealed the deal for me

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): liked it  but didn’t connect

**tapdancingpig** (7): There isn’t really a hook or really strong songwriting here, but I’ll always fall in love with a song that’s got Ellie using her voice like this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Steve Monite outsold

**akanewasright** (6.8): This song is really cool sounding (the production is there, Ellie is a goddess), but the songwriting is a little lacking (there’s no real *hook* here).

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Only filler.

**passionfruits2** (6): Passable at best.

**ramskick** (6): I can't even make a pun out of this.

***I love how this score is still a 10***

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): apparently this is what chipmunks with electronic music sound like

I’m really mixed about this song. On one hand, it has a lot of great parts; the bridge, the pre-chorus, and the verses are all really good, as well as some great production. However, the garbled post-chorus isn’t very cash money, and to me this song pales in comparison to the other self-destructive anthem in this rate, Love Ballad.

---
**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): this bitch wanna die

**waluigiest** (9): she snapped

**1998tweety** (8): This song needed a heavier rock-styled production; the lyrics are perfect for a rock song so it feels like a missed opportunity. The spliced vocals are not a good choice for this track, you end up doing too much so everything falls flat.

**letsallpoo** (8): my face is the front of shop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The production on this is really nice

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): im not sure if im a fan of the electronic burping vocal chops

**vayyiqra** (8): I love this song because it's such a bop yet the lyrics are so shockingly violent. Something about that contrast works for me.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): This is a lesser bop within 2 of the best bops of the album.

**namiko\_shuuya** (7): she was so passionate  her voice moved me

**passionfruits2** (7): ggggg.

I wish I knew what she was saying at all. The chorus is mediocre and the verses are subpar at best to me. I just don’t think that this song is distinctive enough for me to listen to again.

I appreciate her attempt at making this a good length, but the start is just so boring that getting to the interesting part is such a chore. It’s a shame, too.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Love this song, the entire album should've had harder hitting production like this. Despite being nearly 7 minutes long, this track doesn't really lose its steam and it works as a great closer to the album.

**nooodisaster** (10): This feels like listening to a movie. It's so cinematic and driven, the lyrics so clear and personal that I can imagine each image perfectly. With her more recent contributions, you can forget she became known as a songwriter first, but songs like this show why that's always been her biggest strength. People are going to read this for being too long, and well, those people are ugly.

**waluigiest** (9): gorgeous all around. Maybe a bit longer than it needs to be but it works

**worlds\_okayest666** (8): It's a really good song, but god, does it really need to be 6 minutes long?

**NachoLiterary** (7): sia's voice is amazing

**radiofan15** (7): UGH her mind

**vayyiqra** (7): After how heavy a lot of the songs are on this album, this song is surprisingly really nice and sweet if you read the lyrics.

**twat\_brained** (6.3): forgive me. Cellophane is not long. THIS is long. Did Sia have live performances in mind when she made this song? Like the two minutes of vocalization would just be her bowing and thanking her band and the effects crew? before coming out for the encore and singing Chandelier and Cheap Thrills or something? I can't imagine any other context in which this song totals **6 and a half minutes**. My goodness.

**namiko\_shuuya** (6): eh  not her greatest

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A closer that’s too long and not interesting enough sadly

Definitely one of the most rightfully controversial songs in the rate. I personally love it, but it really has to grow on you. It takes forever for you to start liking it, IMO. A lot of you called it a wall of sound, which I do kind of agree with, but I also view it as a musical painting. The way that the production drops out before the chorus is the best part of the song for me, as it shows just how powerful the chorus is. Definitely not single material, though I’m happy we got a video.

---
**akanewasright** (10): This song is really weird, but it’s also incredibly fun and low key really relatable?

**MashLuke** (10): explosive

**passionfruits2** (10): Call me when Lauryn Hill releases a new album puh-lease.

**radiofan15** (10): youmadeyourwayinasIwasleavingyoucutinlinejustasIwasgettingmystuffandIcouldn'tdecideifyouwerethemostannoyinghumanbeingI'devermetorjustthebestthingthateverhappenedjustthebestthingthateverhappenedyoutookthekeyoutof theignitionIcouldheartherainonthewindowsrightthenandthereImadeupmymindtojustgowithitthinkingwhat'stheworst thingthatcouldhappen?whentheworstthingthatcouldhappencouldbethebestthingever

**u/MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the double tracked vocals shook me

**1998tweety** (9): There are so many weird messy bits about this song, but I kind of love them.

**NachoLiterary** (9): give it up for piano

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is such a weird rambling song, I can’t help but love it.

**namiko\_shuuya** (8): love the song

**nooodisaster** (8): The rhythm feels slightly off-kilter, but I think that's intentional and think it adds to it.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I really like the chorus but the talk-singing in the verses are enough for me not to rate it any higher

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I remember purchasing this from iTunes because I was still really into Tove at the time and wanted to keep up with her singles. looking back this was a meh single choice

**ManofOranges** (7): This is cute song but I have to admit that the spoken-word type stuff for the verses sounds kinda cheesy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is like a lot to deal it, it’s so loud but it is pretty nice

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is very bombastic. Maybe a little too bombastic. It's catchy, though.

**effervescentemu** (5.5): Whilst I am a fan of how the song is structured to tell the story of the ups and downs of a relationship - the verses are rushed beyond belief and that 'BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM' part of the chorus is exceptionally unfortunate.

**selegend** (5): lyrical diarrhea

**waluigiest** (5): too many moving parts. The individual components aren’t great and they don’t flow together well. I appreciate that it took a risk but I’m not into it

**TragicKingdom1** (4): we just learned about the "wall of sound" in my music class and the professor should've played this as the example

**worlds\_okayest666** (3): There's so many ideas here but nothing works. Bless her heart.

I’m surprised by how high this song got, considering the placement in the album, but it totally deserves it. The longing and hurt in Tove’s voice are hard-hitting and I think a lot of us can relate to her situation here.

---
**namiko\_shuuya** (10): She sounds somewhat hopeful in this

**tapdancingpig** (9): A great sendoff to the album.

**1998tweety** (8.4): I like this, it's distinct enough from the other songs on the album but still fits.

**NachoLiterary** (8): gets better with every listen!

**waluigiest** (8): I just think it could do a little more

**radiofan15** (7.8): Boppy moody Horny Queen... not one of her bests but still cute

**nooodisaster** (7): :(

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I completely forgot what song I was listening to halfway through but it’s good I suppose

**vayyiqra** (7): Much like "Dead In the Water" on Halcyon, I feel like the album ends perfectly here, and the bonus tracks don't add much to it, even if they're not bad.

**passionfruits2** (6): read in Tatianna's voice CHOICES.

From the Insurgent Soundtrack. It’s really good; I love the buildup, and the lyrics are also great!

---
**tapdancingpig** (8.1): This song is probably the best thing to come out of this cursed movie. That doesn’t say much, but it’s a pretty good chune, even if it’s a little cliche reliant.

**waluigiest** (8): kinda fun there are some cool chords here

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): So much Tove Lo every song just sounds the same at this point

**radiofan15** (5.2): Remember when Divergent was supposed to be the new Hunger Games?

**passionfruits2** (5): ughh.

Totally heartbreaking video that made me realize the POWER to this track. This song really snuck its way into the top 10 despite the general lack of discussion. As something I might be dealing with soon… it’s just heartbreaking to me.

---
**MashLuke** (10): underrated song

**rosesmp3** (10): deserved to be on the standard album!

**1998tweety** (9.5): I remember first listening to this song in a nightcore mashup, the original is great too.

**namiko\_shuuya** (9): mood

**rotating3Dtext** (7): it’s ok

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Solid

**vayyiqra** (7): This is the third bonus track I've zoned out during, so either I need to go to bed, or they just aren't that good. Anyway, I'm just giving them all a 7 because I've heard them all before and know they aren't bad, and that's my rating for songs that are good but not amazing.

**waluigiest** (7): again, not bad

**radiofan15** (6.5): The chorus is quite annoying yet catchy... HELP!

**passionfruits2** (5): What a mistake.
