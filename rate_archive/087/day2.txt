For a song that is basically the same thing throughout, it never feels long and its just iconic in my humble opinion. But looks like many people disagreed otherwise. 
Btw in case you didn’t know (like me) how this song blew up, it started as background music on twitch which led to everyone asking what song it was. And in classic internet fashion whenever some is looking for a song name, people would respond with Darude - Sandstorm.

# d-d-d-d-d-darude

**skargardin** (11): If I didn't give this my 11 I would get deported on sight

**bandnitos** (8): this plays at every school dance and half the people have to leave the like . dance area because it turns into a full mosh pit like i went through an emo phase i have been in mosh pits and i think the darude pit is more aggressive like at homecoming this year they had to turn it off because it got so out of hand

**Qwilpish** (8): whats the background music

# I prefer Zarude

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): I get that this was an influential edm track at the time but listening to it now it just sounds so incredibly basic

**cultofbabies** (6): it's kinda dull but then i pictured myself being at a warehouse rave in finland in 2001 and it made a lot more sense

I was introduced to this song by my parents and not the internet. This is barely a meme song to me since idc about Weezer anyway. This song is another one that was quite divisive, with many people genuinely enjoying the song and other absolutely hating its guts. Like what did Toto ever do to you? Idk but that’s why it was 19th.

# miss the rains down in Africa

**agentofscranton** (10): unironically one of the greatest songs of all time

**Corn\_and\_rice** (10): love it, it's often played on the radio in my work

**lil\_foofy** (10): It's great both as a meme song and as a normie song.

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm gonna be perfectly honest, Toto were like "we're just gonna slack on the verses" and you know what that's fine because the chorus of this song exists so I'm just gonna give it a 10

**rickikardashian** (10): I never really understood why this became, and in fact I'm just giving it a 10 because I really do like the song

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Unironically good.

**SFbby** (10): We have been blessed

**timothy444** (10): There's a reason why "Africa" is one of the most memorable 80's songs! Everything is just perfect and it still hasn't aged. Such a bop!

**1998tweety** (9.5): It's nice, maybe a little overrated but still a good tune.

**camerinian** (9.5): this is a great song, a classic song even, now can we please just let it have it's legacy? Getting sick of its exposure tbh

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): His vocals don't do it for me.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it

**evilqueenlex** (9): weezer ruined this song

**ImAMemeDuh** (9): The way T*****k******1 thinks the Weezer cover is better…..

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): Did you know that it’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you? Also, I have 2 covers of this in my library alongside the original version, tells you a lot about me I suppose. (Blame NSP & Weezer) ANYWAYS, Back onto that’s 80s accidental meme grind. Jesus, I grew UP with this song due to my parents always putting on the 70s/80s station. Little did I know it would be a meme but here we are. Anyways I’ll keep blessing the rains down in Africa and you guys can keep living your lives.

**mysario** (8.7): idk how to rate this because it's a great meme and a great song but I am so sick of hearing this everywhere, Toto has other songs!

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Ugh, this is so overmemed but I guess I’m not too mad at it. Truly a CLASSIC banger.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I can't stand this song but it's so good I don't know, my relationship with this song is so complicated

**notdallin** (8.1): I still can’t believe this song was used unironically in Stranger Things

**bandnitos** (8): SOPHOMORE YEAR WE SANG THIS AT OUR CHOIR CONCERT

**SunshineMarmot101** (8): also good

**TragicKingdom1** (8): weezer version better

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): It's not horrible but I lowkey don't really care for this song

**vayyiqra** (7): I will stand by this song being a bop, as annoying as it got at the peak of the meme, and as strange as some of the lyrics are. I used to unironically love this song, but now it's been ruined a bit. I'm not going to trash it though.

# we support Kony2012

**cultofbabies** (6): it's always been a little confusing to me why of all the great songs from the 80s this one got memed? like it's not bad but there's such better ones out there...

**Qwilpish** (6): i do not bless the rains

**skargardin** (6): I fluctuate between hating and loving it oop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Hot take time! This song is super overrated and I never understood the appeal for it. Also Weezer lowkey did it better oops

**bbfan132** (5): the song is a 10 but the memes are so stupid that i removed 5 points. sorry not sorry

**coin-cache** (5): The chorus is good but I never really considered a top 80s song.

**NBA-Mark** (5): Never got the hype behind this one

**Ambelliina** (4): i am SICK of this song and the lol epic 80s good reddit so 80s cool funny wow omg 80s wrong generation80s fuck it fuck it fuck it all but i cant give it less than a 4 because it KIND of still bops but hold the line and rosanna are better

**worlds-okayest666** (4): this song is so overrated...i said what i said

**cremeebrulee** (3): i hate this song sm can people stop putting it on during karaoke

**wavingwolves** (2): no

**Roxieloxie** (1.3): take on me outsold

**anothertown** (1): let me tell you when i found out this band is all white people i swear

**bespectacIed** (1): colonialism

**loloeffeff** (1): sorry about it but i fucking hate this song

**Maybe9** (1): this song is an ambien

**waluigiest** (1): if “bed intruder song” wasn’t in this, this would be my zero. I hate this song so fucking much. I don’t care how ironic it is.

**alwayswords** (0): something about this song enrages me

**hikkaru** (0): this is an unholy combination of "music hasn't been good since the 80s" and really unfunny memes i HATE it here

Sorry I don’t get it or like it particularly much.
This was another song I was not familiar with prior to the rate and through my research I somehow ended back at popheads as someone wrote an essay on this 2 years ago. So shout out to u/vibraphonics and go check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7a9qmk/throwback_kyary_pamyu_pamyu_ponponpon/

# pon de replay


**agentofscranton** (11): if this doesn't win i'm ready to report this sub for racism

**notdallin** (11): just to add to the genius of this song (in addition to its mythos, its influence, its imagery) for the uninitiated: “pon” is the Japanese onomatopoeia of a clapping sound and its homophone “pan” means “bread” (hence, the slices of bread that appear as she claps :D)

**wavingwolves** (11): this is literally sugary pop perfection and i love it so much

**1998tweety** (10): Okay this is an actual good song, I'll be so disappointed if y'all do it dirty. the xenophobia will be very apparent

**alwayswords** (10): the looks in this mv are everything

**Ambelliina** (10): oh THIS song. yeah this is iconic i dont think anything else needs to be said on the matter

**bandnitos** (10): i still listen to this sometimes

**bespectacIed** (10): queen

**cultofbabies** (10): it's PONPONPON how can the score be any lower

**fadedblue09** (10): J-pop never fails to deliver quality meme-worthy music (just ask Avril).

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): she served us VISUALS

**lil\_foofy** (10): This score because it's what she deserves!

**ManofOranges** (10): You tell em, bitch!

**Qwilpish** (10): actually pretty tame for jpop hahahaha its such a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): honestly i feel bad giving this a 10 considering kyary is a gross shotacon but i dont think giving this song imaginary points in a meaningless song rate is going to affect my morality much so fuck it. its a bop

**camerinian** (9): this is so fucking sweet omg

**materialqirl** (9): bop

**yourfacesucksass** (9): oh my GOD I haven't heard this meme bop in so long and it gets an immediate 9 because of how much it brings me back.

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): odd that this is from 2011 but sounds so post-2018

**DaHumanTorch** (8): the fact that this song was made for the purpose of cheering people up after the 2011 tsunami/earthquake...a cultural reset

**SunshineMarmot101** (8): Kyary is a straight-up good artist

**vayyiqra** (8): As cute as this song is, catchy, a bop etc. I never understood why it was such a popular meme, when it's just kind of goofy. I still like Kyary's music and her ~kawaii aesthetic and think Popheads doesn't talk about her enough. As in, ever.

**rickikardashian** (7.6): I didn't remember this existed, but rewatching got me back to 10 year old me watching YouTube videos in English that I didn't understand talking about this video, acting very confused at it and making statements like "Japan is a weird country that makes weird stuff"

**HoodooMooJuice** (7.5): It's kinda catchy I guess? That one shot in the middle of the video where the little people revolve around her head reminds me of that Floop's Fooglies tv show from Spy Kids

**Corn\_and\_rice** (7): great mv, song is ok

**hikkaru** (7): cute bop

**Maybe9** (7): a queen of uplifting disaster striken people

**moooo566** (7): i rated this an eight but then it got annoying towards the end

**ReallyCreative** (7): The song is actually pretty good but wow that video makes me so uncomfortable

**rslashpoopheads** (7): pedo bop

**waluigiest** (7): this is nice!!

# k pop outsold j pop

**midnightjasper** (6): Sadly I can't listen to this song without thinking of the loli version, I am sorry

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): This is what a Lisa Frank coloring book sounds like.

**skargardin** (6): I mean this was alright

**timothy444** (6): TIL that the POMF POMF POMF song was a parody of this song. Lmfao I didn't even know the true meaning of that parody until a year later.

**coin-cache** (5): It's okay, not really a favorite though.

**Roxieloxie** (5): the further i get in this rate the more i want to havea crisis

**SFbby** (5): ??? Is this what trippin on acid is like?

**NBA-Mark** (3): Boring

The most Japanese Swedish song to ever exist. 
Reading up on this song, this has gone viral several times over the past 20 years or so and currently is popular on Tik Tok as of right now. I don’t know what else to say other than it does bop.

# caramel dancers

**alasyorick** (11): legends only

**Ambelliina** (11): so im gonna tell a little ancedote here! my school has a thing where you can use an app to choose the music that plays in the dining hall. generally the selection is pretty limited, but for whatever reason, most of caramell's discography is available to play there. so i downloaded like 4 separate app cloner apps on my phone so i could log onto the music app with like 5 different accounts and queue up Caramelldansen with all of them, upvote all of each others picks and dislike everyone elses so no one else can get any songs in. i do this every time i go there so basically whenever i go to get food everyone there gets to near nothing but nonstop Caramelldansen. anyway this song is literal perfection

**cultofbabies** (11): i didn't appreciate this nearly enough as a 15-year-old weaboo back in 2008

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): This song was the biggest banger of all time when I was 10, and even 8 years later, I still lose my shit to this song. Also Caramella Girls have so many other bops you gays need to listen to. Stream Boogie Bam Dance

**1998tweety** (10): I remember bopping to this so much when I was younger, please don't do it dirty!!

**anothertown** (10): The utmost finery

**bandnitos** (10): i unironically listen to this pretty regularly

**bespectacIed** (10): Just to mirror my blurb about Barbie Girl: eurodance could either be addicting and retro-futuristic or annoying and dated. If Barbie Girl's the latter, Caramelldansen is the former. Yeah it's a meme but this is candy coated perfection. These three anime raver girls who only know ONE dance step, I would die for them, I don't know better people

**evilqueenlex** (10): my brain and heart after drinking iced coffee as my organs beg for actual food and water

**geekysheep\_** (10): i am once again in middle school and i hate it

**hikkaru** (10): BAWP

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Phineas and Ferb could only imagine achieving such levels of iconic

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): The misheard lyric video for this is iconic https://i.imgur.com/PJb15kx.gif

**LesApfels** (10): Both an iconic meme and an absolute BOP

**ManofOranges** (10): Catchy as fuck song and catchy as fuck dance don't pretend like you didn't try to do it at least once

**materialqirl** (10): playing roblox in the early 2010s..

**rickikardashian** (10): finding out this is not a Japanese song has shook my world like nothing has before

**skargardin** (10): DANSA MED OSS KLAPPA ERA HÄNDER!!!

**SunshineMarmot101** (10): classic

**timothy444** (10): Back when anime was good

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the other girlies just aren’t doing it like this...

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Hatsune Miku who? Kpop who? Spice Girls who?

**notdallin** (8.3): Attention! This song is available on iTunes Store

**bbfan132** (8): a++ for video production quality

**camerinian** (8): I was absolutely not enough of a weeb to be into this meme back in the day, but I'm absolutely enough of a 100 Gecs fan to be into this now

**lil\_foofy** (8): I can bop to this with enough Captain Morgan probably.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is the video that comes to mind when I visualize the concept of "meme". It's catchy, dumb, repetitive, cute, weird ... everything one could want in a viral Internet music video.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): popheads loves choreo!

**fadedblue09** (7): Oh so that’s where that pose came from….

**moooo566** (7): ugh

**poppinmmolly** (7): why did so many weebs do this

**Qwilpish** (7): I dont know how to rate this

**Roxieloxie** (7): i cant stop laughing at the way youtube had to refresh cause this video is that old

# I prefer real anime

**agentofscranton** (6.5): this just forcibly grabbed me by the hair and forced me to remember being 11

**yourfacesucksass** (6.1): No comment. Okay maybe one: why???

**coin-cache** (5): I always considered this one of the weaker songs of the late 00s meme era.

**NBA-Mark** (5): I don't really care

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5): I’ve never heard this before. Somehow. Also, it reminds me of Boom Boom Boom Boom by Vengaboys. Yeah, I don’t have much to say about this one.

**waluigiest** (5): this was really huge when I first learned how to use the internet…. I’m traumatized T__T

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): anyway

**Maybe9** (4): i dont hate this, but i definitely should

**Corn\_and\_rice** (3): Reminds my of my weeb days (which is both good and bad)

**DaHumanTorch** (2): this is one of the few songs in this rate i've never heard before and my life was more pleasant when this was the case

This was one of the few songs I never heard until preparing this rate….actually fucking iconic. Although it reminds me a lot of Shoes…definitely heavily inspired from that.

---

# invented screamo

**materialqirl** (11): INVENTED A WHOLE GENRE

**TragicKingdom1** (11): is that it? right there? behind the couch? ...it's not?FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU is the funniest moment in this rate imo! so i HAVE to give this my 11. its legitimately incredibly produced anyways though

**worlds-okayest666** (11): this literally goes off SO hard and it has no right to. A metal classic...Poppy shaking

**alwayswords** (10): my favorite metal girlie

**anothertown** (10): https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RV46al7pD/

**bandnitos** (10): this is in regular rotation like i fucking love it

**bespectacIed** (10): I BADLY WANTED TO GIVE THIS AN 11. This shit's wild, cathartic, therapeutic. Crackhead Sarah Bonito, I would die for you.

**cremeebrulee** (10): unironically the best song /r/popheads introduced me to

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the fact that it was in her pocket the whole time...

**geekysheep\_** (10): hate juuls but honestly we've all been there and also incredible video

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): We love a queen who can say “fuck modern medicine!”

**ManofOranges** (10): She snapped 110%, a perfect encapsulation of all these girls out here today being accusatory of where their juuls went. Literally ended nicotine addiction. Thank you for your service.

**Qwilpish** (10): honestly a modern classic. I legitimately love love love this song. Her screaming is so good, and I love the character

**Roxieloxie** (10): this was a 1 and then it disturbed me so much i think i like it. the film major in me appreciates and is captivated by the camera work

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Outsold Phone by Lizzo

**SFbby** (10): Apparently if we take juuls away from ABGs they release banger songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the fact that i actually knew people like this in high school is the scariest part of this song

**TiltControls** (10): Modern Shoes

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): WHERE’S MY JUUL?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? SO NOT COOL!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay so I first saw this on Tumblr and I fucking laughed my ass off. It just keeps getting harder and harder and screamer and screamer it’s beautiful.

**1998tweety** (9): I don't approve of drug use but this kinda bops.....

**camerinian** (9): UH OH I’M CROWDKILLING AGAIN

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): We stan a rage Queen!

**LesApfels** (8.5): This video's surprisingly well-edited ngl

**bbfan132** (8): i think i’m too old to fully appreciate this but i love the chaotic energy

**coin-cache** (8): I've never heard this one before but I like the vocals.

**hikkaru** (8): screamo bop

**lil\_foofy** (8): With pods that expensive I'd go apeshit, too.

**NBA-Mark** (8): Vocals got Poppy shaking

**notdallin** (8): that was an experience

**rickikardashian** (8): this is the closest we have in this rate to “Can i get a box”, so i kind of appreciate it

**waluigiest** (8): first half is lit, second half is a lot. This wants what Shoes has.

**yourfacesucksass** (8): I am cryingggg because the valley-girl voice so reminds me of Kimmy's most quotable moment, "don't be fuckinggg rude!"

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): funny song but jjuuling is really dangerous, and you should not use it unless you are trying to stop smoking cigarettes.

**cultofbabies** (7.4): vaping destroys lives. just say no.

**Ambelliina** (7): i had the absolute lowest expectations for this from the title but this unironically goes fucking hard. she could genuinely do really good vocals for a post-hardcore or skramz band or smth like that. its only a 7 bc it ends too soon

**vayyiqra** (7): [hits the Juul; dabs] HEY HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN MY JUUL??? This is awful, and I kind of love it, and it also scares me. Nicotine addiction is no joke, kids. Stay in school, don't hit the Juul.

**wavingwolves** (7): the energy this has... crazy

**Corn\_and\_rice** (6): strong vocals

# so not cool

**fadedblue09** (5): I have no idea how to rate this. It made me crack up, but it’s barely music.

**evilqueenlex** (4): i appreciate this and I may be 22 going on 23 but I'm too old to understand this. it's definitely the gen z shoes but at least shoes wasn't about nicotine addiction :/

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): Where. are. the jokes?!

**Maybe9** (1): big tobacco has invaded pop heads in the worst way possible

**skargardin** (1): goodbye

**timothy444** (1): Not funny didn't laugh

**Tolk1en** (1): please someone end my suffering

**plaguebub** (0): it's very annoying and not funny

**SunshineMarmot101** (0): i hate this, in tone, content, and sound

Never really felt for this song as much as other people. It’s not bad it’s just not a highlight or as memorable of a song for me.
Made famous through Spongebob Squarepants (~~Maroon 5 can suck it~~) this song is placed pretty decently as it is a good sounding song. It just was not iconic enough for some people to stay any higher in the end however. 
---

# Patrick

**1998tweety** (10): Classic shit

**agentofscranton** (10): spongebob squarepants is the greatest cultural icon of our generation and generations to come - aquatic king

**anothertown** (10): i still remember when this spongebob episode premiered it was the moment i was like “yes, this is culture, this is comedy!!”

**bespectacIed** (10): My submission!!! Best Spongebob episode in existence and the only dad rock I accept

**cultofbabies** (10): oh my god i didn't even know this had a full version! this rules!

**evilqueenlex** (10): and that's on bikini bottom

**geekysheep\_** (10): amazing

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): why isn’t this listed as Spongebob - Sweet Victory

**ManofOranges** (10): Spongebob has some of the most iconic musical moments in all of history and their Sweet Victory performance was an absolute MOMENT. The crowd was LIVING and their halftime show was only like 3 minutes. ICONIC

**mysario** (10): the fact that this wasn't in the halftime show 2019 was a national tragedy

**NBA-Mark** (10): No lie, I cried when I first heard this a young child. It deserved better at the SB

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is on my workout playlist, and has been, unironically, for about 5 years

**timothy444** (10): This better have a higher score than Sicko Mode in the other normie rate

**camerinian** (9.5): I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who wasn't a SpongeBob fan back in the day, because to them this probably sounds like a pretty regular 80s power ballad

**cremeebrulee** (9): band geeks as an episode is a lil overrated for me so i docked it a point but this is gonna go farther than it needs to lol

**materialqirl** (9): reminds me of bon jovi LOL

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): It’s fucking sweet victory man. Robbed at the Superbowl.

**SFbby** (9): Imagine what the SuperBowl could have been like if Spongebob was the main performer/pop girl

**SunshineMarmot101** (9): yeah okay fine this rules

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): shout out to all the dumb kids like me who didn’t realize that this was an actual song and wasn’t just something the spongebob team made just for the band geeks episode

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): ok but this unironically is a really good song that i could see someone like journey releasing

**Qwilpish** (8.5): Spongebob outskinnied your favs

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): I am grateful for this rate because up until now, I thought the full song was just what was heard on SpongeBob, and that it was recorded for the show, but I'm seeing it in compilation albums for sports stadium hype songs?? Solid gold, Squidward deserved this W. Squilliam Fancyson is strictly a bottom.

**hikkaru** (8): we're with the pet hospital down the street, and i understand you have a dying animal on the premises?

**lil\_foofy** (8): Thank all of them sponge bobs I guess?

**ReallyCreative** (8): I don't like dad rock like at all but she's a bop

**skargardin** (8): Banger

**worlds-okayest666** (8): this makes me nostalgic but tbh? The full song is kinda boring

**notdallin** (7.8): the most cathartic spongebob episode

**HoodooMooJuice** (7.5): TBH I hated this song as child because it would interrupt Spongebob for three minutes just to tell a long winded joke 🤷‍♀️

# Plankton

**waluigiest** (7): a fine song but a tired meme

**bandnitos** (6): was this originally from spongebob im too lazy to check

**coin-cache** (6): I'll be honest, I don't like it as much without the Spongebob context.

**Ambelliina** (5): i want to give this a higher rating for nostalgia, but the cold truth is that, its not even just an 80s buttrock song, its a (sorta) modern mimickry of 80s buttrock. its like the greta van fleet of whitesnake. but it was in an iconic spongebob scene so i still cant give it lower than a 5

**poppinmmolly** (5): meh

**fadedblue09** (4): So OVERRATED. We could’ve rated an actual Spongebob Song tbh.

**bbfan132** (3): is this from spongebob or something? not my kind of thing, sorry

**Corn\_and\_rice** (3): meh

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Why is this even in this rate

**vayyiqra** (3): I don't like Spongebob, never have, never liked this meme. I don't get why it's funny. I guess it's an okay parody of 80s power ballads, but those are cheesy enough I could just listen to one of those if I wanted to find them funny.

**Maybe9** (1): without spongebob this song is trash

A gay icon that all of you are too young to appreciate. I know this will be robbed because 70% of the people doing this rate are 20 years old or younger. (this was a month ago btw)
And here is the song with the most 11’s! As Kelly deserves. I was really hoping this song would make top 10 but alas like I predicted it was robbed by a handful of people who didn’t like it at all. Anyone who was on Youtube back before 2010 knows the impact of this video and song, so shout out to all those who gave this a good score. 

---

# These shoes rule
**CreepyMannequin** (11): invented music

**poppinmmolly** (11): this is so iconic.

**ReallyCreative** (11): This song was when we fully recognized what the internet was capable of, it was an iconic moment for culture, justice for Let Me Borrow That Top

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (11): THESE SHOES RULE, THESE SHOES SUCK, THESE SHOES RULE, THESE SHOES SUCK AAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Kelly and I are one being, we’re going to get what we want. And that’s some nice fucking shoes. I love this song unironically. Best “meme” song. Pillar of the old days of the internet. Iconic video. Unfortunately, I only have like 2 pairs of shoes and they’re both converse I’m failing; my boots don’t fit me anymore. Also, I have huge feet, so I get the pain… FUCK SHOES THAT ARE TOO SMALL. Anyways this song is my 11, betch.

**SFbby** (11): Let's get some shoessssss

**TiltControls** (11): Katy who? Gaga who? Taylor who? Kelly is the true late 2000's pop princess. (Also make 'Let Me Borrow That Top' Meme rate #2 winner)

**waluigiest** (11): From the “I’m gonna get what I want” this is literally ICONIC. I think this video introduced me to the internet and it shows. 13 years later, I still know every beat of this song. This song probably made me gay I really firmly believe that.

**yourfacesucksass** (11): Kelly was THE main pop girl in 2007, and I will always remember seeing Shoes set as every friend's MySpace song in 7th grade...when we lied about our age so that we could join lmfao. But honestly, why does this sound like an unreleased track from Blackout?

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10, a masterpiece.

**agentofscranton** (10): sophie's music but make it listenable

**anothertown** (10): the voice actor for Tina Belcher owes everything to this video

**bandnitos** (10): a classic

**camerinian** (10): fiscal responsibility

**Corn\_and\_rice** (10): love it

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a cinematic and musical masterpiece...THESE SHOES RULE, THESE SHOES SUCK

**evilqueenlex** (10): it was a cultural reset

**geekysheep\_** (10): what did you expect, condamns?

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): this song is probably older than some popheads users and I don’t like that

**ManofOranges** (10): Kelly was a misunderstood legend who just wanted to live her life and eventually become a cobbler, but for some reason no one else, not even her parents, understood her or her goals. Kelly's plight is one that we all have to remember. It's a tale of encouragement, a tale of enlightenment, a tale of discovery.

**materialqirl** (10): walked so wheres my juul?? could run

**moooo566** (10): iconic

**mysario** (10): Muffins also an iconic video

**NBA-Mark** (10): Female empowerment anthem

**Qwilpish** (10): kelly said gay rights

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): main pop girl!

**notdallin** (9.2): so much iconic late 2000s imagery and language. Woulda been a 10 if not for the last quarter of the song. also Let Me Borrow That Top >>>>>

**skargardin** (9): Pop 2 could never

**wavingwolves** (9): what did you expect? con-dams?

**bbfan132** (8): the video alone makes this song. best video ever.

**lil\_foofy** (8): Get you those red bottoms, hoe!

**vayyiqra** (8): SHEWS OMG SHEWS This is a VINTAGE meme and I am old enough to remember when it was a thing. My galaxy brain take is that this song is an advanced form of drag and send-up of gender roles and it is also a catchy bop. It kind of loses me near the end when Kelly starts screaming "FUCK YOU!" repeatedly and the song turns into some kind of industrial nightmare, but then that is basically what deconstructed club music is, so it was at least ahead of its time.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): electroclash classic!!! Kelly paved the way!!!

# These shoes suck

**coin-cache** (6): This is definitely early youtube

**Ambelliina** (5): evidence that i am a zoomer

**cultofbabies** (5): i've somehow spent 13 years on the internet never hearing this and i'm surprised how much this actually goes

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): I don't like this at all but I respect it for being annoying as fuck before it was cool

**Roxieloxie** (4): im crying what the fuck

**rslashpoopheads** (4): SHUT UP!

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Sorry i didn’t find this funny at all.

**Maybe9** (1): if Prop 8 was a song

This is legitimately a great generic pop song. Not the most memey selection here though, but it bops.
Yes, this song is only a meme within the context of popheads when this black mirror episode was released and not really anywhere else (getting flashbacks to all the comments that say Hey I’m a Hoe! I’m on a Roll!). But it’s iconic to us nonetheless. Not everyone though that as well which is fair, so this placement makes sense overall.

---

# Ashley O Main Pop Girl

**bespectacIed** (11): I remember a tweet saying Ashley O was lucky two straight girls found her because if gays did, they would have left her on a coma hooked on the machine to produce bops forever 💀 Anyways this song is lowkey genius. The vapid lyrics, crisp but generic production, over-sexualization of a young artist, even the song length of less than 3 minutes to play the streaming game ..... this is designed to mock the superficiality and manufactured-ness of the pop music industry. And like the sheep that we all are, we all ate the song up and proved Black Mirror's point BECAUSE IT FUCKING SLAPS. I don't blame us; in the end we are all just hoes, on a roll, riding so high, achieving our goals

**DaHumanTorch** (11): giving gay icon ashley o anything less than a 10 is blatant homophobia, i don't make the rules. also i love how this is unironically better than any of miley's actual output since bangerz. we need to hook her up to that machine

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The gays truly, unironically won with this

**evilqueenlex** (10): miley cyrus is the ceHOE of multiple popstar personalities

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Umm... only half a year in the music scene and we've already found a new main pop girl! And all by remixing a Nine Inch Nail songs too! Your fav could never!

**ManofOranges** (10): HEY IM A HOE

**ReallyCreative** (10): This song is better than some artists' entire discographies

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): OH HONEY! And for once I finally like a NIN song lol. Now I expect this to rank fairly high because… it’s Miley in a cheap wig doing better than way too many pop girls of last year. Even if we’re supposed to hate it because it’s “manufactured pop” I still fucking like. It bops. Honestly the whole “manufactured pop” thing kinda makes it even more likeable. Because you can tell the obvious flaws that say “wow this was clearly manufactured.” I suppose that makes more sense if you’ve seen the episode but fuck it.

**rickikardashian** (10): look, all im saying is that making a good pop song is hard as hell, had the producers wanted to make a shitty generic pop song, they could have done it, but instead they went through all the trouble to make an absolute bop

**SFbby** (10): HEY IM A HOE

**skargardin** (10): The way that this stomps all other motivational anthems

**waluigiest** (10): HEY I’M A HOLE. Probably my #3 song of the summer 2019 behind Gone and Too Much. This is just a good song it doesn’t belong in this rate.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this isnt really a meme song BUT it slaps so it will get a 10 anyways

**loloeffeff** (9.5): who knew we needed a NIN/Miley collaboration this badly

**materialqirl** (9.5): queen of alter egos..

**bbfan132** (9): when a supposedly vapid song is better than most of your actual discography

**Corn\_and\_rice** (9): Loved that episode and song

**ImAMemeDuh** (9): minus one point cause of all the “PoP mUsIc FaNs LiKe ThIs SoNg MaKiNg FuN oF pOp MuSiC” it spawned

**NBA-Mark** (9): Stream "Head like a Hole" https://youtu.be/ao-Sahfy7Hg

**yourfacesucksass** (9): Okay we're all trash for loving this song since we're the people that Black Mirror was criticizing but idgaf because I already knew my reflection was dark as hell when this came out.

**notdallin** (8.6): wait this song is a meme? I thought it was just a good song

**camerinian** (8.5): Y'all need to learn that ironic songs aren't necessarily meme songs, cos I haven't seen this shit’s memes anywhere outside of the circlejerk sub. It do slap tho

**1998tweety** (8): It's cute....I mean it bops a bit but the way y'all gag about it you would think its the best pop song ever.

**bandnitos** (8): i wonder how many twinks are gonna give this an 11

**Maybe9** (8): im adding this to my library unironically

**moooo566** (8): apparently trent reznor said this song isn't his anymore

**timothy444** (8): Terrible black mirror episode, good pop song, doesn't belong on a meme rate though

**vayyiqra** (8): I wasn't aware this was a meme, but I remember seeing it and I don't know what to even think of it. I guess I am going to give a high rating because it's a great parody of 2010s electropop videos (Gaga and Ariana vibes here), Miley looks great with purple hair, and I feel like I would like Black Mirror if I watched it, which I haven't. The song itself is just mid, but the concept is cool.

**wavingwolves** (8): the way the lyrics are so BAD but the production is actually GOOD sends me. they didn't even try but we still ate this shit up

**alwayswords** (7): points docked just bc i dont consider this song a real meme

**lil\_foofy** (7): If we weren't doing a meme rate I would have given it like, an 8.4.

**Qwilpish** (7): NOT A MEME. but its a bop so I will rate it still high. i stay achievin my goals

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): The second best song based on a Nine Inch Nails sample that featured a Cyrus family member released in 2019

**Roxieloxie** (6.6): this is better than anything in the bangerz era

# I prefer Younger Now Miley

**Ambelliina** (6): i havent watched black mirror but i kinda dig the concept of an electropop reimagining of head like a hole

**coin-cache** (6): I'll admit I don't know why this is a meme song. It's fine though.

**hikkaru** (6): never got the immense hype for this one sorry. ally outsold with why did you do that, periodt

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): generic pop, not even memey enough

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Miley sweetie... This is not funny or catchy enough to be a good meme or parody.

**cultofbabies** (2.7): it's just kinda boring

**geekysheep\_** (2): its fine but i dont watch black mirror and how is this a meme?

**fadedblue09** (0): Not bad but why was this here?

**mysario** (0): not a meme song nor is it bad? not really sure its relevance in this rate honestly. did we not want OTR but still wanted Trent Reznors impact...? it's the #BabyNut of songs

liek if u shed tear evry tiem

To be honest, I am surprised this song made it this high on the list. I find it hilarious but I didn’t think it would beat some other things on here as it is intentionally very bad. But the power of a bad recorder is transcendental I suppose. 

---

# outsold Celine

**Maybe9** (11): this is the theme song of my life

**1998tweety** (10): So emotional, a classic

**camerinian** (10): I’d like to submit this as supplementary Matt Mulholland content https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ99VJ72crY

**Corn\_and\_rice** (10): beautiful, brings tears to my eyes

**DaHumanTorch** (10): can't wait for this to play at my funeral

**evilqueenlex** (10): this will be my wedding song

**geekysheep\_** (10): can i give everything a ten

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): i love the third grade

**lil\_foofy** (10): The emotion! The passion! The iconic-ness! I-- CO-- NIQUE!

**ManofOranges** (10): In this biting critique of the excessive polish that the music industry likes to push onto artists, Matt Mulholland dials back the vocals and takes a more amateur approach, playing the classic elementary school instrument known as the recorder and evoking feelings of mediocrity and perseverance in the face of potential embarrassment. This is truly an anthem for the people

**moooo566** (10): beautiful, transcendent, words cannot describe

**poppinmmolly** (10): my sister and I loved this so much we showed it to our family at a gathering and everyone was crying with laughter, so now it's a family meme too.

**Qwilpish** (10): Celine Dion wishes she could still hit these notes

**ReallyCreative** (10): it's still so hard to not bust out laughing to this song all these years later omg

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Okay I ALMOST gave this my 11. This is one of my favorite meme songs to break out on people. Because surprisingly not a lot that I know have heard it. But as a fellow recorder player… well former recorder player, I understand that shit is hard to master, and this shows you just how fucking hard it is by sounding like absolute SHIT. And that’s what makes it amazing. Also, when the background vocals kick on the karaoke track under the recorder, glorious. If you’ve never seen this video, I urge you to. It’s so overly dramatic that you just can’t help but love it.

**rickikardashian** (10): I feel that having this would have improved the Titanic by a lot

**skargardin** (10): Listen, I played the recorder for ten years yall WILL give it the respect it deserves!!! The lack of control as they try to hit the high notes is sending me places

**static\_int\_husp** (10): yes this score is ironic but so is this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): liek this if you cri evrytiem :(

**TiltControls** (10): Can celine play recorder? Didn't think so.

**timothy444** (10): Very emotional song and I almost cried

**coin-cache** (9): inspirational. perfect. the high note at the end.

**materialqirl** (9): this is SO sad

**Roxieloxie** (9): i have never heard the original version and i dont think i need to after this

**SunshineMarmot101** (9): yes!

**wavingwolves** (9): sad

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): I remember randomly seeing this on YouTube one day, and the cinematography and dissolve effects are just Oscar worthy.

**agentofscranton** (8): recorder number one on the instruments rate

**bbfan132** (8): better than the original

**HoodooMooJuice** (8): I'm sort of impressed, I was never this good at the recorder.

**waluigiest** (8): as an avid recorder player I both love this and despise it

**bespectacIed** (7): iconic meme

**notdallin** (6): please someone tell me in the comments if they’ve actually made love to this and how it was

# failed music class in elementary school

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I have decided to go on a soul-searching trip in the vast and beautiful African Savannah.

**cultofbabies** (5.5): it has never stopped being extremely funny

**bandnitos** (5): i really don't get the hype

**Tolk1en** (5): this one was the hardest to rate. This covers carry some emotion.

**SFbby** (4): Points for trying

**vayyiqra** (3): No. I don't even like the original song, but why is this a meme? Recorders are annoying. Titanic is still a great movie though fite me

**Ambelliina** (2): this was pretty funny the first time i heard it but every time i hear someone insert the first couple seconds of the chorus into a video for a Funny Meme Joke my rating goes farther down

**fadedblue09** (1): Sorry this was bad. Meme music still needs to sound good cause replay value is something memes must have, y’know?

**NBA-Mark** (1): Actually unlistenable, but I guess that's the point

I remember watching Dan and Phil playing Undertale but I never finished watching them do their playthrough…maybe I should come back to that like 5 years later haha.
Looks like we had a lot of Undertale fans here but we also had a lot who had no connection to this song since they didn’t watch or play Undertale. 

---

# Cult Classic

**CarlieScion** (11): yas

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a serve, maybe straights made a point or 2 stanning this

**agentofscranton** (10): i feel like i'm about to have a very bad time

**Ambelliina** (10): i dont actually like this song THAT much but this is going to be my only ever opportunity to rate (technically) homestuck music in a rate so im giving it a goddamn 10. although it would be funnier and more relevant if i gave it an 8 ::::)

**anothertown** (10): the finest opening notes in all of music i would say.

**bandnitos** (10): a serious 11 contender

**cultofbabies** (10): i am actually having a very good time mr sans

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): The praise this game's music has gotten is so well deserved, especially this song. I'm so proud of him.

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): Fingers in MY ass sunday

**lil\_foofy** (10): Also, great work on the Pokemon Sword/Shield music, Toby!

**ManofOranges** (10): If yall don't remember the amount of attention that Undertale drew, then you must've been living under a rock or sumn. Undertale didn't have to do what it did, and yet it did, and I love it for that.

**mysario** (10): may be one of the best boss battles of all time

**Qwilpish** (10): I really really love this song and its in Smash! Its one of the few very memorable songs from video games and Im glad it blew up how it did

**ReallyCreative** (10): Has anyone in this rate suffered from success quite like Megalovania? An iconic bop and genuinely one of the BEST video game music tracks, it's time to give this bop what she deserves.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Certified triple platinum bop.

**skargardin** (10): periodt

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): omg its sands undertale the mr. fingers in his ass man 😳

**TiltControls** (10): I can't bring myself to touch the game after the good end :(

**timothy444** (10): I love Ness's boss theme!

**wavingwolves** (10): undertale fans rise the fuck up

**alasyorick** (9.9): so happy toby fox broke out of andrew hussie’s basement

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): let's make this the highest rated instrumental ever. wall fuck died for this

**camerinian** (9): yo I've never actually listened to the original before, just heard the melody in places, and this fucking goes hard jesus

**materialqirl** (9): sighs..

**SunshineMarmot101** (9): genuinely good song

**waluigiest** (9): last summer I was an RA for high school students and they really loved this song lmfao

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): OHHHHH MY GOD THE INNER HOMESTUCK IN ME CRAWLED OUT DFHGKJSDFGJ??? PUT IT BACK???

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): do you wanna have a bad time? I mean I’m sure as fuck not with Megalovania. Honestly, Toby Fox kills it with his video game music, and this is a prime example of that. Going back to the first time I watched someone play this battle I was SHOCKED. Like… This is one of those video game battles that is notoriously so hard that you just do NOT forget it. And that intro dialogue from Sans oh my god. It starts normal then BAM and you’re thrown into the fight. Honestly very iconic of Toby all around. Now where the fuck is Delatrune?

**Corn\_and\_rice** (8): A really good fighting theme that gets you pumped, i would like it even outside of the meme (but death by glamour is better)

**Maybe9** (8): finally some good fucking vgm

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Too LONG.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i really need to play undertale, idk how i havent yet

**hikkaru** (7): undertale has been sitting, unplayed, gathering dust in my steam library for like five years now. please pray for her.

**Roxieloxie** (7): my ex unironicaly put this on a playlist titled "calm down cheer up :)"

# Sans and Papyrus are the worse fonts

**moooo566** (6): height of bravery here, i dont really like undertale

**notdallin** (6): should’ve been [shop]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxYPcj5AxG4) :\

**bbfan132** (5): this song triggers no emotions in me.

**coin-cache** (5): I'd imagine this song would have more impact if I actually got to sans. Otherwise toby's music never did much for me other than a few songs.

**evilqueenlex** (5): another song I'm surprised is a meme

**vayyiqra** (5): Why is this a meme though? I don't get it. It's not even funny, it's just there. It could be soundtrack music from any "edgy" SNES game. I guess it's catchy, but that doesn't make it a good meme.

**geekysheep\_** (3): how is this a meme

The epicentre of Youtube. Always in the recommendations after spending hours on it even if you are somewhere else completely unrelated.
Most people thought this was an internet classic however there were a handful of people who just couldn’t stand this. This was another song that was in the top 5 at one point. 

---

# He Man is King

**anothertown** (11): AND HE PRAYS!

**evilqueenlex** (11): i was very persistent in trying to get my friends, family, and boyfriend at the time into this song but no one got it. no one comprehended the love I had for this song. no one understood my connection to this song but this song is definitely on all levels except physical, ME (which makes sense why they didn't get it). i feel seen. it is a religious and sexual experience. i am blessed to exist in the same time as this song. this song, along with cockroaches and gloria gaynor, will SURVIVE.

**alwayswords** (10): bohemian rhapsody of memes

**Ambelliina** (10): this is one of the most iconic, classic memes of all time. no matter how many times i watch/listen to this it literally NEVER gets old. probably in the top 5 if not top 3 best memes ever. seriously i love this SO much its unironically much better than the original song. i can remember the exact spelling of HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA off the top of my head without having to look it up. also its an iconic gay anthem im going to be really disappointed if this doesnt make at least top 5

**ExtraEater** (10): Gay anthem

**geekysheep\_** (10): its just so good

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): A contender for my 11. Iconic!

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): GAY ANTHEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**lil\_foofy** (10): One of the most iconic meme songs!

**ManofOranges** (10): This bitch is tenured. This song is the teacher who's been teaching at the school for like 20 years longer than any other teach in the fold and so she's seen things that like none of the other teachers have seen and she has stories that you're not even totally sure are true but like you believe her because you know who she is and what she's done and you just have to respect her for that.

**NBA-Mark** (10): Lich-rally history luv. Better than the original

**Qwilpish** (10): AAANDD HE PRAYYS (oh my god oh he prays)

**rickikardashian** (10): I never knew if this was like fanmade it an actual thing the studio went out of their way to make, either way it turned He-Man into a gay icon

**Roxieloxie** (10): do you know how shook i was when i watched sense8 and i heard the actual version playing

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Four Non Blondes outsold.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): This was my favorite video of all time for a solid three years growing up

**TiltControls** (10): ok but also let's recognize the fantastic don't cry out loud splice

**timothy444** (10): A song that both the straights and gays can enjoy

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this video STILL sends me oh my god

**camerinian** (9.5): I don't know who spawned this into the universe or what possibly could have compelled them to do so, and I don't think I ever want to learn

**materialqirl** (9.5): must i EXPLAIN

**bespectacIed** (9): Yup, only the mental illness that comes with being gay could conjure this perfection

**coin-cache** (9): I completely forgot about the sample near the end (3:04). One of the best meme songs from the 2000s imo.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I know people whose entire sense of humor is this song and it almost makes it unbearable but it truly shines through

**wavingwolves** (9): ok but is he man a gay icon

**bandnitos** (8): i heard this before i heard the original version

**mysario** (8): twice as good as the 4 Non Blondes version

**waluigiest** (8): I had never seen the intro before!!! Kinda wish I hadn’t tho :/

**cultofbabies** (7.3): infinitely better as a gay club anthem than being sang by some white lady with dreads in a steampunk hat

**Corn\_and\_rice** (7): Great, a true classic

**cremeebrulee** (7): sense8 did it better sorry

# What’s going on

**vayyiqra** (6): This song was funny for a little bit but I was never that into it. Unlike some of these meme songs that age like a fine wine, it gets annoying very, very fast. I still lol at the falsetto "and I try" part though.

**1998tweety** (5): So overrated, tbh the song isn't actually that bad it's just the vocalist that completely butchers it.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5): I love this one but it’s a little overrated. Like this is a classic meme but ehhhhhh, I’ve heard it so many times in my life that it has lost its magic.

**SunshineMarmot101** (4): Nothing against He Man, it's What's Up that's bad

**notdallin** (3.7): honestly, the bad lip reading of the cartoon is by far the best part of this song

**Maybe9** (3): its good, but this song is why the internet is homophobic

**DaHumanTorch** (2): my biggest takeaway from this rate is that put your hearts up by ariana grande sampled this?? wtf

**bbfan132** (1): luv what is dis mess

Okay this song is a massive bop. Like the production is great, it’s fun and actually a good kids song (sorry Baby Shark).
This song was actually Number One (*horns*) at one point in the rate. However by the time the last 20-30 scores or so came in it went down a lot all the way to 9th. I personally think this should have been top 5 but I guess it was too annoying for a handful of tasteless people. 

---

# number one on the Billboard Hot 100

**camerinian** (11): Some of these memes passed me by, or I was never fully invested in. This was one I followed religiously, and I will love until the day the internet gets wiped out by an asteroid or some shit. Like, of course this song made for actual god damn toddlers to watch on Nickelodeon is basically the catchiest, most manic thing in existence, but there is no reason that melody should be able to stand up to repeated plays so well, much less be able to compete with actual real serious ska music made for adults, but it fucking does, and it does so well. Add the fact that every single line in this thing has meme appeal for days, as evidenced by how long this meme lasted for given the ADD nature of the internet, and the fact that the backstory of this meme is the single most tragic but wholesome lore in the history of memes, and the fact that the creators of this song seemingly did everything in their power to facilitating the creativity of people online, and gah this is the perfect meme. CRONCH

**mysario** (11): ska lives matter

**plaguebub** (11): from a musical standpoint as well as a meme one

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, rest in peace king.

**agentofscranton** (10): rip stefan karl stefansson

**alwayswords** (10): lazy town scares me

**bandnitos** (10): rest in peace king :(

**Corn\_and\_rice** (10): love this song and the remixes

**DaHumanTorch** (10): https://tenor.com/view/classic-mariah-carey-classy-loved-it-gif-5666631

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Rotten deserved a Grammy for this performance!

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): RIP king...

**ManofOranges** (10): Lazy Town was THE shit. It is on par with Spongebob in terms of kids show iconicity. Robbie especially. He was a villain, but he's also a legend.

**ReallyCreative** (10): iconic legend iconic bop

**Roxieloxie** (10): i want you all to know everytime i hear bad guy my brain thinks its this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Honestly in terms of the creativity people put into videos for this song, and the reason for this song becoming a meme in the first place was to raise awareness for Stefan’s cancer, this was probably one of the best memes in recent memory. RIP to a legend, and while we’re here this is my favorite WANO related video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC-g_BiBJME

**timothy444** (10): Siivagunner blessed us with this dank meme

**anothertown** (9): F

**coin-cache** (9): I think that the reasoning behind this becoming a meme alone makes this one of the best meme songs.

**geekysheep\_** (9): so good

**materialqirl** (9): RIP :(

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): RIP to a legend

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): Lazy Town was one of my favorite shows as a small being so of course I fucking knew this show before the meme, BUT I NEVER EXPECTED IT TO BE A MEME. Lazy Town was always just that really strange and colorful show with strange ass characters. To be fair that’s pretty good setup for a meme itself, but when you’re 6 you’re not thinking of that. Honestly the most iconic Villain song of the last like 20 years. Everyone else go home, Robbie Rotten outsold you. Also, I just realized that this was part of the “Revived series” of Lazy Town, kinda never realized there was a revival. So, hey that’s cool! Glad a whole other generation got to experience that crazy ass show.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.2): video is terrifying

**Ambelliina** (8): ive admittedly gotten a little sick of this one from overplay but its still better than most ska songs and i want to pay respect to the man stefan RIP so 8 it is

**rickikardashian** (8): this is actually very good in each aspect I'm considering, but I have to take off points because the grand majority of people that really loved this meme and ran it to death are annoying as shit

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I would very much like to get put in the special section for Billie Eyelash Bad Guy comments because this hook actually is better.

**waluigiest** (8): run away with me outsold

Never heard the song in full until now. It’s actually pretty decent and I was not expecting that for some reason.
Looks like many people here also enjoyed this track a lot genuinely, although some people just didn’t care for it (or the memes this provided) too.  

---

# you’re a shining star

**cremeebrulee** (11): there was really no other choice .....

**hikkaru** (11): some of my scores may or may not be fueled by irony, but this one is 100% a legitimate BANGER. when the production builds to that moment near the end i nut

**timothy444** (11): Legitimately amazing electronic track

**vayyiqra** (11): I love this song with all my heart, and always will. You might laugh, but this music video means a lot to me. It's a really moving and pure expression of male friendship, and we need more of that. Also, it has surfing on cars in outer space. That's an important message too.

**agentofscranton** (10): god i wish this didn't become a meme because you just KNOW this song would be a massive club smash if it wasn't

**camerinian** (10): This is easily my most listened to track on this list, because the bit that wasn't memed about at the end of the track is a seriously beautiful and jubilant crescendo and release that I love deeply and whole-heartedly. This song just gives me those warm fuzzy late night vibes the same way that a song like Midnight City does. Add on the fact that the continuous increase of pitch on the main melody is genuinely chillingly well done, and the lyrics really ramp up to that hopeful bend incredibly, and I'm happy to give this track my longest yeah boi ever. So, so close to my 11

**evilqueenlex** (10): it's a meme but this is legitimately a song.

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Everything about this song is honestly perfection. Issa vibe

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok actually a bop but I'm not surprised

**Qwilpish** (10): reinvented vaporwave for a new generation

**rickikardashian** (10): unironically so fucking good

**skargardin** (10): huge banger, I have never really cared for or gotten this meme but the song is genuinely great

**TiltControls** (10): my favourite song on the list, but there are better memes out there

**worlds-okayest666** (10): a transcendal experience

**1998tweety** (9): I've never actually heard the lyrics on this, it's cute.

**Ambelliina** (9): this is GENUINELY a really good song and one of the best Meme Songs ever. the way it spends so long on the verse and the buildup to that blissful chorus that carries it all the way to the end.. its great

**bespectacIed** (9): It's a really cute track but of course everyone just knows the annoying but iconic melody. The chorus is really beautiful. I wish the two dudes on the MV kissed, they had lots of sexual tension

**geekysheep\_** (9): the vine and tiktok energy is strong in this one

**ImAMemeDuh** (9): why do I kinda ship the dj’s together after that video

**lil\_foofy** (9): I like how it matches perfectly with the Windows 95 dancing baby screensaver. Don't confirm, just trust me!

**loloeffeff** (9): an actual bop even before it became a meme

**materialqirl** (9): mood

**ReallyCreative** (9): An actual bop that deserved to be a viral sensation, not my favorite of this rate but I won't be mad if it wins

**saucymac** (9): ok but this is actually a pretty chill tune

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): why is the music video for this song so horny

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): Legit have never heard of this song until the meme. So who is that one holy being who found this gem of a tune and saw its potential, because bitch u got it. B.O.B. & Hayley Williams are filing their lawsuit as we speak.

**alwayswords** (8): i will not forgive this song for ruining the swish swish mv

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): DO DO DODODO DO DO. Okay real talk, this full song kinda slaps. Also the video has that fucking outrun aesthetic I love so much. Also when this comes back in after the like drop or whatever bruhhhhh that’s sooooo good.

**Roxieloxie** (8): is this charli xcx

**SunshineMarmot101** (8): is this a meme song? just a good song imo

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Video was ugly, but I do love the beats though.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): good

**Corn\_and\_rice** (7): A solid song

**Maybe9** (7): m83 walked so bag raiders could run ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**NBA-Mark** (7): Seem's like the type of shit I'd be into but it just didn't connect for me

**notdallin** (7): who created the meme format using this random riff from a 2009 song? I just wanna talk

**waluigiest** (7): I never considered that this was a real song

**cultofbabies** (6.8): a very pleasant time

# crashing stars

**bbfan132** (6): i thought this was a daft punk song oop

**letsallpoo** (6): katy lowkey ruined this meme

**rslashpoopheads** (6): im horny

**SFbby** (6): The best part of the song is the memed part

**bandnitos** (5): this song fills me with rage

**coin-cache** (5): I remember this being a meme but I don't know why. First time seeing the music video though and I can't tell if it's supposed to be serious. Otherwise the song doesn't really do anything for me.

**LesApfels** (4): low-effort memery

**DaHumanTorch** (3): this meme wasn't ever funny and the song is absolutely unbearable to listen to most of the way through aside from the final breakdown which wasn't bad

What a groundbreaking song for the internet culture. Aqua honestly paved the way for all your favourites who make weird catchy songs with double meaning.
Barbie Girl is another song that isn’t exactly a pure meme but rather a viral sensation that has been popular on the internet for years due to its lyrics and general catchiness and weirdness. Most people enjoy this song here but a lot of people also were indifferent about it as it wasn’t super meme-y. 

---

# life in plastic, it’s fantastic

**coin-cache** (11): 2nd best meme song of the 90s.

**saucymac** (11): how can this not be an 11? It's so iconic it's still a total banger today. Aqua do not get the respect they deserve.

**1998tweety** (10): One of my masc friends in elementary school liked barbie girl and I had it on my mp3 player so we would sit need to each other on the bus with one earbud each listening to it. That's probably the gayest experience I've had tbh. This unironically bops, I would like to see it top 5 AT LEAST.

**agentofscranton** (10): gay culture

**alwayswords** (10): i unironically still listen to this song regularly

**bandnitos** (10): A FUCKING CLASSIC

**bbfan132** (10): this actually bops tho…..

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is an absolute banger and is a brilliant satire of the materialistic, perfection-obsessed culture we live in...CMON BARBIE LETS GO PARTY

**evilqueenlex** (10): only bad bitches had this as their ringtone on their pink motorola razr

**hikkaru** (10): classic

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): the video has 700 million views on youtube

**lil\_foofy** (10): A score I attribute to the brilliant lyric "kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky."

**ManofOranges** (10): Barbie and ken snapped so hard here there's a reason why the Barbie is the most prolific actress in the history of hollywood name any other girls out here who's been a mermaid, an astronaut, a princess, a pauper, and more

**materialqirl** (10): 90s cultural reset

**NBA-Mark** (10): One of the best pop songs of the '90s

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): HIYA BARBIE! HI KEN! This song is fucking iconic okay. I’m bopping my ass off rn man. I mean I’ve been a fan of this song since I was small being. Because oh man it’s iconic. Also loved playing it in Just Dance, that was always fun. Also, this video? Iconic. It’s just brightly colored dreams of bullshit but I love it. It’s unapologetically 90s. I too wanna be a Barbie Girl in a Barbie world. Guess you could say I’m having so muh fun.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Why is this in the meme rate??? It's just a good song, nothing to see here.

**skargardin** (10): Eurodance classic yup yup

**Tolk1en** (10): Song of my childhood, we were singing this during school breaks, iconic

**vayyiqra** (10): I've heard Aqua fans say that stanning this album was how they knew they were gay as kids, but instead, it was how I knew something else as a kid: that I was a pophead. It's such a bop, and I used to think the lyrics were kind of dumb as a kid (ew Barbies are dolls and for girls, that's dumb, who would play with Barbies) but did a 180 once I realized they were a sendup of heterosexual gender roles and pop music's obsession with sex (which, in the 90s perhaps even more than now, was blatant as ever). As silly as it may sound, as a het who despises gender roles this actually means a lot to me??? Scandinavians are as always ahead of the game when it comes to pop music and politics.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): a literal classic

**yourfacesucksass** (10): The real bitch came back to reclaim Barb! Kitsch? Check! Innuendos? Check! Hotel? Sleazy and trashed because we rode Trivago so hard we lowered his prices. That overall, is this song. The only reason I didn't give it 11 was because I thought something else was more "meme"

**LesApfels** (9.5): Ok but the Bubblegum Bass genre owes so much to this song

**loloeffeff** (9.5): one of the best pop songs of all time tbh

**fadedblue09** (9): I thought Aqua was a solo female act.

**waluigiest** (9): Honestly this is genuinely a bigger bop than I remember

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): it's a bop, but -.5 for the reference to "hanky panky"

**rickikardashian** (8.5): the sole reason as to why I can’t ever stan Ava Max is because that one song she made interpolating Barbie Girl’s chorus is straight up the most annoying pop song to ever exist

**anothertown** (8): i have wanted to live in this music video for decades now..

**Qwilpish** (8): Hanky Panky

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): idk anything about aqua outside of this song but i appreciate the gay pitbull in the music video

**wavingwolves** (8): this song creeps me the fuck out but it's so good

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.7): when i was younger i got an mp3 player for christmas and this was the only song on it so i was forced to listen to it on repeat lmao

**Maybe9** (7): trixie found dead

**timothy444** (7): A catchy 90's bop and a song of my childhood! I hope this song doesn't win the rate though because it's not memey enough

# Bimbo girls (and gays)

**notdallin** (6.4): such bittersweet elementary school memories of riding the schoolbus to the pool while the really funny kids would shout “COME ON BARBIE LET’S GO POTTY”

**cultofbabies** (6.1): an indisputable classic. loses some decimal points because i don't like how ken says "hanky panky"

**Ambelliina** (6): this would be better if it werent for the weird bald dude

**Corn\_and\_rice** (6): I like it as a meme but as a song meh

**geekysheep\_** (6): genuinely a great song but not a meme imo

**ReallyCreative** (6): I actually don't have many strong feelings about this song, which perhaps makes it fall short in a meme rate

**SunshineMarmot101** (6): solid

**SFbby** (5): Everyone knows this song, but everyone also knows how annoying the high-pitched voice is

**bespectacIed** (4): It's harmless camp, I guess. The eurodance sound is tricky to me: sometimes it could sound nostalgic and retro-futuristic, sometimes so annoyingly dated ... barbie girl sadly is the latter.

**camerinian** (4): look, maybe i’ve still got that ingrained pre-poptimist angry white boy somewhere in me, but this song still annoys the shit out of me and I do not know why people gravitate to such an irritating melody. Enjoy it if you want, but I just can’t and i don’t think I ever will

**Roxieloxie** (3): When i clicked on this playlist the first recomended video was titled, songs that white people go hard to

**mysario** (2): not really a meme song nor is it bad but the music video for this slaps

Did what the other girls couldn’t do!  Decide what seat to take even though only one seat was available! Although the rap verse is the most unnecessary rap verse of all time.
Rebecca Black paved the way for many other songs in this rate because of Friday. And looks like she finally got the props and love she deserved after all these years. I’m not going to lie, I trashed this song in middle school like everyone else but watching Rebecca grow up and talk about how this song changed her life for better or for worse makes me root for her more than ever. She did not deserved the overwhelming hate and when I went back to this video for the rate, I unclicked the dislike I gave it years ago. Not that it will change anything, but just cause it’s not worth a dislike anymore.

---

# fun fun fun fun

**LocalLosers** (11): She deserves it

**alwayswords** (10): a lot of people would be scared here a lot of people would be scared

**Ambelliina** (10): sorry haters but this is a masterpiece the only thing holding it back is patrice wilson rapping

**bbfan132** (10): her vocals here….. :despair: :cherry:

**DaHumanTorch** (10): still can't get over how she shades her friend on her left during the second verse

**ExtraEater** (10): Good then good now

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): queen shit

**LesApfels** (10): The original icon

**ManofOranges** (10): Rebecca Black did NOT deserve all that. Even if I entertain the idea that this song isn't good (which is not the case) Rebecca was just living her best life, making a music video, looking forward to the weekend. This song was ahead of its time and look where it landed Rebecca. She has an eternal spot in internet history. You did amazing sweetie. Thank you.

**materialqirl** (10): walked so 2012's pop scene could run

**mysario** (10): I always liked this song and I'm glad people are now respecting it for the iconic genius it is

**NBA-Mark** (10): Queen of calendars

**ReallyCreative** (10): we truly couldn't appreciate her in her time, but tell me, has the concept of Friday ever truly been the same since the release of this song?

**rickikardashian** (10): I unironically gave a Rebecca Black my 11 once. Just letting y'all know in case you wanted to found out how I am as a person

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Invented memes.

**SFbby** (10): Miss Rebecca Black invented the calendar

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Stan Rebecca Black’s post Friday work!

**timothy444** (10): Despite the blatant misuse of autotune, it's an alright effort for a pop song. Ironically still bop to this every Friday and because it's a meme rate I'm rating it higher than I would normally

**vayyiqra** (10): If you hate this song, you hate fun. If you can ignore the poorly autotuned vocals, it's unironically a bop. I love Friday and will NOT stand for any slander of it or Miss Rebecca Black.

**waluigiest** (10): This radicalized me in 8th grade. Honestly, I cannot overstate how important this song was to my development. I feel like this cultural moment is part of why I am so invested in pop music. This song came out and I drowned myself in Friday content. Every meme, every parody, every analysis video. And I genuinely enjoyed it. It became part of my identity; enjoying these huge pieces of camp pop culture unironically.

**wavingwolves** (10): queen

**1998tweety** (9): It's cute, her new music is for sure better but this was still a moment.

**Maybe9** (9): we we we so excited

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): A 9 for my favorite 9-year-old. Also, holy shit this song is that old huh? Honestly, this song pretty much spawned a lot of the other songs here. Also, hey I’m doing this rate on a Friday. Sadly, I’m not partying (I’m searching Insta for concert pics whoops, lowkey news source life), but fuck it I’m having fun with this song! Thanks Patrice, this song pretty much spawned your whole career man. Also, this song is gonna earworm me, I know it will. It’s gonna be 6am and I’m gonna be like “IT’S FRIDAY FRIDAY GOTTA GET DOWN ON FRIDAY”

**Roxieloxie** (9): its friday babey

**yourfacesucksass** (8.6): I'm whoreheartedly giving this song this score because it's iconique, the it girl of meme generation's origin. She is Mother Meme, and I am here to serve her.

**TiltControls** (8.5): I used to hate it, but it's actually kinda a bop??? Also Rebecca Black has been doing much better work

**camerinian** (8): the song is terrible but Rebecca Black is an inspirational icon and for that we stan

**lil\_foofy** (8): I actually felt bad for her around the time she released this. She seemed so sincere! Good that she's actually become a respected artiste!

**Qwilpish** (8): this song did not deserve death threats. its infinitely better than Chinese Food. this song is fun fun fun fun

**notdallin** (7.5): you know, this song all of a sudden feels VERY tame compared to a lot of the songs I just listened to. The 2011 gp REALLY needed to chill

**bandnitos** (7): i bought this on itunes when it came out like i fucking stanned

**loloeffeff** (7): listened to it too much in HS now it doesn't do much for me

**moooo566** (7): not actually a very good song but i can't bring it to myself to do her dirty

**fadedblue09** (6.8): Honestly the awful autotuned chorus ruins it for what could’ve been a guilty pleasure bop.

**cultofbabies** (6.5): it was never actually all that bad tbh

**evilqueenlex** (6.5): i find it funny that this is exactly what an 8th grader's songwriting + production of a party song would sound like except this was written and produced by a grown ass man

# I prefer Mondays

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): bad, but not as bad as i used to think it was

**coin-cache** (3): I don't like it but it definitely didn't deserve the backlash it got.

**skargardin** (3): Didn't deserve all of the immense hate it got but it is pretty bad

**Corn\_and\_rice** (2): no just no

**bespectacIed** (1): I think Rebecca Black's existence is a serve. I feel bad for the bad things she's been through, I am happy she made it out of them a strong, gorgeous young woman, and I wish her all the best. But this is hot garbaj

This fact that Shrek originally made this song popular, it faded away and then got popular again shows how iconic this is. Also Smash Mouth are LGBT allies so you better stan these woke kings!!
The love/hate for All Star was all over the place, this was number one briefly but also dropped below 10 as well. It finally evened out at #5 which is a sensible place for this semi-timeless song that resurged as a meme recently.

# SomeBODY once told me

**1998tweety** (10): Bop, the meme got a bit annoying but I'm not gonna let it affect the score.

**agentofscranton** (10): someBODY

**camerinian** (10): this gets a 10 solely for birthing most of Neil Cicierega's best ever music

**DaHumanTorch** (10): imagine not giving this a 10

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): a song i bought on itunes in 2013

**ReallyCreative** (10): the song of my childhood, a cultural reset... it was a cultural reset

**rickikardashian** (10): Same situation with We Are Number One, as a meme it got killed by literally the most annoying people on the internet, however, the highs this meme had were impeccable, and credit should be given when due, so I can't be mad at this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): witty comment

**CreepyMannequin** (9.5): we stan Mystery Men

**Qwilpish** (9): they dont stop comin and they dont stop comin and they dont stop comin and they dont stop comin

**timothy444** (9): Bit overplayed for me to fully give it a 10, but nonetheless it's a catchy classic and a good pop song

**waluigiest** (9): I genuinely think this song is good. The second verse was 20 years ahead of its time

**cultofbabies** (8.5): my favourite song about climate change

**notdallin** (8.4): can confirm, am also having the world roll me

**bespectacIed** (8): iconic. Early 2000s white trash culture is a moment

**SunshineMarmot101** (8): good

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): WELL THE YEARS START COMING AND THEY DON’T STOP COMING. This song may be a meme now but fuck those lyrics hit a certain spot. Let’s see, there’s climate change commentary, talk about how life is crazy shit, and I guess some positive messages in there too. Anyways, as Mr. Smash Mouth says: “Yep, what a concept.”

**SFbby** (7): Lost points cause the last All-stars rate was absolute trash

**skargardin** (7): boppy

# I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed

**Ambelliina** (6): smash mouth is actually really nostalgic for me bc when i was a kid they were one of the only things i listened to. i had their greatest hits album on my computer and i would legit just listen to it on repeat while playing flash games and stuff. i would go on club penguin and stand in front of the microphone and copy and paste the lyrics into the chat box while i listened to the smash mouth All Star Smash Hits. i loved Ain't No Mystery for some reason and those covers like Do It Again and Getting Better and ofc Why Can't We Be Friends were fire. also in retrospect Waste is genuinely a good song. anyway this one? its fine but i cant help but be a little tired of it from meme overexposure

**bandnitos** (5): https://soundcloud.com/dj-victor-borge/juice

**loloeffeff** (3): too heterosexual for my taste

**bbfan132** (1): i hate straight men 2.0

**fadedblue09** (1): Ah, so this is where that came from. Bleh. Overuse of the meme has made this annoying for me. Bye.

**vayyiqra** (0): No. I hate this song, I hate this meme, it's annoying, I hate Shrek, I want it to go away. I think the guys from Smash Mouth seem cool, I have nothing against them, I even think they have some good songs, but I never want to hear this again in my life.

# Shrek is love, Shrek is life

**Corn\_and\_rice** (10): I mean it't all stars it's a crime to give it less, Shrek is love, Shrek is life

**ManofOranges** (10): Yall this was probably one of the first songs where I fully remembered the lyrics. I just had to. Also I distinctly remembered listening to this song through a potter puppet pals video, which is a whole different can of worms that I don't wanna open. Also: S H R E K

**mysario** (10): a Shrekcellent addition

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): imagine what the world would be like if dreamworks used a different song for the montage in the beginning of shrek. that’s a dark future i dont want to imagine

**materialqirl** (9.7): stan Shrek

**wavingwolves** (9): i have never watched shrek but i still appreciate a bop

**yourfacesucksass** (8): I love how the song that Smash Mouth actually went in to record for Shrek isn't as associated to the film as this song, which is hilarious to me. The fact that they recorded a cover for the soundtrack but the meme generation was like, nah fam t h i s.

**coin-cache** (6): shrek aside, I always preferred walkin' on the sun.

**evilqueenlex** (6): overplayed but shrek is love, shrek is life

**Maybe9** (4): without shrek this song isnt as powerful

**NBA-Mark** (3): Shrek deserved better

These men gave TI, Rihanna and everyone at Youtube careers! You better put respect on their name! Overall looks like most people thought this was quite the bop, however it peaked at #4 and never took over the top 3 once.

# Numa Numa Yes

**ExtraEater** (11): A fossil

**midnightjasper** (11): this song reminds me of times when i was happy

**SunshineMarmot101** (11): timeless classic

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh such a bop, a definite contender for my 11. Hopefull the xenophobia doesn't jump out!

**bespectacIed** (10): A song so iconic, it has not one, but two different sound bites from it being viral and legendary. Also I'm just gonna say what everyone's afraid to say: the o-zone members are LOWKEY cute ....... i need professional help

**cremeebrulee** (10): why is this video so cute

**DaHumanTorch** (10): gonna tell my kids this was bts

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): another iconic misheard lyric video

**ManofOranges** (10): Romanian music goes so hard. None of the other pop guys or girls were doing it like O-Zone did it back in the day.

**rickikardashian** (10): lets be real, the video in the playlist isn't the one that turned this into the meme it's today, I do appreciate this slightly homoerotic one

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Numa Numa guy where u at?

**skargardin** (10): primary school banger [2]

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): MAIYA HE! MAIYA HOO! MAIYA HA! MAIYA HAHA!!!!

**timothy444** (10): I don't understand the lyrics to this but it bops

**vayyiqra** (10): Okay but this is a great Europop song and you all had not wit to see it. The lyrics are goofy (once you understand what they are even saying) but the video is a charming piece of Romanian Moldovan schlock that looks like it was made in the mid-90s and the song is an earworm. The video of that guy and his exaggerated stupid facial expressions can go. This song is genius.

**wavingwolves** (10): so many of these songs have brazilian versions i'm really questioning a lot right now

**fadedblue09** (9.7): Had no idea that THAT part in Live Your Life was actually a sample of this.

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): a sample that gave us one of rihanna's best features

**alwayswords** (9): that was a classic

**anothertown** (9): the sheer impact...

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): Oh no! They're hot!

**ReallyCreative** (9): another staple of marching band trips... we really never knew how good we had it

**notdallin** (8.8): I’m sad that [the actual artist]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk) wasn’t credited in this rate smh

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): JUST BOYBAND THINGS BABY! Time to gather some friends and dance on an airplane wing. I could only wish to have this much fun with a song if I was ever to make one. Also, I feel like this is one of those memes that is still used idk. On top of this, never seen the video in full before, love the little still shots.

**Ambelliina** (8): i was going to give this a 7 but considering its the most classic meme of the rate i have to honor it with an 8. besides 009 sound system, this is the anthem of early youtube (speaking of, dreamscape shouldve been in this rate)

**bandnitos** (8): i can't believe that rihanna and ti actually sampled this

**hikkaru** (8): rihanna ate

**lil\_foofy** (8): One of the most recognizeable meme songs.

**NBA-Mark** (8): Imagine not linking Numa Numa Guy https://youtu.be/MvUsHYJ3jaU

**waluigiest** (8): I really had no idea what this was from the title. Also this is more hype than I remember wow

**camerinian** (7): how has this melody not existed for all of time

**coin-cache** (7): It's good but I don't know if I would think much of it without the meme.

**materialqirl** (7): i..

**poppinmmolly** (7): a group of kids at my high school did a flash mob in 2010 to this song at the local grocery store but I was not invited and I'm still salty.

# Numa Numa No

**Corn\_and\_rice** (6): for nostalgia

**cultofbabies** (6): oh to be a european pop star in the early 00s with blonde highlights and tinted sunglasses

**Qwilpish** (6): poliwrath outsold

**bbfan132** (2): this is a song that i haven’t heard in a billion years. i don’t mind if i never hear it again.

**Maybe9** (2): no numa numa guy, this version is trash

I unironically like this song. Genuinely a great pop song! It’s impact is also legendary and the meme power of it was transcendental between generations. It broke the billion views barrier on Youtube and honestly nothing has been the same since. 
Even though this never received any 11’s somehow (people really gave 11’s to those bottom 5 songs huh), Gangnam style was well received overall by most people as it is a bop and actually one of the better songs here for most people. It was actually number 2 until the last handful of ballots came in through extensions and then it dropped to 3. 

---

# PSY broke down barriers for Kpop in Western Culture

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, definitely one of the best songs here.

**bespectacIed** (10): This madman did what SNSD, 2NE1, Wonder Girls, Big Bang couldn't do. This deliberately campy, novelty type of songs never amused me, not one fucking bit, but I'm still glad this song opened the floodgates for k-pop. Iconic isn't a big enough word.

**cultofbabies** (10): this song was ruined by being overplayed but now i barely hear it at all so it's good

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a cultural reset like no other

**fadedblue09** (10): Ok this is an actual ICONIC bop and the K-pop haters have no excuse this time around.

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): I solely blame this song for the K-pop craze.

**ManofOranges** (10): I still remember like it was yesterday when Gangnam Style became the first youtube video to hit 1 billion views. And it ABSOLUTELY deserved. Listen to the song. Watch the video. Literally there has never quite been a moment like this song. And I distinctly remember it hit 1 billion views around the same time as December 21 2012 so while I was shitting my pants thinking the world was gonna end (yes I was stupid), I was also playing this song on repeat. Even watching the video and listening now I get chills. Damn.

**Maybe9** (10): the most iconic song, in the history of iconic songs, maybe ever

**mysario** (10): heyyyyyyyyyyy sexy lay days

**notdallin** (10): the song and video that took the world by storm. I feel like the majority of kpop owes a lot of its success and popularity to Gangnam Style

**Qwilpish** (10): HYUNA! LEGENDS ONLY A legendary song. Literally outsold all of your oppas

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): PSY KOREAN LEGEND LET’S FUCKING GO!!!!!!! I guess this was technically my first exposure to K-Pop (Although I don’t count it as my first song, that’s I Got A Boy by SNSD as far as I’m concerned), but this was a fucking MOMENT. 2012 there was a hot ass moment where you could not escape that “OPPA GANGNAM STYLE” and even now to a degree you still can’t. You bring up K-Pop and on top of BTS, this is probably getting mentioned. It’s campy, the video is campy, HYUNA IS IN THE FUCKING VIDEO, it’s honest to fuck one of the most iconic K-Pop songs. And I know there’s people out there that are like “Man fuck that song, it’s a meme, it’s not iconic.” Well you know what, fuck you. I will pull out these dance moves on your grave. This song was literally a fucking movement, there was parodies, shirts, it was popping up all over pop culture that year. You name it, there was probably something Gangnam Style related for it. As much as you can sit and shit on this song, you can’t deny the impact it had. And that alone makes it iconic.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this was a fucking cultural moment.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Okay. Hear me out. It was July 15, 2012. I was staying over at my friend's place and everyone was asleep. I was just idly scrolling through r/kpop and I decided to click on this video because I was bored. The play count was stuck at 300+. Holy shit, I nearly burst out laughing amid the sleepers. And the song was so GOOD. Fast forward 6 months, and this white kid at school asks me if I've seen this funny video. And I watch it and it's literally GANGNAM STYLE, the song i have already listened to a hundred times and gotten sick of. And he says OMG GANG NAM STYLE IS SO FUNNY in that awful white people accent. And then I had to hear this stupid song all the time for another fucking 6 months. Anyways I have no idea where I was going with this but the point is I'm sick of it but it's still GOOD.

**skargardin** (10): We stan the pioneer of kpop's risen awarness for the gp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): The time when we all celebrated this song being the first song to hit 1 billion views on YouTube was the last time world was truly united

**timothy444** (10): The best k-pop song ever

**vayyiqra** (10): [Pretentious essay on how you need a very high IQ to understand Gangnam Style because it's really a satire on late capitalism and its effects on South Korean society] Oh and it's still a bop. Genius.

**wavingwolves** (10): in this house we love and respect psy as an artist

**LesApfels** (9.5): issa bop..

**ImAMemeDuh** (9): Despacito ended ha

**lil\_foofy** (9): Peak K-Pop meme right there.

**moooo566** (9): golden age meme

**NBA-Mark** (9): I can't believe Psy invented K-Pop

**waluigiest** (9): I haven’t listened to this in years and honestly it’s a bop and a half. I’m ready for the class war.

**materialqirl** (8.5): 3.5 billion views eye-

**bandnitos** (8): kpoppies rise up

**camerinian** (8): Ok I think it's about time this come back, right? This is the first time I've willingly listened to this in years and I didn't cringe nearly as much as I thought I would

**ReallyCreative** (8): a bop

**SunshineMarmot101** (8): yeah

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): Hated it then. I an appreciate it and respect its legacy now.

**Ambelliina** (7): its been so long since ive heard this song outside the context of an ironic meme and it was kind of annoying at the time it was popular, but now? honestly i cannot lie psy kinda went off with this one

**Corn\_and\_rice** (7): I like it, the dance defenetly ups the score

**geekysheep\_** (7): i forgot how good this was

# BTS outsold

**loloeffeff** (7): overrated tbh

**coin-cache** (6): I haven't listened to this since it originally came out. The chorus is pretty nice.

KING! Another song I just genuinely love. Remember when good songs would go viral? What a time!
And here we have our runner up! Did I end up Rick Rolling you guys into thinking this would win (tbd I still haven’t made a playlist for this rate reveal yet but I hope I did). This song was actually as low as 14th place at one point in the beginning and I was disgusted. But as the last ballots rolled in it slowly climbed back up to the top thankfully but it was never close enough to pass the Wii theme. 

---

# We will never let you down Rick Astley

**1998tweety** (11): An actual masterpiece, I'm so glad when songs that are actually good become viral memes (Say So as a recent example). We love a vocal king who serves choreo and a good message.

**anothertown** (10): could not have picked a better song to be one of the most popular memes of all time imo!

**bbfan132** (10): actually a good song.

**camerinian** (10): God remember when linking this instead of the GTA IV trailer was what trolling was? Instead of developing an intense quagmire of bot-driven politicised takes designed to normalise extremist ideals and deliberately inflammatory misinformation for the ultimate purpose of undermining sincere democracy? Haha funny dancing 80s man

**coin-cache** (10): probably THE meme song. It helps that it's a great song too.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): wow never expected popheads to rickroll me

**ExtraEater** (10): Greatest song ever made

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): I'm actually glad this is the song the internet decided needed to be heard by everyone on the planet because this is so good.

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): king shit

**lil\_foofy** (10): We have all been trolled with this song at one point in our lives.

**ManofOranges** (10): I know I say a LOT of bitches are ahead of their time, but like Rick Astley was literally ahead of his time. He created a song that became a hit not only when it was released but years after. He and this song are too good for this world.

**materialqirl** (10): walked so all other meme songs could run

**Maybe9** (10): i listen to the whole song every time i get rick rolled

**moooo566** (10): good song, good meme

**Qwilpish** (10): The first meme and a strong contender for one of the best ones.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): I UNIRONICALLY LOVE THIS SONG. Okay now that I’ve gotten that out of the way let’s talk. Never Gonna Fucking Give You Up. I mean, he’s straight to the point at least. Rick Astley clearly know what he wants to tell you. Also, 80s accidental meme songs are my favorite 80s songs (behind the synthpop and new wave). Fuck man, maybe it’s because it’s Valentine’s Day as I’m writing this and I had some interesting dreams last night, BUT FUCK MAN, I WANT A MAN TO TELL ME THAT HE’S NEVER GONNA GIVE ME UP. Also, I love how Rick Astley still like…. Loves this song.

**rickikardashian** (10): there's honestly nothing more humiliating, than to get Rick rolled in 2020. I would prefer death

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Okay this one actually invented memes.

**SFbby** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

**skargardin** (10): king tingz

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Fun fact: a guy at my work has a goal to Rick Roll every single person in the company and has a system set up to tell him who has already been through it

**SunshineMarmot101** (10): classic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): people who get rick rolled but dont listen to the full song afterwards are cowards who will not survive the winter

**timothy444** (10): Solid 80's bop! Even without the rickroll aspect of it, Never Gonna Give You Up is a timeless catchy tune!

**vayyiqra** (10): Rick Astley, with this song, achieved the impossible and made a "nice guy" song with "girl I'm so devoted to you, I'll never hurt you" lyrics that actually made him sound like a genuinely nice guy. It could've been so cringe, yet instead he comes across as a true gentleman. I would trust Rick Astley if he wanted to date my daughter. Hell, I would trust him to date me. Aside from that, he is a true king for acknowledging the meme in good humour and even rickrolling the public on at least one occasion.

**wavingwolves** (10): rick astley hot?

**mysario** (9.9): the song kinda overstays its welcome after a while but that first minute is just too good

**notdallin** (9.4): [still the best interaction on twitter]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

**hikkaru** (9): THE classic

**cultofbabies** (8.5): i saw rick astley live a few years ago and he's very much still got it

**Ambelliina** (8): this is genuinely a great 80s banger and im glad people are waking up to that. getting rickrolled now is actually kind of a treat. sometimes i just sit and listen to the whole song after like "oh cool, its never gonna give you up, lets fucking jam." also rickrolling is a strong contender for the most iconic meme of all time. shoutout to rick astley telling that dude to go fuck himself

**yourfacesucksass** (8): This entire rate it making me realize how old I am now. The days where every video was a Rick roll. It seems like decades ago, which it literally is now. It almost doesn't seem like it ever happened because YouTube was still such a baby then. But y'all wait, remember X-Factor US when Demi chose this song for Paige to sing as her redemption song after weeks of underperforming?

**alwayswords** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL-hNMJvcyI

**bespectacIed** (7): Literally the first time I've ever come to this video that isn't from a rickroll. This is THE meme. But outside of that this is a cute synthpop song, I just hate rick's deepass voice

**waluigiest** (7): is this the first meme?

# Will run around and desert you

**LesApfels** (6.5): Rectangle girls of the world outsold

**Corn\_and\_rice** (6): for nostalgia

**loloeffeff** (6): also overrated tbh

**ReallyCreative** (5): ehh

**bandnitos** (3): this hurts

MAIN! POP! GIRL! CAME! THROUGH!
And here we have our rate winner! This song was always doing well since the beginning but really took off after 40 or so ballots and never looked back since. It was on top completely for the last week or so and it beat Rick Astley by 30-ish points.

# Nintendo stans

**Corn\_and\_rice** (11): the only song I could listen to for hours

**ImAMemeDuh** (11): No words, yet still iconic. Only nintendo could pull off such a feat

**lil\_foofy** (11): I give this my eleven because of how versatile this meme song is.

**ManofOranges** (11): Possibly the funkiest song ever created. This deserves to be the national anthem.

**Roxieloxie** (11): maybe if the wii u could do this it wouldn't have flopped

**1998tweety** (10): A masterpiece, better than most of the songs here.

**agentofscranton** (10): this was a cultural reset

**alwayswords** (10): youtube drama videos have kinda ruined this song for me

**anothertown** (10): and that’s on Kazumi Totaka, who composed this song along with the Wii Shop Channel theme, the original Animal Crossing music, Wii Sports, and the yoshi games, and was the Japanese namesake for KK Slider

**cremeebrulee** (10): omg I wish I still had an 11 to give (also the version with My Neck My Back playing over this .... so GOOD)

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is so iconic...literally anyone knows exactly what song it is by any 1 second clip of it, if that isn't impact idk what is

**evilqueenlex** (10): all the great content milked from this song

**fadedblue09** (10): Ok but this is unironically ART. One of the few tracks I actually bothered to finish listening to. I could give this an 11 too if it was possible

**hikkaru** (10): BOP

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Lowkey catchy as hell and relaxing, it does it all! This is the definition of a smooth bop!

**loloeffeff** (10): best video game song of all time no hesitation

**materialqirl** (10): remix is better but this slaps too

**Maybe9** (10): if it was the unsatisfying remix it would be an 11 forsure, but neverless a very powerful meme

**Qwilpish** (10): Nintendo outsold all your favs and thats that

**ReallyCreative** (10): a cultural anthem

**rickikardashian** (10): this is like an universal meme, it's for everyone, edge lords, tik tok kids, white girls watching drama channels on YouTube, people that see tweets on Instagram, everyone can enjoy the beauty of the Mii channel theme

**SFbby** (10): Mozart could never

**skargardin** (10): Actually an amazing shopping theme - it SNAPPED

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): gamer kids rise up for the nostalgia anthem

**TiltControls** (10): The type of music robots would make based off assumuptions of what people liked. And they would be 100% right

**timothy444** (10): Should've reviewed the Wii Shop Channel theme instead but this is still a serve

**waluigiest** (10): I spent SO much time with this music as a child. In addition to being a fantastic meme and video game song, it’s just a good composition.

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm just vibing

**yourfacesucksass** (10): Fuck do I really need to justify it???

**notdallin** (9.9): I can see it all now as he balances on his wii fit balance board and carefully adjust the height of the eyes to shape his polygonal silhouette into exact likeness of his ideal body shape. “There” I say as I wipe the sweat from my upper lip, “he’s finally done.” I power down the machine and the blinding white plaza suddenly turns off. “That’s enough workout for one day now that I have my Mii. Tomorrow I’ll start my wii fit training.” He never did.

**Ambelliina** (9): not only is this song absolutely iconic in a meme sort of way, but also i genuinely really love stuff that sounds like elevator music and so this one appeals to me a lot musically too

**SunshineMarmot101** (9): good

**coin-cache** (8): Honestly the nintendo console themes (?) are all good, even later consoles like the 3ds.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): When will your faves? Oh that's right, they won't!

**cultofbabies** (7.1): the wii had the best aesthetic of any console ever

**camerinian** (7): Wii Shop Channel is better don’t @ me

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Nintendo put game soundtracks on streaming challenge

# PC Gaming outsold

**bandnitos** (6): i am in band. if i hear someone play this again i am bashing in their instrument

**bbfan132** (6): whenever i hear this, i think i’m watching a tea video now

**bespectacIed** (6): mood

**mysario** (6): I respect its iconic impact as a meme song but I'm so sick of hearing it at this point

**moooo566** (5): i was an original xbox kid so this does nothing for me

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5): Listen boys it’s literally my mind because I’m typing this two hours later because I had to take a break due to eating and other things like breaking down mentally for a bit. Okay so fun fact, the Wii was my first (and only) console. Yeah, I spent a lot of time in Mii channel trying to perfect my Mii. No, it never did look like me. Curly hair problems am I right? Honestly if this would have been a specific Mii channel meme this would have been more fun.

**vayyiqra** (5): This is the most bland, inoffensive piece of music ever written. It's not a good meme, neither is a bad meme. It is nothing. It is empty. What Zen Buddhists call "mu". The song that is not a song.
