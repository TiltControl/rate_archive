[Hello Popheads](https://imgur.com/a/7e20K5N)

After ~~great~~ deliberation amongst the rate selection panel, we have narrowed down what songs we will be rating for our first (and maybe only idk) Meme/Worst Of Song Rate! Songs were selected based off the top 50 comments of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/euvxaj/popheads_meme_rate_song_submission_voting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) I made last week and were narrowed down from that selection.

Selections were based on whether we have already rated the song in past and whether it was iconic enough of a meme song (or bad enough) that would fit in with the rest of the chosen songs (e.g. songs that had memes only based off one line in the song were cut). I know I originally said 30-35 songs however since there were too many good choices and we wanted an even number of songs, we have rounded up to a total of **40 songs** instead!

Included in our 40 songs we have the **Meme Rate Bracket Winner** which is **Farrah Abraham's On My Own** with a score of 78-25 over Bad Blood! Congrats on winning something ~~because this probably won't actually win this rate~~

# [A Youtube Playlist of All Songs is Available Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5VSWxuuXTpEypEFtMvbpy8Yc90hGlYP)

**I would recommend the Youtube Videos as full appreciation of these songs can only come from watching the video alongside it as this is the meme rate after all.**

# [A Spotify Playlist of Some of the Songs is Available Here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1blUWRP51KYLxU5cEmGHb1?si=hbYTScJ_TwuaEzb_cay-Xw)

* Missing songs are: 
   * Chinese Food, Hot Problems, Where's My Juul??, My Jeans, My Heart Will Go On (Recorder Cover), Mii Channel Theme, and We Are Number One. Youtube links are provided above for those. 

**The Rules**

Y’all probably know how this goes, but maybe you’re new here and need a run down of the rules:

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine so long as it is to only 1 decimal place. Ex) 5.2 is okay, but a 3.69 is not.
* You have to rate **every** song in the rate
* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential, feel free to share them, campaign for your favorite song to win (or for the worse song to lose).
* You may give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favorite tracks. You **must** leave a comment for these explaining your ranking so we know you’re not rigging (although since this is a rate with a bunch of weird and bad songs, rigging will not be as much of a problem). Keep in mind you do not HAVE to give an 11 or a 0.
* You can change your scores at any time by PMing me! u/ignitethephoenix
* Make sure you use the prepared link that can be found at the top and bottom of this post

**Here is how to format you comments:**

Alison Gold - Chinese Food: 10 Chinese Food is the best food of all time!

**Here is how NOT to format your comments:**

iLOVEFRiDAY - MiA KHALiFA:  Hit or miss, but this song is a miss so I'm giving it a 0

Toto - Africa - 10 Maroon 5 is shaking

Rebecca Black - Friday: 10: Queen shit! Ugh the talent she exudes.

Pinkfong - Baby Shark 0 Please go shame u/TragicKingdom1 for the flair he has. Disgusting.
