https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ff39n4/popheads_meme_song_rate_reveal_day_1_let_me/

[Wazzupppppppp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL_qGMfbtAk) popheads (if you remember this then you may qualify for a veterans discount or were just on the internet a lot).

Welcome to Day 1 out of 2 of the Meme Song Rate. Today we will be revealing songs #40-#21 from our lovely compilation of memes/viral sensations/novelty songs that were chosen by you.

We will be revealing at **7pm EST** today but unlike other rates, we will NOT be revealing on plug dj. Due to some Youtube API issues I have decided to do the reveal on a site called Kosmi instead. The link to the room where the reveal will be happening is [located right here.](https://app.kosmi.io/room/6otetw) You do not need to sign up to join however if you would want to not be anonymous I would recommend signing up as it is easy and quick.

Here are some fun facts about the rate:

**Number of participants: 79 (Thanks for the great turn out guys!)**

**Average score: 6.862**

I can’t stand Jake Paul but this song actually slaps somewhat? Also England is my City is a top lyric from this decade. This was at the bottom since Day 1 pretty much and is probably the least surprising result of this rate. 

---
# Jake Paul’s Number One Fan

**rickikardashian** (11): I decided that the best way to do this rate was to give the song scores based on how good of an actual song it is, and how memeable it is, and this is honestly the hardest one to rate, because although as a song is absolutely awful in every aspect, there's been little to no video that has provided as many different memes as this one. Every line is golden, complete comedy perfection. I couldn't decide whether to give this a 1 or a 10, but looking back at how the entire internet got together, to make fun of this beautiful mess, I realize that's the closest we'll ever get to world peace, and for that, I can't give this a low score

# It’s everyday I listen to this song bro

**alwayswords** (10): jake paul’s pop 2 moment

**CreepyMannequin** (10): amazing. Nothing about this song actually works. The flows are bad. The beat is bad. Jake Paul is bad. It’s the right amount of annoying for a stupid meme song.

**ManofOranges** (10): This gets a 10 because of Tessa Brooks. She snapped so damn hard. "Lemme educate you and I ain't talking book" is literally one of the most iconic lyrics in history. And yes it is my man's cologne, Tessa, I know you took him and I am perfectly ok with that because of your verse.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song makes me laugh and brings me joy

**materialqirl** (8): yeah i smell good

**letsallpoo** (7): okay this kinda goes off yall...

**DaHumanTorch** (6): ENGLAND IS MY CITY

**ExtraEater** (6): I don't hate this

# I rather watch Logan Paul in the Suicide Forest

**notdallin** (4.4): he just pulled his pants down to show off his tat lmaoooo

**lil\_foofy** (4): For some reason, this song makes my violent tendencies manifest.

**SunshineMarmot101** (4): slightly worse than fine

**camerinian** (2): thanks to Brexit, I think England actually is a city now

**fadedblue09** (2): Why is rap the go-to genre for meme songs?

**mysario** (2): no

**NBA-Mark** (2): Not even Tessa Brooks could save this disaster

**timothy444** (2): This song is better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHmBf4ExtZk

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1.5): Ayo, it’s Cody hahaha, 280K flippin’ subs on YouTube, bitch. EAT A LOT OF FOOD KEEP YA DICK FAT, EAT A LOT OF FOOD KEEP YA DICK FAT, AIN’T NO SKINNY PENIS WE AIN’T WITH THAT, NOW KEEP YA DICK FAT NOW KEEP YA DICK FAT. Amazing how a song made in 4 hours was better than this one that was made in a day. .5 for some of the ridiculous fucking lyrics here but goddamn this is a shame. Also please imagine watching the Teen Choice Awards and seeing this performed live… that happened. Also, Tessa’s verse is alright, I guess. Idk it feels like she at least put the most effort into this.

**1998tweety** (1): Trash, the 1 point I gave this is from Tessa's verse

**bandnitos** (1): i may be gen z but i am not from the jake paul generation

**coin-cache** (1): no thanks, even as a meme

**cultofbabies** (1): if this wasn't jake paul it would be like a 2.5. he's just that odious

**hikkaru** (1): not my 0 sorry teeheehee

**ImAMemeDuh** (1): not even ironically

**Roxieloxie** (1): i miss the point of my life when i didnt know jake paul was a thing, so like, 5 seconds before my mom called me into the room to watch a video of someone reacting to this song

**rslashpoopheads** (1): I'm old

**saucymac** (1): Logan paul cured my anxiety then Jake Paul brought it back

**static\_int\_husp** (1): "England is my city" will go down as one of the most iconic bad bars of all time

**TiltControls** (1): aw jesus gross

**Tolk1en** (1): a serious 0 contender

**vayyiqra** (1): Bro, no. This isn't even good as comedic. It's pure cringe. I can't even with this song.

**waluigiest** (1): I heard this and added a few points to my Mia Khalifa score

**agentofscranton** (0): lmao fuck this guy

**alasyorick** (0): i couldn’t justify listening to more than 30 seconds of this song because then Jake Paul would get royalties

**bbfan132** (0): bye, this guy is totally insufferable

**bespectacIed** (0): never heard of this song, never played it, never will

**Corn\_and\_rice** (0): Jake Paul is a man child exploiting children for money and I don't support it

**cremeebrulee** (0): there's literally nothing else deserving of a 0 when this is here

**evilqueenlex** (0): not iconic, doesn't have the range. not even catchy or funny in the slightest. so flavorless, can't even be liked ironically. trash in its lowest and dirtiest form but even that's too high of a compliment

**geekysheep\_** (0): im not giving this video a view

**HoodooMooJuice** (0): This song represents everything wrong with affluence. A rich kid with enough money to pay a film crew and music producers to make a shitty music video for him and his friends so he could tout it around for clout and exposure.

**loloeffeff** (0): no hesitation that this would get my 0, it is just straight trash

**Maybe9** (0): i think this song gave my ears syphilis

**midnightjasper** (0): fuck him

**moooo566** (0): what the fuck

**Qwilpish** (0): This aged from literal rotting shit to shit that has burned its way through the earth. Nothing is reedemable its not even iconically bad just so boring. I refuse to listen to this in its entirety

**skargardin** (0): a plague

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): im not even going to pretend i can enjoy this even ironically. fuck the paul brothers and everything they stand for

**wavingwolves** (0): no fucking way

**worlds-okayest666** (0): this is so bad oh my god. Literally the only good part is Tessa Brooks’ verse and even then it’s still boring as fuck...who thought this was a good idea

I know this is actually a joke song, but boy this was one meme song that I never liked a ton when it went viral. Also when Glee covered this song…that was a very, very low point even though Glee was already trash by then. This song also hovered around the bottom most of the rate and honestly it is what they deserve for making something very painful to listen to.

# Swiper Stans

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): Educational icons

**ManofOranges** (10): Okay this was like the one meme song I could just NEVER get behind. And now here I am listening to it and... and I do enjoy it. Lorde have mercy on me.

**skargardin** (10): iconic, I C O N I C

**timothy444** (10): Funnier than Lil Dicky's Freaky Friday

**wavingwolves** (10): https://youtu.be/isaK9ppSN_s

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): right before this song blew up, my 7th social studies teacher put an extra credit question on our test that said "what dose the fox say" and we spent 15 minutes trying to figure it out before he showed us the video and we were all so confused. of course the song later blew up and im not gonna lie i bought this song on itunes

**mysario** (8.6): Massachusetts is their best song

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): say what you want, the vocal delivery is impressive at the end of the day

**notdallin** (8.3): this video has more of a budget than charli’s label ever poured into her

**CreepyMannequin** (8): unfortunately, I find this funny

**DaHumanTorch** (8): pure poetry

**poppinmmolly** (8): I got an email from youtube at the end of 2013 saying that I was among the first 5% of people to watch this viral sensation and that is the first and only time I've ever been "first" to a meme

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): Hotty, Hotty, Hotty, Hoe - all nicknames for me when this stripper serenade comes on. Gimme Moreth??

**1998tweety** (7): Annoying, thank Lorde the production is so good it saves it

**lil\_foofy** (7): You know what I think I really want some crabs. Oh right, it's an okay song.

**worlds-okayest666** (7): this did...not age as well as i remember

**Qwilpish** (6.5): a product of the post gangnam style world where people were trying to make really really weird music videos. not as naturally funny. this song isnt bad at all minus the meme parts

# I rather sell fox fur than listen to this again

**loloeffeff** (6): pretty annoying and not too funny

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): this is so ridiculous looool

**materialqirl** (5): this has NOT aged well i-

**saucymac** (5): fox says NONE of these things

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): furry anthem

**rickikardashian** (4): why did I love this so much? what drove my 12 year old self, and everyone around me, to go batshit crazy at DINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGGIDINGIRIN"

**waluigiest** (4): this sucks

**cultofbabies** (3.5): calling a fox an "angel in disguise" is the realest lyric from any song on this list

**hikkaru** (3): i have not heard this since i was an edgy young teenager and thankfully i don't take things so seriously anymore but LORD if this ain't trying me!

**SunshineMarmot101** (3): No.

**Ambelliina** (2): sorry this sucks and i hate it it feels like such an obvious attempt to capitalize on the meme culture of the time and they succeeded and it was never funny ever. if you think im boring and hate fun for this then so be it. i stand by my take

**anothertown** (2): Cringe

**agentofscranton** (1): michellevisageno.gif

**alwayswords** (1): the psy print

**bbfan132** (1): i still hate this song with every fibre of my being

**bespectacIed** (1): awful

**camerinian** (1): this is funny for exactly one listen as you establish the concept and then painfully fucking annoying every time after that. In other words, it's a terrible meme, since getting exposed to it repeatedly is meant to be the point.

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): same reason as chinese food

**evilqueenlex** (1): i hate this song with a burning passion. at least gangnam style had a shitty dance craze. Would have been a zero if it wasn't for Jake Paul being on this list.

**fadedblue09** (1): NOPE.

**HoodooMooJuice** (1): If I was given the option of going back in time to make sure this song never existed in exchange for LG6 never seeing the light of day I wouldn't do it, but I would seriously consider it and that's saying something.

**Maybe9** (1): earblood

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1): Why young me thought this song was fun idk why. Also, these guys really performed with Crayon Pop huh. Man, why did we let this meme be a thing? Also communicating to a horse with Morse code is extremely stupid. Just end this. End this song already PLEASE. I’ve had enough. I get it, you motherfuckers don’t know how to use Google. Just fucking use GOOGLE. PLEASE. Save us all.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Bye!

**vayyiqra** (1): No. Go away. I used to think this song was kind of funny, maybe about seven years ago. The parody "What Does The Spleen Do" was better, because almost nobody does indeed understand what that fucking thing does. But now? It makes me wish for swift death. I just want the fox to shut up.

**bandnitos** (0): FUCK THIS SONG

**coin-cache** (0): Easy pick for worst. I know it's a joke, but the chorus still is hard to listen to.

**NBA-Mark** (0): Fuck off

**TiltControls** (0): I hate it both as a regular song and a meme song

The power this song has. You can definitely hear the pain and emotion in her voice. 

Winner of the Worst of bracket, this song isn’t actually a meme song it’s just a terrible song that popheads voted to be in this rate (and some people like ironically/unironically I can't tell...). Imagine if Bad Blood was in here instead...how would it fair? We will never know.

---

# My Teenage Dream Hasn’t Ended

**loloeffeff** (11): a musical legend, her album is really life changing and i would recommend everyone listens to it asap

**bandnitos** (10): FARRAHNATORS GRAB BACK

**ManofOranges** (10): There's a reason this girl won the meme song bracket. She has it. She has the vocals. She has the delivery. She has the utter angst the ONLY she could pull off. No one else could improve this, any changes from this will result in an inferior version. Farrah girl, you did it. Thank you Farrah Abraham.

**wavingwolves** (10): we love pc music!! also why this album cover creeps me out so much....

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Weirdly enough, I actually see the Pop 2 comparisons.

**bespectacIed** (9): queen

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is kinda surreal oh wow

**camerinian** (8.5): It’s incredible that a person who seems so uniquely a product of the culture of her time, being a reality TV star, ended up making something so wholly unique and undistilled in its vision at total odds with what would be expected of her. I genuinely don’t believe someone could have made this with the intent of it being a mainstream pop release. The uncanny valley is simply never broached, and instead this ugly, misshapen beast comes out wanting to be seen as normal. It’s awe-inspiring, and ooh i came

**materialqirl** (8.5): invented autotune

**Ambelliina** (8): ive heard a LOT about my teenage dream ended but never actually listened to anything from it. its like she just accidentally made scene-pop. i dont even know. fuck it its an 8

**anothertown** (8): as much as I love 100 Gecs & other similar pc music acts, when confronted by Farrah’s album it’s obvious that it’s what they are all trying to sound like lol

**bbfan132** (8): this is like a strange fever dream but i’m here for it.

**waluigiest** (8): revolutionary

**cultofbabies** (7.5): i've only heard two songs from this album but it seems like it was legit kind of ahead of its time

**ReallyCreative** (7): The way this could fit in the PC girls' discographies unironically, I almost gave this a 2 but it's kinda visionary? Ending on "this is the best I can do" is kind of a power bitch move not going to lie

**TiltControls** (7): 0 as an actual song, but pretty good for a meme song

**vayyiqra** (7): This is my first time hearing Farrah Abraham, and it's not that bad ... ? I would even say I like the instrumental melody quite a bit. This could be the breakdown in a Charli XCX song and you would all love it. I feel uncomfortable finding her music funny given that it was made about a time in her life when she was severely mentally ill and that's a little too real for me, so I just find it kind of intriguing and want to hear the whole album now.

**coin-cache** (6): Definitely prefer After Prom, I feel like the production and autotune vocals don't clash as 'well' on this.

**lil\_foofy** (6): You do you, girl. You do you!

**skargardin** (6): mood though

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): i love charli xcx

# I love Teen Mom

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): I don't know what to think about this

**yourfacesucksass** (5): I think the (synth?) sounds okay, but the vocals are so rough omfg but I'm the literal clown for thinking this would be as good as Paris' Paris.

**evilqueenlex** (4): farrah is so genius that she's even on her own beat to communicate she is ooN mY OOWn

**geekysheep\_** (4): wtf is this

**hikkaru** (4): the phone call that changed my life outsold

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4): Okay so I’ve never listened to a Farrah Abraham song because I somehow have an ounce of self-respect for myself. But this is EXACTLY what I expected. It’s disjointed, it’s autotuned, it’s a mess. Farrah, please put down the phone and face it, we’re all alone. But seriously holy shit. This both an assault on my ears and everything I completed expected. Is the rest of the album like this? Also, I went to check the comments and they were turned off… that says a lot. “This is the best I can do.” Yeah no shit.

**Roxieloxie** (4): is this one of them lil pop synth girls yall be going hard for

**static\_int\_husp** (4): like if 100 gecs took a bunch of downers and hated life

**notdallin** (3.9): all I know about this chick is that this album was on Fantano’s best albums of the decade list and I have somehow lost even more respect for him

**Corn\_and\_rice** (3): meh

**NBA-Mark** (3): Stream "After Prom" instead https://youtu.be/kVmJg2gPobs

**rickikardashian** (3): this is so far away from actual music, but also so far away from being a meme, so how the fuck do I rate this? I'm just going to pick a random number and rate it that

**DaHumanTorch** (2.5): im screaming at how awful this was yet i still added it to my library, send help

**HoodooMooJuice** (2): I'm utterly flabbergasted... My head is spinning... Utterly repugnant... But the synths are ok

**timothy444** (2): Gave this a 3.5 in the first Charity rate and I realised I should've rated it slightly lower. Also Bad Blood should've been in this rate so…

**worlds-okayest666** (2): farrah abraham most overhyped artist of the last decade

**agentofscranton** (1): fuck farrah abraham tbh

**Maybe9** (1): 😕

**Qwilpish** (1): I have to give her a point for the nerve of releasing this

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Oh No

**SFbby** (1): ??? What is this??? Music??? Song??? Trash??? Art??? The predecessor to Charli XCX???

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): To the people who unironically think My Teenage Dream Ended is some type of accidental masterpiece : what the fuck is wrong with you

**ImAMemeDuh** (0): Yes, this is a 0. Deal with it you PC Music whores

**PaulMcCartneyClone** (0): no

**poppinmmolly** (0): this is so, so bad. Not even in a "so bad it's good" way. It's just bad.

So many quotables here..although I think the girl’s part is funnier and more of a meme than the guy’s part. If they didn’t take this so seriously I think it could be rated higher for me.

Remember the hit or miss video that basically made Tik Tok what is is today? Well this is the origin of that meme. A Mia Khalifa diss track. Looks like everyone here agreed that although iconic for that one line (and IMO a few other lines are just hilarious), it’s not that good of a song and also is quite problematic in its own right. 

---

# I guess they never miss huh

**alwayswords** (11): the story behind this song sends me

**anothertown** (10): Nothing needs to be said

**ExtraEater** (10): It's a hit

**ManofOranges** (10): This gets a 10 solely because of the girl's part. She did NOT miss when she decided to write that line. Legend.

**Maybe9** (10): ceo of rap features

**Qwilpish** (10): PERFECT

**vayyiqra** (10): A problematic fave! This is one of the dumbest songs in the rate, and that's saying a lot. It wasn't even intended to be dumb, it just became dumb because iLOVEFRiDAY are dumb and wrote a song that was a diss of a retired pornstar they'd never met based on a fake tweet. I love this group and their so-bad-it's-good music, their irreverent sense of humour, and goofy low-budget videos. I also love the "Hit or Miss" viral video with the adorable cosplay Kat dancing to SmokeHijabi's verse. The lyrics are kind of gross with their slut-shaming of Mia Khalifa who is in fact a very savvy businesswoman and intelligent person, but this is still an iconic song. I unironically love it. It's hilarious.

**mysario** (9.5): garbage

**materialqirl** (9.3): i was an iLOVEFRiDAY stan

**bandnitos** (8): please rise for our national anthem

**cremeebrulee** (8): this song should've just been that girl's verse bc the hit or miss part is truly iconic everything else is annoying

**LesApfels** (8): sH0TS fIRED, uR fIRED, uR wASHED uP, uR rETIREDDDDDDD

**wavingwolves** (8): you play with them balls like it's fifa

**lil\_foofy** (7): It's cute.
# You got a boyfriend I bet he doesn’t kiss ya

**ImAMemeDuh** (6): the rest of the song is boring

**NBA-Mark** (6): Lil Pump really fell off after Gucci Gang. That girl ate though

**coin-cache** (5): I like the repeated "mia khalifa"s, but otherwise ehh

**evilqueenlex** (5): this song would get a better score if this guy wasn't like 90% of the song

**HoodooMooJuice** (5): I totally didn't know this one until the lady came in💀 Thank you Popheads for educating me! Not that great tho.

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): fine.

**waluigiest** (5): I don’t know if I get it

**notdallin** (4.1): I’m not on tiktok

**bbfan132** (4): i mean i kind of like his voice? meh

**DaHumanTorch** (4): ok but did they really make a diss track for a porn star and make one of the primary disses how much of a slut she is cause....

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4): Yeah, I’ve never heard this full song just the hit or miss I bet they never miss ya part. It’s exactly what I expect. Also, this a diss track to Mia Khalifa? Boooooooo. Let her live. (Disclaimer: idk shit about her.) “Your kitty looks like a flat tire” OKAY TOO FAR. Let’s not shame what vaginas look like. So the meme part here is the best part… No surprise.

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): the hit or miss verse is literally the only thing in this song with any humor whatsoever

**Ambelliina** (3): i thought i was going to like this more but the meme part is actually the only good part of the song

**fadedblue09** (3): Bleh.

**rickikardashian** (3): I was very confused as to why they were dissing Mia Khalifa, and it turns out they both got offended over a fake tweet. This is literally a beef against a meme. It also makes sense that the “Hit or miss…” was the part that went viral, because the rest of the song is pure shit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the hit or miss part is iconic ofc but the guy singing the song is so bad that he ruins everything else

**Corn\_and\_rice** (2): not for me

**Roxieloxie** (2): maybe im not as gen z as i think i am

**timothy444** (2): Definitely a miss here

**bespectacIed** (1): the incelness of this song

**CreepyMannequin** (1): admittedly the “hit or miss” part is catchy (hence why it’s the only relevant part of the song) but I hate the attitude and misogyny of the song (also, imagine your only hit being a diss track aimed at a retired porn star….embarassing)

**rslashpoopheads** (1): :peepovomit:

**skargardin** (1): no

**1998tweety** (0): The worst thing about this meme is you can't even say the phrase "hit or miss" without someone bringing up the song, it's like when Trump got elected.

**camerinian** (0): this is the only meme I wish I never knew the full context for, and that decontextualising actively makes the meme better. Who the fuck are these virgins and why are they attacking the single most famous pornstar in the world, who seems like she's done nothing wrong, other than I guess do porn? Like, if I did a diss track towards, I dunno, Novak Djokovic, it would rightfully go nowhere because who the fuck am I and what's he done to warrant it other than be famous for being good at what he does, but enabling angry post-nut teenagers who suddenly think pornography is immoral? I guess that'll get your track moving. Also they sing like they had to guess the key of the track and their flow is entirely dependent on how many syllables they can be bothered with writing, instead of anything consistent or exerting even a little effort. I hate this shit so much. Yuck

**cultofbabies** (0): this song literally makes me feel physically sick

**Tolk1en** (0): a disaster

Not going to ignore the impact this has but I just can’t stand it which is why it got my zero.

Baby Shark is one of the biggest songs on Youtube of all time (yes it has 4.6 Billion views and it’s only behind Despacito for views) and it is also one of the most well known songs here. This song is definitely more polarizing than I thought it would be but it looks like in the end, most people found this song super annoying and overplayed and they may have wanted to rip their brains out.

---
# pinkfong stans

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Legitimately catchy. I'm very fortunate to not own any children of my own so I can actually enjoy this dumb ditty without any malice.

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): we are voguing ladies

**ManofOranges** (10): An iconic tale about the lineage of a shark family. Not a story you'll hear too often either, if at all. Thank you Pinkfong, for telling this seldom told epic.

**mysario** (10): this song is featured on Just Dance 2020

**TragicKingdom1** (10): MAIN POP GIRLS!!!!!!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): pinkfong main pop girl

**hikkaru** (9): bop

**LesApfels** (9): This shit has it's own cereal. Let that sink in.

**Ambelliina** (8): fuck it this actually kinda owns. 8 but also this is completely relevant to this song but while listening to this it crossed my mind that WHERE THE FUCK IS HAMSTERDANCE IN THIS RATE

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): daddy shark goes off

**1998tweety** (7.5): So overrated, it's cute and bops a bit but doesn't deserve to place at the very top of the rate.

**lil\_foofy** (7): It was cute, until it got overplayed!

**Maybe9** (7): its the end doo doo doo doo

**moooo566** (7): baby shoes doo doo doo doo never worn doo doo doo doo - gingerbfg on twitter whos joke i stole just now

**skargardin** (7): It does bop, I will give it that

# I can stand this do do do do do do do do do

**waluigiest** (6): literally how did this happen

**wavingwolves** (6): let the kids be happy

**notdallin** (5.8): idk why but the dramatic jaws theme reinterpretation reminds me of Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix for some reason

**materialqirl** (5.5): hate this but less than ppap

**agentofscranton** (5): maybe sharks deserve to go extinct

**alwayswords** (5): um chile anyway

**anothertown** (5): fuck i just realized i didn’t log out of youtube to watch all of these videos

**cultofbabies** (5): it's just so catchy and harmless i can't bring myself to hate it

**rickikardashian** (5): it was funny and all that if got so popular, but Christ this is just annoying after a listening to it a third time. Either way, the beginning goes hard and I'm a bitch for a key change, I can't be mad at this

**bandnitos** (4): gets too much hate but it still deserves some hate

**camerinian** (4): my condolences to the parents and caregivers in the sub

**vayyiqra** (4): I'm intrigued why small children love this song so much. It's kind of cute, and odd, and I guess they like the bright and colourful video? It's not a good song, but I want to know how such an odd song got the toddlers to stan it so hard.

**coin-cache** (3): I never caught on to why this is a meme. Apparently it has 4.6B views though.

**SunshineMarmot101** (3): why

**timothy444** (3): A song for babies. The real men listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a02YHIYZ6oo

**ReallyCreative** (2): ugh

**bbfan132** (1): this song still gives me a headache

**bespectacIed** (1): fuck them kids

**fadedblue09** (1): Please no. We’ve suffered enough.

**Qwilpish** (1): I sang this for my kids when I was a camp counselor I hate it forever

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Why do asians always make the worst memes?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): fuck this song do-do-do-dodo-do

**CreepyMannequin** (0): I know it’s cliche to hate this song, but I spent a good six months around two elementary-aged children last year, I have no tolerance for this monstrosity

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i know this is a meme rate but fuck. this. song.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (0): END ME NOW. I’m allergic to this song lol. Okay somewhat JK on that part but it does remind me of a night that happened fairly recently that I’d like to forget because I ended up in a bathroom having a panic attack. TL;DR never get stuck in a family night party. But anywho, what happened was they were like “THIS ONE IS FOR ALL THE LITTLE KIDS” and then “EVERYONE ELSE PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR MAKE A SHARK”. And I was just GONE. Idk maybe it’s because I’m old and jaded (not that old but like…) I wanted it to end so badly and it felt like it dragged on and on and on. Thus, I fucking hate this song. Thankfully it wasn’t the singular event that caused the bathroom panic attack but it sure as fuck didn’t help it. I was in a situation I already didn’t wanna be in and it made it worse. So fuck baby shark.

**Roxieloxie** (0): fuck them kids

**static\_int\_husp** (0): in my head do do do do do do can't get out do do do do do do I hate this do do do do do do

Honestly this song is definitely a bigger bop than I remember but the video takes this song new new racist and creepy heights featuring a 50 year old man as a panda and white girls dressed up in Asian clothing…but I do love Chinese Food! Thanks Alison!

---

# We love Chinese Food (yeah!)

**DaHumanTorch** (10): No one: White people when they go to Panda Express:

**ExtraEater** (10): I don't see it on there anymore but for a time I'd always go to the Chinese Food video and read the "Are you ready for your singing lessons?" comment for a good laugh

**fadedblue09** (10): Unironically a BOP!

**hikkaru** (10): thinking about when some friends and i were driving to get, you guessed it, chinese food and i was connected to the aux so i played this and at a stoplight the car next to us could hear it and were laughing at us so we turned it up and laughed with them

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/719b206eaa843f4c6f98b88ff16445ce/87e80ebaf6c36729-7f/s500x750/37e39e57456e5142b5a353098a322e8a62595f72.jpg

**LesApfels** (10): Scarlett Johansson could never

**ManofOranges** (10): Crab rangoon, spare ribs, general tso's chicken, dumplings, lo mein, mooshoo pork, sweet n sour, fried rice legend

**bbfan132** (9): “and you like it/cause it’s beautiful/and it tastes so so so good” is the most poetic lyric i’ve ever heard in a song…. simply beautiful and heartwarming

**worlds-okayest666** (9): gwen stefani wishes

**lil\_foofy** (8): I'd give it a higher score but they used a kimono in a Chinese-themed song, which-- NO!

**NBA-Mark** (8): I don't even really like Chinese food but this song made several points

**TiltControls** (8): i mean chinese food is really good

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): Alison seems like the type of person who drops Cruel Summer thinkpieces on every popheads post.

**1998tweety** (7): Her song Gold is so wild, please watch it after this. This does kind of bop though despite being kind of problematic...

**alwayswords** (7): cultural appropriation made some points

**HoodooMooJuice** (7): it's alright, but the lyrics are repetitive and the guest feature is horrible.

**poppinmmolly** (7): Chinese food is really good she made some points

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): I honestly haven’t had good Chinese food in fucking forever. I also like fried rice and noodles. Never was big on chow main chow mo mo mo mo main. Also I enjoy how she shout out the chicken wings, even in the local Asian buffet they have that stuff. Also… the video for this is iconic for being creepy lol. It’s starts out really innocent and then Patrice Wilson shows up in that panda suit and it’s like what the fuck. Also I’ve never used chopsticks with Chinese food, I have a hard enough time with chopsticks for sushi.

**rickikardashian** (7): I can’t decide if my favorite part of the video are the obviously google translated subtitles that make no sense, or the sad-ass “yay” after the girl sings “i love chinese food”

**timothy444** (7): Were they being intentionally bad on purpose?

**agentofscranton** (6.5): the fact this charted higher than bon appetit

**evilqueenlex** (6): they couldn't come up with a better song subject for this little girl lmao?

**SunshineMarmot101** (6): If only the lyrics weren't bad this would be good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): as a white girl who also loves chinese food, i feel this song on a personal level

**vayyiqra** (6): I am eating Vietnamese food right now and Chinese food is good too, as well as Japanese and Korean. Really, all East Asian food (and Southeast!) is among my favourite cuisine. Oh, what's that? You want me to comment on this mess of a song and get into an in-depth discussion of its problematic racial overtones? No, I don't think I will. Instead I am going to ignore the lyrics as best as I can and focus on the instrumental, which kind of bops. Stream "Chinese" by Lily Allen!

**wavingwolves** (6): if fortune cookies are never wrong how do you explain the time one said there was a lot of money coming my way but nothing happened…

# I prefer McDonalds

**anothertown** (5): this is what i see when I go to Maryland to visit my girlfriend’s family

**materialqirl** (5): friday WILL be getting a 10, period period

**moooo566** (5): its just not good in any way

**skargardin** (5): I'm ashamed to say that it does bop a bit..

**waluigiest** (5): I get why it would be charming but it came after ARK music hits had their moment

**Ambelliina** (4): this one is so conflicting to me because its actually kind of a bop except the lyrics are so distracting but theyre also really funny and so its kinda ironically enjoyable in that way but its still ughhhhh i cant its just a 4 fuck it

**mayolizard** (4): docking two points for being culturally appropriating

**saucymac** (4): a sad attempt to ride of queen rebecca's fame

**Tolk1en** (4): ok the lyrcs hurt my ears but the song overall is not THAT bad

**bandnitos** (3): this isn't even funny like its just bad but the subtitles are fucking killing me

**coin-cache** (3): As far as meme songs go, idk if there is much to say about this one other than the lyrics.

**cultofbabies** (2.3): i can't help feeling there's something racist about this song

**bespectacIed** (2): So many incorrect racist stereotypes. Also, the weird adult in a panda mascot hanging out with little girls, uhm??? I'm not giving this a 1 or 0 because the chorus legit bops lol. I'm just glad that this little girl survived this moment in her childhood, went on to be a successful country artist, and became a pop megastar with the release of her 4th album 1989

**camerinian** (1): absolutely zero sympathy for any girls who willingly signed with Ark Music Factory post-Rebecca Black. She had plausible deniability and just wanted to follow her dreams of singing, but all these other cowards went in with the intention of riding her coattails for a quick buck. I gave this a minute of my time and felt dirty afterwards.

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): Irritating, last time i listened to it was years ago and listening to it now was a nightmare

**Maybe9** (1): wow this song gave me depression

**Qwilpish** (1): Not even a good meme, but queen of geishas in a Chinese Food music video

**ReallyCreative** (1): This is truly one of the worst things I've ever listened to, what a dark and traumatic era but that's what this rate is all about!

**Roxieloxie** (1): i know the point of this rate is that these songs are good but five seconds into this and im already cringing this kept getting worse

**rslashpoopheads** (1): I love eating white people.

**SFbby** (1): Chinese food needs a proper banger to celebrate it, but this ain't it

**notdallin** (0): this song song makes Friday seem like top tier songwriting and its video a cinematic masterpiece.

**ManofOranges** (10): I just wanna say the acting in the video is godlike. Pikotaro could do Meryl Streep but Meryl Streep couldn't do Pikotaro.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Why do asians always make the best memes?

**SFbby** (10): I have a pen; I have an apple; UGH - Apple Pen

**1998tweety** (9.5): An actual bop

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): the beat goes pretty hard ngl

**loloeffeff** (9.5): just wish it was longer cause it slaps!

**anothertown** (9): maybe he snapped

**lil\_foofy** (9): ...I mean it's Japan, so it's standard fare for them I guess?

**Roxieloxie** (8.9): this slaps

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): This song was totally written in the someone's basemant while high, and that's what makes this song great.

**waluigiest** (8): is this Drive by Gwen Stefani?

**wavingwolves** (8): i like pens pineapples and apples so there's nothing to dislike here

# I prefer vegetables and pencils

**Qwilpish** (6.5): I hate the meme but its a jam

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): I’d like to remind everyone that this made it onto the Billboard charts. Also this so stupid I love it. Like…. Idk what an apple pen is, idk what a pineapple pen is, but I know that they make one ridiculous song concept. Also just watch this video! Man is living his best life with his pen pineapple apple pen.

**notdallin** (6.3): this is so sexual

**yourfacesucksass** (6.2): The cringe is extreme with this one. When I visited relatives in (unnamed Asian country), my mom's cousin's son would NOT stop singing this song and I really didn't think this video was going to go anywhere. I see the link with the most views has an upload date of two days before this kid showed it to me and would NOT stop playing or reciting it. So I guess, if he's just this annoying kid, he can spot a meme trend before it happens. That or, it was already a craze in Asia and America is just late per usual.

**SunshineMarmot101** (6): not bad really

**Ambelliina** (5): i somehow managed to avoid hearing this one when it was A Thing and its actually not bad but not really funny either the "long pen" part made me giggle though

**fadedblue09** (5): Meh. Beat is dope though.

**skargardin** (5): im at a loss for words

**Tolk1en** (5): I listened to this 4 times to give it a faire rate, and increased by one point each time

**cultofbabies** (4): i don't have anything to say about this one

**materialqirl** (4): lowkey hate this

**ReallyCreative** (4): I have no idea why any of these videos in this rate are any funnier than each other since it's all absurdist nonsense (and Shoes by Kelly, which is high art) but this just didn't really do it for me

**timothy444** (4): Below average meme

**bespectacIed** (3): i prefer the emo sequel

**coin-cache** (3): This didn't really need a long version.

**Maybe9** (3): this mans wig line is very upsetting

**vayyiqra** (3): This song, insofar as it is a song, is annoying. It was an okay meme for about a day and that was it.

**camerinian** (2): yeah mad throwback to when i worked in fast food and this was the only meme that my manager I hated knew, so it got driven into the fucking ground well before i even watched the damn video and realise the backing track sounded like shit and that what my fuckhead manager was just repeating verbatim was actually the whole video yeah thanks for uncovering this repressed trauma assholes

**bandnitos** (1): raw anger

**bbfan132** (1): i should loosen up and find this funny but i can’t, sorry

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): not for me

**CreepyMannequin** (1): I’m 23 but trying to understand what appeal this song could have made me feel geriatric

**hikkaru** (1): this one was always dummy annoying sorry

#PC Music King

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this is my favorite SOPHIE song

**NBA-Mark** (6): Dorian Electra in 30 years

#Daily reminder to stream Juice


**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): fun fact : this song outpeaked juice by lizzo on the billboard 100 by 5 spots. also fun fact : stream juice

When that one emo kid discovers Japanese culture...
Here we have another song that is solely a meme for the K-k-k-kawaii part (and I guess Avril doing whatever she was doing was semi viral) but yes this is in fact a genuine song that blew up because Avril embraced Japanese culture but in a cringey way. 

---

# Japanese queen

**fadedblue09** (11): Mixing J-pop with dubstep? Truly the queen of innovation. Also, I need to support my submission! (Ngl though, I was surprised this was picked).

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, yeah it's a little messy but I still love it. I do wish the EDM bits were a bit cleaner at points but besides that it's a nice bop.

**bbfan132** (10): that skirt was a choice. an excellent one.

**hikkaru** (10): an actual banger idc

**ManofOranges** (10): k k k kawaii bitch gwen stefani and her harajuku girls are shaking like that one earthquake

**moooo566** (10): i won a pub quiz once by being the only person who knew she was married to chad kroeger and i punished my teammates ignorance by playing them this song

**NBA-Mark** (10): We love a multi-lingual queen

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i unironically love this!! A banger

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): No amount of controversy could keep this song from being a certified bop! The dubstep postchorus is a bit much tho...

**Ambelliina** (9): as an obnoxious scene kid in 2020, i feel compelled to give this a high rating. but thats really not hard because this song is incredible. is there a better moment in all of music than "meeow BWAAHHWUBWUBUWBUB"? i think not!

**bandnitos** (9): why is this actually a bop like miss avril really missed the mark with the whole cultural thing with the video but as a song its a fucking banger

**mysario** (9): horrendous

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this would be a 10 cause it's an absolute bop but i have to subtract two points for cultural insensitivity to keep my conscience clear, sorry avril

**materialqirl** (8): k-k-kawaii

**Qwilpish** (8): Actually not as bad as I would have thought. That breakdown is soooo weird jpop im into it

**SFbby** (8): Not sold on the electro portions of the song, but I do like the chorus :/

**timothy444** (8): I ironically enjoy this

**ImAMemeDuh** (7): https://lovelace-media.imgix.net/getty/452445393.jpg

**saucymac** (7): this is when I knew the rumors about avril/melissa were true

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): like a fat kid on a pack of smarties.. Omg

# I prefer the Harajuku Girls

**yourfacesucksass** (6): I get that The Best Damn Thing was her transition into the emo-pink bitch, but that was (to me) such a natural progression for her and seemed very true. Hello Kitty, doesn't seem like that. It strikes me as Avril trying to grasp onto the trends of the time. Pop-rock wasn't at the forefront of "pop" anymore, the cute cupcakes, candy, and nameless asian backup dancers really painted this song as trying to Gwenify and Katyfy Avril. I feel like a better sexy double entendre could've been made with Hello Kitty, but that bass drop is so fucking bad.

**lil\_foofy** (5): Why did you have to body-shame an innocent kid, Ahbrel!?

**loloeffeff** (5): this is actually borderline awful but the music video saves it a bit for being so unintentionally funny

**rickikardashian** (5): i just know that someone behind the camera was pointing a gun at all the backup dancers. it’s impossible those women were willingly dancing like that

**Roxieloxie** (5): this brought back memories i didnt want to remember

**notdallin** (4.7): in another world, Gwen Stefani never got back together with No Doubt and monopolized the dubstep Harajuku girls corner of the market and saved Avril from this fate

**coin-cache** (4): The production on the verses is okay. The rest is uhhh..

**Corn\_and\_rice** (4): I kind of like it in a ironic way

**geekysheep\_** (4): avril said its weeaboo hours

**anothertown** (3): a full grown woman..

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): I’ve never liked this song and I can’t even give it a high score in this rate because Jesus Christ. I think my problem with this song is that this was expected to be taken super seriously. It sounds like Avril listened to J-Pop once and said “I can do that, but let’s add in like more Japanese stereotypes” Which btw, that’s an insult to J-Pop if that’s the case because some of that stuff slaps. BUT THIS… Jesus…. What the hell Avril. Was this even weeb anthem? I mean I’m barely a weeb (I just watch J-Horror stuff) so I have no clue. But like… I feel like even the weeb community can’t embrace this.

**SunshineMarmot101** (3): I loved Avril once but this decade was bad huh

**vayyiqra** (3): No. Go away. Aside from the kind of hilarious "ka-wai-i!" part in the intro, this is just painful, pure unadulterated cringe. I hear the Japanese loved it. Good for them, I guess, but I can't stand it. It's embarrassing.

**waluigiest** (3): man oh man she really had a Gwen Stefani moment exactly a decade later do we really learn NOTHING

**alwayswords** (2): "like a fat kid on a pack of smarties" i

**ReallyCreative** (2): The prechorus is actually super fascinating and almost proto-PC music but wow every other aspect of this song and video is deeply distrubing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): idk how to describe it other than it sounds like ass

**cultofbabies** (1.8): i never think this is gonna be as bad as it is and then that opening "KA-KA-KA-KAWAII" hits me like a brick to the nose

**bespectacIed** (1): Yeah y'all can pretend to like this because it's avril and it's silly and camp, but it will never change how utterly annoying this song is. Asian girls being used as quirky preadolescent props is a concept I would like to erase in the world

**camerinian** (1): hi every1 im new!!!!!!! holds up spork my name is avril but u can call me t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m!!!!!!!! lol…as u can see im very random!!!! thats why i came here, 2 meet random ppl like me _… im 29 years old (im immature 4 my age tho!!) i like 2 watch anime w/ my boyfreind (hes chad nickleback if u dont like it deal w/it) its our favorite tv show!!! bcuz its SOOOO random!!!! hes random 2 of course but i want 2 meet more random ppl =) like they say the more the merrier!!!! lol…neways i hope 2 make alot of freinds here so give me lots of commentses!!!! DOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <--- me bein random again _^ hehe…toodles!!!!! love and waffles, t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m

**evilqueenlex** (1): this is bad even for a meme song. she's too old for this, her clip ins are visible, and the budget harajuku girls deserve better than to be another white pop girl's cultural prop

**Maybe9** (1): goth hentai trash garbage poo poo bad this song gave me lice

**wavingwolves** (1): the way avril was like 29 when she released this... also, "like a fat kid on a pack of smarties someone chuck a cupcake at me" may be worst lyric of all time

I never have cared for Minecraft so I don’t have any emotional connection to this, and so did many other people it seems. It’s a decent parody though. However there were a good chunk of Minecraft fans here so the controversy score was quite high due to their being two types of people. 

---

# Minecraft is a classic

**bandnitos** (11): the fact that this isn't on spotify? a hate crime also this fucking slaps i remember this summer during tech week for legally blonde me and a few people in the show just fucking screamed this song even though we were supposed to be on vocal rest so it just has good memories attached

**geekysheep\_** (11): awww man

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a bop, the original is just that good huh

**alwayswords** (10): CREEPER

**anothertown** (10): this song is the entirety of everything i know about minecraft

**ExtraEater** (10): DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love is great and so is this

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): Honestly, imagine not stanning this aggressively in 2012, yikes I can’t relate. Also, stream TNT and Fallen Kingdom as well. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/425898094190788608/672272027922726943/tumblr_q3dnn4eawz1uk72j4o1_1280.png

**ManofOranges** (10): If you weren't absolutely obsessed with Minecraft in your tween/early teen years then literally what the fuck were you doing? I followed all those minecraft channels and you bet your ass I was watching people play cops and robbers and you can bet your ass that I was listening to every single Minecraft parody song. I was living life right

**materialqirl** (10): literally INVENTED minecraft covers

**Qwilpish** (10): we should have rated fallen kingdom which is an 11 but this will do

**skargardin** (10): im giving this a ten on the principle of dj got us fallin in love being perfect by default

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): so we back in the mine

**timothy444** (10): Better than the original

**DaHumanTorch** (9): all i want to mention is the fact that this has only 45M less views than the original...iconic

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): I...I don't know what to say.... Impressive vocals fot a mincraft LP-er?

**Maybe9** (9): its no minecraftcito but neverless its a fucking bop

**NBA-Mark** (9): I play this on my music block every night

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): LOOK IT’S AT THE DOOR BY THE STROKES!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Okay real talk can I talk about a personal experience that’s allowing me to rank this so high? So obviously this was a huge fucking meme last year… Like huge. And one of the variations was “attempt to get a whole discord to sing this” So I paired up with some friends and we made our own version and the thing that made these funny was that you always had to go and do other songs that weren’t revenge so we were throwing out stuff like Old Town Road, Country Roads, What Is Love? (the Haddaway song, not TWICE, sorry to disappoint), All Star, etc. Just more meme songs and of course some from our favorite artists (Yeah, I did like half of CRX’s discog at the time, because it was before PEEK was released, no shame) and then I turned it into an audio shitpost (there was gonna be a video to go along with it but someone got accidentally banned and their messages deleted) and it was fucking beautiful. It’s just a giant mishmash of songs with some google robot thing talking for the stuff we said that weren’t lyrics and it was honestly some of the most fun I had last year.

**Roxieloxie** (9): sO WE BACK IN THE MINE

**rickikardashian** (7.6): why is this so good quality, the animation is like highkey impressive and all

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): why do the vocals on this go off omg i'm a little shook

# Attacked by creepers

**lil\_foofy** (7): It's... it's okay I guess...

**waluigiest** (7): huh

**notdallin** (6.9): I have so many questions

**LesApfels** (6): she doesn't have the range

**wavingwolves** (6): giving it a six because i love the og song but i really don't get this. why are the minecraft graphics so ugly???

**yourfacesucksass** (6): Any kind of Minecraft pop parody is super cringe to me and immediately erased from my consciousness.

**SFbby** (5): Never played minecraft before

**TiltControls** (5): it's no fallen kingdom

**moooo566** (4): this is much worse than i remembered it being

**vayyiqra** (4): I don't care about Minecraft (I feel like I would've loved it if I got into it at the right time, I just didn't), and songs about gaming are almost always cringe. I like the instrumental because it's electro, but that's it. This can go.

**camerinian** (3): the concept of Minecraft parodies is infinitely more funny than actual Minecraft parodies

**SunshineMarmot101** (3): minecraft makes bad song worse

**fadedblue09** (2.6): I absolutely hate the song this was based on, and this barely changed my opinion. This is more bearable though, so I’m giving it twice the score its parent song received in the bonus rate.

**cultofbabies** (2.5): the rap bridge dropped this by half a point

**Ambelliina** (2): when the majority of the meme takes place place in the first 7 seconds its easy to forget that the remaining 4 minutes and 17 seconds of this is, in fact, a Minecraft-themed parody of "DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love" by Usher

**Corn\_and\_rice** (2): not for me

**evilqueenlex** (2): I've literally never heard this song and I pride myself on the amount of meme songs I watched on YouTube back in the early 10s. Anyways, a very weak parody song out of all the parody songs that were available in 2011

**bespectacIed** (1): stream Girls' Generation - Karma Butterfly instead

**coin-cache** (1): the minecraft server i used to play on in ~2012 had a music player that basically played this and skrillex on repeat for hours. i couldn't even get through 10s .

**ReallyCreative** (1): I probably found this cute/clever back in 2011 and I will never forgive myself, there's just no flavor to this abomination

**rslashpoopheads** (1): I now know where this meme comes from and I wish I didn't.

**saucymac** (0): creepers don't steal stuff. this is inaccurate.

# It wouldn’t be popheads without thirst over men

**hikkaru** (10): the vocals kinda serving me screaming in the shower but this is a classic and also captainsparklez is kinda a snack yes i am a white man's whore

**agentofscranton** (5): no matter how hot captainsparklez is now he'll always be the man responsible for this

**bbfan132** (1): i used to have a crush on this guy when i was like 11 or 12. i don’t know why.

This song is way less iconic without the video, but “watch out for my body rolls, high kicks, high kicks” gets me every time. 

---

# watch out for my body rolls

**HoodooMooJuice** (11): This song is THE meme song. The occasional off notes, the strange lyrics about body rolls with non-sensical references to elves and tigers, and "high kicks, high kicks!" make this song one of the most hilarious things I have ever heard in my life.

**NBA-Mark** (11): Queen of body positivity. The best "joke" song on this list. Only rivaled by queen Shithead

**PaulMcCartneyClone** (11): taught me how crush baked goods with my hips

**agentofscranton** (10): why does she look exactly like my year 6 art teacher

**bandnitos** (10): FUUUUUUUUUCK IM HAVING FLASHBACKS TO MIDDLE SCHOOL

**hikkaru** (10): i was walking through a forest of moccassin breAAAAAAAA

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): Lizzo snapped

**ManofOranges** (10): Realistic body standards condensed into a song that we need but don't deserve. Thank you, Leslie, from the bottom of my heart.

**materialqirl** (10): surprisingly a BOP

**ReallyCreative** (10): Leslie Hall is the queen of meme music and the Titus Jones remixes are actual unironic boppage

**rickikardashian** (10): I experienced what being on acid must feel like watching this video

**SFbby** (10): Wow this goes harder than most modern day pop songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Predated 2020 humor by a full decade

**worlds-okayest666** (10): leslie hall ahead of her time

**yourfacesucksass** (10): This has everything a meme song, and I'll say it's fucking iconic much like this LOOK that is being served. This melody vs. Stupid Love and Stupid Love is now deceased.

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): gotta activate my tight pants

**moooo566** (8): classic youtube

**Roxieloxie** (8): yo gabba gabba outsold

**skargardin** (8): boppy

**coin-cache** (7): never heard this before but it's perfect

**CreepyMannequin** (7): bro wtf

**lil\_foofy** (7): God we still have more songs to go!?

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): All of my jeans are becoming tight pants naturally because I have shit genes that lead to thick thighs. I one day wish to be as unashamed as this woman in her spandex pants. This has done more for self-love than too many of these new pop girls have.

**waluigiest** (7): low-key bop but it gets old quickly

# My tight pants prevent cut off blood circulation to my brain

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): wow i can't believe adele starred in this video

**cultofbabies** (5): i didn't know this existed until literally just now

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): hmmm no thanks

**LesApfels** (4.5): I am confusion

**vayyiqra** (4): I thought I had seen some weird memes in my time, and then this happened. Is this what happens when MILF fetishists, latex fetishists, and furries get together and make a song on LSD? The instrumental is kind of funny, but the video kind of disturbs me.

**notdallin** (3.9): people in the comments saying this is adele i-

**Qwilpish** (3): A song that was purposefully bad and weird. I am not here for it

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I think I just turned into a gremlin.

**timothy444** (2): As a millenial, I'm ashamed that this song even exists. Yuck!

**Ambelliina** (1): this isnt even good in any sort of ironic or post-ironic or post-post-ironic way

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): no just no

**fadedblue09** (1): I’m really surprised to find out these kinds of songs exist.

**Maybe9** (1): trying to be cringe is the highest form of cringe possible

The best trumpets in music. I think for thing song people appreciate the initial meme, but the full 2 minutes of John Cena’s theme was just too much for most popheads. 

---

# Horny people

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): I want John Cena to fuck me

**ReallyCreative** (8): the instrumental is better than the whole thing but whatever I just want John Cena to tear my insides apart

# Straight people

**lil\_foofy** (10): Ten-te-nen-teeeeen!

**ManofOranges** (10): Invisible man snapped here. Bringing back the big band era of music with all these iconic horns.

**timothy444** (10): I don't watch the WWE and even I recognise how iconic John Cena is!

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): i thought we were supposed to be rating a john cena song in this rate but i cant see it

**materialqirl** (9.5): DO DO DO DOOO DO DO DO DOOO

**camerinian** (9): This is the closest I’ll ever get to understanding Kyle culture

**notdallin** (8.7): this legit sounds like it could be a deep-cut by 50 Cent ca. 2003

**NBA-Mark** (8): One of John Cena's signature moves is called the "Five-Knuckle Shuffle".

**rickikardashian** (8): this sounds like an Eminem track but improved

**waluigiest** (8): HUSTLE LOYALTY RESPECT

**1998tweety** (7): Get's a little old but the raps bop a bit

**HoodooMooJuice** (7): Am I the only one? This song is so boring. Even the rapper sounds bored

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): Hey guys remember that time John Cena was in the Fred movie? Do you remember that? I do. Anywho, you can’t see me. Also, I’d use this to hype up lol. Question, is it a universal experience to know at least 1 kid in elementary school that had a John Cena shirt? Because I feel like we all knew one. I knew like 5, that’s just my area man. But seriously.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): i love eminem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): oh god that’s actually john cena singing this. this whole time i thought it was just some random guy they pulled off the street but its actually john cena

# you can’t see m(y scor)e

**yourfacesucksass** (6.6): I can appreciate this song as prominent as a meme but it's not a fave by any means. I swear there's a lyrics that sounded like, "don't know the recipe for dildo," which is an area of my expertise if I may say so.

**vayyiqra** (6): [Unexpected John Cena]

**alwayswords** (5): john cena are you army

**coin-cache** (5): moloko couldn't compare.

**cultofbabies** (5): john cena can do anything

**fadedblue09** (5): Not particularly bad but is that the best sound quality of the song.

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): fine-ish

**agentofscranton** (4.5): is john cena hot i can't tell

**Ambelliina** (4): this meme already got really old and any charm it still had is gone after the first 30 seconds when you realized theres actually more to the song. admittedly the beat kinda slaps imo

**Corn\_and\_rice** (4): overplayed

**hikkaru** (4): this is fun for the three seconds the sound clip lasts

**Maybe9** (4): the longer this song played the worse it got

**anothertown** (3): is he maga

**evilqueenlex** (3): meh

**Qwilpish** (3): you cant see me

**TiltControls** (3): 🎺

**rslashpoopheads** (2): love this vintage Jay-Z beat!

**skargardin** (2): bye

**bandnitos** (1): no

**bbfan132** (1): i hate straight men

**DaHumanTorch** (1): this almost turned me straight

**moooo566** (1): hey it turns out things that are painful to listen to cross from funny to terrible after the full length of a vine video

This was my shit when i was younger. It’s very catchy and Antoine Dodson is an icon but the autotune schtick is dated for sure. Another divisive track that was split into two parties: those nostalgic people who enjoyed the Schmoyoho days, and those people who think this has aged badly in more ways than one (making a meme of attempted rape, exploitation of poor people, autotune etc.) 

---

# t-pain is shaking

**1998tweety** (10): Bop, black people always know how to serve it.

**agentofscranton** (10): these pop girlies wish they could have the cultural impact the gregory brothers had

**evilqueenlex** (10): the audacity of schmoyoho to turn a story about the attempted rape of a young black woman into a very popular meme song but at least it helped them out of the projects

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): literally when will all men be as brave as him

**lil\_foofy** (10): Schmoyoho was my jam back in the day!

**ManofOranges** (10): This was back when Schmoyoho were those girls we knew they were. When the idea of an autotune remix of something was outlandish and yet completely possible. They really perfected it and their efforts actually kinda made the idea of these autotune remixes mainstream popular. True influencers. Run and tell THAT.

**ReallyCreative** (10): we looking for YOU

**SFbby** (10): HIDE YOUR KIDS HIDE YOUR WIFE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): schmoyoho didn’t need to go so hard when they made this song but they did

**wavingwolves** (10): HIDE YOUR KEYS HIDE YOUR WIFE!!! fuck this is a megabop

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): antoine dodson main pop girl

**bandnitos** (9): the autotune was ahead of its time

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): The Autotune is on point! So well produced too!

**materialqirl** (9): but where is i aint got no time for dat like..

**timothy444** (9): He did autotune better than T-Pain or Akon

**mysario** (8.9): as playable on Rock Band 3

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): so run and tell that homeboy

**alwayswords** (8): im so ashame..

**bespectacIed** (8): king and queen kelly dodson

**DaHumanTorch** (8): crime rates dropped to the lowest they've ever been when this was released

**rickikardashian** (8): I didn't remember this version, somehow I just knew the words to the Annoying Orange parody

**yourfacesucksass** (7.4): omg the "we gonna fiiiiiiiind you." bridgit mendler girl did you sample this???

**notdallin** (7): ‘sa little racist but if nothing else, I’m glad it gave us the Kimmy Schmidt theme song

# homeboy is going to like (not) get it

**vayyiqra** (6): Out of all the songs in this rate, this one might've aged the worst. It's kind of catchy, but now we live in woker times and realize that we were laughing at a poor black man who was worried that his sister was almost raped, it feels guilty to find it funny now. It still had a lot of cultural impact and started the "autotuned remix" trend in meme music, which it deserves credit for, but I don't really want to hear it again.

**Qwilpish** (5): you are so dumb you are really dumb

**skargardin** (5): i have no strong feelings one way or the other oop

**SunshineMarmot101** (5): hmm

**coin-cache** (4): ehh I feel like this concept isn't novel anymore and the song is otherwise not too interesting.

**camerinian** (3): anyone remember the Annoying Orange cover of this? Cos I sure fucking do

**loloeffeff** (3): looking back this was actually made in such bad taste...

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2): Out of all the old memes we really went with this one huh? I mean yeah it was an iconic moment, people parody the shit out of this but like… man…. Did NOT old up. Also, the extra piano version at the end of the remix in the video was unnecessary.

**Ambelliina** (1): i can only get so much out of a song where the joke is "heehee funny black man talk funny about attempted rape" made by two white dudes

**anothertown** (1): so we are still doing rape jokes?

**bbfan132** (1): making a meme out of rape? vile

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): this isn't even a real song, just a remix next

**cultofbabies** (1): there's certainly something to be said about a pair of white dudes making a successful meme song off of autotuning a black guy they thought was talking funny on the news

**fadedblue09** (1): Ok I’m not comfortable with the use of the word ‘rape’ like that. Also, are we supposed to rate that piano guy part as well?

**Maybe9** (1): this is a good meme originally, but wow this song is so trash

**rslashpoopheads** (1): I think the song made this worse.

**waluigiest** (0): 2010 was really a dark time. And I fed into it. What the fuck.

Can’t believe Miley, Ashley and Keke had the audacity to wear those jeans like Jenna. hahaha jack my swag is also the best line of the century, and that’s facts. This song is ridiculous but also iconic and looks like people either judged it ironically or seriously as a song.  

---

# abd 123 that girl wore her jeans like me


**bbfan132** (11): fun fact: this was filmed at a tanger outlet center that is 30 mins away from me. this is a total bop that predates bubblegum bass. also, queen of being mean to kids in middle school. easy 11.

**LesApfels** (11): I feel like Caramelldansen deserved my 11 more but I actually bought this on itunes soo

**letsallpoo** (11): the modern day mozart

**agentofscranton** (10): why did this make me emotional? what the fuck is going on with me

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ICON SHIT...also shoutout to the "heelys running down my spine" lyric cause thats just pure poetry

**ExtraEater** (10): Keke Palmer

**fadedblue09** (10): It sounds like it can pass for a commercial jingle for some kids’ merch.

**hikkaru** (10): CHARLI WHO??????? miss rose making that autotune WERK!

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): literally 1000x as fashionable as Kylie Jenner

**ManofOranges** (10): Levis who? Lee who? Wranger who? Jenna is flaunting in ways that I only wish I could. If KEKE PALMER were wearing my jeans then I would know I 100% made it in life.

**poppinmmolly** (10): OH EM GEE. SHE WORE THOSE JEANS LIKE MEEE.

**rickikardashian** (10): Look, all I'm saying is that if this was released today by Charli XCX or Slayyyter, this sub would eat it up and it would score like a 7.7 on the single jukebox

**Roxieloxie** (10): the keke palmer name drop.... big time rush on the cover.. the heelys ... SDFJGKAFSGKJ THE RAP VERSE .... this broke me and im giving it a ten

**waluigiest** (10): high key this was my everything when it came out. It was everything Friday wanted to be and more. It’s got so many amazing quotes….. Keke Palmer is wearing my jeans….. it feels like Heelies are racing on my spine…. I was so deep in on the parodies and dubs on YouTube…. Oh to be a middle schooler on the internet again.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): “keke palmer is wearing my jeans” who gives a FUCK about keke palmer

**alwayswords** (9): the friday print

**yourfacesucksass** (9): She is straight up the hetero white-girl we need to help us decide which jeans we should get.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Wait this kinda slaps....

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): +.5 for the Keke Palmer shoutout. "ABC 123, that girl wore her jeans like me, I bet she's mad, cause I look fab, hahahaha, jack my swag." ⬅️ Iconic!

**materialqirl** (8.5): invented pc music

**evilqueenlex** (8): i sympathize for this poor girl after hearing how she got horribly bullied because of this song

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): she kind of snapped ......

**TiltControls** (7.5): Like Friday, but slightly worse and slightly less iconic

**ReallyCreative** (7.3): the early tweenage youtube pop girls actually invented PC music I could not believe it

**anothertown** (7): i have thought about “haha haha jack my swag” at least once a week since 2010

**bandnitos** (7): honestly she was ahead of her time like this autotune??? innovation

**CreepyMannequin** (7): okay high-key Triggy is pretty lit

**lil\_foofy** (7): It's an okay meme song.

# hahahaha, jack my swag

**vayyiqra** (7): Ugh, not this song. I remember my friend sending me this video when it came out and talking about how it was weird and she found it kind of horrifying??? Was this song for real, or was it like a parody of shitty teen pop and vanity songs like "Friday"? I can't decide, and that scares me. It kind of bops though.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): The jolting between the rock scream into the autotuned pop... Oh man. I wish I had an item as cool as this girl’s jeans…. Yellow swordfish Hawaiian shirt and some green adidas flamestrikes when? Also I love how’s there a rap verse here. JACK MY SWAG. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA it’s so 2010 I’m screaming. Also blackberry being referenced… yep 2010. Also shout out to my fellow humans that have a hard time buying jeans.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): "it feels like heelies are racing on my spine" is oddly poetic

**geekysheep\_** (6): jenna rose > rebecca black

**NBA-Mark** (6): Baby Triggy had no business going off as hard as he did

**SunshineMarmot101** (6): this is better than I want to admit

**wavingwolves** (6): a lot of feelings about jeans

**Ambelliina** (5): the autotune brings this song up a full point. the middle child of the ark singles

**camerinian** (4): ok for real this is my first time hearing this and I thought it was kind of a bop but I scrolled down in the recommended feed and saw a video by her as a grown up called "being sexualized at the age of 12" and uh

**Maybe9** (4): i respect the artistry

**notdallin** (4): “Hannah Montana's wearing my jeans, Ashley Tisdale's wearing my jeans, Keke Palmer's wearing my jeans” one of these is not like the other

**Qwilpish** (4): Ironically enough I also wore those jeans

**timothy444** (3): The rap section is the only good bit of the song

**cultofbabies** (2.6): why does this 11-year-old know how to drive

**coin-cache** (2): Was Keke Palmer even that well known at the time? Feels like an outlier next to Ashley Tisdale and Hannah Montana.

**SFbby** (2): Friday outsold

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): irritating

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Friday outsold

**skargardin** (1): this is hell

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i would just like to say for the record that when i was looking up this song up on youtube i accidentally clicked the song my jeans by lil baby and gunna and i was very confused as to how this song fit into the meme rate until i realized half way through i was listening to the wrong song

Ended Shakira at the Super Bowl. This song went viral essentially for the chorus part where Vitas does his ‘turkey call” (according to wikipedia) but yes this is a legitimate European song that just blew up on the internet for one weird element.

**1998tweety** (10): Okay this actually bops despite being super weird.

**agentofscranton** (10): don't you fucking dare tell me white people have no culture

**evilqueenlex** (10): the 7th element looks fucking fun

**lil\_foofy** (10): The guy's don't-give-a-fuck face as he performs automatically takes this up to 10.

**loloeffeff** (10): the song totally slaps, the video is just the cherry on top

**ManofOranges** (10): This is where Shakira got the idea of her iconic tongue thing during the Superbowl. Vitas snapped.

**SunshineMarmot101** (10): hell yeah

**Ambelliina** (7): i swear to god i heard this SOMEWHERE before it actually became a meme and i dont remember where and i know this bc i never watched it when it was being memed until long after it was relevant and then i was like WAIT I KNOW THIS anyway its actually pretty groovy and cool

**coin-cache** (7): Early 2000s europop is one of my favorite styles and this song fits right in.

**HoodooMooJuice** (7): -1 Cause this guy creeps me out.

**ImAMemeDuh** (7): fuck europe

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): Look guys it’s that weird Russian song that feels like a Eurovision song but isn’t a Eurovision song. Also, can I say, shout out to the one chick in the video with whole ass pair of binoculars in the theater, I relate to your struggles. The entire lyrics to the first verse really are “I’ve come to give this song”, amazing. Thank you, Vitas, for bringing us this song.

**vayyiqra** (7): This meme is weird. Russia is just weird. I can't explain it. Maybe it doesn't need to be explained. It is from another planet as far as I'm concerned.

# eurovision outsold

**yourfacesucksass** (6.8): This person honestly scares me on a weird level. Like the song and dance melody are actually kind of nice, and I feel like I've heard this used elsewhere so yay it's impact, but just this outfit and style of performance across both performances (unless there's more) really unsettle me. Yet another reason why Russia scares me.

**notdallin** (6.6): the audience in the video is unbelievably unenthused

**fadedblue09** (6): Ok, but the backup singer in the beginning was so MUCH better.

**Maybe9** (6): katyas bjork says hiiiiiii

# green screen king

**cremeebrulee** (10): if u rate this below a 7 you're xenophobic sorry i don't make the rules

**cultofbabies** (10): this video legitimately has better green screen effects than some marvel movies

**evilqueenlex** (10): a banger, a dance craze in the making, pure genius. some of you may be too dumb to understand

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): I could only wish to be as impressive as this finger waving man

**ImAMemeDuh** (10): i love the power rangers

**ManofOranges** (10): Legend making one of the most hype songs of all time and doing it all himself. I don't see anyone else in the video do you? Literally self-sufficient icon

**moooo566** (10): OG meme songs are the best kind

**poppinmmolly** (10): when I was in college a frat played this as their closing song at the end of every party and everyone would do the dance it was so fun.

**Tolk1en** (10): best feel good song ever

**vayyiqra** (10): I have endless respect for Daler Mehndi for this song. I love the backstory behind it: tl;dr he was accused of only being popular because his music videos had hot women in them, so to flex on the haters and prove his songwriting skills, he made this amazing catchy bop with cheesy CGI imagery and his quirky little dance moves, then it became a huge hit anyway, which is so pure and wholesome. A self-love anthem! He looks like he's having so much fun making this video, and I have to stan it. I like this song so much I learned all the lyrics in phonetically transcribed Punjabi. True facts.

**loloeffeff** (9.5): meme legend and certified bop

**Qwilpish** (9.5): Tunak Tunak Tun but it speeds up whenever he says Tunak

**lil\_foofy** (9): Beyond it's time!

**1998tweety** (8): Kind of overrated tbh. It has its moment but I don't really care for the chorus. There are much better Indian pop songs out there.

**anothertown** (8): bop!

**coin-cache** (8): actual classic. I also love that late 90s rendering technology in the background.

**rickikardashian** (8): I’ll take this music video as the live action movie for Avatar: The Legend of Aang

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): I TOTALLY FORGOT THIS EXISTED OH MY GODDDDDDDD...popheads plz don't be xenophobic and give this low scores I BEG

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): me dancing with my reflection

**alwayswords** (7): racially insensitive bop

**camerinian** (7): how the fuck do you finish Myst, I’ve pressed every button on the island and they don’t do shit

**hikkaru** (7): bop but i didn't realize how long this is

**NBA-Mark** (7): I just added this to my workout playlist

**SunshineMarmot101** (7): I don't know this but I respect it

**Maybe9** (6.9): a very powerful meme

**yourfacesucksass** (6.8): low-key workout hype, my arteries are opening and closing like my asshole does in nighttime rehearsal.

**notdallin** (6.6): just when I think one daler mehndi has won the dance-off, here walks up another one… daler mehndi… you’ve done it again you son of a bitch

# Endgame has better special effects

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the song itself is nothing special but i love the positivity that just radiates from this

**Ambelliina** (6): is there any question that this dude absolutely fucks? i would say its about as certain as the fact that he was sentenced to two years of prison for human trafficking. oh also one time i was chilling in my dorm room on a sunday when i just heard some people outside start playing this song LOUDLY anyway this is kinda fun.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Suddenly I'm racist.

**skargardin** (6): Bops a bit but it truly comes alive when watching the video

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5.5): Oh this song is a fun time, we love that. Also, the video is iconic everyone knows this video man. One problem… it wears itself a little fast. I did not realize this song was FOUR MINUTES LONG. How the fuck? This is like a next level novelty song. Like there’s novelty songs, then there’s this. Honestly if this wasn’t so long, I think it would have scored higher for me.

**bandnitos** (5): THE VFX IMDHSJFJFHDJHFDJHDFJ

**LesApfels** (5): Graphic design is my passion!

**ReallyCreative** (5): The was a video my friends and I watched on a weekly basis freshman year of high school and I will never understand why, but I suppose it earns some points purely off of the deeply woven trauma it was willing to unravel within my psyche

**waluigiest** (5): I’m sorry what

This song is actually quite deep and is still relevant today but all I originally remembered is this guy’s voice and **I move away from the mic to breathe in. I apologize for reducing the message of this song to just that.

---

# More woke than Witness by Katy Perry

**moooo566** (11): the only artist on the list who even bothered to move away from the mic to breathe in

**anothertown** (10): i move away from the mic to breathe in

**ExtraEater** (10): woke

**lil\_foofy** (10): Hooo boy what an iconic moment in meme history.

**ManofOranges** (10): Tay Zonday has the voice that 99% of people wish they had. Mmmmmmmmm. Also the writing skill he had to have to write this song? Incredible.

**NBA-Mark** (10): I move away from the mic to breathe in

**Roxieloxie** (10): do you know how mad i would be if i wrote a song talking about fucking systematic oppression against black people and people reduced it to "haha man uses funny voice for song"

**alwayswords** (9): serving vocals

**camerinian** (9): if dude had more than one melody line over and over, this could be a possible 11, because holy shit my guy made a fucking track about institutional and subconscious racism into a meme in 2007 the absolute mad lad

**skargardin** (9): classique

**worlds-okayest666** (9): the way this song is actually really meaningful but my dumb ass used to think it was just haha funny meme xDDD

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): But what is Chocolate Rain??!??!?

**coin-cache** (8): It drags a little but it's still one of the best meme songs.

**evilqueenlex** (8): this song actually has substance

**Maybe9** (8): if the melody was better it would be a 10, his voice is so iconic

**mysario** (8): moves away from mic to explain my rating it's okay but a classic meme

**notdallin** (8): moving away from the mic to breathe… GENIUS

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): **I move away from the mic to breathe in. So, question… what the fuck is chocolate rain? I was thinking it was gonna be like… a metaphor for like acid rain but wait for this boys… “The song is a metaphor for systemic racism against African Americans.” WHAT?????? I gotta go to genius and this down line per line hold the fuck on. Okay back, THIS SONG IS WHAT THE KIDS CALL “WOKE”. Holy shit. I cannot believe I never put two and two together. Goddamn shout out to you Mr. Zonday, you were the wokest motherfucker on the block in 2007!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the fact that the lyrical content of this song is on par with that of dirty computer-

**vayyiqra** (8): I feel really bad for Tay Zonday. He's a decent singer with a unique voice who competently wrote and made a catchy, albeit kind of strange, song about structural racism in America. The dude was woke before woke was a thing. Nobody looked at the lyrics closely and instead just made fun of him for his helpful advice on vocal technique and recording. Tay Zonday did nothing wrong and deserved better. If this goes out early the "Popheads is racist" meme will be confirmed canon.

**waluigiest** (8): **I move away from the mic to breathe in

**yourfacesucksass** (7.7): You can't pull the wool over my eyes, I swear this is Janet Jackson. Change my mind.

**agentofscranton** (7.5): apparently this is about systemic racism - what

**cultofbabies** (7.5): i feel bad rating this lower than some of the other things on here cus this is like an actually serious song but that piano loop drives me to the brink of madness

**LesApfels** (7.5): not enough people realize it's about racism

**Qwilpish** (7.5): So so so so iconic but I dont remember it being this long at all. His voice adds a +1

# Didn’t move away from the mic when breathing in

**materialqirl** (7): i-

**SunshineMarmot101** (7): this is a lot

**1998tweety** (6): Uhhhhh, this is...something

**Ambelliina** (6): the lyrics on this still go hard and are incredibly relevant today and tay zonday really has a solid voice. unfortunately i cant give this much higher of a score because i can only enjoy this same beat and vocal melody for so long and that amount of time is a fair bit lower than the length of the song

**bandnitos** (6): eh

**CreepyMannequin** (6): tell the CEO of racism I am coming to destroy him

**DaHumanTorch** (6): this meme song is nowhere near as iconic as some of the others here

**Corn\_and\_rice** (5): A classic which i never cared for

**ImAMemeDuh** (4): never got the hype tbh

**bbfan132** (3): this used to be funny in 2007 but now? snore

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): wow my anxeity is NOT having this no ma'am this is like, my internal soundtrack when I have a panic attack

**loloeffeff** (2): never found this funny

**rickikardashian** (2): ok

**fadedblue09** (1.5): This went on for too long and by the time it ended, the novelty had worn off.

**bespectacIed** (1): i move away from the mic to breathe in

**rslashpoopheads** (1): ok

**timothy444** (1): This is one of those songs where the joke gets old after 30 seconds, and memes aside, it really isn't good at all.

Bars on bars on bars on bars. Honestly just pure fire in my opinion. This song although it is a novelty song that was intentionally comedic, peaked at number #3 in the UK and has probably outsold many of your favs. 

---

# It’s getting hot in herre

**lilacsweetener** (11): aight boom 💥

**camerinian** (10): "When the ting went quack quack quack, you man was ducking" is unironically a seriously hard bar

**LesApfels** (10): idk how but every single line is fucking iconic

**letsallpoo** (10): a popheads jukebox classic

**ManofOranges** (10): This was me but in middle school when I was super insecure so I just wore a jacket everyday because I was super insecure and then someone would be like "how are you wearing that jacket right now? It's May?!" and I'd just be like "I'm not hot" except I was actually sweating like a pig

**Roxieloxie** (10): i unironically love EVERYTHING about this. this is my favorite example next to "why the fuck you lying" where the full version of the meme also slaps

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The flow here is actually really impressive

**vayyiqra** (10): I identify heavily with this song, as a man who can't fucking stand heat, finds summer to be an awful death world, yet is forced to endure it by denying it. This song was a true work of genius, deconstructing masculinity and in particular the hip-hop community's odd fixation with large, heavy, fur-lined jackets that men must wear at all times for no reason. I still know every word of this and think it's tragic that as a meme, the onomatopoeia got all the attention, not its sociocultural commentary.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): Like Big Shaq I am also never hot. Seriously I’m wearing 3 layers right now, INDOORS. On top of that I have a blanket, that’s 4 layers. Also I could probably recite this from memory, but it’s been some time. Also this song has the sauce, raw sauce.

**1998tweety** (9): His delivery is actually quite good and the beat is good but some of the lyrics just take the song down a notch.

**bespectacIed** (9): i conic. Quick mafs skrtiitbrapbrapbap. Let's give it to the straight guys this time, this was genuinely funny

**cremeebrulee** (9): the lyricism .... nicki minaj and cardi B wish

**moooo566** (9): one of those rare memes that i felt like i was really on the ground floor for

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): A Pitchfork™ Approved Top 100 Song of 2017

**waluigiest** (9): this directly led to bad and boujee

**materialqirl** (8.5): skrrrrrr pop pop pop

**Corn\_and\_rice** (8): Great meme, i sometimes remember it ramdomly

**DaHumanTorch** (8): when he said "the ting goes skrrah pop pop ka ka ka skidi ki pop pop and a pu pu brr boom ski ya du du ku ku dun dun poom poom you dun know" i felt that deep in my soul

**geekysheep\_** (8): lmao ive never actually heard this just seen tweets about it

**SunshineMarmot101** (8): oh hell yeah

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): Weirdly good for a meme song

**bbfan132** (7.5): what did i just watch lmao? is this a grime parody? i’m out of the loop..

**rickikardashian** (7.5): fun fact: this song got ripped off so badly in spanish, and was turned into the dumbest song to exist, and it got popular enough to get played at parties and the radio

**TiltControls** (7.5): but really how isn't he a little warm

**anothertown** (7): me when i don’t want to put my jacket on the back of the chair at the restaurant

**coin-cache** (7): The 2+2 line

**HoodooMooJuice** (7): The beat's alright, +1 for vocal ability. Rap really isn't my thing, but I'm pretty sure these lyrics are really bad.

**lil\_foofy** (7): I... I can relate to the song. sobs in beta male

**wavingwolves** (7): i hate math

**yourfacesucksass** (7): Didn't even know this was a meme?

# feeling cold

**cultofbabies** (6.6): "when the ting went 'quack quack quack' / you man were DUCKING" actual bars

**notdallin** (6.2): the girl at 1:54 is all of us

**SFbby** (6): Man's got big math skills

**skargardin** (6): Bop

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): the fact that this was honestly played in clubs in the uk welp

**fadedblue09** (5.5): This was kinda unremarkable.

**Ambelliina** (5): this song goes 3 minutes longer than the joke is remotely funny but the beat goes kinda hard so i cant rate it that low

**ImAMemeDuh** (5): fuck england for owning the whole world at one point

**Qwilpish** (5): bane of math majors

**NBA-Mark** (4): 😴😴😴

**timothy444** (4): Good when during its peak but now it's just a novelty song, a bad one at that!

**rslashpoopheads** (3): never hot

**alwayswords** (1): this meme :sleeping:

**bandnitos** (1): IT WAS FUNNY FOR TWO DAYS AND THEN PEOPLE DIDNT KNOW THAT IT WAS TIME TO STOP

**Maybe9** (1): unwatchable

If you treat this as satire (even though I still don’t know if it was) it’s actually perfect. These girls are doing what no one else could.  This is one song that for most people was so bad it was kind of good, but there were still a handful of people who just didn’t like or get it at all.

---

# hot girl summer

**bandnitos** (10): this is an underrated classic also the really big heart line is top tier

**bespectacIed** (10): I think my brain's fried because I cannot hate this song. These two white girls, they were 100% right. I hope they are thriving and not racist today

**DaHumanTorch** (10): "just kidding...we're perfect" this is an 11 contender tbh, when will your faves ever

**loloeffeff** (10): one of the funniest memes ever uploaded

**ManofOranges** (10): These girls know what's up I have been looking for a song to really express my problems in my life. Thank you so much to these girls

**materialqirl** (10): we NEED an album

**mysario** (10): I remember almost every word to this trash song

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): relatable

**ReallyCreative** (10): simultaneously invented and ended lyricism, I cannot stop crying at this they are such unapologetic icons

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Yup, I’m fucking rich, you’re fucking poor. Thank you TMG for that song but also… This original song. Oh man, classic. Yes, I am yelling out the lyrics right now. Glad I’m home alone. I am not a hot girl, but fuck I have problems too. Honestly, for as amateur this is and accidentally funny, it lowkey slaps. I mean it’s so clearly “Daddy paid for this song and video” but still… Oh it’s a gem. Like Miley said, they can’t be tamed. And my wife’s tennis coach is having sex with her….

**rickikardashian** (10): “we’re just like you, except we’re hot” is the funniest line to ever be sung

**saucymac** (10): I like to sing this song to my dog except i change "hot girls" to "hot dogs" to make it more relatable to him.

**waluigiest** (9.9): REAL HOT GURL SHIT. bh I’m sad that they back down from their radical stance at the last second.

**bbfan132** (9): these girls are lyrical geniuses. love it.

**Maybe9** (9): finally a relateable song

**Qwilpish** (9): relatable i also have a really big... heart

**SFbby** (9): Lana took inspiration from this bop to create Beautiful People Beautiful Problems

**cremeebrulee** (8): "they don't know i have a really big- HEART" i'm rolling

**HoodooMooJuice** (8): The song is grating, but the self awareness(?) is hilarious.

**moooo566** (8): unironically pretty funny

**wavingwolves** (8): relatable!

**yourfacesucksass** (8): "I got the look. I got the butt, but those things don't make me a slut." Invented feminism and patented hotness.

**camerinian** (7.5): unironically better than Cher Lloyd's whole career

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): Brock's Dubs version is better

**Ambelliina** (7): i actually never heard this before the rate and i expected it to be lame but actually its like a cross between botdf and early kesha which is really cool

**Corn\_and\_rice** (7): I hate that i know the lyrics to this

**geekysheep\_** (7): im just like you except im hot

**LesApfels** (7): This was parodied in the Littlest Pet Shop animated series. When will your fave?

**NBA-Mark** (7): Invented Hot Girl Summer

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I have a really big heart.

**vayyiqra** (7): HOT PROBLEMS, WHO'S GOT 'EM / I'VE GOT 'EM TOO (NAH NAH-NAH NAH NAHHH) I can't decide if this is cringe or amazing. The low-effort, tuneless vocals have to be intentional ... right? It's impressively dumb though, I'll give it that.

# so not hot

**1998tweety** (6): Carly Rae Jepsen outsold

**agentofscranton** (6): i love slayyyter

**fadedblue09** (6): Damn...I’d love to know what they were on when they made this.

**cultofbabies** (5): this song was literally made as a joke between friends and it's pretty funny

**ImAMemeDuh** (5): these girls look like they go to drag shows (but only ones with RPDR alum) yet call their gay coworker fag behind his back.

**lil\_foofy** (5): More like THOT problems amirite? ...I don't know what I'm saying anymore.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I think they put in about 30% effort to singing that song

**notdallin** (4.1): those harmonies are absolutely amazing

**coin-cache** (4): Except we're hot (hothothothot )

**SunshineMarmot101** (4): this reminds me of why I shunned youtube for years

**alwayswords** (3): "They see my blonde hair / Blue eyes and class / But they don't know / I have a really big heart" this literally invented the lyrics in the bridge of dear future husband

**skargardin** (3): mess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): 7 Rings - Ariana Grande (2019)

Only know this song from Just Dance, somehow I was never exposed to it otherwise. 
Upon further research, this song was an international hit peaking number one pretty much everywhere except the USA hot 100 billboard (of course). It’s another novelty song that blew up because of the dance that went with it, which was another Macerena-esque dance. Also this song had a conspiracy where it was largely satanic themed apparently? The band has denied it but its a fun fact. 
(Also yes this is another song that isn’t really a meme but I let it slide as it had many upvotes).

---

# condiment queens

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): An iconic worldwide smash hit!

**1998tweety** (10): An actual massive bop

**agentofscranton** (10): ketchup > mayonnaise > mustard and that's on pyramid

**anothertown** (10): why do i associate this song with Kangaroo Jack and a google search turned up nothing :pensive:

**bespectacIed** (10): En esta casa staneamos a Satanás!!!!!!!!

**fadedblue09** (10): I am SHOOK to find out this was considered a meme song. Wtf this is an iconic bop and it should win even though it’s not getting my 11.

**lil\_foofy** (10): For when you want to summon the Devil.

**loloeffeff** (10): this is the ketchup song right? invented condiments !

**ManofOranges** (10): I cannot believe the people who wrote rapper's delight took a time machine to the future to copy this iconic song. I would watch out if I were them.

**rickikardashian** (10): the earliest memory I have is me watching this music video while sitting on the floor of my old apartment. I guess this just makes me appreciate this even more

**skargardin** (10): Primary school jam right here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): A FUCKING BANGER

**DaHumanTorch** (9): im still shook this made it onto just dance

**moooo566** (9): when i was like 14 we had this old substitute teacher from germany who used to do the dance if we were good for the whole lesson, and he was basically the only person who could consistently get us to do what we were told, good times

**ReallyCreative** (9): apparently this song has like, satanic references and stuff so in addition to being a bit of a bop, we have to stan

**wavingwolves** (9): we have a brazilian version of this song (called ragatanga) and it's honestly one of our most iconic songs

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): Their flow is really good!

**materialqirl** (8.5): omg latina

**cultofbabies** (8.1): a lot better than i remember from the 26,000 times a day i heard it on the radio in 2002

**camerinian** (8): Jesus is every fucking novelty track a meme song now? "yeah my favourite meme is Bob the Builder doing Mambo No 5" fuck I hate this sub. This does pop off though

**evilqueenlex** (8): is this really a meme song? this song is so normal to me from being played at like every kid birthday party.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): satanic kweens

**notdallin** (7.3): why did I think that the meme of this song actually had something to do with ketchup

**bbfan132** (7): the hairstyles that these women have… iconic

**coin-cache** (7): I completely forgot about this song. Kind of goes on too long though.

**SunshineMarmot101** (7): catchy as hell honestly

**waluigiest** (7): I had never heard of this but honestly….. points were kinda made

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.6): Sad fun fact, I don’t like this song, but for the sake of the rate I’ll give a nice lil score. I never got the appeal of this song. At least I can give it one thing, iconic choreography. WAIT APPARENTLY THIS SONG GOT ACCUSED OF HAVING TIES TO SATANISM????? Bruhhhhhhhhhhhh. Just for that the score is going up a little higher than originally thought. How the fuck is this song linked to SATANISM? BRUH. Especially when it’s actually about a dude going into a club… Amazing.

**Corn\_and\_rice** (6): just for nostalgia

**ImAMemeDuh** (6): i love genderbent macerena

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I love Hey Ha by the Lumineers

**yourfacesucksass** (6): Okay so I vaguely know of this song just because of Just Dance, and I didn't really get it? I still don't but it's crazy to me how it went #1 everywhere but the US lmao, of course it's always us. Maybe I don't connect with it because I wasn't exposed to it on the radio/tv as much as other places, so I sort of missed out? Not a terrible song but, ketchup?? Heinz or Hunt's?

# I prefer plain burgers

**timothy444** (5): Average meme

**bandnitos** (4): im underwhelmed

**Ambelliina** (3): is this actually about ketchup i cant tell also its annoying but still kinda bops in a strange way

**CreepyMannequin** (2): America was right about this song

**Maybe9** (2): this is not a powerful meme

**Qwilpish** (2): I don't know this meme and its not that good of a song so it is very middling

**vayyiqra** (1): No. I hate this song, I hate ketchup and I don't like this meme. As the wise man Big Shaq once said, FLEX IT - NO KETCHUP

Closing out Day 1 we have Crab Rave! It’s very boppy for sure. Love the tropical vibe to it. Less impactful if you don’t watch the video with the crabs raving, which is why it did not score as high as other songs in this rate.

# people who like crabs who rave

**rslashpoopheads** (11): I unironically love this song and crab rave memes.

**ExtraEater** (10): Mr. Krabs Rave bops too

**lil\_foofy** (10): I give it a ten because crabs are my favorite animal next to chicken! They look so cuuute! But more importantly, they have incredible umami.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is what the Earth would be like if humans never existed.

**mysario** (10): :crabrave:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): me when this song (inevitably) gets revealed way too early in the rate : 🦀 Crab Rave is Gone! 🦀

**timothy444** (10): Monstercat delivers the EDM choices as always!

**evilqueenlex** (9): insert pubic lice joke i'm not clever enough to come up with

**fadedblue09** (9): Passes for a decent instrumental dance track!

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): The song is very well produced and sounds great, but I don't know what about the song inspired the crabs??

**Roxieloxie** (9): hoes mad

**skargardin** (9): banger

**SunshineMarmot101** (9): very good

**1998tweety** (8.5): It does kind of bop...I'll admit I'm not particularly a fan of the type of people who associate themselves with this meme, the crabs are innocent though.

**notdallin** (8.5): it slaps but they’re yucky

**Qwilpish** (8.5): :crab: :crab: :crab: CRAB SONG IS DEAD :crab: :crab: :crab:

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): I am SO confused, who, what, when, where, and why? It's like if you took a 90s eurodance song and mixed it with a sprinking of trop-house and some...crustaceans.

**anothertown** (8): the power of trop pop

**vayyiqra** (8): So many questions. Why were the crabs raving? How did they know to go to that beach? Do crabs really exhibit this kind of swarm behaviour in real life? They certainly can't dance ... can they? Science still can't explain Crab Rave.

**waluigiest** (8): I’ve seen this meme and I think it’s really funny but I don’t get it

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I never really liked this meme but it's a decent song

**Ambelliina** (7): MY WHORE WIFE IS DEAD!!!!!!

**bandnitos** (7): they copyright this so much it isn't fair

**DaHumanTorch** (7): No one: Popheads giving all men 1s in rates:

# little lobsters put your claws up

**agentofscranton** (6): why it gotta be crabs tho

**camerinian** (6): this really is the perfect meme song cos those 30 seconds of buildup and drop are really good, and I absolutely don't need three minutes of it

**Maybe9** (6): an actually good song

**cultofbabies** (5.5): oh to be a little crab raving on a tropical island beach

**coin-cache** (5): Doesn't really do much outside of the meme imo.

**ImAMemeDuh** (5): i dont know her

**poppinmmolly** (4): isn't this an alt right thing

**bbfan132** (3): crabs freak me out so this will now be in my nightmares for the next 3 weeks

**bespectacIed** (3): that cute edm riff is wasted on this shit

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2.5): I’ve heard the bass boosted version of this so many times I forgot what the original sounded like. Meme culture am I right? At least there’s dancing crabs…

**wavingwolves** (2): god this is a nightmare

**Corn\_and\_rice** (1): not for me

ThunderJams: this is pretty minor and random but I really appreciate the fact that you correctly labelled the song as the "Mii Channel Theme"

I know so many people who call it the "Wii Theme" and honestly it's just embarrassing and disrespectful to the legacy of the Wii and Nintendo
