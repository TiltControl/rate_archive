In addition to Kaphox hosting the plug, I will be revealing who each country is in the comments below, as soon as their 12 points are revealed. Leave your comments on their songs below and what you thought of all of them!

And finally, just a big massive thank you from the both of us for your participation. It's not an over-exaggeration to say that you helped make this thing as amazing as it was, so I hope you all enjoy this as much as we enjoyed running it.

##Europe, are you ready?

poppinmmolly: pretty sure I voted wrong or something. I'm looking at the reveal on the plug and it's putting numbers next to my country when I didn't actually give those points to the song being played? I was focusing on the chat, so maybe I'm misunderstanding how this reveal is. But I'm very confused. 

edit: nvm somebody explained it. I'm good now.

SkyBlade79: MY 12 GOT 4TH PLACE I'M SHAKINGGGG GOOD JOB NORWAY QUEEN

HIT 'EM HARD LIKE A DRUM

my 10 got 3rd, my 8 got 1st :)

also, i did better than I thought! as soon as the reveal happened i had HUGE regrets about my song. it was too safe. i should've went with [Sub Pielea Mea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VYJ3UQCmtM); it'd be divisive, but that's better than mediocre. I am very grateful for my 37 points tho, thanks everyone!

25/43 :)

Hogwartsreject1912: France and Belgium didn't swap 12s? That's unrealistic (PS all the Frenchies her need to temporarily go to a semi-final 1 country for the semis and give Belgium tons of votes cause otherwise they're in danger).
