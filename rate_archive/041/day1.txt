I have a very good reason to give this my 0 and not listen to it; I did show choir in 11th grade and the theme for our end-of-year concert was "popular music throughout decades". When we got to '90s we were split into boys and girls, like much of the concert. They did a medley of songs by the Spice Girls, Destiny's Child and Britney Spears (still jealous), whilst we did NKOTB, NSYNC and BSB. I still stanned 1D hard at this point so for me to be in this boyband-type thing felt super cool (especially since we did a similar thing at the national competition the previous month and got compared to One Direction. Anyway, we performed TPF as the third song in our medley, and we performed it in full, unlike the others. We also had to go into the crowd and greet our mothers as we sang it. Sounds cute, but it just felt super cringe and awkward. Doing that for 3 consecutive nights didn't aid matters either. After hearing it at least 100 times or so I have no interest in hearing it again, even for this rate.

# KTBSPA

**1998tweety** (8.4): No more bops I guess. It's cute that this song is about their moms though.

**amumyspiritanimal** (8): me @ lorde

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): their harmonies made me wet ngl

**Shipsinker22** (8): cute

**flickeredinmymind** (7): aww this is a cute song

# I ALWAYS PREFERRED NSYNC

**rickikardashian** (6.8): aight i was expecting this to be fan baiting but this was cute. too bad the song is just boring

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): The Perfect Stan (2018 Remastered)

**bbfan132** (5.6): Why are they so obsessed with their fans? I didn’t realize that Taylor Swift managed a boy band back in the late 90s. She would make a song about moms being fans of their children.

**KarenTheCockpitPilot** (5.3): sweet song but pretty shit

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): hmmm

**DraculaWeekend** (3): This is sweet but also kind of weird

**calltehshots** (1): This is torture.

**MrSwearword** (1): this is a horrendous album closer. "The Perfect Fan" knows better than to like this bullshit.

**saucymac** (1): this song is a fucking trainwreck

**strawberryswing1** (0): omg this is the corniest shit i've ever listened to in my whole life

**1998tweety** (7.8): Please let the next song be a bop

**Shipsinker22** (7.5): a weird song but anyway it suffers from the problem of it just being too long

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): Dí qué sientes cuando pienso en ti

**Banananaise** (5.5): what the hell is different about spanish people's eyes

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): I'm cringing and bopping but mostly cringing

**TragicKingdom1** (5): lmao at how vague the latin vibes are

**bbfan132** (4.8): Toni Braxton outskinnied with Spanish Guitar.

**calltehshots** (4): Is this seriously real? lol I'm embarrassed.

**DraculaWeekend** (3): huh?

**MrSwearword** (1): chupa una verga que "cuando mira en tus ojos espanol", pinches gringos chingandos

I may have given "Heart" a higher score if that was the album closer on the standard version rather than this. Nonetheless, we see our first Britney song exit the rate, proving that maybe it's best she leaves the songwriting to the experts.

---
# Wow all the comments are either noncommittal or totally disparaging

**calltehshots** (8): This song is a classic just because of how insane it is. Britney wrote this and you can tell lol. I can't tell if I like it because it's good or because it's ridiculous.

**1998tweety** (7.4): I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. Song wasn't awful but it was super boring.

**amumyspiritanimal** (7): lmao this song is so corny

**poppinmmolly** (7): one of my faves as a kid but eh

**rotating3Dtext** (7): wow cheesy

**Banananaise** (6): i was really torn between giving this an ironically high score or betraying poptimism and revealing my true distaste for this song

**bbfan132** (5.8): These lyrics sound like they were written by a 10 year old, but I think that Britney and the other songwriters/producers were trying to connect with children and also wanted it to have this sort of weird charm to it. I’m not sure if I really bought into it that much, but it didn’t sound bad.

**saucymac** (5): I can't decide if this song is iconic or horrific

**CreepyMannequin** (4): Cute but somehow manages to feel like it’s five minutes long

**DraculaWeekend** (2): This sounds soooo old

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1.5): it wouldn't be a Britney album without at least one ridiculous track would it? I'm sorry but you can't just be older than 14 and write this song.

**MrSwearword** (0): MAKE IT STOP, KILL IT WITH FIRE, SEND THIS TO HELL (me @ ur taste)

Minus 2 for that horrendous ad-lib at the end. Probably the worst thing about this song is that it's not even original; it's a cover by an artist named Joe. The fact that it isn't even original is a very telltale sign this should never have existed

I now regret having this as the closer instead of just tacking on "Come On Over Baby" on at the end of this rate. Not that it would've saved Xtina

# WELL, OBVIOUSLY

**1998tweety** (8.3): The song was a little boring at first but the ending saved it.

# AN OBVIOUS SNOOZER

**bbfan132** (6.2): This kind of reminds me of a vaguer yet more sophisticated version of Dear Diary, and I prefer this song. It doesn’t really fit Christina, though.

**calltehshots** (6): What kind of broadway throwaway track.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): weakest ballad on the album

**CreepyMannequin** (5): Literally forgot what this sounded like after I finished listening to it

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Her voice sounds great as usual but this is sooo boring

**Shipsinker22** (4): I am not feeling this song at all and it’s really disappointing that this is the closing track

**amumyspiritanimal** (2): kind of a bad album closer imo

The spoken-word interlude following this song is such a guilty pleasure of mine. If I were Britney, you know what I'd say to that boy? "My heart is beating loud, I want your body now." He may hold it against me, though ;)

---
# I SAW THE SIGN AND IT OPENED UP MY EYES

**calltehshots** (9.5): This sensual bop!!!! The spoken word parts invented poetry.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): this is relaxing

**1998tweety** (8.2): I liked that this song brought back the spoken interludes since they weren't present in the pasts couple tracks.

# THIS BLINDED ME

**bbfan132** (7): I like the sort of funky sound that this song has, with the guitar playing as she is speaking and singing. Also, the string portion toward the end was interesting.

**rickikardashian** (5.5): ….this is just spoken words

**DraculaWeekend** (3): zzzzzzzz

**MrSwearword** (3): DIDN'T I JUST LITERALLY SCORE A SONG IN WHICH BRITNEY WANTS TO HEAR CERTAIN WORDS LIKE 4 TRACKS AGO?! Fuck lazy, the production is collecting unemployment checks.

This is exactly the kind of campiness from the turn of the millennium I was looking for in this rate! THE futuristic bop of every '90s kid's childhood. Too bad it's *NSYNC's first song to leave the rate, unfortunately.

**calltehshots** (9): Yas this dial-up cyber sex BOP. These are some chooooice lyrics but I stan. The beat breakdown near the end still tugs at my wig.

**Shipsinker22** (8.5): people only remember the Digitial digital get down part but that’s fine because it’s the best part of the song

**1998tweety** (8.4): Pretty unique from everything else on the album.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This aged like milk but it's still a bop. That DnB breakdown was cool too

**rickikardashian** (7.5): just say sexting

**saucymac** (7.5): i used to listen to this after Email my heart. I shipped JT and Brit so hard

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): the autotune lol...v catchy tho!

**Banananaise** (7): this is some charli xcx pc music shit

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): PC Music ancestor?

**Leixander** (6): don't hug me i'm scared teas

# YOU LAZY KIDS ALWAYS GLUED TO YOUR PHONES

**milkywayinradius** (6): T H E F U T U R E I S N O W the song is pretty decent (I like the bridge “baby baby we could do all that we want” part) but the lyrics make me uncomfortable because I don’t use technology like that

**bbfan132** (5.8): I don’t know what’s more outdated: the autotuned vocals, the lyrics about getting freaky on the “digital screen”, or the production that includes Internet sounds. Also, I’ve had 20+ year old guys flirt with me over the Internet when I was younger than 18, so this song doesn’t leave a wonderful taste with me….

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): what are with these cringe-inducing technology references

**MrSwearword** (5): the vocal processing detracts the shit out of this. Also the song title makes this more dated than it is.

**letsallpoo** (1): me when i log onto reddit dot com slash r slash popheads

**amumyspiritanimal** (0): the spiritual predecessor of Filthy, so an automatic 0 (pun intended)

**CreepyMannequin** (0): Always hated this one

# FLOP HARMONY WHO

**calltehshots** (10): These VOCALS!!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): this is how to sound like you actually have regret over not telling the person you like to fuck that you love them

**1998tweety** (8.3): This sounds like the Charlie Puth song with Boyz II Men.

**poppinmmolly** (8): I love Boyz II Men

**rickikardashian** (8): the song is a lil boring but im such a slut for harmonies

**Shipsinker22** (8): i have no clue what the lyrics are because i suddenly entered such a calm state

**TragicKingdom1** (8): vocals !

# YOU'RE A BOYBAND, NOT A BARBERSHOP QUINTET

**milkywayinradius** (7): this song is too sad, the acapella is great though

**bbfan132** (6.9): It’s a nice closer to the standard album. I like how they decided to put an acapella song on the album, and it turned out successfully. It’s not great, but it’s nice enough.

**MrSwearword** (10): at least it sounds different than about 95% of this fucking album

**1998tweety** (8): The heartbeat at the end was a nice touch.

**calltehshots** (8): A sweet bop. Does burn a small nostalgia flame for me. Britney sounds great on it too.

# BSB ABOUT TO LOSE ME

**1998tweety** (8.3): I have a feeling I'm just not a big fan of ballads from this time period.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): make up your damn mind lol. nice ballad though.

**DrunkHurricane** (6.5): Gratuitous key changes seem to be a cliché in these albums

**strawberryswing1** (6): i feel cliché giving ballads low scores but these album tracks are so forgettable, and the ballads especially so

**bbfan132** (5.7): I actually said “Oh, no!” when I heard the first two seconds and knew that it was going to be a ballad. Their vocals do not fit very well with boring ballads like this. If only they had some sort of personality/charm/memorability in their music, like *NSYNC did.

**tevinterimperium** (5): this album has way too many of these slow ballad type of songs that are all basically the same

**amumyspiritanimal** (4): godddd this album is boring, I guess I'm team NSYNC

**calltehshots** (4): Boring as hell.

**MrSwearword** (1): as a sleep-aid, it's very effective. As a song, kill this boring shit with fire.

# SATISFACTION GUARANTEED

**CreepyMannequin** (10): The Rolling Stones found OD’ed in a ditch!

**tevinterimperium** (10): Britney ended the rolling stones

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): I didn’t know this was a cover. Also, this song gives me anxiety for some reason.

**1998tweety** (8.4): The lead in from the previous track was good. This is a cover but Britney does a good job of making it feel like a Britney song.

**amumyspiritanimal** (8): the rolling stones who, they flopped anyways

**calltehshots** (8): God bless Britney for inventing The Rolling Stones. Their cover of this Britney jam is decent as well.

# ONE STAR

**Shipsinker22** (8): its good but i think the mood change in the song was for the worse

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): it's ok but kiiiinda bland?

**poppinmmolly** (6.7): a decent cover but I wasn't a fan of the Rolling Stones version either

**bbfan132** (6.1): Hmmm. I like the beginning, and the VMA performance with this song at the beginning is still iconic, but her vocals are not that great in this song, and it’s sort of dull at times. I do like it at certain points though, especially toward the end.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): kind of a bop, but doesn't offer anything new to the album and is also incredibly repetitive for no good reason

**DraculaWeekend** (2): This is just so confusing

Did Robin Thicke write the pitch correction in for Christina too? It's not like she needs it. Nor does this album really need this song.

# HANDS ON ME - ARIANA GRANDE FT. A$AP FERG

**MrSwearword** (10): this is actually refreshing and nice. If this were a single, it'd flop to shitsville but what a pleasant, enjoyable track.

**amumyspiritanimal** (9): way to short

**1998tweety** (7.6): The auto tune on this was wild.

# U + UR HAND - P!NK

**calltehshots** (7): This song REEKS of early 2000s filler the most of all these albums tbh. The way she says "shexaaay" and the random autotune on one of the runs near the end? I'm gagging honestly.

**bbfan132** (6.8): The lyrics are a bit cringy at times, but it sounds nice. Definitely filler (also, I heard autotune and… no, Christina, no).

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): Robin Thicke wrote this? :deadbanana:

**milkywayinradius** (4): That autotune, kanye’s inspiration

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): okay I'm all for autotune but JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT

# She was younger and miseducated, we all make mistakes. [insert more "apology" video filler]

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): autotune is for pussies – Christina Aguilera, 2009

I feel you, Justin. I tweet to Halsey on a regular basis. On a different note, what note are you singing at the end of the bridge, JC? I wish that would have been re-recorded or remastered or something.

# I COULD BE THE ONE

**1998tweety** (8.3): Much better than the other ballads imo.

**bbfan132** (7.4): It’s okay, but it sounds… a bit off? I like it, though.

# YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

**DraculaWeekend** (6): The lyrics, especially "writing letters to my garbage can," made me laugh more than they should have

**letsallpoo** (6): kinda neckbeardy

**MrSwearword** (6): I guess it's fine but a weird closer

**amumyspiritanimal** (4): no you are not the one

**milkywayinradius** (3): wait why does this sound like backstreet boys reject songs wtf happened to this album.

What would this have sounded like if Shania kept it? I'm fine not knowing, because we got this on the Femme Fatale Tour in what I consider to be a very underrated live performance.

# BUY ACCELERATE (PROD. BY KANYE WEST) ON ITUNES

**calltehshots** (10): This song takes me on a journey. A power ballad that Britney is giving vocals on. I'm moved. That trump supporter stepped on necks when she wrote this. Britney also looks beyond ethereal in the video.

# THE FIRST TO KNOW

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): me when someone spreads shit about me

**1998tweety** (8.7): A good Britney ballad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): mid-tempo ballads are my kink

# OUT OF THE LOOP

**bbfan132** (7.1): This is a cute song, even if it’s the complete opposite of the first 4 songs. I don’t love it though; it feels like it’s missing something or isn’t powerful enough.

**amumyspiritanimal** (6): mediocre

**TragicKingdom1** (4): generally sloppy, not sure what tone it's going for

**MrSwearword** (3): the cheesiness offends my soul greatly but Britney really is trying to make this song suck less.

**CreepyMannequin** (1): Shania Twain is a SNAKE

**DraculaWeekend** (0): I hate everything about this

"Eh, I'm broke". Wow Justin Timberlake was me_irl before me_irl was even a thing. Aside from that it doesn't sound entirely convincing to me that they're excited about their paycheck, especially since Lou Pearlman was out of the equation for good by that point.

#BILLS BILLS BILLS

**milkywayinradius** (10): that bassline in the background! I love the “I love the way that you move, said you look so sweet when you’re moving to the beat” when all their voices come in. I need to learn how to break dance for this song. The “oh.. I’m broke” part at the end really hits home with me

**calltehshots** (9.5): It took me YEARS to discover this song was a cover when I heard the original in a grocery store lol. This is near and dear to my heart. Also me whenever I get paid.

**CreepyMannequin** (8.5): Reminds me of payday, which I like

**1998tweety** (8.2): Random bridge was not needed cause the rest of the song bops hard.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): JC really sells this one lmao

**rickikardashian** (7): the song is aight but that Melody at the start snatched me

**DraculaWeekend** (7): This is absolutely hilarious

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx1H6H7TZ3Q

**tevinterimperium** (7): Can't relate!! #unemployedfish

**bbfan132** (6.9): Justin and JC can sing about “booty-shakin’” to me anytime :janet:

**Shipsinker22** (6): bad filler

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): lmao no

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): broke af, can't relate

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): me receiving my paycheck

**amumyspiritanimal** (1): wooooowww this is bad

**MrSwearword** (1): so can I blame them for Kim Kartrashian's "Jam (Turn it Up)" in the "Got paid" as a rich person sentiments? I can, great; I BLAME YOU.
