**Highest scores:** (10 x2) milkywayinradius, saucymac (9.5 x1) Leixander (9 x1) calltehshots (8.3 x1) 1998tweety 

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) flickeredinmymind 

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/hMN2CUKA)**

---
Not a fan of songs about jealousy but I have exceptions. This one more or less is.

---
# THE ILLEST

**milkywayinradius** (10): the frantic melody matches the lyrics and theme of jealousy very well

**calltehshots** (9): The lyrics are very cringey in 2018 but this still slays.

**1998tweety** (8.3): That random outro took my song down by a solid .3 points.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): if you ignore the 'good guy' lyrics this a bop and a half

**bbfan132** (7.6): Another fun song with nice harmonies. Nothing special about it, but it’s still good.

# I'M SO SICK OF LOVE SONGS

**Shipsinker22** (6): this is messy

**amumyspiritanimal** (5): too much JT

**MrSwearword** (5): this is what Nick Jonas tried to do on Jealous but NSYNC managed to sound less cringy than he did. Still, the vocals are rushed as shit sounding.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): this sounds dated :(

deleted: Yep:

> The music video, somewhat darker in tone than any of the band's previous releases, touches on several of the band's real-life issues. Littrell had undergone open heart surgery the previous year for a defect he has had since birth. The video used actual footage of Richardson and his deceased father. The girl Dorough sees represents his sister, who died a year earlier of the disease Lupus. Additionally, the bus McLean rides is marked for "Denniz St.", and is driven by an actor who resembles Denniz PoP (who died in 1998 and produced some Backstreet Boys tracks, besides being the mentor of the song's producer Max Martin). An alternate version of the video was dedicated in his honor.

twat_brained: Two more songs today! As well as one bonus song.

4 for Britney and Xtina each, and only 2 for each of the boybands. Are we gonna see one of these acts miss the top 10 altogether?

amumumyspiritanimal: Obvious top 5 prediction:

* I Want It That Way
* Bye Bye Bye
* Genie In A Bottle
* Stronger
* Oops I Did It Again

Let's hope nobody Britney's Britney and steal that #1 spot form OIDIA(maybe Stronger but that's acceptable)

enecks: I can see Genie in A Bottle robbing it because of the Los Ageless principle - if an artist has a lot of strong 11-worthy songs, an artist with only one is more likely to win because of focus.
