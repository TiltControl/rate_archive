This song cleared my skin, watered my crops and blessed my firstborn. Christina's vocal acrobatics are EVERYTHING in this song! This is my frontrunner for Miss Songeniality thus far.

# THE BEST DISNEY PRINCESS, ELSA WHO?

**rickikardashian** (11): I SWEAR TO FUCKING JESUS IF DISNEY DOESNT AT LEAST RELEASE A 2019 VERSION FOR THE MULAN REMAKE OF THIS SONG SANG BY CHRISTINA HERSELF IM GOING TO BURN THE HOTELS, STUDIOS AND PARKS

**1998tweety** (10): Chinese icon

**amumyspiritanimal** (10): MULAN

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Mulan is the best Disney princess don't @ me

**milkywayinradius** (10): This song is getting the Mulan score, great message in the song. I need to be myself on this sub, a heterosexual male

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): so when's the Disney Animated Canon songs rate

**bbfan132** (9.3): I love this song. That’s all I have to say.

**calltehshots** (9): I LOVE this song and relate to it on many levels, but it is not a 10 since this isn't the Lea Solanga version.

**MrSwearword** (9): just short of snatching me bald, this is the track that tried to define Christina first. It failed but not as a song on its own merit. There's simply better songs to her name but this one is nice.

**Shipsinker22** (9): the cover change made me think my spotify premium ended but a good song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): wow look it's another pretty good ballad

# SLUTBOPTINA>>>>>>>>BALLADTINA

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): sorry but it's like this version drags too much

**tevinterimperium** (6): The Mulan version is more gay friendly tbh!

I can see some appeal to this but did it really deserve to go #1? Better this dethroned it than that Savage Garden song which probably nobody remembers.

---
# XTINA'S GOT WHAT I WANT

**flickeredinmymind** (11): this probably isn't gonna win the rate but it should!

**calltehshots** (10): A grade A bop that inspired an Amanda Bynes masterpiece.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): That high note!!

**milkywayinradius** (10): part where the strings come in turns me into a proper high class woman

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): has anyone here tried to bleach their asshole?

**bbfan132** (9.5): An adorable song that shows off Xtina’s vocal chops without her going overboard.

**1998tweety** (8.6): This was okay.

# I DON'T WANT IT THAT WAY

**MrSwearword** (8): competent but taciturn and languid as fuck

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): I gotta say this is my least favorite single out of all of the singles in this rate.

Don't pretend like Max didn't just copy and paste the electric guitar solo from "(You Drive Me) Crazy" onto this. Also, weren't the Backstreet Boys only recording artists for like 4 years by this point? It's one thing for One Direction to have amassed that many fans but BSB only had one album by that point. Then again Britney only had one album out when "Oops!" dropped. I need to brush up on my TRL pop.

# LARGE MOOD

**strawberryswing1** (11): the opening notes of this song STILL get me pumped like I'm 10 years old again.

**CreepyMannequin** (10): The ultimate bop!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): yeeeeaaAAAHAHAHA!!! HA HA HA HAAAA HA!

**flickeredinmymind** (10): another eleven contender

**milkywayinradius** (10): dude they were cosplaying in mecha suits in the MV, easy 10

**MrSwearword** (10): is it their best song? NO. Is it a very good song that can transcend the fact it's dated as fuck soundwise? YES.

**poppinmmolly** (10): SUCH A BOP

**calltehshots** (9.5): This song fucking slaps. The video is peak late 90s CGI realness. And also extremely pandering. But it bumps.

**Shipsinker22** (9): i’ve never listened to this album before but i’m glad it at least starts off not sounding like the others

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): i was like "wtf" but also "cool"

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i love the growly texture to their voices

# …isn't everything?

**1998tweety** (8.5): Is this a fat joke?

# SIZE MATTERS

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): it's fine but not strong enough for an opener

# It's probably Kevin, he's the most forgettable IMO. Or is it Howie?

**bbfan132** (5.9): I don’t know who it is, but one of the singers’ voices does not sound good at all. It sounds too… rough for a boy band that makes pop music. Also, the lyrics are kind of ridiculous and corny. The production does sound pretty epic and the harmonies in the chorus are nice, but it’s too repetitive for me (also, what is the random high note at the end?).

Does this woman really think we aren't gonna notice when she pulls a Myah Marie? This doesn't even sound like Xtina!

# DON'T MAKE ME SKIP THIS

**Shipsinker22** (9): good song but so damn long

**calltehshots** (8): With some tweaking this sounds like it could be a Sugababes song. It's pretty decent.

**Banananaise** (7.5): concept: christina at a psychedelic 90s euro disco hellscape, scared and screaming melodically

# DON'T MAKE ME LISTEN TO IT AGAIN

**bbfan132** (6.8): It’s… okay? Nothing special.

No, the lyrics don't make sense. And no, the key change is not seamless either. But goddamn, did this song ever set the precedent for boybands everywhere, past, present and future. Sadly it's the last Backstreet Boys song in the rate and it doesn't even crack the top 5. It definitely got plenty of love from you guys, which is understandable because it's a great tune!

---
# TELL ME WHY

**poppinmmolly** (11): I was debating not going for the obvious 11 but then it came on and...it just has to be.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): to this day, one of the most iconic songs written

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10

**DraculaWeekend** (10): TELL ME WHY

**MrSwearword** (10): THIS is their best song because the Lauren Jauregui of the group, Kevin got to sing the crucial bridge before the key change. (he was interrupted by AJ but who gives a fuck) Also, it's just a great song.

**Shipsinker22** (10): this’ll never fade from people’s memories

**calltehshots** (9.5): This loses a bit of points because THE SONG DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. But I know every word and it is a nostalgia punch in the face every time.

**bbfan132** (9.1): This song is too legendary for me to give it a low score. It’s very mellow and soothing, and it sounds very pleasant, even if the lyrics don’t make much sense.

**rickikardashian** (9): Fire+Desire. Take a shot

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this has gone down very well for good reason. the guys REALLY sell it. plus that key change!

# TELL ME HOW YOU MANAGED TO AVOID THE ORIGINAL

**letsallpoo** (7): im pretty sure i heard the weird al parody before i heard this

# TELL ME WHY NOT

**CreepyMannequin** (5): I know it’s a classic but it never did anything for me

This album really does not hold up well historically, unfortunately. Too fillery and the only "punchy" single is Larger Than Life. If you wanna see what the Backstreet Boys are up to now, they've just released a new single, "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" for their upcoming album later this year.

---
**TragicKingdom1**: This album let me down. I was expecting more genius songwriting from Max Martin and friends, but instead I was served ballad after ballad. They make up the bulk of the album and although not all of them are bad, they are mostly indistinguishable. I'll give the boys credit for serving occasional vocals on them but I really wish there were more bops here (and that means a lot coming from me, considering how much I complain about "slutbopheads" showing bias in rates). The bops that are here are good but NSYNC did it better. Worst album in the rate! [Grade: C+]

**CreepyMannequin**: Solid start but falters with all the ballads in the back-half

**Banananaise**: pretty disappointing compared to the other albums... a few good songs though.

**DraculaWeekend**: There are wayyy too many ballads/slow songs on this album

Literally invented the month of May, Maia who?! Memes aside, Justin and JC's solos elevate this song to pop greatness. Having Max Martin on the track also helps.

---
# MAY FLOWERS

**DraculaWeekend** (11): I had a tough time picking my 11 but I feel pretty good about this. The MV has a pretty cool concept and this song is such an earworm.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): A top 4 Max Martin song, along with Since U Been Gone, Teenage Dream and Can't Feel My Face. The key change is immaculate.

**amumyspiritanimal** (10): well, it is

**bbfan132** (10): Memes and May jokes aside, this song is super fun, and I love JC’s voice in this song. God, I used to be in love with him back when I was 12 (I discovered them 12-13 years too late…).

**calltehshots** (10): How this is their only #1 single is beyond me. But it's well deserved this is a fucking banger.

**MrSwearword** (10): the memers try to ruin this but this song is memorable for being cute and the music video which might be their best video.

**1998tweety** (9.6): Wow 2 huge bops in a row.

**DrunkHurricane** (9): https://pics.me.me/kitfisto-nearly-the-end-of-april-you-know-what-that-19520814.png

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): insert meme

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i have never heard of this meme until 2016

# HOW LONG TILL JUNE

**strawberryswing1** (7): most annoying meme ever

This song hits really close to home for many Britney stans, for obvious reasons. For a more detailed look at this song, [here is a throwback post I made for it last year.](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5vvjd2/throwback_britney_spears_lucky/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=u_twat_brained)

# THE UNLUCKY 11S

**bbfan132** (11): This song is perfection. The introduction, the repetition of verbs and the subsequent sounds that the words indicate (“knock, knock, knock”), the interlude of the girl receiving an award, the production, and ESPECIALLY the chorus. I love how she turns the line “then why do these tears come at night” into this sort of odd yet motivating and powerful message/chant. Obviously, I also find it interesting how the lyrics closely reflect Britney’s own life, making it clear that the “Hollywood girl” in the song is actually Britney. It’s easily my favorite song off the album and in this entire rate.

**KarenTheCockpitPilot** (11): One of my favorite songs ever. A bop not about love or s*x or drugs but just about life. And yet it's still catchy.

**Shipsinker22** (11): Honestly? if there was any time i was kidnapped and forced to listen to one song for the rest of time, i’d be fine with it being this one.

# LUCKED OUT

**1998tweety** (10): A cute ballad.

**amumyspiritanimal** (10): not me

**calltehshots** (10): This song would've got my 11 if another song on this album wasn't just a little bit more perfect. I honestly get lowkey emotional sometimes when I hear this. Knowing Britney's personal history plus all the nostalgia this song brings - it just does things to me.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I remember irrationally hating this song when it came out, but something clicked a few years ago and I realized how sad it is

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): songs about fame and loneliness always gets to me because I have approximately 1 follower on Apple Music. That’s right, bitches. I’m a celebrity.

**MrSwearword** (10): one of Britney's most underappreciated songs.

**rickikardashian** (10): I have always loved this song. She didn’t kno0w she was foreshadowing her future. If this isnt at least top 5 im sueing

**saucymac** (10): ICONIC

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): iconic

**milkywayinradius** (8): this song makes me cry cry cry every time with my lonely heart

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): the song is just OK but I'm giving it one extra point because honestly celebrities do have it harder than regular people and very few people acknowledge that

# SOMEONE ISN'T FEELING LUCKY

Is there any doubt this is gonna win the bonus rate? Everything just flows together so perfectly and it doesn't entirely feel like Christina is doing vocal acrobatics just for the sake of it. A very high caliber pop song indeed. And one that deserves nothing less than #1

# ALL I WANT IS THIS ON REPEAT

**bbfan132** (10): Absolute perfection. Also, it was #1 when I was born <3

**Shipsinker22** (9): bopperoni

**DraculaWeekend** (10): The superior version

**milkywayinradius** (10): the album version is a pox on christina’s discog, this is the one true version and shouldn’t be a bonus track

**tevinterimperium** (10): So much better than the album version!!

"My loneliness ain't killing me no more" Top 10 Character Arcs honestly. It's a shame this made it just outside the top 3 but it just goes to show how brilliantly this song has aged and how well it holds up with Britney's resilient discography.

---
# STRONGER THAN YESTERDAY

**amumyspiritanimal** (11): seriously the easiest 11 I ever gave out, deserves it much better than Bye Bye Bye which I have a feeling will win... This was my main Pride anthem last year, it's literally one of the best self-empowering anthems ever written, Britney outperformed all y'all faves

**CreepyMannequin** (11): Kelly Clarkson found dead in a ditch

**Leixander** (11): my loneliness ain't killin me no more!

**milkywayinradius** (11): MY LONELINESS AIN’T KILLING ME NO MORE i ordered that on my tombstone

**bbfan132** (10): Another feminist anthem <3 Britney was ahead of the times with songs like this. The pause after “Hush, just stop!” and the overall production by Max Martin (especially in the bridge) are both brilliant. Also, Britney’s high note at the end fits perfectly with the theme of the song. Another easy 10.

**calltehshots** (10): Where were we before this invented being strong? Remember when we were all weak? It's a distant memory since this song made all of us confident, strong women who drive in the rain. You are now stronger than yesterday. Never forget.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I think this is the only Britney single I had on CD. Awesome MV and that callback to Baby One More Time is so cool

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): queen of idk what to put here anymore

**rickikardashian** (10): PEPPERMINT DID NOT WIN THAT LIPSYNC IM SORRY

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of chair dancing

**1998tweety** (9.6): Love the throwback to her first big hit.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): queen of character development

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): pretty much perfect except for those questionable industrial noises

# Britney did political views better

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Kanye did it better

# WEAKER

**strawberryswing1** (7): iconic lyrics but song is nothing special

# Says the man who thinks Crazy In Love is less than a 10

**MrSwearword** (4): it's not even in the Top 25 Britney songs in existence and is one of her most overrated songs. However, Peppermint slayed in the LSFTC and improved the score for this by at least three points.

"Reflection" may have been Christina's debut, but GIAB gave the world its first true glimpse at Xtina and I fall more in love with this song every time I hear it. Also, for Xtina's first rate on this site, I'd say she did pretty well, with her highest ranking song coming in with a 9.4 average!

**calltehshots** (10): Christina really came out swinging with this.

**MrSwearword** (10): a good debut but the best song to her name? NO. Still, a good debut that presented her as a version of Britney that can sing on and off the CD.

Our favorite scream queen of the pop world, Xtina's album is unfortunately the second to leave us in this rate. Suffering from a lacklustre 2nd half, the only real highlights lie in the early tracks. If you're interested in what she's up to these days, she will be releasing an album entitled *Liberation*, featuring songs such as "Accelerate", "Twice" and "Fall In Line".

---
**TragicKingdom1**: I think this album is consistently decent to good with a few absolute highlights. I don't have much else to say about it other than the fact that although not every songs sounds like it was written to match Christina's voice, it really elevates the more filler songs. Definitely check out the singles (although I'm not too high on two of them) and if you like those then the rest of the album won't be a waste of time. [Grade: B+]

**DraculaWeekend**: This album holds up pretty damn well compared to the others in the rate

Once this video dropped it was over for u hoes. Sadly it's also over for *NSYNC's bid at winning this rate. A 9.41 average is nothing to sneer at though, a duly formidable effort here from Justin, Lance, JC, Chris and Joey. One I will ALWAYS do the choreography to when I hear it!

# BOP BOP BOP

**1998tweety** (11): Wow this is a huge bop, iconic song, timeless.

**amumyspiritanimal** (10): almost my 11 but stronger is just obviously better

**bbfan132** (10): I love the puppet theme (and the metaphor for being freed from the vile Lou Pearlman), and the chorus is infectious and catchy. All of their voices a) sound good, b) sound different from each other, and c) work well together. The production is obviously excellent as well. Issa bop.

**calltehshots** (10): Instantly iconic and legendary and the music video invented that scene in Inception.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Justin when he went solo

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm just gonna call this their GOAT/peak track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): yay it's the boyband with one relevant guy and 4 other dudes. wait this isn't One Direction?

**rotating3Dtext** (9): savage

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Sorry but I've felt this was a bit overrated...JC does not sound good whatsoever on it. Obviously still a bop though lol.

What is there to say about *NSYNC other than, well… "I Want You Back"? If anything, the "filler" on this is actually kinda listenable, and there's some good party jams in this one as well, the titular track a true hidden gem. If you ask me, I'd much rather listen to this than Man of The Woods given the choice.

---
**TragicKingdom1**: This album might be Max Martin's peak. He really hooks you in on every song that he does. Although some songs blend together, you're never not enjoying it because you're bopping too hard. Not all of the credit goes to him, however: Justin and JC, the leaders of the group, REALLY go off here. I didn't watch any of the music videos from this album but I felt like I was because they brought so much charisma. I highly recommend this album to anyone who appreciates really well-written and performed bops. [Grade: A-]

**CreepyMannequin**: I honestly expected this to be bad after not listening to it in years, but I enjoyed this quite a bit. Ballads are still weak though.

**Banananaise**: i really didn't expect to like either of the boybands, but this is probably the best album out of the four. plenty of good bops, and the filler songs aren't too bad either

**DraculaWeekend**: This album is so much catchier than Millennium. Also, #justiceforJC

No song in this rate has had as much of a cultural impact as this one. It remains iconic, even 18 years after its initial release. No song deserves to win the rate more than this one. I have no intention to be convinced otherwise. Thankfully I won't have to be; this is the winning song in the Y2K Teen Pop Rate! And Britney has won her 3rd rate on r/popheads! Wanna make it 4? Do the Mid-00s Dancepop Comebacks rate!

# WE LOVE A CLASSIC POP TUNE

**calltehshots** (11): This song is perfect. Anyone who gave this less than a 10 made a choice. A wrong one. I've been gagging over this song for 18 years. The guy grabs the jewelry from Titanic out the ocean for her and she still doesn't give a shit?! Without being overdramatic, this is the most perfect song to ever exist and if it played at my funeral I would literally rise from the dead.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): iconic

**tevinterimperium** (11): This is such a classic. Giving it anything less than an 11 is blasphemous.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): she sent my wig to mars with her

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop. I love the triple chorus at the end though.

**amumyspiritanimal** (10): groundbreaking, showstopping, put it in a blender, etc.

**bbfan132** (10): This song will never get old. The interlude is iconic, the chorus is one of the catchiest of all time, and the production is excellent. Also, I love how Britney went from a sweet, innocent girl to a lady who doesn’t care about men at all in a year’s span. An easy 10 <3

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Iconic

**flickeredinmymind** (10): an eleven contender

**KarenTheCockpitPilot** (10): Oops!...I gave it a ten

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): queen of doing it again Robyn is shook

**MrSwearword** (10): don't let the horrendous LSFYL between Honey Mahogany and Vivienne Pinay fool you; this song fucking knocks

**poppinmmolly** (10): a classic for a reason

**Shipsinker22** (10): forever iconic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I mean... duh

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): a 10 without the interlude

**Banananaise** (8): this charted at 9??? beaten by such iconic songs as 'Everything You Want' by Vertical Horizon, 'Be With You' by Enrique Iglesias, 'Thong Song' by Sisquo, and at #1, 'Maria Maria' by Santana

twat_brained: # Oops!...I Did It Again

---

**Overall average**: 7.178

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/GLTQXeNB)

This album is literally iconic. Although it doesn't boast the sales of BOMT, the sexiness of ITZ or the cohesiveness and consistency of Blackout, it is a definite standout in Brit's discography and one worth checking out. Also worth checking out is Britney's 2018 theater tour! That is if tickets are still available.

---
**TragicKingdom1**: I have mixed feelings about this album. On one hand I feel like there is a lot of that delicious Y2K pop flavor in the mix here that satisfies me in the same way No Strings Attached did. But on some songs there's a lot of questionable decisions that hinder my enjoyment of those elements, usually in the production or songwriting. If you're a Britney fan I'm sure you'll enjoy this because she does bring her A-game, but I wish her songwriters and producers brought theirs more consistently. [Grade: B-]

**poppinmmolly**: my favorite album when I was about 7

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: oops!… I procrastinated on a rate again
