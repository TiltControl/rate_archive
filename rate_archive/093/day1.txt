**bespectacIed** (6): Hana, dul, set, BITCHES. The iconic solo of 2NE1’s leader, which was released through Scooter Braun’s School Boy Records,  is the first song out of the rate, and frankly, understandably so. It’s a pure hip-hop track with prominent horns and abrasive production, so we all know it’s not this sub’s type. RIP to the supposed Asian Bitches collab with M.I.A., that would have been a beautiful mess.


**agentofscranton** (5): 2NE1 leader and friend of Rihanna CL unfortunately takes the double loser crown as both the bottom of the bonus tracks and the lowest average in this rate overall with her debut track, Hello Bitches. For anyone turned off by Hello Bitches and CL's persona, I highly recommend the EP she released last year the minute she left YG, especially One and Only. A megabop.

#Got hella dough

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**sailormunelune** (10): my boys won’t hesitate to run up on your boys


**smile-on-crayon** (10): She's better on her own, honestly.


**alwayswords** (9.5): could mop jennie


**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): goodbye wig


**1998tweety** (9): Good thing this slaps cause the rest of her solo career is shit


**kwcty6888** (9): want me to love them long time and I tell them NO


**radiofan15** (8.6): Hey, how you doin?


**dynamicity** (8.5): Everyone gave this shit but honestly it hits hard.


**\_Doh\_** (8): CL is the only person who could do this song


**Agusarg** (8): She did what she had to do


**skargardin** (8): major bop alert


**2l82bstr8** (7.5): the closest CL's career ever came to actually working. it's corny af but unapologetically so, which helps


**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): she doesn’t know me, she doesn’t get to speak to me like this but points to her for repping for the Asian girls


**fadedblue09** (7.2): Sounds too much of a 2NE1 song to be distinctive.


**misconceptionsofyou** (7): again being nice


**taeneon** (7): the song alone kinda goes off but I find her persona kinda cringe and tryhard sorry


**wavingwolves** (7): some points were made but i don't agree with them


**Qustomar** (6.5): of its time


**fifteensunflwrs** (6): every. single. thing. about. this. godawful. song. SCREAMS 2015 TO ME and at the same time that I hate it, I also have a place for it in my heart


**untutorable** (6): i don't love it as much as everyone else does but it does go off a bit


#Got hella old


**cutefuss** (5.2): this song is...well it's a song but...i like all of cl's post-yg solo releases so far MUCH more than anything she put out while under yg.


**hiramutsu** (5): Really not my cup of tea


**heeyeon** (3): this is bad meaning bad you know


**selegend** (3): shes so tacky fksldsdl


**gabcac** (1): why did You do that, CL. Why?

**agentofscranton** (9): I really did NOT think that this song would be so generally disliked. I absolutely love that chorus - la la ireoke cha, cha cha ro AH! pops into my head literally every hour of the day. In the grand scheme of f(x)'s discography, it evidently pales in comparison, but I can't help but harbour a little soft spot for f(x)'s annoying little debut track.


**bespectacIed** (3): One of SM Ent’s boldest and ultimately best business decisions was to debut a new, musically edgier girl group half the size of their current monster girl group (and ofc, including the much anticipated younger Jung sister!). This song was a cute electropop hit to pass time with, but in the grand scheme of k-pop, this song to me is pretty forgettable and grating. LA chA TA never left the bottomest of the bottom of this rate, and honestly I can’t blame y’all. I am glad that their debut is one of their worst tracks because we all know how fantastic the rest of their discography is.


---

#Say it with me now - LA chA TA TA

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): ugh this r&b-tinged bop is just so fun. like it's nowhere near their best (wouldn't even put it in their top 25 overall songs) but it just slaps


**Shinkopeshon** (8.6): It's bittersweet to hear the songs and watch the MVs with Sulli. These are all really good songs and wonderful MVs and to see her shine so brightly here while knowing what'd happen a few years later breaks my heart.


**twat\_brained** (8.4): It says it’s from over 10 years ago and it certainly sounds like it


**2l82bstr8** (8): it's aged rather poorly but it's still a great debut and an early indicator of the path they'd follow. it almost feels like a female predecessor to SHINee's Lucifer


**Agusarg** (8): Their first single, it's a really good song but it doesn't show the level they would reach


**heeyeon** (8): not their strongest showing but gets an extra point for this iconic performance: [https://youtu.be/PhXk3PQDxiM](https://youtu.be/PhXk3PQDxiM)


**JohnnyToby** (8): the most boring P101 performance...sorry doyeon


**Qwilphish** (8): so fun it brings a smile to my face


**sarcasticsobs** (8): really like the choreo for this


**fadedblue09** (7.7): Quite subtle and video game-ish but still fun. It's mostly the production keeping my interest here.


**Qustomar** (7.5): i rlly like this mainly for the industrial vibes, otherwise it's just ok


**rickikardashian** (7): why is one of them dressed like the most stereotypical lesbian


**untutorable** (7): they're literal children here and they're STILL serving this hard?? i love these gals


**radiofan15** (6.6): No one knows that it means, but it's provocative....


**1998tweety** (6.5): it's alright


**AnimationJava** (6.5): The opening of this song was pretty good! Honestly a solid debut song, especially considering it was 2009.


**Maybe9** (6): zzzz

#Stream LATATA instead

**sailormunelune** (6): a dull debut tbh


**dynamicity** (5): I like to pretend this one doesn't exist.


**Ghost-Quartet** (5): A decent but painfully unremarkable debut


**MrSwearword** (5): peppy but boring


**taeneon** (5): cute but nothing special


**wavingwolves** (5): the title of this song translated is kind of "the boring girl" and sends me even if in the song it isn't supposed to mean anything


**cutefuss** (0): this song is horrendous, i don't expect many people to agree with me, but here's my zero. i've always thought f(x) deserved so much better for a debut song.

**Highest scores:**


(10 x4) fifteensunflwrs, JohnnyToby, rslashpoopheads, twat\_brained

---


**bespectacIed** (8): This song stayed at the bottom for the most part of the rate. I’ve never expected that a clubby, eurodance (ish) bop like So Cool will be a very early exit in the rate, but here we are. Yeah it's a repetitive and mindless bop, but we're in a fucking pop sub, we should be celebrating this type of shit!!!!  Brave Sound really just dominated 2nd Gen; the amount of iconic hits that has his signature is kinda astounding, and So Cool is one of his most iconic work. So Cool is the title track of Sistar’s debut album, and they truly shook the game with this confection by being the first of the unprecedented **NINE** consecutive number 1s Sistar had in the Gaon Charts. Like, I know Sistar was massive, but I can’t even wrap my head around that record. Oh well :shrug: some songs just have to go out early i guess


**agentofscranton** (6): Poor So Cool, though it was coming second to last anyway for most of the rate, as the voting period drew to a close, the now #61 song just managed to outpace it by a mere 0.8 points. So Cool, like many early singles featured in this rate, suffers as a result of just how generic it is. However, I'd be lying if I said that was a problem for me. I eat that shit up like cereal. The Brave Brothers do be sounding like Pitbull though.


---

#Cool

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): so many elements of this song has aged terribly (especially every single brave brothers adlib) but I love this song too much to care


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**twat\_brained** (10): now this… this is how you grab the public's attention right from the start.


**dlong5665** (9): when dasom said “...” i felt that



**fadedblue09** (8.5): It's cool indeed.


**wavingwolves** (8.5): brave sound made a lot of points here... also this song sends me so much because ''cu'' in portuguese is a slang for asshole (as in the actual hole) and when they sing cUuUuUu and do the ass coreography thing it's so hilarious


**dynamicity** (8): The intro to this song sounds so fucking amazing and I wish the rest of the song sounded like it too.


**MrSwearword** (8): great beat but the act isn't living up to it


**selegend** (8): BRAVE SOUND DROP IT

# Good in Bed and Boys Will Be Boys

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): this song is… very 2011


**1998tweety** (6.5): Meh


**Maybe9** (6.5): this production is chaotic, but its a good song



**untutorable** (6.5): one of my least favorite sistar tracks idk why it just doesn't stick with me!!


**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): meh


**franch** (6): the guy singing is such a weird interjection


**Qwilphish** (6): it bops, but it gives me nothing outside of that


**smile-on-crayon** (6): Was the first Kpop songs that I have ever seen. Glad I gave another chance to the genre after listening to another song, because, if I hadn't, my judgement would have been solely on hearing "So Cool" and it wouldn't have kept me, and I would have escaped Kpop's clutches.


**2l82bstr8** (5): it's easy to see why they didn't go in this direction more often, this is just obnoxiously clubby. they were capable of much better.


**Ghost-Quartet** (4): you’re not as cool as you think you are


**cutefuss** (1.5): you know the video of the guy at who can see the cat through the store's glass wall and he's like "I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT OF THERE"? that's me to sistar when listening to this song. it's gonna be okay girls better days are coming.

#MR. WORLDWIDE

**radiofan15** (8.6): Is that Pitbull doing the adlibs?

**nowqueenofpop** (6.5): Brave brothers was all over every single girl group title track between 2011 and 2014 he’s the korean pitbull

**sarcasticsobs** (3): the only thing i remember is the discount pitbull

**bespectacIed** (10): Queen of blood-typing! f(x) tapped into South Korea's culture of blood type personality classification to give us this EDM bop, which became their first Korean number 1. I am not surprised that this went early in the rate because it sounds very much like a product of its time, but damn iu, Nu ABO is one of my favorite f(x) songs ever. I am in love with the chaotic vibe of this song and its video. The campy dance moves? The fashion? Luna’s bridge? Krystal's chunky bumblebee dye job??? I never had high hopes for Nu ABO’s ranking because I know my obsession with it is not natural but, damn it I love this song. Nananananananana NU ABO, forever.


**agentofscranton** (5): And so f(x) becomes the first group to lose two songs! Our third casualty is their first number one single, Nu ABO. Which I only found out is actually related to blood typing, thanks to this rate! The more you know! Aside from the chorus there isn't much that I care for in this song, and evidently you all found it hard to do the same.


---

#THIS TEA

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Hands down favorite F(x) song, this was their peak and nobody can convince me otherwise, they never put out a song as gooood as Nu'ABO

#Mysteric


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**Agusarg** (9): Such a banger, has their signature agressive electronic sound.


**cutefuss** (8.7): NOW HERE'S A SONG! THIS IS F(X) HONEY! the 'yeah! yeah!' chanting part is the reason the score isn't higher, though.


**heeyeon** (8): only f(x) could pull off a song like this and actually make it listenable


**sarcasticsobs** (8): f(x) has a lot of killer choruses is what i’m picking up


**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this one has always just kinda been okay


**misconceptionsofyou** (7): never really like it tbh


**untutorable** (7): some people will tell you this aged like milk but it actually invented music so try again


**Unprettiest** (6.7): the chaotic fashion gets an 8 from me


**dynamicity** (6.5): I used to love this but it really hasn't aged well.


**fadedblue09** (6.5): A bit too repetitive and noisy. Some of the background effects were distracting.


**radiofan15** (6.3): This moves at the pace of a snail... please DO SOMETHING


**1998tweety** (6): no thank you


**Qwilphish** (6): its iconic but its still a 6 oop

#Hysteric

**twat\_brained** (5.6): goodness me, this is like completely antithetical to what made La Cha Ta age so well


**rickikardashian** (5.5): “eat your coochie”


**2l82bstr8** (5): it's just trying to sound like a heavier 2NE1 but it's just headache inducing. the bridge saves it from being a total mess.


**franch** (5): is this annoying or fun? i'm thinking annoying.


**Maybe9** (5): they tried


**taeneon** (3): the song is actually okay but the styling is so horrific I wish the whole song didn't exist


**wavingwolves** (3): nu abo??? more like NO abo! and i don't want to talk about it. also i kind of hate this


**Ghost-Quartet** (2): There are a lot of f(x) songs I really like but this isn’t one of them.


**MrSwearword** (1): nope. just a flat out NOPE


**alwayswords** (0): I have information that could lead to the arrest of Amber Liu.

**bespectacIed** (4): Can I just say how “To Anyone” is the best album name ever??? Their minds! Anyways, I can’t blame anybody for cutting Can’t Nobody this early. The title track of 2NE1’s debut album is an amalgam of every cliche sound and visual of 2010s EDM, plus that “i’m so hood” line is a bit … hmmm, laughable is the kindest word I could think of. It has a cute beat, but we’re glad that 2NE1 has better songs out there


**agentofscranton** (3): So we say adios to our first 2NE1 song! And thank god. This song is so annoying, the best part is the first 12 seconds before it just becomes a racket. Honestly if anything this placed too high. It also has the distinction of never leaving the bottom 5 of the rate! Poor it.


---

# I'm so good good

**dynamicity** (10): My personal favorite 2NE1 song, and endless progression of hooks that perfectly embodies their effortless, quirky electropop.


**JohnnyToby** (10): This would be my eleven if it weren't for five other songs


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**waluigiest** (10): in my early high school tumblr days, 2NE1 crossed into my sphere and I actually had this song on my iPod (I have never been a major Kpop listener)


**twat\_brained** (9.1): this is like if Far East Movement were convincingly Far Eastern popstars. Why didn't we replace them with these talented ladies? I wish I'd stanned them


**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): this one is so fun but it falls juuuust a bit flat compared to some of their other bangers


**sarcasticsobs** (8): oh no CL not the scene raccoon hair in the video. again with the less-than-ideal autotune, i just personally do not like it


**radiofan15** (7.6): Sounds dated... but in the best sense of the word


**Maybe9** (7.5): the production is alot, but its a bop


**untutorable** (7.5): fire's older sister! the same 2ne1 you know and love with that extra bit of polish. also can we please talk about cl's scene girl hair in this music video i'm OBSESSED


**wavingwolves** (7): this song is itzy's blueprint


**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This sounds like something from a Nickelodeon show (not an insult) but with weaker vocals.


**Qustomar** (6.5): this one did not age well, it's another trashy electropop song but way more of a slog to listen to


**Qwilphish** (6.5): Jennie on the tank outsold CL with the ambulance


**\_Doh\_** (6): I've never been a big fan of the heavy autotune style


**AnimationJava** (6): Reminds me of the early 2010s pop that popheads dies for


**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): ok this can be a guilty pleasure

#Yeah I'm so bad bad

**1998tweety** (5): No this also ain't good


**MrSwearword** (5): commitment to the trashy sound of that time is to be commended but in their case...it doesn't work that well


**2l82bstr8** (4.5): oof this is not for me at all. the aggressive AutoTune feels really messy, the melody is super weird, and the vocal performance and mixing really sells the girls short here. what saves it from going lower is the beautiful outro, I wish the whole song was more like that


**therokinrolla** (4): garbaj


**fadedblue09** (3.8): Awful vocal production.


**taeneon** (3): kinda a mess

**bespectacIed** (8): Popheads really said “Get 2NE1 the fuck outta here.” The long awaited solo comeback from 2NE1’s main vocalist gave us serious nostalgia. Spring sounds like a refined RnB ballad from 2NE1’s heydays, with Dara’s vocal/rap verse as icing on the cake. Unfortunately y’all didn’t care for it much because you can’t pop ass to it


**agentofscranton** (6): Popheads really said fuck Blackjack rights huh? Spring is Bom's comeback single after signing with D Nation, and recruited fellow 2NE1er and non-Filipino Filipino icon Sandara Park, and really brought dedicated fans right back to 2NE1's heyday with a cute little R&B ballad. It's very clear from Bom's stint on Queendom that she desperately misses performing with her 2NE1 sisters so I'm glad she at least had this. Now, free yourself from YG Dara so you can formally reunite as a group!


---


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**wavingwolves** (10): a perfect comeback and a perfect spring song


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I don’t like Bom’s voice but this is a good song, thanks to the parts that aren’t her like the arrangement and the choral backing


**\_Doh\_** (8): 2ne1 deserved better


**Qwilphish** (8): bom deserves the world.


**smile-on-crayon** (8): Damn, I was not expecting a chill vibe to this. I thought it was going to be a ballad from the thumbnail. I can see Beyoncé lovers in Kpop bopping to this.


**fadedblue09** (7.8): Cute R&B bop but a bit generic.


**AnimationJava** (7.5): A pretty and well-produced track, surprisingly more mellow than I thought it was going to be!


**1998tweety** (7): Meh, her song with Wheein outsold


**Qustomar** (7): mariah vibez


**ryokann** (7): dara's verse really makes this song


**cutefuss** (6.5): after everything bom has been through this song packs an emotional punch. too bad it's otherwise generic.


**untutorable** (6.5): can we talk about how dara hasn't aged a fucking day since debut? girl holy shit


**MrSwearword** (6): I'm just not sold here


**sarcasticsobs** (6): dara


**2l82bstr8** (5): it feels like every part of this song is working towards being as generic as possible despite not being that?? at least Dara kills it ig


**dynamicity** (4): Honestly this is just cacophonous. Definitely my least favorite of her solo discography.


**radiofan15** (3.5): Please...no...

**bespectacIed** (9): In my opinion, only a Filipino would truly understand how massive and viral this song is lol. This song was Gangnam Style/ Bboom Bboom levels of viral in Southeast Asia. This song gives me pure buzz, and the line “meoributeo balkkeutkkaji Hot Issue, ho!” activates my faggot microchip. Iconic as it is, I understand why this was cut early. 4Minute’s debut was a run-of-the-mill EDM k-pop song not unlike of the thousands of songs released that year. Nonetheless, I know Hot Issue still stole many wigs from poor k-pop fans … that includes 10-year-old me who didn’t understand k-pop yet.


**agentofscranton** (6): Our first 4Minute cut is their debut title Hot Issue! Is it generic? Sure. Is it basically HyunA and Jiyoon and friends? Absolutely. Is it kinda tacky? Hell yeah. But I can't deny how much my body bops to that chorus, and I'm always a slut for counting in songs.

# hot stuff

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**sarcasticsobs** (10): S-tier chorus, jesus


**fadedblue09** (9): Solid banging chorus, Also, wow, I had no idea this was from 2009?


**sailormunelune** (9): Girls, you ready? Let’s go


**wavingwolves** (9): no words needed because this is perfection


**JohnnyToby** (8.5): Han Hyeri and that one girl that raised her shirt really deserved


**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): ho anthem but it gets repetitive


**dynamicity** (8): An unforgettable hook on an otherwise mediocre electropop song.


**Qustomar** (8): it's just one of the several generic but fun electropop songs in this rate


**twat\_brained** (7.3): so this sounds like a bootleg Boom Boom Pow but I'm not sure if this is an improvement or a downgrade. I could certainly get used to it


**2l82bstr8** (7): it's fun, but it doesn't have much in the way of replay value. (and who tf dances with a whole ass backpack???)


**AnimationJava** (7): Albeit dated, the song is fun! I liked the mini beat breakdowns that reminded me a bit of Charli XCX.


**nowqueenofpop** (7): [korean korean] HOT ISSUE

# hot mess

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.3): Wow we really did just like… abandon this style of music entirely didn’t we? We just didn’t look back.


**1998tweety** (6): The production bops but their voices are so annoying


**untutorable** (6): i'm ready for this song to get fucking destroyed but it's iconic in its own way and honestly i still find it really catchy?? the production is dated tho there is no denying it


**MrSwearword** (5): the hook is fine but the rest of the song falls short


**rotating3Dtext** (5): the video is in 360p lmaoooooo


**cutefuss** (3.4): god early 4minute is hard to listen to


**Qwilphish** (2): There is nothing here for me HyunA sweetie Im so sorry

**agentofscranton** (6): JYP's original girl group Wonder Girls lose their first song and it comes in the form of Regina George anthem So Hot. I think my enjoyment of So Hot massively suffers as a result of how much I enjoy the covers. Not just the superior BLACKPINK remix, but also (clock the flair) the Music Bank TWICE Special Stage. I still enjoy how cunty the song is, and obviously Yubin's verse is killer, but it just isn't my favourite.


**bespectacIed** (5): An early out at this rate. It doesn’t help that Wonder Girls’ earliest videos on YouTube seemed like they were filmed by a potato, but So Hot really suffers from its dated sound and uninteresting production. As always, Yubin’s rap is a serve though.


---


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**wavingwolves** (10): this song was covered pretty endlessly but nothing comes close to the original



**2l82bstr8** (8): such a cute little throwback song. it doesn't really go anywhere but I feel like that's all you need with this song. such a shopping montage number.


**dynamicity** (8): Tell me but better.


**twat\_brained** (8): Seems at this point they were still taking inspiration from acts like Sugababes and Danity Kane.


**radiofan15** (7.6): My bf though I was listening to p*rn for some reason while rating this song...


**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): they said pretty people privileges!!


**\_Doh\_** (6): I wish I had this much self-confidence


**Ghost-Quartet** (6): maybe not as hot as you think you are


**MrSwearword** (6): it's not bad but this is just blase


**Qwilphish** (6): take off a point for sounding dusty as hell


**sarcasticsobs** (6): i literally did not like it until the rap verse


**smile-on-crayon** (6): JYP adlibs, can you go die pleeease? This will probably be the tenth song in that playlist I mentioned above.


**cloudbustingmp3** (5.3): okay this has never done anything for me tbh im sorry


**selegend** (5): this isn’t really that good


**Maybe9** (4): dusty, this song gave me allergies


**taeneon** (4): idk just kind of boring


**fadedblue09** (3): Caroline Polachek remains unbothered. Rap verse brought some energy to this.

**Shinkopeshon** (9.5): A song so iconic, it still gets covered all the time. Admittedly, TWICE and BLACKPINK's renditions actually made me appreciate the original more because I wasn't the biggest fan of it at first.

#Blackpink 1st full-length album September 2020!!!

**AnimationJava** (10): I will admit that the BLACKPINK cover of this song is what originally got me into it, but even disregarding that this song is still insanely cool! It's one of the biggest predecessors of our modern idea of girl crush, they're confident and tough and empowered and I love it!


**alwayswords** (8): blackpink did it better


**1998tweety** (6): BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA, never thought I'd say it but BP did it much better.


**therokinrolla** (5): not even a blackpink cover could save this

**bespectacIed** (10): What can I say, r/popheads is apparently full of dependent ladies who DO need a man. Y'all had no time for this track at all. It's kinda generic, basic, and hypocritical because this song was literally written and produced by one man, but this still is one of my favorite miss A songs!!! Damn if this song and its MV aren't fun as heck. We love independent women!


**agentofscranton** (7.5): miss A singing a song about not needing a man and having it all be made by one man name a bigger scam. Popheads evidently doesn't support the feminist message of this song because y'all constantly had it wallowing down in the bottom 10 songs, at least it's still it's third highest peak? There's that? It's painfully generic and the song doesn't really go anywhere, but hell I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having fun.

#Destiny's Child - Independent Women (Part II)

**fadedblue09** (10): Cute bop. Gives me Little Mix vibes, but these girls did it waaaayyy better.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Icon of Strong Independant Women


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**wavingwolves** (10): ended the pussycat dolls


**radiofan15** (9.5): We unfortunately need them... they're the worst tho...


**heeyeon** (9): queens of feminism


**smile-on-crayon** (9): Chanting aside (it's a small part to the song, whew), I feel like there should be a Lil Yachty verse in this song.


**gabcac** (8.7): for all the independent women


**rickikardashian** (8.5): i know i have heard the melody of the chorus in another song and i can't tell you which one it is


**Shinkopeshon** (8.5): miss A have such a great and empowering message and I'm glad similar messages are still prevalent in the groups that followed them.


**twat\_brained** (8.4): men ain't shit! Fuck super junior! Fuck shinee! Fuck EXO!!!


**2l82bstr8** (8): such an adorable display of self-confidence. there's something ironic about bragging about financial independent while being elbow-deep in debt to your entertainment company, but issa cute bop okay


**Maybe9** (8): #feminism


**Qwilphish** (8): this is very cute sounding and of course the message is something great and especially for them making this in 2012


**sarcasticsobs** (8): adorable


**1998tweety** (7.5): Bops a fair bit


**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): something fun something for the summertime something for the girls to you know get ready and party to


**AnimationJava** (7): We love a strong and empowering feminist message.

**agentofscranton** (10): And so we say goodbye to both our first T-ara song, and our first song to have peaked within Day 3! This song is admittedly annoying as hell, but it's the kind of kitschy, campy offering that I just love getting from k-pop so I'm disappointed to see such an iconic song fall in the first day.


**bespectacIed** (10): There are few songs in this rate that caused as much ruckus as the iconic Bo Peep Bo Peep. Seriously, not one soul in the conservative Korea wasn’t shook by its risque music video, not to mention that iconic “FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME” hook lmaooo. T-ara cemented themselves as one of the top new GGs with this hit, and they went on to reach higher heights after this. Also, BPBP is interestingly the first ever song from a korean group to debut at number 1 in Japan. T-ara are queens, period.

**2l82bstr8** (6): this is genuinely hilarious to me, but once you hear the first minute, you've basically heard the whole song, which is a shame

**bespectacIed** (8): Way before Jennie and her diamond-encrusted tank in DDDD, f(x) gave us a pink striped tank in the middle of the road with Hot Summer. This song is one of f(x)’s biggest hits and imo their most visually appealing video: the colors and sets are just gorgeous, and the way this MV was lit reminds me of the glare of the summer midafternoon sun. Yeah it’s a song with basically two words imposed in a generic EDM beat, but mindless bops are essential to our survival as a species.


**agentofscranton** (7): As I type this I am currently sweating my ass off trapped indoors so maybe that informs my not fantastic score for the song. There's not really much to say about this song. It's got a very cute video, and that chorus - well I was gonna say goes off but it's just kinda there, like the rest of the song. Also, apparently this is straight up just a cover of a German song of the same name. Invented recycling.

**Qustomar** (9.5): more industrial vibes but made into a summer banger wow, what a concept


**2l82bstr8** (8.5): this doesn't really go anywhere, but it's an absolute banger regardless. I love the bassline here, really sets it apart from just another summer song


**Shinkopeshon** (8.5): When the chorus hit, I had to laugh so fucking hard - because that's when I realized this was in fact a cover of a hit single by German girl group Monrose from the late 00s. And f(x) made the song so much better too. All of this is so fucking random lmao


**fadedblue09** (8): Solid banging production but the chorus felt like it stayed in one lane or something.

**bespectacIed** (10): Ahhh Loving U, probably the turning point of Sistar’s career, where they established themselves as the Queens of Summer --- a title that will still be attached to them years after their disbandment. Loving U saw Hyolyn, Bora, Soyou and Dasom on skimpy, sailor fits frolicking in a fun, colorful dance-pop track, living their best life, while we fans live precariously in Sistar’s forever-summer videos. This song exudes so much lightness, youth and romance like a summer afternoon beach-side party, I love it so much. L.O, L.O, L.O.V.E., I only think about ~~youuu~~ Sistar being in our lives again :(


**agentofscranton** (9): popheads had absolutely no time for Loving U and it's cute, summer-y ways, seeing as it's been stuck in the bottom 10 for the last 85 or so voters. I adore this song. This was one of two songs I hadn't actually heard prior to this rate, but I'm glad to have discovered it! Nobody quite does summer like SISTAR.

**agentofscranton** (5): So we bid farewell to our first Girls' Generation song, and it comes in the form of the diabetes-inducingly sweet Lion Heart. I wish I could say some piece about how y'all are tasteless about this, but I don't care enough about it. The best-selling song from their 5th album of the same name, despite peaking at 4 while the worse Party topped Gaon (You Think is better than both), this is also the only Girls' Generation song in the rate to never reach the top 40 during the duration of the rate. Poor it.


**bespectacIed** (4): We chose the title track from the three official singles released in the Lion Heart era for this rate, because, well, duh (but the tea is You Think >>>>>> Lion Heart > Party ).To be honest, this is one of my least favorite SNSD title tracks; while the 1950s aesthetics are on point, their foray into jazz felt too contrived and half-assed to me. It's a fun track while reminiscing about all the lying/lion bastards that broke our hearts, but it's not enough to escape Day 1.


---


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**twat\_brained** (10): ended men and their so-called "lionhearts". It also just made me realize how pointless the term "lionheart" is


**AnimationJava** (9): Very pretty vocals, catchy melodies, and good visuals in the MV! This is peak SNSD folks, the girl group of the nation have forever left their insurmountable legacy on kpop.


**hiramutsu** (9): Favorite recent-ish SNSD song


**Maybe9** (9): high bubble pop, summer pop, pop pop, its everything


**taeneon** (9): i hated this when it came out but it's actually super cute and catchy


**radiofan15** (8.9): OMG they didn't have to come for Meghan Trainor like that!


**Shinkopeshon** (8.6): This song is a bop but I really miss Jessica here, who instantly became my favorite.


**1998tweety** (8.5): I mean...she's cute. The gag when SNSD's scraps are better than the other girlies' highlights.


**untutorable** (8.5): people are gonna shit on this one but it's GOOD! ladies y'all know what i'm talking about right?


**cutefuss** (8.1): as a lion heart apologist, i'm just gonna leave this rate here


**2l82bstr8** (8): adorable throwback song. lyrics are extremely problematic


**nowqueenofpop** (8): A vocal showcase


**smile-on-crayon** (8): Glossy MV


**waluigiest** (8): I’m telling my kids this was meghan trainor


**dynamicity** (7): I liked it at first but honestly this is really bland for SNSD.


**misconceptionsofyou** (7): also being nice


**fadedblue09** (6.5): A bit forgettable but at least it's not grating. And I'm glad that electropop phase is over.


**JohnnyToby** (6.5): I hate cute songs and this is is righttt on the verge of being too much


**letsallpoo** (6): stream treat myself


**MrSwearword** (5): blurgh at the cutesy shit, but this sort of doo-wop/Meghan Trainor at her relevance sound isn't bad for them


**\_Doh\_** (2): I hate that I can't like this song


**cloudbustingmp3** (1.3): shart is more like it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): a furry anthem

**Qwilphish** (8): invented bestiality

**wavingwolves** (8): **they truly said furry rights with this one... but i would do the guy on the lion fursuit too so i don't blame them**

**bespectacIed** (10): Basing from the k-pop taste of international fans and from the results of the last k-pop rate, unabashedly cute concepts don’t do well so much (except if you’re Twice ofc). That notion seems to carry over to this rate, because NoNoNo is as cutesy as k-pop gets and almost never left Day 1 …. yet I fucking love this!!! It’s sugary sweet in the best way, but the electronic beat intercutting with the girly verses and chorus just add so much flavor to this song. This song is also one of the most covered songs for k-pop idols so imagine how many times I've watched this on survival/reality shows. I normally don’t like super cheesy concepts but NoNoNo is one of the few exceptions


**agentofscranton** (7): Something which is now obvious is that poopheads is not a fan of cute and pure concepts - GFriend was one of the first girl groups to fall last k-pop rate, as well as TWICE's more sugary sweet offerings, and now NoNoNo follows fellow cute concept songs Lion Heart and Loving U in getting cut by the anti-cute agenda. What else will follow? To be honest, NoNoNo is a cute girl but doesn't really do anything for me in comparison to Apink's other offerings in the rate, but considering their other offerings NoNoNo was never gonna be able to compete.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’m such a sucker for a cute concept, on all levels except physical I am a schoolgirl with a crush


**1998tweety** (8.5): She's cute


**radiofan15** (8.4): This sounds so early 00s... and I'm OK with that...


**Shinkopeshon** (8.4): I'm already familiar with Apink and admittedly am not the biggest fan of their overall sound. However, they do have their fair share of quality tracks and this is one of them.


**2l82bstr8** (8): it's the kind of spring 90's influenced cute anthem that's really popular in k-pop. it's adorable, but it grates after a while.


**dynamicity** (8): Honestly the flagship song of the second wave of cute kpop.


**twat\_brained** (8): this is adorable!


**Unprettiest** (8): love those synths, the spirit of 2000s KARA lives on


**wavingwolves** (8): dare i say... yes yes yes


#Red lip? Earrings? High heel? Handbag?

**Agusarg** (7): It's cute, nothing special


**fadedblue09** (7): Cute bet the verses are very forgettable.


**rotating3Dtext** (7): cute


**sarcasticsobs** (7): verses didn’t match up to the chorus for me


**cloudbustingmp3** (6): it's cute but they've grown so much


**untutorable** (5.5): classic girly fun apink bop though i have to admit it doesn't do much for me beyond the catchy chorus......


**Qwilphish** (5): Only for the post chorus instrumental which is really good compared to the rest of this


**cutefuss** (4.2): ironically i own this album.


**Maybe9** (3): disney channel is so tired


**Qustomar** (3): this hurts to listen to honestly, it's too high pitched and saccharine for me and not in an extreme and enjoyable way for me


**dlong5665** (2): nonono is right yikes

#buddies get their asses!

**JohnnyToby** (2): oh god they led the path for gfriend

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite 2NE1 songs!!! You listen to Blackpink ballad b-sides like Stay and Hope Not and cannot help but think that they’re really following a blueprint. Lonely is a change of pace for the high octane EDM queens, giving us a simple country-tinged acoustic single. I love the sentimentality of this song, it didn’t try top hard to be sappy, it’s just a simple, heartfelt ode to loneliness. The completely glammed up girls at the peak of their popularity singing about inadequacy has such a Britney Spears - Everytime vibe. It reminds me of the hollowness of the k-pop industry behind all of its glamour. I might be reading too much out of it, but I really love this song, and I’m sad it went too early.


**agentofscranton** (7): Considering Stay was the first elimination in the first k-pop rate and poopheads' general hatred for anything they can't pop their bussies to in the club, I'm honestly surprised this song managed to escape the bottom 10 - especially seeing as it was flip flopping between last and second to last for the very early days of the rate. It didn't escape it by much but still. Honestly it's a great and welcome little departure from 2NE1's usual output.


---


**AnimationJava** (10): I think YG groups often excel in their ballads, and the worst crime of this rate's selection of 2NE1's discography was the exclusion of It Hurts (their crown jewel).


**MrSwearword** (10): I'm living for KPOP balladry here


**NuneEtsuko** (10): It's been a long time since I listened to KPOP but hearing this has as much effect as the first time and somehow I can still sing along.


**Qwilphish** (10): *deep voice* my loneliness is killing me


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**2l82bstr8** (9): not much to say about the song, it's lovely with the quiet violins in the back, but I really like the message - it basically talks about depression and feeling lonely even when in a stable, loving relationship. I don't remember seeing many people tackle this particular issue in this way before or since


**Ghost-Quartet** (9): i’m not crying but like also i’m crying


**hiramutsu** (9): Despite not liking their music style, this song is great


**Maybe9** (9): we love a ballad


**wavingwolves** (8): this is blackpink's stay older and hotter sister


**1998tweety** (7): This is kind of cute, I like the chorus


**sarcasticsobs** (7): good not great


**skargardin** (7): Cute moment


**untutorable** (7): a slow jam so it'll probably go out early but it really is such a pretty song and we love a versatile group


**cloudbustingmp3** (6): listen i LOVE ballads but this one has always just kinda been there. it's just not where they shone as a group


**dynamicity** (6): A rare ballad from 2NE1, and like with most of their slower songs, I think it lacks what really makes them unique.


**nowqueenofpop** (5): I could easily see bp singing this and it’s because this is def the song YG used to show them how they’re supposed to sing when they were training


**alwayswords** (4.5): acoustic songs from yg groups :sleeping_accomodation:


**twat\_brained** (4): this will be the lonely day 1 2ne1 song


**Qustomar** (3.5): giant snoozefest which got redone by teddy as stay


**radiofan15** (3.5): Everyone wants their Bebe Reptar moment... not everyone can get it

#well guess what mimi


**fadedblue09** (8): No ballad slander in this rate pls.

**bespectacIed** (9): Wonder Girls’ breakthrough hit!!! This is WG’s first title track after the very short-lived stint of Hyuna in the group. Every video I’ve seen of Tell Me is so LQ that I can’t help to feel underwhelmed, and the song sounding like a generic 1st Gen track adds to its dated quality, but it's such a a cute legacy bop!!! This song just fills me with so much nostalgia from an era of k-pop I’ve never experienced.


**agentofscranton** (8): Gal Gadot who? The only Wonder Women I recognize is Sohee. I love this in all it's cheesy 80s inspired glory. As is often the case with Wonder Girls songs, Yubin's rap is the highlight. I should've rated this higher teebs, there are plenty of songs above it that I'd rather it place higher than.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): that subtle Two of Hearts sample is just genius


**Qustomar** (9.5): so europop it's intense


**radiofan15** (8.6): The Blackout influence is strong in this one


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Like the song but the actual recording leaves something to be desired, their voices sound so thin?


**hiramutsu** (8): My first Kpop song


**therokinrolla** (8): Tell Me is kinda a classic, even if it was made in the scary Early Period of Wonder Girls. I prefer the rap version with queen Yubin, but this is a serve enough as well


**untutorable** (8): A CLASSIC


**twat\_brained** (7.6): It’s pretty evident this was Kpop before it was, well, the kpop we know and love today. It’s still fun, but it’s in too much of an infancy at this point.


**2l82bstr8** (7): it's adorable but that bridge with the sampling is so weird lol


**skargardin** (7): go off queens


**1998tweety** (6.5): This is annoying, sorry


**Maybe9** (6.5): its boring, but the production is good


**dynamicity** (6): Honestly kinda boring.


**rickikardashian** (6): tag yourself im the 50$ budget for the music video


**smile-on-crayon** (6): Years from now there'll be a YouTube stream of modern retro sounding Kpop songs. This will be, like, the fourth song to be played.


**cutefuss** (3.1): this song went viral and i get why, it's undeniably catchy. but the vocals in this song kill me in a bad way so i generally find it painful to listen to.


**Qwilphish** (3): very one note


**fadedblue09** (1): Too many weird noises, very repetitive, and overall very lazy. Why did this feel like it took forever to end??

**agentofscranton** (10): Our second Apink song to fall is saccharine megabop Mr. Chu, and may I be the first to say: ROBBED! I can accept Mr. Chu not being better than ISS and Eung Eung (which, duh, few songs are), but this did not deserve to die Day 1. Mr. Chu is one of the best songs the cute concept has to offer, and dare I say, it's production is almost as good as post-maturity Apink's titles.


**bespectacIed** (8): It’s always such a blast to listen to Apink because of the great distinction between their change of image/concept. Mr. Chu is one of their biggest hits that embody their cute, teenpop concept. There’s just enough disco tinge and 90s nostalgia to this song to make it interesting, but it is a little too sweet to my liking … and to y’all, apparently. Still a bop though! That dual chorus is forged by angels.


---


**DaBigBoi** (10): Underrated classic


**dynamicity** (10): A perfection of all the things that made NoNoNo a hit.


**Ghost-Quartet** (10): You can’t win rates if you ain’t cute! I’m not sure at what age it becomes weird for me to be listening to songs like this (I’m 23 now so I’m inching towards it) but if it helps make it less creepy, I’m not pretending that the girls are singing to me, I’m pretending that I’m one of them. Wait…


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**selegend** (10): kinda on the same level of perfection as i’m so sick and eung eung


**taeneon** (10): bubblegum pop at its finest imo


**wavingwolves** (10): god i miss a good cute concept this song is EVERYTHING


**2l82bstr8** (9): out of all of their pre-I'm-So-Sick songs, I think this one's the best representation of their whole concept. it's fun, bouncy, airy and modern, you can dance AND swoon to it.


**Qustomar** (9): cutesy pop perfection yup


**fadedblue09** (8.5): Solid bubblegum pop number with vocals.

**radiofan15** (7.5): Bless you

**Qwilphish** (6): INFINITE ENERGY BALLS


**untutorable** (6): another great and catchy chorus!! but the verses feel a little detached from it idk

**bespectacIed** (9): Wonder Girls’ highest selling song (according to Gaon) is just a damn irresistible and cute retro bop. The synths are so fucking infectious, the chorus so charming, the choreo is kinda the epitome of “go girl, give us nothing”, but who cares when the song is a giant bop. Truly one of the most iconic songs in the rate.


**agentofscranton** (6): popheads evidently has absolutely no time for pre-band Wonder Girls as it cuts 3 of the 4 songs the era had to offer. Will Nobody be able to fare any better? Be My Baby is a cute little sugar rush of a song even if isn't my favourite. The absolute nothingness of the routine though lol.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**selegend** (10): so tempted to give this an 11 too


**wavingwolves** (10): the ''jyp and the wonder girls... are back'' intro makes me feel so many things. so much respect to the actual queens of kpop


**Qwilphish** (9): unabashedly cheesy and joyful. its such a fun song


**twat\_brained** (8.7): glad to see we’re starting to get into the “classic” k-pop sound here. And with a well-placed key change!


**radiofan15** (8.6): The sugary rush on the production OMG... Michelle Obama does NOT approve


**1998tweety** (8.5): Cute


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.3): JYP basically did this song better later with “Bulldozer” but this is still cute


**2l82bstr8** (7.5): such a sugary dancey song, but the rap break is kinda awful this time, which is really ufortunate


**AnimationJava** (7.5): Sounding almost like a Christmas jingle, it's very wholesome and cute!


**MrSwearword** (7): a bit of an awkward transition of sound. Has that 50s rhythm but the sound is a bit too "2011" for this.


**sarcasticsobs** (7): this chorus is a christmas pop song and again the rap part saves it


**fadedblue09** (6.6): Cute bop but sounds like a Christmas song???


**Maybe9** (6): this song is so tacky


**nowqueenofpop** (5): This song drives me a little crazy because something about it reminds me of Chicken Little. I cannot put into words HOW it does or where that association even came from. Anyway… Yubin in the mv? I am looking respectfully

**smile-on-crayon** (8): MV's shot in dominantly black and white can go one of two ways: either down the Single Ladies or be forgettable. This song starts out real good though, even surprises the viewer with spots of color. But that rap part can go die. All in all, I'd listen to it again

**bespectacIed** (10): I almost wanted to shut this rate down while I painfully watched this ICONIC, bait-and-switch, Bohemian Rhapsody-esque song (yeah I am reaching) languish at the bottom rankings. In my mind, Come Back Home is 2NE1’s musical peak, and one of the best 2nd Generation songs ever. The delirious but effective genre-switching makes the songs so fucking brilliant imo. I adore the EDM breakdown that just adds to the weirdness of this song. The Spotify version of this doesn’t justify the chaotic-ness of this song, since it doesn’t have the random acoustic guitar rap verse squeezed between the reggae verses and electronic breakdowns. Lastly, the music video was so well-done!!! This comeback is just so well-done. Y’all are tasteless for real, I CAN’T DEAL.


**agentofscranton** (6.5): And with this exit we're down to 2NE1's final three songs! I was honestly kinda shook to see this go out so early, let alone never even crack the top 40, but I can't say I'm too sorry to see it go. There's a good song somewhere in Come Back Home. The first part of the chorus is fantastic, and the girls sound fantastic. That music video? a serve of the highest degree. It's just a shame that the song is violently throttled by that drop and Dara's impression of a possessed doll.

# only bitches in this house i've ever respected

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): whew the contrast between the almost tropical verses and that DROP in the post-chorus we had to stan


**Maybe9** (10): im finna cry


**radiofan15** (10): Trailblazing mash-up did THAT


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**sailormunelune** (10): peak 2NE1


**wavingwolves** (10): this is madness and it's really the kind of thing you can only find in kpop


**1998tweety** (9): I like it


**\_Doh\_** (9): This song that sent me down the kpop rabbit hole


**Shinkopeshon** (9): I already heard this song (including the acoustic version) and it's easily their best from those I've heard. It has everything a great and interesting K-Pop songs need and more.


#have valid complaints and critiques that I respect 

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): I really like the structure and the use of instrumentation in this song, it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. but the chorus is a little too grating, both in the synths and the vocal performance. still a lovely song


**dynamicity** (8.5): Can't decide between a sentimental ballad and an innuendo-laden reggae-infused pop bop? Why not have both?


**Qwilphish** (8.5): One of the best music videos I've ever watched. Unfortunately the breakdown brings this song down a lot. I think the rest of the song is perfect though.


**JohnnyToby** (8): 2014 was really the year of drops


**fadedblue09** (7.8): That drop oof. Still fun to listen though. Also, I loved the Caribbean-lite (?) verses.


**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): This paved the way for the tropical house obsession of 2016/17


**cutefuss** (7.4): the 'come baby baby come come' autotune part tanks this otherwise great song a full point.


**fifteensunflwrs** (7): the song would be a 9 if it wasn't for that god awful "come back hoooooooome come baby baby come come" beat drop


**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I really like the verses and prechorus to this song but wow that drop destroys it from being a 10


**heeyeon** (7): dara's 'come baby baby' haunts me in my dreams. great verses tho


**taeneon** (7): a good song but not something I'd listen to on repeat


**MrSwearword** (6): they tried something here, I don't deny that. It's just that once the hook or chorus comes in, it's just badly delivered.


**Qustomar** (6): this is the culmination of every genre 2ne1 has done: electropop, reggae, ballad, halsey singing, trend-chasing edm. and it's fine. but there's too much going on


**AnimationJava** (5.5): The vocals on this were good up until the breakdown, which I personally didn't find pleasing.


**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): I- uh, reggae beats? and then whatever that drop is? lol


**twat\_brained** (5.3): give Rihanna back her leftover Man Down club mix then we can talk


**rickikardashian** (5): i took off like 3 points for that ugly ass drop


**sarcasticsobs** (5): really rad video, but the actual song wasn’t for me, something about the “drop”


**untutorable** (5): this is my least favorite of the 2ne1 tracks on this list and, as my score suggests, i find it very middle of the road. the chorus falls kinda flat for me, the prechorus builds up and feels really exciting but the rest of the song..... meh!


**alwayswords** (3): i can’t stand the breakdown in this


**selegend** (3): sounds like something blackpink would record

**bespectacIed** (10): Summer of 2015 was declared a disco summer by Sistar and heck yeah, we shook every jutted part of our body to this iconic bop. The disco horns mixed with the modern pop production is just so damn irresistible. Sistar didn’t have to remind us MAKE IT LOUDER in this song, because our speakers already are. Let's shake it up for Sistar!!!


**agentofscranton** (8): Shake It suffers for the same reason that songs like Ah Yeah by EXID and BAAM by Momoland do - they're not necessarily bad songs, but we've just heard you make this song before and better? That music video goes off though, featuring cameos from pre-Monsta X Shownu and Wonho looking beautiful as ever.

**cutefuss** (8.5): i will never forgive sistar's company for making me think this music video was going to be superhero/villain themed. they lied to me.


**Maybe9** (8.5): booty could never

**bespectacIed** (10): It was a choice between See Sea and Dally on what Hyolyn solo to include in the bonus rate, but there’s already a couple of synth-pop songs here so we ultimately chose the latter. In retrospect, that seemed like a mistake because See Sea would’ve been received better in this rate lmaoooo, BUT I HAD SO MUCH HOPE FOR DALLY. This is absolutely one of my favorite solo songs in k-pop ever: the utter coolness, sexiness, and confidence oozing from this song just excites every cell in my body. Hyolyn, one of the most talented all-rounders of the 2nd generation, delivers everything she's got in this sex-in-a-stick bop that will forever attack my poor hair roots. Y’all did this dirty and trust, you will be dealt with.


**agentofscranton** (6.5): stream See Sea instead


---


**1998tweety** (10): We love Tinashe, a hoe bop, a bop for the gays.


**dynamicity** (10): When you heard that GRAY at the start of a song you know it's gonna be good. Hyolyn set the bar for solo acts.


**fadedblue09** (10): Pretty cool trap bop.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): This song is GAY. I don't know how or why but it just is. I don't make the rules. Bekah's rap threw the first brick at Stonewall. Besides being *homosexual* this song also marks the first appearance of After School's eighth member Lizzy, who would also go on to be a member of Orange Caramel with Nana and Raina.


**bespectacIed** (6): Uh-uh, this my shit! ~~Hollaback Girl~~ BANG! saw After School deliver one of their most iconic songs with this marching band inspired bop. Sadly, it’s After School first song out in this rate, but honestly their two remaining songs are just so perfect, you had to forgive this exit

#band geeks

**dynamicity** (10): Nobody has delivered a bridge like this in kpop ever since!


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**sailormunelune** (10): The bridge is heavenly


**untutorable** (10): this song.... THIS! SONG! listen up first of all these girls actually learned how to fucking drum for this comeback so put some respect on after school's name ok second of all it has one of my favorite bridges in kpop history it's absolutely STUNNING their power is unmatched. block me right now this is all i'm going to talk about for the rest of my life


**wavingwolves** (10): gwen stefani wishes hollaback girl was this powerful


**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): love the weird combination of like military snares and eerie harpsichord


**\_Doh\_** (9): These are the girls who would bully you in high school


**heeyeon** (9): queens of concepts


**MasterGrammar** (9): Wish my school had this kind of marching band when I was in school


**nowqueenofpop** (9): Imagine being After School and after debuting with smash hit Ah, you come out a year later with BANG! A kpop reset


**Qustomar** (9): strong gwen stefani vibes, like wind it up or yummy. classic energy


**sarcasticsobs** (9): drumline is not a concept I saw coming tbh


**taeneon** (9): another super iconic song the talent n impact is just far too much


**twat\_brained** (8.7): UH HUH UH HUH UH HUH goodness me, this is basically a kpop version of Lose My Breath and I'm certain I'd lose mine if I tried to dance along to it, which I certainly plan to do


**radiofan15** (8.6): This is a High School Musical 3: Senior Year outtake and you can't change my mind about it


**2l82bstr8** (8.5): I feel tempted to dock multiple points based on those outfits alone but I swear I'll refrain. it is an absolute banger though, but I kinda feel like it doesn't really go anywhere super interesting? even the heavenly bridge and Raina's high note is kinda tainted by the awkward transition and the awkward mix of the rapping behind her. I still love this song but it's not my favorite After School song


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I remember when Taylor Swift used a drum line for that performance of “Me” and everyone accused her of ripping off Beychella and I’m like oh you kids don’t even KNOW about drum lines!


**therokinrolla** (8.5): hold awn this is kinda great? there's so many odd production quirks here, and a well utilized marching drum. A


**Shinkopeshon** (8.2): The production on here is just quality and a decade later, it absolutely holds up.


**Agusarg** (8): The production gives me Timbaland vibes, I love it


**cutefuss** (7.7): this would be a full point lower if i wasn't aware of the fact that they learned to play the drums for this song


**AnimationJava** (7): I liked the vocal bridge part the most, near the end. Tbh the rapping underneath the vocals didn't sit too well with me, and neither did the "uh-huh" parts but overall a cute track!


**MrSwearword** (7): the beat warrants this score. The song doesn't but that beat fucking knocks.

#glee kids 

**JohnnyToby** (6.2): that intro....rip pledis girls


**fadedblue09** (5.2): I like the subdued moment in the bridge and...that’s it. There’s just too much going on to digest this.

**bespectacIed** (10): I was heartbroken that y'all didn't care that much for this amazing Miss A track ... which is my absolute favorite of theirs. Probably one of my favorite k-pop songs of the past decade. This song has the makings of a pop perfection: catchy horns, irresistible bubblegum pop chorus, and of course, a faggot-pink music video, which if y’all don't know, had cameos from several TWICE members! This title track unfortunately is a reaffirmation of the "Suzy and friends" drag for Miss A. From the line distribution to the focus on the music video, it's apparent that Suzy's solo stardom has eclipsed her group’s at this point. Hence, this is sadly the iconic JYP girl group's final title track. Regardless, in my heart, they will always be my baby ... baby... baby... neo ohh.


**agentofscranton** (8): The gag is that I had this at a 10 until the comments about the screaming in the background showed up and now I can't listen to it anymore without noticing them and they are DISTRACTING. It's just like when someone pointed out the slide whistle in TT and ruined that song forever. Anyways, Only You is a bright and bouncy little bop, with an amazing music video that comes with it.


---


**fadedblue09** (11): Have nothing much to say but that is a fun, soaring chorus. Edit: After rounds of deliberation, I've decided to give my 11 to this since that chorus is too hard to resist. Make this a Day 3 song pls.


**dynamicity** (10): This song is so fucking addicting.


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): the chorus doesnt quite live up to how great the verses are but ugh this slaps


**Qwilphish** (8.5): that chorus is so infectious, the verses don't keep up however in my opinion


**twat\_brained** (8.2): maybe not quite on par with their other singles but still a very respectable effort from these girlies nonetheless. I'm surprised I don't hear more about them on Twitter and the like, they can absolutely run with the best of them.


**1998tweety** (8): I like it


**sarcasticsobs** (8): okay yeah but the blue scene in the MV


**AnimationJava** (7.5): I found the instrumental of this track fun! A very easy beat to pick up.


**rickikardashian** (7.5): i really liked the chorus but that sax-y post-chorus break down…. sis


**2l82bstr8** (7): it's the perfect mix of girly and sexy, but it feels like the instrumental is trying to find every possible way to annoy me. that screaming man in the hook is all I can think about when I'm listening. it's the rare song that's better without headphones


**radiofan15** (6.9): It is rare for me to say something like this about a k-pop song... but this needs a little bit more of a punch and noise and overproduction to truly stand out


**smile-on-crayon** (6): Visually unforgettable, musically forgettable.


**taeneon** (6): the chorus is fun but the verses are kinda boring


**MrSwearword** (5): middle of the road and sounds dated by three years


**cutefuss** (4.7): the best part of this song is the ultra cute music video. otherwise it sounds like a little mix b-side and caused miss a to go out with a whimper instead of a bang.


**Maybe9** (4): i couldn't tell this song was playing

#life used to be so peaceful back when I didn't hear this smh i hate y'all, now it's all can hear 

**\_Doh\_** (8): the screaming man concerns me

**heeyeon** (7): used to love this song until i heard the screams in the background... jyp why

**wavingwolves** (6.5): a problem that i have with this song is that it has some random grunts and screams and it takes me out everytime... but at the same time it's so funny that it has it so i can't give it a bad score

**agentofscranton** (7.5): Much like Momoland's comebacks after BBoom BBoom, Lovey Dovey suffers as a result of comparison to the songs that came before it and it clearly tries to emulate. Not to say that Lovey Dovey doesn't go off - because it absolutely does, and it can absolutely hold it's own against most other songs, but we here at popheads just weren't feeling too Lovey Dovey.


**bespectacIed** (7): T-ara’s repetitive choruses are always guaranteed to smash the charts and seep into the psyche of every k-pop stan. It was executed almost the same as its club-themed predecessor Roly Poly, and the result was another T-ara mega-hit, at the expense of me being absolutely exhausted by it, sadly. Still a bop though!

**rotating3Dtext** (9): I can’t get this stupid song out of my head!!


**sarcasticsobs** (9): freaking earworm, man, and wild video


**smile-on-crayon** (9): I'm giving a lot of weight of the rate on the MV more than I did the other songs I have rated on here. No other company/group have come close to trying the risk of making a drama MV with this kind of quality, save for the BTS and LOONA concept universes. More should try, because T-ara tried again with their two-part post-apocalyptic MV of "Day By Day"/"Sexy Love"/"Don't Leave".


**Shinkopeshon** (8.3): T-ara somehow managed to pay tribute to the past and set new trends at the same time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): ^oh ^^oh ^^^oh ^oh


**cutefuss** (6.8): this was really when the charm of their previous eras took a nose dive, the song is fine but feels considerably less unique and innovative than bpbp and rp did.


**AnimationJava** (6.5): The effect on the backing vocals was pretty neat.


**fadedblue09** (5.4): I'm starting to see a recurring issue with their songs.


**2l82bstr8** (5): this is just the boring 2010's version of Roly Poly

#I agree with both somehow

**untutorable** (10): roly poly 2.0 and just as good

**bespectacIed** (7): Yeah zero lies were detected in this song. Girls’ Generation made us feel the heat, without actually bringing boys out because they’re not really required in ~~society~~ this diva track. Seriously, has there ever been a more extra music video introduction than SNSD posing in slo-mo amongst falling rose petals, with Jessica releasing a dove at the end? The vocoders, punchy electronic beats, and rap-singing all contribute to a formulaic hit for SNSD. The Boys sound indistinguishable from the millions of electropop songs released in the early 2010s, but we dgaf. Sometimes, pretty girls in pretty fits doing pretty things is all we need! P.S. There’s no The Boys (English version) in Ba Sing Se.


**agentofscranton** (3): This one just really isn't for me. As always the girls serve in the music video, and the vocal line stomp on the song. But it's just so meh to me. Idk it's never clicked with me, and it didn't click with enough of you either, and as a result it falls just outside of the top 40.

# My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

**dynamicity** (11): This is gonna go out day 1 but I don't care! Nothing will ever top this!


**1998tweety** (10): Y'all are gonna drag this but I love it tbh.


**DaBigBoi** (10): Cut the cameras...cultural reset


**Maybe9** (10): im partial to the snoop dogg version, but this is still 10 enough for me


**NuneEtsuko** (10): I think SNSD pulls off the cute cheesy songs really well, better than any other GG IMO, but man their badass stuff is on another level, this is sooo good!


**Qwilphish** (10): the english version of this song is the best english version of any kpop song


**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic


**therokinrolla** (10): This was NOT for America, SNSD Jopped before those SuPERM babies even considered releasing a song in a America. I mean really, who keeps writing these Kpop songs to "appeal to western audiences" without actually making a song like anything anyone in the western GP would ever consider listening to, LORD.


**Shinkopeshon** (9.7): This is just iconic.


**2l82bstr8** (9.5): another complete banger. I love how this song subtly builds up to the post-bridge (?). it sounds so fresh and oddly quiet.


**sarcasticsobs** (9): taeyeon went OFF. that choreo right when the song kicks in, oh yeah. wait, same with the chorus one. then the bridge one too


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.6): ^b-bring ^the ^boys ^out GIRLS GENERATION MAKE YOU FEEL DA HEAT


**sailormunelune** (8.5): A perfect era [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bc9MnhL8qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bc9MnhL8qw)


**twat\_brained** (8.4): the instrumental started out as this Disney Channel star 3rd album single but as always these girlies just take their artistry above and beyond. If anyone’s gonna get me into this kind of music it’ll be these multi-talented mistresses.


**hiramutsu** (8): The song makes me cringed a little though.


**JohnnyToby** (8): u know i was gonna say this was prob their Signal but....I only don't like the "rap"


**untutorable** (8): i love when they yell


**radiofan15** (7.6): Why aren't we rating the version with Snoop Dogg?


**cutefuss** (7.5): they bring the boys out


**MrSwearword** (7): another case of production knocking but the vocals not meeting the production.


**Qustomar** (7): i have a lot of issues with this song, but nothing gets you hype like "GIRLS BRING THE BOYS OUT"

# I don't want no scrub

**AnimationJava** (6): While an iconic song, I don't feel too much for it.


**dlong5665** (6): tae and jessica really saved this from being their worst song whew


**rotating3Dtext** (6): this sounds like a reject from The Fame


**taeneon** (6): an iconic and amazing era but i can't listen to the song and not think of the awkward american performances/interviews


**fadedblue09** (4.9): Ugh, this is one of their songs I'm not super fond of. Too cheerleader-y for my taste and elements of the song are super grating.


**wavingwolves** (4): i don't like boys very much anyway


**waluigiest** (3): feels dated in an upsetting way


**cloudbustingmp3** (1.6): bring the good song out instead


**letsallpoo** (1): i remember trying to force myself to like this in 10th grade. it didn't work
