**Lowest Scores:**

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Literally everyone and their mama knows of this infectious Teddy Park track. This isn't Sunmi's first solo song; she has already served pop excellence like 24 Hours and Full Moon from her short bob solo days in JYP. But her first release as an independent artist is really what catapulted her to solo superstardom. A star is reborn with this one.

**agentofscranton** (7): The song that absolutely had South Korea by the throat. This shit was everywhere when it came out. Every k-pop idol and their parents must've covered this dance on some variety show at some point. Honestly I still don't completely get the hype with Gashina. It's a good song, and I do bop to it, and the killing move is a killing move for a reason. We love duality. But Sunmi's later releases are far far better. Stream Siren.

---

**AnimationJava** (10): An amazing bop! She's an LGBT person and it really shows heheheh.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): not her best solo single and STILL a fucking banger! that's power baby!

**cutefuss** (10): sunmi is one of the best solo artists in kpop right now, full stop. she's the only idol i've seen live in concert, and i can confidently say she was born to perform.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Can’t wait for this to win the bonus rate.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): head empty only thought is dahyun doing the bend

**wavingwolves** (10): honestly i said this like 15 times during this rate already but this was such a cultural reset... like... everything about this is perfect god

**misconceptionsofyou** (9.5): tho if it's Siren i'll give it 10 straight up

**smile-on-crayon** (9): Making finger guns cool again. Her other song, "Heroine" is better IMO, however plagiarizing it may be.

**untutorable** (9): PERIOD

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's cute....thankfully all her other title tracks are better

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): I love the quiet swagger, but it doesn't quite click with me. her later material is much better, I feel

**nowqueenofpop** (8): gashina is the type of song where you cycle through listening to it on repeat for 2 days or skipping it every time it comes on, no in between

**Unprettiest** (7.6): 24 hours was better

**_Doh_** (7): I prefer the songs she released after Gashina

**MrSwearword** (7): the beat becomes very of its time in a bad way very quickly

**radiofan15** (6.6): The drop really did everything but wonders with this song...

**dynamicity** (6.5): Honestly not that interesting without the dance. Her other music is far more interesting.

**fadedblue09** (4.4): That drop is a NOPE.

**selegend** (4): i never liked this, sorry queen

kwcty6888: It really is crazy to me that she was shot to stardom three separate times and a lot of people don't recognize it's her each time. I've seen repeatedly people who recognize her as a WG or 24 hours or for Gasina to but not realize she was the artist of all three. Just goes to show how versatile and adaptable she is

**agentofscranton** (10): And so we bid adieu to AOA, also known as the inventors of the zipper! Originally the worst performing AOA song in the rate (which is insane), Miniskirt managed to claw it's way into the top 20, and stayed just in there, but not without constantly yo-yo-ing in and out of it. I'll probably already have said this 50 times in this countdown but Miniskirt is capital I Iconic. That routine. Jimin's Heys. That phenomenal chorus. Everytime that chorus hits I feel like the sexiest person in the galaxy.

**bespectacIed** (10): AOA showed much-appreciated versatility with this sultry bop with a simple but super sensual video. This track was a perfect mix jazz-ish / neo-soul-ish production, swirling “woooh-oooh” accents, and godly vocals (punctuated by Choa’s high run at the end). Of course, most importantly, the girls repeatedly calling us **MARICON** in the chorus? A moment most pleasing to me in my career. (/s)

#I just met you, and this is crazy

**Agusarg** (10): God it's so good, the instrumental and the vocals are top tier

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the mother of all slut anthems my assh*le is trembling

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the low-key retro dancepop vibes of this.

**heeyeon** (10): when brave brothers is good, he is fucking great. pop perfection

**Maybe9** (10): a perfect song

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): big fat 10

**nowqueenofpop** (10): Never appreciated this song until they went on Queendom and then I had to watch their performance 15 times in a row each time, minimum

**Qustomar** (10): if you've never done the choreography in your bathroom at 2 am, have you ever lived?

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**waluigiest** (10): this is so GROOVY

**wavingwolves** (10): please remember when everyone and their mothers did this choreography... i miss it

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): if you can resist saying “hey” when this song comes on you’re a stronger person than I am

**1998tweety** (9): Huge bop, love a sex vibe

**Qwilphish** (9): hey!

**twat_brained** (8.8): one song in and I have no idea why these girls aren't at least 2/3rds as recognized for their efforts as BLACKPINK. In fairness I don't think they're as suggestive with their music as this song

**Shinkopeshon** (8.7): I just want to say that I'm glad I went with the YT playlist instead of Spotify (it goes without saying that the song itself is fantastic and sensual even without the visual).

**hiramutsu** (8.5): MV boosted the score up by 0.5

**untutorable** (8.5): i am but a simple lesbian i cannot help but love aoa's sexy concept and this song is so catchy

**2l82bstr8** (8): Mary Quant is shaking

**AnimationJava** (8): A cute song! I found it very fun and the choreo is great too!

**radiofan15** (7.6): Cute I guess... but the vocals kinda kills it

**_Doh_** (7): I counted at least 27 heys

**dynamicity** (7): Perhaps the most iconic example of Brave Bros synthpop, though I find the hook a bit boring.

#I was doing just fine before I met you


**JohnnyToby** (6): Ive never understood AOA and i hate the word hey now

**MrSwearword** (6): above par but still very boring

**cutefuss** (5.6): god i love aoa but this song just is not my thing aside from the iconic dance

**smile-on-crayon** (5): Okay, the MV is hot, but what can you offer me musically?

bespectacIed: # AOA

**Overall Average**: 7.853 **// Average Controversy:** 1.845

 ^hey! So I wasn't suuuuuper familiar with AOA beyond Miniskirt and Like A Cat before their stint on Queendom, but my god since then I've been obsessed! The talent and charisma that all of these girls exude is next level, and the fact that they managed to overcome almost every obstacle that came their way, with so many people betting on their disbandment so many times over the years, it's fantastic that these girls are still going strong 8 years since their debut!, This is the end for Ace of Angels, the ONLY 3rd generation group in this rate supposedly celebrating 2nd Gen Music (sue us). We feel like AOA's peak coincided with the peaks of most girl groups in this rate and their sound is inseparable from this era of k-pop. AOA kinda gets under the radar sometimes, but I firmly believe they have one of the strongest discographies in k-pop, spewing pop perfection title tracks left and right that still stand the test of time. Despite some messy lineup changes, notably with the departure of their main vocalist, queen of short haircuts Choa, AOA has made an indelible mark in the industry, and we hope that they continue to do so. Power through, angels!

---
**Qustomar** (9.167): queens of brave brothers and sweetune bops, they came to give good music and fun concepts and that's what they did!

**fadedblue09** (8.700): Consistently cute bops, and thankfully nothing falls into atrocious territory. Maybe I should hear more of their songs.

**dynamicity** (8.333): Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

**selegend** (8.333): sorry imma just be handing out 9s and 10s left and right from now on

**twat_brained** (8.233): A palindromic name, huh? I wonder how this translates to their music.

**2l82bstr8** (8.167): not my favorite in terms of music, but I do really like how they all have very different voices, and their material really shows that. they're one of two groups in this rate that are still going strong, too!

**therokinrolla** (6.667): I'm sorry I just don't get the music that much. I get the sexy concept, which is kinda fun. The atmosphere is cute too and my average is fine its just. I dont stan. Cute though!

**agentofscranton** (10): ROBBED! Roly Poly, the infectious disco-influenced bop and T-ara's final song in the rate, falls at 19th place, and can I just say how dare you all. Few things activate the little gay microchip in my head that makes me act like a fool, but Roly Poly is one of those songs. It's just such an upbeat and danceable song that you can't help but just thrash around in your room like an idiot when you listen to it. An absolute gem of a song, and was definitely in the running to receive my 11.

**bespectacIed** (10): There are few songs in k-pop that just activates a buried chip in my brain and makes me become a mindless stan unable to stop bopping ... Roly Poly is one of those songs!!!!!! The iconic 70s music video and viral dance move all still feel like a fever dream to me. Every disco note, every outfit, every dance step made with a deadpan face in this song is ingrained on my brain. If numbers could talk, they will tell that this is one of the biggest girl group k-pop songs of all time. The chart success, sales and ubiquity of this song is unmatched. T-ara released a TRUE classic with Roly Poly, a legendary song that COULD have been rated higher... \*takes off my giant sunglasses and wipes tears with my 70s polka dot shirt\*

---

**smile-on-crayon** (11): This is the song that kept me in the clutches of Kpop. Once I saw Jiyeon strut on to the center of the stage and the song began, I accepted my fate.

**2l82bstr8** (10): i like it like it this i like it like it that i like this like that Y E A H

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): omg this classic... when the strings come in that's gay rights hunty

**dynamicity** (10): Disco perfection.

**heeyeon** (10): if this isn't top 10 y'all are cancelled

**Maybe9** (10): this is a chair dancing anthem

**MrSwearword** (10): I fully support this disco done by Korea realness down boots

**Qustomar** (10): dua lipa tried and failed to recreate this

**radiofan15** (10): I see John Travolta really is influencing gay culture...

**ralah** (10): only kpop song my dad likes, but he refuses to believe its kpop despite the korean lyrics -.-

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): I like this, like that, yeah!

**untutorable** (10): phenomenal

**wavingwolves** (10): this was one of the first (if not the actual first) kpop songs i ever listened to and it has lived in my heart since them. truly amazing

**Unprettiest** (9.3): campy in the best way

**hiramutsu** (9): Roly-Poly in Copacabana MV better

**Qwilphish** (9): invented disco i love them just vibin with the dance hahaha

**twat_brained** (8.7): fuckin slapper

**Shinkopeshon** (8.2): I wasn't into K-Pop back then but man, thousands of people better have played the shit out of this song because that choreo is an instant classic. It would've gone viral immediately if it came out five years later.

**JohnnyToby** (8): a mistake not choosing the disco remix

**1998tweety** (7): The chorus is nice but I don't really like the rest

**AnimationJava** (7): The melody after "poly" in the chorus was the cherry on top for this song tbh.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): during the verse beat all i could think was “vi sitter här i venten och spelar lite DotA”

**fadedblue09** (4): Similar to the preceding song but somehow more forgettable. Also, it felt like 5 minutes???

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I’ve never understood the hype around this song? So many people seem to love it but it sounds so cheap and thin.


#Not the first time we blamed Hwayoung for something bad in T-ara
**misconceptionsofyou** (9.5): tho could've been 10 if it wasn't for my resentment to Hwayoung's tiny but utterly cringey 'rap' part

bespectacIed: # T-ara

---

**Overall Average**: 7.562 **// Average Controversy:** 2.117

---

 Queens of throwback and repetitive choruses that you're gonna need a lobotomy to get out of your head!!! T-ara really gave SNSD a run for their money in terms of being the highest-selling girl group every year, especially at the turn of the decade.  It's so unfortunate that during their peak, their careers had been riddled by more controversies than they deserve ... T-ARA imo easily could have steamrolled 2nd Gen. But when they were on their game, they were really on top of everybody else, and the results are LANDMARK, historic songs in k-pop. Keep your shiny *tiaras* on, queens.

---
**Qustomar** (9.875): HWAYOUNG SNAKE HISS

**twat_brained** (9.525): I expect many confusions between them and Kara

**smile-on-crayon** (9.250): They are my Queen(s).

**dynamicity** (8.750): I still remember when they were considered to be contenders for the top GG in Korea...

**NuneEtsuko** (8.625): You guys chose such great T-ara songs, I'm afraid I'm just going to give these all 10 for nostalgic reasons, would've loved to have my faves Cry Cry, Day By Day also included though. Their songs in general though are such earworn, they've produced so many stupid catchy tunes that for me they should be regarded same as SNSD, WG and 2NE1. If it wasn't for the tragic way they disbanded, I'm sure they would've reached even higher levels of popularity.

**Unprettiest** (7.450): Day by Day

**2l82bstr8** (7.375): the original club queens. also the original drama queens. in more ways than one

**selegend** (7.250): their music aged poorly but sugar free was impeccably produced

**fadedblue09** (5.975): Idk if this is their fault but their songs feel a little too flat and lacking in a certain 'punch'. Also, it appears that the production is the emphasized aspect of their songs, which isn't what I like.

**agentofscranton** (10): EAT THE RICH !!! And after 2 days Brown Eyed Girls have finally decided to join the rest of us in this rate. Sixth Sense is e-ve-ry-thing. Sixth Sense is an absolute monster of a song and I don't know why I was shocked that it did so well considering this is one of the greatest songs the genre has to offer (I mean let's be real there's very few songs in this rate that aren't). I wanna highlight a specific point of this song to gush about in this comment but there's just not one singular moment. It's all absolutely (pardon my gay) wig snatching. Miryo's rap? That bridge where they just try to outbelt each other? The strings? UGH. 3rd gen k-pop could never.

**bespectacIed** (10): Ended police brutality!!! Few groups in k-pop today are able to execute dark, fierce concepts as successfully as B.E.G in Sixth Sense.  The disco riffs??? The vocals? Miryo's rap? The random meows? The part at the bridge where Jea, Gain and Narsha just one-ups each other with who can make the highest “AHHHHH”??? I am wigless. In this comeback, the girls truly reiterated that they are a group full of S I N G E R S ^(and a great rapper.) Interestingly this had a few weeks of stint in the top 10, then slowly climbed down ... but the scores in the top 20 are soooo close anyway that it’s ranking is really not bad.

---

**Agusarg** (10): Amazing instrumental and genuinely impressive vocals

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): YES VOCALS!

**dlong5665** (10): i pee a little everytime jea says “hit that high” after the whistle note thing

**heeyeon** (10): a true anthem, production slaps, the high notes are insane, i love my k-pop grannies

**JohnnyToby** (10): I remember trying to do the whistle note at the end oh god

**Qwilphish** (10): they did what they had to do. marxist queens

**ralah** (10): narsha looked SO good and i freaking love the mv

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**taeneon** (10): another perfect song all kpop fans should listen to

**untutorable** (10): this was so close to being my 11 this song is so fucking good from miryo's rap to ga-in and narsha's high notes.... this is an anthem

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): I wish overthrowing authoritarian governments could sound this good and look this sexy

**wavingwolves** (9.5): the only way this could get better is if it was directed by m. night shyamalan

**cutefuss** (9.4): god this song is just kpop all over beg really said hold on we have a genre to carry

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.1): the dead people that the kid in *Sixth Sense* sees are all the people that Brown Eyed Girls killed with this comeback. “No need to worry, love is just a game” is one of the rawest lines ever recorded for a Kpop song.

**DaBigBoi** (9): Gracias

**MrSwearword** (9): mainly because the video outdoes the song on so many levels but the edge here is rather surprising to me

**waluigiest** (9): ok fallout boy!!!

**fadedblue09** (8.6): Another stomping anthem.

**Unprettiest** (8.6): i learned of this song from an evangelical christian anti-illuminati site. needless to say i'm not a christian anymore

**dynamicity** (8.5): A bit repetitive but I love the concept.

**rickikardashian** (7.8): the way this suddenly starts sounding like a 60s girl band group isnt vibing with me that well, but honestly if this was a little mix song i would eat it up. anyway, what the fuck is up with this 1984 hunger game revolution-esque video

**twat_brained** (7.7): …is this video supposed to be some sort of commentary on the North Korean regime? In any event, I commend these women, not girls, because they don’t act like girls, for taking a different direction in their music vs the hegemonic high-octane, overproduced work of their peers

**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): The sixth sense is… talent!

**AnimationJava** (7): I liked the sultry vocals on this and the trumpets/barbershop vibes! I don't know too much about Brown Eyed Girls so I would've liked to see more from them for this rate but I understand the limitations of the rate curators.

**radiofan15** (6.9): Out of all of the songs in this rate whose scores got affected by the poor mastering... this one is the most egregious of them all, as it is a bop that just happens to be unlistenable as it is now. The only reason I kept a relatively high score is because of THAT high note.

**smile-on-crayon** (6): Visually, it's top-notch; musically, derivative.

**Maybe9** (4): i fed 2010s kpop to a robot and it produced this

# mamamoo so talented they influenced a 2011 song (jk i know what u mean gain sounds like wheein on the chorus a lil bit)

**1998tweety** (9.5): NCT U barely outsold, loving the Mamamoo vibes

**agentofscranton** (10): The battle for popheads' favourite SISTAR title track was a fierce one with it flipping between I Like That and Touch My Body in the last half of the rate, but ultimately I Like That pulled away and beat out [Peter Griffin's introduction to k-pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKn7acXTppU), and leaves our rate in 17th. Touch My Body was SISTAR's 5th Gaon number one in a row and it's not hard to see why. It's an infectious piece of summer boppery that makes you just yearn for a pool party.

**bespectacIed** (10): The girls shook summer of 2014 with a song that couldn't be more in your face with its sexiness and flirtatiousness. Sistar’s songs are always so special to me and really separates themselves from the countless dance-pop tracks of their peers because they’re always so well-sung and sensory-overloaded. I mean … poolside with crop tops, micro-shorts, neon-colored sets, and shaking butts in a summery, dance-pop beat? Sistar always gave the summer gays and girls everything they wanted.

---


#I love Sistar. Sistar’s fabulous. I think she’s a great writer, great singer. She’s excellent. And she’s a very sweet person as well, very sweet

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE summer BOP

**2l82bstr8** (10): I completely forgot how good this song was. it's the perfect encapsulation of their summer formula. such a light, fun bop. and the visuals being served in this video!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay big mood

**dynamicity** (10): PLEASE watch this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BomY9SkErs0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BomY9SkErs0)

**fadedblue09** (10): Bouncy, vibrant dance-pop jam.

**JohnnyToby** (10): tbh that intro got me

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**selegend** (10): i listen to gospel singers

**wavingwolves** (10): britney in work bitch made a lot of points and this mv proves it. also this is is literally a perfect pop song and one of the best in kpop. it never fails to make me move, ugh!!!!

**Qwilphish** (9.5): EVERY SUMMER IS A SISTAR SUMMER

**DaBigBoi** (9): THE sexy bop

**Qustomar** (9): [https://youtu.be/rKn7acXTppU](https://youtu.be/rKn7acXTppU)

**twat_brained** (8.4): the sax solo is kinda naff but otherwise more of songs like this!

**cutefuss** (8.3): THEY FOUND IT! THEY FOUND THEIR SOUND!

**AnimationJava** (8): Touch My Body by Mariah Carey and Touch My Body by SISTAR are two classics.

**Maybe9** (8): issabop

**untutorable** (8): summer anthem

#IDKH

**radiofan15** (7.9): Mariah has been found alive and unbothered

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): I was really into this during the three second intro but once it switched to the actual song it was pretty just okay but still good.

**smile-on-crayon** (7): A collab with Mariah Carey at that time would have been interesting.

**Unprettiest** (7): wow they sure love swimming pools

**MrSwearword** (6): it's upbeat but the sexy shtick doesn't work against the upbeat nature

**agentofscranton** (10): And so we say goodbye to Apink's first foray into maturity with the impeccable I'm So Sick. Were it not for the fact that another song was in the rate, I'm So Sick would've snatched my 11 so fast. The production - handled by gods Black Eyed Pilseung, who are also responsible for Chungha's *Gotta Go* and *Roller Coaster*, Hyolyn's *See Sea*, rate casualties *Touch My Body* and *Only You*, and TWICE's *Like OOH-AHH*, *Cheer Up*, *TT*, *Likey*, and *Fancy* amongst others - is absolutely fucking impeccable. Not to be too stereotypical a gay but my wig. consider it snatched. That guitar shred just before the final chorus is absolutely godly. Ugh, a perfect song.

**bespectacIed** (10): The start of the drastic but welcome change of sound for this once angelic and cutesy group. I'm So Sick is a fun synthpop song that ushered Apink to the girl crush obsessed 3rd generation, reminding all of us that they are still very much capable of shaking the industry. Apink said they’re so sick of lying, and us fans will never be sick of the girls.

---



**1998tweety** (11): Good LORDE this song. Wow, it starts with an immaculate intro and only goes up from there. The verses and cute and have their high points, the chorus is the star of the show though. She goes OFF, so catchy. That guitar though before the last chorus, boptized...

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the production on this is SICK haha get it

**2l82bstr8** (10): this song still floors me with how perfect it is. and they would only improve on it in the following years! the lead-up into the chorus is just chef's kiss

**Agusarg** (10): Their previous songs where not bad but THIS is something else. Fantastic production and hook, it's just amazing in every way possible

**dynamicity** (10): One of the greatest concept changes in the history of kpop.

**Maybe9** (10): 💃💃💃💃

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): a whole 10

**Qwilphish** (10): perhaps one of the greatest glowups in kpop history.

**ralah** (10): would have almost been my 11 point song

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**ryokann** (10): song of the year

**sailormunelune** (10): a turning point in their career

**therokinrolla** (10): This is one of those high-brow Kpop songs that I absolutely adore. It's magnificently composed, every ounce of it: that mood-setting spoken intro, the winding voice-like synth, its all so clean and artfully made in a way that seems befitting of Popheads favorites like Robyn. The artistic merit of Kpop is kinda indubitable when this song exists.

**Qustomar** (9.5): just a solid pop song with a bit of that trop-house influence, but crafted in a way to make a perfect gay catnip banger yes

**radiofan15** (9.5): That chorus... whew chile... the iconicness jumped out

**untutorable** (9): i'm so sick of lying.... and pretending this isn't a BANGER! i love love love this sound from apink. it's very on trend for the time it was released but imo it was a standout!

**rickikardashian** (8.6): insert coronavirus joke

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): this song having everybody SHOOK is one of the most iconic Kpop moments of the past few years, but I must admit it never did much for me

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): what a turning point! that's herstory sweetie

**wavingwolves** (8): the way they consistently serve bop after bop and don't ask anything in return... we don't deserve apink

**AnimationJava** (7): I like the pulsing beat a lot!

**MrSwearword** (7): they did legit try something here. I don't know what but I can commend some kind of effort.

**fadedblue09** (5.8): A bit caught off guard by the sudden switch in style. As for the song, they serve vocally, but there's too much going on here I don't think it's worth revisiting very much.

**bespectacIed** (10): LET'S DAWNCE !!!!! **Horny horns**. The queens of summer shunned the typical bright Sistar brand in summer 2016 with this funky, sensual number, and we were 100% overjoyed. I know that Sistar owned summer and cancelled it forever when they disbanded, but oddly enough this sensual bop is my favorite Sistar track of all time. Who said that summer bops should only be beachy and sunny? Sistar said you WILL pop your pussy to rose petals and white cotton laundry, and you WILL **like that**.

**agentofscranton** (6): SISTAR's final track in the rate leaves us just as we crack into the top 15. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that I personally disagree with it being the best SISTAR track offered up in the rate, I personally get bored by the end of it, but it's hard to argue against how much that chorus slaps.

 THEE Queens of Summer. Also, the Streaming Queens --- and that's not just a made-up title, they're literally the most streamed girl group of 2nd Gen if that one r/kpop post I read is credible lol. Sistar's impact and massive success in k-pop is undeniable, they soundtrack-ed kpop fans’ lives with countless club bangers and sexy bops, led by the best vocalist of 2nd generation k-pop (this is reddit user bespectacIed's personal opinion and doesn't reflect the views of the sub). Sadly, especially at the tail end of their career, SISTAR became Hyolyn and friends, but as a unit, these girls gave us some of the sexiest and most inescapable k-pop bops of all time. Summer will forever be cold and incomplete without your ass-shaking anthems, queens.

The moment it all started for our girls, and it's impact is still felt beyond the boundaries of k-pop, this song is a bonafide protest anthem - from being blared out loud at pro-abortion and women's rights marches and pride parades, to being sung by students arm in arm at a peaceful protest. I don't even know what they're singing but I'd be lying if I said this song didn't make me well up.

**bespectacIed** (6): A song that deserves the tag “cultural reset” as it introduced us to the biggest group of this era in k-pop. The turn-of-the-millennium teen pop debut from SNSD is a song played at weddings … graduations ... funerals ... every female idol audition and dance practice …  and even at serious political protests. But I am ashamed to admit, I am not the biggest fan of this!!! (sue me). I LOVE THE FINAL CHORUS I SWEAR. I acknowledge what it meant to SNSD’s career and its undeniable impact on k-pop, but for me, Into the New World is a tad too cheesy, with a production that is too stuck in the generation it precedes. Good thing my opinion doesn’t matter much because you made this bop sit pretty in Day 3

#Pink Ocean
**heeyeon** (11): maybe not their best song musically speaking but probably their most important. holds a very special place in my heart. i literally start crying from the very first note. do yourselves a favor and read the lyrics

**1998tweety** (10): A classic...that was a classic

**2l82bstr8** (10): it's really hard to objectively rate this song because it's SO important. this is the blueprint. k-pop would not exist without this song. thankfully it's incredible so I can give it a 10 for quality as well. and the lyrics are SO beautiful and poignant for the world we're currently facing. with its thumping drums and swells and shouting, it's a march into the future

**DaBigBoi** (10): The song that started it all...

**gabcac** (10): Best debut song ever

**hiramutsu** (10): Rite of passage for girl groups. Heartfelt lyrics. A symbol of change. Would've given 11 for live ballad version of this.

**nowqueenofpop** (10): When stans talk about iconic debut songs, absolutely no song touches Into The New World. We can call ITNW iconic and have it actually mean something! So many groups learned this song during training and so many have covered this song. When I hear the chorus, I actually start getting emotional and there’s something so powerful about it!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): A timeless debut; literally set the blueprint. A literal anthem.

**selegend** (10): this is the best song of all time

**SFbby** (10): They're babiesssssss

**therokinrolla** (10): A gay anthem, THE kpop gay anthem. It's very endearing in so many ways, including the as-of-yet unbeaten choreo and Taeyeon being magical during every second of the song (especially the lives). The belted harmonies during the chorus are to die for and quite frankly this song just sounds like a classic without it even needing to be said.

**untutorable** (10): probably the best debut song ever?? it makes me so happy....

**wavingwolves** (10): the most important song on kpop i think... the way people in korea actually sing this when they protest... the way every kpop girlgroup has a version of it... can you imagine anything more iconic than this? i really can't

**Qustomar** (9.5): does this song make you feel nothing or are you normal

**Unprettiest** (9.5): not my fave but what an impact it has made

**Qwilphish** (9): a political anthem, the score is boosted based on its modern significance but I will still always sing along to it so it has that going for it. NGG song right of passage. and THAT KICK legends only

**taeneon** (9): okay i'm a huge sone so maybe i'm biased but one of if not The best debut song

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): such a great debut tbh. im not a huge fan of SNSD but i will not deny how incredible this song is!

**cutefuss** (8.5): not the best song of all time, BUT the best girl group debut song of all time

**JohnnyToby** (8.5): Im just about to start giving 10s aren't I

**alwayswords** (8): a classic

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Did it just get iconic up in here? “Atlantis Princess” outsold though

**rotating3Dtext** (8): oh I enjoy how relatively simple this is

**smile-on-crayon** (8): I can see this song being part of Step Up's soundtrack, or part of any soundtrack to a movie about love and dance.

**twat_brained** (8): Into a new generation of kpop more like! A GIRLS’ generation!!!!! (i know i’m lame)

**AnimationJava** (7.5): Wow! Surprisingly a very clean and fresh track considering it was released in 2007!

**Maybe9** (7): its sounds ancient, im surprised at how good it is

**sarcasticsobs** (7): oh god its so cheesy but i like it??

**radiofan15** (6.7): This sounds like the ending of a mid-2000s anime...

**fadedblue09** (6.6): Cute, nostalgic ballad.

#Black Ocean

**dynamicity** (6): Pleasant enough but definitely one of their less interesting songs.

**rickikardashian** (5.8): this sounds like a generic song made for an inspirational latin american teen soap opera

**MrSwearword** (1): this squeaky clean sound...iCannot

hyogurt: Not in the top 10??? My brain cannot compute. SNSD did not rehearse this same song every single day for an entire year to be robbed like this. The girlies today are NOT and CANNOT do it like SNSD did in ITNW live performances. The dancing alone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9vBgHD4MDE

**agentofscranton** (10): AYO GG! SNSD could do Bohemian Rhapsody but Queen couldn't do I Got A Boy. The absolute pinnacle of k-pop's tendency to get batshit insane with it's song structures. It's still insane to me that this is all one song. It's almost a jarring listening experience which is why I'm not too shocked at how it's placed outside of the top 10, but I Got A Boy deserved top 10 because of just that - listening to it is an EXPERIENCE. I don't think it can be repeated enough just how absolutely insane this song is. All popheads should listen to this song, at least once in their lives. A moment most pleasing to music in it's existence.

**bespectacIed** (10): The was SHOCKED that this was the eventual rank of the Bohemian Rhapsody of k-pop. I thought that it really had the potential to win, but in the end I kinda understand the polarizing reviews since this song is jarring and delirious as fuck in the best way possible. The beat switches accentuated by Tiffany and Jessica's iconic English lines is what inspired Travis Scott to start a career (this is the truth, I won’t take further questions). The genre switches made Freddie Mercury clap his cheeks in heaven. There's really nothing more to describe this song other than game-changing. Sooyoung was right from the first second of this song: it's game over for everyone else. AYO, GG

---

**alwayswords** (11): this song shouldn’t work but it does

**Maybe9** (11): definition kpop, 15 genres in a song and each one is perfect

**skargardin** (11): Iconic bop right here

**therokinrolla** **(11): One of the reasons I love Kpop is it's willing to be so boldly pop in a way Western music just isn't often (thank you Dua for changing this however). Being boldly pop isn't about just being a simple, sweet pop tune, it's about experimenting with what makes a hook a hook, what is catchy, what isn't and doing something new to create a unique listening experience. A lot of pop recent years tried distinguishing itself by being... profoundly unpoppy (hello Camila Cabello). SNSD always went the extra mile in that regard, and IGAB is the shining jewel of sugar pop experimentation. It isn't an exaggeration to say this album has 3 different genres in it, nor is it an exaggeration to say there's a double-digit amount of sections. The hooks in the song turn and twist like taffy, letting each of the different sections lead into each other in different ways. The 30 second rap intro leading into that heavy, guitar-like synth? Powerful. "Let's bring it back to 140"? Mind boggling. The power ballad section right in the middle that leads into the infamous "140" section? A God send. That's the genius of this song, it's not just that there's so any different sections, it's the way they combine them like Lego's, artfully adding them on top of each other, just to yank them out and replace them again. Then, by the end, nearly every motif throughout the song returns for a triumphant last 30 seconds of one of the most incredibly written pop songs ever. It's magnificent.**

**1998tweety** (10): Their best song don't @ me. Only SNSD could effortlessly make a song this wild and pull it off. This is literally one for the history books. Songs like this will forever solidify that SM is the best of the Big 3 (or Big 4 lmao).

**2l82bstr8** (10): this is a whole experience. I feel like this song shaped SO MUCH of what current k-pop looks like - it's strange, colorful, quirky, fun, and absurdly catchy.

**_Doh_** (10): the definition of musical storytelling

**Agusarg** (10): Absolutely iconic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna have the highest controversy score because some of y'all have your ass in your ears but this is MAGNIFICENT! don't stop, let's bring this song to the top 3

**JohnnyToby** (10): only getting a 10 because this was one of the first videos I saw when my home got internet...imagine the shock my Christian ass had

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): ICONIC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXUlTINA0ks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXUlTINA0ks)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): how is this ONE song?

**Shinkopeshon** (10): This is such a ballsy, varied and experimental piece and it succeeds in everything it intends to achieve. Truly a masterpiece.

**smile-on-crayon** (10): What SM tried to achieve with f(x)'s "Red Light" was achieved with "I Got A Boy". The thing is though, he didn't stop trying after.

**twat_brained** (10): “don’t stop. Let’s bring it back to 140” I don’t know why I’m still doing this rate, SNSD have already proved themselves more than worthy superstars when it comes to KPop’s finest.

**wavingwolves** (10): the AYO STOP! LEMME PUT DOWN ANOTHER WAY it's so meta it's genius. this is a song that couldn't be done by any western artist

**Qwilphish** (9.5): their performance definitely sells this frankensteins monster of a song. no less than 6 songs mashed up and it works????? barely but so iconic

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): they literally reset the whole culture back to 140

**waluigiest** (9): this self-referential dynamism is next level

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Paved the way for the puzzle piece noise pop that we would come to love just a few years later. She does not let you rest from start to finish!

**taeneon** (8): the songs a mess but the mv is cute and as a sone I wish I could go back to this time

**AnimationJava** (7.5): The breakdown and switchup of the beat made the song a better experience for me! Super catchy and fun.

**cutefuss** (7.3): when they won the youtube video award for this and everyone got mad <3

**rickikardashian** (6.2): listen what's up with these kpop songs that can't decide what sound they want to have?

**gabcac** (6): 6

**Unprettiest** (5.3): is youtube still tiffany's best friend?

**heeyeon** (4): thanks i hate it

**fadedblue09** (3): I'm sorry, I know this is iconic but this is just too much at once at every angle. I liked certain elements in some parts, but overall not really worth it.

**MrSwearword** (1): it's just really unpleasant



#MAMA

**radiofan15** (11): A cultural RESET if there was ever one... truly the Bohemian Rhapsody of k-pop

**SFbby** (11): Girls' Gen's very own version of Bohemian Rhapsody effortlessly wanes in and out of several genres to create a behemoth of a song that can be replayed over and over without being repetitive. Also the Jessica and Tiffany improvs were friendship goals

**Qustomar** (10): outsold bohemian rhapsody

**dynamicity** (9): Is it really the Bohemian Rhapsody of pop? Probably not, but it's still a wild ride.

[/r/popheads/comments/gpwsw5/the_kpop_retirement_home_rate_day_3_popheads/frssyaq/]

hyogurt: The pros: it garnered a lot of Western media attention and praise for its experimentation thereby spreading the international recognition of k-pop, Tiffany's YouTube Video Awards speech, the choreo by Nappytabs, the live performances cutting out the unnecessary rock part and skipping straight to Jessica's bridge...


The cons: everything else. Despite being at their peak popularity, the album sales did not come close to "The Boys" despite IGAB having 10 (TEN!!!) different versions and that is a testament to its messiness. Longtime fans and members of the general public were very turned off by this. The meltdowns. The meltdowns. The meltdowns. It paved the way for negative opinions of SNSD to permeate the mainstream in the Korean media which snowballed throughout the rest of the year and well into 2014.

And in this installment of k-pop fun facts, a supposed insider guy came on the k-pop forums at the time claiming to have the English version MV for "IGAB" but he wanted money and we laughed him off. Looking back, I think he might have been telling the truth because this screencap he shared exists nowhere else (?) that I've seen: https://i.imgur.com/6PyXkUw.jpg

**bespectacIed** (10): KARA’s first song after the departure of key members Nicole and Jiyoung is a reaffirmation of their brand of infectious dance bops overlayed on synth beats. Not gonna lie, I am pretty surprised that Mamma Mia placed this high in the rate and beat so many iconic songs, but I am fucking ecstatic that it did! Mamma Mia is a euphoric, disco-inspired pop perfection with soaring vocals, and a song with even a lick of disco will never NOT do well at a popheads rate.

**agentofscranton** (9): Like my co-host I'm really shocked this made it this far? But I'm not disappointed! Mamma Mia is an absolute mammoth of a song - a Step on steroids if you will - and to see it beat some arguably more iconic songs and rightfully place so high was a real joy to witness!

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): One of the biggest gems of the rate, this song makes me lose my mind every time I hear it right from that dynamic opening to that explosive finish. There’s just so many great lines and addictive melodies crammed in this song!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ABBA are quaking

**DaBigBoi** (10): Mario probably bops to this

**radiofan15** (10): THIS IS POWERFUL OMG

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**selegend** (10): i wanna give this my 11 so bad

**taeneon** (10): fun and upbeat which is my fav kind of kpop

**waluigiest** (10): massive massive bop omfg

**wavingwolves** (10): they murdered abba's whole career with this one... a cultural reset

**twat_brained** (9.3): I get it, that's the name of a classic disco hit so they took disco influence on this song. And by Godney did they work it in their favor.

**Shinkopeshon** (9.2): This is amazing. It goes high energy from the start and it only keeps getting better from there. But unfortunately, getting to Kara's MVs is again a bittersweet listening and viewing experience because of what happened with Goo Hara. I hope something like this will never happen again.

**alwayswords** (9): abba is thinking...

**dynamicity** (9): I think this might be the greatest intro of all time.

**MrSwearword** (9): I respect the consistent energy of this group and this is probably [I'd wager anyway] their best song

**smile-on-crayon** (9): We gon' keep on dancing

**1998tweety** (8.5): Big bop

**JohnnyToby** (8.5): I can only think of the Bibian gif

**rickikardashian** (8.5): that 80s sound synth in the back? amazing

**rotating3Dtext** (8): don’t know if I love or hate the casio keyboard sounds (?) but the chorus is so catchy

**Maybe9** (7): if this song had better production, ijs

**Qwilphish** (7): theres something lacking here. its definitely not bad but im not excited by it

**2l82bstr8** (5): don't really like the melodies here, and the songs just sounds flat to me.

**AnimationJava** (5): I found the instrumental on this song to be grating but otherwise the vocals were pretty

**fadedblue09** (4.9): Indistinguishable from their other songs.

**cutefuss** (3.8): god i did not like this song much which broke my heart as an abba fan. damaged lady however...

**agentofscranton** (10): This song, for the first 45 voters, was locked firmly in the top 10 where it deserved to be, but unfortunately, as more and more votes came pouring in, RPPP just couldn't keep up with the songs that outpeaked it. It lands here just outside the top 10. There's a very definitive shift towards the better in f(x)'s career post-Rum Pum Pum Pum. This is, in my honest opinion, the best song to come out of f(x)'s discography. It also stems out of the phenomenal Pink Tape album which is just all killer no filler. One of the very best k-pop albums.

**bespectacIed** (10): As a f(x) stan, I divide their short career into two eras: 2009-2012, where they served exclusively as an edgy foil for SNSD, and 2013-2016, where they separated from the pack by becoming the girl group in k-pop with the strongest discography. Rum Pum Pum Pum is truly a “something shifted, shits about to get weird” moment for f(x), because from this point onwards, this group will ONLY release classics. RPPP is pop excellence; it’s the title track of what many k-pop fans consider as the best k-pop album of all time, and the jumpstarter of the iconic Pink Tape - Red Light - 4 Walls three album run. We’re glad that it did this well on the rate!

**Agusarg** (10): It sounds so incredible and unique, a masterpiece. Those guitar riffs are on another level

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is one of the most interestingly crafted pop songs of any hemisphere or decade tbh. the rounds, the guitar work, the harmonies... everything about this is so exquisitely intricate yet it never feels fussy. it's just incredible, perfect pop

**letsallpoo** (10): this BETTER be their highest ranking song. that pre chorus is pure excellence

**MrSwearword** (10): it's bouncy and cute

**Qustomar** (10): everything about the production is so immaculate and unique, i have never been able to find a song similar to this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**selegend** (10): one of the best songs of all time

**twat_brained** (10): So can we call this the Kpop version of Little Mix’s “A Different Beat”?

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): that drumbeat bridge is what dreams are made of. it's so satisfying on the ears! this song just goes everywhere and never loses its thread

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.8): Finally f(x) figure out what to do with themselves… I love the weird “twisted spaghetti western” vibe of this song

**1998tweety** (8.5): Big bop

**cutefuss** (8.5): that part in the round where it sounds like they're saying 'sailor moon' > the beatles' discography

**Qwilphish** (8.5): mv in a box strikes again so funky though

**untutorable** (8.5): that bass line takes me OUT!! also this is the f(x) song that has grown on me the most over the years ugh it's so good

**AnimationJava** (8): The strings and instrumental on this were really good!

**dynamicity** (8): One of their most interesting title tracks, even if not the catchiest.

**taeneon** (8): finally decent styling

**wavingwolves** (8): definitely their best by a long shot

**fadedblue09** (7.9): Love the guitar strumming here.

**radiofan15** (7.3): It sounds... exotic... at least I think that's the idea...

**Maybe9** (6): i counted the notes, there was 1

**JohnnyToby** (4): tbh the weakest song on the album it never clicked

**agentofscranton** (10): My first reaction to this song was that it sounded exactly like The Urge by SAARA (aka the song I submitted for Finland in popheads Eurovision 2), turns out she actually co-wrote this song! Small world and all that. Beyond that, there's not much to say for this song other than that it's an absolute slapper of a song, and by far my favourite song that Tiffany has released in her career.

**bespectacIed** (6): The way that the top 2 of the bonus rate are both synth-pop songs by SM Entertainment soloists released in the summer of 2016 … how ~~predictab~~ iconic! IJWD is a fun, “white girl from Cali” dance track that would offend nobody, but I've always been underwhelmed by the production and lyrics of this song. I’m glad Tiffany outdid her debut with her post-SM singles.

**1998tweety** (10): She always serves, a gay icon

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i know she likes being independent or whatever but ugh this sound was so GOOD

**dlong5665** (10): i can’t believe fany released the best solo of all the snsd members

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I hope this wins the bonus rate.

**heeyeon** (10): i will defend this song until the day i die

**JohnnyToby** (10): YUP

**ralah** (10): unfortunately their group stuff was better for the most part

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**SFbby** (10): I stan Tiffany so hard but also look at her doing ab exercises

**smile-on-crayon** (10): A proper dance song. Honestly, it's my type of music. Could do without saying the title of the song in the chorus though. It's lazy and cliché.

**wavingwolves** (10): yes queen go off

**gabcac** (9.6): this deserved better

**Unprettiest** (9.5): if you like this song, listen to Stray Love by Dizzy Dizzo

**Agusarg** (9): Amazing vocals

**Qustomar** (9): tiffany could do emotion, but carly couldn't do i just wanna dance

**radiofan15** (8.3): You can't convince this isn't one of the 200 songs Carly wrote for Emotion...

**AnimationJava** (8): I really liked the carefree and relaxed message of this song! Tiffany Young just wants to dance and enjoy her life, man.

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): the production on this is next level, but I feel like Tiffany is the wrong person for this song? it feels like she's working against the song in every turn

**cutefuss** (7.4): cute but forgettable.

**hiramutsu** (7): Tiffany is great, but this ain't it.

**MrSwearword** (7): fine for what it is

**fadedblue09** (6.7): I remember hearing this before, and I'll probably forget this again after this.

**dynamicity** (6.5): I love the remix but the original is just sooooooo slow.

**skargardin** (6): Kinda generic but a bop nontheless

**untutorable** (6): i think i'm the only person on earth who doesn't fuck with this song super hard!! maybe it's because this song is about dancing and tiffany is not known for dancing..... omg this song was a cry for help

**agentofscranton** (10): This was never not gonna win lol, and I'm glad it did! It's an absolute megabop, and dare I say from a quick browse at the English lyrics, a gay anthem? This self-love and self-empowerment ditty was almost never not on the top of the bonus rate leaderboard - it's only stint not at the top being a brief stint in third in the 10-15 voters area, but beyond that f(x)'s Luna absolutely had us gheys by the throat with this one.

**bespectacIed** (10): A deep house, dance-pop track, winning a rate in r/popheads? Shocking! I had no doubt that the song from f(x)'s main vocalist will be well-received in the bonus rate, but I didn't expect it to beat out some of the more iconic solos in this rate. But I am extremely happy it did, because Free Somebody is a stunning, well-produced k-pop house track with a really creative music video to boot. It's a shame that Luna has fallen below the radar of k-pop soloists, because her solo discography is excellent, varied, and super well-sung. Check out her song [Do You Love Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXDwvvoCRwc), come back to me, and I dare you to tell me Luna isn't one of the best soloists out there. Stan ~~Loona~~ Luna!

**untutorable** (10): perfect song and mini album she did it for the gays

**cutefuss** (9.5): i love this song and it's inventive music video so much. i wish luna would return to this style of music.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): if by “somebody” you mean “my ass to start shaking” then you succeeded bitch!

**Qustomar** (9): ldn noise kinda made the same UK house song over and over for a while but i don't mind

**wavingwolves** (9): f(x)'s girls solos (not you amber) > f(x)'s entire discography

**radiofan15** (8.6): Coming for Kylie's crown...

**AnimationJava** (8.5): The production and mixing on this song are easily the best part, but the well-trained vocals of Luna are a very nice touch.

**fadedblue09** (7.9): Not the type of dance-pop I go for, but still fun.

**Qwilphish** (7.5): luna said let my people go

**smile-on-crayon** (7.5): I like her voice in the EDM genre, it just works. It's also powerful, I know of too few Kpop singers that can do genres like this justice. Her other song on the same album, "Galaxy", showcases that much more.

**agentofscranton** (11): So we say goodbye to Orange Caramel, and also the first song to ever hit number one in the rate! Also, my 11. This is not just the greatest k-pop song of all time, this is the single greatest song of all time. No I am not taking questions. It's also my island tune on Animal Crossing. It's absolutely batshit insane in just the most perfect way. Eurodisco-inspired instrumental, with a prominent Punjabi sample, all clearly inspired by Japanese culture, with a music video that also takes inspiration from Korean comedy, such massive culture clashes shouldn't work but it does because that's the beauty of a genre that also allows I Got A Boy to exist! It's camp k-pop at it's campiest and god how I wish k-pop artists were still willing to get this weird and bizarre with their concepts.

**bespectacIed** (10): K-pop camp at its finest! Orange Caramel has always eschewed After School’s brand of high-femme in favor of weirdness, and it worked the best with the creative, infectious, and utterly unique Catallena. Everything about this song screams crackhead: the sashimi inspired video, the girlish vocals, the random but totally effective Punjabi wedding song sample, and of course, the most iconic ""HAH"" of all time!!! This sub-unit gave us one of the trippiest, most hilarious, most iconic k-pop songs of all time, and a virtually immortal meme. Honestly this to me is a top 5 best k-pop song ever. Catellena is pure genius, I’m glad of its high ranking in the rate.

---

#Caramel (you decide what you think is the ok pronunciation)
**cutefuss** (11): it had to be her, from the visuals to the song to the performances catallena was not just great music it was exceptional kpop, it was everything the genre can be which makes it deserving of my one and only 11

**dlong5665** (11): invented music sushi and screaming

**Unprettiest** (11): the world was not ready for orange caramel, oye hoi hoi

**1998tweety** (10): Camp masterpiece

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): an iconic quirky bop! that bollywood sample is pure genius, and the whole song is just so well crafted and just AAAAAH i love it

**DaBigBoi** (10): Stan seafood

**dynamicity** (10): This song just oozes charisma. It goes on a bit long, but the presence of an intro and 2 bridges helps keep things fresh throughout.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I remember reading an article or something that described this song as a showcase of all the potential of what Kpop can be when it fully embraces what makes it so unique and I fully agree. There are a lot of good and interesting sounding songs on this list but if someone asked me to show them something that showed that Kpop had its own identity, it would be this. Fun, creative, polished, weird, it’s absolutely everything.

**heeyeon** (10): HA

**MrSwearword** (10): a legendary song, a weird as shit music video, mashup heaven with Hung Up, WHEW we love quality music.

**nowqueenofpop** (10): K-POP PERFECTION. This is the aural equivalent to a shot of adrenaline straight to the cerebrum

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**SFbby** (10): Bless the person who made the giant post of kpop groups/songs and included the link to the hah compilation cause I go back to it at least once a week

**twat_brained** (10): disco pop simply never goes out of style does it

**Maybe9** (9.5): an iconic song and an even more iconic mv

**Agusarg** (9): The cutsy vocals rubbed me the wrong way at first, but the more the song played the more it sold me. It's honestly a bop, It's catchy, dumb, and sounds great.

**rickikardashian** (9): LMAO THIS IS THE SONG FROM THAT VIDEO

**untutorable** (9): even though orange caramel's success killed their main group (yes it did i'm not trying to argue it's just reality) they were constantly fun and refreshing and goofy like they had to have read notes on camp for this shit and if you don't enjoy it idk what to tell you

**JohnnyToby** (8.5): go watch the ioi cover

**Qustomar** (8.5): look at the material!!! but i think the song really is dependent on the music video/choreography

**Shinkopeshon** (8.3): Insanely funky and even without the MV, colourful and just a ton of fun.

**_Doh_** (8): HA!

**radiofan15** (7.9): Kylie Minogue is... doing fine, but she kinda got worried for a second

#Caramel (you decide what you think is the not ok pronunciation)
**alwayswords** (7.5): overrated

**taeneon** (7): HAAAAAA

**gannade** (4): oh hoih hoihi hoihioi

**sarcasticsobs** (4): oh my god i have seen meme live clips of the opening of this like 10 times THIS is what it’s from?? also the fuck did I just watch?

**fadedblue09** (2): Wow this is all over the place. Also, the vocals are low-key grating, I prefer their members who aren’t in this sub-unit I guess.

**Overall Average**: 7.739 **// Average Controversy:** 1.800

 First of all, FUCK PLEDIS! The unnies to the also criminally mistreated Pristin, After School and their sub-unit, Orange Caramel never stood a chance despite their catalogue of absolute back to back bangers. There's so many songs I wish we could've included in this rate - Shampoo? Because of You? Magic Girl? 10s 10s 10s across the board! - and they should've both been bigger than they were. But there's only so much you can do with a shitty company behind you., Nothing else to say but FUCK PLEDIS!!!! After School could have been bigger than they are, yet you really cannot do anything if your company is shitty. Nonetheless, After School and its sub-units provided us with some of the fiercest anthems of this generation. They deserved better :(

---
**dynamicity** (10.000): Um where are all of Orange Caramel's better songs like Bangkok City and Shanghai Romance and Lipstick?

**2l82bstr8** (9.167): we really got the best of both worlds with them - After School gave us the pop bangers and Orange Caramel gave us whatever it is that was, and I loved them both. also Nana is still the most beautiful woman in k-pop and I've yet to be proven otherwise

**twat_brained** (8.967): I remember the latter but not the former for some unknown reason. Go figure.

**therokinrolla** (8.500): I never actually paid them much attention before this rate, but their songs are really good? I don't get much identity from After School but Orange Caramel has it ENOUGH, and they have some really cute bops I think I'm gonna stan after this.

**Ceinic** (8.067): Shampoo would've been easy 10

**smile-on-crayon** (8.000): I did not know that they were related; TIL.

**rickikardashian** (7.933): so are they different groups or the same? what’s the truth

**cutefuss** (7.867): the best and most underrated performance oriented group in kpop. full stop. call me when a boy group learns to pole dance for their comeback.

**selegend** (7.333): theyre cute

**NuneEtsuko** (5.333): First Love would've gotten a pretty darn high score from me, unfortunately, it's the only AS song I like.

**fadedblue09** (5.300): The 3 singles picked here give….very different vibes from each other?? Idk...I can’t sense a signature style or whatever.

hyogurt: I know it's popular to say "AfterSchool deserved more from Pledis." Yes, that's very true... we all know that. But they also deserve more credit for popularizing girl group sub-units in the first place with Orange Caramel, AS Red, and AS Blue. SNSD TaeTiSeo's Twinkle album concept and Rainbow Pixie were both lifted directly from Orange Caramel's playbook.

**agentofscranton** (10): Thus we cut the final KARA song in the rate! It's just eternally danceable isn't it? You can't have a bad time listening to Step, and I'm glad popheads for the most part agrees. It was a little bit of a shame to see KARA drop out of the top 5 - and momentarily out of the top 10 - but I'm happy to see it earn it's rightful place here amongst the other k-pop greats.

**bespectacIed** (10): Is there a more joyous k-pop song out there than Step? This upbeat, La Roux-like synthpop/EDM track with a color explosion of a music video is one of Kara’s biggest hits (and Kara’s most viewed song on Youtube). KARA always has a catchy electronic/synth riff that makes every song they make seep into the deepest corners of your brain. In my eyes, this superb, highly successful track was literally Kara’s reminder to their 2nd Gen peers to step it the fuck up! It is KARA’s signature hit for a reason, and I’m glad that this sub gave it the respect it deserved.

**Ceinic** (11): (G.O.A.T)

**MasterGrammar** (11): song of the decade

**1998tweety** (10): Okay this is excellence

**2l82bstr8** (10): one of the best club anthems k-pop has to offer. it captures the fun and carefree sumemr anthem feel like few other songs in the genre manage to.

**cutefuss** (10): would've gotten my 11 if the music video outfits (as iconic as they are) weren't objectively hideous - step loses out when it comes to dated visuals but is an otherwise perfect song

**dlong5665** (10): step on my face honestly

**MrSwearword** (8): it's cutesy but I like the bounciness enough to spare it

**twat_brained** (7.4): that beat switch into the key change made an otherwise great song into just like every other kpop song out there. Still a rather popping tune, just not quite what I've come to expect from this rate.

**Overall Average**: 8.071 **// Average Controversy:** 1.638

 Queens of iconic dance hits and being both Korean and Japanese juggernauts! As successors to their seniors Fin.K.L (one of the biggest 1st gen girl groups), KARA helped keep DSP as one of the biggest companies of 2nd Gen with their fun pop hits and perennially viral choreography. With their career plagued by too many contract issues and member controversies, punctuated by the unfortunate thing that happened last year, we remember KARA from a more bittersweet lens. Nonetheless, KARA is still undeniably at the top of the K-pop 2nd Gen echelon. P.S. We love you, Hara!

---
**dynamicity** (9.500): The group that got me into kpop.

**Qustomar** (9.250): their legacy has been unfairly forgotten. the top kpop gg of japan in the 2nd gen along with snsd. high-quality, dramatic and fun pop bop after bop. phew

**therokinrolla** (9.250): Kara's brand of disco-inflected party romps is so delicious to me. It strikes the perfect balance of mildly corny and absolutely megatronic cycotronic got my blueprint its symphonic

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.050): Such an underrated group, I think they had a more distinctly “European” sound that helped them stand out and their music has aged pretty decently all things considered. They always delivered fantastic dance pop!

**hiramutsu** (8.750): Just realized how much I like their music when rating them

**twat_brained** (8.575): don't know them, don't expect to remember them but hopefully they're at least on Apink's level.

**Unprettiest** (8.225): Wanna = BEST SONG

**smile-on-crayon** (8.000): Kpop can be a tough business and everything just really tried to put down KARA, they failed and KARA kept on. May your soul live on forever, Goo Hara.

**2l82bstr8** (7.500): bop after bop after bop. they don't get the credit they deserve.

**cutefuss** (7.100): these queens deserved more than they got, particularly hara. rip angel.

**fadedblue09** (5.725): Maybe there's a reason why I don't hear them very much….

**agentofscranton** (9): Was there ever any real doubt that this would be 2NE1's final song in the rate? It's one of the most well-known songs that k-pop has to offer and duh of course it is, look at the material! This 3 and a half minute auditory assault is serve on serve on serve. Not to mention that iconique music video! I think about CL in that pink jacket on that revolving platform with that big fuckin black diamond at least once a day. During the early parts of this rate, I was GAGGED that this song was not only not cracking the top 10, but slowly dropping further into day 2. As a host, I was ready for the messery, but as someone who loves this song, I'm glad it did eventually claw it's way into it's rightful spot in the top 10.

**bespectacIed** (4): I went to this rate expecting I Am The Best, 2NE1’s signature song (@ me if you disagree) to do well and be 2NE1’s highest-ranking song, and lo and behold, here it is!!! I Am The Best is a proud declaration of a monster girl group at the peak of their careers, a pure servery of the music/style that made them such a giant figure in kpop. 2NE1 OWNED their market in k-pop for a couple of years, and this megahit is their exclamation point. Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of this song. Its sound really doesn’t separate itself from the myriad of EDM hits that year. For what it’s worth, “Naega jeil jal naga” is an iconic hook that will randomly pop in my head at the most random times until I die

---

#naega jeil jal naga
**fifteensunflwrs** (11): ICONIC!!!!

**rotating3Dtext** (11): This song. It was the first k-pop I ever heard without really knowing what it was. A friend saw a choreo to this song online and wanted to cover it for my school’s dance competition and I was in charge of editing the song down to just the parts she would use and I edited it exactly like she needed and every detail of this bop became ingrained in my brain. So, yeah.

**2l82bstr8** (10): this is 2NE1 at their absolute peak. everything that worked for them was combined and distilled into the wonderful braggadocious fever dream that is this song

**alwayswords** (10): [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676645931793252363/696576702649991208/20111007_ninadobrev_2ne1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676645931793252363/696576702649991208/20111007_ninadobrev_2ne1.png)

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): IF THIS BAD BITCH FEELING YOURSELF ANTHEM ISNT TOP 3 IM SUING

**dynamicity** (10): The first time I heard this song I thought: "who on Earth thinks this is GOOD?" And then 10 minutes later I found myself typing it back into the Youtube search bar again. And again. And again.

**fadedblue09** (10): I'm prepared for this to win, even though it's not my favorite.

**gabcac** (10): so new kpop fans will never know how iconic this is. Best 2ne1 song

**JohnnyToby** (10): !!!!

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): easy 10

**radiofan15** (10): you know songs like that they are stories that people can identify with you know what I mean anybody children were singing this song at graduations at weddings at funerals

**ralah** (10): mandatory for kpop karaoke nights

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): naega jeil jal naga

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this was the first 2NE1 song i ever heard and its still the best (ha)

**skargardin** (10): what a BOP

**wavingwolves** (10): a olympic song

**Qustomar** (9.5): a classic song though ive listened to it so many times over the years that it doesn't hit the same. however there rlly is still no kpop song that hits like this one does you know, it's on another level

**Qwilphish** (9.5): easily one of the most iconic songs of this rate, it must be respected and anyone who doesn't *electric chair*

**MasterGrammar** (9): Bum ratatata tatatatata

**Maybe9** (9): if you cant hear this song just from reading the title, you havent lived

**selegend** (9): one of the most iconic kpop songs of all time

**1998tweety** (8.5): The one singular point they ever made in their entire career

**twat_brained** (8.5): you are not the best. Girls' Generation is the best. I give credit for bridging the gap between the Middle East and the Far East with this song

**NuneEtsuko** (8.3): Although this is not particularly my favorite song of theirs but I can see why it's their biggest hit, this is such a jam and easily gets stuck in the head on repeat.

**cutefuss** (8.2): i would argue this may be the most iconic 2nd gen girl group song in the west in the sense that even people who have never heard of kpop tend to recognize it. doesn't hurt that it's a banger.

**_Doh_** (8): Iconic

**rickikardashian** (8): there's a segment that sounds exactly like Russian Roulette, and it scares me because those 2 songs are not more different because it isn't possible

**untutorable** (8): i mean what is there to say that the title does not already state.......

**Unprettiest** (7.7): CL best WWE champion

**taeneon** (7): not really my style but so fucking iconic


#2NE1 - Hate You
**AnimationJava** (6): In a similar vein to Can't Nobody, it appeals to popheads' sense of pop but imo sounds aged in production.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Their last mini-album was so good and emotionally impactful, I don’t know why they decided to go back to doing the same thing they were doing before it but worse.

**MrSwearword** (1): nope. The sound is too dated and trashy for my liking

**MelodramaticLemonade** (0): Listening to their discography is like lying on a bed of nails, except this one sticks out six feet longer than others

 What is there to say about Blackpink's cool mums that hasn't already been said? One of the most legendary groups to come out of k-pop, with a clearly divisive discography. The undisputed queens of girl crush! FUCK YG!!, The Queens of Girl Crush! Blackpink's legendary aunts! (and source of song demos hehe pls don't kill me I stan Blackpink). 2NE1 brand of abrasive EDM production and chaotic fashion was a foil to the high-femme k-pop style of this era. Handled primarily by prolific k-pop producer Teddy Park, 2NE1 created a sound that is utterly singular, recognizable, and prone to replication. Personally, I have never been a huge 2NE1 fan, but I can’t deny their huge impact!!! The influence is far-reaching and still felt today, maybe that’s why k-pop fans will never stop crying out how they deserved so much better. Say it with me, FUCK YG!!!!!

**franch** (10.167): i'm a blink of course i like 2NE1....but these are legit some of their best songs how can i give anything a bad rating?

**dynamicity** (8.833): I love Blackpink but honestly they could never

**2l82bstr8** (8.500): they said it themselves - they ARE the best. who am I to argue?

**sarcasticsobs** (8.167): CL could most definitely kick my ass without trying and i’d let Dara do the same

**NuneEtsuko** (7.967): I really think there were some iconic songs missed that were also worthy of being in this rate; Missing You & Ugly are my favorite 2NE1 songs, a shame they weren't included. 2NE1 is as iconic as SNSD in term of top girl groups in Korea, so I would've loved if there were more of their songs here..

**fadedblue09** (7.733): They're probably the group I'm most familiar with. Expected to stan them hard but they surprisingly have a hit-or-miss discography.

**Qustomar** (7.333): ppl on kpop stan twt love to hate on them now but they had some quality songs, maybe they didn’t age well but idc

**hiramutsu** (7.333): Frankly, I'm not the biggest fan of their musics

**twat_brained** (7.033): this is one of 5 bands I knew prior to this rate. I hope they do well.

**smile-on-crayon** (6.000): One of the top groups who I could not get into in the slightest, but I can get appreciate their message though. I can see why they're up there.

**agentofscranton** (10): And just as quickly as they arrived, Brown Eyed Girls bow out as Abracadabra places 7th overall. This is PHENOMENAL. The absolute cuntiness that this song exudes is absolutely breathtaking. From the very first note, the girls have you by the throat and don't let go. The flazeda attitude of the i c o n i c dance only adds to the power of the song. Truly nobody does it like Brown Eyed Girls.

**bespectacIed** (10): This song spent most of the time at the top 10, which honestly was a shock to us hosts, but I applaud y’all for exhibiting taste with this one, Abracadabra truly is a phenomenal song. Not to sound like a k-pop hag who's stuck with 2nd Gen, but goddamnit, k-pop girl groups really don't do it like this no more!!!! Arguably B.E.G. 's most iconic song and one of the biggest hits of this generation, this autotune EDM track is also one of the most controversial releases in this rate. How the fuck did BEG get away with this super dark title track which includes boob fondling, bondage, and queerbaiting, I don't know!!! (seriously, that Narsha and Gain kiss bait caused an uproar in SK). All I care about is how iconic and magical^seewhatididthere this song is.

**2l82bstr8** (10): every part of this song is a chorus AND a hook. you'll never get it out of your head after listening to it for like 30 seconds. (and it's still one of the most iconic k-pop choreographies of all time!)

**dlong5665** (10): invented swaying your hips from side to side

**dynamicity** (10): An absolute earworm.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Undeniably the best “electro sexy” song in the rate, if Lady Gaga had released this it would have been everywhere

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): deserve nothing but 10

**NuneEtsuko** (10): I was really tempted to give this my 11 since it's such a good representation of great Kpop : Great hook, great dance and iconic song all around.

**Qustomar** (10): fame-era gaga type of beat but elevated to the heavens

**Qwilphish** (10): its ahead of its time. still sounds fresh 6irlies can release this today

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): i do not know if the hip swinging dance is supposed to be funny or not but oh god it cracks me up and i mean this in the best way, like “this is awesome, i love it”. i also don’t know why the autotune in this song doesn’t bother as much as it did in some 2NE1 songs

**taeneon** (10): i can't fault anything about this. the dance and visuals are peak kpop

**untutorable** (10): it was a cultural reset it was a fucking cultural reset!!

**Unprettiest** (8.3): edgy kpop aunts will forever slay

**twat_brained** (8.2): the song itself is great. What I don’t find so great is the queerbaiting in the video at the end. Also I was really confused at how many members there were since there were so many dancers in that white room.

**Agusarg** (8): What a banger

**radiofan15** (7.9): Jessie J remains unbothered... but they did a good job nonetheless

#Hocus Pocus

 The biggest thing I miss about 2nd Gen k-pop as I've come to love 3rd-Gen is the lack (not lack per se but just a bit of downgrade) of CUNTINESS of girl groups. B.E.G. is the definition of cunty to me, and is the face of femme fatalle in k-pop. Unabashed with their provocative image and defiant of the strict standards of k-pop, this edgy quartet blazed their paths with their hybrid of RnB, hip-hop and dance pop hits. They are the queens of daring concepts in the second generation, a trademark that even bled down to their solos (Gain doing a song about sexual assault in a deeply conservative industry? Hello???). Sadly this is the end of the road for these girls, but even though they only had two songs at this rate, they're both so topnotch that they both sit pretty on Day 3. P.S. BASIC IS ONE OF THE BEST K-POP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME

**agentofscranton** (10): Considering the circumstances of this sub's birth, and our continuing obsession with anything even slightly 80s inspired, I was so so sure that I Feel you had the rate in the bag. So consider my shock when I Feel You not only wasn't winning, but wasn't even the highest ranking Wonder Girls song. Maybe this sub is a bit less predictable than I gave it credit for (lol, no). I Feel You is a moment, and it's parent album, *Reboot*, is an even bigger one. Please do yourselves a favour and give it a listen.

**bespectacIed** (10): A song that almost never left the top 5, and the song I really thought would be the no-brainer WG's top song of the rate. How many people do y’all think still haven't recovered from the words “JYP … and the Wonder Girls, we’re back!!!”? I know I haven’t. I’m never gonna get tired of overhyping REBOOT, the best k-pop album of all time, with I Feel You being in my opinion the most iconic and important comeback in k-pop history. This comeback saw Wonder Girls rising from a grim 3-year hiatus full of doubt about their future, now clad in sexy leotards, playing instruments for an 80s synth-pop lead single of an album they helped pen. In short, a GIRL BAND totally in control of their own destinies. And the cherry on top: with Sunmi’s long awaited return to the group!!!. I Feel You and the REBOOT album gives me chills with how perfectly executed everything was about them. REBOOT is the greatest GG comeback ever, I can’t imagine how it would be topped.

#Ate this
**ralah** (11): one of the best kpop songs ever

**1998tweety** (10): They really ascended to a new level with this album. Love the 80s vibes

**2l82bstr8** (10): literally birthed the 80's throwback. they were the blueprint

**Agusarg** (10): The perfect 80s throwback. The sound is fantastic, and it has so much personality. Reboot in general is an amazing album

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is so shimmery i love it stan REBOOT (rewind would be an 11 if it were a single tho)

**cutefuss** (10): talented brilliant incredible amazing show-stopping spectacular never the same totally unique completely not ever been done before

**heeyeon** (10): perfect song perfect album thank you wonder girls

**MrSwearword** (10): song and video are a serve. Retro always suited them the best and 1980s realness works so well here.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**taeneon** (10): they all look so fucking hot and the songs good (love the 80s vibes) but all I can think about is how gorgeous they are

**therokinrolla** (10): This song is simply so elegant and beautiful. The instrumental is so restrained, most of the song is carried just by blissful vocal performances and flawless melodic work. Yubin's rap is one of the best in any Kpop song period, and it's just a work of art and its why I stan. Easily one of the best Kpop songs of all time.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a perfect pop song and one of the best pop songs of the 10s. pls stream reboot bc it's also one of the best pop records that exist... if you love emotion, you'll love it

**radiofan15** (9.5): Is this Korea's response to Carly Rae Jepsen's Emotion? DISCUSS!

**dynamicity** (9): 80's perfection.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): the things I do with my body when this song comes on… I’m in an ‘80s video… there’s smoke… my hair is huge… jazzercise lite

**twat_brained** (8): now this is a slam dunk day 3 song since it has '80s vibes and because we all worship mother Carly that's rather popular round these here parts

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Those synths were fun.

**nowqueenofpop** (7): something something the gays something something 80s something something pop perfection

**Qwilphish** (7): i like the actual song but their voices sound drowned out and not well done.

**smile-on-crayon** (7): First of all, JYP adlibs are still present, ugh! And that zoom in into Sunmi's area, I guess that was the sign that things were going to get sexy. It's as obvious as in Kendrick Lamar's "These Walls" where the song starts after a girl softly says, sex. With that being said, 80's MVs never looked sexier. Like never. Like, yes there were MVs that would feature hot girls jumping and such but this, this was sultry. And, with girls with instruments being my thing, gosh. They should have gone for a more 80's approach musically though. Rather that than shoehorn in an unnecessary rap part. If they wanted rap, they should check how Biggie rapped over 80's tracks. Just look at "Juicy".

**bespectacIed** (11): I never expected this to win because I know people don’t share the obsession I have with this song, but I know my 11 puts me in the right side of history. No other song in k-pop will ever give me as much buzz as the 3-minute cocaine high of Gee. This song was THE true cultural reset for k-pop: every group thereafter will try to be as effortlessly cute and adorable as the girls. Every entertainment company will try hard to replicate the catchiness and brightness of this song (including SM itself lmao). Every damn producer in k-pop will make a song with a repetitive onomatopoeia chorus. AND ALL OF THEM WILL PALE IN COMPARISON TO GEE. Gee is a show of force from what turned out to be the biggest brand and talent this industry has produced. Every bit of imagery that this song provided will be of utmost cultural importance for k-pop: the neon pants, the colored jeans, the crab dance move, Shinee Minho’s hot ass cameo, the adorable, fresh-faced girls themselves singing about the purest of loves. Seriously, no other song in k-pop will ever reach the glory and level of iconicness that Gee has, I don’t give a fuck if some songs sold higher or were streamed more, Gee will always be superior!!!!!! To end this writeup that is really more like the ramblings of a [loonatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XznW8Ti6WWk) than an actual writeup, here’s [all members of SNSD holding a trophy for each of their 9 wins in Music Bank A.K.A. the most iconic photo in k-pop](https://i.imgur.com/eWd14zx.jpg).

**agentofscranton** (10): Hey boy. It was a cultural reset. Perhaps the most iconic k-pop song of all time? I'd say so. Despite it's biggest detractors, Gee was never far away from the top 10, and in fact it's managed to claw it's way into the highest position it's had at all during the rate. Love that for her. Gee is just a 3 and a half minute long high. It's infectious energy and relentless bounciness is something that you just can't help but give in to.

#my angel, and my girls, my sunshine

**Qustomar** (11): the generic 11 of this rate but idc. this was my first ever exposure to k-pop. after all these years this still hasn't gotten old for me. bubblegum pop perfection? every part truly is a killing part

**rickikardashian** (11): circa 2010, young ricki started hearing about the existence of of K-Pop on facebook fan pages, the two names I kept on hearing about were 2ne1 and Girls’ Generation, and the only song I could remember from them was Gee, so I searched it up and gave it a listen, and I thought it was very bad. It was too dumb and repetitive, it just couldn't compare to the intelectual music I was listening to, like Selena Gomez and The Scene and the soundtrack of Camp Rock. I’m pretty sure I haven’t listened to this song since then, and somehow, I remembered this whole thing as if it was my favorite song of all time. It’s incredibly bubblegum in the best way possible and the hook is infectious, it never gets old. I have no clue exactly what turned me off from this when I was younger, because this is just everything I could’ve asked for a overly sweet, upbeat pop song.

**sailormunelune** (11): the perfect pop song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtuZvrycyUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtuZvrycyUk)

**twat_brained** (11): I’ve been WAITING FOR THIS ONE. TURN IT UP!!!!!! There’s never been a Kpop tune like this before or since. I truly consider it the pinnacle of Kpop and I’m far from alone in that opinion.

**1998tweety** (10): They know how to serve classic after classic, easily one of the most iconic kpop songs ever

**alwayswords** (10): the first kpop song i ever listened to :theresflavor:

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): f-words overuse the word iconic but this TRULY is iconic. legendaric. a Moment in Herstory. this would be such an obvious winner and tbh i wont be mad if it does!

**DaBigBoi** (10): THE Classic

**dlong5665** (10): made me fall in love with kpop so maybe i should actually rate this a zero for ruining my life

**fadedblue09** (10): Damn, that chorus is so irresistible it makes me wanna learn Korean. Bubblegum pop perfection, and also a worthy winner.

**gannade** (10): this song lit rullly invented music, better put some rihspect on its name!

**hikkaru** (10): maybe the most perfect pop song ever created...

**JohnnyToby** (10): Yes Sir

**Maybe9** (10): this song invented kpop

**nowqueenofpop** (10): What else is there to say… she is the viral comeback the other girls wish they were

**NuneEtsuko** (10): I would've liked not to go the stereotypical way and give this a 10, but what can I say, this is a legendary song and deserves no less.

**radiofan15** (10): A MOMENT in history...

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): i swear, ask me about this song at any time other than when i'm actually listening to it and my first thought will be “it’s way too cutesy” (i blame the video) but the second it comes one i have nothing negative to say about it

**therokinrolla** (10): This was the first Kpop song I ever had on a loop, really. I had like, 80 plays of it within 3 days of discovering it. It's so unsurprising learning about just how massive and influential the song was. It oozes repetition so cleverly due to how frankly minimalist the production is. It's very smart, I can't help but imagine the writers knew they were onto gold when it was being made.

**wavingwolves** (10): i love this song as much as taeyeon hates it. which is a lot

**Qwilphish** (9.5): invented going viral, invented kpop, invented dancing, invented my first love story, invented my angel, and my girls. invented my sunshine uh uh uh lets go!

**_Doh_** (9): everyone's first kpop song

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): and we wouldn't know k-pop existed at all without this song. it's one of the few songs where the whole aegyo super-cutesy shtick doesn't bother me at all

**smile-on-crayon** (8): Definitely an ear worm.

**untutorable** (8): that was a classic

**AnimationJava** (7): Once again I would like to give credit to Girls' Generation because their music has aged surprisingly well in comparison to some other groups in this rate.

**dynamicity** (7): It's cute and catchy but gets irritating rather quickly.

**selegend** (7): i know it’s gonna be overrated in this rate but i can’t actually give it a bad score lol

#gee gee, well played   
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.9): Look I know this song is legendary but I’ve never ever understood the hype around it. Like, it’s cutesy bubblegum pop, that’s exactly my market, but this song is so bland?

**cutefuss** (5.4): as an snsd stan this kills me to admit but gee is my least fav song by them after oh!

**MrSwearword** (0): DASCUSTANG. I just hate how tacky, saccharine, badly written, badly performed it is...aw jesus, gross.

#I CACKLED
**taeneon** (8): i feel like i've been brainwashed into loving this ?

=====

hyogurt: In one of my final installments of forgotten k-pop history, SM did not plan for "Gee" to happen. They originally intended SNSD to come back in late 2008 with "Dancing Queen" (a Korean version of Duffy's "Mercy") but there were issues with clearing the rights / international licenses. They even filmed but had to scrap a 50s diner themed music video (released 4 years later in 2012) and album photoshoot (that eventually got turned into a calendar instead): https://imgur.com/a/yDI9iXH

It is a blessing they came back with Gee because Dancing Queen would not have launched them into superstardom the way that Gee did. Gee DEFINES the sound and aesthetic of 2nd generation k-pop. Thank you E-Tribe. Thank you Duffy. Thank you Hyoyeon's hat.

**agentofscranton** (10): So we bid farewell to Wonder Girls, and fittingly with their disbandment single, Why So Lonely. Why So Lonely's rate journey is tragique, constantly 2nd to 1st place, until the rate progressed and Why So Lonely slipped from silver to it's newfound position just outside of the podium. F. It's a shame that this is likely the last we'll ever hear from Wonder Girls as a group but at least they went out on one of the greatest songs of their career.

**bespectacIed** (10): At last, we’re down the most resilient Wonder Girls song of the rate. For the most part of the rate, it hasn’t left the top 2 spot, but was slowly pushed at the end by a couple of songs to its final ranking. Continuing with the girls’ rebranding into a legitimate girl band that started with REBOOT, Why so Lonely sported songwriting AND instrumental credits from the girls. This languid reggae bop with a quirky and a little racy (in k-pop standards) music video just oozes sensuality, coolness, and professionalism from the k-pop legends. One of the cruelest twists of fate in this world is Wonder Girls finally being given artistic control for their last releases, both of which turned out to be the best outputs of their discography, and then immediately disbanding. Ahh, the hopes we’ve had for Wonder Girls after this strong comeback :’(

---

**_Doh_** (11): the retro band concept was the greatest thing to ever happen to music

**MrSwearword** (11): the best kind of swan song/last track to go out on, legendary

**rslashpoopheads** (11): iconic

**untutorable** (11): this is my favorite song...... this is my FAVORITE song!! wonder girls killed it with this one it is just chefs kiss i love them i miss them every day

**wavingwolves** (11): if i could i would give this a 12

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this is so good. We want them BACK

**Agusarg** (10): Not only they co-wrote the track, but also played the instruments on it. Truly talented legends, and the song is top tier of course

**dynamicity** (10): How many groups will ever go out on such a high note?

**fadedblue09** (10): We need more Caribbean K-pop songs!

**JohnnyToby** (10): side to side wishes

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): huge huge 10

**Qwilphish** (10): the wonder girls deserve better for releasing this absolute monster of a hit/banger and then instantly disbanding.

**taeneon** (10): their most recent band style songs are just sooooo good

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): when was the last time ska sounded so good? I have seen so few people attempt this at all, in k-pop or otherwise, let alone at this level of success. a classic

**cutefuss** (9.3): seriously the jump in quality between their early songs to now in terms of vocal quality is astounding. they are finally singing songs that complement their breathy voices, with production values that don't expose the cracks in their abilities. this is what they deserved all along.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): summer vibes

**smile-on-crayon** (9): But I am here for this. It was a reggae-ish R&B song, dare I say ska-ish too?Still sweet though.

**AnimationJava** (8.5): The sultry r&b vibes were great! I loved the beat rift too, it reminded me a bit of the mixing on Side to Side.

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): Quarantine

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.3): ooh they’re taking us to the islands~ I’m not mad about it

**nowqueenofpop** (8): when I first started getting into kpop I used to listen to this and watch the music video a lot so it gets bonus “nostalgia” points

**radiofan15** (7.6): At least is not Rude...

**twat_brained** (6.1): did someone leave the group between now and IFY? If this is the direction they went in I can't say I blame her

**Maybe9** (5): this song is 70s ugly gross poo poo bad

**Overall Average**: 7.705 **// Average Controversy:** 1.805

  Depending on what side of history you’re on, the rollercoaster career of JYP Entertainment’s then-flagship girl group could either be about the girls who “paved the way” ... or a grim cautionary tale. For us mostly non-Korean fans, we might remember them with their iconic (but undeniably, full of *choices*) foray into international waters, but Wonder Girls' versatile discography is still chock full of chart-topping hits that sold insanely well and became pop culture fixtures. What really cemented Wonder Girls’ legacy though is the release of what I like to call the “Emancipation of Mimi of k-pop”, --- REBOOT, the hiatus-ending SMASH that is one of the best k-pop albums of all time, maybe even the best ever!!! Them ending their careers with their best outputs is a tragedy in k-pop … but at least they ended this rate with flying colors.

---
**NuneEtsuko** (9.117): Nobody can deny that JYP was the mastermind behind some of the most successful girl groups and for a reason, their songs are too freaking good, catchy and leave a lasting impression, they're timeless and never get old. Hearing again these jams reminds me just why I fell in love with KPOP in the first place. WG hands down have the best Kpop songs from any GG imo and that's because not only their hit singles resonate but also their side tracks like Girlfriend that I love so much <3

**2l82bstr8** (8.667): before Blackpink, before BTS, before Girls' Generation, there was the Wonder Girls. they were SO ahead of their time in many ways

**selegend** (8.667): theyre legends, nothing more to say

**dynamicity** (8.167): Honestly I never really liked them until I Feel You but I appreciate them much more now. Where is Two Different Tears though?

**twat_brained** (8.000): my first exposure to these ladies was when I saw them open for the Jonas Brothers. I’ve neither heard nor thought of them since.

**Qustomar** (7.250): love their 80s era but otherwise it depends

**smile-on-crayon** (7.167): I only know this group for their "Like This" song.

**ralah** (6.500): fun fact my high school English essay was about their American advancement/ JYPs American dream

**fadedblue09** (6.400): Some of their early songs are too dated or weird for my taste but overall most of their songs seem pretty fun and nostalgic.

**cutefuss** (5.833): i genuinely apologize for the pre-band era rates for wg. i just...generally find their early stuff almost unlistenable due to the way jyp coached and mixed their vocals.

**agentofscranton** (10): Unfortunately, this is the end of the road for Godpink, as Eung Eung bows out in a very respectable 3rd place, and she put up a good fight! Even managing to snatch second a couple of times during the rate, but ultimately she ends up here in bronze position. Declared the 2019 SOTY by k-pop stan twitter (which, they're not wrong lbr), the Black Eyed Pilseung-produced gigabop, backed by a gorgeous music video, is Apink reasserting the fact that they are still at the very top of the game, despite their seniority. That ascending and descending synth intro is what plays as you ascend into heaven, where you'll find that God is in fact, just Eunji.

**bespectacIed** (10): And we’re down to the last Apink song in the rate. What a champ Eung Eung was, it was always in the top 10 and spent a few days in the top 2, but finally settled to this peak in the final week. I'm just gonna copy my really extra Popheads Jukebox review for Eung Eung -----> Apink, the most enduring 2nd generation girl group in k-pop, continues to ride on the success of their girl-next-door to mature concept change started with their 2018 megahit I'm So Sick, now with the pop perfection of Eung Eung. Many of y'all might have heard this song through the obnoxiously shared fancams in k-pop twitter declaring it as SOTY, as it should be I might add. But removing the meme, Eung Eung is a stellar fucking song. Eung Eung is a song about the unpredictability of a woman's emotions, expertly done with a sensual, moan-like hook and a swirling retro-funk beat, backed by an equal parts cute and badass MV that asserts Apink's newfound confidence to their seniority in k-pop. Apink may have never reached the heights of their 2nd gen contemporaries, their endurance and consistent wig-snatchery make us hungry for their presence in the industry

**ryokann** (11): followed up song of the year with song of the year

**1998tweety** (10): A very good follow up to ISS. It doesn't go quite as hard but it's still very good.

**2l82bstr8** (10): if a certain other song wasn't in the rate, this would be my 11. do I really need to explain we're all mostly gay here so I don't feel the need to explain why

**Agusarg** (10): Synth pop excelence. Not much to say besides it's one of the best kpop songs ever made

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I WISH I HAD ANOTHER 11 I WISH I HAD ANOTHER 11 I WISH I HAD ANOTHER 11

**dlong5665** (10): they really did that here wow

**heeyeon** (10): i'm so sick was great but this one did it for me, the synths, the harmonies, it's so GOOD

**JohnnyToby** (10): the way this slaps

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): also a whole 10

**Qustomar** (10): dreamy pop music but make it cvnt

**Qwilphish** (10): not as good as Im so sick, but GUESS WHAT, ITS STILL A 10

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): another S-tier chorus, let’s gooooo (Chorong’s pink braids, let’s also gooooo)

**twat_brained** (10): fuck it. These girlies are everything I expect from Kpop and their music is pure sugary goodness. I can’t leave this rate without giving them a 10.

**wavingwolves** (10): we love the best song of 2019

**cutefuss** (9.8): you know the slow part that starts when there's like 45 seconds left in the song? that's why i didn't give this song a 10.

**nowqueenofpop** (9.5): The superior “overrated on fancam stan twitter” Apink song and for good reason! That little “eung eung” lound effect throughout the song… they said let’s add a little spice

**dynamicity** (9): Not as immediately memorable as I'm So Sick, this song really needs a good pair of headphones to get why it's so good.

**radiofan15** (8.9): Mmmmm....

**Maybe9** (8.5): if this song wasnt monotone it would be a 10

**AnimationJava** (8): For obvious reasons this sounds like the freshest track of the selection! The MMM ad libs did strike me as a bit weird but overall a really cute track.

**MrSwearword** (8): pretty good but I admit I sort of got bored towards the end.

**untutorable** (8): this song is such a serve

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.9): Maybe blasphemy but I feel like this song relies too much on that synth riff and the overall mood, when you look at it as an actual song it’s just like… fine.

**Unprettiest** (6.2): they're reciting Shakespeare in the lyrics for all I know but my attention quickly waned with this

**fadedblue09** (5.7): Production is interesting (though borderline messy sometimes) but doesn't make up for the forgettable song structure.

bespectacIed: # Apink

**Overall Average**: 7.817 **// Average Controversy:** 1.820

 Sadly settling for third place is the everlasting legends Apink! 9 years into their career, Apink is still pumping out one SOTY after another, having just released Dumhdurum to massive success in Korea. Apink has insane staying power thanks to their new mature, specifically-made-for-us-f-words sound, and long may it continue!, Fresh from the SMASH success of their April 2020 comeback Dumhdurum, no group in this rate had me more excited to rate than Apink. Apink simply has one of the most inspiring k-pop careers to me. Not once did they have a truly low point in their career, they cruised their way into 2nd-gen with their signature brand of cute and girly bops. And then to adapt to the ever-transient nature of k-pop, Apink had an abrupt maturation on sound, image, and concept that led them to continue being one of the top-tier girl groups…. 9 YEARS INTO THEIR CAREER. That kind of longevity is something other k-pop girl groups could only dream of, and something us fans are completely grateful for. Long live, Apink. Long live.

---
**2l82bstr8** (9.250): not only they're the other group who still hasn't retired, they're only doing better with age! and by doing better I don't mean just improving, I mean completely transforming their sound and image into something rich, complex and undeniably excellent. stream Dumhdurum!

**dynamicity** (9.250): I didn't like them for a long time but I've warmed up to them a lot recently.

**twat_brained** (8.925): another act I am unfortunately unfamiliar with, however I could not pick any of these ladies out one from the other if you asked me

**therokinrolla** (8.750): I just love Apink's more recent mature side so much more than their older stuff. I think GFRIEND just pulls off this sound a little better and have more vocal prowess to back it up. Mr Chu and NoNoNo are GOOD but the other songs are simply next level.

**smile-on-crayon** (8.500): Laying the groundwork for groups like GFriend to carry on the torch.

**Qustomar** (7.875): scandal-free queens of longevity, need to delve into them more

**fadedblue09** (6.750): They have interesting production but some of their songs don't stick for some reason.

**bespectacIed** (10): In the early parts of this rate, I was at the edge of my seat seeing 4 Walls underperform on my expectations (flip flopping below the top 10). Like I truly cannot believe 4 Walls wasn’t winner material in y’all’s eyes.  As more scores came in, I became relieved as it slowly climbed to the top 10 and finally settled just below the rate winner. From LDN Noise’s impeccable UK deep house production, the vogue breakdown, Amber’s best rap verse of her career, and that damn heaven-sent chorus, I honestly don’t know a k-pop song that sounds more beautiful, more calculated, and more pristine than 4 Walls. I really thought this would be the obvious rate winner, but alas, it was narrowly edged out. 4 Walls is simply a k-pop masterpiece. This song deserves every hype and praise it has gotten through the years as one of the best k-pop songs ever recorded. P.S. RUDE LOVE IS BETTER THAN 4 WALLS THAT’S A FACT

**agentofscranton** (9): And there we have it! 4 Walls, which I'm sure many of you expected to just stomp this rate, settles for second! Much like the rest of you I really expected 4 Walls to steamroll, so for it to absolutely flop for the first 20 or so voters was such a gag. Eventually though, the song did end up clawing it's way up to number 2, finishing with it's highest average. What is there to say about 4 Walls that hasn't already been said? It's a phenomenal song. As you can tell from my 9, I'm not as in love with it as most other people are, but that doesn't take away from this expertly produced song by LDN Noise, which also features the best rap that Amber has and ever will do in her career. But it has to settle for silver, as their unnies take the gold.

---

**Agusarg** (11): My favourite k-pop song, and house pop track in general. The production is amazing: that buildup to the drop, the bridge, it all sounds immaculate. The performances are also fantastic, it's perfection

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): YES i am crusading for this song again! y'all better not let me down; if it made it to top 10 in a charity rat it better outdo that here! it's just such a wonderfully crafted song through and through. i feel a very mystical quality throughout it, but whew that middle 8 really just teleports me to another dimension entirely. it's honestly one of my top 5 songs of all-time in any genre and my absolute favorite kpop song ever

**hikkaru** (11): "dated" production doesn't bother me really but this song sounds SO fresh compared to so much of this rate it's insane. the house/garage production is so infectious and it deserves the win

**JohnnyToby** (11): Everything about this song is immaculate from the production to the dance

**waluigiest** (11): this is stunning!!! how can you listen to this and not want to dance and be so happy

**1998tweety** (10): Their best title track don't @ me. LOVE this style even though I know they're not known for it. Tbh this is one of the best kpop songs there is huh.

**2l82bstr8** (10): a lot of girl groups out there right now owe their entire careers to this chorus

**AnimationJava** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**DaBigBoi** (10): Woaoaoaoaoaoalls

**dynamicity** (10): Invented House music.

**fadedblue09** (10): Omg I dig the house vibes of this! Why haven’t I heard this before? Low-key wished they had more songs like this.

**gabcac** (10): forever thankful for this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m tempted to low-ball this song because it’s probably going to win and there’s songs I like more than it but if I’m being realistic, this fully deserves the top spot

**heeyeon** (10): queens of deep house

**MrSwearword** (10): THIS IS A SERVE. Dare I say their best song

**Qustomar** (10): the vogue anthem yes

**Qwilphish** (10): f(x)'s magnum opus and honestly one of the most stunning MVs.

**radiofan15** (10): They truly came for my wig...

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): that chorus beat, absolute perfection

**smile-on-crayon** (10): **This, though, is one of their best songs. Actually, "Rude Love", from the same album, would have been equally rated.**

**twat_brained** (10): I will be incredibly surprised if this doesn’t win but I’m somewhat tempting fate by snubbing my 11 from this smash. If anyone can beat this it’ll be Girls’ Generation.

**Shinkopeshon** (9.3): Heard this before. Loved it then, may love it even more after another listen.

**cutefuss** (9.1): the album itself would get an even higher score - it's f(x)'s masterpiece, and unfortunately probably the last album we'll ever see from them

**Maybe9** (9): finally, some good fucking runway tracks

**nowqueenofpop** (9): Other groups can only hope to (unbeknownst to fx at the time) disband with such a perfect final comeback. Love really is four walls… but with that being said, I can’t hear Amber’s rap in this without thinking of the cyclops character in Onward

**rickikardashian** (8.5): pretty good example of a very good song that is also overrated

**wavingwolves** (5.5): this is one of the few f(x) songs i actually like and even so i don't like it very much

**Overall Average**: 7.509 **// Average Controversy:** 1.905

 Ahhh, my favorite girl group in this rate, and one of ult groups in k-pop. You’d think a group as talented and excellent as f(x) would have been treated better by their company. You’d be hard-pressed to find a group with a discography more textured than f(x), PERIOD. More specifically, you'd be hard-pressed to find a three-album run in k-pop more impressive than Pink Tape -> Red Light -> 4 Walls, which makes it more infuriating to know that these are their three final albums. f(x)'s legacy to me is being the consensus girl group people think about when the question "Whose group has the best discography?" gets thrown around. We wish we could’ve had a few more years from them :( P.S. We love you, Sulli.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.157): the best group of this generation PERIOD no tampon. that being said, as much as i love them we really couldve trimmed their list (and SNSD) down a bit to squeeze in another group or two

**Qustomar** (9.143): if pitchfork made a kpop girl group

**2l82bstr8** (8.857): possibly my favorite. kpop. group. of. all. time. in an industry where you're encouraged to follow trends, they set the trends themselves. at their best, every comeback was a new facet of their music, a new mash of styles, a new style of production, and they nailed it like few could. it's a crying shame they weren't paid their dues.

**twat_brained** (8.571): These girlies I know of and from what I’ve heard of them they’re definitely Korea’s it girls. It’s really unfortunate that one of them sadly left us last year. RIP Sulli

**dynamicity** (8.500): Greatest kpop album artist of all time.

**gabcac** (8.129): the group with the best b-sides, if you haven't, please listen the holy kpop trinity ( pink tape, red light, 4walls)

**therokinrolla** (7.714): Iconic is the word. As much as it's a shame they don't have the recognition of SNSD or Red Velvet, they're slightly more niche status is cute, especially when this is kinda the de facto second gen group for western acclaim. This is the group music snobs put on their lists and proceed to do that one Tik Tok about "ah, I am so cultured, I love all cultures" you know the one. Their first few eras were a bit tragic in hindsight as they aged like milk, meanwhile their later singles feel that little bit timeless and have that ubiquitous f(x) sound. The real treasure lies in their B-sides, but I appreciate the singles for what they are.

**hiramutsu** (7.571): Not the biggest fan either, but appreciate their music style.

**fadedblue09** (7.514): While not all their songs may be my favorites, I appreciate them for having this distinctive electropop vibe that makes them stand out from the rest of the groups here.

**cutefuss** (7.300): the first rate is going to throw you off but imo f(x) are the queens of innovative, consistent kpop music and their b-sides are even better than their already great title tracks. i am a huge red velvet stan - but they (and i) wish their discography was half as solid as f(x)'s.

**selegend** (7.286): their albums are stronger than their singles, like red velvet

**rickikardashian** (6.700): the tomboy one wears those ugly ass knee length skinny shorts in almost every video and i hate them so fucking much omfg

**ralah** (5.000): i love how different the girls look and their later concepts slay but theyre music isn't my cup of tea most time :((

**smile-on-crayon** (4.286): Where I like the collab of Amber X Luna's songs ("Heartbeat", Wave", "Lower") more than I do their group, sorry.

**agentofscranton** (10): So, here we are! The winner of popheads K-Pop Retirement Home Rate! Genie absolutely DEMOLISHED the competition. Only 2 other songs ever touched number one besides Genie - Catallena, for which Genie was still 2nd with an average of 10, and Why So Lonely, which only ever tied with it. As soon as Genie touched the pole position it stuck it's stilletos in and refused to budge. It withstood a barrage of middling scores and a 0 to solidify it's position as popheads' number one song sung by the elders of K-Pop. And let's be honest, how could it not be? That pounding beat, that soaring chorus, Tiffany's English time, and of course, the best part of the song: Taeyeon. Doing the absolute most. Her adlibs literally saved my life. Congratulations to the winning song! Popheads, put it back on!

**bespectacIed** (10): **Tiffany voice **. POPHEADS, PUT IT BACK ooooOOOON!!!! Once again, a popheads k-pop rate was won by an SM Entertainment girl group. While the first k-pop rate was a Red Velvet top 3 sweep, this rate had the top two of both the main rate and bonus rate occupied by SNSD and f(x). Genie “winning” is putting it lightly, this song DEMOLISHED. The damn song literally never left the top of the rate, and it always had a huge cushion between the number 2. For the majority of the rate it was the only song to have maintained a line of 9 score. Genie granted everything we could have wanted in a k-pop song. Everything about this song is iconic: the giant pink heart backdrop, the connection to the SONE fandom name, the verses, the hook, the iconic leg dance, Tiffany’s immortal line, Taeyeon’s iconic adlibs in the end … I’ve said iconic too many times in this rate (53 times, I counted) but IDGAF. In the end, I have a much stronger personal attachment to Gee and I firmly believe that it is the more iconic song and therefore more deserving of the win, but Genie is undeniably their best song; the musical peak of a girl group at the peak of k-pop  … and r/popheads agreed to that. Congratulations, Girls’ Generation!!! <3 Sowoneul malhaebwaaaa

**DaBigBoi** (11): So hard to choose, but Genie remains timeless

**gabcac** (11): what can i say about this song. One of the greatest

**Qwilphish** (11): LITERALLY could be released tomorrow and people would go crazy for it. such a timeless song. Taeyeons background adlibs make it so transcendental. most 6irls wish they could have this song in their discography

**selegend** (11): actually this is the best song of all time

**dynamicity** (10): Hey DJ. Put it back on.

**JohnnyToby** (10): A cult classic jesus this is so hot and those ad libs UGHHH

**Maybe9** (10): this song single-handedly made high school bearable

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): of course 10

**nowqueenofpop** (10): This is a GROUP of SINGERS and PERFORMERS. Taeyeon jumping in in the last chorus literally always makes me laugh because it’s so sudden but she went into that studio in 2009 and had to show the other girls how it’s done

**Qustomar** (10): that time they performed this on a helipad yup, that's history. as well as taeyeon's neoui fantasy-reul sumgimeobsi malhaebwa

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**therokinrolla** (10): This is better than Gee lol. Gee is a great exercise in repetition, but Genie is a great exercise in what makes an epic song "epic". Here it's the marching melody, the pounding rhythm, Taeyeon's absolutely infamous vocal run in the final chorus. It's the nonchalant intro leading into what is perhaps SNSD's most starkly confident release. For some reason it reminds me a lot of a Lady Gaga song, but I've never been able to figure out why.

**untutorable** (10): one of my favorite kpop songs of all TIME it's iconic

**1998tweety** (9): Massive bop, she's cute

**2l82bstr8** (9): an absolute early-10's synthpop BOP. I love how the reverb effect is used throughout, and the last chorus, when Taeyon starts adlibbing? transcendental

**cutefuss** (9): pop excellence enough said

**sarcasticsobs** (9): prechorus part, best part. the rhythm is great, followed by the first part of the chorus

**smile-on-crayon** (9): The DJ at a certain theme park merry-go-round near me would have had a lot of fun with this one.

**twat_brained** (8.9): I certainly enjoy the influences of girl groups I’m familiar with, but at the same time, what I love and expect from kpop is its original and fresh take on high-energy pop

**Unprettiest** (8.5): weird MV, great song

**fadedblue09** (8.3): I’m surprised that r/kpop voted this as their best song? It grew on me, but I always thought this was like Gee and Oh’s forgettable sister. The post-chorus is the most memorable part and the rest of the song doesn't live up to it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.2): “I’m genie for you boy”https://media.giphy.com/media/4ZgJC0Z3lV7b9LhRIS/giphy.gif

**MrSwearword** (8): alright this is cuuuuuuute for them. Werk.

**Overall Average**: 7.998 **// Average Controversy:** 1.880

 How do you even do a writeup about the very girl group that dominated and defined the very generation we are celebrating? You can't, and you’re just gonna have to deal with the fact that you cannot overstate the impact SNSD has in Korean music, and pop music as a whole. As the top digital and physicals seller of the 2nd generation, Girls' Generation possesses the iconic discography and career that every industry big league tried to replicate, every subsequent female idol had to look up to, and every k-pop fan had no choice but to STAN. Legends only.

---
**twat_brained** (9.380): now these ladies… they are the gold standard of kpop. Before BTS stans attack me, they are platinum. Literally.

**Qustomar** (9.050): can we please talk about sunny's vocals more. but on snsd as a whole, ugh they could do anything and everything. something about the group just had such a strong and powerful energy that could never be recreated. they are forever one of a kind

**therokinrolla** (8.850): I feel cheesy giving SNSD straight up so many 10s, but... they just deserve it? I have no hesitation saying SNSD has the best title tracks of any group, and so many of them are impressively iconic due to them frequently doing something a bit new a bit different something for the summertime something for the girls to get ready to. They also have the advantage of having the vocalist of our era in their group doing those wack-ass (in a good way) vocal acrobatics during the bridges of songs like Genie and ITNW. I won't lie, they lost steam during the end of their reign, but God if they didn't obliterate everything in their path.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.700): i never dove into SNSD before this but geezus i see why they were absolutely huge. i love taeyeon’s most recent solo album but in like 2 weeks she’s become possibly my favorite kpop vocalist

**taeneon** (8.700): QUEEEEEENS

**gabcac** (8.630): the nation's girlgroup. Snsd really paved the way for gg

**2l82bstr8** (8.500): literally invented k-pop

**NuneEtsuko** (8.480): The one top girl group of all time, they put out so many hits and they will always be remembered for their crazy good songs supreme in every way, from the dances to the hook; I wouldn't call myself a SNSD stan but damn this rate is making me question myself, their songs got me the most pumped and brought the fondest memories, man did they make some absolute bangers that will never be forgotten, they deserve no less than the 10 they're being served left and right!

**dynamicity** (8.300): Hey girls? Do you know what time it is? It must be party time. Here we go!

**selegend** (8.200): horse hair weaves

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.950): “Kissing You” is the best Kpop song of this generation and that’s that!

**fadedblue09** (7.180): Definitely one of the girl groups I'm familiar with. Having a lot of songs,it was unsurprising that they were hit-or-miss with their singles. Maybe hot take but I prefer their classic bubblegum stuff over the overproduced electropop.

**cutefuss** (7.160): not me doing this rate and realizing i like f(x)'s discography more than snsd's when snsd is my ult group of all time...much to think about

**ralah** (6.450): early SNSD was best but this list is missing Hoot :((

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.890): kinda really didnt need to have a million SNSD songs in this rate especially when the hymn Hoot was snubbed
