The K-Pop Retirement Home Rate!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ftl07a/the_kpop_retirement_home_rate/

안녕하세요! Welcome to r/popheads' second ever k-pop rate! This time we're here to take y'all on a lil step back in time  as we go on a tour of the iconic, revolutionary, and groundbreaking mess that was the **Second Generation K-Pop Girl Groups**!
 
Before TWICE, BLACKPINK, and LOONA, there came the generation that pushed k-pop into international recognition like none before, and laid the groundwork for the genre to become the global phenomenon it is today. During this generation, it spawned some of the biggest, most iconic, and recognizable names in the industry today - amongst them the likes of 2NE1, Girls' Generation, f(x), and Wonder Girls.
 
Though some groups may have disbanded or gone on hiatus for whatever reason (creative differences, scandal, being women signed under YG or Pledis), or continue to promote to this day - be it in their original lineup or otherwise, their output has managed to stand the test of time and remain some of the most iconic and beloved songs to ever come out of the genre.
 
Unfortunately, as much as we wanted to make this a 100 track rate featuring other iconic second generation groups like 9Muses, Girls' Day, and Secret, [it's just not realistic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSe8_us1o0) We also couldn't include every single from each group, so we stuck to their most iconic or essential songs, even if it meant having to make some difficult cuts.
 
If you're a newbie to k-pop, there really isn't a better place to start than by taking part and listening to some of the most iconic songs and artists that the genre has to offer! Don't be intimidated by the number of artists featured or songs being rated, the beauty of the genre is that no two groups are the same and all offer something different, so don't be too worried if you're not a fan of a particular group's output! You won't be sticking around on a single group for too long^(we hope)!
 
**DISCLAIMER**^(because we know how the rabid stans get)**:** the name of the rate isn't meant to be a drag or anything, it's just poking fun at the seniority of the groups. we know some of them are v much not retired (stream and support apink's upcoming comeback).

###RULES
* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine so long as it is to only 1 decimal place (6.6 is fine, 6.66 is not).
 
* **You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks.
 
* We will also be running a bonus rate! **Do NOT give songs in the bonus rate a 0 or 11**, scores in the bonus rate must be between 1 and 10.
 
* **Rate ALL songs** in the main rate. Check at the end to make sure you haven’t left any blanks!
 
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM /u/agentofscranton or /u/bespectacied about it.
 
* **Please use the prepared link to send in your scores**. Remember to use the correct format detailed below in your ballot.
 
* **We reserve the right to reject and ask you to change your ballot at any point if we personally feel your scores have obviously inflated differences in and/or excessively low scores between different artists.** We will PM you and ask you to resubmit—this is not to make things difficult for people so apologies if we ask you to do so!
 
* We are rating the **Korean** versions of each song! The links below should all direct you to the Korean versions of each song.
 
* This isn't so much a rule as a suggestion, but so much of k-pop is in the visuals so we highly recommend watching the music videos that come with each song!
 
If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!
 
Same if you want to attach a comment to an artist, add a colon after the ARTIST name and put your comment there!
 
**These are the ONLY correct formats.**
 
> f(x): invented mathematical functions
 
> Step: 10 step right on my throat pls and thank u in advance
 
Any other format besides this is incorrect.
