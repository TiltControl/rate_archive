**Lowest Scores:**

(2 x1) ralah

**bespectacIed** (10): COME ON, SEOHYUN GRANDE!!! This is without a doubt, my favorite song in the bonus rate. SNSD's maknae (and my bias!!!) delivered with, in my opinion, the best solo of an SNSD girl by a huge margin. This *My Everything*-esque RnB-pop perfection showcased Seohyun's maturity, vocal prowess, and charisma. That final chorus where she just goes wild on her adlibs? How could anyone not stan, seriously? I am gushing but idgaf, Don't Say No is THAT song to me.

**agentofscranton** (8): This is one of two songs that I was not familiar with before deciding on the makeup of the tracklist for this rate, but I loved this at first listen. Seohyun sounds gorgeous - duh, and looks gorgeous in the video - again duh, and it's just a fun little bop. What's not to love?

---

**1998tweety** (10): /u/therokinrolla I feel like I keep telling you to stan her but you haven't done it yet...

**dynamicity** (10): Can she do anything with anything less than excellence?

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**untutorable** (10): seohyun this is a banger please release something else soon

**skargardin** (9): BOP

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): “Yes Or Yes” by TWICE is shaking

**AnimationJava** (8): The aesthetic of this song is just as sparkly as the cover art makes it seem!

**MrSwearword** (8): energetic but I'm not that wowed

**radiofan15** (7.5): NO

**fadedblue09** (7.4): The vocals are nice here but ultimately generic.

**2l82bstr8** (7): love the vibe and Seohyun kills it, but the production in this is SO weird and I can't put my finger on why

**smile-on-crayon** (7): It's still crazy how she looks like a friend of mine

**wavingwolves** (7): this is a pretty standard pop song but it's still good

**heeyeon** (6): love you seohyun but i literally forgot this happened oops

**cutefuss** (5.3): you know i thought i hated this song but in relistening to it i'm like actually this song is decent, i'm just mean.

**gabcac** (4.3): not my taste but at least Seohyun didn't make her first solo song a ballad

**agentofscranton** (10): My first interaction with this song was a result of that controversy where people accused Taylor Swift's Out of the Woods vid was accused of ripping off this. I still don't see it personally, but I'm glad it introduced me to the song! It didn't fully drag me into k-pop but I do remember being absolutely floored at Taeyeon's vocals. She was more impressive songs in her catalogue (Why and Spark to name two), but I will always have a soft spot in my heart for I. Verbal Jint really was NOT needed though lol.

**bespectacIed** (8): Anyone who gives a smidgen of attention to SNSD knows that Taeyeon is just one of a kind. Taeyeon is destined to do something more, something bigger, AND DAMN RIGHT SHE DID. This is the birth of what turned out to be one of the biggest soloists in Korean music, with a song aptly named to show her individuality to the world.

---

**1998tweety** (10): HUGE bop

**gabcac** (10): love it love it, it kinda makes me cry

**heeyeon** (10): please, i need to give this an 11, i'm begging you

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**skargardin** (10): go off queen

**Unprettiest** (10): masterpiece, taeyeon commits car theft in her first of many MV felonies. also she's almost yodeling.

**radiofan15** (9.1): Why aren't we rating Voldemort's best song AKA I Got Love?

**2l82bstr8** (9): it almost makes me believe that my life is, in fact, so beauty. unfortunately Verbal Jint's contribution is completely worthless :(

**fadedblue09** (9): Pretty chill pop-rock track.

**cutefuss** (8.5): taeyeon is my most listened to artist on last.fm, but i prefer a lot of her other songs to i.

**dynamicity** (8.5): A solid uplifting Western-sounding song. She also has much better songs in her discography though.

**_Doh_** (8): vocals

**JohnnyToby** (8): the r*p kills it

**sarcasticsobs** (8): i do not like the rap! but her voice is ridiculous

**AnimationJava** (7.5): Taeyeon's vocals on this are no joke! I definitely want to check out her solo disc more.

**smile-on-crayon** (7): I think I would appreciate it more without Verbal Jint contributing and that "My life is a beauty" line. The song has this feeling of "it's so cool to care, bro", but I'm not buying none of it. It's just like the Black Eyed Peas' "Where is the love?".

**untutorable** (6): honestly i find it a bit boring but taeyeon's voice is just so pretty it balances out

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Noise

**nowqueenofpop** (5): it genuinely hurts to give this a lower score considering her otherwise great title tracks but…

**Qustomar** (5): i hate verbal jint's part so much, but taeyeon's singing is class as always

**TragicKingdom1** (5): the rapper sounds like machine gun kelly

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i actually really love her but this song makes me understand why some call her Yawn

**MrSwearword** (1): nope. Nothing this innocent and bland gets good marks from me

**wavingwolves** (1): i would give this a 0 if i could

**agentofscranton** (10): There's not enough space to say everything I really want to about this song. Goblin is an absolutely gorgeous little piece of art-pop, from one of the most criminally mistreated idols in the industry. It's hard to really rate this song as separate from the tragedy, but even before it happened, I had already thought of Goblin as one of the best songs of 2019. It was a beautiful, and wonderfully produced song that provided a little bit of insight into Sulli's mind. I'm glad to see things start to change in the industry with regards to how idols are treated, I just wish it wasn't at the cost of such a promising star.

**bespectacIed** (10): Is there even a proper way to rate this song? Even without the context, Goblin was still imo the best song released in 2019. It's a stunningly-written, brilliantly-produced psychological exploration of one of the brightest but troubled stars k-pop has produced. This song shouldn't have been a swan song.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Rest In Peace :(

**2l82bstr8** (10): whimsical melancholy at its finest. she was telling us the whole time, it feels. rest in peace, Sulli, you did well.

**Agusarg** (10): What a beautiful and unique song

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): if this doesnt win im gonna be so sad. such a breathtakingly beautiful piece of art pop, and the entire single gave us such a gorgeous glimpse into Sulli as a solo artist. i hope she's at peace now and forever.

**MrSwearword** (10): mainly because a good sis on Discord let me know the T on this angel. Video wise it's so gripping but macabre and whimsical.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**DaBigBoi** (9): What a great vision she had

**dynamicity** (9): :(

**sailormunelune** (9): Rest in Peace Sulli

**wavingwolves** (9): it's been a while since i heard this and it makes me real sad but the whole song and concept are so good

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.8): the song is a bop but wtf is this music video

**cutefuss** (8.7): truly unique in the world of kpop. much like hara, she is so intensely missed and deserved better.

**gabcac** (8.5): You were a beautiful human being, Sulli

**radiofan15** (8.4): R.I.P. Queen...

**AnimationJava** (8): I would describe the sound of Goblin as very crisp and shimmer-y, it sounds like a river on a cold winter's morning. Very ethereal.

**untutorable** (8): i love her and i miss her. she was such a wonderful soul! tbh when they announced that she was going to be putting out a song i was really skeptical and i didn't think i would enjoy it but i ended up loving it she had talent beyond what she got to show the world and i wish she was able to show us more

**smile-on-crayon** (7.9): I think you can see how very creative the music Sulli made was, even with this being her first album. This song, coupled with "Dorothy" in the same album, for some reason reminds me of Grimes' album Visions. Not in the music but in the time of place she was in in her life and how she was going to start this creative layered work. With that being said, check out "Dorothy". It's one of the few Kpop songs that made me cry.

**dlong5665** (7): :(

**fadedblue09** (5.5): What's with the creepy instrumental??

I only knew about her fate way after I did the rate. Had I known better, I probably should've commented something more tactful.

**bespectacIed** (10): Ooh, ah, ooh ah ooh ah, ooh ah, ooooh! I was expecting Bubble Pop to win this bonus rate by a landslide, but alas, y’all preferred some of the others. This song just screams “classic” to me. 19-year-old Hyuna, who at that time is still active with her uber popular group 4Minute, cemented herself as CUBE Entertainment's top solo idol with this fun, summery, dubstep-ish dance-pop track. This song made Hyuna the first female Korean soloist to reach 100M views on YouTube, and is undeniably one of the most iconic, well-known k-pop solos ever. Sidenote: I wish k-pop idols were still allowed to be this tan :(

**agentofscranton** (7.5): Shockingly, Bubble Pop! didn't even manage to crack an 8+ average, which is wild considering just how iconic the song is. I'll echo the sentiments of many of the voters though in saying that HyunA has far, far better songs in her catalogue - BABE especially - but we couldn't not choose her most iconic song to represent her in the rate

---

**dynamicity** (10): Invented solo careers.

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): yeeeees.

**MrSwearword** (10): THE PINNACLE OF KPOP, FIGHT YA MOM ABOUT IT

**Qwilphish** (10): only HyunA can make a song as bubblepop as this so so sexy

**rickikardashian** (10): this dance on just dance was so difficult and for what

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**untutorable** (10): she did THAT this is the summer anthem

**wavingwolves** (10): this is literally the only hyuna song i like but it's a bop and a half

**smile-on-crayon** (9): It's in all the playlist that have "Kpop" and "summer" in their name, I guarantee you.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Cute bop (besides that grating dubstep), but Gwen Stefani remains unbothered.

**2l82bstr8** (8): I can't believe HyunA invented the woo-ah! Kim Petras who???

**_Doh_** (8): hyuna popping social standards for future generations

**radiofan15** (7.1): Gwen Stefani found fine and unbothered... you could even say her song had more "spark"...

**dlong5665** (6): i love it but like its also my least favorite of her singles

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): oh I was disappointed because I thought “Clumsy” by Fergie was about to play but instead it was whatever this is

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.6): Red would've been a 10 tbh

**cutefuss** (5.5): all of hyuna's subsequent title track releases are better than bubble pop. yes the song is iconic, but she's one of those artists who just kept growing and evolving, so bubble pop, while fun, is clearly early, less polished work for her.

**1998tweety** (3): Hyuna remains the most overrated female soloist ever

**agentofscranton** (10): We should've stopped after 5 votes when this song had it's rightful place in Day 3. The music video alone should've warranted that. The charisma, the nerve, the talent. Y'all f-words don't deserve her. Also, with this exit, After School as a full group makes it's exit from the rate, and is outpeaked by it's own subunit ~~just like in real life~~

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah this early exit is the most painful to me, Flashback is one of my 11s. This song makes me so emotional because Flashback reminds me of how much I am still a k-pop hag stuck in the 2nd Gen era, even though I’ve come to love the k-pop we have today. The international implications of Flashback to me is unreal, it just has that oomph factor in me that I can’t place ... it gives me so much life!!! This isn’t even that much unique of a song musically, it’s a pretty generic club dance-pop song … BUT pretty girls with laid wigs and snatched waists walking fiercely in cunty outfits, doing cunty poses and dance moves, gyrating to a cunty beat … like, the simplicity of it all ... that’s just my fucking brand!!! That’s all I want from life. I want this fierceness and servitude from k-pop again. Yup sorry for rambling but damn it FLASHBACK MADE ME GAY.

**dynamicity** (10): This was peak kpop.

**heeyeon** (10): and this song is why i am gay. thanks for coming to my TED talk

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**2l82bstr8** (9): they could literally shoot me in the face and I would say "thank you queens" oh wait that's exactly what they did. this is pure, unadulterated early 2010's edm-pop goodness and I live for it.

**untutorable** (9): stop this song is so good and so sexy no one does sexy like after school... they honestly never disappointed me not ONCE!

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Very pleasant-sounding since they don’t get drowned by the production.

**Shinkopeshon** (8.4): Same here, except there's an added sex appeal and confidence that immediately captivates you.

**twat_brained** (8.2): love it, sounds like a leftover Femme Fatale cut

**1998tweety** (8): Oh wow this actually bops

**MrSwearword** (8): pretty good offering but not quite that wig snatching song I want

**Qustomar** (8): if the mixing on this song was better it would be so elevated to the electropop banger it is

**smile-on-crayon** (8): This and their better song "Love Beat" are phenomenal.

**wavingwolves** (8): imagine being stepped on by all these women... yes please

**rickikardashian** (7.5): ngl the guns caught me off guard

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is fine but I ironically can’t remember what it sounds like when it ends

**radiofan15** (6.9): Forgettable like a flashback...

**AnimationJava** (6.5): The vocals on the song were good but I overall didn't feel much for it.

**Maybe9** (6): im boppin in my sleep

**taeneon** (6): good but after listening to bang it just doesn't slap as hard

**Qwilphish** (3): the voice mixing is terrible. the messy instrumental overkills their voices

**JohnnyToby** (2): sounds likes a Starts Dance filler track

**bespectacIed** (6): A ranking that kinda shocked me, even though I only gave it an okay score lol. If you ask k-pop fans the question "What is the most iconic k-pop gg debut song of all time?" , Bad Girl Good Girl probably will be near the top of the list. The commercial success and the countless records broken by this debut made miss A an overnight main pop girl group in Korea. BGGG's eschewing of the elaborate sets and flashy outfits typical of 2nd generation MVs in favor of a simple, dance-focused one was the perfect formula for k-pop supremacy in 2010. Monster rookies tingz only! But only Day 2 material in this rate :(

**agentofscranton** (5): One of the most iconic debuts of all time, miss A really did *THAT* - for some people. I really don't like the 'You don't know me!' opening lines - they're very person in 2009 that has a username like xXDark_GoddessXx or something. I should know - I was one of those people. The rest of the song doesn't really do much for me either, so I'm not too shocked to see it place so low. Here's hoping that miss A's final song - Hush - does considerably better!

---

# monster rookies

**NuneEtsuko** (11): And this is what I've been saving my highest score for, best song by a girl group, that's it, fact! This is actually the first Kpop song that I tried to learn the dance steps for and I failed miserably (Maybe I'll try again now during this lockdown) but nevertheless Miss A may not have been the most popular girl group but damn if they didn't make an impact during their debut, you can't make a better song than BGGG, from the JYP at the beginning, the dance steps, their stage presence, the song itself, ugh so good all around!

**gabcac** (10): this could be easly another 11

**JohnnyToby** (10): that bonhae tho...

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): one of the most iconic debut deserves a 10

**radiofan15** (10): I can forgive the Britney's Womanizer similarities because this is still iconic despite it...

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**wavingwolves** (10): a song this iconic... covered every year by a new girlgroup and sometimes by a few boys... it's beyond words

**dynamicity** (9): Legendary debut.

**franch** (9): how have i never heard this group before...

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): https://youtu.be/hbLE4Q11PVw?t=37

**Qwilphish** (9): this is probably the best anyone on a song from 2010 has sounded. the power of JAYWHYPEE

**twat_brained** (8.1): anyone get Danity Kane/Girlicious vibes?

**AnimationJava** (8): Something about this song is such an EARWORM, I haven't even finished listening to it yet and I've already saved it.

**Maybe9** (8): this song is very monotone, but at least that one note is very good

**waluigiest** (8): it’s got some really nasty moments sprinkled throughout

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Vocals are solid but the beat is idk….flat? Otherwise boppable.

**untutorable** (7.5): ridiculously catchy and a standout debut song

# monsters

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this just sounds so aged it brings it down tbh

**smile-on-crayon** (7): Moses Storm has a comedy bit on his first appearance on Conan where he displays what he learned at cheer camp. The intro to this song reminds of that and I couldn't take it seriously. But, when the chanting finished and the verse started, I was into it. Why couldn't they just start it with that? Also the JYP adlibs... after suffering from Akon and Timbaland's contributions to their songs, I came to Kpop to escape it. I have failed.

**1998tweety** (6): Boring, I wish more was going on cause it has potential.

**2l82bstr8** (6): it's not really pleasant to listen to... the instrumental sounds muddled and this song just doesn't seem well-suited to their vocal colors

**MrSwearword** (6): the beat is fire but the song and visual especially screams "we wanna be badass" so hard

**rickikardashian** (5.5): this sounds like one of those mashups where the pitch and bpm of both songs don't match up

**cutefuss** (2.1): the vocals in this song...the bgm...the message of the song is good. but i just don't like LISTENING to this.

**Qustomar** (2): i hate the beat/rhythm/production, it's so blegh

**alwayswords** (1): the mixing :icannotsee:

**agentofscranton** (10): This is by far my favourite 2NE1 title track and I'm so mad that it's left so early. I mean #39?! Really?! This absolute club stomper peaked at #1 on the Gaon Singles Chart, as well as on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 - 2NE1's first song to do so! Also, Wikipedia says it charted at #9 on the Billboard Gospel Charts? And you know what, when it's right it's right. God is a blackjack wbk.

**bespectacIed** (4): Just one of the million megahits that 2NE1 produced this era as if they were in a factory assembly line. This club banger really looks and feels like a typical music video from today: pretty girls in designer outfits doing sexy things in high-budget sets. Honestly though, I am not a fan of this song and it kinda gets lost amongst other songs that sound like it in 2NE1’s discography.

---

**2l82bstr8** (10): it's such an outlier in their work that it's easy to forget how GOOD it is. it's very vibrantly dark, in a way - love the vocal lines here, it's very clubby and dancey, and has aged incredibly well! (also the amount of lewks being served in this era...)

**Qustomar** (10): absolute, handcrafted, organic, grass-raised pop perfection

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**selegend** (10): at churches, at weddings, at graduations

**radiofan15** (9.5): This feels... incredibly uplifting somehow...

**Qwilphish** (9.3): this is so much catchier than I remember, thank you to this rate for letting me remember it. +.3 for that banger ending

**sarcasticsobs** (9): sorry forgot about the song, thinking about purple-haired-shaved-side-head Dara

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): this is underrated tbh but at the same time like they have better songs

**dynamicity** (8.5): Effortlessly chic.

**1998tweety** (8): Omg wait this is a server, maybe I was wrong about them

**AnimationJava** (8): This was honestly the most fresh sounding song of the non-ballads from the selection! Sounds very pretty and soft.

**Maybe9** (7.5): issa vibe

**MrSwearword** (7): the production is fine but doesn't really do anything stellar

**twat_brained** (7): not really feeling the love

**untutorable** (7): this song is an interesting one to go back to, it never sounds quite how i remember it to but i do really like it even if it is sort of minimalist for a 2ne1 song

**fadedblue09** (6.8): Has some interesting elements but the chorus is underwhelming. Also, that outro was ???

**agentofscranton** (6): An iconic debut from an iconic group. I can't decide if I'm shocked at how poorly it did, or if this was where I expected it to go, but I can't say I wish it went any further. The Space version of the MV >>> Street version, and that's on [pirireul bureora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq_mbTSR-a0). Also, with Fire's exit, we are down to just one 2NE1 song: I Am The Best! Are we surprised?

**bespectacIed** (6): An iconic debut song that shook the world of k-pop, catapulting 2NE1 to heights unreachable and drastically changing the soundscape of this era of k-pop. I have fond memories of this song because this was the first k-pop song I remember that became viral in Southeast Asia. But looking back, the dated-ness of its sound and the problematic *choices* in the music video kinda lessen my enjoyment of it. Sensibilities and values have changed since this was Fire was first released (cough couch CA is still a huge problem in k-pop today who am I kidding) … and Fire is truly a product of its time. Still a bop though.

---

**franch** (11): ahhhh this was the hardest part. genie and fire competing for my heart.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay this is like SO late 00s electropop BUT it still slaps because those world influences are soooo interesting and i just ugh it's a fucking CLASSIC

**dynamicity** (10): One of the greatest debut songs of all time, even though it sounds dated now, the hook is so irresistible that it doesn't even matter.

**fadedblue09** (10): The reason why I'm even aware of this genre in the first place. Glad to see it's still that bop.

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): the BEST girl group debut don't @ me

**JohnnyToby** (10): That MAMA performance.....UGH

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): i had a lower score for this my first 2 times listening to it because i do not like the autotune on Dara in her verse but at some point i it didn’t matter anymore

**2l82bstr8** (9): the IMPACT that this has. 2NE1 was one of the first groups who did this kind of brash, powerful concept and it panned so well that they've built their whole career on it. it's hard to believe this is a debut song because it's already filled with the confident swagger that they'd become famous for. it's a little repetitive and not that detailed for me now (as music of the time often was), but it's still an absolute banger (smart decision to include the Space version of the video!)

**ralah** (9): the intro is absolutely iconic

**Qustomar** (8.5): a trashy late-2000s electropop banger, not that good but a real bop

**twat_brained** (8.3): love the maximal production, let's you know what they're about

**MrSwearword** (8): I'm not mad at this deliciously tacky RedOne lite sound

**rickikardashian** (8): the music video looks like the highest budget cheap video ever

**therokinrolla** (8): This is the classic, honestly. I Am The Best is cute and I appreciate the outreach it has, but Fire feels as grandiose as IATB wishes it could be. Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay (2ne1!) >>> nae ga chae chalaga or whatever

**waluigiest** (8): is this Jennifer lopez

**wavingwolves** (8): eE Ee eE Ee Ee eE Ee Ee

**untutorable** (7.5): this honestly aged really well... and what a good debut song!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kind of annoying but undeniably memorable

**Qwilphish** (7): I can't tell whether I actually like this song or if its just iconic. I'll give it a fair score so I don't have to think about it

**sailormunelune** (7): a fire debut

**Shinkopeshon** (7): My biggest issue with 2NE1's early discography is the production, which is awfully dated and so typically late 00s/early 10s, it hurts. They're also repetitive and nothing particularly memorable, although they're still catchy and have a few other redeeming qualities that still make me give them fairly high scores.

**AnimationJava** (6.5): It's cute

**radiofan15** (6.5): Why does this sounds so lofi?

**1998tweety** (5.5): Snooze, nothing happens

**Maybe9** (5): this song is boring, im tired

**bespectacIed** (10): My favorite KARA title track and one of my absolute favorite songs in this rate … done dirty, of course. I can’t believe this only ranked at the middle of the rate when it’s such a perfectly crafted pop song. Fresh from the insane success of their biggest hit at that time (Mister), KARA surprised SoKor with this darker but nonetheless dance-heavy, high-tempo comeback. The energy this song exudes is ridiculous.  With the fucking iconic, frenetic, lobotomy-worthy electronic riff, the “HALLO HALLOs”, and of course, the progressively soaring vocals, this song just won’t let you catch a breath for a second. My heartbeat is through the roof doing this writeup while listening to it. This deserved better damn it!!!!!!

**agentofscranton** (6): I don't think I could tell you what this chorus sounds like if you held me at gunpoint. I forget what this song sounds like everytime I finish listening to it, I'm sorry. But when I AM listening to it I am absolutely getting my life. It's well-produced synthpop, and as I listen to it as I type this that 'Never backin' it up backin' it up' moment is epic and definitely lifts the end product. But ultimately, I just find it overshadowed by most of the other songs in the rate.

---

**radiofan15** (9.2): This feels so nostalgic somehow...

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the drama sustains me

**twat_brained** (9): I don't remember this being on the Prisoner of Azkaban soundtrack… would've made it a hell of a lot better if you ask me

**wavingwolves** (9): this is like a modernized version of an abba song and it's marvelous

**2l82bstr8** (8): it's great, but I don't feel liek it makes the best use out of empty space. it feels like it's running longer than it actually is, and not in the good way.

**bespectacIed** (9): The class! The vocals!, the production! The crispness of the MV makes me hard to believe this was released 8 years ago, it looks and sounds like a 2019 k-pop track. This song is a serve on all levels, but apparently just a Day 2 quality song.

**agentofscranton** (6): This would absolutely stomp on Eurovision. Take that however you wanna take it. That almost eurodance quality, and Gayoon's amazing vocals both work hand in hand to create this absolute monster of a club track. It's never totally clicked with me, but as time goes by I'm growing to like it more and more. Who knows maybe a year from now I might consider this a 10, but for now, Volume Up leaves us at #35, which, considering it spent the early parts of this rate languishing amongst other Day 1 songs, it's pretty respectable!

---

**dynamicity** (10): This was the song that fueled me to my record 5k time in high school cross country and for that it MUST receive a 10.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): Jiyoon’s vocals!

**skargardin** (10): SNATCHED

**NuneEtsuko** (9.5): Underrated 4minute song, Hyuna looked its best during this era, the costumes and overall looks during live stages were fire and the song is perfection

**2l82bstr8** (9): this song is shady af... it almost feels like a dig at record label executives, or netizens, or misogyny in general... wow I can't believe 4minute invented feminism! of course, it's an excellent song regardless. tell me that banging buildup and chorus doesn't make you wanna dance and smash things! and Gayoon's vocals sound almost operatic and really make her and the whole song shine

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): one of those rare kpop songs where the chorus is outshone by the verses, but the sax that pops in saves it

**franch** (9): retro shoutouts like "pump up the volume" can really go either way with me but this one hit right.

**heeyeon** (9): what a bop, inna could never

**twat_brained** (9): my volume is up only because I'm in the car with my dad while it's pissing it down outside. I'm glad it's up though because the Eurodance feel is everything

**wavingwolves** (9): ok now that's what i call classic music

**Shinkopeshon** (8.6): This is one hell of a leap from Hot Issue in every way. Also, the sheer sex appeal is blinding me and it's something I haven't really seen in many 3rd gen girl groups, who I always find cute or elegant but rarely sexy - which isn't a bad thing at all, it's just an interesting observation.

**fadedblue09** (8): I like the saxophone/horn thingy that plays in the verses, plus it has a solid hook.

**Maybe9** (8): a club banger

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): A mild bop

**Qwilphish** (7.5): I'm a hoe for a good saxophone, but that chorus did not live up to that super killer build up however unfortunately

**Qustomar** (7): this sounds like that 2010s type of euroclub banger song. dj saxobeat, on the floor, you make me feel, stereo love. i think it's because of the sample

**sarcasticsobs** (7): vid’s right up my alley though

**therokinrolla** (7): i was very surprised by how not bad this was tbh

**untutorable** (7): this is a very SEXY song and one of the most memorable when it comes to 4minute at their peak

**1998tweety** (6.5): Another song where the production slaps but their voices are awful

**nowqueenofpop** (6.5): Tell me why I heard both Meet Me Halfway by Black Eyed Peas and Stereo Love by Edward Maya and Vika Jigulina when this started playing. So I looked it up to see if maybe it sampled either and instead found an “article” saying that it actually has the same sax line as this Romanian song so I would like to thank 4Minute for truly capturing the years 2009-2012 in one song

**cutefuss** (5.7): getting there...getting there

**AnimationJava** (5): To me it sounds like there was a lot of noise it didn't really feel well-mixed/used in the production of the song.

**radiofan15** (4.2): Jazz sax aside... this is generic af

**MrSwearword** (3): what kind of ripoff JLO beat is this, iCannot

**agentofscranton** (10): And with Heart Attack's exit, we finally cut our first AOA song, leaving Brown Eyed Girls as the final group to have their songs in tact. How to comment on Heart Attack? It's kind of objectively a loud, messy, and annoying song, but god if that's not what I absolutely stan in a song. The girls look fucking gorg in the music video. Seolhyun especially, who also has my favourite part in the song with her little moment after the second chorus. I'm a bit peeved to see it go out so soon, but like I said, it's kind of objectively a mess, so I can't say I'm surprised.

**bespectacIed** (9): As an unofficial 2.5 Generation group. AOA really transitioned seamlessly to the brightly-colored bubblegum pop world of 3rd Gen with the fun, flirty, synthy Heart Attack. It’s truly one of the catchiest songs of the latter half of the decade, but sadly this bop stayed middling in the rate.

**1998tweety** (10): A fucking masterpiece, HUGE bop

**dynamicity** (10): It's loud as fuck and I love it.

**Qustomar** (10): perfect summertime song, something for the girls to dance to

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): they've yet to top this song - it's such a beautiful, straightforward summer jam!

**Shinkopeshon** (8.5): The production is so good. I'll definitely delve deeper into their discography.

**untutorable** (8): so catchy and fun! jimin's "HEY!" is a classic

**twat_brained** (7.9): I feel it too, it gets my heart thumping!

**fadedblue09** (7.6): Very catchy but those male backing chants in the chorus were unnecessary.

**JohnnyToby** (7): wait this kinda bops, also I just realized AOA and Apink are separate groups..

**Maybe9** (7): runway club pop garbage, i live

**Qwilphish** (6): not as solid as their other songs in this rate

**rickikardashian** (6): i couldnt remember what this sounded like while it was playing. also am i supposed to think that they were ugly before their big transformation in this video? they looked the same and were equally as hot before and after, they didn't even try to be stereotypical and put some braces or glasses on them

**Unprettiest** (5.5): omg who tf mixed and mastered this song? these girls need a refund

**heeyeon** (5): and when brave brothers is bad, he is really bad. the production is a hot mess, but props to choa's pipes for carrying this thing

**radiofan15** (4.9): Are their vocals this pitched up and their songs this generic all the time?

**AnimationJava** (4.5): I was surprised to see this song was released in 2015 tbh.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): Coming into this rate I had a couple of songs that I knew for a fact I was just gonna give a 10, the Anna Kendrick-certified slapper Electric Shock was one of them. That moment where the instrumental cuts off in the final chorus for that e-e-electric shock gets me high. But relistening to it over the month I found that I was just enjoying the song less and less. It still bops don't get me wrong, but it's just not the 10 it once was. Katy Perry's post-Teenage Dream career teas (Never Really Over notwithstanding).

**bespectacIed** (4): One of f(x)’s most well-known hits and one of the first k-pop songs to reach 100M views (back when that record meant something). I daresay Electric Shock is f(x)’s signature song. Y’all might remember this hit in that campy 2013 college humor sketch with Anna Kendrick. Electric Shock unfortunately sounds dated in 2013 and it sounds tired now … and it shows with the way y'all kicked this iconic bop out of the rate.

---

**2l82bstr8** (10): and this is where it starts. it's one of the most danceable songs in kpop. you can't not shake your ass to this.

**DaBigBoi** (10): e-e-e-electric shock

**dynamicity** (10): I think this was the first kpop song where I actually looped a teaser because I absolutely could not wait for the song to drop.

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): perfect 10

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): okay this one has grown on me lately! one of my faves on my running playlist

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Iconic banger that does a good job of making the production and the vocals stand out equally.

**twat_brained** (9.2): If the drop was a bit cleaner this would be a 10 from me.

**heeyeon** (9): the bridge. that's it

**Qwilphish** (9): mike pence:

**Unprettiest** (8.8): Sulli's shining moment, the tenderness in her voice on that final pre-chorus was that special something. Also, "ne sarang-i seolsahae" - Anna Kendrick

**radiofan15** (8.7): As someone who nearly died after electrocuting myself when I was 10 I can't help but to feel triggered by this song... but as someone who loves boppy pop music, I gotta BOP and forget my trauma...

**1998tweety** (8.5): Massive bop, this is where they finally started to show up

**untutorable** (8.5): me when the government tries to make me straight

**AnimationJava** (7): An aged bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I’m never sure to feel about this song because it’s simultaneously super cool and painfully flat at the same time

**rickikardashian** (6.8): i found a tweet that had the chorus of this song with the caption “gays when pence becomes president”

**Maybe9** (6.5): there is nothing interesting about this song

**dlong5665** (4): idk why people like this song its the least f(x) song ever smh

**MrSwearword** (1): how much RedOne lite/Gaga knockoffery transpired with KPOP in 2009-2012? I'm over it by this point in the rate.

**bespectacIed** (9): Misandrist, cross-dressing queens!!! This is such a quintessential SNSD song (lol you could say this to their entire discography) that showcased SNSD’s strong vocals and visuals in a macabre-but-still-fierce-because-this-is-still-k-pop MV concept. At times, this feels like SM Entertainment’s attempt to give SNSD a Danja track, but that should be a bad thing, right??? Britney wishes she had this on Breakout. I love everything about this song except maybe for the bridge breakdown, but c’mon… that final chorus where everyone just goes ham and the [unofficial] vocal line tugged at each other’s wig with each of their insane vocal runs?? Life-changing.

**agentofscranton** (7): The misandrist Blackout b-side that wasn't. Mr.Mr. is a bit of a weird one because I live for it - that dance break and the key changes mainly, Love On Top who? - but it's something I struggle to listen to  more than once at a time. That instrumental gets really grating on my ears after a while and I always end up having to skip it. This is also SNSD's final comeback with their original line-up as soon after Jessica left/was removed from the group. At least she left on a high, I guess. That final chorus is the stuff gay dreams are made of - Jessica, Tiffany, Seohyun, and Taeyeon constantly one-upping each other? Talent, laid ease. Talent.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Another masterpiece. Greedy literally ripped the chorus off of this and no one can tell me otherwise.

**Agusarg** (10): It sounds amazing. The more hip hop inspired verses combined with that pop chorus is so good. The key change is also a really nice touch, just all around amazing

**hikkaru** (10): love on top who

**Maybe9** (10): the high notes and the breakdowns of this song will forever be iconic

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): TWO KEY CHANGES FUCK ME UP QUEENS

**Qwilphish** (10): such a clean and immaculately produced pop song. this is pop perfection. cmon dance break!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): The song that made me a stan. The entire album is perfection.

**twat_brained** (9.4): I'm running out of things to say, these women just rule

**radiofan15** (9.2): So... his actual name is Mister?

**dynamicity** (8): Solid synthpop.

**MrSwearword** (8): bold for them, snaps in order for that

**taeneon** (8): rip ot9

**Unprettiest** (7.9): i wanna say 9 but people will hate me

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.6): Anyone else remember the Mr. Men books and that tv show based off of them? I loved those

**fadedblue09** (7.1): Whew their bubblegum sounds are back. I think this is a fine balance between the bubblegum and the heavy electropop.

**2l82bstr8** (7): if a scientist could somehow synthetize the male homosexual gene and render it in a sound file, it would sound exactly like the last minute of this song

**wavingwolves** (7): this song is like the 😏 emoji

**cutefuss** (6.7): sometimes i think about how the music video got messed up because some of the video files got deleted and get sad...i think this could have been a better visual/concept era for them if that hadn't happened

**AnimationJava** (6.5): The high note at the end of Mr. Mr. carried the song for me! Some great vocal performances.

**JohnnyToby** (6): it's so funny to me that they ran outta concepts to do so they tried to do an f(x) concept...

**franch** (5): love SNSD and this has to be my least fav of theirs

**smile-on-crayon** (5): Their other song, "Catch Me If You Can", is much better even though there are parts I don't like about that song too. However, their some of the members' solo work do better in going down the realm "Mr.Mr." tried. Check HYO's "Punk Right Now"/"Badster" or Yuri + Seohyun's "Secret" or Yuri's "Always Find You". Those hit harder.

- leaked concept months ahead of time and SM falsely denied it

- a new scandal (dating or otherwise) every week with thousands of hate comments as netizens turned on the group

- SM accidentally deleting the original MV footage

- SM forgetting to delay the album release on iTunes after they delayed it on Melon so all the songs leaked ahead of time

- the first of SNSD's releases to commercially underperform

- the lights turning off when Hyoyeon got her 3 second dance break and the second half of the dance break having the vocal line in the center

**agentofscranton** (10): AOA really outsold both James Bond and Cats (2019) with that music video, whew. A moment most pleasing to me in my career. This song was pretty firmly set in the top 20 until it started getting hit with bad to middling scores that sent it crashing down into Day 2 where it's ended up. Nobody does sexy quite like AOA imo. It leans really hard on the sexy but also maintains AOA's trademark quirkiness, and melds them both into one of AOA's signature songs. Jimin's rap also bangs, but that's not a surprise. Oh what I'd give to be good, hot, fresh, and fly.

**bespectacIed** (10): I’ve said it so many fucking times in this rate, but pretty girls doing pretty things in k-pop is just my fucking brand. Like A Cat exploited the power of strong visuals and presentation with this iconic song and music video.. From the cute heist-themed music video, to Jimin’s cat-like (duh) rap verse, to the groovy verses and chorus, AOA truly produced one of their signature songs in this comeback. They’re good, they’re high, they’re hot, they’re fly … and we’re happy.

**agentofscranton** (6): It's been over a month since we opened the rate and I've been fiddling with my score for Sugar Free constantly the whole time, and even now as I type this I'm still not entirely sure if 6 is the right score to give this song. It's an absolute ride of a song, but it's not a ride I want to go on all the time. That chorus is absolutely amazing but I am not a big fan of those drops, unless I'm in a mood where I am a fan - who knows, maybe when we actually reveal this song I'll be screaming robbery and calling for my own head for not giving it the 10 it deserves.

**bespectacIed** (6): True to its title, T-ara eschewed their sweetness and quirkiness with this pure EDM club bop that left all of our wigs in disarray. The girls are snatched, music video is a serve, the chorus is joyous and irresistible, but in the long run, this song was a little too generic to make a real mark on me.

**AnimationJava** (8): This track kinda goes off! My teeth are currently thanking T-ARA for saving them from cavities.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A month ago I actually bought one of those huge packs of generic store brand cookies for $3 along with a jar of frosting and I ate like seven cookies a day and some frosting every day for several weeks and then when I ran out I noticed that I was super tired and lightheaded for the next few days and I realized I accidentally gave myself a sugar addiction and was experiencing withdrawals. I just came down off of them but I went to the store yesterday and bought more cookies and one of those no-bake Reeses deserts so mama mia here we go again!

**bespectacIed** (10): Wonder Girls’ signature song! Their most iconic song, concept, look, choreo, music video, and, let’s admit it ... FOLLY. We would have been satisfied with this song being the South Korean megahit that it is, but of course we have to be reminded by WG’s, uhm, *interesting* international attempts. This retro-pop hit is the first ever k-pop song to chart in Billboard Hot 100, and one of the most iconic k-pop songs ever. [It’s also the only Wendy Williams-approved k-pop song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHFL-mIeZX4) --- if that doesn’t spell iconic I don’t know what does. P.S. Wonder Girls paved the way

**agentofscranton** (7): There's nothing I hate more in pop music than a video where the song doesn't start until like a minute in - or in the case of Nobody, two minutes in. Nobody is a LEGENDARY song and there's no denying that, a Wendy Williams approved bop. Their attempt to make waves in the States (rightly) catches a lot of flack, but I commend the attempt to really push k-pop onto the global stage. We love pioneers.

---

**2l82bstr8** (10): the original international market crossover! this still bops so hard! their voices sound so full here

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): real legend shit

**fadedblue09** (10): Ah, the nostalgia…. Wouldn't be upset if it wins.

**hiramutsu** (10): It's phenomenal and everywhere at the time

**MrSwearword** (10): BOP ALERT, this slays

**Qwilphish** (10): this was the first kpop song i ever listened to. my sister and cousin forced me to learn the dance at midnight when i was in elementary school

**radiofan15** (10): "Legendary" is not enough to describe it...

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (10): ICONIC

**wavingwolves** (10): the first time i listened to this song was when they were touring with the jonas brothers and it got me hooked instantly. such a hit!!!

**twat_brained** (9.6): I remember this from their set at the Jonas Brothers’ concert. I enjoyed that one. I still enjoy it to this day.

**DaBigBoi** (9): Stream the Wonder Girls Movie!

**dynamicity** (9): Legendary.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Iconic

**Maybe9** (8.5): production carries this song

**therokinrolla** (8): yall remember when they sang this on the wendy williams show? queens of charting in america

**franch** (7.5): i don't really love wonder girls's 1970s shtick but this is the best of it

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): If it weren’t for this song we wouldn’t have *Make It Pop* so I owe them this much

**Qustomar** (7): a lil too stagnant for me, idk i think i just have a mixed relationship with jyp productions

**smile-on-crayon** (7): The MV storyline is smooth and cohesive than a lot of even what Fall Out Boy had at the time. Contemporary R&B can be hit or miss for me though. I think the clothing here, or the dresses, could have been better.

**agentofscranton** (9): In Alone, we see the SISTAR girls come for Naomi Smalls' gig in a bid to establish themselves as the leg queens, and boy do they. That routine is absolutely glorious. They make being gorgeous look so effortless, and that's before we even get to the song! It just sounds like luxury, it sounds so glam, and expensive. It's the music that would be playing as a fierce spy lady seduces the bad guy before slitting his throat to steal the plans that'll help MI5 to disarm the nuclear bombs heading for the moon. Whew.

**bespectacIed** (8): Sistar continued to be Starship’s flagship girl group with the release of their follow up to the massive So Cool. Alone is Sistar’s jazz-y foray into a dark, sexy concept, and it worked splendidly. This song just sounds so expensive and lush, with a hot-red music video to boot that is Sistar’s most viewed Youtube mv to date.

---

**letsallpoo** (11): this is highkey the best song in the rate but i dont think we're ready for that conversation yet. the effortless sexiness, the tension, the drama...it's PERFECTION

**dynamicity** (10): Now this is the best Brave Bros song.

**gabcac** (10): "don't wanna cry, destroy my ass" same, Hyorin

**JohnnyToby** (10): The way they are missed...

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): another sexy 10

**MrSwearword** (10): one of the few songs to try and be current but also not sound as "westernized" or tryhard/obvious.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): If for nothing else, they deserve the 10 for dancing like that in those darn high heels and looking like absolute goddess and not at all awkward. The song is also an absolute jam with Hyorin's voice as always shining

**Qustomar** (10): this song is so addictive, it hooks you like nothing else

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**fadedblue09** (9): Nice retro-flavored jam.

**wavingwolves** (9): they invented sexy concepts with this one

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): cries while lifting right leg up 90 degrees

**twat_brained** (8.4): certainly pops but doesn't quite have the pull that So Cool delivers

**smile-on-crayon** (8): Girl's Day did it better with their song, "Something". The saving grace was the chorus, which is iconic. I'll repeat it again, everything about that chorus was iconic. The choreo with the music [kisses fingers like a chef] was perfect.

**Maybe9** (7): fine

**Qwilphish** (7): so sad so sexy

**1998tweety** (6): Boring and I don't like the production

**cutefuss** (5.6): this kind of music isn't my thing but we're on our way

**agentofscranton** (10): Shocker, I also love THIS aggressively hyper-active super saccharine song. It's Gee on steroids, with an added 8-bit inspired instrumental, what's not to love? Also, I wish so much that I was a k-pop fan back when this song came out. The full body gag I would've had at the concept change tease at the end of the video.

**bespectacIed** (9): Y’all know we love TWICE in this house, but they are not the first 9-member girl group who did a varsity concept, SNSD did! Riding high from the legendary success of Gee is another sugary sweet hit with an onomatopoeic chorus from SNSD in the form of Oh, and we fucking love it!!! This song’s Japanese video game-inspired production is just ridiculously cute, with a repetitive hook practically designed to never leave your head.

---

**taeneon** (11): also this song is 100 times better if u scream the fanchants at the end

**alwayswords** (10): cheer up is thinking

**fadedblue09** (10): Electro-bubblegum perfection. I feel like this is inferior to Gee but I can't help giving it a 10.

**JohnnyToby** (10): invented...that!

**Maybe9** (10): prime bubble pop, this song is clinically registered as an SSRI antidepressant

**Qwilphish** (10): tell me boy boy love i-i-i-i-it OH

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**sailormunelune** (9.5): stan Oh!GG

**dlong5665** (9): tell me tell me boy love it it it it It it ah

**dynamicity** (9): Gee but better and with a double chorus.

**Qustomar** (9): love it but satan made this one

**1998tweety** (8.5): big bop

**twat_brained** (8.5): I could watch and hear these girls perform all day

**NuneEtsuko** (8.1): So cheesy and somehow SNSD make it work

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Pick me anthem!

**smile-on-crayon** (8): It reminds me of middle school in the way it could be an intro to a hero cartoon show like the Teen Titans or Kim Possible. And back to that theme park... it was summer. I'm riding on the fast modern merry-go-round thing, that for some reason has a DJ, while the sun sets and nearing twilight. "Everytime We Touch" by Cascada just finished. Gosh, the memories. It was only a day though.

**misconceptionsofyou** (7): and i'm being nice

**rickikardashian** (6.9): considering they’re like 20 girls in the band, the way they do choreo is v satisfying

**2l82bstr8** (6): yeah I don't really care for this one. it's not bad, but it just crosses the line into cringe for me.

**radiofan15** (5.5): They really kept trying to recapture that Gee magic, isn't it?

**AnimationJava** (5): I found the constant repetition of vowels to be a bit grating to be honest.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I was like “why have I never heard this one before?” and then I clicked play

**wavingwolves** (5): i respect the hustle but it's not their best

**cutefuss** (4.1): and i hate oh! not just because i find it to be a meh song overall...but because the visuals are so childish and dated

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah I won’t hide my irk with the early exit of this perfect bop, it’s so incomprehensible to me ... DAY 2??? Really??? One of my favorite SNSD songs ever. Sadly this is the end of the road for, in my opinion, the BETTER of the double-lead single release from SNSD's "final" album as OT8 (Holiday is a bop too, don't @ me). Released at their 10th year anniversary, this bubblegum neo-disco perfection is my favorite change of sound for these k-pop legends. The twinkly production and vocals in this party anthem are just so damn irresistible. The music video, which features drag queens, perfectly captured the fever dream quality of a disco night out with your girl friends in downtown Seoul. Echoing Yoona's iconic intro: we DO like to party ... and we would love to party with OT8 again :(

**agentofscranton** (9): I'm shocked this didn't place higher. Eurodance-tinged synthpop seems like such obvious popheads catnip that I'm gooped it only placed at #28. It even edged out of the top 40 at one point. Unfortunately serving as the current goodbye single for Girls' Generation (or at least OT8 lineup), All Night is just really cathartic. Especially right now in quarantine, listening to All Night makes me feel like I'm in some basic club with all my friends having the best time. And that music video !! SNSD said gay rights.

---

**JohnnyToby** (10): YUP yall made the right choice bc I would've given Holiday a 2 lmao

**Maybe9** (10): can you tell im a stan

**Qwilphish** (10): snsd said gay rights. such a great song and the mv is so so so great.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**waluigiest** (10): what a glittery bop wow

**twat_brained** (9.6): what a sendoff song in this rate from the undisputed titans of female kpop. I love these ladies after hearing their music and watching their videos.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Thank you for choosing this over Holiday, cause this is a massive bop. The production is amazing.

**Agusarg** (9.5): Great disco vibes

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): ugh this is the sugary fun shit i love!

**radiofan15** (8.8): They're really coming for Dua Lipa's neck!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is like a copy of “Sugar” by Maroon 5 which is itself a copy of “Birthday” by Katy Perry which is itself a copy of Mariah Carey’s debut album so we’re like four steps removed from greatness at this point but this is pretty alright.

**nowqueenofpop** (8.5): I feel like all of my scores are looking like I’m biased towards SM groups… but please look at the material!

**2l82bstr8** (8): I remember not liking this song but this is pretty good! it just sounds too minimal for its own good

**dynamicity** (8): Probably one of their weaker songs in recent memory but one of my favorite music videos.

**smile-on-crayon** (8): Trying to be too cutesy was a turn off. The song's really good but the "We like to party" lyric at the very beginning just had me cringe and want to close the tab. Don't worry though, I listened to the song in its entirety.

**fadedblue09** (7.7): Nowhere near the excellence of their early output but still has some solid production elements.

**AnimationJava** (6): The bubblegum pop noises that mark this track seem like something made for popheads.

**MrSwearword** (6): I'd wager this is the worst attempt at modernizing their sound/matching them to what was contemporary and current at that time.

**skargardin** (6): I can't pinpoint what's missing here, but something definitely is

**wavingwolves** (5): doesn't really matter how much time passes this still feels disappointing... the chorus feels so underwhelming

**bespectacIed** (10): Aaaand the first girl group to leave the rate is 4Minute, which kinda blows my mind??? I thought Crazy was such a landmark song in k-pop. I won’t be surprised if this was the first k-pop song that international k-pop fans have heard, this song was fucking massive! As one of the fastest videos from a 2nd gen k-pop group to reach 100M views on YouTube, Crazy clued me in on the budding international reach of k-pop. This bombastic hip-hop track has arguably become 4Minute's signature track;  it's too sad that it’s a trend in this rate that legendary girl groups released their strongest outputs in the twilight of their careers :(

**agentofscranton** (7): So we come to the end of the road for our 1-2-3-4-4Minute girls, as their signature song (fite me) Crazy bows out at #25, it's highest placement, and highest average! Surprisingly this song, and the girls in general, never managed to crack the top 20, which is a real shock considering I really thought this would be carried into Day 3 by pure virtue of how fucking iconic it is. But I can't say I disagree with it's placement, as bad a bitch as it makes me feel.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): I-C-O-N-I-C! The girls had crazy stage presence during their live stages, and the song is such a jam

**Qwilphish** (10): This song is so off the walls and is such a banger. They deserved so much better after this. A serious 11 contender. ps HyunA in this might be one of the most well-styled kpop idols of all time

**ralah** (10): hyunas styling that era >>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**taeneon** (10): one of the best kpop songs of all time

**wavingwolves** (10): most songs on kpop these days feel like a very watered and safe version of this

**radiofan15** (9.2): boping

**cutefuss** (8.8): and here we are...this song shook the foundations of the kpop world they really did that!

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): we love skrillex

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.4): ugh I LOVE a song that features that kind of pounding before the chorus but also I feel sorry for music historians who will have to try to explain the “farty bass” era of music because I was there for it and I still don’t understand how we came to accept this as music

**smile-on-crayon** (8): If you had "Hate" here, there would have been a higher rating.

**therokinrolla** (8): idc yall skrillex really popped off with this one, 2ne1 wishes

**untutorable** (8): by this time 4minute had a brand and an image and these girls knew what they were about.... idk there's something about this song that is so well executed and i'm ready to chalk it up to jiyoon's existence

**waluigiest** (8): this feels way longer than 3 minutes

**rickikardashian** (7.7): i have no clue when or where but i have seen this video

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): I love how brash and original this is (and after so many years!), but it never clicked for me and idk what it is. it's a little too much? I don't like the pulsating rhythm? idk it's never been my favorite

**AnimationJava** (7): The percussion on this song was my favorite part, not sure about the glass breaking noises though they felt jarring at points.

**dynamicity** (7): Overrated. It's highly impactful at first but it's just tiring on the ears after a while.

Edgy Queens!!!! 4Minute gave 2NE1 a run for its money when it came to being the queens of 2nd generation girl crush. As somewhat of an underdog in 2nd Gen, it has given me so much pleasure to see 4Minute go toe-to-toe with the biggest groups on charts, music shows, and iconic-ness through the years ... [sometimes even beating them!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviA7TcWQB8). While everyone in CUBE Entertainment is grateful for 4Minute for providing food on their plates, we k-pop fans are thankful for being fed with iconic bops.

**dynamicity** (8.333): Po minus

**hiramutsu** (8.000): Hate should be included in the song list

**2l82bstr8** (7.833): it's a shame that the group could be so focused on (and dependent of) HyunA sometimes, but I really liked the melodic aggressiveness they had going on. and Gayoon does not get the credit she deserves - doing this rate made me realize how many of their songs she singlehandedly MADE

**twat_brained** (7.433): i remember these girls too, i think a song of theirs was on the weekly hot 50 in 2017

**Qustomar** (7.167): 4minute is not a kpop gg i check out for oftentimes, for me personally thye have some really good songs but without much of a solid group identity

**therokinrolla** (6.833): Can you believe Hyuna left Wonder Girls for THIS? Jk I know it wasn't that simple, and 4Minute is cute sometimes, it's just that pushing your own hand through a meat grinder is only entertaining for so long before you realize it hurts.

**fadedblue09** (6.500): I need to hear more of their songs to make a better judgment.

**bespectacIed** (10): Y’all know how songs with unusual structures and beat switches are always polarizing/hit or miss in k-pop? That was never the case with Red Light. From the get go, the haphazardness of this song sounds so feverish yet so superbly done. As the title track of yet another stellar f(x) album, Red Light is this group’s successful venture into a darker, more mature production and image, made bittersweet by this being Sulli’s final effort with the group. Also, this era has my favorite k-pop look OF ALL TIME (Luna’s blue. short, angled bob, a fucking SERVE!). I would’ve wanted it to rank higher but it does have a decent place in the rate, and  we all know this isn’t their peak.

**agentofscranton** (8): Another entry into the bonafide batshit and unusually structured folder of k-pop title tracks, Red Light is a bop, no two ways about it. I don't have much to say about this song beyond that, other than it makes me want to storm the Houses of Parliament and take down the government. But doesn't everyone?

---

**2l82bstr8** (11): it couldn't be anything else. this is pretty much the only time I thought k-pop could be anything beyond the prim and proper it prides itself on being. the lyrics are fucked up, warning of a state of emergency (the song is reportedly inspired by the Sewol Ferry incident - again, one of the few times I've seen k-pop being anything close to topical); the music pulsates loduly in the background, like a siren; there are so many little details in the production that you can only take in on multiple listens. (I've been listening to this song for years and I still find something new everytime!) no one did anything like this before or since. if you can only hear one song from this whole rate, this is the one you want to hear

**Agusarg** (10): The beat is fantastic and that bridge godlike

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay let me just say i love when SM girl groups do noisy songs lmao. this chorus never fails to hype me up, and that fucking bridge is just otherworldly

**DaBigBoi** (10): Originally hated this song, but now I be boppin’ HARD

**dynamicity** (10): The bass line on this song....holy moly

**Qustomar** (10): take i got a boy and switch it up for the kpop nerd that likes 2013-era abrasive indie tumblr pop alternative girls

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**skargardin** (10): MAJOR bop alert!

**Qwilphish** (9.5): not mentioned enough when talking about really experimental kpop songs. rip Sulli in her last f(x) mv you will always be missed

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): What an interesting sounding song, it’s so… dangerous? But I’m not sure what the danger is.

**heeyeon** (9): arguably one of the most divisive k-pop songs, chorus takes a while to get used to but the verses more than make up for it. i wish k-pop groups took more risks like this nowadays

**sarcasticsobs** (9): i love watching evolutions of kpop groups. prechorus (?) is my favorite

**Shinkopeshon** (9): That chorus hit me like a truck. Holy shit, what a concept.

**taeneon** (9): they all look amazing but krystals blonde hair was too perfect

**twat_brained** (8.8): For a song with the color “red” literally in the title I would’ve expected the video to have more of a focus on a red palette than what I ended up seeing.

**radiofan15** (8.1): Push me and then you just touch me til I can get my satisfaction

**nowqueenofpop** (8): That build up in the bridge then the chorus right after feels like going up a rollercoaster, hitting the peak, then accelerating downward at 350 mph

**untutorable** (8): one of my favorite bridges in kpop i absolutely ADORE it and i know this song is wild but it still pops off ok

**Unprettiest** (7.8): I know it's a weird af song but that's what makes the bridge such a payoff. Yes, I like pain.

**misconceptionsofyou** (7.5): never really sold on so 7.5

**1998tweety** (7): She's decent

**AnimationJava** (7): The production on this reminds me of Britney, especially the siren blaring noises?

**Maybe9** (7): rihanna disturbia said hiiiiiii

**smile-on-crayon** (6): I can appreciate how SM's producers are trying to expand songs like this by putting tons of elements into it, but it doesn't mean it's good though.

**rickikardashian** (5.8): at no point in this song i knew what was happening next

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): uh this song is kinda a mess

**ralah** (5): music alone would be a 3 from me but the concept+makeup was too iconic

**fadedblue09** (3): Sorry but this is unbearable.

**MrSwearword** (2): we're back to the "too trashy for my liking" sound

**wavingwolves** (0): i never liked this but i feel like with each passing moment i dislike this even more

**agentofscranton** (10): I think about this dance regularly, and everytime it comes on I am overcome with the delusion that I have an ass and am able to pull this routine off well. An absolute juggernaut of a song, it spent most of the voting period firmly lodged within the 11-20 area, but eventually it was overtaken by other songs, and ended up here in 24th, unfortunately the lowest placing it's ever had during the duration of the rate.

**bespectacIed** (9): As much as I would like to believe every song in this rate was created equally and did well equally, there really are some songs that became bigger, more widespread HITS than the rest. One of them is the mega-successful Mr. KARA catapulted into k-pop (and j-pop!) superstardom with this fun, subtly-sensual single, accompanied by an infectious hook and a viral butt dance that literally left South Korea in shambles and changed Korean society. Those baggy fireman pants are an iconic fashion moment! It has an admittedly dated production and sound, but Mr. is undeniably one of the biggest, trademark songs of 2nd Generation.

**untutorable** (8): can't help but dance when i hear this song

**wavingwolves** (8): kara is a group that asked for nothing while delivering everything...

**2l82bstr8** (7): iconic butt dance aside, this really isn't one of their best songs.

**fadedblue09** (7): I'd normally love this kind of pop, but it feels...lacking? The "lalala" part is effective but the rest of the song doesn't live up to it.

**MrSwearword** (7): good energy but a bit weak

**sarcasticsobs** (7): key change

**Qwilphish** (6.5): a product of its era

hyogurt: > It's no Mr.Mr.

and we are grateful for that!


Fun fact for any children wanting a history lesson: KARA's company DSP intended "Wanna" to be the lead title track for this era - hence the lack of official Korean MV for "Mister" but one for "Wanna" - but "Mister" got such good reception from fans and the general public, that DSP changed course... and "Mister" became a hit with an iconic dance and iconic looks.

**agentofscranton** (10): So close and yet so far, miss A's final song falls at 22 and means that Fei, Jia, Min, and Suzy will not be joining us for our Day 3 party. I ADORE this song. The almost hushed (gettit) and wanting delivery makes the song feel so effortlessly sensual, and makes that final chorus with the full instrumental behind them with their delivery becoming more reckless and desperate feel even more epic, and that choreo? Maybe I considered I was attracted to women for a bitsy.

**bespectacIed** (8): One of the most effortlessly sensual songs that JYP has ever produced is the final Miss A track in this rate. This song is one of the most popular Miss A tracks, and it's not hard to understand why. The song and music video effortlessly sensual without being too provocative, and we loved the little darkness it added in miss A's discography. Most importantly though, that choreo with the horizontal bars are an iconic k-pop moment!!!

---

**Agusarg** (10): Beautiful song, the instrumentation is so good. Love the chorus

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): have been obSESSED with this iconic song lately. the gradual build up is just amazing and tbh it's a top 10 chorus in the genre

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): love how mysterious this sounds, like a bunch of faeries beckoning you deeper into the woods

**misconceptionsofyou** (10): the sexiest 10

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**Shinkopeshon** (10): Everything about this is so seductive and that choreo is legendary. What I also appreciate about the production is the fairly stripped down section in the choruses - usually, you'd hear an arrangement like this in the acoustic version, not in the single version, so this is super refreshing and it works so well.

**wavingwolves** (10): i'll shut the fuck up bc this song deserves

**Qwilphish** (9.5): the way that this song progresses and blossoms is really beautiful

**1998tweety** (9): The chorus on this slaps

**2l82bstr8** (9): that chorus still kicks as much ass as when it was released.

**Maybe9** (9): the tempo of this song is so good

**smile-on-crayon** (9): I wished the producers did not use that flute sound in the chorus. I know it needed something, but it wasn't that.

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Sounds very 2010, but still very nice.

**twat_brained** (8.7): I agree, those within the vicinity of this song's radius should hush so I can hear it better

**radiofan15** (8.6): The Pussycat Dolls shivered a little bit but they remain unbothered

**dynamicity** (8.5): Want to ride that subway.....

**MrSwearword** (7): the first chorus had such an anticlimax and I couldn't shake that off

**cutefuss** (6.7): this song really takes off when the more intense production kicks in about 1:30 in. but whenever it tries to take a step back and become more understated it loses it's magic. this sound should have been a constant build up with a bigger payoff at the end.

**JohnnyToby** (5.5): I hate the first chorus bc it feels so bare and scared???but maybe that's what they were trying to do but something still feels wrong in the mixing

# miss A

---

**Overall Average**: 7.445 **// Average Controversy:** 1.976

---

 Probably the reason why the term "monster rookie" had to be coined in k-pop, miss A truly had a career that seemed destined for superstardom. Miss A showed the world what needed to be done the minute they stepped into the limelight and released their first video. They sustained this immense success for half a decade, but they eventually succumbed to a rather abrupt end that seemed inevitable for a group who had one disproportionately popular member. Regardless, these four talented girls produced some of the most iconic and wildly popular hits of the 2nd generation; hits that just wouldn't NOT top the charts even if God herself tried to intervene. Fly high, independent ladies!

---
**NuneEtsuko** (9.700): Really sad there weren't more Miss A songs in this rate, I understand though that not everything could be included; Special mention to Breathe, Touch, GoodBye Baby

**gabcac** (9.550): full of bops

**fadedblue09** (9.300): Solid, catchy bops and they have strong vocals too that don't get overshadowed by the production. Definitely ticks the boxes that I look for in a girl group.

**dynamicity** (8.625): I miss Miss A.

**twat_brained** (8.350): I am 20 seconds in and these ladies are clearly influenced by Ke$ha. This should be fun.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.000): fei's solo shouldve been in the bonus rate tbh!

**2l82bstr8** (7.500): still one of my favorite girl groups. amazing dancers and very unique voices, few did sexy like them!

**selegend** (5.750): the most mediocre of the groups

**cutefuss** (4.175): note for y'all, this group's rates are...low. i do not have a problem with miss a but almost none of their music ever did anything for me.

**agentofscranton** (9): Just missing out on Day 3 is the Kesha-penned smash Run Devil Run, and as expected with a concept change from cute to mature, we here at popheads ate it up. Mostly. It's a serve. It falls a bit flat in comparison to some of the other mature concept songs that are featured in this rate, but that doesn't detract from just how much it slaps.

**bespectacIed** (6): What happens when the top group in k-pop finally ventures into a more mature concept? Servery, of course! This song is iconic for its temporary departure from SNSD’s cute sound, and literally everyone ate it up. But for as much sophistication and fierceness the girls displayed in this comeback, imo this song’s a bit weaker compared with the other femme fatalle hits of this era in k-pop. This is 2nd Gen k-pop we’re talking about, there are better cunty k-pop songs out there.

**1998tweety** (10): Can you say legendaric? This is so damn iconic and was really made me start to stan them. The dance is iconic af.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**twat_brained** (10): do you have a minute to talk about our lordes and savioresses SNSD?

**2l82bstr8** (9): this was my absolute jam back in middle school. I could probably recreate that whole entire video from memory. it's a banger to this day

**JohnnyToby** (9): invented good girl gone bad...also ke$ha or something

**sarcasticsobs** (9): look I like this song a LOT but the best part about it is that its existence caused me to be gifted “devil’s cry”

**waluigiest** (9): run Joey run!

**radiofan15** (8.8): After the 10384th "run" I was sold into this song

**Agusarg** (8.5): The chorus is great. The Kesha demo for it is also pretty fun

**Qustomar** (7.5): i like the idea of this song more than actually listening to it

**letsallpoo** (7): i cannt listen to this without thinking of that video of the high school girls trying to do the dance in public and getting interrupted by some older woman pushing her way through them

**nowqueenofpop** (7): This was technically the first kpop song I listened to by association because I used to be obsessed with the Kesha demo. The harmonizing in the second verse >>>>>! The chorus is so good to listen to…

**wavingwolves** (7): this was one of the first kpop songs i was exposed to because of that kesha demo... so i have to respect it
