Hello Guys, Girls and Non Binary Friends! Welcome to the [**FUTURISTIC FLOPS**](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/396894460128133130/651278766890287106/FuturisticCommercialFlopsRate.jpg) rate, hosted by yours truly /u/JunkyGS . It is amazing to be back hosting a rate a couple years after the last one and especially this time hosting one that I am super passionate about and suggested! 

Before we get into these albums that were all done by ["risk takers that did experimental records that will surpass time and were ahead of its time for certain people, but music people really got"](https://youtu.be/XQUkmVarsRc?t=44) the way this rate will be scored is a bit different!

After over 70% of you voted yes on the poll I posted in the daily discussion, I decided to move forward with doing this rate through a google form you can find [**HERE**](https://forms.gle/vXcuUVkA8ZwnpBNS9). On this google form you will find a video to every song on this rate above where you rate it, that way everything is in one convenient spot! You will have to log in with an email that way nobody spams results, it can save your progress and you can edit your submission at any time by yourself! I hope this will serve as an incentive to those that find doing rates overwhelming, confusing or are new to doing rates in general!


NOW that all of that is out of the way, you may be asking yourself what makes a Futuristic Flop? 
Well they are albums that did not do well commercially, but achieved a cult like status amongst a certain music community and focused on each artists vision of what the future of pop music would sound and look like. Now that it is nearly a decade later, will Popheads finally be able to fully appreciate these albums?

First up is Pitchfork's 8th Best Album of the 2010s, Body Talk by Miss Robyn! Robyn was ahead of her time with her release strategy during this era. She decided to drop 2 EPs the same year before the release of this album titled Body Talk Pt. 1 and Body Talk Pt. 2 because she wanted to be able to release and tour them as they were. This all concluded with the release of Body Talk which took songs from both EPs, along with Body Talk Pt. 3 being released the same day that had 5 songs included on Body Talk. 

The album was critically acclaimed upon release, and has since then achieved a cult status amongst the indie music scene and features the timeless classic Dancing on My Own (which reached Platinum sales in the US nearly a decade after its release thanks to streaming!). The reason it is considered a Futuristic Flop is because this album peaked at #142 on the Billboard 200 and #168 on the UK album chart, achieving no sales certification in any major country (Sorry Denmark your 10,000 sales for Gold Status doesn't count).

1. Fembot

Now for arguably the most infamous album in this rate Bionic! Coming off of 2006's Multi Platinum Back to Basics which featured several platinum singles Christina was on a career high. In 2008 it lead to Christina releasing a Greatest Hits album that went Gold in the US and sold well internally, along with the single It Keep Getting Better that became Christina's biggest debut on the Hot 100 at #7. Well unfortunately for Christina it didn't get better.

In 2010 Christina released the lead single Not Myself Tonight debuting and peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 with a lot of critics panning the song for its lyrics and a hate mob lead by Perez Hilton during PEAK music blog influence because he felt that Christina was ripping off Lady Gaga's look and sound. Christina performed the song at the MTV movie awards, Oprah Winfrey Show and several others, but unfortunately they couldn't save it from it flopping on the charts and achieving no sales certification worldwide besides Gold in Australia (35,000 in sales). 

Upon release the album received mix reviews with most mainstream outlets dismissing it, while some reviewers praised it for the risks it took, including being the first major album to have songs written by songwriter and artist Sia. Pitchfork would later comment on the album stating, "[Bionic was] a risk that could have reaped the rewards of poptimism if the album had only been released a few years later." The album was the lowest selling album in her career and the low sales resulted in Christina having to cancel a supporting tour for the album called The Bionic Tour. Since then it has achieved a cult status in stan culture and most music critics looking back on the album more fondly then they did upon it's release.

**Tracklist**

1. Bionic
2. Not Myself Tonight
3. Woohoo (feat. Nicki Minaj)
4. Elastic Love
5. Desnudate
6. Glam
7. Prima Donna
8. Sex for Breakfast
9. Lift Me Up
10. All I Need
11. I Am
12. You Lost Me

[**Kelis - Flesh Tone**](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QMzwscDnGgzGGpFNvjvCt59pX6RX5lJLuot6cF2OzudoiI1U3aebQWSoiDgP2_E1B4UhT3QlQVB2j-VAitiUXzj4UiCqlfC7kD_YtmTIBRMS_UG2VVVvqwcnuA0UeIwhGF1UZZAmYx8cNHo)

Now for the least well known and shortest album in this rate Flesh Tone. You may know Kelis best for her hit Milkshake, but don't be fooled into dismissing her as a non-serious artist or a one hit wonder. For Flesh Tone you will find Kelis at her most ambitious! It is an electronic dance album, before edm took over the mainstream! It featured production and writing by A Listers and Future A Listers Will.I.Am, David Guetta, Benny Benassi, Boys Noize, Burns, James Fauntleroy and others. The songs all bleed into one another with Kelis' brilliant use of "Segues" for a very cohesive listening experience. Unfortunately this was not enough for Flesh Tone to achieve commercial success as it debuted at #48 on the Billboard Top 200 selling 7,800 copies in its first week. 


**Tracklist**

1. Intro
2. 22nd Century
3. 4th of July (Fireworks)
4. Home
5. Acapella
6. Scream
7. Emancipate
8. Brave
9. Song for the Baby
10. Carefree American (Bonus Track)

[**Kylie Minogue - Aphrodite**](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ncmG3OCT2D0_SJfgmQ_2yidP0BreOiQ6W5JKcnRBXSMxztVZAAe3TAN-8E3EjvjPFYm9bdhRXZaPlWHr-90rc5cDJ68UB7lGH_oc0cpOxe1sgeqlI2MlHEO_PqwKFCfK9J49kR8TJYFzmI)

Now for arguably the most popular album in the rate Aphrodite! This album is the follow up to 2007's X, which was Kylie's first album post dealing with breast cancer. X had modest success with some mixed reviews by critics, so this time around Kylie wanted to come back in a big way! She recruited A list producers Calvin Harris, Stuart Price, Starsmith, Sebastian Ingrosso and others to help her craft a proper return to form. The album is a mix of various dance genres, but received acclaim for its cohesiveness. 

The album did peak at #1 in the UK Chart, but sadly only peaked at #19 on the Billboard 200. The album's lead single All the Lovers was a commercial hit peaking in the Top 10 of several countries, however missing the the Top 10 in Australia which was considered an under-performance. The second single Get Outta My Way was a bigger disappoint being the first single by Kylie to miss the UK top 10 since 1997. This trend sadly continued with the following singles Better than Today and Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love). I decided to include 3 bonus tracks in the track-listing due to popular demand and it also makes it match up with the other 2 albums having 15 tracks (Sorry Kelis!)

**Tracklist**

1. All The Lovers
2. Get Outta My Way
3. Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)
4. Closer
5. Everything is Beautiful
6. Aphrodite
7. Illusion
8. Better than Today
9. Too Much
10. Cupid Boy
11. Looking for an Angel
12. Can't Beat the Feeling
13. Heart Strings (Bonus Track)
14. Mighty Rivers (Bonus Track)
15. Go Hard or Go Home (Bonus Track)

**RULES**
---

1) You Must Rate Every Song [The google form won't let you submit it unless you ;) ]

2) You will be able to rate a song between a 1 - 10 (with decimals being in counts of .5)

3) You may give 1 song in the entire rate a 0 and 1 song in the entire rate your 11.

4) I will keep an eye out for any obvious sabotaging. If I catch you I will have to message you to change your score(s).

I am very excited to be hosting this rate and hopefully exposing people to some new music they would have never checked out before! I also hope the change in how you submit the scores will make it easier / beginner friendly to people old and new to doing rates, because I don't want to say how long I spent making the google form + finding youtube versions of all the songs that should work for everybody no matter where you live. Feel free to DM me with any questions, comments, concerns, etc. &lt;3

 And as always [STREAM JANET JACKSON]( https://open.spotify.com/album/7qxMrD1a1AEWPmTiiltWda)
