Futuristic Flops Rate Reveal Day 1: Are you ready, ready, ready to go?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ewvr56/futuristic_flops_rate_reveal_day_1_are_you_ready/

Welcome to the first day of the Futuristic Flops Rate starring Robyn, Christina Aguilera, Kelis and Kylie Minogue! 

For Day 1 we will be revealing the first 21 songs (#54 - #34).

---

Here is some info about the rate!

**Number of Participants:** [44]( https://pastebin.com/R8mYmFfM) Beautiful, Talented, Hilarious, Genius People

**Average Score**: 7.525

**Please Read:** Amount of Time spent manually typing up these posts + inserting everybody’s comments + scores + organizing everything because I decided to naively not use the usual rate program in favor of doing something “left lane” with good intentions to possibly increase participation over the course of the past 3 days: 15.5 hours (so far...)

So as a result of the unexpected amount of time + mental stress this has taken on me after talking with our rate overlords to decide how we should move forward; we agreed on instead of pushing back the reveal I would keep the reveal as scheduled & just paste the comments without names because after trying I realized that part would have taken me several more hours. Sorry for not meeting your expectations and thank you for your understanding + participation <3 <3

---
We will begin at **6pm EST** in this thread, as well as in the **[plug!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)** Join us for some futuristic flops, some shitposts, and other bops!

**Saturday** will be begin at **6pm EST** as well, with **Sunday** beginning at **3pm EST**

First song being out is by Miss Robyn to my surprise! I definitely didn't expect this much hate for the song because it is such a non-offense groovy bop!

---

* Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do's pretentious and somehow more repetitive sister.

* truly a creepy bop

* Okay but who’s dancing to this?

* This used so many big words, I feel stupid after listening to this. Like what even are consolidating assets am I just dumb or...

* I some weird kind of way I do like this song but overall I think the weirdness goes a little too far.

POP HEADS SAID NO TO MISANDRY!

---

Girl me too

memes derived from the title aside this is where the album started to plummet in quality. You really can't follow such a powerful ballad like You Lost Me with THIS.

summer 2017 I was driving around town with 2 friends. We were all independently having boy problems so we blasted this song and screamed it for all the streets to hear

The rest of Bionic seems raw, and embracing of sexuality. Meanwhile, this comes off as a song written by a 15 year old girl who just went through a beak-up, with no subtlety or nuance. (Also, as a bi, I cannot endorse something about hating boys

kind of groovy but the misandristic and size shaming lyrics are super yikes...

Lyrics are serving edgy 14 year old girl with a Panic! addiction

This over Prima Donna as a single? Ugh.

Misandry, like misogyny, can be used well in music if it leads to a bigger picture. This neither uses it well nor does the song sound original, it uses the drum beat for I Kissed A Girl and it feels like Christina's rehashing Keeps Gettin' Better.

Thank god this song came on when it did. I almost fell asleep from the last 5 songs and missed it

Having 5 ballads in a row followed by I Hate boys was a choice

She really had a string of the most emotional, honest ballads of her career and decided that the best song to follow them would be this. Okay. The fact that this made the album but “Birds Of Prey” was relegated to the deluxe version and “Little Dreamer” was stuck as an iTunes bonus track is criminal.

Ballads + Bionic = Early Out. Sorry X Teen </3

Wow Christina really brought her A-game on the back half, these are some of the best ballads of her career. Her and Sia make a pretty good team? I think the songs they did together are better than a lot of the songs Sia’s done for other artists. She’s resisted the urge to over sing here and the result is so warm and sensual, the song is so smooth and elastic. This feels very out of place on the track list but it’s good so I’ll let it slide.

damn, all the ballads in this album are just stellar

Lift Me Up is the superior ballad. This was a snoozefest. I would probably give it around a 4 or a 5, but since it is my least favorite in the rate and is already pretty low, I am giving it my 0.

She's versatile I'll give her that.

I like this, but it's not...futuristic? I think this album doesn't know what it's doing

Absolutely stunning

---

Madame X found Killed In Action

Raw and beautiful lyrics but pretty boring

Haven't listened to this in years... wow it's Sia.

Army of Lovers is quaking.

this song is so melodramatic I need it to become an ironic TikTok meme

Halfway through the album Christina just gives up on the robot thing and does a bunch of ballads, and while I think these songs are generally stronger than the first half I think this is the only one that really *fits* into the album. Something about the instrumentation with its mechanical strings and tinkling piano sound almost clockwork like, as if we’re watching Christina be assembled in front of us. It’s like something out of a Pixar movie. This song comes as something of a surprise from her, ESPECIALLY this deep into such a gluttonous/artificial album. She sounds warm and vulnerable here, the simplicity of the lyrics really works for the message and humanizes her quite a bit. This is probably the peak of the album, and one of my favorite Christina songs in general.

Drake and Rihanna are shaking, but being a trail blazer did not help out Robyn this time. 

---

**Agusarg** Not terrible, but the album would be better off without it

**Rotating3DText** so, uhm, can a swedish singer be a dancehall queen? I'm confused
**Jexan13** the worst song of Body Talk. But well, I guess that not everything can be electro pop perfection

She was ahead of her time on the dancehall trend and also ahead of the curve because this is great.

I do not like this one either. The chorus is oddly slow and just kind of grating. The more I think about this song the lower I make the score.

The production on this song was phenomenal. It was so fresh and unique, truly puts the futuristic in futuristic flops. Also that switch up in beat during the last chorus, phew!

Love listening to this song when I take the bus to town sitting in the back talking to no-one.

POPHEADS ALSO SAID MISANDRY RIGHTS! Christina can’t win no matter what gender she supports lol

---

Turn the guitar in this song into a synth and give it to Charli XCX and the gays would lose their mind over this.

And this... is tragic.

There was a solid minute where I thought the featured artist was Lovely Peaches
I love that Le Tigre made it onto this album... random as fuck but also really awesome?

Best part of this one is the Peaches verse of course.

this sounds like it was made for a girls' sleepover and nothing else. Songs like Come On Over Baby and Fighter work in such an environment because the songs fit the mood without being restricted to it. I'm so over this album

i think the fact it says (feat. peaches) [feat. peaches] on apple music is funny

was trying to figure out why my girls sounds so different from the rest of the album and is actually pretty good, of course it was produced and written by le tigre lol sia could never!

Popheads said no to a sex song, but that should not come as a surprise to anybody…..

---

not a huge fan of slow burners but this one gets an exception. Damn, so sexy

amazingly slayed me as it's a very good ballad/slow jam. Not Myself Tonight is the worst Christina Aguilera song in existence, yes, even worse THAN ACCELERATE.

Unfortunately, gays don't believe in breakfast and simply skip to brunch.

I wasn't expecting a slow jam on this album based on the tracks so far but I'm not complaining. This was really smooth and vocally well done.

You could add this to Stripped and no one would notice.

Groovy but not for me.

I actually love everything about this? The vocal delivery, the production, the backing vocals, just amazing all-around

"All done." --Me with this album

First of all, justice for “Sex For Breakfast,” it would make Day 2 at LEAST. But I love “Sex For Breakfast” as well, on such a polarizing album it’s one of the few songs I think that everybody can agree is good. It’s probably aged the best of anything on the album, I feel like tons of pop/r&b girls are making songs that sound just like this today and they aren’t doing half as well as Christina did with this song. She commits the silly “sex as food” metaphor and unlike some of the other songs on the album (*cough* “Elastic Love”) the quirky concept actually works. It’s so silky and sensual, she is HORNY and I’m all here for it.

We get into the ballad section of the album here, this one is another Linda Perry song and those are always good. I like the electronic flourishes on this song, they give it a ‘00s feel that’s very appealing to me.

i'm crying

Oh no my taste is showing.

It gets progressively better. One of the better ballads from the album

Kinda reminds of Gaga's "fashion!" for some reason but more underwhelming.

i'm sorry im a ugly unfashionable bish CHRISTina, i failed you

The banshee wails in the end send me someplace else.

Fashion! by Gaga outsold but this was still a fun bop

I don't know how to describe it but this song has this element to it I absolutely love. It's like that low-key fun melodic groove, same vibe as "Eh, Eh, (Nothing Else I Can Say)" by Gaga. Not the best comparison because the songs don't sound similar at all but it hits the same place for me. I hesitate to compare it to Fergie's "Glamorous" because of the track names but that one does it for me too.

Did she make this with drag queens in mind? It sounds like a one-off single that RuPaul or one of her Drag Race bootlickers would release and Swearword or Belle would obsess over.

first this comes after the campy af intro love & glamour. and now is a song made to be injected by bottoms at the gay club dance floor, these kinds of songs on the album are why it's the cult classic it is today

It sounds like a bad Lady Gaga song. The bridge saves it from being completely terrible

This song sounds like it was made by a queen fifth out on drag race.

Xtina tried to say Gay Rights, but yall let the homophobia jump out….

---

the bouncy synths, the prechorus beat and the general feel of this song is amazing. Truly great from begining to end. Deserved my 11

These lyrics had me screaming...when she said "whence I'm tryna bounce" I cackled like why did she mix Shakespearan with 2010s slang. Also the office supplies metaphors WHO WROTE THIS. The production slapped though.

I really want to like this song because quirky, weird songs like this are usually my jam but this is not. good. It’s not even the subject matter that’s bad (in fact, that’s probably the most interesting part) it’s just that the lyrics are aggressively stupid and the song’s melody/instrumental are so annoying. And what is Christina doing with her voice? What a waste of M.I.A.

MIA vibes.

I'd buy this if it was a La Roux or a DEV song. Hell, I can't believe the voice I'm hearing is Christina's voice and not DEV's. I recognize that her voice gets routinely processed; she knows what she's doing on those songs. Christina doesn't.

MIA made this one so you know it's good

Do I ironically like this song because the lyrics are so dumb? Discuss

Popheads clearly wanted to tell Robyn what to do….

**Rosesmp3** This whole album is so full of classic songs that “Don’t Fucking Tell Me What to Do” always gets overlooked. One of my favorites.

**Ditacarlita** I can't imagine there being any song worse in this rate so it automatically gets a 0.

**Jexan13** repetitive but so relatable

**Waluigiest** She has songs like this (e.g. Beach 2k20) and they're all phenomenal. Mechanical club banger!!

**Qustomar** i think the lyrics r pretty good but musically the song is boring asf, there's no progression it just stays in the same spot

God this song is so bad like it's just awful I cannot truly express how much I dislike this song. This is a stain on an otherwise exceptional album

I love how weird and experimental this song is while still being listenable. Her droning voice over those robotic beats, it’s a neat effect.

My student loans are killing me. My depression is killing me. My closeted sexuality is killing me. My self destructive tendencies are killing me.

This song hits different.

i think the lyrics r pretty good but musically the song is boring asf, there's no progression it just stays in the same spot

Doesn't seem like much at first lyrically, but the repetition really pulls the whole song together. Just saying 'Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do' is the perfect thing after all that bullshit.

I was so disappointed to see this bop be out first day. Christina really tied to be a gay ally with this one and look what we did to her….

---

the exact midpoint of The Fame and Blackout

I'm no stranger to songs where the artist decides to bring another language into the fold to try and maybe spice the song up in some way. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and in this case hearing Christina sing in spanish just sounds awkward. It's a little catchy though I'll give it that.

ser bilingue es una bendición... excepto cuando Christina dice con un fuerte acento "me tienes tan mojada". Un bop trashy de principio a fin.

Me gustaaaaaaa

Too repetitive, needed the fat trimmed. Lyrics kind of cringe too. Doesn't deserve to be on the album as is.

A trumpet break AND a saxophone break??? She's spoiling us.

put me in the "get naked (i got a plan)" section

this is a cute bop for the gay club but not as interesting as the songs before it

...I feel so much second hand embarrassment as a spanish speaker

I hate everything about it

She sounds so uncomfortable singing in spanish, pls just sing inenglish if it makes u feel better

---

catchy af

this is formless in a really bad way. Like a terrible garageband nightmare. Happy that Marina could come and take this title and pretend this monstrosity never existed.

Now THIS is a song, many artists have tried to make a song like this and failed. Christina tears through this song like some sort of monster diva who’ll stomp all over you if you dare to get in her way; the “wall of noise” approach really works here. The ending of this song where Christina is just screaming “I’m a prima donna” is one of my favorite moments in the rate.

I was fully prepared to make some typical stan twitter comment like "Marina ended her" but this was actually really good

AND THERE'S THE LEAD SINGLE. One of the most Christina sounding songs on the album. Who the hell was responsible for releasing NMT over this as lead single? They should be shot.

Who is that man yelling.

Ok yeah girl power, bad bitch, drinking, going out with your gorls, blah blah blah

fadedblue09: I'm screaming at the fact we lost 12 songs and only 2 artists got hit.

Damn I feel bad for Xtina now. Good thing I didn't participate because as much as I love her, I have mixed feelings towards Bionic myself (sorry popheads, Liberation outsold).

Surprised Robyn lost some too. A case where popheads doesn't love it as much as Pitchfork does?

Finally Christina catches a break…. Right?

---

This doesn't sound like it was written by a professional musician. The awkwardly stretched out words, the basic cool/school/chance/dance rhymes, the even phrasing that lacks any rhythm, it's like if Kylie personally grabbed me off the street and asked me to write a song with her in 10 minutes.

a bop that feels a bit campy, somehow

Your Disco Needs You, but straighter. Somehow it still bops.

Ended shyness and not taking risks...also the bridge breakdown phew!

The tinny keyboard riff is really grating after like 10 seconds

The only one I don't care for, it's nothing special and sonically it doesn't really fit either

This is wildly out of place on the album so it shouldn’t surprise anyone to learn that it’s a leftover from the earliest iteration of the album before the executive producer was brought on and the album was retooled. It feels a bit cheaper and more “garage band” than the rest of the album, but I still find it pretty charming on its own merits. It makes me smile and at a certain point that’s all I’m asking for. It has one of my favorite Kylie videos too! The Murakami/Rocky Horror/pixel art shoutouts are so my speed and I love the bright tackiness of it/

JK Christina is now a dead horse yall won’t stop beating at this point

---

Someone explain to Christina the importance of track list order. Why wasn’t this on the front half of the album? Why is it closing the album? She did this song better with “Prima Donna” and “Woohoo,” this is just cringy and try hard.

vanity carried..

oh my god. The lyrics of this have some big d*ck energy, but c'mon, why close the album with this? Also, Blue Ivy who?

V is for... victory in the rate in a perfect world, I guess.

Glad this album ended on a strong note. A bad bitch anthem. Also that here comes the bride sample oh my god

"that bitch is so fuckin' pretty" Ok, I admit it, I still fucking love this song.

Where is the lie?

THAT INTRO IS MAKING ME SNICKER SO MUCH. Was Christina going through some sort of life crisis worrying that she wasn't a sex icon anymore? This has absolutely nothing on Lady Gaga's "Vanity", I'll say that much.

after all the snoozers the album is finally back to the campy electropop, but this doesn't reach the same heights as the songs at the start

This song is a CAMP BANGER. Out of all the songs on the album, Christina decided to put the voice of her infant child on THIS one about being a bad bitch. Not the one about vulnerability or about becoming a better person, but on the one where she's so turned on by looking in a mirror that she marries herself. Anyway this song and album were written exclusively for gay men, which is why Bionic flopped.

"i make myself so much wetter" wut is this trash luv? i probably should love it but it's too boring for me, just like half of this record

Production wise this song is definitely very different from the rest, but I loved how dark this song sounds an think it aged incredibly well.

---

**Agusarg** Röyksopp and Robyn always put out great stuff. Amazing production on this track

**V1llified** A Miss Songeniality contender. I will be shocked if taste gets shown and this reaches day 3.

**Jexan13** the ethereal drums truly broke the law. This song is something else

**Waluigiest** None of Dem: She coulda been a gay icon.....

**Qustomar** none of dem - the first half of this song is pretty one note but the second half really saves it

*RuPaul voice* Meh.

This song certainly has its ups and downs, not much more for me to say than that.

None of dis clicked for me like the rest of the album has so far

Kylie is getting out of Day 1 without some of the fat trimmed!

---

This song slaps hard, it’s perhaps the most conventionally “2010” sounding song on the album but wow it’s a banger. But um, am I mishearing something or did she say she’s going to St. Elsewhere? Does Kylie need [a hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere)? A [Gnarls Barkley album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere_(album))? What’s the story there girl?

The acoustic beginning is cute, too bad the somewhat formulaic beat in the chorus made this ineligible for a spot on the album.

THIS WAS SO GOOD WHY WASN'T IT ON THE STANDARD EDITION. The prechorus...Kylie truly couldn't have snapped any harder.

I just don't like acoustic guitar at all sorry. Also the "ay!" is so unnecessary.

this is the most trend-chasing of the songs on aphrodite, thank god it's just a bonus track

So sad to see this be the first Kelis song to be kicked… I think it is such a fun bop, but it could be seen as a bit repetitive.

If I time traveled to the Civil War I would definitely bring a speaker with this song for Lincoln to blast while he freed the slaves

the one kinda snoozer on this album

Underwhelming, thankfully it isn't on the main album.

Definitely near the bottom of my list on this album, but I still enjoyed it. I liked the fade out of the chorus at the end.

does she really think I won't notice her reusing Can't Get You Out of My Head?

pretty good bonus track, i think it's somewhat better than a lot of the good but not too interesting pop songs aphrodite is filled with, but u don't miss much if u don't listen to it

Sounds unfinished

I’m glad we included the bonus tracks for this album (I literally asked for their inclusion) because the other two are fantastic but this one… yikes. It’s cute but also it’s the worst song recorded for this album, it just feels lazy compared to everything else in the rate.

I found this song a bit punkish, but I agree it does not stay that adventurous.

**Jexan13** the "cause you know that love kills" melody line really feels odd. Idkw, I just dislike it a lot and this song suffers thanks to it.

**Qustomar** love kills - this song starts off in a really interesting place but just stays there, like i feel no journey or story listening to this song after the first 2 minutes

Meh
This song is about the AIDS epidemic and nothing will change my mind.

It’s good until it grows repetitive, it’s like she runs out of song at a certain point and just repeats herself.
