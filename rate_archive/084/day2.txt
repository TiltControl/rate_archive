Futuristic Flops Rate Reveal Day 2: Stuck in a Race in the Wrong Lane
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/exddr5/futuristic_flops_rate_reveal_day_2_stuck_in_a/

Welcome to the first day of the Futuristic Flops Rate starring Robyn, Christina Aguilera, Kelis and Kylie Minogue! For Day 2 we will be revealing the next 19 songs ( #33 - #15).
 
---
 
Here is some info about the rate!
 
**Number of Participants:** [44]( https://pastebin.com/R8mYmFfM) Beautiful, Talented, Hilarious, Genius People
 
**Average Score:** 7.525
 
**Please Read** Amount of Time spent manually typing up these posts + inserting everybody‚Äôs comments + scores + organizing everything because I decided to naively not use the usual rate program in favor of doing something ‚Äúleft lane‚Äù with good intentions to possibly increase participation over the course of the past 4 days: 19 hours
 
So as a result of the unexpected amount of time + mental stress this has taken on me after talking with our rate overlords to decide how we should move forward; we agreed on instead of pushing back the reveal I would keep the reveal as scheduled & just paste the comments without names because after trying I realized that part would have taken me several more hours. Sorry for not meeting your expectations and thank you for your understanding + participation <3 <3

Of course we start Day 2 with a Christina song‚Ä¶.

---

The album hits you right away with its ‚Äúin your face screaming robot‚Äù aesthetic and while this sound palate is very hit or miss, I think it works very well here. There‚Äôs a reason for the pounding, relentless energy and I like the lyrics/the character.

Being both the title track and the opening track, you would expect this song to in some way represent or encompass just how this album is going to sound or what it's going to be about, and I think it does that pretty well in that it has moments of genious and moments of egregiousness and for the most part isn't that special.

the prechorus saved this song

This was such a fun opener. I loved the production and just everything about it. I wish the last chorus hit harder than it did but other than that this was great.

I can't believe I used to like this. This should have been scrapped and replaced with Woohoo as the first song.

Oh, bitch?

this faux-reggae/EDM sound is very apparent in mid-late 2010s hit music. Maybe Christina made some points

honestly a rlly solid album opener, sets the stage for what's to come

Can't say I enjoyed it but I give it props for being completely different to what one would expect from her

This really could have and should have been an introlude

One of my least favorite songs off the album and can totally see why it was a bonus track, but popheads surprisingly liked it more then some of the normal album tracks!

**Jexan13** this feels so pure 

Close that album out with the same tired synths/beats girl, close it out.

Such a great album closer, I loved this. A feel-good bop. The "ITS WHAT WE ARE" part is gonna be stuck in my head for days I can already tell.

Scary how increasingly relevant this song became every year after its release with it climaxing in the 2016 election‚Ä¶. Kelis‚Äô mind

---

why is this better and more memorable than most of the actual album

How motherfucking dare you include that nonsense called Carefree American THIS IS A 9 TRACK ALBUM WITH SEGUES, NO ONE CARES ABOUT A FUCKING ITUNES BONUS TRACK.

You can totally hear the reasons why this was relegated to bonus track status.

Definitely not at the top of my list for this album but it for sure should have made the standard edition. It doesn't deserve to just be an iTunes bonus track!

so carefree she forgot to care about a memorable melody and about filming a respectful video about American Independence being declared.

as an anxious Canadian, I can't relate

I only liked the pre chorus of this song tbh‚Ä¶ the rest is a bit forgettable

---

One of the weaker tracks on the album, but not without its charms. I love how wonderfully cinematic it is with all the strings, and the bridge is lovely. I wish this had been the closing track.

i liked this song... then the bridge came... my god. MY GOD. WHAT WAS THAT I ASCENDED IM YOUR ANGEL KYLYE TAKE ME AWAY USE ME AS YOUR SLA-

A moment of serenity on a banger-stacked album, and what a majestic one!

Another bop, she really is snapping with this album isn't she :despair:

This song getting as far as it did and beating out better Bionic songs, let alone better Bionic ballads prove Pophead‚Äôs Single Bias imo

---

It‚Äôs beautiful but it doesn‚Äôt do it for me like the songs that preceded it. Although I‚Äôm an /r/popheads user I don‚Äôt hate ballads, but I must say that putting four of them in a row and saving this one for last wasn‚Äôt the smartest idea.

Christina's ballads are so hit and miss for me... but this is something else. Maybe because it's more "baroque", or I don't know, but this is the best Chris ballad and one of the best of the decade. The chorus just sends me to heaven.

Xtina's live performances of this should have earned her an Oscar nom for Best Actress.

The prechorus was so good. Also the vocals near the end phew

I can see why this was a single but the vocal olympics is a bit much for me.

ÔÅå

this sounds like a leftover song from Back to Basics and ironically that's why I love this one the most because it sounds like it still contains a shred of Christina's identity

Not strong enough to be a course correction when the album came out, and not strong enough to save the flaccid middle of this album

A serviceable song, but definitely not one of the stand outs. However it isn‚Äôt bad‚Ä¶ but I am not mad its gone now because it doesn‚Äôt reach the same heights as other euphoric dance+cry pop songs off the album.

---

**Jexan13** maybe i should make this a mantra

I feel like she was running out of ideas at this point because this sounds like four other songs on this album that were better.

Another bop. I wish the final chorus after the bridge exploded a bit more than it did though

A song that I have come to appreciate over time and the surprising chemistry between Robyn + Snoop has Martha Stewart shaking

---

**V1llified** A rare instance of me loving a Snoop feature on a pop song. He and Robyn work quite well together on this track, and I love the tongue-in-cheekiness shown here.

**Jexan13** The General Public is more powerful than the CIA, FBI and KGB, ugh their power

I‚Äôve listened to this album before and I can‚Äôt believe I glossed over this song! The grove is slick and I love the lyrics/flow of this one, and the production is some of the best on the album. It‚Äôs cool how we can hear her breaths in the song, I think it adds to the ‚Äúmadcap‚Äù vibe of the song.

Weird song, weird collaboration... but it works for me.

"We need a black pope and she better be a woman. There'll be no more celibacy. Even the Vatican knows not to fuck with me." When I tell you I my jaw DROPPED at these lyrics, Miss Robyn really snapped on this one. Snoop also went off and I usually hate him in features.

Robyn and Snoop call and response... oozes cool.

I didn‚Äôt find this song too memorable, it had potential but didn‚Äôt live up to it. Obviously *some* people felt very strong or meh about it.

---

I‚Äôm fully prepared for this song to be robbed but let it be known, any elimination short of Top 10 will be a ROBBERY. This song isn‚Äôt just the best song on the album, it‚Äôs not just Kylie‚Äôs best song, it‚Äôs quite possible one of the best pop songs EVER. This song is pure lightning, pure energy, pure magic. There have been a lot of love songs written throughout history about this kind of topic but very few of them reach the heights this song reaches and sound just so monumental. The song is constantly switching itself up and staying fresh until the very end, I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it so I‚Äôm just gonna list cool things about the song. The production slowly builds on itself during the first verse, starting with just Kylie‚Äôs voice then building to the chorus then completely switching it up for the second verse. The hammering synths that keep the song going contrasting with the sliding synths running over the top. The spacey synths on the second pre chorus that build into that falsetto note. The weird, glitchy production at the very end of the song. The bridge and outro where Kylie is trading lines with herself. It‚Äôs just brilliant production. The lyrics are smart as well, using unconventional language that‚Äôs very ear catching and neatly implying a character and a history with just a few times. And then Kylie is *crushing it* vocally the whole time. It‚Äôs just soooo good. It‚Äôs the flawless cherry on top of a virtually flawless album.

she could have said "f*ck f*ags" and it would be a smaller hate crime than beggining the song with that amazing beat... only to transition to something almost generic. It grew into me, but still!

Carly outsold (but this isn't bad)

The first verse is quite a letdown, but the song gets significantly better after it's over. The xylophone-ish synths before the beat drop are everything!

This reminded me a lot of Whip It by Nicki Minaj for some reason...a bop though, definitely one of the best tracks on the album

mmmm pop-y thank you

Surprised this song lasted as long as it did tbh‚Ä¶. But it‚Äôs a pleasant surprise <3

---

The production on this song is god tier and I love the writing but I think Kelis‚Äôs voice holds it back a bit. She‚Äôs not terrible or anything like that but her voice is so sleepy and earthy, I think someone with a lighter tone like a Solange would have brought it to a whole new level.

oh you made a song for me c:?

Cute but quite forgettable.

These lyrics were so cute omg it made me want to give birth right this second

Will revisit when I am a mom.

only weak one of the bunch, its kind of a lame way to close the album (in the standard edition)

A cute non offensive bop that really only Kylie could sing and not sound too cheesy. 

---

The lyrics of this song are killer! Like the language used is so interesting and poetic. Overall it‚Äôs a very elegant track, it‚Äôs probably the best at summing up both the regal/fantasy vibes of the album with the romantic dance music concept.

u haven't seen my life, have you? the audacity to claim it.

This is not it. It starts out very strong only to become a shell of a build-up to something great... that never arrives.

A cute bop, it made me so happy. What a wholesome song.

Is this the highest an intro song has ever rated on a popheads rate? If not, it deserves!

---

Hot tip, listen to this with headphones on because the synth work is crazy. I‚Äôm not crazy about outrun music in general and this reminds me a lot of that but it‚Äôs still a pop song so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.

the synthwave perfection that is the beat is just godly. It's so good that I almost get angry when I hear the vocals.

The xx ü§ù having iconic songs called Intro ü§ù Kelis

This was surpisingly fleshed out and long for an intro, I loved it. It slapped and the lyrics were great as well.

God, I love Kelis' voice.

By far the best song on the album. It sounds great and the main melody is amazing

Very Supernature but from the year 2500

Honestly deserved Day 3, a complete fucking bop and vocal serve!

---

I like the idea of this futuristic club more than the actual execution, it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs very repetitive.

That bassline at the end of the song is 10/10

This song really just doesn't go anywhere like it's just a flat line throughout. I really don't think people need to be welcomed to the 22nd century for 4 minutes straight if it's as plain as this song sounds.

repetitive but it's good

A tad repetitive but a banger nonetheless. The production in the outro was soooo good.

like a lot of the songs on this album, i think kelis' voice highly elevates them. a lot of these songs would be alright pop songs but kelis is a much more compelling singer than i thought she is from just milkshake

I don't think it needed to be that long. Also it's kinda weird how this album does transitions

The soundtrack of the singularity. Seriously, this sounds like it‚Äôs ripped right from *2001 A Space Odyssey* or something, I love how spacey and robotic this track sounds. The spiraling, nautilus shell instrumental is one of the most stunning things on the album.

This would go so much harder if it was produced like the songs on Flesh Tone

This song is certainly hypnotic

My god that beat is brutal and so energic it's almost creepy. ugh get closer to choke me. If I was a boss this would be my battle theme.

this sounds like Muse

For the second album in a row Kylie has the fourth track as the one with the weirdest... lyrical structure, I guess. It worked much better on Speakerphone, while here the verses sound lackluster and mildly repetitive. However, the chorus does elevate me closer to heaven.

This had so much potential but something just didn't click for me, especially with the chorus. I didn't like the elongated vocals with the fast beat, it just felt really off putting to me. I tried it again since I liked the rest of the album so much but nope, still annoying. I liked the verses a lot though.

wow i can't believe closer won

One or her most underrated tracks. It sounds amazing

One of the weaker Flesh Tone tracks imo, but enough of you liked it more then almost half the album!

It has potential but it ends up as noise.

"I ran out of money to film this music video" starterpack

nice production

Nothing stood out for me compared to the other tracks on the album but still a bop. I loved the production (I could say this about any of the songs tbh so I don't know why I keep commenting this)

"I was super cool but now I'm super strong." The dream.

the fact that she's willing to express vulnerability and raw emotion yet still maintain a club-ready tone is 10 worthy alone

Another one that just sounds dated. The synths are annoying and the hook is nothing special\

One of the my divisive songs in the rate goes out! 

---

This is certainly the highlight of the album for me. It kinda sounds ugly to me but in some weird masochistic way I enjoy it. I'm still not sure whether it was necessary for it to be 5 and a half minutes

I want to like this song because I love all of the candy references in it but it gets repetitive fast. Like I‚Äôm already bored by the time we get to Nicki and she can‚Äôt save the track by that point.

good but too long. Nicki's verse is amazing

the sims' influence!! This was Nicki Minaj's golden age but she can only do so much

Xtina and Nicki really got a whole game franchise to name performing sex after this song. Invented the Sims

Still the shit... where the fuck is the video? With a flop lead single, this was never going to go anwhere.

Before this rate I had only ever heard Nicki's verse in this song (thanks to a soundcloud compilation that was very formative for me) and wow!!! The intro had me leaning back in my chair looking at the ceiling to get ready. Nicki's verse is still amazing and damn the rest of the song delivers.

remember when @godneysbjs on Twitter went to a dance class taught by Britney Spears and he said they stretched to this song? The Glory era was truly something else

‚ÄúWoohoo‚Äù was like 5-10 years ahead of its time

xtina honestly the most innovative album on this list purely for having nicki (and sia) on it before all the other pop girls

she really made a 5:28 long song just to say "eat my pussy"

if THIS was chosen as the lead single, Bionic wouldn't have flopped, Christina may still be making bangers, and we wouldn't be on the brink of WWIII. Also, what an A+ queer ally Christina is for inventing a gender neutral name for a sex hole.

you know that there's a 3D option when you upload youtube videos, right Kelis

Enthralling, definitely a highlight for me

Enthralling, definitely a highlight for me

Scream got me into the fact that Kelis was more than Milkshake.

Definitely one of the album standouts. The chorus was so infectious, I had such an urge to just get up and dance.

A bop. If I had a workout playlist this would be the first song. I'm trying really hard to not talk about Kelis' body so just watch the video yourself.

i will never hear Scream and Shout the same knowing full well will.i.am paid Kelis dust for it but just repurposed it for Britney. If I see Kelis stans coming for Godney I will not retaliate.

MrSwearword: To whoever thought this was repurposed for Britney, no gurl. TULISA is who got fucked over. David Guetta is the one who took this song and basically made it some album track called Scream and Shout.

Also, this marks the highest Scream has ever performed in a rate it's been involved in.

Gaga remains unbothered because her illusion is perfect.

I disagree with people who say that this is filler, I think the strong lyrics and interesting themes in the song save it. Musically it is a bit weaker than the rest of the album, the chorus/hook just feel a little flat.

one of the highlights

The first Kylie song I fell in love with and probably the most overlooked deep cut on Aphrodite. The blissful intro, "that one ticking synth"‚Ñ¢ that makes the hook so captivating, the ethereal adlibs, the two belts near the end, the absolutely I C O N I C live performance during the Les Foiles tour... ~~Illusion. Convince yourself!~~

Shit, that chorus'll make your pussy throb right there (I hope someone out there knows what I'm referencing)

Honestly one of the worst Kylie songs off the album, very surprised it made it this far. But the Kylie stans really showed up this rate, that‚Äôs for sure!

---

I actually think this is the least memorable song on the album, the album so consistently rises to excellence but this is just generic (albeit good) dance music. I kinda get why they used it as the last track though, at least it makes it easier for me to skip.

It's a very good pop song, that in any other album would be a highlight, but in Aphrodite it's good

Is this Get Lucky?

WHAT A CLOSER (he-he). Kylie goes out with a bang and truly, nothing can't beat the feeling this album evokes in me ever since the first listen.

A cute bop and great album closer (well standard edition that is)

I think I would be annoyed if I heard this come on the radio. I'd be like, "really, this one again?" I think it's basic.

da 80s throwback of the album, so good, honestly the second half of the album is better than the first half barring kylie's always stellar singles

Sounds like Sonic Adventure Battle 2 Gamecube music

Honestly this leaving at #15 is a fair placement.

---

This is a pretty good song but it pales against some of the others on the album. It‚Äôs a bit pandering? Like, this is what Lorde was talking abut when she said she was tired of being told to put her hands up in the air, Kylie repeats that so many times over the course of the song it loses all meaning by the end. However the song is saved by a solid hook and some interesting production towards the end.

a bit bland, compared to the other songs here

‚úã

Always wanted to be one of those people in the room that says something and everyone puts their hand up. Like, "If you feel love tonight put your hand up. If you're gonna take this moment put your hand up."

nice but kind of a snoozer. I like the bridge though extra points for that.

This songs like a fake pop song from a movie

And with that Christina could not even make it to Day 3. I loved this song a fetus ‚Äì gay, and I think it holds up as a fun club bop to this day. It‚Äôs a shame it got soooooooooo much hate upon release that it completely derailed the entire era. 

---

It‚Äôs bad when the best part of a song is [the Kidz Bop version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Zh3sQYhIg&frags=pl%2Cwn) It‚Äôs not unlistenable but god is it boring and (I use this word sparingly) generic.

This is objectively not very good but the extreme "sheltered gay kid going to his first club" energy is something I vibe with hard

It's sad that this was compared to Lady Gaga when this is better than a lot of her music (and I'm saying this as a Gaga fan).

This was a cute bop but xtina really thought she did sum with that weird vocal skipping at the end of the bridge :yikes:

There's elements for a great song here, sadly it doesn't hit where it should. Not lead single material!

Holy shit this is powerful and sexy.

in retrospect‚Ä¶ this song is very microcosmic of Bionic as a whole; Christina sounds like she's trying way too hard to be everyone BUT herself on this album, and this is one of the primary reasons why I'm very offput by it and by her

this is a mega fucking bop i'm sorry, it's cheesy but no one except xtina would make this song, it has the tinaprint

this sounds like it could be on The Fame. And I love it.

It's really not bad if you think of it as camp

would have been better with different instruments

JunkyGS: **BIONIC AVERAGE 6.82**
---

---

* This album, at the time, felt like a massive betrayal. Christina intended Bionic to be a tribute to and a collaboration with female-fronted indie synthpop acts from the 2000s, like Peaches, Le Tigre, Sia, M.I.A, Goldfrapp and Ladytron. These happened to be all my favorite bands in 2010. As a queer guy who didn't know anyone with the same taste in music, seeing Christina publicly stan Ladytron so hard was incredibly validating. Then the actual album came out, and it turned out that Bionic was actually a tribute to Lady Gaga. RCA had gutted it. I was pissed. I will never not be pissed. I will die mad. In fairness, it's better than I remembered. The first four tracks mostly deliver on what she promised, Not Myself Tonight is trashy but fun and the back half has a solid run of ballads that, while having nothing to do with the album concept, are well sung and emotionally affecting. But I don't think I'll ever be able to hear this album objectively.
* Prior to listening to this album, I was expecting to either absolutely hate it or find it to be an underrated gem and after listening to it I think it's... neither. I was thorougly whelmed listening to this album. The feeling I got most often while listening was probably that of "how did that last song go again?" because I found most of them forgettable.

* There's a reason why this is called Biconic. No other Christina's album come close to this one; a spotless production, great songs all around and a... unique tracklist. This album has the best ballads of her carrer, don't @ me. It's too bad that Birds Of Prey was not included; it truly deserved the 11.

* can you believe this shitshow came from the same woman who released dirrty?

* DEAR GOD THIS ALBUM SUCKS. Sorry, let me be specific. The opening of this album is actively unpleasant bullshit, the middle has ballads that could've made Back to Basics and then the end has the same actively gross and poorly made noise that has this album result in something so goddamn awful and ridden with sound clash.

* Why would anyone... hate this?

* Bionic came out when i was 19.. as a stan until then, I was SO excited. I bought the fan vinyl box set when it flopped and they were selling them really cheap on her online store (which I just sold on ebay actually lol). Woohoo is still my fucking JAM and it introduced me to Nicki Minaj's music before anyone in Australia had even heard of her. I liked Bionic WAY more then than I do now, that's for sure. I can see why this album is kind of annoying. There's a few songs that are too bizarre and repetitive and there are too many ballads in a row. There is definitely an album worthy of standing next to Stripped and Back to Basics here. With a bit more tweaking and some cut tracks this would be solid. She really tried to make a piece of art and try something different here, as you can see by the producers and writers she worked with. I don't know if she chose them or her label introduced her but writing with Sia and collaborating with Nicki, she was ahead of her time. The label and her really fucked up the release of this album with their choices of singles and bad track list order/too many songs. A shame the lead single wasn't Prima Donna. Perez and co were trashing Christina all over the internet because of his friendship with LG... I remember it vividly. It was so mean and uncalled for.

* First time hearing this album I think it changed me. The songs were. Amazing. Incredible. Sexy. Cool. Glamorous. Stimulating. Bewitching. Gonna be playing this for a long time.

* Bionic is an intriguing album, which is better than being a boring one at least. I considered myself a fan of it but revisiting it for this rate I'd hesitate to say that because the album is very flawed. I admire what she was trying to do with this album by creating an era that was bold, futuristic, and sexy, but she had way too many ideas and needed to be guided more to create a solid project. The album in general lacks cohesion, partially because the production is all over the place but also because some of the songs are just blatantly better than others. There's a stretch in the middle of the album from "Prima Donna" to "You Lost Me" which is just fantastic and some of her best work, but it's surrounded by some terrible songs, and although we aren't rating them the deluxe tracks are a further mixed bag. In terms of just like, solid pop songs, I think this album has a lot to offer, but as an actual album it's a confused mess. We should have rated the *Burlesque* soundtrack.

* I'm playing the Deluxe Edition and whilst it could've done without Monday Morning, Birds of Prey is GORGEOUS! It doesn't even sound like Christina; I'm amazed. Sadly, most of my other amazement comes in the form of, well, how much Christina often doesn't sound like herself. Going through this album, I couldn't help but wonder if she was experiencing an identity crisis, a midlife crisis, or some damning hybrid of the two. I stopped caring for Christina when I became a teenager and her insistence on this album's genius makes me feel justified in doing so, which really saddens me as someone who has fond memories of watching her videos over and over as a kid

* I'll admit that I am very biased as a lifelong Xtina stan. Bionic is admittedly not a well-structured album (who decided to go from Sex for Breakfast to Lift Me Up???) and a couple songs like "I Hate Boys" and "Vanity" could have been MySpace vanity project songs from circa 2007, but I still think it's a fun, sexy, and sometimes even meaningful album. Far from her best, but memorable. I wish deluxe tracks like "Birds of Prey" and "Monday Morning" had been included in this rate (I would have given my 11 to one of them), so check them out if you haven't listened to them before.

* one issue i have is there are way too many songs holy shit, 18 songs on the regular tracklist, 23 on the deluxe. there is no reason for this album to be this long. also there are a lot of ballads and i feel like you should either go full on with the future electro concept or full on with the snoozer ballads, i like when an album has a fully-done and consistent concept. otherwise i think it's a good, campy, gay album, i prefer it to both the fame and born this way by gaga to shut down those comparisons! just xtina needed to EDIT herself in this case like take some songs out we did not need this much bionic! i even liked a few of the ballads and i can usually be balladphobic, but idk if we needed this many still!

* It's a mixed bag. Some tracks I hated, some tracks I loved. Honestly I enjoyed the traditional songs much more than the futuristic ones. She really shines with ballads, and the ones on this record are great

* There are so many GREAT songs on this album. As much as we joke about this being too ahead of its time for some people, I think Christina Aguilea blurred the lines between pop and alternative genres before the total breakdown of genre with the rise of streaming. This album is best when it's Christina singing about her vagina over electro beeps and boops. What really drags this album down though, is the oversaturation of downtempo songs on its second half, and the few up-tempo songs that aren't quite camp enough to be good.

* After wanting an excuse to listen to this album for a while, being intrigued by its electro sound and sci-fi aesthetics, I'm glad I finally did, even if I didn't end up loving it. It's way different from her earlier work, of which I was never a huge fan, and I would listen to it again. There isn't much that's new here though - the songwriting isn't amazing and the production is extremely 2010, to the point where I felt like I was listening to some long-lost outtake from *The Fame Monster*. (Not always a bad thing, though.) The very campy ("Glam", especially) and somewhat raunchy lyrics ("Desnudate" follows in a long tradition of dumb and fun "let's get naked" electropop songs) made me appreciate the impact of Peaches, who shows up on one track. (Millennial Popheads might know who she is, the younger ones won't). The feminist themes add much-needed depth as well, even if she does go off-message from "girl power" on the embarrassingly bad "I Hate Boys". The most surprising thing here is the ballad-filled second half. This is very much an album I have to be in the mood to enjoy, but it would kill on a dancefloor in 2010. Overall rating: 5.9.

* This album has good toplines and lyrics. I would have been better if it didn't lean *so* hard into the techno/Bionic theme. With a different instrumentation (and without having to wait half a minute for the song to actually begin) this may have faired better?

* this is the first time ive ever listened to this album and wow its a mess... and way too long... contrary to the other albums in this rate i totally get why this flopped hard lol woohoo bangs tho
