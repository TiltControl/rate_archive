Futuristic Flops Rate Reveal Day 3: "Experimental Record(s) That Will Surpass Time"
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/exta0c/futuristic_flops_rate_reveal_day_3_experimental/

Welcome to the first day of the Futuristic Flops Rate starring Robyn, Christina Aguilera, Kelis and Kylie Minogue! 

For Day 3 we will be revealing the next 14 songs ( #14-#1).

Here is some info about the rate!
 
**Number of Participants:** 

[44]( https://pastebin.com/R8mYmFfM) Beautiful, Talented, Hilarious, Genius People
 
**Average Score:** 

7.525
 
**Please Read:** 

Amount of Time spent manually typing up these posts + inserting everybody’s comments + scores + organizing everything because I decided to naively not use the usual rate program in favor of doing something “left lane” with good intentions to possibly increase participation over the course of the past 5 days: 22.5 hours
 
So as a result of the unexpected amount of time + mental stress this has taken on me after talking with our rate overlords to decide how we should move forward; we agreed on instead of pushing back the reveal I would keep the reveal as scheduled & just paste the comments without names because after trying I realized that part would have taken me several more hours. Sorry for not meeting your expectations and thank you for your understanding + participation <3 <3

Start off Day 3 with a Kylie song that shouldn’t be here imo! I think the production on the chorus is really weak and isn’t the pay off it should be, but the vocal is cute!

---

I’m a bit biased towards this song because it reminds me of a boy I used to date but it does kind of signal a dip in quality on the album. I can’t pinpoint anything exactly wrong with this song (I’m not a fan of the slightly trashy production but I also don’t hate it) but it just doesn’t hit like everything before it did. Still good though!

Love the guitar on this, one of the most interesting and unique tracks here

~~You think I'm pretty without any makeup on.~~ Why do I always mistake the first few seconds of this for Teenage Dream and vice versa? The lyrics in the chorus flow somewhat clunky, but that doesn't drag the song down much.

my second choice for my 11, but it still fucking slaps

technically Cupid is the son of Aphrodite, so that makes this an incestuous mega BOP

Am I crazy or did the beginning seconds of this sound exactly like Since U Been Gone

Points for the bass.

i don't think this is actually a 6 in the grand scheme of things it's just this album's been of such immense quality thus far that it feels like a step down

One of my favorites from the album! It is so boppy, simple and has a really good groove to it with the HEYs. Also lyrically she is spilling and the chorus pays off big time.

---

**Jexan13** i feel it needs an extra umph

I’ve heard hype around this song and while it’s fun/relatable, I don’t think it’s in the top tier of the album. The chorus clearly outdoes the verses and like a lot of Robyn’s songs it grows repetitive.

Another bop. This would've been a 10, except I could have done without the "heys" throughout the verses, they were a tad annoying/distracting.

The delorean lyric bothers me

THIS IS THE KIND OF TURN-OF-THE-DECADE EDM I NEED, HOW HAVE I SLEPT ON ROBYN THIS WHOLE TIME TF

The little bonus track that could! It is easy to see why it is a kylie stan deep cut fave!

---

Wow what an iconic song, and how iconic that I bullied Junky into including it in the rate. The low-key chorus with that synth in the background is perhaps the most “cool” I’ve heard Kylie sound. Plus the lyrics are really cool and uplifting.

The best bonus track

This song Styx with me for long periods of time whenever I ~~illegally~~ listen to it.

i'm crying too with this ethereal aquatic bop

wtf how is this just a bonus track and not on the regular tracklist and a single. one of kylie's best pop/dance songs ??? a masterpiece ???

I loved this one, definitely deserved to be on the standard edition. The lyrics were great too, I liked the water imagery a lot.

Delicious! Finally some good fucking bass.

Honestly surprised this song made it as far as it did. I don’t consider it amongst the best the album has to offer, but Popheads clearly felt differently! 

---

**Agusarg** Amazing beggining to the album and it absolutely slaps

**V1llified** Unlike Xtina and Mykki Blanco, she's ironic, not Bionic.

**Qustomar** i can't say this song is bad but nothing about it makes me interested while listening

I love this song so much, it’s actually my most listened to song on the album. It’s so strange and campy but it’s undeniably infectious, I can’t give it a 10 because it’s got some flaws (some of the lyrics are clunky) but y’all better do right by this one.

hope you don't self destruct

A great opening to the album. I loved the second verse especially. Overall a very catchy, infectious song, though it probably won't be at the top of my list.

Girl was right when she did this one.

Simply put, it's a bop.

Ughhh so glad this broke the 8 average, because for a while it did not. It so deserves and is a clear highlight!

---

A fun ride with a weird ending.

Pretty catchy overall

Definitely my favorite track on the album. That hook is transcendental.

the chorus production is 11 worthy. Sadly the afterchorus is 5 worthy

"Who can you trust when you can’t trust yourself"....ouch Kelis didn't have to attack me like that. Overall, the production felt a bit dated compared to the other songs, very early 2010s David Guetta and the weakest on the album for me. Still a bop though.

Bumped up two points for that dope outro.

If Nina Sky ever catches wind of this song sis had better hope those Milkshake royalties still pay well because GODNEY DAMN, does that chorus melody sound like Move Ya Body

This honestly deserved a bit better then it got. A top 10 is nothing to scuff off, but there are some tracks left I think it is much better then. 

---

The Italo house piano on this track is prime and saves it from being otherwise unremarkable.

hope you don't self destruct

4th of July (Fireworks) is one of the best songs in the history of recorded music.

Some really solid dance pop. Love the keyboards on the track

4th of july SNAPPED

This was phenomenal wow. This is definitely one of my favorite songs in the entire rate.

I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to Kaytranada's song "Freefall" from an album that also featured Pharrell, close and personal friend to Kelis. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!

There are certainly elements of this song that I like, but my main issue with it is that I don't think it had to be 5 and a half minutes. There gets to be a point where I'm just waiting for the song to get on with it already.

This song is GREAT. The cultural appropriation in the music video 1) is simply unacceptable and 2) are inexcusable in the context of Independence Day. That was the day when white colonizer men declared the United States their land, independent of other countries, doing everything they could to drive out First Nations settlers, which makes that headdress even more insensitive and tone-deaf. Fuck this, I'm dropping it to a 5.

A cute fast paced bop that placed much higher then I anticipated

---

**Jexan13** everything is so nice

**Qustomar** hang with me - kinda superior to dancing on my own but that's all i'm gonna say about that

Kinda boring in my opinion

The chorus of this song was so catchy; it's probably one of my favorite hooks on the album so far. The verses could have been better and dragged it down a little bit but it was still a cute bop overall.

It’s good but like, kind of boring compared to some of the other songs on the album? Like, the synth work/melody/lyrics feel very by-the-numbers, the spark of inspiration isn’t here as much.

One of the best choruses on the album and overall super cute song and anthemic! 

---

**Jexan13** the chorus is pop perfection. Also, this song makes me so sad. I mean, that "I let the bad ones in and the good ones go" line is delivered with so much regret

**Qustomar** indestructible - it's a cute pop bop, something for the radio

The more optimistic little sister of “Dancing On My Own” and the second best song on the album.

I loved this so much! The instrumentals before the final prechorus/chorus were euphoric. I loved the line "a freeze-frame of your eye in the strobelight".

This song is good, I wish it had another verse or something that mixed it up.

There are things I like about this song but the chorus I just don't like that much I think I find it boring maybe? I can't really describe why but it's certainly not my favorite that's for sure.

And the title track is gone! Definitely one of the grandest sounding songs in the rate, but still a thumping bop.

---

I feel like I keep giving out 10s but goddess Kylie demands them! This is probably one of the best “boast” songs I’ve ever heard because Kylie ls like, ACTUALLY the queen of dance music so she’s totally earned the right to murder this song like she does.

It's just so fun, catchy and it sounds great. Everything that makes this album so good
amazing chorus with what I think is one of the best hooks on the rate... but it's not enough. The rest of the song feels a bit bland and doesn't show the same quality as the highs in the album

Yes Kylie, for the millionth time, I can feel you on my stereo

I do enjoy this one

Gaga did it better but Godney bless Kylie for giving it a damn good try

An honorable Top 5 finish for Miss Kelis. This song is such a bop that sounded current at the time, but really aged well and has so many unique quirks to it, that allows it to avoid the pitfall of sounding dated. 

---
Imo this is Kelis’s only shot at winning the rate but wow, what a song. There’s a lot of really great production on this album that doesn’t quite reach its full potential, and this song shows how powerful Kelis could be when she did. That metallic sounding beat that just hammers throughout the song is perfect and Kelis’s unique voice fits into the sonics very well. I love the melody and the lyrics too, they’re simple but the simplicity really works with everything going on around it. Possibly the best bridge in the rate.

I love the beat but the second part of the chorus... my God. I have no words.

masterful. The floating melody rhythm not quite syncing with the beat.... this is glitzy and wonderful

That build from the bridge to the chorus was so good...the final chorus definitely could've gone harder but I still love what we got

Literally every comment I make on this album will be about Kelis' voice but I just think it's so beautiful. Really shines on this song. Also the video is beautiful and she is breathtaking.

This was such an easy choice for an 11. It's one of the most euphoric and heartwarming declarations of love ever committed to song, and just knowing that it's about maternal love rather than romantic gives it an extra edge because it's something we don't get to hear too often. The bridge in particular is transcendent; her lyricism overall is super underrated but it might just be my favorite passage she's ever written.

JunkyGS: **FLESH TONE AVERAGE 7.79**
---

---

* "Kids" should have been on the album. I don't care that it's just Song For The Baby 2.

* This is the album I probably have the least thoughts on. Part of the probably has to do with the fact that it's the shortest so didn't really over stay its welcome to the point where I was consciously awaiting its end like with other albums I've listened to. This album definitely has its own very unique sounds and style, however I can't really that it's something I completely agree with. It's seems to be very hit or miss with me.

* I really didn't know what to expect from this one. Like most of the people on this rate, I didn't have an idea of who was Kelis, and I DEFINITIVELY didn't know that she had this collection of bops. This one is the most EDM/Trance (?) album, and it ain't bad. My only criticism is that I felt some songs were too repetitive.

* A fine project! With the segues it flows together into a fun, electropop record. Most of the songs are good but not especially memorable, and in hindsight it's an album full of dated but "futuristic" sounds.

* Easily one of the most cohesive and fantastic projects ever to be released. At the front of the EDM boom of 2009-2015, it's a shame this flopped. I would like to point out come album scores, this is actually a 9.3 and tied with ARTPOP as my highest scoring album. Because the host fucking insisted that goddamn Carefree American be tacked on, it dropped it to 8.9.

* The album I discovered most recently of the four records, and the quality of which left me delighted to the fullest extent. Definitely deserved bigger recognition at its release.

* First time listening to this album. It was okay, better than Body Talk on my ears. Nothing outstanding and it was all a bit too repetitive and boring. Wouldn't listen again.

* Always been a die-hard Kelis fan. I love her voice and style so much, Flesh Tone is a joy to listen to.

* While I love that Kelis was included in this rate I'm fully anticipating her slaughter and wouldn't be surprised if she missed out on the Top 10 entirely. This album has the opposite problem that *Bionic* has: her vision is too focused so the album is too cohesive to the point of the individual tracks being unmemorable. I really vibe with this album while I'm listening to it but I couldn't tell you what many of the songs sound like even after listening to it several times. It's a bold piece of work, I always love some Afro-futurism, and the production is incredible, but it lacks the pop sensibility to survive in a rate like this.

* I very much sense that Kelis is trying to recreate Confessions On a Dance Floor, and it's largely working in her favor, but I think it's better that this didn't sell too great because more people would catch wind of 4th of July which, to my knowledge, Kelis hasn't owned up to yet.

* I wish I liked this more but only a few songs standout to me. I think the writing is pretty good though.

* it's rlly sad that this was the biggest flop of all the albums on the list because it's literally the best one, this is not just gay electropop bops but also innovation is going on! it's hard to comment on a single song because they all come together to tell a cohesive story

* There are some songs I can appreciate, but overall I don't think the sound really holds up. The songwriting is also very inconsistent, some songs have some great hooks while others are pretty cuestionable. Overall I can't say I truly enjoyed it

* This album was the biggest surprise in the rate - after kind of writing off Kelis as an uninteresting R&B artist ("Milkshake" is genuinely a brilliant song though, not just a meme) she then delivered this artsy, electronic, avant-garde album which I ended up loving. She really has talent as a songwriter, as well as a unique warm voice. The production is excellent, and the lyrics are ambitious, covering everything from love ("4th of July"), motherhood ("Brave", "Song for the Baby", loneliness ("Acapella"), anxiety and insecurities ("Scream") and even sci-fi themes ("22nd Century") - the work of Janelle Monae is a fair comparison. I was very impressed by this album and will no doubt be going back to it again. Overall rating: 7.4

* underrated AF. Kelis was really ahead of her time with this, if it had been released a few years later when EDM exploded I am sure it would have gotten a ton of recognition. A near perfect dance-pop album

The queen to the king jewel that is Dancing on my Own. 

---

**MrSwearword** One of the only exceptional tracks on this album.

**Rotating3DText** this song makes me SO SAD for the girlfriend but it also makes me wanna DANCE

** Static_Int_Husp ** Call Your Girlfriend - This song and Dancing On My Own are 1A and 1B on this album, and may both deserve 11s in their own rights. However, the version of Dancing On My Own on the playlist is the one from Body Talk Part One and not the one marked "Radio Edit". The instrumental is completely revamped between the two, and the latter is obviously superior. If that was the version, it would be really tough to pick my 11. However, it wasn't, so Call Your Girlfriend gets it.

**Jexan13** tag yourself i'm the dumped gf

**Waluigiest** Call Your Girlfriend: Luscious, Dancing On My Own's talented younger sister.

Gays, he’s not gonna leave his girlfriend for you. The song is nice though!

This and Dancing On My Own were the two songs I had heard a ton from this album before doing this rate, so I already knew this was getting a 10 going in. An excellent dance tune that's heightened by its strong lyrical content.

It's kind of funny to imagine her walking up to some random guy at a bar and telling him this. With the confidence in this song though I think she could pull it off.

Love this song. Love the melancholic melody paired with Robyn singing from the "other girls'" perspective... or is she?

I do believe that this song is very good but there's a small part of me that finds the song kind of condescending, I guess? It's really hard to put into words and it kinda doesn't make any sense because I understand what the song is trying to do but like there's just a tiny part of me that finds the lyrics patronizing towards the girl that the guy is breaking up with like with lines like "the only way her heart will mend is when she learns to love again and it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend" like I get it's trying to be nice but to me it's just cliche in a bad way. I don't know this probably sounds stupid so just ignore this. I still think the song is good anyways.

The music video that invented gay rights! An absolute staple in a discography full of gems.

---

Musically this is a lot like “I Believe In You,” which I enjoy more, but she switched it up thematically and the results are great. I love the lyrical content of this song, it’s so sweet. Imagine believing in the hope of love in the future… but like really, imagine.

I remember seeing a few "unapologetically homoerotic music videos" threads back when I first joined the subreddit more than a year ago. I do **not** remember the All The Lovers MV being mentioned there at all. It takes skill to make an orgy with over a hundred participants look artful and the video creators didn't lack it. Oh, and the song is a masterpiece too.

that synth breakdown in the bridge is heavenly. That, combined with the amazing chorus and verses... A no brainer 11, the best song in an album full of amazing songs

it's a rlly good album opener and cute song but i saw ppl consider giving it an 11 and ??? kylie has so many singles in her discog i would give an 11 and all the lovers is NOT one of them lmao

Pop perfection!!! Such a great openers...I loved the chorus and the instrumental so much

Very beautiful to me and just very pleasing

One of the biggest bops in Kylie’s discography and that is saying something. Also what some consider the last mainstream hit she had. It is euphoric, beautifully infuses disco + edm influences and has a catchy thumping beat.  

---

Hot take but while this song is a mega bop, it shouldn’t have been a single. It clicked for me when played it for a friend and she got really confused by it but this song is kind of unusual, isn’t it? Maybe it’s just my own inexperience but when I think about it, even at the height of maximalist pop it didn’t quite sound like this. The house beat, the wash of cool synths, the unabashed theatricality, Kylie’s voice, it’s all a bit too much for most situations. Like, there’s so much raw power in this song that you can’t just play it on the radio. The stars have to align for a song like this to reach its peak potential, and when that moment hits and you strut like an untouchable goddess to this track, damn, that’s pop at its best.

Get Outta My Way is the truly exceptional track on this album.

Get Outta My Way: The song? gay. The mv? gay. Everything about this is gay. Can't spell Get Outta My Way without gay! Giving this a score below 9 is a hate crime.

Automatic 10.. no wait this stole 11 from Prima Donna!

love the energy and hate in this song

There was no doubt in my mind that this would be my 11. This is the song that made me go from a casual fan of Kylie to a full-fledged stan. Pop perfection!

This was so infectious!! She is a server your honor, she does nothing but serve.


An absolute beast of a song. It has the energy, it has the lyrics, it has the moves, it has the melody. This song came so so so so close to getting my 11 because of how incredibly infectious and good it is. Love this song.

so good, almost made it my 11. Definitely should've been the lead.

I know I'm boring but this song sure as hell isn't!

JunkyGS: # APHRODITE AVERAGE 7.87

---

* I feel like I keep cutting Kylie a lot of slack because of how inherently queer her music is. I don't know how it is in the UK, but in the US almost all of her fans are gay men. I feel solidarity with the wider gay community when I hear her music, even when her material is not that great.

* As the album as a whole IT SLAPPED. I wonder why it flopped like why you do my girl Kylie wrong like that..

* Upon first listening to this album, I didn't really think anything special about it. But for some 
reason, after listening to it for a second, something suddenly clicked and I realized that I really enjoyed nearly every single song on this album. I don't know if it's simply because I was in a good mood or it scratched some kind of itch I had, but this album for me blew all other 3 albums out of the water.

* This album almost pains me. It had the potential to soar into my top 15 all time; the highs are just incredible. Her voice is so cute and everything is so catchy and wholesome, the production is phenomenal and the aesthetic is very nice... but some not-stellar tracks bring this down.

* in kylie's version of the future, society is powered by the magical force known as queer love. literally one of my top 5 albums of all time.

* Best album out of the bunch

* The album is what I consider mostly solid. Get the energy up and she shines. Have her do pert near mawkish or anodyne balladry or slow songs, I will read her. Aside from that, a very very cute album.

* Looking past the elephant in the room (the totally not inflated scores), this album is fantastic and serves as an excellent starting point for diving into Kylie's discography, albeit indisputably safe in terms of its sound. If you haven't seen the Aphrodite: Les Foiles Tour yet, PLEASE WATCH IT. It's a one-of-a-kind experience, which shouldn't at all come as a surprise, given that it's based on Greek mythology, one of the gayest aesthetics imaginable!

* Was looking forward to listening to this album as I absolutely love Kylie's singles/greatest hits. It was a great album to listen to, she rarely disappoints! I'll probably revist this at some stage and add a few of the songs to my already huge Kylie playlist.

* Kylie's best album, the best album in the rate, and among the best albums of the 2010s. I am not entertaining arguments at this time. The back half drags a little but but this is one of the few albums I'd consider to be "filler free," every single song is sonically/thematically diverse and serves a purpose in the overall structure of the album. Kylie has always been the queen of dance music but this is her at her most regal, proving that sophisticated music with intelligent writing still has a place on the dance floor. The biggest negative I have about this album is that she looks like a perfume bottle on the cover.

* I can't believe Kylie gave us this in 2010 only to spend all those years preparing what would turn out to be Golden. Please let KM16 or whatever the hell number her next studio album is be at least as good as this

* Not one of my favorite Kylie albums, but I get why it's well-liked since it's breezy, positive, and uplifting with several certified bops.

* i think kylie is not appreciated enough for having such a high quality run of diverse pop albums from KM1994 to aphrodite. each album serves rlly good pop music and all are worth listening to for any pop music fan. aphrodite is kind of the modern retelling of her albums like fever, and i think it's pretty good but of that string of albums it is lowkey my lesser faves. kylie knows exactly which producers and songwriters work for her, but then aphrodite ends up being a little too much of a safe pop record for me. there are a lot of songs which r amazing pop perfection! but there aren't more experimental moments like a confide in me, or really just KM1994, IP, and X in general. not even little nuggets of just completely bonkers camp like a coocachoo from light years. this is sorta pop music in its purest form which is alright, but i like when there is a little more going on. i think kylie is at her best when she mixes her ear for perfect pop music with some risk-taking. but to be my new kylie stan self, aphrodite is what teenage dream thought she was. aphrodite is the mother of emotion by carly, THERE, i said it!

* By far the most consistent album of the rate. Though some tracks are not as good as the highlights, none of them are straight up bad. Overall it's just a blast to listen to

* I've only heard two Kylie albums before this rate (*Fever* and *X*, which we rated a while back) and loved both, so I was sure I would enjoy this one too, and I was right. She had a string of great dance-pop albums in the 2000s ending with this one in 2010, and every song on it is fun and unpretentious, pure ear candy. The lyrics maybe lack depth, but the joyous mood makes up for that - this is definitely an album I'd put on to cheer myself up on a bad day, and sometimes we all need that. It's very much a classic electro and dance album - I can draw some comparisons with *Artpop* (including the Venus/Aphrodite concept) and the Spice Girls, and like with *Flesh Tone*, I also heard some interesting throwbacks to Y2K pop, a microgenre that I remember fondly from being a kid and is making a bit of a comeback these days in the form of hyperpop. She even shows us how to not make a ballad boring with the earworm "Everything is Beautiful". If there is a flaw, it's that the album is rather samey, but that also means it's cohesive. One last note: the cover is fittingly, beautiful, with her indigo dress. It's too bad Kylie is not more popular in North America, because she can really deliver with solid electronic pop songs. I might even stan. Overall rating: 7.1

* A very cute and fun album

* I still maintain that CRJ is the modern day Kylie. If you love Emotion and Dedicated LISTEN TO KYLIE MINOGUE!

* one of kylie's best eras, I was lucky enough to see this tour live and it was incredible... she is a true legend and releasing music this good that late in her career is really amazing.

To nobody’s surprise despite Kylie’s valiant effort. This is one of the best songs of the decade and it is easy to see why. The song that invented crying in the club and was timeless enough to keep reintroducing itself to new generations of gays through the power of word of mouth and critical acclaim (such as song of the decade!). Also thanks to a cover that squeezed it dry of anything queer or personality…

---

**MrSwearword** One of the only exceptional tracks on this album.

**J_Toe** Callum Scott has the better version of Dancing on my Own and I don't even listen to *that*.

**V1llified** The second of the two redeeming moments of RPDR All Stars 1. :kim:

**Rotating3DText** I mean, out of all the "dancing while crying" songs, this is the most relatable to me. Album version for life.

**Jexan13** this is going to win, isn't it? I mean, it's not even the best song on the album, but i can't deny how catchy and sad this is. It's a whole mood.

**Waluigiest** Dancing On My Own: this is essentially a perfect pop song. The writing, the melodies, the pulsing beat, the universality..... I don't see how anyone could dislike this song.

**Qustomar** dancing on my own - the pop classic itself, yeah there's no criticism here except the album version >>> radio version

**MaterialQirl** rated dancing on my own 11 because period period PERIOD!!!!!

Gonna be SHOCKED if this doesn’t win. It’s kind of a basic choice but nonetheless a correct one, the song has kind of been played out at this point but that’s just because it really is that good.

I can't imagine anyone giving this anything less than a 10, and I will be shocked if this doesn't win the entire rate (I think most of us would be). Easily one of the best songs of the decade, the century even. This song has the power to transport you to the dancefloor, while still having raw and relatable lyrical content. Truly invented sad bopping.

Song of the decade for a reason. Fantastic production, hard-hitting lyrics. Robyn's delivery fills the song with enough anger, sadness, and pain to move me every time. (Also, quick plug for the Kings of Leon version which should take over as the main cover over the other one I shall not name. It warms my gay heart to see a guy keep the pronouns!)

I'm gonna pretend this isn't the radio edit

Just a total classic.

Pretty much the only song that would ever get my 11, with the exception of Get Outta My Way which came pretty close. Ultimately though this song gets my 11 simply because it is that bitch. There really is no other song that sounds quite like this one, that feels quite like this one, and that is as good as this one. There's a reason this song topped so many decade-end charts.

I wish I liked this song more than I did. Maybe it's the production, maybe it's that Robyn doesn't sound as impassioned as she does on tracks like Indestructible and the older With Every Heartbeat.

this keeps coming back so i have to give in and give it my 11

JunkyGS: #BODY TALK AVERAGE 7.62

**GlialUreterostenosis** I remember an episode of the Colbert Report where he went to Sweden to joke about how Sweden's taxes have left their rich and famous living in poverty. One of the segments took place at Robyn's house, a giant, lonely mansion that had almost nothing in it. White walls, no furniture. I know it's because she spends so much time on the road, but damn if it wasn't a good metaphor for her music.

**Hikkaru** robyn just really isn't for me, the production isn't nearly enough to carry her boring voice and static song progression

**ManofOranges** For me this is certainly one of the better albums out of the bunch, maybe the best one although I couldn't say for sure. I was expecting it to be better in my opinion probably just because I'd heard a lot of hype around it. It's still not bad though, I suppose. Its songs certainly run the gamut from amazing in Dancing On My Own to bottom of the barrel in Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do.

**Jexan13** Look, this album is truly great. However, it's too long for its own good, since it's unavoidable to start losing interest in the last tracks.

**Waluigiest** The highlights here are so good - her dancepop niche is tasty.

**MrSwearword** It has slight "samey" issues and only 2-3 tracks are absolute garbage but consistent production and the two exceptional tracks save it from absolute wrath.

**ElizabethDDoS** It's difficult for me to retrospectively recognize the artistic impact this album may have had a decade ago, but it sounds good and has undeniably ICONIC songs on it.

**Ditacarlita** Checked out Robyn a few months ago, didn't like any of it. Had to listen to this awful album again for this rate. Only a few songs were even semi worth listening to.

**Sundraliz** I'll admit it got a little snoozy during the last few songs. But damn there are some gems in here Robyn is truly a legend.

**Ghost-Quartet** A good, if somewhat overrated, album. Robyn cranking out three EPs in the course of a year just to prove that she could then ghosting the music industry for eight years was pretty iconic, but the cracks of this method show in how some of the songs (especially on the back half) are underwhelming/repetitive compared to the titanic highs of some of the songs. Robyn produced some legendary songs but I can't say that she produced what I'd consider to be a legendary album, especially when stacked up against some of the other albums in the rate. I felt much the same way about *Honey*, I think her style just might not really be for me.

**Twat_Brained** This is one of very few albums I can confidently say holds up to all the praise it receives. I am done sleeping on Madame Carlsson

**Cardinalsigns12** An amazing album. “Melodrama” follows in its footsteps in being ear candy, great lyrics, bittersweet/melancholy yet cathartic. Reminds me of Janelle Monae’s albums in that way too.

**CreepyMannequin** The first four tracks are incredible, but I find the rest of the album pretty forgettable and I just forget what those songs sound like the second they end.

**Qustomar** I've actually never listened thru this album in full before! and honestly i'm kind of mixed on the album. there are a lot of amazing electro-pop bangers on this album, but also a lot of songs which r just meh musically, and feel like they stay in the same spot while listening. i know this album was 2 EPs and everything, but it rlly should've just been 1 album with 10 songs, bc there r too many weak songs on the tracklist that dampen the experience between gorgeous songs like dancing on my own and hang with me. i think at the time the album was released everything about it must have felt innovative and forward-thinking, but now some of the songs held up very well but some aged very badly (the 6 songs i gave lower than a 7 lol).

**Agusarg** A really good album, but the first half is a lot better than the second half. Even if the latter has some standouts, it pales in comparison to the pop perfection that are the first couple of tracks.

**Vayyiqra** This is one of my favourite albums of all time - I love Scandipop, and synthpop (that retro sound on this record never gets old), and have liked Robyn's music since I was a wee lad back in the 90s. While it's lost a bit of its magic after hearing it so many times, it still holds up very well and is a fun, enjoyable album from beginning to end. Some of the best songs in the rate are on here (classics like "Dancing On My Own" and "Call Your Girlfriend", and my 11, "Indestructible") and even the slightly goofy on a few tracks ("Fembot", "Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do") have their charm. There isn't a truly bad song on this album, though it does waver a bit when it tries to foray into reggae-ish feel on a couple of tracks. I would love to do a comment for each song and a longer writeup, but I'm pressed for time, so that's all I will say for now. Overall score: 7.7

**Rosecult** Amazing, perfect, it was in my car for most of my sophomore year of college


**J_Toe** Honestly do not get they hype for this or Honey on Robyn.

**Letsallpoo** the thing with this album is that a handful of songs are amazing and the rest is mostly terrible
