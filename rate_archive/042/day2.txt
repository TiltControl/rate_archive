Uzi once again finds himself at the bottom in the bonus rate. Another in a long line of examples of random artists being thrown together for soundtrack songs, this would be the best song from the forgettable *Bright* if ["Orc Cop"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL2yG3bgIgg) didn’t exist.

---
**preduxz** (9.7): some of uzi's best delivery EVER. it WORKS

**robbiec\_** (7): maybe they snapped idk anymore

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): this kinda bangs, but the musical diversity in Bright: The Album makes me uncomfortable.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This Uzi verse is kinda hard but I do not enjoy what Aoki did on this track at all, I fucked with Aoki a while ago but honestly he has not been decent in a long time.

**Kaylaboe** (5): kinda goes off. but still a mexx

**Brendon-Urine** (2): This... kinda sucks

**ClocktowerMaria** (2): this is horrible

**OriginalKappa** (2): I feel bad for the Bright soundtrack it obviously was very expensive to get like 25 A-Listers to collaborate and make literally no hits or even good songs

A (pointless, in my opinion) remix of one of the best songs on *Luv is Rage 2*. Nicki’s verse feels fairly tacked on, and material like this really made me grateful of her return on “Chun-Li”.

---
**awhile2** (10): ok so i know nickis verse doesnt match the songs theme at all but her voice fits the vibe so well

**Piccprincess** (9): Nicki a queen

**robbiec\_** (9): Nicki adds nothing with her verse but her singing is so lovely

**Brendon-Urine** (6): This version is better than the original but still not great

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Nicki Minaj really just didn’t do a single thing for this track, she doesn’t fit it at all, and while the original is a classic this is just sad because we lose the first Uzi verse which is much more fitting than Nicki’s random musings about money. Also the Nicki outro is not good.

**preduxz** (5): yah no

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): I can't say that Nicki doesn't add anything to this song, she does. But she makes it a lot worse.

**frogaranaman** (3.5): It’s like Nicki can only rap about being the best when she’s clearly not.

**OriginalKappa** (2): Why do these remixes sound so terrible like it just jumps right into the song and nicki's bit is just so contrasting to the rest of this ughhh why did you make me listen to so much lil uzi guys

**ClocktowerMaria** (1): literally fucking why would this ever exist

**Darkra01** (1): Nicki made this even worse like how

Even in the bonus rate, Uzi can't catch a break at all with you guys. At least he's still in the real rate, I guess?

One of the most popular tracks from Uzi’s mixtape *Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World*, this Metro Boomin produced single features introspective rhymes about relationships.

---
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Invented music, invented Scott Pilgrim, invented the open-bolt submachine gun known as the Uzi. I fucking LOVE LUV vs the World and this is one of the best tracks off of what I personally believe is far and away his best project. This chorus is just everything.

**awhile2** (9): one of the worst songs on LUV vs the World but its still a 9

**Brendon-Urine** (9): This was the first Uzi song I heard and I was hooked right away. Something about the meandering beat is just so good.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): iconic tbh

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): I miss this uzi sound a bit and hope it comes back

**Kaylaboe** (6): this is much better than most of luv 2 rage

**OriginalKappa** (2): lil uzi is legitimately a terrible human being and he can't even compensate by making good music lol

Released after a hilarious and bizarre promo campaign in which Vince started a GoFundMe in which people could donate to make him stop releasing music or saying anything publicly, “Get the Fuck Off My Dick” rebukes Vince’s haters and throws bars around.

---
**Darkra01** (10): i wouldnt get off Vinces dick tbh that man fine

**robbiec\_** (10): this song was playing in my ear when I was talking to this little old lady at the library reception

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The most soothing and chill fuck you won’t ever.

**Kaylaboe** (9): no

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A loosie but a goodie. The single cover is hilarious and this track is as seamless and Vince Staples-y as they come.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Norf Norf soccer mom is weeping somewhere

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): pretty smooth and nice from vince, the promo campaign for this was hilarious

The first actual song on Vince’s EP *Prima Donna*, “War Ready” features a sample of Andre 3000’s verse on “ATLiens” by OutKast. British electronic musician James Blake provided the song’s production, the first of two collaborations between the two on the EP.

---
**robbiec\_** (10): PUTMYGLOCKAWAYIGOTASTRONGERWEAPONTHATNEVERRUNSOUTOFAMMUNITIONSOIMREADYFORWAROKAY

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): hard

**preduxz** (8.6): ay good shit

**-dolantello-** (8.5): A N D R E

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): vince rapping alongside samples of other rappers is a award winning formula

**OriginalKappa** (8): may have to listen to the prima donna ep now

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Vince Staples’ Prima Donna EP was better than his album in a lot of ways, and War Ready, while being one of the weaker tracks, has some remarkable instrumentation.

**awhile2** (3): honestly this song just makes me upset that im not listening to ATLiens

**Darkra01** (1): this shit made me not wanna see Pacific Rim 2 even more

A short remix of Jay-Z’s “4:44”, Tyler uses the soulful beat to rap about his personal life in the time since the release of *Flower Boy*. He performs this life on tour and it’s amazing.

---
**Kaylaboe** (9): is this tyler’s lemonade?

**sletrab07** (9): Since Jay won't release 4:44 on YT, this sample was the closest we got to having it in the rate.

**robbiec\_** (8.5): i’m addicted to this sample

**awhile2** (8): the beat alone makes it impossible for this song to get anything lower than a 7

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): pretty neat, nice bars from tyler i like the line about his boyfriend. Sad reminder that he somehow debuted under a talentless "artist" with nothing interesting to say or do ever.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): he's right about having the best album out

**enecks** (6): zip

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Solid I suppose, but the original track 4:44 is way better than this imo

I’m sad at y’all. Today’s first track is a love song, structured as a voicemail being left by Tyler to someone he has feelings for. A sort-of companion demo to the song, ["Rose Tinted Cheeks"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAT477KNGfY), was released by Tyler last month.

---
**kappyko** (10): oh my fucking god this is the best possible time to hear this album

**chipsi1** (9): This is so great, I also love the connection between this and the last song with the voicemail

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): rain...glitter

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): but why would you feel like that movie tho

**sletrab07** (8.5): Is it a concidence that this album has 2 tracks named "Glitter" and "911" in them? Tyler is clearly communicating an underlying love for Mariah Carey's seminal 2001 film/soundtrack "Glitter."

**1998tweety** (8.3): I liked it but it got kinda weird at the end.

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): This song highlights what actually makes Tyler happy, which is a change from much of the album. However, the slow part and the hook aren’t great to me, but the track is still very enjoyable.

**enecks** (8): This is the audio equivalent of :-3 - a good emote that furrys really love.

**zamomattel** (8): a lamb? Yesss tyler

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Mariah Carey is shook! Yeah

**robbiec\_** (7): 911 who?

**Raykel** (6.5): They could've gotten a better singer :/

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): doesn't cover ground that other songs on the album haven't

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): This is so much better live without the pitched vocals

**Mudkip1** (6): la di da di da slob on me knob

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): the chorus is great but everything else is a snoozer

Vince linked up with Ty Dolla Sign for this moody song, his album closer. The album’s video features product placement for Sprite, one of many shoutouts to the soda in Vince’s career.

---
**Mudkip1** (10): bop

**robbiec\_** (10): Ty$ rapping means nothing to me, it's subpar at best. But maybe this is because I absolutely ADORE crooning Ty$ especially on here. This is such a THICK instrumental as well

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): make it rain gurl

**chipsi1** (9): Extremely catchy, the hook is fantastic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Ty Dolla Sign needs to make a pop album!

**fuckupsomecommasyeah** (8): why is the first verse repeated whats the point make the song 45 seconds shorter

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Kinda a slept on track, love the Ty feature

**zamomattel** (8): probably one of the most conventional on the album and ty $ isn’t interesting to me but i still enjoy it

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is okay.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): ty $ was a very unexpected but pleasant feature

**letsallpoo** (7): let the rain come down / and wake my dreams

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this is fine but an underwhelming closer. i don't feel like much happens until the last minute or so.

**preduxz** (6.7): an unfortunately mediocre track to end this brilliant groundbreaking album on

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): Eh, feels very reserved compared to the rest

**kappyko** (6): production is coool and Vince provides nice verses. ty dolla $ign sounds weird

**BenjaIsStupid** (5.5): Don’t really like Ty Dolla $ign’s voice on the chorus and the production could be better. Not bad, but could be a lot better.

**shineflyer** (5.5): this feels like it needs something more to spice it up

**enecks** (5): An undercooked beat with some lyrics that are kinda sexist.

Car imagery is a frequent theme of Tyler’s music, and “Pothole” is no exception. An appropriate collaborator to bring along on this journey is Jaden Smith, a notable Tesla lover who featured the car in several of his music videos.

---
**foxxglove\_** (9.8): I didn't get Jaden Smith until this

**kappyko** (9): percussion and synths are on-point, outro makes it

**robbiec\_** (8.6): for some reason this songs makes me feel like i’m walking through the neighbourhood from the Who Dat Boy video

**chipsi1** (8.5): watch out for the plothole

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): Tyler sounds good and Jaden Smith surprisingly does a pretty good job on the hook. Production is nice and keeps with the style of the album. Pretty good song, but doesn’t exactly pop out when compared to the rest of the album.

**dropthehammer11** (8): this beat so good

**enecks** (8): Lowkey in the scheme of this album but still impeccably produced. Jaden Smith doesn't have much of a presence.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): stream SYRE now!

**zamomattel** (8): would be a 10 if it was with willow smith

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): This song gets a little old, but it's still OK.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Theme song of my city during spring time after 6 months of winter.

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): hook is kinda eh

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): question: my brother kinda stans jaden but i haven't heard his project yet. is it actually good?

**preduxz** (7.3): feels like an unnecessary continuation of what Tyler was going for on Cherrybomb, although he nails the sound a little better

**1998tweety** (7.2): Jaden doesn't actually sound awful on this.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Jadens vocals didn't need to be here, rest is cool though

One of the few Uzi survivors of Day 1 goes out early on Day 2. Uzi and Pharrell prove they have good chemistry on this smooth, colorful track. Pharrell dropping some bars is something I’ll always love, and this is no exception. “Neon Guts” jumped all over the place during the course of submissions, ranging from the top 10 to the low 30s. In the end, it finished in a solid position but just outside the top 30. Uzi just can’t catch a break.

**enecks** (10): Pharrell is a legend. This is good stuff.

**kappyko** (9.5): Pharrell really coming through on Ari's album, sorry Max FLOPPing. If I don't hear Ari cover Neon Guts life is not worth living

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): god pharrel delivers on the beat here, the rest coulda been trash and it'd be great. Thankfully both of em have nice chemistry and have fun on this track

**minibjork** (8.5): "neon guts"

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Pharrell is a legend

**1998tweety** (8.3): Pharrell kinda saves this song.

**frogaranaman** (8): I feel like I’m listening to a Mr. Rodgers remix.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): best song on the album

**BenjaIsStupid** (7): Pharrell is cool on this track and the production is good, plus Uzi doesn’t sound bad.

**lunasaflowers** (7): All hail our Lord and saviour, Pharrell! His production and voice makes everything better here, even Uzi.

**PuggleMaster** (6.5): uzi ruined this

**shineflyer** (5.5): pharrell almost cancels out the fact that this is a lil uzi vert track

**Brendon-Urine** (5): I was hoping Pharrell would come through but I was disappointed. It's not awful, but kinda forgettable.

**OriginalKappa** (5): Pharrell obviously had a huge amount to do with this song and it helps it but I'm not giving Uzi good scores like this whole album should go out day 1

**preduxz** (5): hmmmm nah

**Mudkip1** (4): pharrells part was the only part i liked

**Lowest Scores:** (3 x2) awhile2, Piccprincess (4 x2) letsallpoo, zamomattel 

---
Probably the most direct acknowledgement on *Flower Boy* of Tyler’s sexuality, “Garden Shed” spawned a large amount of speculation and discussion upon the release of the album. Many listeners believed the titual garden shed to be a metaphor for Tyler’s feelings about being in the closet. The song keeps things just vague enough to not be able to make a definitive conclusion (likely intentionally), but the song feels very personal and emotionally resonant to Tyler.

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): The intro is a bit too long, but the production is some of the best on the album and the long intro does create a relaxed vibe. Kind of disappointed that there’s only one verse, but Tyler gets a lot across in that amount of time.

**preduxz** (10): the expressive transition throughout this track should stand the test of time as one of the most powerful musical moments in hip-hop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): one of the most beautiful, iconic, delicate, gorgeous songs of our time. You can just tell that the buildup, which lasts for most of the song, is leading up to something big, and when that thing happens, it's gorgeous and important and well-delivered. A masterpiece.

**enecks** (9): A restrained coming out track that has some wild instrumental work that just makes my mind drift.

**lunasaflowers** (9): This track is spacey and heavenly and such a quietly beautiful coming-out moment.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Another female vocalists equals another song I like.

**kappyko** (8.5): Estelle's chorus has such an urgency to it that i feel like i have to hold my breath. The distorted guitars strums break the tension but it remains there and Tyler's second verse pops in and it all feels really visceral

**robbiec\_** (8.5): this is a rock song

**Death\_Soup** (8): lgbt anthem

**chipsi1** (7.5): this was sleepy on estelle's part but got better when Tyler started rapping

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I was a bit disappointed by this, it also just end pretty abruptly. Was expecting more (other than possible confirmation of Tyler’s sexuality).

**Raykel** (7): Gay <3

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): See I fuck with it once tyler comes in with the verse but the first part just... isn't that interesting, it's nice and pretty but feels too slow. The verse is amazing and I'm really proud of tyler for being open about his sexuality in this manner.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): production is not strong enough for it to drag like this

**shineflyer** (5.5): very good background music

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I love Estelle but this was pretty underwhelming honestly, really slow and doesn’t really entice me until the last minute or so.

**zamomattel** (4): a tad dull, takes a while to pick up

**awhile2** (3): almost every song on this album sounds the same

A pulsating techno track that really deserved better. I’ll never forgive you all, yadda yadda yadda. This is definitely one of the songs on the album that got way better when I saw them live. Vince’s show is so good, you guys.

**1998tweety** (7.4): Another boring song, can this album please end on a good note.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): it's pretty cool, i love the idea of it but the hook slightly disappoints compared to the verse

**kappyko** (7): production saves this bc the percussion is everything, like the party ppl chant but come ON

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I like the idea of this track, but the chorus is kinda really not good. Vince always has this problem, but this one is just really generic and actively detracts from the rest of the record.

On easily one of Kendrick’s poppiest songs to date, he links up with Rihanna for the first time to trade verses around relationships. The song uses a prominent vocal sample of the talkbox intro of Bruno Mars’s ["24K Magic"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmSj8m8ntw), which will probably be the only time Bruno Mars is ever sampled on a rap song.

---
**Death\_Soup** (11): this is one of those songs where I can't describe just how much I love it using words. What I can say is that I've had it on repeat ever since the album and now it's probably my 3rd favorite song ever. The beat is absolutely INSANE

**awhile2** (10): best song on the album dont @ me

**dropthehammer11** (10): pop rap done RIGHT

**frogaranaman** (10): Wow, this Rihanna album is way different than expected.

**PuggleMaster** (10): Queen of not dying

**robbiec\_** (10): i fucking love you Rihanna i love you to fuck feed me limb by limb to those street sharks

**Darkra01** (9): love semi rapping rihanna

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Any song featuring Rihanna is a good song in my books. Also I appreciate the backwards 24K Magic sample.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i know some people don't like this but even though Kendrick is kind of lacking on it, the sample and Rihanna make the song

**1998tweety** (8.6): My fav song so far and it's probably cause of Riri.

**lunasaflowers** (8.6): This song is a big grower, even if it is "poppy".

**chipsi1** (8.5): this bops

**Raykel** (8.5): WE WANT A RAP ALBUM RIH! Also, that 10-4 no switching siiiiidesss is candy for the earworm.

**enecks** (8): A bizarre bop because of a 24K Magic sample way more choppy, as well as the fact that Rihanna has harder bars in this than Kendrick.

**shineflyer** (8): turns out, playing Bruno Mars backwards also gets nominated for grammys.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I honestly start to believe this song isn’t that good, but then I actually listen to it. It’s great.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): two of my faves... it's a great song, but just not at the same level as most of the album. Would love to see more of rap Rihanna in her album though.

**zamomattel** (8): this is a little disappointing but I do still like it

**preduxz** (7.6): great interplay between riri and k dot

**BenjaIsStupid** (7): Kendrick’s flow is good, but his nasally delivery kind of gives off the vibe that he wasn’t giving 100%. + the sample is a little annoying. Overall good track, and Rihanna does a great job on it, but it leaves a little to be desired.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): If it wasn't for Rihanna I wouldn't care about this song

**OriginalKappa** (6.5): I'm not sure the degree to which this sub stans Rihanna so this may get really high scores although it probably shouldn't

**CopyCatJ** (6): I love Riri but I loathe that Bruno sample.

One of the more outwardly political songs on *DAMN.*, in which Kendrick raps about protest and the 2016 election. The song also features collaborations with acclaimed saxophonist Kamasi Washington on the string arrangements, producer KAYTRANADA (/u/kappyko) on backing vocals, and Canadian jazz band BADBADNOTGOOD on production.

---
**robbiec\_** (10): so many of these songs were nearly my elevens, everything about this song from the repetition to the Ratboy sample consumes me this song sounds like a green dimly lit room at 4 in the morning

**shineflyer** (10): it's such an uneasy yet chill beat

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): the most underrated song in the album by far. This shit is so beautiful and yet it seems it's one of the most forgotten songs. The reverb works so well and that hook just kills me every time.

**preduxz** (9.7): dreamy but haunting production in a grimy and great track

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): haunting and beautiful

**BenjaIsStupid** (9): On this track, Kendrick describes a monotonous lifestyle, but he manages to not feel preachy because he frames himself as still being in that cycle and he still struggles with lusting over things he knows won’t satisfy him in the long term, but will keep him entertained day to day. Very unique and definitely stands out.

**Darkra01** (9): id let Kendrick stick more than the head in tbh

**1998tweety** (8.1): This is chill. [2]

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Mmmm badbadnotgood providing more dreamy tracks on here, not something I ever expected kendrick to do but I love it

**Death\_Soup** (8): this song gives me anxiety

**frogaranaman** (8): In honor of this song title, I will link some Tumblr posts of guys that my gay ass thinks are beautiful: one; two; three; four; five + six.

**enecks** (7): hmm

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Somewhere between TPAB and UU track, LUST. deals with its respective sin with great tact and some hard instrumentation. I love the drums, the way they reverse and feel so crisp makes this still a damn good track.

The opening song on *Flower Boy*, and the first of several featuring vocals from 20 year-old British singer Rex Orange County. It’s also a rarity in Tyler’s music in that it features a sample, using portions of a 1997 Sonic Youth remix of the song “Spoon” by German band Can.

---
**enecks** (10): Shakespeare has written intros less effective and emotionally investing than this. The simple beat fades into strings as the album's central tragedy reveals itself - the isolation and loneliness of Tyler's existence, which he juxtaposes with the racial environment that makes #BlackLivesMatter a necessity.

**kappyko** (10): The title makes this sound like an intro when it... well, isn't

**lunasaflowers** (10): I love the tension and anxiety in this song, especially with how Tyler keeps asking questions. Both Tyler and Rex set the mood and tone for the rest of the album so well.

**preduxz** (10): sets the tone for a brilliant album to come and a whole new tyler

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): A perfect example of Tyler's flow. The lyrics on this track and really fun to listen to.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): BITCH FUCK and then it's all amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Really love the production on this track, and also the features vocals are great too. A strong intro the album imo

**Kaylaboe** (9): sunflower boy really did that, didn’t he? his mind, :despair:

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): a very good intro to the best album of 2017

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): Good opening track to start the album. The first verse with the connecting bars about cars and fame is good and the track sets a precedent for some of the subject matter explored in the album. The production is a nice introduction for the style Tyler went for on the album.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is okay.

**zamomattel** (6.5): love rex, but no spoilers, there is another better rex song

**shineflyer** (6): the "keep my head on straight" line... damn

In this song, Vince uses the number 745 for a bit of clever wordplay, referencing both the time in which he’ll pick up a woman as well as the BMW 745 he’ll be driving. Keeping up the themes of love and sex brought up in the previous few tracks, Vince uses a cynical, dour delivery over fusion hip hop/techno production.

---
**letsallpoo** (10): the way the title gets repeated sounds so sinister

**preduxz** (10): goddamn dude that bass is beautiful af and so expressive

**zamomattel** (9.5): this starts like a marina and the diamonds song but I cant remember which one

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): I kinda can't believe a song like this exists, dope though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): another banger

**1998tweety** (8.3): Its a bit slow at times but at least the beat is cool.

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): Like Big Fish, the hook is great and the production is weird and unique. Overall an enjoyable track.

**chipsi1** (8): I remember thinking that the hooks on this album were bad the first time i listened to it, but this pretty much disproves my claim

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the production on this track, and how even though it’s still trap, it’s experimental sounding. Vince rides the beat well too.

**robbiec\_** (8): probably the most conventional rap song on the album but even then

**enecks** (7.5): Seven point four five rounds to seven point five. A good but not great song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): If I could I would give this track a 7.45

**lunasaflowers** (6.7): Would've give this a 7.45 to be that guy if I could've tbh.

**awhile2** (6): finally a vince staples hook that doesnt suck. Too bad its wasted on this forgettable ass track

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): worst song on the album imo, kind of repetitive and I don't find Vince very interesting on it

**shineflyer** (5): it kinda starts to drone on after a bit

**kappyko** (4): The squelchy beat I suppose serves as a come down from the energy of the prior track. The bass on this is impressive, but the song itself feels underdeveloped. I understand the slow jam vibes, but it's not my thing. Outro is gorgeous.

**Mudkip1** (4): grating

**Lowest Scores:** (3.5 x1) kappyko (4 x1) Nowhereman222 (5 x1) frogaranaman 

---
A downbeat, dour track in which Kendrick raps about the downsides of fame, including depression, exploitation, and enemies in the rap game.

---
**awhile2** (10): that moment when the guitar comes in in the second verse makes me so hard

**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Endlessly flowing, Kendrick pours every last one of his feelings for everyone to hear, supported by a low-key backdrop of unintelligible vocal samples and moving beat.

**Death\_Soup** (9): fucking love the beat. Incredibly chill song

**enecks** (9): An emotional frenzy that starts slow but builds to something amazing and intense.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Didn’t here this song until today, but I feel like it’s one of the most underrated songs on the album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): I feel like I should like this even more than I do. It's low-key and it has the makings of a song I would normally adore, but it never really progresses into something big, into something to make it a 10.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): that sample in the beginning needed to be used more but still a great song

**chipsi1** (8): Charli tweeted about you which basically means god tweeted about you why are you asking for prayers

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Yeah here we go, Kendricks back in his comfort zone with some moody and really emotional rap

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Very emotional track here and the heavy repetition only adds to the pain here, love the “ain’t nobody praying for me” line in particular.

**preduxz** (7.8): a solid song buoyed by great verses

**zamomattel** (7.5): definitely one of the low points of a pretty perfect album

**1998tweety** (7.1): This goes off at points.

**robbiec\_** (7): a GKMC throwback!

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Not a huge fan of the beat on this one.

**shineflyer** (6): it's got a vibe and all but there's better

**frogaranaman** (5): Cut to me, sitting in the middle of a historically black jazz lounge. “FEEL.” is playing in the background with a live band playing the instrumental. Feet up on my table, I have one hand holding a gin cocktail and the other holding a cigarette. I begin to take a long drag, puffing out the smoke fifteen seconds later. I look at the drink then the cigarette and utter the following line.. “Man, I need to start vaping.”

**kappyko** (3.5): for some reason I wanted to laugh at the intro and I nearly did at the yelling flow he went into near the end

One of the more faster-tempo songs on Vince’s album, this song features a prominent interpolation of “Hold Me Back” by Rick Ross. Once again, Kilo Kish jumps on the track for backing vocals.

---
**foxxglove\_** (10): Vince's continual frustration that he isnt more famous or lauded is my favorite thing. Give him what he knows he deserves.

**Mudkip1** (10): bop

**preduxz** (10): fantastic immersive production

**shineflyer** (10): is that the Nintendo Switch logo

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): kilo kish <3

**1998tweety** (9): Wtf this goes off so hard.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): banger plain and simple

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): his verses on this are just unreal honestly

**zamomattel** (9): a wild tune

**Raykel** (8.8): Oh I will puch everyone out of my way when this song comes on

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): The beat on this is insane.

**chipsi1** (8.5): this hook is really catchy

**lunasaflowers** (8.4): An upswing!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): angery at the fact that y'all put the clean version in this playlist but yes, this is also a banger.

**BenjaIsStupid** (7): Hook is good, production is good, and the verses are good. A good song.

**robbiec\_** (7): one of the weakest songs imo but one of the BEST instrumentals, penis. shoutout all the pears

**enecks** (5): A Rick Ross interpolation? Really?

---
The opening track on *Big Fish Theory* references the philosophy of crabs, who if placed in a space together will crawl and climb over each other to escape. Vince’s also used ‘crabs in a bucket’ as a metaphor for his environment on the lead single for his previous album *Summertime ’06*, “Senorita”. “Crabs” also features co-production by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and backing vocals by singer and frequent Vince collaborator Kilo Kish.

---
**1998tweety** (11): This is very atmospheric and I like it for that. The female vocals kicked in and all my hair fell off.

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Shit slaps

**Mudkip1** (10): bop

**preduxz** (10): perfectly marries vince with dance music sensibilities in a minimal but fantastic way

**enecks** (9): This instrumental feels like a windy cyberpunk beach. At first I dismissed it, but this has more lyrical and production complexity than the surface.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): this shit cool as fuck

**Raykel** (8.5): I'm in love with these instrumentals

**Kaylaboe** (8): yas bring that average down

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): just gonna use this comment to express my love for Justin Vernon. I love you Justin Vernon.

**zamomattel** (8): good as an opener but doesn’t stand THAT well alone

**frogaranaman** (7.5): I love STD awareness songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel like I am in a club and I’m not sure how to feel about this. It sounds cool though, but there’s no substance.

**shineflyer** (7.5): this is where this album really starts to get good

**BenjaIsStupid** (7): Bit of a weird song which kind of puts me off from listening to it, but I still enjoy it nonetheless. It’s put together weirdly with weird vocal samples, but Vince comes through with some good bars and personality.

**kappyko** (7): Production is nice, but as an intro it kind of bores.

**OriginalKappa** (7): How is this Bon Iver produced? Is this what 22, A Million, sounds like? Should I listen to that?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): On his Red Lobster shit

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): I really like the outro. Not a song I like enough to revist outside of context of the album but it's still a good opener

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) awhile2 (2 x1) Mudkip1 

---
Tyler has described November as the best time of your life. In a song where he voices insecurities about his fame and relationships, it ends with a nostalgic wish to be taken back to his best memories before allowing a collage of other voices to speak about their own “November”.

---
**robbiec\_** (10): I forgot why I love this song and writing this my score just kept going up

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): nostalgia done right

**kappyko** (9.5): my heart hurts listening to this album

**BenjaIsStupid** (9): Lyrically one of the best tracks. Tyler’s flow is great and the slowed-down part at the end is really good, too. The interview part is cool, too. Great song.

**preduxz** (8.7): self-conscious and insular in an uncomfortable but insightful way

**frogaranaman** (8.5): My only memory of November is drinking beer with my family entirely too underaged.

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Feels like the real ending to the album

**lunasaflowers** (8): I love the whole concept of "your/my November" as a perfect time in somebody's life.

**shineflyer** (7.5): my November hasn't happened yet, I think. but maybe soon

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): :genericsad:

**zamomattel** (7.5): my November was... idk I don’t have memories

Kendrick has a history of including one very long song on his albums, and “FEAR.” follows in the tradition of “Mortal Man” on *To Pimp a Butterfly* and “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” on *good kid, m.A.A.d city*. Like “Sing About Me”, Kendrick uses different verses to rap from different viewpoints, of himself as a child, teenager, and adult. The song features additional vocals from Kendrick’s cousin Carl and production from famed hip hop producer The Alchemist.

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): The longest song on the album, FEAR. really shows the listener why Kendrick has been so broken this whole album. The fear he’s accumulated throughout his life has weighed down on him, only multiplying during his recent rise to fame. Powerful and meaningful.

**dropthehammer11** (10): wew lad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): there's so much happening here. Even though I agree with Fantano that the voicemail at the end is pretty problematic, I still think the song itself, musically, is a 10.

**preduxz** (9.8): oof, thematically one of kendrick's strongest tracks

**kappyko** (9.5): This sounds like a To Pimp a Butterfly cut, which is great; I felt the groove and melancholy of jazz influence accented the lyrical moments of that record in a way that most of the woozy beats on *DAMN.* do not. It actually sounds cinematic.

**chipsi1** (9): This is a huge snatcher ugh but i hate the mentality of having to be redeemed by god so much

**enecks** (9): This is the twin peaks of Kendrick - gratuitous backwards stuff, moody vibes, complexity, pretentiousness.

**OriginalKappa** (8): Would be a 9 if not for the questionable mini-sermon it packs in at the end

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The long and “boring” track on DAMN., Kendrick Lamar gives his most introspective look on the album yet. It’s painfully real, and it’s all on display. His explanation of what fear entails is riveting and he does this all over a simple, static beat.

**zamomattel** (8): daddy kendrick

**1998tweety** (7.3): The worst parts are the bits where he sounds high. Also why is this so long?

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): it doesn't help that kendrick had already teased this beat making it feel weird in the context of the album, this song is a bit too long with not enough interesting in kendricks flow or the beat changing, feels too standstill.

**shineflyer** (4.3): long songs aren't inherently bad. but if the song is long, it kinda needs the beat to back it up

**Mudkip1** (4): why is this almost 8 minutes long

A unique collaboration between 5 fairly different artists, this song brings together Vince, Kilo Kish, R&B singer Ray J, Gorillaz and Blur frontman Damon Albarn, and electronic duo GTA. The inclusion of Ray J was definitely notable for Vince, who has expressed his undying love for Ray J in past interviews.

---
**PuggleMaster** (11): wig with the fishes tbh

**enecks** (10): When the beat kicks in I dance.

**kappyko** (10): vogue/ballroom influences are amazing, kilo kish provides a more interesting verse than anything kendrick did on damn. :flushed: but fr this song is so sonically exciting

**preduxz** (10): unhh holy shit ray j and kilo kish are flame on flame on flame on a fantastic beat

**robbiec\_** (10): In my head this song comes after CIAB and like it this feels like the cramming as much of club history into one track in an excellent way

**minibjork** (9.5): kilo kush slaughtered that verse omg

**zamomattel** (9.5): one the weirdest on an already weird album

**1998tweety** (9.4): This beat reminds me of Like A G6, meaning this is a bop.

**strawberryswing1** (9): was a 10 but idk if i like that outro

**dropthehammer11** (8): super frantic beat, love it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The opening to this is so gorgeous and wild that it should highkey be the introduction to the album

**TragicKingdom1** (8): unnerving but in a trancy, exciting way

**lunasaflowers** (7.9): Kilo Kush is used very well on this song, but I wish the rest of the song went somewhere more.

**Raykel** (7.5): How does he make the production so dark yet so fun

**awhile2** (7): ummm kilo kish slays this song

**chipsi1** (7): enjoyable

**letsallpoo** (7): everything up to when Vince starts up feels extraneous

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): once again, Vince kind of takes a step back and lets the beat be the main part of the song. Not a huge fan of that.

**frogaranaman** (6.5): I love how this album is just, like.. almost rap.

**OriginalKappa** (6.5): I should like this its got Damon Albarn on it but it just isnt working sorry

**BenjaIsStupid** (6): I love when the beat and bass kick in, but I can’t decide if this is a mess or if it’s panicked.

Beginning with a beautiful string piece, “Where This Flower Blooms” is the latest in a long line of collaborations between Tyler and Frank dating back almost a decade. He described the song in an interview as wanting it to sound like a Disney score and his “perfect little indie movie”.

**Darkra01** (11): daddy Frank yassssssssss

**enecks** (10): This gets 10 just for the OJ Simp Sun line

**Kaylaboe** (10): i’d make a troye joke here but i’m not gonna. i ship tyler+frank though

**chipsi1** (9.5): WIG

**kappyko** (9.5): i rock i roll i bloom i glow

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): I love you frank ocean, this song is amazing

**sletrab07** (9): This functions so effectively as a joint mission statement/album intro, Flower Boy kinda gets two chops at the cherry for opening tracks. This one definitely feels the more introductory of the two, and I suppose "Foreword" is more meant as a 'This is dedicated to' track than the intro of the album. The structure of this album is so intriguing.

**lunasaflowers** (8.5): Some of the best production on the album here. Soooo rich.

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): Production once again is nice and unique and Tyler has some nice flows and bars on the track + an appearance from Frank Ocean is always welcome.

**frogaranaman** (8): Oh my god, he’s talking about his first time bottoming.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The lesser of the Frank Ocean collabs on this album, but still a great one. I’m not big on the verses but the chorus is beautiful.

**1998tweety** (7.6): Also okay

**robbiec\_** (7.5): ITS ABOUT BOTTOMING OKAY 😩😩😩 Frank isnt a top but WHATEVER WORKS 💞

**shineflyer** (7): i ROCK. i ROLL. i BLOOM. i GROW

Other than maybe “LOYALTY.”, “LOVE.” is the closest thing Kendrick has ever made to a straight pop song. He both raps and sings about love and commitment over a synthy beat produced in part by Greg Kurstin (Taylor Swift, Sia, CHVRCHES, Adele, Ellie Goulding, Halsey). Singer Zacari, who had previously worked with Kendrick on the Isaiah Rashad collab “Wat’s Wrong”, provides vocals on the hook.

---
**TragicKingdom1** (11): yes, this is the poppiest song on the album and possibly in the rate, which makes me feel a little bad about giving it my 11...but there's just something so wholesome about it that makes me keep revisiting. the production is also surprisingly complex, there's a video about it on Spotify that you should check out

**Darkra01** (10): i thought the feature on this was justin bieber at first ngl

**dropthehammer11** (10): pop rap done RIGHT [2]

**kappyko** (10): It's corny and kind of a /r/popheads move that one of my highest rated songs from the record happens to be LOVE., the most overt delving into pop music that Kendrick takes. However, Zacari adds a beautiful melancholy that makes up for Kendrick's amateur singing. Not to say the untrained vocals don't work; rather, they create a layer of genuineness to the song that feels like it does come from a lyrical place that Kendrick doesn't really explore much. [citation needed?]

**robbiec\_** (10): I love everything about this song and at this point I decided to stan Kendrick

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I went from hating this track to having it be one of my favorites. It’s got such an atmosphere to it, and I really just relate it to taking Ubers around New York City at night, staring at everything surrounding me. It’s such a tune, with Zacari perfectly fitting as the feature and Kendrick Lamar giving a compelling performance. I just love the way he says “I’m just an exit away.”

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I just really like the atmospheric feel of this song from the production. It’s super soothing to me, and also catchy.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): this song is just so relaxing to me

**shineflyer** (9.5): I'm overusing the word "chill" in describing these songs, but... it is

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): a damn great pop song

**BenjaIsStupid** (9): Kendrick’s nasally delivery is, again, what kind of pull this track down, but everything else make up for it. The beat is serene and beautiful, while also being dynamic. I love Zacari’s voice, and the production really makes this track.

**zamomattel** (9): like this sounds like everything else last year but it cute af

**preduxz** (8.9): Kendrick is surprisingly romantic, huh

**1998tweety** (8.7): This one was nice as well.

**chipsi1** (8.5): awwww

**Brendon-Urine** (8): Zacari is fantastic on this track

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): maybe the only time kendrick has been "cute" but idgaf this song is adorable and that beat is amazing

**minibjork** (8): :')

**OriginalKappa** (7.5): Lol why is this just a zacari track on a kendrick album

**enecks** (7): Basic and poppy but kinda smooth

After a long break (mostly cause he has nothing left at this point), Uzi is back and losing one of his remaining two tracks at the end of Day 2. This moody, downbeat track features a prominent sample of the Oh Wonder song “Landslide”, with the sample being so extensive that Oh Wonder were later added to the song as a feature. An extremely unfitting Nicki Minaj verse was later tacked on for a remix when the song dropped as a single.

**vodkainsipido** (10): this song made me want a boyfriend to break up with him

---
**ClocktowerMaria** (10): perfect example of HOW to sample, he uses the original song almost wholesale but it fits literally into the songs concept of him listening to a song to get over a relationship and him harmonizing with the original song is kind of poetic

**Darkra01** (10): honestly this is the best song on the album the rest is mumble rap trash xoxoxo dont @ me

**dropthehammer11** (10): this shits fucking amazing who would’ve thought this would work but it did thank u uzi

**enecks** (10): Such an incredible hook tbh

**kappyko** (10): sample choice is brilliant for the production of this, chorus is amazing, actually sad shit. better make top 10 or im rioting

**Mudkip1** (10): why is this song so much louder than the rest do you think they did any mixing on this record at all. wtf are you doing on this album oh wonder. anyways, this is a bop

**Piccprincess** (10): Everyone go listen to Oh Wonder

**robbiec\_** (10): i just really love this song it actually MEANS something compared to the zeitgeist mess that came before. Oh Wonder on a rap song? what the fuck? Uzi doing an honest to god RnB song? yes goth gyal

**shineflyer** (10): it's entirely Oh Wonder's fault that this is a good song. damn you two.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Masterpiece. When I heard he was featuring Oh Wonder on this album I was skeptical but this is truly the pinnacle of indie music samples in rap music. It’s surprisingly poignant from Uzi, a flawless integration of Landslide, and the product is a song that not only builds on the original track, but usurps it. Very easily one of the best tracks he’s ever done.

**zamomattel** (9.5): easy his best

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): stop hurting Uzi!!

**1998tweety** (8.5): If I give this one song a high score then I won't feel bad giving the rest of the album 2s.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): truth be said, most of what i like on this song comes from Oh Wonder

**minibjork** (8): T-T </3

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): the sample is nice

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): is it a hot take to prefer the nicki remix

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Uzi is truly the queen of positivity and forward thinking.

**Raykel** (7): Honestly this is such a nice sentiment

**lunasaflowers** (6.6): Uzi's weird overpronunciation of words gets on my nerves. Otherwise this would've had a higher score.

**OriginalKappa** (5): Lol just base your entire hit song on another song's melody and lyrics sure that's ok

**BenjaIsStupid** (3.7): Not a fan of the beat and Uzi on this track.
