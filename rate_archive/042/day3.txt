The second collaboration between Kendrick and The Weeknd, this song faired a bit better than Abel’s collaboration with Uzi did in the real rate. It feels alot like “Starboy” but with Kendrick, something I’d never complain about.

---
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I initially gave this a 10, but it’s so overplayed so I had to take a 0.5 point away.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): both Sidewalks and Pray for Me are great songs, but I think Kendrick and Abel together have the potential to put out something special and I hope they try again.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): an EPIC collaboration. kendrick's verse is kind of cheesy and sanitized but i still vibe with this heavy

**enecks** (8): safe but good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A collab that I’ve been waiting for for a while. It may be a bit predictable but it’s fantastic, and Abel can do no wrong.

**robbiec\_** (7.8): it’s okay I just live for that fkn intro boy

**preduxz** (7.5): I hate hate hate that hook and I don't know why but production is amazing

**ClocktowerMaria** (3): how did kendrick end up doing this starboy leftover garbage

Tyler’s incredible remix of Kanye West’s “Freestyle 4”, a song featured in my previous rate. While Kanye’s bars on the beat left a bit to be desired on the original song, Tyler uses it to its maximum potential and more than eclipses “Freestyle” in my opinion. Rocky’s adlibs and hype-man rants only make the song more electric.

---
**robbiec\_** (10): Kanye found in the sunken place

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): GOAT beat

**awhile2** (8): hot take: freestyle 4 is a top 3 song on TLOP

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): sure whatever

**enecks** (7): heck

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Is it ridiculous to say I enjoy the original Kanye song better lol

Vince’s entry on the *Black Panther* soundtrack features an uncredited verse from Kendrick and some bars from female South African rapper Yugen Blakrok. It definitely embraces the African influences of *Black Panther*.

---
**ignitethephoenix** (10): The production is so good on this song, I like how it’s like Big Fish Theory even thought it’s from the BP soundtrack. Also Yugen kills her verse.

**preduxz** (10): bump bump BUMP

**robbiec\_** (10): this song already slapped them I seen the movie and it buried me under the house

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Honestly one of the best tracks of the year so far, Vince snaps, the chorus is amazing, the instrumental is stellar, and this soundtrack has no right to be as good as it is. This is the followup to Yeah Right we all deserved to have.

**frogaranaman** (9): I like that a Marvel song has DC references.

**sletrab07** (8.5): The film mix from Black Panther is a 10, so can TDE do us a favour and release the alternate version.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): you're dead to me

**enecks** (7): Oppan

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): this is the worst vince staples song ive ever heard

---
The first single from the Kendrick-curated soundtrack for *Black Panther*, “All the Stars” is a motivational pop-rap track that sees Kendrick largely hand over the spotlight to SZA. The song plays over the film’s end credits, a dazzlying sequence that gave the song new life for me.

**vodkainsipido** (7): if only this didn’t have kendrick and was fully sza

---
**Kaylaboe** (10): jewish queen. i think stars already are kosher idk i'm not an astronaut. the music video is absolutely gorgeous

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): okay so I know this song isn't really a 10 but it is one of my favorites currently so why the heck not

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I mean it took like 10 listens before I sort of figured out what SZA was saying, but I still love this song. It also fit perfectly as a credit song for the end of Black Panther. Kendrick aced the soundtrack for the movie and I can’t say anything bad tbh

**TragicKingdom1** (9): cinematic af. it's surprisingly catchy and i appreciate the production although it had to grow on me

**preduxz** (8.2): really underutilizing both Kendrick's and SZA's abilities but it's a good song so can't complain

**awhile2** (8): wouldve been better without the kendrick verse tbh

**Brendon-Urine** (8): SZA in the music video almost made me straight

**enecks** (8): safe but good

**minibjork** (8): all the stars are kosher

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The dream collab the world needed for the Black Panther soundtrack and got. This feels more like a SZA song than a Kendrick one, and for the most part, everything she contributes here is flawless. It pains me to say this but I could do without him on parts of this track. Otherwise amazing.

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): bluh, nice beat, kendrick and sza could be doing better things

The warning shot that opened the very sudden era of *DAMN.* Kendrick’s proclamation at the end that all rappers had till April 7th to get their shit together sent shockwaves through the internet, and it only could have been better had Kendrick actually released the album that day. Oh well.

---
**robbiec\_** (10): a WARNING

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): kill em with beats

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Fuck this got me SO HYPED when it dropped

**Darkra01** (9): remember when he shouted out April 7th in this and everyone thought that was when the album was dropping and turns out it WAS JUST THE FUCKIN PREORDER DATE

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Pure bars. I really love his flow on the track, and the lyrics but the production is a little flat. Still it’s well suited to the track, I just wish for a little more.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): could have been a 10 but noooooo he had to say 1,2,3,4,5, I am the greatest rapper alive smh

**preduxz** (8.4): goooood shit

**enecks** (8): flambe

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): a good teaser for Damn but i don't revisit it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Solid, if uneventful loose track before DAMN. A good entry to The Heart series.

…And it’s a bonus rate win for Tyler! A surprise one-off single dropped by Tyler at the end of March 2018, this track throws some major emoji eyes at Timothee Chalamet, throws speculation on Tyler’s sexuality another loop, and just bangs in general. It’s a more than deserving winner.

---
**Brendon-Urine** (10): Tyler's flow on this is so fucking addictive. On top of the rough ass beat and this song is just perfection.

A huge fan favorite becomes the first song of day 3. Described by comedian and friend of Tyler’s Jerrod Carmichel as being his “Billie Jean” in terms of how people connect with it. Inspiration for the song was fairly on the nose, as Tyler wrote it on an afternoon where he was very bored and felt like nobody was reaching out to him.

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Tyler spits some of the best verses on the album on this track about the monotony of his life and how success hasn’t fully satisfied him. Production is beautiful and the hook is memorable. It’s a song you can lay back and close your eyes and just enjoy.

**CopyCatJ** (10): One of my fav songs ever.

**enecks** (10): This is the kind of track that just captures a state of the soul - and one I can relate to. It's driving with open windows in a summer day alone for nothing. It's spending days in a room alone.

**kappyko** (10): :industryplant: feels a little out of place on the first chorus but when the drums kick in he sounds just at home. I wonder how many people are going to make a pun concerning the song's name? And how many people are going to think they're clever for it? The chorus is absolutely infectious every time, the woozy synths are pretty, Anna and Rex do wonders. This album is way less boring than DAMN. by the way

**Kaylaboe** (10): i’d give this a 12 if i could. features are amazing, tyler kills it, lyrics are great, producion immaculate. as gaga once said: would give birth to it

**lunasaflowers** (10): I love summer for its blue skies and sunshine, but despite that I often find myself in a depressive slump during the summer time. This song feels like how I feel like during those times, I love it a lot.

**sletrab07** (10): The second Rex feature, and my favourite track off the album. Ennui is a recurring element of Flower Boy, from the instrumentation to the effects to songs like "Boredom", where the lyrics explicitly discuss it. On the surface, there's relatability, but it's also very well-rounded sonically. Ironic that the song about boredom ended up with the album's best, most interesting groove.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Find some time to do something… best line on the album tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): seeing this live was life changing [2]

**preduxz** (9.9): aside some superfluous string arrangements, this song really develops the album beautifully

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): "find some time" is the most relatable and lowkey the catchiest chorus on the album

**1998tweety** (8.3): Chill

**chipsi1** (8): Honestly a great song, it's just a lil too long.

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Dreamy and gorgeous and just, wow yknow

**dropthehammer11** (7): this album sounds so sonically nice and i appreciate that but i can’t help but feel its missing something?

**zamomattel** (7): let me bathe in rex’s tone

**shineflyer** (6.5): a nice theme for being bored, honestly

A more soulful and guitar-based left turn in the middle of *DAMN.*, as well one of several songs on the album that directly channel its religious themes by being named after one of the seven deadly sins. Backing vocals on the track were provided by frequent Kendrick collaborator Anna Wise and Steve Lacy, a member of neo-soul band The Internet. Lacy has gotten a decent amount of higher-profile collaborations in the industry in recent years, working with Kali Uchis, Tyler, the Creator, Big Sean, Jhene Aiko, among others.

**vodkainsipido** (9): STEVE LACY FUCK ME

---
**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Absolutely amazing, psych and neo soul with kendrick and steve lacy working together, dreamy and dreary at the same time. Emotionally resonant and powerful

**dropthehammer11** (10): the instrumentation is gorgeous, reminds me of some classic beatles

**kappyko** (10): did somebody say RAVYN LENAE COLLABORATOR STEVE LACY!?!!?!!!!?!!!!??!!!!

**lunasaflowers** (10): My favourite song on the album! I just like the way all the instrumentation on this melds together.

**zamomattel** (10): LOVE the voice editing stuff

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): I've listened to this song dozens of times and I still had to listen to it twice just now so I can give it a score, and I'm still conflicted. It's a very complex song, great lyrically, but somewhat lacking in progression as well. Still, an integral part of the album and a great song in its own.

**robbiec\_** (8.3): I was at a party recently and I was stuck with someone I had nothing to talk to about so I started singing this song

**1998tweety** (8.2): This is chill.

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): Highlights his wishes to be a more perfect human and plays well into the flow of the album. Personally, it can feel a little underwhelming and doesn’t particularly stand out against the peaks of the album, but is still a very good song.

**enecks** (8): A smooth strumming that dabbles in this album's questionable perspective on religion but is otherwise a vibe.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): One of the slower tracks, but the lyrics are some seriously powerful stuff. That beat marches on, and Kendrick Lamar raps about “fake humble” that ties into the next song very well while also dissecting the construct of pride.

**shineflyer** (7.5): this singer is on the verge of death and trying to use any remaining air to sing

**preduxz** (7.4): steve lacy made this beat on an iphone wtf how

Kendrick’s album closer takes full advantage of his skills as a storyteller to recount the life of two men trying to make it in the world. One man, Anthony, goes to a KFC in which the other, Ducky, works with the intention of robbing it. Ducky shows generosity to Anthony and is able to prevent the robbery and possibly save his own life. At the end of the song, Anthony is revealed to be Top Dawg, the boss of Kendrick’s label, and Ducky is revealed to be Kendrick’s father. The single decision changed both Anthony and Duckie’s lives, as well as Kendrick’s. It’s a great piece of hip hop storytelling and a fitting end to the album, and the whole album being played fast in reverse at the end gave more credibility to the theory that *DAMN.* is meant to be played both forwards and backwards. The theory would later be acknowledged with the release of the *DAMN.* collector’s edition, which features a reversed tracklist in which “DUCKWORTH.” is the album opener.

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Kendrick’s storytelling and the production on this track make this one of my favorite track on DAMN.. Honestly everything about it is so great and it’s a great way to end the album.

**enecks** (10): This is the only Kendrick Lamar album closing tracks that has a legitimate case for being the best track.

**preduxz** (10): perfect closing to the album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Possibly one of the most underrated songs on the record? The way Kendrick snaps infinitely weaving this supposed story of his life over a constantly changing beat is just something else, and the story itself is delivered so matter-of-factly that the ending is that much more powerful.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): straight up bars and amazing storytelling. great outro.

**chipsi1** (9): This is a great closer and it honestly showcases why DAMN. is so great, even though it's wildly considered to be his worst album for some god forsaken reason, it's peak kendrick storytelling.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Really great classic story telling from kendrick, yeah

**Kaylaboe** (9): perfect way to close an album. or open it as well?

**lunasaflowers** (8.5): I love the storytelling on this song! The sample's nice as well.

**shineflyer** (8.5): i love that this track reverses the album at the end. also kendrick goes off

**minibjork** (8): fried chicken is a powerful thing

**robbiec\_** (8): perfect ending 💕 or beginning 🤔

**1998tweety** (7.8): This was a good end to the album.

**zamomattel** (7): the worst one closes, Kendrick don’t disappoint me again

**frogaranaman** (6.5): This is really poignant and comprehensive and all, but goddamn does my ADD ass not focus at all during this song.

**kappyko** (6): NATION.

One of several songs on *DAMN.* where Kendrick takes aim at some of his perceived enemies. Several speculated targets of the lyrics on “ELEMENT.” include Drake, Big Sean, and Jay Electronica, all of whom have exchanged subliminal shots with Kendrick in the past. Big Sean and Jay Electronica also both ironically collaborated with Kendrick on 2013’s ["Control"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7zdMeZPkpY), in which Kendrick called out a number of rappers telling them to step up their bars.

**vodkainsipido** (9): the gram triple meaning though

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Kendrick aims his sights specifically at his rap peers. Very catchy and pointed. Kendrick drops great lines and sounds fantastic on the mic.

**Darkra01** (10): "if i gotta slap a pussy ass nigga imma make it look sexy" was every straight white boys insta caption lets be real

**dropthehammer11** (10): some of kendricks smoothest flows on this album, and that hook...ayy

**enecks** (10): Fuck that overrated BTS song, this is the album at its best - firey, furious, powerful.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): slaps

**robbiec\_** (10): Jim

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://imgur.com/vQgvDDy

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I feel like this could have been a smash radio hit if it wasn't for the very explicit (and iconic) hook. It's a smash hit in my heart tho.

**zamomattel** (10): a motherfucking HOOK

**chipsi1** (9.5): how about you slap me instead daddy

**preduxz** (9.3): smart, fun and more playful than i expect from kendrick

**Kaylaboe** (9): when are we adding kenny to the periodic table

**shineflyer** (9): "imma make it look sexy" is my life motto

**Death\_Soup** (8.8): the verses are absolute fire, but the hook is average

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the slowed down outro gives me chills

**lunasaflowers** (7.9): That chorus is just catchy as all hell.

**OriginalKappa** (7.5): I can see this is really well made and I should like it a lot but it has never clicked with me

**strawberryswing1** (7): I really hate the "make it look sexy" line

**1998tweety** (6.4): Wow the chorus is awful.

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): It's alright, the hook is annoying and all around feels autopiloty

**kappyko** (3): The entire song kind of sounds the same. his flows are cool but is that really enough to make up for Kid Capri shouting NEW KUNG FU KENNY every time you replay this. also the hook is ugly

Tyler created this song during the sessions for Kanye’s *The Life of Pablo* and offered the beat to both Kanye and Nicki Minaj on different occasions. Both of them ended up turning it down, but Tyler was able to use the beat on this energetic, unique single.

**chipsi1** (10): YAS

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): banger of the millennium this song fucking goes live

**dropthehammer11** (10): okay this fucking shit right here

**enecks** (10): I love love love weird bangers, and this is one. Beat of 2017 quite possibly.

**frogaranaman** (10): Me finishing this rate twenty four hours after its due.

**kappyko** (10): groove is in the heart mother FUCKERRRR. there's a point that sounds like the bridge to deathcamp so badass it's really creative sampling

**Kaylaboe** (10): busy king

**lunasaflowers** (10): My second favourite song on the album! I just fucking love the ENERGY of this song, you could honestly tap dance to this.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this beat, this delivery... the energy in this song is fucking unreal, the production, ughhhh.... everything is just so perfect. My #2 song of 2017.

**preduxz** (9.5): a banger, holy fuck

**1998tweety** (9.4): This goes off even harder than Who Dat Boy. The clapping is hype.

**robbiec\_** (9): a whole party

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I always forget how good this track is and then it comes on

**TragicKingdom1** (9): iconic sample, a certified bop...btw Shane Powers, who appears at the beginning of this song and also in Sometimes... is a top 20 Survivor contestant ever and everyone should stream Survivor: Panama on CBS All Access or Hulu today

**OriginalKappa** (8.5): Hopsin is shook

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): The hook is really the thing holding this track back, with the elongated syllables and Tyler’s inflection, but it works in a fun song like this. The production is of course very good and Tyler has a lot of personality.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the image of throwing watches/clocks is hilarious. I love the production too

**shineflyer** (8): the same sample as the very beginning of Groove is in the Heart?

**zamomattel** (8): A LIT SAMPLE I LIKE

And with that, Uzi is out of the rate. Going in, I think everyone expected “XO TOUR Llif3” to be Uzi’s last song standing. It was his breakthrough hit, a widely acclaimed moody trap banger that talks about depression, suicide, and heartbreak. “XO”’s journey in the rate was interesting to follow, with many people who harshly criticized *Luv is Rage 2* still making sure to give it high marks, allowing Uzi to escape the sad fate of Drake, who also lost most of his songs on the first day. “XO TOUR Llif3” reached as high as #5 before late scores and a few zeroes pushed it down almost out of the top ten. Despite everything, Uzi is still the first out, but at least he still got to Day 3. Eat that, Drake.

**awhile2** (11): this was undoubtedly my song of spring 2017. Literally listened to it everywhere I went and such a unique sound that still managed to gather huge mainstream appeal.

**CopyCatJ** (11): A classic.

**dropthehammer11** (11): this fucking song. SOTY 2017. perfect in every way.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): things this song is the peak of: Lil Uzi Vert's career; the trap genre; the year 2017; my existence; music as a whole; the human condition.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): FINALLY I MADE IT TO THE END AND GET TO ENJOY THIS BEAUTIFUL, SAD EMO BANGER. really tho, this song shlaps.

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Now how about that fucking closer. Oh my god this is maybe the most emotionally devastating trap song ever made, one of the few that captures the oddly euphoric feelings of desperate depression. The hook is so catchy and the beat so mesmerizingly dark that I couldn't keep this out of my head in 2017.

**Death\_Soup** (10): if Loyalty hadn't gotten my 11, this would've. legendary track, future classic for sure.

**enecks** (10): Somehow in this filler spam album is the song of the generation (either this or Closer). A wail of agony - this juxtaposes hedonism with depressing, crushing agony in an impressionist nightmare. This is a scream - the perfect representation of modern society's anxieties and realities.

**frogaranaman** (10): Suicide. 😍

**preduxz** (10): you either love this song or you lying also check out the brasstracks cover its dope af

**robbiec\_** (10): this is it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): shoutout to whoever sampled interstellar in this it’s wonderful

**zamomattel** (9): trash but fun trash

**kappyko** (8): it fucking BANGS but at the same time yall hype this like it's the second coming of rap he's just sad guys

**OriginalKappa** (8): Thank god for this song, like if it didn't exist Luv is Rage 2 would be one of the worst albums ever

**rotating3Dtext** (8): so damn emo

**1998tweety** (7.5): This album wouldn't actually be awful if you cut out like half of it and made it an EP.

**Kaylaboe** (7): a good song? i'd give this a 9 if it wasn't for that unfitting braggadocio in the second verse

**TragicKingdom1** (6): i've found this overrated since release. it's not BAD but his handling of the topic of depression is shaky at best and his vocals when he raises his voice are abysmal. plus i'm not a fan of the clicking riff throughout the song. i DO understand its appeal though, it is v catchy

**BenjaIsStupid** (5): More disappointing than anything. Production is good but he just starts talking about the regular shit instead of keeping with it through the whole song.

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: # Luv is Rage 2

---

**Overall average**: 6.304

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a DEEPLY flawed project. I've never been a fan of Lil Uzi Vert's whining on every song, and that's in full force here. The production is on average beyond generic and so is pretty much everything Uzi says. The only redeeming aspects are some admittedly catchy hooks and songs where guests bring in better production. If you skipped this rate because this album was included, I honestly can't blame you. [Grade: D]

**enecks**: This has 3 good tracks and the rest is bad filler. Still better than Views.

**Mudkip1**: this is literally just bad. i wanted to bash my head against a brick wall while struggling through this insulting epidemic. luv is rage 2 is a test in sanity. i have pity for all the hip hop lovers who abuse their ears while pretending to enjoy this absolute garbage fest of an album.

**jamesfog**: Well, just as I thought, TRASH.

**letsallpoo**: how nice of him to rate his own album in the title. jk this wasnt nearly as bad as i expected

**kappyko**: It's really not good and I don't know what I expected since it's been pretty trashed across the block. The highlights on this showcase his talent effectively but he's a step way behind all of the artists in this rate, including Kendrick.

**shineflyer**: There's so many good ideas here that get overshadowed by bad ideas.

**robbiec_**: I think I like the idea of Uzi more than anything like he has some absolute bops and so on but so much WASTE

When the tracklist to *DAMN.* was announced, this song had easily the most divided reactions. Just about nobody saw a U2 collaboration coming, and many were confused on what it could possibly sound like. The song, as it turns out, is one of the more political on the album. Kendrick raps almost in monotone about American hypocrisy over a wild Mike Will beat, before a transition into a slower extended outro featuring vocals from U2 frontman Bono. Bono’s vocals can also be found on the U2 song “American Soul” from their last album *Songs of Experience*, a song which features a short spoken word intro from Kendrick.

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): This song is great. It starts out with a hollow trap beat, and Kendrick sounds completely soulless. The absolute insanity, chaos, and darkness of the modern world has broken Kendrick’s spirit. Great song.

**chipsi1** (10): Endorsing XXXTentaclePorn again? cancelled 😤

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Remember when everyone was like "what the fuck??? u2????" and then this song was incredible

**Death\_Soup** (10): really underrated song

**dropthehammer11** (10): ngl when i first saw the feature i was like ew but this is a great fuckin song

**enecks** (10): FIREY BANGER OF BANGERS COP SIRENS AND FURY AND RIGHTEOUS ANGER

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I had no idea what to expect with a fucking U2 feature, but they kill it. This is possibly the weirdest song Kendrick has ever made, with an instrumental that is painfully dissonant, from off-kilter piano to sharp police sirens. It’s easily the most slept on track, and the way Kendrick just goes off is frankly almost scary.

**robbiec\_** (9.8): Can you remember how lots of blogs thought this wouldn’t work? And then it did lmao

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): honestly, this feature is amazing

**preduxz** (9.5): bangs in the whip and transitions really well into a U2 collab

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): making U2 relevant in 2017 is an achievement I didn't think even Kendrick could pull off. But he did that.

**Darkra01** (9): best song on the album dont @ me

**OriginalKappa** (9): Despite Bonos's best efforts to make me hate this (I don't hate U2 but it takes an effort to like them) this song rocks, has one of the best beats with a fantastic switch-up and a subject topic that doesn't get more gritty across the entire record

**sletrab07** (9): Kendrick literally brought in U2 as a feature to sample a song they didn't even release until the end of the year. Now THAT is impact!

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I honestly forgot about this song. THe middle section goes so hard that it should be a 10, but I feel like the U2 section onward drags it down a bit.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i love so many parts of this song but i wish it was more cohesive

**frogaranaman** (8.5): Minus the presence of U2, this is the blackest song on the album.

**kappyko** (8.5): The switch into "okay, kids, we're going to talk about gun control" is kind of hilarious to me does that make me a bad person? It's jarring and I think that's the point. He explores lyrical topics that are really intriguing, and Bono's chorus is decent. However, his flow in the latter half does feel kind of off to me.

**zamomattel** (8.5): lowkey U2’s best song

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Who would have though U2 would collab with Kendrick but yet here we are.

**1998tweety** (7.7): This also had some good bits.

**Raykel** (7.3): It's ok at the start but it gets good once the beat switches...but then it's just ok again

**shineflyer** (5): lots of classic sounds. switching to U2 is an odd choice but I actually like it better than the rest

When Vince dropped this single in early 2017, it wasn’t yet apparent what it was tied to. It still hit hard, a banger that takes aim at the one percent and Donald Trump. Its use in several trailers, among them the marketing for *Black Panther*, helped get the song a bit more attention.

---
**enecks** (10): This is the best track associated with Black Panther.

**kappyko** (10): hella!!!!

**Kaylaboe** (10): suck on my balls, i’ve had enough

**letsallpoo** (10): this is batshit crazy in the best way

**Mudkip1** (10): bop

**preduxz** (10): yea fuck donald trump this track bangs

**robbiec\_** (10): imo this slaps harder than Yeah

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): After all this time this song still goes so hard, goddamn

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this is what I wanted the whole album to be. (and it kinda is, but it just doesn't reach this level of energy.)

**OriginalKappa** (9.5): So close to being a 10, like this is a work of genius. B A N G E R

**PuggleMaster** (9): suck a dick 45

**chipsi1** (8.5): this is really energetic

**BenjaIsStupid** (8): Production has energy and the hook and pre chorus are great. Vince consistently spits some great bars. The 1% can suck a dick.

**zamomattel** (8): things vince did: that

**1998tweety** (7.3): This was also kind of okay.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): its alright, cool verses and beat and stuff

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: # #7: Tyler, the Creator - Who Dat Boy (feat. ASAP Rocky)

The lead single and (so far) only music video from the *Flower Boy* era. “Who Dat Boy” is an energetic banger that features a guest verse from ASAP Rocky, a recent frequently collaborator of Tyler’s. It was released at the end of a week of bee-themed countdown teasers via Tyler’s Twitter account. I also got to see Tyler and Rocky perform this live when I went to Tyler’s tour (Rocky was a surprise special guest), so I will always stan it.

---
**BenjaIsStupid** (10): The buzzing synth buildup is great and the bass heavy beat provides a great foundation for Tyler to shine. He’s very aggressive and Rocky flows well over the beat as well. The chorus is fun and catchy and the shared verse at the end keeps the song fresh as the production calms down a bit but still has a certain anxiety to it. Overall a great track.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): at first I though he said "who dat boy, who him ears"

**dropthehammer11** (10): goddamn this shit is amazing. beat goes nuts and the rocky feature smooth as butter

**enecks** (10): B A N G E R oh my god this just sizzles out of the headphones

**frogaranaman** (10): Every single time a guy on Grindr messages me, they have a big dick. I’m certain that the average sized penis of all the guys I’ve hooked up with has turned out to be 7”. And it’s not even guys lying about their size. Most of the time, they never tell me how big they are. I’m just like “Wow, you’re hot! Let me come over to fuck you,” then I show up and it’s revealed they I will be taking a big dick and I’m like, “Well, time to add another one to the list.”

**Kaylaboe** (10): i love how eerie this sounds

**preduxz** (10): ON GOD I CREAM MY PANTS EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO THE DROP

**robbiec\_** (10): this was probably my second favourite video of last year and also nearly my eleven omg it’s just so clever

**shineflyer** (10): this goes SO HARD. fuck a generic trap beat, do this shit with it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): the second I heard that beat drop for the first time I knew Tyler was about to serve us something special. I was right.

**chipsi1** (9): i was threatened

**kappyko** (9): the synths are batshit it feels like my ears are being invaded by bees

**OriginalKappa** (9): I feel like the only times I genuinely love this record is the hard hitting bangers and not the sensitive emotional tracks. Does that make me a bad person?

**TragicKingdom1** (9): so tense and creepy. rocky sounds great on this

**lunasaflowers** (8.7): At first, this song feels like a bit of an interruption to the mood, but overtime I've grown to appreciate it as a banger.

**1998tweety** (8.2): Okay this goes off HARD

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): WHO DAT BOY WHO HIM IS

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I really like this song but it really just doesn’t fit well on the tracklisting and in this album, honestly. It’s a serious slapper live though, will say that.

**zamomattel** (7.5): who he is

When Kendrick told other rappers that they had until April the 7th to get their shit together on “The Heart Part 4”, many speculated about an incoming album release. A week later, the electrifying “HUMBLE.” dropped as the album’s lead single alongside an instantly memorable video. The Mike Will Made It produced track mixes Kendrick’s brash, cocky lyrics with a pulsating piano instrumental. Incredibly, the song almost ended up on Mike Will’s *Ransom 2* album instead of *DAMN.*, with Kendrick having to be persuaded to keep it. I’m glad he did. “HUMBLE.” actually had a fairly interesting trajectory in the rate, with the song falling almost out of the top 30 for much of the month before a string of almost nonstop high scores brought it to almost the top 5.

---
**1998tweety** (10): No surprise that the song intended for the GP is the one I like the most. This is my obligatory 10 so I can get away with giving lower than average scores for the other tracks.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I've loved this song the second I heard the beat. Kendrick rapping over that piano is just so good.

**chipsi1** (10): right stroke put a melanie in a spiral

**Darkra01** (10): im so white i had no idea what a syrup sandwich was and i had to ask my black boyfriend at the time kjsdfnkdfsk

**dropthehammer11** (10): definitely the most unexpected single i've heard from kendrick. it's so simple, but so fun and catchy. a very nice change of pace from Kdot

**frogaranaman** (10): My left stroke also went viral, but I don’t think Tumblr masturbation videos is what he meant with that line.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): to put this in popheads terms, this song is a bop. This is definitely the most commercial Kendrick song out there, but it’s executed great and still has his own flair on it.

**Kaylaboe** (10): sis did that

**lunasaflowers** (10): Still an iconic banger full of iconic lines.

**Raykel** (10): And the music video is a 10 too

**robbiec\_** (10): can you believe?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I wasn’t so big on this when it dropped because of it being a more digestible track, but after careful consideration, I have realized I am profoundly stupid. HUMBLE. Is an oasis of quotables over one of the simplest yet infinitely hard beats of the last few years. Pair that with a catchy chorus and the best music video of 2017, and you have the surefire ingredients to make a hip hop smash that frankly deserves all the acclaim.

**zamomattel** (10): will this ever not bop

**preduxz** (9.5): a braggadocious banger, a thesis statement and a cultural phenomenon all at once

**BenjaIsStupid** (9): The production is great and Kendrick is great. Great song and deserved the chart success it got.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): banger

**Death\_Soup** (8.8): a future classic?

**shineflyer** (8.5): that piano line is so good, and the flow here is infectious

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): obviously iconic in many ways but i've never been able to get into this *that* much

**OriginalKappa** (8): Hype track, but it has kind of died on me. Like the lyrics are pretty terrible by Kendrick's standard and it is far from musical genius. I did love it once though so it gets an 8

**kappyko** (7.5): This song's release was a brilliant event and it still holds up as one of the most deservedly hyped tracks of the record. Interpolating 2000s hip hop trends into a modern brag rap track is just a really fun move. I'm beginning to think Kendrick should really stick to the heavy bangers and bops if he's going to go accessible.

**letsallpoo** (7): When this first I dropped I did enjoy it because it was a bawp but I always thought it was interesting how, for an artist known for his political music, his comeback's biggest political message was that...women shouldn't photoshop their ass stretch marks? idk it was weird. i don't find myself coming back to this song nearly as much nowadays

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): I remember thinking "this must be some kind of backseat freestyle joke" when this song dropped, it wasn't, he actually thought this was a good idea. Kendrick kendrick kendrick why. This beat is fucking dreadful

**enecks** (4): A banger with some iconic lines that I kinda hate because of a beat that's a little too basic and some grotesque misogyny. The repetition of bitch in the chorus makes me feel uncomfortable.

The second part of the double first single Tyler released for *Flower Boy*, the final song came at the end of numerous reworks. In the end, the song features Frank Ocean (once again) and Steve Lacy (who also appeared on *DAMN.*) This is the first of three songs in the top ten that occupied the number-one spot at one point, taking hold in the early days of April before slipping down to its final position.

**vodkainsipido** (11): hey look everyone it’s the best hip-hop song of 2017 [](#annie)

---
**chipsi1** (11): THE TRANSITION UGH

**BenjaIsStupid** (10): The grooves on this track are great and the hook is one of the most memorable. The beat switch is great and the intro vocals to the second part of the track is a part that sticks with you upon first listen. Overall great song.

**enecks** (10): This is a song that makes me bop my head to the side.

**frogaranaman** (10): One time I called 911 and asked them out on a date and the operator told me to fuck off.

**kappyko** (10): i cant believe tyler combined art and pop and rap and honey and rnb and the louvre and culture and people and humanity and love and God and all the beautiful in the world into this Art Pop masterpiece

**Kaylaboe** (10): this guitar :despair: :despair: :despair:

**lunasaflowers** (10): I have been very, very lonely for a long time, and sometimes it can be really really deeply suffocating, so this song is just...so relatable. I feel ya hard, Tyler-- I can't even lie, I'vebeen lonely as fuck. :(

**preduxz** (10): Tyler the only dude to make me cry while I bounce from side to side with my hands up in a shuffling motion

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): that Mr. Lonely part is just a little too real lol. also Garden Shed to 911 is perhaps the best 4-song run in any album ever.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): I slightly prefer the first part with frank but yknow what this is all so good

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I felt that tbh. Yay for being lonely.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): hotline bling is shaking

**1998tweety** (8.9): Starts chill then goes off

**rotating3Dtext** (8): "i can't even lie, i've been lonely as fuck" oh no this song is relatable

The lead single for *Big Fish Theory* is a G-Funk banger using frequent wordplay based in marine life. Juicy J provides uncredited vocals on the song’s hook.

---
**sletrab07** (11): This was a cruel rate for my 11. I nearly didn't give it out because it didn't feel right. In my eyes, Big Fish, Boredom and LOVE. are 11s. So I'm giving it to Big Fish in the hope that Vince can score a top 5 finish. Side note: I will never ever get over how good "Mix the holy water with the Voss" is as a line.

**chipsi1** (10): Should've been a hit

**dropthehammer11** (10): vince’s best song easy. goddamn so funky

**enecks** (10): An optimistic catchy song - with a marketing push this could've been a huge hit! It has Juicy J, a beat that sounds like My N**** but good, and an amazingly catchy hook.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The production is so good on this song, and I love the bubbly water sound of it, which I guess kind of relates to fish? Vince’s sounds great too.

**Kaylaboe** (10): i love the second verse on this one. maybe the best one he’s done. also i had no idea Voss water was a thing outside of Norway

**Mudkip1** (10): bop

**preduxz** (10): bubbly in the best kind of way

**shineflyer** (10): this is how i like my bangers - clever, yet still as stupid as you need it to be

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I WAS UP LATE NIGHT WORKING ON MY CONCEPTUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CRITIQUE ART HISTORY IN THE SIXTIES ESSAY AND ALSO BALLIN

**1998tweety** (9.6): I already like this album more than the other 3.

**zamomattel** (9.5): if this isn’t in the next gta game ill be shook

**BenjaIsStupid** (9): Vince does a great job on this track and the production is pretty good and unique, but the hook is what really makes this track stand out.

**OriginalKappa** (9): Kind of wanted to give this my 11 not going to lie, that hook is so banging

**TragicKingdom1** (9): a banger with a lot of memorable lines

**lunasaflowers** (8.7): This is probably one of the most accessible songs of the album, it's fun.

**kappyko** (8.5): gotchu. this is the real intro to the album tbh, juicy j provides an infectious hook and vince provides an excellent performance over great aquatic production and everything just goes right

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): banger

**awhile2** (8): “sharks make me want to put a hammer to my head” love this song but this line bugs me so much cause vince likes to call everything corny but this bar is corny af

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Shit BUMPS

**robbiec\_** (7.9): the bass is a bit irritating on earphones but like HUMBLE. this song is supposed to be rattling cars also that Juicy J sample is seamless

**letsallpoo** (7): I was pretty whelmed when this first dropped. It felt too much like a continuation of Summertime 06 (lyrical references aside) which wasn't super interesting to me for a comeback. I love the fakeout fadeout tho

My favorite song in the entire rate and my favorite song of 2017 is Tyler’s final track out. Sadly, it never hit #1 at any point throughout the month. A beautiful love song with featured vocals from the immensely talented and wonderful Kali Uchis, “See You Again” has Tyler proclaim his love to a unnamed individual (presumably the man who requested “the one about me” in the previous skit) whom he only sees in his dreams. In a tweet, Tyler revealed he had initially intended to give the song to Zayn Malik, but kept it after Zayn skipped out on studio time.

---
**Brendon-Urine** (11): Don't know what to say besides that this song is perfect. Kali's vocal melody is so beautiful. Tyler is better than ever on this track.

**ClocktowerMaria** (11): Oh my god this is the most perfect song ever made, everything about it is just, to beautiful to even think about like I cannot believe this song exists. The lyrics are amazing, the singing is great, the beat is stunning and Kali adds so much with such a small feature. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHP76Ui-Egc watch this if you haven't

**kappyko** (11): absolutely longing

**Kaylaboe** (11): okokokokokokok? this track is amazingamazingamazingamazing. remember to buy flower boy and isolation on your platform of choice. also this performance is precious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHP76Ui-Egc

**lunasaflowers** (11): This song is just so gorgeous and romantic, it gives me so many warm feelings. Kali is great on the hook and I just love the beautiful production and all the little moments of this.

**shineflyer** (11): much better than okay okay okay okay dokay

**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Beautifully sung and produced, See You Again is a clear standout on Flower Boy. Kali Uchis does a great job on the hook and the way the bass comes in for the first verse is one of the best moments on the project. The production is detailed and is generally great.

**chipsi1** (10): Charlie Puth? What even is it? nobody knows.

**CopyCatJ** (10): I love Kali

**frogaranaman** (10): @boyfriend :honk:

**sletrab07** (10): In an album with a lot of complexity in its structure, prose and thematic elements, sometimes the most straightforward songs can be the best. It's so with "See You Again", which is essentially a love song. Part of the appeal probably stems from the sincerity. It's so much fun to hear Tyler growl and fume over tracks like "I Ain't Got Time", but it's humanising to see him wax poetic about a lover.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): OKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOK

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): seeing this live was life changing

**robbiec\_** (9.5): this song is emotional chaos, the lyrics are gorgeous and Kali sounds GORGEOUS

**preduxz** (9.4): really wonderful work from Tyler, this is when I realized he really has matured

**Death\_Soup** (9): Kali's chorus is the best part

**enecks** (9): A sugary colourful tragedy that just hits me in the guts. Maybe a little too sweet?

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This is a sweet song, and Kali’s voice fits in right with the production. I’m not sure if Tyler fits in as well, but it’s still really nice, albeit a little short.

**1998tweety** (8.7): This song has Kali on it so I expect it'll be my fav on the album.

**dropthehammer11** (8): ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this song is a bit overrated even though i really only have one problem with it: the chorus. i don't find it memorable! and i find that to be kind of important considering it's supposed to be a sweet love song. everything else about it is pretty good though

**Raykel** (7.5): They're like peanut butter and jelly

**zamomattel** (7): a solid tune, and she has a nice voice

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: # Flower Boy

---

**Overall average**: 7.848

---

**TragicKingdom1**: My general impression of this album is if Tyler the Creator rapped over Frank Ocean production. That's not a bad thing at all, I think it really works in a lot of instances and I can vibe with it (unlike Cherry Bomb, which I didn't get into). Tyler also brings some bangers like Who Dat Boy and I Ain't Got Time to keep up the momentum of the album. However, Tyler runs into the same issue that Frank does sometimes in that he's too reliant on ambient production which creates moments of slight boredom. I still recommend this to anyone who needs slightly more optimistic material for sad redacted hours :pensive: [Grade: B+]

**shineflyer**: Tyler's able to nail chill songs and bangers, and that's what I look for.

**chipsi1**: Flower Boy is probably one of my favorite rap albums, I forgot about it for a pretty long while so I stopped listening to it, which was a huge mistake. this album is pretty mindblowingly good and it's his best project by far.

**enecks**: This is the best album in this rate EZ. Smooth, relatable, tragic.

**Mudkip1**: this album is fucking boring

**kappyko**: I don't expect the rest of his albums to sound like this, but it doesn't matter because I could really just listen to this by itself forever. Infectious jazz groove and electronic mellow vibes underlie some of the best pop rap hooks in a long time, and some of the most creative and inspiring melodies. Tyler has such a special artistic voice that he uses to amazing effect. I haven't heard a record so cinematic and musically lush in forever.

Going into this rate, I had no idea how this song would end up doing. It’s loud, clashing, experimental, and choatic. But to my surprise, not only did “Yeah Right” stick around near the top for the entire submission period, it took the top spot for a while and outlasted Tyler. While some late scores took it down to #2, the song’s crazy sound definitely worked for most of the raters. It’s another wild mix of artists, with Vince, SOPHiE, electronic producer Flume, Kendrick Lamar, and singer Kučka all contributing to the track.

---
**enecks** (11): This is the best thing Kendrick did in 2017. A collab of SOPHIE, Flume, Kendrick Lamar, and Vince Staples was either going to suck or be a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece.

**Mudkip1** (11): the biggest bop ever i love sophie

**robbiec\_** (11): it has been harder to truly shake me in recent years but this song fucking shook ME TO THE CORE. No one is wasted on here. Kendrick has 5 FLOWS. Flume and Kûcka as a bridge is a CHOICE. SOPHIE is SOPHIE

**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Beat is probably the best with the giant bass and weird percussion. Hook is great even if it is repetitive. Vince’s verses are great but Kendrick just comes in and murders the track. He’s not credited as a feature (at least not on Spotify) so it comes as a great surprise on first listen. I love this song.

**chipsi1** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): HOLY FUCKING SHIT SOPHIE X VINCE X KENDRICK with that beat and the Kendrick verse and THAT BEAT it bangs so unbelievably hard it can break your speakers and it's fucking worth it. This is such a dream come true I cannot believe such a song exists

**foxxglove\_** (10): Vince SNAPPED. Kendrick SNAPPED. Sophie SNAPPED. Hell Kucka snapped and she sounds like she whispering.

**frogaranaman** (10): When that beat switches.. you know a bitch is gay.

**Kaylaboe** (10): this production goes off! bubblegum bass mixed with hiphop: and it’s amazing. kendrick delivers too. and sophie. and flume.

**preduxz** (10): good goddamn

**shineflyer** (10): Help. I have been unable to stop saying boy yeah right yeah right yeah right (boy yeah right yeah right yeah right) since I heard this. SOPHIE doing really good work on this one. Kendrick killing it on this harder than on his own album imo.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song perfectly encopasses the good parts of this album. It's got really cool electronic production, and great rapping from both Vince and Kendrick.

**strawberryswing1** (10): omgggggg it's kendrick!!!1 *entire HHH sub cums*

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Vince, Kendrick Lamar, Kücka, SOPHIE, Flume. This is like the perfect collaboration if someone asked me to list the wildest group of artists, and here we are.

**zamomattel** (10): the straight I got it

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Boi yeah right Boi yeah right Boi yeah right Boi Yeah right this slaps. Also the surprise Kendrick verse is nice.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): what can I say other than 'it slaps' and 'they snapped'?

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): the production and kendrick are iconic

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Holy fuck this bangs

**kappyko** (9): sophie queenie i feel like this is either gonna get robbed hard or end up top 3 somehow. give smoke and retribution your 11s in my electronic producer rate

**letsallpoo** (9): I think I would appreciate the instrumental more if it didn't sound so similar to the songs Sophie released afterwards. Still goes awf tho

**dropthehammer11** (8): kendrick fuck me up

**rotating3Dtext** (8): ok this just got elevated when kendrick showed up. also that's sophie right there.

**1998tweety** (7.6): I'm actually kind of digging this industrial metallic beat, but the chorus is just so repetitive.

**lunasaflowers** (7.2): This song is VEEEEEEERY SOPHIE. With this album's themes, I can see why Kendrick is here, but I wish his verse here did more for me. I feel like this'll grow on me tho.

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: # Big Fish Theory

---

**Overall average**: 7.729

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a cute package of experimental hip hop. I found it very easy to vibe with late at night, mainly because of the production which is consistently excellent. Vince oozes charisma even if sometimes his verses feel a bit light in content. My only issue really is how it feels a little imbalanced in terms of points of high tension and lower tension; sacrificing some of the ambient moments in favor of building to stronger climaxes would really elevate the project. [Grade: B+]

**shineflyer**: This album is either background music or straight up bangers, no in-between.

**enecks**: I realised I don't like this as an album, just the best tracks. Oh well, it's good stuff to add to a playlist.

**Mudkip1**: this is the best album ever created. god was smiling down on vince the day this released because he knew the world was better off afterwards

**letsallpoo**: After Summertime '06 and this, I'm pretty sure Vince is my favorite rapper nowadays. I love this album - wacky pop instrumentals combined with rapid, abrasive lyricism is such a good formula

**kappyko**: somebody once told me the choruses to this album were all the same line repeated and i was unable to get over this fact. however, vince provides very great production; on most songs, however, he phones in interesting songwriting. the exceptions are the singles (minus Rain Come Down), Love Can Be, and Yeah Right. this could've been a great EP.

**robbiec_**: I love this album for what it is outside of all the meaning that Vince or blogs steeped it in that wasn’t really there but although I would have liked the album to be fully immersed in the dance music I love this album for bending rap music towards it and Vince still being one of the best rappers alive

**1998tweety**: One of the things I didn't like about the other 3 albums is that to a casual listener like myself, a lot of the songs sound similar, but this is not the case at all with this album. Everything sounds so different.

We have our winner! “DNA.” was probably the frontrunner from the beginning, but it was far from an easy ride. Both “911 / Mr. Lonely” and “Yeah Right” had turns in the top spot, but in the end, the total lack of controversy for “DNA.” was too hard to overcome. It’s for good reason, too. The song is a menacing banger, with the excellent first two-thirds leading up to the electrifying final minute. The beat switches, and Kendrick’s flow speeds up to insane levels. It’s an incredible, raw showcase of Kendrick’s skills as a rapper, and an immediate fan favorite for a reason.

---
**OriginalKappa** (11): What else could be deserving of this? probably the best song of 2017

**preduxz** (11): furious and fully realized controlled chaos, this is what mike will was born to do

**Raykel** (11): Like the song isn't already amazing, the second verse was recorded a capella and Mike Will Made It produced around it. They struck magic with this.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I ran a marathon last year and I think I listned to thios song on every single training run leading up to it. This song just goes so hard, and it's propbably the best banger of 2017 to me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): THE song of 2017. When DAMN. dropped, this was playing in every car, out of every storefront, and in every pair of headphones. It’s not even that accessible, it’s 3 minutes of uninterrupted bars, one of Kendrick’s strongest vocal performances ever. The beat is just absolutely bonkers, and that’s not even getting to the second half, which has to countdown to prepare you for just how much shit goes down, and I remember getting chills when it first hit my ears. The way the vocal sample just keeps looping and the way Kendrick just snaps makes this an instant classic. And, yes, he can perform it live, and he does it flawlessly. Every listen is just another bout of continued amazement. Not only is it the best hip hop song of 2017, it’s the best song of 2017, period.

**awhile2** (10): any song that mentions jellyfish is an instant 10 from me

**BenjaIsStupid** (10): Hard-hitting. The beat switch is absolute insanity and Kendrick flows his ass off. Great way to start the album.

**chipsi1** (10): !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Imagine being able to open an album this fucking well

**dropthehammer11** (10): holy fucking shit what a song. easily one of kendrick's best and the best song on this album. production literally blows my goddamn nutsack off

**frogaranaman** (10): Reminds me of when T’challa drinks that lean shit and visits the spirit world.

**fuckupsomecommasyeah** (10): yeehaw

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourites from the album. The beat switch is iconic, and Kendrick has a such a good flow on the song.

**Kaylaboe** (10): this just slaps. move away genealogists

**robbiec\_** (10): So I was takin’ a walk the other day, And I seen a man - a crip, Pacin’ up and down the sidewalk, He seemed to be a bit frustrated, As if he had dropped something and having a hard time finding it, So after watching him struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand you know? “Hello 3 time AOTY Grammy nominee, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something I would like to help you find it” He replied: “Oh yes, you have lost something... You’ve lost… YOUR WIG”.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): simply one of the best pure hip hop songs released this decade. the bars, the flow, the beat switch, everything just works so well together.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the beat switch makes me nut every time

**vodkainsipido** (10): i remember listening to this when it leaked and had to find a free wi-fi spot in a beach at like 11pm and i listened to blood and then this and i was like ‘BITCH WHAT THE FUCK’ then i stopped listening because my friend was asking me what i was actually doing, later that night i’d tell him that i was gay and that’s why this song is attached to my memories FOREVER

**ZachArch18** (10): GIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMME

**zamomattel** (10): watson & crick would be proud

**lunasaflowers** (9.3): Hot take: I like the song better before the beat switch-up, but it's still awesome, and it BANGS.

**Death\_Soup** (9.1): 3 minutes and 6 seconds of pure fire. Kendrick fucking snapped

**Brendon-Urine** (9): The beat switch makes this song. Just amazing.

**Darkra01** (9): beat-switch iconic af

**enecks** (8): It's good but I feel I like it more in theory than in practice. Technical skill doesn't make an automatic 11 - otherwise tripe like Rap God would be 11 worthy. The beat's a little laggy, and the lyrics a little too scattershot.

**shineflyer** (8): that beat switch-up goes in

**1998tweety** (7.6): Little Mix and BTS both did it better.

**kappyko** (6.5): it still bangs. beat is cool. beat switch still gr8. is it just me or does this song not conclude really gratifyingly?

**TragicKingdom1**: I was not let down whatsoever by this album. Kendrick continues his streak of being the most engaging rapper in the game; there isn't a single verse on this album where I'm not vibing with what he's saying, even if it's not always super profound lyrically. In addition, the production on this project is immaculate, with songs ranging every emotion. This album does drag slightly in the beginning (in between DNA and Loyalty) but this is an amazing project that I would recommend to anyone. [Grade: A]

**shineflyer**: I'm not as into this one as most. that being said it's great

**chipsi1**: DAMN. is an album that lets Kendrick flaunt his storytelling skills with a pretty accessible tone, and it actually works for him. my least favorite tracks on here are the ones that arguably sound more TPAB than others, he's actually very good at pop rap.

**enecks**: A deeply flawed album with some flat out bad tracks that got hype from being more accessible to radio than To Pimp A Butterfly.

**Mudkip1**: this album is a lot worse than i remembered

**kappyko**: With *DAMN.*, for the first time, Kendrick wasn't the savior of rap, or the songwriter of the decade; he became a mortal man (ha, get it?). He loses the deep narratives that encompassed *To Pimp a Butterfly* and *good kid, m.A.A.d city*; instead, he places a strange intro to the beginning that has no relevance(?) to the rest of the record except to set some sort of concept that the hip hop kids can go crazy about. The musical content is nowhere near the nostalgic, atmospheric production of GKMC or the Afro-centric, grand sound of *To Pimp a Butterfly*; instead, he tries his hand at a pop album with woozy beats that unfortunately feel absolutely colorless. His voice often sounds just awkward when juxtaposed with the beats, and one can't help but feel this is him phoning it in. A mediocre Kendrick album wouldn't be a good album if it were made by anybody else; it would be a mediocre album that isn't successful. I'm gonna sound pretentious but there is really very little that makes this album special or unique or particularly memorable. There is very little heart or soul in this record. In one sentence: Is this Kendrick's lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to

**lunasaflowers**: GKMC and TPAB are obviously better, but I think there's still a lot to like about this album.

**robbiec_**: we stan
