I've been more into the Tame Impala remix of this but this rate has made me realize this version is just as good! Love the rattling production and it also features some of the most authentic 80s synths I've heard in an era that's dominated by that throwback sound. Submitted by /u/fishingfor8.

---

**fishingfor8** (11): obviously gonna give my own submission my 11. This song was one of my favorite releases of 2020 and should be a lifelong favorite. The way the chorus comes crashing in with a little synth run and the relief of 'oh I don't have to take the blame for ruining this relationship bye' is really neat

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why have I never heard this before, it‚Äôs so good.

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok, now hold on a minute this is kind of a hit.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This captures the ache of betrayal, melancholy regret and resignation and it destroys me. Who knows how well the 80s synth waves trend will age, but this hits everytime and feels ungimmicky. I bet on it being a timeless cut.

**TiltControls** (10): probably my favourite new discovery of the rate

**wavingwolves** (10): this is just too good

**wryn\_** (10): this was literally one of the best songs of 2020 and nobody cared. lesbian oppression

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Shimmery, sad bop

**akanewasright** (9): This is amazing WTF

**CarlieScion** (9): bop!!!! also gay!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Slaps!

**plastichaxan** (9): i listened to modus vivendi twice and unfortunately it didn't click with me, but this song was an immediate stand out and a really really great one

**skargardin** (9): this makes me feel like im floating through space

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I first heard 070 Shake on on Kanye's album in '18. I was eagaer for this album last year, and it was pretty good. I hope this makes it farther than anyone thinks it will.

**timothy444** (9): Just listening to this and it gives me major Post Malone Sunflower vibes. Like, a female version of it.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The chorus is so sticky, definitely one I want to come back to relisten.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): im weak to every single

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): vibes... beautiful vibes...

**sirpancakeXI** (8.3): the first half the song is kinda meh but it get better and better as the song proceed

**Roxieloxie** (8.1): Chill way to start the rate, i can fuck with it

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): I enjoyed this. Added the rest of the album for later listening.

**camerinian** (8): God I just love 070 Shake's voice

**frogaranaman** (8): what is anyone even doing up at 5am wtf

**ignitethephoenix** (8): really like the blend of genres here production wise. Also love the story of the song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this sounds nice, but i don‚Äôt like the vocals

**starlitsuns** (8): me listening to anything Dr. Luke produced pre-Ke$ha callout

**waluigiest** (8): it reminds me a bit of Sunflower

**bbfan132** (7.5): production is nice, song leaves a bit to be desired but it‚Äôs good

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): It's pretty good but the vocals are super repetitive and it gets a little annoying

**runaway3212** (7.5): I liked this at the start but it drags a bit

**Stryxen** (7.5): I‚Äôll probably cry to this eventually and it will grow on me but as it is it‚Äôs good!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.3): Guilty! Con science

**anothertown** (7): I thought this was just alright.. will check out the album though

**fallenriot** (7): super vibey and nice!

**intheaftermath** (7): this was cute! not really my speed but I enjoyed the vocals

**SRTviper** (7): I like when an artist sounds like they are about to cry on a song.

**1998tweety** (6): Production is nice, don't care for the voice

**cremeebrulee** (6): idk if people set my expectations too high for this song but its just ok to me :/ i like the chorus but the verses kind of drag for me

**fadedblue09** (6): That is certainly a way to pronounce "conscience".

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This isn‚Äôt bad but I‚Äôve never been a fan of this kind of heavily produced sound with highly processed vocals and an overall ‚Äúartificial‚Äù aesthetic.

**vayyiqra** (6): Nice instrumental but I didn't care for the vocals

**2dina3dworld** (5): this sounds like it was made for the sole purpose of Tik Tok

**linothy** (2): what's joe biden's plan to remove this song from the internet it sounded Strange

Submitted by /u/skargardin, which is unsurprising considering it fits right in with the sophistipop/glittery disco of the rate he's hosting in March! I don't think this is the pinnacle of that genre but it's a cute, fun slice of it.

---

**akanewasright** (10): This is a bop wow

**fishingfor8** (10): the intro gave me the chills

**ManofOranges** (10): NOTHING CAN COMPARE WITH THIS SONG!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Somebody played this as an interlude in plug during a rate once, and it's been a permanent fixture in my playlist since. This is an INCREDIBLE disco-lite bop! If Dua released this y'all would be all over it, so this better make Day 3!

**ReallyCreative** (10): a fantastic discovery from this rate, absolutely fantastic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Sounds like a classic pop/soul track and Agnes has a fantastic voice!

**skargardin** (10): I'm not going to give my own submission an 11, but it is tempting

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a real bop and one of the best songs I've found from this rate

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): oh she kinda snapped

**1998tweety** (9): omg this is a huge bop wtf

**cremeebrulee** (9): one of my favorite discoveries from this rate for sure!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): wow I love the vibes on here. It‚Äôs so groovy and it‚Äôs definitely one of my fav discoveries

**intheaftermath** (9): this song made me daydream that I was in some music video with cool, windy visuals. it was beautiful, much like the synths

**pat-rickstar** (9): Agnes really dropped "Release Me" and then disappeared, huh? This is nice, though, I like the instrumental

**sarcasticsobs** (9): hooked within 2 seconds, i was

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this song is what future nostalgia would sound like in an alternate dimension where it was actually good

**Yatcho** (9): did every white euro girl release a disco banger last year??

**sirpancakeXI** (8.8): The high pitch voice is not really my thing but it is not that bad either, otherwise a pretty solid song

**JunkyGS** (8.5): never heard this before, but bop bop bop!

**Mysario** (8.5): nothing can compare to Agnes all along

**sandyfishnets** (8.5): nothing compares to youuuuuuuuuuu

**Stryxen** (8.2): not sure why i expected this to sound like the sinead o‚Äô connor song

**brenda\_official** (8): idk who this girl is but this bops

**FKJVMMP** (8): Woman with synths and an 80s aesthetic? That‚Äôs a day 3 song for sure.

**hikkaru** (8): a cute bop

**nooodisaster** (8): Bombast and euphoric, with a timeless quality.

**runaway3212** (8): This sounds really good!

**steelstepladder** (8): It's so Lush! But it really makes me want to go listen to Latch

**wryn\_** (8): so unexpectedly great! wish i had heard this before the rate!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): Yoo-hoo

**camerinian** (7.5): Ok this is a bop

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): fine enough

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Come through synth

**astrologicalangel** (7): this singer's voice is so damn powerful

**bbfan132** (7): the cover is cool and the song is fun!

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Skar ily, but why did you choose the worst track from the EP üò≠

**fallenriot** (7): I wish it built more but the mini-bridge was nice

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good

**timothy444** (7): Nothing too noteworthy but it is listenable

**SRTviper** (6.8): The 80s worship is fully unrestricted

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): I only know her from ‚ÄúRelease Me‚Äù so it‚Äôs nice to see she‚Äôs still making music.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Nothing against this song in particular but I‚Äôm getting tired of people going like ‚Äúomg you‚Äôll probably love this!‚Äù and then when I click the link it‚Äôs a white woman doing synthpop that sounds exactly like this.

**linothy** (6.5): kinda fun bro, might add to my main playlist, not bad :]

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This would be good Forever 21 music

**2dina3dworld** (6): this sounds like something that would play in a Glassons

**bulforster** (6): This is just Latch but blander.

**CarlieScion** (6): this was okay but for some reason i expected this to be the sinead o conner song

**wavingwolves** (6): cute

**anothertown** (5): something about this is just not working, it's got all the pieces put together but they are not fitting right..

**fadedblue09** (5): Run of the mill Swedish pop.

**kappyko** (5): the bridge is cool but i've known this song for a long time and it's worn off me

Chaotic and fun and doesn't drag. I'm not a fan of most VGM but this hits the spot as an occasional listen outside of that context. Submitted by /u/runaway3212.

---

**bigbigbee** (11): Bless you, submitter. I fucking LOVE this song. The whole Undertale soundtrack is great but this was absolutely the right choice (give or take a Hopes and Dreams) ‚Äì the way it builds, the way the A and B melodies play with each other‚Ä¶UGH! Perfect. Yes, this 11 is heavily colored by the fact that I played the game and it made me cry big baby tears. Yes, this song would still bang even if I hadn‚Äôt.

**intheaftermath** (11): words cannot express how much this song means to me. Undertale was a huge staple of my middle school experience and absolutely dominated my YouTube playlists. Every part about this song is so clever, especially how it fuses the CORE theme and Mettaton's earlier themes. It's absolutely magical, and no matter the cover, it sounds gorgeous. popheads plz let this win

**runaway3212** (11): Okay so this is my submission and maybe it's tacky to give your own submission an 11 but I just really like it. Also I'm sorry to all the people that wanted to rate Let's Go To The Mall, I changed it and didn't want to change it back, but I'd be happy to rate it if somebody submits it next charity rate (though I will not be that person)

**1998tweety** (10): iconix

**akanewasright** (10): GOD I hope you little fucking bitches let this song do well. It deserves top 10

**CarlieScion** (10): we should all aspire to be as in love with ourselves as Mettaton is

**celladonn** (10): Main pop boy Mettaton

**cremeebrulee** (10): [STALE TOPIC] WE WANT THE VIDEO GAME RATE!!!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Weddings, funerals, quiz shows.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Toby Fox is a LEGEND; solely developed one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time AND wrote one of the most iconic game scores ever?? Your fav could never

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Uh oh! I‚Äôm reverting back to my high school obsessions!

**musical\_pyn** (10): toby fox can do no wrong

**Mysario** (10): the Undertale soundtrack is just bop after bop

**pheromenos** (10): this is good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The REAL best song in Undertale, we stan unproblematic fave Mettaton!

**ReallyCreative** (10): OH YES....

**rotating3Dtext** (10): video game songs rate when

**Roxieloxie** (10): Gamers Rise Up

**seanderlust** (10): main pop girl toby fox

**starlitsuns** (10): fun fact: Undertale music isn‚Äôt plagued by DMCA so you can tell your favourite twitch streamers to turn off the nintendo playlists (which are also for whatever reason not plagued by DMCA) and bop to the Undertale soundtrack instead

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Oh yesss

**Stryxen** (10): TEN BOP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if we were rating the entire undertale soundtrack as a whole this would be my 11

**timothy444** (10): Whoever submitted this has an excellent taste in video game music

**wavingwolves** (10): video game rate when

**steelstepladder** (9.5): I prefer other Undertale songs but when that synth comes in during the back half I'm in love

**Yatcho** (9.5): okay this bops really fucking hard, tf?

**2dina3dworld** (9): I have never played Undertale, however, I listen to the soundtrack religiously.

**camerinian** (9): If I ever achieve in my lifetime just a 100th of what Toby Fox did on Undertale I think I could die satisfied

**chihuahuazero** (9): If I rated this any lower, my little brother will give me grief.

**SRTviper** (9): K. K. is seething

**vayyiqra** (9): Idk how much we needed to rate Toby Fox but it still bops

**waluigiest** (9): yes I am gay

**TheEvilNightman** (8.6): I need to play Undertale someday.

**bbfan132** (8): pleasant track!! i should play undertale soon

**frogaranaman** (8): this is the closest we‚Äôll ever get to a video game rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): memories‚Ä¶

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Cause of death? Glamour

**nooodisaster** (8): A huge bop, this is how you make 2 minute tracks Tik Tok stars!!

**sandyfishnets** (8): I never got into this game but this is still a bop

**skargardin** (8): I need to get to playing Undertale already..

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Some parts are really catchy but other parts also annoy me a bit.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I don‚Äôt know what that means

**hikkaru** (7): i still haven't played undertale my flop but this bops

**kirby31200** (7): Not nearly as good as Megalovania and Spider Dance

**SmileAndTears** (6): WHERE ARE THE VOKELLS???

**Tolk1en** (6): didn't age well

Yola was a giant breath of fresh air when I first heard her back in 2018. And I mean that in two ways: her music really evokes an outdoor Americana, and it has true soul unlike most popular country music. Hopefully her starring role in the upcoming Elvis biopic will lead to her breakthrough in places other than the Grammys. Submitted by /u/ImADudeDuh.

---

**fallenriot** (11): she calls herself the queen of country soul for a reason, cause she‚Äôs the MF QUEEN

**SmileAndTears** (11): BITCH THIS IS SO GOOD? HOW COME I'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT HER?

**1998tweety** (10): excellence

**fadedblue09** (10): I've been wanting to get into her music for a while now, and this song is enough to convince me I should.

**Flegasaurus** (10): wow wow idk what to say its so nice

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yola is the motherfucking QUEEN!! I would‚Äôve kept Patti Labelle - Lady Marmalade as my original pick, but something with this song just hit better during the lead up to the charity rate and I wanted more people to hear this more. Probably now my favorite song of hers as I can relate to driving down the countryside to just be free as I literally do that even this past week. My goal is for this to make it past day 1 at least and people won‚Äôt just immediately go ‚ÄúBORING!!!!!!!!‚Äù and drop a 5 on it.

**intheaftermath** (10): Words can't describe how much I usually hate country music but this was stunning. Yola's voice is just so rich and gorgeous and suits the guitar so well

**NFLfreak98** (10): So if black women make country songs like this remind me why we allow so many white men to make the same exact song for decades now?

**ReallyCreative** (10): I know Yola from her song with The Highwomen but this is absolutely enough to make me a fan, just gorgeous, soulful, country excellence

**runaway3212** (10): BOP!!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I‚Äôve been meaning to listen to more Black country and this is an amazing track

**wavingwolves** (10): a flawless song

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.5): ugh gorgeous

**CarlieScion** (9): country queen

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song feels like a warm summer day and i love that

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): oh no my latent Texan genes are activating

**nooodisaster** (9): Dammmnnn, these vocals!!! They're so resonant and clear and the production just lets them totally go to the forefront. I can totally feel the emotion; it's like I'm front seat at her concert.

**rickikardashian** (9): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/750179199536463954/814574151276298240/boobs_closer_5.gif

**steelstepladder** (9): Yee haw

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): funny how the only good country music is the ones made by women huh

**waluigiest** (9): my longest yeehaw ever

**seanderlust** (8.9): can't relate, am a city slicker

**bbfan132** (8.5): love the old school country soul sound!!!

**camerinian** (8.5): Ride Out In The Country, Gonna Eat A Lot Of Peaches

**jsonphile** (8.5): I have no idea who this is but I am digging it. Great song to end the playlist on (no I am NOT counting a 63 minute metal track)

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Thank you, whomever submitted this, for reminding me I need to get into Yola

**Yatcho** (8.5): you know what maybe I do like country when it's not about beer and trucks

**Stryxen** (8.1): now hold on why do i love this

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This is such sweet little bop

**akanewasright** (8): Pretty solid

**kirby31200** (8): yeehaw

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): Oh wow a country song I actually like

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): country music isn‚Äôt my thing but her voice is great and I love seeing black women in country music!

**2dina3dworld** (7): Yola's voice is so soothing, wth.

**anothertown** (7): ohh it's nice

**kappyko** (7): the rest of the album is great

**skargardin** (7): this was really pleasant, def want to check out more of their stuff

**SRTviper** (7): I am very relaxed.

**timothy444** (7): Alright country song

**starlitsuns** (6): this is good it just doesn't do anything to me, a person who lives in what is considered a rural county in the South U.S., because I don't want to be here

**vayyiqra** (6): Not bad for yeehaw music

**linothy** (4): bro she's taking a ride out in the country bro

I'm not sure I ever listened to this in full before this rate. I wish I heard this much earlier because my 13-year-old pop rap phase would've absolutely stanned!! Submitted by /u/camerinian.

---

**camerinian** (11): God damn I love this song so much, even though it‚Äôs kinda hard to listen to at times. It's so painfully revealing of just how hard Cudi is doing it, and has been doing it for the past decade. That being said, this is such a perfect character study of someone devastatingly aware of how their vices are damaging them and might kill them in the end, but the vices are the only thing that they have to look forward to, because the rush is so potent that it makes all the demons go away just for the moment, and the upbeat sing-along chorus and bright synthy production means that you can't help but empathize with what he's going through, even though the guilt of the audience enabling it runs as an undercurrent throughout the whole song. It's such a layered song that's also just constructed marvelously. It's an all time classic

**2dina3dworld** (10): this makes me wanna do something stupid and impulsive to distract from my depression

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A GOAT

**CarlieScion** (10): vibes off the charts

**cremeebrulee** (10): a classique, i wish i had a second 11 i can use on this because anywhere other than day 3 is a robbery for this :(

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): MGMT rate when

**fadedblue09** (10): Genre-bending banger.

**frogaranaman** (10): undeniably a classic

**plastichaxan** (10): when anyone claims misandry to me about my taste i'll just show this to prove men can be good but most just are not

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This was THE MOMENT and aged as a classic tbh.

**skargardin** (10): kind of a classic that I had almost forgotten about omg

**steelstepladder** (10): Man on the Moon rate when?

**TiltControls** (10): why are there so many 11 worthy songs in this rate

**waluigiest** (10): I‚Äôve gotten back into this album and it‚Äôs honestly a modern classic. The general vibes of this song are stunning

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): He may become on of my favorite rapper at the moment

**FKJVMMP** (9): Everything MGMT touches is magic.

**runaway3212** (9): This is so good

**wryn\_** (9): i can't really listen to kid cudi anymore after pete davidson said he was objectively the best musician of all time but this is still really good

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.7): songs to blast during your 2 am breakdown

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): This song hits different with the pandemic going on.

**bbfan132** (8.5): ohhh so that‚Äôs what this song is called

**jsonphile** (8.5): about once every several months I‚Äôll be reminded of this song and I‚Äôm always like ‚Äúoh yeah. That‚Äôs a pretty great song.‚Äù

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): MGMT <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I understand lean now I guess

**ignitethephoenix** (8): king cudi

**ReallyCreative** (8): better than I anticipated

**Yatcho** (8): this is a good song but the stans of this song/album annoy the hell out of me

**fallenriot** (7.5): chill vibes only

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): wow I haven‚Äôt listened to the original in 800 years

**SRTviper** (7.2): Still one of the best Kid Cudi songs I‚Äôve heard.

**seanderlust** (7): i'm in the fursuit of happiness

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): Considering the featured artists, I was kind of underwhelmed by this track

**1998tweety** (6): i do not care about this, sorry to these men

**anothertown** (6): it's not day n nite

**timothy444** (6): Quite a slow dance track but I like it regardless.

**vayyiqra** (6): It's not bad but I'm mainly baffled by how this song even exists

**intheaftermath** (5): I misread this title as Nightcore but maybe this song would sound better that way

**nooodisaster** (5): i sense dark depressing sarcasm from this one

**wavingwolves** (5): let's be honest cudi has better songs than this

**Stryxen** (4.8): I hate some parts of this and the rest is fine - overall it makes me feel ill :)

**linothy** (4): it felt like it never started Again im seeing a pattern yall

If this song is proof of anything, it's that After Hours is not the first time this subreddit should've been paying attention to The Weeknd. *Kiss Land* is definitely my least favorite project of his, but this is a delicious slice of throwback pop/r&b that was released years before that trend even became big. Submitted by /u/cremeebrulee.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): A MASTERPIECE FROM A MASTERPIECE OF AN ALBUM. I remember bopping to this back when The Weeknd wasn‚Äôt a main pop boy yet. He‚Äôs BEEN pop.

**2dina3dworld** (10): this should be in a superhero movie. Especially the instrumental. It's so gritty but groovy.

**chihuahuazero** (10): I have a soft spot for Kiss Land because it was my introduction into the Weekend via (Rap) Genius. In hindsight, this showcases his New wave chops that he retained once he went mainstream.

**cremeebrulee** (10): hey this is my submission!!! i know it definitely gonna flop but i figured i may as well submit a song from one of my favorite albums that i never see it talked about here (despite the weeknd being one of the few men ph stans) anyway if youre reading this and enjoyed this song, stream kiss land!!! it has some of his best work!!!

**Flegasaurus** (10): wow. https://imgur.com/a/VguRoqk

**hikkaru** (10): best from kiss land imo, i'm glad we got to rate it here since we'll likely never rate that album

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I‚Äôm probably one of the only Weeknd fans who doesn‚Äôt love most of Kissland however this song is easily the highlight of it. It‚Äôs super catchy and just has an amazing build up and vibe. The Pharrell remix is also a big bop and I would recommend checking that out as well.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait this is a bop

**seanderlust** (10): this may come as a surprise, but i like the word wanderlust. but also, this song is so cool.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This maybe the best song i have ever listened from him

**timothy444** (10): Literally evidence that The Weeknd was always this talented

**vayyiqra** (10): This is great Popheads had better not make it flop

**1998tweety** (9.5): oh wow this bops

**camerinian** (9.5): fine stop bugging me I‚Äôll go and listen to The Weeknd‚Äôs older material now I‚Äôm convinced

**starlitsuns** (9.5): GIVE BLINDING LIGHTS YOUR 11S IN THE 2020 ULTIMATE ULTIMATE RATE. now that that‚Äôs out of the way, where‚Äôs the kiss land rate? (this is definitely a vibe song though)

**TheEvilNightman** (9.5): I didn't know I wanted The Weeknd X Depeche Mode until now.

**skargardin** (9): banger

**wavingwolves** (9): hits different now

**ReallyCreative** (8.9): I think the mixing is holding this back from being a 10, but it's a bop nontheless

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): tag yourself i‚Äôm the precious little diamond

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): This is more of a grower than a smash, but it‚Äôs still damn solid. The Weeknd hardly ever misses.

**frogaranaman** (8): the production on this song.. maybe I should revisit Kiss Land

**intheaftermath** (8): since the Superbowl, I have not stopped thinking about the full chorus on Blinding Lights. The Weeknd should do that more often. Wouldn't a big choir work perfectly on this song???

**kappyko** (8): snakehips remix an 11

**nooodisaster** (8): If The Weeknd called me 'precious little diamond' I'd probably die.

**bbfan132** (7.5): i liked it but it left me wanting more tbh

**fadedblue09** (7): A solid song but a little too long and gets stale after a while.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): nice but takes way too long to get to the point

**kirby31200** (7): One of us doesn't know what wanderlust means... I hate to say it but blackbear's Wanderlust is better

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): O Canada

**steelstepladder** (7): Not my favorite Weeknd song... G11ass Table Girls tho

**Stryxen** (7): sure!

**CarlieScion** (6): mr weeknd has so many GREAT songs. this is not one of them

**fallenriot** (6): the verses are beautiful but the chorus feels so anticlimactic

**anothertown** (5): why does he look like he's on greys anatomy in the album cover

**linothy** (4): im really picky with weekend songs i don't really like him

**runaway3212** (4): I like a lot of his songs. This is not one of them.

**SRTviper** (3.9): You ever get 10 minutes into a 5 minute song and realize you still have 2 minutes left?

This kind of Latin ballad is something that I've had basically no exposure to before so it feels unfair to rate it. That being said, it was cute. I was expecting more edge based on the cover art of the album. Submitted by /u/ThiefMotif.

---

**freav** (11): i remember we attempted to play a ska cover of this song with my first band in college a couple times, it was abysmal. this is a classic, one of these songs that are omnipresent around here but I can't complain because it's just so good.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): GOD, the fact that the moment this song dropped it immediately became part of the latin canon, legends only. Also....Cantando como si tuviera que juntar diez mil pesos en propinas en una noche porque ma√±ana tiene que pagar la luz, el internet, el gas, la despensa, la tanda y hasta la tarjeta de cr√©dito.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is honestly so good wtf. This song has lived rent free in my head ever since I heard it tbh. I‚Äôm giving this my 11 and I did not expect to actually give my 11 to a song I hadn‚Äôt heard before, especially with so many bops I know in this rate.

**NFLfreak98** (11): So this came out of nowhere. It‚Äôs amazing. Absolutely my favorite vocal performance here, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly close

**plastichaxan** (11): i'm so thankful to whoever submitted this, mon laferte is an amazing singer and one of my favorite latin american artists, i love seeing latin artists being represented and she is a great choice for this. que viva latinoamerica!

**2dina3dworld** (10): omg, I'd never heard this song before this rate and I'm now in love

**endcreditouilles** (10): the emotion!!! the power!!!! her voice!!!!! talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular

**intheaftermath** (10): it's understanding music like this that fuels me to continue taking Spanish 500

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is sooooo good. I'd already heard it well before this rate, but listening to it again just reignited my love for it. Go girl give us everything!

**rickikardashian** (10): WHAT DO YALL KNOW ABOUT A BELTING ANTHEM? **THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL HEARTBREAK SONG**

**runaway3212** (10): Love this!

**skargardin** (10): am i crazy or do they sound like bj√∂rk at times? either way im fucking obsessed omg

**SRTviper** (10): Idk what they are saying but i know it‚Äôs powerful

**Stryxen** (9.9): yeah SO true tbh

**fadedblue09** (9.5): The instrumental and vocals are so lovely! Even though I don't speak Spanish, it kinda reminds me of vintage music in my country lol.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): [fist pumping] hell yes! HELL yes!

**Yatcho** (9.5): this is GORGEOUS i hope it doesnt get robbed for being in Spanish

**1998tweety** (9): I don't know what she's saying but I'm living

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like this one! This kind of theatrical, big band music tends to get washed out into being just a ‚Äúsound‚Äù rather than a genre people take seriously (looking at you Postmodern Jukebox) but a song from it is nice every now and then.

**Roxieloxie** (9): Yes i am balladphobic however the emotion here>>>>

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Talent!!

**sirpancakeXI** (9): I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i am living.

**steelstepladder** (9): We're waltzing

**wavingwolves** (9): oh wow probably my favourite discovery from this rate

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I love songs with sort of this classic, big band, lounge-y sound. This is super easy to listen to.

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): beautiful voice, and my moderate spanish ability helps enjoy this.

**linothy** (8.5): pretty darn cool i just dont understand a Thing

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's not exactly my cup of tea but it's really impressive

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): oh this is cute (sonically i mean, if she‚Äôs singing about something sad i dont want to call it cute fkdjkds)

**AHSWeeknd** (8): if I was Emily Nelson I‚Äôd love this.

**fallenriot** (8): su vozzzz

**nooodisaster** (8): omg i thought this was a 90s song jsdfshfkjs

**pat-rickstar** (8): I don't know what this song is about, the vocals are pretty powerful though

**starlitsuns** (8): I really like the vocals on this!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): Chanter! Enchante!

**bbfan132** (7.5): nice track!!! liked the production and her voice a lot

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): yes queen give us dramatic vocals

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): Es hora tes comer√°s

**FKJVMMP** (6): I have a strong feeling this would be at least a 9 if I spoke Spanish.

**timothy444** (6): this isnt gangnam style wtf

**berober04** (3): Desesperadamente dedicada a ti

McIgglyTuffMuffin: I rarely make comments for rates and I thought I did for this one but I just wanted /u/ThiefMotif to know that I ended up liking this song so damn much that in the middle of it I went to the Spotify page for the album and saved the entire album.

I haven't listened to it yet, but I'm very excited to get to it.

Out of the songs I didn't know beforehand, this was the one song in this entire rate that resonated with me the most. It's just so damn good.

We'll rate The ArchAndroid someday, I promise! This deep cut made top 10 against the odds and I can't really be disappointed considering Janelle's deserved status on the sub. Submitted by /u/static_int_husp.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Obsessed with this song, I think it‚Äôs so beautiful and one of the best tracks of the Cyndi Mayweather era of Janelle‚Äôs music. There‚Äôs something almost medieval sounding about it, almost like an old folk song, which is fitting for the almost madrigal themes of the lyrics. This could just be me overanalyzing but I think that her android character allows her to express the emotions of the song in a very unique way, like how she blurs the line between the ‚Äúcreator‚Äù in a religious and technological sense and how she uses colors as reference points for sensations that are unrelated to sight (because if she were really a robot that‚Äôs probably how she would interpret the world). Also that outro‚Ä¶

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Love this, Archandroid is a masterpiece

**akanewasright** (10): God, Janelle deserves the fucking world

**endcreditouilles** (10): just so dang beautiful i cri everytim

**fallenriot** (10): absolutely stunning

**freav** (10): I often forget how much of a masterpiece the ArchAndroid is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): relistening to The Archandroid made me appreciate this song more

**plastichaxan** (10): the archandroid is such a gem of an album and this just proves part of its genius

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Immaculate song from one of my favourite concept albums ever.

**SRTviper** (10): It‚Äôs just gorgeous. How could you not love Janelle?

**sandyfishnets** (9.8): this mixture of folk and r'n'b is amazing. and the Bowie-esque outro is everything.

**TiltControls** (9.5): love the mod representation

**2dina3dworld** (9): this feels like the morning after having a breakdown in the forest.

**fadedblue09** (9): Really feels wrong to rate this outside its parent album but I enjoy her vocals.

**Flegasaurus** (9): w

**jsonphile** (9): not my favorite Janelle song but like everything she does is amazing

**Stryxen** (9): me when i‚Äôm surprised to see my friend Maker but then acknowledge his presence

**waluigiest** (9): a gorgeous song that shows off her versatility. It‚Äôs like a modern reimagining of a Beatles-style classic

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): queen mod

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): This wouldn't be my first choice, or my second choice , probably not even my third or fourth choice from TheArchAndroid, but Janelle did what she needed to do here.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): i‚Äôd honestly be less shocked by a janelle win than a carly win

**seanderlust** (8.5): this is lovely! though i feel like i'm missing a large element hearing this outside of the context of the archandroid

**Roxieloxie** (8.3): very cottagecore in a field of flowers energy

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I really should listen to this album in full eventually

**intheaftermath** (8): this genre really isn't my speed, but the vocal performance is SO GOOD

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Janelle is a genius

**nooodisaster** (8): <3 janelle <3

**runaway3212** (8): We love our secret mod

**skargardin** (8): it's not my favourite on the Archandroid but I do like it a lot

**static\_int\_husp** (8): So this is my submission. My reason for picking this is I wanted to pick a song from a black queer woman, and my mind immediately went to Janelle. Even though this song is from a while before she came out, it still feels very authentically queer.

**wavingwolves** (8): this hits just right

**bbfan132** (7.5): the outro was super pretty, this‚Äôll probably grow on me in the future

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Love Janelle and this song is good, but she's done better

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Not my favorite off of The Archandroid, but better by itself than I remember!

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Archandroid vs Age of Adz vs Plastic Beach is COMING... But this isn't one of my favorite songs off Archandroid

**1998tweety** (7): I wish this had a bit more of a distinct chorus but it's alright.

**starlitsuns** (7): this feels like lullaby music? it‚Äôs hard to explain why, but it‚Äôs not a bad thing by any means.

**timothy444** (7): A deep song with the conscious vocals from Ms Mon√°e providing a definitely pleasant tune.

**vayyiqra** (7): Love Janelle but not this so much

**CarlieScion** (6): i am so sorry to my fellow mod but this is a mid janelle song

**cremeebrulee** (6): i love janelle but i‚Äôm not really feeling this

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): I‚Äôm so sorry. I know you deserve better but I just didn‚Äôt care for this.

**linothy** (5): kinda vibey but Not Good Enough.

In hindsight, MNEK's *Language* should have been in the 20GayTeen rate that I hosted. It would have given some much-needed competition to my personal faves Years & Years, who absolutely stomped. I did include this in the bonus rate of that as a consolation, but now it finally gets a chance to shine in a standard rate. Submitted by /u/ManofOranges.

---

**ManofOranges** (11): I'm unsure whether I'm going to give my own submission my 11 but here's what I can say for sure, right now. IT'S A HIT!!!! This song is one of my most played songs of all time because everytime I hear it I get moving and grooving and I just cannot resist it. The production is immaculate, MNEK's vocals are great, and it's just so hot. I'm praying to God that this song makes Day 3 because it truly deserves. I'm not asking that it wins this rate like it won the bonus rate it was in before (I know that it's very, VERY unlikely since MNEK is pretty unknown here and also a man), but I'm hoping and praying for a little bit of appreciation for this song.

**skargardin** (11): STAN MNEK RIGHT FUCKING NOW!!!

**akanewasright** (10): TIKKY TOO TIKKY TEE TIKKY TATATA

**CarlieScion** (10): iconique

**celladonn** (10): I will never forgive the general public for letting MNEK's album flop

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): On top of this being a megabop, MNEK is also the hottest man alive üï≥

**frogaranaman** (10): MNEK deserves all the success he gets

**hikkaru** (10): this is SUCH a bop i swear it gets better every time i listen to it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): they literally just had MNEK as a guest judge and they didn‚Äôt use this song as the lip sync song????? I‚Äôm gonna start swinging

**pat-rickstar** (10): Bumped this score up from a 9 at the last minute before sending scores because something has kept me coming back to this song and I would've probably regretted not giving it a 10

**plastichaxan** (10): as i listened to the song i tried to highlight something but it just kept changing, there is so much about this song i really really like

**ReallyCreative** (10): it's chaotic but in the best possible way, the serv-ocity

**rotating3Dtext** (10): an underrated BOP, his voice is amazing

**seanderlust** (10): the vocal effect during the start of the last choruses is really cool

**steelstepladder** (10): This was my most listened to song of 2018 of course it gets a 10

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): mnek is so good

**timothy444** (10): It's no secret that MNEK is a talented musician, producer and songwriter so it should surprise nobody to release an energetic U.K. banger like this. From the bangy instrumentals, the incorporation of the whispers and of course the syncopation, these elements together make up for one catchy bop!

**waluigiest** (10): I love MNEK and this song is so legendary

**1998tweety** (9): massive bop

**anothertown** (9): alright go off!

**bbfan132** (9): :daisybop:

**chihuahuazero** (9): Whisper choruses are underused in pop, and MNEK demonstrates why.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I actually used to really dislike MNEK back when this album came out but I think that was internalized homophobia or something because I‚Äôve come around on him in recent years. I still think his voice is kinda sandy and not great for pop music but on songs like this he really makes it work, the hot-and-heavy vibes here are sexy as hell

**pheromenos** (9): ahh üëÖ

**runaway3212** (9): Really Great

**TiltControls** (9): this song is musical sex

**Stryxen** (8.8): has absolutely no business being this intense

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): wow this slaps hard.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Oooh this one really grew on me over a couple listens. I wish I could be in a club right now, fuck!

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): the whiplash from the verses to the chorus is something i need to get used to but i think i could after a few listens. i love their voice/delivery here (enough to check out the rest of their album later!)

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Woah, the production is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The vocals are so "forward" in the mix, it's so unique and striking?? A serve.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): cute bop!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.1): similarly to Tayla Parx, MNEK is under-appreciated for his songwriting contributions to pop and deserves his breakthrough moment as a performer

**brenda\_official** (8): its like todrick hall music but good

**fallenriot** (8): I love the switch-up sm

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a slapper

**wavingwolves** (8): this is hot

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.8): i'm not a fan of the drop :(

**bulforster** (7.5): I like both the sung and rapped parts but they don't fit together which becomes clear when they're overlayed at the end.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): loooved the new instrumentals in the beat about 1:50 in, right before the bridge

**wryn\_** (7): MNEK is such a talented producer, this is just so amazing sounding

**rickikardashian** (6.7): this bops so hard but i dont like the lower register part. this also sounds like it was written with zara larsson in mind

**SRTviper** (6.5): A wiki wiki mai lohi lohi, La we mai iko papa he na lu, Pi'I na nalu la lahalaha, O ka moana hanupanupa, Lalala I kala hanahana, Me ke kai hoene I ka pu'e one, Helehele mai kakou e

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I mean, it‚Äôs okay

**fishingfor8** (5): verses don't match the chorus at all

**LazyDayLullaby** (4): Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth

**linothy** (4): i i would use this in a movie but i wouldn't listen to it?? and unfortunately im not a director

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): wtf is going on in the chorus

**fadedblue09** (2): I get that this rate is supposed to celebrate Queer POC's, but that doesn't excuse the soullessness of his music (and I don't have a licking fetish, so‚Ä¶)

**2dina3dworld** (1): there's something about this that rubs me the wrong way

I've gotten very into Tame Impala over the past year and this is objectively their biggest bop. We NEED to rate this full album soon!! Submitted by /u/ignitethephoenix.

---

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): This better make it at least into the Top 5 or I‚Äôll hire some Swifties to doxx whoever gave this less than a 10.

**berober04** (11): https://youtu.be/ogjbs5Ym7Y0

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): THAT BASSLINE. EVERYTHING

**nootnoot781** (11): sorry :/

**Stryxen** (11): lol me looking at these scores, i don‚Äôt even WANT to know what popheads think of this - but i‚Äôm not like other popheads üòç

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is peak angsty teenage boy with a lot of hidden anger towards girls, and somehow I still vibe with it.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Currents is so iconic.

**bbfan132** (10): miss when they made interesting/fun music like this

**cremeebrulee** (10): a classic, ez day 3 material, probably the only white winner i will accept

**frogaranaman** (10): because of course

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the song I submitted. I discovered this song and Tame Impala about a year ago and I‚Äôve been in love with the music since. This became my most played song of all time after discovering it so you can say I‚Äôm obsessed. The guitar line is fantastic and it‚Äôs just a perfectly executed song and vibe in my opinion. There‚Äôs just something so satisfying about this song and it‚Äôs an absolutely ear worm to me. Anyway I hope this song makes day 3 and go stream Currents.

**intheaftermath** (10): omg it's taming paula

**linothy** (10): banger, obviously, since it's already in my playlist

**rotating3Dtext** (10): an indie classic, idc idc

**Roxieloxie** (10): This being after Sir Duke is absolutely EVIL , this was the 3rd song on my 11 shortlist for this rate. Had we done this last year i would not have any emotional attachment to this song however, the only party i got to go to in my freshman year of uni while on campus was this sorta small basement gay dance party that my friend had for his 18th party. I remember being surrounded by all my friends (for what would end up being the only time in 2020) and there was this rose colored pink lighting illuminating the room that just made everything feel like we we're in a movie, Having never heard this song before being illuminated in the rosy light around people, was the closest I had felt to belong all that year and I wish i could go back to that feeling every day.

**steelstepladder** (10): Deserves top 5

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): just so good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if saying this is the best tame impala song is wrong and makes me basic then i don‚Äôt wanna be right

**timothy444** (10): YUNGBLUD must've listened to this and he'd be like, "wow this bassline is dope, maybe I should steal this for the backing track of 'cotton candy'.", and then he high fives himself thinking he can make real music

**Yatcho** (10): the way this song/album unites hipsters, popheads, insta baddies, nerds, potheads, hiphopheads, cholos, frat guys, bruh girls... the vibes are immaculate

**akanewasright** (9.5): Huh. Maybe pretentious asshole hipsters made some points with their music

**camerinian** (9.5): FUCK TREVOR

**1998tweety** (9): hold awn this is a serve

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): It's good but tired.

**ManofOranges** (9): I'm not quite in on the tame impala hype train but I will admit that I can see what's so good about them with this song. It's more than serviceable, I can say that.

**ReallyCreative** (9): bop

**seanderlust** (9): i'm giving this a 9 in spite of the fact that the lyrics reek of "dude who complains about the friendzone." i'm giving it a 9 because it absolutely SLAPS.

**skargardin** (9): it's the serve

**starlitsuns** (9): this is a vibe wow, need to listen to all of this album

**NFLfreak98** (8.9): No matter how much I hear that bassline it still hits

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this will make it very far and people will be very upset when it beats SOS or something

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): So groovy, I can‚Äôt deny this bop even thought the jealousy themed lyrics sound more toxic than relatable to me at this point in my life

**kirby31200** (8): I've always tried to like this song more than I do since the bassline kills and everyone loves the song but I'm just not in love with the vocals.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love MGMT !

**wavingwolves** (8): c'mon superman say your stupid line

**wryn\_** (8): that bass intro has been used in so many memes that it's the modern day equivalent of the first few drum hits in never gonna give you up, this song has kinda been ruined for me as a result but it still bangs

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.7): I prefer Wild Impala

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): this is nice but what‚Äôs up with all the reverb?

**hikkaru** (7.5): yeah my music taste is really indie n underground my fave artist is tame impala idt u know them :/

**plastichaxan** (7.3): this is a bit more boring than i remembered oop

**fallenriot** (7): yes it‚Äôs a good song but if my friends make me play it in the car one more time I stg

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): Maybe Taming Paula is good

**runaway3212** (6.5): This is such a typical Tame Impale

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): The bass guitar is the only thing I like about this song tbh. The rest just sounds so bleh and I hate how his vocals are so far in the back (and how they sound).

**Tolk1en** (6): Very nice intro but not completely convinced by the rest

**anothertown** (5): the diminishing returns on this one

**CarlieScion** (5): tame impala is just not for me

**ImADudeDuh** (5): k

**sarcasticsobs** (5): its not bad, but the sick bass cannot stop the rest of the song from putting me to sleep

**freav** (4.5): i dont like to tell people im mostly into indie music in fear that they associate me w this band

**nooodisaster** (4): its not my vibe but im happy for yall

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Snooze-worthy synth arrangements with some mildly incel-ish lyrics. Yawn.

**SRTviper** (3): Kevin, stop that voice, stop it right now. Get some help.

**bulforster** (2): This rate made me realise I actually don't like this song.

This has been my favorite Mariah song since I discovered her discography nearly 10 years ago. It perfectly balances brightness and melancholy in a way that most ballads don't, especially when in combination with the heavy background vocals (which was a choice Mariah did not usually go for in this era.) Submitted by /u/joshually.

---

**JunkyGS** (11): Timeless

**pietrohonkhonk** (11): There‚Äôs a reason why this song is a classic, which is because it‚Äôs just that good.

**waluigiest** (11): This wasn‚Äôt going to be my 11, but I haven‚Äôt stopped listening to this song since I rated it about two weeks ago. I find myself singing to myself, a soft ‚Äúand we‚Äôll linger oooo-ONNNN‚Äù as I dip into my lowest register. There are so many stunning moments - the tension she builds in the chorus, the incredibly smooth key change, the counterpoint in the final chorus. It‚Äôs a masterpiece.

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**akanewasright** (10): (Oh boy, this again) I got in a car crash to this song. It was like two weeks after I got my license. My dinky tin can of a VW Bug got rammed into by a big ass pickup truck, completely totaling the car (for those curious, this coincided with the key change of the song). I remember being distant from reality for what seemed like minutes, but was probably just a few seconds. I don‚Äôt remember the impact, I just remember my brain being fuzzy, but snapping back to reality as i realized that the airbag had hit my nose and that my car was smoking. I could hear Mariah‚Äôs melismas faintly as I got out of the car. It was kind of traumatic. Anyway, this song has that baggage and it‚Äôs still one of my favorites ever.

**anothertown** (10): the best hook ever written. And I stand by that!

**bbfan132** (10): the mr dupri remix makes me ascend but the original is just as great

**bulforster** (10): Around when I came out I decided I should probably do more gay shit like get into Mariah and this was the song that did it for me so I love it for making me an active fan of pop music and reminding me of being a baby gay.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is mariah at her best! i adore this song and honestly if it wins i wouldn‚Äôt mind because its so sweet and beautiful

**ignitethephoenix** (10): her signature song that isn‚Äôt we belong together

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of her best songs

**ManofOranges** (10): Omg stalker anthem.

**rickikardashian** (10): i was going to make a car crash joke but i felt bad

**runaway3212** (10): SKINNY LEGEND THINGS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): An immaculate classic tbh.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Bop

**skargardin** (10): the key change is where i ascend

**slimboyfriend** (10): This song really takes me back to when I was a fetus in my mom's womb

**TiltControls** (10): Mariah's best song, which is extraordinary given the strength of her discography

**timothy444** (10): Mariah Carey has this uncanny ability to create bops that stand the test of time.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): timeless classic

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): /u/akanewasright <333

**fadedblue09** (9): A yandere anthem <3

**Flegasaurus** (9): a great song!!!! no questioning it!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): good but never been one of my favorite Mariah singles

**nooodisaster** (9): Ah, that's history. But actually listening to this song, it's kinda delusional and tragic/mildly stalker vibes?? huh...

**ReallyCreative** (9): Of Mariah's hits, I don't think this one has aged the best. However, it's still an iconic classic that hopefully I can one day relate to!

**SmileAndTears** (9): insert joke about akane crashing his car

**starlitsuns** (9): wow, a Mariah song I can recognize somehow from outside the realms of Popheads as a post-millenium child

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): kind of an unrelated question but has anyone else seen that Netflix movie always be my maybe? it‚Äôs a silly and kinda stupid romcom but for some reason i love it a lot and whenever i hear this song it reminds me of the ending of that movie.

**vayyiqra** (9): A classic

**2dina3dworld** (8): car trip to a beach about an hour away with 90s radio on vibes

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I should really listen to more Mariah Carey, this is great

**pat-rickstar** (8): I was confused because I thought this was in the last winners rate, then I realised that was We Belong Together, oops

**steelstepladder** (8): A jam!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.6): Doo doo doop, yeah

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.3): can't listen to this without thinking im about to get in a car accident popheads Impact

**linothy** (7): feel good song. pog tbh. why did it take so long to start

**Stryxen** (7): don‚Äôt think I have ever had an opinion on a mariah carey song

**wavingwolves** (6): cute

**SRTviper** (5): Ok so she is really good, but for me her singing is just a bit much. Like I wish she was worse at singing.

The escalating, robotic keys are so fresh even 15 years later, it's no surprise that this has gone down as one of Missy's best songs. Fatman Scoop adds a TON to the energy of the song and is proof that we should bring back songs having built-in hypemen like in the 2000s. Submitted by /u/seanderlust.

---

**endcreditouilles** (11): I got a cute face, chubby waist, thick legs, in shape, rump shakin, both ways, make you do a DOUBLE TAKE

**RandomHypnotica** (11): What an incredible song. The incredibly catchy synth, Missy's incredible flow, the Ciara feature is top tier as well (and Fatman Scoop is there), it's just a total powerhouse of a track, and I adore it.

**1998tweety** (10): ICONIC

**2dina3dworld** (10): THE 2016 VMAS PERFORMANCE. ICONIC. That performance and this song blows my mind.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Missy Elliot is next level, everything about this is absolutely insane.

**akanewasright** (10): An 11 contender tbh. It simply goes that hard

**anothertown** (10): It could have been this song that made me a pophead.. I remember when it came out, I was just stunned by it, I'd never heard anything like it before. (Granted I was 12)

**bbfan132** (10): i love whoever picked this, absolute classic

**camerinian** (10): THE FIRST FIVE SECONDS OF THIS SONG ARE THE SINGLE MOST HYPE SERIES OF SOUNDS TO EVER FUCKING BE RECORDED

**chihuahuazero** (10): Even today, Missy's verses are fire.

**cremeebrulee** (10): another classic here so this is a VERY easy 10

**fadedblue09** (10): The joint power of Missy and Ciara is just unmatchable. (of course, that is not to discredit Fatman Scoop's equally memorable contribution).

**fallenriot** (10): do I even need to say anything here

**FKJVMMP** (10): Full credit for single-handedly keeping breakdance groups in business for the last 15 years.

**Flegasaurus** (10): music peaked with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo_QeYg1uf8

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/41c0c2139f99146740aa20ea2d6f4ade/tenor.gif

**JunkyGS** (10): Under rated bop

**kappyko** (10): this is going to win

**ManofOranges** (10): Fuckin boppppp. I'd argue one of Missy's best, but if not then at least it's one of her most entertaining. I lose control every single time this comes on like for real.

**nooodisaster** (10): YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**plastichaxan** (10): missy IS the blueprint and i will not tolerate any disrespect to this banger

**ReallyCreative** (10): I love how playful everyone is on this track, it's just a fun, engaging collaboration. Absolutely iconic.

**rickikardashian** (10): whenever i listen to this song, i picture that one sped-up video of a crowd carrying a virgin mary statue with roman holiday in the background

**rotating3Dtext** (10): a timeless classic

**Roxieloxie** (10): if this isnt top 10 whats the point

**runaway3212** (10): what a serve

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Still makes me want to go feral on the dance floor! Missy is a legend, and her collabs with Ciara are always top-tier.

**seanderlust** (10): i've got a cute face, chubby waist, thick legs, in shape, rump shaking both ways make you do a double take submit comment

**skargardin** (10): BOPPPP

**steelstepladder** (10): MISDEMEANOR'S IN THE HOUSE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): popheads when the heads are popped idk i never looked at the subreddit

**timothy444** (10): triangle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0GlikjUJd8

**Yatcho** (10): a cultural reset [2]

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): still a banger after all these years.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This song is SO nostalgic for me. Love everything about it.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a slapper

**bulforster** (9): Missy deserves more respect for being such a killer producer.

**waluigiest** (9): I NEED CLUBS TO REOPEN SO I CAN SHAKE ASS TO THIS SONG AGAIN

**jsonphile** (8.5): Missy Elliot could rap about how to change a tire and it would still sound cool af

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): This taught me that Ciara is not pronounced how I thought it was

**starlitsuns** (8): as a person named Ciara (irish variant) irl, I would just like to take points off of this for the fact that I am constantly called Sierra rather than Kee-rah thanks to the person I share a name with

**wryn\_** (8): genuinely this production is more crazy than 99% of modern day hyperpop, you can really see her impact on so many rappers today through this kind of song

**SRTviper** (7.6): I can skank to this

**TheEvilNightman** (7.5): Dancing triangle main pop girl.

**CarlieScion** (7): this would be a 10 if there wasnt a persistent voice of a man going HUH HUH HUH HUH in the background

**frogaranaman** (7): wow this song is longer than I remember

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I love Ciara! just not this song, I respect the hell out of Missy but this is not my vibe

**kirby31200** (7): I kinda think the beat and Fatman Scoop overshadow Missy and Ciara

**wavingwolves** (7): we love a tiktok hit

**Stryxen** (6.3): This caught me so off guard skdjlksjd

**astrologicalangel** (6): I really want to like this but the beat just doesn't quite work

**LazyDayLullaby** (6): The Shepard Tone type production is cool

**linothy** (3): god i knew what it was instantly but that Doesn't mean it's good </3

I hadn't heard this before the rate and it slaps! I really love its infectious joy and soul, and I definitely didn't expect something so upbeat from Natalie Cole. Thank you to my friend /u/kappyko for submitting this :)

---

**1998tweety** (10): Masterpiece

**2dina3dworld** (10): remind me to walk down the aisle to this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Natalie Cole an icon.

**akanewasright** (10): A classic

**anothertown** (10): i watched dida ritz lip sync for natalie cole and cried

**berober04** (10): The Parent Trap opens with Nat King Cole's "L-O-V-E" and ends with Natalie Cole's "This Will Be". An everlasting love, indeed.

**bulforster** (10): Dida wouldn't have been able deliver possibly the best LSFYL of the series if the song wasn't one of the purest expressions of joy known to man in the first place!!

**camerinian** (10): Holy shit what a glorious song. I know this isn't strictly Motown but it has that undeniable brilliant Motown of being just an immediate burst of happiness that just quickly keeps building in exuberance with every single moment and climaxing so joyously, and then it's gone, an immediate shot of happiness. I do not know how anyone could listen to this and not walk away in a better mood

**cremeebrulee** (10): OHHHH ITS THIS SONG yep classic ez 10 we want a black women winner this month!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): GET DIDA RITZ ON ALL STARS.

**endcreditouilles** (10): tbh this ties for my 11 but alas I can only give one. SO LONG AS I'M LIVING THIS SONG WILL BE SERVING

**kappyko** (10): every timei. listen pure joy

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure classic.

**nbapip** (10): this being next to mlp is so offensive

**nootnoot781** (10): something something dida ritz <3

**plastichaxan** (10): the joy this song brings me, and i have to mention the drag race lip sync to this, dida ritz embodied this in a way that just elevated how i feel about it

**rickikardashian** (10): i know being a rup\**l‚Äôs dr\*g r\*ce fan is not socially acceptable anymore, but dida ritz murdering the princess to this song will forever come to my mind when i listen to, and honestly i think it‚Äôs helping

**Roxieloxie** (10): HUGGIN AND SQUEEZING AND LOVING AND PLEASING

**seanderlust** (10): dida ritz end of comment

**skargardin** (10): Dida did what she had to do

**starlitsuns** (10): do you know this from the EHarmony commercials or from watching the 1998 version of the parent trap? because for me it‚Äôs the latter and it‚Äôs getting full nostalgia points. now i have to watch the parent trap (1998) when I finish this rate. thanks popheads.

**waluigiest** (10): is this the most joyous song ever? Maybe.

**Yatcho** (10): Did a Ritz the only living person allowed to perform this anymore

**NFLfreak98** (9.6): One of the absolute best sounding songs in here

**fadedblue09** (9.5): This is so cute! Gives me Whitney vibes.

**bbfan132** (9): dida ritz

**Flegasaurus** (9): i am really really vibing with this

**ignitethephoenix** (9): classic

**linothy** (9): A GOOD THROWBACK UGH AMEN FUCKING SO GOOD

**nooodisaster** (9): I have two references to this: The Parent Trap movie, and Dida Ritz lipsyncing the house down.

**slimboyfriend** (9): eHarmony or drag race; choose your reference

**timothy444** (9): Many people will know this as the song from "The Parent Trap" but I see this as something more. I see it as a legendary icon performing an incredibly soulful banger!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.7): I need to listen to more Natalie Cole

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): I love me a good old throwback tune. This was a fun listen and got me on my feet.

**frogaranaman** (8): wow a 70s classic

**vayyiqra** (8): :uwu:

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): A fantastic song that capitalism has ruined with thousands of variations of "He went to Jared's" or "This Christmas, get her the gift... of diamonds. Diamonds from Zales" while this music plays

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.2): I believe it!

**SRTviper** (7): Good song other than the fade out.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): minus 2 points for the overplay my mom exposed me to when she played this every single morning for a year while i got ready for school

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.8): this is probably sacrilegious but all i can hear when i hear this song is eharmony commercial

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Obviously a classic but as someone who grew up during the 2000's in America I can only associate this song with Viagra commercials

**wavingwolves** (6): now i want to rewatch the parent trap

**wryn\_** (6): this cover art is actually scary lol

**Stryxen** (5.9): what is even happening in this rate at this point i'm losing it

**runaway3212** (5): meh

**fishingfor8** (3): her vocals are weirdly too high at the end? Idk songs just way too much

The best use of a sample in a pop song EVER!!! I love the original Tainted Love and this flips it into an even better form. This may in fact be Rihanna's best song and it's definitely her biggest bop. Please drop more music I'm begging!!! Submitted by /u/hikkaru.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): an iconic bop! The tainted love sample is so good probably one of my favorite instances of sampling in a song. Also rihanna please drop new music ty. My submitted song would be my 11 any other day but like I feel like Rihanna is overdue for a rate win song wise and this definitely would deserve it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this rate was definitely saying "SOS somebody help me" up to this point let's just say that

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I didn‚Äôt know the Fenty lady used to be a teenage pop star. Who knew.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Would‚Äôve been my eleven if it weren‚Äôt for Wanderlust. But OOF this is beyond good. THIS IS HOW YOU DO A SAMPLE.

**akanewasright** (10): An 11 contender. I need R9...

**anothertown** (10): When I first started coming to Popheads I saw this post and it‚Äôs probably why I keep coming back on here: "New to pop music. Any songs as good as SOS by Rihanna? I've never heard a song in any genre that good tbh"

**bbfan132** (10): the tainted love sample‚Ä¶ ugh

**chihuahuazero** (10): Modern classic.

**cremeebrulee** (10): my favorite rihanna song !! idc that the production is aged or abrasive or whatever i freaking love it. this song is so freaking catchy and fun and i BETTER see this top 2

**hikkaru** (10): my submission!! i know charity rates are a time to promo a personal flop fave but someone had to submit something to contest cut to the feeling and rih needs her rate win!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is Rihanna‚Äôs best song.

**intheaftermath** (10): Love you, Kidz Bop 10. And by that I mean hate you.

**letsallpoo** (10): the peak of music

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): our rate winner ladies and gentlemen

**pat-rickstar** (10): Someone said this song is FIFTEEN years old now and I just can't‚Ä¶.. there are users on this subreddit younger than this song.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It took me until 2019 to realise this sampled Tainted Love‚Ä¶

**ReallyCreative** (10): I mean who was doing it like her

**rickikardashian** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/86db1c2e1ff6fb8fcce2b648312a8e74/tenor.gif?itemid=5362871

**Roxieloxie** (10): :rihdance:

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is when I knew Rihanna had IT and would be around for a long time. The Soft Cell sample blends seamlessly, she was ahead of the 80s nostalgia cycle while updating it for the 21st century.

**sandyfishnets** (10): pov it's 2006 you're a pre-teen listening to this song on the brand new MP3 player you got for your birthday

**starlitsuns** (10): maybe it‚Äôs because Rihanna has 8 albums, but we haven‚Äôt rated A Girl Like Me yet? AJayII would cancel all of us if she wasn‚Äôt MIA!

**timothy444** (10): I wish Rihanna still made music like this

**vayyiqra** (10): A total banger and one of the best uses of a sample ever

**waluigiest** (10): a perfect pop song, plain and simple.

**camerinian** (9.5): Jesus every syllable on that hook is like an uppercut to the face, what a massive, brilliant bombastic classic

**seanderlust** (9.2): i never caught quite how clever these lyrics were before!

**Flegasaurus** (9): yep yep yep yep!

**kirby31200** (9): I think this is considered a lower entry in her catalogue now, but to me it's a classic

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Rihanna is a classic as always

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the use of the sample is amazing tbh

**skargardin** (9): classic

**wryn\_** (9): tainted who???

**bulforster** (8.5): This song is always better than I remember, I think because I tend to forget how well that sample works.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Third best single on A Girl Like Me. Love Rih, but this feels a little dated compared to We Ride and Unfaithful. It's mostly nostalgia giving this points tbh.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): A classic, an absolute classic.

**Stryxen** (8.5): popular opinion rihanna good

**fallenriot** (8): god this makes me so nostalgic

**runaway3212** (8): A classic

**SmileAndTears** (8): I'll be very surprised if this doesn't end up winning

**TiltControls** (8): never was my favourite Rih song, but I can't deny it goes hard

**jsonphile** (7.5): far from Rihanna‚Äôs best song, but still fun

**2dina3dworld** (7): pretty classic, but not even the best off "A Girl like Me"

**SRTviper** (7): Crazy how this sounds less dated than some of the songs on this list that are like 5 years old.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I know a lot of people have nostalgia for early Rihanna but I think it‚Äôs just that, nostalgia. A lot of this stuff annoyed me when it came out and even as I‚Äôve come to embrace pop music it still sounds really cheap and dated.

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.4): Save Our Shoes

**CarlieScion** (6): this gives me flashback to my zumba classes

**ManofOranges** (6): It's a fine Rihanna song, but I think she has better. The Soft Cell Tainted Love sample is kind of bad to me, but not awful.

**wavingwolves** (6): i liked this better at the time of release and for some reason i don't like it that much anymore

**linothy** (5.5): just boring idk is rihanna alright

**Brendon-Urine** (4.5): It's a fine Rihanna song but the sample is just so overbearing, it just feels like Tainted Love but with new vocals

This song is basically a tribute to pop music in general and because of that is one of my favorite songs of all time. Truly just a 10/10 in every category. We NEED to do the greatest hits rate of Stevie vs. Elton vs. Billy Joel so this can see justice!! Submitted by /u/Roxieloxie.

---

**akanewasright** (11): It would be nice if this won. It‚Äôs just a lovely fucking song.

**jsonphile** (11): it‚Äôs Stevie Wonder. Do I need to explain why this song is great? Every horn blast, every little melody, the groove, Stevie‚Äôs smooth vocals, it‚Äôs just perfect. And it‚Äôs not even close to being his best song that‚Äôs how good the man is

**LazyDayLullaby** (11): The first time I heard this it was a beautiful, sunny summer day, and it never fails to transport me back there. Absolute joy in a song

**Mysario** (11): imagine if TK rigged the results for this to win, wouldn't that be craaaaaaaaaaazy?

**Roxieloxie** (11): Okay so I sent this song and im sorry to be that person but im giving it my 11. So this is my first Charity rate and I actually got to help out a lil bit with it Shout out to Black Artist Inspire anyway my idea behind sending in a song was to send in something that reminded me of people/things that I love. I deliberated for a while as to what I was gonna do. I went through alot of songs that either reminded me of my parents but didnt send them in because they either felt too niche or too long and I didnt want to do that. It wasnt until I saw Kappy talking about how we needed to rate stevie wonder because we had really only rated one song from him before and I realized he was absolutely right. Stevie Wonder is one of my moms favorite artist and originally I was gonna send in her favorite song ever All I Do, but i felt that might be too specific, so i took a gamble with this one, its just alot of fun, its under 4 minutes, and I felt like it had the best chance of being known. So even if it doesnt win I do hope that you all maybe got a chance to appreciate it a little bit

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Songs In The Key Of Life seems too long to force people to rate but everyone needs to go hear it. Seriously.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): funk masterpiece

**anothertown** (10): Stevie is here to remind you that jazz, a singularly Black art form, was the most significant advancement in the history of pop music and invented/influenced almost every fundamental thing about it

**bbfan132** (10): absolute classic

**CarlieScion** (10): legend

**cremeebrulee** (10): we want this in the top 3!!!

**endcreditouilles** (10): one of the greatest songs from one of the greatest musicians about another one of the greatest musicians. Legends all around

**fadedblue09** (10): Classic banger.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): would be iconic if this won

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a classic! Should be a top 5 song easily if people who do this rate have taste

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We fucking want Elton John vs Billy Joel vs Stevie Wonder

**JunkyGS** (10): KappyKo Rights!!!

**pat-rickstar** (10): This song is so classic and I do not want to see it disrepected here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Stevie Wonder IS music.

**seanderlust** (10): a joyous celebration of music!

**skargardin** (10): need to listen to some more stevie wonder i think

**SRTviper** (10): Catchy, fun, energetic, and mixed so goddamn perfect.

**starlitsuns** (10): gotta appreciate the classics.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): songs in the key of life is one of the best albums of all time

**vayyiqra** (10): This bop is pure joy and the kind of song that reminds us why we love music

**waluigiest** (10): a perfect song from a perfect album. I‚Äôm so happy to rate this and am now thinking about to fit Songs in the Key of Life into a rate

**astrologicalangel** (9.5): absolutely classic

**2dina3dworld** (9): I used to hear this in the grocery store and on radio all the time, and I never knew it was by Stevie Wonder. TIL, I guess

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): I‚Äôm loving this.

**camerinian** (9): ok so in my year 9 music class we used this song to learn the basics of assembling music in Garageband by having the song cut up into segments and scrambled and needing to rearrange them in the right order and for some reason that took multiple lessons and I remember unthinkingly overlapping two segments and then saving and then the next week I came back and as a result one of the segments had been clipped by like a third and the assembled song had a chunk missing and I wasn't sure how to reset the stems at that point so I just submitted it as was and I never heard anything back from that music teacher but I'm gonna assume she thought she had a real dipshit on her hands cos she didn't really interact with me the rest of the semester. Anyway the song is pretty good when it's not missing half of the second chorus

**Flegasaurus** (9): yes its so good omg!!!!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (9): mad respect to whoever submitted Stevie Wonder to this rate

**linothy** (9): oooo i was intrigued and i Remained intrigued. legend has it i forever will be

**ManofOranges** (9): We need some more rates with Stevie Wonder.

**NFLfreak98** (9): Possibly the most classic use of a horn line

**Stryxen** (9): well yeah it‚Äôs good get off my back

**timothy444** (9): Nice deep cut

**wavingwolves** (9): heartwarming

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): hot take: the verses absolutely torch every other part of this (otherwise slightly overrated) bop

**Yatcho** (8.2): Stevie main pop girl

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**FKJVMMP** (8): Stevie Wonder does not look like he should sound like that and it gets me every time.

**nooodisaster** (8): Performed, written, and produced solely by Stevie Wonder. And still listened to 40 years after its release. Do y'all see this shit?!?

**wryn\_** (8): patricia taxxon's cover of this is so good

**bulforster** (7.5): The instrumental sections are great but Stevie's sung parts aren't commanding enough to match them.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): At first I read Stevie Nicks so I was very surprised when the song started, I thought this was another Tracy Chapman situation but no, I'm just a dumbass

**TiltControls** (6.5): I love Stevie... but this song never clicked for me compared to how much it gets played (If we ever end up doing that Stevie/Billy/Elton rate I promise I'll make it up to him with my other scores!!!)

**runaway3212** (6): My dad overplayed this so

**rickikardashian** (4.5): i swear i tried to like this so hard‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. but i just dont

This song is good but it's probably the most boring winner contender in this rate. It's a reject from an EP of rejects! The video had a lower budget than any given Spotify vertical video! It was only released because some Z-list animated film bought the rights to it! What I'm trying to say is that she has many songs that are essentially just better versions of this. Submitted by /u/CarlieScion.

---

**1998tweety** (11): Am I a basic gay who gives my 11 to Carly? Yes <3

**Brendon-Urine** (11): Avenged Sevenfold almost took my 11 for pure nostalgia, but of course Carly swooped in and won it. This song took a whole new meaning to me after hearing it live as well, glitter shooting everywhere and just in general a blast of seratonin.

**CarlieScion** (11): im gonna personally come for any and all people who dropped their scores for this bc they didnt want it to win

**CritneySpearz** (11): cured my depression (lol jk)

**Jackalope117** (11): Only listened to all these songs to give this my 11, literally my favorite pop song ever.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): if serotonin was distilled into a song

**vayyiqra** (11): more like cute to the feeling

**2dina3dworld** (10): She's very precious to me!

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): ICONIC. TRULY. JOANNE THE SCAMMER IS SHOOK.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A masterpiece that got a two dollar video.

**bigbigbee** (10): This song makes me want to run towards a summer sunset with my bosom friends <3 The Spotify thumbnail for this perfectly complements its mood.

**brenda\_official** (10): hmm i wonder what will win

**bulforster** (10): This was the first Carly release I was a fan for and it didn't disappoint. Forget Disco Sweat, we still need the other 220 leftovers from Emotion.

**celladonn** (10): I will do a comical little spit take if this doesn't win the rate

**cremeebrulee** (10): me reluctantly giving this is a 10 bc it is my fave crj song ever but if this wins ‚Ä¶ i pretend i do not see

**fallenriot** (10): literal euphoria

**hikkaru** (10): my fave carly song but i don't want it to win but also i can't not give it a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): people are gonna sabotage this anyway, so I feel no guilt giving Carly‚Äôs best song a full 10 that it deserves.

**intheaftermath** (10): the way she sings angels >>>>>>

**jsonphile** (10): Honestly one of Carly‚Äôs best songs

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): But how can you dance on the roof if you break the ceiling??

**pat-rickstar** (10): Carly really is one of the best at capturing pure euphoria in pop

**pheromenos** (10): all hail the queen

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): pOp pErFeCtiOn

**plastichaxan** (10): i don't know if this will end up being overrated or sabotaged, i don't see an intermediate happen, but damn this is a feel good song and a deserving 10 i don't care

**ReallyCreative** (10): All rise for the playing of our national anthem

**rickikardashian** (10): [popheads rating this song](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768833554200264724/814526518352805908/unknown.png)

**rotating3Dtext** (10): just a classic, perfect, carly song

**Roxieloxie** (10): yall are gonna give this your 0s because you dont want this to win, and i agree it should win but you want me to act like this song does not absolutely fuck on popheads of all sites???? are you insane??? this song is pure spring energy and i will inject it in my veins to recreate the feeling of being on the train in the springtime

**runaway3212** (10): I don't want this to win but it is a 10

**sandyfishnets** (10): WOW

**seanderlust** (10): i feel there will be enough crj antis rating this that i don't have to rate this lower than i want to to balance things out. so i feel safe in saying this is one of the easiest 10s in this rate. inject this shit directly into my arteries.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): arguably one of her best song

**skargardin** (10): this is FOUR years old

**slimboyfriend** (10): It sounds like summer

**starlitsuns** (10): WE STAN EUPHORIC BOPS

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Get yourself a fav whose C-sides are better than most peoples A-sides

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): basic white gay

**TheEvilNightman** (10): Carly Rae Jepsen is a national treasure. I don't care if she's Canadian.

**TiltControls** (10): I love the song, but it would be a bit of a predictable winner. And cause of that I doubt it's winning.

**timothy444** (10): Carly Rae Jepsen peaked here

**camerinian** (9.5): this song is basically perfect, but kind of in a boring way tbh. Like, yes, it's magical and euphoric and it's a Carly song to a T.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I can‚Äôt not have fun whenever I listen to this, it‚Äôs pure joy. The only reason it‚Äôs not a 10 is that I think the production is not as interesting and fresh as other recent Carly songs.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Another instance of me giving a 9 to a song I love but don't want to win. Watch me regret it not rating it lower.

**NFLfreak98** (9): Not one of Carly‚Äôs best songs, but the chorus is undeniable

**Yatcho** (9): boppy, euphoric, happy, etc. She's not stretching herself artistically at all but w/e

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): the chorus is euphoric for sure but the straining of her voice and the verses/bridge don‚Äôt make this one of her best songs for me (which a lot of people say it is).

**steelstepladder** (8.5): This is the lowest I can give her, I tried to go lower and I can't

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): this is what crj uses her sword for

**Stryxen** (8): honestly only reason it's not a 10 is cos the final chorus doesn‚Äôt hit the same

**waluigiest** (8): I know people love this song but I don‚Äôt get quite as nuts over i, even as a Carly Stan. It is a solid pop song. I must say seeing it live with Mark Kanemura doing his famous wig reveals was a transformational experience.

**wryn\_** (8): it finally clicked for me!! yes!!!!

**akanewasright** (7): If this wins I will personally kill CarlieScion.

**bbfan132** (7): kind of sick of this ngl

**Flegasaurus** (7): me after cutting to the feeling

**kappyko** (7): there's some awkwardness to this that prevents me loving it now

**letsallpoo** (7): this really needed a proper prechorus and a bridge that doesnt rhyme "all the way" with "all the way"

**linothy** (7): i kinda have to like this bc i grew up with this song, but i probably wouldn't listen to it voluntarily because it's not too swag

**nooodisaster** (7): Someone really wanted to win lmao.

TragicKingdom1: **anothertown** (6): it sounds like movie credits music, because it is!

**freav** (6): I love Carly ofc but this is probably her weakest song from the Emotion era, it's fine I guess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): every time i do a rate and end up having to do a carly song i feel bad bc everytime i listen to it and absolutely fail to understand what makes her so beloved on this sub. i don't think carly is a bad artist, she makes decent music and has some songs that i really love, but for the most part, her songs are generic and there are plenty of artists out there who do what she does just as good if not better. she's nowhere near as innovative as her fans claim she is and if anything seeing the constant phrase for her has made me start to dislike her music. sorry for the rant but her popularity just baffles me

**wavingwolves** (6): this is cute but i don't the overwhelming love for it when carly has a lot better

**JunkyGS** (5): i dont trust yall to not let this win.....

**SRTviper** (5): Including CRJ is cheating. And of all her songs, this one sounds like drinking milk.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Atrocious song with an equally atrocious MV

**ManofOranges** (1): Ok, I know this is definitely gonna be a controversial opinion because I know a lot of people on this sub would kick it with a squirrel if it played some Carly--don't get me wrong, I would too--but I'm over this song. I liked it when it first came out, but after all this time, my enjoyment of this song has waned completely. It just does nothing for me at all, and every single time it comes on, I skip it. It doesn't help that on the chorus for this song, Carly's vocals are kind of annoying. Especially when she's yelling "I WANNA CUT TO THE FEELING" like damn. This song is a b-side of a b-side of a b-side of a b-side to me. Sorry to everyone who loves this song and sorry to Carly, but that's my opinion.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): In all honesty, Cut to the Feeling is not an awful song. But I have a history with this song. Back when I first started browsing popheads, it was also the time this song was just being released. I hadn't heard a Carly song other than Call Me Maybe at the time, but all the hype towards her on the sub got me involved in the hype too. Then when the song released, i was.... severely underwhelmed. I thought "this is it? The most amazing thing popheads knows?" People in the comments seemed to love the track, so I assumed that it just meant Carly wasn't the artist for me. And so I avoided listening to anything else from her for over a YEAR. I tried relistening to CTTF a few times over that period, but that just made me like it even less. It feels so cliche, so overly happy, sickeningly sweet. I couldn't stand it anymore, and I had the impression that this was what all Carly sounded like. Then, through complete chance, I saw a video by Mic the Snare called " 'Run Away With Me' by Carly Rae Jepsen: The Best Pop Song of the Century". It got my interest, and I was shocked to discover that, yes, Run Away With Me IS in fact an amazing song. And more importantly, I also realised CRJ was more than just the sound of CTTF. So I quickly went and listened to Emotion, and loved it. Now, I also love Dedicated, both the Side B's, and am happy to call myself a CRJ fan. I still can't stand this track, because it made me think this was all Carly had.

A very worthy winner!!! I'm an open defender of the Ritt Momney cover of this song that smashed on TikTok, but I'm still well aware of the fact that this is the superior version. It captures the very specific sense of folksy wholesomeness that existed in 00s adult contemporary better than any other song from that era. Submitted by /u/letsallpoo.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): this song feels like a long hug <3 im giving this my 11 and hoping we get three black women rate winners this month

**fadedblue09** (11): God I just live for this 2000's coffeehouse singer-songwriter pop. We need more music that balances happy, catchy melodies and soulful delivery. Also, that Ritt Momney cover is awful btw. The only valid male cover of this is DAY6's.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): a perfect song

**moooo566** (11): oh man the nostalgia hit on this, remember when this was on the radio and you were like 12 and the world wasn't terrible yet? feels good

**musical\_pyn** (11): Just a perfect, perfect song

**rickikardashian** (11): not only will we have to deal with this song very possibly getting robbed, but also with a bunch of comments mentioning the r\*tt m*mney version

**sirpancakeXI** (11): the superior version, Ritt Momney who??? but seriously this song is just emotional and relaxing at the same time

**1998tweety** (10): Masterpiece

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song deserved better than being covered by a guy called "Ritt Monmey"

**anothertown** (10): sapphire and faded jeans!!! I hope you get your dreams!!!

**astrologicalangel** (10): this song feels like a warm hug

**bbfan132** (10): such a relaxing song to listen and sing along to

**CarlieScion** (10): this feels like chilling on a cloud

**celladonn** (10): I had actually never heard the original before but this is so warm and so much better than the Rtt Mmney version

**endcreditouilles** (10): will never not sing this at the top of my lungs in the shower

**fallenriot** (10): certified iconic song, scalped ritt momney

**FKJVMMP** (10): Where‚Äôs the good version though?

**Flegasaurus** (10): its perfect

**frogaranaman** (10): there‚Äôs about to be a lot of insufferable comments about Ritt Momney on this song isn‚Äôt there

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I have a special connection to this one because I heard it all the time as a kid and my dad would always reference it whenever we were leaving the house because I had two sisters so he‚Äôd say ‚Äúgirls put your sweatshirts on‚Äù to the tune of the song. I want Corinne to release new music!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a classic and don‚Äôt stream Ritt Momney!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I wonder how many comments complaining about how many ritt momney comments there are there are

**intheaftermath** (10): the politician cover just doesn't cut it.

**jsonphile** (10): such a great laid back song. Sure would be a shame if some dorky white guy who can‚Äôt sing tried to do some boring slow ass cover of this amazing song

**kappyko** (10): this is going to win

**ManofOranges** (10): Bop

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): what SHOULD be our rate winner

**nbapip** (10): this will never age

**NFLfreak98** (10): Mitt Romney had a better year than Ritt Momney in 2020

**nootnoot781** (10): if this isn‚Äôt top 2 shut this sub down <3

**pat-rickstar** (10): I had somehow never heard this song before, and only knew about it from the anti-circlejerk over that cover (which I also haven't heard), but it's such a delight! This is like, pure sunshine in song form

**ReallyCreative** (10): This is one of those songs that can just lift your mood no matter what, and ONLY Ms. Bailey Rae could do what was done here.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I‚Äôm not making the same mistake I made in All Stars 4 with Natasha Bedingfield‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnwritten‚Äù; giving a genuinely good, fun song a mediocre score because 2000s overplay ruined it for me. This hits the spot for sunny feel-good pop just as well, but while Unwritten is unabashedly cheesy (which is valid) this is a slice of sophistication. In 2006 I found it boring, in 2021 it‚Äôs refreshing. Her vocal delivery just glides and the hook is timeless.

**sandyfishnets** (10): her voice is perfection.

**seanderlust** (10): this song is like a weighted blanket. it is the feeling that everything is going to be okay.

**skargardin** (10): mitt romney's cover of this is the biggest pile of shit.

**Stryxen** (10): nah cos this can literally make me cry

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): when she said put your records on she meant put this record on instead of ritt momney

**timothy444** (10): I want to talk about something that has happened way too much in 2020. No it's not Donald Trump saying something stupid or the amount of anti-vaxxers protesting like idiots, it's the amount of "nostalgia" that modern pop songs keep trying to insert into their songs. I'm talking to you Kygo (What's Love Got to Do With It), Nea (Some Say), Ava Max (My Head & My Heart), and especially you Mitt Romney. Yeah, I get that it's a good song too but we didn't ask for a boring ass version of Put Your Records On. It's almost as terrible as that Calum Scott cover of Dancing on my Own. It has the same energy has Someone You Loved too. Screw you Mitt Romney for butchering this masterpiece.

**waluigiest** (10): one of the most feel-good songs of all time. I hear this and get transported to being a child, going to the car wash with my mom. Idk why that particular memory is so strong

**wavingwolves** (10): this brings me pure happiness

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I just had one of those ‚ÄúHey, I know this song!‚Äù moments. Feels nice to finally put an artist and title to this track.

**akanewasright** (9.5): What a lovely song

**bigbigbee** (9.5): It conjures up a memory of driving to school with my mom on a spring morning. I love how soothing this is.

**kirby31200** (9.5): Few songs capture summer like this one does

**Yatcho** (9.5): White mom's everywhere got their life to this one... it's me im White Moms

**camerinian** (9): One of the all time cute bops. I don't really ever seek this out but it is just such a mood brightener every time it's on

**linothy** (9): her voice slaps so fucking hard amen i fucking love this song FUCK yes

**Mysario** (9): rItT mOmNeY

**SRTviper** (9): So sweet and smooth. My sinuses are clear, my jaw is unclenched.

**Tolk1en** (9): This song has deep Animal Crossing vibes, I love it

**nooodisaster** (8.5): An absolute classic, I know that's right! Wholesome vibes.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): a million times better than the other guy who covered this song. wtf kind of name is ritt momney anyway

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A vibe

**Roxieloxie** (8): this song is very inoffensive and for popheads, i would not be mad if it one, but personally i would not enjoy very much

**runaway3212** (8): 'More like Girl Put Your Records ONE' - Somebody with zero taste

**steelstepladder** (8): I started this and I expected to hear the Ritt Momney version I hate myself

**wryn\_** (8): omg why do i lowkey like that dumbass mitt romney version more? racism? misogyny? britphobia? just a total lack of taste? all 4?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): For some reason, this reminds me a little of the Animal Crossing New Horizons theme song

**plastichaxan** (7): this just confirms my theory that the tik tok people are tasteless and will let male versions or daycore versions of songs get much popular than the superior versions

**TheEvilNightman** (7): Trash. I like my "Put Your Records On" by a white guy with a spoonerism of of a failed presidental candidate as his stagename. Don't worry y'all, tis a joke.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I can't take this song seriously anymore

**fishingfor8** (5): this is kinda annoying. Ritt momney >

TiltControls: Thanks to TK for hosting and the mods for organizing this event!

Got updates to the [leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180)!

**Songs**

looks like popheads chose to avoid chaos today

love CTTF! But it winning would have been a messssss

Anyways, Put Your Records On had a solid showing (especially for a grabbag) and is 78/110 of the winners and #193 overall

~~and shelter deserved day 3~~

**Artists**

Kid Cudi and Missy Elliott have enough songs ranked now for tracking! (though these are mostly due to features)

Kid Cudi's got a total 8.162 average (enough to land him at #17) and Missy Elliott's got a 7.699 average (#74)
Kid Cudi also joins the ranks of artists to never recieve a 0!

also for Carly fans sad about losing (if you're out there) CTTF making it so far means Carly now has more 11's than Lana (and takes over 3rd place for 11's!)

**Rates**

Charity Rate III had the highest average of the three charity rates!

It also got on the leaderboard for the percent of songs to recieve an 11 (#7) and percent of 11's given out (#5)! I'm glad a lot of people found things they liked from an eclectic mix of songs

**Other things**

I've got a songlist-related update that I may post tomorrow in a post or the DD so be on the lookout for that!
