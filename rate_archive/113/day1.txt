Charity Rate III Reveal, Day 1 - You Don't Understand My Pain
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/lt3nds/charity_rate_iii_reveal_day_1_you_dont_understand/

Welcome everyone to Day 1 of the Charity Rate III reveal!

In case you're totally out of the loop, back in October we held a charity drive and people could donate $15 to get pretty much any song into this rate. As such, the selection ended up being quite eclectic, with many songs getting high controversy scores and the overall rankings fluctuating with each ballot.

* We will be revealing **#51 through #35** today.
* [104 people](https://pastebin.com/9p4ssckm) did the rate. We (but mostly I) love to see it!
* The overall average score was a **7.238.** I'm too lazy to look up how this compares to the previous charity rates.
* The average controversy score was a **2.044.**

It's the highest average of the three! (I'm guessing  this is partially due to not being ~~subjected to~~ blessed with anything like On My Own or Earth this time around)

I enjoy this more than Cellophane. Submitted by /u/bbfan132.

---

**bbfan132** (11): i mean of course i had to give this my 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): i’m just here to raise the controversy score

**anothertown** (9): I think this is kind of genius, I'll probably never listen to it again though lol

**plastichaxan** (9): i know this isn't close to a 9, in fact i was originally going to give this around a 5, then i thought to give it a 10 cause i can't stand the thought of fka twigs having a first eliminated song on a rate but i can't really give this a 10 so...yeah...

**vayyiqra** (9): Idk what this even is or why it exists but I like it somehow in spite of his weird squeaky vocals

**Yatcho** (9): twigs is SO good she completely washed him at his own style, she actually sounds amazing like this. 645ar well... he was there

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): The high pitched voice is a bit much, but I don’t understand liking hyperpop and hating this. Twigs elevates everything she touches.

**camerinian** (8): I hate that hyperpop has poisoned me so badly to the extent that I really vibe with this

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): I heard this song while in a listening party while i was supposed to be in class and let me tell you, hearing this for the first time with your camera on when you're not expecting it is an experience , many thoughts head full however you just have to stay like :| anyway the song is short enough i cant hate it too much

**akanewasright** (7.5): Yeah this is solid. I’ve heard worse from him before

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): This song does bop hard, and Twigs' part is so good, but i CANNOT take it seriously whenever 645 sings...

**starlitsuns** (7): how do we pronounce 645AR? is it EAGAR? this is “the artist formerly known as prince” levels of annoying

**chihuahuazero** (6.5): FKA Twigs is what makes this song work. There's enough alternating between Twig's high register and 645AR's signature squeak that he demonstrates that it's more than a gimmick. Maybe one day I will get into the rest of his music?

**intheaftermath** (6.5): animal crossing energy?

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): a song i guess

**AHSWeeknd** (6): love Twigs till the end of time but this ain’t it

**fishingfor8** (6): definitely hyperpop adjacent at the very least and im not a huge fan of most hyperpop but this fine i guess? I like the beat switch at the end.

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): This isn’t doing anything for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): this was made for people who aren’t me, I’ve heard this kind of sound done well but this doesn’t strike me as anything very special

**kirby31200** (5): I've found my limit. No amount of Pitchfork praise can make that voice tolerable. Everything else is nice though

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): It’s an 8 for FKA twigs’ part but a 2 for the other guy’s part

**rickikardashian** (5): i feel like i should dislike this more than i do

**sarcasticsobs** (5): well i liked twigs

**Stryxen** (5): i still don’t get it lol stream emily montes

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): twigs sounds good on this, but I can't take this song seriously with the big titty anime cat girl voice she's duetting with

**fadedblue09** (4): Girl I love you but wtf was this. I can't stand this chipmunk-rap.

**fallenriot** (4): twigs’ voice is beautiful as always but I hate the overly distorted vocals for the rest of it

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I actually really like Twigs part but yeah I’m still not on the 645AR train lmao

**letsallpoo** (4): my twigs goodwill has its limits

**pat-rickstar** (4): I listen to hyperpop so I can’t really talk but I do not get the appeal of this man AT ALL, Twigs is the only thing making this at least listenable, so these 4 points are all for Twigs only

**wryn\_** (4): no offence but why did this happen

**celladonn** (3.5): I'm usually into this kind of chipmunked vocals meme nonsense but this is a bit much even for me

**runaway3212** (3.5): oh god this song is annoying

**1998tweety** (3): I like Twigs but this man is awful

**2dina3dworld** (3): this sounds like a mix between soundcloud rap and vocaloid, and both of those are very hit or miss. Combined here, both components are a miss.

**bulforster** (3): I can't process this, but twigs deserves a point or two.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (3): i HATE HATE that high pitch effect

**pheromenos** (3): god what's with the high-pitched voices

**sandyfishnets** (3): what pitch is this.

**skargardin** (3): this is a miss

**Flegasaurus** (2): is this alvin and the chipmunks

**ReallyCreative** (2): Beaker from the Muppets SNAPPED

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): they listened to this and didnt think it was annoying?

**wavingwolves** (2): grimes sounds great in this

**SRTviper** (1.6): I just cant do it yall. I just cant.

**CritneySpearz** (1): ANYWAYS... we're going to pretend we did not HEAR THAT

**endcreditouilles** (1): this song would be so good if it weren't for those squeaky high vocals, it just makes it unlistenable for me.

**JunkyGS** (1): Gen Z come pick up your man....

**linothy** (1): no What Is This the voice is so annoying

**ManofOranges** (1): No words...

**timothy444** (1): Sincerely hopes this goes out on Day 1

**Brendon-Urine** (0): I appreciate that they tried something. I really do. But no.

**CarlieScion** (0): quite possibly the worst song ive ever had to sit through. it was only 2 minutes but felt like literal hours

**FKJVMMP** (0): Pitch shifting is not the same thing as personality. Or talent.

**frogaranaman** (0): uh

**ImADudeDuh** (0): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE6epACmPz4

**Mysario** (0): 645ar is a plague

**NFLfreak98** (0): Is mosquito an art direction?

**nooodisaster** (0): i love alvin & the chipmunks

**seanderlust** (0): during the call and response part where he repeats the lines she sings, why does it sound like he's making fun of her?

**sirpancakeXI** (0): What is this mess. Why are they singing in animal crossing voice?? If i want to listen to these kind of voice i would have just go listen to bubblegum KK

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I'm sorry but I cannot get into helium-voice-man. It's just not for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): im sorry the singing in this genuinely makes my ears hurt who thought this was a good idea

**Tolk1en** (0): I may have no taste but my ears are bleeding sorry

**waluigiest** (0): sorry but I can’t

My expectations were low and they were met. My main problem with this song is that culturally doing a big clean is more of a spring thing than a winter thing but maybe it makes sense in the context of the show. Submitted by /u/timothy444.

---

**timothy444** (11): Even though it's from a children's television show, Winter Wrap Up is the epitome of what a catchy pop song should be. Sure the lyrics are about cleaning up Ponyville to transition from one season to the next but the structure, melody and elements of this banger serves up a fine example on pure songwriting mastery.

**1998tweety** (10): BOP, not the song I would've picked from the show but a 10 nonetheless

**2dina3dworld** (10): the kiddies in my family love My Little Pony, and I have a major soft spot for MLP. Thus, the 10.

**Flegasaurus** (10): LSMFLKNFSMJXLM

**Mysario** (10): when Netflix drops the documentary, bronies are gonna be looked back on in 5 years as being bullied by the culture

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): My Little Pony outsold all your faves

**intheaftermath** (9): It's good, but it's no Babs Seed or This Day Aria

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): why listen to peppa pig when we have my little pony

**anothertown** (8): murdered elsa in cold blood

**nooodisaster** (8): i love frozen

**starlitsuns** (7.9): okay who is the brony who submitted this because you are completely valid but my little pony? in this non-meme rate? a bold choice but I can appreciate it

**astrologicalangel** (7): I have not listened to this in so long but it still goes off

**steelstepladder** (7): Discord would have gotten a 10

**Tolk1en** (7): I have absolutely no idea how to rate this

**Yatcho** (7): alright generic musical song.. will ignore that its my little pony

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): Im in no position to bully anyone here I almost sent in a song from Steven Universe, had it not been for Estelle winning the last charity rate. however this does not bop as hard as i wish it would. its cute though

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I actually like most MLP songs I’ve heard, and I have a high tolerance for Musical Theater Bullshit in general. But while some parts of the melody here are really pretty, overall this feels underwritten to me; I feel like the chorus could be a lot better, the lyrics are just a little too obviously Kids Show, and it doesn’t build well in the final chorus, especially for an ensemble song.

**bulforster** (6.5): Not mad at it but the chorus could go a bit harder tbh, not enough contrast with the verses.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): *Steven Universe* vs. *Adventure Time* vs. *MLP:FiM* rate when?

**kirby31200** (6.5): I can imagine this being a minor part of an overall good musical, but on its own its not fantastic.

**akanewasright** (6): This is fine

**jsonphile** (6): uhhhhhh ???? I don’t know what to say about this

**rotating3Dtext** (6): i can’t believe you made everypony listen to this

**seanderlust** (6): today popheads asks itself, "is winter wrapup from my little pony better than this will be an everlasting love by natalie cole? :pensive:"

**TiltControls** (6): it's sweet i guess

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't remember this being on the Frozen soundtrack

**wavingwolves** (6): this is good, actually

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): It’s a cute little song I guess.

**chihuahuazero** (5): This is unrelated to this song's quality, but I hope that one brony from my high school didn't end up being radicalized into the alt-right.

**frogaranaman** (5): I am giving a neutral score so I do not have to give an opinion on this

**hikkaru** (5): i wish this was D11scord instead

**ManofOranges** (5): Whoever submitted this, you are hella wrong for making me scrobble this omg.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): This is alright, but like, I'd never listen to it because I chose to

**wryn\_** (5): i spend most of my energy trying to make myself forget that my best friend is a brony so any time i have to think about MLP i feel awful

**SRTviper** (4.8): Still better than Tame Impala

**camerinian** (4): Y’all the brony phenomenon was weird, like there is no reason there should have been a fandom that feverish for such an adequate kids show with such run-of-the-mill kids show music. Like this is fine for what it is, but why would you want to listen to this on its own?

**sarcasticsobs** (4): cackling at this inclusion

**rickikardashian** (3): you should have sent the living tombstone remix of jenny nicholson’s pinky pie bard

**slimboyfriend** (3): I went private to listen to this song and it wasn't even worth it

**Stryxen** (3): please not this

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2.6): can someone more clever than me insert a brony joke here

**bbfan132** (2): i support the choice but this was so boring rip

**CritneySpearz** (2): “it’s winter we must clean” bye girl, I’m too depressed for that

**ignitethephoenix** (2): why

**linothy** (2): hey babe absolutely not but also why does this slap more than some of the other songs

**pat-rickstar** (2): This song is annoying, sorry. But also, me on Winter 28 in Stardew Valley:

**pheromenos** (2): ew what

**waluigiest** (2): I apologize I can’t engage with this

**NFLfreak98** (1.5): Uh. No?

**LazyDayLullaby** (1.2): Nay

**AHSWeeknd** (1): If you remove the My Little Pony association from this then theatre kids would eat it up.

**Brendon-Urine** (1): I thought this was from Frozen until they said pony

**CarlieScion** (1): no

**FKJVMMP** (1): The internet has ruined this.

**Jackalope117** (1): why

**moooo566** (1): if only i had a second zero

**plastichaxan** (1): uhhh

**Saison\_Marguerite** (1): Of the cartoon performers in this rate, K.K. Slider outsold by far

**skargardin** (1): .

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): im not letting the bronies win this rate

**cremeebrulee** (0): this isn’t discord (which is a 10)

**endcreditouilles** (0): putting this in the playlist between Mon Laferte and Natalie Cole has me dying laughing, you're doing amazing sweetie

**fadedblue09** (0): Imagine having winter lmao.

I welcome meme songs of all kinds to these charity rates BUT this one overstays its welcome by a longshot. I don't have an inherent problem with an hour-long song but please do SOMETHING with that time. This is just the same droning riff on repeat. /u/mysario really knows how to troll me and I hate it!!

---

**FKJVMMP** (11): I’d feel like I wasted my life if I sat through that whole goddamn thing and gave it a lower score than that. Vocals are impressively difficult to understand for such a slow song where the guy’s not screaming, and I’m impressed at the guitarist’s patience waiting 14 minutes to do anything even mildly interesting.

**Flegasaurus** (11): holy fucking shit

**bbfan132** (10): listened to all 63 minutes and although it’s repetitive, i feel like it deserves a perfect score

**berober04** (10): So I listened to the whole thing. This is just the real music song by Batman in the Lego Movie spread over a whole hour.

**CarlieScion** (10): i did not listen to this

**fadedblue09** (10): Honestly this feels like epic final boss game music that is set in a desert and very fitting since it's the last song I listened to. The break in the middle was cute and the guitar solos were fun too. Y'all are gonna slander this when some of you probably listen to something hideous like Ultraviolence on loop. I see u popheads!

**frogaranaman** (10): I’m not listening to this song sober so I am going off memory, but also I am giving this a 10 for a higher controversy score

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thank you

**intheaftermath** (10): I am confused but I enjoyed it!

**moooo566** (10): wish all rates had hour long doom metal closers, would be a major improvement

**Mysario** (10): https://youtu.be/35FIlsGkLPc

**nooodisaster** (10): Screaming at the fact Spotify pays them 0.05 cents per listen of this.

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): I didn’t listen to it but I bet it’s amazing

**wavingwolves** (10): this will be a 0 magnet but it's good and shouldn't be the bottom song!!!!! give it to the other 0 magnets!!!

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I like the part with the guitar.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): https://i.gifer.com/KKwF.gif

**sarcasticsobs** (8): some sick little freak added this classic to this rate and i love that fact

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): "Oh haha, I'm gonna make everyone listen to this hour-long song." Well, joke's on you because I actually LIKED it.

**seanderlust** (7.6): you know what, time for me to be Brave by Sara Bareilles. this song is going to get demolished, and i get why, but i am fully a Dopesmoker apologist. the lyrics are not great and it being an hour long is unnecessary, but GOD the instrumentals are fantastic. it's not my favorite song on the list and stoner metal is not a genre i frequent very often, but next time i'm stoned and playing CoD or another aggressively heterosexual video game, i'll probably pull it up in the background on spotify.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I don’t hate it.

**camerinian** (7.5): I… I'm still trying to unpack this because God knows I'm not listening to it again. I think I wasn't getting it for the first 20 minutes, started understanding the vibe after that, really got what it was doing at that fadeout at 42 minutes, and then I started feeling really uneasy with it from 50 minutes onwards, which I don't know if that was the point cos it's doom metal? But it felt like I was greening out and getting paranoid and was dead sober listening to it so maybe that's a desired effect? I'm gonna need to sit with this, and by sit with it I mean maybe try listen to it again blazed out of my fucking mind because I listened to this on a ferry and mild seasickness is not the same buzz as being high

**Jackalope117** (7): ngl I only listened to about 6 minutes of this but its actually pretty decent. Way better than 80% of this list.

**steelstepladder** (7): I'm being generous

**whatsanillinois** (7): i really want to give my 0 for whoever put an hour-long song on here but cmon, it's good.

=====

TragicKingdom1: **jsonphile** (6.5): feels a little short, could’ve been a bit longer

**MelodramaticLemonade** (6.5): If you start this from the 39-minute mark you probably wouldn't have missed anything, but from that point onwards it's a monstrous track with insanely energetic guitar riffs. Just wish it was trimmed though

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): This is surprisingly not that bad to me. It's much less abrasive than I expected it to be. My one knit is that it was incredibly repetitive. Maybe I need to actually get high before hearing it next time

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.3): One point for every 10 minutes

**cremeebrulee** (6): i genuinely dont know how i feel about this (fwiw i made it liek 10 minutes through before giving up)

**2dina3dworld** (5): I like doom metal, however, this song shows that sometimes "less is more"

**AHSWeeknd** (5): I’m not reading all of that. But I’m happy for you, or sad. — it honestly sounds so one-note all the way through though, like c’mon people switch it up give us some bongos or something.

**astrologicalangel** (5): I want to rate this higher, but I couldn't even get through half of it

**fallenriot** (5): I’m sure it’s lovely but I will not be listening to all of that, 6 minutes is the best I can do. Sorry to this man

**kappyko** (5): too lazy to listen srry

**musical\_pyn** (5): i want a participation trophy for listening to this song

**NapsAndNetflix** (5): curious how many people will listen to this whole thing

**nootnoot781** (5): played it in 2x speed bc i want to listen to it but i also don’t want to spend an hour of my life rating 1 song for a rate.

**rotating3Dtext** (5): i’m not listening to an hour of this i’m so sorry

**sirpancakeXI** (5): giving this a neutral score coz i am NOT going to listen to an hour long song.

**TheEvilNightman** (5): This, uh, is a song alright.

**wryn\_** (5): if only one person rates this and gives it an 11 will it count as a win? im scared

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.7): I gave this a score based on what percentage of the track I got through. I listened to half an hour before I started feeling I was wasting my time.

**bigbigbee** (4.5): I actually listened to this. I like ambient metal. I took points off for being so long in a rate context, and because I think the vocal parts of this are really annoying and jarring. The instrumentals are nice though. It’s good study music.

**rickikardashian** (4.5): instead of listening to this, i watched the latest drag race episode and based my score off of that

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): I got through the first 30 mins and I stopped listening lol. Don't hate it, don't love it, just never wanna listen to it again

**1998tweety** (4): i will drop a generous 4 on this and be on my way

**ReallyCreative** (4): The first half of this is just... bad. There's really nothing to engage with here on any level, and any time the song sounds like its going somewhere, it basically resets. However, the back half of this song is a lot more interesting and honestly, makes pretty good background music. Overall? There's worse in this rate. It will eat a few undeserved 0s, or maybe deserved because it's an hour+ of my life I will not be getting back

**runaway3212** (4): Disclaimer I did not listen to this, thanks bigbigbee for giving me a review where she also gave it a 4 I'm just copying her

**Tolk1en** (4): TLDL please

**vayyiqra** (4): I listened to the whole thing just to say I did and all I can say is: lol

**waluigiest** (4): I didn’t hate it! I really don’t hate it!

**fishingfor8** (3): bruh

**sandyfishnets** (3): the cymbal crashing and guitar riffs are kinda cool but his voice is a no for me. About 40 mins in it chills down a bit, that's probs my fave part of the song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i don’t know why i made myself listen to the full hour of this. i should’ve known from the first 5 minutes being the same that the whole track would sound like this but foolishly expected something to change. i’m giving it a 3 for the respect i have that they were even able to make an hour long track but as a song itself it’s a 1.

**Yatcho** (3): who has time for all that

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2): this could have been something if it wasn't so fucking long

**kirby31200** (2): I listened to more of this than it probably deserved. "Marijuanaut" is now part of my vocabulary forever

**Roxieloxie** (2): Well shit maybe i should've submitted the 11 minute fela song if thats what we're doing

**NFLfreak98** (1.5): It has 2 or 3 good moments, absolutely buried in a guitar hitting one note and a guy yelling something unintelligible. Yeah I listened to the whole thing, and no I don’t know why

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Sorry, but no.

**endcreditouilles** (1): sorry I just can't ty for trying

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I listened to this all the way through and it’s bad, I think even for this genre this is bad. Just listen to *Pelagial* by The Ocean instead.

**linothy** (1): im not listening to this goodbye

**nbapip** (1): nah sorry

**pat-rickstar** (1): I'm 45 minutes in and it feels like I've just been listening to the same thing over and over again, why is nothing happening? Update: I listened to the whole thing and it was so boring

**RandomHypnotica** (1): Look, I'm sure this has an audience that appreciates it. But popheads is not that place

**starlitsuns** (1): confession: I didn’t listen to any of this, mostly because I don’t feel like writing album-length songs is a good idea. Hence, I didn’t give this my zero because I didn’t listen to it and felt bad giving it a zero.

**Stryxen** (1): I made a passive aggressive comment about popheads not giving a chance to long songs in daily discussion so i tried and nah I’m just like the rest of you. Impossible soul is my limit

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): it's 3am and i have work in 3 hours i will be having a different kind of Sleep thank you

**brenda\_official** (0): who did this

**bulforster** (0): https://imgur.com/gallery/1c7CBOS

**hikkaru** (0): yes i listened to it all it's boring as shit

**ignitethephoenix** (0): you know I was going to go into an open mind with this song with it being an hour long but this goes by so slowly and when the vocals kick in....it’s just not for me. Curse you u/mysario !!

**ManofOranges** (0): I am NOT listening to ALL that, but from the parts that I DID listen to, this gets my 0 anyway. I'm not sorry!

**plastichaxan** (0): i can't even calculate the percentage of this that i actually listened to nor do i intend to remember those boring minutes of my life

**skargardin** (0): I value my time well enough to simply not listen to this and as thus it's getting my zero. The cover art is cool though.

**SRTviper** (0): fuk u

**TiltControls** (0): let it be known that I did actually listen to 45 minutes of this before giving it my 0

I'm guessing this is a pride anthem? The production is really blandly loud to me, but otherwise it serves its purpose. Submitted by /u/kirby31200.

---

**pheromenos** (9.3): never heard of this band before but this is ridiculously good! i'm not sure if it qualifies as hyperpop, but i'm digging the sound nonetheless.

**ManofOranges** (9): Ok, I'm not a big fan of their name but this is a hit.

**astrologicalangel** (8.5): not exactly what I was expecting based off that album cover but I enjoyed it

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): c’mon teletubby, teleport us to PLANET BOOTY

**kirby31200** (8.5): I will be a little hurt, especially since I went out of my way to choose one of their pride songs given the charity, if this leaves day 1, but it's up against some very tough competition. I do love this song and if you like this even a little bit check out more from them! Futuresweat, Naked, and Guilty Pleasure are all great projects.

**fallenriot** (8): is it just basic synthpop? Yeah but I’m gay so

**FKJVMMP** (8): Feel like these guys would do wonders with a proper production budget.

**nooodisaster** (8): The lyrics are actually really sweet and wholesome, if on the nose. Internalized homophobia and bottom-shaming is gonna tank this.

**timothy444** (8): Pretty good pop song

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): this lowkey slaps

**anothertown** (7): big time rush got good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This sounds like a song that would play at the end of a movie musical made by Wolfe Productions… not bad though, just generic. Appreciate the spirit I guess

**runaway3212** (7): For a song by 'planet booty this is pretty solid'

**waluigiest** (7): planet booty thee activist

**hikkaru** (6.5): bye i kinda bopped to this dsfjkdsjflkdsjkl

**1998tweety** (6): there are things i like and dislike about this song but i dont have the words to do it, so i hope someone else did

**AHSWeeknd** (6): this is so nice, but these vocals…

**ImADudeDuh** (6): for a song by an artist called “planet booty” i expected worse

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): I really thought this was just a generic party song until I heard the second verse, which isn’t the best for a serious song about homophobia. It’s not great but I like how it’s giving us early 2010’s pop realness.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): It’s not that good but also completely inoffensive.

**seanderlust** (6): https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20190619-XJiYEQjTEOn2CStKmeeA?auto=format&q=60&w=1280&s=5282dac99fabeab5922c76decff5f3b0

**TheEvilNightman** (6): That's a ten for the message and a two for the production.

**Tolk1en** (6): the "idea" behind the song feels interesting but unfortunately the song is kinda boring and repetitive

**vayyiqra** (6): This isn't nearly as bad as Popheads made it out to be. It's incredibly cheesy but its message is kind of wholesome although I didn't like that weird antipsychiatry verse

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): I don't want to judge this song too harshly, because I like the message but sounds a little dated and the lyrics don't punch enough for me. There are some bright moments on this one though.

**freav** (5): unfortunately not a great song, although there's something endearing abut the earnestness of it, really good artist name though!

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this reminds me of AJR but like super off brand. I like the production tho

**linothy** (5): it's too funky LMFAO fuck the funks!!!!!!

**Roxieloxie** (5): im doing this 20 minutes before its due so im not supposed to be adding comments but im sorry this sounds like the song a gay character in a DCOM would sing

**wryn\_** (5): my internalised homophobia reappeared when i saw that cover art

**plastichaxan** (4.5): i can see why the album is called guilty pleasure then...the artwork for it is wonderful too

**camerinian** (4): Look I like the lyrical sentiment but this just sounds yuck, like Panic at the Disco with somehow less taste

**sirpancakeXI** (4): it is repetitive and basic

**SmileAndTears** (4): The production... oh gawd. Talk about an overproduced mess

**2dina3dworld** (3): Nice message, but I can't stand the packaging

**bbfan132** (3): sorry but this was super boring imo

**fadedblue09** (3): Not as bad as I was dreading. But it's still terrible.

**fishingfor8** (3): this was so anti climatic it just kept getting more disappointing. I'm also not a big self empowerment anthem type of person so I was probably put off by that.

**jsonphile** (3): might be a 4 if I didn’t have to see that album cover

**rickikardashian** (3): disney channel original pride anthem

**starlitsuns** (3): Dorian Electra - Ram It Down (feat. Lil Texas, Lil Mariko, & Mood Killer) said the same thing and probably outsold this. stream Ram It Down instead

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sounds like generic retail store music and also im taking extra points off for this song having one of the worst covers ive ever seen

**Brendon-Urine** (2): generic rachel platten level uplifting lyrics, synths sound terrible, not it chief thanks

**kappyko** (2): i think theres gonna be a lot of white gays comments on this and even though theyre not wrong i dont think the general premise of this is awful

**Stryxen** (2): the fuck

**CarlieScion** (1): i hate it here. i am not gay enough to appreciate this

**skargardin** (1): i cackled more than i should have at the planet booty name

**SRTviper** (1): Sorry whoever picked this, but this is not good at all and i want it to stop.

**wavingwolves** (1): stop 🖐️ gay 🏳️‍🌈 people 👥

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): What circuit party bullshit is this? 🚭

**slimboyfriend** (0): I can appreciate the sentiment, but I would never listen to this for fun.

**steelstepladder** (0): Based on the cover art and group name I was expecting something over the top and goofy but this was actually kind of generic

**Yatcho** (0): This is so painfully basic, it sounds like something made up on the spot for a netflix show to avoid paying out royalties

kirby31200: Awwwww. Was hoping it’d stay longer. I knew it wasn’t as good as most of the songs here but I at least thought it’d stay a little longer and not be voted the worst non-shitpost entry. I’m really sorry you didn’t like it guys. 

If anyone did like it, they have a lot of better songs too! I submitted this one since I thought a pride anthem would be in theme with the charity. The best songs are Futuresweat, Not Afraid, Naughty, Das Booty, Galaxy, and Tactile Sensation.

Oh and the name is because they used to be “comedy” band. Their work during that time is really bad but they became a real funk pop band later

This sounds like a Minecraft parody of a straight Panic! At The Disco song, but honestly I didn't hate it lol? I don't think I'd ever listen again because it's so far outside my wheelhouse but it definitely holds your attention. Submitted by /u/McIgglyTuffMuffin.

---

**celladonn** (11): I love theatrical zany evil carnival halloween metal. This gets my 11 as it's my favourite new discovery of the rate

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): This gets a 10 because I did not expect this sound with the few songs I heard from them here and there. This is amazing.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): if it were 2011, 7th grade me would give this an 11 in a heartbeat. even now I thought about it. Avenged Sevenfold still has a most special place in my heart and this song absolutely holds up. (if you just gave this a cursory listen for this rate, you MUST watch the music video and actually follow the story in the lyrics. now. do it.)

**intheaftermath** (10): all 8 minutes of this were amazing??? the choir and ending vocals???? the strings???? ridiculously long and dramatic songs really are my weakness

**Mysario** (10): comedy goldmine

**skargardin** (10): Not to sound too straight but this fucking slaps. Im sure this will be hellishly robbed because it's long and most importantly, includes men

**SRTviper** (10): I was not aware that Avenged Sevenfold made silly show tunes.

**steelstepladder** (10): Wow I'm back in middleschool

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Are they British? Cause they sound British. It’s so cinematic, I like it.

**endcreditouilles** (9): Is this about necrophilia??? idk I love this goofy morbid shit, even if it is 8 minutes

**Flegasaurus** (9): i made dinosaur chicken nuggets and this made my experience much better

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is fun actually, at first I was like “wtf is this” but as it went on I got more into it. Reminds me a lot of those bands made by video game fans or like, Voltaire or something, but a bit less cheesy. Not something I could see myself listening to regularly but definitely enjoyable

**sarcasticsobs** (9): holds up

**TheEvilNightman** (9): This is an X-rated early Panic! at the Disco song. This is certainly going to be ranked super low on the rate, but I love this.

**timothy444** (9): Ok wow, did not expect that from Avenged Sevenfold

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): What in the Final Fantasy x Fall Out Boy is this

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Oh, this kinda goes off, but I can't properly focus on it for 8 minutes.

**FKJVMMP** (8): Parts of this have big ‘Down With The Sickness Domestic Violence Solo’ energy but my little emo heart is full regardless.

**freav** (8): I cant believe this is what Avenged Sevenfold sounds like lol, why does this kinda rule, i mean it's really dumb but the "cause I really always knew" refrain? good shit. Also why does this sound like fucking Helloween lol.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): You're telling me this song isn't part of the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend soundtrack?

**hikkaru** (8): i actually like this lol but it's gonna be like 2nd out i think

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): It’s not my favourite type of music but it’s objectively good and even I liked it at some parts so i'm hoping you guys don’t give it a 1 just because it’s not pop.

**ReallyCreative** (8): if anything this is just a bit too long, I love weird little genre mashups like this

**wavingwolves** (8): please don't let this be a bottom 5 song it doesn't deserve that

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The ending was a LOT better than the begining

**2dina3dworld** (7): I thought this was gonna be bardcore metal. I was let down, but I appreciate the attempt at including that medieval vibe.

**cremeebrulee** (7): i do like some parts of this but WHAT is going on in that music video

**CritneySpearz** (7): wait I didnt hate this like I expected

**ignitethephoenix** (7): is this the straight 30 year old dad Bohemian Rhapsody or Welcome to the Black Parade?

**kirby31200** (7): I'm pretty conflicted here. This really used to be my favorite A7x song in middle school, but now the sex/necrophilia references just kind of makes me cringe, metaphor or not. But it's very great in terms of instrumentation and performance and it's awesome to see live. Apparently, The Rev wrote the piano. RIP

**letsallpoo** (7): i love lazytown

**nooodisaster** (7): the next charity rate im going to submit the 14 minute intro song to Into the Woods and you're gonna like it

**runaway3212** (7): I like this but it's very long

**slimboyfriend** (7): this sounds like MCR but not as angry

**Tolk1en** (7): tbh It's great but I'm really not a fan of the genre

**waluigiest** (7): this is so spooky but also kind of ska

=====

TragicKingdom1: **rickikardashian** (6.5): im getting pissy over the fact that i have to rate an 8 minute song… i dont think im ready to rate the hour-long track

**1998tweety** (6): This is long but not bad tbh

**anothertown** (6): It's an interesting way to go about life that would make one submit this to a popheads rate. This is giving me a Brendon Urie vibe though.

**linothy** (6): 'be more chill' vibes. i could commit crimes to this if it didn't sound so much like a song from a musical

**ManofOranges** (6): I mean, at parts it gets pretty interesting but this song is 8 minutes long and it also kind of scares me a little bit.

**camerinian** (5): this only gets a 5 because I can't decide whether I fucking love how batshit balls to the wall this is or I fucking hate how tacky and pretentious it is, and it really is both at the same time. Put this in All Stars and maybe I'll have my mind made up by then

**frogaranaman** (5): this feels very theater kid

**jsonphile** (5): I like rock but not a huge fan of this sound

**kappyko** (5): i appreciate the grandiosity

**plastichaxan** (5): i used to love this when i was in my rock era, but my rock era was just my closeted era cause...of course...rock is straight in my mind....anyways this is not good

**Yatcho** (5): there were some good parts but it just dragged on too long

**Stryxen** (4.9): what kinda disney villain theme - also i swear i’ve liked avenged sevenfold songs before but this...

**bigbigbee** (4.5): Ugh….so, okay, I like most aspects of this song (I love pop punk), and I would have given this a much higher score if I hadn’t happened to look up the lyrics. I accept that “shitting on a girl who dumped you” is just a part of a lot of older pop punk and I actually don’t have that much of a problem with it in theory, but the violence of this song took me off guard. And I find the “eat it” chanting genuinely unsettling – they REALLY get under my skin (and I wouldn’t have looked up the lyrics if I hadn’t been creeped out by that part of the song, so I feel like you played yourself, Avenged Sevenfold.)

**akanewasright** (4): I think this is pretty cool, actually. I like the drama of it all, and the hook was pretty solid. Unfortunately I first heard it with the video, which made me feel ill. Like... there was gore AND really toxic relationship bullshit. I’m gonna be extra charitable to the song because some people will not be here for 8 minutes and I shouldn’t let that video affect my score negatively. Edit: okay so upon further reflection, the song basically as gross as the video. This was an 8, now I want it to burn in hell

**bbfan132** (4): well at least i finished this song early on in the rate

**CarlieScion** (4): a7x is one of my least favorite bands of all time, sorry not sorry

**fishingfor8** (4): eight minutes of a genre i dont like is a bad combo. Couldve been worse though.

**LazyDayLullaby** (4): The vocals around 1 minute in are too nasally

**starlitsuns** (4): this sounds like musical music but like, kids musical music, which is very different from broadway music if that makes sense

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): wouldn't listen again

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3.5): I’m not even metalphobic but this is Frankensteined from parts that just don’t work for me, from the toxic lyrics to the bits where it sounds like circus music. Some points for attempting epicness.

**seanderlust** (3.2): what kind of angry musical theater kid energy is this

**bulforster** (3): This was already too much for me, idk how people put up with dopesmoker.

**fallenriot** (3): kinda catchy but I don’t usually like murder ballads by men and this is not an exception

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this song said “Metal….. but make it Danny Elfman”

**NFLfreak98** (3): Answers the question: What if P!ATD made a butt rock song?

**TiltControls** (3): It feels like someone added vocals to the boss theme from a video game

**fadedblue09** (2): I do not have any interest in this eternity-long Panic! throwaway.

**Roxieloxie** (2): you want me to listen to an 8 minute rock song thats not by green day?!?!? jk i can enjoy a good long jam but the video and also the content matter of this song is just very 2edgy4me white man who only listens to 'real music' for me to enjoy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i refuse to believe the person who wrote these lyrics was 27 when this came out this sounds like it was written by an edgy 12 year old who saw a saw movie for the first time

**vayyiqra** (2): Yeah sorry I believe in being fair to men and to long songs in rates but this is unbearable to me

**brenda\_official** (1): what people who hate panic at the disco think panic at the disco sound like

**JunkyGS** (1): too long and too straight and too boring

**pat-rickstar** (0): I forced myself to listen to the songs I didn't already know at least 4 times before scoring, meaning I've wasted 32 minutes of my life listening to this. I could at least tolerate some parts of this song, but I did not actively enjoy a single one of those 32 minutes, so this gets my 0. Sorry to whoever submitted this

**sandyfishnets** (0): seven minutes of this!!?!??! no.

**wryn\_** (0): i'm so glad i never listened to my annoying friends when they said to listen to this band

I only know who Jeff Rosenstock is because /u/frogaranaman really wants to rate a full album from him. Based on this I think it would be a better fit for indieheads, but I did enjoy it enough. Submitted by /u/whatsanillinois.

---

**freav** (10): best song on its album, the jangly guitars at the beginning are delightful

**frogaranaman** (10): y’all need to put some respect on Jeff Rosenstock’s name in this sub

**Mysario** (10): no matter its placement, this song will be robbed

**seanderlust** (10): wait but they spilled here

**SRTviper** (10): Skanking to the failure of our socioeconomic system.

**steelstepladder** (10): Jeff Rosenstock vs IDLES vs PUP is COMING

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): I’m a sucker for songs that slowly build up to a climax. He went oooooffffff halfway through the song. I loved it.

**starlitsuns** (9.5): georgenotfound, sapnap, badboyhalo, and sometimes antvenom when dream does anything to help himself win a minecraft manhunt video

**bbfan132** (9): a glorious noisy mess

**camerinian** (8.5): Half of me looks at this entry and thinks, “Of all the Jeff songs you could have chosen to submit, why one of his most lyrically heavy and hook-less, never mind the hardcore breakdown at the end that this sub almost definitely won’t be into?” Meanwhile the other half of me looks at this and thinks, “yeah based”

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.4): 𝕹𝕺 𝕯𝕽𝕰𝕬𝕸

**2dina3dworld** (8): there's something kinda pub rock about this, which is my first hot take. The second hot take is that I thought it was sampling the Friends theme song at first.

**akanewasright** (8): This is... not for me. BUT the bridge made me feel something when I was having a “depression only, no feelings but low” day, so it gets something

**cremeebrulee** (8): omg this literally just escalated SO fast

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw5AR8lLqxU&ab_channel=Jon-El

**Roxieloxie** (8): I kinda like the chaos this creates

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): I’m digging this, I needed more political punk in my life and will be checking the album out

**SmileAndTears** (8): Didn't hate this!

**waluigiest** (8): honestly made some important points

**fallenriot** (7): spill, radicalize popheads

**nooodisaster** (7): oh no its political. i was just gonna rate this low bc men, but the lyrics are a takedown of trump & capitalism & US politics, so good shit.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): I wish I understood better what I just listened to

**Stryxen** (6.5): guys I don’t think it’s a dream

**ImADudeDuh** (6): good message but i hate his voice oof

**kirby31200** (6): I'm scared

**pat-rickstar** (6): I appreciate the message and lyrics of this song, but it doesn't do it for me sonically

**ReallyCreative** (6): Honestly, it's not bad it's just not for me. I don't know if the "bridge" is actually well done or just sloppy though.

**NFLfreak98** (5.7): Jeff could be making a good point here but I would have no idea

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this started okay but then it got so chaotic for me and sigh I don’t love his voice either

**fishingfor8** (5): I've heard a lot of political anthems from indie bands and the chorus is pretty bad

**FKJVMMP** (5): The first half is good. Could have just stopped there.

**jsonphile** (5): well it starts out normal enough and then...?

**sarcasticsobs** (5): not even Critic Approved* pop-punk can do anything for me. this was close but i hated the beginning

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): I know I said don’t give a song a bad score just because it’s not pop earlier, but this is just not good.

**rickikardashian** (4): manually scrobbling this was a bitch

**runaway3212** (4): god this sucks

**sirpancakeXI** (4): why does this sounds like he is singing very far away from the mic

**Tolk1en** (4): wtf is happening :sob: The beginning of the song was a 8-9. Ruined :sob:

**vayyiqra** (4): Again I want to support the men in this rate but they are making it awfully hard to do so

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I fear that half of the indieheads-trade-rate will sound like this

**CarlieScion** (3): why is this man yelling at me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**linothy** (3): why is he yelling at me. no. i really like that it has dream in the title i love dreamwastaken dream minecraft youtuber dream

**skargardin** (3): I was on board until the last minute and a half

**timothy444** (3): Was planning on giving it a 6 because it really just sounded mediocre but then the second half of this song kicked in

**wavingwolves** (3): it's not hitting

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Some lyrics are promising but the song is sadly wasted on such drunk karaoke-level vocals.

**1998tweety** (2): erm..sorry but no

**kappyko** (2): matty sweetie im sorry but this is the worst song on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): at first it was just a normal bad song but then it became a bad bad song

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): This gives me war flashbacks to being a child and my father playing stuff like this in the car… it always made me super uncomfortable and legitimately scared me. Like I’m sorry but the last thing on Earth I want to listen to is a white man screaming at me.

Very quirky, somewhat endearing. I didn't hate it. Submitted by /u/Srtviper.

---

**SRTviper** (11): This song will probably do very poorly but I love it so much. This song has very legitimately made me cry. He just wants to be a cowboy.

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): At first this 10 was in solidarity with SRTviper, but now it's because this is actually really good. F1shb0y

**steelstepladder** (10): I have a soft spot for this Andrew Jackson Jihad type music. Bright Eyes vs Neutral Milk Hotel vs. Mountain Goats when.

**endcreditouilles** (9): I love these messy, brassy, indie jams with a narrative

**freav** (9): hi viper, there are better classic creeps choices but im always team fishboy

**TiltControls** (9): An interesting choice for a popheads rate, but I love it! Rooting for it to do well!

**seanderlust** (8.9): this gives me welcome to nightvale weather segment teas and yes I mean that as a compliment

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): Is the whole album this petty? I’m so here for this.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I cannot believe how much I like this silly little song. But I love it! The narrative is cute, I love waltz time, the moments with the horns are great, and I don’t even mind the indie-voice (though to be fair, I listen to The Mountain Goats for fun).

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this has SUCH a ben platt energy but i really like it tbh??

**astrologicalangel** (8): genuinely thought thus was a song named Fishboy by someone named Allen Moss, featuring Victor

**fishingfor8** (8): this is nonsense but something about it is great

**linothy** (8): very nice mcr vibes, so hot and cool and hot and cool

**nooodisaster** (8): Is this a musical number or is this artist just queer?

**waluigiest** (8): this voice really reminds me of another act? The Postal Service?

**cremeebrulee** (7): a song i would’ve been into like 8 years ago which is not a bad thing but i don’t see myself revisiting it

**Roxieloxie** (7): why does the intro of this sound like a ted-ex video

**akanewasright** (6.9): Not really for me, but it’s cute

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.8): So a Folklore-esque concept of intertwining fictional stories, but if it were about depressed office workers, and sung by a Jeff Mangum sound-alike? A hard sell for Popheads, but I can appreciate the creativity, if not fully enjoy it. Also, how to relate everything to Taylor Swift 101.

**NFLfreak98** (6.5): Sorry SRT, everything about this is cool except the vocals. If fishboy has any instrumental songs I’d probably be into those

**2dina3dworld** (6): capitalism teas

**fadedblue09** (6): That marching band instrumental is a grower but the vocals are annoying.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this is interesting that’s all I’ll say

**ReallyCreative** (6): I just do not like these 2000s indie boy whiny voices, it's not a bad song though

**runaway3212** (6): Not good not bad

**rickikardashian** (5.8): “in 10 years we’d be cowboys, or in 10 years we’ll be dead” resonated a lot for me somehow

**bbfan132** (5.5): i wanted to like this more but the vocals totally threw me off lol

**Stryxen** (5.2): not another neutral milk hotel the first one was enough

**1998tweety** (5): wtf is this...

**CarlieScion** (5): why does every band in this 'genre' have a vocalist that sounds exactly the same. and why cant that vocalist sing

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): The instrumental is cute but "you will miss me when I'm gone" is such an overdone line at this point.

**fallenriot** (5): cute story but I don’t really like his voice, sorry

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): yet another song that aligns with my aesthetic preferences and overall vibes but is musically intolerable to me… sigh, it’s hard being quirky but also having basic taste

**ManofOranges** (5): This is giving me musical theater vibes.

**skargardin** (5): not a huge fan of indie rock

**slimboyfriend** (5): It sounds like early 2010s quirky tumblr-core with a folksy twist. Cannot stand these vocals.

**vayyiqra** (5): Sorry, I want to like this but it's too "quirky" for me in that very early-2010s way.

**sandyfishnets** (4): neutral milk hotel vibes

**starlitsuns** (4): this doesn’t do anything for me I’m sorry

**wryn\_** (4): i'm scared of people who listen to bedroom pop like this

**pat-rickstar** (3): I don’t really like this, sorry. It’s just a bit… odd?

**sarcasticsobs** (3): oh i can not get into this voice at all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): is this ajj

**timothy444** (3): Makes me feel ResidentSleeper

**AHSWeeknd** (2): What are these vocals, I’m sorry

**anothertown** (2): ???? huh??

**wavingwolves** (0): i don't want to listen to this ever again (i'm sorry to the person who submitted it though)

Very touching sentiment behind the lyrics but this kind of meandering, stripped-down guitar ballad is not for me. I think I would connect to it more if it had more of a hook than just repeating the same line at the beginning of each verse. Submitted by /u/steelstepladder.

---

**kirby31200** (11): Wow this blew me away. Thanks, submitter.

**kappyko** (10): this is actually really good

**steelstepladder** (10): I try not to give songs I submitted my 11 but this song means the world to me. Please get this to mid day two guys

**NFLfreak98** (9.7): Maybe Amanda could teach Olivia Rodrigo about being a good defensive driver

**celladonn** (9): Amanda is my problematic fave 😔

**intheaftermath** (9): I really loved this! I'm only familiar with Amanda Palmer from Evelyn Evelyn (which is amazing, by the way, Sandy Fishnets never fails to bring me to tears), and I really enjoyed this too!

**SRTviper** (8.5): Damn I love sentimental bullshit

**seanderlust** (8.4): How strange to see / That I don't wanna be the person that I want to be -- this song is full of interesting lyrics

**2dina3dworld** (8): semi-depressive ukelele bop

**astrologicalangel** (8): relatable content

**bbfan132** (8): thought it was boring at first but it won me over by the end

**bigbigbee** (8): I love indie songs in this style. I think that this one runs a TEENY bit long without changing for my own personal tastes, but it feels very personal and honest to the singer and so I wouldn’t change anything about it.

**nooodisaster** (8): Lyrically I really love this. It goes on a journey I feel like we all need to go on. Tho melodically it does kinda drag

**ReallyCreative** (8): I have complicated feelings about ukulele-core but this is nice enough

**starlitsuns** (8): a self love anthem, we have no choice but to stan

**Stryxen** (7.8): does anyone think the life is strange soundtrack is a good thing?

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): This is very indie kitchen core however i can see why people would enjoy it based on the lyrics of it

**akanewasright** (7.5): Yeah this is really cute.

**TiltControls** (7.5): the guitar sounds like it's about to start the bob's burgers theme at any moment

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.2): As someone who used to love Amanda Palmer and then unstanned completely, it’s hard to separate art from the artist here. On one hand, the lyrics hit emotionally as someone who’s also not living up to the expectations I had of myself when I was younger, and learning to love my life as it is. But when I think of it more critically in the context of her bigotry, insensitivity and white feminism, the song only feels about as deep as the most tolerable episode of Girls. I think Amanda should be less concerned about fitting society’s superficial picture of “having it together” and more about how she treats others.

**cremeebrulee** (7): its cute i like the ending

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Cute.

**skargardin** (7): relatable i think

**waluigiest** (7): a little uh quirky but not bad

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): ok

**fallenriot** (6): I liked the lyrics but the song just didn’t do it for me idk

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this sounds nice but not her fan of her voice or just the general style of the song

**letsallpoo** (6): https://twitter.com/amandapalmer/status/1352014085869588480

**linothy** (6): i thought it was going to be better than it actually was when it started playing

**wryn\_** (6): i'm scared of amanda palmer for some reason

**freav** (5.8): not fucking amanda palmer

**rickikardashian** (5.7): i love me a good white girl with a

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Sounds like those interludes on Paramore's self-titled but make them full songs, and I certainly don't have the patience for that.

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Idk, wasn’t really feeling this.

**CarlieScion** (5): this sounds like any and all ukulele girls on youtube

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds like something dodie (artist) would listen to

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): I’ve never heard of this person, but I hope she isn’t a huge r/popheads fave because I really don’t like her singing

**sirpancakeXI** (5): this song is kinda bland nothing is really happening

**timothy444** (5): It doesn't really matter if this song was sung by one of my aussie brethen or if it was featued in an award-winning video game, personally for me, it's really boring. But hey, it's better than the Nicki Minaj track that is featured in this rate as well.

**vayyiqra** (5): I do not like ukuleles nor Amanda Palmer much I'm afraid but I will be fair out of respect to whoever picked this

**AHSWeeknd** (4): very interesting, thank you for sharing this with the class

**camerinian** (4): I don't really have time for these rambling indie folk songs that are just one set of guitar strumming and vocals (I know it's a ukulele shut up)

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (4): meh

**ManofOranges** (4): I mean... it's cute but it's a skip.

**runaway3212** (4): I like the lyrics but I hate her voice so much

**sarcasticsobs** (4): every single thing i know about amanda palmer i have learned against my will

**1998tweety** (3): This is not great, sorry

**fishingfor8** (3): leave ukuleles in the past decade please

**ImADudeDuh** (3): John Green movie adaptation-core

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCkeg99jQZQ

**brenda\_official** (2): no more ukeleles in 2021

**wavingwolves** (2): this feels longer than it is

**hikkaru** (1): i hate ukeleles i'm sorry

**anothertown** (0): absolutely fucking not Amanda Palmer

**moooo566** (0): i wanted to give this zero because its amanda palmer but now i've heard it and i want to give it a zero because it sounds awful too, i hope whoever submitted this stubs their toe

=====

McIgglyTuffMuffin: Quick and dirty version; Amanda is very much a person who thinks her shit doesn't stink and every single thing she says is the correct position.

She also has an enormous ego that was only inflated when she had the Kickstarter for her album, Theatre is Evil, reach a million+ dollars. This was also in the early days of KS so it was a big fucking deal that this happened.

She used to be one of my favorite artists, and I have a high artist bullshit threshold, but I just had to give up one day.
[/r/popheads/comments/lt3nds/charity_rate_iii_reveal_day_1_you_dont_understand/govksr1/]

=====

Saison_Marguerite: She’s known for having controversy after controversy, there’s the Kickstarter drama but also saying the n-word, ableism, generally having bad takes and being loud about them.

Also wild asshole moves like traumatizing an ex-partner by faking her own death, and stalking a journalist who was critical of her. That’s just off the top of my head.

This definitely has a lot in common with the more widely known "iPhone," which is also in this rate, but it's more subdued and feels a lot rougher around the edges. That's not a bad thing though, because the high-tech gloss of Dylan Brady can tend to be overbearing and grating. I still give the edge to "iPhone" because Rico is a force of a personality but this still holds it own. Submitted by /u/bulforster.

---

**bulforster** (10): This is my submission and I keep seeing the iPhone comparison (another 10!) and I get it, but a couple points in favor of this song: it came out first and if you enjoyed it, check out the album it's from which is a lot of fun, surprisingly affecting and more consistent that most (all?) of Rico's albums, which I say as a huge fan of Rico.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song is so catchy i love the hook a lot.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): I love the grungy vibes and will definitely be listening to more of her music

**plastichaxan** (9.2): i know this will end up being really underrated cause it's not too known but i love this kind of bubblegum music and this is just really really cute in the best way possible

**astrologicalangel** (9): this has amazing 2000s energy

**camerinian** (9): Delicious. finally some good fucking hyperpop

**fallenriot** (9): this fucking bangs

**intheaftermath** (9): this sounded EXACTLY like the album cover and it was perfect

**runaway3212** (9): The energy here is great

**Stryxen** (9): period this makes me want to squeal

**Tolk1en** (9): Probably my fave discovery of this rate

**freav** (8.8): it's a banger

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): My Eevee after I give it a thunder stone

**FKJVMMP** (8): 🅱️onus points for the album title.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I’m not super into hyperpop but I like the MySpace aesthetic of this, it feels like there’s a bit more meat here than usual

**SmileAndTears** (8): Bop

**SRTviper** (7.2): Pop music. Nice nice. Good stuff.

**akanewasright** (7): Kind of cute

**bbfan132** (7): don’t know what to say but i think i kind of enjoyed it lol

**CarlieScion** (7): this was annoying but good at the same time??? how

**skargardin** (7): the chorus slaps

**vayyiqra** (7): is this Drain Gang

**waluigiest** (7): the flow and vibe are both great but the lyrics are not very interesting

**rickikardashian** (6.7): the name of this album is “baylor swift”

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): This sounds like Kesha made a Ke$ha song

**starlitsuns** (6.5): I really thought the cover on Spotify had "Taylor Swift" in burn book-style font I--

**ManofOranges** (6): Honestly, kind of an interesting song to me

**seanderlust** (6): it's fine

**timothy444** (6): Discount Charli XCX

**wavingwolves** (6): fun

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Didn’t hate it but didn’t really like it either.

**cremeebrulee** (5): reminds me of rico nasty at times but i don’t really love it… the production is pretty good though

**fadedblue09** (5): Too trashy to be a guilty pleasure.

**LazyDayLullaby** (5): Electric Cal

**linothy** (5): kinda strange sounding idk i made a face when it played HDSAFJ

**Yatcho** (5): when you want Rico Nasty but you're on a budget

**2dina3dworld** (4): this sounds like someone mixed Ayesha Erotica with Marshmello

**frogaranaman** (4): was kinda annoying

**ignitethephoenix** (4): this sounds like a Kesha parody but not good

**nooodisaster** (4): THE BOSS THE DON THE BRAZY THE BUBBLES THE BAYLOR BITCHH ITS BALI BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**AHSWeeknd** (3): This would’ve been a hit in May of 2009

**NFLfreak98** (2.7): yikes

**1998tweety** (0): This is not good, not my style, and it being on an album named "Baylor Swift" is very offensively.

A Latin trap banger. The lyrics seem pretty nonsensical (although I realize things get lost in translation) but it really doesn't matter because it slaps regardless! Perhaps she can be the next female Spanish-language artist to get a surprise crossover hit after Kali Uchis. Submitted by /u/DaHumanTorch.

---

**brenda\_official** (10): HIP CON EL HIP CON EL HIP HIP HOPPA

**endcreditouilles** (10): Nathy giving us a different kind of stimulus uwu

**fallenriot** (10): HIP CON EL HIP CON EL HIP HIP HOPPA anyway stream calambre xx

**frogaranaman** (10): NANCY PELOSI????????

**plastichaxan** (10): i unironically enjoy this very much and the colors show version too, also more latina representation we love to see it

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i don't know what she's saying, you don't know what she's saying. but this song goes slap the fuck off and one eccentric performance doesn't change that. there are many things at play regarding her aesthetic that i don't know enough about to make a judgement call on. but this song slaps!

**runaway3212** (10): BANGS!!!

**seanderlust** (10): not me thinking this said Nancy Pelosi at first....I was like so this is what we get instead of COVID relief

**vayyiqra** (10): Sana Sana is more than a meme. It is a whole outlook on life. Sana Sana says a lot about our society and

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.4): Why did I expect a meme that people only like ironically? This genuinely slaps.

**cremeebrulee** (9): [stale joke] girl where is my $2000 check?

**starlitsuns** (9): i had to translate the lyrics into English, but an-anti IMF anthem? fuck yes i like this (i’m sorry my poli-sci/socialist arse is out to play right now)

**waluigiest** (9): I wasn’t ready for how lit this was gonna be, the speaker of the house made some points

**anothertown** (8.5): Nancy Pelosi has bops

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This is one of the discoveries of the rate for me. SO much fun.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I wonder what percentage of comments for this song will mention Nancy Pelosi

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): [fist pumping] hell yes! hell yes!

**2dina3dworld** (8): the delivery sounded a bit weird at first, but then I really started to vibe with it

**sirpancakeXI** (8): i can't stop laughing at this song because of that twitter video of her doing among us tasks with that iconic live performance.

**SRTviper** (7.9): This is good, thanks

**CritneySpearz** (7.5): this kinda sounded like Nicki Minaj at certain parts omgg

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.5): GIRL U SUPPOSED TO BE EVACUATING!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): ah it’s the girl with the Nancy Peluso name

**freav** (7.3): north american twitter finding out about nathy peluso and spamming her bc of her name being similar to pelosi's was so fucking annoying

**bbfan132** (7): will always think of that one samsung/android meme when i hear this lmao

**CarlieScion** (7): hip hip hip hoppah

**letsallpoo** (7): oh no it's the song from that colors performance

**nooodisaster** (7): I feel like a bad bitch, but like a regular bad bitch

**rickikardashian** (7): i think TK should take off 0.1 from this song’s score for every comment making a nancy pelosi/stimulus check/capitol raid joke

**wryn\_** (7): yes!!! stan twice!!!

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is ok

**Yatcho** (6.5): sometimes this bops, sometimes her singing style and the lyrics are cringe, and sometimes I remember the whole blackfishing thing...

**Stryxen** (6.4): just spent the whole time thinking her name sounds like nancy pelosi

**Flegasaurus** (6): i thought it said nancy pelosi im so sorry

**ReallyCreative** (6): good morning, Sunday morning

**rotating3Dtext** (6): argentos rise up (?) sorry I just can’t get into her music though I’d like to give anything argentinian a high score

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it was really good until it got to the sana sana sana part that sounds so offtune it ruins the whole song

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Didn’t really care for this one.

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): This is annoying and it’s not cause it’s in another language

**fadedblue09** (4.5): I think it's catchy but I wish the lyrics were more than just another random mishmash of "I'm badass" cliches, which the English language has already enough of.

**pat-rickstar** (4.5): This deserves to be in Meme Songs 2

**AHSWeeknd** (4): This is a song

**timothy444** (4): Good instrumental, bad everything else

**linothy** (3): it has potential but also no it doesnt. who is sana

**skargardin** (3): anyway

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): a sign nancy pelosi should not make music i guess

**TheEvilNightman** (3): The production gives me a headache.

**wavingwolves** (2): there's a lot about this i don't like

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (0): until this point i had managed to successfully avoid listening to a nathy peluso song in full so now my day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable. I hate everything about this. Sana sana culito de rana >>>>>>>this

Dancehall is a big musical blindspot for me outside of Sean Paul's other work. I really like the rhythm on this and Stefflon Don shows more personality than anywhere else I've ever heard her. Submitted by /u/bigbigbee.

---

**akanewasright** (10): I... this had no right to slap as hard as it did.

**astrologicalangel** (10): you can't not dance when this starts playing

**cremeebrulee** (10): who submitted this bc this is one of my top songs of 2019 so i love that this is here <3

**Roxieloxie** (10): our KING idris, let me not say anything h word on main. Anyway the Caribbean in me cant not love this :daisybop:

**Yatcho** (10): THIS SLAPS, everyone absolutely ate their verse up including Idris

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Oops I’m not even giving my own song a 10 (I overplayed this). But I’m still glad that I submitted this! I think it’s just so much fun. The interplay of different rappers keeps the song feeling fresh, and - not being from the UK myself - the whole thing feels like a snapshot of a culture that I know very little about but find incredibly interesting and cool. Also, the MV is REALLY fun and cute. Watch it if you get a chance!

**sirpancakeXI** (9.4): idris lowkey have the best verse on this song

**2dina3dworld** (9): Sean Paul can make or break a song. Here, he makes it, although it's still a great song without him.

**chihuahuazero** (9): This is a smooth example of "three rappers, three verses, and a hook," where all four artists bring their A-game to the song. Shame Wiley outed himself as anti-Semitic. Like bruh.

**steelstepladder** (9): Idris Elba main pop girl

**fallenriot** (8): I was pleasantly surprised by this, it’s so fun! that said, society has moved past the need for sean paul

**FKJVMMP** (8): Sean Paul is delightful, he could be saying the most heinous shit every song and I’d still be bopping along every time not knowing or caring.

**seanderlust** (8): docked five points for wiley, added three points for sean paul, stefflon and idris

**vayyiqra** (8): New life goal: make a song featuring Idris Elba

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Idris Elba did well, but his feature on London Boy is still better

**starlitsuns** (7.5): TIL that Idris Elba sings

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): can someone make a list of artists we have rated less than Idris Elba (if we include London Boy as a song he was on)

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (7): bopping along to this rn

**frogaranaman** (7): bowsee

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): this is fine but I don’t like it

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): More Idris Elba please!

**ManofOranges** (7): Idris Elba??? Interestingly enough, this is not my least favorite song that in some way involves him.

**nooodisaster** (7): The craziest thing about this was finding out Idris Elba has an entire catalog of music on Spotify

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Stefflon Don’s verse bops, and Idris has the range!

**SRTviper** (7): oi gareth. could ew pop to mozzas for the new hip hop disc init

**wavingwolves** (7): sooo fun

**wryn\_** (7): fuck wiley etc etc but this song does still go very hard. not really sure how the americans are gonna treat it though

**kirby31200** (6.5): featuring who-

**CarlieScion** (6.2): sure

**runaway3212** (6): This has grown on me but it's kinda bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): TIL idris elba is a rapper apparently

**Stryxen** (5.8): BUT idris elba is so goddamn fine

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Would've liked this more if it went on full-dancehall mode instead of settling into trashy pop-rap.

**jsonphile** (5.5): ...why is Idris Elba on this track??

**ImADudeDuh** (5): sean paul is so funny

**pat-rickstar** (5): Stefflon owns this song and then Idris comes in and ruins it for me, I'm sorry his verse just makes me cringe

**ReallyCreative** (5): I don't have strong feelings about this

**skargardin** (5): well

**timothy444** (4): daily struggle

**NFLfreak98** (3.3): Noted British Rapper and Dance Hall Vocalist Idris Elba

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I don’t know why but I just don’t like this

**anothertown** (3): cringe

**linothy** (3): sean paul makes me fucking cackle . sean da paul badabangbangbang

**CritneySpearz** (2): at least Idris is hot

**camerinian** (0): Anti-semite say what?

**pietrohonkhonk** (0): This song is beyond annoying

We're several years removed from the "actually, One Direction was good!" discourse in the pop music community and that sentiment has only strengthened over time. Unfortunately, it did not manifest itself well for this particular song, probably because it's not enough of a bop. Submitted by /u/eklxtreme.

---

**wavingwolves** (11): big thanks to the person who submitted this and made my dream of giving it a 11 come true

**1998tweety** (10): massive serve

**CarlieScion** (10): thank u for ur service

**cremeebrulee** (10): will be robbed so hard </3

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of their best songs! Directoners rise up!

**letsallpoo** (10): their best song. all of their careers peaked here

**rickikardashian** (10): finding out that there’s a mitski cover of this has absolutely ruined me. anyway, support 2014 boybands album *(FOUR vs 5 Seconds Of Summer’s self titled vs Meet The Vamps)* rate idea

**Roxieloxie** (10): Im so mad that this song is in, mostly because this was on my shortlist of songs i was gonna send in but i decided I love this song so much that it would actually pain me to see it being robbed. So when i saw it on the list, i was excited but also im sobbing. I love love love love love this song so much and the only reason this isnt a 11 is because i am gonna manifest us ratting FOUR at some point so i can give it the love it deserves. Yall are gonna be so mean to this song /u/wavingwolves is my only friend in this house. This song plays such a crucial point in my love for 1D, and just also its one of my favorite songs of all time. Im rambling but i dont care I cant continue my love for this song. I love it I love it I love it I love it

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This one slap so hard. I didn't expect i would like a 1D song that much

**starlitsuns** (10): if I hadn't submitted a song into this rate this would be instant 11 material. one of one direction's best tracks

**TiltControls** (10): one of 1D's best songs without a doubt

**timothy444** (10): If people had any doubts about One Direction making good music, just show them this song. It's perfect without being overly cheesy like "What Makes You Beautiful" or "Live While We're Young". Shoulda been a proper single

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): Why do I have the feeling that this would be an amazing Fleetwood Mac song

**runaway3212** (9.5): I really love this

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Couldn't we have rated the Mistki cover instead :(? Oh well, this is still very good

**akanewasright** (8.5): a bop

**seanderlust** (8.2): water-type pokemon be like

**fishingfor8** (8): Hi roxie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): This is a really nice song, I enjoy the rock influence and bouncy vibe.

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): This was my first time listening to an OD song. It was kinda nice

**jsonphile** (7.5): wow what a nice song from two talented singers and the other ones

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): Mitski did it better

**AHSWeeknd** (7): They still made good music after Zayn left. Wait he’s in this.

**bbfan132** (7): mitski’s cover >>

**fallenriot** (7): I am so fucking lonely

**linothy** (7): the 1d phase i never had is shitting its pants rn tbh

**skargardin** (7): cute

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): I don’t hate this, but I don’t exactly love it either

**freav** (6.2): this is pretty fine, Mitski's cover rules though

**FKJVMMP** (6): “Nobody knows you the way I do” is still a weird lyric for four guys to sing.

**vayyiqra** (6): Why does this sound kind of like Fleetwood Mac

**nooodisaster** (5): Mid-tempo chill boy band song. I don't have strong feelings, but this was probably everything for Directioners back in the day.

**ReallyCreative** (5): it's harmless but I can't say it was interesting

**Stryxen** (5): sometimes music by men is good (not this one though)

**intheaftermath** (4.5): so, my sister's in a one direction phase right now. which means that she plays it when she gets up at 5:20 AM. maybe that impairs my judgement. maybe not.

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Naptime.

**plastichaxan** (4): now why did i think this was just a bad belle and sebastian song for a minute or so

**SRTviper** (4): Pretty boring.

**fadedblue09** (2.5): You're telling me this wasn't a Mitski original song???

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): one direction is not an albums’ band and this song is proof of that

**2dina3dworld** (2): half of 1D's album tracks come off as very cheesy, and this is no exception

**LazyDayLullaby** (1.1): One (1) Direction

**Flegasaurus** (1): no

I don't think Meghan Trainor is the worst pop girl of the 2010s like some people do (Camila is right there), and I genuinely like some songs by her, but this does not show a lot of personality. The chorus is serviceable but I can't imagine listening to this outside of the context of this rate. Submitted by /u/Ghost-Quartet

---

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**CarlieScion** (10): this has no reason to go as hard as it does

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I originally submitted a completely different song but I switched it to this one because Meghan is essentially impossible to rate (she would never get a fair shot and she’s past the point of relevance so she’s not going to be seriously considered for any lineups any time soon) so I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t take the chance to throw her in here. I knew it had to be this song because this song slaps like nobody’s business, this is bubblegum pop perfection; I’m still floored by how this song just builds and builds and builds up until the very end, she really is a master of crafting a great pop song. Not gonna give my 11 to my own submission because imo that’s a little bit tacky but I’ll be perched to see how people receive this one.

**hikkaru** (10): hold on. this BOPS but i just know it's gonna flop bc it's meghan...

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Meghan made some points here, probably my favourite song of hers, as someone who's only heard her first album and a couple of her other singles

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): While I have to roll my eyes at yet another reference to marriage right out of the gates, this is excellent pop music and you'd be FOOLISH not to acknowledge that

**fadedblue09** (9): Not really my favorite from her, but it's cute and I love how it goes off in the latter half.

**intheaftermath** (9): the best part of Meghan Trainor's music is how happy she always sounds. She sounds like Valentine's Day and I respect that.

**musical\_pyn** (9): here's how foolish can still be a single

**runaway3212** (9): Pop perfection

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): this is a bop

**timothy444** (9): Who would've expected Meghan Trainor to release something that isn't horrible or cringe at all? In fact, it bops hard!

**pheromenos** (8.8): actually a bop

**rickikardashian** (8.8): you really will make me have to give a meghan trainor a good score? jail

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): Y’all need to check out her Love Train EP, it’s a good one, I promise.

**starlitsuns** (8.5): :breathes: WHY DIDN'T MEGHAN RELEASE THESE TYPES OF BOPS FROM THE BEGINNING?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): something something Horny Press Release

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): Wait, this is a bop! I don’t know if I’ll be “stanning for days” but Meghan is better than I gave her credit for. Pièce de résistance, indeed.

**seanderlust** (8.2): okay you know what maybe i've pre judged meghan a bit too harshly! i like this a bit

**akanewasright** (8): WTF this slaps

**bigbigbee** (8): I really like everything about this song except the chorus melody and lyrics…which is unfortunately kind of a pivotal part of the song experience. Once the harmonies kick in during the second chorus it improves greatly.

**camerinian** (8): what the fuck, I’m absolutely god damn livid at how good this Meghan Trainor song is. I heard that solid groove and really thought she was going to ruin it with a dogshit chorus like she always does but she didn’t and it’s actually a really good hook and the production and construction is actually tasteful and what the fuck why couldn’t this have been Meghan’s big hit instead of her gimmicky shite cos this actually bops wtf

**fallenriot** (8): go bonkers, go schewpid, go absolutely foolish. seriously though I might be a Meghan trainor stan

**ignitethephoenix** (8): she always serves us bops and yet we ignore her smh

**Roxieloxie** (8): the ghostyola made points

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): you know what meghan good for you

**vayyiqra** (8): Wait this is good

**waluigiest** (8): I hate to admit it is a jam

**kappyko** (7.5): the opening few seconds are the best part

**Stryxen** (7.1): very repetitive but honestly a bop

**bulforster** (7): Meghan’s serving your insatiable thirst for dance-ready bops with the upbeat banger that is “Foolish.” It slaps so hard you’ll be stanning for days.

**cremeebrulee** (7): its better than i expected but doesn’t stand out to me in this playlist

**nooodisaster** (7): the horny EP

**skargardin** (7): someone better have that one press release as their comment

**SmileAndTears** (7): a cute lil bop

**SRTviper** (7): pop music

**steelstepladder** (7): Not a Megan fan but this is fine

**wavingwolves** (7): i can see how this would be a popheads soty if it was released by any one else

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s cute ig

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): noo meghan don’t rush into things

**AHSWeeknd** (6): If Ava Max made this I’d be all over it

**Brendon-Urine** (6): by far the most I've ever enjoyed a Meghan song, which is to say the only time I've enjoyed a Meghan song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): nooooo i don’t wanna like a meghan trainor song noooooo

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): She found a decent idea for a chorus and beat it to death

**brenda\_official** (5): Valentine’s Day is around the corner, and whether you’re planning on smashing bae’s junk to smithereens or making out with a pint of Phish Food, you need some fresh Valentine’s Day bops to get you in the mood for LOVE!

**linothy** (5): i would slap this song in the face

**NFLfreak98** (5): Maybe the closest the trainer of Meghans has come to being good. Cut out the ‘bling-bling’ line and it might even be a positive score

**LazyDayLullaby** (4.3): All a-bored!

**plastichaxan** (4.2): i know someone submitted this because they liked it but....why

**Flegasaurus** (4): i liked some singles from title but this is kind of boring

**jsonphile** (4): stop trying to Meghan Trainor happen

**TheEvilNightman** (4): This is a Meghan Trainor song.

**wryn\_** (4): felt myself morphing into girl defined as this song went on so i had to skip

**FKJVMMP** (2): Master stroke from Meghan to start her career with a bunch of absolute train wrecks so people give her a ton of credit for this messy mediocrity because at least it’s not Dear Future Husband.

**2dina3dworld** (0): this made me irrationally angry

**fishingfor8** (0): I just despise Meghan trainor

Very alt pop, very...okay. The drums are the most memorable part of it. Submitted by /u/RandomHypnotica.

---

**nbapip** (10): this is so good! thank you for the introduction!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Andy Bull is one of my favourite, yet totally underrated and underappreciated artists, this whole album is one of my personal favourites, and I really wanted more people to hear this track in the hopes someone else enjoys it. If you enjoyed this song I'd highly recommend checking out "Talk Too Much" and "Baby I Am Nobody Now"

**Roxieloxie** (10): One of my favorite discovers from this rate

**runaway3212** (10): This is surprisingly fun

**waluigiest** (10): this is actually so great how had I never heard this at all

**freav** (9): this is honestly a great song! had the chorus stuck in my head a lot this week

**kappyko** (9): almost reminds me of cant beat the feeling by kylie minogue but sung by a nerd

**sirpancakeXI** (9): his voice is kinda unique but in a good way i wasn't expecting that at all but i like it.

**starlitsuns** (8.5): when I saw the artist for this track I instantly thought of Black Veil Brides founding member Andy Biersack because one of my childhood bullies was an emo music fan back in the day, thankfully this was not that person and this song is really fun.

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): I feel like there's something missing from this one but it's well done indie pop

**bigbigbee** (8): I really liked this one! It’s a very interesting instrumental. I like the strength of the downbeat (? I don’t know music) running through it. It feels heavy and weighty in a good way.

**camerinian** (8): I love the way that fuzzy beat resolves into the chorus, and the momentum on this is infectious

**cremeebrulee** (8): on a first listen, i’m into this! i like the little pauses in the chorus

**linothy** (8): strange inspirational vibe. makes me wanna walk around and look at things. maybe adding to my playlist

**vayyiqra** (8): wow I love MGMT

**Stryxen** (7.6): this dude’s spotify page looks like handsome squidward

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): Running Up That Keep

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): It got a little repetitive there near the end.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Indie movie soundtrack but go off (I actually like it ngl)

**akanewasright** (7): This is pretty alright. The beat is nice, and while it’s not really for me, I think it’s cute

**bbfan132** (7): good track!

**fallenriot** (7): weirdly gives me kate bush vibes?

**frogaranaman** (7): oh those chords are gonna be stuck in my head for a while

**SRTviper** (7): Slow down andy. Stop running from me :(

**Yatcho** (7): cute... did fade into background noise though

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I don’t really like his voice but the rest of the song is good

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Could've used less synths and went more straight-up indie rock.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I enjoy the instrumentation on the chorus but I think the rest of the song is a little stiff. Not to pit men against each other but Jon Bellion did this sound better.

**2dina3dworld** (6): again, store vibes

**sandyfishnets** (6): I like this song but I feel like the mix could be better

**timothy444** (6): Average

**nooodisaster** (5): it's a very optimistic message :)

**skargardin** (5): this does not leave much of an impression on me

**wavingwolves** (5): it's very okay

**1998tweety** (4): Don't care for it

**ManofOranges** (3): Doesn't really do anything for me like at all.

**brenda\_official** (2): sounds like AJR

Throwback to Animal Crossing. It's very cutesy and sweet but it's one of those video game songs I absolutely could not imagine regularly listening to on its own. Even in the context of Animal Crossing I prefer more ambient songs. Submitted by the user formerly known as /u/selegend.

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): The Isabelle version is more deserving of an 11 but this still slaps

**astrologicalangel** (11): best song in Animal Crossing I will not be hearing any criticism at this time

**linothy** (11): MY FUCKING ANTHEM

**1998tweety** (10): Masterpiece

**Brendon-Urine** (10): undeniably a classic

**cremeebrulee** (10): king!!!!! we want this in the top 10!!!!

**fallenriot** (10): yeah

**frogaranaman** (10): K.K. Slider is unironically more influential than most Western pop girls

**hikkaru** (10): top tier kk song, along with kk disco and kk cruisin

**ImADudeDuh** (10): gay anthem yup yup yup

**ManofOranges** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022CdArz5oM

**rickikardashian** (10): https://i.imgur.com/gjHESfv.png

**Roxieloxie** (10): why did tk not link the KK slider version of this in the post!!! this is sabotage!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The range K.K. Slider has… a king!

**steelstepladder** (10): This might be a hot take but I think this is the superior video game song in the rate

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): /u/selegend this one's for you king

**timothy444** (10): Legitimately one of the best songs in this rate

**waluigiest** (10): I love forcing my villagers to sing KK Metal but this is a close second

**pheromenos** (9.5): cute

**plastichaxan** (9.5): unironically better than most of the rate

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): A real career highlight for Mr. K.K. Slider

**bigbigbee** (9): Would have been a 10 if it was the Smash version! I listened to this song SO MUCH at the start of quarantine when New Horizons had just come out. A lot of the KK songs are actually really good (shoutout Imperial KK, KK Metal, Stale Cupcakes). Video game rate when?

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): my ass is quaking

**ReallyCreative** (9): It's no K.K. Disco but it's still unironically fantastic

**CritneySpearz** (8): slaps

**endcreditouilles** (8): idc where you're from, this honestly slaps. On my pregame playlist for sure

**Mysario** (8): points for the idea, but hardly the best K.K. track

**nooodisaster** (8): THE WHISTLE BEFORE THE CHORUS, WIG!!

**runaway3212** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022CdArz5oM

**seanderlust** (8): :)

**starlitsuns** (8): the isabelle version from the newest animal crossing game is stuck in my head thanks lilsimsie

**Stryxen** (8): Not another white boy with a guitar

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): yeah yeah insert joke about how kk slider outsold your favs or w/e but this is genuinely a really good and soothing song to listen to

**wavingwolves** (8): i don't know a bigger hit

**freav** (7.7): makes me happy

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): @Nintendo put your soundtracks on streaming you cowards

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.3): BOP

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.3): K.K.

**camerinian** (7): I didn’t really need reminding that my island has been neglected for like six months now ever since I started playing Hades but thanks I guess.

**CarlieScion** (7): cute

**celladonn** (7): It's cute but it's no K.K. Metal

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I don't own a Switch.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): main pop girl!

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): You’d probably expect me to give this a 10 or 11 because of my username, but I actually think it’s pretty overrated, I don’t know why this was the K.K. song that went viral over some of his better songs. That being said, it’s certainly not bad.

**skargardin** (7): bop although a bit short, is K.K. in their streaming era?

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): i love

**vayyiqra** (7): Wow I love hyperpop

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): my country’s economy is an embarrassment and I don’t have a switch

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): This is cute.

**kirby31200** (6.5): K.K. Ska outsold

**fishingfor8** (6): I don't play animal crossing and I still feel like I've heard this song a billion times

**jsonphile** (6): I really don’t know how to rate this I mean it’s fine I guess?? But how do I compare it to Kid Cudi and Janelle Monae??

**SRTviper** (6): I like a good amount of video game music, but this just ain't the banger I was promised. But I guess this would be pretty exciting after moving around furniture for 4 hours or whatever.

**TheEvilNightman** (6): It's cute.

**anothertown** (5): there are too many peppies in my island

**intheaftermath** (5): K.K. Am I just salty that K.K. Bubblegum is so prevalent while iconic deep cuts like K.K. Dirge and K.K. Birthday go unappreciated? It's a possibility...

**TiltControls** (5): I love me some K.K. Slider, but he's basically dog Ed Sheeran and this is his Shape of You

**wryn\_** (4): millennial anthem lol

**Yatcho** (4): flop

**NFLfreak98** (3.7): Well this is a nothing song

**FKJVMMP** (3): It’s no Wii Sports theme.

**pat-rickstar** (3): Cute but quite annoying

**akanewasright** (2): A KK Slider song with no KK Slider? No thank you ma’am

**kappyko** (2): this meme was annoying

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): no.

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Why did I listen to this?

**bbfan132** (1): sorry but no

**fadedblue09** (1): I'm broke and I never played Animal Crossing, so this means nothing to me.

**Jackalope117** (1): does this even count as a song

**Flegasaurus** (0): fuck kk slider i hate that little rat dog thing

**SmileAndTears** (0): -_-

I realize this is supposed to be one of her more technically impressive songs but this kinda bores me until near the end. Lil Mama's "Lip Gloss" did this beat better. Submitted by /u/InfernalSolstice.

---

**nooodisaster** (11): Suing the rate hosts for sabotaging Nicki by linking that mess of a video. The actual song... THE COLLAPSE. Imagine not even releasing an official album yet, but having something that could be considered a magnum opus. When she restarts the song b/c the hype man didn't hype her up enough???? When she gloats for 2 minutes at the end about how she killed every rap bitch??? And then tells us to pick her fruit out and buy rawhide of various animals?? It's HER! SHE wins, you LOSE! Hahahhaahaha

**1998tweety** (10): The UNIDSPUTABLE Queen of rap.

**anothertown** (10): im crying because i remember downloading an mp3 of a bunch of nicki verses edited together off tumblr from some girl named sade in 2009

**CarlieScion** (10): iconnery

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is what transformed me into a barb back in high school . it still goes hard miss maraj put this on streaming

**endcreditouilles** (10): lemme sign ur bobbies

**fallenriot** (10): early Nicki is just unmatched

**ManofOranges** (10): Bop.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song really emphasises what makes Nicki so unique, and what she does so well. The fact that it's not on Spotify is a crime (Side note: the fact that there's Hood Affairs audio watermarks on the official video for this is absolutely hilarious)

**rickikardashian** (10): the fact that the video linked in the post is the version with a watermark counts as sabotage and i expect a formal apology from the host

**runaway3212** (10): ICONIC!!!

**waluigiest** (10): this song is perfect and I’ve been obsessed for at least a decade. It’s 4 minutes of flawless lyricism and flow. I genuinely believe that music peaked when Nicki said “Give it up.... it’s me. I win! You lose! HAHAHAHAHA”

**Yatcho** (10): so many ICONIC lines

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): Beam Me Up Scotty was such an iconic mixtape and this track was the perfect introduction to Nicki’s flow and larger than life personality. It still goes hard today!

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): kween shit

**plastichaxan** (9.5): i always find interesting to see artists beginnings and things before their career started to see the evolution and in this case she just has always been good

**brenda\_official** (9): WWW.HOODAFFAIRS.NET

**Mysario** (9): support oddball deep cuts

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): This is Nicki at her most nickiest and i will always have a soft spot for her early music. This song goes slap the fuck off.

**slimboyfriend** (9): It kinda sounds like stupid hoe minus the crack

**seanderlust** (8.9): nicki minaj nicki lewinsky nicki the ninja nicki the boss and nicki the harajuku barbie https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfvWpA4XkAA5Hvd.jpg

**NapsAndNetflix** (8): why is this unironically one of her best songs

**wavingwolves** (8): powerful words were spoken

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the ending of this song is iconic but everything else is just ok

**camerinian** (7): This is a great track, I just wish there were more watermarks

**Flegasaurus** (7): i love the www.hoodaffairstv.net watermark

**freav** (7): hoodaffairs exclusive

**pat-rickstar** (7): The watermarks are so fucking annoying, I'm trying not to let them affect my score but it's difficult

**skargardin** (7): I find this slightly overrated

**Stryxen** (6.9): too much is happening :-)

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of went off at times but there was too much talking/dialogue

**celladonn** (6.5): I find the beat so annoying but the last minute is undeniably iconic

**kirby31200** (6.5): Saved by the "I win, you lose" moment

**TheEvilNightman** (6.2): As some one who only knows Nicki through her hits, this is, uh, interesting.

**2dina3dworld** (6): not the best of Nickis discography, probably not even top half, but it was pretty alright

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): THIS IS A HOODAFFAIRS EXCLUSIVE

**LazyDayLullaby** (6): Nursery rhymes are good

**SRTviper** (5.7): This tastes like 2009.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): I know people love this but what is this production

**ImADudeDuh** (5): its funny that the lyric video i watched for this song had to censor shit and fuck but didn’t censor the n word.

**vayyiqra** (5): This is alright but also kind of annoying

**linothy** (4): she sounds so tiny aw

**SmileAndTears** (4): A song for sure

**wryn\_** (4): jesus i was actually crying laughing because of all those dj samples that totally drown out everything. this might be a great song but i could not pay attention to it at all lol

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I always make it a point to never trust stans and their irrational hype towards their faves' supposedly "hidden gems".

**steelstepladder** (3.5): Three Little Pigs by Green Jello outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): was… I genuinely can’t tell, was this a joke submission? Did I listen to the wrong video or something? Wtf is this?

**ReallyCreative** (3): hmm

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): the beat sucks and the last 40 seconds or so where she just talks about how she’s better than every other rapper are so unbelievably horrible i thought it was a joke

**Jackalope117** (1): bad meme song

**NFLfreak98** (1): I can’t tell if the background guy going THIS IS A HOODAFFAIRS EXCLUSIVE every 30 seconds makes it better or worse

**timothy444** (1): No wonder why she didn't put this song on streaming services

**starlitsuns** (0): No.

Dawn Richard is an alumnus of Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money, and it seems that after those projects she decided to start making Santigold-lite music! This isn't bad but I'm pretty alternative R&B'd out since hearing that word for the first time in like 2014. Submitted by /u/Saison_Marguerite.

---

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Dawn asserts her individuality and rejects being placed on a pedestal of other people’s expectations as a Black woman or a queer woman (as the Grace Jones sample establishes) in this synth-driven banger. The former Danity Kane singer won’t be boxed in or held back, she is just here to make moves as freely as men do. The whole album is a moving exploration of her Lousiana heritage, family roots in the Washitaw Nation tribe, and her relationships. It was tough choosing between this song and the more vulnerable, yet confrontational “Spaces” as my submission.

**seanderlust** (11): iamiamiamIAMIAAAAAAAAAAMM https://memegenerator.net/img/images/71739925.jpg

**nooodisaster** (10): Okay this is a SERVE. Production is on another level, and Dawn has such power.

**plastichaxan** (10): i've been trying to find this for so long, whoever submitted this, thank you so much

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the part where she talk about if she find woman attractive is pretty iconic.

**Stryxen** (9.1): the i am i am i am i am sounds exactly like iMi by bon iver but this is much better lol

**2dina3dworld** (9): she sounds very old school, which is ironic because she says she's a "new breed"

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): This sounds like something that could have been part of the Black Panther soundtrack. Really digging the production here.

**kappyko** (9): the dance cuts on this album were sooooo good

**vayyiqra** (9): This is vayycore

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Lyrics are too try-hard and borderline cringe but I love the combination of lush production and those hard-hitting beats.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): serve!

**bigbigbee** (8): Oh, you know what this reminds me of? The opening to Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni …lol. (Stream!) I really like how moody and dark this is.

**CarlieScion** (8): 😌

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Vote for my “She Deserved Better” rate (which includes Dawn Richard) next rate cycle, thank you

**ManofOranges** (8): Kind of a hit.

**runaway3212** (8): Women who love themselves are lesbians now sorry I don't make the results

**skargardin** (8): ooh this is a banger

**timothy444** (8): Wait a minute… so I had to do a bit of digging while listening to this and I only just found out that this song was played in one scene from that Kipo show on Netflix (which is an amazing show, don't sleep on it) and I guess that makes sense because it is popheads after all and considering the charity we all donated too, it makes mega sense in a mega mute way (haha Kipo reference XD). So I'm not really sure if the submitter of this song added it because of that show or some other reason but I'm glad they did because I rediscovered why I love that show in the first place. It's like Avatar the Last Airbender but with furries and that's dope af.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): this song’s chorus is just “i’m built different” fdjshfjks i liked it a lot on a first listen but it shrunk on me a bit

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): ok come through bisexual(?) queen

**1998tweety** (7): It's kinda nice

**fallenriot** (7): I love her delivery

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like this but I feel like something is missing from it. The monologue is the middle iconic tho

**wavingwolves** (7): points were made

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of boring :/

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): I Love iMi by Bon Iver

**fishingfor8** (5): intro is way too long and dramatic

**LazyDayLullaby** (5): I yam I yam I yam I yam I yaa-am

**SRTviper** (5): I feel like I want this song to be musically a lot more aggressive to go with the lyrics.

**Yatcho** (5): lyrically, sonically this is just boring... cute Grace Jones sample though I Liked that part

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Seems so unfinished.

**linothy** (4): it kinda felt like a song that never started? i felt like it was always so close to starting but it stayed really muffled and dead the whole time. breed: different🥶
