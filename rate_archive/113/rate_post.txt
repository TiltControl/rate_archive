Charity Rate III
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kxymx7/charity_rate_iii/

Hello everyone and welcome to the third /r/Popheads Charity Rate!

[Back in October,](https://redd.it/jdqdyo) we hosted our fourth (!) major charity drive event on the subreddit, benefitting the charity [**Southern Fried Queer Pride.**](http://www.southernfriedqueerpride.com/) As a reward for donating $15 or more to the event, each donor got to submit a song to get rated for the first time! These songs could be anything we hadn't already rated, so the selection is wildly diverse in sound and consists largely of songs that would never otherwise be rated.

# Rules

* You must listen to and rate EVERY song in this rate, with one exception: I completely understand not wanting to listen to an hour long doom metal track that is also a full album.
* Each song receives a score between 1 and 10, and decimal points up to 1 place are allowed (e.g. 5.5, 7.3, 9.9 - NOT 5.55 or 9.99).
* You may give a 0 and/or an 11 to only one song each in the entire rate. These should go to your least favorite and favorite songs respectively.
* If scores are missing/multiple songs have 11s/etc, you will be notified and your scores will not be counted until they are corrected. I will contact you repeatedly until you fix these mistakes because I want as many scores as possible.
* Your scores are not confidential and will be shared during the reveal.
* In addition, the identity of the donor who submitted each song IS confidential up until the reveal, at which point they will be revealed as each song is eliminated.
* If you wish to edit your scores or add/remove comments at any point, feel free to PM me.
* I don't have many concerns about sabotage because this is a grab bag rate where only one artist has multiple songs, so I'm going to be policing scores very lightly. However, if your scores are excessively negative to the point where they drag down nearly every song equally, I reserve the right to reject your scores or ask for them to be changed.
* You are highly encouraged (not required) to provide comments along with your scores! However, please make sure that you format your comments properly! This is how you properly format a comment:

>Guilty Conscience: 10 me when i stream kim petras

* These are all incorrect ways to format a comment:

>2ON: 0: this isnt tinashe wtf  
>  
>Oh, Maker: 10 - notice me senpai /u/Janellemonae  
>  
>Put Your Records On: I'm giving this a 10 because I loved the Ritt Momney cover so much!  
>  
>iPhone: (0) I can't listen to any song that normalizes the instruments of 5G.

You may have noticed that this rate is going up in the middle of the month rather than on the 2nd. That's to accommodate our normal rate schedule of two rates a month. In order to make things as simple as possible, I have already decided a hard due date and reveal dates, which you can view below in large text.

Thanks again to our donors and good luck to our contenders!

# This rate is due on Thursday, February 25th at noon EST. The reveal will take place the following Friday to Sunday, 26th to 28th.
