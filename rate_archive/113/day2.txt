This is like a more vibey, ethereal version of a Grimes song with some 8-bit flair. Unfortunately I don't really like the VGM sound or most Grimes songs so this doesn't do it for me. Submitted by /u/kyrgyzzephyr.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this was kinda gorgeous

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): omg I forgot how much I liked yeule’s music, she’s got that high adventure anime/Vocaloid thing going on but she grounds it with a more indie music sensibility and the two sounds bring out the best in each other. Plus the video… game over.

**plastichaxan** (10): getting to rate yeule is a blessing thank you submitter

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Wikipedia told me she picked the name Yeule after the FFXIII-2 character, Yeul, so I have no choice but to stan now (also this, Pretty Bones and Pixel Affection are really good, thank you for introducing me to them)

**runaway3212** (10): This is really beautiful

**skargardin** (10): this is like so stunning wtf

**Stryxen** (10): mentally eel bitches are we here !?

**vayyiqra** (10): I love Yeule she is so good and underappreciated

**intheaftermath** (9.5): The album said Serotonin II and it was right

**starlitsuns** (9.5): this is straight out vibing music. I’m almost certain my dog would listen to this while hanging out in my backyard with the biggest smile on his face, so I approve.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): Really chill and beautiful

**1998tweety** (9): oh wow this is cool, i'll have to check out the rest of her stuff later

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Wow this production

**sarcasticsobs** (9): i keep meaning to revisit her, thank goodness for this rate for the reminder again. this is a zelda song

**TiltControls** (9): Another great song that I'd never heard before.

**timothy444** (9): Mysterious and dreamy

**seanderlust** (8.8): hypnotizing and beautiful. I love it

**Yatcho** (8.7): this is mostly vibes but it's really good

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): a serve! downright ethereal synthwork here

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Beautiful haunting ambient shit

**2dina3dworld** (8): my only previous exposure to Yeule was through "Pretty Bones". These two songs have such an opposite vibe, and tbh, I love this song almost as much. A part of it almost sounds like 8 bit music.

**camerinian** (8): This is kind of a bad song to submit for a rate because it took me a whole bunch of listens to really sit with it and soak in its atmosphere, but this is going on the rotation playlist for sure.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love how spacey this is, I probably should check out more of their stuff

**SmileAndTears** (8): a cute little moment

**wavingwolves** (8): this is so good

**akanewasright** (7.5): That was sweet.

**chihuahuazero** (7.5): Club Rose FTW.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i like the vibes here but i dont see myself revisiting this

**bbfan132** (7): v relaxing

**fallenriot** (7): not what id normally listen to, but it’s very pretty

**wryn\_** (7): the aesthetic here is very strong...very powerful

**kirby31200** (6.5): Kinda slides right off the brain, in one ear and out the other. Not actively unpleasant but unmemorable

**SRTviper** (6.5): Good sounds

**fadedblue09** (5): Sorry but I have a hard time rating this kind of music objectively.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this sounds like music that someone who posts inflammatory comments on leftist tiktoks would like.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): it’s boring

**anothertown** (2): soundtrack to a $1.99 eshop visual novel

**linothy** (0): noooooo :starts weeping:

Rico Nasty and hyperpop are a match made in heaven and I'm disappointed that Nightmare Vacation didn't lean fully into it. I love the glossy sheen over this and the hook is super catchy without being annoying like a lot of hyperpop. Submitted by /u/pat-rickstar.

---

**sandyfishnets** (11): THIS TIME WON'T BE NOTHIN LIKE THE LAST ONE

**slimboyfriend** (11): Giving this an eleven because it makes me want to mosh with the hyperpop art twinks

**akanewasright** (10): One of the biggest bops in the rate. If this goes out before Day 3 I swear to god...

**bigbigbee** (10): Rico can do anything, can’t she? I LOVE this. It’s not my 100% favorite track in the rate but it’s probably the one I go back to the most, if just for how easy this is to listen to for me.

**bulforster** (10): I love how Rico's versatility and individuality mean she can go toe to toe with Dylan Brady's sledgehammer hyperpop production.

**camerinian** (10): This is like a landmark record for hyperpop, and it’s just so perfect as one. The chorus is like fucking crack for how replayable it is, Rico nails every single aspect of her delivery, sung, high-pitched and rapped, and the production bangs so fucking hard oh my god. This is gonna be mentioned in the same breath as Pop 2, 100 Gecs, Sophie, etc in the future, mark my words

**cremeebrulee** (10): I THINK MY PHONE IS HACKED …. WHY WON’T YOU CALL ME BACK …..

**frogaranaman** (10): literal crack

**kirby31200** (10): Dylan Brady doesn't miss

**pat-rickstar** (10): It looks like I'm the biggest stan of this song on the subreddit at this point considering this is my submission and I also did the writeup for it in popheads' top 100 tracks of 2020. While it is a banger, there are other songs here with more range, impact etc and I can understand if it's divisive/controversial, so I won't be too mad if it flops

**pheromenos** (10): i should probably leave a comment but unfortunately i'm currently too busy trying to retrieve my wig

**plastichaxan** (10): rico with dylan production was just a dream of mine that came true and the result is just amazing

**rickikardashian** (10): [THIS TIME WONT BE NOTHING LIKE THE LAST NO!...](https://i.imgur.com/jMVYrWp.mp4)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): music go “clang clank clash bang” and i go :)

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I want Rico to continue working with Dylan Brady for a long time into the future

**Stryxen** (10): this was SO nearly my 11 but someone in daily discussion decided on my other option for me lol

**wryn\_** (10): it physically pained me that i couldn't give this my 11

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.6): Smash! I love the mix of punk, rap, and electronic.

**Yatcho** (9.3): Rico and Dylan really served here, she sounds so good on this type of production

**bbfan132** (9): banger alert

**Brendon-Urine** (9): dylan brady production = pure fire, rico kills it too

**runaway3212** (9): Slaps!

**SRTviper** (9): Finally a real banger.

**starlitsuns** (9): finally, some riveting content I can relate to

**waluigiest** (9): I think this is my new obsession

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): she said android users do NOT interact

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I know we’re supposed to rate the song and not the person but I just have to say that I’m still side eyeing Rico for her [incredibly tone deaf response for being called out for using a certain anti-Asian slur](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEVfgdbjcXH/?hl=en) and that is my right… y’all will hold anti-black behavior over artist’s heads for years (not saying this is a bad thing, just pointing it out) but racism against Asians is always met with crickets. I had to get that off my chest because it was bugging me. Anyways the song itself is nice enough, I think she’s finally finding a balance between her hyperpop aspirations and the hyper-aggressive vibe that garnered her attention to begin with.

**wavingwolves** (8): i'm not a hyperpop person but this is a hit i can deny

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit but i prefer her old stuff. the pc gang has ruined ha

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is a banger and it’s probably one of my favorite things Dylan Brady has done but it’s still not 100% for me

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's kind of a bop but it also gives me a headache

**2dina3dworld** (7): android users can't relate

**skargardin** (7): bop

**steelstepladder** (7): In general I prefer aggressive Rico but this is fine too

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.8): iPhone home

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): Not a fan of the voice distortion here.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I'll never forgive Apple for getting rid of the headphone jack

**TiltControls** (6.5): don't forget to put your mask on

**linothy** (6): 100 gecs vibes but what the fuck this doesnt seem like rico nasty at all

**fadedblue09** (5.5): The autotune really grates my nerves but it's catchy I guess.

**jsonphile** (5): maybe someday I’ll understand this

**ManofOranges** (5): Some of Rico Nasty's music is just.... not for me. Sorry to her!

**sirpancakeXI** (5): not the best rico nasty song, this is kinda messy and loud for no reason

**timothy444** (5): meh

**AHSWeeknd** (4): yes, or no. mostly no.

**CarlieScion** (4): hyper pop really isnt my thing

**kappyko** (4): dylan brady is so hacky nowadays

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i like rico and hyperpop both on their own but the two of them together just do not mix well

**NFLfreak98** (2.5): Wear your mask please. And if you can’t sing find an actual vocalist instead of drowning your voice in autotune

**Flegasaurus** (2): wtf is happening

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i really hate this song

**vayyiqra** (0): I don't get the hype about her sorry besties !

Unexpectedly interesting production! The introduction of the house beat is immaculate and perfectly recontextualizes the weird production elements from the first half of the song. Submitted by /u/calkates.

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The beat switch, hello???

**endcreditouilles** (10): what that mean!? I'M CLEAN

**kirby31200** (10): wow I love this

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): Okay, I need to check out her other stuff ASAP. The production on this is fire.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): a beat change to end all beat changes

**chihuahuazero** (9): Must be drawing the same lineage as Marian Hill the band.

**fallenriot** (9): a moment

**runaway3212** (9): really really good

**Stryxen** (9): this instrumental is the vibe

**vayyiqra** (9): I love electronic songs with this kind of 90s house influence

**waluigiest** (9): the groove later in the song.... bliss

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.9): I need to listen to more Tayla Parx, she seems like an under-appreciated force in pop music

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i’ve only heard one tayla parx song before this and i vastly prefer this one. might need to check out more of her stuff

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love how quirky this is but I wish another song from this album was sent instead (even with as amazing the second half of this song is)

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): It's a little messy but the hook is great! The little switch up is also fantastic.

**SRTviper** (8.5): This song made me realize Indieheads doesn't deserve music.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): "Now I'm on a detox (what that mean?) I'm clean ✨" is such an earworm

**bigbigbee** (8): Love the majority of the song, but don’t really like the outro, which is a bummer.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I *loved* this album and I love that someone submitted a Tayla song but… why this one? “Fixer Upper,” “Nevermind,” “Dance Alone…” they were right there.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): Is it bad that I first heard of her through that one Sims reality show?

**skargardin** (8): boppy

**timothy444** (8): Bop?

**Yatcho** (8): okay when this turned into a dance track i really enjoyed it

**anothertown** (7.5): it's interesting..

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The instrumental of this is really cool and more interesting than the vocals/lyrics to me

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**akanewasright** (7): I love Tayla, but this song is kinda meh imo. Her energy is super welcome at all times though

**camerinian** (7): I think there’s two great songs here that kinda mesh weirdly, but shit, points for having the gumption to try it.

**CarlieScion** (7): cute

**fadedblue09** (7): I like how there are two distinct parts here. Sadly I don't go to parties that much so it doesn't fully resonate with me unfortunately.

**frogaranaman** (7): outro is fun

**NFLfreak98** (7): So the second half kicks in and I just end up wishing that was the whole song. Also every time she says ‘party’ she says it like ‘potty’ and the fact the she’s talking about getting something out of her system doesn’t help

**nooodisaster** (7): The breakdown is crazy.

**bbfan132** (6.5): hmm… eh

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Not bad, just not for me

**sarcasticsobs** (6): the beat switch tho

**steelstepladder** (6): I'm close to liking this one but I'm not quite there

**wryn\_** (6): not really sure it fully works but it's very interesting

**linothy** (5): i would like to get this song out of my system amen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this just sounds like someone mashed two songs together even though they don’t go together in any way

**wavingwolves** (4): for some reason i don't like the "get you out of my system" part and since it's repeated a lot it makes me not like the song much

**2dina3dworld** (3): there's something about this song that musically, doesn't sit right with me. It's not offensive or bad or anything, it's just really not my style.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): i'm sorry that beat is atrocious it sounds like someone swallowing their microphone

I like Syd's voice and Kaytranada's production generally and this is nice and pleasant. Submitted by /u/chihuahuazero.

---

**camerinian** (10): God Syd's voice just makes me melt in my chair every single time

**CarlieScion** (10): i feel like admitting kaytranada is Good Actually is letting kappy win and i cant do that

**chihuahuazero** (10): I submitted this song because I wanted my submission to align with the rate's charity. Both lead singer Syd and producer Kaytranada are wonderful musicians who are Black and queer. In this collaboration, The Internet and Kaytranada come together for a sultry electro-R&B ode that I hope most raters will like as much as I do.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i fucking love this!!!! it’s so chill and vibey and does not overstay its welcome despite being a 7 minute song. shout out to whoever submitted this bc its by far my favorite discovery from this rate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): One of the most smooth, beautiful tracks ever, Syd’s voice is like velvet! There aren’t enough explicitly WLW love songs out there, luckily that is changing, and this one is a gem.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): it is so chill i love it

**timothy444** (10): Chilled af

**wavingwolves** (10): this one is for the sapphics

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I like how smooth this sounds, and their voices are nice too! Though I don't think this needed to be 7 minutes long.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Whoever picked this is very brave for submitting a slow, 7 minute long song to a popheads rate. It's very good though

**Stryxen** (9.1): this is my favourite discovery of the rate but oh my god it is so long

**anothertown** (9): listen to The Internet, Hive Mind is one of my favorite albums of the past few years

**bbfan132** (9): it’s almost 7 minutes but it goes by quickly, chill yet entrancing

**vayyiqra** (9): This is very smooth I liked it so much it didn't feel its length at all

**waluigiest** (9): so clean so clean so gay

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): very chill and very enjoyable

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): not to be like “this is too long” but this is a bit too long, otherwise I love it though it’s a total vibe

**NFLfreak98** (8.5): N O C T U R N A L

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Sapphic yearning :(

**Yatcho** (8.5): KAYTRANADA a king, even on a slower song like this the vibes are so good

**seanderlust** (8.3): floaty

**nooodisaster** (8): First of all the album cover is AMAZING, easy 11/10. Beyond that, love the atmospheric production, haunting vocals, and simple layering that adds over time. Good shit.

**jsonphile** (7.5): would be a tad higher but goes on too long

**1998tweety** (7): kind of vibey

**runaway3212** (7): good but nothing more than that

**skargardin** (7): this did not feel like 7 minutes

**steelstepladder** (7): A groove but it doesn't really go anywhere

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): i really try and force myself to like this song more but its just a bit boring for me

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): It’s a little chill bop but goes on way too long. Points deduction for length.

**bulforster** (6): I think this could grow on me but it's not doing much rn

**FKJVMMP** (6): This could have been great if it was like three minutes shorter. I’m down for some Dopesmoker-tier epics but not every song needs to be long as shit.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): nice vibe but kind of boring and drags on a lot

**ManofOranges** (6): I mean, that was nice but damn it was long too!

**2dina3dworld** (5): not my style, but if you see me putting it down to this at a party, mind your own business.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Very interesting

**SRTviper** (5): I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing ever did.

**wryn\_** (5): it's really good and then it goes on for 5 more minutes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): sounds like lofi hip hop beats to study/relax to

**Brendon-Urine** (3): sleepy (why is this 7 minutes long)

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): Way too slow and way too long

**linothy** (2): pls these are so Slow and Sad why

This is the first Vocaloid song I've ever heard, and it's exactly what I expected. It's bright, bubbly and chaotic and I presume that's the appeal of the genre. Not my thing for the same reason a lot of k-pop doesn't hold my attention but not actively bad either. Submitted by /u/TakeOnMeByA-ha.

---

**pheromenos** (11): yo wtf

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): my submission!! i knew i wanted to submit a song with miku in it to this rate to expose popheads to the wonders that is vocaloid music and went through quite a few different options, but ended up deciding with this one because it is, in my opinion, one of the catchiest and best vocaloid songs made in the past few years and was most similar in style to songs this sub enjoys. i've been addicted to this song ever since it first came out and that hasn't change almost 5 years later. i'm sure popheads is gonna do this song dirty but if this gets even one person to check out more vocaloid music then i consider my job a success.

**1998tweety** (10): we stan Hatsune Mike in this household

**akanewasright** (10): WAIT THIS FUCKS AAAAAAAAH

**cremeebrulee** (10): this serves idc

**frogaranaman** (10): Hatsune Miku is unironically more influential than most Western pop girls

**intheaftermath** (10): Miku can do no wrong :)

**Mysario** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/795748288779255868.gif?v=1

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Miku's got it all, the visuals (seriously, SO MANY QUALITY MV's) , the voice (8 Octave Range like wtf), the looks (she looks like she hasn't aged a day since her debut!) , and yet this sub sleeps on her so much smh

**Roxieloxie** (10): I feel like im playing a mini game rn in a party Absolutely love it

**runaway3212** (10): What a banger

**skargardin** (10): but what a BOP

**starlitsuns** (10): this was an instant 10 because I’m a porter robinson stan which makes me an honorary weeb, whoops

**Stryxen** (10): why can’t every song sound like this

**timothy444** (10): big anime mood

**Yatcho** (10): a serve!

**sandyfishnets** (9.7): bop

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Okay, this didn’t have to go so hard, wtf? I think this is activating the part of my brain that likes hyperpop, because "song loud and fast = good"

**camerinian** (9): NEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOUUUUMMM BRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMM SKRRRRRRRRRRRR

**CarlieScion** (9): THIS GOES TOO HARD

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Queen

**sarcasticsobs** (9): always down to support my favorite anthropomorphized vocaloid software

**TheEvilNightman** (9): HOLYSHITIFEELSOMUCHENERGYFROMTHISILOVETHISILOVETHISILOVETHISILOVETHIS

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): wow a bop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Unironically bangs, but loses points for the occasional wub-wub.

**Flegasaurus** (8.5): https://youtu.be/A2TOCxC2PD0

**freav** (8.5): oh wow this actually goes hard

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): this may have channeled my inner non-existent weeb energy

**2dina3dworld** (8): THE HORNS OMG. What a jpop staple

**anothertown** (8): don't show popheads vocaloid music they'll start thinking everything under 150bpm is a ballad

**bigbigbee** (8): There are Vocaloid songs that I like better than this (Tell Your World, Rollin Girl, Happy Synthesizer), but I just HAVE to support Vocaloid representation in rates, especially since this song feels very representative of “vocaloid music” as it existed in the early to mid 2010s.

**Brendon-Urine** (8): took a point off for the weird ass dubstep part but this is still a banger. key change scalped me.

**vayyiqra** (8): nice meme very droll

**waluigiest** (8): in the best possible way this could be in a Sonic game

**wavingwolves** (8): whewwwww this is pure serotonin

**wryn\_** (8): this goes so insanely hard what the hell

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I have a weird relationship to Vocaloid/“anime-core” music in general because it’s a lot of fun every now and then but then you listen to a bunch of it and it just starts to blend together. Maybe if I spoke Japanese I’d be able to tell the song apart better but as it stands it’s hard for me to get a grasp on them… in a vacuum this is cute though.

**seanderlust** (7.5): interesting, though tbh I could have done without the dubstep moment

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Bit of a bop even if I'm never gonna listen to this ever again.

**bbfan132** (7): fun!!

**fallenriot** (7): I am never going to listen to this again but it’s a banger I won’t lie

**fishingfor8** (7): kinda a bop ngl

**nooodisaster** (7): cant rate this any lower or the robots will exterminate humanity

**SRTviper** (7): Yeah I can skank to this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): nightcore rate WHEN /u/tragickingdom1

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): video game vocal tease

**kirby31200** (6.5): Usually I eat these vocaloid J-pop tracks up, but this one is just a bit too much for me, sounds a little busy and the fake horns(?) are not great on the ears

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This sounds like it belongs on a rhythm game soundtrack

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.3): On the annoying side for me, I do give it credit for being catchy and I think the vocaloid concept is really cool.

**ManofOranges** (6): Guilty (somewhat) pleasure

**SmileAndTears** (6): Hmmm...

**ReallyCreative** (5): Never really understood the appeal, there's just too much going on without enough substance. We do appreciate the official inventor of Minecraft and author of Harry Potter joining us for this rate.

**Tolk1en** (5): going way too fast + awful vocals. This fantastic key change is nearly saving the song.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Could be the theme song to an Anime series based on Among Us

**NFLfreak98** (3.5): Well this is hard to listen to. It gets a bit of a boost for whenever that bassline comes in and steals the show

**\_SoulGlitch** (3): I’m sorry but this is not for me, made for a fun one-time listen though.

**FKJVMMP** (1): Might be a 10 if you put Dance Dance Revolution in front of me, otherwise it just feels like getting stabbed in the ear.

**linothy** (1): i hate japanese music uh oh

**Jackalope117** (0): what the fuck

**LazyDayLullaby** (0): V0cal0id

I know this is like the definitive hip hop remix of a pop song, and usually I'm one to defend these kinds of remixes, but I really feel like the original is much stronger! O.D.B. is great but I don't think the sample + drums are enough to carry the song, especially with the chorus being swapped out for the bridge. The original is a hard 10, but this is just...not. Submitted by /u/akanewasright.

**anothertown** (11): [ODB] Yo, New York in the houseIs Brooklyn in the houseUptown in the houseCharlotte are ya in da houseBoogie Down are you in the houseSacramento in the houseAtlanta, Georgia are you in the houseWest Coast are you in the houseJapan are you in da houseEverybody are you in the houseBaby, baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Her vocals are just… there are no words, love it.

**akanewasright** (10): BOP bop bop.

**bbfan132** (10): fuck fuck fuck this remix is so fucking good, odb’s parts are top-notch and i love the edited production/samples here

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I have a really good memory associated with this one: I was driving to see a production of *Sister Act: The Musical* with my (now ex-)boyfriend and we were listening to *#1 To Infinity* and I was providing running commentary and when we got to this track I remarked on how silly the “whatchu gonna do when you get out of jail?” part was and he said “that explains the next track ‘Conjugal Visit’” and that really caught me off-guard, I laughed so hard. Miss that guy

**rickikardashian** (10): the jail line took me off guard the first time i heard it

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is an absolute banger

**runaway3212** (10): Better than the original

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The peak of rap features in pop music. The song was already great, and ODB’s energy elevated it.

**skargardin** (10): kinda pisses all over original fantasy

**timothy444** (10): Mariah Carey has this uncanny ability to create bops that stand the test of time.

**Yatcho** (10): a cultural reset

**Flegasaurus** (9.5): hell yeah!!!!!!!!!!

**seanderlust** (9.2): "I reached out to ODB and he wanted $15,000 to rap on the record,” Rooney said. “At the time, that was a lot of money, but it really wasn’t for Mariah Carey’s budget — so, no problem. He finally showed up, three hours late, and when he got there, it was about 10:30 at night. He had been drinking, and was on the phone when he walked in. Irate, screaming at some girl how he’s gonna come kill her, he’s going to kick her ass…and then whispering, ‘I love you.’ Then screaming again. This went on for an hour...He finally came out and was like, ‘Yo, pardon me, this bitch is driving me crazy. I need some Moet and Newports before we get into this record,” Rooney recalled. “I said, ‘It’s 12:30 at night now bro, I don’t know where we’re going to get Moet from.’ He started yelling at the assistants, calling them white devils, saying, ‘You white devils, y’all don’t want black people to have shit.’ They went out for like an hour, and the only thing they could find were some Heinekens. He was so disgusted, he threw a bottle on the floor...The unpredictable Ol’ Dirty Bastard would end up falling asleep three times during the recording according to Rooney" um :elmo:

**TheEvilNightman** (9.2): R.I.P. O.D.B.

**1998tweety** (9): the original is immaculate but I did have to take a point off for the remix

**2dina3dworld** (9): the intro let it down, but otherwise, this is iconic, and the "When you walk by" bit makes me feel like a bad bitch

**nooodisaster** (9): "what're you gonna do when you get out of jail? i'm gonna do a remix" - 6ixnine to nicki minaj

**waluigiest** (9): Fantastic song. The remix tho? “What you gonna do when you get out of jail?” “I’m gonna do a remix” is legendary

**bulforster** (8.5): I like ODB's presence and appreciate how genre bending this was for the time but I miss what they got rid of from the original's production.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): I prefer the original tbh because I think it flows better but it’s still a great song

**fishingfor8** (8): this is fun

**FKJVMMP** (8): How does this even happen. Can’t wait for Ariana Grande ft. 6ix9ine.

**frogaranaman** (8): I like the original better but this is still good

**linothy** (8): the vibe has very young mc vibes WHICH IS GOOD this song goes hard i always like hearing it

**ManofOranges** (8): I do prefer the regular version but this is still fine.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's good but the original is just blows it out of the water

**steelstepladder** (8): If there was a version with the ODB verse but the original mix I'd die happy

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): the lil synth line lives in my head rent free 24/7

**camerinian** (7.5): There better not be any ODB slander going on here

**SRTviper** (7.5): Definitely the best Mariah song in this rate.

**starlitsuns** (7.5): did this need a feature? like mariah does not need a man/group of men to help her carry a track haven’t we already established this

**TiltControls** (7.5): ODB's a good addition, but i vastly prefer the original's production

**cremeebrulee** (7): not my fave mariah song and is overshadowed by the fact that ABMB is here :(

**ImADudeDuh** (7): yeah its revolutionary but i just don’t like this version as much as the original

**jsonphile** (7): honestly I don’t care for this song as much compared to the other iconic Mariah song. And Ol Dirty Bastard is fun, but ehhh not sure he’s necessary on this

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): So catchy

**pat-rickstar** (7): This would be at least a 9 from me without the man

**slimboyfriend** (7): I don't enjoy the restructuring of this remix

**vayyiqra** (7): This is kind of a bop

**wavingwolves** (6.8): yeah i have to say i'm not too fond of this remix now

**fadedblue09** (6): Ehh I get this pioneered the whole rapper remix thing, but it just doesn't do much for me. Maybe the rap verses could've went harder or more vocal acrobatics from Mimi would’ve been appreciated.

**SmileAndTears** (6): eh, its fine

**NFLfreak98** (5.5): I’ve never once actually wanted to hear a Mariah Carey song

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): I didn’t really like it. I prefer the original version over this remix.

**CarlieScion** (5): this such a dissapointment right next to always be my baby lol

**Jackalope117** (5): ODB does not fit in this song, Mariah still slays tho

**letsallpoo** (5): i always preferred the original

**rotating3Dtext** (5): sorry I didn’t need that feature

**Tolk1en** (5): please no features with Mariah

**wryn\_** (5): i love the original but this is a total mess

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): It's a little bit better than I expected.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): ruined by a rap verse that does not work at all

**Stryxen** (3.9): well at least mariah sounds great :D

**plastichaxan** (3.5): i'm sorry but no

**sirpancakeXI** (3): this version is so unnecessary, the rap part doesn't really fit the song

**musical\_pyn** (0): I really wanted to give this at least some points because at least it’s still Fantasy in some capacity, but I think that makes it worse

One realization that I've had after doing years of rates is that Florence + The Machine is a bit of a one trick pony. Don't get me wrong, her highs are immaculate, but every other song of hers just feels derivative of the formula laid out by those hits. This being a soundtrack song, meaning she didn't even make one of her albums, is particularly emblematic of that problem. It's also nearly 7 minutes long which is just way too long for something like this. Submitted by /u/SideBTrack8.

---

**1998tweety** (10): this takes a minute to hit...but when it hits it hits

**akanewasright** (10): I have a friend that will threaten me if I give this a low score. BUT I actually do like this song. It does not feel 7 minutes to me at all. It’s really well paced

**endcreditouilles** (10): whew the build on this one. Florence is always on my mind, living rent free

**fallenriot** (10): gorgeous, I yearn to this one on the regular

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I wasn't even aware Florence did a song for this soundtrack, but this is a really good song!

**Stryxen** (10): the girls are bawling

**TiltControls** (10): I don't know how I missed this Florence song, but I'm glad I've found it now. It's fantastic!

**timothy444** (10): Such a shame that such a beautiful song is tied to such a terrible movie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): Do we need another Florence top 5? No, not with the stacked lineup of this rate. Is this still a gorgeous, nearly immaculate song? Yes, and I refuse to lie about it.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): yes florence deliver the epic for an underwhelming movie

**jsonphile** (9.5): can Florence and the Machine even make a bad song?

**AHSWeeknd** (9): this makes me want to watch the movie. Florence is a genius.

**bulforster** (9): If there's one thing Florence will always deliver on, it's an epic soundtrack cut.

**Flegasaurus** (9): its so epic!!!!

**runaway3212** (9): I love Florence's voice so much

**seanderlust** (9): oh florence. I swear one of these days you're gonna win a rate. i don't think today's your day, but someday. </3

**waluigiest** (9): she’s so good

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.5): i bet the movie people wanted like a normal soundtrack song and florence was like nu uh i gotta be Dramatic

**CarlieScion** (8): this is cute, but not her best!

**ReallyCreative** (8): I really like it, but there was no reason for it to be nearly 7 minutes Ms. Welch

**skargardin** (8): gorgeous

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): This is such a Florence song. She has such a distinctive sound.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): congratulations to our runner up florence

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): nice but too long to the point of dragging

**Yatcho** (7.5): this is mid for her sorry

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.2): Florence ex Machina

**bbfan132** (7): it was pretty but i wanted a bit more, in all honesty

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Pretty strings, but it's very tepid for a Florence song, which makes it fitting for a soundtrack, I guess.

**fishingfor8** (7): too long

**ManofOranges** (7): It's nice, but it's also kinda long.

**nooodisaster** (7): Y'all we can still rate Falling, it's really good!

**steelstepladder** (6.5): I feel bad for rating this so low but I think Florence has done better way than this.

**chihuahuazero** (6): And we are here to rob Florence once again.

**fadedblue09** (6): It's a textbook Florence song alright: the grand production, powerful vocals, heavy imagery but...7 minutes? You're gonna have to do better than that.

**freav** (6): I always thought I should check out Florence's stuff but this is kinda boring

**plastichaxan** (6): i feel weird giving a rating this low to goddess florence but...i'm kinda tired of amazing artists releasing mid songs for mid movies and their soundtracks

**SRTviper** (6): Well this is a 2010’s power ballad.

**vayyiqra** (6): Florence cannot make truly bad songs but she can make some that are merely okay-ish and it seems to me this is one of them. I'm also not against long songs but am not sure this one needed to be nearly 7 minutes.

**wavingwolves** (6): this is good but it's not the best from her

**wryn\_** (6): pink floyd and all of progressive "rock" completely made irrelevant by this song

**2dina3dworld** (5): I just didn't vibe with it

**camerinian** (5): I love Florence but god what is it about making soundtrack songs that just sucks all the interesting out of indie pop singers

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I like Florence but I listened to this like four times and wow this is so long and kinda pointless

**Roxieloxie** (3): i dont really enjoy the song theres nothing much to say, so instead i will use the rest of this comment to bitch about the miss pergrine movie. They truly fumbled the bag so much. everything from it getting stuck in development hell , to tim burton getting it, to him saying that he basically doesnt think poc need better representation and proceeding to make Samuel L Jackson the only character of color in the film and also the villain . To just the really strange decision to switch the powers of the love interest character and one of the other kids to make it so that the love interest barely has any independence on her own. This series is so so good and I love it dearly but oh my god this movie fucked up something great

**linothy** (1.5): nonono this is so HHHHHH

In the 2+ years since this became a smash hit I've always had more appreciation for it than actual enjoyment. The muddy, metallic pop/rock sound has been a consistent step up from 5SOS' pop/punk roots but it's a lot better utilized on more subtle, less repetitive songs like Want You Back and Easier imo. Submitted by /u/IDontWorkHereAtAll.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Bop

**astrologicalangel** (10): I desperately want to give this my 11 but I cannot in good conscience

**cremeebrulee** (10): absolute BANGER!!!! deserves a better placement than what it’s gonna get

**hikkaru** (10): huge bop. ty to whoever submitted this so we get to rate 5sos at least once

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a major bop! I haven’t heard much from them and wasn’t really into them but this song is amazing.

**rickikardashian** (10): i will not rest until i trick this entire sub to rate all of youngblood

**runaway3212** (10): An absolute bop

**timothy444** (10): Hated this so much because the radio kept on overplaying it but now that I don't hear it anymore, I can appreciate how incredible this track is.

**vayyiqra** (10): banger

**waluigiest** (10): okay when the chorus hits I can’t help but lose my mind

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): i honestly can't hate a 5SOS song

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): say it with me popheads, men can make good music

**2dina3dworld** (9): 5SOS isn't the future of rock, they aren't ground breaking, but they make some pretty good bops.

**camerinian** (9): There is no reason that this song should have gone this hard

**FKJVMMP** (9): So is this like... About anything? I don’t understand how songs like this get made, it’s love song mad libs. Bangs though.

**frogaranaman** (9): this fucks so hard idc what any of y’all sau

**ImADudeDuh** (9): it’s a bop, but it’s not like super amazing.

**ManofOranges** (9): Never in my life did I think I would truly enjoy a song by 5 seconds of summer but here we are.

**nooodisaster** (9): Their best song easily. Before this song I thought 5SOS was a meme but this at least made me recognize their bop potential.

**pat-rickstar** (9): I am not usually a fan of 5SOS but I do really like this song, it will probably be done dirty because of misandry!

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): This is one of those songs that are elevated by its music video.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): I was prepared to tear this song to shreds because it was really annoying when I was hearing it everyday, but now that I’ve listened to it for the first time in a long time, I realize that it’s actually a bop

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): Not my favorite song from 5SOS3 but its still a chill song nonetheless. Im glad someone sent it in.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This is that song?? (From Morocco, yes that’s where I remember you from!!1!)

**bbfan132** (8): banger, their best song along with she looks so perfect

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): this song hits all my dramatic bitch pleasure centers

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this song is so good it almost makes me forget everything else about 5sos sucks

**wavingwolves** (8): i know this one will be done dirty but i love it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): I never minded hearing this on the radio at work

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): i’ve disliked every other song i’ve ever heard from this group but something about this tune (hint: the chorus) hits

**chihuahuazero** (7): This is 5SOS's biggest hit for a reason.

**fallenriot** (7): wayyyy overplayed but it reminds me of the summer and when I was actually happy

**fishingfor8** (7): I still smile every time I randomly hear this song out in a grocery store, or on the radio, or on some random playlist a friend is playing. Its a good song.

**jsonphile** (7): usually 5SOS feels like a bad mix of fall out boy and one direction, but they managed to put out a good song here

**linothy** (7): i've listened to this before and it's just chilling tbh

**skargardin** (7): can't believe that listening to this is making me feel nostalgic

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Every live performance 5SOS does is better than their studio versions. Listen to the from the vault version of easier if you don't know what I'm talking about.

**brenda\_official** (6): as a gen z this song makes me want to do a revolution!!!! 🤪🤪🤪

**Flegasaurus** (5): i've heard this song so many times that its just noise to me

**SRTviper** (5): I like the drums

**LazyDayLullaby** (4): seconds too long

**slimboyfriend** (4): it sounds like bland boy band noise

**wryn\_** (4): i know everyone likes this but this guy's voice pisses me off so much omg

**anothertown** (3.5): why are we still doing this

**plastichaxan** (3.5): this is the first song that poses a conflict in me cause i don't want to be mean or rate someone's submission too low, but at the same time i don't want to lie, much to think about

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): I had a professor in college define bullshit as "something non-nutritive" and I think that sums this song up well

**sandyfishnets** (1.5): his voice is so grating ugh

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): 🧐

**fadedblue09** (1): The world does not another Shawn Mendes-esque soulless singer, especially four of them.

**Stryxen** (0): i just despise this song it’s so annoying, like why is he shrieking?

The most mainstream rock of the various indie submissions to this rate which is why I probably liked it most out of those. Submitted by /u/TiltControls.

---

**steelstepladder** (11): Maybe I'm just a sucker for this sound but when that "Sooooooooooo loooooooong, myyyyyyy FRIEEEEEEEEND" hits its transcendental

**Brendon-Urine** (10): instantly catchy, fun, beautiful. just another stroke of excellence amirite fellas

**cremeebrulee** (10): me giving this a 10 so it can make day 3: it aint much but its honest work

**rickikardashian** (10): this used to be the intro for a youtube channel i used to love and i had to go through so many layers of searching to find it each time because i could never remember the name of the song…. and it was always so worth it

**rotating3Dtext** (10): one of the strokes’ best songs

**runaway3212** (10): Slaps!!!

**TiltControls** (10): I thought submitting one of my top 15 favourite songs of all time would be an easy 11, but unfortunately it's not the only song from that list in this rate. Was a hard choice, but couldn't give it the 11 over the other. Still, it's probably my favourite indie rock song of all time and I hope it makes it far! This song is so catchy and the guitar work is fantastic, especially how it slightly changes on each go of the chorus.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): How did I miss The Strokes completely during their rise to fame? I love this. It’s so much fun. I have no idea what he’s saying and I don’t care.

**NFLfreak98** (9.5): I stand by my hot take that Angles is the best Strokes album

**akanewasright** (9): A bop

**frogaranaman** (9): yes I am depressed, what about it

**wavingwolves** (9): one of the 3 good songs on angles

**Yatcho** (9): Angles is so fucking underrated

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I really like it but I'm excited for it to get robbed, idk

**seanderlust** (8.7): this sounds like a strokes song made in a lab. I mean, it's good, but sonically it's definitely a song by the strokes.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I was ready to trash this given my apathy towards indie rock, but I surprisingly liked it. Really catchy and nostalgic.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**camerinian** (8): This is an 8 on the rate scale, but if we move over to the “Please compare everything The Strokes do to Is This It” scale, it has to be a 2 sorry I don’t make the rules

**linothy** (8): the strokes always go hard!!! i would kiss this song's forehead

**pat-rickstar** (8): I'm enjoying this as I write this comment which is why I gave it an 8, but I'll probably forget what it sounds like in 5 minutes, like every other time I've listened to this

**Stryxen** (7.8): well that was super fun

**bbfan132** (7.5): enjoyed this! should listen to more of their stuff

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute but it doesn’t stand out much

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): Whinging guitars

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): The Strokes are hit and miss for me. I didn’t enjoy this at first, but after a couple listens it started hitting.

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): Indie rock isn’t really my thing but this was good ig

**sarcasticsobs** (7): bold to not choose one of Approved* The Strokes’ records, good for you

**skargardin** (7): omg i remember this from when it used to be on the radio way back HELP

**vayyiqra** (7): Good to see at least some of the rock songs in this rate are alright

**2dina3dworld** (6): this is musical mayo. Sometimes bearable, sometimes a bop, sometimes not good at all.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I like the production but it drowns out the vocals

**timothy444** (6): Not my kind of music but this is ok

**kirby31200** (5): Not really my type

**SRTviper** (5): Why did Pitchfork give this album a 5.9 and how do I blame all women?

**nooodisaster** (4): str8

**plastichaxan** (3): yawning emoji

**anothertown** (2): no <3

I've only known Grace Potter from her feature on Kenny Chesney's "You And Tequila" and her song "Stars" which was randomly a staple on American Idol/The Voice/The X Factor back when I watched that. This shows more personality than I've ever seen from her, with really interesting guitar work to boot. Submitted by /u/mother_rucker.

---

**astrologicalangel** (10): this is dangerously catchy

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow I love this, it's really catchy and gives off the vibe of a slightly more mature Avril Lavigne. And yes, a lesbian bop! Although I'm quite surprised to see that this was released under Hollywood Records 0_o

**ManofOranges** (10): Unexpected hit

**ReallyCreative** (10): Just a charming and fun bop

**rickikardashian** (10): there’s something about an abba-like synth that brings out the best out of white girls

**runaway3212** (10): The message is great but the sound is so good too

**sirpancakeXI** (10): her voice is amazing

**TiltControls** (10): Love Grace Potter! Thank you to whoever submitted this!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.7): Grace Potter is so damn talented!! I like to think of this song as the spiritual sequel to Robyn’s Call Your Girlfriend, but make it rock n’ roll.

**seanderlust** (9.6): is that an abba sample I hear? :eyes: i have never heard anything by grace potter before this but i really like her! her voice reminds me a bit of elle king or gin wigmore, both artists i love.

**akanewasright** (9): Bop

**anothertown** (9): wtf a bop.. Mariah is unfazed though

**steelstepladder** (9): One of my favorite new songs I've found this rate!

**vayyiqra** (9): Wtf this is great

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.7): Stream Grace & Frankie!

**bbfan132** (8.5): grace sounded awesome here!!! happy to have discovered this

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is a cute bop!

**Yatcho** (8.5): is that the Hung Up abba sample played on a recorder in the chorus? work Miss Grace!

**freav** (8.2): really catchy

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): Sabrina Carpenter could never.

**CarlieScion** (8): her voice is so good

**cremeebrulee** (8): is that a gimmex3 sample bc if it is LMAO

**fishingfor8** (8): good vocal delivery

**kappyko** (8): this won me over in the end

**NFLfreak98** (8): This is really just Frances Quinlan making a pop jam

**starlitsuns** (8): wow what a woman loving woman anthem

**SRTviper** (7.8): That little keyboard bit in the left channel is the real star here.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I feel like this song is so close to being a real stand-out, but it's just missing a little bit of oomph to really propel it

**1998tweety** (7.5): oh wow this bops

**bulforster** (7.5): That gimme x3 synth in the chorus panned all the way to the left is really distracting.

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): the faux gimme gimme sorta sound the chorus has is really throwing me off but i over all like this

**skargardin** (7): I have a faint memory hearing this somewhere before, it's nice

**slimboyfriend** (7): could be gay even though I know it's not :/

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): lesbian rights!!

**timothy444** (7): Alright country song

**linothy** (6.7): intriguing start, made me do a lil dancey dance. is she in love with women omg as she should.

**Stryxen** (6.7): sure it’s just a little bop tbh

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.5): Your gi-hurl

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Poker Face and Sexxx Dreams are quaking!

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This sounds like a Spice Girls song

**nooodisaster** (6): thumbs up

**wavingwolves** (6): i'm giving this a bonus point for being sapphic

**2dina3dworld** (4): second best song that samples Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

**plastichaxan** (3): the disappointment when this ended up being a straight song and not just a bad gay one i hate it here

Very chill vibes. Not a huge fan of Simz' voice or the production individually, but it does come together decently. Submitted by /u/ElizabethDDoS.

---

**bulforster** (11): As masterful as it is insightful as it is savage as it is heartbreaking.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Please listen to GREY Area if you haven't already.

**endcreditouilles** (10): allll night long I've been listening to this album, Little Simz is so dang talented, really hope she's big one day

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Little Simz is pure talent.

**seanderlust** (10): i love this because it shows such emotional maturity even though she's clearly hurt. god this rate is giving me so much new music to check out...there arent enough hours in the DAY :sob:

**skargardin** (10): go off queen

**steelstepladder** (10): Close to my 11

**Stryxen** (10): I already know this is getting so robbed but if we rated the album she would win. She was literally talking to the other songs when she said “nobody rates you”

**akanewasright** (9.5): holy SHIT

**camerinian** (9.5): thank you to whoever submitted this because I finally went back and relistened to Grey Area for the first time in forever off the back of this. What a stellar piece of work

**freav** (9.5): fantastic album

**2dina3dworld** (9): not Little Simz best, but still a nice ditty

**CarlieScion** (9): her voice is sooooooothing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): love me some Little Simz, she’s so talented

**ReallyCreative** (9): this is weird but really good, would have done well in the Pollen Rate I think

**wavingwolves** (9): stan little simz y'all

**bbfan132** (8.5): these lyrics… damn

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): she so talented I hope she blows up more

**NFLfreak98** (8.5): If the chorus was better this would be a straight up 10

**Brendon-Urine** (8): she really went off on this dude huh... wow...

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): nobody is doing it like her

**kirby31200** (8): The sampled chorus is fantastic

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Damn.

**SRTviper** (8): Wouldn't be my first choice from GREY Area, but still pretty great.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): get his ass queen

**vayyiqra** (8): This lady is very Bri""ish

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): A chill bop. Love the production and lyrics.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): its alright but i can see this growing on me (i did like selfish though)

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Her rapping is fire but the chorus could've gone harder

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This production is great

**SmileAndTears** (7): this song DID NOT need to be 5 minutes long

**wryn\_** (7): i don't remember liking grey area that much so this was a lot better than i expected

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**runaway3212** (6.5): Okay

**nooodisaster** (6): This song is soooo personal, holy shit. People throw around "it sounds like a diary entry", but this is so blunt, telling, and straightforward it truly feels like that to the extent few songs I've ever listened to have.

**starlitsuns** (6): this song took a few tries to finally give me a rating I thought it deserved. Alas, I was not a big fan of this song, and I decided to give it an average rating.

**timothy444** (6): I like the lyrics and meaning of this but jeez the delivery... :skull:

**fallenriot** (5): spoken word raps aren’t really my thing but I liked the sung parts

**sirpancakeXI** (4): her voice is a bit too monotone for me to enjoy

One of the most iconic EDM songs of the decade? The nostalgic tone really works and makes it timeless (unlike a lot of EDM, which sounds dated upon release.) Submitted by /u/starlitsuns.

---

**frogaranaman** (11): Porter Robinson and Madeon albums rated WHEN

**hikkaru** (11): i need this to make it as far as possible in this rate. if it goes day 1 i'm going to selegend myself im not kidding (maybe). we've gotta rate albums from these two sometime

**rotating3Dtext** (11): a weeaboo edm classic, idc idc

**starlitsuns** (11): if this does well I'll actually be surprised because, you know, men and edm. (also porter and madeon rate when? maybe next rate cycle if this does well? idk, I said if shelter does well I’d actually submit a 2014/2015 edm rate, so… we’ll see)

**TheEvilNightman** (11): I adore everything about this track.

**TiltControls** (11): One of my favourite songs of all time. Narrowly beat out my own submission for the 11, but this song is just too good to ignore. Not to mention one of the best music videos I have ever seen. Stream Nuture when it comes out and please let's do a Adventure/Worlds/??? rate at some point!

**Yatcho** (11): Poter Robinson is a KING and this is one of my favorite EDM songs of all time, the video is the cherry on top

**1998tweety** (10): literally the definition of a cultural reset, yall will do it dirty I just know it

**bigbigbee** (10): GORGEOUS. Absolutely gorgeous. My other 11 contender. Thank you so much, submitter. I love what Porter Robinson was doing a little earlier than this on Worlds, but this is really the best version of his sound from that time. This song makes me nostalgic for something that I’m not even sure I’ve experienced – feels slightly timeless and outside of this world, but something in me aches for it.

**bulforster** (10): why am I crying??

**fishingfor8** (10): oh throwback, absolutely love this song. This is an edm classic

**Flegasaurus** (10): YAYY YAY YAY !!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I was on youtube since 2011, so of course I stan this

**Jackalope117** (10): anime MV bangs too

**pheromenos** (10): sorry porter you can't have this 11 because another anime song bested you...maybe next time

**runaway3212** (10): So good

**skargardin** (10): this song makes me so nostalgic even though im not particularly nostalgic about it in itself

**steelstepladder** (10): Best EDM song ever made

**timothy444** (10): Words cannot begin to explain how amazing this song is and accompanied by the music video, Shelter just blows my mind in its storytelling and raw emotion.

**CarlieScion** (9): VibezTM

**nooodisaster** (9): THIS is the pop I want to go back to: No discernable words, chorus is just a robot trapped in a washing machine, and yet I'm somehow melancholy after listening.

**rickikardashian** (9): this could be a chainsmokers song and you have to accept it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the music video accounts for at least 5 of the points im giving this song btw

**vayyiqra** (9): This sounds like Passion Pit meets the 1975 and that combo is oddly really good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.8): This puts me in a good mood instantly

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Weaboos deserve SOME rights

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i was really into this genre of music when i was in college, but it’s not really my taste anymore. still, i could see myself really digging this song when it first came out!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this like generic sad boy edm music but I do like it

**camerinian** (6.5): I like Porter Robinson but this is the kinda music that made me turn off him. It's just tropical house, and it's good tropical house, but I know he can do so much more.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Idk this isn't really my style of music

**Stryxen** (6.5): I could probably watch any league of legends montage and hear this but ngl it bops

**bbfan132** (6): this does nothing for me rip, it sounds ok though

**ReallyCreative** (6): It's mediocre but pleasant to listen to

**fallenriot** (5.5): the underwater-sounding vocals and the beat-drop chorus don’t really do it for me, pick one

**LazyDayLullaby** (5.1): Helter Shelter

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Not really a fan of EDM unless the vocals draw me in which did not happen here

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Madeon makes good music, sometimes

**SRTviper** (5): Damn what car commercial is this from?

**anothertown** (4): royalty free type beat

**fadedblue09** (4): Sounds like Owl City for people who think they're too cool for Owl City

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): This reminds me of generic music you hear in one of those “oddly satisfying” YouTube videos. Not good, but not offensive.

**wavingwolves** (4): this was so boring whew

**linothy** (3): i didn't like the high voices Get Them Out

**2dina3dworld** (1): tf when this was on mainstream radio and playing in stores 24/7. Its so overplayed for a song that was just average to begin with

This was the song I submitted, but I honestly don't have much to say about it other than its a ton of fun and I'm surprised it didn't do better!! Neneh has a ton of personality and there's like 4 hooks in there.

---

**chihuahuazero** (11): Wow, this is a fresh record, considering how early it was released in hip-hop's history. This is an interesting intersection between Swede-pop and hip-hop.

**wryn\_** (11): honestly i have no idea how well this will do but it's just the best, the guitar at the end, that chorus...just a perfect pop song

**akanewasright** (10): Wait there was a Cher Lloyd song that had this chorus... but much worse.

**bbfan132** (10): YESSSS THANK YOU TK FOR SUBMITTING THIS GEM

**camerinian** (10): I wasn't actually too familiar with this song before the rate, and now I don't know how I ever did without it consciously in my life. What a beat, what a hook, what an attitude. God damn

**freav** (10): yesssss

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love tk

**pat-rickstar** (10): This is a classic, you'd all better respect it. Don’t ya get fresh with me!

**ReallyCreative** (10): one of my favorite discoveries from this rate, just a fun song!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): you can hear how much fun she's having

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Bop!! This is such a dynamic song that still sounds fresh despite being distinctly 80s. Mabel’s mom did THAT.

**seanderlust** (10): huh? ssssssucka??

**skargardin** (10): omg i haven't heard this bop in yeeears

**starlitsuns** (10): this is a lot of fun but it’s probably going out late day 1/early day 2, so this is getting extra points.

**steelstepladder** (10): Looking good in every way

**bulforster** (9): The slightly stilted 80s rap is more than made up for by the iconic 80s production and Neneh's charisma. If we couldn't have Let's Go to the Mall, I'm glad we got this.

**cremeebrulee** (9): ohhh i never knew the name of this song but i always did like it!

**frogaranaman** (9): whoever put this classic into the rate - thank u sm

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I had never heard this one before and I assumed it was by some random indie pop girl (like a lot of the songs in this rate) until that chorus hit and I was like “wait is this from the ‘80s?” This sounds very fresh, and it’s a total bop too

**Yatcho** (9): who said she was biting off Damn Daniel

**Stryxen** (8.6): buffalo more like buffahigh scores

**fadedblue09** (8.5): The instrumental is pretty memorable, but the rap makes it feel a little novelty.

**Flegasaurus** (8.5): omg yes!!!!!

**jsonphile** (8.5): wow this Janet Jackson ripoff is really good

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): a bop! love the synths

**NFLfreak98** (8.1): I wasn’t quite feeling this but then that guitar tone in the chorus came in and they added some saxophone and yeah ok I get it now

**AHSWeeknd** (8): why am I a sucker for anything from the 80s?

**CarlieScion** (8): WOW this was good but loses point for its length

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i mean jokes on you guys, i like this song unironically

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk what the title means but it slaps

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): very fresh for the year it came out in

**intheaftermath** (7.5): niche market but this sounds like an animation meme

**2dina3dworld** (7): it's not my thing, but objectively, it's pretty good

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): Could have been a little shorter and concise but otherwise a solid track.

**kirby31200** (7): I'm not sure what a buffalo stance consists of

**wavingwolves** (7): i think the right place to listen to this is at a gym

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is alright

**TheEvilNightman** (6.5): I'd love this if it was two minutes shorter.

**SRTviper** (6.2): This sounds like 80’s worship from 2014. That’s pretty impressive.

**fallenriot** (6): I liked the chorus but the rest just wasn’t for me

**linothy** (6): omg young mc vibes Again but its 5 mins long

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5.5): i hated this the first time i listened to it but its grown on me now

**timothy444** (5): Average, plus the intro annoys me

**nooodisaster** (4): Hello high-hat.... Hi tambourine.... Oh, hey DJ...

**runaway3212** (4): bad

I'm one of the biggest Bree Runway supporters on this subreddit, following her closely since the release day of "Damn Daniel." That being said, I don't think she had quite figured out how to balance her rap skills with her pop girl aspirations at this point. It's still an enjoyable listen because of her infectious personality but it needs a bit more polish to be on par with her later work. Submitted by /u/anothertown.

---

**brenda\_official** (11): i believe in breemale supremacy

**DaHumanTorch** (11): stan bree runway and give damn daniel your 11's in the 2020 ep rate

**pat-rickstar** (11): This gets my 11 over my own submission, because I was going to submit it but someone already did! I love Bree so much and this is probably her best song in my eyes, I love everything about it from the verses to the instrumental to the bridge which is just heavenly. Hope this at least makes day 3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bree Runway don’t miss

**akanewasright** (10): THANK YOU WHOEVER SUBMITTED THIS! We were prob never gonna rate this otherwise

**anothertown** (10): the first time I ever listened to this and heard her go "but she fuck with my SOOOOONG" and that chorus opens up, I swear I saw God

**bulforster** (10): Her best song!!

**CarlieScion** (10): the tkyola continues

**cremeebrulee** (10): not my fave bree song but it’s still a smash . if this gets robbed a la AS4 i will be PISSED

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): When this wins to avenge Damn Daniel omg

**fallenriot** (10): FUTURE QUEEN OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY YUP YUP

**FKJVMMP** (10): This woman is an icon.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when bree runway wins 2 rates this cycle WOW!

**plastichaxan** (10): this is the song i discovered bree with and it really means a lot to be able to rate it cause it really made me so excited to listen to anything she released after, and she has not disappointed once

**Roxieloxie** (10): banger

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Bree Runway only makes bangers. I love the switch-up between the energetic rap verses and the melodic chorus.

**skargardin** (10): bree runway is the moment

**starlitsuns** (10): this is an instant 10 because it’s bree, also give damn daniel your 11s in the 2020 ep rate next month!!

**Stryxen** (10): can i give this a 20 - Bree has such a distinct sound but every song of hers sounds unique

**seanderlust** (9.5): okay you know what popheads you might be onto something with this Bree Runway character

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): Loving the energy on this track. Watch me add this to my workout playlist even though I haven’t worked out in weeks.

**Flegasaurus** (9): YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (9): Tinashe outsold slightly.

**ReallyCreative** (9): see your girlfriend she despise me but she fuck with my songs

**rotating3Dtext** (9): i love everything bree runway has released

**runaway3212** (9): More like 9ON

**vayyiqra** (9): banger

**waluigiest** (9): this is so lit

**wavingwolves** (9): this is a day 3 song

**SRTviper** (8.7): I like the beginning part when they screech like a bird.

**Yatcho** (8.7): I just know Tinashe felt a disturbance in the force when this came out

**fadedblue09** (8.5): As someone who doesn't get Damn Daniel, I must say I quite liked this. Ended Tinashe for sure.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): stan!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): bawp

**bbfan132** (8): a bop, need to listen to 2000AND4EVA soon

**nooodisaster** (8): this is artpop

**wryn\_** (8): i always thought that bree's manic style was too much for me but this actually goes so hard

**2dina3dworld** (7): the prechorus kinda killed the hype, but otherwise this is pretty alright

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): not bad but not my favorite Bree Runway song, I feel like “Little Nokia” kinda did what this song wanted to but better

**sirpancakeXI** (6.5): i can't take this song seriously at all because the background vocal in the song sound like it is repeating a word in my native language which either mean "people" or "endure" which just make me want to laugh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the chorus feels really out of place in this??? i would've liked it a lot more if it was just the verses

**1998tweety** (4): I like some Bree Runway songs but this ain't great.

**timothy444** (3): this isnt tinashe wtf

**Tolk1en** (3): I'm really not fond of of the verses :sob:

**LazyDayLullaby** (2): 2OFF

/u/ReallyCreative does it again! This funky throwback has a ton of soul and is a much better produced song than I expected from an artist with 2000 monthly listeners on Spotify. The vocoder really ties everything together and makes this a very special song. Hope she gets more attention in the future!

---

**ReallyCreative** (11): I chose this personal attack because this sub desperately needs to be exposed to the joyful, cheeky, and clever brand of quirk pop that DEQN SUE has to offer. She's here to put the millennial American job market on blast, and do it with a glossy, energized sheen.

**intheaftermath** (10): The robotic synthesizer at the end is amazing. Was honestly nice to just jam out to my insecurities about starting college

**ManofOranges** (10): Omg guys??? Are yall hearing this???

**pat-rickstar** (10): Probably my favourite of the songs I'd never of heard of before here, what a banger! Definitely going to check out the rest of this album

**Roxieloxie** (10): Okay as someone who is 19 living out presumably the rest of my college years in my childhood bedroom this song not only fucks, but its highly relevant. Maybe /u/reallycreative made some points here

**runaway3212** (10): Same bestie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): MOOD!! Super relatable lyrics and groovy sound. Can Deqn Sue be the next Popheads darling? She deserves the acclaim!

**seanderlust** (10): funky! "adulting" millennial discourse but make it charming

**timothy444** (10): I love the Charity Rates because we get to listen to some weird-ass picks like video game songs but also unknown artists that we never would've known existed before. And sometimes that leads to some great new music discovery, and new fans. This is no exception. I'm already hooked on this funky beat and I can't wait to explore her discography because of it :)

**kappyko** (9.5): bitch omg

**kirby31200** (9.5): So relatable it hurts. But also groovy!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Wow, this was a really pleasant surprise! Thank you whoever submitted this bop

**1998tweety** (9): ok wait this BOPS

**CarlieScion** (9): their spotify bio 'ALTERNATIVE QUIRKY POP' so i must stan as to not be a hypocrite

**fallenriot** (9): rina’s looking to team up and end capitalism once and for all

**Flegasaurus** (9): !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Damn, this is really good. I hope this artist makes it big someday.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): relatable, etc

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I love a relatable bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): Holy shit, this is a bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): As one of the, like, two DEQN SUE fans on the sub I would recommend checking out either of her albums, she does exactly the kind of quirky ‘80s influenced alt-pop that many other smaller acts have found success doing and it’s kinda disappointing that she’s never managed to find a niche with fans of this crowd–mostly because her music is good but also because this scene is painfully white. She’s got a really quirky lyrical style that’s kinda twisted at times

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.5): this is a full mood

**JunkyGS** (8.5): never heard this before, but bop bop bop!

**Yatcho** (8.5): this bops!

**TheEvilNightman** (8.1): AJR but for the gays.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): I’m in love with her sound.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Yes the economy does suck, very relatable sentiment.

**bulforster** (8): too real

**fadedblue09** (8): It bangs, but I think the lyrics are too on the nose, even though I could relate to it lol.

**jsonphile** (8): that’s a great guitar riff right there, feels kinda like a 80s new wave song

**skargardin** (8): so true

**SRTviper** (8): Hell yeah. IDK how to do shit.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me listening to this song with 20 past due assignments that i haven't started yet sitting in my canvas account : so true bestie

**vayyiqra** (8): Relatable bop

**waluigiest** (8): it’s silly, relatable, and a bit of a bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): tbh this bops more than i expected for a song thats basically buzzfeed “adulting”

**starlitsuns** (7.5): invented “adulting”

**steelstepladder** (7.5): This kinda soured on me with every listen. The music is great but man the lyrics are a bit... ehhh.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): big fifa vibes

**2dina3dworld** (7): it was alright

**bbfan132** (7): fun to listen to

**fishingfor8** (7): cute

**FKJVMMP** (7): Starter lyricist too apparently, but I can’t say no to some sweet bass.

**linothy** (7): i liked it Before they started singing. not bad though??

**nooodisaster** (7): Relatable, we are relating.

**sandyfishnets** (7): love the lyrics

**wryn\_** (7): wasn't expecting this to come from such an indie artist, it's so enjoyable!

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.8): Middle part featuring a Starter Robot

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): instrumentally it's a bit generic. Kinda like DNCE.

**Tolk1en** (6): The beat and instruments are kinda lazy

**cremeebrulee** (5): that production bops a lot but these verses are kind of a personal attack on me so i’m not sure how to feel about this

**wavingwolves** (5): doesn't really do anything for me i'm afraid

**Stryxen** (4): girl what the hell is even this

**camerinian** (2): “hehehe sorry I can’t do adulting today” oh my god shut the FUCK up millennial

I think this song is very well written but the execution keeps it from being an all-time classic. Probably his best hook though and I love the autotune near the end. Submitted by /u/bigenemies.

---

**bbfan132** (10): modern classic

**Brendon-Urine** (10): another super nostalgic song for me, and the only Frank Ocean song I've really connected to.

**celladonn** (10): Bisexuals please rise for the national anthem

**cremeebrulee** (10): “my guy pretty like a girl” absolutely iconic opening lyrics……. any scores lower than an 8 here is biphobia sorry

**fishingfor8** (10): MY GUY PRETTY LIKE A GIRL AND HE GOT FIGHT STORIES TO TELL.

**Flegasaurus** (10): many thoughts head full

**frogaranaman** (10): my Apple Music shuffle LOVES to play the A$AP Rocky remix of this song

**plastichaxan** (10): frank please come back i'll do anything please

**waluigiest** (10): oh, the joy of being a Frank Ocean fan in 2016-2017. He dropped Blonde and a few loose singles that are among his best work. This song is a complete jam and the lyrics are clever and I just adore this song.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the bisexual anthem we deserve instead that one neighbourhood song

**sirpancakeXI** (9.6): maybe it is time for me to dive in his discography

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): classic we love a bisexuality anthem

**seanderlust** (9.5): hm. TIL coco chanel was both bisexual and a nazi sympathizer. okie dokie then. great song!

**steelstepladder** (9.5): Maybe I'm basic but this is one of his best imo

**2dina3dworld** (9): deserves a 9 purely for the "my guys pretty like a girl"

**akanewasright** (9): This is nice

**CarlieScion** (9): king

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Frank Ocean is brilliant, and "I see both sides like Chanel" is such an amazing line

**ReallyCreative** (9): I don't know what to say but it's very good

**Stryxen** (8.9): https://youtu.be/3UuvI8mR0Jk

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.6): Frank is consistently good, and it means a lot that he’s open about his bisexuality in his music.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): I need new music from him asap.

**camerinian** (8.5): The first half of this song is a 10, but the second half drags it to like a 7ish cos the hook isn’t nearly as good and it’s a lot less personal. That being said I do see both sides HA

**linothy** (8): i always like hearing this song tbh it makes me smile

**nooodisaster** (8): im too (gay? straight?) to get the metaphor but ;________;

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): I love how this song got Straight Guys singing along to “my guy pretty like a girl”.

**skargardin** (8): this is groovy

**vayyiqra** (8): Good but I still don't quite get the hype for his music

**runaway3212** (7.5): This is bad but I like it anyway

**1998tweety** (7): This is a bit overrated lowkey. It is some bi men representation though so I'll give it an extra point...

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I'm not a big fan of Frank, I only really like Channel Orange.

**freav** (7): I wish i liked Frank Ocean more

**timothy444** (7): This is a vibe

**wryn\_** (7): i was worried i was never going to really get this but it finally kind of worked here. this'll still probably be the lowest score though i know every gay loves this song

**pheromenos** (6.8): didn't this blow up on tiktok

**starlitsuns** (6.5): now I know where one of those stereotype profile tiktok trend songs comes from. it’s this song.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Frank Ocean (wanted to stan but never could idk why) is amazing but these vocals feel so forced

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Wait is this about the girl from *Scream Queens*? Anyways don’t like his voice here, usually as I listen to a song more my score goes up but the opposite was true for this. It just falls apart as it goes on and loses whatever what point it had initially

**SRTviper** (5.5): I know everyone loves Frank Ocean. His style just never left much of an impression on me.

**CritneySpearz** (5): I don’t get the hype for this song oop

**fadedblue09** (4): Probably my most disrespectful take for this rate oop. Sorry, but the falsetto and autotune are just grating (he ruined Slide btw, don't @ me). Also, the appeal of Frank goes over my head in general so I have a hard time appreciating this.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): a tiktok smash but honestly, past the opening lines, this song sucks
