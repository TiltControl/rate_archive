frogaranaman: so some of my potential 11s are still in (including my actual 11!) and this includes: "Bodys", "Between The Bars", "Casimir Pulaski Day", and "Once In A Lifetime". pretty decent list honestly. ~~still hurt about my other potential 11s.. "Not", "All My Friends", "Holland, 1945", "Teen Age Riot" I'm SO sorry~~

but excited for the results today regardless. also, as a fun lil game, guess which one is my actual! it's kinda obvious but still lol

NevenSuboticFanNo1: Contrary to popular opinion on indieheads I actually think you popheads did really well with eliminating the right songs. There are a couple of disagreements of course, but most of the good songs are still in.
[/r/popheads/comments/mjetdy/indieheads_exchange_day_2_this_is_not_my/gt9ue0a/]

=====

lastfollower: Well almost all the songs in the rate were good to begin with. I'm mostly disappointed in *Holland, 1945* and *All My Friends* going out day 1
[/r/popheads/comments/mjetdy/indieheads_exchange_day_2_this_is_not_my/gt9us4g/]

=====

qazz23: Mainly disappointed that Gold Soundz was the 4th worst. Teen Age Riot should have made it farther but understandable as it isn't very popheads friendly.
[/r/popheads/comments/mjetdy/indieheads_exchange_day_2_this_is_not_my/gt9vz9n/]

=====

NevenSuboticFanNo1: I agree on Teen Age Riot, that's a really good song, but also very much indie and not pop
[/r/popheads/comments/mjetdy/indieheads_exchange_day_2_this_is_not_my/gt9wv8z/]

=====

rickikardashian: I'm honest to god so shocked to see so much outrage over Gold Soundz being eliminated. I liked many songs in the rate, and that in specific just felt like a middle of the road to just enjoyable song

NFLfreak98: We (indieheads) do the entire reveal in the Reddit thread, revealing one song every 5 minutes or so, in ascending order.  

Popheads is similar but they reveal the songs eliminated in a livestream format which is linked in the body of the post (in this case they are using Beatsense) as well as in the thread

jasannn: You could either just keep refreshing the thread once the reveal starts at 4pm EST or join us in the beatsense room. In the thread, you'll see the placement of the song along with the avg score and comments other raters gave, as they are revealed in descending order. In the beatsense room, you'll be able to listen to the music/watch the music videos, along with some shitposts and interludes, with other users. You would be able to chat in the room with the other users there and see their reactions to their 11 losing in real time.

Tadevos: I keep saying this in different ways but there are very few songs in this last 20 that would upset me if they won.  Some would thrill me.  Some it's just like, "yeah, I can see that."  But most of the songs that would outrage me if they won--a vanishingly small subset--are already out.  I dunno, I think we, the indieheads, did a pretty bang-up job here

I really didn't expect Joy Division to make it to day 2 but man I'm happy they did. When I saw Disorder was the song we were rating I was worried that the only Joy Division song people would like would be Love Will Tear Us Apart because of the synths but a decent amount of people welcomed Disorder into their arms. Another song that straddled the line between day one and two for the duration of votes, this just did well enough to secure its well deserved spot in day two.

---

**TheGodAmongMen** (11): Revolutionary baseline and droning. Like a reverie or a warm blanket, it's something you can rely on to make yourself feel better...even if for just a brief moment.

**2dina3dworld** (10): I have a great affection for Joy Division, I know it‚Äôs basic, but I‚Äôve listened to Love Will Tear Us Apart so many times on repeat. Joy Division is a band that holds so much nostalgia for me.

**babygrillx** (10): masterpiece song from a masterpiece album

**bbfan132** (10): i love how intense this is

**bespectacIed** (10): Buying an unknown pleasures shirt cuz it's a cute print while only knowing THAT one jd song that's not even on the album -- my coming of age story

**Flegasaurus** (10): the only thing better than unknown pleasures is the inescapable hordes of unknown pleasures t-shirts

**frogaranaman** (10): I have a shirt of this album cover but it's crossed over with Keith Haring. It's dope.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): iconic

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kinda one of the worst songs off unknown pleasures but still a banger

**Roxieloxie** (10): i feel like a white 80s dad when i hear this and i think thats how im supposed to feel ???

**sandyfishnets** (10): goosebumps

**txrxwxwx** (10): a classic

**wavingwolves** (10): yes i love this and yes i've never felt happiness or the touch of a woman

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): I may be a pophead, but I have a sad taste for dark post-punk

**camerinian** (9.5): I just know I‚Äôm gonna be disgusted by the scores for this one. Please listen to the squiggly lines album popheads I beg you

**fkadizzy-1804** (9.5): Why the fuck have people only ever tried to get me to listen to Love Will Tear Us Apart (zzzz) in order to get me into Joy Division when this song was apparently right there all along?

**jsonphile** (9.5): seeing how much I love Love Will Tear Us Apart, I really should try listening to more of their music

**trashypanini** (9.5): t-shirt band make music /s. One those classic alternative-post/punk songs you‚Äôve heard somewhere somehow. Ian‚Äôs voice really sells the angst and turmoil.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): FEELING FEELING FEELING FEELING

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This is a bop, I can't really say anything more.

**Gonza\_90** (9): RIP Ian Curtis

**gwenflip** (9): Plz don‚Äôt disrespect Joy Division y‚Äôall

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I might do a lil boogie, just a lil one, a lil boogie

**musical\_pyn** (9): that synth(?) at the end makes this sooo good

**sirpancakeXI** (9): it takes a few listens but this finally grew on me

**TiltControls** (9): omg I love the 1975!

**Vike\_Me** (9): Enjoy all of it, but the bass line keeps things golden.

**Zi99yStardust** (9): Joy Division with one of thier best, an absolutely infectious bassline and instantly recognisable vocal delivery

**jajarepelotud0** (8.5): This reminds me a lot of "Nos Siguen Pegando Abajo" by Charly Garc√≠a, which is obviously a good thing

**Stryxen** (8.5): i took a few points of cos a tinder match told me to listen to this and then ghosted me (like a week ago)

**gileswithachainsaw** (8.3): I don't care for Joy Division overall, but I understand why this is one of their more popular songs.

**jman457** (8.2): tragic that Ian curtis died so young, even though he would probably go the way of morrisey

**AHSWeeknd** (8): My instinct was to give this a ten because it‚Äôs Vintage‚ú® but the lack of lyrics...

**ashandimlotion** (8): I found a grey hair in one of my zoots üòîüòµ like context in a modern debate I just took it out ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÄ

**BBthebest22** (8): I legit thought this was from the 2000s listening to it lol

**CrimsonROSET** (8): In the popheads spirit, I liked all the parts in which the guy wasn‚Äôt singing.

**kappyko** (8): RIP TO IAN CURTIS HE WOULD HAVE LOVED BREE RUNWAY

**pros-and-connors** (8): I had no idea Give Yourself a Try by the 1975 was a sample

**SmileAndTears** (8): Cute I guess

**vayyiqra** (8): Oh it's the t-shirt meme album which I've never heard in full before. This is good.

**waluigiest** (8): oh this album

**wryn\_** (8): still havent forgiven this for being the inspiration for that terrible 1975 song

**officialged** (7.9): Ugh, such juicy bass. Reminded me of The Drums (Let's Go Surfing). Loved the mood this song sets. Not that big of a fan of the voice, but it could grow on me.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I don't like this only because I'm more used to hearing this riff in Give Yourself a Try üíÄ

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**azurepatrocleia** (7.5): they have better tracks

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i like the instrumental but its not as lyrically memorable as some of these others songs

**fadedblue09** (7.5): It's fun but it didn't really go off until the last few seconds.

**ReallyCreative** (7.1): so I guess for 1979 this was pretty revolutionary but while it's a nice sound it's pretty boring, 2012 me would have ate it up though

**Arybeck67** (7): would‚Äôve been an 8 but I feel including this song is kinda cheating

**booksandplantsand** (7): new song (to me) from an old icon!

**jasannn** (7): I wish it got weirder.

**pat-rickstar** (7): I'm bopping but also it's kind of forgettable

**proscett** (7): omg blatant 1975 ripoff >:(

**steamedasparagus** (7): nice 1975 cover!!!

**whizzer0** (7): idk

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): kind of boring but not bad

**hepmeucsb** (6): It‚Äôs alright, but nothing in particular caught my attention.

**hikkaru** (6): I like the 1975 - give yourself a try more and saying this will get me banned from indieheads probably despite having never posted there

**NotWith10000Men** (6): the guitar is really nice, the rest of the song is just boring

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): These songs all sound the same, I hate it here

**pig-serpent** (6): Fine riff, but a bit repetative, not really that moody, and Ian Curtis is whatever.

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): Meh, I feel like songs like these are proof that men get praised for mediocrity lmao

**engifear** (5): I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to like Joy Division, but I can never get into Ian Curtis‚Äô vocals. I recognize that Joy Division has been super influential on the entire genre of alternative rock, but I‚Äôve just never enjoyed it.

**nice-cat** (5): I listened to it like 5 times in a row, because I kept getting distracted and forgetting that it was on. I can‚Äôt remember what it sounds like at all.

**runaway3212** (5): mess

**timothy444** (5): Meh

**insertusernameheree** (4): I'm sorry but I do not like the singer of Joy Division's voice :(

**notdallin** (4): I literally can‚Äôt imagine this being anybody‚Äôs favorite anything

**rslashpoopheads** (4): dis-no-rder

**skargardin** (4): not too fond of this

**Sypher32** (4): no strong feelings

**Uberpigeon** (4): is this a classic or something am i blaspheming by rating it low

**zagreux** (2): this would've been a 10 had the lead singer had any emotion in his voice

One of the songs that I personally wasn't familiar with is How Simple by Hop Along but man oh man I am happy I discovered them. We LOVE nonbinary representation in our music! A fairly simple (haha) song that bops along at a modest pace was bouncing in between day one and day two for the duration of the rate, eventually landing at the begining of day one. "We will both find out just not together" is a lyric that really resonated with me and clearly did with a lot of other people to. Congrats on your day two placement Hop Along, you've earned it.

---

**engifear** (11): It was really hard to pick an 11 this rate, but ultimately it had to go to this song. Frances Quinlan‚Äôs vocals are absolutely iconic and the lyrics ‚ÄúWe will both find out, just not together‚Äù absolutely shook me to my core the first time I heard it. It‚Äôs so ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and perfect.

**AGM301** (10): love it x4 love this part of the playlist

**bespectacIed** (10): "i suppose one who hasn't seen the earlier phase could say i am advancing up this road I am advancing" --- words that hurt my soul. Frances voice is just so stunning. BYHO,D amazing album

**fadedblue09** (10): Ooh I liked this one too. Love the laid back rock vibe.

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): God I love her voice. I‚Äôm always in awe of people who can do that kind of yelp/rasp/whistle/voice break thing. And that groove, the backing vocals and flourishes, the lyrics, the way everything layers together in the end and then drops right out, that‚Äôs some good stuff.

**frogaranaman** (10): I'M FUCKING SOBBING BUT CAN‚ÄôT NOT DANCE TO THIS, HELP.

**jajarepelotud0** (10): Loved everything about this song, especially her voice

**jasannn** (10): WE WILL BOTH FIND OUT BUT NOT TOGETHER!!

**nice-cat** (10): she did that!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): monarch behavior!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I really love this song, this was a really fun discovery

**Stryxen** (10): well how simple?

**Vike\_Me** (10): Fuck yeah, fell in love with this one in like ten seconds, doesn't fall off for a second.

**celladonn** (9.5): stan Hop Along tbh

**Kardif** (9.5): this is good, nice blend of vocals and other instruments

**akanewasright** (9): I really like this one

**hunnybee12** (9): my favorite discovery in the rate i think

**runaway3212** (9): Weirdly really good

**sarcasticsobs** (9): if any of you diss frances, i s2g

**SmileAndTears** (9): The video is me dancing alone in my room to Want You In My Room

**targetguest** (9): a bop!

**whizzer0** (9): it's nice

**zagreux** (9): The lead singer sounds like Hayley Williams, and I'm a simple person - I hear/see Hayley Williams, I give it a high score.

**camerinian** (8.5): This is actually really fucking fun. I bet these guys go off live

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this reminds me of a song that would play in a disney channel original movie from years ago (not an insult!)

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): I actually like a song on this list!

**Arybeck67** (8.4): getting the automatic +1 since this isn‚Äôt a male. It‚Äôs a bop as hell, though I do wish it had a little more sonic flavor.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): this was fun

**babygrillx** (8): bop, i like the rasp in her voice

**bbfan132** (8): this reminds me of some of the indie rock i‚Äôve enjoyed over the years - i like it quite a bit, but it doesn‚Äôt totally interest me to the point where i would want to listen to it a lot

**BBthebest22** (8): Great discovery!

**bulforster** (8): Best groove of the rate.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): something something how simple it is to make a good song

**musical\_pyn** (8): I must simple-y give this an 8

**proscett** (8): frances quinlan is one of the best songwriters in the game rn and that is that

**Sypher32** (8): This sounds nice!

**txrxwxwx** (7.8): idk why but this reminds me of The Chicks is that blasphemous

**notdallin** (7.7): it starts off really strong but ends‚Ä¶ simple? I love the lyrics, but i wish it bloomed a little more as it went

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this feels aimed towards millennials having picnics

**azurepatrocleia** (7.5): immaculate vocals

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.1): Pretty good, not much to say about it.

**ColdSore2020** (7): This is the only song here that I needed to relisten to, and it is quite enjoyable! It is not the unique or innovative imo but it has definitely been added to my library

**hepmeucsb** (7): It‚Äôs pretty good, but didn‚Äôt make a huge impact.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/729/927/617.gif

**trashypanini** (7): has a sunny upbeat feeling that I like. Has some late 00s/10s average/generic indie-popisms (vocally and production wise) that are nostalgic and make for light easy listening. Nothing too unique but familiar.

**vayyiqra** (7): Cute

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Pleasent Indie rock. Fine‚Ñ¢.

**steamedasparagus** (6.5): I kind of can‚Äôt get past Frances‚Äô voice

**Zi99yStardust** (6.5): A cute indie rock number, nothing particuarly special but just a well done track

**AHSWeeknd** (6): interesting.

**booksandplantsand** (6): i wanna say it's basic indie girl but I do like it

**cremeebrulee** (6): i like her voice but this song does nothing for me

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I kept getting distracted when this came on, maybe it's just not engaging enough.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I was iffy at first but this is fine. Wish their voice was a little higher in the mix, it's kinda drowned out

**rslashpoopheads** (6): what a simple score

**jman457** (5.9): sorry if this feels sexist I just think its ok

**Flegasaurus** (5.5): this is kind of actively boring to me don't hurt me please üò≠

**timothy444** (5.5): Average

**wryn\_** (5.5): kind of meanders along without a purpose

**officialged** (4.1): Umm, it' s not bad, but idk, a little too unspecific, scattered, random even? Couldn't get into it.

**wavingwolves** (4): alright

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): How simple is this song? Very simple, and not in a good way.

**ashandimlotion** (2.5): bore ring

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): this was great. the lyrics really resonated with me. because this is how i have been feeling pretty much my entire life. people around you tell you how great and talented and gifted you are and then you go out into the world and the world tells you the opposite and you don‚Äôt know what to believe in anymore. you grow up looking up to adults and then by the time you‚Äôre one yourself, the curtain has been lifted and you realize that most people have no idea what the fuck they are doing and are making it up as they go.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (11): I'm surprised it's my 11 but its undeniable

**2dina3dworld** (10): ‚ÄúIf I had an orchard, I‚Äôd work until I‚Äôm raw‚Äù SAME. Someone gets the allure of nature

**AGM301** (10): love it x3

**bbfan132** (10): i love mumford & sons

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I will retire to the Salton Sea at the age of 23, for I'm starting to learn I may never be free. But though I may never be free, FUCK YOU AND YOUR MONEY! I'm tired of your money...

**endcreditouilles** (10): this hits me in my soul

**fadedblue09** (10): Breathtaking scenery music

**frogaranaman** (10): Y'all, this fucking RIPPED live.

**ggal2020** (10): Please stop making me listen to this before I leave my family and move to the PNW to open a vegan bakery.

**gwenflip** (10): This probably would be my 11 if not for Snail Mail

**hepmeucsb** (10): Fleet Foxes really is the best of modern folk.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.pinimg.com/originals/14/3f/7c/143f7c5b0d280d1d60179d702737e499.jpg

**izeasklapaucius** (10): my b---- pulsate with the beat as the bass drum starts to creep in

**jasannn** (10): This song makes me smile and cry at the same time. This was so close to being my 11.

**notdallin** (10): the real magic of the song appears at the end, just as robin pecknold accepts the helplessness of his life; the tempo slows, the guitars waltz, and suddenly pecknold is surrounded by a pastoral quartet singing of a simpler life characterized by hard work, picking the apples of orchards and waiting tables with hopeful ambitions. That crushing truth really *is* a helpless realization because in a world of individual snowflakes, you still remain just a part of the blizzard, indistinct from all of the others. It‚Äôs the millennial plea for a gen x viewpoint (over the most beautiful 2 seconds of careening strings you‚Äôll ever hear at 4:11) where being *the one* because you were born is no longer as appealing as becoming *the one* because of how you lived.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I was beginning to worry y'all didn't know what a good male voice sounded like but I feel my legs spreading to those harmonizations girls!

**Rhea\_33** (10): I really think this is such a beautiful song.

**rickikardashian** (10): i was so scared the guitar would get loud and distorted in the outro

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I love indie folk

**TiltControls** (10): This could have been almost anything on the album and still have gotten a 10 (though Montezuma would be an 11)

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the harmonies are excellent

**bulforster** (9.8): Oof, right in the unemployment.

**just\_thonking** (9.5): The perfect soundtrack to any good existential crisis

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): yas we love cottagecore

**txrxwxwx** (9.5): now this is a long song that I am completely on board with

**Zi99yStardust** (9.5): A masterclass in how to structure a song, it gracefully glides between it's individual 'acts' that each map lyrics with relevant arrangment: from pondering, to relevation to finally acceptance on the 'meaning' of life

**jman457** (9.2): gives me the same feeling that Sufjan gets but more of a happy/nostalgic

**azurepatrocleia** (9): this made me want to live in a forest

**bigbigbee** (9): I bet a bunch of people are going to mention Mumford and Sons, but for all their numerous faults, I‚Äôve always liked this folky guitar sound. After hearing all of Shore, I have to say I prefer this Fleet Foxes sound (and I like White Winter Hymnal even more). They‚Äôre really good at pretty vocal harmonies.

**engifear** (9): I used to listen to this album and their debut while playing Borderlands 2

**Gonza\_90** (9): If this is a good representation of this band, then I slept on them hardcore.

**skargardin** (9): bop

**Turpamutteri** (9): I guess I should check out more of their stuff

**waluigiest** (9): I had a brief but bright Fleet Foxes phase

**Arybeck67** (8.5): I‚Äôm a sucker for folk music, what can I say? Though this oddly sounds a lot like a Crosby, Stills, and Nash song and I‚Äôm not exactly sure why.

**seanderlust** (8.5): wait...why did he want to be the man on the screen in the end? isn't the whole point of...you know what I don't care it's a bop.

**booksandplantsand** (8): who can resist fleet foxes?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if sea shanties had guitars

**jajarepelotud0** (8): White boy(s) with acoustic guitar done well

**LostintheCosmicFire** (8): ,7

**musical\_pyn** (8): I like other stuff from fleet foxes better but well,, it‚Äôs still fleet foxes

**sandyfishnets** (8): love the lyrics.

**steamedasparagus** (8): high school me made some points listening to this

**trashypanini** (8): y‚Äôall should‚Äôve put Montezuma or The Plains smh. Still bangs. Builds then releases.

**Uberpigeon** (8): Never listened to fleet foxes before but this was a great one to start!

**whizzer0** (8): I'm torn between "this is nice" and "this is another boring guitar man song"

**zagreux** (8): I love the lead singer's voice

**plastichaxan** (7.8): where was this level on shore

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): they said fuck individualism and they were right!

**EnCaine** (7.5): not my favorite fleet foxes song but it's still good

**Kardif** (7.5): the album's good, but I don't think this is the strongest track

**moonagenightmares** (7.3): this is like... good I guess

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.2): More music for hip dads from a band I'm admittedly biased against, but it's more fun than the Arcade Fire song.

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): They really waited till the bridge to bring in something other than an acoustic guitar.

**babygrillx** (7): cute

**jayjaysortagay** (7): I like guitarseseses

**runaway3212** (7): Little Lion Man outsold

**timothy444** (7): Sounds like a Mumford & Sons song but ever so slightly better

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): Yet another song where I like the instrumental but not the vocals

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): also a mood

**wryn\_** (6.5): fleet foxes have so many obviously way better songs than this wtf

**insertusernameheree** (6.2): forgetable

**officialged** (6.2): It's ok. I enjoy moments of the song, but it doesn't speak to me like I'd wish it would.

**Vike\_Me** (6.2): This really could have been cut down to 3:05.

**Flegasaurus** (6): it just didn't click with me really but it was pleasant

**nice-cat** (6): I love Fleet Foxes but I‚Äôve never liked this one that much‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a little Mumfod & Sons-y for me.

**SmileAndTears** (6): This bores me so much

**vayyiqra** (6): The strumming at the beginning set off my fight-or-flight response but the ending was nice.

**BBthebest22** (5): I like some Fleet Foxes songs but most have bored me tbh

**NotWith10000Men** (5): mumford and sons ass song. Sorry

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): It‚Äôs certainly a song

**pig-serpent** (5): This could have rousing vocals and be a fairly exciting country song but the vocals are too perishing indie and a little too slow and it makes the song way too dreary.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): I don't care if pitchfork love them, fundamentally this is still white guy with acoustic guitar music. Maybe I just don't "get" Fleet Foxes, but I've found quite a lot of their music to be too similar, boring and quite annoying to be completely honest.

**ashandimlotion** (4): advert music

**fkadizzy-1804** (4): As an ex-‚Äúgifted kid‚Äù turned burned-out millennial paper-pusher I get and to a certain extent appreciate what this song is trying to do, but the lyrics fall kind of flat and the music is plodding.

**proscett** (4): i wish i liked FF more than i do :( this is mad boring. white winter hymnal a bop tho

**Sypher32** (4): I could tolerate listening to this I guess, but it's loong

**wavingwolves** (3): too fantanocore for me i think

**bespectacIed** (2): Boring. Never been a fan of robin pecknold wailing. But I do love Shore. Sunblind is amazing. Idk what to say lol i know this score is blasphemous

ObersteinAlwaysRight: I'm actually peeved it wasn't Mykonos. Not that I have any room to complain, but that one is the perfect intersection of Fleet Foxes' style while still being appealing to pop sensibilities. 

Then again, I'm also eternally annoyed that Helplessness Blues gets all the attention from that album when (imo) The Shrine / An Argument is far superior, so maybe I'm biased.

feverfin: I mean, it is the title track, and the one that's the most explicit about its meaning, so it makes sense. Also, I don't think everyone appreciates the last two minutes of The Shrine / An Argument lmao (I definitely did not the first time I heard it, although it's one of my favorite parts of the album now). 

Mykonos 100% would have done better though, or Montezuma

WaneLietoc: The sub likes them.

I bought their discography on cassette and while I find them to be a genuinely sincere band, I also could take the Sun Giant EP and leave everything else. Their last two albums have been way more up my alley due to their "states of mind" so to speak.

One of the biggest surprises on my end was how good Jesus Etc. did. I honestly expected this to go out WAY earlier, maybe even bottom 10 but it managed to get into day two without ever really dropping into day one. Maybe it was that violin which triggered popheads disco reflex that got into their good graces. Either way, it's

---

**azurepatrocleia** (11): words cannot describe how much this song moves me

**ExtraEater** (11): Two perfect lyrics. #1: "You were right about the stars. Each one is a setting sun." And #2: "Our love is all of God's money. Everyone is a burning sun."

**bespectacIed** (10): Literally one of the greatest songs of all time p.s. LAND HO RULES

**ColdSore2020** (10): The gays are going to kill me, but with this track, I think Wilco did the country-disco hybrid in a much more nuanced and interesting way than our local fan favorite Kacey did "High Horse". This song sounds equally at home on a long drive as it does in alcohol-assisted basement dance party and is the crown jewel of Wilco's discography.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I'm a sucker for folksy bluesy strings, inject this into my veins.

**fadedblue09** (10): Any song that Norah Jones covered is an instant 10. Also, the lovely instrumentals <3

**frogaranaman** (10): Me when I'm asked who was at the Last Supper but don't remember any of the Apostles' names:

**insertusernameheree** (10): I wish I had two 11s because I love this song with my whole heart -- and this album tbh!!

**moonagenightmares** (10): yas bob dylan vibes. On a serious note: this was one of the best discoveries of the rate I think it changed my brain‚Äôs chemistry

**mudkip1** (10): how pleasant

**nice-cat** (10): ‚Äúyou were right about the stars/each one is a setting sun‚Äù - that doesn‚Äôt sound right, but I don‚Äôt know enough about stars to dispute it

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (10): Jesus, I cry. No, but seriously, Jeff Tweedy has a voice for the ages. And this is so beautiful. The violins section and him singing "our love is all of God's money" hits me in the FEELS, man.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): if only the other songs about jesus are this good

**Vromega** (10): the violins in the intro are outstanding, and the rest of the song is overall really lovely.

**fkadizzy-1804** (9.7): This is probably the song I relistened to most while putting together my scores, because I was trying to articulate exactly what it is that keeps it from being a perfect 10 for me. All I‚Äôve concluded is that it‚Äôs something about the vocals - either just the guy‚Äôs voice, or the delivery, or where his voice sits in the mix, or wanting a bit more variety in the dynamics or the melodies, or something, I‚Äôm still not exactly sure.

**ggal2020** (9.5): Maybe I‚Äôll finally listen to this album. Maybe RYM will win.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): their bob dylan serve here

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I don't know what you call these synths but I'm a useless bottom for them, and with strings over top? a reasonable male singing voice? A snappening

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): really cute

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.5): the intro reminds me of its too late by carole king

**timothy444** (9.5): Almost a perfect song that was ruined by the lack of a NF rap verse.

**Zi99yStardust** (9.5): Classic Wilco, beautifully arranged and heartbreakingly sad

**Vike\_Me** (9.1): Yo those violins kick things off perfectly, fuck. The whole thing is smooth as hell and the singer's voice is perfect for this one.

**1998tweety** (9): this is nice

**bbfan132** (9): nice song to chill out to

**hunnybee12** (9): i have a feeling the folk songs won't do well, but i enjoy them

**jajarepelotud0** (9): If a song has violin in it, I automatically assume it's great

**rickikardashian** (9): i didnt expect ‚Äúis this song about jesus or is it gay‚Äù to be a theme i‚Äôd find in another artist

**shivof** (9): .7

**txrxwxwx** (9): super cool instrumentation, distinctive vocals

**waluigiest** (9): I was part of a 2 week Ableton workshop with a the pianist from Wilco in 2016

**whizzer0** (9): yeah I like this

**ImADudeDuh** (8.9): 8 etc.

**notdallin** (8.7): my go-to karaoke song B)

**JunkyGS** (8.5): pleasant sounding

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): this feels like coffee shop music and that's definitely not necessarily a bad thing..

**Arybeck67** (8.4): I really vibe with the twang on this track.

**Stryxen** (8.4): elevator music for bitches with religious trauma

**AHSWeeknd** (8): this is mainly what I expected to hear from this rate, and I like it

**babygrillx** (8): very pleasant

**hepmeucsb** (8): I did really like this song, it felt comforting and melancholic. Also strings! Yay for strings!

**musical\_pyn** (8): there‚Äôs something very smooth about this song that makes it stand out from the rest of this rate

**proscett** (8): i actually really like this, wasn't expecting such a gentle song

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.9): Seems like a slightly boring choice from Wilco but it's good.

**Kardif** (7.8): strong start but just faded away

**shhhneak** (7.7): Toy Story 5 theme song tease.

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): this is boring but like comfort boring, it feels safe

**targetguest** (7.5): smooth

**NotWith10000Men** (7): nice chill vibe. I like the strings

**seanderlust** (7): "Jesus Etc." - me explaining what happens in the bible

**steamedasparagus** (7): it‚Äôs ok

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): fine but forgettable

**slimboyfriend** (6.7): I can imagine legions of bearded ex-hipster millennial dads bopping their beanied heads to this in unison

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): it was sweet, if more of a background song than an active listening song

**ashandimlotion** (6.5): I love wilko and their pick n mix selection

**jasannn** (6.5): Props to the violin for elevating this.

**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): It can stay ig

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): etc.

**trashypanini** (6.5): nasally vocal but it adds some character to the song which I kind of like. Wish there was more dynamic and build towards something more though.

**jman457** (6.3): this is a band where the pitchfork crowd loves and I for the life of me cant get into.

**booksandplantsand** (6): the writing is good but this is borderline a parody of indie folk music. indieheads I am tired

**chilipeepers** (6): It's fine but I don't vibe with Wilco.

**esskeetitli** (6): This was decent. Not great, but just decent.

**Sypher32** (6): ok

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh this must be Soofyan again it's about Jesus

**wryn\_** (6): not that bad but it doesnt really go anywhere

**zagreux** (6): lo-fi beats to relax/study to

**camerinian** (5.5): Gotta be honest, I don‚Äôt think the indieheads really did these supposed all-time classic albums justice by picking out random tracks for a bunch of largely newbies to rate. I‚Äôm sure this album is really good if you dig deep into it, but on its own, this track is kind of everything I worried this rate might be - sedate, poetic, definitely nice but also not very impactful. Soz

**Flegasaurus** (5.5): this is a bit nothing

**pheromenos** (5.5): not 5 minutes long but it's the most boring among the rest

**runaway3212** (5): yawn

**wavingwolves** (5): i'm not christian

**officialged** (4.6): Mostly boring. But I enjoyed the muted guitar.

**pig-serpent** (4): In the category of songs I'm not sure are bad but certainly bore me.

The only song over six minutes long to make day 2! Car Seat Headrest has more than it's fair share of hardcore fans and thy were able to pick up enough steam and then some to secure a spot on day 2. I got into Car Seat Headrest right before COVID hit and while this isn't my favorite song of theirs, this is more than a worthy placement for Will Toledo and co.

---

**bespectacIed** (11): [Please read my Bodys writeup on Daily Discussion a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/m47wqx/daily_discussion_march_13_2021/gquopy7?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=). This song is fundamental to me being gay. It's all that cute awkward closeted white boy Will Toledo's fault, fuck him literally and figuratively

**bulforster** (11): Wow I miss hugs, oh to be one of those furries on the cover.

**camerinian** (11): Car Seat Headrest are an extremely important band for me. Teens of Denial and Twin Fantasy are two of my favourite ever albums. I've seen them live three times. They basically funnelled me into the punk/indie/emo miasma entirely by themselves. There's a rawness and vulnerability in Will Toledo's writing that is just magical when placed next to these powerful life-affirming anthems, and that makes the moments when his albums crash into self-loathing and depression even more devastating. Bodys comes in during Twin Fantasy as the peak of a run of upbeat euphoric love songs almost devotional in nature, and it's just stunning in how the song builds to that. It takes a lot of nerve to audibly declare that you're delaying the chorus so that it'll be more rewarding, but jesus christ as soon as you think it's paid off, the song just stacks hook upon hook on top of each other in something that's euphoric in its feeling of collective joy. It's a song about celebrating the people around you in all their features and flaws, and also how attractive they are. Chaotic horniness aside, it's the sort of open sincere emotionality that the best indie rock is still more suited to selling than any other genre. I adore this song and this band so, so, so much.

**ggal2020** (11): There are four major musical revolutions in my life. One of the Boys by Katy Perry, No 1 Angel by Charli XCX, Backstreets by Bruce Springsteen, and Twin Fantasy by Car Seat Headrest. This album flipped my idea of indie rock (and music) on its head. Also, fun fact, I came out to my friends on Skype Zoom when I was a little drunk last fall.

**hepmeucsb** (11): WELL SO WHAT? WE‚ÄôRE YOUNG! This song just continually hits higher highs throughout its 6 minutes. CSH is so goddamn genius.

**hunnybee12** (11): i loved this song years ago and listening to it again now i remember why, it's perfect

**jajarepelotud0** (11): This song is definetly going into my "coming-of-age movie soundtrack" playlist

**kappyko** (11): hating this song is homophobic

**steamedasparagus** (11): I love you wiww towedo fwom caw seat headwest

**useless-sheep** (11): go crusty white men go

**Zi99yStardust** (11): A bombastic, relatable explosion of a song that never fails to reminds me of being (and to continue to be) young & carefree - a stellar home run of a song, total magic!

**2dina3dworld** (10): Those six minutes spent listening to this song felt more like three

**bbfan132** (10): excellent, i need to check this album out

**booksandplantsand** (10): okay faith in the rate restored! take my coins CSH

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): A strong contender for my 11.

**Flegasaurus** (10): the original twin fantasy is much much better than the 2018 remastered version

**frogaranaman** (10): This is one of my favorite songs of all time and would be my 11 if not for one of my other favorite songs of all time being in this rate. Our bodies WILL fall apart at any second, Will, and yes, I am terrified, Will. 

 Also, "Face to Face" version > "Mirror to Mirror" version, but only slightly.

**Gonza\_90** (10): Nice shoulders!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I‚Äôm bopping but also feel like it‚Äôs making fun of me for bopping. Oh nevermind its like a nerd party song like weezer

**JunkyGS** (10): OMG FINALLY SOMETHING UPTEMPO. BOP!

**slimboyfriend** (10): CSH said this one is for the gays with anxiety...... and also maybe the furries but we don't talk about that

**zagreux** (10): I've always wanted to check ot CSH's discography because I've heard a LOT about how their music is relatable to angsty gay teens. I never prioritized it, but gosh. This song is so relatable. Thank you, Will.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): This would be a 10 if it wasn't for "imonaneedano basis"

**akanewasright** (9.5): Yeah this is adorable

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Kind of a banger. Like a lot of stuff in this rate it's still not really my thing but I feel like it could be my thing if I was more into indie music

**pheromenos** (9.5): omg bop?! >5 minutes song won today

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): gay

**gwenflip** (9.2): I wanna listen to this with my window down and I have on dope sunglasses and there‚Äôs some wind going thru my hair and I have on like a striped t-shirt and indie movie vibes

**jman457** (9.2): Car Seat headrest knows what they are and they do it so well. I just hate that a lot of MAGA people I went to high school with also like them.

**TheEvilNightman** (9.2): The intro is an eleven, but the rest of the song is a nine. Also, fuck it, I want someone to make a mashup of this and Drowning Pool's "Bodies".

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): if I liked his voice a little more, it'd be a 10, there's some great lyrical stuff here and I love how the song builds and moves and meanders. But the voice is just a little off for me.

**EnCaine** (9): Wolf Like Me is the best furry song in this rate and this is the best song made by a

**hikkaru** (9): bodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodys

**insertusernameheree** (9): lead singer sounds A LOT like Julian Casablancas to me (in fact the whole song sounds like it could be on a Strokes album)

**nootnoot781** (9): i checked out both versions and i prefer the 2018 version (oops) but both are so good. this is my first time listening but i feel so nostalgic listening to it.

**notdallin** (9): why is everyone cheesed about having to listen to car seat headrest? this song is actually amazingly hook on top of hook on top of hook with quirky and relatable lyrics that straddle the line between clever and cringey like a coming of age movie that constantly talks through the fourth wall

**NotWith10000Men** (9): The guitar melody is really catchy

**seanderlust** (9): i'm such a sucker for car seat headrest. though I do kind of wish we were rating fill in the blank or drugs are better with friends or killer whales

**veryanniev** (9): This song has the funniest lyrics and I love it

**Vromega** (9): this album cover is fantastic. Also the high score I'm giving to this song is probably related to the fact that it comes just after the two monstruosities that were bmbmbm and sunglasses

**wavingwolves** (9): this rate is making me notice i'm just a big fan of incel music

**whizzer0** (9): heard this before, still good

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): no one tells me shit!!!

**Arybeck67** (8.7): the production is awesome and the build up has an excellent payoff. The lyrical content is also very interesting, so ya, a solid song.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): I really like this one

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this whole thing felt like a long stream of consciousness that i somehow related to

**wryn\_** (8.5): even the songs that indie heads party to are like 7 minutes long omg. still a banger

**babygrillx** (8): banger

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly i was done with this at the 4 minute mark but its still good

**endcreditouilles** (8): loved this until he started explaining the chorus, that's a bit cringy for me.

**engifear** (8): This song reminds me of my ex, but it‚Äôs good.

**Stryxen** (8): can it please be the chorus already

**Uberpigeon** (8): the other good song from this album. Its a banger

**vayyiqra** (8): These lyrics hit different in the midst of this pan-Arabism we are in right now. This song did not feel long at all to me.

**waluigiest** (8): this honestly got better and more interesting as it went on

**azurepatrocleia** (7.5): really digged the energy on that one

**trashypanini** (7.5): I was never too ‚Äúinto‚Äù this album like so many others. But a perfect snapshot of adolescence. The thrumming beat/lo-if quality is so good too. Works perfectly.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.5): ; this is strokes esque. This might be blasphemous to r/indieheads

steelstepladder: **1998tweety** (7): shes alright

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The instrumentals and the lyrics are brilliant, but oh my god, not another shitty male voice, I'm honestly getting so tired of them...

**Flipping\_Whales** (7): nice shoulders bro

**Iris3271** (7): I wish it was a little shorter

**nice-cat** (7): the vibe here is like he‚Äôs doing drunken karaoke to his own song, which I do kind of love.

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): Another song that makes me feel weirdly nostalgic

**pig-serpent** (7): (FTF I'm assuming) I'm rather conflicted towards this one. I like the riff, the melodies, and the way the chorus sounds, but I'm not into the singing or the weird drumming effects, and there are a few fills that sound weird to me.

**plastichaxan** (7): this can't keep up the 6 minutes but it's good

**rslashpoopheads** (7): cute

**skargardin** (7): this is pleasant

**txrxwxwx** (7): y'all really love songs that go on for eons (or maybe my attention span is simply FRIED)

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): :well:

**fadedblue09** (6): Sounds fun but annoying at the same time. Don't like the lyrics very much.

**Sypher32** (6): groovy

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): It's okay, just goes on a bit too long which made me lose interest.

**runaway3212** (5.8): picks up towards the end

**Kardif** (5.5): this is okay. Feels generic though, and strange mixing

**officialged** (5.5): Really like the percussion (?) sound effect in the intro. But the chorus seems too generic for me (sonically), not a fan of the wall-of-sound-y guitars. I hope I'll be a skinny legend before my body falls apart.

**targetguest** (5.5): just really bored me

**gileswithachainsaw** (5): Gives me TV commercial vibes at times, but it's not that bad. I might like it more if I weren't listening to several similar anthemic indie rock songs in the same session for this rate, lol.

**timothy444** (5): I can't tell which is more annoying: the grammar on the song title or the voice of the lead vocalist

**AHSWeeknd** (4): It‚Äôs interesting but like... what?

**musical\_pyn** (4): the song is ‚Ä¶fine but it does not need to be 6+ minutes

**ashandimlotion** (3.5): Six Minutes Fourty Seven!! I could be listening to Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary in that time!

**sarcasticsobs** (3): don‚Äôt get em, never will, don‚Äôt wanna! there‚Äôs like 4 parts to this and i can stand one

**proscett** (2): this makes me indiephobic

**chilipeepers** (1): , I don't like Car Seat Headrest. Sorry, Will Toledo but we just don't vibe.

**mudkip1** (1): car seat headrest is one of the few artists i've had to block on streaming since they love to get shoehorned in as a recommended artist every time. his voice is so grating

**morgchrist** (0): ???? sorry never understood his appeal

Similar to how Taylor cast a shadow over the Nationals performance in this rate, Phoebe Bridgers openly being influenced by Elliot Smith played a lot in popheads familiarity with him beforehand. Lucky for Elliot Phoebe is a lot less of a divisive figure on here leading to a day two placement. It also helps the song is really damn good.

---

**ColdSore2020** (11): This is truly one of my favorite songs of the 90's and of all time. Although I've never been in a relationship myself, the song's subject matter about the descent from loving someone to wanting to control them is something that I have always been afraid of. Elliott is often typecast as this sad and depressed guy, but in my opinion his lyrics are a lot more relatable and universal than the simple compositions and his iconic voice make them out to be.

**leira\_s** (11): pure poetry, good enough for phoebe bridgers good enough for me

**NotWith10000Men** (11): you know that nice floaty feeling you get when someone is playing with your hair? That's how this song makes me feel. This is lovely.

**whizzer0** (11): Marika Hackman did this too, I love this song. I'm kind of interested that one of his most popular songs is so simple (albeit with so much depth in the lyrics). I'm always down for more minimalism.

**1998tweety** (10): i love Elliott with 2 Ts

**AGM301** (10): love it x2

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I‚Äôm surprised I liked this, it‚Äôs great.

**Arybeck67** (10): theres not a lot I can say about this song that others haven‚Äôt said in a far better way then I ever could. Thus, I‚Äôll just say this song and artist has inspired most of my favorite artists (Adrianne, Phoebe) and it deserves respect.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i mean i guess

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This hits different when you come from a family with a long history of substance abuse (a shocker for a Russian, I know), so I'm glad I've been sober all my life and choose to remain so.

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): Another song that was so incredibly close to getting my 11. I listened to these songs all out of order the first time through, and with this one within the first 10 seconds I was like ‚Äúthis is gonna be my 11‚Äù even though I‚Äôd never heard it before, or any other Elliott Smith song - apart from Frank Ocean‚Äôs interpolation of A Fond Farewell in Seigfried, which also happened to hit me like a truck. So that‚Äôs maybe a sign I should check out the rest of his discography. (Ultimately it got edged out of the 11 spot, but just barely)

**frogaranaman** (10): ELLIOTT SMITH WAS MURDERED, HE DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE. END OF DISCUSSION.

**ggal2020** (10): I Stockholm Syndromed myself into liking Elliott Smith by listening to this album on repeat because Phoebe Bridgers likes it so much and I am gay in love with her.

**gileswithachainsaw** (10): Elliott Smith with incredible songwriting as usual. Excellent lyricism and beautiful melody.

**Gonza\_90** (10): Noo! God, oh god. What is life? How can someone so talented die so young?

**gwenflip** (10): I remember this song was in that one romance movie with Nat Wolff and it was like Logan Lerman‚Äôs characters favorite song and then he made out with Lily Collins while listening to this or maybe he cried or something idk

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/cCwyZaW.gif

**insertusernameheree** (10): Elliot smith reminds me of worse times lol

**jajarepelotud0** (10): The title is so clever, I love it

**musical\_pyn** (10): wow this is really really good and only being 2:20 it‚Äôs going to be popheads‚Äô favorite track by default

**nice-cat** (10): What if I told you I feel like I know you, but we never met?

**proscett** (10): phoebe bridgers origin story

**runaway3212** (10): I like this one cause it is short which is nice

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i love the way he kinda whisper the whole song

**ThaCoolness** (10): I have not heard this song before this rate, but it is absolutely beautiful and haunting. Masterpiece

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): https://youtu.be/lHgYrB2VO64?t=39

**timothy444** (10): Great

**wavingwolves** (10): hope y'all are nice to this song because it's at least the same length as a hyperpop one

**Iris3271** (9.5): Very cute, made me sad

**jasannn** (9.5): I recognized his name from Fantano's Punisher review and I knew I had to give this song more chances. It grew on me like the rest of Punisher.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This is a lot better than anything I heard on either/or, I'm confused

**moonagenightmares** (9.3): is this that heterosexual sufjan people keep talking about

**jman457** (9.1): Sad bttm hours

**azurepatrocleia** (9): this made me want to take my heart out and stab it but in a good way

**babygrillx** (9): beautiful

**fadedblue09** (9): Sounds like it will play in the heart-wrenching scene of a dramatic film, and that's not a bad thing.

**Flipping\_Whales** (9): my dumb ass really thought this was about breastfeeding for a hot minute

**izeasklapaucius** (9): pharbz come get your juice

**jayjaysortagay** (9): feelsbadman.jpg

**kappyko** (9): indieheads was so silly when they sent us meme songs like this song that was used in rick and morty

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): elliott smith music only hits for me when i am Really Depressed which atm i am not but this is still good

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): wish it were longer

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): This is gonna get robbed, because how dare a man write a song with an acoustic guitar

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): so this is can‚Äôt feel my face but about alcohol instead

**akanewasright** (8.7): this is nice

**bbfan132** (8.5): very soft yet crushing

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Ah, Phoebe Bridgers‚Äô muse! I LOVE Punisher and I‚Äôll happily listen to anything that influenced that record. This song is a lot less sad-serene to me than that record and more actively, darkly sad, but it really grew on me. I love almost anything in 3/4 time.

**nt96** (8.5): rip Elliot

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): The epitome of depressing songs; beautifully arranged, if a bit short

**hepmeucsb** (8): While the song itself feels somewhat plain, the lyrics elevate it.

**hunnybee12** (8): so this is the man phoebe bridgers is obsessed with

**steamedasparagus** (8): copying Phoebe Bridgers :^(( shameless

**Vike\_Me** (7.9): Not usually a big WGWAG guy, but this hits a touch different.

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I really like this but it just comes and goes? It's cool but that's it??

**rickikardashian** (7.8): i can 100% see where he inspired phoebe

**Stryxen** (7.7): me when someone asks which part of the barcode scanner is read

**officialged** (7.5): Ugh, what a lovely acoustic ballad.

**pheromenos** (7.5): can totally see his influence on phoebe bridgers now wow

**seanderlust** (7.5): anthems for crying into a half-empty glass of brandy

**buddhacharm** (7): I'm üíò the queen üë∏ you üëâüèª want üòç to see üëÄ, Elliott with 2 üïù Ts üÖæ, OK üëå! Get üâê into it!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): nice but sleepy

**pig-serpent** (7): Chill but I'm into it.

**trashypanini** (7): the quiet vocal is perfect for the song. Even though I wasn‚Äôt too obsessed with it and thought my sound was on the fritz. Otherwise a nice folksy-acoustic dark vibe.

**txrxwxwx** (7): vaguely sufjan stevens-y

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): In true r/popheads style, I feel like I would like this a lot more if it was sung by a woman tbh

steelstepladder: 
**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): it‚Äôs okay I guess

**ashandimlotion** (6.5): a short song god bless

**engifear** (6.5): I like Elliott Smith, but I‚Äôve never really cared for this song. It alway felt pretty basic and boring to me. I‚Äôm more of a Baby Britain guy.

**notdallin** (6.2): ok there are some pretty lyrics here but if i‚Äôve said it once, i‚Äôve said it a jillion times I DON‚ÄôT GET THE ELLIOTT SMITH HYPE

**camerinian** (6): I know the story of Elliott Smith and how highly regarded he is and how tragic his life was, but I gotta be honest, I just don‚Äôt really click with guy with guitar music. I know, massive disservice, but that‚Äôs kinda the reality of it.

**skargardin** (6): this ended before i could grasp anything about it, pretty but i won't revisit

**wryn\_** (6): why are all the songs in this rate like 7 minutes long and this one feels about 3 minutes too short

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (6): ; Sorry Phoebe.

**zagreux** (6): nice but kinda short

**booksandplantsand** (5): low-key but nice!

**vayyiqra** (5): pensive emoji, but too short

**2dina3dworld** (4): boring, forgettable

**bespectacIed** (4): I feel like Say Yes is more iconic

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): I hate the whisper singing

**Sypher32** (4): no strong feelings

**rslashpoopheads** (3): literally left no impression whatsoever

**targetguest** (3): sleepy

The fact that we haven't rated pretty much any new wave artists on popheads feels off. New Order especially feel like they deserve a ton of love with how they were able to blend synth work and guitar work so effortlessly into one big package. A sound that felt like a natural evolution from Joy Division yet still retained a lot of its best qualities. Age of Consent especially slaps so hard and shows this perfectly. The synths are so lush and fluid while the guitar is still quite nervy creating one of the defining sounds of the period.

---

**sandyfishnets** (11): wish I was alive during the '80s. damn.

**2dina3dworld** (10): Power, Corruption and Lies is a brilliant album, just brilliant. Absolutely recommend giving it a listen through, it deserves its place in the musical hall of fame.

**babygrillx** (10): iconic bass riff

**bbfan132** (10): i love the jangly guitar line, sounds like it would fit well in a commercial lol

**bespectacIed** (10): legendary

**booksandplantsand** (10): NEW ORDER MY POP KINGS!!!

**chilipeepers** (10): , that intro is talented, iconic, unstoppable, etc.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is my fave discovery i think

**endcreditouilles** (10): absolutely love the new wave/post-punk era. I could vibe to this all day

**engifear** (10): The synths on this song are just chefs kiss

**Flegasaurus** (10): this ALMOST almost almost got my 11. it is a true true banger

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): nafkdfdfasfdafk

**Gonza\_90** (10): A legendary song from a legendary band

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my 2nd favorite 80s british synthpop piece of music called ‚ÄúAge Of Consent,‚Äù stream Smalltown Boy

**jsonphile** (10): god I love the 80s

**kappyko** (10): if i could give this song an 18 i would

**Kardif** (10): ooh the opening is so clean and focused, drums are a nice undercurrent to the rest of the song, especially with the guitar and bass layered on top

**morgchrist** (10): Low-life tho >>>

**shhhneak** (10): those synths make me melt.

**skargardin** (10): omg what a banger, and THE OUTRO HELLO

**slimboyfriend** (10): This was like a 1983 alt gay's idea of a club banger

**vayyiqra** (10): Underrated album and underrated band on Popheads

**wavingwolves** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Really catchy and euphoric guitar riffs. Title makes me worry for the subject matter tho.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): The drums at the start always make me think, for a split second, that I'm about to hear Whip It

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.4): those groovy guitars and soaring synths ugh yes

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.2): New Order at its finest! Another prime example of what would you find in an indie classics playlist.

**BBthebest22** (9): I prefer Blue Monday and Bizarre Love Triangle but this is also great

**frogaranaman** (9): Such a great guitar line. A classic.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): okay...bop

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Not calling out indieheads here or anything but if you're restricting it to one song per artist max, it feels kinda cheaty to have both New Order and Joy Division on here, but as a Manc I won't complain too much. Anyway, this song is a bop.

**gileswithachainsaw** (8.6): My ratings are making me seem like a much bigger Joy Division and New Order fan than I actually am. It's a bop though.

**pig-serpent** (8.5): New Order's best songs are probably my favorite new wave songs ever made. This feels like it's on its way there.

**notdallin** (8.2): that bassline is high-key iconic but the title is low-key icky

**Vike\_Me** (8.2): Solid New Wave song.

**akanewasright** (8): this is a 10 but like... what is this fucking title...

**brenda\_official** (8): that is my score not what i want the age of consent to be

**ignitethephoenix** (8): enjoying this but also this being called age of consent makes me go hmmmm

**insertusernameheree** (8): felt like it'd be in the ending of an indie movie

**jasannn** (8): One of the best uses of guitar in the rate.

**ReallyCreative** (8): well done, but a tad boring. Good vocals though.

**rickikardashian** (8): why this title name

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): i like the synths

**txrxwxwx** (8): road trip to a national park kinda tune

**whizzer0** (8): I'm pretty sure it's cheating to include both New Order and Joy Division but this is cool so I'll allow it

**zagreux** (8): the outro is HEAVENLY

**jajarepelotud0** (7.9): I was scared this was going to be about something different.

**jman457** (7.6): we should have a New Wave rate

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): all the little stuff adds up really well

**trashypanini** (7.5): Definitely essential listening for those who like new wave/synth pop. Meant to dance to this.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This is the sort of stuff I like to hear while shopping in department stores. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm in the 90s.

**Arybeck67** (7): I love New Order but like I said with Joy Division, including them on this list just feels like cheating for some reason.

**ashandimlotion** (7): consent kings

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song ends at the 3:40 mark. The rest is all ‚Äòooh ooh‚Äô.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): the start of this song literally sounds exactly like that one Decemberists song you know the one

**SmileAndTears** (7): what a weird song title

**steamedasparagus** (7): fine idk

**Sypher32** (7): I could see myself listening to this more than once

**TheEvilNightman** (7): I love New Order, but eh, I find their synth-driven material more engaging.

**Zi99yStardust** (7): Pleasant - nothing more, nothing less

**bulforster** (6.7): The instrumental bangs and has not aged a day, the vocals are... also here.

**just\_thonking** (6.5): I like the synths at least

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): please someone take these great backing tracks and give them to someone who can sing over them :/

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): 80‚Äôs music <3

**proscett** (6): this is OK

**runaway3212** (6): idk it's not bad I just don't love it

**Stryxen** (6): I can‚Äôt remember this song other than that I vaguely enjoyed it

**Uberpigeon** (6): ok getting bored of all these same sounding songs now no offence indieheads xx

**1998tweety** (5.5): meh

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): wave when it's new idk i don't listen to the genre

**hepmeucsb** (5): I‚Äôm sorry, the synths were fun, but that line about the birds and bees was so poorly delivered‚Ä¶.

**nice-cat** (5): I wasn‚Äôt expecting this song to be so boring. to me it‚Äôs pretty generic indie pop? I know they were like the first to do it, but still...

**officialged** (5): Sounds inoffensive. I see it more in the background of things.

**targetguest** (5): good car music

**ThaCoolness** (5): they should've sent regret

**plastichaxan** (3.8): i love many "long" songs (>5 mins), but somehow the ones in this rate sound more like samey and not that interesting the whole way through for me, unfortunately

**timothy444** (1): this is so boring lmao

And here we have Snail Mail finally taking her exit. While having no where near the presence as some of the artists before it, Snail Mail bennefitted greatly from being by a woman and having a fairly simple pop structure to fall back on. I must have listened to this album a million times when it came out and the infectious gloss that

---

**babygrillx** (11): i was conflicted on giving this my 11 as i have so many faves in this playlist but this deserves it for the part at 3:17 alone

**brenda\_official** (11): the most gay 11 to pick smh

**gwenflip** (11): There may be some songs that are objectively ~better~ in this rate, but I have to give my 11 to this one. Snail Mail just connects with me in a way that hardly any artist does (my top artists last year were Taylor Swift and Snail Mail). If you‚Äôre a fan of Phoebe and Mitski and the like, you absolutely need to check out Snail Mail and Soccer Mommy!!

**pros-and-connors** (11): every time I hear this I feel the protagonist in a coming of age film, it‚Äôs just a supreme vibe

**wavingwolves** (11): ahhh to be young and scream AND I HOPE THE LOVE THAT YOU FIND SWALLOWS YOU WHOoOLLY LIKE YOU SAY IT MIGHT as loudly as you can in the shower

**bbfan132** (10): and i hope it never spends you UP!

**bespectacIed** (10): The typo in the rate making me think we are rating that awful Glass Animals song lol. As someone who loves being spoonfed his music, I enjoy lindsey jordan. If all industry plants serve bops like she does, we have no right to complain

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): SAD WOMEN WITH NOISY GUITARS BASICALLY OWN MY SOUL AT THIS POINT.

**esskeetitli** (10): Queen Snail Mail.

**hepmeucsb** (10): Really, if anything was going to snatch my 11 from Bodys, it would be the incredible Snail Mail. The guitar riff! THE GUITAR RIFF! This song is one beautiful heat wave.

**jajarepelotud0** (10): Anything done by Snail Mail is a 10

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Pristine very slightly better than this, but both absolute bops

**skargardin** (10): ok i get the snail mail hype

**steamedasparagus** (10): AND I HOPE THE LOVE THAT YOU FIND! pristine was the song of the decade but this is cool too

**Stryxen** (10): this song is exactly how it feels when a song I love wins but I didn‚Äôt give it my 11

**ggal2020** (9.8): Lindsey Jordan step on my neck

**Zi99yStardust** (9.7): Beautiful, heart wrenching rock

**seanderlust** (9.5): like summertime depression (yes i see the possible reference lana stans do NOT interact!!!!). i love this

**Vike\_Me** (9.4): This is really something. I close my eyes and I can really see the scene they're setting. I appreciate the dreamy opening easing into the heavier moments after the pace picks up.

**Gonza\_90** (9.2): Better than that Glass Animals' song

**Kardif** (9.1): story in the lyrics, interesting guitar and vocals

**akanewasright** (9): This bops a little ngl. I like it

**cremeebrulee** (9): i may need to listen to this album

**runaway3212** (9): I feel like the trend here is I like the 'poppier' songs

**Turpamutteri** (9): Ooh the guitar

**waluigiest** (9): love this sound

**jman457** (8.6): this was my 2018 soundtrack song

**notdallin** (8.6): takes me back to very specific times in june 2018. my wife is super pregnant and i‚Äôm working long hours at an internship for free, walking both ways in the dead heat holding the phone up to my face to listen to music because we couldn‚Äôt afford new headphones. it‚Äôs those horrible heat waves that build you but you never want to experience again

**Flipping\_Whales** (8.5): a bit bland and the vocals get really out of tune, but it really captures that feeling of humid summer ennui

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is good but there are better songs on lush

**ColdSore2020** (8.4): Sis are you gonna release anytime soon? For me this is the centerpiece of Lush.

**Arybeck67** (8.2): solid song, but not my favorite from Snail Mail.

**officialged** (8.2): Don't know what exactly, but something really hooked me in this song. It draws you in and makes you remember smth and forget you're listening to it, but makes that memory much more impactful. I can't even remember the song after I listen to it.

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): it's good but it's missing something for me

**1998tweety** (8): good

**BBthebest22** (8): Glass Animals wish they could make a song this good

**Flegasaurus** (8): its pretty good. i'm noticing a trend of these indie girls with guitars getting pretty popular but i don't mind. in fact i will greet them with open arms

**ignitethephoenix** (8): continues to prove that women really do it better in indie music

**just\_thonking** (8): Not Pristine but still nice

**NotWith10000Men** (8): that guitar lick is nice.

**vayyiqra** (8): This was so good it made me listen to the album, which I liked a lot

**zagreux** (8): I like the riffs on this one

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this song gave me a weird existential crisis because I swear that I‚Äôve never met someone irl who has green eyes

**camerinian** (7.5): This is exactly the sort of score I know I‚Äôll regret in a year‚Äôs time. It doesn‚Äôt strike me too massively immediately, but also it reminds me a lot of The Beths, who I fucking love, so I‚Äôm sure soon enough I will also fucking love this. Just watch me let myself down

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Saoirse Ronan probably likes this

**chilipeepers** (7): , it's good but it's not for me.

**ExtraEater** (7): The one song across both exchange rates I didn't like at first but on re-listen it's actually pretty good

**frogaranaman** (7): My lowest score in the rate, and honestly it's only because of the live show I attended. Lindsey sounded really disinterested and while I get that it was probably because she was EXHAUSTED at the end of her long ass tour schedule, it really impacted my liking of this song because I cannot stop thinking about that show. :(

**ImADudeDuh** (7): And I hope whoever it is Holds their breath around you 'Cause I know I did https://i.imgur.com/124YWFp.gif

**insertusernameheree** (7): I don't know what it is but I really love the lead singer's voice on this one

**Iris3271** (7): Cute song but her voice got on my nerves

**trashypanini** (7): ooh this is a cute slice of angst vocal. Kinda rocks a bit. A bit repetitive but the melody is catchy enough.

**whizzer0** (7): it's alright

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Yeah this band is fine‚Ñ¢.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Glass Animals - Heat Waves

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Guitar was nice I guess

**txrxwxwx** (6.5): sounds like... every angsty indie garage band

**musical\_pyn** (6): I really wish the song went somewhere

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): Can the people in this rate enunciate for once in their life?

**Vromega** (6): this is fine but overall kinda boring

**fadedblue09** (5.5): This really should've ended around 3 minutes.

**wryn\_** (5.5): still like 100x better than the glass animals song so

**booksandplantsand** (5): the white-indie-girl-with-a-guitar industrial complex must be stopped

**Sypher32** (5): long but ok vocals

**CrimsonROSET** (4): wait people actually like this one? huh

**gileswithachainsaw** (4): Maybe I'm just in a bad mood now but I hate y'all.

**proscett** (4): this just makes me want to listen to pristine :/

First Snail Mail and now Japanese Breakfast. The women are finally getting their day of reckoning. This is probably one of the boppier songs in the rate which explains why this is so high. I'm sure this placement will hurt some of the more faithful indieheads but Japanese Breakfast has found a modest following over the last few months with them releasing Be Sweet for their next project.

---

**chilipeepers** (11): , Michelle Zauner snapped!!!!!!!!!!

**2dina3dworld** (10): my favourite discovery of this rate :3

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): this is gonna make Top 10 because it‚Äôs a woman and two minutes long

**buddhacharm** (10): I love this song so fucking much, Psychopomp was one of those albums that I disliked on first listen but it slowly assumed a stranglehold over my listening habits. Stream Be Sweet!

**engifear** (10): Such a great song. I love the guitar on this track + the fact that it‚Äôs about a woman. J brekkie is absolutely iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): Queen! I love it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): catjam

**ReallyCreative** (10): a cultural reset

**runaway3212** (10): just so great

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I went from "this is cute" to looping it. I‚Äôm a sucker for songs that are joyful yet melancholy, this captures the feeling of hopeless infatuation so well that I almost can‚Äôt stand it. I really enjoy the juxtaposition of catchy, simple lyrics and melody with dreamy, spacy production.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): for the love of GOD let this be in the top half AT LEAST or i‚Äôll burn the popheads servers and then **** ******

**skargardin** (10): love this song and the whole album tbh

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): this song is so fun

**zagreux** (10): wow, this was VERY relatable

**Arybeck67** (9.7): a boppppppppppppp and yes I really do want to love you JBerkkie ü§ß

**TheEvilNightman** (9.5): I'm a weeb now. IDGAF

**bulforster** (9.3): Short and sweet

**AHSWeeknd** (9): An artist of colour that isn‚Äôt African American!!??? In an Indie rate?!!?!?!!1? üò±ü§Øüò±ü§Øüò±ü§Øüò± (/s)

**azurepatrocleia** (9): this made me want to run barefoot on the shore

**bbfan132** (9): i feel like i‚Äôm floating on a cloud right now, very refreshing

**ImADudeDuh** (9): let‚Äôs go lesbians! Lesbians let‚Äôs go!!!

**jajarepelotud0** (9): I'm taking one point off because "Will you lend me your toothbrush" is disgusting

**nt96** (9): Very fun song!

**Stryxen** (9): that just isn‚Äôt true but it bops nonetheless

**Turpamutteri** (9): I don't know why but this made me really happy

**txrxwxwx** (9): super dreamy and glittery and bright

**waluigiest** (9): wish it was longer

**Vike\_Me** (8.8): Just pleasantly chugs along.

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): Yes to head!

**babygrillx** (8.5): we love a wlw bop

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.5): This is dreamy and fun but not much more. Musical cotton candy. Bonus half point for the guitar solo.

**Gonza\_90** (8.5): Stream Be Sweet

**nice-cat** (8.5): this is on my cheer-up playlist lol.

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): Japanese Breakfast sat next to my sister and I at a Belle and Sebastian show in 2018 and to this day it‚Äôs one of the coolest things to ever happen to me!

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): hypocritical how much I love japanese breakfast seeing what I just said about hop along

**notdallin** (8.3): that this is *the* song from psychopomp makes me a little sad. Yes it‚Äôs an explosion of color in an otherwise very sobering album about facing the mortality of your loved ones and it‚Äôs video pays homage to her mother in a refreshingly irreverent manner, but taken out of context, i worry that the colors and jangle and lines about head in the morning is all that they‚Äôll see

**officialged** (8.3): Such a coool, moody song. Love the throwback feel of it, and the voice. Will absolutely listen to it often.

**BBthebest22** (8): Stream Be Sweet

**fadedblue09** (8): I hear this artist being mentioned alongside Jay Som and Mitski. Anyway, her sound is fun but I'm not fond of the overly manic lyrics.

**hepmeucsb** (8): Very much a sunset-watching song.

**Iris3271** (8): Cute and fun!

**pig-serpent** (8): Cool dreamy vibe and a catchy hook. Def a band I need to look into more.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Really good song let down a bit by weak and poorly mixed vocals, sadly not that uncommon for indie music

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This feels very sparkly :)

**jman457** (7.9): I really like the rich instrumentation on this

**jasannn** (7.5): This is cute but vanilla.

**Kardif** (7.5): okay

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Idk its like, really nice background music? The vocals are drowned in the mix and it makes it hard to fully enjoy the song for me

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**ashandimlotion** (7): am being slightly too kind to this just because till death is one of my favourite songs ever... but life‚Äôs not fair!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): well aren‚Äôt you special

**Flegasaurus** (7): it's pretty good but kind of just sounds like the bedroom pop spotify playlist

**gileswithachainsaw** (7): Not their best song, but it's nice.

**izeasklapaucius** (7): love her punk-ish vocals

**just\_thonking** (7): I feel like this could grow on me

**vayyiqra** (7): Very twee but I like it.

**wavingwolves** (7): fun

**musical\_pyn** (6.5): cute bop

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): trust me I know

**seanderlust** (6.5): "everybody wants to fuck me" by alaska thunderfuck outsold

**bespectacIed** (6): Bop but I have never gotten into jbrekkie bc I can't stand michelle's voice :(

**booksandplantsand** (6): like the guitar

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): It‚Äôs too repetitive and too short, but it isn‚Äôt bad

**proscett** (6): love jbrekkie but this is one of her weaker cuts

**trashypanini** (6): Noisy pop fun. Love the backing vocals and all. But a bit one note and went no where.

**Uberpigeon** (6): this song would be so good without the weirdly muffled vocals

**Zi99yStardust** (6): This is just okay, it has some nice synth pads and guitar lines that drive the song but it really doesn't have that much else going for it. It definitely felt like it ended at the right time.

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): boring and flat

**Sypher32** (5.5): Jolly.

**camerinian** (5): I‚Ä¶. Ok. That's that then

**timothy444** (4): Clearly they weren't talking about their career

**AGM301** (1): annoying voice

What can I say, popheads loves their dream pop! Just barely missing out on the top 10 is a song that floated around the 10-15 range for the majority of the rate. It's woman, it's dream pop, it's gonna sneak up to the top 10, not much more to say.

---

**Gonza\_90** (11): I used to listen this song a lot back then, and now that I revisited it, it's still as amazing and beatiful as it was in 2012/13. This get my 11 and a return to my playlist.

**jayjaysortagay** (11): issa vibe

**Turpamutteri** (11): Beach House never disappoints

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**Alumineous** (10): This slaps. Seriously. I am now going to check out Beach House after this.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Dream pop made some points.

**mudkip1** (10): beach house is ICONIC i'm so scared to find out what the sub thinks of this

**nice-cat** (10): just impeccable. immaculate vibe on this one.

**notdallin** (10): and with those playfully waxing and waning arpeggios, beach house‚Äôs best album truly blooms. held afloat by victoria legrand‚Äôs signature huffs and alex scally‚Äôs sidereal guitar plucks, lazuli becomes a quintessential beach house song by incorporating the prototypical elements of their signature dream pop and turning it up to 10

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): I have ascended to another realm

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): huge BH fan, this song is just another one of those neon lights and cigarette smoke songs that i adore.

**ReallyCreative** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slgAPbKHncY

**runaway3212** (10): ethereal

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song is so dreamy

**skargardin** (10): this is mesmerizing on a whole other level

**ThaCoolness** (10): Beach House are such a magical, fantastic duo.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): excellent song, i feel like i'm floating

**txrxwxwx** (10): beach house fuels my daily existential crises

**wavingwolves** (10): makes me feel like floating

**zagreux** (10): this is so nice and idyllic

**trashypanini** (9.5): yup yup excellence. A mystifying declaration of unending love. Twinkling and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù production that ties it all together.

**jman457** (9.2): lost my virginity to a beach house song, (take care) so they will always have a special place in my heart

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Coming through with that production!

**babygrillx** (9): so ethereal

**bigenemies** (9): gorgeous, sparkly, sweeping, beautiful wave of music

**engifear** (9): Saw Beach House while high off my ass and it was one of the best concerts I‚Äôve been to

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): My initial comment was ‚Äúchill and pretty but doesn‚Äôt make a huge impression‚Äù but then that outro just kept building and I was transported

**Flegasaurus** (9): very good dream pop but not as good as cock twins

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://i.imgur.com/5KgbaLU.gif

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): puggodance

**pat-rickstar** (9): It's pretty

**seanderlust** (9): lapis lazuli by steven universe outsold

**timothy444** (9): Was going to make a Chainsmokers joke here but this is pretty good. It gives me a dreamy summery vibe on the beach.

**whizzer0** (9): yeah this is nice

**Stryxen** (8.8): somebody will give this a low score because the intro is a few simple notes but then listen to welcome to new york

**moonagenightmares** (8.6): I was hoping for any beach house song but this one, still good though

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is a gorgeous song but i don‚Äôt fully connect with it - it‚Äôs a bit one-note imo

**celladonn** (8.5): this is about the steven universe character

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Intriguing but could've trimmed a minute at least

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): love the production on this

**pig-serpent** (8.5): This would be really cool as an instrumental. As it is it's still pretty cool, and I think this is my favorite song in this rate I hadn't heard previously.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): stan Beach House. stan Lemon Glow.

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): A lovely dreamscape of pulsating synths, ethereal vocals & throbbing baselines

**Arybeck67** (8.2): I do like Beach House, but this song isn‚Äôt really one of the ones I listen to often.

**esskeetitli** (8): Definitely not their best song, but still pretty nonetheless.

**Flipping\_Whales** (8): great but the kind of song that gives me a headache if I listen to it for too long

**frogaranaman** (8): Beach House is good.

**hepmeucsb** (8): I appreciate the vibes, makes me feel like gazing off into the sunset.

**insertusernameheree** (8): I don't love a fade out, otherwise would've been higher

**just\_thonking** (8): Myth would've gotten my 11 but this is good too

**LesApfels** (8): Gorgeous sound design

**musical\_pyn** (8): absolutely ethereal

**proscett** (8): stan beach house and this minecraft-inspired bop

**rickikardashian** (8): https://i.imgur.com/v6EV5Bv.mp4

**SmileAndTears** (8): Last time I tried listening to Beach House I found them incredibly boring so I'm pleasently surprised by this

**thedoctordances1940** (8): is this a minecraft reference?

**vayyiqra** (8): dream pop a e s t h e t i c

**wryn\_** (8): i love beach house but they have lots of songs which are way sadder and cooler than this

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): ; great production don‚Äôt know what they are saying though

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): this is so soothing to listen to

**hikkaru** (7.5): me when im enchanting in minecraft

**gwenflip** (7.2): It‚Äôs a vibe, but kinda one note the whole time

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): It really does sound like every other Beach House song I've heard

**ashandimlotion** (7): they ain‚Äôt lying when they call it dream pop

**cremeebrulee** (7): this is fine but i just wish IH sent another beach house song

**Iris3271** (7): A beautiful song that became way too repetitive at the end

**morgchrist** (7): they do this so much better on other songs!!

**Sypher32** (7): calming

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.9): Nice chill track, but Space Song remains superior

**azurepatrocleia** (6.5): dreamy af

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): God this song sounds pretentious, but I could maybe enjoy this while looking out of the window on a long car trip with dreary weather.

**2dina3dworld** (6.3): insert that one gif of Lapis from SU giving a thumbs up

**Kardif** (6.3): still not going anywhere but slightly better

**CrimsonROSET** (6): girl give me something to work with i cant even write a quirky comment

**jajarepelotud0** (6): Great production, meh lyrics

**kappyko** (6): i like beach house quite a bit actually this song did nothing

**steamedasparagus** (6): I still can‚Äôt get into Beach House!!!!!! I‚Äôm sorry!!!! the guitar is nice!!! whatever!!

**Uberpigeon** (6): I haven't heard that many beach house songs but they have all sounded like this.

**officialged** (5.1): I love this band's album 7. But this particular song... Idk, it's a little flat for me. The melody seems a little inconclusive or directionless. The song is a little too same-y, and lacked the emotional connection that I get with other of their songs.

**booksandplantsand** (5): it's fine but dreampop feels so toothless. put some CONVICTION in that beat!

**ggal2020** (5): I like dream pop but Beach House makes music that sounds like nothing.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): singer's voice is boring

**waluigiest** (5): kinda feels like there‚Äôs not much substance

**gileswithachainsaw** (4): I am so sorry but this band bores me to tears.

**jasannn** (3): Why does everything sound so muddled?

It's about time we are rating KKB! Coming into the top 10 is an artist that people have been dying to rate for so long that it would be disapointing if they didn't do well. A few people really came after it because of the ending but that didn't stop a more than acceptable placement from the shrimp eaters.

---

**bbfan132** (11): the outro is phenomenal imo but i understand why it‚Äôs polarizing :/

**pheromenos** (11): yes to kkb! obviously i prefer bonito generation but i won't refuse anything kkb. the outro hurts my ears tho.

**pig-serpent** (11): My favorite type of music is anything where pop and noise walk hand in hand; I want those super catchy bops that will blow out your ears and make normal people say "wtf!" only acting is right in that niche, and decides to hide at first for the sake of creating one of the biggest musical trolls of all time. Songs like this are why I love music.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I love Kero Kero Bonito, I love their cutesy-but-creepy vibes in this

**Uberpigeon** (11): it was a kero kero cultural reset

**1998tweety** (10): omg this is insane I love it

**2dina3dworld** (10): Y‚Äôknow, KKB has always striked me as the type of artist that I‚Äôd associate more with r/popheads than r/indieheads. The fact that it‚Äôs the other way around has always been so strange to me

**akanewasright** (10): ...This is going to go out way too early because of the album version‚Äôs ending, isn‚Äôt it? But yeah, my friend Ricki compared this song to Don‚Äôt Hug Me I‚Äôm scared and like... he‚Äôs not wrong. That‚Äôs part of why the song is great.

**BBthebest22** (10): My favorite KKB song! Stream The Princess and The Clock

**bespectacIed** (10): So fucking cute and sad and cathartic all at the same time. Time n' Place is such an excellent record. I just wish Time Today the best song on that record was chosen

**celladonn** (10): An 11 contender! So much fun, and the contrast between her voice and the horror/glitch/harsh noise elements is so good

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I love Life Grips.

**ExtraEater** (10): As great as this is, Time Today (their best song) and Make Believe were right there!

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): I was already on board with this song and then the bridge hit and it got Clever(tm) and you know what? They really pull it off. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs gimmicky, the use of the production tricks to reinforce/convey an extra layer of meaning works.

**Flegasaurus** (10): it's cute bubblegummy pop but like it gets NOISY bro!!!! (and it's amazing)

**frogaranaman** (10): You ever gone to a concert expecting a cute-sy, fun, light vibe because of their previous discography dabbling in PC Music-esque sounds, only to be confronted with one of the hardest live sets you've experienced in years? 

 Yeah, me neither. Anyways, this song rips live.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): I watched the video and there was a point where i didn't know if my old laptop was acting up or if that was the artistic vision.

**Gonza\_90** (10): It's my mental breakdown and I get to choose the music

**Iris3271** (10): Theatre kid struggles but make it slap

**jasannn** (10): I thought it was going to be a regular pop song but wow this went in so many directions. I love it.

**lolcevan** (10): this was the one song i was familiar with going into the rate and i love kkb so i hope this one does well. popheads might want to check out the radio edit btw

**moooo566** (10): kkb are the best live show i've been to, highly recommend

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Whilst this isn't my favourite song from TnP or TOTEP, this is still an absolute banger and I'll give a 10 to anything KKB tbh

**rickikardashian** (10): https://i.imgur.com/2FEOP64.mp4

**runaway3212** (10): the ending, I love pc music

**sarcasticsobs** (10): the glitching makes it and i‚Äôll fight every detractor

**Stryxen** (10): I got called a bottom in the discord for being a KKB fan

**wavingwolves** (10): the last minute of this is exactly what my brain sounds like when i'm having a panic attack

**whizzer0** (10): I only know "Flamingo" but I'm down with this

**zagreux** (10): THE OUTRO!!!???!!!!???!!! I FUCKING THOUGHT MY COMPUTER WAS BROKE

**insertusernameheree** (9.9): fun & dancey

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): would‚Äôve been a 10 if it wasn‚Äôt for the noise at the end

**babygrillx** (9.5): holy shit this one floored me

**nice-cat** (9.5): the way the whole thing just slowly falls apart...üëåüëå

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Is this hyperpop

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): I wonder how many 0s this is gonna get because of the outro

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): I thought my earbuds were glitching out at the end, their theatre kid hyperpop serve!!!

**Alumineous** (9): Why am I thinking this could be the theme song for Yandere Simulator

**brenda\_official** (9): radio edit is better but i guess thats what makes me a pop head

**camerinian** (9): the people who listen to the noise-free version of this song are the same people who go to an Indian restaurant and order a mild butter chicken

**cremeebrulee** (9): LMAO THE OUTRO???

**hepmeucsb** (9): What kind of pophead would I be if I didn‚Äôt like KKB? Love the chorus on this song.

**lagozzino** (9): I had this at a 7 initially but had to bump up the score for that outro

**proscett** (9): the lovechild of Heaven or Las Vegas and I've Seen Footage

**timothy444** (9): Good song but wtf was that ending?

**vayyiqra** (9): If this wins just because KKB are one of the few artists that Popheads knows and is poppy it will be dumb, but also I love KKB so I won't be that mad. [Hot take though: the noise at the end of this song was a mistake. It's a neat idea but we didn't need almost a full minute of it.]

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): It's like if a creepypasta were a song

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): not that ending holy shit i got scared there for a second

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): the last forty-five seconds is what is playing in my mind when i'm in a conversation with someone and they overshare a lot while i'm just listening and nodding my head

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): oh shit? The whole band kicking in?

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): I thought this was gonna be a basic Spotify-core song but then it did THAT

**Vike\_Me** (8.4): Am I biased towards British singers who actually sound British when they sing? Nice and weird, thought my PS4 got borked at the end. Was a nine before that, but I respect the hustle.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I think the biggest insult would have been them sending the radio version to us.

**jsonphile** (8): pretty great although not sure what‚Äôs going on in that last minute of the song

**just\_thonking** (8): I would have liked it better without the shenanigans at the end tbh

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8): top tier poppy song but the jarring sounds near the end turn it into cling clang pots and pans music

**ManofOranges** (8): What is going awn????

**mudkip1** (8): kkb really said yes i want your ears to bleed and i will laugh at your while they do so

**musical\_pyn** (8): fully in the camp that the ending makes the song better

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (8): ,5

**Roxieloxie** (8): the only KKB song i've heard is bugsnax and im not sure what i was expecting here

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Tame Impala did it better

**skargardin** (8): would've been a ten if not for the unlistenable outro

**SmileAndTears** (8): KKB's music is so fucking strange to me but this is pretty tame and normal in comparison to other songs I've heard from them. WELL NEVERMIND I JUST LISTENED TO THE LAST MINUTE AND WTF?

**steamedasparagus** (8): wtf I had never heard the ending!! I love it! make believe is a 10 though

**veryanniev** (8): The chorus is amazing and deserves an 8 even though I can‚Äôt say the rest of the song really grabbed me

**waluigiest** (8): woah I haven‚Äôt heard one of their songs sound this gritty before EDIT: I literally thought my computer froze wtf

**nt96** (7.8): Didn‚Äôt see that ending coming.

steelstepladder: 
**ashandimlotion** (7.5): had me shaking my tooshie a little

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.5): I loved Bonito Generation but didn't love this album. This song is one of the better tracks as I remember, but still it seems like the kind of thing that will age quickly, because pop vocal melodies over noisy/glitchy instrumentals were such a mid to late 2010s trend, and kind of gimmicky.

**Sypher32** (7.5): Not my favorite KKB song, but KKB Pog!

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's (not) bugsnax

**jman457** (7.4): its cute

**Arybeck67** (7.2): it‚Äôs a pop song and I‚Äôm a pophead. Enough said.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): where was bugsnax

**Kardif** (7): uhh, might listen to more, but that ending hurt my ears

**sirpancakeXI** (7): it is not a ten simply because of the out of place noise in the middle of the track which make me have a headache. it is such a shame coz i really like the rest of the track but i cant stand those noise.

**Turpamutteri** (7): I legit thought my phone broke for a second

**WhyDoIExistXD** (7): Not the best song of theirs weird choice

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): This is cute, luckily as a Charli fan I can stand the ending <3

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I heard their are better KKB songs out there then this and I believe that. This is fine but it‚Äôs interesting at parts ... couldn‚Äôt they just make a normal song instead of interrupting with random noises and things??? The ending was painful

**trashypanini** (6.5): big video game ost vibes but busier (like most in this genre). The end was static...I know y‚Äôall pc music adjacent but don‚Äôt hurt my ears.

**officialged** (6.2): I appreciate her style, but not sure I'm there yet.

**jajarepelotud0** (6): The outro is lowkey scary

**notdallin** (6): the ending is the only interesting part of this song and beyond that I really don‚Äôt think I would revisit this. Which is a shame because KKB has some really good and catchy stuff!

**sandyfishnets** (6): adult kids music... in a good way. why'd they have to do my ears like that tho

**booksandplantsand** (5): the ending makes my ears hurt ._.

**ReallyCreative** (5): so you're gonna give me that bomb ass key change just to take it away from me? homophobic

**targetguest** (5): I was debating making this my 11 before the song even ended and that last chorus started with so much promise and then again, what the fuck

**txrxwxwx** (4): the vocals feel like a meme and I can't get past them

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): the last part is just straight up noise #hyperpopout

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Theatre kids probably eat this up.

**kappyko** (2): the concept of this song's existence (they're SERIOUS NOW!!!!!!!!! it's LOUD!!!! WEIRD!!!! GATAR!!!!) is so corny and the noise breakdown sucks as well as the shortened key change

**Zi99yStardust** (1): The start and the end of this song ruin this, how anyone can enjoy this is beyond me but the middle is a passable (at times weird) indie rock song

**fadedblue09** (0): People talk about Sunglasses and bmbmbm being chaotic, when this is somehow more unbearable than both of them! And it‚Äôs only 4 minutes!!! Lowkey sounds like a Farrah Abraham reject too

**seanderlust** (0): this song was one of my favorites in the rate...until the last 30 seconds. it gets my 0 because say what you want about the rest of the rate, but at no point does it physically hurt your ears to listen to any of the rest of the songs. don't @ me - if this was bugsnax it would be an 11 contender.

**wryn\_** (0): ok look i get why they did this. im glad that they did this. but they shouldnt have done this

WaneLietoc: > 2dina3dworld (10): Y‚Äôknow, KKB has always striked me as the type of artist that I‚Äôd associate more with r/popheads than r/indieheads.

Shut Up Kiss Me was another song people pegged as a top 10 if not top 5 finish from the beginning. You might actually be surprised to hear that the majority of its run came in the low 10's and only in the last day did it pick up enough steam to get into the top 10. A song that I loved from first listen, this has one of the best hooks in the entire rate. SHUTUPKISSMEHOLDMETIGHT is just the type of hook that you wanna scream from the heavens.

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): SAD WOMEN WITH NOISY GUITARS BASICALLY OWN MY SOUL AT THIS POINT.

**esskeetitli** (11): I don't know, but there's just something about this song that made me give it my 11. Please don't ever shut up, Angel.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): ü•∫

**SideBTrack8** (11): Hopefully some day we'll get to rate a full Angel Olsen album

**targetguest** (11): I listened to this playlist off an on for about two weeks and this is the only song that made it to my personal library

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): this absolutely bangs

**bbfan132** (10): sister has my heart but i love this as well, such a fun song!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): In the name of the shut up, and of the kiss me, and of the hold me tight, amen.

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): really thought she was repeating a slur, but after looking up the lyrics I can comfortably stan an unproblematic queen

**frogaranaman** (10): An absolute classic.

**hunnybee12** (10): happy for the angel olsen representation but unfortunate it wasn't Sister, possibly my favorite song of all time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is basically guaranteed to go top 5

**ManofOranges** (10): I will not <3 but I fwu for trying

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): detonate the yass grenade

**morgchrist** (10): Angel‚Äôs best album, love this tight little burst of energy of a song

**mudkip1** (10): QUEEEEEEEN!!! how can you not stan this hag

**ReallyCreative** (10): a rockstar moment

**Roxieloxie** (10): :daisybop:

**runaway3212** (10): so true bestie

**sarcasticsobs** (10): when i saw her live, once the applause after they played this ended, she dryly went ‚Äúso i'm gonna have to play this for the rest of my life, huh?‚Äù. i love her.

**skargardin** (10): banger

**steamedasparagus** (10): perfection

**Stryxen** (10): give me one good honest kiss and i‚Äôll be alright! Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody

**waluigiest** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG. In 2017 I had both a big emo phase and my first heart break, so this song was both toxic and devastating for me. The writing is slick and I adore the highs and lows that the drums paint.

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is gay and i can't prove it but it is

**slimboyfriend** (9.8): I feel like a horny 1950s teen when I listen to this song.

**bulforster** (9.6): Power bottom anthem

**1998tweety** (9.5): oh wow this is snapping

**musical\_pyn** (9.5): bop

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): this is actually one of the three song that i have actually listened before this rate and it is a bop

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): ; obviously a banger

**Vike\_Me** (9.2): Kick-ass song. Would be a terrifying Shatner cover.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Her voice is it. Love it.

**ColdSore2020** (9): Admittedly one of the most accessible tracks in Angel's catalog, Shut Up Kiss Me remains one of her most enthralling vocal performances, and the roller-rink featuring music video perfectly encapsulates the awkward, nostalgic ethos behind the track.

**cremeebrulee** (9): mood

**ignitethephoenix** (9): love the despair and the slowly building chaotic ness of the song

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I like vaguely-sad, vaguely-punk ladies with nice hair, what can I say??

**nice-cat** (9): such great vocals on this. I‚Äôm obsessed with the little squeak on ‚ÄúI could make it all go away-ay-ay‚Äù

**Arybeck67** (8.9): SHUT UP KISS ME HOLD ME TIGHT

**notdallin** (8.6): ah yes, the first great commandments 1) shut up 2) kiss me 3) hold me tight

**babygrillx** (8.5): catchy af

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.5): Nice track, but Angel Olsen has stronger songs (Spring and Chance were right there). I'm just surprised they chose this one

**engifear** (8.5): This is a great song, although I personally prefer her songs off All Mirrors.

**insertusernameheree** (8.5): a bop, angel olsen could've been a main pop girl in this music video

**Kardif** (8.5): chorus is fun, vocal quality is really interesting

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I think the chorus of this is the weakest part

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): Growly, smoky vocals wonderfully fight with the guitar riffs on this

**bigbigbee** (8): It surprised me to hear that this song was one of the few that people expected to be a popheads favorite. I think it‚Äôs a fine song, and I also think it does stand out on this list sonically, but I don‚Äôt really hear what people LOVE about this.

**endcreditouilles** (8): ngl I had to google these lyrics because I was NOT hearing "hold me tight"

**sandyfishnets** (8): LOVE HER.

**trashypanini** (8): Love the vocal. The slight heaviness works and adds an edge I want more of.

**vayyiqra** (8): I like All Mirrors more but this is good.

**whizzer0** (8): It's a strong start for sure.

**zagreux** (7.6): the chorus slaps but the verses are kinda meh

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Very raw and catchy. Doesn't grab me much though.

**Flegasaurus** (7.5): not much to say about this one but it's pretty good

**Lilacly\_Adily** (7.5): I've wanted to like their songs but this one finally clicked

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): Honestly mood

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): After relistening to this (and her whole catalogue), I've finally come to the conclusion that I'll never love Angel Olsen's music the way a lot of people do (apart from that one song on Late Night Feelings)

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): we need more tinsel wig representation

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.4): Solid and catchy.

**jman457** (7.1): A fine song on its own, but a little boring. I still believe in Lar11k supremacy

**azurepatrocleia** (7): Angel olsen y u so relatable

**booksandplantsand** (7): her voice has an edge to it that is somehow not easy listening but she sounds phenomenal!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i just don‚Äôt think she does anything for me, i‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt like her in the Mark Ronson album either!

**hepmeucsb** (7): It might grow on me, but it‚Äôs just a good song overall.

**Iris3271** (7): I like the song but don't really care for how her voice was edited

**proscett** (7): not my fav angel song but still a bop!

**txrxwxwx** (7): gay classic

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): the guitarwork is really boring, the song in general drones on I thought it was at least like 5 minutes before checking

**LesApfels** (6.5): I actually really like most of it but the way she pronounces shutupkissmeholdmetight is not it

**Turpamutteri** (6.5): Something about this song bothers me

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): I understand why people would love this, but for me it just sorta exists :$

**gwenflip** (6): I theoretically should love this song but it just doesn‚Äôt do that much for me

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I like the melody and the concept with the guitars but it just sounds fuzzy

**rslashpoopheads** (6): this shit kinda annoying but it's growing on me after 6 listens

**officialged** (5.3): The music is a little too punk-ish and lyrics a little too repetitive for my taste. But I like her attitude and message.

**ashandimlotion** (5): like a bot made a female indie song

**camerinian** (5): I really do not get the hype for this song. The construction and songwriting of it just seem very basic, and not in a "less is more" sort of way, just in a kind of unmemorable way. It's annoying cos I know Angel Olsen has some great stuff in her catalogue, but this ain't it, yet it dwarfs everything else she's ever done.

**fkadizzy-1804** (4.5): On paper I should probably like this a lot, but in practice it grated on me

**jajarepelotud0** (4): The melodies were weird and the chorus got kinda boring

**Sypher32** (4): meh

**2dina3dworld** (3.5): It just gives me vibes of an original song being performed at a high school music showcase.

**pig-serpent** (2): I don't like her voice too much and the song writing is nothing special, even if I think the melody in the chorus is a neat switch up.

**timothy444** (1): song title is offensive and song is boring. I rather listen to Shut Up + Dance by Walk the Moon

Here's a song that actually was in first place for a while before dropping fairly hard when more scores started coming in. Talking Heads were the 80's art rock rep which helped due to it's popularity with the pop crowd. That and there's been a ton of memes with Once in a Lifetime the past few years. I remember growing up when Burning Down the House was the talking heads song of choice but at some point in the last decade it's become Once In a Lifetime and rightfully so. One day we will rate Talking Heads in full but for not, a top 10 placement is good enough for me.

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): I‚Äôm still asking myself how I got here

**endcreditouilles** (11): You may ask yourself, "Why is this such a beautiful song?" You may ask yourself, "Who wouldn't give this an 11?" You may tell yourself, "This is not worth an 11". You may tell yourself, "I have no taste". Same as it ever was.

**gileswithachainsaw** (11): A stone cold classic! Love Talking Heads.

**jsonphile** (11): this song is one of my favorite songs of all time. It‚Äôs just so delightfully weird and has a wonderful music video as well.

**Kardif** (11): love David Byrne

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Catchy, unique, and timeless; this song has been a favorite of mine for a long while now

**Roxieloxie** (11): yeah why not, yes im giving my 11 to the only song I sorta knew prior. im sorry to be that person. But I also just think its really fun, every time it comes on i cant help doing the :boobs: dance

**TheEvilNightman** (11): Probably the most "normie" pick for my eleven on this rate, but this is a rare song that wants to do everything and actually does it. It wants to offer deep, timely social commentary: it succeeds. It wants to sound out-there and unique: it succeeds. It wants to be a catchy pop song you can sing along to: IT MUTAFUKIN SUCCEEDS!!!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this is camp

**akanewasright** (10): David Byrne is hot in this video. Apparently this isn‚Äôt a universally accepted truth, but it should be.

**ashandimlotion** (10): YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF MARRIED TO A LARGE AUTOMOBILE. YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF LIVING IN A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

**astrologicalangel** (10): I wanted to give this an 11, but ultimately that had to go to Death Grips

**bbfan132** (10): i‚Äôll be stunned if this doesn‚Äôt make top 10

**BBthebest22** (10): I love Talking Heads and this is my favorite song from them

**bigbigbee** (10): I may be overrating this because it was the song/MV used to announce this rate, and the sheer excitement and delight I felt in that moment is now forever associated with this song. I‚Äôm still so happy that this rate is happening! That being said, even independent of that, this song is an odd, sparkly little delight.

**bulforster** (10): Same as it ever was!!

**camerinian** (10): Remain In Light is one of the greatest albums to ever exist. The Great Curve would be the easiest 11 of my life.

**celladonn** (10): truly iconic

**chilipeepers** (10): Great single, great album track, great pop song. David Byrne might be an insufferable artist but he really did have a knack for a hit.

**fadedblue09** (10): Cute new wave bop. I like the sound of this but the song itself could've done more.

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): That dial-tone-ish pad in the verses omg? The melody and harmonies in the chorus? The perfect campy delivery of the spoken-word portions (Black Midi, take notes)? This is musical catnip for me.

**Flegasaurus** (10): ajajjflllflll vnnvnvnakjhbcfgdsdghjj fnfnfnfnfn!!!! it's 4:30 am i love this so much

**frogaranaman** (10): I‚Äôm a Talking Heads gay first then a human being second.

**ggal2020** (10): David Byrne is my favorite man

**Gonza\_90** (10): CLASSIC

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this happened to my buddy eric

**jayjaysortagay** (10): I KNOW THIS ONE TOO LET'S GOOOOOOOOO 2/40

**lagozzino** (10): It would be an 11 if this was the Kermit The Frog cover

**ManofOranges** (10): Girl I don't know what the fuck he is talking about but I am living

**moonagenightmares** (10): made me finally do a talking heads discog dive and it was amazing

**musical\_pyn** (10): I mean could I give it anything else

**nootnoot781** (10): this was an 11 contender for me. such a great song

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): It‚Äôs a 10 just for the intro and the chorus.

**pig-serpent** (10): Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): a bop, on every dance playlist i have ever made

**RandomHypnotica** (10): What's not to love about this song? (I'm sure all the 0's will tell me)

**runaway3212** (10): Catchy and also really funny

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): existential malaise but make it a fun bop

**seanderlust** (10): shoutout to angelique kidjo who does my favorite cover of this song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): A classic

**trashypanini** (10): SAME AS IT EVER WAS!x4 absolutely the perfect embodiment of mid twentieth century suburbia. Also the perfect fun, weird, offbeat mechanical energy in Byrne‚Äôs vocal that makes Talking Heads so special.

**vayyiqra** (10): A rare feat, a song that's a classic and widely beloved and also became a meme without being tainted by it at all. No doubt it's the catchy melody, ~qUirKy~ instrumental lines and goofy but memorable lyrics. Where is that beautiful house? Millennials can relate.

**Vike\_Me** (10): Its Once In a Lifetime, listened to this masterpiece more that most of the list we sent /r/Indieheads.

**wryn\_** (10): still jawdropping 40 years later

**Zi99yStardust** (10): I feel bad giving so many 10s in close succession but the last few songs have been a real knock out - this being a lot more up beat but still just as incredible

**slimboyfriend** (9.8): I feel like this is a lanky boy dance anthem

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): It's a classic I just didn‚Äôt know what it was called until I did the rate

**Arybeck67** (9): the production is just top notch asf and the nostalgia of hearing this song on Alt-radio as a kid is üíØ

**azurepatrocleia** (9): LETTING THE DAYS GO BY

**babygrillx** (9): such a tune

**Flipping\_Whales** (9): thank you ena

**nice-cat** (9): iconic. also, go listen to queen of afropop Angelique Kidjo‚Äôs phenomenal cover of this song!!

**nt96** (9): Classic

**targetguest** (9): I think I've heard this before? minus one point for being too repetitive

**waluigiest** (9): I was probably a deadhead in another life

**jman457** (8.9): a 'classic rock' song thats actually aged like fine wine unlike many other 80's rock songs

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i think it‚Äôs a little overrated lol but it‚Äôs still a bop

**officialged** (8.5): Such an awesome song. Especially the chorus, so satisfying.

**txrxwxwx** (8.5): solid choice, withstood the test of time

In the early stages, this was consistantly in first place and it's not hard to see why. Often called one of the best songs of the 2000's Maps is just an emotional gutpunch of a song. Karen O's singing accented by the harsh guitar creates a song that was always destined to be top 10 and probably could have placed even higher if a handful of negative scores brought it down in the final stages.

---

**fadedblue09** (11): Here‚Äôs how Kelly Clarkson - Since U Been Gone can still win. (No, seriously, this is its blueprint and y‚Äôall better pay it some respect).

**lagozzino** (11): To this day I still get chills up my spine as soon as those drums come in. Suddenly it's 2004 and I'm back in my highschool cafeteria sharing earphones with my best friend while we listen to this song on a discman before class.

**ManofOranges** (11): CAUSE SINCE YOU BEEN GOOOOOOONE

**MissLunaOswald** (11): A classic, the "they don't love you like I love you" gets me every single time.

**proscett** (11): might be a basic pick. funnily enough, i used to really dislike this song, but over time it's gained so much significance for me that it just feels right to give it an 11. karen O has such an emotive voice. i STRONGLY encourage any popheads who like this to check out their album it's blitz - heads will roll and skeletons are fantastic songs.

**Rhea\_33** (11): I love this song so much, an absolute classic.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/maps

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): This song is so simple but so heartbreaking. Fever to Tell is one of the best albums of the 2000's

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**akanewasright** (10): shut up Ricki this is good

**bbfan132** (10): a classic, hope it does well

**chilipeepers** (10): , GOD-TIER. Karen O's vocals is so great, you can feel the yearning and longing so viscerally. It's a song so good that Dr Luke copied it for Kelly Clarkson's "Since U Been Gone."

**EnCaine** (10): y control is the greatest song ever made but maps will always do

**endcreditouilles** (10): This is one of my favorite songs of all time, it's killing me not to give this an 11. Curse you all for making such a great rate.

**ggal2020** (10): Thank you to this song and Ezra Koenig‚Äôs half decade old tweet for giving us Hold Up by Beyonc√©

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I mean, its not maroon 5, but it‚Äôs ok i guess

**jsonphile** (10): a truly beautiful heartbreaking song. Would‚Äôve easily been my 11 but Talking Heads was on here

**JunkyGS** (10): Karen O is a QUEEN!

**moonagenightmares** (10): a classic

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): both for this song and for giving us since you been gone

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (10): WAIT, THEY DON'T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU. Slow down, they don‚Äì oh wait. "Maps" over Beyonc√©'s rendition anytime, though.

**ReallyCreative** (10): a classic! freshman year of undergrad me is shaking

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): defines "simple yet effective", tugs at my heartstrings every time

**sandyfishnets** (10): I fucking love the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

**Turpamutteri** (10): Why didn't I know that this song existed before!? Clearly I've been missing out

**waluigiest** (10): love this song. Love the Yeah Yeah Yeahs -> Ezra Koenig -> Beyonc√© pipeline even more

**wavingwolves** (10): MaAaAaAaAaAaAaPS!!!!! HEY! they don't love like i love YOUU!!!!!

**whizzer0** (10): oh! this is what Hold Up samples interpolates. I've heard a cover of this too. It's a good song.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): This is an amazing song, but Heads Will Roll is literally greater than all other music

**camerinian** (9.5): The simplicity of this is its most gorgeous aspect. Nothing is here that doesn‚Äôt need to be, the refrain is eloquent, the riffs are punchy exactly where they need to be, and Karen O‚Äôs vocals are just gorgeous. Every line is achingly beautiful and every note is perfectly placed. It is an anthem for a reason, but jesus christ it is not a fucking wedding song NME. That writer better still be single or I swear to God that marriage is doomed

**pheromenos** (9.5): hold up by beyonc√© but make it indie

**trashypanini** (9.5): so early 00s rock revival scene (and kind of 00s teen movie vibe) but a everlasting staple! Rocks out in that almost sensual way lol.

**slimboyfriend** (9.3): This song would be perfect for a Glee cover

**azurepatrocleia** (9): the guitar. the vocals.

**ColdSore2020** (9): An undisputed classic!

**cremeebrulee** (9): yyy‚Äôs has better in their discography but this is still a jam

**frogaranaman** (9): Great lazy day song.

**insertusernameheree** (9): I think this one got me for the nostalgia of listening to this in high school

**just\_thonking** (9): Desperate pleas of love + banging guitar = very very good

**pig-serpent** (9): I liked it because I cri everytim

**rslashpoopheads** (9): YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!

**seanderlust** (9): fun fact: a remix of this song is what finally convinced me to get into dubstep in 2011

**steamedasparagus** (9): I‚Äôve had this song saved forever but I need to listen to it more often

**Stryxen** (9): This really grew on me, I originally thought it was so forgettable but the more I listened‚Ä¶ idek I just really like it now

**Kardif** (8.7): something about this just is slightly off, too fast? Too slow? Not sure

**Arybeck67** (8.5): the breakdown in the end is fabulous.

**babygrillx** (8.5): i was sleeping on this one

**Gonza\_90** (8.5): The good kind of Maps

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): That music video is so bizarre

**txrxwxwx** (8.5): solid song, chorus could've been more explosive/dramatic though

**jman457** (8.2): A good song but they really overplay it at my work

**bespectacIed** (8): my favorite Beyonc√© song

**Flegasaurus** (8): where have i heard this before

**hepmeucsb** (8): Wow this song just brought on a massive wave of nostalgia, I‚Äôm pretty sure like 12 years ago me and a friend tried to learn this song on guitar/vocals.

**hikkaru** (8): i can't believe they sent us maroon 5 omg! indie legends

**jajarepelotud0** (8): "I'm straight" unrelatable

**musical\_pyn** (8): I absolutely love the chorus and the rest is pretty good too

**NotWith10000Men** (8): this is a really nice stretch of songs to end the rate, it got dicey there for a hot minute

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): Idk why this rate just got good all of a sudden towards the end but I‚Äôm here for it

**Roxieloxie** (8): u/mysario

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this band but feel they have better (unironically I would think about giving an 11 to "Heads Will Roll").

**Zi99yStardust** (8): YYY's better 'popular' song - HWR pales in comparison

**officialged** (7.9): Such a good song. I like some other songs from Yeah Yeah Yeah's but this definitely is one of the best. Her voice, attitude, her weirdness.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): heads will roll outsold but this is good

**notdallin** (7.8): don‚Äôt get me wrong, the song is very pretty‚Äîand if the MAPS acronym theory is correct it is very very cute as well‚Äîbut i just feel like the song is a little overrated as a song when so much of the conversation is dominated by the brilliance of *that* single line

**zagreux** (7.8): well this was an emotional trainwreck

steelstepladder: **gwenflip** (7.5): God bless this song for giving us Hold Up by Beyonc√©

**booksandplantsand** (7): wait did beyonce plagarize this song for Hold Up. wait a minute

**Flipping\_Whales** (7): why is she announcing that she's straight

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): you‚Äôre straight?!

**runaway3212** (7): Maroon 5 outsold

**gileswithachainsaw** (6.7): I always think more will happen in this song than actually does. When it ends, I check whether it's actually over yet. It's fine though.

**Sypher32** (6.5): Pleasant enough!

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this could definitely win but it shouldn't

**ashandimlotion** (6): this is sampled in a song I know but I have forgotten which

**CrimsonROSET** (6): opening the song with ‚Äòi‚Äôm straight‚Äô might not be the best move on popheads love

**jasannn** (6): Im very underwhelmed after how many vouched for this song.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6): I used to be underwhelmed by it but now I have a new appreciation

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): at least it didn‚Äôt drag on?

**wryn\_** (5.5): is this really the contender for number 1? its literally so boring

**AHSWeeknd** (5): This is coming from the group that made the Halloween bop Heads Will Roll

**izeasklapaucius** (5): four points for the intro alone tbh

**targetguest** (5): the heads will roll remix made viral by that garbage movie hits better

**timothy444** (5): wtf I wanted to listen to either maroon 5 - maps or yeah yeah yeahs - heads will roll

**rickikardashian** (3): this song feels like being on a fun rollercoaster, on the lowest speed possible

**lolcevan** (11): first song of the rate and i‚Äôm already so in love with this one

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Antisocialites is one of my Top 10 favourite albums of all time, I absolutely adore every song on it, and In Undertow is no exception, this is flawless

**2dina3dworld** (10): This song could be used in two situations: hyperspace travel, or a drive down the motorway at night with the windows down and the wind flowing.

**AGM301** (10): hi step ladder bestie

**BBthebest22** (10): Alvvays are amazing

**bespectacIed** (10): I think this was my top song of 2019. Alvvays has not made an album that isn't perfect.

**bigbigbee** (10): Gorgeous and dreamy. I think the only song of theirs I like better is Marry Me Archie. I understand why they chose this as an album opening ‚Äì those opening notes are so pretty and recognizable.

**cremeebrulee** (10): dreamy

**endcreditouilles** (10): These lyrics are hitting me so hard... You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can, you made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand. What's next for you and me? I'll take suggestions, we toss and turn in undertow. Time to let go.

**esskeetitli** (10): Indie vibe dream? I think so.

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): undertow is such a nice word

**Gonza\_90** (10): Chef kiss

**jasannn** (10): I'm so glad the first song on the playlist was good.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): strongly tempted to give it my 11

**mudkip1** (10): love

**Pam\_Beesly157** (10): will always love Alvvays

**proscett** (10): canadian excellence. this was my most played song in 2018 lol

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is a nice start to the rate

**runaway3212** (10): I knew this song before the rate and it's so good

**sarcasticsobs** (10): for some reason never listened to them despite seeing their name everywhere and now i'm mad i didn‚Äôt

**seanderlust** (10): "can't buy into astrology" psh sounds like something a gemini would say

**shhhneak** (10): this sounds like every hipster thrift store.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the theres no turning back line is so catchy

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Alvvays is underrated as hell

**TiltControls** (10): I'm so glad we're getting to rate this. One of the best songs of the past decade!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): lovely dream pop with great lyrics

**zagreux** (10): is this what people call shoegaze? Sign me up.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): digging this, she has a nice voice and the band is good

**Stryxen** (9.5): y‚Äôall i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any turning back ?

**wryn\_** (9.5): dreams tonite is the superior alvvays song but that's more a way to say that dreams tonite is one of the greatest indie songs ever than a roast of this masterpiece

**Vike\_Me** (9.4): Lovely. Not sure if its dreamy or spacey, but I like it. Singer has a really nice voice, song has solid lyrics. Just a damn good song.

**gwenflip** (9.3): My pick would‚Äôve been either Dreams Tonite or Marry Me Archie

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): this is gorgeous, summery, and fun

**1998tweety** (9): shes boppy

**babygrillx** (9): insanely good

**engifear** (9): This is a great song, although I would‚Äôve preferred to see either Archie, Marry Me or Dreams Tonite here instead.

**frogaranaman** (9): "Antisocialites" is the album that took me FOREVER to get into, but man, when it did, it HIT.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Dreams Tonite is better but its still really good.

**jajarepelotud0** (9): I really liked the guitars

**nice-cat** (9): the way the instrumental drops out at the end!!!

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): it's giving the girls leaning against the window on a bus while it rains and gently falling in love with strangers in yellow raincoats

**steamedasparagus** (9): I love this album, had never given this song its due

**wavingwolves** (9): sounds like the soundtrack of a fever dream

**whizzer0** (9): I know this from Marika Hackman's covers album which has zero weak songs. How come she isn't on here?

**bulforster** (8.7): When she sings the title, I ascend.

**Arybeck67** (8.6): yup I love this

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): there's no turning there's no turning back. this is so catchy

**bbfan132** (8.5): really like this although i prefer dreams tonite

**Flegasaurus** (8.5): first song and i have a feeling my average for this rate will be quite high üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

**officialged** (8.5): It has some glorious moments. Love her voice and the atmosphere. Has really grown on me. I just love it. It's so dreamy and cool.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): is üòÇ that üëé‚òù a motherfucking üí¶ woman? üëßüëß in üî•üî´ my üòè motherfucking üçëüòõ indie rate? üìä

**notdallin** (8.4): much has been said about the final ‚Äúturning BAAA-^AAAACK ‚Äú and i‚Äôm not mad at it but i really think it would still be a fine song if it resolved more traditionally

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): Best New Music

**jman457** (8.3): You Alvvays know the quality and type of song with them, even though I wish they would branch out more.

**booksandplantsand** (8): very fuzzy and groovy!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): well as Tim Gunn once said, make it work girl.

**hepmeucsb** (8): Had to relisten to this one, and really it‚Äôs wonderful!

**jayjaysortagay** (8): okay girlies, first song. I just realised that bc of COVID I NEVER listen to music that's not pop or hiphop/rap anymore so this is a breath of fresh air! This was just summery and cute

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): Ok we‚Äôre off to a good start with this rate, let‚Äôs hope it doesn‚Äôt disappoint me later

**SmileAndTears** (8): I can fuck with this

**timothy444** (8): It's alright I guess

**txrxwxwx** (8): can only ever listen to alvvays in the summer but they're fun

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): sounds like it‚Äôd play in that Norwegian teen drama

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I love hazy ethereal feel of the chorus

**lagozzino** (7.5): I spent a few minutes trying to confirm whether this had been used in a car commercial yet. It just sounds like it belongs in one.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I mean, would I listen to it regularly? No. But I wouldn‚Äôt turn it off if it was on the radio.

**azurepatrocleia** (7): very soothing

**pig-serpent** (7): I like how the rock creates a driving beat for the dream pop so it never gets boring.

**trashypanini** (7): Sounds like it belongs in the early 90s or early 00s. Beach House print in full effect (jk). Enjoyable but generic shoegazy-dream pop-inspired track with a lulling vocal.

**Uberpigeon** (7): not their best song but i alvvays (ü§™) appreciate this band

**vayyiqra** (7): They have better songs ("Dreams Tonite" is right there) but this is nice.

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs pretty simple but there‚Äôs some neat writing (changing the rhyme with ‚Äúmetaphorically‚Äù between the verses)

**insertusernameheree** (6.5): Is there no turning back?

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): This feels very moody, which is what I kind of expected from indieheads. It's cute but it doesn't do a lot for me.

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): Bonus points cause I like the lyrics but this was pretty dull.

**Kardif** (6): dreamy, doesn't really go anywhere

**Zi99yStardust** (6): Cute song but didn't really go anywhere. It's like a 16 year old's intro to 'indie' music

**gileswithachainsaw** (5.9): Inoffensive, but pretty bland. I guess I'm bored of the whole dream pop thing.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (5): Incredibly forgettable

**morgchrist** (5): alvvays stays overrated af

**musical\_pyn** (5): this was one of the few songs I kinda knew going into this, and I'm not a fan

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the guitar and everything in the background sounds really muddled. And their voice is boring

**Sypher32** (5): ok

A lot of the discourse around this song came down to how we couldn't understand what the lyrics were. I wasn't aware we cared about lyrics that much but aparently all that talk was just for fun as Heaven or Las Vegas never dropped out of the top 10. A dreamy bop in every sense of the word and also the song I listened to when I was getting my COVID vax! So it's cool I'll always have that memory! I know I'm rambling here a bit but I actually don't have much to say about the actual song, it's just a perfect slice of dream pop!

---

**akanewasright** (11): You could straight up tell me that half of this song is in simlish and I‚Äôd believe you. Anyway, I‚Äôm obsessed with it, and will probably have to check out the rest of the album soon.

**bigbigbee** (11): This song is the discovery of the rate for me. I almost never really like songs on first listen, but I KNEW I would love this as soon as that first chorus hit. I‚Äôm a k-pop fan ‚Äì I have never needed to understand a song to love it with my whole heart. Plus, most of my music listening daydreams involve floating or flying, and this fits that atmosphere perfectly. Pooh bear ascend.gif

**cremeebrulee** (11): this song makes me ascend idc if they‚Äôre saying gibberish

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): The album that this song is on is amazing, and this is my favorite song from that album. Such a beautiful and incredible song.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Otherworldly song that sounds like it was summoned from space, not created. Even though it‚Äôs weird and incomprehensible, it conveys so much genuine joy. Liz Fraser is an all-time favourite vocalist and I‚Äôm still sad I missed her on tour with Massive Attack.

**Stryxen** (11): eleven or las vegas

**2dina3dworld** (10): Ahhhhh, beach vibes

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This production is next level.

**Arybeck67** (10): yes ma‚Äôam, sing your lyrics of nonsense at me I don‚Äôt care, your voice and the production brings me to Heaven or Las Vegas ü§ß

**ashandimlotion** (10): she made several points

**babygrillx** (10): yeah it‚Äôs a classic

**bbfan132** (10): not my favorite on the album but still excellent

**bespectacIed** (10): Ariana went to the Cocteau Twins Enunciation University and this song was the syllabus

**camerinian** (10): I know it‚Äôs weird to pin recency bias on a song that was released in 1990 but this song got a lot of play on my last summer road trip, and honestly driving down long rural roads with mountains capping the landscape as Cocteau Twins and The Cure and Kate Bush blast out on a beautiful sunny day is just to me a perfect image of dreamy, romantic bliss.

**chilipeepers** (10): Liz Fraser main pop girl

**EnCaine** (10): bars

**engifear** (10): If they made a Simlish version of this they wouldn‚Äôt even have to change anything

**ExtraEater** (10): I remember in the first Charity Rate when there were a few comments on Bjork's "Joga" that it was the first they'd heard of Bjork and they loved it so much. I imagine this song is the likeliest to draw a similar amount of discoveries (and it would be so cool if the songs with "Heaven" in the title won both Exchange Rates)

**Flegasaurus** (10): again. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS. popheads better become dreampopheads today or i burn the sub. anyway i swear this song is literally in simlish what is she saying

**frogaranaman** (10): Purely iconic.

**ggal2020** (10): I used to think they were Qu√©b√©cois.

**Gonza\_90** (10): As someone who listens to K-Pop, I have no problems with songs that aren't in English.

**hepmeucsb** (10): Wow I love this song! Who are these people because I need to listen to more from them.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I‚Äôm ascending

**izeasklapaucius** (10): i don't know what the fuck she saying but girl i am living

**jajarepelotud0** (10): I think this song was trending on Tiktok some time ago; it's nice knowing that the whole song is as good as the 15-second viral part

**jasannn** (10): Pure euphoria.

**lagozzino** (10): Legendary talent

**ManofOranges** (10): Really dig this one

**mudkip1** (10): i kinda hope this wins i'm obsessed

**nice-cat** (10): it really hurts not to give this my 11‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just such a beautiful song. it sounds fresh to this day! it really changed the game for so many artists! none of its imitators even come close! I do prefer Pitch the Baby, tho

**nt96** (10): Pulling the plug on my granny was the toughest decision I‚Äôve made this year, but giving Idioteque an 11 over this song was even tougher.

**Pam\_Beesly157** (10): have had this on repeat for several days

**pat-rickstar** (10): Score is based on vibes only

**proscett** (10): I think about how she pronounces sun on this track almost daily

**rickikardashian** (10): i understood none of the words, but felt every single one of them<3

**runaway3212** (10): I love this tbh

**sarcasticsobs** (10): https://imgur.com/a/0q69CAY

**seanderlust** (10): the instrumentals are just so good the singers caught the holy spirit and started speaking in tongues

**skargardin** (10): mawma this is gorgeous

**timothy444** (10): I wish Ariana Grande sung her songs with this much clarity

**trashypanini** (10): possibly the greatest dream pop song. Elizabeth the first artist to speak in hieroglyphics and doctors handwriting üòç.

**wavingwolves** (10): MAGUESSIISDJISOVEOR LAS VEGASSSSSSS

**whizzer0** (10): it's good

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): yeah I'm eating this UP, the girlies are saying gibberish and doing it fiercely!

**TiltControls** (9.5): I LOVE THIS!!! HOW HAVE I NOT HEARD IT BEFORE???

**wryn\_** (9.5): that slide guitar solo really is like being transported to heaven my god

**slimboyfriend** (9.2): I love it, but the singer sounds like she's casting a spell in Simlish

**1998tweety** (9): the way i thought this was French at first, its nice though

**bigenemies** (9): love the mood, the guitars, and how big and dramatic it feels. Very main character-esque.

**ColdSore2020** (9): Sing Liz SING

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): :pensiveparty: also how many of the comments will be about not understanding anything

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): I can‚Äôt hear what they‚Äôre saying but I agree

**SmileAndTears** (9): Come through Ariana Grande enunciation pt. 2 (80s version)!!!

**bulforster** (8.6): girl don't what fuck I but am she‚Äôs know saying I the living.

**shhhneak** (8.6): this entire song sounds like Simlish. I love it.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.5): I like how 80s but somehow timeless Cocteau twins always sounds.

**gwenflip** (8.5): I actually really enjoyed this

**notdallin** (8.5): after doing some quick googling on this band, i guess the fact that i can‚Äôt understand any of the lyrics is actually a thing about this album. but it‚Äôs less yanny/laurel and more an entire dictionary of baby girl names because she could seriously be saying ANYTHING. Ariana who?

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): reminds me of the Cranberries

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): my last.fm is like ‚Äòhe‚Äôs listening to cocteau twins????? again??‚Äô

**Turpamutteri** (8.5): It took me a while to realize this song was in English

**txrxwxwx** (8.5): like living in a lush dream sequence

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): Makes me feel like I am floating in a tunnel of neon lights or driving down some highway god knows where at god knows what time - it evokes feelings of being elsewhere not quite real

**officialged** (8.1): I've heard a few of their other songs, and initially didn't like this one that much. The folk-y voice affectations seemed more pronounced here than I'd heard on their other songs, and I couldn't get past it at first. But the more I listed to it, the more it drew me into this different, dreamy universe. So now I quite like it. But it's not up there with their other songs.

steelstepladder: **\_SoulGlitch** (8): this makes to feel nostalgic for thingsthat didn‚Äôt even happen

**azurepatrocleia** (8): shiny and glossy

**booksandplantsand** (8): no idea what she is saying but im living regardless

**hikkaru** (8): vegas lemme hear y'all make some noise

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the chill vibe really works here with all the stuff going on underneath. the singer is doing enough with their voice to keep things interesting

**Uberpigeon** (8): I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl I am living

**vayyiqra** (8): This album is so hyped but I don't quite get why. It's fine, I like it, but I'm not blown away or anything.

**zagreux** (8): I love the dream-pop elements in this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This is by far the worst enunciation I've ever heard in my life. I didn't realise the song was english until the last chorus

**jman457** (7.6): Its a good song, just some painful memories of a sad break-up associated with this. Edit:While listening for this rate, my ex was literally listening to it on spotify!!

**esskeetitli** (7.5): Pretty, but I can't make out what she's saying.

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): I don't know what the fuck she's saying, but it's cute lmao

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Incomprehensible, but pretty.

**musical\_pyn** (7): a very popheads friendly track but I only sorta like it

**veryanniev** (7): Only 7 because I prefer most of their other songs from the eponymous album to this one

**fadedblue09** (5): It's fine until the instrumental break caused my migraines

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): I can‚Äôt deny the prettiness of this song, or what an ear worm that chorus melody is, but it‚Äôs also kind of soupy and cloying and that buzzing synth gets on my nerves

**gileswithachainsaw** (5): Not my thing. I never remember what this song sounds like after I hear it.

**pig-serpent** (5): I'm not feeling this one too much but not bad.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I would like to know what they are saying

**ThaCoolness** (5): This just isn't clicking with me. I could see this being a song I regret rating this low one day though

Heaven To a Tortured Mind was one of the best albums to come out last year and slaps so hard I don't even know what to do with myself. And lucky for us they also got the respect they deserved here placing all the way up to number four! While Kerosene! is my song of choice by them Gospel is probably the better intro to what they are capable of and I am SO happy they got the restpect that they deserve.

**buddhacharm** (11): This was for sure my 2020 SOTY, just so dynamic, cool, effortless and badass on every level. Also Yves is hot

**CrimsonROSET** (11): nothing gets as hyped up as the start of this song, like as soon as i listen to the very first few beats i‚Äôm already going side to side and by the time we hit the 1:30 mark i‚Äôm gone to 2121 and i think that‚Äôs correct

**hikkaru** (11): no bc it's so good. i was inspired to check out the whole album and it's also fantastic

**JunkyGS** (11): EXPENSIVE

**nice-cat** (11): the competition for 11s on this one is so tight but the more I thought about it it had to be this one. The absolute fucking groove, the bombast, the backing vocals! It just grabs you immediately and doesn‚Äôt let go. It is what it says it is!

**babygrillx** (10): a complete and utter banger

**bbfan132** (10): the chorus is excellent ughh

**bespectacIed** (10): love him

**bigbigbee** (10): The first time I heard this song, I was on a walk, and I literally stood up straighter when that first big horn chord blared through my earbuds because I knew I was in for something special. This song is so loud, theatrical, unique‚Ä¶I love it.

**camerinian** (10): FINALLY THE INDIEHEADS ARE GETTING SOME GOOD INDIE HEAD

**ColdSore2020** (10): This is easily the song of the decade for me so far.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i hope this wins, this song is absolutely incredible

**endcreditouilles** (10): this has no right to make me feel this sexy

**esskeetitli** (10): This was really good. It might have gotten my 11 if Shut Up Kiss Me wasn't in this rate.

**frogaranaman** (10): God, the production on this song is just next LEVEL.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): The video omg‚Ä¶ satan really changed after lil nas x power bottomed him

**Gonza\_90** (10): I want to create a religion around this song

**hepmeucsb** (10): Explosive, creative, show-stopping, incredible, love it!

**jman457** (10): this song almost was my11, easily one of the best songs from last year

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**morgchrist** (10): Yves really could be my generation‚Äôs Prince, v excited to see what comes next

**musical\_pyn** (10): kersosene! might‚Äôve gotten my 11

**pat-rickstar** (10): A banger of a song to end the rate on. Probably my 2nd choice for an 11

**plastichaxan** (10): yves is just on another level no one is doing it like this

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): sexy, jazzy, nice to listen to.

**ReallyCreative** (10): yeah this is a fucking groove

**Roxieloxie** (10): When this wins and we can keep the black winners streak going OMG

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): art rock masterpiece

**seanderlust** (10): HTATN AOTY 2020 and i'm barely exaggerating

**Stryxen** (10): boppel for a new century

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): oh?? this is so good

**Turpamutteri** (10): The horns are great

**txrxwxwx** (10): one of the best songs of 2020

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm actually christian

**Iris3271** (9.5): A very fun song! I like the production

**pheromenos** (9.5): i have checked out the whole album before but i think i need to give it another listen now!

**trashypanini** (9.5): a lite noisy poppy vibe and far too SHORT!!

**CritneySpearz** (9.3): o fuk this one was really good, probably by favorite new listen

**ignitethephoenix** (9.3): This is a very interesting song, I love how I can‚Äôt place a genre on it. It‚Äôs a mix of soul, rock, electronic and also has some psychedelic vibes. Anyway it‚Äôs good

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.2): I love the whole vibe, the production and those slight pauses

**Arybeck67** (9.1): finally some flavor in this rate.

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): This song just impregnated me

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This production!!

**ExtraEater** (9): Kerosene! is better though

**Flegasaurus** (9): this sounds like iphone commercial music but in a really good way

**jajarepelotud0** (9): This was great song to finish in, really fun!

**jasannn** (9): Those pauses in the song gets me everytime.

**pig-serpent** (9): Get Noided! Hard hitting bombastic rock with a horn section that'll leave you tripping balls featuring some of the most unique and twisted vocals I've heard in a while. Fantastic musician and I hope he gets the respect here he deserves (also fun fact this guy invented Seapunk).

**steamedasparagus** (9): super good

**vayyiqra** (9): Wait this is really cool I need to listen to this album

**Vike\_Me** (9): Just generally kicks ass. Its a great big mishmash of dope shit.

**whizzer0** (9): good pick

**gileswithachainsaw** (8.9): Love the instrumental. The way some phrases are cut off seemingly prematurely, especially in the intro, is really cool.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): ‚Äúkerosene‚Äù deserved

**azurepatrocleia** (8.5): that instrumental is exquisite man oh man

**BBthebest22** (8.5): I prefer Kerosene

**Flipping\_Whales** (8.5): very glammy

**ggal2020** (8.3): omg Yves Tumor from Loona I love your work!

**Kardif** (8.2): big sound, early cuts made me question my headphones. Some good parts, some less good

**2dina3dworld** (8): This song was very up and down, and by that I mean, some of it made me consider giving it a one, and other parts made me consider giving it a ten.

**booksandplantsand** (8): truly an ANTHEM yes

**rslashpoopheads** (8): i can't believe Yves Tumor isn't a woman

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This is interesting! Wouldn't listen to it for casual enjoyment, but it was fun to hear.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (7.5): the intro threw me at first like when my earphones malfunction and pause songs

**wryn\_** (7.5): yves tumor might be the coolest person alive

**Zi99yStardust** (7.5): Reminds me a lot of Prince in a good, funky way

**ashandimlotion** (7): is this on the GTA 4 radio

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its alright

**mudkip1** (7): this is one of their better songs

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): I don‚Äôt love it but at least it isn‚Äôt boring

**proscett** (7): honestly nothing really grips me on this track - i find kerosene much more interesting

**zagreux** (7): I would've liked it more had it been less repetitive

**1998tweety** (6.5): i could not tell if my internet was breaking at the start or if it was just the song

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the pauses in the intro aren't good, they sound like my connection is spotty.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): eh

**officialged** (6.1): I like the groove. But overall somewhat boring.

**TheEvilNightman** (6): This sounds like filler in an average "New Alternative" playlist.

**timothy444** (5.5): I'm giving a score slightly lower than when Anthony Fantano reviewed Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy mainly because it really is mediocre.

**runaway3212** (5): forgetable

**fadedblue09** (4): I found this really boring and irritating at the same time.

**Sypher32** (3.5): not a big fan of the vocals, but instrumental was nice

I trust that all of y'all dissing Time To Pretend were too young to remember in the late 2000s, when that song (along with Electric Feel and Kids) was the absolute pinnacle of cool. 

Obviously, it reeks of its era now, but those three songs still absolutely slap to this day. And without them, we might not have gotten that glorious run of "indie bands discover keyboards" albums in 2009 (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Phoenix, Passion Pit...)

---

Another artist people have been dying to rate forever and with a third place finish I can see the hype. Sufjan bennefited from being an artist who popheads was familiar with and being for the gays. Despite that it's biggest shortcoming was that it was one of his straightest songs. If Predatory Wasp was in I think we could possibly have seen a Sufjan victory here

---

**Arybeck67** (11): I first heard Casimir Pulaski Day when I was a sophomore in high school. The folk groove brought me in, but I stayed for the heart wrenching lyrics. At the time, I was also struggling with a crisis of faith much like the one described in the song. The uselessness of prayer in the face of terrible odds, the desperation to hold onto anything resembling hope, and the anger that comes with the shattering of innocence in the grief and sorrow that follows, is all encapsulated in this song. Nothing I can say here can truly describe its brilliance, but what I can say is the song changed the entire trajectory of my music taste back then and helped me in a time where I was filled of confusion and hurt. It‚Äôs message gave me the clarity I needed. Thus, without a doubt, this song is my 11.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (11): Our queer indie icon Sufjan has been dehydrated me out off pure tears since the first time I heard this. He didn't have to do this to us.

**frogaranaman** (11): One of the top five concert experiences of my life was hearing this song live. It was so, so perfect.

**hollycopter** (11): one of my favourite songs, ever!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): AND HE TAKES AND HE TAKES AND HE TAKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**musical\_pyn** (11): I‚Äôm pretty much obligated to give Sufjan my 11

**notdallin** (11): For the first time, the indie Christian poster boy is doubting. ‚ÄúTuesday night at the Bible study, we lift our hands and pray over your body. But nothing ever happens,‚Äù Sufjan whispers over hushed banjos and solemn trumpet lines. In a scattered timeline of very visceral images, Sufjan narrates the events leading up to a friend‚Äôs passing from bone cancer in vivid details that speak volumes in three-line stanzas. Unsurprisingly, the scenes described flash one after another at heightened emotions as memories often do; in one stanza they share an intimate moment, the next she‚Äôs confiding her fears, and the next she‚Äôs running away in the very specific fashion of her ‚Äúshirt tucked in and [her] shoes untied.‚Äù As the prognosis worsens and the seasons pass, she finally goes, ‚Äúon the first of March, on the holiday‚Äù no less and the whole world around her shakes as if the battle they thought they were winning was lost in a single moment. However, no verdict is made on God‚Äôs role in this story. Sufjan‚Äôs faith remains complicated and ambivalent, as it often does. In St. Matthew, Jesus tells all to come unto Him that He ‚Äúmay give you rest‚Äù as he takes our burdens and our place and we subsequently take His yoke upon us. Yes, ‚Äúhe takes and he takes and he takes‚Äù and we may never know why, because His yoke is still a yoke.

**ReallyCreative** (11): This song is so devastatingly beautiful, and such an important one in Sufjan's discography. While I think Predatory Wasp would have done better here given its overt gay theme, Casimir Pulaski Day is still a worthy submission. I'm not expecting this to win (it's a ballad by a man that clocks in at just under six minutes) but I'm glad its here! I have cried to this song many, many times over the years. Hauntingly gorgeous, with poignant lyrics on faith, death, and questioning how God can be so cruel.

**seanderlust** (11): i could do with the complications if you kiss me on the mouth sufjan i'm on desktop but imagine that doe eyed emoji that bottoms use here

**sirpancakeXI** (11): he can stomp me with that trumpet solo everyday

**wryn\_** (11): the gayest song ever written about a straight romance

**1998tweety** (10): cute

**akanewasright** (10): This is lovely, but also this feels like the straightest possible Sufjan song they could have sent us

**bbfan132** (10): devastating yet gorgeous

**bespectacIed** (10): If sufjan's gayest song and my all time favorite song (predatory wasp) were chosen and not casimir which is his straightest, he would've gotten my 11 üò¢ But seriously, this is my gold standard for sad folk songs. The song that broke my sufjan virginity and god damn he blew me away immediately

**bulforster** (10): This may be one of his straightest songs but it's still very gay (and depressing!)

**cremeebrulee** (10): crying dont text

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I had this as my 11 for very long, but ever since I heard this song at first I haven‚Äôt gone out of my way to listen to it. It‚Äôs immaculate, but I don‚Äôt see myself returning to it. Sufjan‚Äôs gonna get my 11s next time, I promise.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I just want to hug him.

**EnCaine** (10): i'm just very sad

**endcreditouilles** (10): wow memories from growing up religious and gay just smacked me across the face

**esskeetitli** (10): OMGGGGG SUFJANNNNN

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): I want Sufjan to crush me between his Sufguns

**ggal2020** (10): Of course indieheads would choose the one straight Sufjan song üôÑ (jk this is an amazing song)

**Gonza\_90** (10): I'm crying on the floor right now

**gwenflip** (10): Ok but this one could ALSO be my 11 goddamn maybe I‚Äôm actually an indiehead

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media.tenor.com/images/40034381edc2786cbd39b02c8877db8c/tenor.gif

**insertusernameheree** (10): many tears have been shed to this song

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (10): One of the very few on this list that I was familiar with and always makes me happy, as a Chicagoan that used to get Casimir Pulaski Day off from school. What a great song

**ManofOranges** (10): Why am I crying in the club right now omg

**morgchrist** (10): daddy Suf!!

**mudkip1** (10): it's gonna bother me that this is misspelled so im just gonna give u a heads up that it is spelled Casimir. also i cant fucking believe indieheads gave us this when sufjan has so many other amazing songs that are significantly gayer than this.

**nice-cat** (10): can‚Äôt wait for main pop boy Sufjan Stevens to win this rate. it‚Äôs what he deserves.

**nt96** (10): Absolutely beautiful. Was another contender for 11.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I was disappointed when I found out this song isn‚Äôt gay and is in fact about a woman, it's still beautiful though

**pig-serpent** (10): I always forget to set my calander to listen to this song on Casmi Pulaski Day.

**plastichaxan** (10): and he takes and he takes and he takes :catcry:

**RandomHypnotica** (10): FINALLY WE'RE RATING SUFJAN! This was a VERY close second for my 11, and is one of the few songs that can make me cry. It's just so beautiful, so many iconic lyrics, and I can't imagine many people listening to this and not feeling something.

**runaway3212** (10): I like this a lot actually

**skargardin** (10): the horns!

**steamedasparagus** (10): I am crying in the bathroom!

**Stryxen** (10): sufjan just gives and he gives and he gives and he gives

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): depressing in the best way

**vayyiqra** (10): :hanawinsSad:

**waluigiest** (10): this song is heartbreaking. Honestly the whole album is fantastic - the encyclopedic allusions and tragic gay writing really hits every listen.

**whizzer0** (10): I've only gotten into Sufjan recently but this definitely gets my vote... or actually, I think I'm going to give my 11 to Between the Bars because I'm guessing it won't get quite so much attention.

**zagreux** (10): did he just say he was crying in the bathroom? that's weird, because so am i. (stream so am i by lady gaga)

**Zi99yStardust** (10): A very, very close contender for my 11 spot - Sufjan Stevens is a true genius but is also responsible for some of the saddest songs I have ever heard, this included

steelstepladder: 
**jman457** (9.6): this song is on my sadboi hours playlist, gets you in the feels even for a Sufjan song

**camerinian** (9.5): There is such a gorgeous intimate warmth to this song that a lot of the other spare acoustic tracks in this rate lack, even before you add in the flourishes of the trumpet and the layering of the vocals, and the lyrical details are just gorgeously tragic. This is actually my first Sufjan song, but I really doubt it will be my last after this.

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): Just really pretty and melancholic

**gileswithachainsaw** (9.4): Just a damn good song. Already a classic.

**2dina3dworld** (9): The lyrics were absolutely insane (in a good way), how is the fact the girl got cancer somehow the least intriguing part about this story?

**babygrillx** (9): simply beautiful

**bigbigbee** (9): The scientists didn‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶Sufjan really can writing about death. This song is wonderful, but it doesn‚Äôt even come close to my favorite songs on Carrie and Lowell. Maybe it‚Äôs because I am much more easily able to conceive of (and therefore fear) the death of my parents than the death of my friends at this point in my life. Anyway, popheads, C&L rate when?

**bigenemies** (9): beautiful storytelling

**engifear** (9): I didn‚Äôt realize this song was so loved. There‚Äôs others on Illinois that I hear about more such as Chicago and The Predatory Wasp (both of which I slightly prefer). One of 3 albums on the rate that I own a physical copy of.

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): I have to dock a point because in a way I admire this song more than I like it - Sufjan‚Äôs breathy, boyish, and kinda detached vocal treatment here is presumably a deliberate choice to create contrast with the more shocking lines/images, and it does its job in that respect so I can‚Äôt knock it too much, but for me it means the song just doesn‚Äôt hit quite as hard as it should. But the lyrics are out of this world, so can I really quibble too much over stylistic choices? If you wanna teach someone ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù, you can‚Äôt do much better than this. The little biographical and sensual details - what was seen, felt, heard, done and not done - and the juxtaposition of the mundane and the ultra-dramatic, both delivered with equal matter-of-factness, perfectly convey the chaos and dissociation that come with tragedy and trauma, the pathos right alongside the teenage awkwardness, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre right there. I‚Äôm just not as moved by it as I should be, but idk maybe that‚Äôs a me problem.

**hepmeucsb** (9): Okay Sufjan, we get it, you‚Äôre an absolutely incredible, but also sad, musical genius.

**pheromenos** (9): sufjan is so hot, if only he wasn't the same age as my dad

**pros-and-connors** (9): predatory wasp would like a word

**txrxwxwx** (8.7): genius storyteller

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): I hate that this is the sufjan song they sent because I want to give sufjan a 10 so bad but I can‚Äôt lie... I‚Äôve never cared for this song. Either way, stan sufjan!

**rickikardashian** (8.5): sufjan has to be gay, because what straight man uses the word "blouse"

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I'm not a big fan of hetero Sufjan, but this song is really touching

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I love me some good saxophone. Also why does the banjo sound like it was recorded on an iphone

**booksandplantsand** (8): not a bop but a work of art

**chilipeepers** (8): , one of the highlights of Illinoise.

**jajarepelotud0** (8): I really don't know what the title has to do with the song, but I appreciate it anyway

**rslashpoopheads** (8): :(

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Sufjan is absolutely my favourite artist of all time and there are so many of his tracks I absolutely adore, but this just isn't quite one. It's obviously still a really good song, definitely some of his most touching lyrics, but musically I just don't find it interesting enough to be up there with his best. It still has some of the musical elements that really make it a Sufjan song and not just any old boring Indie Folk song, but there are better tracks I would've prefered to rate to give my 11 to.

**Vromega** (8): this is probably one of the songs I would give a 10 if it was sung by one of our main pop girls. The trumpet is really pretty and makes this song much more interesting

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): is he the only Christian artist popheads stans

**Uberpigeon** (7.7): who doesnt love a good horn moment

**Iris3271** (7.5): Cute and sad but I didn't really like the end

**Kardif** (7.5): subdued, nice lyrics, simple backing track, not in the mood right now

**timothy444** (7.5): A bit long‚Ä¶


**AHSWeeknd** (7): If I hadn‚Äôt heard any of Bleachers songs before this, I would‚Äôve been convinced this is was a Jack Antonoff song.

**fadedblue09** (7): Lovely instrumentals but it feels like it just goes around in circles and doesn‚Äôt build up, which is not great for a five-minute song

**jayjaysortagay** (7): this will probably win huh

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): I can‚Äôt give this a score any lower than a 7 or else I will be killed by the angry mob

**Sypher32** (7): Didn't think I was a Sufjan Stevens fan, but this was nice

**targetguest** (7): winger wagging good

**officialged** (6.9): Sufjan is another artist that I've been listening to from time to time, and there are other songs that I enjoy much more than this one. I still like it, but it's too uneventful sonically for me. But I love the folky atmosphere and the storytelling.

**trashypanini** (6.5): the whimsical folksy production is comforting as is his voice. But this kind of meanders and should‚Äôve been cut short.

**ashandimlotion** (6): we go to the church and then there‚Äôs a bible there and then I rail you on the pews and touch your auburn hair

**NotWith10000Men** (6): the song is sad but I don't like the plucky vibe

**Flegasaurus** (5.5): theoretically i should like this and sufjan stevens but something about this is making me irrationally angry

**Vike\_Me** (5.5): I don't know, there's something about the gentleness of the song and the singer's faint voice that doesn't mesh with the story of the song to me. It just feels off, like multiple excellent components that don't intertwine very well.

**proscett** (5): wish y'all didn't pick this sufjan song, it's nothing special imo

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (5): ,5 Give me "Chicago" any day, but thiiiiiiis is a bitsy boring (like a lot on Illinois, oop).

**ColdSore2020** (3.5): More like SufYAWN Stevens #lol. To be honest, I like Sufjan, but this is one of my least favorite songs of his, so I am not sure how this made the final list over some of his other songs.

Poor, poor Perfume Genius. There were a ton of songs to take the top spot but at about 2/3rds of the way through On the Floor reached the top and it looked like it was going to stay there. And then I thought all the scores had been counted and it was declared the winner, but there was one straggler that sank the score of On the Floor to where it will have to take the silver medal. As someone who admittably didn't love Set My Heart On Fire Immediately, On the Floor was still the one song I could wholeheartedly love. That and possibly a touch of recency bias made it a competetor for the top spot throughout all of this but it just came up a little short.

---

**1998tweety** (11): I'll be shocked if this doesn't win. Pop excellence gay anthem

**jasannn** (11): The only song I knew before this rate (and only for 2 months) and it's perfect.

**just\_thonking** (11): Captures the ache and desperation that come with desiring someone while also being a total BOP

**LostintheCosmicFire** (11): Is mostly an symbolical eleven to In a Dream

**mudkip1** (11): this is the best song to ever grace humanity. we are not worthy to be in its presence. we simply are witnesses to the sheer greatness it possesses. it exudes a form of talentry that us mere mortals do not have access to.

**pat-rickstar** (11): I was going to give my 11 to a song I didn‚Äôt already know before doing the rate but I don‚Äôt really like any of them enough :sob:

**plastichaxan** (11): im gay

**slimboyfriend** (11): Why isn't popheads obsessed with Perfume Genius yet? He's gay and his music has the woodland witch energy of Kate Bush so get to it

**SmileAndTears** (11): I. CROSS. OUT. HIS. NAME. ON. THE. PAGE.

**txrxwxwx** (11): QUEER MASTERPIECE

**veryanniev** (11): This grabbed me from the first listen and now it‚Äôs one of my favourite songs of 2021

**waluigiest** (11): PERFUME GENIUS OWNS MY WHOLE HEART and this song is one of his peaks. He really delivers excellence in a new genre every album, and this is where he nailed the sexy pop/indie crossover. What a flawless song.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (11): ; This bangs

**zagreux** (11): I saw someone on popheads rave about this so I checked this song out and I'm so glad I did. I'm yet to check out his discography beyond Set My Heart On Fire Immediately and No Shape but Mike is still a generational genius. This song is so happy and gay, it's the audio equivalent of realizing you've got a cr*sh on a guy. Also, THE FUCKING ADLIBS!?!? "I just want him in my arms" you go, relatable king

**AHSWeeknd** (10): An experience. Vocals and production is on point.

**akanewasright** (10): What a damn good song.

**Alumineous** (10): No surprises here, I loved Set My Heart on Fire Immediately.

**Arybeck67** (10): goddamn this song is relatable as hell. The desire but not being able to act on it, instead you have to ‚Äúwash it away‚Äù somehow. It‚Äôs so devastating and perfect the emotion Perfume Genius captured here.

**ashandimlotion** (10): sus

**babygrillx** (10): so damn groovy

**bbfan132** (10): king, we should rate one of his albums at some point

**bigbigbee** (10): I can‚Äôt listen to this song and stay still ‚Äì I have to dance, or at the very least, sultrily shift around and pose in my office chair. The music video for this centers dance as well, and I think for a good reason ‚Äì the beat is absolutely infectious. (This would have KILLED on So You Think You Can Dance. I‚Äôll pour one out for that show and its uncertain fate.)

**booksandplantsand** (10): home of sexual sad man music

**bulforster** (10): This 40 year old twink made several points, especially with the video which was robbed in the popheads vmas.

**chilipeepers** (10): , one of the very first songs I listened from Perfume Genius and it's been one of his really great tracks.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song makes me wanna scream omg THIS HEART ISN‚ÄôT MINE!!!!!!

**engifear** (10): A predictable top 5, but for good reason

**ExtraEater** (10): Certainly one of the likeliest to win, but hey it deserves it

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): How the fuck does he fuse what‚Äôs almost - doo-wop? Is that a doo-wop chord progression? But then it‚Äôs got this futuristic synth-pop gloss on it? Except it still manages to sound super retro at points? HOW IS HE DOING IT??? I can see now why this guy has so much buzz around him

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): we stan pretty and gay torch songs

**frogaranaman** (10): Fake and stupid and gay.

**ggal2020** (10): Okay this fucks

**hepmeucsb** (10): GAYYYYYYYYYY!!!! This song is GAY! God that guitar is everything I need and more.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I'm loose (I'm loose) And everybody knows I get off the chain Babe, it's the truth (It's the truth) I'm like Inception, I play with your brain So I don't sleep or snooze (Snooze) I don't play no games so d-d-don't-don't-don't get it confused, no 'Cause you will lose, yeah Now, now pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up And back it up, like a Tonka truck, dale! That badonkadonk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy Seven-trey donkey donk (Yeah) All I need is some vodka and some chonky Coke And watch, shit gon' get Donkey Konged (Hahaha) Baby, if you're ready for things to get heavy I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, dale Don't believe me, just bet me (Hahaha) My name ain't Keith, but I see why you sweat me (Hahaha) L.A., Miami, New York Say no more, get on the floor (Woo)

**izeasklapaucius** (10): perfume gaynius

**jajarepelotud0** (10): This song is really good AND talks about a mlm relationship? Instant 10

**musical\_pyn** (10): already one of my favorite songs of 2020 so it‚Äôs gotta get a high score

**nice-cat** (10): such a jam! I‚Äôd only really listened to the edited version before, but the extended outro is really gorgeous.

**nootnoot781** (10): it‚Äôs a 9 but because it‚Äôs gay‚Ä¶

**NotWith10000Men** (10): so much fun to listen to. Plenty to pay attention to

**ReallyCreative** (10): maybe the only song in this rate that has a reasonable chance of playing at a club, and for good reason, it makes me want to make out with strangers and then cry about it later

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay but this is actually such a bop

**runaway3212** (10): I don't want this to win but it is a 10

**sarcasticsobs** (10): winner?

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i found out this song from here and i have loved it since then.

**skargardin** (10): one of my favorites from set my heart on fire immediately for sure

**steamedasparagus** (10): mike hadreas owns my heart

**timothy444** (10): Wow it actually bops hard

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the hook is so catchy!

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): He ate this up

**jman457** (9.7): Gay rights!! J-lo wishes

**gileswithachainsaw** (9.5): This is one of the few songs on the list I had never heard before. I'm converted.

**Gonza\_90** (9.5): One of the best songs of last year

**seanderlust** (9.5): j-lo is SHOOK

**TiltControls** (9.5): just JLo things

**wryn\_** (9.5): i didnt know indie heads listened to gay music wth

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): This feels like Everyday by Weyes Blood but make it gay

**Kardif** (9.3): ooh sound is interesting, playful rhythms

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.2): The track that got me into Perfume Genius and therefore, one of her most easy listening ones (hehe). It has such a nice vibe

**gwenflip** (9): This has a great beat

**ignitethephoenix** (9): love the queer lyrics, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this won the rate (its def top 5 for sure)

**proscett** (9): this might win tbh, i wouldn't be mad. not my fav PF song but it's groovy and gay so we stan

**shhhneak** (9): this song is so hot.

**officialged** (8.9): Fantastic, sensual, emotional, vulnerable, breezy, tropical.. His voice is just heavenly. One of his best songs definitely.

**Stryxen** (8.9): he put his entire perfume geniussy into this

**BBthebest22** (8.5): I‚Äôm actually not a big fan of his voice but it works here

**hikkaru** (8.5): i'm on the floor floor i love to dance

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): living for this groove

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): For some reason I never fully got into the whole album but having heard this a couple more times in some best lists of last year and what not I've really come to like this song

**Turpamutteri** (8.5): I like it more the more I listen to it

steelstepladder: **azurepatrocleia** (8): yes.

**insertusernameheree** (8): fun!! mv is really wonderful too

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i wanted to be a contrarian and tank this but it‚Äôs actually good

**vayyiqra** (8): I love shuffle beats at last something that grooves

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): I listened to this album before and nothing really stuck out to me, but I actually really like this song now that I hear it again on its own!

**Zi99yStardust** (7.7): More on the poppy side of indie, I adore the breakdown in the middle - it really elevates the whole song

**camerinian** (7.5): Jesus fuck I really wish I got all the hype behind Perfume Genius. This is really nice sounding, it has a good hook, and yet it just doesn't click all the way. I wish I knew what was holding me back

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): I love how the synth line goes from one ear to the other

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): DALE!

**wavingwolves** (7.5): wig

**CrimsonROSET** (7): This is gonna be such a boring winner.

**EnCaine** (7): I want to stress that I like perfume genius and he has plenty of songs I'd give a 9+ to, but I've never been crazy for this one. It's still fine tho

**Vike\_Me** (7): Well that was funky. Loved the instruments and the general vibe. For some reason the vocals sound hella off-putting.

**whizzer0** (7): I've heard this a few times and I still don't like it as much as I think I should?

**targetguest** (6.5): love the spotify video artwork lol

**trashypanini** (6.5): loved the production but still utterly bored by this album. Their vocals are flat and lifeless and it doesn‚Äôt help that production is far more alive.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I don't like this, it's messy and kinda boring at the same time. His voice is very pretty at least.

**pig-serpent** (6): I can't tell if I love the hard panning shifts or if I hate them. On top of that, I don't think the sound of his voice entirely works with the song, but I also kind of think it's perfect. Yeah I guess I'm really ambivilent towards this one.

**Sypher32** (5.5): ok

**morgchrist** (4): I really try to like his music post-Too Bright but it never works out, sorry Mike. Love love love Too Bright and Put Ur Back N 2 It

**fadedblue09** (3): Lacklustre vocals, and the synths on this are so annoying! Sounds kinda generic and dated too.

**2dina3dworld** (2): listening to this was dragging myself through a swamp of dreary pretentiousness

**ManofOranges** (1): Honestly, don't care for it! I realize that might be controversial but it just sounds...weird. And I know a lot of songs in this rate sound weird but this one sounds weird in an off-putting way. I can't explain it any more than that I just... don't like it.

I wish y'all could have seen my reaction when I got that late ballot that dropped on the floor's score enough to where Time to Pretend squeezed out the narrowest of narrow margins. MGMT were never the favorite going into this but most people predicted that they would have a strong showing. The thing that really bennefited MGMT above all else was that no one gave it a score bellow 5 let alone a one or two and for the third most popular rate in popheads history, is more than worthy of earning it the top spot today.

---

**booksandplantsand** (11): period. so much nostalgia and years of admiration for this one

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I‚Äôve only a heard a handful of MGMT songs before this (not this song though) but I absolutely love this. It‚Äôs a well executed take on fame and the losses that come with it. Also it makes me yearn for childhood at the same time for whatever reason. Anyway great song and I love the little production hook

**jman457** (11): I'm a firm believer that Oracular Spectacular was a cultural reset in shaping pop music for the 2010's

**moonagenightmares** (11): I've loved this song and album since the first time i saw the mv on tv nearly a decade ago, this was an automatic 11 no other song stood a chance

**pietrohonkhonk** (11): The vibes on this song are i m m a c u l a t e

**rslashpoopheads** (11): I hate to give my 11 to MGMT in an Indie rate but this song just stands head and shoulders above everything else here.

**timothy444** (11): I hate how that people in the future will probably remember the beginning recurring riff from that Sigala & James Arthur song. That aside, this is an amazing bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): Oracular Spectacular was everywhere when it first came out, and no wonder why. It was full of bops of the highest order, including this.

**bbfan132** (10): i want the 24 hour version asap

**bespectacIed** (10): Sid going to New York to find Cassie while this song plays, iconic ending of an iconic series. God bless the generation of mentally ill young adults that Skins had raised

**bigenemies** (10): takes me back to high school, evokes that young nostalgic free and tortured feeling of coming of age. I love the synths and dance energy.

**buddhacharm** (10): Mariah voice that was a classic, that was a classic c

**chilipeepers** (10): , a perfect song in so many ways. I jammed to this heavily.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Surprised this made it over Kids and Electric Feel, and I used to be certain this was getting my 11, but Angel Olsen.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Nostalgia came flooding back with that synth. "I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw, I'm in the prime of my life" still hits hard

**Flegasaurus** (10): i'm handing out tens like free candy üò≠üò≠ but this is just amazing ok üò≠

**frogaranaman** (10): I was one of the "indie kids" in high school. Of course I love this song.

**ggal2020** (10): I don‚Äôt want to grow up !!!

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): r/popheads listening to this rate: time to pretend this was a good idea.

**Gonza\_90** (10): All this time I thought MGMT were from Australia, this has nothing to do with the rate but I wanted to share it.

**gwenflip** (10): Ok this also could‚Äôve been my 11

**ImADudeDuh** (10): definitely boppy

**jsonphile** (10): god this is just such a great song

**ManofOranges** (10): BOP

**rickikardashian** (10): i want to cuddle this synth

**runaway3212** (10): BANGER

**seanderlust** (10): saving this for the next time there's an askreddit that's like "what's a happy sounding song with sad lyrics?"

**skargardin** (10): classic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): A pop song? On an indierate? Makes it the obvious favourite to win and I can't say I'd be disappointed, it's so ridiculously catchy.

**TiltControls** (10): I really wish I could give this a second 11, but I feel like this one will still do well enough without it. The "I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms..." verse is one of my all time favourites

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): it feels so nostalgic

**txrxwxwx** (10): this is history luv

**Uberpigeon** (10): r/im14andthisisdeep but make it a banger

**vayyiqra** (10): There are other songs on Oracular Spectacular that are better to me ("Kids" and "Electric Feel" are right there) and I feel like I never quite got this one, but it is a classic. Having said that I will NEVER quite get the hang of the rhythm of the intro before the drums come in which is deeply embarrassing I literally play drums it's my job to know this stuff and [Edit: OMG I GOT IT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AT LAST BE HAPPY FOR ME]

**waluigiest** (10): quite literally a foundational text

**whizzer0** (10): I think I know this from an advert or something but it definitely goes off

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): They got the balance of irony and sincerity right, and this is a nearly perfect pop song.

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): songs that make me feel bittersweet about growing up ‚Ä¶.. yeah yeah yeah

**pheromenos** (9.8): not quite a 10 but it's still really good

**celladonn** (9.5): Vivid memories of the music video for this playing on tv in 2008 and my mum being like "wow this sucks". It doesn't though.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Turns out I did know this song already, just didn‚Äôt know what it was called. This is great but if Kids was in the rate instead that would've probably been my 11

**wryn\_** (9.5): makes you appreciate how good the singles for that first mgmt album that this isn't even the obvious best one

**akanewasright** (9): this is a great song but i feel the need to show off how fucking insane the lead singer is: https://champagnesupernoverinthesky.tumblr.com/post/125616059405/andrew-vanwyngarden-of-mgmts-college-essay-2005/amp

**camerinian** (9): Electric Feel could've been an 11 but

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9): If indie classics are actually a thing, this sure belongs to that category.

**engifear** (9): This song was originally rated a little lower. It wasn‚Äôt until I started writing up my commentary that I realized how much I love this song. It‚Äôs very nostalgic for me. It‚Äôs the song on this rate that I‚Äôve been aware of for the longest and I‚Äôve loved it since I first heard it back in 2008. My parents had a little external Sirius radio that you could save songs on and this was one of the 100 or so songs we saved.

**hepmeucsb** (9): An iconic song with an instantly recognizable riff.

**jasannn** (9): Kinda basic but it's good summertime fun.

**lolcevan** (9): i‚Äôve not heard this song in years, what a pleasant surprise lol

**moooo566** (9): i've only ever heard like four MGMT songs, and i loved them all, i should really try and listen to some of their non-mega-hits

**nice-cat** (9): I totally forgot about this song!! also just found out that it samples Dancing Queen???? absolutely losing it over this

**pig-serpent** (9): Sublime synthwork on this song. The riff is incredible! Will be very surrpised if this misses the top 5.

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (9): MGMT will always be an overappreciated indie band to me. Those synthesizers will surely make the r/popheads gays float to space, though. Oh, by the way, I adore this song as well, so here's a 9.

**steamedasparagus** (9): I like this but oh my god every song on this rate is an emotional cinematic climax I‚Äôm so tired

**Sypher32** (9): Wait this is a song I actually recognize. Bias inc. - the instrumental kills

**Zi99yStardust** (9): That infectious synth line was the soundtrack to my youth - brings me right back

**Kardif** (8.9): it's that mgmt sound, super catchy

**officialged** (8.7): Sexy, relatable, energetic, young, absolutely love this track!!

**Vike\_Me** (8.6): Lol, no analysis needed, everyone knows this song. Great, but its always felt a touch busy to me and fuck that gurgling noise at the start.

**babygrillx** (8.5): pure nostalgia

**Iris3271** (8.5): Not my favorite song my them but it's up there!

**musical\_pyn** (8.5): oh wait this is that badahdoobahdah bop bop song

**notdallin** (8.5): what‚Äôs the over/under on people being disgusted with the subject matter of this song when the /s is LITERALLY in the title?

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the other singles from this album outsold

**wavingwolves** (8.5): mgmt: but what else can we do? GET JOB IN OFFICES AND WAKE UP FOR THE MORNING COMMUTE???????? me, a normal person: EXACTLY BESTIE OMG WHAT'S THAT ABOUT??

**Arybeck67** (8.2): my scores are starting to get lower mostly because I‚Äôm dealing with the realization of how similar all of these male voices sound and it‚Äôs ruining everything. Like the synth on this though.

steelstepladder: **azurepatrocleia** (8): literal vibe goals

**fadedblue09** (8): I like the simple message but it does sound cluttered at times.

**insertusernameheree** (8): this song sounds like a commercial for being a teenager (but not lyrically)

**jayjaysortagay** (8): OMG I ACTUALLY KNOW THIS ONE 1/40 BAYBAYYYY

**proscett** (8): suddenly overcome with the urge to join a frat

**ReallyCreative** (8): this is great but there are much better MGMT songs out there? are y'all okay?

**SmileAndTears** (8): Fuck me why did he have to be shirtless

**trashypanini** (8): this album and climbing to new lows are classics idc what andrew & Ben say. The perfect anthem for the chaos and uncertainty of adolescence/young adulthood.

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): phone advert song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): anyway of moons birds and monsters >>>

**targetguest** (7.5): this is the only artist/band I had ever listened to on the entire playlist before starting. I got my first gay blowy to Electric Feel and found out after how appropriate the album name was for that

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.3): Pretty fun.

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**jajarepelotud0** (7): Nice song, they have better ones though

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I like the little "uh oh you died in an old video game" noise in the chorus

**zagreux** (6.5): no thoughts

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i feel like i should‚Äôve looked up the lyrics to this song but i dont care to

**Stryxen** (6): Millennial Grandparent‚Äôs Mid Tunes

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): This sounds like 6 other songs in this list, so I'm giving it a 6.

**fkadizzy-1804** (5.5): The groove‚Äôs okay but this kinda droned on

**AHSWeeknd** (5): This is that scene in an indie movie when the main character and his two minute girlfriend ditch home room to go to the movies and eat ice cream on the docks of Provincetown.

ObersteinAlwaysRight: \>Holland, 1945 | 7.221

It's not my favorite song on the album but what the fuck

Actually you know what? I kind of get it. It's an assault, and it's pretty surreal. I wish they would have rec'd the title track instead, I think that would play far better to a more pop focused crowd.

TiltControls: Ah what a great rate!!! I can't give enough thanks to Steel for hosting this and also having to deal with Kosmi's shit, which is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. [Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!! (note that some of the day 1 scores will be slightly off by a few points for now, but no positional changes. Will re-update with final numbers later!)

###Songs

Congrats to MGMT who managed to pull right past Perfume Genius to get the win. Even though we thought the Neo Soul rate was a close one, the difference between MGMT and Perfume Genius in average takes the spot for **closest average between a winner and runner up**!!! With 0.002 separating, they beat out the previous record held by Doo Wop and Ex-Factor at 0.004!

On the other end of the scale, bmbmb takes on the 11th highest controversy score of all time, 5th most zeroes, and 10th most % of zeroes received! A mess in popheads' eyes, but an iconic one at least.

~~Also this is not stats related but I'm abusing the position of statkeeper to say that Wolf Like Me and All My Friends were robbed. Thank god for the songeniality win~~

###Artists

lol as if we've rated any of these people enough to have stats here

To fill for empty space here is everyone in the rate we've rated before this one: Angel Olsen, Japanese Breakfast, Radiohead, MGMT and LCD Soundsystem

###Rates

As mentioned in the post, the rate takes the #2 spot for 11 spread with 37/40 songs picking up someone's 11! Say what you want about the elimination order, but it seems almost every song here was at least loved by someone

Thanks to the Indieheads folks for sending over a great set of songs! It may not have been a perfect elimination order in some eyes, but I think everyone at least came away from this finding a great new discovery! We'll see you tommorrow ~~and hopefully we will not see Closer~~

TheEvilNightman: Time to Pretend is admittedly one of the least "indie" songs on the list, but it still slaps hard and I'm glad one of my 10s won the rate.

Now I can't wait to make fun of r/indieheads' taste tomorrow for payback. You guys were **harsh**.

ProfeNeuro: I just got back, and I'm surprised "Time To Pretend" pulled up with the win!

I know I dragged on the popheads for rating some songs we loved rather poorly, but in spite of all the (unfair) trashing and (not serious) threats, it was still incredibly fun!

Thanks to u/steelstepladder for hosting on the popheads side, and I'll see everyone else over when the popheads inevitably call to torch r/indieheads tomorrow!

TragicKingdom1: [updated](https://pastebin.com/V13QEFjq)

thank you so much to steelstepladder for this massive undertaking!! on a final note i'm not sure if this came up during the reveal but time to pretend is sampled in a song currently on US pop radio, so i guess [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNMZRTROYuw) is the perfect marriage of our two communities ‚ô•‚ô•

swirlycap: I don't really understand why popheads like Sufjan Stevens so much yet find Elliott Smith to be boring.
