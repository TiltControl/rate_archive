It‚Äôs amazing how I can hear the chaos in that song and it‚Äôs like HELL YEAH! But then you flip on a hyperpop song and I wanna jump off a cliff. And then you got people who are flip flopped and then people who don‚Äôt give a shit about either. And it‚Äôs all cause some electricity is going through a slab of meat.

fkadizzy-1804: Tbh I was surprised when I realized that Sunglasses was one of the popular choices for "most hated after bmbmbm, first or second out" because like yeah it's long and "weird" but it also imo undeniably kinda slaps?

No surprises for guessing this was out first. A song with no real chorus, stuttering vocals, and abrassive production sure turned most popheads off quite easily. It did find home in a decent amount of defenders however even snatching up one 11 and having an extremely high controversy score. While it's exit is early, I believe this is a case where bmbmbm wears it's placement with pride as it was consistantly one of the most talked out songs of the rate. One way or another, I think it's moved with a purpose into all of our collective hearts.

---

**skargardin** (11): We love a chaotic bop! Honestly this is so wild and just fun to listen to! I do realize that this 11 is probably wasted on something that will go out day 1 but idgaf.

**bbfan132** (10): perfection.

**bigbigbee** (10): I completely get why people hate this‚Ä¶but think it‚Äôs incredible, and not ironically! I have gone back to this song to relisten to it more than 80% of this playlist, just because it fascinates me so much. I think it‚Äôs funny, sure, but also mesmerizing. I somehow came to watch a live performance of this song, and IDK man, it just clicked for me. The singer‚Äôs commitment to this weird vocal performance makes him a star ‚Äì there‚Äôs no self consciousness, no hesitation. Plus the guitar/bass‚Ä¶beat? Throughline? IDK. I think it‚Äôs great. I think it makes this song feel always on the edge of something ‚Äì probably the insane breakdown at the end. Anyway, I love this.

**cremeebrulee** (10): idc it made me laugh + switchup at the end goes off

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this sounds like an anxiety attack

**ExtraEater** (10): Magnificent

**frogaranaman** (10): This sounds exactly like the "it's hawt in Topeka" clip from "Foster‚Äôs Home For Imaginary Friends".

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Karlie Kloss struts to this at the 2019 Met Gala. Also i don't wanna hear any gay here complain about this song because of the vocals. we gave them roman holiday so it's only fair.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): why do people hate this it was interesting and kinda boppy üíÄ

**kappyko** (10): this is the clit of indie music

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SHE MOVES WITH A PURPOSE

**runaway3212** (10): Love this so much

**sarcasticsobs** (10): helloOoOoOoO day 1!!

**timothy444** (10): so bad it's good, it's like 100 gecs on steroids and if they were nothing like 100 gecs

**useless-sheep** (10): guys i think she moves with a purpose

**wavingwolves** (10): SHE MOVES WITH A PUUURRRRRRRRRPOOOOOOOOOOOSEEEEEE

**whizzer0** (10): I don't think I like this but fuck it, they're committed

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): never would've guessed that an evil cartoon doctor would be a great singer but here we are

**gileswithachainsaw** (9.4): Unnerving in the best way. Love the vocalist's tone; he rides the line between goofy and sinister perfectly. Builds up excellently to bursts of noise. I remember not caring for this album when it came out. Maybe I should listen again.

**bespectacIed** (9): Y'all unironically hate this song? This is so fun. Magnificent, some might say

**buddhacharm** (9): Kandy muse voice thith ith crathy!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): idk how to properly explain it, but this song reminds me of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiN9_vOFFcE

**nt96** (9): See above comment.

**Roxieloxie** (9): god idk whatever i put for sunglasses can apply here too im taking a point off because 3 minutes in it reminds me of the sonic airship level music when you zoom through

**camerinian** (8.5): I like the kinda hypnotic groove in the repetition, and the way it climaxes really is brilliant. It is spellbinding in a way. This is also so much better in the context of the album and I don't know why you'd want to listen to this on its own like you've forced the poor twink populace on this sub to do.

**jasannn** (8.5): sHe MoVEs w1TH a pORPoIsE!

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): I wonder how many 0s this is gonna get

**Arybeck67** (8.4): a really interesting song, especially the talking in the background. The chaos (unlike üï∂) actually works.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): a damn beat! A whole bop tbh.

**bulforster** (8): Is this hyperpop?

**Flegasaurus** (8): it was fine but then it became very good

**hepmeucsb** (8): I don‚Äôt know what tf he‚Äôs saying, but girl I am living!

**JunkyGS** (8): I never thought I could ever be a singer but after listening to this song.....I think i have the vocal chops to become a critically acclaimed indie artist

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): i feel like ur all gonna do this dirty... for what purpose

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I went to Genius to see if there was some dark backstory to this song, because the intro and the muffled background screams had an ominous vibe. But no, it‚Äôs just about moving with a purpose. I can imagine this soundtracking a dark comedy about a female serial killer who the narrative frames as "yaaas slay girlboss".

**wryn\_** (7.5): HOW do you get guitars to sound that demented, that infernal, that scary. terrified

**1998tweety** (7): i love half of whats going on here and absolutely hate the other half, so imma be generous and give a 7

**akanewasright** (7): ...I‚Äôm gonna simply ignore the lyrics

**celladonn** (7): brother my brother my brother and me

**fadedblue09** (7): The beat here sounds fun! I would've enjoyed this more if the lyrics weren't so stalker-ish.

**nice-cat** (7): I do enjoy the absolutely buckwild energy of this track. would I ever willingly listen to it again? no. ‚ù§Ô∏è

**notdallin** (6.9): she moves with a PU-PUUUU-PPUUUUUURLEUFEUFUUEUEHUDURTRRRRRRRRPOUUUSUSUAUISUEBFHSSSE

**proscett** (6.9): parpis

=====

steelstepladder: **Flipping\_Whales** (6): singer sounds like someone trying to do a british accent if their only knowledge of the uk was a secondhand description of what david mitchell sounds like, payoff kinda not worth the buildup

**insertusernameheree** (6): spooky

**musical\_pyn** (6): stan nikki gramme

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I never want to hear the word purpose again but at least there were things to listen to in this song

**pig-serpent** (6): So when I was listening to this album, I was under the impression that it was a noise rock album, so as this was the noisest song on the album this stuck with me as one of the best songs on it. Out of that context, the flaws with the first half of the song jump out a lot more, and it drags until the final 2 minutes where the noise kicks in and the song starts to kick ass.

**sandyfishnets** (6): this song is scary

**sirpancakeXI** (6): this is a male version of shoes i said what i said. would have a higher score if we ignore the screaming part near the end

**WhyDoIExistXD** (5.5): I honestly don't know whether to give it an eleven or zero so I'm just splitting the difference

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): sHe MoVeS wItH a PuRpOsE

**azurepatrocleia** (5): wtf

**jsonphile** (5): this sounds like a kid learned just one chord on guitar and is going to play it again and again driving his parents mad

**just\_thonking** (5): On the one hand, the beat/instrumental is kind of nice; on the other hand, what in the WORLD

**nootnoot781** (5): what

**plastichaxan** (5): if the man didn't sing and it was just the background and instrumental this would be a 10

**rickikardashian** (5): i can't give this too low of a score because if this had autotune and some synths, it would be called hyperpop and it'd tolerate it

**steamedasparagus** (5): why is this here

**TheEvilNightman** (5): I'm assuming this was the troll, "99% of users won't get this track" pick they gave us. So to the r/indieheads users coming here to see our reactions, I say y'all know jack shit about stolen mattresses.

**ashandimlotion** (4.5): Nikki Grahame is the icon but this shit is pretty boring

**veryanniev** (4.5): If I ever need to scare away my Tinder hookup, I‚Äôm putting this on

**Alumineous** (4): I know they're being sarcastic, but it's still obnoxious as hell.

**CritneySpearz** (4): this scared me towards the end

**Gonza\_90** (4): What's the purpose of this song, exactly?

**Iris3271** (4): Purpose no longer feels like a word

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): I have to give him points for trying

**SmileAndTears** (4): Can this woman shut up omg. And the singer too while we're at it

**Turpamutteri** (4): What the hell did I just listen to

**txrxwxwx** (4): kinda bored me, sorry indieheads

**officialged** (3.2): OK, another eerie one. I liked the experimentalism but wouldn't handle another listen through.

**babygrillx** (3): the purpose may be magnificent but the song is not

**engifear** (3): Someone tell them that experimental music is allowed to be good

**gwenflip** (3): cut off a two minutes and it would earn an extra point

**morgchrist** (3): lol what!

**trashypanini** (3): cool heavy & (doom vibe) start until the assault of noise became annoying. Not into the vocal sounding compressed or put through a vocoder.

**waluigiest** (3): lookin for a purpose too

**Stryxen** (2.5): is this how indieheads hear daddy af

**jman457** (2.2): like the previous song but more boring

**astrologicalangel** (2): am I missing somethinh? Do I just not get this?

**Pam\_Beesly157** (2): i truly don't get it lmao

**seanderlust** (2): songs for when you're at karaoke and you're like "how do I get everyone to leave?"

**Sypher32** (2): instrumental is nice, but I have no idea what they're saying. Got gradually worse as it progressed lol

**vayyiqra** (2): yes I love Boombayah by Blackpink One recurring thing in this rate seems to be singers who are awful (and not because they're men, because men can be and are good singers; but this guy is not one of them) and another is very repetitive songs. It's testing my patience even though I understand this song is meant to be ironic or satirical or something. At least it's better than "Sunglasses".

**Zi99yStardust** (2): Grating vocals and mostly boring until a wall of noise hits at the end which is frankly more horrible but at least it's different

**2dina3dworld** (1): the whole shtick wore out after about a minute and a half. After that it started sounding like a bunch of annoying theatre kids after three RTD‚Äôs.

**fkadizzy-1804** (1): /r/indieheads y‚Äôall served us this when you could have picked literally any Joanna Newsom song instead? And yes, when I say ‚Äúliterally any‚Äù I‚Äôm including the Walnut Whales version of Peach, Plum, Pear. I kinda like the instrumental breakdown near the end and that‚Äôs it.

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (1): Back to back sounds that just....left me feeling very unsettled, which is not how I like to enjoy my music. I hope this playlist picks up

**lagozzino** (1): I desperately hope that they voted for this as a troll song and not because they genuinely love it

**ManofOranges** (1): Is this what my straight friends hear when I play any of charli's music?

**rslashpoopheads** (1): bmbmbm more like bdbdbd (short for bad bad bad get it haha lol) [I bow triumphantly, basking in the shower of juicy, succulent tomatoes]

**AGM301** (0): trash just like its name

**booksandplantsand** (0): indieheads stop subjecting us to songs by mentally ill men challenge

**bookthieving** (0): maybe if this instrumental moved with a purpose

**brenda\_official** (0): is this the best theyve got lol annoying ass music jkjk

**E3-NotTheConvention** (0): I didn't think I'd give a zero in this rate, but this gave me no option. It has no redeeming qualities

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): It never goes anywhere for like 200 seconds, then it explodes but without any purpose... And the guy sounds like Lin-Manuel Miranda...

**EnCaine** (0): The first time I heard this song I Just Couldn't. I thought it was only fair to listen to it again for this rate and I regret it. I'd rather listen to brokencyde mashed up with the worst Merzbow song over this. It's not even fun ironically or composed poorly enough to be interesting.

**esskeetitli** (0): No comment. This was absolutely HORRIBLE. Stream Arca instead if you want experimental music.

**ggal2020** (0): Why do men like music that brings physical pain to the ears of the listener?

**hikkaru** (0): make it stop omfg im legitimately uncomfortable

**hunnybee12** (0): i listened to the playlist while driving and this outro came on while i was trying to make a left turn and i had to skip it bc i felt an anxiety attack coming on

**ignitethephoenix** (0): what is this.... well at least when this guy stops talking it goes hard

**jajarepelotud0** (0): pretty boring ngl

**Kardif** (0): two minutes in I just want this to have ended 90 seconds ago, thought it was getting better at the 3 minute mark and it just didn't. Not enough music to the noise, the noise genre normally sounds better. Can't believe I listened to all of this

**LesApfels** (0): I may willingly subject myself to the Click outro but this is just too much

**Lilacly\_Adily** (0): I originally had it at 3 but it stuck in my head for a night so I hate it

**lolcevan** (0): i‚Äôm uncomfortable

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (0): This one's gonna be a no for me, dawg

**moonagenightmares** (0): this was an extremely unpleasant experience

**pat-rickstar** (0): I can‚Äôt tell if indieheads actually, genuinely likes this song or they sent it to troll us or maybe both

**RandomHypnotica** (0): yeah‚Ä¶ this doesn't work for me. It feels like the musical equivalent of this https://i.imgur.com/OzA4yyD.jpg

**ReallyCreative** (0): it would be a 10 if there were no vocals and it was just the Nikki Grahame sample and instrumental

**shhhneak** (0): felt like I was listening to a serial killer‚Äôs voicemail.

**slimboyfriend** (0): Proof that a British man could literally mumble over a stale guitar loop and indieheads would go crazy for it.

**targetguest** (0): is this the straight person equivalent of the ending of Click by Charli XCX? if so, I'm sorry for the score but what the fuck

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): My middle school principal used to yell at us to move with a purpose and this gave me flashbacks in the worst way

**TiltControls** (0): I like a lot of things in this rate, but this is not one

**Vike\_Me** (0): Well, of all the noise rock songs I've heard, that was certainly a noise rock song.

**Vromega** (0): I think I have done nearly 20 rates and I had never given any 0s. But bmbmbm deserves it. Probably one of the worst "songs" I've ever listened to. The 10 first seconds are already a nightmare but it goes worse and worse. My ears bled so hard. I had to stop listening to the playlist to listen to EMOTION in full. I tried to listen to it a second time but couldn't

**WillamThunderfuck** (0): People actually listen to this for their enjoyment?!?!?! One of the worst songs I've ever heard tbh.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (0): ; chile

**zagreux** (0): "She moves with a purpose" well, this song doesn't

Fireworks struggled from the beginning with being too long for most popheads. Animal Collective have a decent amount of more synth driven boppy stuff but this was more on the true indie side of things which didn't help either. It unfortunately never left the bottom five either as it got lost in the wash with a lot of other longer accoustic driven songs.

---

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): this is one of my favorite songs of all times. since it came out, my brain has just been obsessed with it. it's joyful and mourning and repetitive and animalistic but also so full of these moments of sheer emotion and it's just so quietly amazing

**bbfan132** (10): felt like an odd 7 minute trip and i loved it

**Flegasaurus** (10): the first u/flegasaurus seal of approval today

**moonagenightmares** (10): I guess i really do need to check out more animal collective

**pig-serpent** (10): Officer help that elephant just stole my purse! I love Anco because they aren't afraid of making music that is weird, artsy, and totally outthere without sacrificing fun. And yeah this is far from the weirdest Anco track but it's certainly one of the most fun.

**proscett** (10): i feel like this is gonna go out really quick which would prove once again popheads is tasteless. if you gave this a low score i hope a baby poops on you

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): This song loses me a bit at the bridge because I‚Äôm a simple bitch who likes stuff to be easy to listen to, and with more experimental music I need at least one of melody or groove or pretty instrumentation or emotional intensity to hook me in, whereas here the bridge got aggressively weird without having any of those payoff elements, but the rest of the song hit me hard and was interesting and memorable without being hostile so all in all A+

**frogaranaman** (9): The production on this track is absolutely bonkers, this is such a fun track.

**morgchrist** (9): Strawberry Jam is just about the only good Animal Collective album

**wavingwolves** (9): that bridge was infused w something it's just too infectious

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): Animal Collective feels like Passion Pit, if you take the Pop out of Indie Pop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This song has one hell of an opening. The riff is really catchy and fun; immediately it draws you in. Plus, the tense running beat throughout really gives the song a great energy. However - and I literally hate that I think this because I think it makes me basic - I think this one is a little long, mates. I don‚Äôt mind long songs, but I really feel the length with this one. Around minute five I‚Äôm like this is nice, but there‚Äôs almost two minutes left? Huh.

**TiltControls** (8.5): I love Katy Perry!

**jman457** (8.4): not my favorite song from AC, but even their ok songs are better than many bands best songs

**officialged** (8.3): At first, I thought it didn't have enough melody to it, but I really grew to like it. Until now I had only been exposed to their album Merriweather Post Pavilion and thought I wouldn't like their previous releases, but I was wrong. The experimentive instrumentation, the adventurous feel and the boyishness and passion in his voice. They could've trimmed a minute or two off though.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.1): i can‚Äôt decide if i like this guy‚Äôs voice or not. the last half of this song is pretty good anyway

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This actually slaps, but this vocalist really shouldn't sing like... ever. Insert kappy's "how indie male singers being bad are actually a good thing" take here.

**ggal2020** (8): They get an eight but only because I like My Girls so much.

**whizzer0** (8): this has like the generic american indie guy voice which both annoys me and makes me feel a weird nostalgia

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): hm i like a couple of these lyrics and i do like the instrumentation but i feel like i‚Äôm not completely in love with this

**TheEvilNightman** (7.8): Too much fire.

**engifear** (7.5): Once again the wrong song was picked! Man of Oil snubbed

**jasannn** (7.5): I wouldve had the same impact if it was shorter.

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): the bridge-chorus kinda loses me, but the rest of the song is so good

**Stryxen** (7.5): this really does sound like the album cover looks but i hate how much i enjoyed this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.4): I don‚Äôt love the vocals here (I do like the vocals on some other Animal Collective songs), but the music definitely bops in a weird way

**notdallin** (7.3): i mean they were right to not send us the more accessible MPP tracks like ‚ÄúMy Girls,‚Äù ‚ÄúBluish,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBrothersport‚Äù just by virtue of our community valuing hooks and catchiness ~~but i would‚Äôve given those ones much higher scores~~

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.2): Never fully enjoyed this band, but I like this. The little animal whoops add a slightly unhinged element that builds and subsides periodically, and keeps the song from dragging.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): this has good moments but as a whole I‚Äôm not in love it with

**Arybeck67** (7): the production is pretty cool and the reason why the score is high as it is. The vocalist tho...leads a lot to be desired.

**azurepatrocleia** (7): love the vocals

**endcreditouilles** (7): the singer's voice and punchy drums remind me a bit of Say Anything

**moooo566** (7): in a rate full of Indie Dude Voices this dude has the most indie dude voice

**runaway3212** (7): katy perry outsold

**waluigiest** (7): JUSTICE FOR SUMMERTIME CLOTHES

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7): ; I really loved the production on this.

**babygrillx** (6.5): this was cute at the start but fell off for me

**BBthebest22** (6.5): good song but not my thing

**camerinian** (6.5): I definitely got into the groove of this more as it went along. There‚Äôs just something about Animal Collective‚Äôs music that puts me on edge though, and I don‚Äôt really know what it is, cos outwardly they seem extremely dreamy.

**LesApfels** (6): Coal miners singing before they die trapped in an exploding mine shaft vibes

**steamedasparagus** (6): this is a 6 minute long fun. b-side

**txrxwxwx** (6): chaotic and British sounding (even if they're not British)

**bulforster** (5.6): Warm cereal is such a gross image that I'm a bit distracted for the rest of the song, which has some interesting parts.

**1998tweety** (5.5): this feels twice as long as it should be

**celladonn** (5): Sorry for being a basic binch but i just can't get into this band aside from My Girls and Bluish

**CrimsonROSET** (5): but why are you yelling

**Gonza\_90** (5): Not impressed

**gwenflip** (5): It‚Äôs not a bad song it‚Äôs just not my jam

**hunnybee12** (5): did i lower my score a whole point bc of the hideous album art that resembles rotting flesh? possibly!

**pat-rickstar** (5): It's boring and I know we're rating the music and not the album covers but I really hate this album cover

**ReallyCreative** (5): Coco Peru voice: Why is this man screaming at me

**vayyiqra** (5): d o y o u e v e r f e e l like you're in a hipster coffeehouse or bar? Because this is the exact kind of music they play in there during the daytime, only longer.

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): This song could have been cut in half and I would still think it lasted too long.

**wryn\_** (5): these indie hoes listen to the longest fucking songs omfg

**rickikardashian** (4.7): ‚ÄúThe frightened babies poo‚Äù ‚Ä¶.i guess they do, but i dont know why you‚Äôre telling me about it

**ashandimlotion** (4.5): ugh men!

**fadedblue09** (4.5): The instrumental has intriguing elements but it just drags on for too long.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4.5): this song is simultaneous really catchy and anxiety-inducing

**trashypanini** (4.5): Most indie dudes went for that whiny loud-ish inflection in songs to add ~emotion/or emphasize a part~ in 00s & 10s. It sometimes works...here it sounds like he has a respiratory infection & is too over dramatic. The parts w/o that mess are my faves. The folkys(?) production does have a offbeat charm.

**\_SoulGlitch** (4): I didn‚Äôt really like this, felt too monotone and didn‚Äôt really build up to anything

**insertusernameheree** (4): I started thinking this would be an 8 and it kept dropping as it went on and got more and more chaotic :/

**Kardif** (4): vaguely rhythmic sounds with some early 2010s style atonal talk-singing

**nice-cat** (4): i respect how influential this album was, but this one is just not for me. tbh I wish they‚Äôd picked something from MPP. Fellow popheads, please listen to Summertime Clothes & give Animal Collective another chance!!

**seanderlust** (4): if you're gonna have a long song, please have it go somewhere

**timothy444** (4): David is no Katy Perry

**useless-sheep** (4): not to be a pophead but this is too long and the guys vocals flopped sorry

**E3-NotTheConvention** (3): Got tired of it real quick, it felt like a chore to go trough and it felt like it didn't go anywhere (sorry). Props for the creativity, tho

**NotWith10000Men** (3): this is the guy from imagine dragons right

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): I would like this more if I could hear what he was saying. Actually, even if i could understand what he was saying, this song would still be boring

**whatyourheartdesires** (3): really noisy

**2dina3dworld** (2): somehow this felt longer than Dopesmoker

**jayjaysortagay** (2): this is the kind of indie music's I can't listen to sorry :( dude needs to take a breath xoxo

**targetguest** (2): this song gives me anxiety if I listen to it with good headphones it was only tolerable driving a 1999 bmw with a clapped out audio system and the windows down

**zagreux** (2): this was too boring and same-y, the vocoder effect killed it for me

**Zi99yStardust** (2): I really like some AC but this is just a collection of horrible dissonance; it's so messy

**AGM301** (1): soooo bad

**jajarepelotud0** (1): I disliked this song from the moment he used cereal as a metaphor

**rslashpoopheads** (1): honestly this is what I expected all the songs in this rate to sound like, just some generic indie man half screaming half whining some incoherent melody for way too many minutes

**Sypher32** (1): Not a fan, and long

**chilipeepers** (0): , I DON'T LIKE ANIMAL COLLECTIVE. It's 2021, no one should listen to them anymore.

**veryanniev** (0): Seven minutes in hell

Far and away the single most talked about song in the rate, Sunglasses was immediately divisive with it's long length, abrassive lyrics, and in your face production. It was SO talked about that you'd actually be surprised that while the controversy score is high, it's not the highest score in the rate. That's mostly because as the rate went on more and more people were coming around on it in one way or another even if they didn't love it as a whole. Lots of 6-9s came in on those last two days which brought the score way down. Sometimes songs become part of popheads folklore despite going out fairly early (see Dopesmoker). I think this is one of those songs that we will be talking about for a long time and will out live its rate. If there ever is an All Stars rate with only songs that placed in the bottom 5, this would be an excelent 11.

---

**Alumineous** (11): I can't cover the entire song in a comment. I'll note just one: "Fuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac". The main singer is Isaac Wood. It's also incredible how he was able to sing this line in so many ways. Desperate. Angry. Demanding. Impulsively. Also, notably, that line is not on the 2021 version. The 2019 version, or the version we're rating, is clearly more emotionally charged. Which is why I like it more. I know this song will be gone early on. But whatever. This song is fantastic. And I love a good story telling song.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): So why is this my 11? Well, I have a spot for songs where the singer just goes batshit insane slowly throughout (kinda like Dance Monkey). Now, he kinda starts going insane fast, but it gets the job done. anyways, https://i.imgur.com/CoF9R9s.gif

**moooo566** (11): everything about this is amazing, im saving it to my playlist and skipping it every single time it comes up on shuffle because its 9 minutes long

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Choosing the 11 was not an easy task, both Tunnels and Time to Pretend had it at one point but ultimately I opted for Sunglasses. It's probably recency bias but this song absolutely deserves an 11, the comparatively calm opening to the track leading into what feels like a fall into insanity is already an amazing start before it reaches the climax I can only describe in one short word. Epic. Despite there being more meaning to the lyrics, the fact that they sound like a man rambling utter nonsense in the middle of a mental breakdown makes it all the more enticing and the voice and tone Isaac delivers the lyrics in convey that exact same insanity, which makes listening to it such an incredible and memorable experience every single time.

**Vike\_Me** (11): What the fuck, why does this work. There were a lot of basically perfect songs, but this is just really interesting to bear witness to. The absolute pinnacle of British engineering.

**1998tweety** (10): ok i was NOT expecting to like this but wow im ascending. lowkey an 11 contender

**AGM301** (10): mad british guys turn me on

**akanewasright** (10): I have to give credit for ambition. But indieheads, y‚Äôall are fucking delusional if you think your list of songs was an easy listen compared to ours with this in your list

**bbfan132** (10): i love how wild this is lmao

**bulforster** (10): serve

**camerinian** (10): ok so maybe I'm a pretentious cock

**cremeebrulee** (10): LEAVE KANYE OUT OF THIS????

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I love it so much and I have no idea exactly why??? I don't know how anyone would dislike this either, it's such an odd feeling, LMAO.

**EnCaine** (10): this better not go out day 1

**Flegasaurus** (10): dear popheads DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS ONE. a true banger.

**frogaranaman** (10): ...and F≈™√áK me like you mean it.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): yes daddy isaac fuck me like you mean it. seriously though, i'm glad they chose the single version and not the album one. not that i dislike the album one, but i really like the grittiness of the single version that is otherwise absent on the album.

**kappyko** (10): FUCK ME LIKE YOU MEAN IT THIS TIME ISAAC!!!!!!!!!!

**Kardif** (10): this is a trip, the saxophone is great, reminds me of David Byrne.

**letsallpoo** (10): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i am living

**moonagenightmares** (10): insane

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i like both this version and the album version but this is a bit better

**nt96** (10): Chaotic af and I‚Äôm here for it.

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): I have to give it a 10 for the absolute roller coaster of a song it is

**plastichaxan** (10): when i meet a guy named isaac for the sole purpose of fully feeling this song

**Roxieloxie** (10): this feels like the time /u/rickikardashian and /u/akanewasright held me hostage and forced me to watch the grammys performance of roman holiday. I truly have no idea whats going on here, indieheads what the absolute goddamn fuck is this shit. Im giving it a ten but what the fuck dont do this shit again

**sandyfishnets** (10): I've never heard of this band before but god damn so much emotion

**sarcasticsobs** (10): popheads and a 9 minute song? lol. unless‚Ä¶?

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i dont actually like song that feel like dialogues but this is weirdly good. i can already see this song getting robbed

**useless-sheep** (10): i was not expecting to like this but huh

**waluigiest** (10): inject this saxophone into my veins. And then the dissonant guitar bits. Honestly it‚Äôs a major vibe.

**wavingwolves** (10): the correct way to listen to this song is screaming it with the singer at 3am. or being bri ish

**AHSWeeknd** (9): ‚ÄúLeave Kanye out of this‚Äù ‚ÄúShe sells chemtrails‚Äù did Lana Del Rey write this??

**bigbigbee** (9): My friend called this a ‚Äúeuphoric mental breakdown‚Äù and I agree. I find the manic, almost joyous energy of the final spoken section of this song infectious and lowkey inspiring. There‚Äôs something great about the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm invincible in these sunglasses‚Äù. This song makes me feel great (albeit slightly unhinged). I AM more than adequate! I am invincible! I think what I‚Äôm saying is, listening to this song is the closest I‚Äôve gotten to the feeling I had when I saw Destiel became canon on election night.

**celladonn** (9): ...some points were made!

**hepmeucsb** (9): What a fascinating song. It gets a high score not necessarily because I want to listen to it on repeat, but because it felt genuinely fresh and imaginative.

**SideBTrack8** (9): I wonder how many 0s this is gonna get

**ThaCoolness** (9): That was very deranged and I loved it

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): I think that I like this song? Not something I would normally listen to but the lyrics are really solid (reminds me of my favorite LC songs) and it makes me feel like I'm having a breakdown which I think is the point

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): oh my god these lyrics are everything, if a pop girlie released these, we would ALL be obsessed

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.7): Although I can be skeptical of prog, this is saved by the groove, lyrical content, build, and emotional climax. I don‚Äôt know how often I‚Äôll listen to it again outside of the context of this rate because the build is maybe a bit too slow and a bit too prog for me so it‚Äôs not a perfect 10 but on the other hand the payoff is worth it.

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): You know how tik tok adds ‚Äú-core‚Äù to random looks? This has big nerd-core vibes.

**Flipping\_Whales** (8.5): fuck me like you mean it this time, isaac

**seanderlust** (8.5): this gives me john oliver having a mental breakdown teas

**ashandimlotion** (8): my guess for last place but I like it quite a lot!!! Well Bri‚Äôish that mate!

**BBthebest22** (8): I totally see why someone would hate this but I love it

**Gonza\_90** (8): It's pretty fun despite being too long.

**jasannn** (8): LEAVE KANYE OUT OF THIS! (This is the weirdest song here by far)

**pig-serpent** (8): Overall I find this band kind of a worse Daugthers but the instrumental one this one is real good so this is one of their finer songs. That said I like the first half more than I like the 2nd half, which isn't a great thing for me to say about a song like this.

**ReallyCreative** (8): I went back and forth on this one, I love the opening part, and am slightly less enthused but still interested by the turns, and am just fascinated by the way this song moves in general. However, it's ultimately not that pleasant to listen to, especially the vocals. Still impressive though.

**targetguest** (8): polarizing, hated the "wElcOMe to mY KitCHen" voice in the beginning, like the screaming, like the speaking, hate the length

**whizzer0** (8): okay I understand the hype about them now although I'm not 100% sold

**jajarepelotud0** (7.8): I feel like I'm not intelligent enough to fully understand it, but it did give a gratifying sense of superiority over people who haven't heard this song

**insertusernameheree** (7.7): not used to a 9 minute song but I'm here for it

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): oh my god there's actually things going on in this song????

**runaway3212** (7.5): this is sad, but horny. relatable.

**Stryxen** (7.4): it‚Äôs just bonkers

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): Does he think speaking the lyrics makes him sound more profound

**babygrillx** (7): idk what just happened but i didn‚Äôt hate it

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7): This is dopesmoker 2

**shhhneak** (6.9): is this hyperpop?

**zagreux** (6.9): The instrumental/production is a 11. The vocals deserve a 0. So I'm giving this a (11+0/2)=6.9 (don't blame me if the math doesn't math, I'm gay)

**notdallin** (6.7): how does a song that has such perfect lines like ‚Äúand i am so ignorant now with all that i have learnt‚Äù and ‚Äúi am invincible in these sunglasses‚Äù have such a pretentious demeanor and laughably horrendous saxophone improvisation?

**azurepatrocleia** (6.5): that horns section tho

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): the instrumental is super nice but this feels like a spoken word piece and I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about that

**txrxwxwx** (6.5): I'm scared... maybe I'm took gay for this song

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): send help im scared

**buddhacharm** (6): I know that the BCNR hype is like‚Ä¶huge rn but I prefer the groveling indie rock Brit tendencies of King Krule‚Ä¶sue me!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no one was bringing kanye into this why did you bring kanye into this

**jsonphile** (6): okay there‚Äôs really no reason this song has to be 8 minutes long

**just\_thonking** (6): Honestly I was really digging the beginning instrumentals and then it kind of went downhill from there. Some of the lyrics are funny though

**proscett** (6): so that was cool, but i dont think i wanna listen again

**steamedasparagus** (6): this is what my brain sounded like every time I went outside in college

**TiltControls** (6): This score is actually a 10 for the first parts, a 3 for the breakdown, and then an 6ish for everything else.

**wryn\_** (6): got made fun of on rateyourmusic for saying that this was straight people music once

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I didn't like the chaotic part in the middle but otherwise this is‚Ä¶ okay

**bookthieving** (5): tbh i enjoyed listening to this for this rate and i will enjoy not listening to this ever again

**gwenflip** (5): This song actually grew on me as I kept going? But at the same time I‚Äôm very confused

**hikkaru** (5): i'm honestly intrigued and may have to ironically stan but also it's a bit shit

**jayjaysortagay** (5): sorry maybe I'm basic but why do people choose to listen to songs that sound like mental breakdowns? I couldn't make it all the way through this bc I was so anxious

**nootnoot781** (5): this just isn‚Äôt my cup of tea in the slightest, it just reminds me of the monologues the straight guys did in drama class. production‚Äôs v nice though!!

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I just came here for a music rate not a full-length Broadway performance

**skargardin** (5): I really can't make up my mind on this whether i love it or absolutely hate it so here's a middle of the scale score

**TheEvilNightman** (5): I appreciate what it's trying to do, but uh, I don't think I'm a post-rock guy.

**jman457** (4.7): I can appreciate the jazz influence in this, but it was hard to sit for the entire 9 minute song

**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): screaming about your problems into a microphone is not a substitute for therapy

**officialged** (4.1): OK, what a trip. It's too experimental/out there for me, I get too unsettled by listening to it. Feels like I'm listening someone working their way through a trauma. But there's smth alluring there as well. I liked the sax there, such an interesting combo. But I don't know when I would willlingly put it on...

**E3-NotTheConvention** (4): It got my attention with that unexpected sax but lost it again with that messy spoken part. It was a whole rollercoaster full of things I both despised and liked. It kinda fucked me up a little bit but at least it was a memorable experience? idk

**ManofOranges** (4): I'm so confused right now!! What is going on???

**veryanniev** (4): This song is wild and certainly memorable. Would I listen to it on purpose? I don't think so.

**Zi99yStardust** (4): I really enjoyed parts of this song, especially the guitar & spoken word delivery but sometimes it just became a mess of noise - this is the kind of 'experimental' song people pretend to like

**nice-cat** (3.5): the 4 min version is more like a 6 for me, but this one is just too long. I have things to do!

**booksandplantsand** (3): sir this is a Wendy's. but it does get better halfway through i guess

**pat-rickstar** (3): ‚Ä¶ I liked it until he started talking/singing. This was my 0 at first but I hate it a little less now for the instrumental parts at least

**rickikardashian** (3): thinking about that indieheads user that said that the list of songs we sent to them was not accessible, unlike the one they sent us

**gileswithachainsaw** (2.8): I had heard this band called Slint worship, but I was prepared to believe that was an exaggeration‚Ä¶ I don't know about the rest of their stuff but this song, at least, actually does sound like Slint, but worse. It's not incompetent, but the repetitive riffs aren't haunting enough, and the poetic imagery isn't evocative enough, to keep my interest for nine minutes. I think I actually hate it.

**Sypher32** (2.5): Nine minutes!? The instrumental is great but the vocals (or maybe the lyrics) grate. Actually my score has to increase cuz it sounds like a good meme

**CritneySpearz** (2): what is dis hunny. I genuinely started laughing when the weird recorder noises started playing in the background lmfaoooooooooo

**hunnybee12** (2): i'm sure whatever he is saying is clever, profound, groundbreaking, something for it to be voted in but it's just agonizing to sit through. it's like nails on a chalkboard to me

**musical\_pyn** (2): If this song started at 4:40 it would be somewhat bearable

**trashypanini** (2): ooh kinda like screamo-lite vocal in the beginning. But it got a bit too frenetic, busy, and pointlessly noisy especially with the sax added. Should‚Äôve stopped at the 3 min mark. And stopped with the ear hurting instrumental theatrics.

**WillamThunderfuck** (2): This is an actively aggravating song which lasts about 8 minutes too long, horrible.

I feel like this will be the first real hit that hurts indieheads feelings but it wont be the last. Gold Soundz is ADORED in certain circles even to the point of Pitchfork calling this the best song of the 90's. There's actually a lot to this that you wouldn't recognize at first glance but its fairly straightforward garage rock sound just left a lot to be desired from popheads.

---

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (11): This is at the same time one of the best pop, rock and indie songs ever. An easily accessible, painstakingly constructed song that has something in it for everyone from every market, ranging from a madly catchy melody to a moody guitar break. And all that packed within just 2:39! Unfortunately, it's a song that only starts to show its brilliance after you've listened to it a few times. So, I will prepare myself for gays scoring this badly and deeming it forgettable.

**bbfan132** (10): ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre empty, and i‚Äôm empty‚Äù lmfao‚Ä¶. still a 10

**bespectacIed** (10): Eww yes I listened to this when i was an impressionable sophomore because pitchfork said it was the best song of the 90s and naturally, pavement become one of my "essential" college bands that make me nostalgic for a time period that's almost familiar to me but I never actually lived

**EnCaine** (10): cret cret cret cret cret cret back right now

**proscett** (10): This better go top 10, that's all imma say

**TheEvilNightman** (9.3): This is the type of song that you really need a Genius sheet in order to appreciate it (aka 90% of these songs), but when you read it alongside the track, man...

**ggal2020** (9): Stephen Malkmus marry me please

**musical\_pyn** (9): surprisingly very solid, I really liked this

**zagreux** (9): the lead singer's voice is so hot omg

**Vike\_Me** (8.8): Singer doesn't seem to be a "good singer". Singer's voice is a wonderful instrument on this track. Why do I feel like there were heated discussions on this subject at my college back in the 90s?

**Stryxen** (8.6): i can already smell someone in the reveal chat saying it‚Äôs good BECAUSE the vocals are bad (and they‚Äôre right)

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): something charming about this one

**2dina3dworld** (8): It was brief, fleeting, but for a moment, it was beautiful

**frogaranaman** (8): I'll admit, I'm not too familiar with Pavement. BUT, I can't hate on a good song when I hear one!!

**gileswithachainsaw** (8): Good song, but it makes me want to listen to other, better Pavement songs.

**jman457** (7.8): objectivly they arent the best, but during the pandemic my brother and I really got into Pavement

**azurepatrocleia** (7.5): yay for summer vibes

**insertusernameheree** (7.5): whiney but in a good way? if that makes sense

**just\_thonking** (7.5): She's kind of short

**nice-cat** (7.5): I love it whenever a song calls attention to the fact that the chorus is coming up

**plastichaxan** (7.5): too short

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): cute

**Zi99yStardust** (7.5): Very well done 90s rock with enough variation to stay interesting but at its core basic done very well

**Kardif** (7.3): bit boring, okay

steelstepladder: **babygrillx** (7): nice

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this has All-American Rejects energy. I will not elaborate.

**hepmeucsb** (7): Hearing ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù triggered something in me.

**runaway3212** (7): this is also bland but at least it's short

**seanderlust** (7): se cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret crecrecrecrccrcrcrc- DIRTY BIT

**steamedasparagus** (7): pitchfork had the entire 90s and they picked this?

**ThaCoolness** (7): Apparently Pitchfork voted this as best song of the 90s. Sure. Yeah.

**whizzer0** (7): they've got the indie voice again... in fact there's not really anything special about this, but it's a solid track

**bigbigbee** (6.5): My completely uneducated guess is that this won‚Äôt do that well on popheads, not because it‚Äôs overly indie, but because it actually quite reminds me of a type of pop that popheads doesn‚Äôt like that much ‚Äì that ‚Äúmen with guitars‚Äù radio alt-pop that was prevalent in the mid 2000s (e.g. Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol, the ‚ÄúIf I lay here‚Äù song). I don‚Äôt dislike this but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd seek this out.

**celladonn** (6.5): This was pitchfork's number 1 song of the 90s and I don't really get the hype

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): oh look another guy who can barely sing

**jajarepelotud0** (6.5): Eh, I'm not feeling particularly anything strong about this one

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Neat fine‚Ñ¢ vibe with this one.

**trashypanini** (6.5): charming and weirdly endearing. But I liked the vocals. Ended abruptly though. Like there was no gradual fade.

**notdallin** (6.1): did somebody edit the genius page by accident? the song annotations say that this was pitchfork‚Äôs best song of the 1990s

**AHSWeeknd** (6): It‚Äôs fairly interesting

**camerinian** (6): I think I‚Äôm getting ‚ÄúSeinfeld is Unfunny‚Äù‚Äôd by this band

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I don't remember this.

**Flipping\_Whales** (6): vocals really bring it down

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I can't muster up any feelings

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): I liked that it was short

**Sypher32** (6): digging it, I think

**vayyiqra** (6): this is okay

**wryn\_** (6): at least i can now say i know who stephen malkmus is

**1998tweety** (5.5): well

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): slanted & enchanted outsold

**wavingwolves** (5.5): i feel repulsed by the word quarantine now (and the song itself is only... okay)

**bulforster** (5.2): This feels like it's in a rush to be over, I think the only song here that would have benefitted from being longer.

**officialged** (5.2): Another one that's somewhat boring and directionless to me. Didn't really enjoy the guy's vocal delivery. Although I do like the interesting time signature.

**Arybeck67** (5): I‚Äôm so happy this is so short because I‚Äôm so bored.

**booksandplantsand** (5): sad man music

**ManofOranges** (5): Forgettable, honestly.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): 24kGold Soundz & Iann Diorr - Mood

**txrxwxwx** (5): feels like generic indie sadboi shit

**Vromega** (5): No no no these high notes are so bad :sob: but the instrumentals are fine I guess

**fadedblue09** (4.5): The instrumental parts make this bearable

**LesApfels** (4.5): Secret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret

**ashandimlotion** (4): not my thing

**esskeetitli** (4): Forgettable.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): cute instrumentation but meh everything else

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): kinda a snooze

**targetguest** (4): kinda sounds like a bad american idol audition from 2005 but like i also get it

And here we have another song that was bitten because of it's length. Seven and a half minutes was a LOT for popheads to take, especially once one person said "this sounds like a ringtone" that was all anyone could really hear. Something like Helicopter would have definitely gone over a bit better with the popheads crowd but He Would Have Laughed really struggled with picking up a group of passionate defenders landing it a bottom five spot.

---

**Pam\_Beesly157** (11): a RELIGIOUS experience

**bbfan132** (10): totally gorgeous.. that outro is stunning

**bespectacIed** (10): This is so stunning my god i had to listen to halcyon digest again while doing this rate. As deerhunter themselves once said, turn it up, f--homosexual

**Zi99yStardust** (10): The glistening synth that sits as the centerpiece of the song throughout so expertly manages to pull all the elements around it cohesivly together even when parts of the song sound so disparate in isolation from one another; it's really quite magical.

**TiltControls** (9.7): long, but good

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Love the lush instrumentation on this, though it admittedly goes around in circles after a while.

**Arybeck67** (9.3): the production on this song is superb and really adds to the ‚Äújust-off‚Äù vibe of it. The lyrics are full of contradictions, like someone growing up and cringing at their past selves. The ending of the song is also immaculate. An epic of contradictions!

**1998tweety** (9): this is nice

**AGM301** (9): i love it

**akanewasright** (9): This was just lovely

**musical\_pyn** (9): I was gonna make a comment about this being too long but honestly? It deserves the length, uses it well

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): love the singer's voice

**zagreux** (9): "where did my friends go" relatable king <3

**notdallin** (8.7): i love how this song‚Äôs waves of psychedelic guitar plucks and strums just gently rock me out to sea into increasingly troubling waters with distorted vocals warbling out to me from further and further away

**Vike\_Me** (8.7): Super chill with a nice vibe.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i really like this

**ThaCoolness** (8.5): really lovely song

**txrxwxwx** (8.5): feels like floating

**jman457** (8.2): also not good memories associated with it, but I like this song more

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): this song does not sound like its 7 and half minutes long

**bigbigbee** (8): I think this song is SO pretty. It‚Äôs helped by how strong that phrase that repeats through the song is (those opening notes). Also, like sunglasses, this song feels like it‚Äôs really doing something with its long runtime.

**ExtraEater** (8): Bizarre to pick this song when Desire Lines and Helicopter are much more Pop-friendly but it's good regardless

**frogaranaman** (8): Not my favorite Deerhunter song but I do understand the choice.

**ManofOranges** (8): What would've happened if I told my crush that I was into him

**proscett** (8): stan bradford cox

**rickikardashian** (8): this doesn't feel like 7 minutes

**SmileAndTears** (8): Kinda weird but I like it

**EnCaine** (7.5): I've never been a huge deerhunter fan, but it's a perfectly nice song

**fkadizzy-1804** (7.5): There‚Äôs the bones of a truly brilliant song in here, but as is I think some of the production choices and vocal stylings are working against it. Like some of the production is amazing, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I‚Äôd like to hear an unplugged version for comparison tbh.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the instrumental track is great. And things really pick up after the second verse

**Stryxen** (7.2): he would have been like ‚ÄúI have to laugh-‚Äù

steelstepladder: **babygrillx** (7): pretty nice

**Flegasaurus** (7): WHICH RINGTONE DOES THIS SOUND LIKE üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ its alright

**hepmeucsb** (7): I liked the synths (or whatever that was), but it overstayed its welcome in my opinion.

**izeasklapaucius** (7): main riff is giving me sony ericsson ringtone

**kappyko** (7): RIP PRINCESS DIANA

**officialged** (7): Too long, and the melodical solutions seem not as inspired. But I like the choice of instrumentation, really brings you into a different world. Enjoyed the slowed down part too.

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's cool, it's good, it could be 3 and a half minutes

**whizzer0** (7): I don't think I'm old enough to appreciate this

**gwenflip** (6.8): Why are all these songs so fucking long

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): the instrumental in the first half of the song is really annoying, the last 3 minutes of the song are amazing though

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): tidus.gif

**steamedasparagus** (6.5): no helicopter? no earthquake? no memory boy? ok

**trashypanini** (6.5): the production is just so dreamy and also inspires contemplation. The sluggish vocal got a bit annoying and overall the song meanders a lot.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This would play in a campfire setting of an indie film about getting over the death of a hamster.

**camerinian** (6): that opening ringtone-ass noise over the first half is quite grating, but at least it resolved nicely

**CrimsonROSET** (6): maybe the reason you‚Äôre bored so often is because you‚Äôre making music like this

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Should have been a lot shorter.

**engifear** (6): This is alright, but I don‚Äôt think I would ever choose to listen to this myself.

**Flipping\_Whales** (6): this song promotes c*pitalism

**jayjaysortagay** (6): üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥/5 but partly in a good way

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): And I have to laugh-

**runaway3212** (6): too long and ringtone music but fun

**vayyiqra** (6): Again, nothing against long songs, but I am not sure why Indieheads sent us so many of them. I like them, but most of us don't, or at least aren't used to them. This one is alright though.

**Vromega** (6): the background instrumentals are very repetitive and tend to make this song boring but succeed to create a sweet and pleasing atmosphere. I found the second part much less interesting

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): It's ok but it's too long for how little is happening

**gileswithachainsaw** (5.9): Okay, but a bit too long for what it is. It doesn't feel like it starts going anywhere until 4 minutes in, and even then, it sometimes lingers too long on the same ideas.

**2dina3dworld** (5): forgettable

**ashandimlotion** (5): well as Jessie J once said Who‚Äôs Laughing Now

**jajarepelotud0** (5): "Only bored as I get older" yeah same dude

**nt96** (5): Perhaps He laughed, but I sure didn't.

**seanderlust** (5): "I lived on a farm/i never lived on a farm" the duality of man

**TheEvilNightman** (5): There's a few interesting ideas here, but tbh, this is the only track here I can confidently call "pretentious".

**CritneySpearz** (4.5): I fell asleep, sry

**Gonza\_90** (4): Yawn

**Kardif** (4): im bored

**moooo566** (4): someone in the listening party said this sounded like a ringtone and now i can't hear anything else. also i don't really like the vocals.

**timothy444** (4): Why is it so long?

**waluigiest** (4): is this good or is it just long?

**booksandplantsand** (3): if a song is gonna be this long it needs to earn it :(

**jasannn** (3): This song is so unmemorable.

**wavingwolves** (3): i ruined this song for a bunch of people after i said it sounds like a ringtone. i guess it was deserved since it does sound like that and i can't pay attention to anything else

**Sypher32** (2.5): Actually sounds nice enough, but 7 minutes is longer than I want to spend listening to something I'm not excited by

**bulforster** (1): I get bored as I get older listening to this unbearably long snoozefest.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): all my friends from high school were either weirdos on 4chan or racist lgbts and I have not spoken to either group in 5 years and I can‚Äôt relate. This song is also bad.

**lagozzino** (0): Incredible how a song can stretch to 7 minutes without having a single remarkable moment in it

**pig-serpent** (0): The Dear Hunter outsold (oh my God this song just keeps going on)

Tadevos: Hi I suggested "He Would Have Laughed" in the hope that y'all would appreciate it for the slow-burning gem it is, after I got burned hilariously badly in the r/indieheads Neo-Psych Rate, which I (and two of my favorite indieheads) partook in for the express purpose of giving it elevens.  Anyway it went out at like number four and Deerhunter got fuckin' sniped in the rate overall by Spiritualized for some reason.  I knew this song wouldn't make Day 2 but I was hoping it would make the twenties, at least.

Goddamnit now *two* of Reddit's premier music communities have decided that "Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space" is a better song than "He Would Have Laughed" I am dead and in hell

[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt6hsoz/]

=====

Tadevos: * for an even bigger scope and/or feel, Do Make Say Think's "As Far As The Eye Can See."  It has, uh, no hooks, or even any words, but it's still one of my favorite guitar songs of the past decade.
* Grizzly Bear's "On A Neck, On A Spit" is similar inasmuch as it also has slow and fast sections.
* Lightning Bug's "Garden Path Song" has a similar guitar chime, though it's more upfront hazy than "He Would Have Laughed," I think.  The Deerhunter influence is pretty strong with those guys.
* Braids, "Little Hand."  I think these guys actually toured with Deerhunter back in the day.
* Volcano Choir's "Comrade," one of my favorite songs, is similarly rich with melodic detail in a similar sort of way, but it also has a massive chorus, which ought to be worth something to such discerning listeners as y'all.

Hopefully one or more of these sticks, I dunno, I'm glad we can bond over our differences in this rate
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt6oshn/]

=====

Pam_Beesly157: So I checked them all out, and I liked all of them. Comrade, As Far As the Eye Can See, and On A Neck, On A Spit were the standouts. Little Hand was a slow burn, but worth it. Garden Path Song gives me the same feeling as Blue Bell - Golden Daze. 

I especially loved Comrade, probably because it reminds me a bit of Big Red Machine.

Superflumina: Deerhunter is out, finally a song that's truly not very good at all (edit: can't remember much about the Black Midi song though).

One of the five songs not to receive a single 11 is also one of the simpler acoustic songs. It was a major grower for me personally as I I didn't really get it at first but toward the end of the rate I grew to really appreciate the woodsy aesthetic it was going for and really was able to vibe with the main riff. There's a lot to like here but to a lot of raters it was either too standard or too weird with the distorted outro.

---

**bbfan132** (10): gorgeous song, love phil‚Äôs voice here

**cremeebrulee** (10): i fucking love this holy shit

**Flegasaurus** (10): please stream the glow pt 2 it's amazing you have to or else

**frogaranaman** (10): Now THIS is what I like to call: depression.

**skargardin** (10): this hit me

**zagreux** (10): This has such a nice understated folk vibe. I usually don't like traditional male voices but this guy's voice is really soothing.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): wait...this is kinda hitting rn

**Stryxen** (9.5): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeh

**gileswithachainsaw** (9.1): Love this album and band, but I do feel like the songs don't hit the same in isolation from the full album. Still great.

**fadedblue09** (9): Very simple and subtle yet I feel a wave of emotions here

**ggal2020** (9): God this is a quarantine mood

**proscett** (9): phil snapped on this one, probably my fav song of his

**ThaCoolness** (9): this was a very pleasant experience

**Vromega** (9): I want this song to hug me in a hut in the middle of a storm

**whizzer0** (9): there's a lot of guitar in this rate but it's nice to hear all the different things you can do with the guitar

**notdallin** (8.8): That completely overblown circular refrain is so cathartic, like bunch of early 2000s hipsters doing an uncontrollable raindance around a bonfire, wishing to feel something‚Äîanything‚Äîeven for wind to blow

**officialged** (8.7): I liked it so so much. The sounds, so vivid, and homemade, feels like I'm in a forest camp during night, an awesome feeling. The song got a little too overbearing in the end though.

**1998tweety** (8.5): nice background music

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): I love u Phil

**moonagenightmares** (8.2): this is probably gonna go out early

**babygrillx** (8): the second half was great

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's very pleasant and uneventful

**Kardif** (7.8): like the twang and the shifting balance, vocals are only fine

**akanewasright** (7.5): This one has grown on me a lot, actually. Kinda wish the ending wasn‚Äôt... that, though

**Gonza\_90** (7.5): I like The Moon more

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): normally not a fan of these type of songs but the stripped back nature of it is a perfect fit. Won‚Äôt come back to this ever though

**Iris3271** (7.5): Too long but it gave me ASMR

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): ok the ending hit just right

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): I love the lumineers

**jman457** (7.1): part of me likes it, part of me feels like they are weird for weirds sake and that annoys me

steelstepladder: **BBthebest22** (7): It sounded nice but it could‚Äôve been shorter tbh

**hepmeucsb** (7): Good, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily stand out.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): dude the wind does blow, that‚Äôs like it‚Äôs only job

**insertusernameheree** (7): idk

**jajarepelotud0** (7): The lyrics are great, but I feel it needs something more production-wise

**jasannn** (7): Ok but that outro actually slaps.

**SmileAndTears** (7): it's ok but a bit on the boring side

**vayyiqra** (7): If I may use Popheads' favourite word and one of my least favourites when talking about music - this is generic, meaning "typical of this genre", as in "this sounds like the same kind of indie stuff I've heard a million times before. It's also fairly good, because generic doesn't mean bad (repeat this to yourselves as often as you need to besties).

**shhhneak** (6.7): now who decided to play with a Bop It in the background?

**camerinian** (6.5): points for at least being interesting, and I liked the core guitar melody, but I don't think this is for me tbh

**just\_thonking** (6.5): I liked the buildup until I didn't

**musical\_pyn** (6.5): good song but the ending doesn‚Äôt really work imo

**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): I want this song to go

**runaway3212** (6.5): It gets better everytime I hear it

**ashandimlotion** (6): I can‚Äôt say that I do bro!!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): anyways here‚Äôs wonderwall but the file is corrupted

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): I finished reading the lyrics before the vocals kicked in and thought to myself this was probably going to be a 10; unfortunately the actual music ended up being insubstantial and limp, relying too much on unfriendly, unnecessary ‚Äúlook at what interesting music we‚Äôre making‚Äù gimmicks, and the potential of the song was lost. The stretch from ~2:30-4:30 was lovely though.

**jsonphile** (6): wow they found one nice guitar riff let‚Äôs play it a million times over and over again

**txrxwxwx** (6): kinda boring but I could see it being a before-bed kinda song

**wryn\_** (6): anyone else think that drum towards the end is kind of too loud?? lol!!

**rickikardashian** (5.5): having a noisy, loud outro won't make your song anymore interesting

**azurepatrocleia** (5): yawn

**booksandplantsand** (5): not bad, but not great, i guess?

**jayjaysortagay** (5): I don't have the attention span for these cute but insubstantial ones and I feel bad about it :(

**CritneySpearz** (4.5): fuk this abrupt ending lmao

**Sypher32** (4.5): ok but long

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Oh fuck off, I was enjoying this up until the outro. Literally who asked for this???

**esskeetitli** (4): Why does the lead singer of a band called "The Microphones" have such a quiet voice? I couldn't make out anything he said. It all just sounded like wind blowing, but very quietly.

**pig-serpent** (4): I've heard a few songs from this album and this isn't at all what I remember it sounding like. That being said, I still don't particularly like it.

**wavingwolves** (4): doesn't really do anything for me

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (4): ; girl, idk

**Zi99yStardust** (4): This has some nice elements but the vocals here are really grating

**2dina3dworld** (3): after about 3 minutes it actually started to sound good

**NotWith10000Men** (3): no

**rslashpoopheads** (3): this song blows

**AHSWeeknd** (2): A modern day knight would enjoy this

**trashypanini** (2): The vocals were dull & lifeless and the production tried to inspire some camp fire hill song character but it failed. And the thumping plus other instruments in the end was assailing on the ears.

**bespectacIed** (1): this is horrible wtf

**timothy444** (1): this is so boring lmao

The first shoegaze casualty of the day. For those of you asking, yes the song is supposed to sound like that.

---

**BBthebest22** (11): Without a doubt in my top 20 songs ever, This song just takes me to another place, that guitar riff might be one of my favorite moment in any song ever

**Iris3271** (11): Makes me feel like I'm sixteen and in love again

**nootnoot781** (11): as much i didn‚Äôt want to give this my 11 for not being on spotify ü§¨, i just had to give in anyway. this is one of the best songs i have and will ever listen to. surreal piece of music.

**2dina3dworld** (10): This probably would be a straight up 11 if I was in a situation befitting of this song, but unfortunately, my life is a little too boring for this to hit that right spot.

**babygrillx** (10): vacuum cleaners never sounded so beautiful

**bbfan132** (10): :poohascend:

**chilipeepers** (10): , Kevin Shields I Love You!!!!!!

**EnCaine** (10): I think listening to this album at a young age made me sexually attracted to vacuums

**Flegasaurus** (10): shoegaze more like poo gays üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇahahaha i'm so funny üòÇüòÇ but seriously loveless is an iconic album full of tens and i love this song

**ggal2020** (10): I literally used to listen to this album to fall asleep every night. It works better than asmr.

**moonagenightmares** (10): I loved this song so I checked out the album and loved that too thank you indieheads

**wavingwolves** (10): i love the way this was recorded inside of a washing machine

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): bop

**notdallin** (9.3): it ain‚Äôt proper shoegaze until you‚Äôre simultaneously drowning in fuzz and nostalgia

**Stryxen** (9.2): oh i know this song!

**frogaranaman** (9): The flute-synth whatever that is in this song? Too good to be true.

**Gonza\_90** (9): Why is MBV not on Spotify? :woeis:

**jajarepelotud0** (9): I need this on Spotify

**proscett** (9): a classic yup!

**trashypanini** (9): loveless is essential shoegaze lover listening. Noisy and dark with a bit of the faraway dreaminess that captures a daydreaming mind.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): I wish we were rating Only Shallow but the whole album is solid

**camerinian** (8): This is great but like it‚Äôs a 10 as part of Loveless. Loveless is a stellar album. Just please listen to it in its entirety if you weren‚Äôt so hot on this, I think it will change your mind in some capacity

**Flipping\_Whales** (8): kinda shit mixing, but really like the wall of sound

**Kardif** (8): lofi? Can't really make out any lyrics, nice sound

**skargardin** (8): this slaps

**Turpamutteri** (8): I wish this was on Spotify

**useless-sheep** (8): maybe i am a shoe gay

**Zi99yStardust** (8): I never knew I liked 'shoegaze' but I am really feeling this - shame it is not on streaming!

**jman457** (7.9): if downatthemeninmusicbusinessconfrence was a whole band

**rickikardashian** (7.8): don't be shy, make the vocals louder

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The outro sounds really familiar for some reason?

**steamedasparagus** (7.5): I‚Äôve tried to listen to this album like 4 times

**zagreux** (7.5): I liked the shoegaze-grunge rock vibe this had

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.2): Not the biggest fan of the shoegaze sound but I like the instrumentals here.

steelstepladder: **ashandimlotion** (7): I do be sort of gazing at my shoes...

**ColdSore2020** (7): Slowdive > MBV

**hepmeucsb** (7): I probably would have scored this higher if I could understand even a single lyric, but I did really like the overall vibes.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): kind of fillery in this rate

**ReallyCreative** (7): it was good but honestly not memorable

**officialged** (6.9): I love a few other My Bloody Valentine songs. This one is not quite up there just because of the weaker vocal melodies. But THAT guitar riff is soo good

**1998tweety** (6.5): this feels like a nonevent but it's not bad

**nice-cat** (6.5): I think this is another case of like, just because a band are the first ones to do something, that doesn‚Äôt always make it good? But I do think it works better in the context of the album.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): I really like the melodies and chord progressions here, but it's way too faded and fuzzy for me to actually aappreciate any of it, it's just some pleasant noise (the lyrics are basically indechiperable)

**akanewasright** (6): This will get tanked for the mixing. Shoegaze isn‚Äôt for me at all, and this just sounds so

**Arybeck67** (6): I like the production but I‚Äôve never been a fan of vocals in the background unless its ambient music like Grouper. So ya, that‚Äôs why this is a 6.

**celladonn** (6): Help i can't stop gazing at my shoes

**ImADudeDuh** (6): are the lyrics bad so you‚Äôre trying to hide them by making us unable to hear them? (for anyone who thinks im serious, I did this rate with the lyrics of all these songs, im just dragging the song‚Äôs production)

**musical\_pyn** (6): the riff is pretty great but not much else is

**seanderlust** (6): under communism it would be our bloody valentine :)

**vayyiqra** (6): The 1975 are better

**wryn\_** (6): ok half my comments for these songs have just been saying other songs by the artists are better but seriously only shallow is just >>>>>>>>>

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): shoe when it's being gazed upon idk i don't listen to the genre

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Yeah, shoegaze isn't my thing.

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): I literally can not tell what he is saying

**pig-serpent** (5): Why does this song have a goofy-ass recorder in it? It's okay, should've submitted Only Shallow instead.

**Vromega** (5): this just sounds like noise. Not bad actually, but it really doesn't make me feel anything

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): God, shoegaze is absolutely not for me.

**Sypher32** (4.5): I can't really hear the words...

**booksandplantsand** (4): too indistinct for me to really enjoy

**fadedblue09** (4): Not sure whether listening to Youtube affected the audio quality, but I did not enjoy this at all rip. Maybe shoegaze isn't my thing I guess.

**hikkaru** (4): so quiet erm

**jasannn** (4): yay more guitars...

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): are the vocals supposed to be buried in the mix? dislike

**E3-NotTheConvention** (3): The song by itself isn't bad, but I just can't stand this kind of mixing/producing style. The noise is way too distractive

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): i don‚Äôt know what the fuck she‚Äôs saying and girl i am not living

**NotWith10000Men** (3): I was jamming until the vocals came in. they are waaaaaay too muted

**rslashpoopheads** (3): why are these all starting to sound the same

**sirpancakeXI** (3): this is not my cup of tea

**targetguest** (3): did this song have lyrics?

**txrxwxwx** (3): maybe I need to get my ears checked but I couldn't hear a single lyric

**runaway3212** (2): boring

**AHSWeeknd** (1): What are they saying?? Turn your mic up omg

**fkadizzy-1804** (1): There has to be something really special for me to vibe with music that tries to sound badly-made on purpose and this song doesn‚Äôt have it. It just left me annoyed and bored.

**moooo566** (1): this sounds like it was recorded on noughties era mobile phone from the other side of the door to the recording studio, and not in like a cool lo-fi way

**CrimsonROSET** (0): is it that hard to put your vocal higher on the mix so i actually understand what the fuck you‚Äôre saying or was making my eardrums explode with the same rift six times necessary to the listening experience

**insertusernameheree** (0): really not for me

**timothy444** (0): There are two reasons why I'm giving this my zero. One of them is because I can't play it on Spotify. The other is because the song is terrible. Okay, maybe this deserves a 2 but since I can't scrobble it on my last.fm and I had to listen to it on peasant YouTube, I'm going to be real petty here and give it my zero. Now, when are we gonna rate Permission by Ava Max & Flo Rida?

**fkadizzy-1804** (11): I don‚Äôt really know what to say about this song or to how explain why it reached into my brain and grabbed me by the fucking amygdala. It‚Äôs not the little flourishes like the way she sings "hunger", it‚Äôs not the perfectly constructed grunge vibe, it‚Äôs not the epic solo/instrumental outro, it‚Äôs not the way I feel like I understand exactly what she‚Äôs saying even though it‚Äôs all about what she‚Äôs not saying, it‚Äôs just. Idk. This one just does it for me.

**ThaCoolness** (11): One of my favorite indie songs ever. Extremely powerful lyrics and instrumental

**Arybeck67** (10): if a certain Sufjan song wasn‚Äôt in this rate, this would‚Äôve been my instant 11. This song...what can I say of true substance to fully encapsulate the feelings it brings out in me? In the purest sense, it is emotion. It is a search for an explanation. It is devastation. It is rage. It is pain. It is a song without real resolution because one cannot simply be found. Adrianne knows what this is not, but not what it is, and maybe she never will be able to find that meaning. The song to me is perfect and Adrianne Lenker, beyond a doubt, is one of the best songwriters currently alive.

**bbfan132** (10): adrianne‚Äôs vocals along with that noisy outro make this song perfect

**ExtraEater** (10): One of the greatest rock songs of the '10s onward

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): yesssssss

**frogaranaman** (10): All six minutes of this song are fucking iconic, oh my god.

**ggal2020** (10): Big Thief is my favorite band. Adrianne Lenker inspired me to shave my head. If the song that made me love indie rock (Bodys) weren‚Äôt on here this‚Äôd be my 11.

**moonagenightmares** (10): amazing choice from the submitted big thief songs, an 11 contender if mgmt wasn‚Äôt in the rate

**morgchrist** (10): but give me Adrianne‚Äôs last two solo albums over the 2019 Big Thief albums any day

**Rhea\_33** (10): This would get my 11 if Maps wasn't on here.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): ok this is not what i would have expect when i heard the name big thief and the intro of the song, but im loving this surprise

**skargardin** (10): the guitar solo took this from a nine to a ten

**Stryxen** (10): not her being goofy i-

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): love the songwriting

**wavingwolves** (10): i feel like i will get do mad seeing this go out

**Zi99yStardust** (10): adrianne lenker's voice just drips with emotion here and that guitar solo, hugely impressive; in short incredible!

**akanewasright** (9.5): I made fun of this song for a few days before realizing that I really like it

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): okay this slaps...not a 10 because it only gets really good after the first half

**zagreux** (9.5): I love her voice. also the riffs here fucking slap.

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): I love this but I am not huge on the improv-esque guitar stuff on the back end, it leans more sloppy than interesting at points, everything else is gold though

**1998tweety** (9): love the bit at the end

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): it‚Äôs the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the‚Äù for me

**babygrillx** (9): wow that guitar solo was nice

**gileswithachainsaw** (9): Great song, quality lyrics. I really need to listen to more of their stuff. I only really know Masterpiece.

**proscett** (9): didn't they record this in one go? this is legendary

**sarcasticsobs** (9): thank god, it‚Äôs the superior 2019 big thief record

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Not bad! Wait, I mean Not good! Or rather -- oh you know what I mean

**targetguest** (8.5): i HATED this song the first time I listened to it

**moooo566** (8): some good guitars on this

**pat-rickstar** (8): So what is it then

**steamedasparagus** (8): shoulders would have been a 10

**txrxwxwx** (8): love a female-fronted band thank u

**waluigiest** (8): this big guitar solo is hot

**whizzer0** (8): I kinda thought I'd like Big Thief more

**notdallin** (7.9): so we basically have to listen to like 10 extra minutes of indie noise because they had a rule that ‚ÄúSongs will only make the list if they are under *8* minutes‚Äù??? don‚Äôt they know that our contemporary streaming era has taught us to ignore anything more than 180 seconds?

**jman457** (7.6): not reinventing the wheel for indie rock, but really well made. Adrianne has a great voice

**buddhacharm** (7.5): I get that this is one of their most bombastic singles but I think I‚Äôm partial to the whimsy of UFOF on the whole

**Flegasaurus** (7.5): it was a little boring but the 3 minute long guitar solo thing saved it

**jasannn** (7.5): Much angry. Much emo.

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): if it was bad i would say "not this..." but SADLY i enjoyed it so that joke is ruined

steelstepladder: **AHSWeeknd** (7): This is good omg

**CrimsonROSET** (7): why do these songs only get interesting in the last minute like i‚Äôll have my comment written and ready to go then they‚Äôll actually decide to start the song and i have to delete everything and do it again I CAN‚ÄôT KEEP UP WITH THIS

**Kardif** (7): a bit repetitive, I like the bass line, weird soundscape at the end is fun but like 45 seconds too long

**pig-serpent** (7): The first half of this song is pretty mediocre, but the guitar solo on this rips.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7): ; why are son many of these song so long?

**bulforster** (6.8): It's not great, not terrible, not an 11, not a 0

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.8): I liked the long instrumental break, but I don't see myself returning to this track

**rickikardashian** (6.8): ... what is it then

**officialged** (6.7): Intriguiging, the emotion in her voice, the catharsis! I appreciate it.

**jajarepelotud0** (6.5): I literally don't understand anything of the lyrics, but I love the production.

**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): Why does the lead singer sound like she‚Äôs congested?

**runaway3212** (6.5): NOT bad

**seanderlust** (6.5): omg not the crowd not winning :sob::sob: not the planet not spinning :skull::clown:

**trashypanini** (6.5): The vocals were a bit bland. Loved the slight heaviness though. But the repetition in lyrics were boring. And it got a little self indulgent at the end.

**hepmeucsb** (6): The song‚Äôs pretty good overall, but I didn‚Äôt love the guitar solo and docked a point.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this would be better if they could sing better. And if they could have more structure with their jamming session at the end so it‚Äôs not as messy sounding

**musical\_pyn** (6): didn‚Äôt really vibe with this one which is weird, I wanted to really like this

**NotWith10000Men** (6): finally some drums and a guitar but their voice sucks

**Turpamutteri** (6): The singing annoys me sorry. Also, I wish this was a bit shorter

**Vromega** (6): chorus is too repetitive. Liked the guitar "solo"

**Vike\_Me** (5.8): For perhaps the first time in my life, I can fullthroatedly say the guitar solo took a song DOWN a notch.

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): as soon as the instrumental break started, this went from a 3 to a 7

**hunnybee12** (5): her delivery is not for me

**jayjaysortagay** (5): ummm

**Lilacly\_Adily** (5): I like Big Thief but I just can't like this song

**rslashpoopheads** (5): where's Mary

**SmileAndTears** (5): Ok come through Ariana Grande enunciation!!

**vayyiqra** (5): That's a lot of things that "it" is not, but what is "it" and why do we care? Anyway, Adrianne Lenker's solo music is better

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): boring and when something happens it's just annoying

**wryn\_** (5): no thanks

**azurepatrocleia** (4.5): soo boring

**cremeebrulee** (4): not for me (i like the outro though)

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this game of 20 Questions sucks.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Should have sent something from the Adrianne Lenker album instead

**ashandimlotion** (3.5): Not this... Not this...

**timothy444** (3.5): Six minutes of an amateur voice singing with an amateur instrumental.

**fadedblue09** (3): Really grating, goes nowhere, and honestly is a slog to get through. Anyway where is Cattails

**hikkaru** (3): kinda grating for me i fear

**kappyko** (3): i like the big thief this song is a fucking slog

**nice-cat** (3): this song feels like it‚Äôs 20 minutes long. I like some of her solo stuff but I have never understood the hype for Big Thief.

**AGM301** (2.5): not this

**bespectacIed** (2): It's so boring vocally and lyrically and instrumentally. Why does adrianne's solo work wash everything the band made

**booksandplantsand** (2): adrianne girl I'm so sorry I can't with your enunciation

**gwenflip** (2): I can‚Äôt handle her voice and I‚Äôve tried but I just... it‚Äôs a no

**Sypher32** (2): good backing instrumental but much too long

**lagozzino** (1): Oh my, what an.... interesting singing voice she has.

**thedoctordances1940** (0): This feels like a hot take, but I really really hate this. Why? For one, the melody really gets on my nerves and Lenker's vocals don't really help, they're far rougher than they need to be. But surely the lyrics are good enough to merit something better than a 0? Well that's the exact problem, due to me not liking the song, the lyrics come off as being far more pretentious than they probably are meant to be and so combining all that together creates a song and a listening experience I really despise.

Sonic Youth's cultural significance has seemed to dwane a bit in the last few years. At one point they were considered one of the most important rock bands of the 80's and 90's and in a lot of respects they still are. But when I think of the past five years or so I can't think of too many artists that popheads would love that were greatly influenced by Sonic Youth and I think that really hurt them here. The song had most of its run in the mid 20s and slid down the rankings as more songs started coming in. Unfortunate for a band that are as well beloved as them but no 11s are only going to get you so far in this rate.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): eighties rock is the best rock. Debate your indie horse.

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely love the intro and the song as a whole - hope it doesn‚Äôt get cut early on but i think it will :/

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**chilipeepers** (10): , Kim Gordon I Love You!!!!!!!!!

**ColdSore2020** (10): One of the best (and most famous) alt-rock songs ever and for great reason. It is like seven minutes long, but I wish it just kept going.

**EnCaine** (10): I thought this was the worst song ever when I played it on rock band 2 when I was 9 years old and then I played rock band 2 again when I was 14 and I thought it was the greatest song ever

**ExtraEater** (10): Imagine being so cool that a band like Sonic Youth would write a song about you in which they (lovingly) fantasize you as president of the United States

**frogaranaman** (10): Thank you to my friend for introducing this album to me. Heavily iconic of you and I adore the rest of that list too. :)

**Gonza\_90** (10): Yes

**pig-serpent** (10): Sonic Youth going uptempo and bringing a lot more of a punk energy than normal, and they have phoenominal guitar work as always. This was the gateway into one of my favorite bands and it's definitely getting robbed in this rate.

**Zi99yStardust** (10): An absolute classic and for obvious reason

**notdallin** (9.1): This is it. No, this *is* it. Hey this is really it. This is *it*. No I mean it, this is it.

**Flegasaurus** (9): yay!!!

**insertusernameheree** (9): I feel like I know this one but I also can't place it

**proscett** (9): KIM GORDON! put some respect on her name

**vayyiqra** (9): Yet another long song which is hyped a lot but I kind of get why

**wavingwolves** (9): great song to throw ass to

**Vike\_Me** (8.6): This is one song that must not be pared-down. The intro is just lovely, and it is uses all of its nearly seven minutes beautifully.

**trashypanini** (8.5): what can I say, boomers making perfect Xer music. Jokes aside the repetitive guitar hook works so much here.

**Kardif** (8.3): It's kinda long, but familiar

**babygrillx** (8): that guitar melody is great

**booksandplantsand** (8): feels coming of age, yay!

**gileswithachainsaw** (8): Quite good. Doesn't really speak to me personally or I'd give it a better score, but it's very well crafted.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this guitar :yas:

**morgchrist** (8): some nice melodies, feels too long tho

**musical\_pyn** (8): this is the kind of song I expected to hear coming into the rate

**rickikardashian** (8): ‚Äúteen age riot‚Äù sounds like what tiktok kids thought the gen z revolution would be

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): The intro is kind of obnoxiously long, but otherwise a really solid track

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**Stryxen** (7.5): or i could just listen to paradisin‚Äô

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.3): I was more charitable to this after a few listens, I think Sonic Youth is hit and miss for me

**officialged** (7.1): Liked the guitars and drums, the voice was boring though, and too clear-sounding for the instrumentation.

=====

steelstepladder: **2dina3dworld** (7): I guess it‚Äôs because I come from the nu-metal school of rebellion, but I expected something more energetic and hectic ‚Ä¶ this was nice, but such a betrayal of my expectations.

**Arybeck67** (7): I‚Äôm a teenager and I didn‚Äôt riot, I want my money back üò§

**engifear** (7): Why this song and not Kool Thing or Incinerate?

**jasannn** (7): those whispering voices in the beginning scared me. I thought someone was in my room.

**nice-cat** (7): definitely a chill little song. the intro is a little long for me.

**txrxwxwx** (7): fun lil distorted number

**whizzer0** (7): I always see this band's records on sale but I don't think they're really my thing

**jman457** (6.7): just not for me

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it sure takes this one a long time to get going, pretty boring for a teenage riot

**seanderlust** (6.5): okie dokie

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): No more 2 minutes of nothingness. Society has progressed past the need for worthless intros

**steamedasparagus** (6.5): too long!!

**camerinian** (6): I only really know Sonic Youth from reputation, and I think I was expecting more from this? If this is a bad place to start with them, please somebody tell me.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you had six minutes to go somewhere and you just didn‚Äôt

**hepmeucsb** (6): It‚Äôs not bad, the guitar was good, but it felt a little long.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I sleep, smells like teen spirit outsold

**Iris3271** (6): The first few minutes were unnecessary

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): sort of a bop but learn to edit your songs 80s indie stars!!

**azurepatrocleia** (5.5): sonic youth are a bit overrated imo

**just\_thonking** (5.5): Not a fan of the heavy guitar

**wryn\_** (5.5): love that this song is 7 minutes long and it literally does 1 thing

**bulforster** (5): The intro was promising but it gets extremely bland when the guy starts singing.

**fadedblue09** (5): Idk how to feel about this. It probably sounded iconic back then but this sound has been so over-emulated ever since, this just feels boring in comparison

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this song seems like a random album cut of some band with 10,000 spotify listeners, not a song deemed good and important enough to be sent to represent indie music on r/popheads

**jajarepelotud0** (5): Nice song, but it feels kinda long tbh

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this does not feel riotous enough

**targetguest** (5): kinda sounds like everything else on this list but not in a great way

**useless-sheep** (5): boring

**Vromega** (5): it's probably good but not my taste at all The guitar is so repetitive

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (5): ; I can‚Äôt deal with these ling songs that start to sound repetitive

**Sypher32** (4.5): sounds nice enough, but I can't forgive the length

**esskeetitli** (4): The instrumental is too distracting, and perhaps too rough around the edges.

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): Did this song need to be this long? No.

**runaway3212** (4): boring

**Uberpigeon** (4): im losing my mind theyre all the same

**zagreux** (3): sees the title: nice, looks like a teen-punk anthem listens to the song: wow, first punk anthem that made me sleep

**NotWith10000Men** (2): wtf is that first minute and a half? Cut allllll of that off and you'd have a decent song

pallum: Definitely possible but I think Estelle, Lizzo, and The Weeknd will do pretty well, among others. Janet Jackson might do well too, though I personally *really* dislike that song. It's also such a small sample that it's kind of difficult to make much of demographic stats probably.

**bespectacIed** (10): My favorite song from my favorite album of all time from my favorite band of all time. This band and album has profoundly changed my life and it makes me emo that we are rating them in my fave sub. This won't win, but this has already won over my life. Stan belle and sebastian !!!!!! P.S. there's too much love is the best b&s song

**bigbigbee** (10): Hey, you tried to slip a pop song under our noses! Nice try! But seriously, this is so cute and sweet, and so easy to listen to; I would probably call this song the easiest to listen to in the entire rate. I can‚Äôt believe it has haters. I was astounded to find out that this song is almost 25 years old ‚Äì it must have really influenced the sound of the early 2010s, which is when I would have guessed.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): does this count as la boheme

**fadedblue09** (10): Simple-sounding but charming

**frogaranaman** (10): This song sounds like a warm hug.

**insertusernameheree** (10): belle & sebastian were my obsession in middle school (bc of the Juno soundtrack lol) and I still love them ü•∫

**jajarepelotud0** (10): I just love singing "get me away, I'm dying" in such a happy tune

**musical\_pyn** (10): me too prince philip, me too

**pros-and-connors** (10): were you really a depressed gay teenager if you didn‚Äôt listen to Belle and Sebastian?

**targetguest** (10): loooooved this made me smile I just have no idea what this song is about is it supposed to sound happy?

**bbfan132** (9): such a pretty/relaxing song to listen to!!

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9): It's hard not to see this track with pink-colored glasses since it held me up trough high school... Oh fuck it, it really deserves a nine

**Gonza\_90** (9): Oh yeah, I remember this band.

**ReallyCreative** (9): Chromatica in the Ultimate Ultimate rate

**waluigiest** (9): Belle and Sebastian owns my entire being after ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Too Much Love‚Äù was featured in the formative gay short film The Way He Looks

**wryn\_** (9): the horns on this changed my life

**zagreux** (9): "I'm dying" relatable kings/queens (stream kings and queens by lady gaga)

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): I love the juxtaposition between the lyrics and the production

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.5): This guy should do a cover of Mrs. Brown, You‚Äôve Got a Lovely Daughter

**seanderlust** (8.5): this is a very belle and sebastian song

**Vike\_Me** (8.1): God, this is solid but Piazza, New York Catcher would have been nine+.

**Iris3271** (8): I also cry at endings

**just\_thonking** (8): omg it's so cute

**notdallin** (8): ngl if the choice is between ‚Äúbe[ing] successful or be[ing] us,‚Äù in what world would i choose us üò≥

**plastichaxan** (8): they have much better songs but i'm happy to rate belle and sebastian

**rslashpoopheads** (8): a full mood

**skargardin** (8): Me as a healer when I'm trying to keep the raid party alive in Castle Nathria

**wavingwolves** (8): too relatable for my own good

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.9): Is it just me or does this sound a lot like The Smiths? I have no idea if this is a cold take because I know very little about B&S. Regardless, it's a good song.

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): Gavin & Stacey music but better!!

**runaway3212** (7.5): this grew on me

**Stryxen** (7.5): have you tried living

**timothy444** (7.5): Pretty poppy for an indie song

**txrxwxwx** (7.5): cute tune

**gwenflip** (7.4): I love the surf-rocky bluesy guitar line

steelstepladder: **AHSWeeknd** (7): Beatles but make it modern and suited for Gen Z

**booksandplantsand** (7): basic but fun!

**Flegasaurus** (7): if i could improve this song i would just add a bunch of delay and reverb

**pig-serpent** (7): I've avoided this band because I expected them to be dreary and pretentious, but this is actually fun.

**SmileAndTears** (7): Going back to this after a few months, I think I like it more than I used to but I still don't love it

**steamedasparagus** (7): it‚Äôs fine!! whatever!!

**veryanniev** (7): strong ¬´Zooey Deschanel‚Äôs movies¬ª energy

**whizzer0** (7): this came on after the Black Country, New Road track so I can't tell if this is actually good or not

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): Compared to the other songs in this rate, this at least sounds a little uplifting rather than depressing (despite the title and lyrics lmao)

**Zi99yStardust** (7): Sounds like a budget version of 'The Smiths' but in a good way

**Kardif** (6.5): real lyrics! Guitar is serviceable, but plain

**jman457** (6.2): I had a crush on a guy who really liked B&S, where I pretend to like them. In reality they are just ok

**cremeebrulee** (6): not my cup of tea

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): This isn't memorable at all, although it does sound nice.

**engifear** (6): it‚Äôs fine

**Flipping\_Whales** (6): kind of unmemorable

**jasannn** (6): Put that thing back where it came from or so help meeeee.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): üò¥üò¥üò¥/5

**ManofOranges** (6): bitch me too, you're not special

**Sypher32** (6): fine

**Turpamutteri** (6): The singing style doesn't do it for me

**slimboyfriend** (5.8): I tried doing an indieheads rate that included this album, but all the songs sounded like this one and I got bored.

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): not memorable, not unique, and neither above nor below average, nor on either extreme

**babygrillx** (5): not horrible but boring

**camerinian** (5): I don‚Äôt trust Belle and Sebastian. Don‚Äôt ask me to elaborate on this

**hepmeucsb** (5): It didn‚Äôt do much for me.

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): This just sounds like a generic country song

**proscett** (5): ik this is rich coming from an animal collective and joanna newsom lover but the vocals are too grating for me tbh. he lowkey sounds like morrissey w a lisp

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): this song feels like a mix between the opening credit song of a early 00's romcom and a commercial jingle

**useless-sheep** (5): boring

**officialged** (4.7): Kinda quirky and summery. But on the simple side. Didn't grow on me that much.

**esskeetitli** (4.5): This wasn't really my vibe.

**morgchrist** (4): never understood their appeal

**nice-cat** (4): It sounds a little bit like a bad Belle and Sebastian parody? if y‚Äôall had picked Piazza, New York Catcher it would‚Äôve gotten my 11

**NotWith10000Men** (4): does anyone in this rate have an interesting, dynamic voice

**Uberpigeon** (4): its ok but its not my cup of tea

**vayyiqra** (4): This makes me think of those annoying songs that are composed for ads that have annoying whistles and ukulele and they're unbearable.

**Arybeck67** (3): get me away from this rate, I‚Äôm dying of boredom

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i feel like im in the car with an insufferable man who only watches films with a budget below $20,000 and he is playing the soundtrack to his newest obsession

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): this guy‚Äôs voice...

**ThaCoolness** (3): I'm sorry, I hate the vocals, I'm pretty sure I hear a lisp and it's not it

**trashypanini** (3): I‚Äôm no vocal coach or knowledgeable on vocal pedagogy but I really wanted him to lift his tongue or open the mouth a bit more. Still sounds like a perfect example of the happysad melody heavy in the indie-alternative pop scene.

We really don't like shoegaze huh? I was really hoping this would do a little better as I went through a whole shoegaze phase at one point in my life and this was one of my most listened to songs from that period but a good portion of the raters were just not a fan of the smothering wall of sound approach thats a staple of the genre. Really unfortunate for the fans of the genre as they did start showing their head toward the end of the rate.

---

**Flegasaurus** (11): i really reallyy really like slowdive. a lot. r/popheads should do a shoegaze rate

**babygrillx** (10): so so so beautiful. the song that got me into shoegays

**bbfan132** (10): pygmalion >> but this is also heavenly

**bespectacIed** (10): fundamental

**chilipeepers** (10): I love Slowdive so much.

**Gonza\_90** (10): I'm a simple man, I see shoegaze, I give it a high note.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/v6qSCBm.gif

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): so true

**morgchrist** (10): the best shoegaze band

**camerinian** (9): Slowdive were my first gateway into shoegaze, and I think they‚Äôre still my favourite act doing it. The soundscapes they create are just an unparalleled level of dreamy.

**frogaranaman** (9): Slowdive is so good.

**hepmeucsb** (9): Love, love, love! The lyrics are plain but are so moving at the same time.

**proscett** (9): im such a slut for shoegaze its not funny. wish we could rate ride but that's a topic for another day

**skargardin** (9): they snapped honestly

**SmileAndTears** (9): This is what Cigarettes After Sex think they're doing

**1998tweety** (8.5): vibey

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): this is so smooooth

**txrxwxwx** (8.5): shoegaze staple

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i love shoe gays they're the best type of gays

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): Another dream pop number, I think I really like this genre

**jman457** (8.4): what can I say, im a slut for dream pop/shoegaze

**officialged** (8.1): Love the shoegaze. The melody could've been stronger, but this song still draws you in. Can't wait to skate through a summery forrest with this song playing in my headphones.

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): Shoegaze is just dreampop for indieheads

**cremeebrulee** (8): its vibey i like that

**runaway3212** (8): very fun

**steamedasparagus** (8): no thoughts head empty

**Stryxen** (8): these vampire bitches is scaring me

**whizzer0** (8): see you can make weaker vocals work if you have cool stuff going on with them

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): sounds like it should be in the nowhere (1997) soundtrack

**trashypanini** (7.5): has that classic shoegazy distortion/fuzz and just overall faraway-ness that enamors you. But with a side of major burying of vocals.

**ReallyCreative** (7.1): it's cute but these vocals, get this man some Claritin because his nasal passages are in crisis

**2dina3dworld** (7): I don‚Äôt have any strong thoughts on this‚Ä¶ it was nice, I guess?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I think this is the point where all these songs started to slowly blend together.

**insertusernameheree** (7): most neutral I've been about a song in a while

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): Idk it gives me good vibes

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (7): ,5

**RandomHypnotica** (7): It's nice, but I hate the shoegaze style of just having a really blurry/fuzzy sound to everything

**useless-sheep** (7): cute

**zagreux** (7): just vibes

steelstepladder: **Arybeck67** (6.9): solid song again, but these songs are really starting to blend together at this point. They all sound the same.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): fine but really forgettable to me

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This is surprisingly quiet for a shoegaze song. It's fine‚Ñ¢.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): this sounds like every *slowed + reverb* edit ive seen

**wryn\_** (6.5): so dreamy that its almost too much

**jajarepelotud0** (6): I don't particularly like songs about dreams, but the instrumentation is excellent

**jayjaysortagay** (6): üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥/5 but I liked the harmonies

**Kardif** (6): bored

**moonagenightmares** (6): have tried getting into slowdive so many times but my god are they boring

**mudkip1** (6): slowdive has better music than this:( their most recent album is so good

**rslashpoopheads** (6): as my middle school health textbook once said, abstinence is the key to happiness!

**timothy444** (6): Chill?

**Vromega** (6): The sirens in the background are too loud... whyyy. The verses are much more refreshing

**azurepatrocleia** (5.5): no.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I love the atmospheric vibe of this but the distortion just sounds unpleasant and lulling.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I'm a fan of Daughter, their second album in particular, and I was under the impression that all shoegaze (inspired) songs have to have depressing instrumentals, but this Slowdive song is just a wall of noise without any progression or emotion behind it. Dissociative, I guess, but not engaging at all.

**izeasklapaucius** (5): shoe when it's being gazed upon idk i don't listen to the genre

**vayyiqra** (5): boring

**AHSWeeknd** (4): omg what happened to Alison DiLaurentis

**akanewasright** (4): This is Not For Me‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

**booksandplantsand** (4): just not very memorable idk

**musical\_pyn** (4): I immediately forget what this sounds like whenever I finish listening to it

**gileswithachainsaw** (3.2): Okay I've hit my shoegaze limit. One more shoegaze song and it's getting a zero.

**jasannn** (3): Sounds like teen angst and puberty

**Sypher32** (3): forgettable

**NotWith10000Men** (2): ugh sounds so murky and blah

Furries unite! No, not Car Seat Headrest but TV On the Radio. A song that was able to amass a few big fans but left enough people wanting a bit more to where they couldn't justify giving it a higher score. No one really hated it though which allowed it to stay out the bottom 10.

---

**EnCaine** (11): please bust my box and gut my fish, tunde

**TiltControls** (11): One of the best rock songs of all time and I'm giving it my 11 cause I'm afraid no one else on the subreddit will (and it being one of my long time favourites helps too)

**azurepatrocleia** (10): I just want to hunt sth when I listen to this it makes me feel feral

**bbfan132** (10): i love how noisy/wild this song is, it‚Äôs all over the place in the best way possible

**bespectacIed** (10): So good

**chilipeepers** (10): It's a staple of my fanfiction playlists and I love it.

**Gonza\_90** (10): Another one of my old favorites

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i suddenly feel like watching Beastars

**insertusernameheree** (10): a song I just want to dance to in the dark

**nice-cat** (10): WE‚ÄôRE HOWLING!! FOREVER!!!

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this was almost my 11 but it felt too obvious. know that if i could give two 11's, this would make the list. it's funky, it's sexy, it's bloody and honest, and the lyrics are beyond amazing. classic!

**ReallyCreative** (10): this was a favorite but I see it getting robbed unfortunately. Shockingly great discovery though!

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): DLZ remains superior

**nt96** (9.7): Love the tempo changes!

**TheEvilNightman** (9.5): I'm a furry now. IDGAF

**bigbigbee** (9): This is movie montage music, but like in a good way? I wish I had more interesting comments because I really jam to this song so much, but I think all I can say is that when I listen to this I want to put on a pair of shades and stroll through the mall. In 2006.

**frogaranaman** (9): Howling! Forever!

**musical\_pyn** (9): this is also a song that uses its length super well in that it recognizes it only needs to be 5 min and doesn‚Äôt extend it for no reason

**whizzer0** (9): this is more like it I definitely need to check them out

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): this is a bop!!! that chorus is so catchy

**ggal2020** (8.8): I read Meet Me in the Bathroom last year, and TV on the Radio seem like the nicest guys in that whole scene. Big respect to them.

**babygrillx** (8.5): banger

**Flipping\_Whales** (8.5): unfortunately all the wolf metaphors are tainted by my experiences with the omegaverse

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): yas this bridge

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): It‚Äôs giving me movie trailer vibes, I like it

**targetguest** (8.5): recognize the song but not the artist or title. good song to drive fast to

**Kardif** (8.4): radio hit

**Vike\_Me** (8.4): Damn, the first two minutes are perfect for rocking out in the car with my foot on the gas pedal. I do quite like the song as a whole as well.

**jman457** (8.2): I feel like their pretty underrated, but maybe thats because they havent released an album in forever

**booksandplantsand** (8): wait this is kind of a serve, all right

**JunkyGS** (8): bark bark

**morgchrist** (8): not a big fan of TVOTR, but I Was a Lover from this album is an all-timer

**rslashpoopheads** (8): welcome to furrycon, may I take your order?

**SmileAndTears** (8): bop

**rickikardashian** (7.5): is this about the omegaverse

**wryn\_** (7.5): how have i never heard this omg this is so cool!

**Zi99yStardust** (7.5): I was skeptical during the first parts of this song but the slowdown post the halfway mark + build up after really brought it all together for me

**officialged** (7.4): An interesting one. I just watched the live version on Letterman. This song is so much better live. I guess I have to get used to the sort of messy vocals in the studio version. The only other song I know of TV on the Radio is Staring at the Sun. I like that one better.

**gileswithachainsaw** (7.1): I wanted to give this a higher score at first, but it made me uneasy in a way I couldn't put my finger on. Then I realized it was because it sounds vaguely like an Imagine Dragons song. There's some dark energy at work here.

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**jajarepelotud0** (7): I think it lacks some energy

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the change up in the middle is cool

**steamedasparagus** (7): I like it

**trashypanini** (7): The vocals and production are pretty powerful and high energy, gives me anthemic classic rock song vibes. Which I liked! Song hit its peak in the first half. Goes in circles afterwards.

**zagreux** (7): is the weird effect that makes their voices sound distant a stylistic choice? if so, it sure is a bad one.

=====

steelstepladder: **Arybeck67** (6.5): I just feel like with a bunch of these songs I could just turn on Alt-Nation on Sirius XM and hear the same thing over and over again, carbon copies of each other.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): indie music!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): me when i‚Äôm playing farm

**wavingwolves** (6): not wolf like me enough for me to really love it

**slimboyfriend** (5.4): They kinda sound like Kings of Leon lol

**hepmeucsb** (5): The imagery of howling like a wolf just conjures images of Teen Wolf in my mind, and the song itself felt like pretty straightforward indie-rock, so eh.

**Iris3271** (5): I can't figure out if I like the song or really hate it. I don't like the vocals and find the lyrics cringey but at the same time almost enjoy it?

**pig-serpent** (5): I like the more rocking vibe but the vocals on here are pretty bad.

**proscett** (5): ngl i zoned out halfway thru this

**Stryxen** (5): I was with it until about halfway through when I realised i just didn‚Äôt really like it

**Sypher32** (5): Decent start, but started peetering out midway through

**txrxwxwx** (5): didn't really grab me

**useless-sheep** (5): ok but boring

**vayyiqra** (5): Always thought this band's name was amusing but I do not like this too much

**Vromega** (5): This seems to be a good song but too far from my taste I have to stay a popheads here

**2dina3dworld** (4): I thought this was good at first, but then it fell apart

**timothy444** (4): furaffinity-core

**notdallin** (3.6): I‚Äôve never gotten the love for this song. It‚Äôs very ugly all around.

**esskeetitli** (3): No.

**fkadizzy-1804** (3): The beat switch was cool but for the most part this was unmelodic and tiresome

**jasannn** (3): Yup, sounds typical mid 2000's music.

**runaway3212** (3): I've heard this exact song fives times already this rate

**bulforster** (2.2): Florence's Howl far outsold.

**fadedblue09** (2): Really forgettable

The Money Store by Death Grips is one of those definitive experimental hip hop albums of the 2010s. I was really nervous for this one at first but this is one of the few songs that actually gained in popularity as more scores came in. I think because many songs are on the slower side the up beat bop scored well with people that wanted a change of pace from white guy indie rock and it ended up doing not too bad for itself as a result.

---

**ashandimlotion** (11): one of the best songs of all time lol ??? One of the only ones in this rate that doesn‚Äôt overstay it‚Äôs welcome as well

**astrologicalangel** (11): fuck yes

**celladonn** (11): It just bangs so hard

**WhyDoIExistXD** (11): Really fun and energetic song with a good lyrical meaning

**2dina3dworld** (10): Is this just indie-circle acceptable Insane Clown Posse?

**akanewasright** (10): ‚Ä¶I have a feeling that this will be divisive. But I love this djdhsbsj this is just a fucking bop

**bespectacIed** (10): My submission to the voting thread ‚ù§ This song is legendary but it's a crime to not link the KKB (aka Life Grips) cover https://youtu.be/ZexwGDjxrpk. Sarah saying "i stay noided" in her kawaii voice is my religion

**camerinian** (10): Finding out that Death Grips, the I CUM IN THE FUCK 20 symbols play at once band, have heaps of actual for real semi-pop bangers like this was one of the biggest revelations of this little indie kid's life

**cremeebrulee** (10): this absolutely bangs i need to listen to this album expeditiously

**CrimsonROSET** (10): thank you kappy for making me realize the song this sounds like is push it by salt n peppa

**engifear** (10): FUCK YEAH

**fadedblue09** (10): The Party Rock Anthem of indieheads

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): bitch me too the fuck

**frogaranaman** (10): Maybe Fantano has a point.

**Iris3271** (10): Makes me wanna do ketamine

**izeasklapaucius** (10): gay anthem wbk

**JunkyGS** (10): Okay..... I can see why Fantano stans them. This production is SOOOOOOO sick!

**kappyko** (10): TWERK ANTHEM

**kirby31200** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZexwGDjxrpk

**ManofOranges** (10): Quick someone link that picture of Beyonce with the Death Grips

**moonagenightmares** (10): I‚Äôve checked out death grips multiple times before but it never clicked until now

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): banger

**nootnoot781** (10): wait this is a bop hold on. another album i need to check out, ty for all these new music r/indieheads!!!

**pig-serpent** (10): One of the hypest songs ever written. I need to find the local clubs that play industrial music so that I can ask the dj to play this and start a big mosh pit in the bar and everyone will clap.

**seanderlust** (10): this immediately after heaven or las vegas...call us dua lipa cause we did a full 180

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i couldn't understand a single word they sang except of the line ive seen footage without searching for the lyric, but this won't stop me for loving this track lmao.

**waluigiest** (10): why is this so lit oh my god

**wavingwolves** (10): I'VE SEEN FOOTAGE! I STAY NUTTED! I'VE SEEN FOOTAGE!

**nice-cat** (9.5): I‚Äôve always been so put off by everything about Death Grips that I never really gave them a chance, but this is so different from how I was expecting them to sound. it‚Äôs kind of a bop??

**wryn\_** (9.5): death grips usually arent my thing but this is like the best pop song ever lol

**gileswithachainsaw** (9.4): A banger. I'm amazed at the way Death Grips manages to be catchy and poppy underneath their aggressive, noisy veneer.

**bulforster** (9.1): Main pop boy MC Ride

**bbfan132** (9): imagine some random person asking you what you love to listen to and playing them this‚Ä¶ lmao i‚Äôm just picturing anthony fantano showing this to his parents or something

**buddhacharm** (9): bald man bad

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): My expectations were very high, and while they were mostly met, this feels kinda tepid. It's a fun inoffensive bop.

**hikkaru** (9): -1 point for the vocals that are a bit bothersome tbh but the production slaps

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://media1.tenor.com/images/ce64fd76a751a94ca351663aefbe99c0/tenor.gif

**just\_thonking** (9): I can't explain why I enjoy this song so much

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): So this is what Death Grips is‚Ä¶ I like it!

**sarcasticsobs** (9): something something anthony fantano something something

**ThaCoolness** (9): banger

**jasannn** (8.5): ok, this is hype.

**jman457** (8.5): feel like the song would be amazing live

**officialged** (8.5): Such a cool, grungy, driving song. I'm surprised how much I like it. Their voice is attractive, the beat and bass really hard and driving (reminded me of Rihanna's Shut Up and Drive :D ). And the glitches and weird effect on top of it, cool.

**Flegasaurus** (8): STAY NOIDED

**Flipping\_Whales** (8): I found out about this from KKB's cover and I fucking love it

**hepmeucsb** (8): Banger through and through!

**insertusernameheree** (8): good party music (for post covid)

**Kardif** (8): feels like early 00s electronic music, dancey can hardly understand a word

**proscett** (8): probably my fav death grips song, it goes so hard

**Stryxen** (8): wait let me never listening again üòç

**targetguest** (8): I looked forward to this one coming around on the playlist each time but i don't really like listening to it at the same time

**timothy444** (8): Never thought we'd be reviewing Death Grips but here we are

**Uberpigeon** (8): Ive never listened to Death Grips before now because im not straight but omg... this actually slaps and is way more dancey than I expected. I vibe.

**nt96** (7.7): Great song, but I liked Get Got better.

**azurepatrocleia** (7.5): I prefer hacker tho

**esskeetitli** (7.5): I can see why some people hate this, but I liked it.

**steamedasparagus** (7.5): my favorite death grips. swallowed by bees

**TheEvilNightman** (7.5): Weirdy catchy for a Death Grips track.

**trashypanini** (7.5): that electronic element(?) really is relentless and fun. Vocals are high energy and gets you moving. Might actually give them a chance.

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): When I saw the name "death grip" I thought this was gonna be a flop, but in a weird way I kinda dig this??

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): why does this sound like push it by salt n peppa

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): Why does he sound like that

steelstepladder: **babygrillx** (7): catchy

**CritneySpearz** (7): I‚Äôm intrigued to listen to more...

**rslashpoopheads** (7): can't touch this

**txrxwxwx** (7): first time listening to death grips and it feels like a shitpost but that explains why the 100 gecs stans like them

**useless-sheep** (7): cute but not a fan of the vocals and -1 for giving me a headache

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a lot more melodic and less harsh than I thought Death Grips would be. I don't really like the vocals but like the rest of it.

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): this is so chaotic

**gwenflip** (6.5): I have no idea how to feel about this

**Sypher32** (6.5): Something funky compared to the other entries! Novelty is good.

**Turpamutteri** (6): umm

**whizzer0** (6): yeah this isn't for me

**notdallin** (5.7): if this were literally ANY other death grips song it‚Äôd probably automatically be my 0, but this song legitimately bangs and is somewhat catchy. But it‚Äôs still a 5.7.

**Arybeck67** (5.5): I can see the appeal, but I‚Äôve never been one to like guys I can‚Äôt understand and who sound oddly British but are from Sac???

**Gonza\_90** (5): This is a song that exists

**Zi99yStardust** (5): Reminds me heavily of House of Pain's Jump Around but with more industrial undertones - not my kind of thing but not terrible either

**musical\_pyn** (4): just not for me

**thedoctordances1940** (4): Everything about Death Grips tells me I should really be into them, they're just kind of Machine Girl but with rappping and I love Machine Girl but despite all the acclaim I've never got into them and I think Ride's vocals are the reason for that. I get why you would like them but I just find them really irritating.

**TiltControls** (4): I think I just don't get Death Grips.

**Vike\_Me** (3.9): So THAT is Death Grips. Y'all can keep them.

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Such an interesting choice of enunciation technique.

**jajarepelotud0** (3): what is this???????

**jayjaysortagay** (3): ummmmmmmm isn't this band like mega acclaimed? Can't say I get it after listening to this

**booksandplantsand** (2): the melon man LIED to me!

**ggal2020** (2): This song is three minutes long but it lasts for 30 years.

**NotWith10000Men** (2): please give this track to a good rapper or a pop girl who can sing

**SmileAndTears** (2): I... uh... Is this straight hyperpop?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2): i- definitely i thought it was fun. i liked the beat

**zagreux** (1.1): "i've seen footage" okay you've said it 72 times WE BEEN KNEW SIS

**1998tweety** (1): this was good before he opened up his mouth

Neutral Milk Hotel was the first (but not the last!) artist that really ran into having an album whose reputation preceeds itself. It delights highschool me that this song and album were able to bring in some new fans but it was not able to overcome the amount of people that either thought it didn't live up to the hype or that the hype actively swallowed up any joy they could find in the song. I started out doing fairly well then slowly but surely started dropping into day 2 settling in the 24-28 range for most of its run.

---

**insertusernameheree** (11): I may be a pophead but Neutral Milk Hotel is one of my favourite bands of all time

**KolmogorovSmirnovIce** (11): I have heard so much hype about Neutral Milk Hotel for years, but never really listened to all that much of them.....but I'm extremely into this. Shame on me

**runaway3212** (11): okay I kinda jokingly said I would give this my 11 when it was revealed but I find this the song I enjoy the most lyrically and sonically in this song. Anne Frank was an icon and this great album being inspired by her is something I really like

**2dina3dworld** (10): I love how one of the most revered indie albums is Anne Frank self-insert fanfiction

**bbfan132** (10): i forgot about how noisy this is but fuck it, i still love it

**bespectacIed** (10): Jeff Mangum ~~would have been~~ IS a Belieber

**celladonn** (10): THE ONLY GIRL I'VE EVER LOOOVED WAS BORN WITH ROSES IN HER EYES

**EnCaine** (10): tfw no anne frank gf

**frogaranaman** (10): My favorite male manipulator album.

**ggal2020** (10): Insert Anne Frank joke here

**gwenflip** (10): Indifferent Dairy Lodge who

**jajarepelotud0** (10): I read this song (the album too I think?) is about Anne Frank; cool concept, great execution

**kappyko** (10): neutral milk hotel did nothing wrong

**nt96** (10): Timeless album. I can see why it‚Äôs talked about a lot.

**sandyfishnets** (10): THE ONLY GIRL I'VE EVER LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED

**Uberpigeon** (10): an anne frank banger

**waluigiest** (10): Fantastic song on a perfect album. His voice is iconic, the writing is so tight, the arranging is just correct.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): There should be more horns in music, I think.

**gileswithachainsaw** (9.5): When I first saw this on the rate I figured it was getting an eight, but I had forgotten how much it bangs. Turned it on and 13 year old me was back in full force. Y'all should've sent Two Headed Boy and it would've gotten a ten.

**notdallin** (9.5): there are no words to even begin to explain how important this song is

**Vike\_Me** (9.2): It just sounds good! Love the fuzziness, the general pace of the whole song and just fuck, well, everything. Lives up to the hype.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Okay, I was going to tank this song originally, because I absolutely hate the cult following around this album, but it's honestly a lot better than most of the songs I've heard here, so good on you, big mommy neutral milkers.

**Flipping\_Whales** (9): blown-out low end? not in a hyperpop?? I'm shocked

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (9): ,5

**rickikardashian** (9): this fucks but im a little uncomfy bopping to a song about anne frank

**whizzer0** (9): I can't believe you got me to listen to Neutral Milk Hotel and I can't believe I liked it

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): another comment about parks and rec here

**nice-cat** (8.5): I want to dislike this because of the weird concept and because the album is so overrated but I‚Äôm such a sucker for the horns üòî

**seanderlust** (8.5): i'm a basic indie bro. i'm such a sucker for NMH. i'm not sorry at all. i only got into them because they were namedropped on parks and rec and i was in my folklore era and wanted to seem deep :sob:

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): omg is this the album about wanting to fuck Anne Frank!!! I like this actually

**TiltControls** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtdRtiUrphU

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): Bombastic indie at nearly it's best - it just falls slightly flat because of how repetitive it is

**Gonza\_90** (8.2): Probably this is getting tanked by many because of how hyped this album is in certain circles, but this song is pretty good.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I enjoy the trumpets in the song, interesting choice of instrument along with some loud ass drums

**camerinian** (8): Ooh baby now this is some fucking lo-fi

**engifear** (8): Had I rated this back in high school, this probably would‚Äôve been my 11. Luckily, for everyone I have since grown up. I still see why I enjoyed this album so much and I‚Äôll listen to it occasionally, but it‚Äôs a bit odd now. I feel a little more uncomfortable with the entire album being about Anne Frank. I used to enjoy how odd and pretentious this album was, but now I‚Äôm not so easily impressed. One of 3 albums on the rate that I own a physical copy of.

**hepmeucsb** (8): Overall I enjoyed it, but I bumped it up an extra point for the horns

**ImADudeDuh** (8): so when Justin Bieber says that he hopes Anne Frank would be a belieber, everyone hates him, but when these milk people make a love song to her, its called art? Wtf is this world coming to? SHARE IF YOU AGREE

**musical\_pyn** (8): I think this song gave me stockholm syndrome

**pat-rickstar** (8): I hate the name "Neutral Milk Hotel" so much but I like the song a lot more than I thought I would

**pig-serpent** (8): Fantastic album but this song is on the lower end of it for me.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): The fact that this came out in 1998 is crazy, I can see why it was so influential

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): finally I have heard a neutral milk hotel song even though I‚Äôve known the name for ages

**Kardif** (7.8): kinda muddy sound

**Stryxen** (7.8): NOBODY is making songs like this anymore üòåüíÖ and we DON‚ÄôT need anymore

**slimboyfriend** (7.6): These lyrics are really trying to say something huh

**wryn\_** (7.5): obviously liking this band is a red flag but this song slaps

**Arybeck67** (7.3): unfortunately I‚Äôm really bored at this point and this song had the unfortunate task of attempting to get my attention back. It sorta worked, but not fantastically.

**jayjaysortagay** (7): wah wah wah wah wahhhhhhh

**proscett** (7): april ludgate punching the air rn

**skargardin** (7): bop

**SmileAndTears** (7): hmmm ok

**timothy444** (7): Thanks /mu/

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): at last we have figured out Tom's true birth year

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm out of my edgy teen NMH phase and listen to real music like pop now /s tbh I understand why people like this even though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs THAT special to be a cult classic, its unpolishedness and frantic energy is compelling. And even though Jeff took some, uh, liberties with the themes and his Anne Frank fixation is a bit eyebrow-raising, it seems to come from a genuine place.

**trashypanini** (6.5): This song busy-ish (in a bad way) and dull. Tried to capture an eclectic energy and complexity like the rest of the album which was annoying and contrived.

**booksandplantsand** (6): messy but fun!

**chilipeepers** (6): , I just don't vibe with NMH.

**Flegasaurus** (6): it's a little noisy!! and that's about it idk i just don't get the hype for this album

**moonagenightmares** (4): never have and never will get the nmh hype, also this gave me a headache I‚Äôm pretty sure

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the horns are nice but he has Stereotypical Indie Band Voice

**ReallyCreative** (4): you know, I love Parks and Rec, I really do! But it's such an obscure reference to make a band around and I feel like if you're going to do it, you should do it a little better. Disappointed, but Pawnee Forever!

**esskeetitli** (3.5): Too noisy.

**jman457** (3.3): not because its a bad song, I just hate seeing straight people happy

**officialged** (3.1): Couldn't get into it. Too messy and directionless for me. Also, is it just me or does it sound like there's white noise in the background throughout the whole song? :D

**babygrillx** (3): man i cannot stand his voice

**ThaCoolness** (2): I hate this song and I hate this overrated creepy album

**fadedblue09** (1): I only liked the guitar strumming at the beginning

**morgchrist** (1): weird obsession w Anne Frank. An album I used to love but now think is pretty not good?

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): more like h0lland 0000

**plastichaxan** (0): the way this song made me doubt if this rate was for me or not and made me want to stop doing it and not submit...i think that says enough

**wavingwolves** (0): sounds like the tiktok hit can't stop singing from the teen beach movie soundtrack

WillamThunderfuck: Genuine question: do Indieheads focus more on lyrics than Popheads?

vayyiqra: two points about that to hopefully answer your question:

1. i think all music within a genre tends to sound alike when you don't know it that well
2. this is one rate where i think it helped a lot to read the lyrics, since the lyrics do matter for many songs but also they were hard to understand in many songs lol

good question by the way, many users (including me) had the same feeling about a lot of the songs sounding alike

Radiohead is another artist whose reputation hurt its placement in the rate. The nervy, offputting electronics of Kid A were able to find love in a lot of popheads hearts but similar to Neutral Milk Hotel a lot of people cited the fanbase and their reputation for why they scored Idioteque so low.

---

**nt96** (11): lol jk Radiohead fan here. Kid A is my all-time fav so of course this gets my 11 and no, I‚Äôm not taking any criticism.

**trashypanini** (11): THIS IS REALLY HAPPENINGx3 relentless, cold, and harsh.

**vayyiqra** (11): This is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard, a song I've listened to countless times and never gotten bored of it; it's beautiful and unsettling and haunting and weird and glitchy. Idioteque is art and you need a very high IQ to understand the sociopolitical and environmentalist implications of Thom Yorke yelping ICE AGE COMING ICE AGE COMING LET ME HEAR BOTH SIDES, a clear indictment of do-nothing centrist attitudes toward climate change mitigation. The fans understand this stuff, they andfirstandthechildren andfirstandthechildren andfirstandthechildren andfirstandthechildren from Ancient Greek ·º∞Œ¥ŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ (idi·πìtƒìs, ‚Äúa private citizen, one who has no professional knowledge, layman‚Äù), from ·º¥Œ¥ŒπŒøœÇ (√≠dios, ‚Äúone's own, pertaining to oneself, private‚Äù). from Ancient Greek Œ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑ (th·∏ókƒì, ‚Äúa case, box, receptacle‚Äù), from œÑŒØŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒπ (t√≠thƒìmi, ‚Äúput, set, place‚Äù).

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THIS IS RADIOHEAD?? What in the name of perfect production.

**Alumineous** (10): Even if you remove the Radiohead label, this song was able to differentiate itself from the rest of all the other songs in this rate. It's clearly on another level.

**ashandimlotion** (10): Radiohead most twerkable song

**babygrillx** (10): i‚Äôve avoided listening to radiohead but i can‚Äôt deny this SLAPS holy shit, autechre vibes

**bbfan132** (10): i listened to amanda palmer‚Äôs ukulele cover of this before i listened to the original version‚Ä¶

**BBthebest22** (10): The best Radiohead song and that‚Äôs saying something

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Deconstructed deconstructed club.

**Flegasaurus** (10): hyperpop

**frogaranaman** (10): Not to be a basic person or anything, but I think Radiohead is good.

**gileswithachainsaw** (10): One of my favorite songs from my favorite Radiohead album. Came very close to getting my eleven.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg Thom Yorke really predicted the success of the Ice Age franchise by Blue Sky Studios on the second verse, we love a man who knows what‚Äôs gonna be the next hit of 3D animation.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): thom yorke listened to richard d. james album and said "you know what? No. I am gonna jack this sound and make them my own."

**Kardif** (10): Thom Yorke has great sound production, vocals are always a bit out there but it just works so well together

**ManofOranges** (10): I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. And I still haven't!

**pig-serpent** (10): My favorite song off the only Radiohead album that's really clicked for me. For me this song is a perfect meld between the atmospher and cool percussion of idm with catchy melodies and pop sensibilities, and as such the song is really the best of both worlds.

**plastichaxan** (10): this is too good, i don't like radiohead fans which has put me off listening radiohead but this truly amazing

**proscett** (10): this is one of my fav radiohead songs, and the one that got me into indie at large lol. almost got my 11

**r/No-Place-to-Go** (10): I'm always surprised how much r/indieheads adores this while it's like ... the most un-Radiohead song ever? That beat speaks Aphex Twin in volumes. Speaking of the electronic producer, isn't this the song that made Radiohead fans get into Aphex Twin, but unsuccessfully? They just weren't ready for 70 minutes of ambient albums (his debut is incredible though, stream it).

**sirpancakeXI** (10): really like the intro and the drum bit

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a song that comes close to expressing how my brain works and sounds like

**wryn\_** (10): til that this is not the right song to listen to during a panic attack

**camerinian** (9.5): Kid A is perpetually on my "Yeah I'll listen to this someday" list and I never do and every time I encounter one of the tracks in the wild I feel like a fool for having not heard it

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): While not quite my favourite Radiohead song it's certainly their most innovative and deserves ever ounce of praise it gets.

**officialged** (9.2): Wonderfully experimental and eerie, such a disturbing song yet still accessible. Absolutely love it.

**engifear** (9): Throwback to when I listened exclusively to this album bc I was mega depressed. One of 3 albums on the rate that I own a physical copy of.

**kappyko** (9): actually this is that good

**mudkip1** (9): i like this song, rot /u/kappyko

**pat-rickstar** (9): It's weird and uncomfortable to listen to in a good way

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): I can‚Äôt hear what he‚Äôs saying but the production is amazing. It‚Äôs like Charli XCX for straight people

**TheEvilNightman** (9): This would get an eleven if I liked Thom Yorke's voice, because this is otherwise amazing in a way that I need some $40 beer and a job at Pitchfork in order to explain.

**timothy444** (9): BOPPPPPP

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i like the production and the verses, but i think the rest of the song leaves me wanting something more

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I'm not fond of the vocals but I feel like this is one of those songs that are just objectively good.

**Zi99yStardust** (8.5): Electronica indie before it all became really cool and as usual Thom Yorke's voice drives this

**Vike\_Me** (8.4): Nice and glitchy, and I'm not being sarcastic. No Karma Police, but something tells me this meshes more with the general Radiohead oeuvre as according to /r/Indieheads.

**jman457** (8.3): I really like this song, but I generally dont have the patience to be a radiohead fan

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): This just came and went, and left no impact on me whatsoever

**Gonza\_90** (8.2): See Holland,1945

**2dina3dworld** (8): There are so much better Radiohead songs, yet you chose this? Why not half of the other songs on Kid A, or something from In Rainbows? This feels like sabotage (half-joking, half genuine here)

**azurepatrocleia** (8): also yes.

**just\_thonking** (8): Jigsaw Falling Into Place did it better sorry

**nice-cat** (8): it‚Äôs good, but it‚Äôs not really one of my fav Radiohead songs. in fairness, that might be because I used to listen to it way too much.

**ReallyCreative** (8): weird to think this was the band that covered Lianne La Havas

**runaway3212** (8): Good but god that pitchfork review is terrible

**SmileAndTears** (8): That 1 min intro was NOT it but I do like the rest of the song

**steamedasparagus** (8): not my fav from Kid A and Kid A def isn‚Äôt my fav radiohead

**akanewasright** (7.9): A cute bop

**Iris3271** (7.5): I really enjoy the electronic elements

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): why this out of all the amazing radiohead songs

**Sypher32** (7.5): Oh so this is the Radiohead my friends are talking about

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.2): ; This production is so good shame it‚Äôs wasted on Thom York‚Äôs‚Äôs whiny voice.

steelstepladder: **chilipeepers** (7): I love Radiohead but this for me is average.

**gwenflip** (7): I wanna like this more than I do

**hepmeucsb** (7): Maybe this song works great as an album track, I dunno. Either way, I appreciated the soundscape created, but didn‚Äôt LOVE it.

**jasannn** (7): Fun fact: I only know Radiohead because of Hannah Montana. Lily and Oliver were arguing whether their first song they danced to was either Coldplay or Radiohead.

**morgchrist** (7): Kid A their best album yeah, but this song has always been way overrated

**Roxieloxie** (7): sorry kappy its not for me ://

**whizzer0** (7): my mother controversially thinks they lost their way after their first three albums and this doesn't really sway me

**Stryxen** (6.5): every few months i‚Äôm reminded radiohead exists and it ruins my day - this song is alright tho

**useless-sheep** (6.5): cute

**1998tweety** (6): hmm

**Arybeck67** (6): eh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): It‚Äôs important to know when to admit that you recognize something is good and that you just don‚Äôt like it. I think that‚Äôs how I feel about Radiohead. I see what they‚Äôre going for. I recognize they‚Äôre good in what they‚Äôre going for. My traste does not line up with what they‚Äôre going for.

**jsonphile** (6): I am fully prepared to be called uncultured because I just don‚Äôt get Radiohead. I‚Äôve tried listening to Kid A and OK Computer and I think they‚Äôre just too big brain for me.

**moooo566** (6): i don't get radiohead why people love radiohead. im sorry.

**TiltControls** (6): there were much better Radiohead songs to pick

**txrxwxwx** (6): would definitely scare me if I listened at night

**Vromega** (6): I increased by one my score after each new listen. Maybe it would have been a 12 if I had listened to this 6 times more

**buddhacharm** (5): I üëÅ had never ‚ùå even üåÉ seen üëÄ a shooting üî´ star üëÄüåü before ‚¨Ö. 25 ‚¨áüõ£ years üóì of rotations ‚ôªüìÖ, passes üé´ through comets' üí´ paths üîÅ, and travel ‚úàüö¢üóø, and to my memory üß† I üëÅ had never üö´ witnessed üëÅüëÄüëÖ burning üî• debris üè¢ scratch üëø across ‚û° the night üåô sky üåå. Radiohead were hunched over üîÅ their instruments üé∏. Thom Yorke slowly üê¢ beat ‚úäüëä on üîõ a grand üîù piano üë∏, singing üéµ, eyes üëÄ closed üö´, into his üí¶üèª microphone ‚òù like üíñ he üë• was trying üòà to kiss üëÑüëÖüíã around üîÉ a big üçÜ nose üëÉ. Colin üí© Greenwood tapped ‚òù patiently üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è on üîõ a double 2Ô∏è‚É£ bass üé∏ü•Åüí•, waiting üöè‚è∞üóæ for his üí¶ cue. White üè≥üíÖüèº pearls üìÄ of arena ‚èπüöåüì• light üí° swam over üò≥üôäüí¶ their faces üëß. A lazy üò¥ disco üï∫ light üí°üî¶ spilled üí¶ artificial ü§ñ constellations üåë inside üí† the aluminum ‚öô cove of the makeshift stage üëÑ.

Michelangelo's bones üçñ and cobblestone laid üòÇ beneath ‚ö∞. I üëÅ stared üëÄ entranced, soaking üí¶üåäüëÄ in Radiohead's new üëå material üòÜ, chiseling each sound üîäüîà into the best üèÜ functioning ‚öô‚õì parts üíÜ„ÄΩ of my brain üß† which would be the only sound üîä system üó∫ for the material üò° for months üìÜ.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): call them Radiobed because this put me right to sleep

**zagreux** (1): It's like Bj√∂rk but watered down for cishet white men who pat themselves on the back for listening to 'real music'

**bulforster** (0): Fuck off with that title and this atrocious attempt at?? parody of?? dance music.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I hate - hate - Radiohead. And I can tell you exactly why. One year, my high school's marching band did a show based completely on Radiohead music. And let me tell you, there is nothing in this world more insuffereable than being around high school marching band participants who are obsessed with Radiohead. Nothing. And ever since then, I have just had a Pavlovian reaction of disdain whenever something by Radiohead came on.

People divided into two camps with this song. Those that were impressed with how much this was able to do with the pacabels cannon progression and those that hated that a slow ballad would simply use the pacabels cannon progression. It's a dreamy spacy vibe for those who were able to get into it and personally, I actually think it's better than the original can't help falling in love.

---

**bookthieving** (11): am i a basic pophead for giving my 11 to the song that incorporates two pop songs

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I have never head this before this rate. But Can't Help Falling In Love is one of my favorite songs ever, and the layering and structure around is here is just gorgeous.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is so ethereal.

**camerinian** (10): god damn, it‚Äôs like they scientifically formulated the most gorgeous collection of sounds ever recorded and jammed it into one song. I‚Äôm such a sucker for Can‚Äôt Help Falling In Love, and then also the Pachelbel‚Äôs canon progression, the stunning multitracking, the choral vocals AND the beautiful spacey atmospherics hitting me while I‚Äôm still obsessed with that latest Avalanches album which did a lot of this sound. I‚Äôm just genuinely in awe. This is jawdropping. I‚Äôm adding this album to my next up list straight away

**celladonn** (10): Interpolating Can't Help Falling In Love might be a cheap trick but when it works it works

**esskeetitli** (10): This one was very pretty and haunting in a weird way. One of my favorite discoveries from this rate.

**ExtraEater** (10): Yes we are

**fadedblue09** (10): Don't you just love songs that sound exactly like their titles suggest?

**Flegasaurus** (10): brb lemme cry

**ggal2020** (10): How have I never heard this song before?? This is incredible

**Gonza\_90** (10): Simply beatiful

**izeasklapaucius** (10): the best can't help falling in love cover ever

**lagozzino** (10): Oh wow now this is the reason to do rates; to stumble across absolute gems like this

**ManofOranges** (10): Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's characters in Gravity

**moonagenightmares** (10): soooo fucking gooooooddddd

**musical\_pyn** (10): such a simple concept executed perfectly

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): This gonna go out Day 2 because of ballad-phobia but I loved it. Maybe I‚Äôm just biased towards sad songs idk

**runaway3212** (10): this is so immensly pretty and fun

**sirpancakeXI** (10): BOP

**TiltControls** (10): after listening to this for the rate I couldn't get it out of my head for like a month

**Zi99yStardust** (10): An epic, ethereal masterpiece that could feasibly be the soundtrack to a scifi opera (indeed the whole album could be)

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Will popheads be tricked into giving a ballad a high score with the Pachelbel chord progression and an allusion to a pop song? Anyway, I love this. Gorgeous and ethereal.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): pretty strange song but i really dig it

**wavingwolves** (9.5): ok but the way we are actually floating in space rn

**Vike\_Me** (9.1): Just, the title. That's all the analysis needed for this gem.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Thank you for flying KM air, we hope you've had a pleasant flight!

**hepmeucsb** (9): Oh god, I can really only think of Pachelbel‚Äôs Canon when I hear this, was that intentional? Regardless, it‚Äôs a fascinating song. Wait, did they also sample Elvis? Wild.

**Iris3271** (9): Very serene, I enjoyed it

**timothy444** (9): For a 90s song, this sounds modern af

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): I would not listen to this again cause it feels really emotional but i do enjoy it

**ashandimlotion** (8.5): a friend once played can‚Äôt help falling in love on the piano to me and I thought she had written it

**EnCaine** (8.5): i think i've heard of this record before but never listened to it. this is neat

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I'll give them credit, it does make you feel like you're floating in space

**zagreux** (8.5): this needs an extended version

**jman457** (8.1): quality song, but I think im in love takes a dump on it.

**Stryxen** (8.1): it‚Äôs simply too much

**Alumineous** (8): Is this just a existential version of Canon in D?

**babygrillx** (8): so dreamy so sad

**CrimsonROSET** (8): left side is a 7, right side is a 9, round ‚Äòem up

**endcreditouilles** (8): ngl I really love the Can't Help Falling In Love mashup.

**frogaranaman** (8): I appreciate how the song "Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space" from the album "Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space" opens with the line "Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space".

**jasannn** (8): Ladies and gentlemen, Her.

**jsonphile** (8): I‚Äôve heard so many lame boring covers of Can‚Äôt Help Falling in Love so to hear someone actually do something interesting with it gets a thumbs up from me

**LesApfels** (8): So ethereal

**seanderlust** (8): what up pachabel

**SmileAndTears** (8): Good but a little bit repetitive

**steamedasparagus** (8): ladies and gentlemen we come to number 11 of the songs I already had saved

**txrxwxwx** (8): beach house, but in an alternate universe

**Vromega** (8): this is cute. It makes me think of Pachelbel canon

**notdallin** (7.8): i actually liked this genius annotation more than the actual song (hopefully nobody else plagiarized it here like i‚Äôm doing): ‚ÄúSome people live an ordinary life ‚Äî go to work, mow the lawn, take the bins out, look after the kids. And they‚Äôre perfectly happy. But what the song‚Äôs title, intro, and the original quote are getting at is that if you stop to think for a moment, everything about life is mind-bogglingly absurd. We are sentient bundles of meat, driving around in vehicles fuelled by long-dead animals and plants, existing on a massive chunk of rock and iron, floating around a nuclear fusion reactor in a physically-unknowable universe that contains more stars than all the grains of sand you could ever collect, and all of that could just be a minuscule ripple in a higher-dimension existence we could never hope to even begin to comprehend, like an ant crawling on the side of the Empire State Building.‚Äù

**officialged** (7.8): Mesmerizing, such an interesting juxtaposition of the two different songs. Unsettling in a good way.

**bbfan132** (7.5): i respect this but it feels kind of one-note to me :/ i definitely think it‚Äôs pretty though

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i think i expected a little more from this but it‚Äôs still very dreamy

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this reminds me of that commercial that was a bunch of people singing that one song that goes ‚Äúboom de yada, boom de yada, boom de yada, boom de yada‚Äù

**jajarepelotud0** (7.5): The atmosphere (pun intended) of the song is on point. Also, I love the album cover.

**useless-sheep** (7.5): title spilled
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt6r23s/]

=====

steelstepladder: **insertusernameheree** (7): kind of sounds like what I feel like floating away in space would feel like, don't know if that's good or bad lol

**whizzer0** (7): atmospheric

**wryn\_** (7): cant imagine this opening an album but its very cool

**rickikardashian** (6.9): i dont feel like im sad enough to appreciate this fully

**Arybeck67** (6.8): not a bad song, but I kept waiting for it to go wild and it never did.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): is this not just pachelbel‚Äôs canon with space noises

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.3): I was hovering around 3 at the beginning

**slimboyfriend** (6.1): It's nice but it's barely a song

**Kardif** (6): got bored again

**RandomHypnotica** (6): To their credit, it DOES sound like we're floating in space. Unfortunately for them, I find space boring

**ReallyCreative** (6): The Sound & Color music video by Alabama Shakes completely outsold, absolutely lapped this song

**Sypher32** (5.5): Good use of samples (i.e. something I recognize :p)

**bespectacIed** (5): cool cover art

**vayyiqra** (5): This is Major Tom to Ground Control / I'm stepping through the door / And I'm floating in a most peculiar way song I would rather be rating than this one which is kind of pretty but also sadly a little boring

**booksandplantsand** (4): grimes is gonna walk down the aisle to this

**gileswithachainsaw** (3): As a former wedding violinist, anything that references Pachelbel's Canon activates my fight or flight response and gets an automatic low score. Apologies to Spiritualized; I don't actually hate them.

**nice-cat** (3): it‚Äôs not a terrible song but I really can‚Äôt wrap my head around what y‚Äôall‚Äôre getting out of it.

**NotWith10000Men** (3): canon in d gives you the same experience but it's actually good (rip to cello players)

**pig-serpent** (3): hmm I was expecting something a lot trippier. As it is it's pretty boring.

**proscett** (3): i want to like this song but simply cannot, it is sonically rather rotten

**2dina3dworld** (0): the continued, overdrawn references to Can‚Äôt Help Falling in Love with You and the mind numbing repetition made this a very easy one.

**fkadizzy-1804** (0): This dethroned Arcade Fire for my 0. Originally I was gonna give it a low score, label it a pompous snoozefest, and move on, but on repeated listens I just hated it more. And unlike Arcade Fire, not even the instrumentals are enjoyable, so, 0 it is.

**rslashpoopheads** (0): Pachelbel's Canon but make it insufferably pretentious and sublimely irritating

**trashypanini** (0): tried to go for orchestral spacey tale and I was bored. Don‚Äôt like the way the vocal is mixed

What a jaunty romp this is! I' kind of surprised this straddled the line between day one and two for so long considering Parquet Courts aren't really a name over here on popheads but I think it did pretty well for itself. While some songs struggled because they weren't overly loved, this song really benefitted from being just a solid bop that no one really hated.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A bop. This beat is amazing.

**bbfan132** (10): one of my favorite discoveries so far, love the guitar and the lead singer‚Äôs vocals

**bespectacIed** (10): So glad we're rating an actual good, popular wide awake song, and not total football. Big ball of good vibes

**celladonn** (10): Bop, that piano melody is so good

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's fun, but... pollinating my peers? Ok.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I love how discordant the bright piano and the angsty lyrics are

**engifear** (10): I‚Äôve talked about some of the other songs on this rate being pretentious and this one is also pretentious, I‚Äôll admit that. However! This song slaps!

**fadedblue09** (10): This one's so folky and quirky at the same time, I love it. There's some pretentious lyrics but I can overlook it.

**frogaranaman** (10): Stan Parquet fucking Courts! Oh my god, this album is one of my favorites. And while I would have chosen "Berlin Got Blurry" if I had full control of this playlist, "Tenderness" is such a quality song that I can't even get mad at this. 

 Also, fuck Tom Brady.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): damn this song about how this planet and all of us are dying makes me wanna do a jig

**insertusernameheree** (10): this song made me soooo happy :)

**izeasklapaucius** (10): it's just so effective as a closer to the whole wide awake album. love that album and this song so much.

**jajarepelotud0** (10): I don't know what this genre is called, but I sure love it!

**just\_thonking** (10): I've played this like 40 times since I heard it for the first time last week. The bouncy piano, the catchy chorus, the pithy lyrics that lament the state of the world yet ultimately remain optimistic. It's all just chef's kiss

**NotWith10000Men** (10): oh fuck yes this is groovy and he has a distinctive voice

**TheEvilNightman** (9.8): Two words: Hipster Optimism

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): this is kinda corny but i like it

**Vike\_Me** (9.1): That piano just comes in at the perfect time and its prominence is appreciated by my ears. Pairs well with the brusque vocals.

**camerinian** (9): This is an absolute fucking banger of an album. Don't really know why this song was the one to take off from it but I very much don't mind.

**ggal2020** (9): omg I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been sleeping on Parquet Courts this whole time. This song is like my favorite parts of classic rock and indie combined

**gileswithachainsaw** (9): I've been meaning to listen to this band for a while and this was a great introduction. Really enjoyable.

**hepmeucsb** (9): What a lovely piano melody! I love this funky little song.

**seanderlust** (9): they put crack in the piano hook

**txrxwxwx** (9): walking down the street, boppin' along, main character vibes

**waluigiest** (9): love this voice wow

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.9): I'm such a sucker for a nice bass line. It's the kind of simple song that has you moving your head, I dig it

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.8): I just wanna bottle this song and save it for a chill summer afternoon then serve it up alongside some gin and orange juice out on my balcony

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): this is very fun and I really like the vocal delivery

**Flipping\_Whales** (8.5): how can I immediately tell they're from New York City

**jman457** (8.5): love the Elton John feels with this

**nice-cat** (8.5): Parquet Courts is another band I‚Äôve been meaning to check out for years and just never got around to. This is a fun song! Something about the piano on the chorus feels a little Elton John-y? There aren‚Äôt enough songs with a catchy little piano line like that anymore!

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Talking Heads meets Lynyrd Skynyrd?!

**Stryxen** (8.2): ended too soon!!!!!!

**booksandplantsand** (8): wait this is...upbeat? and fun? indieheads are u okay

**cremeebrulee** (8): cute, love the piano

**CrimsonROSET** (8): come on piano that sounds like a banjo that sounds like a piano no really what is it i‚Äôm going insane

**Flegasaurus** (8): yeah it's pretty good

**Kardif** (8): fun piano and guitar not the best vocals

**rickikardashian** (8): i feel like this could have fit somewhere in the movie Cars

**steamedasparagus** (8): is there a mrs. parquet courts or is the position available?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): cute but wished for a bit more

**jasannn** (7.5): Quirkness in song form

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I like the riff on this, and it has a nice groove, but I wish it had an ending.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): The lead singer's voice feels like it doesn't work with the instrumental? Idk, it just doesn't work for me

Arcade Fire were always one of the most obvious choices for this list from the very begining. It was pretty much in this spot from the beginning to end with no real major shake ups or negative love thrown towards it. For such an iconic indie act there wasn't much talk about this song in the discord or anything which makes the end of day one spot feel apropriate.

---

**Alumineous** (10): This rate made me like Funeral. See, I listened to it a few months ago, never really clicked for me. Personally, I wouldn't say this is my favorite Neighbourhood track, but it's still pretty awesome.

**celladonn** (10): classic!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I was once told I looked like a member of Arcade Fire and I haven't recovered since. The last minute of the song is incredible.

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): really nice imagery and buildup, it has the energy of a romcom (disclaimer I have never watched a romcom)

**frogaranaman** (10): This is the obvious Arcade Fire choice, but I am quite partial to "Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)" because god DAMN, that track goes in.

**ggal2020** (10): If the third best song titled Tunnels on one album is a 10, you know it‚Äôs a good album.

**ManofOranges** (10): I can dig this one!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Arcade Fire were absolutely amazing at their peak and this is definitely a standout track. An absolutely amazing way to start their debut album, it's a classic right from the get-go.

**TiltControls** (10): can we still rate Funeral someday though? I need to give Wake Up and Rebellion my love

**txrxwxwx** (10): go Canada go

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this album in a way that you can never understand if you don't know what a Canadian winter is like.

**wryn\_** (10): i feel bad for artists who so obviously peak with their first song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.6): Canada rights

**bbfan132** (9.5): i can‚Äôt quite give it a 10 but i really like how the song progressed

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): I love the oohs at the end

**notdallin** (9.4): a suburban life cycle never spoken more perfectly than from the grand opening of a landmark indie rock album; neighborhoods are buried, the adults cry, the youth rendezvous, and give birth to another generation of children who build tunnels to hide from their parents. the bass echos, the piano twinkles, and the cycle continues on

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.1): One of my favorite AF songs, I love how it climbs to the climax

**avg-vag** (9): CINEMATIC AF

**cremeebrulee** (9): me on a megaphone: WE WANT TO RATE THE SUBURBS!!!!

**fadedblue09** (9): I'm glad I gave this another listen because this grew on me a lot! There's definitely a climactic feel here. Still not fond of the vocals though.

**Gonza\_90** (9): Funeral is an amazing album and Arcade Fire was my favorite band during my hipster era.

**insertusernameheree** (9): this song feels like autumn lol

**sirpancakeXI** (9): really liking the instrumental of this song

**SmileAndTears** (9): TOK√âBAKICITTE

**jman457** (8.9): iconic start to an iconic album

**camerinian** (8.5): Jesus christ the swell on this thing is so gorgeous. This is what the best indie rock of the period was so unbelievably good at

**nt96** (8.5): Great song. The album never clicked with me and I never knew why.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Arcade Fire has always a band that on paper, I should love. Unfortunately, I do not but this is pretty great.

**timothy444** (8.5): Nice

**1998tweety** (8): the voice is a bit offputting at points but I like the rest

**buddhacharm** (8): Ah throwback to when Arcade Fire was arguably the most critically acclaimed band of all time‚Ä¶the way they nosedived into an indie laughingstock so suddenly is kinda crazy actually

**Flegasaurus** (8): i think im in my indieheads era

**hepmeucsb** (8): Very coming-of-age feeling, and I really liked it.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this sounds like the plot of an Ed Edd N Eddy fanfiction

**jasannn** (8): One thing indie songs have going for them is that they almost always have great outros.

**just\_thonking** (8): Arcade Fire is so consistently good at evoking this really specific feeling of -- I don't even know what to call it -- maybe grand pensiveness? That being said, I think other AF songs create that feeling more effectively.

**musical\_pyn** (8): just a really solid progression and climax

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): It kinda makes me feel nostalgic in a weird way, I like it

**plastichaxan** (8): i can't explain what it is but there's something about music that sounds like this that makes me feel like i'm travelling somewhere i don't know yet

**seanderlust** (8): me having no idea what this guy is talking about in the song: so true bestie

**Stryxen** (8): I try to get into arcade fire a lot but always just end up listening to the suburbs instead (a 10)

**Uberpigeon** (8): if they'd have chosen Sprawl II it would have been my eleven üòî

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is fine but a thing I‚Äôm noticing with indie songs is that the vocals are always mixed lower than the band.... you need that balance or else it just is loud and messy. This is good tho

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): shoutouts to that last piano driving the song out

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This song grows like crazy and turns into something really special by the end, even if I don't like the vocals too much.

**Arybeck67** (7.3): a solid song, but a problem I‚Äôve had in this rate is honestly how long the intros are on all of these songs. While playing these by themselves wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, in this rate structure, it‚Äôs causing me to get bored far too easy and give songs lower scores. I love long songs, but having such a high volume in this rate is really affecting me.

**zagreux** (7.2): The intro wasn't nice but it got better after that

chug-a-lug-donna: probably... as a bit of an *everything now* apologist, i really think a lot of the backlash was due to the material being low for arcade fire standards. if you haven't established a love of early arcade fire, it's probably easier to hear "everything now" as a "bop" or whatever

Tadevos: "Tunnels" is "Arcade Fire: The Song" to a lot of us, me included, in large part because it opens *Funeral,* and since *Funeral* has a pretty legit claim to *Indie Rock: The Album,* well...

WaneLietoc: this is a TRUTH.

my hot take is that by opening the debut arcade fire album with tunnels, they shot themselves in the foot...its too good of a thesis statement to base your band around but they got at least six years of it!

The power of Taylor! Genuinely think Folklore had a good impact on the placement of this song but whether it was positive or negative was anyones guess. Bloodbuzz straddled the line between day one and day two for the majority of the rate and ended up falling just short but, but it made a respectable enough run seeing as it only recieved one 11.

---

**shhhneak** (11): This sounds like it‚Äôs from a nostalgic coming-of-age movie and that genre just gives me that (blood)buzz.

**2dina3dworld** (10): This slaps, it gave off very solemn vibes but at the same time, it moved along at a nice pace.

**bbfan132** (10): matt‚Äôs voice is heavenly

**chilipeepers** (10): , one of my favorite The National songs from my very first album of theirs that I listened to. High Violet snapped!

**cremeebrulee** (10): i might have to check out more of the national between me rly liking this and folklore/evermore

**endcreditouilles** (10): these strings and this build oof I love this one

**frogaranaman** (10): Matt Berninger is allowed to absolutely destroy me based off of his voice alone.

**ManofOranges** (10): Sorry to make a comment that brings up Taylor, but she made not one but TWO albums with the guy from this band and they couldn't even come up with a single song like this?? Inchresting...

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): Ugh the instrumental is so good it makes me feel things

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I ADORE the lyricism on this song, the way it builds is amazing, and that chrous is so euphoric, Matt's vocals are incredibly mesmerising as well, it's just a wonderful song

**rickikardashian** (10): i was told taylor swift‚Äôs friend made this song but this isnt produced by jack antonoff:////

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): "I still owe money to the money to the money I owe" me collecting interest on my student loans

**skargardin** (10): definitely saving this entire album for later, this slaps

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): one of the ntl's best songs

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.8): "I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe " is, sadly, one of the most relatable lyrics that Matt has ever sung. "I never thought about love when I thought about home" funnily hits home too lol. Also, the drumming slaps hard

**1998tweety** (9.5): this is really nice oh wow

**seanderlust** (9.5): i'm so glad that folklore didn't win the ultimate rate so i don't have to pretend like i'm not obsessed with the national during this rate. i am a boxer supremacist, but a high violet banger i will take. good work indieheads.

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Hating myself for finding his voice sexy, "I'm better than this" I say to the bathroom mirror, voice cracking, knowing full well that I am not better than thirsting after a daddy baritone.

**babygrillx** (9): wow that taylor swift collaborator sure makes some good music!!

**camerinian** (9): Hello I‚Äôm a Gang of Youths simp, If you enjoyed this song please listen to Go Farther In Lightness by Gang of Youths. It is this sound with some of the most heart-meltingly beautiful lyrics and melodies ever put to record. I also love The National but I‚Äôm just taking this slot to preach ok thanks in advance

**EnCaine** (9): popheads don't mention taylor swift challenge

**gwenflip** (9): Thank u aaron

**jsonphile** (9): wow it‚Äôs the guys who did the song with Taylor (I‚Äôm kidding please don‚Äôt attack me indieheads)

**NotWith10000Men** (9): his voice is neat and I like the driving drums

**runaway3212** (9): I love taylor swift

**SmileAndTears** (9): Not to be horny on main but can he f**k me with his voice? Is that possible?

**whizzer0** (9): I love I Am Easy To Find but haven't listened to too much of their older stuff... I can definitely see what the fuss is about though

**wryn\_** (9): taylor snapped writing the lyrics to this one

**Arybeck67** (8.7): I‚Äôm a sucker for any The National track and the drums on this song are just killer.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Giving points for the euphoric instrumentals

**Kardif** (8.5): lyrics are hilarious

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): mood!

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): this should have been walking on a string :^(((

**notdallin** (8.3): for many of you, this is likely your first experience of The National outside of Taylor Swift collaborations. If this is the case, please go listen to their 2007 album Boxer and get back to me; I wish I could listen to that record for the first time again...

**bigbigbee** (8): I really like bees. I think they‚Äôre cute. A swarm of them that could carry you places would be extra cute.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): my shitpost was gonna be that one ajayii clip where she‚Äôs surprised by the rough voice but then i realized that is bon iver and he is NOT a member of the national

**Flipping\_Whales** (8): I think a lot about the fact that I know my English teacher stans the National and it makes me uncomfortable knowing our music tastes intersect

**hepmeucsb** (8): Loved the instrumental here, not entirely sure what a bloodbuzz is, but it sounds terrible.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why didn‚Äôt this man bring this exciting production for Folklore smh. Too bad his voice is just not it for me, this would be a higher score otherwise

**ImADudeDuh** (8): omg is this the ‚Äúdifferent kind of buzz‚Äù lorde was singing about? üòçüòçüòçüòç

**insertusernameheree** (8): I want to swim in the singer's voice

**jajarepelotud0** (8): I like The National, I discovered them thanks to their song with Taylor (can you tell I'm a r/popheads user?)

**lolcevan** (8): i already see the swifties claiming this one

**nice-cat** (8): does anyone else remember a cover of this song by Oh Land that was going around tumblr back in the day? I like that one a little better tbh

**txrxwxwx** (8): rich, deep vocals

**Vromega** (8): really enjoyed the atmosphere of this song (lovely MV too), vocals lack some emotion though, his voice is a bit too linear compared to the instrumentals

**waluigiest** (8): folklore AOTY

**wavingwolves** (8): i thought bees were going extinct but if they're carrying people to ohio i guess it's okay now

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): ; You know why this stands out because Matt has an interesting voice which you can‚Äôt say about a lot of the male singers in this rate.

**Zi99yStardust** (8): The National is the type of band I love but have never been able to get into - something about the lead singer's voice - but this song has convinced me to check out more

**moonagenightmares** (7.7): cherry tree is their best song I‚Äôm just taking this opportunity to promote it

**trashypanini** (7.5): Love Matt‚Äôs deep rich baritone voice. So yearning and full of emotion. The beat and all else is simple and a bit generic 10s rock but works well enough.

**useless-sheep** (7.4): dad music but yassified

**jman457** (7.3): I can appreciate the artistry, but I never really been a fan of Matt Berninger's voice

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): Isn't this that band that Taylor Swift started? This song is pretty good, but where's Taylor?

steelstepladder: **BBthebest22** (7): I‚Äôm no National fan but I like this

**booksandplantsand** (7): okay FINE good even without taylor i guess

**engifear** (7): I like the National, but this one‚Äôs kinda boring compared to the songs I like by them

**musical\_pyn** (7): oh to be carried to ohio in a swarm of bees

**Roxieloxie** (7): oh are these those guys on that taylor album i havent listened to ? nice

**timothy444** (7): Discount version of the xx

**Uberpigeon** (7): daddy

**vayyiqra** (7): Omg I love how Soofyan writes music about different states in America

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This one's fine‚Ñ¢ too I guess.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): It grows towards the end, but it's still very middle of the road.

**Flegasaurus** (6): not feeling it mr krabs

**morgchrist** (6): ugh this whole album is so fucking boring, esp sandwiched between their two best albums!

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): i can only get into this guy‚Äôs voice for certain songs...cherry tree >>

**gileswithachainsaw** (5.2): My taste in music is better than Taylor Swift's.

**esskeetitli** (5): This would have been lower, as his voice is absolutely unbearable, but the instrumental is alright.

**bulforster** (4.5): He sounds more bored than buzzed.

**targetguest** (4.5): I like this person better on Taylor tracks

**officialged** (4.3): I didn't get the appeal here, and I guess I'm not enjoying his singing approach; some elements of the song are nice, but overall I didn't care for it that much.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): I don‚Äôt what to say about this one so I‚Äôll just say ‚Äúindie‚Äù

**ashandimlotion** (4): fuck you taylor swift

**Sypher32** (4): forgettable

**bespectacIed** (2): i would have listened to the National more if matt's voice were juuust 2 keys higher

**zagreux** (1): this song could've been great had not these men bored me to death with their sleepyhead voices

**proscett** (0): i'm not old nor sad enough to appreciate this

**Stryxen** (0): this song is as bland as ohio

This one hurts me. This was in the top 10 for a while before plummeting in the last two days of scores as the fact this this was seven and a half minutes really hurt its chances. But I don't care, I'm gonna gush about what this song mean to me and how it was robbed so strap in. In terms of capturing a singular human experience, deeply and meaningfully the only song that I can think comes even close to this song is Fast Car by Tracy Chapman. But where as Fast Car is about desiring more and trying to find the courage to experience that, All My Friends is about settling down into a life that you know you're happy and satisfied with but losing the people that have made you the person you are in the process. 

I left college last year. I have two close friends and they are both hours away from me. They both have their own careers and they've done a great job at being able to maintain them throughout the pandemic. Due to this I've seen them three weekends in the past year. We all have our own seperate lives and have been living seperate lives for a bit now. "You spend the five five years trying to get with the plan, and the next five years trying to be with your friends again." It's a line that kinda speaks for itself but man it hits hard when you're living it. And while All My Friends captures these moments well, what it really hits better than any song or any piece of media I've ever heard is the distance you feel between each other. When you reunite there's a feeling that you don't know the person as well as you one did. There's a feeling that all the moments in the past year that meant the most to you, they didn't go through and experienced. Not saying you've grown apart nececarilly but you're not the people you were a year ago. Even if it means you can't drink as much as you used to or you can't stay up as long as you used to because you've settled into your daily routine, theres an attempt to recapture the feelings you've had with your old friends that you can't recapture because you simply have different lives. "I wouldn't trade one stupid decision for another five years of life" hits totally different when you realize that your most interesting and exciting moments you've spent together might be behind you. When he screams at the end "If I can see all my friends tonight" over and over again he's not just saying he wishes he had friends in the same numbers as he used to, but he's wishing he could still have the moments he used to with his friends. The new moments, the exciting moments, which might still happen but you know deep down the majority of them are in the past if for no other reason then you just don't spend the time together you used to. It's one of the only songs I've ever heard to perfectly capture that feeling and more than worthy of my 11. Sorry if this is overly sentimental and long and rambly but man, some songs deserve the deeper analysis. I was fine until this, this is wrong.

**izeasklapaucius** (11): no hetero but i love murphy's lyics and vocals performance in this song so much. i literally cried the first time i heard this. lcd soundsystem aren't my fav band but i will cherish this song for the rest of my life.

**Flegasaurus** (10): my bestie played lcd soundsystem for me one day and i've been hooked ever since!! i have a feeling poopheads is gonna sleep on this though :(

**Flipping\_Whales** (10): when I was 15 I tried to convince the teachers I sought validation from that I was mature by trying to act like a depressed middle-aged white man and I constantly had this album on repeat to maintain the mood

**frogaranaman** (10): The piano line is so simple but it's so fucking fun to play. It's a good chord to repeat over and over and over and over and over and over and over and-

**gwenflip** (10): I really love LCD Soundsystem, I‚Äôm so excited to move to NYC this summer so I can mope around my tiny apartment on a rainy day and listen to New York I Love You But You‚Äôre Bringing Me Down

**notdallin** (10): Everyone (yes, even you gen z popheads) will have their ‚ÄúAll My Friends‚Äù moment. And likely sooner--and more abruptly--than you expect. As you live your life in five year increments, all of sudden one day, you‚Äôll feel behind. Somehow the last five years where you felt that the world was catering to you will become passe; you‚Äôll check the top 40 and not recognize anything there; and your newsfeed will just be full of marriage announcements and baby photos. ‚ÄúYou spent the first five years trying to get with the plan and the next five years trying to be with your friends again.‚Äù But ‚ÄúAll My Friends‚Äù is not just a promise, but a remedy, to help you never forget that you shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äútrade one stupid decision for another five years of life.‚Äù

**proscett** (10): music to have a midlife crisis to

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Who knew 2 chords was all it took to make a career defining song?

**ReallyCreative** (10): seven and a half minutes of that little piano thing is a lot to ask for but you know what? I think the payoff is worth it

**rslashpoopheads** (10): absolutely obsessed with this

**shhhneak** (10): this is kind of a masterpiece right?

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I'm in my last semester of college and this song is about to hit way harder...

**TiltControls** (10): another long song that well earns its runtime

**timothy444** (10): Eight minutes worth of epicness. Almost as good as Owl City's All My Friends

**Zi99yStardust** (10): Classic LCD Soundsystem, this song just makes me want to forget all my worries, get up and dance

**Alumineous** (9.9): Some say they're still playing that piano key/chord to this day.

**TheEvilNightman** (9.7): I'm only 19 and yet I still relate to this track about what I assume is from the perspective of a middle-aged man looking back at his life.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): that‚Äôs a build-up, baybeeee

**ashandimlotion** (9): mr soundsystem why are you trying to make me cry

**bulforster** (9): I'm listening to this the night before seeing some friends I haven't spoken to in a while and boy is it hitting.

**camerinian** (9): I haven't really liked most of what I've heard from LCD Soundsystem, but honestly this is so fucking up my alley that's it's not fair. The line about not wanting to trade one stupid decision for another five years of life sucker punched me in the gut. Welcome to the new sincere motherfuckers.

**nice-cat** (9): the slow build on this is just so good! there are so many songs that try to capture similar feelings about getting older, but so few songs that do it so well.

**seanderlust** (9): i love this song and LCD Soundsystem so much. the song really hits different after you graduate college and lose touch with friends

**Stryxen** (9): my straight cosplay era

**whizzer0** (9): yeah I definitely need to listen to more of their stuff

**Arybeck67** (8.7): Wow that opener was magnificent. This is a bop and a half, but this isn‚Äôt higher since I‚Äôm too creeped out by how much this reminds me of U2.

**trashypanini** (8.5): big millennial disillusioned energy. Definitely in the Happysad music canon.

**jman457** (8.4): LCD soundystem bops more than any Katy Perry song, I said it.

steelstepladder: **azurepatrocleia** (8): what a climax

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://open.spotify.com/track/3ArdPRbscsYB2uI70AzpuG?si=Ui6iAiCmRG6_9seJtTHH7g

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I'm actually frustrated with great instrumentals ruined by shitty men opening their mouths.

**nootnoot781** (8): i feel so bad because i'm just like hey this is good!! when it seems that everybody else thinks it's a life changing piece of music oops. maybe it'll hit me later hmm

**pig-serpent** (8): This band (yes I know it's one guy, shut up) is normally really boring so I was expecting this to be low score fodder, but curse you indieheads this song is actually really good.

**Roxieloxie** (8): throwback to when we did the listening party in kosmi and steel was like 'this song makes me sad because its about getting older and not seeing your friends as much' and then everyone just got collectively sad about various topics for like 8 minutes and it was like a group vent therapy session

**steamedasparagus** (8): bodys but worse. so many people have told me to listen to this...

**Sypher32** (8): Solid. Hardly even noticed it was seven and a half minutes

**vayyiqra** (8): Oh, yet another long repetitive song from Indieheads. I guess it's not bad. [Edit: this is great in fact but Popheads won't like it because the lyrics are about aging, which is Popheads' greatest fear, other than Ed Sheeran.]

**waluigiest** (8): neat but why do they always mix the vocals so quiet

**wavingwolves** (8): this is just ribs by lorde for people in their middle twenties and above

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is good but there‚Äôs something missing from it being amazing

**Vike\_Me** (7.6): Love the intro, but it actually loses me midway through.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): lcd soundsystem haven't really clicked~ for me yet but i'm trying

**txrxwxwx** (7.5): v summer music festival but I was becoming uninterested by the 6th minute

**lolcevan** (7.4): this score is one point for each minute of song there was

**babygrillx** (7): climax where?? but cute

**fkadizzy-1804** (7): I liked parts of this a lot, especially the building layers of guitar and the subtle changes in the beat/groove and how that evolved the Vibe throughout, but something about the piano track in the first 3-4 minutes just felt like a drill going into my brain and made it a real chore to listen to the whole way through

**moooo566** (7): this would make a really good 4 minute song (true of a lot of this rate but especially here)

**musical\_pyn** (7): this grew on me with every listen, so good job!

**SmileAndTears** (7): I like the lyrics but song itself is a bit too static(?)

**targetguest** (7): this was one of two atists I knew of on the entire playlist going in because I went to NYU and roomed with an acting major that cried to New York I Love You, But You're Bringing Me Down

**zagreux** (7): omg relatable

**plastichaxan** (6.8): this had the reverse effect of some songs...started out strong and then just plain

**Kardif** (6.5): fine, not exciting

**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): It‚Äôs basic but I like the instrumental

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): It's okay but in the end that constant tune got quite annoying

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): this didn‚Äôt do anything for me

**hepmeucsb** (6): LCD sweetie, I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶.

**sirpancakeXI** (6): this is unnecessarily long without any changes during the song

**esskeetitli** (5.5): Why is it so goddamn long?

**gileswithachainsaw** (5.3): I would probably like this more if it were shorter. I have nothing against long songs, but they need to go somewhere interesting. This is pleasant enough, but just wears out its welcome.

**officialged** (5.1): The song seemed too plain to keep interest for this long... I've heard better LCD Soundsystem songs, like Oh Baby.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (5): Meh

**engifear** (5): I enjoy long songs, but this one just gets repetitive SO quickly and lasts much longer than it should. It would probably be an 8 if they just cut out 2 minutes.

**jajarepelotud0** (5): Call me basic, but I think some of these songs are unnecessaryly long

**jasannn** (5): Will the keyboard ever shut up?

**jayjaysortagay** (5): too repetitive

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this is fine

**veryanniev** (5): How do you write such great lyrics but put it together with one of the the most monotonous melodies I've ever heard?

**Vromega** (5): this song is just a tuning fork. A keyboard has more than one note

**Iris3271** (4.5): Too long

**AHSWeeknd** (4): The instruments drown out the vocals, no wonder they put captions on the video

**brenda\_official** (4): inferior version of Home

**pat-rickstar** (4): This just‚Ä¶ keeps going and going doesn't it

**runaway3212** (4): I wish this was 4 minutes shorter so I'm giving it a 4

**useless-sheep** (4): waited for a climax for nearly 8 mins and nothing happened... building to nothing only works if you're mitski and your songs are 3 minutes

**skargardin** (3): this constant piano is driving me crazy

**moonagenightmares** (2): annoying asf

**fadedblue09** (1): The synths are giving me a headache help

**1998tweety** (0): Tinashe ended ha effortlessly

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I hate LCD Soundsystem so much and I can‚Äôt explain it. Fuck you, LCD Soundsystem. https://i.imgur.com/kUF1Xo9.gif

**mudkip1** (0): i have an irrational distaste for LCD soundsystem

**NotWith10000Men** (0): did the piano section need to go on that long and be that high in the mix? All I can hear is that damn piano even after everything else comes in

zenits: might as well post how i would‚Äôve rated songs as an indiehead compared to what got eliminated. tldr: my 10s got massacred pretty badly 

* 11: shut up kiss me
* 10: ~~get me away from here i‚Äôm dying, when you sleep, alison, ladies and gentlemen we‚Äôre floating in space~~, in undertow, lazuli, heaven or las vegas, helplessness blues, everybody wants to love you, only acting
* 9: ~~sunglasses, i‚Äôve seen footage, all my friends~~, how simple, disorder, time to pretend, age of consent, maps
* 8: ~~neighbourhood #1, not~~, on the floor, casimir pulaski day, gospel for a new century
* 7: ~~fireworks, he would‚Äôve laughed, holland 1945, wolf like me~~, bodys, once in a lifetime 
* 6: ~~bmbmbm~~, heat wave
* 5: ~~tenderness, teenage riot~~
* 4: ~~i want wind to blow~~, between the bars
* 3: ~~idioteque~~, jesus etc
* 2: ~~gold soundz~~
* 0: ~~bloodbuzz ohio~~

dr6unx: Unbelievable lmao, popheads please get an attention span

=====

kappyko: as heart attack inducing as it is to see a lot of the low comments, a lot of the high comments whether it's people with actual connections to the songs or people discovering something they really like is very nice
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt70739/]

=====

Vike_Me: I feel decent with eight of my 9+ songs left. Really think In Undertow, How Simple or Once in a Lifetime have good chances at being in the top 10. Holding out for Heat Waves as well.

Still not happy about Gold Soundz and Ladies and Gentlemen, we are Floating in Space getting shafted tho. Some of y'alls taste is just...

k11ngcoulee: mourning sunglasses üò≠ popheads long-song-phobic
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt72thm/]

=====

deleted: Popheads hate a song if:

- it‚Äôs long

- it‚Äôs below 120 BPM

- it‚Äôs a ballad

- it‚Äôs by a cishet man that is not The Weeknd
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt81hk2/]

lastfollower: And "long" means over 4 minutes and even that might be pushing it

dr6unx: Isaac Wood didn‚Äôt have a dream about Charli XCX for you to treat sunglasses like this

dr6unx: [I have this dream about charli XCX.](https://youtu.be/7l2G86KmFXE) basketball shoes is genuinely one of the best songs I‚Äôve heard in a very long time
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt7ox7x/]

=====

Tadevos: Ooooooh wait no I've promised not to listen to this song so as to not "Sunglasses" myself and get hooked on a non-album version.  Appreciate the nod, though.

dr6unx: Ahhh, respect. You‚Äôve got more self control than I. Been overplaying this one and snowglobes for well over a year now

=====

pig-serpent: Ok I expected this rate to showcase a lack of taste but I was caught off guard by the "putting one of my favorite songs ever at #39/40" lack of taste.

Teenage Riot did better than I expect though.

alexpiercey: If nothing else, it‚Äôs heartwarming to know that regardless of which sub is doing the rate, I‚Äôll still get embarrassingly pissed off either way :)

simonthedlgger: Yeah, where are the results? I clicked the Kosmi link, whatever that is, and I'm in some kind of live chat, stuck on "Loading Media."

edit: ok I figured out the Internet

a_gallon_of_pcp: Ok can you explain it to the people who maybe haven‚Äôt figured out the internet
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt8znbw/]

=====

natchymon: idk about the links but you can find a comment by OP that says #40-21. For some reason it has like zero upvotes though. I filtered comments from oldest to newest and found it after scrolling some.

simonthedlgger: Yep that's what I meant/did.

rickikardashian: Kosmi was the website we originally were playing on playing the songs as they got revealed, but then it crashed completely and we had to move to beatsense

simonthedlgger: ooh cool I didn‚Äôt know there was a listening portion, I just thought the results got posted

rickikardashian: Yeah haha, it's fun to get people's live reactions to the results (and their reaction to the shitposts that get played in between)
[/r/popheads/comments/mir2ot/indieheads_exchange_reveal_day_1_she_gives_0s/gt9g2iv/]

rickikardashian: Hey. The reveal is not over, so in this thread you'll only be able to see the results from 40-21. Today the rest will be revealed live.
