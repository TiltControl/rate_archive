Mini Rate: The Indieheads Exchange!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/m0eghl/mini_rate_the_indieheads_exchange/

Hello everyone and welcome to the mini rate that you guys all voted for! The Indieheads Exchange! I'm  SO excited to be your host for the this great meeting of the minds between r/indieheads and us! Before we get into the indie goodness, here's a quick recap of how we got the songlist in case you are just joining us for this step!

# What is this? A crossover episode?

The 40 songs that we will be rating has been decided entirely by r/indieheads, suggested and voted on by their community in the same way that [we voted on songs for them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/luobyr/popheads_2021_mini_rate_the_indieheads_exchange/) This gave us an interesting set of genre defining smashes, beloved deep cuts, and sub favorites that our lovely sister sub has chosen to best represent their taste in music. Eventually we will hold a reveal in which indieheads becomes disgusted with our results, while we become disgusted in their lack of appreciation of lyrics about stealing mattresses. I genuinely can't wait. So without further ado, let's get into the songs!

I know a lot of these songs might be unfamiliar to the average pophead so we are holding a listening party where we will listen to all the songs on Tuesday at 4:00 PM EST! Indieheads were kind enough to send us a TON of quality stuff so don't be afraid of not knowing a lot of the songs! You're bound to discover something new you like if you keep an open mind!
Edit: I’m running a touch late but the listening party will be in 15 minutes!!! I’ll post the link here, in the DD, and in the rate channel on discord!

Join the party!

**There is one rule unique to this process! IF YOU ARE A FREQUENT POPHEADS USER WHO DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN INDIEHEADS RATES, PLEASE DO NOT HEAD OVER TO INDIEHEADS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR RATE!** The purpose of this rate is to exchange songs we wouldn't otherwise rate, going to the other sub because the songs are more familiar defeats the purpose of the the exchange. If you use both subs, a good rule of thumb to use is if someone asked you which sub you are more active in could you respond confidently within a second or two. If you can, just do that subs rate.

Now, onto the standard rules ~~that I copy and pasted from the nu-disco rate~~

**The Rules**

If you’re new to rates or simply need a refresher of the rules, here they are.

* **Listen to every song listed and assign them a score of 1 to 10**. Decimals of one are fine, but don't go past that - 6.5 is fine, 6.54 is not.
* **Rate all (40) songs in the main rate!** If you skip any songs, your ballot will not be counted. If your ballot is missing a score, I will message you repeatedly until you fix the errors.
* It is highly recommended, but not required, to write comments after your scores! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, here are some examples:

1. Maps: 10 Maroon 5 is shaking!
2. Bloodbuzz Ohio: 10 OMG!!! We LOVE one of Taylor Swifts friends!

* **This is the only way your comments should be formatted, any other format crashes the system.**
* **You may give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11**. These scores should be reserved for your least and most favorite songs in the rate. **You must leave a comment for these scores.** You are not required to use these scores if you don't want to.
* **Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.** Feel free to share them and campaign for your favorite song to win and bully those who are more tasteless than you
* Please use the [prepared link](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=steelstepladder&subject=Indieheads%20Exchange&message=Username%3A%0A%0AIn%20Undertow%3A%0A%0AShut%20Up%20Kiss%20Me%3A%0A%0AFireworks%3A%0A%0ANeighborhood%20%231%20%28Tunnels%29%3A%0A%0ALazuli%3A%0A%0Aget%20me%20away%20from%20here%2C%20i'm%20dying%3A%0A%0ANot%3A%0A%0ASunglasses%3A%0A%0Abmbmbm%3A%0A%0ABodys%3A%0A%0AHeaven%20or%20Las%20Vegas%3A%0A%0AI've%20Seen%20Footage%3A%0A%0AHe%20Would%20Have%20Laughed%3A%0A%0ABetween%20the%20Bars%3A%0A%0AHelplessness%20Blues%3A%0A%0AHow%20Simple%3A%0A%0AEverybody%20Wants%20to%20Love%20You%3A%0A%0ADisorder%3A%0A%0Aonly%20acting%3A%0A%0AAll%20My%20Friends%3A%0A%0ATime%20To%20Pretend%3A%0A%0AWhen%20You%20Sleep%3A%0A%0AHolland%2C%201945%3A%0A%0AAge%20of%20Consent%3A%0A%0ATenderness%3A%0A%0AGold%20Sounds%3A%0A%0AOn%20the%20Floor%3A%0A%0AIdioteque%3A%0A%0AAlison%3A%0A%0AHeat%20Waves%3A%0A%0ATeenage%20Riot%3A%0A%0ALadies%20and%20Gentlemen%2C%20We%20Are%20Floating%20in%20Space%3A%0A%0ACasmir%20Pulaski%20Day%3A%0A%0AOnce%20In%20a%20Lifetime%3A%0A%0AI%20Want%20the%20Wind%20to%20Blow%3A%0A%0ABloodbuzz%20Ohio%3A%0A%0AWolf%20Like%20Me%3A%0A%0AJesus%20etc.%3A%0A%0AMaps%3A%0A%0AGospel%20For%20a%20New%20Century%3A%0A%0AEND) to send in your scores! Every other format crashes the system we run to compute the scores. We’ve prepared [a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/6B1q89Sw) should the submission link not work as intended.
* **Don't sabotage!** It goes without saying that you can't deliberately score songs significantly lower than your own honest opinion in order to make it go out early! I WILL NOT accept your scores if I suspect you of willfully sabotaging songs! I don't suspect much issues as these aren't sub faves but I might ask you to add comments if your scores significantly go against the norm.
* **You may change your scores at any time before the deadline!** If you want to change your score after you've submitted, feel free to message me u/steelstepladder and I will make changes!
* The due date is currently slated for March 30th with the reveal taking place on the 2nd and 3rd. If you need an extension please just ask! I'm more than willing to work with you!
