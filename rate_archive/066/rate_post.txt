2018 Long Awaited Comebacks Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/b8lzr7/2018_long_awaited_comebacks_rate/

Welcome to Popheads Takes on Ageism: the 2018 ~~hags~~Comebacks rate! 2018 was a pretty quiet year from todays big pop starlets, but some of yesterday's biggest divas, crooners, and dancefloor legends dusted off the mics and dropped bold and innovative albums, showing they're not ready to be labeled forgotten legacy acts.  

These 4 releases are notable for updating each pop legend's catalog with new sounds and the hottest producers while keeping true to themselves and not just following trends- okay maybe Kylie was just another victim of the mass Ghost-of-Joanne Possesions going on at the time but at least she served us disco to go with the twang. Did her foray into yee-haw land pay off? Was Mariah able to pull out the talent that made her the solo artist with the most #1s in history ^noteveryonehasthat? Did Robyn's entirely homosexual fanbase die off in the gay-century between her releases? Did anyone besides the Grammy Nominations committee even listen to Christina's album? Let's found out

Scores due **May 5th** at 11:59 PST! That's 3am on the 6th in the East Coast. PM me with questions and concerns about your scores, and extensions if needed

##[Kylie Minogue-Golden](https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kylieminogue_couch.jpg)

*Golden* is the 14th album from the Aussie legend and first non Christmas release in 4 years ~~and first good album in 8~~. This also marks the 30th(!!!) year in her ridiculously long career. Kylie produced this album in Nashville and the influences immediately show- from the bedazzled guitar and cowboy boots in promotions, to the twang of the guitar opening the lead single and straight up yodeling in the title track, yes our dear Kylie caught the country bug. But don't be put off by that- this is still a disco-pop album at it's heart, sure to put you in a good mood and up square dancing or whatever Australians think country dancing is. Golden tackles all the familiar Kylie territory, love lost and love found, while also having something interesting to say about death and leaving a legacy.

Tracklist (Note: In the interest of keeping the albums relatively close in length and the main rate shorter overall, we will be rating the 'Standard' edition of the album. The other 'deluxe' tracks will be in the Bonus Rate):  

1. [Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BDImdAfodA)

5. Sincerely Yours
6. One Last Kiss
7. Live A Little
8. Shelby '68
9. Radio On
10. Love
11. Raining Glitter
12. [Music's Too Sad Without You (with Jack Savoretti)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsb1SuvUT9Q)

##[Mariah Carey- Caution](https://images.genius.com/c875d08f7a5521599cadf9c7f8416d80.1000x1000x1.jpg)

Songbird Supreme, Elusive Chanteuse, Mother of the Lambs, Mariah Carey returns with her 15th studio album *Caution*, her first release after 4 years, and longest time between albums. Besides one certain big live performance fiasco, Carey has spent most of that time quiet on the music front, leading many to wonder where she would go next and what ground there is even left to cover. The answer to that is well, Mariah doesn't really need to reinvent herself, and sticking with her tried and true sound with a batch of fresh talent behind the scenes lead to an extremely cohesive and tight record that manages to feel both modern and familiar. It helps that Mariah has been so influential that hopping on today's trends for her is really just revisiting a sound she helped popularize in the first place.

Still, its not just an album of comfortable, safe choices. Here Carey deploys the talents of new and somewhat unusual choices DJ Mustard, Skrillex, and Dev Hynes (Blood Orange) to pull her sound in new directions. And while the commercial impact of the album was a far reach of the heights she was used to, it's critically one of her biggest hits and drew attention from pop fans and the pitchfork crowd alike.

Tracklist:

1. [GTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsevTQ0Db1Y)
2. [With You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNy4QGHhoTg)
3. Caution
4. [A No No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sap-GTtCiU)
5. The Distance (feat. Ty Dolla Sign)
6. Giving Me Life (feat. Slick Rick and Blood Orange)
7. One Mo' Gen
8. 8th Grade
9. Stay Long Love You (feat. Gunna)
10. Portrait

##[Christina Aguilera- Liberation](https://images.genius.com/b88c3d85a8403b0df02a9442804bb88e.1000x1000x1.jpg)

Xtina is back, and taking cues from her more shall I say, successful eras, stripped back the hypersexual, high concept fronts of *Bionic* and *Lotus* and showed up fresh faced and eager to dive into her 8th studio album cycle for *Liberation*, the first album from her in 6 years! The long anticipated album followed many, many, many announcement and delay cycles, and honestly for a while it seemed like she was content dunking Oreos and playing third fiddle to the Blake and Adam Show, with a decent feature every few years to stay relevant. The hype quickly picked up early in the year when it seemed like it was actually all coming to fruition, and crashed even quicker with the release of the experimental, Kanye West produced Accelerate, and accompanying video featuring Christina being doused in an unknown goo with a whole lot of closeups of her mouth.

It was soon clear the risky choice of lead single didn't exactly pan out, and Xtina's comeback arrived with a commercial thud (a theme for this rate!). Her efforts in making a quality album out of a very [personal inner journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQS_kpH9xfA) were not completely unnoticed however! Critics responded with some of the best reviews of her career and personally, I was really impressed by a lot of the creative production choices and overall cohesion of the album, as well as her amazing voice. She also picked up two surprise Grammy nominations in the duo categories, and launched her first tour in over a decade.

(Note, Miss Aguilera loves herself an interlude/intro track, 3/4 of which we will not be rating due to short length. Don't be lame and give intro Liberation low scores just because it's an instrumental though, in this house we stan the talents of Nicholas Britell)

Tracklist:

1. Liberation
2. Maria
3. Sick of Sittin'
4. [Fall In Line (feat. Demi Lovato)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q2j5ApzSqs)
5. Right Moves (feat. Keida and Shenseea)
6. [Like I Do (feat. Goldlink)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVG0Iz1jL08)
7. Deserve
8. Twice
9. [Accelerate (feat. Ty Dolla Sign and 2 Chainz)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRSgMp5X1w)
10. Pipe (feat. XNDA)
11. Masochist
12. Unless it's With You

##[Robyn- Honey](https://images.genius.com/199a7cb6ab7ac40d9fab7d93c7ef3304.1000x1000x1.jpg)

Elusive Swedish club Queen Robyn was probably awaken from her 8 year slumber by locals praising the Calum Scott cover of Dancing on My Own and slandering her in the same breath, and for that I'm thankful because she really needed to come back and show those bitches what real crying on the dancefloor is. In the time between her 2010 album and the late 2018 followup we've had 2 presidents, a few prophetic end of the world situations, one whole Ariana Grande career, and every twink that shook their ass to Call Your Girlfriend has gone through their whole otter -> bear -> daddy life cycle and basically retired to Florida by now. That's all very 2010 though, and now the name of the game is chill pop, and Robyn is here to master that as well. Chill is a very basic way to describe Honey though, the album is more an emotional whirlwind of melancholy, wistful, and surprisingly horny dance-pop tracks. 



Tracklist:

1. [Missing U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o5BHH9U2Mg)
2. Human Being (feat. Zhala)
3. Because It's The Music
4. Baby Forgive Me
5. [Send To Robin Immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdX4B8e2NPo)
6. [Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mru9GG3ur9U)
7. Between The Lines
8. Beach2k20
9. Ever Again
