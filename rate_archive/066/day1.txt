The time has come for the 4 way showdown between the pop divas of yesteryear trying to claw their way back to relevancy: The Golden Thunder from Down Under, Kylie Minogue, "The Bionic Belter" Christina Aguilera, the Ikea of Sad Dancefloor pop Robyn, and The Elusive Chanteuse herself Mariah Carey.

Today we will be revealing the bottom third of our songs, 43-29, as well as a few of the bonus rate tracks from 12-9. The rate starts at **6PM EST** , so about 40 minutes from the time of this post. **Follow along here in the plugDJ where really most of the fun goes down: https://plug.dj/popheads**

Here in dead last, by quite a large margin, we have this entirely forgettable, backhalf filler track.For less than even 3 minutes Kylie reads off a few cheesy oneliners from your tia's facebook feed leading into a boring at worst hook. A pop song about love? Groundbreaking

---

**lilguavachan** (10): we love a country gay anthem

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): One of Kylie’s biggest strengths as an artist is her ability to be cheesy, but still come across as genuine. She sang so many silly love songs when she was younger and spun them into gold and that’s a power that hasn’t diminished with age. She makes this basic song sound like scripture, I listen to her sing about love and it’s like “yes, uh huh, I agree” even though what she’s saying is borderline inane at times. And that’s why she’s the princess of pop!

**jamesfog** (8): Cute sing [6]

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): getting serious stevie nicks vibes on this

**twat\_brained** (7.6): nice to hear the album starting to pick up

**1998tweety** (7.5): Not a huge fan of this besides the explosive production.

**Banananaise** (7): the chorus is good but the rest is aggressively forgettable

**nooodisaster** (6): Yeeahh, the album never recovers from this point. After almost escaping it, the nasally voice I hate is back, the lyrics are stuff we've heard before but not as good, it leaves you wanting more, and

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.3): lana outsold

**radiofan15** (5): Unsubstantial filler than doesn't deserve any kind of thought so enjoy this actual bop also called LOVE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_HmF84G7ZY

**SupremeShani** (5): I wasn't in love with it.

**waluigiest** (5): cute but

**MrSwearword** (1): OH MY GOD HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY WRITE THIS BAD SOUNDTRACK SONG I'M LEGIT SO FUCKING ANGRY BY NOW

**yourhostandpatron** (0): Okay, look, I know that Golden fans exists, but for the life of me I can't see why anybody would possibly like this. It's not even three damn minutes long (not necessarily a factor in evaluating whether a song's good or not, but clearly no effort was put in to this one) it features the blandest sounds and lyrics imaginable, and the chorus here is not only unoriginal, but also poorly constructed and quite painful to get through. I've heard LOVE in other artists' music about a billion times before, and I like it even less when Kylie does her take on this tired melody. It's glaringly obvious that this was written to be filler, and I doubt it was filler created for the intent of enjoyment between Kylie and her fans.

The first casuality of this bonus rate, and there was never really any doubt that this would go out first. A promotional single from the animated, religious kids movie The Star, Mariah is clearly phoning it in here for the paycheck, she could sing this ballad in her sleep and probably did in that late 2000s stretch of albums i ignored

---

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I think Ms. Carey only signed on to the religious kids movie because they told her she could flex her vocals as much as she wanted to on the title track

**skargardin** (7): it's cute :uwu:

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (7): the only bearable song from the nightmare era

**Banananaise** (6): i was about to say 'what is this disney ass shit' but then i saw the album art and realised its literally from some b grade christian animated movie so i guess she nailed it

**jamesfog** (6): Cute but dated af

**SupremeShani** (6): All I Want For Christmas found unbothered.

**radiofan15** (5.2): This is not All I Want From Christmas Is You!... also that children's choir is scary as fuck

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): what the fuck is this movie

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Mariah this song is bad. This sounds like she wrote a first draft, didn’t edit it, and then recorded it in one take. She looks bored in the music video. Those kids sound like shit.

**MrSwearword** (1): follow the North Star to a better song, y'all

Another song out from Golden, this doesnt get roasted quite as hard as Love did but mostly suffers from being a middling country-tinged bop in an filled to the brim with good to great country-tinged bops

---

**auxjuan** (10): This is just pure bliss and fun. Everything I love about Kylie. That bridge is just stunning.

**jamesfog** (8): Cute sing [3]

**nooodisaster** (8): being in a long distance relationship............. the audience relates.

**waluigiest** (8): yes guitar!!

**1998tweety** (7.9): This is pretty nice but on the lower end from all the songs I've heard so far.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I would say that I’m kind of “eh” on this song but really listening to it it’s a lot better than I remembered? Ugh, I have to start giving out lower scores I can’t just give every song a great score.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): One Last Kiss is a bit grating, if I'm being honest. It's an above average song, but that chorus Kylie delivers...is not it. There should be nothing wrong with it theoretically, but it sounds like Kylie is trying to lead a choir that's not actually present in the studio by raising her voice up to dangerously accommodating pitches. I don't find much to come back to here, but I also don't find it forgettable as much of Golden's second half. In a way, its decent yet slightly unattractive execution makes it the perfect track to come after Yours Sincerely; that's a song along the same vein.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): cute but One Kiss outsold

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): P!nk has left the chat

**radiofan15** (6.5): Great, more faux-country... is she auditioning for the guest vocalist spot on Lady Antebellum?

**twat\_brained** (6.4): cute but one direction did it better

**awryj** (5): :kossmeonce:

**SupremeShani** (5): It's a safe song, the bridge is a standout for me though, from the soft and breathy vocals, the repeated kisses, and that high pitched moan.

**MrSwearword** (1): this is the same bad song in a THIRD incarnation

The first song out from our Swedish songstress, here is easily the most controversial song on Honey. Somehow Robyn decided making her calls to organize Miami Pride weekend brunch plans into a repetitive 5 minute song backed by a Nintendo Wii shop remix was a good idea. And quite a few of us ~~delusional Robyn stans~~ did! At the least I personally thought it was almost hypnotic in its near emptiness and really quite bold, plus who doesnt want to sit right on the beach and have some really nice food with their good Judys? Also, clock the *Show Me Love* sample!!

---

**awryj** (10): another 11 contender

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): By FAR my favorite song on this album and if it’s an early out I’ll be upset because this is art. I’m a huge sucker for this kind of pseudo-vaporware *Far Side Virtual*-esque Space Age lounge muzak, there’s this sense of like, pleasant emptiness about it. There’s something so refreshing and almost daring about a song like this that embraces something weird and conceptual.

**lilguavachan** (10): queen of beaches

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I want to go to this cute place on the beach, where they have really good food.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): chill bop we have to stan

**MNREDR** (9): The most intriguing song on the rate, it's hardly a song but more like a deconstruction of a pre-beach party phone conversation laid over a sophisticated Wii music backdrop. So weird and yet so catchy.

**pastastic** (9): and I promise I'm not joking.

**waluigiest** (9): this is a gay wii shop channel remix and if you don’t like it you’re just not ready

**Leixander** (8.5): Party.

**1998tweety** (8): This feels like a 5 and a half minute long interlude.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Beach 2k18 really is one of the most baffling musical decisions I've ever seen, and I don't mean to say that in either a critical or a complementary way. There's so much to appreciate here, and I'm actually mad at myself for only intellectually realizing his instead of emotionally and spiritually doing the same. Who thought that Robyn trying to set up a beach date for five straight minutes by repeating the same line over and over again would be a good idea for a penultimate track? Nobody knows the identity of such a madperson, but there's a case for this song to be made if you reacted as displeasingly as I did to it; in Beach 2k18, the weirdly funky yet unnatural synths that accompany Robyn are representations of aspects of the woman's anxious feelings. Resulting in a repetitive psuedo-dance track that will confuse your average casual listener, I can guarantee that either you'll love Beach 2k18, or you'll be sad you don't. Sorry! I make the rules.

**jamesfog** (7): Mess

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Robyn always has at least one track on each album that feels like it would be more at home playing in an elevator

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I’m all for instrumental-heavy, loose tracks with dance beats but for some reason, this song didn’t click with me at all. The delivery is so summery but it’s just really bloated and weighs down the pacing of this album considerably, especially considering it’s the longest track here. In theory, this should be a highlight for me but it just bores me and I either skip it or just keep constantly checking when it’ll be over.

**radiofan15** (3.5): Taylor wishes she could write these kind of lyrics... OK, being serious this would be a nice interlude but its over 5 minutes long WTF?

**skargardin** (2): mistakes were made

**MrSwearword** (1): what the fuck is this Street Fighter midi file that washed up on this beach?

**hikkaru** (0): what is this and who thought it was a good idea?

**nooodisaster** (0): Oh my god this is so boring the lyrics are uninteresting and juvenile the melodic structure is brain numbing and the production is rent-a-beat level, it wouldn't even work as a 1 minute interlude.

This song comes at a very low point in the album- the country bops have started to feel all to familiar and blended together, with so many a row that the quality of the album has slipped by not bringing us anyhthing new. The second fatal flaw is being a ballad in a slow point in the album- and Miss Minogue is not known for her ballads! Sandwiched inbetween the more succesful slow, emotional tunes Shelby '68 and Music's Too Sad Without You, this one is utterly forgettable

---

**awryj** (10): now that i'm relistening to this i begin to realize i like ballad kylie the most

**lilguavachan** (10): ended sincerely yours

**MrSwearword** (10): the emotional delivery makes this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): very beautiful ballad

**nooodisaster** (9): Simple but heartbreaking ballad.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song is such an emo-mood, I listen to this whenever I’m feeling nonspecifically sad. I love a good song about the power of music.

**waluigiest** (8): she’s sad :(

**1998tweety** (7.8): The verses remind me of I Could Use A Love Song by Maren Morris but not as good.

**jamesfog** (7.5): A skip

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I'm not a fan of Kylie's more somber and slower songs, but she has some beautiful delivery in terms of vocals where she can sing anything and come across as earnest.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): come on, come on

**yourhostandpatron** (6): "The War of the Worlds" is an episode of the American radio drama anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air directed and narrated by actor and future filmmaker Orson Welles as an adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds (1898). It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938, over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network. The program has become famous for supposedly tricking some of its listeners into believing that a Martian invasion was actually taking place. The illusion of realism was furthered because the Mercury Theatre on the Air was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes after the introduction. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to The Chase and Sanborn Hour with Edgar Bergen and tuned in to "The War of the Worlds" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction that the show was a drama.

**twat\_brained** (5.3): this album's starting to blend together and reach tedium level

Who had Christina Aguilera on their bingo card of artists to hop on the Caribbean trend (a year or two too late at that)? Many of you thought this unexpected collaboration seemed out of place on this album and I can't disagree. Looking at the credits on this song, it's clear it was put together in bits and pieces from various sessions, even with hitmakers Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels showing up. At which point this morphed from a standard horny bop to a reggae-lite horny bop is unclear. Featured artists Shenseea and Keida do their best to bring some legitimacy to this track and do an admirable job, but it still doesnt quite all come together

---

**lilguavachan** (10): oh we love a horny bop

**waluigiest** (10): how did this dancehall crossover work like this???

**1998tweety** (9.5): I have no idea who these features are but they delivered hard.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): kinda 2016-ish but still fresh if that makes sense

**radiofan15** (8.2): Cute and funky bop...

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Reggae is a genre that pop fans tend to be as alienated by as much as classic rock or heavy metal, if only because its musical style is so foreign. You could argue that there's also a racial element to this dislike, although I'm not keen to debate about this stuff today. Given that, it might feel like a means of betrayal for Christina to make Right Moves, but honestly, wouldn't you people agree that this actually went pretty damn well? I'm usually as bored at reggae as some gays tend to be, but Christina's accompanied guest verse here make some desperate matters well worth their choices.  Anyway, Right Moves s a good song. Stream it!

**twat\_brained** (7.4): wait the featured vocals aren't Stefflon Don? I mean I guess if ever I want to check out some island music I have a good reference point now. It's not yelling in my ear trying to be something it isn't unlike that last screaming mess of a song

**nooodisaster** (7): The feature is life!!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song is a bit awkward but I enjoy the flow between the features on this, and while the beat is kinda hollow, it’s more enjoyable than most of what I’ve heard on this record.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (6): it's cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Remember trop pop? Remember how tired we were? That’s gone, right? Anyways this is more memorable than a lot of the album but it’s also weaker. Does that make sense? Like I remembered that there was a reggae-lite song on the album but I remembered that I didn’t like it, whereas I forget a lot of the other songs but can still kind of listen to them.

**MrSwearword** (5): it feels so out of place with some attempts at trying to make Trap-Caribbean a thing.

**SupremeShani** (5): I feel like this is a weird departure from the rest of the album, it's a fun little bop and I like that it's a break from everything else, but the reggae influences here are so vanilla, especially when you have artists like Keida and Shenseea on it.

**pastastic** (2.2): and xtina didn't earn either of those points

Our first single hits the chopping block! About as far away as you can get from a typical Kylie single, Music's too sad without you mostly ditches the banjos and tumbleweeds and finds Kylie crooning longingly over a simple guitar and percussion instrumental (and are those sleigh bells in the background?) with a random white guy for good measure. A lot of you weren't here for a ballad from the queen of dance floor bangers, and it being the closing track at that, but I found the song really beautiful and poignant even, and solid respite from repetitive twang of the songs preceeding.

---

**MrSwearword** (10): the dude's actually not bad on this and the song certainly leaves a better impression than roughly two fucking thirds of this goddamn album.

**radiofan15** (10): I was expecting to hate this one but I really like it WTF is wrong with me liking songs with mens on Popheads AKA one of the most mysandrists subs on Reddit?

**awryj** (9): this is mom pop done WELL (also a big grower, i didnt like it as much as i do now)

**Banananaise** (9): ANOTHER great SAD BANGER from Kylie!

**jamesfog** (8): Cute sing [7]

**skargardin** (8): Will probably get robbed

**1998tweety** (7.4): A bit disappointed that the album ends with a ballad, but at least it still has some of that country influence in it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): popheads when billie eilish releases an album and lady gaga is nowhere to be found

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Of course, the only way to end an album like Golden is to end it with the kind of ballad that appeals best to sad Asian mothers who have a stiffled amount of nostalgia for the 90s. Heck, Music's Too Sad Without You even has an unknown white dude attached to it; I'm trying not to make this comment too mean, but come on, Kylie. Thankfully, I'm not really the best person to consult whenever people want displays of rage against this kind of kitzch, and, yes, even if I acknowledge this song could be considered bland, I at least respect the fact that it pays some amount of debt to the traditional archetype it ultimately stems from, unlike most of Golden's mild forays into a shaky boundary between regular pop and more country tinged music.

**twat\_brained** (6.6): I appreciate that Kylie's looking for a change of pace here but there's a reason why it's Lana Del Rey who sings these types of songs and not Kylie

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): eh

**lilguavachan** (6): i'm not feeling her at all.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is kind of pretty but Kylie, this couldn’t be more generic. Is this really the last song on the standard edition? That’s disappointing.

**waluigiest** (5): really you’re just gonna end like this

**Brendon-Urine** (4): Yeah the last half of this album is boring, that's kind of what I expected going in.

**nooodisaster** (4): then why you singing bitch?

**SupremeShani** (3.5): Why does the instrumental remind me of Sims music?

Miss Aguilera loves herself an intro/interlude/instrumental piece, and to my surprised a lot of you guys liked this dramatic intro as well. It's always difficult to fairly rate short interludes and especially instrumental pieces,as theyre often just used to set a mood, transition from one sound to another, or just provide a respite from a few bangers in a row. This piece is long enough to tell a full story through the lush, soaring instrumentation by Oscar nominated composer Nicholas Britell (stream the If Beale Street Could Talk soundtrack!) and a few words from Christina herself. Christina opts to give this opening orchestral piece the title of her album, and featured it heavily in her tour setpieces and the Fall In Line music video, and it sets the stage for the story of the album: Christina looking deep within herself to remember who she was, what she is, and liberate herself of the expectations and limitations of her past career. Not included here is the part about how the horny bops fit into the equation, but thats probably for the best.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The instrumental introduction is one of the best songs on the album, how about that?

**jamesfog** (10): Great opener

**Leixander** (10): how dare she snatch my wig like this, this is ultraVIOLINce! thank you ladies and gentlemen i will be here all night you don't have to show me the doo-

**letsallpoo** (10): we love an unnecessary intro

**lilguavachan** (10): we love a dramatic start to the album

**SupremeShani** (10): I'll be honest, I have never bothered listening to this album before this rate, but the last thing I was expecting it to open with was a dramatic orchestra, I will stan the talents of Nicholas Britell.

**radiofan15** (9): Queen of symphonic intros, this one moves smoother than an Oreo dunked on milk

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): sets up such a mood

**1998tweety** (8): It's nice but it's also an instrumental intro so....

**Banananaise** (8): this is some fuckin mass effect 3 ghost child hallucinations shit

**hikkaru** (8): pretty

**nooodisaster** (8): remember simba....

**J\_Toe** (7): lol this sounds like the intro to a documentary that compares the first 5 years of a child's life to the cataclysmic beginning of the universe

**MrSwearword** (7): nice dramatic start but inconsequential at large

**NachoLiterary** (7): SHUT THOSE FUCKING KIDS UP.... gotta say 1:05-1:37 goes offffff

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I think instrumentals in pop music have historically been a bit of a mix bagged (my suspicion is that the ones from Low and Heroes made everybody else pack up and go home) but there's hope for the idea if you look at Liberation. Fulfilling the idea of a beautiful and haunting overture much more than, say, Hayley Kiyoko's introduction to Expectations did, Liberation should be an exciting indicator to skeptical listeners coming into this record that Christina has begun making new music that's actually good again after the disaster that Lotus was (well, outside Your Body, that is.) It's not good enough to be something out of a movie, but Liberation is gorgeous in a way that leaves you more hopeful than not.

**auxjuan** (6): It's just an instrumental, but it manages to introduce Xtina's sonic atmosphere for the comeback album pretty well.

**twat\_brained** (6): instrumental intros do not work unless you are Kim Petras. change my mind

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (5): Something about it felt odd

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): this intro sounds like stock music in a straight-to-dvd action movie climax, i wonder if halsey inspired it

**waluigiest** (4): honestly one of the weaker interludes on the album. To me, this album is not cohesive enough thematically or sonically to justify this many interludes.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): Just kind of takes up space

This loose single from 2017 never really made sense to me: was it an attempt at launching a comeback? A MIAMTEC leftover? Either way, it kind of came and went without anyone noticing, which is a shame because i think this was a ctually a pretty strong single with a very Mariah video in which she burns a $20,000 wedding dress for seemingly no reason. Ya'll hated it though, primarily due to that divisive YG feature.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): There are some very obvious cracks in the production of this track and Mariah’s voice sounds strained but I’ll be damned if I don’t just love this song. I really think that this is one of the smoothest melodies Mariah’s come up with in years and it floats so right above that harsh trap instrumentation and in front of those background vocals. Plus Mariah looks *right* in that music video and she [lit a $250,000 wedding dress on fire.](https://www.glamour.com/story/mariah-carey-burns-wedding-dress-in-music-video) like…

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): underrated

**radiofan15** (7.5): Not the greatest Mariah song but the beat is hot, the hook is catchy and, as failed lead singles go, this is miles better than Triumphant

**nooodisaster** (7): She doesn't and I'm..... ambivalent.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I Don’t really like this song that much

**MrSwearword** (4): far worse has been given to Mariah [We Belong Together, Beautiful with Miguel, The Roof, etc.] but this blows.

**skargardin** (4): no mam

**SupremeShani** (4): Do I care for this song? I don't.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (4): its amazing how much she's improved since the nightmare era (2014-2017)

**tevinterimperium** (2): Some twink on grindr was trying to get people to buy this song when it came out. I felt bad for the lamb because it's so bad.

This placing is either a massive diappointment or sweet relief if youre on of the two very different types of people that submitted scores for this song. By FAR the most controversial song in the rate (and one of the most controversial of all rates), this song garnered passionate responds from both sides of the spectrum. An overhated masterpiece to some, an absolute mess to many others, this song's placement was as chaotic as the Kanye West production, moving up and down constantly before settling down here as the 0s started to pile on. Regardless of your opinion on the quality of the song, we can all agree this was a WTF choice from Xtina for a lead single for her comeback- the instrumental is bonkers with that incomprehensible vocal sample, there's minimal hooks for radio, and Ty Dolla Sign is all over the place in an almost duet role. This flopped hard everywhere immediately and yet, in a very *Bionic* fashion, has already picked up hardcore defenders. Maybe Legendtina was ahead of her time yet again and 2023 will be full of *Accelerate* derivatives on the charts

---

**hikkaru** (11): this is so overhated it highkey slaps. kanye snapped

**rootbeer\_surge** (11): bonkers as hell. I absolutely love it

**tevinterimperium** (11): This, like most of her music, was too ahead of its time for you commoners with your insipid music tastes. You all would rather listen to some airyana grenade song that plagiarizes 6 different songs that all came out 100 years ago or some lil nas xantaccion song than listen to a masterpiece like Accelerate. It's literally insane to think about. This is why America deserves to be nuked by north korea. Anyways, hit me up in 2025 when you realize that this song was amazing.

**1998tweety** (10): This song grew on me hard. I feel like you guys would've loved this if it wasn't by Xtina and by someone like Charli instead. Just cause this isn't the type of song you expect from Xtina, especially as a lead single, doesn't mean it's not good. Yeah the video is a bit messy, but the features actually work well on this and the song gives off a disgusting sexy vibe really well.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i know this is gonna get robbed but you dumb twinks just dont understand experimental ART!

**JunkyGS** (10): People with taste know this is a bop. So Popheads will vote this out Day 1.

**letsallpoo** (10): i went from unironically hating this to ironically liking it to unironically loving it

**lilguavachan** (10): okay so, i don't exactly know what happened as to why i just love this song now? my reaction when i first heard it was very similar to ajayii's reaction of accelerate, but now it's... good? i've given up on understanding myself tbh

**radiofan15** (10): Two weeks before sending my scores this was my 11, however something happened... I was fully assimilated by Mariah Carey and turned into a Lamb. It all started with GTFO back in September of 2018, and my recent ranking of Mariah's discography kind of sealed the deal... although I still appreciate this as one of the bravest choices of a lead single ever by any kind of mainstream artist, up to the point you can call it almost delusional... I mean, the instrumental is disorienting, Ty Dolla sign sounds awful singing, 2 Chainz only comes in to break the mood, the outro goes on for fucking forever, the chorus is non-existent and the lyrics are abstract up to the point they feel kind of random... and all of that is why I love it so much. Say what you want about Xtrina and Accelerate, but this would ever remain one of the biggest ''fuck you'' any pop artist have ever gave to their nansayers.

**jamesfog** (9): Overhated bop with great instrumental

**Leixander** (8.5): my feelings about this song change daily other than the thought that the rappers in this should've stayed home and let xtine do her strange vocal thingie

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I was actually scared to listen to this song because of all the comments I read about it. It's such a strange song, it feels like a mutation of multiple genres, and is almost scary to listen to, but I sorta love it. You can definitely hear the Kanye influence all over the track, that trap clipped beat clashes with the deep electronic synths in the best way possible, and the features feel so natural here.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Accelerate has just so much chaotic potential within it (not surprising, actually, when you take into account that it's a Kanye song produced in 2018) that some, including me, find it impossible not to like. Maybe some people who're also obsessed with writing long comments nobody actually reads will try to argue why it's actually an objective work of musical genius, but that's not what I want to do. The reason why Accelerate is so amazing is not because it's good, of because it's bad. The reason why Accelerate is so amazing is because it's Accelerate. Peek into the gap that leads into the circle of hell where us poor homosexuals will end up going and you will hear Christina's non-chorus echoing throughout the walls, only supplemented by Ty Dolla Sign's 'ANOTHER SHOT, YOU COMING HOME WITH ME'. This is what it's like to be God and the devil at once. This is what it's like to be being itself. Oh, and by the way, does Ty actually appear in this rate twice? Maybe he's the secret to immortality.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): I honestly don't remember listening to this since it came out. Revisiting it… was it that bad? The intro is… not it and 2's verse was uninspired, to put it mildly. And why Ty is stretching his voice to limits it simply can't reach is beyond me, but it's really not as bad as I remember it. I'm sure a lot of it was just the shock factor of this being the lead single, combined with THAT video. It's well composed, just delivered poorly vocally.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): I'm in the elite group of thinkers that think this song is pretty good. The features are lame, but Christina's parts are all amazing. I love the instrumental as well.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): is not THAT bad ....i like the bass. hate the lyrics

**nooodisaster** (5): we love a first out! Honestly it's grown on me & probably doesn't deserve ALL the hate. There are a lot of nice hooks here. Still, cannot deny it's a trainwreck.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Aaah. One of the things I’m most excited for in this rate is seeing just where this weird ass track ends up. I remember it being so jarring on first listen but revisiting it I’m kind of desensitized to it and it’s just kind of disappointing. I kind of wish it went even further and was weirder. It’s more disjointed than anything else, and the problem with that is that none of the pieces are very strong to begin with. I think the weird percussion and the garbled vocal sample are what throw it off the most but none of the artists really brought even their B-game here. I appreciate that she tried something different, but that in and of itself doesn’t make this a good song.

**NachoLiterary** (2): so over her voice at this point. like if you need to go that ham every word, note, breath... what are you even doing. can't believe this was a single.

**waluigiest** (2): we should be rating the interludes because all of them are better and more intentional than this

yatcho: **MrSwearword** (0): hated it then and I hate it now; this bullshit is badly written, badly sung, badly produced even by 2018 KANYE standards, has a disgusting video and should have never seen the light of day.

**skargardin** (0): mawma this is some hot trash. BYE

**static\_int\_husp** (0): This track is just so, so poorly produced. Xtina's vocals are done in such a way it's hard to tell what she's saying most of the time. Add in Ty Dolla's absurd ad-libbing and Mr. Chainz's poor verse, and you get a song I want to listen to less than the elevator music Robyn makes.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): It feel like I’m living in crazy town. It feels like everyone’s done a 180 on this song since it dropped, and I’ve done litmus checks to make sure I’m not missing some magnum opus fever dream that I just didn’t have the IQ to previously understand. To my surprise, not only was I not missing anything, I actually hate this song more now than I once did. For starters, the production is literally dogshit. It sounds like someone google translated Playboi Carti vocals into MIDI, and literally every part of the songs sounds disjointed. Like, I’ve struggled to find some artsy reason all the verses come in half a second earlier than they should to give the song any breathing room - maybe it’s because Christina wanted to give us all anxiety and create this concept of “acceleration.” Too bad it still sounds like shit. There’s so many production quirks that this song literally sounds cobbled together from Kanye closing his eyes and choosing whatever soundbite he clicks on. Ty Dolla $ign sounds like he needs to be rushed to the ER, and 2 Chainz literally sounds lost. Someone give that poor man a fucking GPS. Together, we have something that I’m hesitant to call a song, because it literally feels like it was created by an algorithm. It has all the workings of a song, but it’s performative, like a robot didn’t understand that you can’t just add in random synths and cut from verse to verse with no regard for human life. Maybe it’s just so profound I can’t appreciate it, but my favorite artist is Marcel Duchamp, so I really doubt that. This song makes me want to accelerate off a fucking bridge.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of Kylie’s best “ballads…” probably of her career? And it’s about a car? Wow.

**SupremeShani** (10): I really love this song and I'm not even sure why I do, the way she drags out the end of each word in the chorus is a pop music guilty pleasure of mine.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): invented driving

**awryj** (9): red era taytay except good

**1998tweety** (8): I kind of like some things this song is doing but then it also does weird stuff that I don't like.

**jamesfog** (8): Cute sing [5]

**Banananaise** (7): i don't hate this song but i can't listen to this amount of heeaaaAAAAHHHts or caaAAAHs without gravitating towards the skip button

**radiofan15** (7): I was afraid by just reading the title but I didn't mind the faux-country vibes here

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): why didn’t kylie just wait a year to get the next model, definitely would’ve improved the lyrics on this track

**waluigiest** (7): oh worm why did she do that thing in the chorus

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Shelby '68 fits a lyrical and literary trope I've been observing for awhile now that I can see in a lot of media I consume. The trope I'm talking about involves mentioning a specific object in a specific category, like a car, and makes sure to mention what commercial brand this object belongs to. A nice example of this is, of course, the legendary lyric 'so baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover', which Shelby '68, quite honestly, doesn't even come close to topping. The realistic side of my mind wants to see this as a method of creating nostalgia, but my cynical side also thinks that it's all a grand scheme capitalism's deviced. I am going on this pretentious rant because Shelby '68, is, frankly, very dull. It's not too bad, but it tries to go for that feeling I mentioned in my first hypothesis whilst falling to produce any kind of similar effect on listeners. And when pop falls into this kind of tepidness, we all start disliking it, don't we?

**nooodisaster** (6): I'm so conflicted on this song. It definitely stands out as one of the catchiest songs on this entire record, and the lyrics aren't horrible? But I get "annoying catchy" vibes from this, which is the opposite of what I want. I think I just really hate cars lmao.

**skargardin** (6): The 6s jumped out

**MrSwearword** (4): how is this a draft of Style if Taylor stuck to country? This shit drives less like a Shelby '68 and more like a Oldsmobile Achieva '92

This album takes a left turn quickly away from the lush and dramatic sounds of Liberation and Maria to the straight up arena rock anthem Sick of Sittin'. Or at least, thats what this Anderson Paak-produced track seems to aiming for with its heavy guitar, audience cheering, and accoustic manipulation that makes it sound like Christina is singing at the main stage at Glastonbury. For me, and a lot of you guys, this doesn't really quite achieve its intended effect, and it sounds more like Christina playing pretend in Joan Jett drag

---

**jamesfog** (10): An anthem

**lilguavachan** (10): i love rocktina, popheads let me give 11s to multiple songs challenge [3]

**1998tweety** (8.7): I don't know what genre to describe this as but it's so different and I love it.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Rock Christina is always welcome, but maybe if the instrumentals were cleaned up a little bit and the guitar brought forward a little it this would have snapped harder

**NachoLiterary** (8): faux-live, faux-rock & i am falling for it

**twat\_brained** (8): https://people.com/celebrity/kanye-west-halts-concert-to-ask-wheelchair-bound-fan-to-stand/ this is all i can think of when i hear this i'm sorry

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Sick of Sittin' is a track deliberately designed to create a pop anthem suited for the arena instead of individual listening, even using sound effects to create the impression that Christina is at some kind of boxing fight instead of at the studio singing her heart out. The final product is one I've gone back and forth on for awhile, but as of present I do enjoy this song, even if I don't think it's quite as full or complete as it hopes to be. The spoken word section from Christina at the middle can be cheesy, but it is a teensy little charming. The production on Sick of Sittin' is also pretty energetic, so if you're the kind of person to enjoy what's going on in a song's background, perhaps you'll enjoy the thrill of the crowd here over anything else.

**waluigiest** (7): she’s mad and I kind of dig it

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I love the unfiltered and aggressive vibe here, but while it should work with her style of vocals, I can't help but feel like there's a disconnect somewhere, and it comes across as disingenuous. I wanna hear what it would sound like if Anderson Paak decided to keep this for his own album though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Does this song have bad sound quality or is it just me?

**MrSwearword** (6): this is a lot of emotion for a stint on The Voice that included four seasons and one win total

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song has some good ideas but the chorus is kinda annoying and the production feels restrained and not nearly as raw as it could be

**nooodisaster** (1): So formless and boring. "Wave of noise" personified.

**Brendon-Urine** (0): Oh... this was bad... I hate the mixing and generally everything here.

Xtina is horny again, but now she *Liberated* so we've moved on from the blatantness of the *Your Body* and *Not Myself Tonight*'s and into something a little more uh... subtle? Not much subtle about asking to get piped but this song still manages to stay smooth and suggestive while also being a blatantly sexual horny bop. Who is ~~Madame X~~ XNDA you ask? A mystery rap feature who's identity is a secret (and is actually racecar driver Lewis Hamilton), he actually slides right into this track and is a great companion to Xtina on this track with some very believeable chemistry between them both on display.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): relatable

**lilguavachan** (10): i guess we're just horny again

**MrSwearword** (10): surprisingly whimsical, contemporary and sexy all at once

**1998tweety** (9.3): Another song where I don't know the feature, but honestly I'm glad I don't know who these people are cause they are delivering hard.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I don't advocate smoking if it's not for sensual detective fiction cosplay (don't ask) but some way or the other I've just fallen in love with Pipe. I have no idea how Christina picked up a professional racer to sing so well, but Lewis Hamilton and Christina have so much chemistry together that they create a mellow, slow yet satisfactory atmosphere that fills Pipe with such bliss to the point where it ends up becoming a song I adore, even if it doesn't have too much substance to it from a thematic perspective. I suspect that Pipe will be overlooked, because it seems destined to me to be a hidden little gem, and I'm sad to say that I'll just have to cope with that.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): This is sexy.

**radiofan15** (8.1): This is way too subdued for my taste but I don't regret having listened to it, that rap portion was too smooth for words

**waluigiest** (8): bottom anthem

**twat\_brained** (7.8): i don't get why she's being coy and discreet with these euphemisms when literally 6 years prior she flat out just sang "ALL AH WANNUH DO IS FAWK YA BAWWWWDEEEEH WHOOAAAAOOOOAAAAOAAAAWOOOAAAAOOOH" still sounds pretty chill and i can groove to it. more importantly, if you think Lewis Hamilton is the only Racing Driver Who Also Knows How to Sing Well™️, I can assure you I can do the same 😎

**NachoLiterary** (7): thoughts on the theory that XNDA is lewis hamilton?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The percussion is so aggravating but the rest of the track is a pretty vibey and enjoyable experience

**Leixander** (6): production is nice but the lyrics are ehh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): It’s definitely a song.

**SupremeShani** (4): Is it crack? Is that what you smoke? You smoke crack?

**Brendon-Urine** (2): I immedately forgot this song after hearing it

One of those super heartstring tugging ballads that LOVES to get played out on the radio, this 2013 duet is probably the last bit of chart success Xtina will see in a while. Luckily for her it STILL smashes on radio to this day, to the annoyance of many
---

**1998tweety** (10): This is amazing

**jamesfog** (10): Classic!

**nooodisaster** (10): I'm kinda glad you can't give 11s to Bonus tracks, bc this definitely would be fighting for it. Xtina's best song in like 10 years tbh. There's not a hint of oversinging here and she sounds absolutely divine because of it. The lyrics are absolutely heartbreaking in the best way and even after 160+ listens this still hits me.

**radiofan15** (10): Probably would rate is lower due to overplaying but TBH it's still one of the greatest successful pop ballads of the last few years... i'm still in awe of how well used is Xtina on this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): the 2010s version of the imogen heap meme

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I remember how shocked I was when I learned that Christina was the featured vocalist on this song, she sounds so amazing here too.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is legit the last time Xtina was culturally relevant

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): mom music

**MrSwearword** (4): sure it's subtle but the song has no real appeal other than a song that challenged Christina

**awryj** (1): no please no

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Ugh, throwback to my freshman year modern dance class that I had with my ex-boyfriend where the dance teacher played this during the warmups. I hated it then and I hate it now.

A surprising tie towards the end of our first day. This is yet another somewhat forgettable, ballad-esque cut from Kylie. Luckily we're almost out of these and thus out of filler from Golden. She fires on all cylinders from now on

---

**Brendon-Urine** (10): OK KYLIE??? The chorus on this hits like a train, the way she blasts in is amazing.

**Banananaise** (9): what a great SAD BANGER like only Kylie can do!

**jamesfog** (8.5): Cute sing [2]

**nooodisaster** (8.5): We love a grateful queen!! Dedicating this absolute BOP to her fans, we might need to stan.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Theoretically, I get what Sicerely Yours is trying to do. It's supposed to be the wise, grand ballad in the middle of this record where Kylie's supposed to get more personal than ever and get ready to kick ass at the same time, and it's designed to be a fan favourite deep cut, although, to be fair, I do not actually know if this got released as a single or not. To be fair, Sincerely Yours does more or less achieve these goals if you're a dedicated Kylie fan, and it's not even too bad if you happen to be the opposite. There's some actual creative motivation here that I appreciate, and Kylie pulls off the image she tries to construct here without any sense of effort. I have my doubts over the simplistic production and the extent of Kylie's vocals, but this is still a favourite off Golden.

**1998tweety** (8): I like the chorus on this, but the rest is just ok.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): See, this is how you do a song dedicated to the fans.

**lilguavachan** (8): imagine if this was just acoustic guitar like a country ballad, instead of something that, while still cute, is kinda... generic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The drop on this is so blissful

**radiofan15** (7.2): Not the greatest song on the world but I can appreciate the lack of faux-country

**awryj** (7): vaguely tayloresque

**waluigiest** (5): forgot to proofread the email before I hit send

**SupremeShani** (4.5): This song sounds like it was pieced together through a bunch of leftover demos from other artists.

**MrSwearword** (4): this is such YA novel turned movie soundtrack/trailer dreck which compared to the two previous tracks is actually progress.

**twat\_brained** (4): i'm tempted to complain about this being filler since she had 4 years to put out another album but she's far from the first artist to do something like this

**selegend** (3): definitely sounds like a b-side

The first song out from the main rate for Mariah, a lot of you thought it was just meh and do NOT want to go 'gen. Tied with Kylie here, basically this is just more slow-songphobia from popheads. Plenty more of that to come

---

**lilguavachan** (10): oh we love a horny slow jam

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): thot anthem

**waluigiest** (9): it’s luscious <3

**1998tweety** (8.7): One Mo' Gen but instead it's One Mo' Game which is what I say to my mom after staying up till 3 am playing video games.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Before this song I had no what the fuck was one mo'gen, i just though she was stupid for writing it and saying it like that but it turns out I was wrong, I shouldn't have never doubted Mother of the Lambs... Thank you Skinny Legend for showing me the way

**twat\_brained** (8.1): Genius has been a lifesaver here, not gonna lie. I'm guessing the title is part of AAVE? In any case I can't really relate #virgin4life 🤪

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song is weird because something feels off about the melody, it’s not quite as memorable as it should be. This song just kind of happens, I would say that I like it but it’s not a standout on the album. But that vocal arrangement is to die for, and I’m always here for a horny moment from Mariah.

**SupremeShani** (7.5): A slick and fun bop that's easy to listen to and sing along with.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): 'One More Gen stands out a little annoyingly compared to the rest of Caution as a whole, if I do so say so myself. It's often referred to as the one track that people don't exactly hate, but more or less to fail understand the purpose of. And, yeah, I can see how that's true: 'One More Gen is mostly a generic sex box above all else, which isn't really out of place for Mimi (she put Honey on her most raw and honest record, after all, and we all know what that one's about) but this song is also kind of awkwardly put together and a little less reliant on the sleek sound that we've all came to expect from Mariah, treading the edge between sounding just as cool as Caution's other gold mines, and sounding a little poorly thought out. It is my least favorite song from Caution, sometimes switching places with Stay Long Love You, but the sad truth is that both of those still bop.

**jamesfog** (7): Meh

**nooodisaster** (7): honestly i understand why she's so eager to freak as much as possible, this bitch only got a few years left till menopause.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (7): quite chill.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I do like this but it’s a bit forgettable and the “one mo gen” sounds so, so forced, unfortunately.

**MrSwearword** (5): too bland for criticism

**Brendon-Urine** (4): I had to look up what One Mo' Gen meant and honestly... why? This doesn't need to exist

**selegend** (4): me when i need more money for yet another concert

yo I hate to be *that* annoying woke person but pop music and pop culture as a whole has a big problem with this kind of derogatory feeling towards older women which shows how the intersection of gender and ageism targets women especially (middle-aged men get to be daddies and silver foxes, women get mocked as "cougars" for wanting to still be able to fuck in their middle age) so I feel like comments like this are a thing we shouldn't do here idk js

It's taking everything to resist the urge to make Sky Ferreira jokes but ANYWAY, Miss Aguilera has now already lost half her album and its only day 1. This song in my opinion has the opposite problem of the other songs she's lost so far in that while those songs often stuck out as odd choices, theres nothing really bold or interesting about this cut.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): sky ferreira found alive but nervous

**1998tweety** (9): I like this, a nice transitional track between Pipe and Unless It's With You. Not as much of a highlight compared to the other ballads on this album, but it's good nonetheless.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Where is the 80s synthpop-inspired album Xtincta?

**MrSwearword** (8): the beat is far too much 80s throwback for such a "that fuccboi got that bomb ass dick tho" song.

**waluigiest** (8): cliche but I like it :)

**pastastic** (7.5): finally some delicious f**king music

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Christina's pipes came OUT on this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I love the slight ‘80s vibe to this song. Lyrically it’s kinda basic though, “you’re bad for me but I still love you” is a pretty common topic lately and this isn’t really a novel spin on the topic. Still, it’s pretty.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Masochist is probably the hardest song on Liberation for me to write about, even taking the album's opening instrumental into account. There's nothing too special about this track, aside from it being a nice break into simple singing before we get to the finishing ballad of this record. I guess it continues the (potentially troublesome?) theme of toxic relationships on Liberation, which is a little weird, considering the song after this is an anthem for newlyweds, but that doesn't bother me too much. I think I'm just happy Christina's not doing any unnecessary belting here, honestly.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I'm not sure if it's just album fatigue, but I'm not really feeling this song. Masochist is such a strong way to describe someone, so the chill production and weak words feel mismatched, like there's no real pain in what she's singing about.

**twat\_brained** (6.5): Rihanna did it better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): sky ferreira comment

**Leixander** (5): xtine when she was recording song

**nooodisaster** (5): The lyrics are super tell-y and even tho the song should be really relatable, I'm not getting much from it. It's literally like she took a text she sent her friend and put it to the first piano she could find.

Finally Robyn is here to give Kylie and Christina a break from the heavy lifting they've done today and take over with the next song out. A lot of you thought this song was a bit too sparse to really get excited over, so here it is bookending our day 1

---

**MrSwearword** (10): nothing to apologize for with weirdness and sparseness in an unexpectedly harmonious union

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): muted but not boring, and the transition into the next track is stunning

**SupremeShani** (9): If Honey ends up flopping in this rate, I grant permission to anyone responsible for that crime to dedicate this song to Robyn fans.

**pastastic** (8.4): the second verse kills me

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Baby, Forgive Me is not as easy of a song to get into as many others in Honey or Robyn's discography, and that's because it's a song that only becomes as good as it is when you appreciate its totality. Forming a sort of narrative trilogy with Send to Robyn Immediately and Honey, the emotional capacity Robyn displays where is incredibly fascinating. Forgiveness on its own is a powerful trigger for an audience reaction that most media creators woefully ignore, and here such thoughts are combined with a sort of subtle sensuality and skeptical show of innocence that you'll find a lot to unpack from all the simple statements Robyn makes here on their own. Telling the song's subject to be brave, wise, and 'nice', Baby, Forgive Me is a reminder to us all that Honey indeed has a human element to it; one has to wonder if homo sapiens really is the dying race within the world Robyn lives in, considering it's such good music.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Lacks an ending but is pleasant.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): im baby (forgive me)

**waluigiest** (7): i’m baby

**radiofan15** (6.2): Love the vocoder harmony but this song kinda goes nowhere... it kinda feels like an interlude leading to Send To Robin Immediately, and maybe it is!

**1998tweety** (6): Erm this is not it at all, also those weird deeper voices creep me out and are not needed.

**nooodisaster** (5): I don't find this melodically interesting enough to justify the length.

**jamesfog** (0): Never liked this one
