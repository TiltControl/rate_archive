https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bns0bq/2018_comebacks_reveal_day_3_come_get_your_honey/

So we've finally made it to day 3, the battle for the Iron Throne of Gay Diva Worship. Standing pretty in her throne room in the red keep is Mariah Lannister, with 7 out of the top 15 songs left belonging to her. Her challengers: Robyn Stormborne,  who lost a few important pets on her way but still has 4 songs left. Left behind in Winterfell but plotting her revenge is Chstina Aguilera with 2 good songs left. And the sonic chameleon, woman of many faces and genres, Kylie Minogue might just keep on Dancing and land a sudden devastating blow to whoever is left with the 2 deadly bangers at her disposal

So we start our day off with a very Mariah ballad. Nothing much i could say that isnt already better said by u/yourhostandpatron in their comment so please check out that out (and all their comments tbh)

---

**1998tweety** (10): Gorgeous track. The fade out at the end along with Mariah's whistle notes are great.

**Leixander** (10): grew on me a lot, gorgeous

**lilguavachan** (10): i can hear god....

**MrSwearword** (10): despite sporting the "damn I fucks with you" and that "loved you since that Bone Thugz song" bits, this song is quite beautiful; specifically on "Ooh, shots of Remy, playing Confessions and our bodies blending" which was delivered masterfully.

**radiofan15** (10): Underappreciated ballad with a sexy atmosphere, a strong hook, a subdued beat, interesting references and of course the unmistakable MUSTARD ON THE BEAT HO!

**twat\_brained** (9.7): ily u/ghost-quartet

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (9): Love a good ballad. the whistle notes are great

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Some music fans unfamiliar with Mariah often dismiss her work by assuming that her albums are full of nothing but ballads, a sad generalization that's argubaly a leftover from her troublesome Sony days. Though that description only applies to Music Box and maybe her first two records, an occasional song or cut from her latter day canon can fall into the habit of justifying that stereotype. For that reason, I've no doubt that some will see With You as 'boring', merely due to the fact that it's an RnB ballad near the very start of Caution that doesn't have as much oomph to it as, say, Portrait does. These people have the right to express their thoughts on it, but I am sorry to report that they are wrong. With You may be a slow burner, but that's why it's so special: communicating an atmosphere of snowy delicacy as it calls back to thoughts of the past, even referencing Breakdown, a highly personal single from 1997's Butterfly that failed to succeed on the charts despite critical acclaim, With You is a subtle yet chilling journey into a relationship that reveals the totality of Mariah's emotions. It's melancholy, it's intimate, it carries a touch of regret, and it's yet another great display of Mimi's stunning talent. The song always stood out to me as one likely to be unfairly judged, and seeing as my love for it has grown, I can only help that Popheads will take the smart road and be kind. Otherwise, the subreddit will see the extent of my fury.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Me?

**jamesfog** (8.5): A ballop

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I could legit cry to this song, and I know I'm going to cry if this song get trashed in the rate. She serves some soft and dreamy vocals here, but the parts where she breaks out of that whisper tone are the standouts for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): mimi on autopilot is still gr8

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This song, and this album in general, has grown on me a lot. It’s a simple Mariah track and it’s a bit too whispery at times but the delivery and lyrics are actually surprisingly sweet. The chorus is way better than it has any right to be, and how are you going to not smile when you hear “MUSTARD ON THE BEAT” like honestly.

**waluigiest** (8): timeless

**Banananaise** (6.5): boring but also not the worst

**nooodisaster** (6): "Damn I fucks with you" is the only worthwhile part of this song.

**selegend** (6): her vocals are kinda awkward in this song

**Brendon-Urine** (4.5): Is this album going to be nothing but boring, mid tempo chill vibes? I'm not about it.

Monument showcases the power of giving Robyn an epic,sprawling, experimental musical canvass go go all out in. This feels like taking  a molly trip through space and meeting your maker, in other words an out of body experience. Still, a lot of you fucking hated this for its length and honestly get some taste!

**Leixander** (10): mesmerizing

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is a chillwave classic

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I was tempted to give this a ten just because it's almost a ten minute song, and I always love an unexpected saxophone.

**nooodisaster** (8): The first 2 minutes of this is an 11. It never reaches the same highs but it's thrilling to see Robyn partake in such experimental electronic. sips teacup

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This didn’t need to be this long.

**radiofan15** (1): You're telling me that I could have watched the entirety of Endgame again instead of listening to this bare bones electro song with Ariana drums and like 27 minutes of depressing sax solo at the end? and people dare to complain about Justin Timberlake's songs

We continue our Mariah listening party with Portrait, the final track from Caution and a classic Mariah ending ballad. Mariah gets introspective here, looking to her past in a bittersweet, heartwrenching yet hopefulway. Comments were almost all positive so chalk up this placement to classic popheads balladphobia

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the lyricism whew

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): After a primarily electronic based album she left us with something purely acoustic, and she just takes us to fucking church. Mariah is like, the queen of lush beautiful ballads, and it’s amazing that thirty years into her career she’s still managing to turn out fresh ones. Hard hitting lyrics, lush melodies, heavenly vocals, *emotions*, Mariah knew exactly how to close out this album.

**lilguavachan** (10): god i'm just such a whore for good piano ballads

**MNREDR** (10): A captivating album closer. Mariah's voice doesn't have that affected tone you hear in some of the other songs here, it's just pure, natural emotion. It sounds impressively like one of her classic ballads.

**MrSwearword** (10): a beautiful song, thank christ this closes the album.

**radiofan15** (10): Classic Mariah uplifting ballad a la Outside/Petals/Mariah's Theme... but classic Mariah is better than most pop girls so we must stan

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (10): Every mariah album needs an introspective ballad. its her best in years.

**jamesfog** (9.5): Beautiful

**Leixander** (9.5): that crying woman that shakes her fists gif

**auxjuan** (9): What a stunning closer.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): I'm SO glad the album ended well at least. This is a beatiful track, the piano backing is fantastic and Mariah's voice is gorgeous.

**waluigiest** (9): this is grand beautiful elegant miss Mariah brought it all back together

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Portrait reminds me incredibly well of all those heart-wrenching ballads that Mariah used to end her albums with back in the 90s, when she was at the height of her popularity. Heck, the lady admitted that her first five albums all had a depressing finale until she released Rainbow, which I, coincidentally, also see as one of her worst releases. Portrait is a return to the melancholy depths of that tradition, and it's no less the better, acting as a sort of spiritual sibling to Looking In from 1995's Fantasy. Though Mariah is in a better place in her life now, Portrait shows that she's still struggling, and that she's willing to acknowledge her dark past; in a way, such a method of release makes me less worried for her than I should be.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A piano ballad to end an album is a bit unoriginal, but if it ain't broke don't fix it.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): This is a classic Mariah ballad, it has a beautiful bittersweet sound to it and the violins at the end are gorgeous, but I feel like she should have gone way harder with either the vocals or the lyrics.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): cute closer for a cute album

**nooodisaster** (7): The lyrics are quite good. IDK, I never get the SAD from Mariah ballads.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A touching closer, but it’s not as emotional as I wish it was? Maybe I’m biased against the ballads but this is just okay

Christina goes back to her bread and butter: emotionally resonant ballads that showcase her powerful voice. This is a throwback to her earlier work like "Hurt" and is similar to the last song out Portrait in that its more of an introspective ballad about the way she's lived her life. Continuing on the main themes of her album, Christina is saying she has no regrets on how shes handled her life and career, and even though shes a little scared and confused about what the meaning of it all is, shes gonna move on with confidence in her choices. This is a top track of Liberation for me and many other, but from what i can tell its pretty hard for ballads to get the highest scores across the board here

---

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this is a gorgeous emotion filled song. Despite not having a bridge, the song has great pacing and doesn't feel too long or too short. Xtina's vocals in the very last chorus are top tier and bring the song to a whole new level of emotion. Honestly this song deserved to be among her Hall Of Fame of ballads.

**jamesfog** (10): A beautiful ballad

**Leixander** (10): vocals come thru

**lilguavachan** (10): finally some good fucking food

**MrSwearword** (10): a subtle ballad done fabulously and another one of Christina's best songs ever.

**twat\_brained** (10): see, what I love about this is that feels like a throwback to Back to Basics. Hell, it even sounds like it could be a cut from her debut album! I didn't think I'd be giving a 10 on this album but here we are. Would love more sparsely instrumented ballads from Xtina like this

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This is the type of ballad that I want to hear from Christina, and it helps there are layers to her vocal delivery here instead of her usual strained belts. The sparse piano helps accentuate some of the best lyrics she has ever sung, and I think she has never sounded more beautiful.

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Christina Aguilera hails from a time in pop music where ballads dominated radio thanks to the vocal capacities of the artists performing them, a quality which has made some people dismiss the concept of slow pop songs as a whole due to the intense amount of oversaturation such a strategic move naturally results in. Twice, however, is proof that Christina, despite her infamous reputation as a woman who can produce shrieks to end all other shrieks, is thoughtful and talented enough to pull a ballad off without resorting to such cheap tactics. Every aspect of Twice, including its lyricism, production, and backing piano instrumental, all come together to lead such a heartwrenching song that Christina's excellent vocal execution to top it all off can be simply too gorgeous for many listeners to comprehend. Twice makes use of the best imagery and techniques possible, and it's the best kind of ballad we could have hoped for.

**radiofan15** (8): Quite the mood breaker after two strong tracks... although Chamaleontina snaps with her vocals as usual

**agentofscranton** (7): stream fancy on spotify and all other streaming services

**waluigiest** (7): it gets the job done and sounds good but doesn’t leave me feeling anything special

Our first Robyn song of the day, this just narrowly missed the top ten after hovering around the bottom of it for a  lot of the rate. What's probably one of the boppier songs on the album, this song is just pure fun as Robyn channels some 90's house vibes and gives us this club banger

---

**waluigiest** (11): sometimes songs can just reaffirm your homosexuality. My jaw dropped like thrice listening to this song the first time oh my GOD. This song is crystalline and every added layer makes it pop.

**auxjuan** (10): An absolute banger.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): amazing 90s house vibes ugh

**JunkyGS** (10): 2nd pick for my 11.

**Leixander** (10): bop this album needed!

**lilguavachan** (10): i know people don't seem to love this song too, and that's a shame because it's such a cute little club bop

**SupremeShani** (10): I feel like although the song starts off slow, the moment that house inspired beat kicks in for the chorus is when I lose my shit.

**pastastic** (9.6): Strong contender for the 11 though.

**twat\_brained** (9.4): this is like gran turismo menu music or something you'd hear in a Mediterranean hotel lobby and I just love it

**radiofan15** (9.3): Once again the production outshines the song itself but even here Robyn knows what is she doing... this 90s dancey production is everything

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I've seen Honey described as a post-disco record before, and while I'm not familiar with what that description entails, I can clearly see the influence disco has on Honey as entire album. Between the Lines is one of the greatest displays of all the good this heritage creates. A funky, sexual track that relies more on ambiguity and rhythm than any other song on the album, the song sounds like something that could be played in a club from the 70s updated for our modern times without losing what makes its aura special. Given this subreddit's mixed thoughts on the funk elements artists like Ariana Grande have been including in their music recently, I'm a bit worried about how this will fare, but come what may be, I can still appreciate it.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Bop

**1998tweety** (8): The beat on this makes me think of a casino for some reason.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like the chorus, wish the rest of the song measured up to it.

**MrSwearword** (7): the early 90s realness is much appreciated but it falls short

**selegend** (6): peak elevator music

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song is kinda a miss for me. I really appreciate the instrumental in the chorus but a lot of this song is just kinda too barren for me and I really don’t like that background voice thing.

**nooodisaster** (5): My boyfriend told me lines don't exist in real life and now I'm like... what the fuck.

Mariah took on a lot of new collaborators while working on Caution and this Skrillex produced track shows the benefits of experimentation. Sampling her iconic Butterfly track on top of a trap beat, Mariah sings about inspiration and self confidence or sumn. Not really sure, as this is this song is more about the production than lyrics honestly. For some reason left off the main labum and made a Japan exclusive, this was legit hard to find on th internet

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This should’ve been on the album, the way she samples Butterfly...

**radiofan15** (9.5): Imagine thinking Stay Long Love You with the whackiest rapper this side of Lil Baby (i'm talking about Gunna AKA Younger Thug) deserved to be on the album instead of this masterpiece

**SupremeShani** (9): I was so confused because the video linked to listen to this song opened up with Butterfly, and I thought this was just an excuse to rate Butterfly.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Bop

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (8): I love butterfly and we belong together so the song is already good in my eyes

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Her sampling herself is obviously iconic but it’s easy to see why this didn’t make the album proper. It wouldn’t fit sonically and also it’s also just kind of a middling track. It feels… unfinished, almost? It gets some energy towards the second half but it takes a while to get there.

**NachoLiterary** (6): this was legit hard to find!

**MrSwearword** (1): what the fuck is this shit

One of the most hyped up tracks when the tracklist was revealed and it did not disappoint! Seeing Mariah work with super acclaimed indie act Blood Orange (who did All That for Carly) was super exciting, while at the same time seeing an old name like Slick Rick was just as reassuring that shed stick to her classic style. Giving me Life is a six minutes of pure ethereal

---

**MNREDR** (11): I'm not really feeling the Eddie Murphy spoken lines (or maybe I just don't get the reference), but this song is a masterpiece. Props to Slick Rick for a rap feature that is not only tolerable - not every song has that - but genuinely enjoyable.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (11): One of my favourites EVER!!! the last 2 minutes are the best. Instant classic in my eyes. 6 minutes of heaven

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): literally her best song in like 20+ years omg it's gorgeous and such a VIBE

**Leixander** (10): perfection

**lilguavachan** (10): god i love blood orange, popheads let me give 11s to multiple songs challenge [2]

**nooodisaster** (10): We love dark tinged R&B that's 6+ minutes long. For those complaining about the length: https://i.imgur.com/V00aysS.gif

**radiofan15** (10): GODDAMNIT this is a banger and a half... that outro is heavenly, Mariah sounds so lovely here, the writing paints such a great picture, the Slick Rick feature works amazingly and of course HEY BABY WHAT'S HAPENNING HOW YOU DOING WE CAN MAKE IT BABY ME AND YOU ME AND YOU ME AND YOU... Fuck, Mariah is a genius when it comes to sampling

**SupremeShani** (10): We stan Blood Orange in this house. I feel like the immaculate production makes the mediocre lyrics stand out even more, but Mariah's vocals are here to save it all, and that transition into the moody half of the song is everything.

**tevinterimperium** (10): If I didn't already give my 11 to Accelerate, I would give it to this song. It's sooooooooooo fucking good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is a collaboration dreamed in heaven and my god does it deliver. This was so incredibly close to being my 11 but it just narrowly missed out. Mariah sounds a little shaky on this record, and while it doesn’t detract that much, on here she sounds so comfortable. Slick Rick’s verse fits in so well, and Blood Orange’s production on this is literally flawless. The synths wind up, the guitar tantalizes, and the drums slap - this is probably one of the best songs Mariah has done in a very long time. It’s over 6 minutes and it doesn’t feel like it’s too long. This song is so great and easily one of my favorite tracks last year, I am so glad this exists and lived up to the hype.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): It's always a moment of joy when Mariah takes the high road and collaborates with hip hop artists and producers who are worth the coin that she's built instead of picking the sort of absolute nobodies her 00s work tended to be infiltrated with. Giving Me Life, which I'd go as far as to call the twenty-first century's answer to Killing Me Softly, is a perfect example of just how brilliant Mariah's music can be when she decides to both make use of the connections she's capable of taking advantage of along with her vast knowledge of what makes rhythm and blue in order to produce a track that succeeds in what it reaches for to the greatest degree imaginable. Seductive, playful, passionate and nostalgic, with just a hint of infatuation in its amorous tone, Mariah comes back better than ever with such gravitas in Giving Me Life in a way that we haven't really seen since she made The Roof that every note making up the song's composition that the glory of how good it all is will come down crashing on your mind like a tidal wave and leave you craving for more. Filled with the beautiful spell of reminiscence previously seen in the aforementioned cut, the similarly sensual production that makes both tracks so unbelievably gorgeous is aided by the ace contributions of such splendid fellows as Blood Orange and Dev Hynes. And to top it all off is that guest rap, which is simply so effortlessly flawless that the final verse at the end of the song might as well haunt your mind forever. And I use to dread that ending crescendo of chaos, but you know what? It gives such a sharply damning atmosphere to everything else that that extra minute is just  unquestionably the space it's given. Yes, I'm not making Giving Me Life my 11 because it isn't likely to win (knowing my luck, it's gonna place first after this) and because my duty as a stan makes me determined to defeat the Swedish Lady, but make no mistake; this is, in my opinion, the best song in this rate. And, heck, it may be one of the best things Mariah has ever released. I think I may have sold my soul to the devil by not giving it the score it should properly receive, and that's alright. I deserve it. Let me be the new Faustus, then. The tea is that Mariah is the new Queen of Heaven, the new Mother of God, and I am her humble yet shamefully disobedient servant. I should be struck by a lightning bolt any time now, and I'm going to accept my fate. Folks, don't follow my example. Please recognize how much of a crowning achievement is for your own damn safety. I don't want to see you where I'm going.

**1998tweety** (8.8): I used to not appreciate this but holy hell it's got melodies and production and whew. The features actually go pretty well with the track.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I think that the best Mariah Carey tracks are the ones with at least a few weird lyrics, and this is no exception. With a chorus built around a silly piece of slang and references to Barbra Streisand and Marilyn Monroe, this is such a silly little track that Mariah elevates effortlessly. Slick Rick is there, he doesn’t add much but he’s also not distracting. The song drags a little bit towards the end though. The outro is lovely but goes on a bit too long, it gets to a lovely point eventually but there’s a weird dip in the energy before it gets there. I wish it had been a separate track like the interludes on *Memoirs* were.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): This is the first song on the album I can truly say I liked. Mariah does a fantastic job on the chorus.

**jamesfog** (7.5): Too long

**pastastic** (7.5): ooooooooooOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

**twat\_brained** (7.2): I heard "DeRulo" and my heart sank, I thought this song was ruined. Thank fuck that didn't happen. This'll probably still be the weakest song on the album but all the songs have either been great or sensational so I'm not even annoyed. That said… if you're gonna make a song total 6 minutes you'd better put them all to good use, like Madonna did with "Like a Prayer" and "Hung Up". That hasn't happened here.

**selegend** (7): okay devonte!!

**MrSwearword** (6): the title is a stretch to say the least but it could've been far, far worse

**waluigiest** (6): it’s too long and a lot of it isn’t good. But the outro…. Wow

MrSwearword: With a score of 2:4:1:3, Mariah maintains her lead as she nearly dominated half of the Top 10. Not far from her is Robyn who managed to hang on to 3 songs of her own. Kylie survives the 5 song slog with her two bangers and Christina took another crucial blow as she's down to 1.

Our first contender for the Iron Throne is out, as here is where Christina's hopes die at #10. Christina employs english rapper GoldLink for this sleek, sexy duet where Christina actually shows restraint in her vocals and plays up the mature, sexy, confidant woman in the lyrics. Easily the best song off the album and prime lead single candidate, this was weirdly ignored by Christina and her team and never really got a push as a single. Still, the Grammys noticed and nominated her for best rap sung duo in 2019, a nice consolation for a very rocky era for Christina. This song had a tragic trip from the top 5 in the rankings to here during the last few weeks of voting, but narrowly managed to hang on and fight off Giving Me Life

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): was not expecting this to be as great as it is! wow!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Clearly the best song on the album, it’s so slick and the two of them are sitting on that beat just right. This, for me, is the best display of Christina’s star power on this album. Yes we know she can belt sonic booms but it’s the swag that she oozes during this track that impresses me the most out of anything on this album. This is the kind of song that a legend gets to put out, I hear this song and I think “that’s a star right there.” It’s a little too long for my tastes but I think that’s more my problem than the song’s.

**jamesfog** (10): A smooth Grammy-nominated bop

**lilguavachan** (10): she must've been hot in the ass at this point in the album, just out here trying to liberate that dick

**MrSwearword** (10): one of Christina's best songs ever. Why the fuck wasn't this the lead single?

**radiofan15** (10): GODDAMN WHY WASN'T THIS RELEASED A A SINGLE XTINCTA?!?!? IT TRULY DESERVED

**SupremeShani** (10): Christina and Goldlink play off each other so well here, I feel like this production is so slick and where Christina shines. The beat combined with that whimsical air flute melody brings a real fun and flirty vibe to the whole thing that offers a fun break way better than Right Moves does.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I was lukewarm on this track when it dropped, but my god is this one of the best songs in the whole rate. It’s the rare rap collab that not only doesn’t feel like it’s haphazardly stitched together, but both the instrumental and the main artist work around the feature. There’s a surprising chemistry on this track, the instrumental is way better than it has any right to be, and Christina brings energy and personality with a chorus that just impresses me. Also, the song is quite long but it doesn’t really overstay its welcome, and I think it’s because Christina leans into this feature instead of letting them just do their thing. It’s a shame because I really wish there was more like this on the record, but oh well, what are you gonna do.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): There are few songs in our modern musical canon as sleek as Like I Do, and that alone makes the song possess a beauty that leaves it deserving of the surprise nomination it snatched from the Grammys. Upon hearing the magic of Liberation fof for first time, Like I Do just managed to be one of those songs that stood out in almost every way almost immediately. GoldLink's verse at the beginning is atypical, but smooth, sensual, witty and perfect in combining both old and new: Christina continues the brilliant of Like I Do by carrying it on with a sassy, confident energy that proves she can put her heart into efforts that don't involve nothing more than belting into a microphone. There is a reference to Marvin Gaye that's unfortunately similar to something of a greater evil, but that's nothing compared to all the life Like I Do exudes.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Again, I do not know who the feature is but he delivers hard. Xtina and Goldlink go really well together.

**waluigiest** (9): this is just well done

**twat\_brained** (6.4): "you already know my story, you were raised in all my glory" dear God it's like she wants to continue the Britney comparisons

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Marvin Gaye and get it on... is this Charlie Puth shade?

**NachoLiterary** (5): features are getting worse... i'm uncle phil, you're my aunt viiiiiiv

**nooodisaster** (5): If it was half the length it might be a fun little track.

yatcho: # Liberation

---

**Overall Average**: 7.306 **// Average Controversy:** 2.023

---

**1998tweety** (9.292): My favourite album in the rate. Lot's of great songs with tons of highs but not many lows. Definitely made me want to listen to a bunch of Xtina's older stuff as well.

**radiofan15** (8.983): This was the first Xtina album in 6 years and the second I listened front-to-back since Bionic and I couldn't believe how much I loved it... I understand that she doesn't care about commercial success anymore but, unlike the botched Lotus and it's too-ahead-of-its-time Bionic, this could have smashed with a little bit more of effort, as it has hits for days! [Score: A-]

**yourhostandpatron** (8.250): In a year full of mediocre drops, Liberation was one of my biggest surprises of 2018. Before it was released, I had a general dislike of Christina thanks to misconceptions of her stemming from how much I used to love Britney (and I still do adore her, though she's not the type of act I stan anymore). But when Liberation was released, I decided to take a chance and listen to what she had to offer, and I'm very happy that I chose to do so before this rate even came up on the table. Full of pop hooks that explore their sounds without straying too far from the iconic image Christina's made for herself, Liberation is a very pleasing reminder as to how pop icons can have a wide appeal and remain incredibly creative at the same time. It's a record that has more depth to it than you think it would have, and it's made me hope that Christina will still be remembered in the years to come. I can't say that I've found the time to check out her older music, but Liberation has definitely improved my opinion of her, and more listens to it will always boost that opinion further.

**CreepyMannequin** (8.250): One of my favorite albums from 2018 and definitely in my Top 3 for Xtina, although she makes it hard with so many great albums!

**MrSwearword** (8.000): a pretty good album that had one of the worst lead singles this side of Give Me All Your Luvin

**therokinrolla** (7.833): 8/10 Like Caution, this album feels very confident in itself. She's given us an album that is happy to be nothing but itself, which is a great thing for a legendary artist who is no longer at their peak. Sometimes the album can feel like it's chasing after trends, but when it does it does it solidly. The album moves backwards and forwards through different sounds which keep you interested to see what's next. Sadly, at the end of the album she gets caught up in several tracks that don't really seem like they're striving for anything other than to be there. It's textbook filler. However, the overall offering is very solid, especially with Christina's ever soaring voice.

**selegend** (7.667): i already did the aoty writeup for this which barely got any upvotes compared to the rest so im out of imagination and inspiration

**twat\_brained** (7.117): It's an Xtina album so let's hope the first half is good enough that the second half's tapering in quality won't entirely undo the album. moreover why are there so many collabs?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.058): I’d say that this is the weakest album in the rate, Christina had ideas here but she didn’t follow through on them as cleanly as the other women did. There are one too many ballads and the upbeat songs don’t quite land like they should, but there are a few genuine hits on here. I’m still waiting for Christina to pull out another classic/ahead of its time album and I don’t think that this was it.

**waluigiest** (6.833): this album is not very cohesive but has some big strong moments

**TragicKingdom1** (6.708): This album is a step in the right direction for Christina, as doing generic electropop was clearly doing her no favors for her legacy. I wouldn't say anything here is show-stopping but it's definitely impressive how smoothly she fits in with a modern R&B style. Unfortunately, dragging down the project is "Accelerate" which I think was one of the worst songs of 2018 and is borderline unlistenable. With that song excluded it would be more of a B+, but as it is it is a [Grade: B].

**nooodisaster** (6.542): 6/10. There's no where else to say this, so HOLY SHIT the cover!! She legit looks younger on it than her debut album in 1999.

Mariah continues to make interesting production decisions here on The Distance, one of the promo singles for Caution. Opening the track is a cheerleading chant for SPIRIT, which im not sure what it has to do with the rest of the song but it sounds great to me and the hook is amazing. Ty dolla sign proves to finally not be controversial here and fits in very nicely

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): HEY HEY LET'S HEAR IT!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): That *hook* is to die for. This is such a smartly constructed song, for something so restrained it really fills the room. The way the effects layer in and the melodies/vocals build the song slowly begins to sprawl out, gradually “going the distance.” Ty Dolla $ign is one of those rappers who I kind of roll my eyes at when I see him featured on a pop song (I know nothing about his solo music but I’ve rarely heard him be more than just *there* on a pop track) but he’s actually a pretty good addition to the track because he keeps the track grounded while Mariah spreads her wings a little bit.

**jamesfog** (10): A boppp

**nooodisaster** (9.9): The kids at the beginning get my 11, that SLAPS!! The bitch stole my album title tho, so I gotta deduct some points.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Ty Dolla Sign is a KING of features; him and Mariah going surprisingly well together. The last bit of the song where they sing on top of each other is amazing.

**radiofan15** (9.2): I like the 80s vibe and the chanting the bookends the track but Ty Dolla is wasted doing the adlibs and with a really short verse... it's a shame Accelerate was his peak

**twat\_brained** (8.3): wherever they're going, they're not gonna get there by accelerating as Ty had previously attempted in this rate.

**pastastic** (8): I'm a sucker for retro bullshit

**SupremeShani** (8): I like the way the vocals get stronger as the song goes on and the little cheerleader chant vocals were cute.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I almost gave this a 10 just to make my rating of Ty Dolla $ign a parallel of Fantano giving a Kid Cudi album a 0/10 and later on a 10/10

**yourhostandpatron** (8): The Distance was originally planned to be Caution's 'true' lead single, although the addition of GTFO onto the album may have screwed that label up. Either way, whether we're still going to call it our first formal introduction to Caution or not, its purpose is more than a little obvious. References to publicity and reputation, the usual celebrity gossip we have to deal with as either a devotee or as the leader of cult, and a guest bridge from none other than a paragon of apathy like Ty Dolla $ign makes its hidden intent more apparent if the genre-savy listener already knows where to look. On a record that's as suprisingly tight as it is, the Distance's placement in Caution's smack middle may be glaringly obvious, but what's forgivable about that is that the song is genuinely a good herald for Mimi's current era. No, it's not the best from this album by a longshot, but despite all the flair the Distance presents that you may be slightly bothered by, it also present a graciously satisfying sense of triumph. Arriving at the scene after yet another troublesome moment in Mariah's life, its gratifying yet worldly flavor is one that makes one thing clear: no matter what she's gone through, and no matter how rough the last couple of album cycles have been, Mariah is still thriving. That's what matters in the end. Also, Ty's appearance is weirdly attuned to a fantastic release of escasty, so maybe you can forgive him for this one.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (7): Slow grower.

**waluigiest** (6): it takes us a sec but we eventually go the distance

Runner up on the Bonus rate! This again, follows in the same vein of Joanne-ified country pop but Kylie turns it up to 11 and gives us a massive banger. No idea how this didnt make the cut for the main tracklist

---

**jamesfog** (10): Robbed of standard and single

**MNREDR** (10): This would have been my 11 if it had been on the standard album. This song set the bar so high, all the other deluxe tracks (and quite a few of the standard tracks) are trash in comparison.

**rootbeer\_surge** (10): runner up for my 11, tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Not as country as the rest of the album but I love the expansive, spacey feeling of it. This track gives me drama! I love the spoken word bridge.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): wtf this slaps where was this on the album

**Banananaise** (8.5): deserved better

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): verses are much better than the chorus which is so weird for kylie

The lead single from this new album, Mariah turned heads as she took a dramatic new turn sonically by taking a major sample from a Porter Robinson song and pitching up her vocals to Chippette levels. Kind of weird to listen to at first, this one grows on you massively on repeat listens as you catch more of Mariah telling this dude off hilariously while looking stunning in the music video

---

**radiofan15** (11): Sorry Xtina, but this is the song that started my 6-months journey into becoming a Lamb... i'm not sure if i'm one yet but I'm loving almost everything Mariah has put so far. The Porter Robinson sample is lovely and heavenly and used in such a great way, her whispery vocals has Selena shook, the lyrics are angsty enough but overwhelming and, frankly, also quite funny... and of course I can fuck with this vibe. Thank you Stella for help her deliver this immaculate chill bop!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): dedicating this song to everyone who scores this under a 9

**jamesfog** (10): So lush

**Leixander** (10): this made me a fan of hers and now i am an official late bloomer TM lamb

**lilguavachan** (10): honestly.... the power of opening an album with telling some shithead to get the fuck out...

**selegend** (10): i’m always apprehensive when someone uses an acronym as a song title but this one was perfect. the perfect comeback for mariah tbh

**SupremeShani** (10): Only Mariah can tell someone to get the fuck out in such a beautiful tone. I didn't like this song when it dropped, but it quickly became a favorite of mine over time. It's quite a departure from her typical powerhouse vocals, but she sounds so ethereal with this dreamy production, and the abrasive lyrics bring an edge to the song to keep it from being too monotone.

**waluigiest** (10): a lush song for when someone is still in your bed post h**k-up and you want them gone!!!

**ZankeeZero** (10): wig

**1998tweety** (9.5): A chill nice opener to the album (and era). Shows that Mariah doesn't have to use her incredible vocals to make a great song.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): if you don't like this song then do as Mariah says

**nooodisaster** (9): This is the definition of feminine masculinity and I won't explain myself further.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): it sounds so pleasant even though she’s roasting someone

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): GTFO was, in some twisted way, chosen to be the lead single for Caution, even if it was originally intended to be shelved in favor of...who knows? Maybe Runaway was intended to be a part of Caution's tracklist until Mariah decided to include GTFO for some reason. The thing is, as much as we may lament the loss of whatever disappeared from the standard edition of this record, you can't deny that GTFO still has a cool, sleek, mellow yet paradoxically impatient vibe to it that really just shows the best of Mimi's skill. A song that's perhaps most adequately described as a grower rather than an immediate standout, you'll never really learn to love GTFO until you understand just how powerful Mariah's sass is in this track. Her words and lyricism elevate the already promising atmosphere of GTFO into a new level of pleasantly cruel, and, overall, the song can be called something of a mid-tempo slapper. Thanks for the music, Mimi!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I never imagined that Mariah Carey would sample Porter Robinson of all people, but here we are. This song has this beautiful late night feel to it and while the melody and performance aren’t bad, I think the song leans a little heavily on the sample.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (8): fun start. Reminds me of shake it off (by Mariah)

**MrSwearword** (7): aside from memery hurting it, this song still feels like it doesn't go anywhere despite the production trying its best

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I really didn’t dig this one when it dropped because it felt a little too reliant on the Porter Robinson sample but it’s grown on me. The vocals are still a bit too strained and awkward, and the outro is quite weird fading out. That said, the hook is sticky and the instrumental works pretty well in retrospect.

**Brendon-Urine** (4): This was... so boring...

Tragically missing out on the top 5, the title track and absolute banger Caution. Mariah is ready to move on to a new love but watch out bitch, you better come right or its over. I gave this my 11 as more of an oddball choice, I never thought it would win and it wasnt close but over time this became my favorite track on the album. Its just so sleek and sexy with immaculate production, and Mariah is convincing as a fragile yet confidant woman

---

**1998tweety** (10): A nice chill track that gives off a sensual vibe. I especially love the end of the song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think “I’ll give up everything to be right where you are, I’ll follow you from here like you’re the Northern Star” is quite possibly the best line in the rate. This slowly became my favorite song from the album. Mariah is powerful, obviously, but I love how measured and calculated she sounds here. She’s like a snake sizing you up.

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm gonna call this "unusual synergy" between a surprisingly modern beat and Mariah firing on the right cylinders for the delivery

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): queen of safety and truth

**radiofan15** (9.5): CAUTION IT'S SO EXPLOSIVE

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This is such a smooth song that's some classic rhythm and blues, she sounds outright dangerous and seductive here.

**jamesfog** (9): Bop

**waluigiest** (9): okay this song is sweaty but in a really good way

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I'm not sure there are even adequate words to describe how much of a pop masterpiece Caution's title track is, but I guess I can try my best by typing all these useless words again like the salty journalist homo I happen to be. If I have to pinpoint something about Caution that just elevates i t into the pantheons of a perfect pop song, at least in the realm of my perspectives and opinions, then, in all likelihood, I'd probably mention how its sound almost seamlessly matches its themes. Slow to the hype meter yet seductive in its anxiousness, Caution strikes the light that made most of Butterfly sound so special by appealing to that particular sphere of emotions Mariah and her listeners share where fear is rightfully frightening, yet exciting. Mariah might warn her new lover about bridges they shouldn't burn yet again, but it's in songs like this where she's in her catchiest yet in her frankest. And isn't that quality in Mimi's music we all love? No wonder Caution is compared to her best albums.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): for everyone who says Mariah has lost her vocal abilities… well I can't speak for her live performances but on recordings… she can lay it tf down.

**nooodisaster** (8): When someone tries to say Sasha Velour isn't a worthy winner of Drag Race.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (8): the lyrics "proceed with caution" are so good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Mariah walked so Ariana could continue to walk a slightly brisker pace

A clear highlight from Golden, Kylie goes back to her disco dancefloor roots and gives us a dancefloor banger thats sure to be remembered as a gem of this album and one of her best deep cuts

---

**awryj** (10): WHOOP

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): hate that i don't have more than one 11 to give! one of the most euphoric pop songs in years, and that bridge! it's immaculate

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): THE bop of the album, possibly of the rate. I don’t need to explain to you that this song is good, you have ears, you understand. The production is a lot of fun and then Kylie gives a surprisingly restrained vocal performance that manages to be full of emotion without going so far over the top that it’s hard to listen to. I’m genuinely baffled that Kylie never made this a full on single because it really could have smashed.

**jamesfog** (10): BOP!!

**lilguavachan** (10): high horse's glitzy sister

**MNREDR** (10): Kylie's music has been described as "infectious glittery bops" by the iconic Nekci Menij Show and this song could not be a more literal example. Whoop!

**MrSwearword** (10): Disco solves all the world's problems, country music no exception.

**skargardin** (10): Pride anthem YAS

**SupremeShani** (10): The way she sings this takes me back to some of the standouts in her older albums, just some fun, easy listening, feel good music.

**waluigiest** (10): YES this is beautiful interesting fun folksy WOOP

**hikkaru** (9): best song on the album buried so deep smh

**rotating3Dtext** (9): love the bass

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): this song has transported me to the dancefloor

**1998tweety** (8.7): This is fun

**radiofan15** (8.5): And Kylie said, “Let there be gay rights,” and there was gay rights.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): would've liked more of these Hi-NRG tunes a bit earlier

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Raining Glitter is the closest Golden ever gets to inspiration past its glorious opening track, and thankfully it deserves all the acclaim it gets. Combining elements of disco with country in the vein of Kacey Musgraves songs such as  Lonely Weekend and High Horse, Raining Glitter is glorious yet painful in the sense that it represents what Golden should have been; a fun, campy record mixing a bit of country magic with Kylie's magnificent presence as a cultural icon, carrying an aura of uniqueness to it whilst still attracting even the most basic homosexuals on Earth. I'm sad the rest of the album wasn't like this, but, thankfully, the song is too much of a bop for me to dwell on my frustration about this.

**effervescentemu** (8.2): Makes me wanna twirl through the neighbourhood sprinkling glitter

**Banananaise** (8): popheads liked this song because it was the most dance pop track on the album but it's just not that great compared to other Kylie dance pop tracks! Kylie doing new stuff awkwardly is better than her doing old stuff mediocrely

**pastastic** (7.3): I'm gay for V-VI resolutions.

**selegend** (7): kim wishes she could woo-ahh this good tbh

The closing track on Honey, Robyn takes a stand: she'll never let these fuckbois break her heart again! And it's relatable, and quite a bop with probably the most accessible production on the album, so it made it as far as non singles can seemingly get all the way to #5

---

**Banananaise** (10): (me marching down the street with 1000000 angry protestors chanting) NEVER GONNA BE BROKEN HEARTED E V E R A G A I N!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): so funky and fun! love the climax at the end ugh her mind

**jamesfog** (10): Best non-single periodt

**MrSwearword** (10): what a cute way to close this album

**radiofan15** (10): Arguably the most traditional song on the album, this is such a nice break after so many artsy passages that not always works... the funky bass and catchy chorus aren't exactly original but they work amazingly as intended. Not sure if this is an adequate closer, but it's a great breathy song nonetheless

**skargardin** (10): Another 11 contender, fantastic production

**static\_int\_husp** (10): A much simpler track than my other 10s on this album, but also delivers a very fun, danceable track.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Robyn closes Honey, one of the few critically beloved albums of 2018, by stating that she's only going to sing silly love songs from now on until the rest of her days. Lord knows how this probably isn't true, but that's what Ever Again is, and the honest truth of the manner is that Ever Again is beautiful. Whether Robyn's prediction concerning that aspect of her life is true or not, her soft, dreamy whispers on Ever Again as a track are prone to convince you that the lady's just fooled herself, and that she'll get into the heavens easily. Ever Again as a whole strikes the delicate balance between hurt and hope, and personally, I'm here for it!

**SupremeShani** (9): I never realized I was such a fan of Robyn until I looked at how high I rated every song on this album, and this song is no exception.

**twat\_brained** (8.8): brilliant way to close out such a solid album

**1998tweety** (8.5): A nice closer, the bass on this is awesome.

**nooodisaster** (8): Omg I misheard the lyrics and my entire comment is null so umm... nicely job Robyn.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This really sounds like a subdued Tame Impala Robyn track and it’s great.

**waluigiest** (8): for slow solo dancing at the club

Robyn's first single in what felt like an eternity, Missing U came like a force of nature with a stellar dancefloor house instrumental under Robyn's signature sad lyrics. Looking deeper thogh, it's clear this is less about missing a past lover but more about missing her fans, the ones that kept her fire going into her 20th year of her career. A standout that starts the album on the right foot, it makes a very respectable 4th place finisher

---

**CarlieScion** (11): my fcking fave

**rosesmp3** (11): robyn is the queen of sad bangers and this is one of her best ones imo dancing with dears in my eyes indeed

**rotating3Dtext** (11): was my introduction to Robyn… I feel it conveys emotion well for how minimalist it kinda is

**static\_int\_husp** (11): When I first listened to this album last year, I was not impressed by this track. As I have listened more into Robyn's discography in the last months, however, I have come to see that this is a classic Robyn track. The pounding dance-track synths, the heartbroken lyrics, and the giant pounding chorus. This is one of a few tracks on this album that shows that Robyn has still got it.

**1998tweety** (10): Awesome production; doesn't quite hit the highs of DOMO for me but it's still a solid tune.

**auxjuan** (10): The definition of a comeback single. It works perfectly as the bridge between Body Talk and Honey.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the intro is absolutely magical, and when that one bit kicks in after those opening twinkles is like... forceful in a gorgeous way. still remember how overwhelming it felt to listen to while driving around on release day

**jamesfog** (10): A classic

**JunkyGS** (10): will prob regret not giving this my 11.

**Leixander** (10): why is this so sad all of a sudden, crying in the club

**lilguavachan** (10): a perfect segue from body talk to her new sound

**radiofan15** (10): This is ''Tweking and sucking dick and drinking your liver away while crying for the long lost love of your live'' made into a song

**SupremeShani** (10): There really is no other artist that can combine that feeling of euphoria and loneliness like Robyn can. It's amazing that she can create these songs that can be described as easy listening and chill, but leave me immersed throughout the song with the power of her production and words, and I think this song is the perfect example of that skill.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This opener is such a banger my god

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Missing U is not as experimental as some of Honey's other prominent tracks (the only other song off this record that's as accessible as it is Honey, and that's a display of beauty and sensuality that happens to transcend taste) and for that it reason it may seem paradoxical. It's not as reliant on production as Honey's backbone is going to be, but at the same time, its relatively straightforward foray into pop is a factor that makes initial listeners convinced enough to continue hearing what Robyn will have to say. As a composition on its own, Missing U is, indeed, already close to perfection. Contrasting its sacred atmosphere with  its lyrical sense of emptiness, Robyn's pronounced accent adds flair and personality to her performance, creating a universal anthem sure to appease everybody giving Honey a try for the first time. Brave, passionate and exciting, the song succeeds in making you look forward to the rest of the record it begins.

**nooodisaster** (9): Really stellar opening, and definitely one of the absolute highlights. Robyn's strengths is always putting nuanced and intelligent emotion into dance music, and she does it again here.

**twat\_brained** (9): this opener is equal pars brilliant and blissful i love it

**waluigiest** (8): beat, melody, and chords are very similar to Dancing On My Own. That’s not a bad thing

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): I've definitely liked this song the more I heard it. I absolutely love the background synth line but I wish the chorus hit more.

**hikkaru** (5): Kissin U outsold, why is this so long yet doesn't go anywhere at all?

**MrSwearword** (5): we all know which three Robyn songs this mediocre tripe tries to impersonate

The opener to Golden and lead single, Dancing is a classic Kylie dance tune that can be interpreted two ways: yeah of course by now we know Kylie is a dance floor queen and she does that whenever she goes out, but secondly Kylie is reflecting on her long career and its clear she wants to go out dancing, as in dying. A surprisingly poignant bop, here it ends Golden's run at #3

---

**1998tweety** (10): Love the wordplay on this track and that thereès an interpretation that the song is actually about death. Lines like "When you come knocking, I’ll be at your door" give it away. Lyrics aside, the song is fun too. Kylie clearly isn't trying to make a country song (and she knows it); instead, she's just taking her dance-pop style and adding country influences to it-- and it works well!

**awryj** (10): i wasn't crazy about Dancing when i first heard it (and still am not) but it grew on me a bit! it's really cute and neatly serves as the artist's statement for the record, or Kylie's entire career for that matter

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): What a fantastic way to start the album

**CarlieScion** (10): disco-country bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ah ah ah aaaaaaaah~

**J\_Toe** (10): A song about Death has never been so glamorous and fun!

**jamesfog** (10): Bop

**Leixander** (10): aaaaaaHAAAAAAA

**MrSwearword** (10): A refreshing lead single from the One True Kylie and one of her best songs ever. Insane replay value.

**NachoLiterary** (10): giving me gloria bell trailer teas

**static\_int\_husp** (10): short and sweet. very enjoyable and of course super danceable

**SupremeShani** (10): I will never forgive the users here who tricked me into believing this was some country song when it dropped, making me discover this bop much too late. There's something really beautiful about the verses and the chorus is the definition of pop euphoria.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Lil Nas X retired after he heard this track

**twat\_brained** (9.4): I find when I go out, which is usually on my own, and is just to go see a film or to a concert or hang out in a club, I wanna go dancing. So I resonate with Kylie here.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): it’s so fun

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Ok Kylie I SEE YOU. This schlaps

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I remember when I first heard this song I was like “so it’s about dying, right?” and then the music video came out and confirmed it so thanks Kylie for satisfying my need to be right about everything! This is a very smart song in that it functions on those two different levels, it could very easily be a song about going out to the club to dance but in the context of Kylie’s life and career it gains that extra level of meaning. I like how she brings the audience into the message of the song in that last verse. This is a song that’s really grown on me since I first heard it, I remember initially giving it like a 7.5 but a year later I’m giving it a 9. I’d also like to make sure that we all know about the [Initial Talk Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_UEMNzDGA&frags=pl%2Cwn) which turns the song into an ‘80s banger. [Also I’m *begging* you all to watch this video.](https://prasejeebus.tumblr.com/post/169970265450/when-dancing-by-kylie-minogue-comes-on-at-the)

**ZankeeZero** (9): death

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I love the lyrics on this. It's basically about accepting death and having fun with the time you have left. They're defiant and age appropriate for Kylie while still being fun.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Golden may have disappointed me as an entire album, but I have to admit that it begins on a high note, even if the songs I'd include under that category are still just a little too generic for my taste. Dancing is a great, or, if you'll excuse me, a golden example of what I'm talking about. I'm not going to make a point about how it shows Kylie aging gracefully, because that'd potentially fall into troublesome territory, but as mildly surprising as it might be to hear a pop music titan like her sing the phrase 'when I go out, I wanna go dancing', I don't think I've ever seen a lyric as satisfactory as such a simple yet revealing statement. These are the words of a legend who's done everything under the sun just going out and having fun with her freshly crafted music, dancing all the while, and that as an aesthetic can be reassuring on its own. Dancing might not be particularly innovative or even much of a country song, but even if it's nothing compared to what Kylie can make herself capable of, it sure is fun.

**auxjuan** (8): A great lead single, and a perfect introduction to the sound of this record.

**Banananaise** (8): i'm sorry i don't know what song us kylie fans are supposed to converge on but i can't give this a higher score than 8

**hikkaru** (8): yee fucking haw

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (8): it's a cute song

**radiofan15** (7.8): This is an interesting combination of country and post-EDM pop... only Queen Kylie could pull up something like this

**selegend** (7): selena kinda ripped this off with back to you

**tevinterimperium** (7): The song could have done without that EDM drop

**waluigiest** (7): it’s folksy and I like that, but I think the electronic elements are clumsy. It is sweet and the verses are beautiful but the bit after the chorus is so bad

**effervescentemu** (6.4): Sounds like an Avicii reject from 2012, soz Kylie.

The title track and our runner up, this gorgeous track was teased almost a year before release as a dancefloor bop on the show Girls. But when it finally showed up in its full form, it was revealed to be a slow, sultry, pulsating vibey dance song. Please read the coments on this one they unpack this song extremely well

---

**auxjuan** (11): This song is Running Up That Hill levels of perfection. It may well be my favourite song of all time. It's so effortlessly sensual.

**awryj** (11): I GOTCHU HUNNY BB

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): let go of your doubt say yes let it soak up into the flesh never had this kind of nutrition. really difficult to describe the span of emotion this song makes me feel; it's just otherworldly and ethereal yet so very carnal and corporeal. a masterclass in musicianship and lyricism

**jamesfog** (11): Classic.

**nooodisaster** (11): The masterpiece of this album, where to begin? There's the production, that creates such a clear image of misty fog you'd think they were engaging more than just your ears. There's the thumping, urgent drums that makes this song so listenable as pop. The chorus, where both the thesis of the song and entire album is given: "No, you're not gonna get what you need/But baby, I have what you want." Robyn's lyrics, that alternate between beautiful imagery like "And the waves come in and they're golden" and heartbreaking questions like "Won't you get me right where the hurt is?" When I listen to this song, I feel sad but I'm captivated. I think a lot of people have made bad decisions where we devalue ourselves just for a chance to be with someone, and Robyn articulates that perfectly here.

**selegend** (11): now this is a masterpiece on a fairly zzz album

**skargardin** (11): Perfection, pure perfection. Sexy, sensual, moody, a major serve is what it is.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): This song really sounds like honey, it’s a slow burn that never explodes, and I thank it for that. The instrumental is divine and the lyrics, my god it’s poetry. This was one of the best tracks of last year. The rest of the album may not live up to the singles, but oh man this song is beautiful.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this song is incredible. You know those scenes in movies where after like an hour the main characters finally find out they have feelings for each other and have a steam makeout/sex session and the visuals are the 2 of them dancing in between what appears to be gigantic sheets that somehow have fans blowing into them? That's what this song makes me visualize. A weird feeling of floating but no actual contact.

**lilguavachan** (10): queen of bees

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this song is filthy

**static\_int\_husp** (10): A very good dance track. There is something very eerie and haunting about this song. The pulsing beat, with some of the synth effects combined the lyrics give this effect. Yet it's also weirdly comforting. "Your not gonna get what you need / but I have what you want" adds some tension, but also weirdly feels like everything is going to be alright. A lot of emotions come together very effectively in this track, and that's why it outpeaks the other 10s on this album to get my 11.

**SupremeShani** (10): She has what I want, she is giving me what I need. I love the way her airy vocals mix with that thumping beat in the background that just captures that crying in the club vibe she is a master at creating.

**twat\_brained** (10): i mean… i know mariah is in this rate but she's absolutely shook.

**waluigiest** (10): it’s so wet!!

**yourhostandpatron** (10): You know what? As a substance, honey is actually kind of gross. Sure, it tastes sweet, but the compound's stickiness is by no means pleasant to experience, and to the tongue biased towards artificial sweeteners, honey can be just as welcome as a sea of cool, sugary lava running down your throat. As a song, Honey uses similar imagery that's supposed to sound disgusting on paper, even  making Robyn sing the words 'saliva' and 'soak up into the flesh' and having us magically enjoy this. And here's what's so amazing about Honey; the word 'honey' makes us think of a golden paradise more than what a spoonful of it actually tastes like nowadays, and that's just what Honey as a song does. It hides the pain of being lonely and the struggle to cope by channeling an unearthly, ethereal musical flow, and the end result is the creation of a grater totality of beauty than actual honey could ever hope to achieve. I might be rooting for Mariah, but I will grudgingly admit that Honey might be the best candidate for our crown that's realistically likely enough to snatch it.

**radiofan15** (9.5): Mariah outsold her big time... it's cute she tried but you can't defeat the Queen dahling

**MrSwearword** (9): it's so close to full marks but if this were 2012-2015 I'd absolutely live.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (9): Every song with the title "honey" hasn't disappointed me yet

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): These Robyn songs are pretty and so I can’t give them a bad score but god, there’s like, nothing to say about them.

Congrats to our winner! I'll be honest, when I proposed this rate I really didn't see this happening. This didnt really make a huge splash on release, thought it was well liked, and didnt do anything on the chart. I think once that rumor of the epic Missy/ Lil Kim/ Cardi B remix came around, people started to pay attention this this and somehow sentiment rallied around it as the Lamb's pick for #1. And i cant disagree! Mariah is at her best here, giving us a breezy fun bop that has all the elemnts of her best while being pretty funny to boot with some of the shadiest lines of her career. Congrats to her for finally winning a rate!

---

**MrSwearword** (11): legit one of Mariah's best songs ever and one of the best songs in the herstory of recorded music. The video version with whistles adds another thing to love about this.

**SupremeShani** (11): This really is the standout song on the album. Shea Taylor and Jermaine Dupri did a fantastic job in creating such a fresh and bouncy feel that lasts throughout the whole song. You all thought Mariah peaked when she said them chickens is ash and she was lotion? Think again, she told them snakes off with their heads and slither out the door. Let's not even mention the flawlessly used Biggie sample in the bridge that transitions into some classic Mariah belts as she literally educates children by teaching them the power of rejection in multiple languages.

**twat\_brained** (11): I mean, most of my 11s either end up 1st or 2nd but in any case, last time I gave Mariah my 11 she won, so let's hope that she does it again. I thought Honey might take my 11 but there is a no no way it can't be this; it's too bopalicious. yes i'm claiming that word shut up

**yourhostandpatron** (11): What I like about Caution is that it brings back Mimi's propensity for combining her excellent ear for refreshing melodies with a sort of hip hop wit in her lyricism that ultimately stems from her mixed heritage, all of which tends to be in her best moments topped by some incredible production. There are many times when Mariah reaches these zeniths on this record again, but A No No is arguably the best display of the sheer, effortless talent that I'm talking about. A snappy, sassy rejection of a target that may either be a creepy man or a certain annoying secretary, the song, while not the hit we hoped it to be for, is a perfect example of why Caution and Mariah's music as a whole can still hold up in 2018. The only thing I dislike about it is that I used to think she sings 'I won't be like Kendrick/you won't deal  with an I' in the second verse, but she actually wrote in a lame Gilligan Island reference instead. Oh, well. I love Mimi too much to hold grudges against her.

**1998tweety** (10): This is such an earworm and has an extremely catchy and fun chorus. The bridge with like 3 different vocals bit going on at once is probably my favourite bit though.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): A Yes Yes

**jamesfog** (10): BOP!

**lilguavachan** (10): popheads let me give 11s to multiple songs challenge, do that challenge

**radiofan15** (10): DAMNIT MARIAH TEAM! This could have been bigger with a better promotion and the promised Lil Kim/Cardio/Missy Elliot remix... anyway, it still slaps without the three of them

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (10): this song is SO fun!! Whistle version is the best. MV is fun too!!

**waluigiest** (10): YES a chaotic bop and we love it

**Leixander** (9.5): nie

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I spoiled this track for myself because I listened to the Shawni remix too many times so now the original version feels a little bit off for me, but it’s still a full on banger.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): You: “no matter what happened” Mariah, a scholar: “irregardless of what transpired”

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "He's a slut he's a ho he's a freak" omg Mariah wrote a song about me <3

**Brendon-Urine** (6): The production and hook are pretty good on this one but that's about it

**selegend** (6): i swear shes done this song like 5 times already, but obsessed & thirsty >>>>>>>. also irregardless is one of my most hated words kdlsfjksdl

yatcho: # Honey

---

**Overall Average**: 7.885 **// Average Controversy:** 1.920

---

**yourhostandpatron** (8.944): Honey is an album that I didn't quite get during 2018, but it's an album I'm also warming up quite a lot to. Taking disco's systematic beats and electropop's masterful use of synths, Robyn forgoes exciting people like she did with Dancing On My Own on Honey, and uses what she has for the purpose of breaking down our conceptions of what it means to make pop perfection in this modern day and age and creating a work that's all a just bit operatic. I used to have no love for these aspects of Honey, because I thought they played in with how slow the record was, but as time went by, I've learned to appreciate everything Robyn says or does throughout its forty minutes runtime. The girl sure doesn't lack punch. There are many things I could say about Honey, but for now, I'm content with just thinking that it's a magnificent work of art.

**waluigiest** (8.667): Her sound palette with this album is beautiful

**1998tweety** (8.256): A weird album with some very strong highlights but also some missed. Overall I'd say its good though.

**radiofan15** (8.022): Production here is the star of the show, everything about this album revolves around the dreamy, overwhelming and powerful atmosphere created and Robyn and co.... when it works it creates magic, but when it doesn't (and that happens a lot for such a short album made on 8 years) oh boy it gets nasty... fortunately even those lows are really well made and somewhat well intentioned [Score: B+]

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.778): This was the only album in the rate that I hadn’t listened to before, I had tried to before but got bored partway through and turned it off. Giving it a more thorough few listens for this rate I’d say I liked it a lot more than I thought I would, but I’m still kind of eh on it. This album reminds me a lot of *Confessions On A Dance Floor* by Madonna in that it’s very polished and I can tell that it’s good but it kind of bores me outside of one or two songs. (Though I like this a lot more than *Confessions*.) Pleasant to listen to, but not very memorable. Clean to the point of being uninteresting. Like, just looking at the scores I gave this album you’d think that I liked it, but that’s just because I couldn’t find anything wrong with most of the tracks so I didn’t feel good giving them lower scores. Something about Robyn here keeps me from really connecting with her, at times she feels like an instrument on her own tracks. They’re a little too glossy, but maybe that’s the point. There were some quirky, unconventional choices on this album that I really connected with but the pure “chill dance” tracks are just like, there. Like I couldn’t find anything to say about half of them.

**MrSwearword** (7.333): it's all over the place but it wouldn't be Robyn if it didn't play weird as shit

**J\_Toe** (7.111): TBH I've never really got the Robyn hype and secretly prefer the Calum Scott version (not that I even listen to it though). Hopefully this rate will change that? Update: It's well made but I'm not interested in ever listening to it again.

**therokinrolla** (6.889): 6/10 Robyn leaps into being a more artsy hag in this album, and it's for the worse. Body Talk was weird in its own right, but at its core it was accentuated by grand hooks and exceptional melodies. Honey doesn't have that. Honey is more experimental, which is to be appreciated, if she gave us something engagingly weird. The songs breeze by without much of an impact. The two singles and Baby Forgive Me are imo the best tracks here, they give a clear vision and are distinct in their styles. The rest feel half written, half sung, and like half a song.

**nooodisaster** (6.722): 6/10. this does grow on you a bit. still, what a disappointment. :( Body Talk is probably in my top 5 albums of all time, it's THAT good. However, this feels more like a mixtape with only 3 or 4 songs really standing out as great. And with 9 years wait, that's just a huge fucking bummer. Even the best here isn't as good as Body Talk's filler. But judging it just amongst the other albums here... Yeah, still not as good.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.556): My main issue with this album is the songwriting. The production throughout is STELLAR but I think more could be done with it. Out of the four albums in this rate, this is by FAR the most interesting and innovative IMO.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.056): I completely understand the appeal of this album but I just cannot get into it. It's H&M-core distilled to its least interesting form. I can appreciate how lush the production is but at most points this just really bores me. [Grade: C+]

**selegend** (5.444): this is a whole album of elevator music

**hikkaru** (3.444): This album just isn't for me. I feel like elevator music is more interesting. I'd be bored hearing this in a shopping mall. The songs just all go on for too long without having any sort of build or release, and it puts me to sleep.

yatcho: # Caution

---

**Overall Average**: 7.965 **// Average Controversy:** 1.682

---

**radiofan15** (9.520): IT IS EXPLOSIVE INDEED... not my favorite Mariah album but this is truly one of her best ever [SCORE: A+]

**1998tweety** (9.170): A very solid album, no particular tracks stands out as awful.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.900): What does the phrase 'return to form' mean for you? What do you feel when you see it in music reviews? If an artist's new release gets called such a phrase after a series of particularly disappointing bumps in the road, do you feel relief? Or do you worry about the lack of exploration and experimentation that the description may entail? There's a delicate balance worth talking about in our answers to those questions. The fog of confusion you may experience from trying to navigate how you respond to these kinds of comments,  however, is lifted completely by records that are as good as Caution. Yes, this really is Mariah's return to form. This really is her artistic comeback, if not her commercial one. Yes, this really is Mariah's best since Scary Monsters. No, wait, I meant that this is her best since Butterfly. Eh. Gay icons are gay icons. I mix legends up sometimes! If you didn't think Mariah still had it in here, Caution is set to correct that. Not since the mid 90s has she combined the concepts of RnB and pop, old and new, accessible yet thoughtful, and sleek yet infectious in her music as acutely as she can so expertly be. As much as Caution owes to the lady's prior innovations, it also owes just as much towards Mimi's capability of staying in touch with her favourite genres and their place in whatever the current state of popular music tends to be. Whether you're in the mood for some 90s nostalgia or you're a fan of modern acts who's trying to get in the old stuff that's been thrown in your face by salty aging folks hidden in a cloud of anonymity for far too long, Caution will, nine times out of ten, succeed in getting your attention. And to the people who missed the mark: I think your opinion is valuable, I really do, but I'm just so sad you can't understand that Giving Me Life is actual proof that God is a being that exists and cares for all of us. Maybe you'll see the light someday. Someday. I'm sorry, this is patronizing (ha, ha, ha!) and I'm being so delusional in this comment that I'm about to choke, but all I want to say is that Mariah did THAT, and I for one, am going to proudly proclaim Caution the best album in this rate. I'm not being serious, by the way. I can see why you'd prefer Honey or even Liberation. I just want to be a drama queen. I'm really sorry. This is why people hate lambs. I'm going to cry. Stream Giving Me Life before I go. Honey won, didn't it?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.650): I’m glad Mariah got a lot of praise for this album because even though it’s not my favorite, she did that. It’s a lot more based around electronic elements than any of her albums before were and it gives the album as a whole this cool, chilly feel. It’s the perfect wintertime treat.

**twat\_brained** (8.620): i have a copy of Emancipation but I'm pretty sure this is the first full Mariah album I've listened to. Short, sweet and to-the-point, which is what I look for in my music. Any Lambs out there have any recommendations for which MC album to follow this gem up with?

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (8.600): A gift from the heavens. i love this album

**therokinrolla** (8.460): 8.5/10 Mariah has been overdue for a short and cohesive 10-11 song album. Her last releases were filled to the brim with tracks that didn't necessarily need to be there, even if they are overall solid albums. What she does expertly here is merge her classic style with very current, but by no means trend chasing, sounds. This album is so confident in itself, and so consistently enjoyable too. Mariah is past her prime and likely will not churn out another smash, but this album doesn't care, it's delivered as an album. The beats are slick, and while Mariah can't do those crazy vocal runs anymore, her voice is still luscious and graceful. And her songwriting is still as good as ever.

**nooodisaster** (7.740): 8/10. probably my second favorite album here, another consistently great one until about the last 2 or 3 songs. The album is a little less focused imo, but incredibly listenable and quality ALL around. Oh, besides With You, fuck that.

**Banananaise** (7.650): i'm here for the Careynaissance!

**selegend** (7.000): even i’m getting tired of whispering but mariah’s wildly talented so she gets a pass kinda, she invented it anyways. but yea this is basically an asmr album

**TragicKingdom1** (6.850): This is pretty standard Mariah fare. It reminds me a bit of Kelly Clarkson's Meaning of Life in the sense that it didn't do much to push her forward artistically, but is simply a very competent execution of the modern Mariah sound. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of that sound, so this doesn't impress me too much. I am struggling to find anything else to say about it. [Grade: B]

**MrSwearword** (6.800): More like a warning of "hit and miss ahead"

**CreepyMannequin** (6.600): Not a bad album but any means but the back half is a bit of a slog in my opinion. It’s no Emancipation or Butterfly.

**Brendon-Urine** (5.100): Yeah I didn't like this album. I've never been a Mariah fan and this isn't helping. Everything just sounds the same, there's very few "peaks" (besides Portrait).

yatcho: # Golden

---

**Overall Average**: 7.243 **// Average Controversy:** 1.744

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.425): Whatever you say about the actual quality of *Golden* as an album (I personally love it but I’ve seen mixed reviews from fans) you really have to respect what Kylie was going for. To make a sound change this drastic at this stage of her career and pull it off with such quality and dignity, that’s why she’s a legend. It coasts a little bit on novelty and I don’t know how well this album will age, nor do I think it will supersede her older works, but I do think it’s a very worthy entry into her canon.

**1998tweety** (8.300): Pretty solid album, Kylie does a nice job of adding country accents to her style.

**Banananaise** (7.875): people accuse Kylie of hopping on Joanne's train but Golden gets far more honky-tonky-tinky-tanky-yee-haw-hee-haw-square-dance-in-an-old-barn-capital-C-Country than joanne ever came close to, and it's more fun and memorable and just better in general than joanne too!

**nooodisaster** (7.625): 8/10. I would NEVER have suspected that of all the albums, I'd think Kylie's was the most consistent. The quality here is pretty incredible until Love where for me to falls off. My biggest welcome surprise of the rate, thanks for introducing me to this album!

**therokinrolla** (7.300): 7/10 Rather than sacrificing pop sensibilities for an artifice of country flavor and faux intimacy, Kylie brings over what makes her pop so delish and scrumptious. Even the ballads solidly deliver, although there are a few duds. Plus, the general lack of diversity in the tracks make the album a somewhat repetitive listen. Nonetheless, it is a solid outing and a good addition to Kylies legendary discography.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.167): I think the production on here is really slick and I love the combination of country-pop and Kygo-esque trop pop, but the album as a whole feels quite repetitive. The songs are all virtually indistinguishable from each other. I don't really have any other complaints though. For that alone, it's my favorite album in the rate. [Grade: B+]

**waluigiest** (6.833): If you’re tryna country fusion I just want you to commit to the yeehaw a little bit more.

**yourhostandpatron** (6.750): Honestly, i think Golden may be a response God gave to gays who thought Joanne was a boring and mediocre album. There's a funny and slightly incredulous trend of inserting country elements into pop music that can work surprisingly well, and there's trying to go along those lines but failing to exhibit the entire point of such an idea so disappointingly that your new release feels like no more than a funny footnote in your career. Golden is not a bad album, but for an innovator like Kylie Minouge who could have done so much more with the cowboy aesthetic she tried to pull off this era, it sure is a sad sight. There are good tracks here, but I find them hard to treat as anything more than echoes of what could have been. Even Golden's highlights, such as Dancing and Raining Glitter, are merely incomplete forms of something greater that never came into existence. I fear that I've been a bit too mean to the record, but it's just too painfully standard for my preferences. If Kylie's found a way in the past to combine creativity and effort whilst simply having fun, I don't see why she couldn't have done so on Golden.

**radiofan15** (6.725): Oh God this album loses steam really quickly before a sudden rise in quality at the end, but before that you have to got through lots of faux-country disco-esque tracks that kinda blends together. As much as this wasn't anywhere close my favorite country or country pop album, I don't really hate it [Score: C+]

**letsallpoo** (6.483): great banjos, beautiful banjos

**CreepyMannequin** (6.167): Just a boring album. Only a few standout tracks from an artist who I expect classic singles and amazing album cuts from. Really disappointing.

**MrSwearword** (5.250): about as "golden" as pyrite.

**selegend** (4.750): yeah this is by and far her worst album lol
