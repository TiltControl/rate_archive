Our first day 2 exit on the bonus rate, this is a really fun if ultimately forgettable song. Kylie continues Joanne-ing and picks up the pace from the album proper quite a bit, but that isnt really enough to distinguish it from a lot of the other similar songs from Golden

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): rip my wig off look to the sky

**jamesfog** (9.5): Bop!

**Banananaise** (9): how was this not on the album???

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I love that Kylie's idea of country pop is basically putting a guitar in the background of her verses and then having an unabashedly pop explosion of a chorus.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Yes ma’am.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Calvin Harris has left the chat

Starting the day out with the second cut from Caution! Mariah employs the help of Gunna, one of the hottst new rappers right now who most of you would probably just call mumblerap trash (which... tea), for a pretty short innofensive feature. This is a cute little jam which does ultimately feel repetitive by the end but still, this is one of my favorite from the album and injects a lot of life into the back half of Caution.

---

**kanyewestrep\_** (10): that guy at the start that sounds like Pharrell was one of the best moments of 2018, this probably would have been my 11 if she got Lil Baby on this instead of Gunna

**lilguavachan** (10): oh thank god, i needed a bop after being taken down a dark path in 8th grade.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I really thought the Gunna track was gonna be serious filler but my god she really had to hide such a serious fucking bop at the end of the record, and Gunna honestly adds to this track, she needs to be stopped

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm not sure if it's Gunna's inexperience or perhaps SoundCloud rap is too clashy with Mariah's musical stylings. If there was a better rapper here this'd at least be a 9 from me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I love the instrumental for this song, I adore that “digital raindrop” effect. This song has a great build and climax but I worry that it takes too long to get to the payoff.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): I don’t care much for the feature but I really like the production

**SupremeShani** (8.5): This is fun, it feels like a modern take on songs like Get Your Number and the like, without being too obnoxious.

**1998tweety** (8.3): Gunna is kind of meh but I like Mariah's bits as well as the beat.

**radiofan15** (8.2): Gunna is one of the untalented asses this side of the rap industry, a carbon copy of Young Thug without any semblance of originality and without any kind of artistry... his album with Lil Baby is bland cliche trap filler after bland cliche trap filler; how and why is he famous and on-demand would never cease to amaze me, he can fucking choke alongside most of the rappers cut from the same clothes UGH DIE YOU FUCKTARTD... having said that this is a nice song

**selegend** (8): yAAAAS

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I used to see Stay Long Love You as the only song from Caution that I didn't love, or even like. There's the fact that Gunna is in it, for one. The strange thing about him being here is that he isn't among the very depths of the rappers Marah's chosen to collaborate with that would either get a 'who' or a 'lol' nearly all the time their name is brought up, but I still didn't know who the hell he was when I saw him here, and I'm still not a big fan of his voice. What ultimately saves Stay Long Love You, though, is its production. While the song is much simpler than many of its fellow tracks off Caution, what prevents it from being plausibly described as low-effort is its production, full of a series of RnB clicks and synths that make Mariah sound like she's hit the sweet mark more than she realistically should. This is not the best trophy you take home from Caution, but Stay Long Love You is, fundamentally, still a more than decent example of Mariah's talent.

This Kylie cut is probably the last of the proper filler to be eliminated from Golden. A really cute track, it lacks identity of its own and it treads a lot of the same ground as earlier tracks like Golden and Lifetime To Repair

---

**lilguavachan** (9.5): a cute little summery pop

**nooodisaster** (9): HOW IS SHE SO GOOD AT PRECHORUSES?!?!?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): this really dings in the equestrian

**jamesfog** (8.5): Cute sing [4]

**1998tweety** (8): Can you call a song filler if the whole album sounds like it?

**selegend** (8): yea this is the best song on the album yea this sounds like knockoff 2013 avicii like the rest of this album

**SupremeShani** (8): Everything besides the chorus has such a beautifully sentimental vibe to it, which is really complimented by the folksy instrumental, but then that chorus has to come in.

**waluigiest** (8): one of the more effective songs at blending genres

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Something about the way that the dance and country elements are joined together on this particular track doesn’t do it for me but at the same time, like, it’s not a bad song!

**radiofan15** (6.2): Kylie as a punishment for your sins you'll write 100 times ''Adding guitars and twings and violins to songs doesn't make a song country'' on your notebook

**MrSwearword** (5): anodyne wannabe Eurovision realness which on this album is a sign of progress

A second title track down the tubes fairly early, here we have Kylie going super deep into the country tropes and western soundtrakcs with a good ol yodel repeating throughout the track. It's not a bad song but for a title track it's ultimately a bit disappointing, and doesnt stand up to some of the other singles on Golden

---

**jamesfog** (10): BOP!

**lilguavachan** (10): the good, the bad, and the ugly found dead, ugly, and

**NachoLiterary** (10): i would have loved to hear this playing, like, anywhere, ever.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Ageism for women in music is a very unfortunate thing and Kylie fires back against it with grace. Kylie’s 50, which honestly isn’t that old (like, she’s my mom’s age, not my grandma’s) but because of how long she’s been in the public eye she feels older because a lot of people have basically grown up with her. And it’s like… if Kylie’s old, then what does that mean for us? She, in her infinite wisdom, encourages us to discard this kind of thinking entirely and just enjoy life and the beauty of everything, and the song really evokes the beauty she’s describing. The music video, [filmed with no budget and (allegedly) no makeup in the space between shooting the glossier “Stop Me From Falling” video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkVc_67HzBb/) is a bold statement on Kylie’s sheer charisma and lust for life; most artists wouldn’t have even bothered with a video like this but Kylie makes it sparkle like gold.

**1998tweety** (9): This has a weird tropical/vacation-y vibe and it makes me think of those commercials about vacationing in the Bahamas or something. That aside I like it, idk how to describe that weird call-like sound but I like it.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I expect a lot from title tracks, and this did not disappoint. I love the weird pitched yodels throughout the song, and the buildup to the chorus is so well done.

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): silver

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): invented iconic western movie themes

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): sounds sunny

**Banananaise** (7.5): do NOT remind me of this video

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Just a touch generic for me. Still very solid overall tho.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): well maybe not EVERY title track can be great but Robyn seemed to do that so I don't understand why Kylie's couldn't be great too

**awryj** (7): the chorus is really nice but the gooOOoOoOOlden sounds tacky tbh

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Infinity goes on forever... is Kylie a mathemetician???

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): yee, and i cannot stress this enough, haw

**yourhostandpatron** (7): You know what I find interesting? Golden's credits list one Liz Rose as a cowriter for the song, and that same Liz Rose used to be Taylor Swift's partner in songwriting about a decade prior to Golden's release. Rose seems to be focused on helping make country pop come to life, which makes sense, since Golden's title track is the closest the record actually comes to country. Golden isn't as exciting as the previous two songs on this album's tracklist, but it's sweet enough to make a minor impact, and I enjoy it simply for seeing a link between Kylie and Taylor. I have no quarrel with it.

**radiofan15** (6.2): What's up with the pitched-up western yodeling?

**waluigiest** (6): many choices here

**selegend** (4): bland

**MrSwearword** (1): corny as shit even by Kylie standards and has all the makings of a Nashville PEPSI commercial. GET THIS OUT OF HERE

Following Missing U is a hard task and Human Being really suffers on the tracklist as a  result. A little empty and muted, here Robyn is channeling pure sadness in her lyrics on top of some really warm production. Unfortunately it didnt stand out to many of you

---

**auxjuan** (10): Quite possibly her saddest song.

**lilguavachan** (10): i know people don't seem to like this song, but i love how soulless and empty this song sounds.

**SupremeShani** (10): Just the way she sings how she's a human being has me in tears. The sparse melancholic production really helps sets in that sinking feeling of loneliness.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): took some time to grow on me but it's such a great lowkey song

**jamesfog** (9): I'm a human bean

**1998tweety** (8): Hopefully she doesn't have anything weirder than this.

**nooodisaster** (8): Danceable and well produced, if not the most memorable thing ever.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): /r/totallynotrobots

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I'm sometimes guilty of liking songs for conceptual reasons at times rather than judging them based on their music, and I use this same troublesome technique in evaluating Human Being, which I should really feel bothered by, although I do take comfort in the fact that the more I listen to it, the more I think every bit of the song relies on Robyn's performance. Human Being isn't really interesting musically past superficially resembling a human heartbeat, but Robyn expands that and paints a shockingly apocalyptic picture ('a dying race') and makes reference to this record's honey motif by claiming that there's no more of it to be had. It's a surprisingly literary song, and what's best about it is that it works past the pitching board!

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): i love the production

**radiofan15** (7.2): Don't know what a Zhala is but I don't care, this has some fantastic production... also obligatory Drive comment about being just a human bean

**Leixander** (7): kinda a skip because the next song is gorgeous

**waluigiest** (7): even though this is not a very dynamic song, the intrigue behind its sound makes it perfect to just turn on and swallow up and slowly morph into a robot

**Brendon-Urine** (6): This song is a perfect example of cool production but average songwriting. The synths are SO WARM and beautiful.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I mean, it’s fine, but not very exciting.

**MrSwearword** (4): you're a human being that should make better music than this

Kylie did what she had to do and delivered a bop here! She goes into some more emotional relationship territory here, with a really nice build up to an explosive chorus. Again, this treads the same ground sonically as all the other singles but is that really a bad thing when you get bops like this?

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I usually try to give my eleven to my oddball favorite song rather than the best song in the rate, and this time around it’s this one, which was my favorite from the first time I listened to the album. I just love the message and imagery of this song, it’s a song about wanting something good and just pleading to the universe to let it finally work out because if you get let down one more time it’ll just be too much. There’s just something so cathartic about the refrain she sings after the word “repair” in the chorus, I’ve definitely blasted this song on the radio and just screamed along with that. More than any other song in the rate this one is just a foot stomper, it just makes me want to go ape and jump around my room crying. The way that the simple verses slide into that chorus with those backing vocals is sheer genius and the final chorus in particular is fantastic, it really carries out of the bridge well. Miss me with that weak radio edit though.

**awryj** (10): 5 4 3 2 manyYYY TIIIIIMES countdown WHO beyonce found dead in a ditch

**lilguavachan** (10): listening to this song on youtube, i got back to back commercials for dedicated by carly rae jepsen... so the whiplash i got going from now that i found you to kyleehaw whipping out a fiddle was... a lot. cute song though

**nooodisaster** (10): suddenly im joanne, yehaw. I'm a sucker for choir choruses, but that's just one small part of why I totally fell in love with this song. Basically every part is a hook, the contrast of upbeat production with somber lyrics is a gay staple, and "6-5-4-3-too many times" is fucking genius. Again, Kylie's lyrics actually feel like someone who's 50 (coughmadonnacough), while still being fun and light. I can imagine my Mom writing songs like this if she tried her hand at songwriting. I fear this will be slept on, and I just wanna say y'all are young and idiots.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): build up from verse to prechorus to chorus is great

**SupremeShani** (9.5): The only thing keeping this from a ten for me is the disappointing postchorus beat drop. Everything else, from the campiness of the country styled verses, the countdown to the chorus, and that absolutely explosion of a chorus are perfect though.

**Leixander** (9): rep-hay hay hay-hair

**NachoLiterary** (9): all the singles on this album are truly so good

**skargardin** (9): Let's be real. The four first tracks are basically the same track with some slight variations. But they're all bops so I'm not mad about it. She did what she had to do

**waluigiest** (9): this country-dance fusion works so well!! The drop is cheesy but it’s still great

**jamesfog** (8.5): Cute sing

**1998tweety** (8.3): This is one of the songs where you can feel the country vibe the strongest, I think there's even a fiddle in there.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): serving old school Dolly Parton vibes on the verses

**yourhostandpatron** (8): This song is the closet Golden ever gets to blending in with some genuinely moody country at least lyrically, although sonically it may leave yet to be desired. It's essentially an edgier and more depressing clone of Stop Me From Falling, though at the very least, A Lifetime To Repair is by no means bad. (And speaking of which, neither is Stop Me From Falling.) In conclusion, as a track, it may be entirely fine, though I will say that at this point Golden sounds so homogeneous that it becomes easy to worry for what the rest of the record is going to bring.

**Banananaise** (7.5): the chorus is banging enough for me to get into the tinky tonky verses

Ah middle school. Mariah takes us back to that unattainable crush we all had back in the day with this relatable record. Unfortunately it's kind of just fluff on this very tight album so here it is out rather early from *Caution*

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): you ARE my world queen

**lilguavachan** (9): this took me down memory lane, with me remembering my biggest crush in middle/high school. me, the fat gay bitch who couldn't come to terms with their sexuality and identity at the time, crushing on a straight mormon boy... the life and times of a homosexual growing up in the mid 00s in the rural south... a nightmare... literally a nightmare... i'm docking points (1 point because i'm too dedicated of a #lamb to dock more) just because of that, mariah! 😤😤😤 love you though, queen ❤

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (9): "maybe the lyrics are too heavy, in my song" are enough to make this song great

**yourhostandpatron** (9): 8th Grade is a great relief, a role which I'm more or less assigning it because of how it's in between my two least favourite tracks on Caution (fair warning, though: if you give those tracks I just mentioned less than a 7, you will burn!) It's extra proof to the pile of evidence that Mariah is one of pop's most magnificent songwriters in both musical and lyrical skill, but it's also unique in the sense that it's a glimpse into Mariah's adolescence. As a survivor of what could be called a tragic childhood, Mimi's explored all the doubt she's experienced growing up prior to becoming famous and wealthy ever since she's began making music, but her teen years have always been a gap in how fans have perceived her backstory from her art alone. 8th Grade adds a missing episode to the canon by putting into detail just how complex her feelings of attachment as well as insecurity may have developed as a result of such an upbringing, perhaps shedding light into why she may have gone into a toxic relationship with her executive manager in the early 90s. I don't mean to psychoanalyze Mimi from this song alone, but art as simple yet as revealing as 8th Grade does intend to make its audience wonder. Either way, it's a genius stroke of pop perfection from Mariah. If you've had a straight crush, you can definitely relate!

**radiofan15** (8.8): How is it possible that she had a crush on 8th grade if she's eternally 12?

**1998tweety** (8.4): 8th Grade....I year before I peaked at life.

**Leixander** (8): hehe

**SupremeShani** (8): I love that Mariah can make unrequited crush from eighth grade sound so melancholic.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This really sounds like a video game soundtrack in the best way

**waluigiest** (8): I’M YOUR SECURITY

**MrSwearword** (7): the lyrics are certainly not too heavy, but this just above par fluff

**twat\_brained** (7): not feeling it much but good vibes I guess. surprisingly lower than Giving Me Life for me. In any case, I can see this being good bgm for sparking a joint or cuddling with your s/o; feels very Kehlanicore

**pastastic** (6.5): It's the weakest track on the album but the synth makes me hopeful that Mariah will be the next pop star guest/victim of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is probably the weakest track on the album. It’s kind of meandering and the actual story that it’s telling is a bit confusing. Plus that outro is *way* too long.

**nooodisaster** (6): Her crush was smoking in 8th grade?? bad boy.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): Production is kinda interesting... I guess? But Mariah is just so boring and the songwriting is dull

Xtina finally loses something today. This blatant wedding song ballad grab is classic Christina via Ed Sheeran, and I wasn't really feeling it. As far as I know Christina isnt even married right now, just divorced. She does sound fantastic though

---

**1998tweety** (11): A gorgeous masterpiece of a song that I definitely want to be played at my wedding (if I have one lol). I don't know why this song frequently moves me to tears since I've never even been in a relationship, but the lyrics and the emotion in Xtina's voice sell it so well. The bridge and last chorus are absolutely magical, as Xtina does like 5 different notes that sound like they should be the last one but nonetheless she continues. It really takes you there and then brings you back down.

**lilguavachan** (10): i do love a good christina ballad

**MrSwearword** (10): an unusually blunt song that turns the love song shit on its head

**jamesfog** (9.5): Beautiful

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This is giving me Bound to You vibes, and I like that. It's sweet and romantic, a departure from the rest of the manic energy present in the album, but still feels fitting as a closer.

**nooodisaster** (9): This is suuuuper sweet. The direct lyrics work here like she's speaking directly to her man. Great end to the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): …Okay, she made some points with this one.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Unless Is With You is another example of how Christina can contribute some genuinely amazing ballads, and it's no surprise that she used the song as an open chance for fans to propose to each other during the Liberation Tour. I have no knowledge of whether Christina is a married woman or not, and I'm too lazy to do research about whether this song's lyrics have any semblance of personal biography to them (with that being said, I hope they do) but Christina has managed to strike a very fulfilling brand of intimacy and emotional satisfactions with this track. In a way, Unless Is With You is a fantastic ending to an album full of self-doubt, and I happen to be saying this as an aromantic person who is probably never getting married!

**radiofan15** (7.5): Kind of a weak closer for such a strong album

**twat\_brained** (7.4): and that caps off a relatively middling album. i'd say I prefer Back to Basics and self-titled in terms of quality, but if Christina's making the music she's happy with then I can't fault her for that.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): hmmm kinda bland

**Leixander** (6): bland ballad but she sounds good as always

**waluigiest** (6): this is so plain

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This track does nothing for me, and the bland production isn’t helping, sorry

The Kanye production is back on *Maria*, what shouldve really been the title of this album. Christina is pulling a pseudo-Joanna here, with a song about... finding herself through her middle name? Not really sure, as most of this song is just ad-libs and a Michael Jackson sample. Production absolutely slaps though, from the dramatic intro to violins-over-trap beat, and the aforementioned sample. And its without saying but she sounds great as well

---

**jamesfog** (10): A bop

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm actually pleased by this sort of Christina on Empire sounding ass song

**radiofan15** (10): Kanye definitely snapped here with the Jackson 5 sample and the lush arrangement.... and Xtina did a great job too

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): the samples tho how genius

**nooodisaster** (9): I'm not mad! The lyrics are basically nonsense and just an excuse for Christina to adlib for 4 minutes, but they're fun adlibs and the sample is h o t with immaculate production. This is what you get when Kanye produces (even if as a person he can drink my period blood).

**1998tweety** (8.5): The kid voice in the background can get a bit annoying at times, but overall I'd say this is a good track.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (8.5): Not a fan of the background vocals but the rest of the song is good

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I have to say this is not what I was expecting from this album, the combination of the violins, the trap beat, and her raw vocals all come together to produce such a unique track, and I don't even know who Maria is.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): …is this supposed to be her Joanne? I'm not denying its power but I feel like Gaga had a better sentiment with this sort of thing

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I adore the instrumental and screeching vocals in the background.

**waluigiest** (8): the beat/orchestration are clumsy, but the vocals and production are real nice

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I don't know why Kanye just decided to bring back his chipmunk sampling for Christina (maybe that's a deliberate throwback, seeing as Christina was most relevant when he used to do that?) but I'm not really sure it works as well in Maria as it did in the past. I'm already weary of hearing Michael Jackson for some pretty damn obvious reasons, and I don't need to hear him as a kid tainting what's supposed to be a moment of passionate introspection for Christina. Even past the controversy this'd entail today, that voice is just distracting compared to Christina's vocals performance. This is a damning and powerful song if you take into account all the work she does alone, and I have to question whether the techniques Kanye uses here are as effective in modern pop music as they were in last decade's hip hop scene. I don't mean to say Maria is bad, because I still enjoy it, but, God, would it be so much better without the sample!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Noise. Just so much noise.

Christina pegs MNEK for some abolutely sublime production work here, and of course she sounds great, but where this song falls is in the cliche lyrics. We've all heard a "I fuck shit up for myself" song before and she doesnt do much to differ from those and make it for herself. It really doesnt hold up to repeated listens either. MNEK *deserved* better (stream Tongue y'al)

---

**yoereyesr** (11): Oooooh oooooh

**jamesfog** (10): MNEK snapped

**MrSwearword** (10): slay emotive delivery

**radiofan15** (10): Holy shit this album deserved better... maybe this was the one ahead of its time?

**rosesmp3** (10): this chorus is always getting stuck in my head

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I remember after listening to the album for the first time this was the track that really stuck with me and the only deep cut that I really felt the need to revisit every now and then. Her vocal performance here is fantastic, I really believe the pain in her voice.

**nooodisaster** (9): After listening to this I was like "the melody & production is amazing but are the lyrics cringey to anyone?" And then I saw that MNEK produced and Julia Michaels wrote. It ALL made sense.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I really liked this at first but it anti grew on me. The song is 4 and a half minutes long so since the song starts with the chorus, by the time the second verse rolls around I'm half expecting a bridge to come in.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Deserve is the most divisive song from LIberation, at least from my observations, and I can see why. When you take into account the track's robotic chorus, which reminds one just a little bit of PC Music, and when you consider the implications behind what Christina is singing about when she describes hurting her lover out of spite, Deserve can sound a little too cold, unusual, and uncomfortable. Perhaps this was the intention behind it as a song. These elements, however, whilst alienating me just a little bit, also fascinate me quite considerably. Liberation is one of Christina's most unique albums sonically, and while this track can approach murky territory for me, I can at least admire the fact that said territory is interesting.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): It's cute, but the song lyrics are just so cliche at this point that it's almost disappointing to hear, and the production isn't enough to save it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Applaud making “fucked up shit” not sound terribly tryhard, but this still falls a bit flat unfortunately.

**lilguavachan** (5): like, i really love the beat (MNEK did that), but these lyrics... whew let me liberate my right to that skip button

**twat\_brained** (4): one thing I know for certain is that your Fighters deserve better than this after 6 non-album years

Two of the most powerful voices in pop come together for a feminist anthem, and the jokes almost write themselves. This Jon Bellion produced track starts quite well and surprisingly restrained, But this is very serious up until about the bridge where the two lose any sense of restraint and Demi belts out that gorgeous G5 and well , its over for our eardrums. Still this really shouldve been the lead single if they wanted radio play and the live performances wouldve been iconic.

---

**hikkaru** (10): I know people dislike this because it sounds like a yelling match but that's why I like it tbh, they try so hard to restrain themselves in the first part of the song but as it goes on they can't stand it anymore and just SCREAM it's so good

**jamesfog** (10): A Grammy-nominated modern classic

**JunkyGS** (10): That last note at the end by Demi.... WOOO GURL

**Leixander** (10): IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS glass shatters BABY IT'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE oil station explodes roll credits, Michael Bay

**MrSwearword** (10): even with Demi here, this is actually fantastic

**radiofan15** (10): We stan a Grammy nominated collaboration between two of the noisiest screamers of the music industry

**rosesmp3** (10): invented feminism

**yoereyesr** (10): I didn't like it at first but that Demi high note, wow.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Two vocal legends of screaming. This sounds exactly like what I'd expect an Xtina and Demi collab to sound like and it did not disappoint.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is one of those songs that can only exist as a girl power anthem because if a man were to sing this it would be absolutely terrifying. Christina and Demi are a pretty obvious combination given how often they’re compared and I’d say that they delivered with this one. It’s built around sheer power but what actually makes it work (I think) is the restraint that they display on verses, it’s them untethering themselves from this restraint on the climaxes that make the belting so thrilling.

**MNREDR** (9): Whose idea was it to have Darth Vader in the background?? The only flaw to this gripping duet from our shouting legends.

**waluigiest** (9): an unexpected and strong pairing

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I can make all the jokes about their overdone belting and screams, but this is a match made in heaven. I will say while I love the message, the lyrics could have been so much stronger for a feminist anthem like this.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I've seen some reactions dismissing Fall in Line's central message because its two lead artists are both rich, powerful women who are unlikely to suffer an unbearable amount of oppression under our modern-day patriarchy. It is true that Christina and Demi are still quite privileged in one way or the other, and the fact that two artists previously from Disney known for their excessive belting made a song together is still really funny, but I'd prefer it if people didn't discount what the two are trying to do here. Message to cis gays: you don't know what it's like to be a woman! Even women in the highest positions of luck and influence can suffer from misogynistic assumptions. Fall In Line is brazen and powerful, and it features the sort of resolute anger that's calm yet determined in such a way that you'll be wanting to call yourself a feminist from then on. It's intended single material, but it's great. Not one of the best on Liberation by a long shot, but I hope its average isn't too low.

**Banananaise** (7): Accelerate was better!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): key change is nice but it's a bit too screamy

**nooodisaster** (6): The chorus kinda slaps! Unfortunately, it's so overproduced and devolves into a screaming match.

**twat\_brained** (5.7): that is a weird ass fucking intro; "Dreamers" should've led directly into this. i also can't stop thinking about that thread awhile back about toothless songs and how two wealthy, privileged white women tackling this subject matter felt hollow. Christina should've left it at "Fighter" and "Beautiful" if you ask me.

**lilguavachan** (5): i haven't even started listening to the song again and i have a headache at them yelling at me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I’m not gonna give this the 2 I gave it in the jukebox, but this really just isn’t for me. I’m personally not a fan of the vocal runs, and it certainly feels like both artists are oversinging - there’s no substance behind it and it’s the pop version of Eminem’s Kamikaze, like great you both have incredible voices but it’s not interesting. And beyond all that, the production on this is just bad. It’s very grating and not in a good way. This song is boring and forgettable, sorry.

**The\_skinniest\_legend** (2): Strain queen of the present meets the even bigger strain queen. its a no no from me.

Honestly what is this doing so low in the standings... absolutely no taste! Send Popheads to the Institution Immediately! This tracks transitions absolutely flawlessly from Baby Forgive Me (the best i've heard since Freak->Art Deco) and spends some time building up that sad, longing energy that Robyn is an absolute master at cultivating. Then it lets loose with hook after hook under a throbbing dance beat. Should've been a day 3 cut easily but whats a day 2 without some horrible takes

---

**lilguavachan** (11): the transition from baby forgive me to this song.... i'm shaking, she's just so powerful.

**pastastic** (11): This song alone puts on display everything Robyn has learned since Body Talk. You can hear her life experiences since her last album, her influences and lessons from collaborations with Royksopp and La Bagatelle Magique. This song is absolutely perfect.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): error, wig sent into orbit instead

**MrSwearword** (10): way to make three great songs in a row, Robyn.

**radiofan15** (10): Love how the track grown and even if it never truly explodes it still emanates such an energy it kinda overwhelms... Robin send me there indeed

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This is the definition of sad synthpop perfection, there's this almost desperate feel throughout the song that I love.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Baby Forgive Me basically sounds like a demo for this song. This song is much more fleshed out, and is a lot better for it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The transition really sent me

**waluigiest** (9): this title wins and all the layers in the orchestration win too

**yourhostandpatron** (9): If it weren't for the lush beauty of Honey's title track, the contrarian in me may have been big enough to call Send To Robyn Immediately the best track off the album. That sounds like a deliberately provocative statement, but do I really seem like I'm just trying to get people's attention when I describe just how beautiful this song is despite how it's essentially a glorified interlude? I already love it just because of its title, which reads like a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of Robyn's iconic image and artistic identity, but it's the urgent and increasingly desperate backing synths of Send To Robyn Immediately that make it sound like the song has its own pulse. Coupled with a handful of absolutely golden hooks from Robyn that seduce her listeners right back in to Honey's narrative, there's a surprising amount of brilliance within this track that make it fit for being a transmission in between Baby, Forgive Me and the record's theme song. It's the perfect median in the midst of the opera.

**1998tweety** (8): This sounds like a 4-minute interlude that somehow works.

**nooodisaster** (8): The "If you got" hook is H O T. Everything else I can pass on.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A lovely throbbing beat, there are a lot of layers to the songs on this album.

This banger doesnt deserve this either! The second big single from this album, Kylie gives us a super uplifting, wholesome bop. We didnt rate the remix either which has Kylie trying to get into the latin market like every other diva lately which... well the less said about that the better

---

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Country-pop perfection

**awryj** (10): this song is just fun!!

**jamesfog** (10): Bop!

**lilguavachan** (10): kyleehaw really reached deep inside herself and gave the homosexuals a line dancing anthem

**ZankeeZero** (10): fall

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): has a really nice country twang, but with a good pop beat too. The chorus is very good.

**yoereyesr** (9.5): You missed the Gente D Zona Remix wich is better

**1998tweety** (9): I prefer the remix a bit just it sounds a bit better imo (there are some production changes that make the song more interesting, vocals go well together, and it's nice having another language in there too). Nonetheless, this is still a nice bop.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Great pre-chorus, fun and catchy overall, and interesting lyrics about falling for a longtime friend. Pretty great.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Stop Me From Falling is more of the same fare from Dancing, but though the two songs don't deviate much, I have to admit that this second track is incredibly enjoyable. It's still not country enough to live into the hype, but this exhibits a sort of nostalgic glamour in this fun, incredibly youthful way that makes me happily surprised. Kylie showing that she can do songs like this despite how long she's been around is just proof to me that she still knows have to a good time. That may have hindered some other aspects of Golden, but ultimately, this is a triumph.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): chorus is cute but the rest is just above average

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.6): Honestly not my favorite, I think “A Lifetime To Repair” does a lot of the good elements of this song better. The remix got a cute video though!

**radiofan15** (7.5): Cute little BOP... unsubstantial but catchy

**pastastic** (7.1): the snare drum sample makes me sad.

**Leixander** (7): nice enough

**tevinterimperium** (7): sounds like Dancing, so I'm giving it the same score

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A little forgettable, but a heckin dose of yeehaw

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I'm not sure what to think of this song, the buildup reminds me of some older EDM songs that you would have found on the charts years ago, and the rest is your standard country infused pop, but I like it.

**MrSwearword** (6): it got in my nerves but I can understand what it's trying to do.

**selegend** (6): cute

**waluigiest** (4): I don’t think this works

The last Kylie song of the day and last bonus of the day, this is another vaguely twangy bop from Miss Minogue. Not a lot to say that hasnt been said in Rollin and Low Blow, im kind of glad we're mostly through the Golden bonus tracks skslkjs

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): interesting bop!

**Banananaise** (9): these deluxe edition tracks are all better than most of the album tracks but i can understand this one didn't fit with the album theme

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Literally how does she do it? Make her bonus tracks so good?

**jamesfog** (9): Bop

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Kylie needs to fire her A&R because some of the bonus tracks are better than the filler on this album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): another bop wtf

**nooodisaster** (7): We stan self confidence in this house.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I see why this was set aside as a bonus track on the album.

Last song of day 2 tragically missing out on top 15, Robyn serves us a really fun, funky synth bop thats low key sad as fuck

---

**Brendon-Urine** (11): Knew this would be my 11 as soon as I saw the rate. Robyn popped O F F, the passion and pain in her voice in the chorus just hits so hard.

**Leixander** (11): rpdr s11e9 spoilers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMRpwqZ__z0

**lilguavachan** (10): to go from the emptiness of human being to this joyous yet sad song... robyn's power is immense

**MrSwearword** (10): full marks/roses for something simple but done well

**SupremeShani** (10): I can't stand the way Robyn plays with my emotions, the opening of this song and the melody give off the vibe that this is a happy song, but the production and meaning of the lyrics bring in her signature bittersweet vibes. She really does a fantastic job of conveying the feeling of getting lost in a song, so many artists try to do this, but there's a real magical feeling to it here.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): the ascending twinkly bits are so gorgeous, and her vocals really set such a #mood

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Very pretty! I love the shimmery sounds on this track, it sounds very heavenly in a way that makes me thing of [this scene from *Inside Daisy Clover*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9xPw8xRXg0&frags=pl%2Cwn).

**jamesfog** (9): Bop

**waluigiest** (9): this is sugary and glossy and just great

**yourhostandpatron** (9): The best thing is about synth-heavy music is that when producers and artists genuinely try to aim for creativity, they can make their synths sound special, as if they're things that go beyond the limitations of being no more than products of a metal machine. Because It's In The Music is a magnificent example of what I'm talking about. Filled with a lush wall of music that's reminiscent of an orchestra (and it is, indeed, here where Honey seems to take on a thematic cohesiveness) every echo of an instrument works with Robyn's voice to create a regretful nostalgia trip of stunning proportions. Whether they take on the role of violins, flutes, or drums, the synths in  this song are responsible for bringing everything else involved in it to life.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): anyone else get carly vibes?

**1998tweety** (7.8): This is less weird than Human Being but not as good oop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Serving Heard A Song by Kero Kero Bonito

**nooodisaster** (6.5): The lyrics are the typical great for Robyn, but I find the melody so dated and boring personally.

**radiofan15** (6.5): Why does this sounds incredibly childish and slightly annoying yet it's so fantastically made I have to stan?... also that fucking ending SLAPS
