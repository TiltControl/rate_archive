For some of you, this is the song from Guardians of the Galaxy. For some, it's that song from Ally McBeal. Some might know it from the Shrek 2 DVD. I think it says at all that this song is mostly used to soundtrack more memorable things.

**radiofan15** (10): Obligatory Guardians of the Galaxy comment... also FUCK YOU STAR-LORD FPR BEING RESPONSOBLE OF TONY AND GAMORA'S DEATHS and also FUCK YOU CHRIS PRATT FOR PUBLICLY SUPPORTING AND DEFENDING AN HOMOPHOBIC AND CULTY CHURCH
 
---
 
**roxieloxie** (11): this song dosent have any reason to slap as hard it dose. I’m mad I discovered it from a trumpet boy meme but damn, I really love it
 
**CarlieScion** (10): b o p
 
**sbb618** (10): OOGA CHAKA OOGA OOGA OOGA CHAKA OOGA OOGA (repeat for ten minutes)
 
**SpanKKy1** (10): huuuuge bop
 
**waluigiest** (9): I don’t care for the intro but when the beat comes in this is truly bliss
 
**nicknac4** (8): Feeel goood jams
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): I unironically love Margaritaville but I could do without the Hoogachakas
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): opening truly serves this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmPDoNrGWng
 
**1998tweety** (7): There are several iconic bits to this song, but as a whole, it gets a bit annoying.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): Todd’s episode on this made me like this cover less, but I think it still bops.
 
**aulyve** (6): The ooga-chaka is iconic and the pre-chorus is lovely but I wish they'd either committed to the weirdness for the whole song or just cut that part out and played it straight because it ends up being pretty disjointed.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): lowkey boring besides the ooga chaka
 
**MrSwearword** (6): it's endearing but annoying as shit
 
**ryjomom** (6): OOGGGAAAA CHOCASFDASK
 
**jolteonhoodie** (5): The song mostly is fine but OOGA CHAKA OOGA OOGA CHAKA kills that mood entirely
 
**jval888** (5): actually unrated, remove this later *[NO]*
 
**rosesmp3** (5): ooga chaka ooga chaka
 
**Steelstepladder** (5): It's good when you're not listening to it.
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (4.5): James Gunn and your dad may have tricked you into thinking the Ouga Chaga is in any way pleasant but I remain undeceived. I’m also not a fan of rhyming feeling and believing, Journey you are not. Other than that the rest of song is fine
 
**yourhostandpatron** (4): Haha, what? God, why are the Swedes in this rate ruining everything? No offense, Sweden, but did it take Ace of Base to get your shit together before you started making good music? Everything about this is pretty questionable; there’s the ridiculous chant everybody used to know before this song faded into obscurity mucking everything else about Hooked on a Feeling up, and what’s worse about it is that when you dig under and try to find anything else that’s good about it, it *still* sucks. Come on, Sweden.
 
**feldya** (3): The song is nice enough but that intro is just grating to me.
 
**mars4mann** (3): honestly one time That '70s show did a scene transition where they inhaled helium and sang this song and now that's all I can hear
 
**Osaka1268** (3): Hey lets take a perfectly good song and throw and obnoxious OOGA CHAKA over it!
 
**CreepyMannequin** (2): Justice for the original by B.J. Thomas.

**kioescport** (2): This is a weird song and I hate it. Honestly this is probably a 5 if you just get rid of the fucking OOGA CHAKA OOGA CHAKA OOGA CHAKA.
 
**realboxwood** (2): Tbh the chanting makes it a struggle to not just immediately turn this off
 
**kappyko** (1): the chanting sent me and it's CONTINUED THROUGH THE SONG

#DAVID HASSELHOFF

**camerinian** (4): I can't believe I'm gonna say this but I unironically prefer the David Hasselhoff version, which at least had some nice backing vocals, less horribly dated instrumentals and relied way less on ooga chaka to carry the verses.

#ALLY MCBEAL

**Lagozzino** (6): If we were rating David Hasselhoff's cover it would get an 11. No, a 12!

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.2): 5 of these points are for the ally mcbeal baby alone


#GUARDIANS OF THE FREAKING GALAXY

**agentofscranton** (10): stan main pop girl drax the destroyer

**ManofOranges** (10): It's very possible that I only think this song is so good because of its use in Guardians of the Galaxy but like... who cares this song is great

**vapourlomo** (10): Sorry Todd, but I've gotta side with Starlord on this one. This goes hard in the paint.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I would like to thank Guardians of the Galaxy for putting this song back into the popular zeitgeist

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The Marvel nerds are right--this slaps.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): insert guardians of the galaxy comment here

**junobeekeeper** (5.1): I've heard this song so many times since the first GOTG and it hasn't gotten worse but it hasn't gotten any better for me.

**enecks** (2): Thor Ragnarok outsold Guardians of the Galaxy by being actually funny

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): This would’ve been my 11 if it was in the rate
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): I'm too long
 
**RetardedNinja35** (7.9): This song sounds extremely familiar to something but I can’t figure out what it is.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Rick Derringer’s actually a surprisingly relevant figure in the history of pop and rock that we should probably be thankful for (the guy produced all of Weird Al’s early albums!) but his recent turn to the Christian right is...very, very bad. Not the tea, Rick. Not the tea. Even past that, though, I’m not as excited for Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo as I am for some of the other songs in this rate. It’s actually a really enjoyable song, and Rick’s vocals are good, but it’s not much more than a lot of hooks to me, and they aren’t even particularly timeless hooks, in my opinion. Also, I don’t care if hoochie koo is blues slang for sense. That shit at the end of a song title sucks.
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): Pretty great all around but I find it hard to really care about it at the end of the day

**elizakp** (3): I hate the phrase "hoochie koo" *[METOO]*
 
**ImADudeDuh** (3): I imagine this is what plays in a Hooters
 
**ryjomom** (3): all i think of is being in my local record/cd/video-game shop and looking forward to leaving so i don’t have to listen to their music

A lot of OHWs become hits because their song hits a niche that no other song has before, partly because you can't help but think of the song whenever the subject comes up, and partly because it gives hack soundtrack curators an easy reference point. The song holds up pretty well, but it's clearly on the novelty side of this rate.

**radiofan15** (1): if I see another "funny" martial arts training montage set to this song, I swear this baby is gonna blow into a million bit of bits of tiny pieces just like my favorite scene in Scanners.

#DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION

**1998tweety** (10): I'm sure some of y'all "faux-wokeheads" will give this a low score cause of "racial insensitivity" or something like that....but this is still a 10 and it bops and its iconic
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Kung Fu Fighting walked so Chun-Li could go for a swim
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (10): Timeless classic that fully embraces its cheesiness. If this had been made with just a single ounce of seriousness it would have been a complete disaster.
 
**ExtraEater** (10): Funky China men from funky Chinatown
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is why mixing races is a good idea
 
**ManofOranges** (10): I took a karate class because of this song
 
**MrSwearword** (10): cheesy disco was a thing and it gets no cheesier than this but it's also a slay
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I don’t want to hear slander for this masterpiece, Carl Douglas gave animated family movies material for many years to come and for this we are thankful
 
**roxieloxie** (9.5): are we sure everyone was Kung fu fighting’s
 
**sbb618** (9.5): Not sure how I should feel about the line "There were funky Chinamen, from funky Chinatown", but this song is still great
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (8): For 3 minutes and 18 seconds I love kung fu
 
**vapourlomo** (8): A tad problematic ("funky Chinamen??" yikes) but too much fun to truly hate
 
**realboxwood** (7.5): Quite possibly the song on this list with the most long-lasting cultural impact
 
**camerinian** (7): Yeah! I love kung fu! I don’t know dick about it, but Carl sure does! Go Carl! I feel you!
 
**feldya** (7): The fact that this fun song was recorded basically to fill up space on the B-side of the record in 10 minutes, complete with goofy sounds, and that Douglas' inspiration was seeing some kids play fighting and writing lyrics about what they were literally doing makes this even better.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): can you imagine if someone tried to release this nowadays
 
**ryjomom** (7): Wii Rock Band Realness
 
**SpanKKy1** (7): is this racist
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): Feel like this song ight be a little bit racist, but it still kind of bops
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): This is a silly novelty song that’s not really anything special, but as a guy who’s actually Chinese I find it to be...kind of adorable?! Yeah, Carl Douglas uses ‘chinaman’ once in a rather unfortunate lyric, and you could argue that this is adjacent to stereotyping all East Asians as martial arts masters, but given the historical link between black people and Chinese people bonding over kung fu films I’m willing to let it slide. By the way, a website for Carl Douglas [still exists and it’s super cute.](http://carl-douglas.com/)

#KUNG FU PANDA
 
**nicknac4** (6.5): The classic version of "I want to be ninja" by main pop girl Jennifer Murphy (look it up if you're uncultured)
 
**aulyve** (6): Gotta subtract points for reckless orientalism, gotta give props for still getting a respectable disco banger out of it.
 
**enecks** (6): What is the point of analysing this? It's a gimmick, but a competent one.
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Carl is my favorite ninja
 
**skaiansightseer** (6): orientalism, but make it slap
 
**junobeekeeper** (4.8): I just think of the Kung Fu Panda movie.
 
**Steelstepladder** (4): Not the worst thing in the world but this has been used in so many kids movies it's hard to think of this as an actual song
 
**waluigiest** (4): eeeeeee
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (3.2): never cared for this

It's a pretty badly produced track that somehow still has a lot of appeal. When it turned into a hit, there was no real way to copy it or build on it, so OMC was nauturally destined to be two hit wonders. But at least it was fun while it lasted.

#NEW ZEALAND IS BIZARRE

**camerinian** (10): There is sincerely no way I can possibly rate this song objectively. I was born in New Zealand one year after this song was released, and in the year of it being a big deal overseas, and I'm fairly certain that the hook is the first non-nursery-rhyme-or-Wiggles melody I remember ever learning, and since then, every element of this song has so thoroughly and utterly infiltrated every element of my identity as a Kiwi interested in music that it's like trying to put a score on the concept of a haka. It's always been there, and I'm certain it always will be, even if it is prooooooobably about nothing.
 
**enecks** (10): Stan NZ
 
**MrSwearword** (10): bizarre only applies to the dude singing it but everything here just works
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): Extremely iconic chorus, still a hit
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (9): God, those lyrics are terrible. The vocal performance is less than stellar as well. But the samba instrumental combined with the narmy charm of the whole thing can’t help but make me love it.
 
**elizakp** (9): I adore this weird ass song
 
**feldya** (9): That trumpet and melodica. A breezy song to cruise down to the beach to. The "everytime I look around" response is my favorite part to aggressively yell at people when this song comes on.
 
**ManofOranges** (8.5): I hit a car I hit a car
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): very aight
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): oh wow a wave of nostalgia to being like a toddler with this on the radio in the car and just looking out the window
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Yeah, guys, apparently New Zealand scored a hit on the charts even before Royals got released. This rate really is a trip. I can spot a lot of strange influences in this song, which makes its existence even more weird, but I appreciate it for being a funny little spot of kitsch in the grand scheme of things. It’s probably fun to sing along to, too.
 
**junobeekeeper** (7.4): It's fun?
 
**realboxwood** (7): It feels like the only really appropriate medium for this song is a roadtrip montage
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The Parent Trap

#THE SONG IS BIZARRE
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): This song is kind of bizarre not gonna lie
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): yeah its def bizarre
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): This song is calming

Billy Rae Cyrus was saved from the indignity of appearing in this rate. But putting the memes aside, he's still a one hit wonder, right? "Old Town Road" is not his song, and even if it was, it's a Robby Ray Stewart track, in the same way that "Put Your Hearts Up" was a Cat Valentine track. Right? Okay, fine. I like this song.

**radiofan15** (10): Every Mexican know this song by heart so I can't give anything other than a 10 to this unsung masterpiece

#Miley's dad

**ImADudeDuh** (10): KING of longevity!
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Billy snapped
 
**MrSwearword** (10): the tackiest piece of shit to ever become a hit. Shoutout if you too had that toy truck with Billy all over it. YOU KNOW WHICH ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT
 
**roxieloxie** (10): I got the achy breakup horses in the back
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): a two hit legend
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Country legend Billy Ray Cyrus, a true music titan with more Billboard Hot 100™ #1 hits than Nicki Minaj.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): I didn’t understand why a song as famous as Achy Breaky Heart wasn’t in the main rate until I realized Billy Ray Cyrus just had a Number #1 hit! Oops. Anyway, this is pretty much the cheesy song to end all cheesy country songs, and the lack of any right-wing nonsense in it helps with making it a great guilty pleasure. Couple that with the fact that Billy Ray Cyrus is Miley Cyrus’s dad, and, holy shit, the chaotic potential in this song becomes enormous. It all gets so ridiculous to the point where I can non-ironically call Achy Breaky Heart fire. Johnny Cash who? Dolly Parton who?
 
**sbb618** (7.5): I cannot understand these lyrics at all

#Also Trace and Noah's father
 
**RetardedNinja35** (6.2): This was the biggest song in Australia in 1992. I am disappointed
 
**camerinian** (6): Don’t tell my horse, my achy breaky horse
 
**vapourlomo** (5): insert Old Town Road joke
 
**1998tweety** (4): just like OTR, everything he works on is trash. At least Miley makes bops

This is another "catchphrase hit" where it got big off of a short hook. I personally didn't think the rest of the song was worth going through for it. Check out the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, even Blur's first album over anything EMF.
 
**radiofan15** (3.8): It's quite surprising how memory led me to believe this was such an earworm when it's so busy and full of noise you can barely feel the weak melody they dare to call chorus

#BELIEVER

**agentofscranton** (10): this song just gives off like the coolest vibes
 
**jolteonhoodie** (10): Oh! What the, fuuuuuck, man (It's unbelievable) I love the production on this song
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Oh this is a hit
 
**MrSwearword** (10): not even that Kraft commercial/CRUMB-believable can detract from this
 
**vapourlomo** (10): Good to see Andrew Dice Clay got himself on a massive hit song
 
**1998tweety** (9): I'm liking this more than I feel like I should, it's weird but somehow it works well.
 
**skaiansightseer** (9): JOCK JAMS BABY
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): some funky stuff going on in the production but i hate that the hook is so omnipresent in american advertising
 
**junobeekeeper** (8.6): My mom had a friend who only listened to three songs on a cassette tape, and they were Truckin' by the Grateful Dead, Magic Carpet Ride by Steppenwolf, and this.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): What...what is this? Is this rock mixed with house? And it was released around the same time Nirvana debuted, too. This actually sounds a bit like new wave, but for the 90s. Pop really is full of charms and wonders sometimes. That’s why this is such a special rate, I suppose. Anyway, I don’t have much to say about Unbelievable, but it’s particularly charming precisely because of its strange place in history. I like it.
 
**kioescport** (8): I want to deny that I kind of love it but hey, we can't all be perfect
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): guitar solo always brings the score up a notch
 
**enecks** (7): I have no feelings other than a mild fondness
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): O!
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): awesome when you're listening to it but as soon as the song ends I find it hard to care too much

#AGNOSTIC
 
**camerinian** (6): it’s believably 90’s.
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (6): That Andrew Dice Clay sample is such a weird touch I can’t help but love it. The rest is competent and catchy, but ultimately too overbearing and self-centered to be anything more than just average.
 
**realboxwood** (6): This song feels like it shouldn’t exist outside of sports highlight reels and skateboarding videos
 
**ryjomom** (6): Shrek?
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): *Crumbelievable
 
**tapdancingpig** (6): Barbie did it better.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): The chorus dings but I can live without everything else
 
**kappyko** (5): Baggy being a thing and then disappearing was crazy
 
**waluigiest** (2): how was this a hit?
 
**aulyve** (1): This song has always been completely unbearable and I hope everyone involved in its creation is dead now.

I was kinda surprised to see this song all the way down here. I thought it was a haunting, emotionally powerful track along the lines of With Every Heartbeat, but most of popheads saw Tracy Thorn as a generic house chantenuse over a generic house beat, which isn't entirely wrong. I would still recommend giving EBTG a try even if you didn't like this song in particular, as they covered a lot of sonic ground in their 17 years of existence.

**radiofan15** (1): Everything but this shit please
 
---
 
**enecks** (10): why the fuck am I crying so hard
 
**ExtraEater** (10): Invented analogies
 
**junobeekeeper** (10): Emotionally devastating bangers are fun!
 
**Lagozzino** (10): The power of a good remixer
 
**Osaka1268** (10): Like the deserts miss the rain~
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): Genuinely deserves top five.
 
**1998tweety** (9): I feel like, this song, in particular, is one of those that I probably would've stanned hard if I heard when it was released, but unfortunately now, I only find it good.
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (9): The remix is a huge improvement over the original. It was a good choice to trade minimal, boring electronica for a pulsing house beat. The maudlin lyrics are sometimes funny to laugh at, but when you’ve got that groove going, who’s paying attention?
 
**ManofOranges** (9): This is a pretty good song I think although for me it's a little to restrained for me
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Simply a fantastic song, whether you appreciate it as a poignant expression of uncertainty and loneliness that captures a fear of abandonment that hasn’t been quite just as present since the dawn of the Internet, a great dance team from the mid 90s with excellent production from an obscure duo that deserves to be more recognized, or both. This is one of the most beautiful hits of its kind I’ve ever heard.
 
**hikkaru** (8.5): house bop!
 
**camerinian** (7.5): You know how everybody describes that Burial album as sounding like going home on the London tube at 3am after a warehouse rave and you're having a drag on a cigarette even though the poppers are still running through your body so your mood is in a total state of flux? I feel like this song has the same mood except you're on the subway after leaving a gay club in New York after not being successful in finding someone to go home with and so you end up just reflecting on all your past relationship disasters with your eyes adjusting to the bright lights of the train after coming in out of the dark of night after ducking around the corner relying on the drags of a smoke to keep you warm in the bitter cold of the night at 4am and this reference is way too obscure for popheads and I've never even been to New York or London for that matter what the fuck am I saying
 
**MrSwearword** (7): weak against the field but the singing is on point
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): chill jam
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This instrumental is too good
 
**waluigiest** (7): god designing my sexual preferences
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): generic remix of a song that’s generic
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): kinda meh for a mid-90s house bop
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): ok
 
**realboxwood** (6): This definitely sounds like a remix or a song that wasn't made to be remixed
 
**vapourlomo** (6): An objectively good song that I've never been able to truly love
 
**RetardedNinja35** (5.5): This song just makes me think of the ‘Cowbell’ skit from SNL.
 
**aulyve** (4): Washes over me like a pleasant tide of nothing.
 
**nicknac4** (3.3): kinda bland
 
**ryjomom** (3): generic 90s song with a dance beat

This got to where it was because of 20 seconds of Michael Jackson.

#HERE FOR THE KING OF POP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The scariest thing about this is the idea of Michael Jackson watching you!
 
**MrSwearword** (10): Michael Jackson on backup vocals/nameless feature is the only reason this song ever became a hit which is weird because the production also deserves credit.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Cue the hordes of people who thought this was Michael Jackson

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): I legit thought this song was 100% Michael Jackson until pretty recently.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): yeah the guy’s singing is not… the best, but this is a GOOD spooky song. (insert comment about MJ).
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I’m not a big fan of Rockwell’s voice (to be honest, it sounds like he’s playing out some sort of exaggerated character in here but failing miserably) and I feel guilty for giving some money to Michael Jackson’s estate again, but, wow, what a standout in this rate. In an era where Motown was losing its intergrity and going to shit, this is a refreshing, if not necessarily legendary continuation of the sleek, funk roots of the label that used to dominate America. I wonder if Rockwell ever found out who was watching him? Maybe it was...them….

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Michael’s chorus-10/10 the verses-6/10

**RetardedNinja35** (7.4): Nobody’s watching you Rockwell cause nobody knows who you are
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (7): Thriller’s less-entertaining younger brother, this song has those spooky vibes that make it great for a Halloween party but pretty useless any other time of the year. That IRS joke is pretty bad as well.
 
**elizakp** (7): MJ Knockoff, but done well
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): Incredible chorus, okay verses

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): A mediocre Michae JAckson song with spoken word guest verses.

**skaiansightseer** (6): Michael Jackson's greatest carry job

**enecks** (5): Rockwell is talentless, and not in the mood to hear MJ's voice right now.

**junobeekeeper** (4.7): People will say the chorus is the only good part but it's just not that good anyway!
 
**camerinian** (4): Did anyone else grow up with that mid-2000s remix of this song that straight up cut Rockwell out of his own song and just left the chorus? That was a smart move
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (4): discount Michael Jackson will not be tolerated
 
**ryjomom** (4): Needs more MJ

**kappyko** (2): imagine getting mj to sing your chorus instead of the whole song

I can’t be the only one thinking of that episode, right? I can’t believe Todd didn’t mention this in his video. Extra, Dude, come on, where are you? About the song itself: it’s a strange little oddity thanks to the concurrency between the artists’ names and the name of the song, but I really like Living in a Box. It has this refined feel to it that makes the it deserving of the label sophisti-pop, and while it doesn’t quite sound fully realized, it’s special enough to be one of my favorite new wave songs from this rate. It’s not as good as Take On Me...but it’s close.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a bop and a sample thats used pretty well tbh
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Mya really snapped on this
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Oh, hey, it’s that other guy from the Fugees! But, seriously, I should check out their second album sometime. Ghetto Supastar might have been Pras’s only chance to sign, but, thankfully, it’s actually pretty fun. I find Mya’s hook contribution to be the song’s most addictive part, but everybody thankfully just a good job here and this is a pretty catchy throwback to a long-forgotten single with Ol’ Dirty Bastard on it. Solid four stars.
 
**enecks** (8): Iconic hook, ehconic everything else.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): low-key bop
 
**skargardin** (8): omg what a throwback!! I used to LOVE this hook
 
**vapourlomo** (8): Dolly Parton and ODB, together at last!
 
**waluigiest** (8): I always thought it was “get ‘em superstar”
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): Mya? I wonder if this will be sapphire's 11. It bops a bit *[jokes on you, u/sapphire1912 didn't even bothered with this rate]*
 
**sbb618** (7): The Fugees all went solo after breaking up. Lauryn Hill won a shit-ton of Grammys. Wyclef Jean had a few hit singles, did pretty well for himself. And Pras...well, two out of three ain't bad.

#Old Dirty Bastard bask and blow
 
**camerinian** (6.5): It’s a great sample and I love ODB unconditionally, but being the most boring part of your own one hit is a major black mark
 
**junobeekeeper** (6.2): Okay!
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): I just want to know what Bee Gees song they sampled because literally all the Bee Gees are credited with this song

On one hand, this song is an annoying novelty. On the other hand, you need to be a massive grouch to give a negative score to Scatman John's inspirational story and the utopian ideals of Scatland. I am that grouch.

**radiofan15** (7.5): And people dare to say no one can write a chorus as powerful and complex as Taylor Swift's...

#BEST LYRICIST OF OUR TIMES...

**JanuraryFourteenth** (11): I still wanna live in Scatman’s World
 
**Steelstepladder** (11): There has never been a man more deserving of an 11 than Scatman John
 
**agentofscranton** (10): scatman's verses walked so roman holiday could run
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (10): The memes. The song. The voice. The scatting. The man. The myth. The legend.
 
**enecks** (10): A utopian, inclusive vision: Scatman John took the inherent optimism and eccentricity of Euro-dance and took it to heights of pure bliss.
 
**ExtraEater** (10): Invented bop
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): An inspiring story.
 
**realboxwood** (10): This feels like a meme song and a motivational speech all in one, thank you Mr. Scatman John for my life
 
**skargardin** (10): iconic and anyone who gives this any less than a 10 is automatically cancelled
 
**SpanKKy1** (10): i love scat porn
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): What did he mean by this?
 
**yourhostandpatron** (10): The only jazz song in this rate is by far the most wholesome one. Okay, but seriously, I’m into disability theory and I find the existence of this song to be absolutely glorious, guys. Scatman John doesn’t find success in this song in spite of his stutter! He uses his stutter for something good! And the way he pulls it off is too subversive to be inspiration porn fodder, too. When I learned he died so soon after this song was released, I was really, really sad, but I suppose all good things come to an end. He passed with grace. I don’t feel like giving this my 11, exactly, but thank God for Scatman John. If Popheads doesn’t respect him, I'm flipping out on y’all!
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): i understand these syllables more than most ari songs
 
**junobeekeeper** (9.1): It's Scatman's World, and we're just living in it <3
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): who's the cute asian guy tho
 
**nicknac4** (8.2): I had erased this from my mind.. kinda catchy
 
**1998tweety** (8): Kind of a classic, the talent needed to sing that chorus...too high
 
**belfman** (8): good song, AMAZING artist. This was my favorite song when I was 2.
 
**elizakp** (8): A Ski-Ba-BOP
 
**feldya** (8): I love Scatman John's story more than the song, but the song is pretty great too. A jazz pianist who took to scatting to talk about his speech impediment and insecurities - what's not to love?
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (8): The Scatman should be celebrating gay icon
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): This is way more fleshed out than I remember.
 
**vapourlomo** (8): Shout out to Master of None
 
**williamdowley123** (8): straight people shit but this time its good
 
**camerinian** (7.5): I want see a movie made about Scatman John one of these days. In fact it's kind of amazing that this is an actual person that existed with this career arc and not as part of some tortured artist Lifetime fluff piece
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): All hail our new pop girl!

**LuckyKidA** (1): nah
 
**MrSwearword** (1): I have my limits in terms of how much production choices I can take and this just sucks.

#'VENICE BITCH' TEAS

**enecks** (10): Stream The Simpsons memes (seriously, this should've been in the rate, it is truly an ambitious masterpiece)
 
**MrSwearword** (10): Jack Antonoff wishes he was self indulgent enough to give masterful anything let alone this legendary track. A title that was a drunken uttering of "In the Garden of Eden", an iconic feature gag in The Simpsons, being a sample for Nas' "Hip Hop is Dead"; this song did THATPART
 
**saucymac** (10): ok but i always thought it was in the garden of eden
 
**sbb618** (10): Wait a minute, this sounds like rock and/or roll!
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): A bop that's 12 minutes too long
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): I am a slut for longform prog rock songs like this, so this get's a higher rating than it probably deserves
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): sure!
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This 17 minute version slaps but what on earth is this name
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): There are two songs over ten minutes in the bonus rate and now I’m questioning why I actually wanted to do it in the first place. Agh. All I can say to Iron Butterfly for making this song is...well, congratulations? It’s an impressive feat, but it’s way more of a curiosity than an epic acclaimed by all in the vein of Purple Rain or Station to Station. There’s ambition here for sure, but nobody in this band is an especially talented musician and the song isn’t blessed with advanced enough production to make the sections of the song that ramble on sound all that interesting. I’ll give it a pity score.

#LONG AND SATANIC...
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): nope. not gonna listen to 17 minutes of it
 
**1998tweety** (6.5): It's ok
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): Only pep band kids
 
**Steelstepladder** (6): I respect it but man oh man I can't listen to the whole thing
 
**vapourlomo** (5): Great hook! Did it need to be that long though?
 
**RetardedNinja35** (4.6): Too long
 
**camerinian** (4): it's how long?????
 
**jolteonhoodie** (4): The shortened version is like, an 8
 
**Lagozzino** (2): The edited version would get a much higher score, but the full version is suuuuuch a drag. That fuckin drum solo...
 
**ignitethephoenix** (1): it’s too empty sounding (also I only got 2 minutes in I don’t have time for a 17min song)

#WE WANT THE FUNK

**1998tweety** (10): The production on this is so so good; what an earworm.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (10): Some may find this annoying, I find it charming.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): honestly a mix that went so well together, best thing white men did with funk until Uptown Funk!
 
**ManofOranges** (10): This is probably one of the funkiest songs I've ever heard
 
**MrSwearword** (10): one of the best relics of the 70s that don't already belong to Donna Summer
 
**rslashpoopheads** (10): this is it folks
 
**camerinian** (9): I can't believe this song didn't cure racism wtf
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): https://i.imgur.com/ViWm8Vn.png
 
**vapourlomo** (9): The second-greatest disco-rock song of all time! (behind Miss You, of course)
 
**enecks** (8): Weirdly uniting, unweirdly catchy.
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): Honestly...... funkier than it needed to be.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Commence That Bluesy Composition Caucasian
 
**waluigiest** (8): @popheads
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): This is my biggest disappointment so far within the rate, and the wild (heh) thing about it is that I’m still giving it an 8. Here’s why I’m a bit sad: from the snippets Todd played in his review of this song, I expected it to be this amazing fusion of rock and disco. Then I actually listened to it, and, well...it’s good, which is why I’m still giving it a high score, but my main qualm with it is that the lead singer sounds like he’s trying to emulate Robert Plant (well, they were a cover band at first, I suppose) and desperately failing due to his lack of proper intonation. My impression of Play That Funky Music, therefore, is no longer as great as it once was for a few brief minutes. With that being said, though, I do think there’s a lot to admire in a rock band full of white guys choosing to embrace disco and funk instead of reacting violently to black genres like other people did in the 70s. And, for how cheesy and dated it all is, I don’t think you can’t deny that the very fact that Play That Funky Music was written is sort of a symbol of racial integration and harmony. Is its existence gentrification? ...actually, maybe it is, but I can’t really find any malice here I should be unhappy about. In short? The white boys can continue playing funky music, but, hoo, boy, am I keeping my eye on them!

**ryjomom** (7): I Identify as the white boi

**nicknac4** (6): This song was very prominent in my childhood for some reason. Not sure if that is a good or bad thing
 
**skaiansightseer** (5): boneless P-Funk
 
**junobeekeeper** (4.3): So in elementary school we had this news program that was run by the librarian, and she would play this song a lot as an outro song. It was fun, but I just don't love it.

#STORYTIME

**feldya** (11): I can't get enough of this power pop anthem and if you play this at a bar 20 years from now, I'll still be screaming out the chorus at the top of my lungs. A killer pre-chorus, huge vocal harmonies, a cool choppy guitar part in the verse, the pause before "girl" in the last chorus, the triplet snare fill to end the last chorus... and I "absolutely love" the way the keyboard solo leads into the guitar solo. There's a lot that keeps me coming back to this song years later.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): ugh mom and dad just don't get it (i love this so much)
 
**bespectacIed** (10): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic
 
**CarlieScion** (10): b o p
 
**elizakp** (10): Holy shit I love this song, reminds me of 5th grade gym class
 
**ExtraEater** (10): this iiiis
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): I have a weird attachment to this song as it was the first song on my iPod from my mom’s music library. Plus, it reminds me of my girlfriend.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): This sounds exactly like it belongs on a teen movie soundtrack which means it's right up my alley
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): Eleven worthy. Makes me think of the picture day episode of Lizzie McGuire. Hilary Duff really gave us the premiere episode and then just in episode two went and snapped like this. She really showed us what it's like to be a good friend and other main pop girlies just can't relate. This song playing over her covered in paint holding her grandma's sweater in the picture ugh her power is honestly endless, her influence will be felt for ages.
 
**realboxwood** (10): “It's basically a terrible, unimpressive piece of garbage. As a matter of fact, just about the only interesting thing about it is that it may be the greatest song of all time.”
 
**TragicKingdom1** (10): tied for runner-up for my 11
 
**enecks** (9): Stream Mouth Moods
 
**Lagozzino** (8): Ok but like that half-second pause in the final chorus? Musical genius.
 
**ryjomom** (8): “You so fuckin' precious when you smile”
 
**sbb618** (8): There is surprisingly little to this song beyond the chorus
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): Bring back the carefree late 20s white ladies from early 2000s romcoms!!
 
**Steelstepladder** (8): Really really really really really really really really good. Can't say it's great though

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The girl is me
 
**vapourlomo** (7): Replacement-level pop-rock.
 
**camerinian** (6.5): I scored this entirely based on what proportion of the song is chorus, because what a fucking hook it is, and what a fucking unnecessary nothing the rest of it is
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): a fucking massive bop chorus, but nothing else is memorable at all.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6): This is...sinister. Whenever I listen to this song, I take a deep breath, close my eyes, and somehow manage to figure out just how exactly hits like these gave birth to such abominations like Hey Soul Sister. If my eyeballs recede even further, I can see Pat Monahan's face. No. This is too much. I must stop it now. Fortunately, I don’t really hate Absolutely as much as Todd does. It’s mediocre, but sometimes cheese is a necessity in this dreadful journey we call life, and this barely gets on cheese’s right side.

**Cherry\_Whine** (2): There is only one good Christian rock song (“Flood” by Jars of Clay, which is unfortunately not on the main list, takes the honor), so this obviously has to get a one. Irritating, annoying, and an assault on the eardrums.
 
**nicknac4** (1): the sound of the singers voice is like the sound of Nancy Kerrigan after Tonya took a baton to her leg...haunting

#Noah (2014 film)
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): So we’ve come to this. We are actually rating a Christian rock song. Hoo, boy. Technically, we did rate Bring Me Back To Life last month, though so...I actually really like how the frontman of Jars and Clay is incredibly woke for a Christian band from a white Evangelical background, but this song ain’t it, unfortunately. Okay, I can actually see how it could’ve been a really stellar hit in another world, but there’s no way that Flood is executed to its maximum potential as a whole, and like all Christian bands, the singing here is pretty bad. I’ll pass. Catch me listening to Sufjan instead.
 
**Steelstepladder** (6): Not bad for a religious band but I'd never personally listen to it
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song sounds like Game of Thrones season 8
 
**enecks** (4): Stream whichever Cupcakke song she talks about making a flood with her squirt
 
**camerinian** (3): thank you for putting this in the bonus rate instead of the main one. I don't think I'd be able to bare the Christian youth group flashbacks caused by listening to this PTSD trigger
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (3): This song is like listening to paint dry
 
**junobeekeeper** (2.1): it's fine.
 
**ryjomom** (2): very white guys in a band feeling edgy af and sounding like a garage

The song that singlehandedly birthed Girlfriend, Hollaback Girl, Shake It Off and Give Me All Your Luvin. The woman who's worked with everyone from The Talking Heads to David Bowie to James Brown to Devo to the Monkees. The woman who, let's be real, is pretty far down the list of great New Wave acts. Still, unlike other people in this rate she can claim to have improved upon the song she covered, and for those who can't stand this song there's always her follow-up single "Nobody", which is basically "Mickey" without the cheerleader-ness.

**radiofan15** (7): The chorus is such an earworm I gotta say its a shame the rest of the song is so relatively bland

#OMI - CHEERLEADER.mp3
 
**ryjomom** (11): Reminds me of the 1998 film Edge of Seventeen. Gays let me hear y’all make some noise.
 
**1998tweety** (10): One of my favs from this rate, I remember bopping to it so much when I was younger. Honestly everything about this song is perfect, it narrowly loses out on being my 11.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): too iconic for words...
 
**kappyko** (10): WHY ISNT THIS ON SPOTIFY
 
**letsallpoo** (10): carmen won that
 
**MrSwearword** (10): another contender for my eleven, this song and video fucking slay. Kitschy 80s gold and the fact Toni Basil had her actual cheerleading outfit for the video is all the more legendtinta.
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (10): Gay pride
 
**skargardin** (10): yes yes YES
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): And for the record, the choreography in the music video is also a 10.
 
**SpanKKy1** (10): an absolute tune
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): Cheerleading in Pop is one of the best things to exist?
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Shake It Off found dead
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): gwen stefani bald
 
**sbb618** (9.5): Pure joy.
 
**aulyve** (9): How can you not love the shit out of this.
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (8): Another ear-piranha that’s maybe even better at eating your brain alive than “Tubthumping”.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): ok
 
**waluigiest** (8): peg me mickey
 
**jolteonhoodie** (7.8): God I can't believe she was like, 38 when she released this
 
**junobeekeeper** (7.8): how fun!
 
**RetardedNinja35** (7.6): When I was a kid I thought she was singing about Mickey Mouse.

#KATY PERRY - PEACOCK.mp3
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): It’s a cheerleader song, and, let’s be honest, it’s not even as good as Hollaback Girl, isn’t it? I was expecting some kind of classic one hit wonder from Toni Basil here, since Mickey was one of the few songs I recognized off this rate’s entire playlist, but I’m not really sure this song comes together as well as all of the best hits that follow that tried and tested 80s formula tends to do. Sorry, Mickey, but you’ll have to settle in the lower ranks. I’m glad Missy from Doctor Who appropriated this for her own benefit, though...
 
**enecks** (6): Stream lollipop chainsaw.
 
**realboxwood** (4): As a singer, Toni Basil is a really good dancer
 
**Steelstepladder** (3): Iconic does not mean good
 
**camerinian** (2.5): I’ll be honest, most of the things in this song terrify me on an existential level, not least of all the video which exacerbates everything. Don’t ask me to elaborate
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (0): BLECH

This song should be lame, and it should be sappy, but somehow it nails the mystical romance vibe it's going for.

**radiofan15** (9.8): We love Carly Rae Jepsen's mother!
 
---

#I LOVE YOU 3000
 
**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Such a calming song, and yet it still builds up so so well.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (11): me @ this song. just so many childhood memories of this being on the radio and dancing around the house in a much more innocent time, and it still holds up! been rediscovering it for a few months and was pleasantly surprised to find it was genuinely a great song even without the nostalgia factor. the bridge is absolutely transcendent! hopefully i meet someone who makes me feel this inside, but until then i'll dedicate it to myself because that's even more important
 
**kappyko** (11): im ascending
 
**Osaka1268** (11): I'm kind of eh on easy listening music but this has one of the best hooks ever made and it will stay in your head for the rest of your life always and forever.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): stream betty who's cover gays
 
**bespectacIed** (10): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic
 
**ExtraEater** (10): Heaven
 
**feldya** (10): This song needs to play only its opening chord to give me chills. This song creates a whole atmosphere that's both understated and danceable. It makes me want to both take a quite moment to reflect, and to celebrate life loudly. The bridge to this song is so big, shifting from synths and guitars, to piano and organ, and slowly bringing in more and more instrumentation and vocals, before moving back to it's chill but grooving chorus. It's hard to not feel that this song is meaningful, which is something a lot of OHW's struggle with (as opposed to being simply fun and catchy).
 
**MrSwearword** (10): one of the most nondescript but well made songs ever. Betty Who can fucking rot for trying to ruin this magical song.
 
**realboxwood** (10): Have to admit, did not think a song with a title like this would turn out to be so sincere and interesting. I really like the fact that it takes a full minute and a half to get to the chorus, it’s a nice build
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (10): Without a hint of irony, Donna Lewis sang one of the most ethereal songs of the 90’s, with an absolute earworm of a hook, but the thing that gives ILYAF a 10 is the bridge with the striking piano notes, a bold choice on a song so soft but it is pulled off
 
**ryjomom** (10): A /r/popheads Wet Dream of a Song
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Are there any bad musicians with the first name Donna
 
**nicknac4** (9.1): I used to listen to this while in a spin class, so it has a special place in my heart
 
**kioescport** (9): This is the exact amount of sugary sweet repetitiveness my heart desires.
 
**Steelstepladder** (9): this song makes me feel like I'm drowning in a sea of puppies and I'm okay with that
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): ethereal vibe, well-paced crescendo - I approve
 
**elizakp** (8): This is better than it has any right to be
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): I’d never heard this until this rare but this is such a pleasant song like it’s just velvet on the ears
 
**Lagozzino** (8): Every time you play this song you must accept that it will be stuck in your head for the next week and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
 
**ManofOranges** (8): This is a very nice song and it sounds very pretty, especially near the end when it has it's bridge I guess and it brings in what sounds like horns maybe? Just sounds really good
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): Donna Lewis invented chill indie pop in the year 1996 with this song.
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): Vocally she reminds me of Ellie Goulding a bit tbh
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Is it bad that I like Betty Who’s version more?
 
**RetardedNinja35** (7.3): A lot of sources claim that she was born in 1973, which would make her only 45. Surely that can’t be right as this was released in the mid-90s and she looks a lot older than 22 in the music video.
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (7): Even though this song is really annoying and unbearably melodramatic, I can’t bring myself to give it a rating lower than this. It’s all so innocent and almost in denial. It’s a mindless love song set in a fairytale world where nothing ever goes wrong, exemplified by that childlike delivery. It’s kinda creepy in a way, which is what makes it so fascinating.
 
**sbb618** (7): I feel like there's the base of a really good song here, but the verses just don't do it for me.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Before Marina started dropping hour long albums that nobody cared about, this was the only thing from Wales people paid attention to. Like You Light Up My Life, this song is a bit too cute and white for it to have any sort of long-lasting legacy past breaking the record books and generally being forgotten as the decades go by; unlike You Light Up My Life, this is not a ballad at all. Is this where Selena learned her whispering technique from? It’s mediocre, but Donna Lewis is charming enough.

#NEVER BEEN LOVED
 
**junobeekeeper** (6.9): Donna Lewis seems like she would have bullied me in middle school
 
**jolteonhoodie** (6.5): I'm going to have this chorus on loop inside my head for the next week
 
**LuckyKidA** (6.5): first minute: hmmm what is this? chorus hits: oh shit!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): this song is boring af but fuck she drilled a hole into my brain and poured in serotonin
 
**skaiansightseer** (6): the chorus phrasing is so weird but i love it
 
**SpanKKy1** (6): betty who did it better
 
**camerinian** (5.5): I begrudge/applaud this song for its hook, but otherwise this is like the antithesis of star power. Donna Lewis might be the least surprising one hit wonder here, and that's saying a lot
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): What a snooze fest
 
**vapourlomo** (5): Nice vibe, but way too repetitive for my taste

This isn't a real song anymore. It's the soundtrack to high school basketball and St. Patrick's bar crawls. You can't hear it for what it is, in the same way that you can't hear Sandstorm or Rock And Roll Pt. 2 as simple songs anymore. But those 2 songs kick ass and so does this.

**radiofan15** (10): I'm a basic hoe... I heard those screeching squeals and I start twerking as it was 2014 all over again

#JUMP IN (2007 FILM)
 
**enecks** (10): Hell yes
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): truly some of the hippiest hop.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): If I had a nickel for every time I heard this at some type of school function, I would actually be the richest man on earth
 
**MrSwearword** (10): anyone who doesn't give this a high score, you just have bad taste
 
**roxieloxie** (10): I’ve heard this before sampled somewhere and I can’t place it and it’s making me mad
 
**sbb618** (10): First it's the trumpets, setting up the cacophony to come. Then that high-pitched whistling noise kicks in, and you know you're about to get hyped up. Add it all together, and there's only one thing you can do: jump around. Jump around. Jump up, jump up and get down.
 
**skargardin** (10): The times when this was on the radio was such a simpler time :gaycat2:
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): if you don't like this song I'm not sure I ever want to speak to you
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snlnqU2q0g
 
**RetardedNinja35** (9.3): A great hip-hop song. Nothing more.
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (9): I know Todd loves this song, but I personally can’t get behind it as the greatest song of all time, but I still kinda adore it
 
**vapourlomo** (9): Not sure if it's the best song of the '90s like Todd says (I wouldn't even say it's the best '90s one-hit-wonder...shout out to Steal My Sunshine)
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (8.5): This is actually my least favorite TITS video but the song goes hard
 
**realboxwood** (8.5): After the line “If your girl steps up I’m smacking a ho,” an incredibly weak sounding clap plays in the background, a choice so insane that I had to play it back multiple times to make sure that I wasn’t just hearing things
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Oh, hey, a rap song by a white person I actually enjoy...that’s something I haven’t seen in a long time! All banter aside, though, past all the St. Patrick’s Day Parades and complex politics between native Irishmen and Irish-Americans, as much as something like Jump Around should alienate my senses, I find it hard to deny that the track absolutely bangs in this delightfully trash way. I suppose that me taking a liking towards it proves an age-old maxim: no pain, no gain!
 
**camerinian** (8): Those first 10 seconds might be some of the singular best moments of 90's music. There was no way the rest of the song could ever match it
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): The song of every commercial out there
 
**jolteonhoodie** (8): I'd give it a higher score but that high-pitched squeal hurts my ears

#JUMP (VAN HALEN COVER) - GLEE CAST.mp3
 
**junobeekeeper** (6.9): I'm Irish-American so I SHOULD like this but I just... don't.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.4): this is fun until like halfway through the first chorus and then it just overstays its welcome
 
**1998tweety** (6): It's ok, that weird sharp sound in the background gets extremely annoying after a while.
 
**mars4mann** (6): this reminds me of the meme that's the dog in the sweater and it's like jumper hound
 
**ryjomom** (6): This song has shown up at more Packer games this season than Aaron Rodgers. Did I make a sports ball reference!?
 
**kioescport** (5.5): Is this rated at all? If it is I'm calling it overrated, I've never liked this song. The beat is pretty good I guess, but I absolutely don't know what to do with the rest of this.
 
**Cherry\_Whine** (5): Great party song, but I’d never seek it out to listen to by myself. Maybe it’s Everlast’s faux-Irish accent or the indecipherable lyrics that drag this down for me.
 
**soft\_poo** (5): a hideous screeching beat that makes me want to eat nails, overated as.
 
**waluigiest** (5): collegiate sports dance cams gained an ally
 
**rslashpoopheads** (4): '-'
 
**slimboyfriend** (4): Very background-music-of-a-party-in-a-90s-teen-movie

**RetardedNinja35** (8.6): This song is still very relevant today (the sentiment, not the events itself) and while I don’t love the song, I still have to give a lot of respect to it. Unfortunately he contradicts himself by becoming a Christian in later years, a demographic known for their hate speech towards other people.
 
**elizakp** (8): I love depressing/nihilistic bops
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): I can think of so many things I could call this song. It’s Baby’s First Bob Dylan. It’s the 60s unit of an A.P U.S History semester tacked into one forgotten folk hit. It’s New Americana but for the boomer generation. It’s the line that separates you from your grandma, because when you say ‘McGuire’ she’s going to think back to the days where she protested against Vietnam, but you’re going to be thinking about how Come Clean was robbed in our  Disney rate. What a special song. I will be kind to Barry here. This should sound like a pastiche, but it doesn’t, because he’s actually trying. The juvenile approach to things is a bit patronizing, but all things considered I can’t really be mad at poor old Barry. It’s no We Didn’t Start the Fire, but whatever.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I don’t know what to think about this. This does not sound like it was made by a couple of dudes from Montreal. This sounds like somebody picked up some poor bloke from the English countryside during the War of the Roses by travelling and forced him to remember the happy days of his childhood joy by writing a song made for a patron saint’s festival. Even the video reflects this. I’m incredibly confused right now. Either way, it’s catchy, so i’m just going to give this an 8 and go home.

I was really rooting for this one. It was slowly climbing up the rate and peaked at #12 before it fell to where it is now. This song is like a proto-"Honey", combining a sweet hook, g-funk beat and Adina's cool and confident performance. Out of all the songs Todd introduced me to, this is my favorite.

**radiofan15** (4.5): Ava Max's *So Am I* if it was an 90s song

#BAD ROMANCE

**aulyve** (10): Absolutely snapped.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): thot anthem! virginheads is gonna rob this since it's sexual and also not by a white woman in a blonde wig
 
**elizakp** (10): This song is one of the sexiest in pop history
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Hadn't heard of this song before this rate but it's really stunning and really just like sexy wow amazing
 
**MrSwearword** (10): yaaaaaaaaaaaaas tame by today but "controversial" for 1992 realness
 
**realboxwood** (10): I love the grandiosity of the chorus, between the choir of harmonies and the “until the early morn”, it makes (freaking) sound like a glorious quest. Also at the end you can hear her start laughing in the background and any track where the singer breaks down laughing is an automatic 10, it’s one of my favorite tropes in music
 
**ryjomom** (10): Surprisingly catchy
 
**1998tweety** (9): This is pretty groovy, I like it
 
**letsallpoo** (9): TIL the sugababes song is a cover
 
**Osaka1268** (9): BOOM BOOM
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): It's like proto-Khia and I love it.
 
**Steelstepladder** (9): discovered this song through TiTS and it's been in my constant rotation since
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This g-funk synth and these vocals are ascending me to heaven
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): This is my kind of 90s RnB! Hooks as clear and as enticing as Mariah Carey’s music, but sensuality and frankness as attractive as Janet Jackson’s persona. It might be a forgotten little sister of many other odes to such general nastiness (please don’t laugh at me, I’m not legally allowed to type the s-word for another six months) but Freak Like Me has definitely had an influence on modern pop music hidden deep within its annals somewhere (yes, Ms. Fenty, I’m looking at you) and I adore it for the you-know-what positive anthem it is. I’ll just scoot on over back to church now.
 
**agentofscranton** (8.5): gag i didn't realize that the sugababes' version was a cover - the sugababes did it better teebs
 
**camerinian** (8.5): why this song hasn't had the same lifespan on any of TLC's songs is mystifying. This is fuckin slick
 
**feldya** (8.5): Um this is a jam.
 
**junobeekeeper** (8.5): This song is just good.
 
**RealRainbowinHeaven** (8.5): I think I might prefer the more grimey Sugababes’ version but the smooth West Coast combined with Adina’s sexual conviction is excellent
 
**enecks** (8): Freak really was a thing in the 90s huh
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda repetitve but a queen
 
**sbb618** (8): Didn't expect to like this at first, but by the end, I was unconsciously bobbing my head.

#AVA MAX'S DISCOGRAPHY
 
**skaiansightseer** (7): WEST COAST
 
**vapourlomo** (7): Solid G-funk, but I MUCH prefer the Sugababes' cover (which would be an easy 11)
 
**jolteonhoodie** (6): Sugababes did it better
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6): forgettable
 
**kappyko** (5): fine
 
**nicknac4** (1.5): the hell? This was a hit? Hit n' miss for me

#RIHANNA - RIGHT NOW.mp3
 
**elizakp** (10): LOVE
 
**vapourlomo** (10): Such an underrated pop-punk banger
 
**camerinian** (9): This is my favourite discovery from the series, and I totally would have been in to this in 2000 if I knew it existed (and I wasn't three years old lmao)
 
**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): A pop-punk band I now love but previously didn’t know about
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Oh wow this is a banger
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): I mean...I suppose it’s fine. Actually, I’m not going to lie, this is probably a great song by all objective standards. The problem here is entirely on my shoulders. I’m just not into punk pop rock, although, to be fair, the combination of those genres was way less artistically bankrupt to all the shit mainstream rock went through last decade. If you love Right Now, I can totally see why, so don’t worry. There’s a great, if slightly chauvinistic approach to love and romance here that’s pretty damn effective. The song’s just not for me.
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): Seven fake plastic submarines out of ten

#AKON - RIGHT NOW (NA NA NA).mp3 
 
**belfman** (6): one hell of an earworm
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): verses are forgetable but whew that chorus
 
**enecks** (5): Stream the best 1971 album, Hunky Dory
 
**MrSwearword** (5): great production, shit artist/lyrics
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): The chorus on this oh lordy why
 
**EverlongIsBestSong** (1): (I can't fucking stand this song)
 
**ryjomom** (1): wish i could’ve used a 0

I didn't know much about Divinyls before this rate (except they were big in Australia), but apparently their 1991 self-titled is considered their weakest album. If this is Divinyls running on fumes, then I gotta find out what they sounded like at their best. RIP Chrissy Amphlett.

**radiofan15** (7.6): Is this about masturbation? the lyrics are so subtle and subdued I can't really tell

#DANCING IN CIRCLES - LADY GAGA.mp3

**junobeekeeper** (11): MY QUEEN. I'm gonna be like "why didn't I give my 11 to lovefool" but I do feel like this song is my favorite in the main rate.
 
**wholahaybrown** (11): (I'm dedicating this 11 to Bai Ling.)
 
**camerinian** (10): nice thank I cumed pants
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): bitch me too! the fuck!
 
**enecks** (10): OwO staple
 
**MrSwearword** (10): also in the running for my eleven, but damn this song is so good and the video is legendary once you remember they filmed this video in a convent.
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): Everything about this song works so well
 
**feldya** (9.2): I always kind of laugh at the creepy intro chords that quickly transition into this joyous anthem about touching yourself.
 
**ManofOranges** (9): What a strange song to be a hit... but I definitely can relate to it
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): risqué
 
**ryjomom** (9): Sexxx Dreams Vibes
 
**vapourlomo** (9): Apologies to Dancing In Circles, but this will always be the ultimate desert-rock song about masterbation
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): The land down under has given us some incredible one-hit-wonders, and I Touch Myself is another welcome addition to such a grand collection. Love Myself and U + Ur Hand can kindly step aside; this is is that one great hymn of praise towards that act of doing it to oneself that I am not legally allowed to mention (gah, this isn’t even a good running joke) and something about Chrissy Amphlett’s voice makes it pop perfection. Heck, I might as well take the opportunity to say that I like this way more than She-Bop. I’ve never liked She-Bop. Sorry, Cyndi.
 
**nicknac4** (8.7): what a great anthem
 
**realboxwood** (8.5): In the outro the lead singer repeats the line, “I touch myself, I honestly do’” giving the impression that the person she’s singing to has called into doubt that fact, a very strange element to tack onto the end of this song
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): same tbh
 
**aulyve** (8): Pitchfork Voice The Divinyls' 'I Touch Myself' is a revolutionary ode to self-love and female sexuality in an industry pbbbt pfllbbtt pblllghbbbbbbbttttt
 
**moooo566** (8): same
 
**SpanKKy1** (8): me thinking about Tom Holland
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Hailee Steinfeld found dead
 
**waluigiest** (8): ....so your name is Robin Divinyls?
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This is a nice song, but it feels middle of the pack compared to everything else here.

#PARTY FOR ONE - CRJ.mp3
 
**hikkaru** (7): party for one
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): i mean I kinda expected more from a song with this title
 
**mars4mann** (7): invented sex positivity tho
 
**skaiansightseer** (7): it's fucked up but this is basically a less subtle mitski song
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): invented masturbation songs
 
**napsandnetflix** (6): relatable content
 
**LuckyKidA** (5): why pick this song when you could easily have picked What's Up? or Torn? *[Editor's note: BLAME TODD FOR THAT]*
