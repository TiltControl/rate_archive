My mom fucking loves this song, but for years I assumed it was an Enya or Sarah Mclachan track or something. I clicked on the episode, heard the chorus and was immediately like IT'S THAT BITCH. 

---

#We stan an ambigiously Gaelic queen

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): Her voice

**radiofan15** (9.2): Discount Enya snapped here

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This is the second new age song people doing this rate will ever hear in their entire lives, unless they’ve had the chance to bless their ears with Jig of Life. I do think Gaelic tradition sounds extraordinarily pretty, even if I haven’t had the chance to dive deep into it like I have with Anglo-Saxon culture, and the Mummer’s Dance is, while not fantastic, definitely a gorgeous song to hear. I don’t know if Loreena is the Canadian Enya, but she’s alright in my book!

**1998tweety** (8): Bops tbh

**enecks** (8): Stream The Mummy to revive the Dark Universe

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): As a ginger I feel obligated to give this a positive score

**Steelstepladder** (8): Just an interesting and fascinating song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Lindsey Stirling is shaking

**junobeekeeper** (7.2): My mom loves this lady.

#I prefer the safety dance

**ryjomom** (7): i think it would be an effective movie/tv song very unique hit

**camerinian** (5): damn the soccer moms were on some goofy shit in 97

**ImADudeDuh** (4): if this were kate bush, popheads would call this art

**MrSwearword** (4): Enya on acid should slay but it doesn't

Would it have been a hit without the video? Probably not. It's not like OK Go had any cred as an indie band: Pitchfork's combined score for their first 2 albums is 4.8.  But the video wouldn't have been gone viral without the song, either. Between this and "Get Over It", OK Go showed a knack for snotty breakup songs.

---

#Viral as in instant hit

**1998tweety** (10): So so iconic. In terms of actual quality, this is one of the better songs in the rate.

**bespectacIed** (10): Cheers to the OG viral music video.

**junobeekeeper** (10): I remember this video and it blew my mind. And the song slaps too.

**ManofOranges** (10): The video is the closest I'll get to a treadmill probably

**mars4mann** (10): also i really enjoy 2000s pop rock apparently

**MrSwearword** (10): Todd basically said everything about this song; it's a great song that so happened to become one of the earliest viral hits of the internet

**realboxwood** (10): Hello ladies, bottoms, and OK Go stans, where were you when Todd called OK Go “Imagine Dragons-y”

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Forget about BTS or Taylor Swift because OK Go are the original music video masters

**sbb618** (9.5): This is a surprisingly good song beyond the video!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): tbh even without factoring the video, its a p good song.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Todd’s video about Here It Goes Again was one of my favourites from him that I watched. This song has a legitimately fascinating place in the history of new digital media and video culture on the Internet, and even if OK Go’s just as much of a visual act as it is a musical one, their theatrics and music perfectly sync with each other; Here It Goes Again is just such a fun, bouncy pop rock track that it’s incredibly fit for silly antics that involve running around and doing dance moves on treadmills. I hope everybody else agrees with me, because I certainly see this as underrated!

**rosecoloreds** (8.5): iconic

**radiofan15** (8.2): I felt tired just watching this video

**camerinian** (8): I must have maxed out my parent's internet connection dozens of times in the mid-2000's watching this and the Move Your Feet video. Song - good, cost of slow internet for months on end - $100's, memories - priceless

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): I wish I could run on my treadmill let alone dance

**roxieloxie** (8): the writings on the wall outsold

**vapourlomo** (8): Video is better, yeah, but it's still got a great groove.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): pretty aight

**RetardedNinja35** (7.1): This and Lazy Sunday helped propel the growth of YouTube. Deserved more credit

**enecks** (7): Honestly don't like any of their videos. It's choreography without concept.

**napsandnetflix** (7): video only reason it got so big tbh but still iconic

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Better with the video, but we're not rating videos, sooooooo

**Steelstepladder** (7): pretty great but there's a lot of 00's indie rock I like much better than this

#Viral as in infectious disease

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): This song is perfectly fine, but tend to forget it when it’s not playing. The video is iconic though.

**Cherry\_Whine** (6): It’s all that video. Take away the four dorky guys on treadmills and you have a perfectly acceptable but pretty forgettable power-pop jam that’s kind of pretentious. Was that Surfer Rosa mention really necessary?

**Lagozzino** (5): It's really nothing without the video. I must have heard this song dozens of times and I can never remember how it actually goes.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.3): video saves this but just barely

**ryjomom** (4): sounds like something id hear in a record store owned by a white guy with long hair dyed black and some off beat rocker tee

Good shit. Chamillionaire and Krazyie Bone have this choppy flow which serves the lyrics well. Even Krazyie Bone kinda admitting that he actually was ridin dirty can't undermine it.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**enecks** (10): A very good hip hop song that deserves better than punchline status. Fast flows, hype beat. 2000s mainstream hip hop DID have some quality.

**ManofOranges** (10): Literally iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): thanks to the AV Club, this episode of OHW is how I even found out about Todd. That aside, this song is legendtinta.

**RetardedNinja35** (10): This song really stands out in 2006 when all the other rap songs were terrible snap music.

**ExtraEater** (10): Playstation controller

**roxieloxie** (10): I was gonna make a lugi joke but like ,,,, actually listening to the lyrics I wasn’t expecting like a /good/ song talking about police brutality and racism so I can appreciate that

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Story time. When I was 12 I lived with my uncle and my aunt – they were nice but kinda rude and terrible honestly. They lived on some old farm with like no animals and just a bunch of empty fields. One day, my uncle went to a market and returned with this filthy ass horse, saying it’s bred from some old bloke’s prize stallion. For whatever reason, my aunt loves the horse. She names him “Dirty” because he was a pretty muddy horse. However, for whatever reason, they did not want me to ride this horse. They said they would beat the shit out of me if they ever caught me doing that, and honestly, it’s happened in the past so I believed it. One day, however, I’m chilling outside playing around with some old tractor tire next to Dirty who is just eating grass and whatnot. My aunt and uncle are literally watching me to make sure I don’t get on the horse and I’m bored so I just climb inside this tire. However, the tire starts moving, as the field wasn’t flat. So, I can’t move and I’m just stuck inside this moving tire as my aunt and uncle watch. They see me rollin, they hatin, patrolling, trying to catch me ridin Dirty

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): iconic BOP

**aulyve** (9): I have a hunch this is going to underperform which is shame since it's a fucking incredible song. Put some respect on Chamillionaire this twenty nineteen.

**1998tweety** (8.5): The chorus is iconic and bops, verses slap too

**hikkaru** (8): kinda a bop lmfao

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the ending sketch, i-

**skargardin** (8): memes or no memes, it’s a GREAT song

**slimboyfriend** (8): I didn't know this was an entire song

**Steelstepladder** (8): When you turn this on it's impossible to not feel like a badass

**mars4mann** (7): this song reminds me of my dad teaching me how to drive

**skaiansightseer** (7): not the best Houston one hit wonder of the mid 2000s, but still GOES

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): why is it so long

**feldya** (5.5): This also reminds me of being awkward and being afraid to dance at homecoming so it's hard for me to rate higher :(

**kappyko** (3): The wobbly synth is GOD but it's too long

#You see me roll in, my Segway...

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): hosts are going to have a comment section for anyone who mentioned Weird Al here and you'll find me there sipping my tea

**radiofan15** (10): Bop and a HALF, Weird Al outsold him but Cham outsold us all at the end of the day...


**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): If it was White and Nerdy, it’d be a 10, thats all I’m saying

**letsallpoo** (9): weird al outsold a tad

**sbb618** (8.5): It's hard to resist rapping the lyrics to "White and Nerdy" while listening to this.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): A rap song that is still underappreciated by everyone except for Weird Al.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): If you guys don’t play White and Nerdy in this rate I’m suing

**vapourlomo** (7): THEY SEE ME MOWING MY FRONT LAWN

**ryjomom** (6): White and Nerdy

**junobeekeeper** (3.7): It just doesn't live up to the Weird Al song

#40%

**realboxwood** (10): That hook is legendary fuck the police

**camerinian** (9): ACAB

**Osaka1268** (9): fuck cops

**waluigiest** (8): this song about racialized policing is hidden behind this stupid chorus I’m so mad

**yourhostandpatron** (8): My neighbours play this all the time, and I’ve only recognized it as the song Weird Al made fun of now, like pretty much everybody else does in 2019, but now that I’ve listened to it for the first time, I can say that it’s actually kind of legit? Well, it’s a weird mix of being a stereotypical 00s rap song about partying and being a protest against racial profiling and police brutality, which...oh. Oh my God. This is Swimming Pools but for the 00s. Holy shit. Chamillionaire made Swimming Pools before Kendrick even did. I have no idea what to do with this revelation. ...uh, anyway, this bangs, so go stream?

#Wait what?

**nicknac4** (0): This song makes me smell, taste, hear, and see CRJ when she is at her worst

One of many songs that seemed like they were gonna be top 10 before cratering out of Day 3. I'm extremely torn between "this song kicks ass" and "the quotation marks around this song are way too big", but I can't argue if you think this is the most awesome track you've ever heard.

---

#GUITAR!

**Lagozzino** (11): I will ride into hell on a winged pegasus to save the love of my life from the demon hordes while this song blasts down from the heavens and I will be victorious because I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE

**skaiansightseer** (11): The last and best rock song ever written

**agentofscranton** (10): miss thing hitting that falsetto remains one of the most iconic music moments ever. periodt.

**camerinian** (10): ugh I really wanted this to be my 11 but I have a bad feeling y’all are gonna disrespect this so I’ll save it for a song with a chance. Anyways, this is literally the first song that jumps to my head when someone says ‘rock music’. It’s energetic, it’s got shred for days, it’s got a ridiculous over the top flair and its head is so deeply planted inside its own ass that there is no way in hell you can’t enjoy every moment of it. This is as shameless a throwback song there is, and I love every glorious, cheesy second. I want to adopt this song and raise it as my own, so that it one day may grow to impregnate the world with its raging rockstar dick

**enecks** (10): Ooh, 00's cornyness instead of 80s. But this slaps and is joyous. This is what Ninja Sex Party wishes it was.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Campy classic

**napsandnetflix** (10): lowkey you're dead to me if you give this less than like a 7

**realboxwood** (10): Well I love to have fun

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The rest of The Drakness's discorgraphy is very good if you enjoy /r/music type music (which this song totally is)

**Steelstepladder** (10): Between this and A-Ha, in the battle of high notes, I actually prefer this

**vapourlomo** (10): I know y'all will underrate this because it's not pop, but my man is hitting Mariah Carey notes over here. Show respect.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): oh wow i LOVE when male singers do fun shit with their vocals

**RetardedNinja35** (9.6): How did this become a hit in 2003. The only other artist that got a hit whilst sounding like a throwback is Bruno Mars.

**aulyve** (9): Has no business being this fun but what can ya do.

**feldya** (9): Ripping guitar solos, singing that harkens back to glam rock, and a crazy music video where the band battles aliens - I love this song.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Fuck, fuck, why am I giving a metal band called the fucking Darkness one of the highest scores in this rate?! I’m losing my gay credentials! Alright. Sorry, y’all. I have no doubt some of you will think this is lame dad rock, and it is, but this is just awesome. The way the lead singer delivers this with such theatrical presence...and he hasn’t been accused of anything bad, too! Holy shit! This is the best song of all time! If all you homos tank this I will undergo conversion therapy. Goodbye.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): They opened for Lady Gaga once, so don't y'all trash this song!!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Sometimes this song is great, other times I just wonder why this singer decided to do weird vocals

**kioescport** (8): It's certainly not the best song in this rate, but it is almost assuredly the best song to karoake in an intoxicated state at 4am. Which has to count for something as well.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): pretty aight

**1998tweety** (7.5): The vocals are a bit weird and I'm not sure if they're the best fit, but at least the instrumentals slap.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): MIKA is that you

#nihilists

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): I can’t be the only person who thought that this was Steve Coogan’s band

Cameo is not a one hit wonder. Strike that, they may a one hit wonder, but that one hit depends on whether you're white or black. And ~~it's an objective fact that~~ in my opinion, "Candy" is the better track, but this still goes pretty hard. Some people were turned off by Larry Blackmon's human bedspring of a voice, which is both a fair opinion and completely wrong.

---

**1998tweety** (10): A huge huge 10, Little Mix's version slaps but so does this.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Shout out to Wordgirl (also Candy outpeaked)

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): Perfect weird 80s cheese never let it end

**ManofOranges** (10): this is a hit

**MrSwearword** (10): Candy is their best song and GTA San Andreas fans can back me up on this, but this song is fucking awesome. Pro tip; listen to Mel B/Scary Spice's version at your own discretion

**roxieloxie** (10): why the fuck aren’t we rating candy , this is racism

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): I'll be honest I thought this was an original Little Mix song

**Steelstepladder** (8): I like funk a lot

**camerinian** (7.5): insert codpiece comment here

**RetardedNinja35** (6.3): What is up with that voice?

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Apparently this has gotten a cult fandom as a song for some reason, but it’s really hard for me to see why. Granted, I can look deep into it and see a pretty solid 80s funk song that deserves at least a tiny bit of acclaim, but that’s if I can ignore the singer’s voice. The singer’s voice is awful, people. It’s not even that raspy kind of awful that dominated the 80s. It sounds like he’s croaking this shit out. It ruins Word Up for me. I hate it.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I swear I hear them say "Bird Up", but that just might be Eric Andre poisoning my mind

This is a more bizarre track than people give it credit for. It's a dance song that feels wrong to dance to at a club. It's an excercise song in the sense that running for your life counts as exercising. It's just a unique track in the history of pop music, and as fun as the Automatic Man video is, I can't say that about Sembello's other work.

---

#dancing like they've never danced before

**camerinian** (10): This is a slammin track in its own right but also my partner did her pole dance routine to this song so uhhhhhh I may be a bit biased

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): A title more apt couldn’t be possible. It really does sound like a frenzied, slight madness-induced fever dream of jumping synths and spooky wailing background vocals. Perfect for you Halloween or workout playlist.

**enecks** (10): This drives me feral, which is appropriate. Carpenter Brut has a killer cover of this.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A big and iconic bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Such a fucking creepy song, it works so well. I love it so much.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): WOOO JUMP ROPE

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just so 80s but that just means that it's iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): a song originally inspired by murder, then reworked into a song for a fucking 80s dance movie. Nothing in the world ever makes sense, y'all

**radiofan15** (10): Flashdance the movie sucks ass but the soundtrack slaps... truly the Glee of its time

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The production on this had NO RIGHT to be as hard as it is

**vapourlomo** (10): Footloose is the better movie, but Flashdance had the better music. (although I prefer the title track)

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): one of the greatest soundtrack moments tbh

**1998tweety** (9): I feel like I misremembered this song having a bit more of a kick? Or maybe I'm thinking of something else. This is still good though.

**drfranck** (9): One of the first movie soundtracks I've ever heard, and one of my favourite of all time

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (9): Go see the movie it’s based on, it’s disturbingly fascinating

**Steelstepladder** (9): Underrated guitar solo

**waluigiest** (9): fast dancing!!!

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Ah, its Sweet But Psycho, but for the 70s, or was it the 80s? Actually, this seems similar to Physical by Olivia Newton John, as well. I think I would have seen this as even more if a classic if it was sung by somebody more memorable than Michael Sembello, but he does a pretty great enough job and the song becomes quite the bop in the process. I don’t actually know what a Footloose is, though. Guys, what’s a Footloose?

**rosecoloreds** (8.5): bop

**RetardedNinja35** (8.3): There aren’t many good ominous-sounding pop songs but Michael Sembello pulled it off.

#kill me

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): pretty aight

**junobeekeeper** (7.3): I like it but I can't find much to say about it.

**aulyve** (7): (Lucille Bluth GIF) Good for her!

**realboxwood** (7): He sings the first chorus so dispassionately, then spends the rest of the song trying way too hard to make up for it. Love that guitar solo though

**ryjomom** (7): what the spectators say after my 10th vodka soda on a thursday night

**tapdancingpig** (7): Creepy bop.

There's a line in the song I think gets misconstruted. *"Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding, the cretins cloning and feeding, and I don't even own a TV"*. At first glance, that line hits you with the overpowering stench of an unwashed Rick & Morty tshirt. But the tossed-off "and I don't even own a TV" is the key line here, because it has nothing to do with the previous lines except that they're all things obnoxiously smug people would say in the 90s. Which is the joke. He's not only too cool for the masses, he's too cool for people who think they're too cool for the masses. Actually, that's still kind of obnoxious. Forget I said anything.

---

#I can't think of a section name so here are the good reviews

**atlastata** (11): MY LEGS! GOD DAMN YOU!

**jolteonhoodie** (11): I literally heard this song for the first time when Todd released his video and it's my 11, go figure

**sbb618** (11): There's just something about Flagpole Sitta. I can't exactly point to what it is. The music's great, the lyrics are great, the attitude is great, but there's something more that pushes it up to 11.

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): This sounds like a one-hit-wonder. That’s not a bad thing. It seems like this whole band realized this was going to be their only hit so poured all their heart and soul into this one bombastic, witty song that will outlive anything else they have written by many, many years.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): I get this band mixed up with Harvey Birdman

**junobeekeeper** (10): Yeehaw

**realboxwood** (10): I bought this song and listened to it on my Kindle Fire when I was 13 in 2011, before I had any clue about context or where or when most of the music I picked up originally came from. Good times good times

**Steelstepladder** (10): remember when rock music sounded like rock music? I miss those days

**vapourlomo** (10): As a local, I have to give every WA band at least an 8. And because this is the last grunge classic, Flagpole Sitta easily earns those extra two points.

**elizakp** (9.5): Half a point knocked off for being too pretentious, otherwise a bop

**aulyve** (8): Human brain says this is a thoughtful song with some insightful lyrics, monkey brain is screaming Peep Show quotes at me, both are valid.

**rosecoloreds** (8): anyone who gave this a score lower than 7 clearly had friends in high school and haven't seen peep show and it shows (btw watch peep show it's such a great show)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I don’t know if I’ve ever heard someone say the title of this song but it is dope

**camerinian** (7.5): It’s a good thing that hook is amazing and that there’s so much energy in the band’s playing, cos otherwise this would be the musical equivalent of dismissive wanking gesture

#and here are the bad ones

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Hmm, yeah, I expected this to be pretty awesome based on what a badass name Harvey Danger is, but I’m not such a big fan of it as I hoped I would have. I’m not really into whatever kind of rock this is (is it grunge? Is it post-grunge? I have no clue, I’m too sleepy) and the lack of an easily likeable melody here is enough to turn me away from fully enjoying this song. You’ll like it if you’re into this sort of music, though. It’s pretty well done, but, alas, like a handful of other songs in this rate, it is just not for me.

**RetardedNinja35** (6.7): First heard this in American Pie. The films are pretty average but I liked the soundtracks

**1998tweety** (6.5): Not a huge fan of the vocals, but I commend the song for telling a story throughout the entire song.

**radiofan15** (6.5): How was this one a hit?

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I can hear why this song was popular and also why nobody listened to them afterward.

**enecks** (6): It exists

**letsallpoo** (5): apparently this is on the scooby 2 movie soundtrack?

**MrSwearword** (5): for ambition but he wasn't talented enough to pull off catchy beat with fucked up lyrics

**roxieloxie** (5): Green Day did it better

**ryjomom** (5): teenagers must’ve loved this...

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): meh

**ImADudeDuh** (4): if reddit became a song

**rslashpoopheads** (4): bleh

THE New Wave song. THE one hit wonder. The song that's famous precisely because the band itself is not. Stream Space Age Love Song.

---

#runawaywithme.mp3

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the sYNTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**kioescport** (10): There's 3 perfect 80s songs in this rate, this falls short of Take on Me and Come on Eileen because honestly, a Flock of Seagulls had better songs than this. Doesn't take away the magic, but when Space Age Love Song exists I think this just falls a little bit behind.

**realboxwood** (10): Honestly EVERY song should maybe be about aliens

**rotating3Dtext** (10): ALIENS

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I feel like the single version of this cuts out a decent amount of the intro to this song, which is unfortunate. The build up, of the super 80s synths sounds so awesome. The lyrics, especiallly the chorus, are fairly simple, but it highlights the 80s synthpop excellence that makes this song so good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I’ve literally never heard this intro before but what the fuck it adds like another layer of hype to this classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): new wave goodness! that guitar work is such a vibe

**radiofan15** (9.5): Obligatory Julius reference from Pulp Fiction

**enecks** (9): Iconic, love that hairdo

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (9): Slaps, simmering and smoky guitar make the song about a very unique topic

**ryjomom** (9): This song was lost somewhere in my brain and I’m glad that popheads reintroduced me to it.

**skaiansightseer** (9): Excessive and stylish-- iconic new wave

**Steelstepladder** (9): Really love it. Not their best song though

**vapourlomo** (9): I think I prefer Photograph, but this is a new wave classic for a good reason!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): can we just talk about this album cover

**sbb618** (8.5): Loved its use in La La Land

**jolteonhoodie** (8): I love how the camera is totally visible in the mirror in the video and they didn't even remotely try to hide it, but they did cover the tripod in al foil to make it look spacey and futuristic

**LuckyKidA** (8): not their best song

**mars4mann** (8): ps we shouldn't go to war with Iran

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I’m not sure what to write for this comment, because this is basically just an inferior, if still technically solid version of Take On Me that just has a really weird, spacey, Ziggy Stardust aesthetic that a mysteriously low amount of people remember. You think that would have gotten A Flock of Seagulls more attention. (I love that band name, by the way. Wish a band with the moniker that amazing would have been more successful.) I do like the song, so there’s that, I suppose. It’s just been done even better.

#runawayfromme.mp3

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): Impossible Quiz 2 players wya?

**rslashpoopheads** (7): repetitive bop

**junobeekeeper** (6.8): Can't believe the general public let this become the big hit everybody knows instead of Space Age Love Song

**1998tweety** (6): This feels like background music, it takes too long to get to the point.

**aulyve** (5): Unexceptional new wave which means that it's going to slaughter this rate.

**MrSwearword** (5): I don't particularly care or have use for it much.

**nicknac4** (5): I got pretty bored of it and I looked and it wasn't halfway over, but it was enjoyable when I was paying attention

**camerinian** (4): Honestly this has to be one of the most overrated songs of the 80's. The melody line is kinda flat and the lyrics and delivery lack that vibrancy and quirkiness that made the best songs of the 80's great.

**kappyko** (2): for the record it's pronounced "ee-rawn"

The Butthole Surfers are a band that's easy to respect but hard to like. If you told me that they have a ton of great deep cuts worth getting into, I'd believe you, but they don't do much for me.

#cinnamon and sugar

**enecks** (10): Stream butthole pictures on Grindr

**junobeekeeper** (10): I used to say Butthole Surfers was my favorite band, partially to shock people but also bc I just like weird stuff! This song is a jam and I wish it was in the real rate bc it might have gotten my 11!

**radiofan15** (10): How this Loser-esque song was a hit I'm not sure but I'm not complaining

**Steelstepladder** (10): Would be my eleven if part of the main rate

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): I need that guitar loop STAT.

**vapourlomo** (9): Shockingly catchy for a weirdo song about suicidal Texas teenagers

**sbb618** (8.5): It's like Loser, but weirder and with less of a chorus

**camerinian** (8): I too would like to know what happened to the football player rapist.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): lowkey bops a bit. idk I just like the deadpan delivery

#stream Loser

**rslashpoopheads** (7): ok

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Oh, jeez, I almost skipped over giving this song a comment. How rude of me. So, anyway, the Butthole Surfers are legitimately an awful name for a band, but I really like elements of the song. The word salad lyrics and the soft sing-talking would be enough to get me on an average day, and I find it pretty cool that something like this could have been a hit. Unfortunately, other parts of the song don’t captivate me as much, and the cover art I saw on Spotify when I listened to Pepper was incredibly horrid, so the band is getting a 7 from me as a nice, if slightly unremarkable score. Sad!

**1998tweety** (6): Slaps a bit but that artist name is a sin

#RIP Pete Burns

**waluigiest** (11): I was introduced to this song by a Naruto AMV and I think it turned me gay


**camerinian** (10): A karaoke classic for life right here tbh

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): If a song ever deserved the recognition of actually making it feel like your head is spinning, this is the one that qualifies. That keyboard riff really does rotate around your head while you’re listening. It’s a woozy, glittering daydream of song that Pete Burns sells with every drop of charisma he’s got.

**Steelstepladder** (9): Genuinely love it. I've given out too many tens already though

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Woah, I’m really liking everything in this rate that’s new wave, or at least adjacent to it. I’ve heard of You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) before, and I’ve never bothered to heard it, but, holy cow, what a terrific burst of musical energy! It’s 80s songs like these that continue the artistic revolution of the 70s and prove that all pop is chronological in nature. I’m sad to hear Pete Burns has passed away a few years ago, though. Honestly, the amount of people Todd’s done One Hit Wonderland videos on who’ve passed away since is not surprising, but that amount is sad.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): dis some gay shit

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): Chipmunks did it better

**napsandnetflix** (8): flo rida did it better

#oh god i'm dizzy

**Lagozzino** (6): I like this song better when it's covered by pretty much anyone else. Pete's vocal delivery gets old real fast.

**tapdancingpig** (6): Cut the first minute and remove some of the excessive stems and this song is an easy 8, possibly higher.

**CarlieScion** (5): images of trinity the tucks aging boobs keeps coming into my mind listening to this

**kioescport** (5): Not all ancient 80s relics nessecarily deserve to be remembered.

**ryjomom** (4): Honestly grown old of this song

**skargardin** (4): iconic but i just.. no, this is a mess

**mars4mann** (3): this was my grandma's ringtone for the coworker she was having an affair with

**nicknac4** (1.3): When I hear this song I get flashbacks to that meatspin website :(

#people who've accidentally called the song "You Spin Me Right Round"

**ManofOranges** (10): Flo Rida really tried it huh

**radiofan15** (10): Is it OK to say that Kesha outsold?

**sbb618** (9): A little repetitive, but catchy as hell. I keep fighting the instinct to sing "When you go down, when you go down now" in the chorus.

**SpanKKy1** (10): ke$ha did it better

**1998tweety** (10): The Flo Rida version is very good, but this equally good tbh.

**ExtraEater** (10): Just as much of a classic as the Flo Rida version. Also, meatspin.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Something something Flo Rida and Kesha

**hikkaru** (6.5): where's kesha

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): flo rida did it better

**bespectacIed** (4): feat. Ke$ha

Nicki, quotable lines, body acceptance, giant ass platform, etc. This was in serious danger of falling out of the top 20 before a last-minute surge sent it up here.

---

#butt connesseurs

**letsallpoo** (11): a gay anthem

**vapourlomo** (11): The most quotable rap song...ever? Literally every line is a gem. We stan for Seattle legends.

**1998tweety** (10): I feel basic making a comment referencing Anaconda, but it was the first thing I thought of when I heard this. Growing up, a lot of guys I knew would sing this song religiously a lot and it annoyed me tbh, but now it bops a bit.

**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): Every single line from this song is legendary. Plus, body positivity!

**enecks** (10): I did go on a lengthy rant about this song earlier, so a 10 out of obligation. Is it swapping one form of objectification for another? Yes. Is it catchy and well produced? Yes. Did it improve the world? Yes. Fuck We Are The World, this is the defining charity single of the 20th Century - giving support to big butts. Shakespeare would be proud to have written this.

**ExtraEater** (10): Essential part of general culture

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Iconic, ending fat shaming, we stan the biggest feminist icon of our generation

**ManofOranges** (10): I love you Nicki, but I listen to Sir Mix-a-Lot

**MrSwearword** (10): also a contender for the eleven. One of the best rap songs in the herstory of recorded music. Nicki Minaj will burn in hell for trying to tarnish this glorious song.

**realboxwood** (10): On this track, renowned feminist theorist Sir Mix-a-Lot presents his excellent if problematic dissertation on the intersection between body shaming, sex and gender relations, and racialized standards of beauty

**sbb618** (10): Perfectly straddles the line between "super cheesy song" and "actually catchy song"

**skargardin** (10): the iconic bops just keep on coming huh

**Steelstepladder** (10): I couldn't find it in my heart to give this less than a ten

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Truly ahead of his time with the ass worship

**nicknac4** (9.8): iconic lyrics. This is what I dance to when I am straight out of the shower

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): maybe misogyny slaps sometimes

**waluigiest** (9): do not @ me

**radiofan15** (8.7): Obligatory Nicki Minaj Comment... also that intro outsold #Selfie by The Chainsmokers

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): invented Nicki Minaj

**camerinian** (8): Can we just get a shout out for having this many quotable lines in one song? There aren’t many rap songs that can attest the sheer number of memorable bars as this track, and I’m glad that’s the only thing worth discussing about this song and we can all objectively agree on that

**kappyko** (8): Anti-racism anthem

**SpanKKy1** (8): nicki outalented

**tapdancingpig** (8): Iconic as fuck.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): You know, Todd is right. You could say a lot about Sir Mix-A-Lot’s career in the context of early 90s hip hop, and whether Baby Got Back is a song that objectifies black women, empowers them, or both, but none of that will ever disregard the fact that the song is so ridiculous it actually works. I used to be the kind of person who would never enjoy a guy standing on a large, giant ass with backup dancers shaking their own butts around him while he raps, and it’s not like I’m actually listening to Baby Got Back with glee now, but this song is really too much of a cultural moment for me to do anything but go along with whatever Sir Mix-A-Lot was trying to do. I guess that’s why Nicki sampled it. Huh. Anyway, I actually think this is a fascinating study of beauty standards and rap within the specific time period was released in, so it gets my respect for that.

**RetardedNinja35** (7.2): So many guys sang this in my first year of high school (Year 8 in Australia)

#Beckies

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): This actually kinda bumps.

**rosecoloreds** (7): invented ass

**skaiansightseer** (7): this is afrofuturist body positivity

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): Nicki outsold

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I'm guessing 80% of the comments will be about Nicki

**aulyve** (6): I was gonna say thank God this wasn't made today but then I remembered the curvy wife guy literally just released a single so actually God is dead and we killed him. Anyway this beat knocks.

**hikkaru** (6): anaconda >

**kioescport** (5): I really don't know how to feel about this.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Honestly do not thing this has aged well. Still iconic tho

**junobeekeeper** (4): I have various issues with this song but the Full Metal Jacket sample is the first big mood killer for me.

**ryjomom** (4): the intro and chorus are the only redeeming qualities

**feldya** (3): I get why people like this song, and yea it's catchy and I like butts but it just reminds me of every typical wedding DJ and for that I hate it.

Thank you /u/yourhostandpatron for writing thoughtful takes because it means I don't have to.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Many, many songs in this rate stick out as ones obviously made in the era they come out in, and Walking In Memphis does nothing to buck that trend. It’s one of the last big singer-songwriter smashes, and I can just imagine hearing it on crossover radio as I type this up. There’s a nostalgia here that wouldn’t sound as potent today, even past matters of genre. This is fine, but I don’t think I’ll ever think of it if I ever step foot in Memphis. Also, the Best New Artist curse was around way back in the 90s? Huh...

---

**1998tweety** (10): This song feels like a journey

**ManofOranges** (10): I love this song so much

**camerinian** (9): gotta be honest, when he hits that “MA’AM I AM TONIGHT” I get shivers. Shit’s real.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a sweet song

**rslashpoopheads** (9): this bonus rate is too long

**enecks** (8): Stream Pokemon Go to endorse walking

**Steelstepladder** (8): It's pretty. It's really pretty.

**RetardedNinja35** (7.8): Good song but it’s basically just a tourism ad for Memphis, like Empire State of Mind was for New York.

**sbb618** (7.5): Probably in my top 3 songs about going to Graceland and not knowing why


**radiofan15** (7.1): Cher... well, she obviously didn't outsold but definitely outskinnied

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Walking in popheads

**ryjomom** (5): i don’t know how to describe what i’m feeling during this song, i mean it’s cool

Imagine making a song so iconic that it ruined an existential question until the end of time. My one (1) complaint is that the rest of the song doesn't live up to those opening organ chords.

---


**agentofscranton** (10): i already know this will be robbed because y'all are a bunch of losers who've never heard this absolutely go OFF in the club - let alone the fact that this is like the peak of the eurodance sound

**belfman** (10): love me some europop

**bespectacIed** (10): House music, by a black person? Yes please.

**enecks** (10): Catchy, and I love this era of euro techno despite it being panned. Thematically ambitious, pretentious as well. But that doesn't matter - the beat does.

**ExtraEater** (10): Timeless

**Lagozzino** (10): Anyone who listened to this and didn't get up to dance for even a second is possessed by a demon and needs an immediate exorcism.

**ManofOranges** (10): Really good dance track. Sometimes I find my self averse to repetitiveness in songs but this song just sounds so good and it's so catchy that it doesn't matter

**MrSwearword** (10): soooo close to eleven status as well but if 90s house/club music had to have a spokesperson for the one hit wonderkind, it has to be this one.


**rotating3Dtext** (10): this song slaps I don’t give a fuck.

**roxieloxie** (10): BABEY DONT HURT ME

**skargardin** (10): if this isn’t top five at the very least then something’s very wrong with y’alls taste

**tapdancingpig** (10): DON’T HURT ME! DON’T HURT ME! NO MORE!

**nicknac4** (9.3): TOO GOOD

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): better than TWICE

**radiofan15** (9): Back on the day, there was a meme with this song as sung by rage comics characters, with Forever Alone singing the "no more" portion... I thought it was clever back then but I don't know what to think anymore

**ryjomom** (9): gay club anthem (literally the playlist this song is under on my Spotify)


**camerinian** (8.5): this is basically the only eurodance song on the list that you can put in a modern club mix and not cause supernova levels of cringe so fkn good work there


**ImADudeDuh** (8): just google it

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): Love can be defined as BABYDONTHURTME

**vapourlomo** (8): bounces head approvingly

#no more

**waluigiest** (7): rightfully iconic but not something I want to listen to very often

**Steelstepladder** (6): it's fine, but I respect it more than I like it

**junobeekeeper** (5.8): This song will always be a joke to me

**kappyko** (3): This chorus doesn't make sense in context

#maymays



**1998tweety** (10): A song that despite getting memed, is still very very good.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bops head


**realboxwood** (10): Does Haddaway know what he’s done for us, like, as a society


**yourhostandpatron** (9): Hot damn, I remember this being a meme back in 2012! I used to spam it on a Pokemon forum when I was a kid. I was also a complete poser, because I didn’t know how the song actually went. I just sent the link to the Youtube video over and over. Haha...past the memes, this is honestly a really good Eurodance track, though. Haddaway has a great voice, and the house influences here are pretty stunning.


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Not even gonna drop a meme here, this song slaps

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): legendary meme, but also a great song in its own right

**sbb618** (9.5): (bobs head)

**hikkaru** (8.5): too bad this was memed to death it's a boppie

First of all I must congratulate popheads for having the restraint to not post *that* performance. You know the one. I will never be drunk enough to appreciate the rest of their discography, but this track, holy shit. It is the 80s Run Away With Me. It is more romantic than any band in the New Romantic genre.

#I COULD HUM THIS TUNE FOREVER

**belfman** (11): one of the most original, unique and touching songs in pop history.

**camerinian** (11): how could you not love every single part of this??? This song is an instant mood booster on a shitty day, and every part of it seems chemically engineered to put the biggest god damned smile on my face every time. Sure the lyrics are indecipherable, but do you really need them? Those strings are polished to a mirror sheen, and with that pounding bassline and those glimmering keys, the shouting over the song becomes deeply infectious and radiates positivity and bug-eyed hopefulness, and that’s before you get to that incredible bridge which is the apex of the pub sing a long, and the way it ramps up in to the final chorus is an unbelievable explosion of joy. If you don’t like this song, I seriously have to wonder what went wrong in your life to end up this way

**elizakp** (11): I love this song more than life

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Iconic in every sense of the word, if you don't know this song, you are uncultured truly.

**kioescport** (11): It was between this and Groove is in the Heart for the 11, Come on Eileen ended up winning out simply because it has an enigma none of the songs in this rate can match. It's just such a strange oddity, the fact that this was even a hit at all is somewhat mystifying. Come on Eileen just seems like one of those songs that was destined to be forgotten until a bunch of people on Rateyourmusic suddenly refound it again in the late 2000s. I'm so glad it's legacy is far more than that.

**LuckyKidA** (11): i think we take for granted how a song like this--this unique and this catchy and this amazing--actually got made and became popular, it's a peculiar modern wonder

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (11): The biggest inspiration for Playboi Carti’s verse on Earfquake, joking aside this is perfect

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): I could listen to this song a thousand times and never get tired of it. Everything about it is magical, from the violin intro to that plucking banjo to the high-pitched delivery to that irresistible bridge where it slows down and slowly begins to speed up. A timeless classic that will outlive all of us.

**enecks** (10): A close second for my 11, this song is joyous, well-constructed, and a populist crowd pleaser. It puts smiles on faces.

**ManofOranges** (10): Really anthemic I can't resist singing to this song whenever I hear it

**napsandnetflix** (10): eleven worthy anyone who gives this less than a 9 is dead to me

**rslashpoopheads** (10): if you're gonna be a one hit wonder you may as well make it a classic, right?

**skargardin** (10): S L A Y

**SpanKKy1** (10): i think this is a universal white people anthem

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The slow build up at the climax of this song is one ting that makes this an all time classic.

**Steelstepladder** (10): White people give this song your strength!!!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I’ve never heard this song with headphones before and let me tell you the instrumentation on this is far underrated what the fuck Matt and Kim owe their entire careers to this song

**vapourlomo** (10): God I love Kevin Rowland's weird, whiny voice so much. Such a hopeful, fun jam

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love the part where it goes from slow to fast to the chorus

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9.5): This is my dad and I’s song in the car. Hardcore jam

**sbb618** (9.5): I'm a sucker for a slow down/speed up in the bridge

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): im eileen

**aulyve** (9): Part of me wants to dislike this song for some reason but it really is that bitch.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This is a really cool song, and I’m ashamed for being unable to get into it just because of the parts where the guy starts to sing out some nonsense syllables. I love how it mixes traditional British folk sounds with new wave (that’s pretty much the least 80s a lot of this rate is getting) and I find it to be an odd happy spot in British culture during the mess that said decade was. What a great musical artifact.

**nicknac4** (8.3): it's good but not THAT good

**CarlieScion** (8): would be a 10 if it didnt have the weird outro

**realboxwood** (8): The lead singer sounds like he just got his wisdom teeth removed but this still slaps

**skaiansightseer** (8): dance as folksy cosplay

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song makes me think of math class. Believe it or not, suffering through math with with 20 other honors students while the teacher plays old music is a really positive experience.

**waluigiest** (8): this is incoherent….. but I am still Perks of Being a Wallflower trash

**junobeekeeper** (7.2): I have an old seven inch single of this song, but no means to play it

#well that's your opinion I guess

**MrSwearword** (7): fine for what it is but the best thing you can say about this is that it's not the bastardized version called "Come on England".

**1998tweety** (6): Not a fan of the singing on this, no idea what is being said. Nothing else in the song entices me besides the chorus

**radiofan15** (4.3): If it wasn't for the annoying performance on the verses and the jarring transition to the fantastic chorus, this would be way higher

**agentofscranton** (2): miss ireland deserved better

**wholahaybrown** (0): (I've borne witness to too many rowdy frat boy singalongs to this one I'm afraid!)

**aulyve** (11): I was fully prepared to put this on blast but when you ignore the culture baggage it's actually kind of brilliant and poetic so. It's my 11.

**camerinian** (10): If you have never been shit-blisteringly drunk while you shred your voice on that chorus, pitch or melody be damned, then I truly and deeply pity you

**CarlieScion** (10): my second choice for my 11


**ExtraEater** (10): NEVER


**MrSwearword** (10): pissin' the night away never sounded so fucking good

**napsandnetflix** (10): eleven worthy

**realboxwood** (10): One time I had to study for a test and I literally played this song on repeat for an hour straight. Anyways listen to Neil Cicierega’s iconic remix, appropriately titled “Piss”, that mashes it up with Semi-Charmed Life

**rslashpoopheads** (10): ok I might actually give this my 11


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This band and this song literally looks like a keyboard smash

**vapourlomo** (10): Basically the last great Britpop song

**1998tweety** (9.5): I have no idea what they're saying half the time but this chorus slaps and it's extremely iconic

**bespectacIed** (9): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic

**elizakp** (9): One of the best songs to sing at the top of your lungs at a party

**skargardin** (9): yas

**TulipWaffles** (9): Fun fact, I was listening to this song the first time I got in a car accident. It's honestly not a bad song to get rear-ended to.



**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Inspirational


**SpanKKy1** (8): i had no idea it was called this

**tapdancingpig** (8): If we were rating episodes, this would be my 11 easily. But I still like this weirdass song.


**RealRainbowinHeaven** (7.5): In my head this should be a 10 but when I actually listen to it, I’m reminded it’s significantly more boring than I like to imagine

**feldya** (7.4): Hell yea give me that trumpet bridge again. A fun shout-along song.

**jolteonhoodie** (7.3): I should find this a lot more annoying than I do


**ImADudeDuh** (7): two songs that just don't end in a row wtf

**Steelstepladder** (7): I like it. Good stuff.

#woo?

**ryjomom** (6): Leave this in the 90s

**waluigiest** (6): I want to like it I really do :/

**nicknac4** (5.5): nice pump up song

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): I always forget about that weird outro

**slimboyfriend** (4): Pubs just aren't for me :/

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.6): it gets scored down it better not get scored up again this score better keep it down

**roxieloxie** (1): I’m crying what the fuck isn’t happening here

#/r/popheads talks politics

**enecks** (10): Anarchist icons, we stan

**junobeekeeper** (10): We love anarchism and good times!

**sbb618** (10): I'm sad that Chumbawumba never replicated this success on their subsequent albums, such as The Boy Bands Have Won, and All the Copyists and the Tribute Bands and the TV Talent Show Producers Have Won, If We Allow Our Culture to Be Shaped by Mimicry, Whether from Lack of Ideas or from Exaggerated Respect. You Should Never Try to Freeze Culture. What You Can Do Is Recycle That Culture. Take Your Older Brother's Hand-Me-Down Jacket and Re-Style It, Re-Fashion It to the Point Where It Becomes Your Own. But Don't Just Regurgitate Creative History, or Hold Art and Music and Literature as Fixed, Untouchable and Kept Under Glass. The People Who Try to 'Guard' Any Particular Form of Music Are, Like the Copyists and Manufactured Bands, Doing It the Worst Disservice, Because the Only Thing That You Can Do to Music That Will Damage It Is Not Change It, Not Make It Your Own. Because Then It Dies, Then It's Over, Then It's Done, and the Boy Bands Have Won. I guess that's how it goes.

**skaiansightseer** (10): [HAMMER AND SICKLE GOES HERE]

**radiofan15** (9): It takes balls for an anarchist group to sign with a major label and release a pop song while still keeping some semblance of their original purpose...

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): viva la revolucion

**Osaka1268** (8): Anarchist Icons

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Really? A band named Chumbawuma was the face of radical British leftist scenes decades before Olly Thorn blessed us with his glorious philosophical knowledge? ...you know what? I’ll take it. From everything I’ve read about Tubthumping it’s such a gloriously bizarre event in pop music history that I can’t help but be a little gleeful at its existence. The song’s not really all that great, aside from that iconic chorus, which is a huge boon, but the fact that it was a thing just seems so...right. Maybe this is  real late stage capitalism. Maybe it’s better than Rage Against the Machine.

**kappyko** (7): i love the gang vocals and dance beat and it feels fun in a way that doesn't feel insincere and it still has the class unification themes thing they promote. the layers it builds are euphoric in the same way the outro of "that's not my name" is godly. beat at the end slaps

I fucked up here. This should have been in the main rate. At one point it had the highest score of any song in the rate, and I was about to retroactively put it there over the objections of every mod here. I thought /r/popheads wouldn't rate a ballad high, even one with soulful vocals and fantastic songwriting. Also, I'm a white guy with little knowledge of old school black music. I'm racist. Please forgive me.

#fuck

**camerinian** (10): this song makes me want to take up a smoking habit, in a good way

**enecks** (10): Stream JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The saddest song about cheating besides for Unfaithful maybe

**ManofOranges** (10): groovy

**MrSwearword** (10): this song has nerve being a song about cheating/having an affair and enjoying it. Slay

**napsandnetflix** (10): counting crows outpeaked

**radiofan15** (10): Amy Winehouse outsold with Me and Mr. Jones but this is fantastic too

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I would literally just sit in an elevator for hours listening to this

**Steelstepladder** (10): Classic in every way

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Me and Mrs. Jones is one of those great classics famous within the musical scene of its kind that I’ve never got around to listening to, and I’m glad this rate pushed me to change my ways. (I’m going to be saying that a lot.) I agree with pretty much everything Todd says about this song; though Billy Paul may have faded into the depths of fame after he released it, the emotional weight he puts into its performance is enough to make you know that the man had actual, genuine talent that was sadly never sharpened in the studio properly. What a goddamn waste! The only song about cheating I’ll ever accept.

**vapourlomo** (8): Smooth as hell

#okay maybe I didn't fuck up

**ignitethephoenix** (7): nothing like an affair song

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): He’s got a really beautiful voice

**napsandnetflix** (10): whew when it's 2:30 and the bar's closing and you're seeing two and they always play this song with the lights on to get your ass out and you're stumbling all over the place trying to find your friends so you can get a cab home together but you keep talking to strangers instead then realizing you need to get your head in the game and find your friends but the bouncers are telling you to find them outside but it's cold out and I see one across the room but the bouncer is shuffling you outside even though I'm just in a flannel and it's -20 I felt that

---

**RetardedNinja35** (11): This song is amazing and quite easily my favourite in this rate (including the bonus songs)

**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**ExtraEater** (10): A series finale-esque metaphor here

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): I love this band

**Lagozzino** (10): I don't want to make the claim that it's the best pop-rock song of the 90s, but I wouldn't fight you if you made that claim.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is an outstanding song


**realboxwood** (10): It feels like you can place all the songs on this rate into four quadrants, separated into scales of good-bad and novelty-serious. This one is firmly in the corner of the good-serious quadrant

**ryjomom** (10): Takes me back to the time I was a sperm and egg - 1998

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Friends really snapped with this one

**TragicKingdom1** (10): tied for runner-up for my 11 [2]

**junobeekeeper** (9.5): I'm always so glad this song exists.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): An instant classic

**Steelstepladder** (9): Classic universally loved song that has earned it's place in music

**vapourlomo** (9): Ugh I miss the late '90s

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I’m doing this rate according to the chronological order of Todd’s One Hit Wonderland videos, which I’ve been meaning to binge watch for awhile now, and Closing Time is refreshingly great compared to what I’ve had to listened to recently. Like Take On Me, the reason why it still has a respectable legacy today is because it continues to resonate throughout the ages. Sure, not enough people know this for the stone cold 90s classic it should be considered as, but I’d like to think that such a beautiful song with such an excellent piano rift has made enough of a minor cultural impact to be in society’s good graces. A way better metaphor for birth than Sign of The Times - sorry, Harry!

**nicknac4** (8.9): classic

**camerinian** (8.5): this just makes me feel real warm and fuzzy for no particular reason idk leave me alone

**aulyve** (8): Sometimes it really do be closing time huh.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): cute for a throwback

**MrSwearword** (8): fine for what it is, but I'm just pointing out the dude singing here made stuff for Adele and Kylie Minogue

**radiofan15** (7.8): Obligatory The Office, Friends with Benefits, Rules of Engagement and Due Date (DAE remembers that movie?) comment

**1998tweety** (7): It's ok I guess

**kappyko** (7): i like this but where is it goOHHH ITS THAT SONG

**feldya** (6.5): It's fine but honestly it's a song that I've grown weary of as it's aged.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): it's alright i guess

**SpanKKy1** (6): my hole never has a closing time

**enecks** (4): Kinda forgettable.

**Cherry\_Whine** (3): I’ve always failed to see the appeal of this song. Maybe it’s just because I hate overly sad tunes but this one is too much for me. It drips with sentimentality and feels like it was made solely for graduations from the years 1998 to 2004.

It took me a long time for me to figure out why I never really warmed to the song despite it having so much going for it. The answer is: I'm not cool enough. The is simply the *coolest* song in the rate and I am too mediocre to join the club. The music video alone is nearly as influential to 90s fashion as Kurt Cobain.

#I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANOTHER

**bespectacIed** (11): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**ManofOranges** (11): It was between this and it's raining men for my 11 but I had to give my 11 to this song because it's just so infectious I could not stop thinking about it

**realboxwood** (11): I’m a college radio dj, and for my show I was considering a gimmick where I randomly chose a number from 1-6, and then played a song from the genre/theme that I paired with each number. Theme 6 was literally just going to be playing “Groove is in the Heart”

**slimboyfriend** (11): Groove IS in the heart!!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): extremely interesting production + the q-tip verse makes me nut

**williamdowley123** (11): when asia and vixen paused when it goes POP ugh their minds

**1998tweety** (10): So so iconic, hopefully a lock for top 3

**agentofscranton** (10): anyone who gives this less than a 10 is stupid and NOT gay and should be removed from this sub with haste

**aulyve** (10): Seminal bit of plunderphonics. It's cool that 28 years later Bootsy Collins is still getting asked to come on songs to say a load of weird shit on them.

**camerinian** (10): imagine giving a song with both Bootsy Collins AND Q-Tip on it anything less than a 10

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): Bow your heads for the Once And Future Club Song. Never has a tune been able to get anyone, of any age, rage, or gender, up on their feet and dancing like Groove is in the Heart. You could start the zombie apocalypse by playing this on a huge set of speakers in a graveyard.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i COULD ask for another! legendary bop and i wish i had more than one 11 bc this also deserves it

**elizakp** (10): "Vote, Baby Vote" for this mfin bop

**enecks** (10): I don't know why but this is pop perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the name did not lie. groove truly is in the heart...

**kioescport** (10): Groove is in the Heart is an impossibly good song and if it doesn't place top 3 I will accuse the entire subreddit of homophobia.

**MrSwearword** (10): this almost got my eleven had it not been for Lovefool. One of the best songs in recorded music.

**Osaka1268** (10): It's a bop but it's sad that Miss Kier hated Todds review.

**radiofan15** (10): When I was in high school I was asked to make a webpage as part of an assignment, and I ended up doing a news site of pop culture stuff with one of the front page items being an insider piece about how the next Bond theme song was gonna be a 10-minutes long epic piece sung by Britney and produced by Skrillex (this was brostep-era Skrillex) based around a sample of Groove Is In The Heart... I'm particularly proud of how ingenious I can be when I'm bored.

**Steelstepladder** (10): That bassline is untouchable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I COULDNT ASK FOR ANOTHER

**skaiansightseer** (9): dance as joy

**vapourlomo** (9): slidewhistle noise

**junobeekeeper** (8.6): the best song with a slide whistle

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I don’t really want this song to win, but I can’t give it anything less than this.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Ah, the 90s; truly an incredibly diverse decade. We get some of the most angsty rock, we get some of the most shocking hip hop, we get some of the most shamelessly manufactured pop, and we get absolute funk bangers like Groove Is in the Heart. I’m not gonna lie, I’m a bit disappointed about how underdeveloped the production here is, but, wow, does Deee-Lite know how to go off! Another minor classic.

**ryjomom** (8): Oh no, the rap did not measure up to the rest of the song

**sbb618** (8): Half of this song sounds crazy familiar and I can't place it and it's bugging me

#I could.

**jolteonhoodie** (7.1): This would be higher if the song was shorter tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): The rap break and slide whistle in this is a CHOICE

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this sounds like a VHS aerobics tape 💀

**RetardedNinja35** (3.2): Hate the music video, the brightful colours hurt my eyes. Song sucks too

**Daghi** (2): straight trash

**JanuraryFourteenth** (1): Her voice is so grating on the chorus big yikes this is hard to listen to

This was gonna be in the rate. But the night before the deadline, Peter Garrett personally came over to my house, dragged me out of bed and told me to "fuck right off" because "I didn't write a song about the genocide, yes, *genocide* of the Indigenous people just to be in your fucking VH1 countdown  shit next to Paris 63 or whatever" and that maybe he'd reconsider if I made a $3,000 AUS donation to the [Healing Foundation](https://healingfoundation.org.au/), one for every indigenous Australian who served in World War 2. Then he called me a colonizer. I couldn't afford that, so here it is.

#real shit

**belfman** (10): AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE

**camerinian** (10): If this were in the rate proper, it would easily have taken my 11. Midnight Oil are one of my favourite bands ever, and this is one of their most anthemic songs in spite of the horribly depressing subject matter (not uncommon for them tbh). Also Todd was 100% right in saying Forgotten Years is their best song.

**enecks** (10): Stream Wikipedia articles about what this song was based on, holy fuck Australia needs to hurry up with recognition and treaties.

**junobeekeeper** (10): really really like this.

**ManofOranges** (10): Another iconic song

**MrSwearword** (10): politically charged rock that just fucks people up whilst they rock out to it

**RetardedNinja35** (10): This band was a pretty big deal in Australia and had a massive impact. Obviously, there is still a lot of racism in Australia but it’s much better than it was two/three decades ago. Peter Garrett was a disappointing politician though.

**sbb618** (10): This is a great contrast to Eve of Destruction in how to do a protest song. Rather than the general anti-current situation lyrics of Barry McGuire, Midnight Oil hones in on one specific issue and gets mad about it. The verses in this song are nothing special, but it explodes into the chorus, it instantly deserves that 10.

**Steelstepladder** (10): Eighties alternative might be my favorite period for music ever if I'm being honest. Five years into the future when TiTS opens up requests again I might ask for Under the Milky Way by the Church

**vapourlomo** (10): It feels weird grading this very-serious song next to I'm So Sexy and Baby Got Back

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Holy, shit, yes! This is a perfect song! What an absolute fucking gem. It’s a real shame I can’t give it or Me and Mr. Jones my 11. I’m already one for well executed social commentary in songs, but Beds Are Burning is a rare protest against a country’s treatment of indigenous people that’s actually really fucking sincere, and even then it’s a really great rock song to just get angry to. This is what allies should be like, y’all. Fuck all the white allies who aren’t dedicated enough to make songs like these and try going for pale shit like We Are The World instead. If there’s any justice, this would be better remembered.

**elizakp** (9): Great song with deep message

Hanson is not a one-hit wonder. If they're a OHW, then so is Carly Rae Jepsen, as their career trajectories (3 top 40 singles, 2 top 10 singles, a post-fame indie career) are pretty similar. That said, it earned its place near (if not at) the top of the bonus rate, no matter what Todd himself may say.

**saucymac** (10): LET ME TELL YOU I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE THIS AN 11, ITS WHAT THESE MUSICAL ICONS DESERVE

**Steelstepladder** (10): Perfect perfect perfect

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Serving Kmart realness

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): mmmm

**RetardedNinja35** (9.2): A decent upbeat pop record which stands out compared with the slow love ballad, gangsta rap and grunge/alternative rock that was so prominent for much of this decade.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): Unironically love this song

**sbb618** (8.5): Great chorus, mediocre verses.

**junobeekeeper** (8.1): this song has no reason to be so existentialist.

**camerinian** (8): fuck me this is the hook of the decade, also fuck me it's kind of annoying eh

#mmmFLOP

**ImADudeDuh** (7): tepid bop

**ryjomom** (7): catchy and fun

**vapourlomo** (7): Solid, but too repetitive

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Yes! Another meme song! Woohoo! Technically, Hanson aren’t one hit wonders, but we had to rate this at some point, huh? ...well, the funny thing about this song is that I’ve heard it countless times and I’ve read about Hanson before and I’ve...never made the connection. I didn’t know this was MMMBop until this rate. Haha. Anyway, this is a cute song. It’s a little too...juvenile for me, the same way the Jackson 5 are, but it’s fun and Hanson actually sounds like they’re having a good time here. Stream Penny and Me.

**MrSwearword** (6): I mean sure they took punches left and right, mostly undeserved, but let's be real; we give a shit about this song because of the chorus and not a goddamn thing else.

I don't know if this song is good. I do know that Martha Wash is a legend and the OG musicial gay icon, the music industry did her dirty, and I'm glad popheads didn't make the same mistake.

---

#HALLELUJAH

**1998tweety** (11): A gay anthem, one of the songs I bopped the most to in this rate when I was younger, it still holds up. The chorus bops so hard and this song gives me so much energy and makes me want to dance.

**ExtraEater** (11): The first song you'll see on Just Dance 2, a life-changing song and dance and music video.

**CarlieScion** (10): BOP

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): One word: I C O N I C

**enecks** (10): Me on Grindr

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Gay anthem ugh, this fucking SLAPPED in Just Dance 2

**ManofOranges** (10): Absolute powerhouse of a sing just so magnificent

**MrSwearword** (10): a contender for my eleven, it's campy goodness that should always be revered.

**radiofan15** (10): HAPPY PRIDE MONTH Y'ALL 🏳️‍🌈

**realboxwood** (10): Nothing but respect for MY meteorologists

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this one's gonna win

**ryjomom** (10): They seem like such fierce ass women and I cannot help but stan. And all they want is men… Relatable! Queens! Wig! Yas Gawd! Soaking Wet! I’m Baby! Raining Men Yeah!

**skargardin** (10): ended all our favs

**tapdancingpig** (10): HALLELUJAH!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Popheads when a new CRJ album drops

**vapourlomo** (10): DO WE HAVE NEEEEEEWS FOR YOU

**waluigiest** (10): they said gay rights!!

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Disco is a genre I should really get into, as I am reminded by any time Popheads rates goad me into listening to a song from that star-lit land. It’s Raining Men rivals I Will Survive and I’m Coming Out as the ultimate gay anthem from the time period I’m talking about, and it manages to stand up to its competition; the song succeeds in becoming a magnificent piece of art specifically because it gets why all popular music is essentially just a big old performance, turning up the camp like there’s no tomorrow. Is there any doubt as to why people love this so much? An instant 10.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): i'm wet

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Gays and girls unite for our anthem!

**camerinian** (9): those opening notes are like a siren for everything in the vicinity to become 1000% gayer or else

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (9): Gay pride

**junobeekeeper** (8.8): I would honestly want to be friends with The Weather Girls. They seem nice.

**aulyve** (8): The claps in this song sound so awful!! Everything else is great though, especially the fact that it gets MORE intense for verse 2 instead of resetting the energy level. Power move.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): gay anthem

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): Partly cloudy with a chance of decency

**skaiansightseer** (7): the high drama!!! iconic

**Steelstepladder** (7): Amazing at the right time. The rest of the time it's okay

#straight pride

**agentofscranton** (6): this'll probably win because this whole sub is just too gay to function - but this never really clicked with me - i can still bop to it, but i wouldn't listen to it out of choice so I can't really give it over a 6

This track is in a similar lane to Come On Eileen: A big, emotional song about nostalgia for the music of the past, with a sound that's ajdacent to new wave but with a slightly retro twist (in this case, the girl group harmonies). Anyone who's felt like the world is leaving them behind can relate.

---

#slayed

**plaguebub** (11): It's too perfect for any other song to match

**1998tweety** (10): Easily one of the best songs in this rate, a very deserving 10.


**elizakp** (10): ABSOLUTE Classic


**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fucking iconic ugh playing this in Just Dance 3 was a MOMENT

**junobeekeeper** (10): thanks buggle boys.

**ManofOranges** (10): Radio star? Radio staaar??? Radio Star?! Oh my fucking god she's fucking dead


**napsandnetflix** (10): i thought this was video killed the radio store for like way too long and i was like ya

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Streaming killed the video star

**vapourlomo** (10): How does this still sound futuristic 40 years later??

**nicknac4** (9.9): oh wah oh

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): this song killed my gay ass

**kioescport** (9.5): The Ooaaaoohs are iconic and absolutely make this song, but the rest of it holds up just as well. Listening to this I kind of realised this might actually be one of my favourite 80s songs. The fact that it's not even from the 80s can't change that. It's just got that 80s spirit.

**CarlieScion** (9): bop

**realboxwood** (9): Damn really makes you think

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This song still holds up surprisingly well. Trevor Horn, the singer in the Buggles, is also a fantastic musician in general. He was also members of the bands Yes and Asia, and has produced several fantastic songs, including "Kiss From A Rose" by Seal.

**drfranck** (8.9): This song is like the precursor to CRJ's Emotion in single form

**Cherry\_Whine** (8): Bittersweet 80s hit that’s paradoxical with its futuristic sound coupled with its ode to the past. It’s never been exactly my favorite song but I admire the way it was put together.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): This song makes me sad and nostalgic for a time I wasn’t even alive during. Neat.

**ryjomom** (8): I wish all the Visual Queens killed the Ed Sheeran Star

**Steelstepladder** (8): Genuinely great, but maybe goes on a bit too long


**camerinian** (7.5): how can something be timeless and yet horribly dated at the same time???

#popheads killed the #1 spot

**yourhostandpatron** (7): This continues another trend of half of the recognizable songs in this rate being the ones I’m most disappointed by. I’m tired of hearing all the new wave at this point, to be quite honest, and aside from that stupid band name, the Buggles...do not just have good vocals to their name. I do find the exploration of the dynamic nature of the music industry within the lyrics to be quite interesting, but even if I’d lean towards liking Video Killed the Radio star more than hating it, I’m still not a huge fan.


**RealRainbowinHeaven** (6.5): A little bit more boring than I remember but still good, really all it has is that hook and a bit of fleeting whimsy


**aulyve** (6): Fun but a bit aimless.

#DAE MTV doesn't play music anymore?

**enecks** (10): This being MTV's first song played is some big dick energy.

**MrSwearword** (10): oh how prophetic this song was...

**bespectacIed** (10): Gonna give this a 10 just for the fact that it literally birthed MTV

**RetardedNinja35** (6.6): The first song ever on MTV and had a profound impact on pop culture… yet most people don’t know this song.

**radiofan15** (6.4): Obligatory MTV comment


#I'm really starting to hate lazy samples of famous pop songs

It's impressive that a band that reps a specific region of the world so damn hard somehow made a song that everyone in the world can enjoy. Sunshine on Leith (the album and the song) kick ass btw, though they never made a hook as sticky as this again.

#500 miles just to hear this again

**1998tweety** (10): Extremely iconic, still holds up today.

**agentofscranton** (10): i used to despise this song with a passion but I can't deny just how much fun this song is - especially singing along with all your friends and strangers in the club

**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**enecks** (10): DAD DADA

**junobeekeeper** (10): As an actual twin, I feel solidarity with The Proclaimers.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Scottish legends

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Extreme bop

**roxieloxie** (9.8): I have a cute memory associated with this

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (9.5): Scottish pride

**belfman** (9): DADADA(dadada)

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): I would walk 500 miles if I could get this song out of my head

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): the instrumental buildup into the chorus is underrated

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): How I Met Your Mother made me like this song.

**feldya** (8): Da da da (da da da) Da da da (da da da) Da da da dun diddle un diddle un diddle uh da...

**vapourlomo** (8): This invented Scotland

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Ah, pretty much the only thing from Scotland people know about aside from Scrooge McDuck, David Tennant, and Hogwarts. Also the big brother of Vanessa Carlton 1000 Miles in name. One would be right in declaring this to be absurdly cheesy, and I’m sure the Proclaimers have better songs, but everything about it is just so bold and loud in a way where the cheese turns back around and ends up making something that everybody likes or even loves if they’re not a heartless monster. Admittedly I’m not a fan of the verses compared to the chorus, but still, thumbs-up.

#500 miles out the fuck of here

**radiofan15** (7.7): Love the Scottish accents

**waluigiest** (7): fine

**Steelstepladder** (6): Perfectly good but gets annoying fast

**ryjomom** (3): I remember this song being better, but it sure as hell doesn’t sound good Periodt

**slimboyfriend** (0): I joined reddit a few days ago so I could finally participate in a rate and give this song the score it deserves.

The possibly sole entry in the genre of disco lounge, this track mostly held onto the #2 spot but wasn't even close to catching up with Take On Me. The Cardigans are just a solid band, sugary and breezy but somehow with an edge, and it's a shame that their weakest album just happened to be the one that Lovefool was on. Like the #1, this is arguably not a OHW but earned its way into the main rate because it's just that beloved.

---

#I do <3

**agentofscranton** (11): just exudes class and sex

**Cherry\_Whine** (11): This is one of the most slept-on bands ever. The Cardigans don’t get nearly enough credit for pioneering the coupling of metal and pop, especially with this progressive-rock styled daydream of sighing vocals and irresistible hooks.

**enecks** (11): Well, here's my 11. Either this or Common People is my choice for song of the 90s. Melancholy happiness is the mode where pop music thrives in, and this is no ordinary pop song. It is superb, divinely inspired art that brings a synthesis of tragedy and joy, creating a bittersweet agony that is eminently enjoyable. This is good. I probably would've rigged the rate for this to win if I'd been allowed to cohost, so that might have been a good call.

**hikkaru** (11): the chorus is so heavenly

**MrSwearword** (11): some other songs were up for it, but Lovefool is legit one of my favorite songs ever and should pretty much be considered one of the top three songs in the herstory of recorded music.

**nicknac4** (11): this is tooooo good. I read somewhere once that this was Beyonce's favorite song, so this only makes sense

**rosecoloreds** (11): do i have to explain?

**1998tweety** (10): Another contender for my 11, the chorus is that good

**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): breezy jam. another 11 contender, but sadly i have only one. absolutely deserves top 3 tho

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a desperate af song but its cute

**junobeekeeper** (10): Remember when the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack invented music? Know your history.

**kappyko** (10): reminds me of people in my english class being transphobic while watching baz luhrmann's romeo and juliet

**radiofan15** (10): Sugary 90s bop that outdiabeted all of our faves

**realboxwood** (10): This is one of the few one hit wonders that transcends one hit wonderdom in my mind

**skargardin** (10): all these throwbacks im crying

**slimboyfriend** (10): So good it's worthy of a CRJ cover

**Steelstepladder** (10): pop perfection

**tapdancingpig** (10): I throw around the term “pop perfection” a lot, but I actually mean it with this song. Carly Rae can back me up on this too.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Wait what the fuck this actually isn’t Gwen Stefani

**vapourlomo** (10): Basically just a lounge-y Alvvays song. Which means it's perfect.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): carly vibes intensify

**drfranck** (9.2): My Favorite Game would've been pretty damn close to ten if I got to rate it

**feldya** (9.2): The chromatic build to the chorus is killer.

**camerinian** (9): I’m aware that this is probably a problem that affects me and me alone, but I’ve watched Hot Fuzz so many times that every time I hear this I can’t help but think about how badly Martin Blower’s about to get fucked up lmao

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): I thought this was Gwen Stefani for ages

**rslashpoopheads** (9): n i c e

**skaiansightseer** (9): unimpeachable groove

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Many other people doing this rate are pointing to this as their pick for their 11; I can’t imagine it beating out Take On Me or It’s Raining Men, but, hey, yeah, I can totally see the appeal behind Lovefool. I don’t know anything about the song since Todd’s video for it is down and I couldn’t find a transcript anywhere, but even if it’s not among the songs I love the most in this rate, it certainly is an example of a groovy pop hit that gains its popularity from being absolutely suave. Rico who? This gets a thumbs-up from me.

**waluigiest** (8): chorus does the heavy lifting for this song

#No fuck off

**kioescport** (7): It's a bit too sugary for me, but I can get down with it.

Yep. It wasn't even close. The subject of the first One Hit Wonderland episode is the winner. Overplay has ruined this song for me a little, but I'm not gonna pretend that the music video didn't blow my mind when I first saw it. It'll likely be the first 80s song to get a billion views on Youtube, and for a very, very large chunk of people, Take On Me is that bitch. Congratulations to A-Ha, who I'm sure are thrilled that people consider them a one hit wonder.

#people who can hit the high note

**CarlieScion** (11): Norwegian gods

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This song really encapsulates the 80’s and it is the ultimate one hit wonder (even if it technically isn’t).

**radiofan15** (11): Good song elevates by such an amazing music video

**rosesmp3** (11): I have intense memories of hearing this song a million times on the Singstar Pop game as a child and even back then I knew it absolutely slapped. Maybe it's the nostalgia talking but this represents synthpop perfection to me.

**rslashpoopheads** (11): you already know what this is gonna be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlyq22ybsRw

**skargardin** (11): Classic, masterpiece, iconic, what else is there to say. There were plenty of eleven contenders this time around but this one just feels.. correct

**SpanKKy1** (11): my hole is literally gaping

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Iconic song, iconic music video, horrible choice for karoke. I would also like to use this space to plug the fact the a-ha is one One-Hit Wonder whose other music is actually really good. The Sun Always Shines On TV is a big bop that more people should know.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): I haven’t even looked at any of the other songs on this list and i know that this masterpiece is getting my 11. Not only does it have the objective best music video of all time, the chorus is so show-stopping and beautiful and the verses don’t lose any steam. 35 years later this true work of art still

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconic, despite becoming a memed songs it's still a 10

**aulyve** (10): Timeless.

**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean? ANYBODY. Children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at FUNERALS.

**camerinian** (10): y'all ever FEEL a song with HEART

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): literally one of the greatest songs ever recorded

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the falsettos snatch me

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): Pitbull did it better

**kioescport** (10): This just feels like the defining song of the 80s to me and should be the heavy favourite to win the whole thing.

**ManofOranges** (10): Simply one of those legendary songs

**MrSwearword** (10): If you want 80s cheese and you have to limit it to a single act from the 80s, look no further

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (10): Easily one of the best songs to come out of the 80’s, the feel of this song is timeless, and the production has not aged an day

**roxieloxie** (10): fuck Africa by Toto, this is the true 80s bop

**vapourlomo** (10): Anyone who gives this song less than a 9 is just angsty cause they couldn't hit the high note at karaoke

**Lagozzino** (9): Is there any point to going to karaoke night if you don't do this song and drunkenly attempt to hit those high notes?

**Steelstepladder** (9): Probably would get a ten in any other rate but there was some steep competition

**waluigiest** (9): this song makes white people go absolutely bonkers

**yourhostandpatron** (9): My hot take is that I don’t think Take On Me is ‘best song of all time’ material (it gets close, but sometimes the vocals and the synths don’t really as match up as well as they should). Even if I’ve never been able to fully grasp how much other people love the song, though, I totally understand how iconic it is. A big part of what amplifies it as a whole for me is its music video, which is just incredible in both concept and execution; now, that video is something I have no trouble calling a favourite. A-Ha also has one of the most interesting careers of all the acts in this entire rate, too, so I’d actually quite like it if they won.

**RetardedNinja35** (8.7): The animation hasn’t aged as badly as other famous 80s music videos (Sledgehammer, Money for Nothing).

**feldya** (8.5): I dare anyone to listen to this and not try to hit the high note at the end.

**jolteonhoodie** (8.5): You've all tried to hit that high note and failed, don't lie

**realboxwood** (8.5): I have no clue what this man is talking about, but I feel it

**junobeekeeper** (8.1): It's fun!

**enecks** (8): Overplayed by boomers? Yes. Good? Yes.

**kappyko** (8): its not my favorite at all and i never have the stamina to listen to it as i do my other 80s faves. but its still a classic!

**ryjomom** (8): 80s aesthetic

**skaiansightseer** (8): not their best song, but still a classic

#people who can't hit the high note

**Cherry\_Whine** (7): Timeless 80s classic that hasn't always been my favorite but is pretty great anyway

**nicknac4** (7): classic crazy dance jam

**rosecoloreds** (6.5): overrated and completely ruined by that one stupid vine

**tapdancingpig** (5): I know that this is an unpopular opinion, but this song bores me. Partially because it’s on the list of “straight bro approved pop music,” but also... it’s just so overdone?
