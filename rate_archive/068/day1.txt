[(piano intro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od-hWlthrj4)

Hello Amydog stans, and welcome to One Hit Wonderland, where we roast bands and artists known for only one* song. You guys rated 78(!!) different tracks, and today were are destroying the hopes and dreams of 55-36 in the Main Rate and 23-15 in the Bonus Rate.

We're gonna be starting at **3PM EST**, or 1 hour from the creation of this post. Follow the reveal here at **https://plug.dj/popheads**

**STATS**

Number of participants: 78 [List of participants](https://pastebin.com/4NsLcdcV) 

Average score: 6.790

Average controversy score: 2.365

Number of users with "poo" in their name: 3

I had pretty good judgement with the bonus rate (with one exception, we'll get to that on Day 3): Over half the songs scored 6 or less, and nothing scored 8 or higher

junobeekeeper: This was an absolutely wild and fun rate. Sure my top choice for an 11 contender was relegated to the bonus rate (#justiceforbuttholesurfers) but luckily there were no less than five other songs here I wanted to give an 11 to so.... we'll see how it goes. I expect Lovefool to make it to the top 5, and I expect Party All The Time to be bottom 10 (and that's being generous).

Most holiday songs are only worth listening to once a year. This song was worth it once, the year it came out. Please let this song rest out for a decade or four. 

Look at all those 1s. Look at 'em!

#WE STAN COUSIN MEL

**ManofOranges** (10): Omg this song makes me think of the movie which is a work of art

**mars4mann** (7): i watched this movie for the first time in years this christmas and man that movie is fucked up

**ryjomom** (7): EYE CON IQUE

**RetardedNinja35** (6.7): Much more interesting than hearing the same boring Christmas songs/carols every bloody year.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): cousin mel is a main pop girl

**rslashpoopheads** (6): ok

_______

#Please go back in time and undo the birth of Jesus so this song will never come into existence

**napsandnetflix** (3): one of the worst christmas songs ever lol

**sbb618** (3): There is no reason to ever, ever listen to this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): I had a stupid reindeer that lit up and played these things and I can’t do this goodbye

**yourhostandpatron** (3): Yo, Naps, I don’t know if you’re reading this, but thanks for not including this in the Christmas rate. This shit sucks. This is the literal definition of being edgy without being funny. It’s the closest you can get to a perfect example of what that phrase connotes without being politically controversial. The only joke here is in the title; grandma gets ran over by a reindeer in the lyrics. That’s it. That’s the only reason why the song exists. There’s no wit to be found in the rest of the story at all and you can’t even understand the point Elmo and Patsy are trying to make here, or even if there was supposed to be a point at all. And to think there’s another holiday song in this rate that’s way better...Monster Mash, sweetie, I’m so sorry.

**1998tweety** (2): Awful, always was one of my least fav Xmas songs

**JanuraryFourteenth** (2): BAD REINDEER! BAD!

**waluigiest** (2): my mom wouldn’t let me listen to this song as a child and I refuse to engage with it now in solidarity

**belfman** (1): my girlfriend (neither of us are American) heard this on "the good place", when they played the songs they'd play in a party in hell, and wondered if it was even real. Yep.

**camerinian** (1): Can’t wait for the quirky updated 2019 remake, “A Jaded Elf Committed A Workplace Shooting”

**drfranck** (1): So this is really the only 'one' I'm giving in this rate Just really the worst thing

**enecks** (1): Stream All I Want For Christmas Is You

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Trash song but reminder that Cousin Mel is that BITCH!

**junobeekeeper** (1): It's not my least favorite Christmas song but it's damn close

**moooo566** (1): novelty christmas songs are the worst

**MrSwearword** (1): just put Grandma in a home if you hate her that much, you asshole.

**Osaka1268** (1): But "Grandpa's gonna sue the pants off of Santa" is an 11

**radiofan15** (1): I'll rather listen to Kevin Federline's Christmas album

**Steelstepladder** (1): does anyone actually like this song?

#A fresh batch of saltwater taffy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This should’ve been in the main rate this is holy

**1998tweety** (8.5): A bit of a banger tbh

**vapourlomo** (6): Lol this song is terrible but I can't hate it

#A Mecco wafer that's been in the bottom of an Easter basket since 2005

**rslashpoopheads** (4): ok

**ImADudeDuh** (3): We-

**camerinian** (2): this song can suck my twizzler

**enecks** (1): Stream literally anything other than this, jesus christ

**JanuraryFourteenth** (1): This would’ve been my 0 if it was in the normal rate

**Lagozzino** (1): Are you absolutely positive I can't give a 0 to a bonus song?

**MrSwearword** (1): tacky and reminds me of douchebags in my high school days. Also, laffy taffy = pussy is just gross

**radiofan15** (1): Holy cow this is a 3x Platinum #1 hit... HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

**ryjomom** (1): Banana flavor sucks, don’t @ me

**Steelstepladder** (1): No. Just no.

**yourhostandpatron** (1): Haha, fuck, guys, did you really put this in the bonus rate just to avoid low hanging fruit? Because there’s no way everybody wouldn’t have given this their 0 otherwise. Well, maybe not, because the Baha Men are still in the main rate, and Popheads doesn’t know they’re black despite their name literally being the Baha Men, and we all know how racist this sub is! Don’t worry, though; I hate both songs, and that has nothing to do with race. Anyway, my opinion of this song is that it’s awful. It’s godawful. I’m so glad I missed the era of ringtone rap. I’m so glad I was too much of a sad kid to care about snap music back when it was popular. Apparently even the members of D4L hate this song too. Ugh. Well, this goes without saying, though: Shawty Lo didn’t deserve to die so young. Condolences.

I was gonna rag on Gerardo for having all the authencity of South of the Border while comparing it to the current Latin pop resurgance. But that's not really a mark against the song. T.a.t.U aren't really lesbians, but that doesn't take away from the brilliance of "All The Things She Said". No, this song sucks because Gerado cannot for the life of him sell his Casanova-meets-Mexican-gangster image. He is, to put it mildly, not suave. Yeah, the beat slaps, but "My Humps" does too if you look strictly at the instrumental. By all accounts, Gerardo is a cool, upstanding guy, and yet this is what he deserves.

---

**radiofan15** (8.5): Trashy? Oh course... Awful? Of course... Catchy? Sure it is

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): invento rap

**kappyko** (8): The production is such a slay and I love what this is even if it's very misogynistic... break it down Gerardo

**1998tweety** (7.5): Another song that's super weird but oddly I think it works. It has a goal of setting a specific atmosphere and tone, and it does a very good job at doing that.

**jolteonhoodie** (7.5): oh no i didn't realize i liked this

**ManofOranges** (7.5): This song is too long for its own good but the hook definitely makes it more tolerable

**sbb618** (7.5): Songs in English are good. Songs in Spanish are good. Songs that switch between English and Spanish every two lines are not good.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This song is supposed to be intentionally funny right? Also this is the most 90’s sounding rapping I’ve ever heard.

**roxieloxie** (6): idk what’s happening but the beat slaps

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): RICO!! KENNY!!

**RetardedNinja35** (5.3): This was Interscope Records’ first ever hit song. They’ve come a long way since then, both commercially and critically.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): rrrrrricooo (is not) suuuaveee

**vapourlomo** (5): Lol I'm sure that no woman can handle you, Gerardo, that's definitely why you're watching Netflix on Friday nights alone

**yourhostandpatron** (5): This doesn’t really deserve to be called a terrible song, honestly. I can spy some stuff that could’ve made it half-way decent if I look closely enough. Also, Gerado is genuinely hot. Despite the fun novelty this has as one of the first Latin hip-hop songs to gain any attention, though, it’s kind of obnoxious all-throughout with all the sexism and womanizing that pervades its lyrics. Even then, there’s not enough substance nor mindless fun to it to make it a genuinely good song. Todd really hates this one, and that’s not entirely an unfounded reaction, either.

**junobeekeeper** (4.1): Don't like it

**MrSwearword** (4): "eat 'em raw like sushi" that's a lot of emotion for a disposable piece of dreck but he's pretty and had a hand in making Shakira and latin pop a thing.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): "I eat 'em raw like sushi" 💀

**ryjomom** (4): #SUSHÍ, SWEETIE. I’M SO SORRY. I’M SO SORRY THAT A UGLY ASS BITCH LIKE GERARDO WOULD EVEN SAY THAT, OH MY GOD.

**elizakp** (3): This blows and makes me uncomf to listen to

**camerinian** (2): hahahah it starts with this fucking smooth deep Latin lover voice and then the verse starts and it’s this fucking squeaky Spanish pre-teen dude rapping about being straight edge hahahahaha and he still thinks he’s a fucking puss hound omg ok buddy hahahahahah

**Steelstepladder** (2): This song is dumb. It's so dumb. It's really really dumb. And not the fun dumb it's just dumb dumb.

**waluigiest** (2): an empty song that’s objectifying in two languages

**aulyve** (1): Oof no.

**Cherry\_Whine** (1): Annoying wannabe teen idol scores a single hit with an old sample and leaves. What was his name again? How did this song go? Who knows? More importantly, who cares?

**enecks** (1): This is like being hit on by someone at the club who puts on a fake accent to seem exotic and sexy.

**hikkaru** (1): obnoxious and not good

**kioescport** (1): The only thing that saves this from a lower score is that Eddie Murphy was also in this rate.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): This is just... not good

**Daghi** (0): do I really have to justify this?

**ImADudeDuh** (0): we do NOT stan this racist, stereotypical, offensive SONG! But weird al did snap on Taco Grande, which my parents did play often when i was young.

**realboxwood** (0): Is it wild that I hate the background vocals even more than Gerardo’s performance, which I already hate a lot

Hello Debbie, welcome back from the Grammy rate. I'll admit, I like this song more than I probably should (Todd calling it "You White Up My Life" was spot-on), but there's one thing about it that I don't see people talk about: the fucking recorders. It's hard to take the song seriously when the chorus is hearled by what sounds like a class of 2nd graders picking up an instrument for the first time. 

---

#THE LIGHT IS COMING

**radiofan15** (9): They don't make them like these anymore

**elizakp** (8): I really should hate this but I don't

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Idk why it gets so much hate, its a bop.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Ah, it’s the most unbearable, most overwrought, most suffocatingly sweet, and most passionately hated ballad of all time. And, actually, I don’t even dislike it. Maybe I was just raised in a culture where hearing songs like this was commonplace enough to be a normal part of my musical experience, but, jeez, people, this isn’t even that bad. Yes, it’s as white as hell, and Debby Boone doesn’t really have the skill or background to make the quasi-religious tones of You Light Up My Life seem as monumental as they should be, but the poor girl does a fine job at singing, and I don’t really see how you could find it in you to loathe somebody who seems as wholesome as Debby Boone. The truth is that this song only walked so Whitney’s rendition of I Will Always Love You would be able to run, but I don’t think it deserves as much resentment as it’s gotten in the past. I would prefer listening to this over anything from Pat Boone, at any rate.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): ok

**1998tweety** (7): Picks up near the end but besides that its meh

**MrSwearword** (7): I mean it's just tacky and innocent but this is a case of overexposure/too many weeks at #1 [10 weeks for this song] that has people hate it. My case is that it's just weak against the field

**ryjomom** (6): its sounds like a good movie climax song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Slow but nice

#ABANDON ALL HOPE

**RetardedNinja35** (5.9): The record label made LeAnn Rimes perform a cover version of this song and made it the titular track of her album… when she was just 15 years old. Why?

**enecks** (3): Stream Lights by Elle Goulding

**camerinian** (1): if anyone could get through their commentary for this without falling asleep, I’d be very surpr

Kyper's star has fallen further than any other artist in this rate. Which is a shame, he seems like a nice guy (he actually commented on Todd's video) and his old electro tracks were actually pretty good if that's your thing. So this score is more pity than anything else.

---

#O

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): I’m one of the Kyper Stan’s you were talking about

**1998tweety** (9): This slaps, way too long though

**enecks** (6): Stream Strategic Tic Tac Toe on Cool Math Games

**Lagozzino** (6): When you're a one hit wonder and absolutely no one remembers your hit...

**ryjomom** (6): wicki wicki

#X

**sbb618** (5.5): This song is an insult to Yes

**rslashpoopheads** (5): so generic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Can’t wait for Ariana to cover this on whatever album Monopoly is on

**yourhostandpatron** (5): Oh, my God. I don’t even know what to make of this one. It’s actually really catchy and in some ways it deserves to be remembered as a meme (just look at Kyper’s facial expressions in the music video) but it’s all just a bit fucked up. Treating sex as a game is already...strange, but then the song goes on to objectify women to a degree that’s a bit distracting and disturbing (we should also talk about how tragically hilarious the line ‘is it sex? maybe so’ is) to the point where it ruins Tic Tac Toe more than a little bit. Then, Kyper talks about his dad walking into him boning somebody and I just kind of disassociate from there. No, really, why did he talk about his dad catching him in bed?! Why?! This is disgusting. Maybe I would be angry enough to give Kyper my 0 if I could. Fuck you, Kyper. You’re lucky this crap has some chaotic potential in it, because otherwise it would be straight up terrible. Is this trash? Maybe so! Haha, please kill me. All this for a 5...

**RetardedNinja35** (4.2): This song is so stupid. Shouldn’t someone like Weird Al or Weezer be singing this.

**camerinian** (4): If it didn’t break the ranking system, i’d give this a “literally who/10”

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this song has so much going on in it, I thought I was having an anxiety attack

**Steelstepladder** (4): The fact that this exists makes me happy. The actual song however does not

**rotating3Dtext** (3): PAINFUL

**radiofan15** (1.4): The fact that this one doesn't even have a Wiki page says a lot

The most controversal song in the rate is out, and I'm a bit surprised it happened so quickly. This song slaps if you ignore... okay, a lot, but at least it's fun. Some of the songs coming up are just worthless.

---

#YEE HAW

**enecks** (10): Giving this a 10 because I snuck into the girl's line and danced with boys before I was out as trans and this was playing. Rednex says trans rights.

**ExtraEater** (10): begone you foul demon

**letsallpoo** (10): one of the greatest songs of all time

**nicknac4** (10): do I even need to comment on this?

**radiofan15** (10): What does this feels like a Moby song from the Play era

**roxieloxie** (10): just fucking dance

**sbb618** (10): Yeah. That's right. I said it. The faux-Western dance craze by a Swedish band gets a 10. And it deserves it.

**skargardin** (10): We used to dance to this in middle school at our version of “proms” and it was the most iconic shit ever

**tapdancingpig** (10): When this song gets played in public, I lose my mind. I start doing the stupid line dance that I learned in middle school and watch others feel the secondhand embarrassment. Somehow, I don’t care. This song is the one thing that takes away my self-consciousness for three minutes.

**ManofOranges** (9): You know I never I thought I'd ever say this but I think this song would be better if they just took out the girl's part and left in the guy repeating his part like 15 more times

**rslashpoopheads** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i unironically believe this is a country song

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): okay this has mysteriously stuck in my head for months and i have no idea why because its been years since ive heard it before this rate???????

**1998tweety** (7): One of the few songs where the meme has actually made me dislike the song, I concede though....it still kind of slaps.

**Cherry\_Whine** (7): I first heard this song through the video game Just Dance, so it always reminds me of being ten and dancing to those proto-folktronica beats. If it wasn’t for the nostalgia I have for it, it would be a one or two easily. God, it’s annoying.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Lil Nas X is shaking at the genre blending of the song!

**waluigiest** (7): TBT to elementary school gym class where we learned this dance alongside crank dat soulja boy

**RetardedNinja35** (6.9): What the rest of the world thinks of southern USA (although a little exaggerated)

**CarlieScion** (6): bop but also annoying

**hikkaru** (6): iconic...

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Every once in a while I forget these people are German

#HELL NAW

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Where DID he come from?

**yourhostandpatron** (5): No. There is something absurdly wrong about the fact that a Swedish musical group called Rednex decided to make an Europop version of Cotton Eye Joe. That alone is so much of a terrible idea that it’s began to influence me into thinking reverse racism is an actual thing. That being said, so much audience-alienating premises in the song itself probably means that Cotton Eye Joe actually succeeds thanks to all of those factors cancelling each other out in a heap of absurdity, right? Nope. This song is awful. I could not fathom the emotions I was experiencing when I heard it. In short, no.

**elizakp** (4): Reminds me too much of middle school dances

**Lagozzino** (4): I mean, I can only stand to listen to it for a minute before I feel like I'm being bludgeoned to death with a fiddle, but there's no denying it goes hard as a motherfucker.

**camerinian** (3): I give this a 3 but I absolutely will hoedown if this comes on at a party and there is nothing you can do about it

**feldya** (3): The fact that a Swedish euro-dance group named Rednex remade an American folk song is amazing. Also amazing is the history or this "group," the fact that it was franchised, and that you can buy their website and IP from them. But this song gives me terrible flashbacks to being an awkward middle school boy and not wanting to dance. Hearing those opening notes struck fear into my soul, as I'd quickly leave the school dance and head for another room.

**vapourlomo** (3): Oh god it's the same thing over and over and over

**rosecoloreds** (2.5): for the yeehaw vibe

**aulyve** (2): I have no patience for you Cotton Eye Joseph. There are so many awful club songs on this list.

**skaiansightseer** (2): all memes aside this hurts my ears

**slimboyfriend** (2): By the Max Martin-adjacent Rednex

**ImADudeDuh** (1): we do not stan sweden stealing redneck culture.

**junobeekeeper** (1): I hate that I know the dance to this song

**realboxwood** (1): This song isn’t even 3 and a half minutes long but it feels like it goes on for years

**ryjomom** (1): and they say whites don’t have culture. also watch this be the most controversial song

**williamdowley123** (1): straight white shit idc

**LuckyKidA** (0): remember at summer camp in middle school when they'd play this stupid song and all the kids would go crazy and start dancing because it sounded silly, you know like the Spongebob theme? i was not one of those kids.

**MrSwearword** (0): if anything is a zero through and through, it's this abomination that Sweden can never truly be redeemed from.

**Osaka1268** (0): The worst novelty song I've ever heard and the more I am forced to hear it the more I hate it.

**plaguebub** (0): I mean come on

**static\_int\_husp** (0): God, there's so much wrong with this song. It's repetitive, the instrumental isn't all that good, it has some annoying sound effects, and the chorus, while iconic, is not actually good. Also, let's talk about the cover of the album. It's someone pissing into a bowl, with the faces of all the band members in the bowl. What actual hell did Rednex come out of? Also apparently they're a Sweidsh band??? What?????? Also, accoridng to this graph on Wikipedia, they've had over 20 members, and they all specialize in "Redneckery" rather than any specific instrument. I spent way to much time looking into this, and it only makes me more confused about why this song exists in the first place.

Yep, somehow it wasn't first out. The problem with novelty songs is that TV and radio stations will keep playing it long after everyone is sick of it, like they're punishing humanity for the crime of enjoying it. This song being an example, and it didn't have much staying power to begin with. It very quickly turned from a fun island-inflected hip hop track to an ad jingle for the concept of dogs.

---

#YOU THE MAN NOW DAWG

**bespectacIed** (10): the dogs: and i - WHO

**CarlieScion** (10): b o p

**kappyko** (10): Remember their other song that was featured on the shrek dvd that was a hit soooo

**MrSwearword** (10): because fuck all of you, this slays in its own right

**napsandnetflix** (10): Rugrats in paris fucking snapped when spike was running through paris down the eiffel tower with other dogs while the dog catchers chased them down. Also I'm only like 60% sure that's what happened when they played this song during the movie but can we talk about how weirdly asian-centric the movie was considering it was rugrats in PARIS? Paris was like secondary except when chuckies dad had his wedding at notre dame (rip but also the gag of thinking he can rent out the notre dame for his wedding) and the rest was about asian culture like I specifically remember they went out for sushi ok

**roxieloxie** (10): fuck men

**SpanKKy1** (10): serving primary school dance


**waluigiest** (10): this record radicalized a generation

**sbb618** (9.5): You know this song won a Grammy? There's a reason for that.


**1998tweety** (8.5): Chorus is extremely iconic...honestly I did not know what the verses sounded like, and after hearing the song I still don't cause this song is 90% chorus so the rest is forgettable.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This song turned me into a feminist at age four.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Chorus is a 10 because it’s that iconic, the verses I never heard until today for some reason

**ryjomom** (8): i wish the song was fuller; like if this was made today i would need blaring synths and a louder marimbas

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): this rate is basically my childhood

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its a bop idk why it gets so much hate?

**tapdancingpig** (7): I don’t hate this song? I don’t think I like it, but it’s a part of pop culture for a reason.

**skargardin** (6): iconic hook but the rest? :idkher:

#TRAPPED ON A ROTTING CRUISE SHIP IN THE SARGASSO SEA

**rosecoloreds** (5.5): your average movie about dogs has this song on the soundtrack

**junobeekeeper** (4.1): again i'm not feeling this one.

**feldya** (4): It's fun I guess but I'm fine not hearing it again.

**Cherry\_Whine** (3): Terrible early-2000s novelty song that only gets points because of nostalgia.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (3): Abhorrent

**ManofOranges** (3): I've just heard this song too many times

**realboxwood** (3): This is the song version of a terrible kids movie with talking animals

**hikkaru** (2): trash

**nicknac4** (2): nah

**rotating3Dtext** (2): BAD score for meaning

**Steelstepladder** (2): The poster child of bad music... But there is worse stuff out there.

**camerinian** (1): woof this track is ruff

**enecks** (1): I can do some obnoxious songs... but not this

**kioescport** (1): Insufferable the first time I heard it, cause for planetary annihilation 15 years later.

**Lagozzino** (1): war flashbacks to every commercial for every kid's movie with a dog in it

**Osaka1268** (1): Would be an 11 if it was "Who Let Amydog Out?"

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (1): Disposable and watered-down, also annoyingly too catchy

**yourhostandpatron** (0): Dear god, why? Why?! This is a sex song?! Holy shit, straight people are terrifying. In what world did people think it was okay to make a song about humping that was annoying as this?! How many people on Earth who’ve listened to about this know it’s about sex?! Why can’t I go back to thinking it was just a dumb song about dogs?! God, there’s selling out by making soulless music and then there’s this. Maybe we shouldn’t have domesticated dogs back in the Neolithic. I never want to listen to this again.

#dae rugrats?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Only real popheads know this was a track for the Rugrats movie

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): always reminds me of rugrats in paris when spike and the other dog are running around paris or whatever

**radiofan15** (8.8): Obligatory Rugrats in Paris comment

**skaiansightseer** (4): i mostly associate this with the Rugrats

Yeah, sorry, I don't have anything to say about this except "Put Your Mouth On Me is better"

#HOTLINE BLING

**ManofOranges** (10): I didn't know Eddie Murphy was a pop girl I have to stan

**radiofan15** (10): If Michael sung this y'all be calling it one of the catchiest and lightheaded hits of the 80s

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Eddie Murphy really made this bop, I’m shook.

**ryjomom** (9): Sounds like a One-Hit Wonder, I wonder what he is up to nowadays

**agentofscranton** (8.5): d i a m o n d s o n y o u r f i n g e r

**waluigiest** (8): okay but highkey this works

**1998tweety** (7.5): For a hot minute (literally) I thought this would just be instrumental; it's pretty decent

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): pretty aight

**sbb618** (7.5): The most surprising part of this is how little it sounds like Eddie Murphy.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): this... almost slaps

**rotating3Dtext** (7): the theme of the song reminds me a bit of hotline bling

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I love Everything Is Embarrassing


**Cherry\_Whine** (6): I debated giving this either an eight or a four before deciding to go in the middle. For me this has always been a very mood-based song. When I’m in a good frame of mind this is a unabashedly cheesy but loveable piece of 80s schmaltz that gets stuck in your head. When I’m in a bad frame, it’s an irritating pastiche of funk and new wave sung by an egotistical comedian that has no business singing.


**vapourlomo** (6): Objectively bad, but in a fun way. A 6 feels right.

**Lagozzino** (5): A strong contender for dorkiest song of all time.

**LuckyKidA** (5): eddie murphy: "hit me with your best" synth guy: bem bem bem bem bem bem bem bem bem bem bem bem bem

#shut up, Donkey.

**realboxwood** (5): I mean, you can go home if you’re not having fun

**jolteonhoodie** (4.7): This is so lame

**kappyko** (3): girl im tired. he can sing i guess. the bass-y synths are a lil cool but v nondescript. black eyed peas did the concept cooler

**skaiansightseer** (3): the Michael Jordan minor league career of songs

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (2.5): This hook is so fing boring and repetitive, and Eddie Murphy is boring, how the f is it possible someone made Eddie Murphy boring other than quite easily

**aulyve** (2): Weezer voice Oo-wee-ooh this sounds just like Eddie Murphy, oh-oh and his single is a bore.

**camerinian** (2): how do you fuck up a Rick James song oh my god was eddie murphy always this useless

**junobeekeeper** (1): Listen Eddie Murphy had a long and varied career but he's always gonna be Donkey to me

**MrSwearword** (1): Rick James said it best even if he didn't mean it about this god awful shit; "cocaine is a helluva drug"

**Steelstepladder** (1): This might not be the worst song in the rate but it is the least song in the rate. I can't find it in my heart to give this song anything higher that a one.

**tapdancingpig** (1): This song is just so boring? And hookless, too. Eddie Murphy does a lot of things, but he’s usually never boring. It’s not a good look on him.


**kioescport** (0): Eddie Murphy should not sing. Or make music.

#Problematic fave?

**enecks** (0): This score is karma for your homophobic comedy, talentless hack. Like you're woefully incompetent at music, but honestly stick to that rather than your comedy.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I remember when me and my mom were watching tv and one of his comedy specials came on and we were both bored so we decided to watch it and within the first 10 minutes the jokes got very homophobic and making fun of AIDS and whew the awkwardness.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I learned this afternoon that Eddie Murphy is actually black (yes, I’m that young) and that he was involved with the arrest and death of a transgender prostitute in the late 90s. ...fun. I’m going to set that all aside and focus on this vanity project on its own for now, because if I worry more about that it’s going to turn into a doozy. I was expecting Party All The Time to be bad, and it is pretty casually sexist if you think about the song’s lyrics, but considering all the high-profile funk musicians Murphy got for this project, I guess you could say that he had enough backup filled with actual musical talent to save his brief venture into pop. This isn’t an all-time great, but it’s fun and it sounds like it was made by people who have actual knowledge in the craft of making hits, and who are, in line with that area of expertise, perfectly willing to sell their souls out for a single or two. That being said, I’m still going to give this a 7 because it makes me feel weird. Like, I’m listening to a single from the guy who voiced Mushu and I just learned he was involved in a sex work case and a murder. This is trippy, y’all. I don’t know what to do.

popheads has never been hot on Shawn Mendes, so it makes sense that 90s Shawn Mendes got the cut early.

#sleep tight :3

**napsandnetflix** (10): the perfect song haters can stay presst

**feldya** (9.5): There's just something about the mix and instrumentation of this song that is so pleasing to me. The sing talking works for me, and creates a laid back mood for the verse before the soaring vocal melody of the chorus hits. Everything's gonna be alright.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): great chorus but Shawn Mullins makes me deeply uncomfortable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Broke - stans Shawn Mendes… Woke - stans Shawn Mullins

**Steelstepladder** (7): How you doing Shawn Mullins let me whisper in your ear

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Oof. Another white guy with a guitar. Half of this rate is either memes, new wave bands from the 80s, or white guys with guitars. I swear...this is actually okay, though. I can’t really take Lullaby seriously, but I at least get what Shawn Mullins is going for here, and I think he drops some genuinely interesting lines with his, er, creative whispering. The song doesn’t really come together all that well, but it’s a genuine effort, and I can’t really be as mad at Mullins as I ought to be when I hear it.

#2straight4me

**radiofan15** (4.8): I know what the song's title is but it would kill this bitch to emote a little bit? who does he think he is? Brie Larson?

**ImADudeDuh** (4): idk but I always find songs that say "everything's gonna be alright" very comforting, but god i want to punch his voice on the verses

**enecks** (3): Stream Selena Gomez for a good lullaby

**elizakp** (2): This sucks ass

**Daghi** (1): really really hate this one

**MrSwearword** (1): this song is so plain and bad


#"smile more"

**camerinian** (1): This would have easily been my 0 had it been in the main rate, and it’s entirely because of his skin-crawling “disturbed tinder date who just really wants the chance to love you” delivery of every single line. I’m not even in the "target" demographic for this song, and I feel genuinely uncomfortable every time I hear it. Gross.

**ryjomom** (1): I’m so over these one hit wonders, also telling a girl to smile >:(

Scorpio, and this is my hot take: I like this song more than the Modest Mouse version

---

#WE STAN A 70s SINGING HAREM

**Lagozzino** (10): This is everything. It really is just everything you could ever want in a song.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): No, I did not listen to the eleven minute version of this song. I would have loved to, because this is actually pretty good (well, I don’t know if it’s good enough for me to have listened to seven more minutes of it) but here’s my justification for my decision: at least with Iron Butterfly, you *know* that people only pay attention to the seventeen minute version of their song these days because they’re a prog rock band, yo. This is 70s RnB. There’s no reason for it to be eleven minutes long. It’s not like it’s Pyramids or anything. Either way, I’m glad we evolved past this kind of RnB, but Float On is still a bit comfortably relaxing, as long as you’re not one of those people who rages over astrology.

**1998tweety** (7): There is no way I'm listening to this whole thing but it sounds consistent throughout the whole thing

**ImADudeDuh** (7): they're called the floaters, i still cant get over that ajnvsdkjvsdfv

**MrSwearword** (7): wackadoo but weak against the field

**static\_int\_husp** (7): It is at this point that I realize that it would be easier to rate some of these song if I was high

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Modest Mouse who

**enecks** (6): Stream the better Float On

**sbb618** (6): The full version of this is...checks notes TWELVE MINUTES LONG? Well, thank god I don't have to listen to that.

#TL;DL

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I would not sit in an elevator to listen to this song

**Steelstepladder** (5): awesomely bad but I'd never listen to it

**vapourlomo** (5): Shout out to Larry

**junobeekeeper** (4): Virgo, and this song just isn't good

**camerinian** (3): CANCER

**elizakp** (3): Boring af

**napsandnetflix** (3): this song is such an scorpio thing to do also 11 minutes bro PLEASE

**belfman** (2): "the room" of soul musix

**ryjomom** (2): sounds like 70s when it came out in 90s

**jolteonhoodie** (1): Gemini, and I'm jolteonhoodie, and I don't like this song

**radiofan15** (1): NO FUCK THAT THIS HAS NO RIGHT TO BE AN 11 MINUTES LONG "SONG"

Crazy Town's contribution to this track is not sucking. They stand back, let the RHCP sample do the work and don't Crazy Town all over it. And we're all better off for it.

---

#You make my legs shake, you make me go crazy

**ManofOranges** (10): This song was number 1 when I was born so obviously I feel some strange spiritual connection to it

**rosecoloreds** (10): i just had to, my best friend and i were obsessed with this song at some point. pure nostalgia.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): WTF this slaps!!

**Lagozzino** (9): This band is dogshit but I will hear no slander about this song

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): COME MY LADY. my favorite part of the song is the sample

**tapdancingpig** (8): “Come m’lady” is a geniusly sticky hook.

**camerinian** (7): lmao this is a hilarious failure but I find it really hard to hate. Comparing this to their nu-metal stuff isn’t even really fair given how much better Butterfly sincerely is by a considerable margin

**enecks** (7): Why, of all the early 2000s sugary nonsense was THIS the target of so much hatred?

**jolteonhoodie** (7): Sugar, babyyy

**Steelstepladder** (7): Look in your heart and tell me you don't enjoy this at least a little bit. You can't.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): You know what? I’m usually the type to hate the idea of nu metal like the plague, especially if the nu metal we’re talking about is nowhere near as sincere as Linkin Park (and, to be fair, I’m talking about all nu metal here) but Butterfly is okay. It’s weird that it’s a happy song, considering how angsty nu metal tended to be, and how both members of Crazy Town had their own struggles in life later on, but it’s not all that cringeworthy. It’s not all that bad. It’s kind of lame, but I wouldn’t mind it at a party, disregarding the fact that nobody in their mind would play this at a party in this day and age. It’s...fine, but I’ll give a mild pass.

**realboxwood** (6.9): I want “Whatever tickles your fan-cy” as my ringtone

**sbb618** (6.5): Gonna be honest, when I saw this title, I thought it was gonna be "Wings" by Little Mix. Anyway, not really a fan of this one.

**1998tweety** (6): This is ok...it sounds really of its time though

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): An anthem for the big titty goth gf in all of us

**MrSwearword** (6): production is great but jesus christ these RHCP wannabes should've been further flogged for their crime against humanity.

**vapourlomo** (6): This is the kind of cheese I just can't get into.

**waluigiest** (6): I always thought this was Linkin Park

#(something negative here)

**RetardedNinja35** (5.2): Crazy Town should’ve been a zero-hit wonder

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the catchiness is a 10 but the lyrics are a 0 so...

**rslashpoopheads** (5): where's the hook?

**skaiansightseer** (5): i have no opinion on this song at all

**aulyve** (3): The RHCP sample and resulting beat is pretty great and it's a shame that this guy is the one who got to rap over it.

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (2.5): The combination of rock and rap in the early 2000’s is one of the biggest mistakes in music history and while Butterfly isn’t the worst, it’s definitely the ickiest

**nicknac4** (2): not my cup of tea

**radiofan15** (2): And people dare to say Korn was the worst thing from the nu-metal era

**ryjomom** (2): But what about Kacey Musgraves

**Daghi** (1): I hate this song

**junobeekeeper** (1): There really isn't much to love here

**kioescport** (1): Nu-Metal was a mistake. I would call this the worst song of the 2000s if the entire output of Simple Plan didn't exist.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): mariah sweetie im so sorry im sorry that some ugly ass bitches would even record something like that using your word

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Just kind of cringey all around. Rap rock shouldn’t exist.

If you were a Disney or Nick fanatic of a certain age, there's a lot of songs that seemed massive at the time solely because the kids channels constantly played them, but weren't actually hits in the US. Anyone remember [Youngstown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NprJcyoySFk)? A*Teens? [Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDsH34o5IZY)? "Bring It All Back" was one of them, I know that song front to back. Anyways, this isn't their best.

**radiofan15** (10): I WOULD DEFEND THIS IMMACULATE BOP AND S CLUB 7 NO MATTER WHAT, FUCK YOU HATERS!

**1998tweety** (9.5): Got me in my feelings


**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda serving with these vocals tbh

**rslashpoopheads** (7): rate too bonus long is this

**ryjomom** (7): https://youtu.be/3twGmSu1MI0

**slimboyfriend** (7): yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Intro to this sounds like the intro to 7 Years



**MrSwearword** (5): Jo's singing is fabulous but this song is largely nothing.

#WORST NIGHTMARE

**yourhostandpatron** (5): Oh, we had a surprisingly small amount of boring, white ballads in this rate, didn’t we? I guess Todd always wants to keep his audience sufficiently entertained! Even if S Club 7 was an incredibly manufactured group, I don’t think Never Had A Dream Come True has lost every bit of soul it ought to  have; still, it’s the type of bland trite slow songs became in the early 00s, so ultimately I’ll have to leave it behind.

**enecks** (1): Stream any other S Club 7 songs

**Steelstepladder** (3): snooooore

#I can't believe it's a one hit wonder!

**elizakp** (2): WHY tf is this their most popular song

**drfranck** (6.5): I feel bad cause literally any other song from them would've definitely rated much higher

**agentofscranton** (10): it's so weird seeing S Club 7 on a 'one hit wonders' list considering just how massive they are over here in the UK - it's so sad that the US was never able to appreciate Reach and S Club Party the amount they deserved

**moooo566** (10): cant believe they're a one hit wonder in the US

**RetardedNinja35** (8.2): Feels weird that S Club 7 are considered a one-hit wonder in the US. I was too young to remember when they were at their peak but I felt they were still relatively well-known during the mid-2000s.

**camerinian** (4): Seeing this video in my sub box attached to the S Club name as a member of the 99% of countries that aren't the U.S. was the number one bruh moment in Todd history

The whole "just me chillin by the river, not a care in the world" vibe is kinda undermined by the proto bro-country lyrics. I wonder how some of these lines scanned in 1970. 

This was the Shape of You of the 70s wasn't it

---

**kappyko** (9): THIS IS THE SONG OF THE RATE THAT IM SO EXCITED TO HEAR WTF IS THIS

**rslashpoopheads** (9): ragtimey legends

**sbb618** (8.5): Yvette Nicole Brown describing Tony's beard as "definitely Mungo Jerry" was the best part of Endgame

**enecks** (8): When I feel like I've got only two brain cells, this is the party song I go for.

**agentofscranton** (7): stream neil cicierega's annoyed grunt

**Cherry\_Whine** (7): The proto-stoner jam to end all proto-stoner jams, nothing sounds more carefree and listless than this breezy ode to summertime laziness. It does get a little irritating after a while, though, and doesn’t hold up for more than a couple relistens.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): what a bop

**ryjomom** (7): This stereo ain’t it. My left ear is bleeding.

**Steelstepladder** (7): It makes me smile just enough to where I can say I like it quite a bit

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The 70s were something else


**RetardedNinja35** (6.4): This is one of the best-selling songs of all time (3rd based on physical sales behind White Christmas and Candle in the Wind). I find it bizarre at how much success this song had.

**1998tweety** (6): Not a fan of like any of this lol; it's a weird critic for a singular song but it does feel cohesive though

#This sold how many copies?

**aulyve** (5): Boatloads of dumb bastard energy radiating from this song you gotta love it.

**junobeekeeper** (5): Things are good until that lyrics, ya know?


**ManofOranges** (3): I don't like this song at all and also the singer's facial hair scares me

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.4): how the FUCK did this sell over 30 million copies lmao

**camerinian** (2): WHY ARE ALL THE FUCKING LEAD VOCALS IN ONE EAR

**realboxwood** (2): Don’t drink and drive kids

**skargardin** (2): I’m sorry i have no idea what this was and i did NOT enjoy it at all

**radiofan15** (1.9): Catchy but very vapid and blandly produced.. also I can't stop thinking about Despicable Me 2 when I heard this song

**hikkaru** (0): awful garbage this sounds so bad in my ears i would like to unhear it

**Lagozzino** (0): I hate his voice. I hate the melody. I hate those grunts. I hate his fuckin face. I HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE.

**SpanKKy1** (0): yikes

**tapdancingpig** (0): This song shouldn’t annoy me. But it does. It’s so cloying, so obnoxious, and so associated with the Minions in my mind that I can’t help but despise it.

#A Popheads PSA


**yourhostandpatron** (7): Is it me, or does Mungo Jerry seem like they belong in the bonus rate? From what I’ve seen of Todd’s survey of their career, they were successful enough overseas to have something of an actual (still quite forgettable) legacy, and this song doesn’t really have the popularity of Come On Eileen and Take On Me to still justify its place in main. I’m not complaining, though. By no means do I want to come off as a Mungo Jerry defender. On one hand, In the Summertime is a nice throwback to the days of blues back when rock and roll was yet to come, but on the other hand? If you couple in the weird afro the band’s lead singer has, and if you take into account how little problems Mungo Jerry seem to carry on their shoulders within the context of this song alone, most of it seems like gentrified shit. There’s that line about drinking and driving too...not to mention the motorcycle sounds...why has this become my longest comment in the rate?

**ImADudeDuh** (3): drinking and driving? he's cancelled sis

**vapourlomo** (1): I saw a drunk driving PSA once that heavily featured this song. It ended in a super-freaky death scene. So yeah, this song is permanently ruined for me.


**MrSwearword** (6): "If her Daddy's rich, take her out for a meal; if her Daddy's poor, just do what you feel." is by far one of the most fucked up lyrics to have even been cleared for commercial release of any kind. The fucked up thing is that the song itself is still weird and catchy as shit.

#NO ETHICAL CONSUMPTION

**elizakp** (10): Pretty great song, amazing story behind it

**ryjomom** (9): the message!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This shit slaps in the whip


**rslashpoopheads** (8): ok

**MrSwearword** (7): the weirdest song Todd has ever covered and that has a lot of competition. That aside, it can't compete with the bonus songs it's besides.


**camerinian** (6): this could have been the greatest communist anthem of a generation, smh when we overthrowing the hill people

**enecks** (6): Stream Tin Man on Wizard of Oz

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Remastered in 2019? I can't believe they remastered this song for this rate!


**Steelstepladder** (5): The true rate was the friends we made along the way

**radiofan15** (3.5): Well intentioned lyrics but MY GOD what a snoozefest

**vapourlomo** (2): Boring and corny: the worst combo

#HAIL SATAN


**RetardedNinja35** (6.8): This is a fine anti-war protest song but not sure if it should be sung by a bunch of Satanic worshippers. Also stupid plot twist.


**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Oh, haha, this is where that meme comes from. Listen, children, to my story, it was written long a-wait, what? The members of Coven actually practiced witchcraft? Huh. That’s something I can get behind. Oh, well. It’s no Station to Station (in fact, I’m sad it’s not spookier and more...bewitched) but One Tin Soldier has a lot of appeal as a cult classic, if I do say so myself. It’s written like a folk tale ought to be, and you do get the impression that it happened all a long time ago...in a galaxy far, far away...no, wait, the Star Wars theme is in the main rate...wait, what?

I don't think people give this song enough credit for inventing the T-Pain effect. Yeah, Believe had come out a few months earlier, but it was Eiffel 65's idea to mix Autotune with a vocoder. They probably doubled up on the pitch correction to hide the weak vocals, but still. That, and [Zorotl's website](https://zorotl.com/), are the only redeeming factors this song has. They actually have a few would-be bops on their 2nd album like "Life like Thunder" and "Journey", they just need a better vocalist.

---

#AVATAR OUTSOLD

**Daghi** (11): lost my virginity to this song

**enecks** (10): This is art.

**ExtraEater** (10): One of the most important piano lines ever

**realboxwood** (10): This song is an avant-pop masterpiece. No I am not accepting questions or criticism

**sbb618** (10): We stan a legend

**SpanKKy1** (10): my balls

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): “Yo listen up, here's the story about a little guy that lives in a blue world and all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue” James Cameron takes notes

**1998tweety** (9.5): A beyond iconic chorus, the verses do pull the song down a bit though

**radiofan15** (9.5): MY LIPS LIKE SUGAR, THIS CANDY GOT YOU SPRUNG, SO CALL ME YOUR SUGAR, YOU LOVE YOU SOME...

**hikkaru** (9): iconique

**ignitethephoenix** (8): IM BLUE DA BA DEE DA BA DEE x100

**rslashpoopheads** (8): iconic autotuned four on the floor anthem

**MrSwearword** (7): cute but it's not holding its own against this stacked field

**Lagozzino** (6.5): I hate how much I still like this

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Ah, we ought to have had at least one meme song in the main rate. Of course. To be honest, I could actually see Blue (Da Ba Dee) being a really good song if you’d update the production a little bit and somehow make everything else about its execution not...super cheesy, but, alas, it’s stuck the way it is, and the majority of the general population wouldn’t have it any other way. I guess I can be blue about that! Though, to be fair, Eiffel 65 is just such a bizarre band and I have to thank Italy for giving them to us.

**RetardedNinja35** (6.3): This should be one of the most annoying songs for me but surprisingly it isn’t.

**aulyve** (6): If you never had a moment in your late adolescence when you were like" broooo is this song is about, like, depression???" then spiritually you are still a teenager.

**bespectacIed** (6): My lips like sugar, my lips like sugar, this candy got you sprung, this candy got you sprung

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (6): This metaphor is so overused and clunky I’m surprised Halsey didn’t go back in time and write it

**rotating3Dtext** (6): this is motherfucking art, show me a better metaphor for depression.

**tapdancingpig** (6): I love this song, but also the vocals make me want to die?

#BLUE ARE MY EARS AFTER HEARING THIS

**kioescport** (5): Sure it's REALLY annoying and should never be listened to voluntarily but it's also kinda fun.

**Steelstepladder** (5): I wouldn't want to live in a world without this song but that doesn't mean I like it.

**ManofOranges** (4): I have to admit that this song has moments of genius shine through at parts but overall... I honestly have no words for just how to describe it

**roxieloxie** (4): overatted tbt

**vapourlomo** (4): Goddamit now this is gonna be stuck in my head for another week. Insanely annoying, but I have to give it a little credit for being so catchy

**junobeekeeper** (2.1): The first time I heard this song, it was in a video that had Spongebob characters, and I just thought I wasn't allowed to listen to it.

**camerinian** (2): I cannot state strongly enough, on record, how much i hate the One Hit Wonderland series for exposing me to the extended discography of this band, because holy shit that fucking alien’s solo song has drilled itself in to my brain and always finds the worst times to pop up. If I never have to give thought time to “I Wanna Be-be-be Far Away-ay-ay” again I will be a happy fucking man. Anyway, the original is nowhere near as obnoxious as that but it still needs to be recognised for birthing it regardless. Fuk u

**Cherry\_Whine** (2): One word - ANNOYING

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): always hated this

**JanuraryFourteenth** (2): Da ba DIE

**ImADudeDuh** (1): I would beat off a guy [2]

**nicknac4** (1): wish I had a second 0 to give

**Osaka1268** (1): Stan Zorotl https://zorotl.com/

**ryjomom** (1): Ruined my favorite color

**waluigiest** (1): when I was young I was on a trip with my family and I decided to try go-carting. I couldn’t control my cart and hit the wall on every turn like the idiot gay child I was. Eventually the ride operator had to stand on my cart and steer me out of the way. I get to the edge of the course, sobbing, as the other children are speeding by. This song was playing and that is trauma I’m not ready to unpack.

**CarlieScion** (0): repressed childhood memories oh my god

**jolteonhoodie** (0): Haaaaaate. I do love that the little blue alien guy (his name is Zorotl FYI) has his own website and backstory and music career though, that's just fascinating

**kappyko** (0): This is good for one minute and then you realize there's verses. Go listen to the Goofy version

I was hoping more of you would mention the Robin Thicke co-write and how it changes the reading of the lyrics. Instead, you guys focused on the awkward beat changes, Knight's weak vocals and out of place carnival theme. Which, fair.

#You know I had to give it to em

**1998tweety** (10): A HUGE sexual bop. The weird switches actually kind of work??

**elizakp** (9): I like this more than I should, would be a 10 but I hate the corny carny ending

**ManofOranges** (9): This song is just so confusing but I like it?

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): this slaps

**radiofan15** (8.7): Such a weird and chaotic structure... I love it

**realboxwood** (8): Justin Timberlake WHO

**ryjomom** (8): he looks fine as hell: smash, also this instrumentation is weird af but im loving it

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): r/whiteheads wins again

**kappyko** (7): THe runescape switch up into classic jimmy jam/terry lewis dance pop is a slay

**tapdancingpig** (7): There’s not a lot of substance to this song, but by God, that style!

**jolteonhoodie** (6.3): The chorus is good but the rest of the song doesn't do anything for me

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the verses are awkward but the chorus is a fucking bop and then theres weird melanie martinez circus music and this sounds like a frankenstein of 3 different songs?

**MrSwearword** (6): he had some talent but this was just not a sign that he was meant to last as an artist

**Osaka1268** (6): To whoever added Circus music to this and Independent Women Part 2. Why?

**sbb618** (6): This thing has so many weird, off-putting beat changes

**Steelstepladder** (6): perfectly fine but nothing special

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This reminds me of My Boo

**waluigiest** (6): really interesting song with cool orchestration choices, but some of the lyrics seem non-consensual which is uncool

#things creeping around in my head: not this

**skargardin** (5): i don’t know what this was but it was terribly boring

**yourhostandpatron** (5): Two words: big meh. Jordan Knight is an awesome name, and I was expecting a 90s version of Justin Timberlake’s best work from this song, but all I got was a weird-ass foray into carnival sounds and a dreary lack of any excitement whatsoever. You’re telling me this was his breakout single? What’s so special about it? Also, this bloke apparently did a horrible cover version of I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man, so, hey, no thank you, Mr. Knight. Perhaps chivalry really is dead.

**enecks** (4): Like 85% of the way to Justin Timberlake's 00s sound, but the missing 15% is... having quality.

**skaiansightseer** (4): state fair type banger

**RetardedNinja35** (3.7): This song is all over the place. Sounds like a bunch of bits and pieces of songs meshed together.

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (3.5): This really tried to be super tight and sexy, but feels like wet rope

**junobeekeeper** (3.1): If Donna Lewis is equivalent to my middle school bully, Jordan Knight was her boyfriend she made out in the hallway with for three months and blocked hall traffic before the vicious break up.

**aulyve** (3): Points for creativity but I feel like late P!atD and solo Justin Timberlake are both partially this song's fault somehow which is a pretty damning legacy that I just now invented. All the bell and whistles almost distract from the fact that there's nothing worthwhile happening here melodically.

**vapourlomo** (3): I love late '90s pop, but this just feels so herky-jerky and awkward. And the hook isn't very strong.

**LuckyKidA** (2): where is BBMak?

**camerinian** (0): This might seem like a weird choice for a 0, but bear with me. I’ve watched every episode of One Hit Wonderland multiple times at this point, and for better or worse, I’ve gotten to know every song on that show pretty well as a result. And thus far, out of every single song covered, well known or obscure, this is the only song that, after many, many viewings, I can still not recall from memory how it goes. All I remember about the song off the top of my head is that there’s some weird circus motif. And upon returning to it on its own, yeah, what is the appeal? The circus motifs are the only interesting bit, but they may as well be a recording error for how little they have to do with the main song, the production is stock standard 90’s RnB tropes, and God, the song’s just fucking creepy? Like the hushed delivery of the verses and the falsetto combined with proto-Blurred Lines pushiness? Yeah, fuck this

God, imagine how In Living Color would have reacted to Iggy Azalea.

---

#INFORMER, AEAIOEUIOAUEIOAUEOAUEOIAE

**elizakp** (10): Not even sure why, but I love it


**Cherry\_Whine** (8): Insanely catchy 90s reggae fusion is one of my favorite subgenres of music. If you manage to decipher the incomprehensible lyrics it’s a pretty terrible story of a guy attempting to be tough, but cares when you have those trumpet licks?

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I did not expect to be giving a white guy from Toronto doing a reggae song a good score, but here I am, absolutely making no sense at all. Isn’t it funny how life works? I expect this to rank quite low despite how much of an earworm it is, and I suppose that’ll be for understandable reasons (no part of this is remotely intelligible) but, hey, past all that, I do love how his inmates saw this playing on television while he was in jail, too. I have a feeling I shouldn’t like this so much, but, eh.

**jolteonhoodie** (7.5): "Daddy Snow" oh my god


**bespectacIed** (7): con calma outsold

**enecks** (7): Stream Con Calma, which is the weirdest hit of this year (and Old Town Road is a thing)

**hikkaru** (7): stream con calma remix, katy deserves

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I heard the song before but I had no clue what it was called

**ManofOranges** (7): Literally what is this song

**skargardin** (7): i cant figure out which song has sampled this even though it’s probably super obvious and IM SO FRUSTRATED that I cant figure it out

**SpanKKy1** (7): katy outsold

**Steelstepladder** (7): This gets extra points because snow gets his butthole searched during the song

**1998tweety** (6.5): Eh, it has some elements I like but also a lot that I don't.

**MrSwearword** (6): mainly because of the Jim Carrey led spoof on In Living Color and not a goddamn thing else.

#A LICKY BOOM BOOM DOWN


**ryjomom** (5): okay background music, that’s about it

**JanuraryFourteenth** (4): My dad’s college roommate apparently played this song all the time, for some reason.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the ari school of pronunciation


**RealRainbowinHeaven** (3): I actually put this in the category of annoyingly too catchy, along with Call Me Maybe and two other songs on this list

**rslashpoopheads** (3): ok

**junobeekeeper** (2.5): not great.

**skaiansightseer** (2): fake patois

**camerinian** (1): Legend: The Best of Bob Marley plays in the background mm hmm gee whizz I sure do love me some patois (pronounced pat-oy-s) Jah Rastafari!

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): lmao

**nicknac4** (1): huh

#Hola, me llamo Katy



**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Katy Perry fans in this rate getting their minds blown

**RetardedNinja35** (8.1): Does it still count as a one-hit wonder if he has a 2nd hit but it’s just a Latin version of Informer.

**sbb618** (8): I had never heard this song before, and for a second I thought "Hey, wait a minute...this is just "Con Calma"!" before I came to my senses.


**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Katy Perry did it better, don’t @ me.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea

**realboxwood** (3): Can you believe that, in the year of our lord 2019, Snow has another hit

**radiofan15** (5.5): At least is better than Con Calma... UGH not even Katherine saved that trainwreck

Nu-metal bands had this weird fascination with 80s synthpop. You have Seether's "Careless Whisper", Korn's "Word Up", Disturbed's "Land of Confusion", and Limp Bizkit's "Faith", which might be only thing more homophobic than Mike Pence. This is one of the better covers.

---

#YOU'VE BEEN HIT BY, YOU'VE BEEN STRUCK BY...

**1998tweety** (10): I thought this was an MJ song lmao, a 10 regardless

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (9.5): Never forget that a wannabe Smash Mouth outdid the king of pop

**ImADudeDuh** (9): bop but a cover that isnt as good as the original

**Lagozzino** (9): Better than MJ's original. Fight me.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This rate has forced me to listen to something to do with Michael Jackson twice, and all ethical standards aside I’m actually okay with that. Thank you, rate. Anyway, if you were to give me a good concept for a cover, you couldn’t have persuaded me to like the idea of a band named Alien Ant Farm covering a song off Bad, but let’s be honest: Smooth Criminal is perfect as a rock song. Well, I’m not sure if these dudes have vocals as suited for the chorus as Jackson’s were, but this is still a pleasant surprise. Now I can listen to Smooth Criminal without feeling skeeved out.

**feldya** (8): A great reimagining of an MJ song, hits hard.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Of course there’s a rock/metal version of Smooth Criminal. It actually works a lot better than I expected.

**tapdancingpig** (8): This is the version of the song I know best. It’s iconic as fuck and I love it.

**vapourlomo** (8): Kind of a back-handed compliment, but this has to be the GOAT nu-metal song (exempting Linkin Park, of course)

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): ayuwoki

**radiofan15** (7.5): Annie found unbothered... also MICHAEL IS INNOCENT THE LEAVING NEVERLAND GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF VULTURES AND LIARS

**enecks** (7): So doofy it's good, with a great take on a great instrumental

**ManofOranges** (7): The first time I heard this song I was actually appalled. While I still kind of am whenever I hear it, I've kinda learned to embrace the song for what it is. It is a cover of smooth criminal after all which is just a great song so obviously some of that greatness is gonna carry over.

**MrSwearword** (7): it's not a bad cover per se, but it's not exceptional against the field.

**sbb618** (7): Never got the appeal of this cover.

**Steelstepladder** (7): Certainly better than it should be

**rosecoloreds** (6.5): honestly this is the only rock cover that matters

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): well at least its not a BORING cover, i'll give it that

**RetardedNinja35** (6.2): I prefer this version over the original MJ one, but still don’t really enjoy it much

**realboxwood** (6): As a member of the LGBT community I’m legally obligated to say that the Glee version outsold

#...MEDIOCRITY

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): I still can’t believe they tried releasing The Movies three times

**static\_int\_husp** (5): The fact that someone's best song is a worse version of an okay MJ song is kind of telling. Also solidifies my opinion that the early 2000s were a shit time for rock music.

**camerinian** (4): drywall on suicide watch

**kioescport** (4): I'm fully aware I only hate this because I know I'm supposed to, but that's never stopped me before and it won't now

**skaiansightseer** (4): we didn't need this

**rslashpoopheads** (3): we stan mediocre covers of mediocre songs

**ryjomom** (3): They got their one second of fame with a ‘00s rock cover of an ‘80s classic

**skargardin** (3): I just can’t with this cover

**slimboyfriend** (3): Negative two points because of the band and also it's bad, but five points because it's a Michael Jackson song and also kinda funny.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): I’m the type of person to be open to covers of iconic and legendary songs and I can get down with 2000s rock, but this really just makes me want to listen to the original. This nu metal version somehow lacks the energy and delivery in the chorus??? Like, the riff sounds obnoxious in this part and they really do sound like an amateur cover band. I much prefer the production on the original. Actually, I just much prefer everything in the original.

**agentofscranton** (1): michael jackson sweetie

**aulyve** (1): Ugh.

**Cherry\_Whine** (1): I hate this damn cover so much.

**elizakp** (1): I fucking hate this cover so much, it is a crime against my ears

**kappyko** (1): Any good part of this is from the original, and the chorus is done awfully

**nicknac4** (1): Is Annie okay? Lazy song

**junobeekeeper** (0): I always feel bad for one hit wonders who got famous through covers but this is just terrible

A cross between Hoobastank and a deep cut from the Twilight soundtracks, it's generic, Alex Band is oversinging the hell out of it, but you can't deny that chorus.

---

#WAY UP HIGH

**bespectacIed** (10): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic

**jolteonhoodie** (10): Alex Band's eyebrows are all I can focus on

**ManofOranges** (10): I like to imagine this song plays in the background as I reunite with the love of my life after we just had some tumultuous relationship troubles because he found out that I wasn't actually who I said I was and then we both sit in buildings and look out of windows contemplatingly but he comes back and then we realize we're meant for each other

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I prefer Charlene Soraia's version but this is still good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Nickelback who

**1998tweety** (9): Probably the emo-rock song I like the most in this rate, it's emotional impact is felt.

**ryjomom** (9): for some reason I’ll always have an appreciation for 2000s rock

**radiofan15** (8.5): Cute poppy rock ballad... they don't make them like this anymore

**ExtraEater** (7): pretty funny song

**feldya** (7): I liked this song when I was younger and it still has a great melody. I think I remember this the NHL playoff commercials during whatever year that was.

**slimboyfriend** (7): I know it's not, but this song sounds vaguely Christian

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Oh, yeah, it figures that we’d have to go and rate a radio rock song in this rate eventually. Damn you, Todd. I agree with our guy’s assessment of this though: this is a really generic song, and the leader tries to sing way too soulfully for anything here to work as well as the band would hope, but those four chords end up saving everything. The subject matter is actually deeper than you’d expect, too! As somebody who dislikes music from the first half of the 00s because the airwaves were entrenched with this kind of shit, this is hardly the worst offender of its kind I can think of.

**realboxwood** (6.5): This is decidedly not good but I can’t pretend that 11 year old me wouldn’t have ate it up

**static\_int\_husp** (6): This sounds like any generic early 2000s rock. Amazing that they weren't able to get a second hit in that climate.

**tapdancingpig** (6): Serviceable.

#DOWN LOW

**camerinian** (5): wow, radio filler becoming rate filler. The circle of life in action

**enecks** (5): To another song

**vapourlomo** (5): Ugh those vocals...

**ImADudeDuh** (4): its fine

**kioescport** (4): A true early 2000s radio classic that somehow has endured? Sure it's not as bad as The Reason by Hoobastank but I also kind of never want to hear this again.

**junobeekeeper** (3.6): I thought this was deep when I was 8

**aulyve** (3): Did someone dare him to sing like that.

**saucymac** (3): god this song is insufferable

**skaiansightseer** (3): this is christian rock, right??

**Steelstepladder** (2): That singing man...

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): god i hate hate HATE this bland radio rock from the late 90s/early 00s they all sound the same and they all sound like ASS

**MrSwearword** (1): because it has one thing going for it; that being that Todd read the fuck out of this song and I lived

**elizakp** (0): THIS SONG IS THE WOOORST

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (0): Annoyingly too catchy, I hate that hook, I hate that man’s voice, I hate these lyrics, I hate everything to do with this song

Picture Mr. Said Fred shirtless, hatless, walking down the street (because he's too sexy to be holed up in a car), gyrating in front of nearby cats, begging his lover not to leave him before getting hauled away by the NYPD. Iconic.

PS This is better voguing music than Vogue

---

#too sexy to hate


**sbb618** (10): There's this undercurrent of sarcasm in this song, that Right Said Fred know just how ridiculous they're being, and that really makes it all better.

**vapourlomo** (10): Poor pussycat :(

**junobeekeeper** (8.4): Sometimes a girl has to listen to this on repeat to cope!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): actually not terrible or i have terrible taste

**1998tweety** (8): This is a really weird song and it's kind of not that great but I'm also living for it.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): such a fucking meme that I can't help but like it.


**MrSwearword** (8): I mean, taking satirical aim at male models is a low bar to set but the song's still something of a tacky slay

**realboxwood** (8): This is one of those one hit wonders where it feels impossible to rate it as an actual song as opposed to like, a cultural institution


**Lagozzino** (7): Even if you're not gay, you are gay for the duration of this song. That's just how it is.


**SpanKKy1** (6): can't relate


#too sexy to love



**Steelstepladder** (4): I'm never going to listen to this song in my life on my own


**slimboyfriend** (3.5): I remember this hitting harder.

#TAYLOR


**tapdancingpig** (8): OH! Look what you made me do. Look what you made me do. Look what you just made me do look what you just made me do.

**ManofOranges** (8): this is a hit I can see why Taylor used this in look what you made me do


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Insert Taylor Swift meme

**rosecoloreds** (3.5): taylor swift invented right said fred

**enecks** (1): "Look What You Made Me Do" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 24, 2017 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from her sixth studio album Reputation (2017). Swift wrote and produced the song with her co-producer Jack Antonoff. "Look What You Made Me Do" is an electroclash and pop song,[2] with lyrics about various issues that built Swift's reputation.

**ryjomom** (1): Look What You Made Me Do did it first


**CarlieScion** (5): [insert obvious taylor swift joke here]

**aulyve** (4): Taylor Swift joke.

**hikkaru** (4): i don't like your little games don't like your tilted stage


**yourhostandpatron** (7): Haha, Look What You Made Me Do, guys, am I right? I do actually think Look What You Make Me Do is more interesting this song, though. Maybe not necessarily better, but, ah, who cares? To be honest, I was expecting Right Said Fred to be really annoying, but I actually like the guy’s British accent, and this is suprisingly well produced. It still makes me feel weird, and it’s nothing more than a novelty hit, but in the grand scheme of things there’s certainly worse one hit wonders in the world.

**radiofan15** (6.5): Obligatory Taylor Swift Comment

**RetardedNinja35** (6.2): Such a silly song but you can’t really hate it unlike it’s rip off ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ which is just plain terrible

**napsandnetflix** (6): look what you made me do did it better

Wall of Voodoo have some great music and I can totally see why they have the cult following they do (stream Call of the West, the album). But this ain't one of them, just 4 minutes of "lol Mexico". Then again, I like their Ring of Fire cover, so maybe I just have bad taste.

---

#\#resist

**camerinian** (10): I found the album this song was on in a vinyl bargain bin for $2 and since then I have had an inexplicable fondness for it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We stan a song that includes mexican culture! Whew!

**Steelstepladder** (9): Genuinely weird songs that are just unapologetically weird are the best

**sbb618** (8): Weird clash between the tone and the subject matter

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Wait, no, another new wave band? You have to be joking, right? Sigh...combining the endless amount of 80s synths in this rate and the sheer cloud of novelty some songs in it are clouded in, Mexican Radio is just fine. The lead singer is not a handsome hunk with a clear voice, which is kind of why the song comes off across as a bit of a joke, but this can be pretty fun, and there’s way more boring and intolerable stuff from new wave that you can afford not to listen to. Let’s all eat barbecued iguana, everyone!

**junobeekeeper** (6.7): it's goofy

**1998tweety** (6.5): Meh

#Trump did nothing wrong

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Popheads when they hear Despacito

**enecks** (4): Play a radio station from Mexico instead

**MrSwearword** (4): this is just subpar

**napsandnetflix** (1): maybe the wall made points

**radiofan15** (1): Oh trust me this is not what a Mexican Radio station sounds like... I mean, is that harmonica part supposed to be Mariachi or Banda music? I HAVE TO FUCKING LAUGH YOU BUNCH OF BURGER-EATING SCHOOL-SHOOTING XENOPHOBIC CRACKERS

**Lagozzino** (6): Imagine if a dubstep mix of the Harry Potter theme became a top 10 platinum hit single. Think about it.


---

**agentofscranton** (10): i just love how dated and kitschy this feels - like i'm on a rundown cruise ship

**bespectacIed** (10): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm cackling at the idea of this actually topping the charts, but at least we know that people had taste back then

**MrSwearword** (10): mainly because I'm stunned this went #1 on the Hot 100 at all but to also point out that the 70s and Star Wars mania were fucking wild.

**skargardin** (10): slay my life

**SpanKKy1** (10): cured my testicular cancer

**tapdancingpig** (10): This reminds me of Disney’s Hollywood Studios, therefore it is perfect.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Ugh this dings in the millennium falcon

**waluigiest** (10): WTF IS THIS I LOVE IT

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Brings lightsabers onto the dance floor with a R2-D2 themed disco ball

**hikkaru** (9): john williams always gets my pussy popping and this remix most definitely made some points

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the best meme song here

**sbb618** (8.5): Definitely liked this more than I thought I would.

**1998tweety** (8): Iconic

**enecks** (8): Is this good? Is this bad? IDK. My score is picked based on my favourite star wars movie

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Oh, haha, so this was an actual phenomenon? Making classical compositions into disco music was something that actually happened more than once? A Fifth of Beethoven wasn’t just a one-off thing? This rate is teaching me so many things, even if it’s forcing me to hand out an abnormal number of 8s. This is a bit of a novelty hit, but it’s a nice reminder of the days when Star Wars hype was young and nerd culture becoming mainstream was beginning to pop up for the first time. It’s also a nice reminder of the days when Star Wars wasn’t affected by SJWs and feminazis, amirite? Haha. I’m going to stab myself now. Thanks for coming.

**junobeekeeper** (7.5): I unironically love this song but I can't justify rating it any higher

**ImADudeDuh** (7): lmao fucking nerds

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): wtf!?!?

**feldya** (6.5): This whole album is a fun disco version of Star Wars, but if I want disco I'm reaching for a lot of other albums before I grab this.

**ryjomom** (6): Sounds like my 6th grade band being forced to play Star Wars for our nerdy/creepy band director.

**Steelstepladder** (6): this certainly does exist

**camerinian** (5): I suppose being the most novelty of hits in a rate full of novelty hits is worth a mention, but like, you'd need a very, very specific feeling of irony to boogie to this nowadays

**Cherry\_Whine** (5): A really gimmicky, dated, forgettable piece of disco-era cash-cow cheese. But it’s Star Wars music! And it’s iconic.

**napsandnetflix** (5): star wars is for nerds

**rslashpoopheads** (5): you tried

**skaiansightseer** (5): i prefer the Dr. Who disco version, honestly

**vapourlomo** (4): '70s kitsch is so not my thing. John Williams deserved better.

**realboxwood** (3): R2D2 is a main pop girl

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (3): I’m not sure why this exists and I hate it

**slimboyfriend** (2.5): I've never seen a Star Wars movie and now I never will

**elizakp** (2): IDGI

**kioescport** (2): This is one of the lamest things I've ever heard, and I just listened to Party all the Time by Eddie Murphy.

**LuckyKidA** (2): i'm a star wars fan but

**nicknac4** (1.9): this has always been on my shit list so I am biased here

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.2): not even disco can save this

**radiofan15** (1): John Williams sweetie I'm so sorry...

**aulyve** (0): Shut the fuck up.

Insert Ariana joke here. Oh wait, I did.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ariana is fucking shaking

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Ariana Grande takes notes

**vapourlomo** (9): Is this problematic? Probably. Does it bang? Absolutely.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I really should be a little more critical of the title (actually, it’s kind of funny people used to think that this song was called Turning Japanese because your eyes squint when you jack off) but, wow, this is a bop and a half. It may be yet another new wave-ish band from the 80s carving out a niche for their own again, but those bands are some of the best in this rate, and The Vapors fulfill their role well. Though, to be honest, I am getting a little tired of these bands at this point. I hope I won’t have to type this out again.

**camerinian** (8): i just really like new wave ok i’m putting all the problematic shit to one side let me just ignore it for this little bit nothing else in the rate is this fast ok

**jolteonhoodie** (8): This song is great but okay I just discovered Kirsten Dunst's cover of this and??? What did I just watch??

**skaiansightseer** (8): big chaotic evil energy

**Steelstepladder** (8): Underrated guitar work here

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is decent...y'all are gonna drag it for the title though, I know it

**feldya** (7.5): The second song on this list to feature the "oriental riff" but this one has a little more to keep me more interested.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): But ten out of ten as a guitar hero song.

**ryjomom** (7): ARIANA GRANDE

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Me-“What does this song mean?” Google it’s-“...Oh that’s not what I was expecting”

**MrSwearword** (6): the song knocks but masturbation fodder with a title like Turning Japanese is really fucking stupid [especially when you consider that "turning Japanese" is supposed to mean that you jack off so hard your dick just vanishes or becomes smaller which what the fuck]

**aulyve** (4): Homeboy on the cover art looks like a Bill Hader SNL character. Anyway this song is pretty overrated and the oriental riff (two of these in one rate!!!) does it no favours.

**hikkaru** (4): Ariana Grande - thank u, next (2019)

**letsallpoo** (4): -pounds gavel- PROBLEMATIC!!!!

**tapdancingpig** (4): Not in love with the song to begin with, but also... that title line. I don’t know what it was supposed to mean, but I do know that it’s not good.

**waluigiest** (3): not feeling this

**realboxwood** (2): I know just saying yikes is overdone by this point but… yikes

**rslashpoopheads** (2): um

**static\_int\_husp** (2): Ok, Google, show me "The whitest possible song that could ever have the name Turning Japanese"

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): hmm

**enecks** (1): Ew, just ew.

This and Lullaby were both in competition for spot #55. This won out because at least the lyrics aren't as condescending. 

---

#Do you feel it too?

**bespectacIed** (10): *mariah voice* that was a classic, that was a classic

**SpanKKy1** (10): getting me some type of way

**feldya** (9.5): I'm a sucker for a big voice, vocal harmonies, and a key change in the last chorus. Vocal blue notes get me too ("feeeeeel it tooo" as the response in the chorus).

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9.5): Oí this band’s quite good what the heck.

**camerinian** (9): This song is so fucking wholesome, like it's nowhere near as pushy as most of these straight ballads are, it's just got an air of bright eyed hopefulness and ain't that sweet???

**nicknac4** (9): cute

**sbb618** (8): Low-key, but I like it.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Acoustic guitars have been the biggest fear of practically any music fan ever since the start of the century (I suspect Change The World ruined the fun for all of us, even though that’s not really an acoustic guitar song. Still, it’s so close), and To Be With You is a sad reminder of when the instrument wasn’t so loathed. It’s yet another bizarre stop in the fascinating lineup this rate has to offer (a hair metal band? really) and I probably won’t listen to it again, but it’s inoffensive in a definition of the word that isn’t too damning. It’s pretty comfy, and it leaves you just as home, which is as much as I suspect it can do.

**1998tweety** (7): This is kind of nice, but also not my cup of tea.

**Steelstepladder** (7): Cute little song for hair metals last gasp

**ImADudeDuh** (6): something I can see Shawn Mendes covering in the future

**LuckyKidA** (6): 1989-1991 were the equivalent of the awkward teenage years for mainstream rock and pop

**ManofOranges** (6): This song sounds pretty cliche and also the key change is probably the weakest one I've heard in any song like I thought key changes were supposed to be more impactful than that???

**ryjomom** (6): Reminds me of Sesame Street or Reading Rainbow ¯_(ツ)_///¯

#I waited on a line of greens and blues for THIS?

**kappyko** (5): i was soe xcited but this is quite schmaltzy

**skargardin** (5): i sleep

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Honestly this is pretty boring

**junobeekeeper** (4.5): Ballads like this are never my thing but the sentiment isn't terrible.

**realboxwood** (4.5): Hoo boy do the opening lines of “Hold on little girl / Show me what he’s done to you” sound like they’re setting up a COMPLETELY different song

**Cherry\_Whine** (4): One of the least inspired additions to the catalogue of “metal band hits number one with a big ballad in the late 80s/early 90s songs”.

**enecks** (4): My score for this isn't very big

**rslashpoopheads** (4): trite

**tapdancingpig** (4): I really love the hook... I just wish it didn’t have these lyrics.

**radiofan15** (2.5): That trend most of those rock bands from the 80s had in which they would release a hard lead single followed by a poppy ballad was truly the worst thing ever... glad it died

**aulyve** (2): Almost considered bumping this to a 3 but the final "ooooh" convinced me otherwise.

**elizakp** (2): This blows

**vapourlomo** (2): Hard pass. If I want a hair metal ballad, I'll take the ones where they actually plug in their guitars.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): someone stop corny straight men

**MrSwearword** (1): oh puke, this fucking nonsense

**skaiansightseer** (0): simultaneously disgustingly horny and skin-crawlingly sexless

Dolby's music kinda has a cinematic flair to it, he's great at just invoking a mood with his music, whether it be here or on "One of Our Submarines" or "White City". No surprise he ended up doing soundtracks. I just don't think he put it to good use on this song, a vague collection of science not-even-jokes on top of a admittedly pretty catchy synth riff.

---

#Alchemy

**junobeekeeper** (10): I'm happy this exists. It's silly.

**kappyko** (10): okay but the melody of its POETRY IN MOTION is the greatest of all time

**MrSwearword** (10): campy wondiferousness

**1998tweety** (9): Ugh the power that science has....I know this will get robbed though because a lot of you are gay and hate STEM

**waluigiest** (9): weird and funky, that one synth break is so tasty

**aulyve** (8): Shoutout Ms. Sakamoto one of the OG music video baddies.

**ManofOranges** (8): Me during chemistry when I chose not to wear my lab goggles because they leave that ugly mark around my eyes that people make fun of you for as if they don't get the same mark around their eyes when they wear those lab goggles and instead they're above all that and then my lab partner ignites the bunsen burner and I wasn't prepared

**vapourlomo** (8): Bill Nye voice Science rules!

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I’m not really a fan of this song as a lone musical work (again, I’m pretty tired of new wave at this point) but pretty much everything else about it is really interesting, if I’m being honest. Thomas Dolby has had quite the fascinating, unusual career, and Magus Pike’s cameo on this is not only amusing, but also sort of a rabbit hole for me. The guy was first cousins with Geoffrey Pike, who was an unusual inventor with a pretty tragic life that I’ve looked up. I encouraged you to read about him. For science! Sort of a novelty, but way more entertaining than this rate’s other novelties.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): pretty aight

**sbb618** (7.5): ...I don't know how to summarize my opinion of this song. It's a clusterfuck of tones, genres,

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): cheesy bop

**enecks** (7): Dolby is so conceptual and ambitious, why did the 80's equivalent of a meme song have to be his hit.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): goofy af

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): I believe this music video is the reason I like Asian people, I saw this like a hundred times when I was younger.

**skaiansightseer** (7): it's no "weird science" but it still GOES

**realboxwood** (6.5): Earlier in the rate I gave Butterfly by Crazy Town basically a 7, and now every time I give something less than a 7 I have to personally grapple with the fact that I’m giving the song a lower score than Butterfly by Crazy Town. I never claimed to have taste

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Me when a woman points a laser at my eye

#forgot the safety goggles

**RetardedNinja35** (5.5): Does anyone actually listen to this and genuinely like it?

**Steelstepladder** (5): Once you listen to it once you kind of get the joke

**ryjomom** (4): God out of all the subjects of academia science is the most blinding. Yikes

**camerinian** (3): hAhA tHiS iS sO QuIrKy

**yourhostandpatron** (11): Fuck, yes. Sorry, Monster Mash, but this is what I think a Halloween song actually should be. I don’t know who Arthur Brown is, because I may or may not have been paying attention to Todd, but everything about this song is so...spooky, and I’m referring to that in all the right ways. That deep baritone announcing what it’s all about? The mysticism? The threatening vocals? All of those things make for one amazing romp. If magic exists, this is what it should be all about: the spectacle and the performance, making something totally crazy have a real effect. And under that criteria, Fire is *bewitching*.

**camerinian** (10): I'm not even remotely a classic metal fan (if that's what you wanna call this), but I do dig 60's psych, and holy shit i can totally see myself in the 60's getting high out of my mind and losing my shit hearing this. It's such a fucking journey, and the way it climaxes in that fucking psychotic breakdown and then the HORNS OMG

**enecks** (10): Stream Exmilitary. (Death Grips needs to be rated on popheads tbh)

**kappyko** (10): LIZZY MERCIER DESCLOUX OUTSOLD BUT THIS SLAYS this is definitely bottom 10

**realboxwood** (10): Disney villains everywhere are shook

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): we stan an unhinged bop

**ExtraEater** (9): Fun!

**moooo566** (9): the bit where he wears the fire bucket really makes it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I’ve actually only heard The Prodigy’s sample of this but this is great too

**kioescport** (8.5): I think I respect this more than I like it, but with that opening how can I not give this the high praise it deserves.

**aulyve** (8): Lizzy Mercier Descloux has a sick (maybe better?) cover of this.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): he like, legitimately might've snapped. like his brain is broken now

**sbb618** (8): Oh hey, it's that song Skinner was playing on his car radio in Hot Fuzz

**slimboyfriend** (8): Of all the songs on the list, this one is a real outlier.

**Steelstepladder** (8): It's just awesome

**tapdancingpig** (7): What the fuck...

**jolteonhoodie** (6.5): I had no idea how to rate this song

**junobeekeeper** (6.2): Not to sound like a music snob, but this song just doesn't live up to the Lizzy Mercier Descloux cover.

**1998tweety** (6): It's eh I guess, not a huge fan of anything part of this besides the trumpets.

#oh god it burns

**roxieloxie** (5.7): I’m screaming what’s happening

**MrSwearword** (5): another case of ambition being far greater than output

**skaiansightseer** (5): This is like the 5th best song called "Fire" released during the Vietnam war.

**vapourlomo** (5): The greatest opening four seconds in music history. After that...eh.

**RetardedNinja35** (4.6): ‘I AM THE GOD OF HELLFIRE.’ Probably the only good part of the song and it’s over in a couple of seconds.

**Cherry\_Whine** (4): Pretty standard fair by late-60s psychedelic rock, it gets points for being unique but looses some by being pretty irritating.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): wat dis

**radiofan15** (2.3): In the immortal words of Michael from Grand Theft Auto V, "what is this bullshit?"

**feldya** (2): A little weird and noisy, I think I don't get this song.

#People who want the world to be a better place

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): YOU GOT WHAT I NEEED

**ExtraEater** (10): Important song for determining if you have emotions

**ImADudeDuh** (10): YOU!

**MrSwearword** (10): one of the most beloved songs on Earth with good reason, it slays.

**sbb618** (10): This song is so damn cheesy and I love it all. There's a half-dozen lines that should derail the whole song, and yet they don't. Nobody beats the Biz.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): A rap song that everyone can sing at karoke. I genuinely love this song even if it's not very good musically. I can just belt it out and feel so good.

**Steelstepladder** (10): I hope people don't do this masterpiece dirty

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://i.imgur.com/weOCOKg.jpg

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9.8): It’s rampantly incompetent but IT GOT WHAT I NEEEED

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this song got what i need

**RetardedNinja35** (9.1): Good funny joke song, but the ‘Yo Mama’ jokes at the start of the video are terrible.

**camerinian** (9): If you don’t fuck with Biz, I don’t fuck with you

**realboxwood** (9): Pure poetry

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is going to be voted out quickly, but I love this song deeply. It’s dumb, but the hook sticks and it’s adorable.

**vapourlomo** (9): Poor Biz :(

**skaiansightseer** (8): quotables!

**elizakp** (7): Classic silly rap

**kioescport** (7): This is absolutely horrible, but that's kind of the charm isn't it?

**radiofan15** (6.9): This is better than anticipated... not for me but I don't hate it

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the original friend zone anthem?

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (6): Look it’s a joke song and Biz Markie brings a lot of passion and on some level I can appreciate it, I just don’t particularly enjoy how bad it sounds

**ryjomom** (6): The storytelling lmao

**yourhostandpatron** (6): It makes sense that this is comedy rap, because this is comically bad. Haha! Get it? Okay, I’ll stop. Apparently a few people see this as one of the greatest hip hop one-hit wonders of all time, and I...don’t really get it (it sounds like a modern meme song made in the 80s) but I can at the very least appreciate the fact that Biz Markie has had quite the surprisingly illustrious career. This is ridiculous, but, hey, at least it’s fun.

#People who want the world to be a worse place

**aulyve** (5): Man I have to respect anything that treads the line between being beautiful and garbage so recklessly even if I'll never listen to it again.

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is just so cheesy and also the singing during the chorus kinda doesn't sound good

**slimboyfriend** (5): I can hear his spit hitting the mic

**TragicKingdom1** (5): good melody but everything else is painful

**jolteonhoodie** (4.8): It makes me laugh and the chorus is fun to sing but God I wouldn't ever choose to listen to this

**junobeekeeper** (3.2): It's... eh.

**hikkaru** (3): don't really like this guy's voice

**nicknac4** (3): I noticed his album is 'Best of Biz Markie', does that consist of this one song over and over?

**rslashpoopheads** (3): is this whole rate just gonna be Garageband covers/samples of good songs?

**enecks** (1): We're rating this and not Mmmbop? Wouldn't have made that decision if I was able to cohost

**Lagozzino** (1): The chorus is fun the first time you hear it and gets exponentially more grating with each repetition.

**1998tweety** (0): There's nothing inherently wrong with comedy music but this...this is pretty bad

**waluigiest** (0): i have a viscerally negative reaction to hearing this song

So judging by the view count and comments on his other videos (the word "genius" and variants come up a lot), Falco's still pretty beloved in Germany. But "beloved" can mean a lot of things. His music is all so silly on its face that I can't see where the Bowie comparisons are coming from. Maybe Queen makes more sense? A kickass musical act that's not a joke but isn't taken *too* seriously either. Todd's comparison of this track to Gangnam Style was very apt.

sbb618 is right by the way, the  Salieri Mix is A+

#FRAUEN LIEBTEN SEINEN PUNK

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay i had this weird obsession with this song in like 6th grade and would literally listen to that 8 minute long mix on repeat for hours

**enecks** (10): This was nearly my "fuck you all" 11. Still, this is amazingly over the top fun, with the best key change of the 80s.

**MrSwearword** (10): weird 80s camp done right

**skargardin** (10): i fucking love this song

**vapourlomo** (10): AMADEUS AMADEUS

**ExtraEater** (9): Flawless riff

**Lagozzino** (9): One of the all time great camp classics. I don't care that it would make no sense, I would kill to have this as a Lip Sync For Your Life on Drag Race.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): doctor zaius! doctor zaius!

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This goes way harder than it has any right to

**kappyko** (8): A mess, a beautiful mess

**nicknac4** (8): the intro really dragged this baby down but the synths are gr8

**Osaka1268** (8): This sounds like a Eurovision song and I love it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Yeah I listen to classical music,

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is very very weird--but I think I'm living for it a bit?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I appreciate the Amadeus -> Imma dance but the song is a little too choppy for my liking

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Another immediately recognized name in this rate that I expected to be amazing. Sadly, it isn’t. I have no doubt this will score high, and I’m betting that I’m just bitter over the fact that I was assigned Austria in the Eurovision rate (a moment of silence for Kaphox) only for the song I picked to be judged as an Avril Lavigne ripoff and to flop terribly. Then again, I have friends in Austria, so I can’t say I really dislike Rock Me Amadeus. Actually, as a meme, it’s pretty much quality gold. The only reason I’m not giving it a higher score is because it suffers from the same curse that prevents Let’s Dance from being a truly fantastic David Bowie album; it’s just a part of the title vocalized by a deep baritone over a thumping beat, and it’s fun, but it’s not all that great. Leider!

**letsallpoo** (7): mission compree

**ManofOranges** (7): I have no idea what this song is about but it sounds pretty good

**sbb618** (7): If this was the Salieri Mix, it would be an easy 10, and possibly even the 11. It's just better in every way, so much so that listening to the original is a disappointment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrBGbyTEK44

**Steelstepladder** (7): Chorus is undeniable. Not one of my faves though

**camerinian** (6.5): I really like driving to this at night, so long as you tune out the wonky Deutschlish crossover lyrics, the weird hiccuping and the fact that this is about fucking Mozart of all things

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I'll give it some extra points because the German sounds really nice

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Either this song is in German or I got a contact high on the bus when I was listening to it.

**junobeekeeper** (6.3): It's fun?

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Catchy as fuck but like it’s also aggressively okay.

**realboxwood** (6): I really like the parts where it doesn’t sound like he’s choking on his own tongue, at least

#ICH SPRECHE KEIN DEUTSCH

**radiofan15** (5.5): Tom Hulce and Milos Forman outsold this flops, be sure to stream the director's cut of Amadeus for clean skin and high grades

**Cherry\_Whine** (4): Falco seems like a very irritating man. Maybe I can’t appreciate his German rapping because I’m an American mutt but this whole song drips with an aimless beat and banal lyrics. I’d rather listen to “Der Komissar”.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this guy stutters like me when a hot guy asks me anything

**ryjomom** (4): ScheiBe

**SpanKKy1** (4): get ur hands off me u dirty ape

**waluigiest** (4): um

**aulyve** (2): Funny to listen to this guy rap as if he's constantly on the verge of throwing up but it's not, like, a good song.

**rosecoloreds** (0): i absolutely HATE this song i don't get it and i don't want to amadeus mozart didn't die for falco to record this GARBAGE

I accidentally put this one in the main rate but decided to just roll with it because rating the  Monster Mash would be funny. And it holds up pretty well! I still wouldn't want to listen it to it more than once a year, but it's not a song that you dread when it comes around and that's more than what can be said about some other songs in this rate.

---
**napsandnetflix** (11): my friends have this game where we always try to get this song played anywhere we are so like we'll be at a wedding in april and try to get the DJ to play it or a bar in august and try and tbh they play it way more than they should and it's the funniest shit everytime they do it. Anyways main pop girl Bob Boris Pickett didn't have to snap so hard on this, and yet he went ahead and made this graveyard SMASH ugh

**1998tweety** (10): iconic timeless bop

**Cherry\_Whine** (10): I hear this every year at Halloween. Then again, everyone does. Somehow, it’s never irritating and always a please to revisit after twelve months have passed. I know I’ve gotten drunk with my friends and fought over who got to sing the lead vocal and who got to do the “awoooos” for the background.

**ExtraEater** (10): It doesn't matter what month it is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A comedy legend, a spooky legend, and A BOP LEGEND!

**MrSwearword** (10): legendtinta

**rosecoloreds** (10): ultimate halloween song

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**SpanKKy1** (10): invented halloween i guess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**nicknac4** (9): the only Halloween song, nothing else exists. My Halloween playlist consists of just this song

**sbb618** (9): I liked Leo Karpatze's version better.

**elizakp** (8): One of the best halloween songs

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the original spooky song

**Steelstepladder** (8): out of all the obvious novelties in this rate, this is probably my favorite

**junobeekeeper** (7.2): Kitschy Halloween songs are always welcome in my book.

**Osaka1268** (7): This is so dumb and I can't help but love it

**waluigiest** (7): now this is camp

**yourhostandpatron** (7): This feels weird. I’ve been wondering why Halloween music isn’t a genre on its own like Christmas music is for awhile and throughout all that time, I’ve never even knew this song existed. I mean, I guess it really isn’t that popular, considering it hasn’t cracked the charts in over thirty years, but, well...Thriller not being in a class of its own is strange, you know? As a novelty hit, I think that the Monster Mash is pretty well made for a 60s song, even though the lack of modern production and sound effects on it prevents me from really getting into what it’s trying to do. Despite that, Bob Pickett actually does a really swell Boris Karkaroff impression, and it makes the song have a wholesome aura to it that makes it more memorable than it would have been otherwise. Pickett seems like he was a great guy, in general. He even died at 69. What a legend!

**camerinian** (6.5): The whole phenomenon of the Monster Mash is bizarre to me, because it seems like it's almost exclusively an American staple??? Like, it's strange that this hasn't crossed over whatsoever to seemingly any other anglo-centric country, and I don't know why, because frankly it's eons better than 90% of Christmas music that we do get saddled with from the States.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): legendary eyebrow man

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): halloween bop but not worth listening to outside october

**enecks** (6): Corny, but Halloween is an exception card

**roxieloxie** (6): *insert monster fuckers joke *

**RetardedNinja35** (5.7): Would’ve been better as a shorter 2-minute song.

**feldya** (5.5): I like the song but I never want to hear it outside of a Halloween party so that harms the score here.

**hikkaru** (5.5): these novelty hits are really hard to rate tbh like this is catchy but also i just... can't stand how corny it is

**jolteonhoodie** (5.5): I'd like it way more if it was only a minute song but as it is, it overstays its welcome

**aulyve** (5): If your Halloween playlist doesn't have this on then it is literally worth less than shit.

**vapourlomo** (5): This is fun for about 45 seconds and then the joke gets old

**RealRainbowinHeaven** (4): Not horror-core enough for me

**ryjomom** (3): Cute, but only for 1 day out of the year.

**static\_int\_husp** (3): probably would be my 0 if Rednex wasn't also here

**radiofan15** (2): Novelty trash... imagine having just a hit but having THIS as said hit

**realboxwood** (2): Hot take, but 99% of holiday themed music is bad

**kioescport** (1): I had never heard this before and I never want to hear it again.
