**Bonus Rate**

* DJ Earworm - United State of Pop 2009 (Blame It on the Pop)

(Details on the bonus rate in the comments)
=================================================================================
=================================================================================
=================================================================================

ExtraEater: Before we start:

* If you’re wondering how the one-song bonus rate is going to go, it’ll be like this: **The DJ Earworm mashup will be revealed at the point it would be revealed if it was in the rate**, based on its average (so if it got a 6.382 average, it would be revealed once the rate gets to that point). There will be no warning beforehand, so watch out! It could be revealed any day! Maybe even today!

* Because we didn’t want to task our graphic designers with making images for 100 songs, and most importantly because we just wanted to, each song will come with a complementary SpongeBob image. Here’s one example: [Kid Cudi - Day ‘n’ Nite](https://i.imgur.com/cfgLTna.png). These will all be compiled together at the end of the rate!

* The post for each song will include their original position on the Year-End chart and how it changed.

* [Don't forget this video Dude made](https://youtu.be/xZb86Ztjtwo)

* To honor the [Billboard 2012 Rate](https://redd.it/55d7wa) (and [Results](https://redd.it/5e0f3m)) held about two years back, we'll do two small tributes to the rate on Day 3 and 4. Stay tuned for that!

**ExtraEater**: This is such an utterly mind-numbing void of music and enjoyment that on first listen I genuinely thought I was listening to an overlong six-minute song when it's just three minutes and forty one seconds. The autotune here haunts my nightmares, but I will be 100% honest when I say the "Ether boy!" lyric that opens this song up is quite catchy and the rest of the song is honestly kinda catchy too. This song honestly DID grow on me as February and March went on, hence why I gave it an 8. I blame Stockholm syndrome, for hosting this rate has kept me hostage in 2009 for far too long. Anyway, check out the giant essay in the comments below. You'll probably find it much more entertaining than this song.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song was the lowest song for basically the entire rate. It never left the bottom 3 after the first 5 scores came in. But let's be real, is that such a surprise? This song sounds like what a 2010 sitcom episode would make when it was revealed that a white character had a rap career that failed after one song.

#Literally the appeal of SOPHIE, especially the first sentence

**enecks** (10): This is so bad that it allows me to see into other dimensions of existence. I see better dimensions. Life is good. So this is a 10. Rhythm, flow, tune - none of those matter. What matters is a glimpse of other worlds. The other worlds offer hope. Getting closer to them is getting closer to a fundamental truth on life itself. This is a funeral march for reason. To even understand this song, one must reject earthly logic and embrace a stream of consciousness. The capitalist vices of this song are a reminder of what must be moved beyond. There is some monk somewhere who has ascended to demigod status by listening to this on loop. I will be the second one. It makes sense that nobody involved had more hits going on - after being a vessel for such a provocative revelation to the value of existence, it makes sense they'd be a bit tired. This song opened my third eye and gave be a second heart to pump the blood to my brain in a futile attempt to understand this. Forget 60's rock, this is the true psychadelic music. Yet, this isn't a drug high (ironically for a song revolving around a drug). This is lasting... spiritual in its vulgar beauty. I looked at a mirror of me in another world. She was a beautiful woman. I want to make that world mine. We must make the best world together. For humanity has potential for good that must be popped open like a fine champagne.

#We popping the BIGGEST bottles

**radiofan15** (10): This song played Hide & Seek better than Anne Frank... it still slaps after all this years

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): somehow we are rating jim jones before donna summer

**kappyko** (7): remember the chromaticism in pop music post on the subreddit? is this chromatic???? i love how off-kilter this is but it's like weirdly so not a hit. i have to give points for the damn gall of them releasing this song as is.

**frogaranaman** (6): Wild production.

#I'm a pophead, and I'm an alcoholic

**gannade** (6): what is this?

**1998tweety** (5): this is not very good

**jamesfog** (5): Eww

**pearllouise** (5): Make good choices, kids

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): I didn’t hate the autotune era of pop like some people really did but sometimes it’s just not used well and the autotune on this song is so ungodly grating

**Mysario** (3): auto-tune was a mistake

**Roxieloxie** (3): what is this lmao

**ariannagrandtitties** (2.1): oh my god just shut up

**CarlieScion** (2): no. no. i refuse.

**ReallyCreative** (2): yikes someone actually thought this was something worth releasing

**tapdancingpig** (2): The mixing on this song give me anxiety.

**twat\_brained** (2): there is precisely ONE (1) useful thing from this song, and that is the clip at 1:13 in the music video, which gave us an iconic GIF. Apart from that, Juelz' verse is not too bad, but Ron is altogether forgettable and Jim… I have no words.

**MrSwearword** (1): I forgot all about this and I remember why; this is trash. Especially when Jim Jones tries to make "10 roses and a few cold waters" sound soooooooooooooo hardcore. BYE

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): The most horrifying thing I experienced doing this rate backwards is realizing that there were worse songs in it than Pop Champagne. It’s a shame we have to contend with a potential 0 so early on in the chart. I don’t know who Jim Jones is, nor why his parents were okay with him being named after the most infamous cult leader of all time, but the Autotune on his forgotten little flop of a song here is so bloody annoying that it makes me wish I had a bottle of Kool-Aid right by my side. A complete disaster.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): AUTOTUNE AAAAAAAAAAAA

**ryjomom** (1): I honestly don’t know what is happening in this song. Reminds me of a Black Ops 2 music stage map, but I don’t know if that’s a good thing.

**TragicKingdom1** (1): i imagine this is what rap music sounds like to my dad

**waluigiest** (1): what the fuck I have nothing positive to say

**hikkaru** (0): what the fuck is this mess and how is there something worse than Diva in this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This song is a mess, how was it even popular? The singing is so bad even though there’s autotune and oh man it’s bad.

**MashLuke** (0): the mastering is terrible

**mms82** (0): oofa this song just hurts

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (0): wow this song is just obnoxious yikes

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): what the fuck is going the fuck on

**ExtraEater**: Anyone who thinks popular hip hop suffered a little at this point in pop music history (compared to say, today, where mostly good hip hop is dominating the popular landscape) may have a point, ignoring Kanye and Kid Cudi's crucial moody rap genesis: A bunch of subpar to above average T.I. songs are up higher, Flo Rida's mindless Dead or Alive cover is up higher (it's still very good though), Pitbull is beginning his meteoric rise up higher ("I Know You Want Me" and "Hotel Room Service" still very good though), heck we're in the era of Soulja Boy ("Crank That" and "Kiss Me" still very good though), and right now we're in the midst of this song. A fun romp (using this discreet section to say I like this song), at the very least, although that Miley Cyrus lyric can go. Everything else aside, this shit is NOT timeless.

**ImADudeDuh**: "Open up her legs, then filet mignon that pussy," "My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest/I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics," "I wish I could fuck every girl in the world," "Cause I got it all, shawty, tell me what you don't see?/I will fuck with all y'all," "And Wayne say, 'Pussy, pussy, pussy,'" [Verse 4: Gudda Gudda], "And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on/And Hilary can Rodham too," "In about three years, holla at me Miley Cyrus," "Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off," "I exchange V-cards with the retards." And yet, after ALL OF THESE LINES, the most ridiculous line is obvious... "Young Money, man, this shit so timeless"

#Comments about BedRock

**Mysario** (7): this isn't "BedRock"

**PuggleMaster** (6): If it ain't bedrock I don't want to hear it

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): it's no bedrock or lollipop

**vapourlomo** (4): Lol this is so messy that I actually kind of love it. Still doesn't have any moment as iconic as GROCERY BAG from BedRock, though.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Okay but where's Bed Rock?

#We like her!

**radiofan15** (10): A fucking classic in every sense of the word, I can't believe it wasn't bigger

**MashLuke** (8): fun

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): hooked on phonics sales rise 1000%

#Filet MigNAH

**1998tweety** (6.8): Where's Onika? Thank u next

**frogaranaman** (5): This song was ghost written by Sigma Alpha Phi.

**MrSwearword** (5): it still reeks of musical failure but the artists in general have done far far worse in the world than this

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): Anything I like about this song; I like in spite of itself because this song is a major yikes.

**tapdancingpig** (5): I’m sorry, but saying “I’d fuck that chick when she’s legal” is creepy as fuck. Miley, I hope you never run into Mack Maine.

**NotWith10000Men** (2): first few bars turned me off of it

**ariannagrandtitties** (1): boring

**CarlieScion** (1): this is so bad oh my god

**enecks** (1): I'd rather be punched by every girl in the world than listen to this song again. I definitely think every girl should give everyone involved in this a good kick in the nuts for this atrocious display of casual misogyny.

**pearllouise** (1): Should be called "Every Average Rap Man" thank god Nicki saved the day.

**Roxieloxie** (1): Theres so much wrong with this song i dont think i have enough time to unpack it all

**ryjomom** (1): Sounds like every other song

**selegend** (1): this is the generic rap and country section we’re approaching im guessin

**skargardin** (1): the hell was this?

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (1): gross

**TragicKingdom1** (1): and people wonder why lil wayne doesnt get respect from pop fans...........

**xxrandooxx** (1): not ALL girls

**DrunkHurricane** (0): this entire song is questionable but the lyric that stands out is "in about three years, Holla at me Miley Cyrus". Just yikes.

**jamesfog** (0): Don't remember this but I thought it was horrible so

**ManofOranges** (0): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNqN2xeUaxo

**nightjesus** (0): wtf that Miley Cyrus lyric dude no

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Oh, God, fuck this song. I don’t consider it the worst song in the rate because Lil Wayne’s corpse in the voice creaking out ‘I wish I cud fuck every girl in the worl. I wish I cud fuck every girl in the worl’ could be a meme in a entertainingly bad way, while there’s one song here (it’s Break Up, if you must know) that’s just painful and not at all chuckle-worthy, but even if this is hilariously awful it’s still pretty damn disgusting. Why are men like this? What motive could you possibly get to make a song like this aside from being shamefully horny? Hard pass.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (0): is... this a joke? it sounds like it's trying to be as bad as it can. and those lyrics...

**ReallyCreative** (0): the fact that this garbage is on the same rate as songs like Poker Face, Party in the USA, Halo, and really every other song on the rate is such a crime.

**twat\_brained** (0): Lil Wayne might be the worst thing to ever happen to hip hop. Also is that a cheap lesbian joke? God, Drake just delivers disappointment after disappointment. More importantly, let's talk about this song. This is perhaps the purest example of the sexism issue in hip-hop. "In about three years holla at me Miley Cyrus" I want to vomit. There are many contenders for a zero, but these lyrics are just plain offensive. These men should be careful what they wish for; they may end up fucking their own parents or grandparents or sisters. And there's no way they wouldn't contract AIDS from their conquest. I don't know what else to say, I'm just appalled. I hope the next song I listen to is a redeeming one.

**waluigiest** (0): bedrock did it better. There is no part of this that isn’t horrible. The raps have no flow, the wordplay is not there. This song’s got it all….. statutory rape, homophobia, ablest slurs, general objectification….

(yes I know the last comment mentions BedRock too)

**ExtraEater**: Okay, this is one of the times where I have to defend male-fronted country pop even more fervently than I usually would, and for a song that doesn't completely deserve it. For the record, I genuinely enjoy this song in spite of how terrible those lyrics are, because the instrumental is honestly good, proving to be quite relaxing and rather evocative of a nice rural sunset (the lyrics even talk about this) that I can't hate this, not even a little bit. Plus, it's just Aldean having a pretty good time with his girl, even if having a good time means indulging in a really stupid metaphor. I'll just pretend like this song really is about a big green tractor.

**ImADudeDuh**: Is this song really worthy of a 10? No. Is it good? probably not. Did I give this song a 10 because of the meme factor? Yes. Are you able to do anything about it? No you ain't bitch! Plus, this song was guaranteed bottom 5 anyway from the title alone. Also, Jason Aldean is pretty easily the worst country star right now. Plus, he [put on blackface before](https://images.tmz.com/2015/11/10/1110-jason-aldean-black-face-lil-wayne-nashvillegab-01-1200x630.jpg) so he's cancelled sis.

#Mechanophiliacs

**mms82** (10): I love this song. I know its like the lampooned song of modern country but its so sweet and Aldean's voice is amazing. great song

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): [if you think this is the best song about tractors and sex, im here to tell you that it fails in comparison to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWu4aynBK7E)

**moooo566** (9): yeehaw

**Mysario** (9): a cute Country bop by the man who later made the cursed trap song "Burnin It Down"

**ryjomom** (7.9): Catchy and the sexual pleasure of riding a tractor?

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Strangely, out of all the country at the bottom of this chart, I actually really enjoy Big Green Tractor. I’m nowhere near thinking it’s a masterpiece or anything, but you know what? I have no idea who this Jason fella is but his voice is actually really warm and cozy and pretty pleasant to my ears, and even if Big Green Tractor never reaches any high points that make it an amazing song, it’s done enjoyably enough to the point where I can forget it’s called Big Green Tractor. I’m just happy I’m finding country songs in this rate I actually like.

**gannade** (7): this isnt bad

**poppinmmolly** (7): yee, and I cannot stress this enough, haw.

**rickikardashian** (7): i was tempted to give this my 11, this is just country wholesomeness

#Please make it go faster

**TragicKingdom1** (7): is the tractor supposed to be his dick

**1998tweety** (6.5): this ain't it

**radiofan15** (6.1): Way too much Yeehaw for me I guess...

**ManofOranges** (6): Sometimes I can't believe this song is real like is his idea of a date actually just sitting on a big green tractor?? Is that good for him? Is that something he wants to do?

**MashLuke** (6): this is like, the most American song ever

**waluigiest** (6): why am I getting emotional

**kappyko** (5.5): Serviceable country, comes and goes instantly. The guitar solo is very fun!

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): vine compilations made this song tolerable

**enecks** (5): Bro Country happened for a reason.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): This is the most yee haw song out of all yee haw songs.

**twat\_brained** (4.6): muh beeyug greeyan traecturrr. That's how he's saying it right? Did John Deere fund one of Jason's tours so now he's just repaying the favor? That's the only conclusion I can come up with for this inane country drivel.

**jamesfog** (4): Yeehaw! Country boys make do!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): I kind of dig this ironically.

**frogaranaman** (3): Yeehaw. 🤠 [1]

**hikkaru** (3): yeehaw...

**ariannagrandtitties** (2.8): i’d rather have a big red tractor

**CarlieScion** (2): no. i refuse. nope.

**mich4725** (2): I wouldn't like to rate it, but if I have to, there it is.

**ReallyCreative** (2): Dear Men: Stop singing country songs. Sincerely, People with ears.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (2): I have no meme for this song. There is no joy derived from this song and I will make sure that is evident.

**vapourlomo** (2): If you're going to make a corny country song about a tractor, at least make it ridiculous and goofy. This is just boring.

**ggodisawomann** (1): I fucking LOATHE this song I am NOT sorry

**MrSwearword** (1): simply put, NOPE

**pearllouise** (1): Michelle Visage doesn't approve

**selegend** (1): name itself is gonna get this to #100

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (1): this is like a parody of a country song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): I honestly can’t tell if this song inspired Bo Burnham’s country song parody or bro country is just very uncreative in terms of melody, this song is terrible either way

**xxrandooxx** (1): this song is hillbilly hell

**NotWith10000Men** (0): jason aldean is cancer to country. He wasn't the beginning of the dark ages but he's the fucking poster boy

**rosecoloreds** (0): americans and their bad taste in yeehaw music

**ExtraEater**: Okay, this one grew on me. I already finished nearly all the write-ups about halfway into the month, but even after writing a bad review about this I found the song sneaking into my head. As TragicKingdom1 will mention below, Jeremih's "Down on Me" is a vaguely similar song that I personally really like and would consider better than this. Still, this beat, as jilted and odd as it sounds, is pretty energizing. It kinda sounds like a big joke overall, and the lyrics, with ghost/toast-level rhymes like "hired/fired", support that belief. It slaps, but I'm glad it's out this early. We don't need to hear this on any other day.

**ImADudeDuh**: Imagine going from the iconic bop Let Me Love You, and then making this weird yet boring at the same time song... the downgrade is real!

#Let me love this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): omg this beat is so good

**kappyko** (9): wig!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Awhile2** (8): bangladesh is the most underrated producer of all time and this is prime guwop

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.6): oh WOW

#It's not me, it's you

**radiofan15** (7.6): Love the beat and the GucciMan verse... Sean Garrett can choke tho

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): who the fuck is Mario and why is he 468th most listened artist on Spotify

**1998tweety** (6.5): mess

**pearllouise** (6): I've always though of Mario as a short Italian dude made by Nintendo

**izeasklapaucius** (5): it kinda sounds like Look What You Make Me Do. where's the melody?

**Roxieloxie** (5): oh wow i forgot about mario. Let me love you is truly that song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): This song is almost ironically a bop because it’s weird and unpleasant and bad but it’s so weird and unpleasant and bad that I almost kind of like it. I will split the difference though on this score because it’s pretty bad

**jamesfog** (4): Don't remember this but apparently I thought it was real bad

**tapdancingpig** (4): I don’t know if I hate this, but I know I don’t like it.

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): This song is a HOT mess from start to finish, what the fuck is the key lmao

**ryjomom** (3.5): Mario Kart outsold

**frogaranaman** (3): This song's progression is exactly how it feels to listen to reggaeton for hours on end with a bunch of other latinos getting fuck wasted off of tequila.

**Tchalla1966** (3): “i’m back baby” i have to laugh!

**twat\_brained** (2.8): Is it really that bad? just from this opening verse I can tell it's mixed horribly, and that beat is awful, but it can't be much worse than this can it? Sean's verse is rather respectable, if there's anything redeemable to this song. I don't wanna hear it again but it's not sensually or lyrically offensive like Every Girl is

**xxrandooxx** (2.4): Im glad its not 2009 anymore

**ariannagrandtitties** (2): why are men like this

**NotWith10000Men** (2): man late 2000s dude rnb/hip hop just isn't my genre

**TragicKingdom1** (2): Jeremih - Down On Me did this kind of messy R&B midtempo bop better

**vapourlomo** (2): This production and hook makes me seasick. What a waste of Gucci Mane

**DrunkHurricane** (1): this song is just... wrong.

**enecks** (1): This is fundamentally broken and I should give it my 0, but I REALLY hate Eminem.

**hikkaru** (1): one of the most annoying songs in this rate

**MrSwearword** (1): bye, this sucks

**nightjesus** (1): lol what was this noise

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): Here is a prime reason as to why the tide of history is making everybody agree that Luigi is the better brother. I very much agree that nobody on this song deserved to be broken up with. On the contrary, all three people on this song deserve a restraining order for abusing my ears. I can remember nothing about this except the blinding flash of pain and hell.

**waluigiest** (1): this song is so messy what the fuck

**CreepyMannequin** (0): Holy shit.

**Mysario** (0): I don't even know what's going on in this song but it makes me anxious

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): Awful. Awful. Awful. The absolute worst of the year. Nothing about this song even remotely works. And it’s such a headache to listen to.

**skargardin** (0): i'm sorry but this was a disjointed mess and I never want to hear of it again

**ExtraEater**: In every way this song actively tries and surely succeeds in convincing us that "I love drinking", "I love women", and "I love college" are not exactly 100% related statements. To Asher Roth, college's newfound opportunity for independence coupled with physically (not necessarily mentally) growing out of being a teenager means you can party all the time and do as much alcohol and drugs as possible. It sounds like a ripe dropout anthem, but hey it's funny. The production being easygoing and relaxing helps the song's mood a whole lot, and it's catchy enough that I can give this a 9 (the score it deserves) without really lying.

**ImADudeDuh**: Jesus christ this song is terrible. This song is what I imagine Tik Tok would sound if you removed everything fun from it and made it as frat boy as possible. It's trying to be a comedy song but also trying to be a big party anthem and idk who thought a song involving spoken comedic dialogue and a chant that you're supposed to sing along to was a good idea? What even could be considered the worst part of this song? The delivery as a wasted guy? The terrible chanting that goes on for a full verse?? When he says to double wrap condoms which actually increases the likelihood of it breaking???????? Who's to say! As Shikha once said "there's a lot to unpack here but let's just throw away the whole suitcase."

#Valedictorians

**izeasklapaucius** (10): i'm giving this a ten because i know yall homosexuals would do this straight-as-a-ruler song dirty. I mean listen to the Weezer sample, listen to the condom line and don't tell me it was shit because IT WASN'T

**mms82** (10): I'm so happy we're rating this song because it's such a bop and deserves recognition

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Mysario** (9.5): I loved bopping to this and "I Hate College" remix when I was in high school and nowhere near college

**radiofan15** (8.3): I hated college so I can't relate to what Frat Eminem is sayin but I still bop to this

**fishingfor8** (8): Better than Eminem in 2009

**ryjomom** (8): too relatable

**wholesomebody** (8): i havent heard this in years oh my goddd

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): if there was some way to objectively determine how bad a song is this would probably be up there but it makes me feel happy

#freshMEN, freshMEN, freshMEN

**Awhile2** (7): cant relate

**MashLuke** (7): a the Lonely Island song

**skargardin** (7): Conflicted emotions

**twat\_brained** (7): I've never heard this before how bad is it? If anything I wanna say he sounds like Hobo Johnson but he's way too out there so no. But like… this man epitomizes whitebread music. The video looks like a fucking drug fueled bender when really the song just sounds like Asher reciting the lyrics over a tuned-up version of Waiting on the World to Change, which I'm not sure is more embarrassing to Asher or John Mayer. Well John's got his own problems so I'll pin this on Asher. In fact, the thumbnail for his "Be Right" video literally has Wonder Bread in it. This is the epitome of a 7 to me.

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): Fun beat? I hate his fucking voice

**ariannagrandtitties** (6): i too love college

**jamesfog** (6): The Mike Posner before Mike Posner

**pearllouise** (6): He probably went to FU

**1998tweety** (5): This song is not a mood

**DrunkHurricane** (5): this is supposed to be fun?

**NotWith10000Men** (5): love the chorus, verses are meh

**selegend** (5): im hole for 2009 asher roth

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Hi everyone. Just got back from day 1 of college orientation. I'm a commuter student attending a small Christian college. I'm 18 years old and was homeschooled my entire life. I absolutely hated it! I'm dreading the next few days of events and I'm nervous about classes to come. I'm extremely introverted, and I felt so out of place. Even though the school has under 2,000 people...I have never seen more than 50 people in one place. It seems so huge and crowded. Everyone was so loud and happy. I talked to a few people, but then they left and I didn't see them again, whenever I did talk to someone it seemed awkward. I don't know if I lack social skills or what, but I'm dreading tomorrow. I just want to restart my homeschooling years. It's a fair length drive, and I don't have much driving experience, so I'm nervous about that. I also know that I don't want to live on campus. I'm absolutely wiped! I am a highly sensitive person, and so much stimulation really overwhelms me. Will it get better once classes start? I hate this new change and want everything to go back to how it used to be. Have any of you experienced this? I just want to curl up in bed and cry...and I probably will. I know this is good for me in the long run, but I can't picture this as my future for the next few years. Do you have any tips? Thanks so much!

**xxrandooxx** (4.5): I have too many conflicting feelings about this song, part of me is thinking wig… but also apart of me is thinking i hate str8 culture… Overall I do kinda relate to this??? (But also not)

**hikkaru** (4): this is annoying but i stan the lines about consent and protection

**mich4725** (4): lol

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Like many other people doing this rate who’ve never heard I Love College before, my immediate reaction to Asher Roth’s only remembered song was one of extreme disgust. Admittedly, though, as cringeworthy as I Love College sounds today, it’s not…completely…bad? The beat and groove are actually kind of nice, and while I can’t force myself to ignore how bad the lyrics are here I can still see the potential buried deep within them. If a better rapper did I Love College I probably wouldn’t hate it. Unfortunately, I do. I wanna go to a timeline where this song is actually good.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3.5): “haha college was wild DAE get wasted” - This song basically. Also, the instrumental does so not suit the lyrics

**ggodisawomann** (3): I'm sorry but no

**nightjesus** (3): oh man at 24 these lyrics made me tired also don’t point two condoms on that risks further brakege

**waluigiest** (3): for a song about having fun this is so boring

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): Lil Dicky 1.0

**ReallyCreative** (2): Imagine being this obnoxious jesus fucking christ

**enecks** (1): (this post was redacted due to having language too explicit for a christian sub)

**ignitethephoenix** (1): This guy isn’t singing and he isn’t rapping he’s literally just talking. This guy is literally just a frat boy who was like I’m going to make a song about my basic ass life. How did his go number 12 on the billboard 100?!!

**kappyko** (1): he's not funny, he's not clever, he's not interesting, so why should i listen to this instead of like the several songs mac miller has about partying

**ManofOranges** (1): This... exists

**MrSwearword** (1): put this trash back in the bread aisle you found this in.

**Roxieloxie** (1): One, this is the exact song i would expect a guy name asher roth to make. 2. This is what i would assume a 21p & MnM song to sound like... the whitest shit in the world

**theburningundead** (1): I don't have a problem with straight people but do they have to be so in your face about it?

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): This sounds like a Your Favorite Martian song

**rslashpoopheads** (0): A hard-earned and well-deserved 0.

#As if he's in his right mind

**GoWestYoungKanye** (0): no one in their right mind likes college, shut the fuck up

#He literally says don't fuck if she's drunk, but go off

**ExtraEater**: People *are* crazy, because all six non-Taylor country songs in this rate are good (the Taylor songs are good, too, mind you) but destined to be underrated anyway. For anyone who happened to like "Chicken Fried", this song has a similar warm feeling to it, at least for me. Some lyrics are a little ridiculous, but surely we've come to expect that, right? A relaxing song with a ridiculous story. Lucky motherfucker.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song is pretty fucking wild. Imagine going to a bar and talking to some old man and he dies and gives you his million dollars in his will instead of his children. That is fucking sugar daddy GOALS! Also, this song was nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the 52nd grammys. It lost to Sweet Thing by Keith Urban btw.

#TEA!

**kappyko** (6): bitches be shoppin

#Lucky millionaires

**mms82** (11): Wow this song is beautiful. The opening strums of the guitar just make me want to tear up and the song goes off from there. The song tells a story that really is different than most other songs from the time even if it is kitschy, and the chorus is an amazing line. I know this song isn't the song that takes off in these rates, but I really hope this song doesn't go out first because it is such a sweet memory from the time and an absolutely beautiful song that still makes me emotional to listen to.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**\_wailordfan** (9): This is a fun and clever country song

**Mysario** (8.5): I'm not a big fan of this song but the main line "God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy" puts a smile on my face for being so silly

**1998tweety** (8): chill, easy listening

**ryjomom** (8): Imagine thinking people were crazy back when we had Obama as president.

#Ableism is never okay

**radiofan15** (7.7): Country Lil Dicky is somehow less funnier than actual Lil Dicky

**ManofOranges** (7.5): This song literally tells the most unrealistic story of all time like you're telling this random ass man that Mr. Currington met in a bar would just so happen to be a millionaire and give him the money instead of family or something??? whoever wrote this must be the crazy one

**strawberryswing1** (7): Yeehaw

**pearllouise** (6): Forever a mood

**poppinmmolly** (6): my LEAST favorite Billy Currington song. He has way better songs. Must Be Doin' Something Right says hi.

**jamesfog** (5): Uh

**NotWith10000Men** (5): not the country vibe that I like

**ReallyCreative** (5): gross, but I like parts of it, so it's not THAT gross

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): this predates bro country but still hits all the lyrical tropes

**frogaranaman** (4): Yeehaw. 🤠 [5]

**Roxieloxie** (4): this title is a mood

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): Billy raised some points with this title

**ggodisawomann** (3): no thank you

**hikkaru** (3): please make the male country stop i'm not straight enough....

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): I’m not even going to attack this for being country. It’s true that the only genre a glurgy song like this could have rose out from is musical theatre, which I am a shameful casual fan of, but my issue with it is less that it’s a country song and more that Billy Currington apparently does not know how to write an interesting tale without turning it into the sonic equivalent of a Facebook post. This drew a negative comparison to a Readers Digest article from a critic once, but as the resident student journalist I’d pick a job at RD over being Billy’s ghostwriter.

**vapourlomo** (3): Okay wait...so this guy dies with millions, and gives it to some rando in a bar instead of his own children?! I'm so confused here

**twat\_brained** (2): God? Not real. Godney, however, is. Beer? NOT FUCKING GOOD. People? They are indeed crazy for getting this onto the Year End Hot 100.

**xxrandooxx** (1.2): God is great, Beer is good Revelations 1:35

**enecks** (1): Yeah, they must be if they listen to this drek

**MrSwearword** (1): if they like shit like this, yeah they are crazy

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): pass.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): this sounds like the musical version of that 'you ever just sit in your truck' boomer meme

**waluigiest** (1): I don’t know what this is but I don’t like it

**ExtraEater**: The opening monologue about Slim Shady with the casual mention of a fuckton of rapes wasn’t ever funny, because in the days of MMLP Slim Shady actually had a sense of impact to his attempts at shock value yet now we’re just kinda waddling in shit territory and not progressing in any substantial way here. Still, I somewhat enjoy this song and the beat is quite nice, but I just cannot stand any other element of this song because it's all taken over by an old and boring iteration of Slim Shady. Even Eminem fans don’t care for this dark age in his career, and really the only thing that needs to be said was said by Eminem himself in “Not Afraid”: “Let’s be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehh.” A bit of an understatement, to say the least.

**ImADudeDuh**: Now I know why people say this is Eminem's worst album by a long shot. This song is just bad. I fucking HATE eminem's delivery on this song and especially on the second half of the chorus. This song is pretty noneventful the rest of the time. 50 Cent and Dr Dre are okay, but again, nothing eventful.

#Extra cheese, please!

**Awhile2** (10): this was one of the first like 5 songs i ever bought on itunes. It also taught me what what fromundercheese and rubbers are

**bespectacIed** (9): This collab was so hyped and huge back then, even know I'm still amazed this happened

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): this is nice actually but fiddy verse is boring.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): this is literally the only song that is not dogshit on relapse

#I'm lactose intolerant, thank you

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Would be better if it wasn’t so long

**ManofOranges** (7): This song was fine I don't really vibe with it though

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Oof, Eminem has only one song in the rate, huh? I won’t gloat too much. Mariah does have the exact same amount of hits on this Year-End, after all. Anyway, you might consider how catchy Crack a Bottle is the first time you listen to it, but after awhile Eminem’s rapping starts to get noticeably repetitive and annoying when you hear it. Not to mention there’s something wrong with his voice here, too. I wish Dre and 50 Cent featured more prominently.

**tapdancingpig** (7): ...well, Em’s certainly a better singer than Pitbull.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): I really like the Dr. Dre beat on this song and it’s kind of goofy and fun but oh god was Eminem’s accent on this album obnoxious and the fromunda cheese line is just gross. Still though, I’d take music like this over current day Eminem anyway.

**1998tweety** (6.5): He really can't sing huh

**jamesfog** (6): cute chorus i guess

**CarlieScion** (5): eminem who

**frogaranaman** (5): Me, whenever any Eminem song comes on: Anyways, here’s rap "Wonderwall."

**Mysario** (5): I don't have the heart to give this anything lower but I did not like this album and I liked this song even less. The verses are subpar, the constant drum crash is grating, and it just drags on and on

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the man can fucking rap but I don't like this song

**fishingfor8** (4): Asher Roth was better than Eminem in 2009

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): This has aged poorly.

**waluigiest** (4): don’t make me rate eminem

**wholesomebody** (4): bottom tier eminem hit

**mms82** (3.5): one of the worst eminem songs

**CopyCatJ** (3): I hate eminem

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): em is just fucking garbage

**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): kinda catchy tbh but awful anyways this is prob bottom 10

**ariannagrandtitties** (2.2): were there actual lyrics to this song?

**xxrandooxx** (2.2): I swear this song was just one lyric on loop.

**radiofan15** (1.2): Good thing people seems to have forgotten about this one despite its success because its REALLY BAD

**MrSwearword** (1): god what a shit song

**pearllouise** (1): Three dudes, one generic rap song

**Roxieloxie** (1): this so bad why would you make me listen to m and m

**ryjomom** (1): RuBbErS

**selegend** (1): the lick the cheese from under my nuts line used to turn me on tbh

**twat\_brained** (1): I hate Eminem and I hate 50 Cent, and this song is very hateable too. The fact that he trivializes something as serious as rape in this song is honest to God disgusting and I'm over the whole "it's Slim Shady he's a character" argument. Eminem can keep making his lameass music and make lameass dad puns like that stupid Worcestershire sauce lyric. I just don't want to be made to listen to it again. How could we let this go #1 and not Paparazzi?

**vapourlomo** (1): This is deeeep in Eminem's dark age. This beat is sluggish, his flow is awkward, and the whole song just sounds ugly.

**enecks** (0): Fuck Eminem. This is one of that incompetent asshole's worst songs. Singing a hook - let alone one of the most awful hooks on record - was a terrible idea for Em, whose voice is only good for... come to think of it nothing.

**kappyko** (0): the one artist i will never understand acclaim (?) for is eminem, who is the definition of the dregs of bland mainstream uninspired hip hop. he cant even write a good hook

**ExtraEater**: Well, it's fine I guess. Look, "Crank That" is genuine brilliance and "Kiss Me Thru the Phone" is pretty good, but this ringtone rap dumbness can only carry one so far, and this song plays out like a vision of some of the worst iconic rap songs from this era. I still find this rather fun, but this song is to "Boom Boom Pow" (which is still very good) as "Kiss Me Thru the Phone" is to "I Gotta Feeling". In other words, both Soulja Boy and The Black Eyed Peas have two songs in this rate but in both cases one song is noticeably better than the other. I guess I enjoy this pre-YOLO mess but I'm not listening to it again.

**ImADudeDuh**: This is like... barely a song. I feel like there's only 10 different lines in this song. I firmly believe this only made the year end due to sales from ringtones, I can not imagine this eing played on the radio anywhere.

#Swag: ACTIVATED

**enecks** (10): Influential artiste Soulja Boy Tellém made his most prominent artistic statement with this - by suggesting Swag is a state that can be activated and removed. Rather than the binary of having swag or not having it, it suggests swag is a latent inherent power that just has to be activated. It's an inclusive brag rap therefore, implying if the individual turns their own swag on, they can be just as cool as a video game bootlegger and Ariana ghostwriter.

**vapourlomo** (9): This is basically a Lil B song, therefore it's beautiful and perfect.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): idk who was less talent, Soulja or Wayne. Thankfully, Soulja is doing here what Wayne isn't doing on this chart; making listenable hip hop. And him releasing this song allowed Cher Lloyd to fucking body this song on her X Factor audition so Soulja can keep his swag on!

**Awhile2** (8): in 4th grade my friend avery tried to convince everyone that swag was a euphemism for penis in this song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): invented Beyonce

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I am a very young person, and I do not know anything about Soulja Boy except for the fact that he appeared in every single video I watched that attacked pop music back when I was in my annoying classic rock phase. You know which song came up in the kind of videos I’m talking about. Now, when I first listened to Turn My Swag On for this rate, I thought ‘Hey, he sounds like an annoying douche here, but this is actually really cool!’ like an innocent lamb being led to slaughter. Technically, I still have the same opinion as I did before, but the wonders of Kiss Me Thru the Phone have made me realize that this is not as enjoyable as I thought it was. With that being said, it’s still quite the guilty pleasure to hear Soulja say ‘eyyy’.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Soulja 💁‍♂💁‍♂ boy 💁‍♂ tell🗣em👥 Hopped🐇up☝out👉 the 😩bed🛏😴turn ↩my 💁‍♂ 💁‍♂swag 💁‍♂🔥💯on💡 Took 👋a🅰 look👀 in👉👌 the😩 mirror😏😎, said🗣wassup 👋🙋‍♂ Yeah😂😂I'm💁‍♂💁‍♂ gettin' 👊✊money🤑💵💰 oh😳😮

**ExtraEater**: At worst, Nickelback are boring and at best they make classics like "How You Remind Me". "Gotta Be Somebody" is somewhere in the middle, because it's a pretty nice melody yet it makes me want to listen to "If Today Was Your Last Day" instead. There's somebody out there who loves this, and I stand by the stance that they're not wrong.

**ImADudeDuh**: Tbh I could go into a rant about how Nickelback is underrated and this song is good blah blah blah, but I just learned they actually said "nobody wants to be the last one there" and not "last one dead." This lyric gave me a midlife crisis when i was 12 because I was like "oh wow, someone will be the last person dead... :("

#Gotta Be Somebody - Natalie La Rose

**ggodisawomann** (10): Nickelback fucks and I am sorry yall can't admit that

**mms82** (9.5): why are they memed as so bad this actually holds up

**1998tweety** (9): Iconic

**CarlieScion** (9): i unironically like Nickelback

**kappyko** (9): surprisingly competent pop rock

**ryjomom** (9): Pennyfront have bops, dont @ me

**radiofan15** (8.3): I know it's easy to make fun of Nickelback (i've done it) but they sometimes succeed in creating catchy and interesting if vapid tracks like this one

**frogaranaman** (8): The music video for this song probably looks exactly like it sounds.

**jamesfog** (8): Bop. Inb4 this is bottom 10 :rolls_eyes:

**rslashpoopheads** (8): We love a good basic-ass 4 chords song.

**Mysario** (7): I like Nickelback but I'd be surprised if this song makes it past the bottom 10, even with all the trashy rap songs

**rickikardashian** (7): ...why don't I hate this

**Roxieloxie** (7): this isn't as bad as i was expecting

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): Nickelback is overhated. I used to love this song, but it's just okay. They have better songs.

#Nobody, Nobody, Nobody, Nobody, Nobody

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.1): somebody is listening to this

**twat\_brained** (6): I remember Canadian stations pushing this along with the other meaningless crap Nickelback has managed to somehow coast off the back of throughout the 2000s. Thankfully nobody seems to care about them anymore. I don't even think this is that God awful, it's just so bland. Stop using the basic four chord structure if you're not gonna build an interesting song on top of it. no more of this

**xxrandooxx** (5.6): Roll credits of an indie movie

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I may guiltily enjoy How You Remind Me and If Today Was Your Last day, but sadly I can’t even find myself loathing or shamefully rocking out a bit to Gotta Be Somebody. Marking the transition from the bottom half of this rate to the top, there is exactly nothing noticeable about this single except for the fact that Chad’s voice is as bad as usual. Maybe this is the reason why rock started dying a slow death around this period.

**selegend** (5): if chad kroeger had listenable vocals this wouldnt be bad tbh

**Tchalla1966** (5): Not bad but not good either hmm

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): my reaction when someone announces the chainsmokers have a song with they.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (4): I've never listened to a Nickelback song because they're apparently to be really bad, so I was concerned going into this. And while I guess the hate has been over exaggerated a lot, it still isn't very good.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): super muddy production but could be worse otherwise

**DrunkHurricane** (3): lol nickelback sux

**enecks** (3): NO

**PuggleMaster** (3): I can barely hear the vocals on this song

**ReallyCreative** (3): I don't get the appeal of this song, I have no idea what it's trying to do

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3): honestly, the most insuferable part of this is just Chad’s voice

**tapdancingpig** (3): I’d give this a 0, but I feel like that would be disrespectful of the poor vocal producer who had to work with this. I know how awful it is to try to melodyne this kind of garbage in the studio, and they tried.

**wholesomebody** (3): uninteresting even for nickelback standards

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2.5): My girlfriend actually unironically enjoys Nickelback and she said she doesn’t even like this song so if that’s not a sign it’s not good I don’t know what is

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): it’s Nickelback.

**NotWith10000Men** (2): I hate this dude's voice

**vapourlomo** (2): Honestly, the song itself isn't bad. A little generic, but a decent pop-rock tune. But Chad Kroeger's voice...*shudder*

**waluigiest** (2): it’s fashionable to hate nickelback but tell me they’re wrong….

**MrSwearword** (1): even they've done worse but this is still anodyne trash

**nightjesus** (1): not due to the Nickelback meme it’s just a bad repetitive song

**pearllouise** (1): Is Nickelback the next main pop girl?

**ExtraEater**: Yeah, this is really good, guys. Look, if I'm counting correctly this rate only has six country songs (we're not counting Taylor Swift in that) and they're all pretty good. It's not as if I get up every day defending all country but for this particular rate we had a solid, like-able bunch here. Of these six songs, "Then" is the song I imagine will be undeservedly left in the dust the hardest, as "I Run to You" will likely get some "same group who made Need You Now" points and the ZBB songs will at least be talked about. The atmosphere to this song is remarkably more potent than the rest, not bogged down by a stupid analogy like in "Big Green Tractor", and it just genuinely showcases Brad Paisley's emotions. Look, this is the same guy who made the heartbreaking and probably George Jones-inspired "Whiskey Lullaby", he can make a good ballad and this ballad right here is a damn great one.

Dare I say it, it's much better than "White Horse".

**ImADudeDuh**: r/popheads, you are trash for calling this a BELOW AVERAGE SONG! This song is fucking adorable. It's just about how much you love someone and the building of a relationship from the original meetup to the plans of old age. It might be a little simple, but it still works great.

If this song was sung by Taylor Swift, this would be about 60 spots higher.

#I love you, always forever

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**1998tweety** (9): Daddy can get it

**ryjomom** (8.5): I saw Brad Paisley for super cheap last minute and I still remember how fun the concert was and how good this song was live.

**Mysario** (8): this is one of the three songs I don't know in the rate and I had to listen to it but it made me think... why were slow rock ballads such a big thing in 2009?

**tapdancingpig** (8): I’m inflating my score because I didn’t have to fight to stop myself from fast forwarding this, which I did for every other male country song in this fucking rate

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.7): totally forgot about this song, but damn it takes me back

**poppinmmolly** (7): cute

**TragicKingdom1** (7): nice outro

**jamesfog** (6.5): Meh

**radiofan15** (6.5): Cute country song but not really my style

**enecks** (6): Can I get a sad yeehaw in the replies

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I've always liked brad as a songwriter

**waluigiest** (6): I’m bored but this is probably good

#No time like the present

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): As somebody who’s not intro country outside from passionately defending Taylor Swift’s debut, I cannot associate Brad Paisley as anything other than the guy who made Accidental Racist, a glorious abomination which has some of my favourite lyrical atrocities of all time, including the ever-enduring ‘if you don’t judge my gold chains I’ll forget my iron chains.’ That’s rapped by LL Cool J, not sung by Paisley, but I think it’s a lyric that belongs up there with greats like William McGonagall. I should probably say something about This instead of ragging on about a song Paisley probably regrets since it’s what I’m actually rating, but I can’t say anything to the fact that This is technically not awful, but really, really dull. I can see the chorus sounding sweet to some people, but if you’re not into the best parts of this song you won’t like anything else about it. All it manages to inspire in me is a desperate wishing that the country that ends up at the bottom of the Year-End could be actually good.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5): who thought this album cover was a good idea. Photoshopping the name to make it look like it’s on his t-shirt? What?

**frogaranaman** (4): Yeehaw. 🤠 [3]

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): unrelated but this album art may be one of the worst ive ever seen

**twat\_brained** (3.6): as u/dirdbub would say, this is a non-song. In fact, calling this a song is an insult to the art form of music. Then again it sounds like All Too Well, which itself is already really long, but Taylor makes a story out of it. Brad just comes up with this really insincere love letter.

**kappyko** (3.5): Rather plain for a country tune.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3.5): he lost my gay ass at the having a baby line

**ggodisawomann** (3): Brad Paisley's voice makes me want to die

**ignitethephoenix** (3): I’m gagging I hate country love songs.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): snore.

**xxrandooxx** (3): I could see myself falling asleep in the middle of a field to this song and getting critically sunburnt.

**ReallyCreative** (2.6): gross

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2): I mean this could be more bro-y but it’s also super lame and incredibly boring, WHY IS THIS 5+ MINUTES LONG

**MrSwearword** (1): this can't get me to like country all that much. BYE

**ExtraEater**: I guess I can understand the hate behind "Chicken Fried", as great and deserving of Top 20 as it is, but we didn't have to do Zac Brown Band dirty against this perfectly fine song. Perhaps it's a consequence of the grab bag rate style, or perhaps popheads have bad taste. I'll meet in the middle and say both are definitely correct. Whatever it is that makes y'all hate this kind of stuff, you need to put it down. This is too relaxing and wholesome to hate.

**ImADudeDuh**: Zac Brown Band has the power to make me smile anytime I hear one of their happy songs. It's just infectious. You know that life hack about smiling on the phone so your tone sounds more pleasant? That works on me for this song. It's just so damn happy it makes me unable to be sad when this comes on. Shame this is a bottom 10 song, but at least we know Chicken Fried is a guaranteed Day 4 song!

#They love whatever this is

**CarlieScion** (10): this kinda cute

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**ryjomom** (10): Wedding Song Goals

**1998tweety** (8): this is nice

**poppinmmolly** (7): cute

#i don't kinkshame but really girl?

**radiofan15** (6.2): Zac Brown is daddy butt his song is just average

#imagine falling in love with a woman yikes

**jamesfog** (6): Uh

**kappyko** (6): that one guitar part at 0:55 is a 10 at least

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Look, I’m sure there’s a good reason why Zac Brown Band is one of the few mainstream country acts in this day and age that people actually like, but despite how sweet this song may be, it does absolutely nothing for me. I rank it near the bottom of my list not because of any dislike towards it, but because I simply lack interest in it. There are probably a few people here that want this as their wedding song, and I respect their decision, but I’d opt for Let’s go Crazy instead.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): where is the zac efron band

**TragicKingdom1** (6): kinda filler, surprised it was a hit

**fishingfor8** (5): this isn't Chicken Fried

**ReallyCreative** (4.8): It's almost pleasant to listen to

**enecks** (4): eh

**frogaranaman** (4): Yeehaw. 🤠 [6]

**ggodisawomann** (4): this is just...barely okay

**Roxieloxie** (4): the only time i have ever heard about this band was something in my APHUG textbook

**waluigiest** (4): this year was so yeehaw and I’m trying to be open to it but like…..

**twat\_brained** (3.2): This woman may have whatever Zac wants but this song does NOT have it. Chicken Fried is perhaps the most unusual subject for a country song I've ever heard but at least it has character. This has some guitars, I guess, and heartfelt emotions from Zac, but nothing really noteworthy.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): skip.

**pearllouise** (3): I feel like this is what redneck white moms in their 40s circle jerk to 24/7

**ExtraEater**: There it is! I'm confident that "How You Remind Me" is still Nickelback's main classic, but I quite enjoy the breathtaking, unabashed energy of this song. It's far from being truly inspirational at its core, but this just resonates because it just feels like actual passion was put into this, which is indeed a possibility among Nickelback songs, albeit not very common. This is Kroeger's favourite song from Dark Horse, and I'm not 100% sure how genuine that is (it was the original choice for the album's lead single, to his credit), but it's a good choice (disclaimer: I have not and I don't plan to listen to "Dark Horse").

**ImADudeDuh**: Nickleback's best song of 2009! And it's good in my opinion! It's just a normal inspriational bop that wants to ask a slightly existential question. Just like their other song! I'd say the weakness of this song is that it takes itself too seriously and is still at the mercy of being a nickelback song.

#donating 10 cents

**ggodisawomann** (10): would tomorrow be too late?

**Mysario** (10): I love this song and I love the message it has, even if it is cheesy as all heck, it just personally inspires me to be the best person I can be. Why would I spend time wasting my energy on unnecessarily hating on and being angry at things when I could spend my time leaving a positive impact on as many people as I can? ~~For the ratings of course!~~ I could die tomorrow by a freak accident and I'd rather do what I can to make the best of it. Every second counts cause there's no second try!

**ryjomom** (10): nickelback will always be nostalgic for me

**strawberryswing1** (10): fuck nickelback haters

**1998tweety** (8.7): All their songs sound the same but at least this bops

**Roxieloxie** (8): this seems like a guilty pleasure bop

**jamesfog** (7.5): Bop. Inb4 this is bottom 10 :rolls_eyes: [2]

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): Nickelback is overhated. That being said, this is only okay.

**twat\_brained** (7.4): For Nickelback it's relatively introspective and it's not all that out of place, but I don't remember the bridge too much or even the lyrics on the verses. Then again is there anything that objectively works for Nickelback? I don't know if there is

**frogaranaman** (7): I swear I heard this play at the Young Republicans club during high school.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I am not a fan of Chad’s voice in any way possible, and If Today Was Your Last Day features the kind of attitude in its lyrics that I’m supposed to loathe, but I’m not going to lie: this song actually kinda goes off hard. It’s such guilty rock pleasure that I’m tempted to give it an actually good score. Screw it, I am going to give it a good score. It’s not a perfect song and I still find it kind of funny, but at least it’s memorable in a not-so-bad way.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I always thought he was saying "Leave old bitches in the past."

#Forgive and forget (this song exists)

**radiofan15** (6.8): This is more generic than brand store product but it still sort-of slaps

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpDt5GCZcv4&feature=youtu.be

**nightjesus** (4.5): I kinda like the video clip to this song so its like a pity score

**xxrandooxx** (4.2): This song takes me back to being 10 years old and waiting for my parents to leave the bowling alley bar at 11:00 on a school night.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Nickelback.

**ReallyCreative** (4): Is it offensive to my ears? Not really, at least for a Nickleback song, but would I ever choose to listen to it? No.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): no

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): This is a bit more pleasant than the other Nickelback song but god damn Chad Kroeger’s voice is always like -3 to a song

**TragicKingdom1** (4): a bit groovier than i remember it but it feels extremely long

**waluigiest** (4): bad but not as horrible as the other nickelback song

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.4): sounds like he needs a cough drop

**enecks** (3): Luckily, this song was close to the last day in Nickelback's hitmaking era

**selegend** (3): the cheese

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3): this is just uncomfortable noise

**NotWith10000Men** (2): I hate his voice

**pearllouise** (1): Didn't I just rate this song

**rosecoloreds** (1): i really don't want to be mean to nickelback but i just can't get into any of their songs im sorry at least im not giving them a zero

**vapourlomo** (1): Can't do those vocals. Nope.

**ExtraEater**: I feel there's a decent contingent of people who feel that grab bag rates can have the disadvantage of forcing people to listen to songs from genres and scenes they don't care about. I believe this is one instance of this situation, but for the record this doesn't receive much appreciation from hip hop buffs anyway and even as I try to judge it for its own merit I come out bored (a song with such plain production, as in plain by basically all genre standards, isn't that worthy of marks, anyway). Nice and remotely catchy (the way he says "throw it in the bag" has me paying attention for its whole duration), but I'll pass.

**ImADudeDuh**: Tbh, I do like the little piano line that goes through the song. Plus, the autotuned chorus doesn't bother me as much as it does on other songs. This is basically what would happen if you took Whatever You Like + trashiness and just saw what would happen. And the result is not a *good* song, but definitely not an awful one!

#Can have whatever they like

**Mysario** (9): me when I get my tax refund and I can buy brand food from the grocery store again

**tapdancingpig** (9): You could tell me this was released a month ago, and I might have believed you. Issa bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I tried to get a bag out of my bag bag, only to discover the bag itself was a bag bag....inside of which were more bag bags, all tightly crushed together. I was a little worried this endless matroska bag would never end so I put the bag bag bag bag back in the bag bag bag, back into the bag bag and hid the whole mess under the sink again incase it turns out to be a white hole emitting matter as bags.

**enecks** (8): Why does this slap?

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): That abominable hyphen is here again. I have no idea who the main lead on this song is, either. I have nothing to say about this. Well, it sounds like the kind of music that I’d pretend to go along with and enjoy at parties but completely loathe everywhere else, at least. Does that mean it deserves a completely neutral score? Probably. It just makes me angry that good RnB in hip hop in this rate is so close and yet so far away. I can hear Ne-Yo and Alicia Keys already.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): throw this song out

**ExtraEater**: First of all, immediately read [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/amaz1e/billboard_hot_100_yearend_songs_of_2009/efmimxq/) from the rate announcement because it's better than any write-up Dude or I could produce. Anyway, /r/popheads did this one dirty, co-host /u/ImADudeDuh would certainly agree. Look, I think a good portion of country, particularly southern-born country, is devoted to those sweet "little things" in life. This is such a (chicken) tender and wholesome slice of country music that my Texan heart is moved, and by "moved" I specifically mean moved to the couch, ready to watch the football game with my cousins while eating Popeyes. Look, that's home to me, a bit of a gross exaggeration (My family and I are too stereo-typically Asian to have room for football), but it's home to me. Anyway, stop hating this and start kicking back and having a barbecue to it instead.

**ImADudeDuh**: How the fuck is this out day one? Is it cause a country guy sings it? Is that it? It must be. Because this song is so fucking HAPPY! Zac Brown Band just wants to talk about the small things in life that are GOOD! FUCK the bad shit that goes on, we have fried motherfucking chicken, cold beer and DENIM! How can you be upset at that! The only problem with this song is the weird hamfisted patriotism in the bridge, but everything else about this just makes me want to kick off my flip flops and dance around the dirt next to the drink table.

#finger lickin good!

**fishingfor8** (10): Classic

**Mysario** (10): this is probably one of the first male country songs that made me think "country isn't all that bad"

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**ryjomom** (10): Y’all are trash if you just don’t like this song because it is country.

**selegend** (9.9): fuck you /u/imadudeduh

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): i HATED this song before i got into country but now i recognize it for the wholesome bop it is. hope it can pull out day 2 at least

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): cute and wholesome

**kappyko** (8): surprisingly sweet!

**MashLuke** (8): I'm giving an 8 because I'm assuming /u/NapsAndNetflix likes this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): sorry but iconic

**wholesomebody** (8): my older brother still sings this all the time

**ManofOranges** (7.5): This songs brings back literally so many supressed memories of mine wow its power

**enecks** (7): I love Jake Paul :-D

**izeasklapaucius** (7): y'all said white people have no culture lol then explain this haters

**radiofan15** (7): WOW i'm suddenly a straight Texas Republican who loves to drive on my Jeep with my third wife (25 years younger than me) and my 14 children while wearing a red hat and complaining about Hillary's emails after all these years... also, i'm suddenly craving some KFC... also also, Zac Brown is BAE

#hates chicken, beer, jeans, and their mother's love

**1998tweety** (6.9): ok

**jamesfog** (6): Meh.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Look, everybody is treating this as the token good country song not by Taylor Swift in 2009’s year end and I can’t see why. It’s cheerful and good-natured and if I was geographically closer to America’s South I’d probably have a fun time singing it at weddings and other important social gatherings and events, but there’s definitely not enough oomph in this song for the chicken it cooks to be delightfully crispy. Maybe if it was more exciting, I’d be forgiving towards it. As of now, it’s a bit too close to being incredibly average.

**Tchalla1966** (6): lowkey a bop

**twat\_brained** (5.6): Is this the theme song for a country cooking Food Network program? I kinda dig the beat but the lyrics are a bit corny. Then again, I've kind of been wanting to get a really good chicken burger from somewhere and it IS Friday, as of when I'm listening to this song. The lyric about saluting is a needless pander to conservative America; we already know they're Zac's main demographic.

**ggodisawomann** (5): oh wow this was a throwback

**pearllouise** (5): Pretty wings

**Roxieloxie** (5): too much yee not enough haw

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): ngl this shit sounds like a really nice friday night

**waluigiest** (5): whatever

**frogaranaman** (4): Yeehaw. 🤠 [2]

**ReallyCreative** (4): I don't hate this song as much as I hate most country songs but it's still obnoxious and horrible

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (4): not the worst country song on this list. That’s still not saying much though

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.4): sponsored by KFC- it’s finger-lickin’ good

**ignitethephoenix** (3): This song kind of made me hungry.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): This is such a ‘dad at a BBQ’ song and not in a good way

**DrunkHurricane** (2): the country clichés are strong with this one

**hikkaru** (2): These male country songs are going to flop so hard omg

**rosecoloreds** (2): for the effort

**xxrandooxx** (1.2): I too love my chicken fried beer and pants

**MrSwearword** (1): absolutely fucking not; this is Red Solo Cup level terrible

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): I hate this song so much. I never want to hear it again.

#Ok but Beautiful Drug exists????

**NotWith10000Men** (1): literally the worst song zbb has ever made.

**ExtraEater**: Before he really revolutionized the pop game with masterpiece "Baby (feat. Ludacris)", Bieber began with the "My World" EP, featuring minor hit "One Time". This is actually pretty nice, and it does remotely showcase hints of his later star power. Observe how polished and well-written this R&B-influenced production is, and Bieber's "One (noun)" hook hits me just as hard as a song like "Boyfriend". Anyway, I can't wait when we finally get to rate "Baby" and give it the 10+ average it deserves instead of avoiding it by rating every other Bieber song around it (This song, "Boyfriend" from Billboard 2012 and all of "Purpose" in the Ultimate Male Rate).

**ImADudeDuh**: Oh my god. I never realized that the internet made a so many points about 2009 Justin Bieber. Baby is still a bop and I'm not afraid to admit it, but jesus christ this song is terrible. The repeated "Me + You" makes me want to fucking SCREAM out against this. I hate how the last syllable in each line in the verse is sung so much louder and so much more full of autotune. This song just feels cheap and made to be sold to 10 year olds. This was one of the mots viewed videos on youtube at one point........

# #Belieber4Life

**CarlieScion** (10): sksksks this kinda bops

**mms82** (10): still put this on from time to time, it's such a product of the time but its one of the cutest teeny bop songs

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This Song is one of the best of the year and no, I’m not sorry.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a cute bop

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): wow my head has officially been up Justin Bieber’s ass for ten years

**twat\_brained** (10): ay ay aY AYY AYYYY AYYYY AYYYYY AYYYYYYYYYYYY WHAT A NOSTALGIA TRIP THIS VIDEO GAVE ME! Justin Bieber was fucking adorable in 2009; you have no idea how much I idolized him. I wanted to dress like him, I wanted to listen to his music, I wanted to track his every move. In fact, I literally used to have a bottle of Vitamin Water that he drank from that my sister copped that just sat in my fridge from a mall tour he did when he was just starting out. I Beliebed to my heart's content, and it all started from the moment I heard "One Time" during summer 2009. Since then I've grown up and stopped Beliebing altogether, but it's fun to look back on that time and think about how much fun Justin was, before fame went to his head.

**vapourlomo** (10): That hook is unstoppable. YOUR WOOOOORLD IS MY WOOOOOORLD

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): this acoustic version is slightly better

**1998tweety** (9): massive bop, the production on this SNAPPED

**MashLuke** (9): this shouldn't be this good

**jamesfog** (8.5): It's so weird thinking that Justin Bieber has been around for 10+ years now... Ich.-

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Me as a 12 year old: “JB? More like J-Pee. He sounds like a little girl why does everyone love him? I CaN’T bEliEvE PeoPLe LiKe ThIs!” Me now: “This actually low key slaps”

**rosecoloreds** (8): the nostalgia.......

#[Still likes 2012 memes](http://www.funnybeing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Chuck-Norris-Is-Terrible-600x337.jpg)

**Mysario** (7): did this actually chart over "One Less Lonely Girl" ugh

**Tchalla1966** (7): Jesus he literally sounds like a baby i can’t HANDLE!

**radiofan15** (6.7): Rewatching this video was a fucking trip HOLY SHIT HOW EVERYTHING CHANGED AND HOW MUCH ON JUST 10 YEARS... also cute song

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I was expecting a nightmare when I listened to this, but aside from the fact that I had to witness yet another early Bieber instance of him non-ironically calling a girl ‘shawty’ at the tender age of eleven or so, it’s actually not that bad. The beat and production here are honestly decent, and could’ve possibly been fully salvaged if One Time was given to a more experienced RnB artists. At the very least, the song is much more tolerable than Baby.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6): i mean this is pretty generic really. It’s just kinda inoffensive

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): Pre-puberty Bieber is a blast from the past but this song is surprisingly not that bad. It’s almost like the internet irrationally bullied a child for appealing to teenage girls or something

**frogaranaman** (5): https://2static1.fjcdn.com/comments/His+last+album+was+fire+lowkey+what+do+you+mean+_e87b441cb83c5ba1bf1c70697c41b394.jpg

**pearllouise** (5): I used to think Bieber was black when I first heard him on the radio. No lie.

**ggodisawomann** (4): Biebs has better bops

**tapdancingpig** (4): This is kind of cute? It’s not good, but Bieber actually sounds okay. Still... I don’t want to hear anyone say “shawty” ever, and I certainly want to keep actual kids away from the phrase.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): sorry but the hate on bieber's voice from around this era was totally justified

**waluigiest** (4): he’s a child……. This is strange in hindsight

**bespectacIed** (3): Corny and cringey then and now

**mich4725** (3): early Bieber was so bad

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): [RATE] The Ultimate Boys’ Rate: Justin Bieber - My World vs. Jacob Sartorious - The Last Text EP vs. MattyBRaps - Outside The Lines EP

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): this is very mattybraps

**fishingfor8** (2): Babbbyyy Bieber!!!

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): this killed me instantly

**PuggleMaster** (2): after hearing this intro y'all can never drag ariana for the yuhs omg

**ryjomom** (2): Serving Kidz Bop Realness

**Plasm\_Trojan** (1.2): It's been debated a lot if early Justin was worthy of all the hate he racked up over the years. And while his music got better with age, I don't think the hate for songs like this is too crazy.

**enecks** (1): Thyme

**kappyko** (1): jb's vocals are weird to hear so undeveloped into the douchebag white boy mannerisms. he needed some extra time to grow though, this is just nauseatingly sweet

**MrSwearword** (1): NOPE

**ReallyCreative** (1): This song sounds legitimately creepy to me, it's straight up unnerving, it's like Kids Bop came to life or something

**rslashpoopheads** (1): AAAAAAAAAAAAA

**xxrandooxx** (1): *least favorite female artist*

**ExtraEater**: Everyone who fixates on "The-Dream" as being an irritating artist name, and specifically because of the hyphen, is correct. In any case, the song's decent. Solid r&b but not solid enough.

**ImADudeDuh**: this is gonna sound weird but is it just me or does this song seem oddly sweet? I feel like it's just cause of the way he's singing, but idk it just seems nice. It feels weird calling a song called "Rockin' That Thang" a sweet song, but idk if the shoe fits. Like there's legit the line where he says "I'm not trying to get in your clothes....... ok I'm lying" but idk I feel like The-Dream is a siren who's luring me in and he has me hooked but instead of killing me, he just wants me for my thang and idk this song is weird but I'm not mad at it.

#Rockin' Their Thangs

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This Song is a classic and it absolutely deserves to make top 50 at least.

**pearllouise** (10): I feel bad for giving these average male R&B wannabes low scores, so here.

**kappyko** (9.5): this is actually well deserved everybody slept on the-dream's whole synth funk thing forever and he has still not been recovered. "love king" pop perfection

**vapourlomo** (8): There's not really much of a hook here, but this production is so, so good.

**radiofan15** (7.9): ALRIGHT PEOPLE GET ME PHARRELL, RANDY NEWMAN, BILLY CORGAN AND THE-DREAM... THE-DREAM? HE WROTE UMBRELLA AND SINGLE LADIES... YOU PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE-DREAM?!?

**MashLuke** (7): the harmonies tho lol

#Rocking* Their Things*

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Who the hell is this guy, and why does the have a hyphen between his name? It’s disgusting to look at. The-Dream deserves to be cancelled and called The-Nightmare, hyphen included, for that alone. Rockin’ That Thing is an alright song (it’s actually called Rockin’ That Shit, but somehow this censored version sounds better) that’s admittedly pretty catchy, and this guy’s voice is fit for it, even if he isn’t anything to write home about. The ‘okay, I’m lying’ part strikes me as a bit objectifying and irritates me just a little, though. Plus, the outro here is…good, but strangely out of place? I don’t know what to make out of Rockin’ That Thang except for the fact that it’s okay.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): im under her bra

**waluigiest** (7): definitely not bad

**1998tweety** (6.8): bops a little bit but I also don't think its very good

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): This song is weird but it's not *bad* I guess

**Tchalla1966** (6): Shawty is a ten was much better.

**jamesfog** (5.5): Huh

**frogaranaman** (5): Must say, the synth work is astoundingly good.

**MrSwearword** (5): too forgettable for castigation

**ryjomom** (5): it just sounds like background music, I could see a better singer making this instrumental a bop

**enecks** (4): Just say anything but thang.

**twat\_brained** (4): this sounds ridiculously 2009, and it doesn't even have any lasting novelty

**ExtraEater**: It's rather grating, but I can see how it would go off. I enjoy the little synth blips that enter early into the song, and the catchy way she says "turnin' me on" is nice.

**ImADudeDuh**: Keri gets the honor of being the worst song by a woman in this rate! And let's be real, this was a very easy decision to make! This sounds like the worst parts of rihanna and beyonce combined. Those "ahh Ahh AHH"'s are so off key that it's so laughable. Lil Wayne is here because its 2009 and of course he is. "Recognize a real woman" is pretty ironic from someone who sounds like they were a vocaloid reject.

#not a fake woman

**gannade** (10): the beyhive made some poitns but keri made more

**MashLuke** (10): this made me hard

**Mysario** (10): I really wanna mention how great this song is but hopefully someone else can put it in better words than I can

**NotWith10000Men** (9): yo this is a BOP why don't I know keri

**vapourlomo** (9): I had never heard this song before this rate, but it's a total banger! You've especially gotta love Wayne coughing for a solid minute before his verse starts.

**tapdancingpig** (8): oh god oh fuck keri he’s clearing his throat behind you right now run for your life oh my god she can’t hear us she’s got airpods in oh god oh fuck

**1998tweety** (7.8): Wayne's verse actually fits pretty well into this.

**radiofan15** (7.7): The song whose remix killed her career... a shame because this one is nice, but messing with Bey (and Ciara too, I guess) was a HUGE mistake

**ggodisawomann** (7): Keri honey come back

**ignitethephoenix** (7): production is great, Keri’s voice is weird here though

**ManofOranges** (7): This kind of hits but like it annoys me a little bit

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): keri helson come back please

**waluigiest** (7): the first song of the rate I didn’t know. Lil Wayne was really huge 10 years ago, wow. A lot of neat things - the brass, the general flow. But her voice is really off and the production seems uncomfy

**twat\_brained** (2): oh god Wayne is on this song ugh. Dear God this is pure hip-hop/R&B radio filler, how is this song above Paparazzi and Fireflies? When I started this rate I forgot how nuisance Lil Wayne was to music during this time

**kappyko** (1.5): theres actually an explicit version on spotify. but this blows except for weezy

**TragicKingdom1** (1.5): cacophany

**ariannagrandtitties** (1.2): what was the point of this

**enecks** (1): This gave me a headache!

**mms82** (1): i feel bad giving lil wayne such a low score but this song is bad

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): If you follow in the tradition of what was actually Jimmy Saville’s second most disgusting fetish, and you sexually identify as a necrophiliac, you might regard the reanimated corpse of Lil Wayne wheezing out ‘Miss Keri, babyyyy’ as sensually arousing whenever you listen to Turning Me On. If this is something you experience, then I regret to inform you that you should skip out on getting help. There’s no hope for you. Get out of my sight now. I’m genuinely baffled by the existence of this, because Keri’s only other song in this rate is legitimately fantastic, but at the very least I can take solace in the fact that this definitely does not turn me on.

**xxrandooxx** (1): This song gave me anxiety

**ExtraEater**: I won’t lie. This is like, super catchy. In fact, it’s so catchy that I’d dare to say it’s good. The lyrics are hilarious, and the way he pronounces the ridiculous lyrics and says everything with such passion (‘cuz it’s your birthday) is really too slick for me to resist. The production is kinda sugary and evocative of a really weird, messed up birthday. The only thing I’m disappointed about is the fact that this is a sexual song about birthdays yet it makes no reference to birthday suits.

**ImADudeDuh**: Tightrope by Janelle Monae and Big Boi was in the recommended section of this video and honestly, Janelle sweetie, i am SO SORRY! This song is also in an iconic vine, but it's definitely a worse vine than Big Green Tractor's. This song really could've been sexy, but Jeremih can not sing so autotune came into here. Plus, there's the i i i's throughout the chorus that really sound more like someone going over speed bumps than a sex song. Oh well.

#Happy birthday to me

**gannade** (10): one of the best songs ever made

**MashLuke** (10): I wish tbh

**waluigiest** (10): GIRL YOU KNOW AIAIAIAIA this song is sexy and it just works. The bridge is so well executed the fucking flow!! It’s also just a sensual song that celebrates eroticism and partnership without objectifying women it wins all around

**Mysario** (9.6): I've had birthday sex a total of none times but I bet it's about as good as this song

**MrSwearword** (8): trashy fuccboi gold but not really worthy of all marks

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I will admit that this does get a little too repetitive and long at times, but I’d still firmly place it among the better RnB songs in this rate. Whoever Jeremih is, he actually does a good job talking about straight sex (disgusting) in a non-objectifying, non-cringe inducing way in Birthday Sex, and he does this all in explicit detail; I’m not legally allowed to comment more on the exact implications of this, but maybe Birthday Sex should be praised more for that alone.

#Uhhh, I'm only turning 17... 🔞

**radiofan15** (7.9): Imagine going from a Top 5 hit on Billboard and a promising career to being kicked out of your own tour just because you're an asshole.... Jeremy can relate

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.2): wow the production kinda goes out

**ManofOranges** (7): I feel dirty for liking this song but I can't help it's just infectious

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): cue that screaming vine

**1998tweety** (6): His voice sounds like the original Swae Lee lmao.

**GiftoftheGeek** (6): This song has at least been partially ruined by musical.ly/Tik Tok

**ignitethephoenix** (6): should I be surprised something this raunchy was so popular back then?

**tapdancingpig** (6): This song is exactly what you’d expect from the title. It’s fine, I guess.

**jamesfog** (5): Ew

**pearllouise** (5): [ICONIC] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9N2TykMEpk)

**Roxieloxie** (5): **why was pop music so horny in 2009**

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Rihanna, 2 Chainz, and Katy Perry all remain unbothered

**vapourlomo** (5): Halfway-decent R&B song ruined by the "AYAYAYAYA" rhyme scheme.

**wholesomebody** (5): birthday next

**twat\_brained** (4.7): Why the hell does Jeremih look 22 in the music video but sound 14? "Tastes just like Hershey's" I swear to God Usher did not invent R&B for it to be desecrated like this. If his voice sounded better, I'd be more convinced

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): This has a decent atmosphere but everything else about this makes my skin crawl.

**ryjomom** (4): The instrumental YES The lyrics NO

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): I really want to know who thought it was a good idea to put the “EYEEYEEYEYE” thing on every single line in a sex jam, Jeremih has way better love songs than this

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.2): we get it, u have a penis

**frogaranaman** (3): I want birthday sex. :(

**kappyko** (3): bizarre

**NotWith10000Men** (3): unlike the rest of this heathen sub, im not a huge fan of songs explicitly about sex

**TragicKingdom1** (3): how does jeremih still have a career 10 years later

**enecks** (2): ew

**selegend** (2): this song is all i think about on birthdays now and i hate it

**xxrandooxx** (2): Did he sing happy birthday to her AS he fucked her?

**Plasm\_Trojan** (1.2): Sometimes there isn't much to say about a song besides "it sounds like shit."

**ReallyCreative** (1): This song is a mistake

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (1): words can’t describe how bad this song is. It’s both repulsive and boring

**ExtraEater**: Alright, so this is actually pretty nice as far as electro-R&B from this era goes, but it's definitely a far cry from some of the quality seen in the upper half of this chart (I'm specifically referring to Jay Sean's "Down", of course). I think Jesse McCartney's singing and just this whole beat could be a lot more energetic, because this is definitely a viable dancey track that could be way better than it is now. A good song that makes me want more.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ok, I LIVED for Jesse McCartney when I was younger. I am like 90% sure that the Leavin' video was part of my sexual awakening, but this song is just terrible. The verses are a weird half singing half rapping thing and it just doesn't fit. The production sounds so bad and cheap, and I still unironically like Leavin'!

---
#like a baby

**gannade** (10): WHY ARE THERE SO MANY 11S IN THIS RATE

**mms82** (10): omg I totally forgot about this song such a cute song

**Mysario** (10): I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your Ludacris soul

**pearllouise** (10): Jesse McCartney will forever the pop girl that got away

**Roxieloxie** (10): name a bad luda verse, you physically cant

**selegend** (10): king

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): Jesse McCartney fucking deserves better

**1998tweety** (8): 2 kings

**jamesfog** (8): Cool video

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i think the songwriting here is great but the production being particularly 2009 drops a few points

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Oh Jesse McCartney. You were absolutely gonna be a thing until Bieber showed up and stole your thunder.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I love how this titular reference to the ex-Beatles classic goes along with Jesse’s surname, proving the long-running conspiracy that Paul McCartney and John Lennon were actually secret homosexual lovers. I was actually pleased at this being actually good when I first listened to it, but looking back some elements of the production are flawed and I actually have no desire to replay the song or loop parts of it in my head. That’s a bad sign.  Down goes my score.

**PuggleMaster** (7): this is a glorious mess

#I haven't slept in 5 days

**twat\_brained** (6.3): Jesse had another hit after Leavin'? This is definitely not as good as Leavin' is what I can deduce. In fact Luda's verse helped clear things up in this song for me, it's about a girl who ghosted Jesse before ghosting was even a thing. Points for being ahead of teh curve but not much else.

**rosecoloreds** (6): it's not beautiful soul

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): lcd soundsystem outsold

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): this sounded better as a kid

**NotWith10000Men** (5): meh. Never really liked jesse

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): edward cullen to bella swan #2009

**ryjomom** (4): Jesse McCartney is still alive?

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (4): this song is peak 2008. Yet it came out in 2009. Hmmmmm

**kappyko** (3.5): preset synths and jesse mccartney breathing. the most interesting part of this is the anxious, twitch-y production that would've been best handled by somebody with presence. as is, it's like how farrah abraham is featured over bonkers EDM and just screams over it

**radiofan15** (3.2): M. Night Shyamalan saw this video and decided he was way too white for the role of Prince Zuko on the Last Airbender movie and decided to cast Dev patel instead... so thank you HDYS for that! You gave to that movie some of its few redeemable qualities

**CreepyMannequin** (3): Had potential, but ends up underproduced - sounds like a demo.

**frogaranaman** (3): Why was this era of music so obsessed with sounding like a children's song?

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): I forgot Jesse McCartney existed and I'd like to go back please

**waluigiest** (2): not feeling it

**enecks** (1): This is maybe the worst beat of the year that didn't inspire a Todd in the shadows breakdown

**MrSwearword** (1): never knew it about then and I'm not surprised I don't like it now

#😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I sleep pretty badly most nights, thanks for asking Jesse!

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.3): i have insomnia

**rickikardashian** (6): with my eyes closed bitch

**ExtraEater**: Alright, so the repetitive house beat is sampled from a Nightcrawlers song, the “We at the hotel, motel, HOLIDAY INN” mantra is directly from Rappers’ Delight, the "Gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff" is from Jay-Z, and that one g-string lyric is from Biggie. Meanwhile, the original part of the song is a plain beat underneath overly detailed, childishly conceived (he really just went 1+1, 2+2, 3+3, AND 4+4 in the same song?), and hoarsely delivered rap verses about philandering to go have some dirty nasty sex. Already, I’ve concluded that this is one of the most vapid, empty, and utterly stupid Pitbull songs ever made.

But here’s the only real important question: Does it bop? Fuck. Yes.

**ImADudeDuh**: Fucking king of Hotels UGH! This is pitbull's motherfucking anthem for the working class latina hotel worker. Pitbull ENDS STEREOTYPES by rapping about all the latina women at the hotel who HAVE SEX and CHEAT ON THEIR MEN because they are their own women and can make their own decisions! Pitbull has some fucking highly deep lyrics such as "here goes some egg whites," which is a clever pun that uses egg whites as a substitute for ejacualte after the woman/women makes pitbull sexually aroused to completion. This song is extremely intellectual, and I assume the only reason it's out so soon is that most did not understand it's lyrics.

#Vacancy

**ggodisawomann** (10): hotel motel holiday win

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): god spoke to us through this song and i will preach that gospel until i die

**mich4725** (10): i don't care about the lyrics and fact it's a rework of old dance classic too much (pretty good job this time imo comparing to some songs Pitbull really ruins the original), this still is a massive bop and house party essential.

**mms82** (10): ugh we need Pitbull to come back

**moooo566** (10): DALE

**Mysario** (10): I exclusively go to Holiday Inns now, thank you Pitbull

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyfSLIPS95E&feature=youtu.be

**radiofan15** (9.5): Imagine thinking Pitbull is not the John Lennon of our time when he have gems like this

**kappyko** (9): i wish pitbull was bisexual

**Roxieloxie** (9): pitbull continues to bless my ears

**skargardin** (9): A wild guilty pleasure appeared

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): H O L I D A Y I N N

**twat\_brained** (9): WE AT THE HO! TEL! MO! TEL! HOLIDAY INN!!!!!!! Why did we all collectively decide we were sick of Pitbull? I don't get it, there's room on the charts for him

**izeasklapaucius** (8): The verse is awkward as fuck but the chorus slaps HARD

**MashLuke** (8): that sample makes the song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): tbh it deserves less but my friend is still obsessed with this song ten years later and it’s hilarious

**Tchalla1966** (8): HOTEL MOTEL HOLIDAY INNNN DALE

**waluigiest** (8): it’s a club banger and it does that well I think. HOTEL MOTEL HOLIDAY INN is iconic too

#Michael Vick made points

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Legendary chorus but the rest of the song is meh

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Ha, even Pitbull is here, eh? I’m not admitting that it’s anything more than a guilty pleasure, but I actually rather like Hotel Room Service. It’s not too noisy of a song, unlike a lot of other Pitbull, and the beat here is shamefully catchy. I don’t like the ‘forget about your boyfriend’ line in the chorus, though. Yeah, this is a mindless pop song and all, but a reference to possible cheating in the middle of it doesn’t strike me as quite that right!

**1998tweety** (6.5): He usually delivers massive bops but this ain't it.

**ManofOranges** (6.5): Not as bad as I Know You Want Me but this song was still so repetitive

**frogaranaman** (6): This song just charged $12 directly to my Paypal for taking a sip of water while listening to it.

**MrSwearword** (6): he wishes he could be Holiday Inn but he's flat out No Tell Motel

**pearllouise** (6): Yeah, I would like two pancakes and an Expresso

**GiftoftheGeek** (5): This song made me permanently lose any appetite for egg whites.

**jamesfog** (5): hotel motel.. ok and???

**rslashpoopheads** (5): the straights win again

**Plasm\_Trojan** (4.4): The sample saves this song quite a bit but the rest is still a Pitbull song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Meh

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.2): have they never been to a hotel before?

**enecks** (3): Gross cheating anthem. In other words, evidence Pitbull was hugely influential to the 2010s.

**selegend** (3): he could make my cheeks clap tbh

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2): The beat to this song got annoying about 20 seconds in, and it unfortunately got mixed with an unbearable hook and alot of Pitbull shouting, no más

**CopyCatJ** (1): glad he evolved as an artist

**gannade** (1): i really do not enjoy this

**NotWith10000Men** (1): ugh pitbull

**ReallyCreative** (1): Pitbull is just the worst

**ryjomom** (0): soaking with testosterone

**TragicKingdom1** (0): there was a mexican restaurant in town that had been open since before i was born that always had this song on their soundtrack. it went out of business around 2013. i like to imagine it was because of this song

**xxrandooxx** (0): Drink every time he mentions an establishment providing accommodations, meals, and other services for travelers and tourists.

**ExtraEater**: Surprisingly, I grew to like this quite a bit. It's been compared to Nickelback, a sentiment with which I mildly agree with the added caveat that Nickelback are not a bad band and their sound has always had potential for something really good, potential to which they occasionally lived up (see "How You Remind Me" and "If Today Was Your Last Day", for instance). Anthemic alternative rock like this can strike the right chord, and they do it here in a way that's possibly better than "Second Chance" from this year-end chart. This gives me the same positive feelings I do when listening to (the good songs from) Nickelback and most of Foo Fighters, so it's a solid song to me.

**ImADudeDuh**: tbh Daughtry is a heterosexual icon. I had multiple songs of his on my iPod in 2011. Home, Feels Like Tonight, It's Not Over, all 10's! But No Surprise, not as good as the rest. It still features his iconic, slightly-better-than-Nickelback vocals, and the expected vague but still kinda in your face obvious lyrics. It's a tepid bop!

---
#It's no surprise that Daughtry made a bop!

**ggodisawomann** (10): Daughtry is an incredible singer

**Mysario** (10): top 5 most influential American Idol participants

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): everyone talking about how hillary clinton was snubbed but did you even watch american idol s5e14

**mms82** (9.5): An AC radio bop

**jamesfog** (9): He deserved to win American Idol period

**ryjomom** (9): Daughtry satisfying my cringy music tastes

**1998tweety** (8.7): Rock bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Good and inoffensive song. It’s not bad but there’s nothing that stands out about it (other than its that guy from American Idol).

**NotWith10000Men** (8): man what a throwback. Daughtry was my intro to rock. Thx guys

**frogaranaman** (7): The perfect microcosm of Men's Rights.

**gannade** (7): kinda catchy oop

**MrSwearword** (7): Chris Daughtry was just a talented version of Chad Kroger and this proves as much

**Tchalla1966** (7): Lowkey a Bop, don’t care what yall say

#Taylor Hicks, Katharine McPhee, & Elliott Yamin stans

**twat\_brained** (6.4): I feel like Chris Daughtry's exit from American Idol was so unceremonious nobody expected him to have a few hits. When a rock band as generic as Daughtry is on the radio, which is made to appeal to everyone, it really is no surprise that he scraped a few hits out the barrel.

**rickikardashian** (6.3): ** Y E E H A W **

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): This is one of those songs that I don’t know the name of but I kind of remember how it goes because it shows up in commercials all the damn time.

**vapourlomo** (6): Daughtry is like if Nickleback had an actually decent singer. Still not my favorite style of rock, but at least it isn't painfully grating.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): a forgotten song by a forgotten band

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): This song made me consider raising my Shinedown score and that is a major sin

**enecks** (4): This is bad. No Surprise coming from Daughtry

**ReallyCreative** (4): I remember legitimately thought this was Nickelback the first few times I heard it, it's pretty generic and stupid regardless

**tapdancingpig** (4): This is just... so boring...

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.5): no surprise ive never heard this song before

**kappyko** (3): i listened to this and it literally disappeared from my ears

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): I listened to No Surprise once during the course of doing this rate. I was going through the Year-End backwards, and at this point I was really anxious to get to Empire State of Mind, because the lack of good music during this particular batch of songs on the chart was really getting to me. No Surprise stood in my way. I heard the song. I wasn’t sure what to make of the empty nothingness that accompanied it. I .nped the song on Discord so I could hear people’s thoughts. A friend of mine replied ‘oh no surprise is a remnant of the post-grunge boom just give it a 3 and move on’. That’s exactly what I chose to do. The end.

**waluigiest** (3): does not slap

**pearllouise** (2): I've probably heard this at Walmart too much

**radiofan15** (1): This isn't Radiohead!

**ExtraEater**: "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" and "You Spin Me Round" should honestly be thankful they got sampled by king Flo Rida himself. But really, the source material here is great and this is basically on par, as Wynter's contribution to this song is nothing to underrate. For anyone here who uses RYM, shoutout to pop-crazy icon [~No_](https://rateyourmusic.com/~No_) who I fondly associate this song with.

**ImADudeDuh**: So many bops already named Sugar, Flo had some big shoes to fill, and he got some small feet. This song is not good. First, the obvious sample that is somehow more irritating and autotuned than the original song. There is nothing really notable of this song. Not the lyrics, not the production, not Wynter, nothing. The only thing this has going for it is a fun melody.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): gets an extra point bc my friend was singing it once and sang “my lipe sugar” and I still bring it up

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): the man makes bangers

**hikkaru** (7): Flo Rida and sampling big songs with added electronic prodution name a more iconic duo

**PuggleMaster** (7): I only gave this a high score for the intro

#Sour :(

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): Honestly the most interesting thing about this song is that it samples Blue by Eiffel 65, and it just makes me wanna listen to Blue instead

**Plasm\_Trojan** (6.8): wtf i dont want to like this but it really isnt that bad

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): if popheads was around in 2009 then there would definitely be a notable contingent of Wynter Gordon stans calling her the next main pop girl

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the double dee double da is the only memorable part of the song

**Roxieloxie** (6): this song didn't deserve the sample

**selegend** (6): hes so corny lol

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): Right Round but less of a bop and even less original

**twat\_brained** (5.2): If nothing else Wynter Gordon sounds great here, but of all the 90s classics to sample why this? I don't want anyone touching the original; it's so bad it's actually kinda good. This is just lame and unuseful.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I actually just noticed the double pun in Flo Rida’s name after all these years (I’m dumb, we been knew) and it actually strikes me as quite clever but if there’s anything  I want to make clear it’s that I think his songs in this rate suck shit. (Yes, that includes Right Round. Sue me.) Wynter’s vocal contributions on the chorus here are average, and Flo’s flow is mostly forgettable. I’ll pass on listening to this ever again. Thanks.

**enecks** (4): I love ThatHustle.Com, and bad hooks!

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3): who the fuck thought sampling blue would be a good idea

**Tchalla1966** (3): This song should return to flo rida vault and never ESCAPE but the sample was nice.

**waluigiest** (3): mmmmmmm

**xxrandooxx** (3): The best part isn’t even original

**wholesomebody** (2): just awful sampling

**frogaranaman** (1): This was a full-blown trip to listen to.

**mich4725** (1): ruined the original, doesn't match it at all.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): This is...awful. Flo Rida is a useless rapper, as usual. The sample choice is weird and doesn’t match the mood of the song. The production is a mess, as nothing about it works. And it’s still catchy for some godforsaken reason.

**NotWith10000Men** (1): this song might actually be terrible

**tapdancingpig** (1): WHAT THE FUCK WAS WRONG WITH RAPPERS IN 2009 RUINING THEIR SAMPLES

#Who outsold? Who did it better?

**radiofan15** (10): I know i'm wrong but this outsold Eiffel 65

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): ariana who? maroon 5 who? stevia who?

**CarlieScion** (8): Blue (Da Ba Dee) outsold

**pearllouise** (8): Outsold Maroon 5

**GiftoftheGeek** (3): Never thought I'd say this but Maroon 5 did it better

**ryjomom** (2): I’m scared to say this, but Maroon 5 actually did this better

**ExtraEater**: The intro fools me into thinking I'm about to launch into "Don't Matter", a bigger bop, but hey hearing those minty synths is a pleasant surprise, too. It kinda has this big, super happy "yell it out to the world" message and attitude to it that I can't hate it, but I have to admit this sounds so amateur that I would call it a guilty pleasure if I ever even used the term. Anyway, I think it's funny how on the charts "Viva La Vida" is just sandwiched right between two Akon songs.

**ImADudeDuh**: I feel Akon is forever in the meh category of music unless he has a collaborator to help him. This song is fine. Akon's normal autotuned crooning is a little stilted and feels like a weird attempt to try and win this girl back by telling her "i want to make love right now." I mean, if it works, might as well go for it.

---
#Akon? more like Icon

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic bop

**CarlieScion** (10): B O P

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Sodium Sodium Sodium

**jamesfog** (9): BOP!

**kappyko** (9): Euro-dance synths combined with melancholy club R&B? Whew! Akon reaches into my heart and stomps all over me.

**pearllouise** (9): Akon is the next main pop girl. Gaga who? Katy who? Taylor who?

**skargardin** (9): Possibly the greatest song of all time

**Mysario** (8): I miss "Locked Up"

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): For some reason, I’ve always thought this song was called Make Up (Na Na Na). Akon’s voice is a bit funny here, and this is definitely kind of an awkward interlude in between the very good batch of songs from #41 to #50, but thankfully it still manages to be a pretty serviceable bop. Actually, I’d even call it better than Beautiful. Fight me.

**Tchalla1966** (8): Who was buying beautiful more than THIS? Wtf this was the MUCH better song smh I do hope this gets higher in the rate or yall cancelled.

**twat\_brained** (8): Looking back, Akon had brilliant production; he was a brilliant fixture on the pop charts, it's just a shame he never really had the vocals to back it up. I'm thankful he's been able to simultaneously light up both dancefloors and impoverished African communities. We need more people like him in the world

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): the chorus is memorable

**hikkaru** (7): Akon is so annoying but his songs are so iconic

**waluigiest** (7): chorus still goes in

#Never (ver ver ver ver)

**DrunkHurricane** (6.5): Akon's voice is awful

**radiofan15** (6.5): Me too Akon, but I don't have time to do it Right Now (Na Na Na)

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): sometimes i just remember akon exists and im like ???

**MrSwearword** (5): not bad enough to get nuked, not good enough for higher

**wholesomebody** (5): na na na na

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): an earworm but also very annoying

**enecks** (4): Do I like this? Nah, nah, nah.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (4): wow Akon had a lot of hits in the US. And it seems that the lower down the charts we get, the worse the songs get too

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): Is this a good song? Na Na Na Na Na

**ryjomom** (3): (ba)nanananananananannananaanannanana

**xxrandooxx** (2.5): *Sigh*

**ariannagrandtitties** (2): 2009 was very repetitive

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): Gross.

**frogaranaman** (1): Someone has had sex to this song.

**ExtraEater**: Ah, emotional alt-rock and its adjacent genres was brimming with life (death?) in the 2000s. It's just a real shame this rate doesn't get to cover the big iconic songs like "Bring Me to Life" or "In the End", for instead we get to rate a Daughtry song (a good one, mind you) and this song. Still, I like the chorus quite a lot (I found myself preferring this to "No Surprise" overall) and the funny, stupidly edgy parent-defying trope continues to "resonate". The best part of this song being in the rate is how I can make a joke about how there are so many songs in this rate getting a Second Chance after the Ultimate 2008 rate, but I wasn’t sure of how to work it into any of the other posts. I hope you understand.

**ImADudeDuh**: Shinedown is probably one of the most forgotten artists on this list, and this song doesn't really seem like we're missing much. I still like this song, but this is very early 2000's adult contemporary rock. It sort of blends together with the Nicklebacks and the Creeds and the The Callings. It's still a pretty great song for being about realizing your dream and actually how difficult it is to go out and try to chase it. You have to say goodbye to some people that you know and just hope they understand it's your dream. It sounds very "this isn't my dream, dad......... its YOUR dream" but I still appreciate it.

---
#Tell my mother, tell my father, this song fucking slaps

**Mysario** (10): I feel like this song is gonna be dragged because it's a rock song on a pop subreddit but it's honestly really good with a really well done build up

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): shit i accidentally just bought a wolf hat, a ford f-150, and a bass pro shops gift card

**ryjomom** (9.5): edgy rock of the 2000s is my kink

**CarlieScion** (9): bop

**gannade** (9): its nice but its a male

**skargardin** (9): oh wow the throwback is fucking real

**1998tweety** (8.5): Pretty decent

**ggodisawomann** (8.5): an emotional bop

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): People love shitting on bands like Shinedown and Nickelback but this song is actually good.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): my favorite band but not even in the top twenty of my favorite songs of theirs

**jamesfog** (7.5): Radio bop

**Awhile2** (7): edgy 10 year old me thought this music video was an emotional piece of art. Now im watching it and the dudes literally singing all dramatically standing on some sand dunes in the sunset like something straight out of a jon lajoie parody. Song still bops though

**poppinmmolly** (7): I used to HAAAAAATE this song back then. I vehemently loathed, despised, actively hated this song but re listening to it...it's not that bad lol.

#You're out of chances

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I don’t think I’ve ever heard this song ever and it was one of the most popular?

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I’ve never heard of Shinedown even once before doing this rate, so them being this high on the Year-End is a genuine shock to me. I’ve seen some people call them a less terrible Nickleback since. Well, for what it’s worth, I could definitely see why the likes of Second Chance could be considered a guilty pleasure (I’m not quite sure what the song is even about other than a vague combination of family tensions and growing up) but it’s definitely not a song that bores me. It might just be your typical rock radio fair, but, hey, I’ll take what I can get.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6.5): this was on the billbord year-end chart? Imagine that this year

**izeasklapaucius** (6): eh

**MashLuke** (6): I swear only Americans know this song

**ReallyCreative** (6): I remember listening to this song and thinking it was so deep, ugh. It's not that bad I guess but like, jesus christ, this song tries way too hard in places, I have no way of knowing what this song is about it's just too much.

**selegend** (6): this is a day 1 song but i like it

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): This song is the definition of buttrock but it’s nostalgic idc

**TragicKingdom1** (6): too loud and dramatic for me but mildly bops

**vapourlomo** (6): I want to give this a bad score purely based on my distaste for post-grunge sludge...but idk, this lead singer's voice isn't that grating. And that soaring chorus is actually decent.

**wholesomebody** (6): i have massive nostalgia for this but i am very very glad that post grunge and all that died out after this song

**twat\_brained** (5.7): Wasn't the point of us forgetting about Creed supposed to be a lesson to not let another Creed infect the radio airwaves? I'm fairly certain Amerian Idol was waning by this point so I don't know why American Idol-core music. For all the complaining I do about artists not doing enough I haven't addressed the unpleasantness of artists OVERdoing it, which deserves to be spotlighted here.

**frogaranaman** (5): This is what white school shooters listen to.

**xxrandooxx** (5): Id give this song a second chance

**enecks** (4): 2012 couldn't come soon enough for the charts holy fuck

**MrSwearword** (4): I didn't remember this but hearing it I thought "yikes who wants to sound like Train"

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): ick

**Roxieloxie** (4): its just kinda ... there

**waluigiest** (3): this makes me angry idk why

**mich4725** (2.5): is this Nickelback?

**DrunkHurricane** (2): this is so angsty and cringey

**pearllouise** (2): If you put Hot Topic and white trash in a blender

**radiofan15** (2): Nickelback sounds good here

**ExtraEater**: Yep, it's an instrumental mess. It could be, like, a good instrumental mess in the vein of "Single Ladies" or "Run the World (Girls)", but this bores me in all aspects. The repetitive high-pitched "Diva" doesn't really grab me, and I don't find the production grating or abnormal, it's just plain... boring. In all ways but sound this reminds me of Taylor's "White Horse" in that it charted low in this year-end and hardly even comes off as a single and more of a deep cut (a mediocre deep cut, to be specific). This is, if I recall correctly, the only song I gave a 1.

**ImADudeDuh**: Diva is very often called Beyonce's worst single, and tbh they make a very compelling case. The annoying production that sounds like the squeaky boots of spongebob, Beyonce's cockiness that seems kinda off-putting, and the weird violins(?) that sound like the background music of the shower scene in Psycho. It's just one of her worst produced songs and one of her most irritating.

#Main pop diva

**bespectacIed** (10): Literally can't listen to this song without screaming LIGHTS!!! SOMEBODY GETTING FIRED HEY HEY.

**CarlieScion** (10): queen

**gannade** (10): yeah im a twink, what about it? Thank u, next.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Anyone who gives this less than an 8 is NOT a bad bitch.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song slaps and gets too much hate here

**pearllouise** (9): [SOMEBODYS GETTIN FIRRRED] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCJRp5S25eQ)

**enecks** (8): It's called hentai and it's art

**NotWith10000Men** (8): if it was less repetitive it would be a 9

**Roxieloxie** (8): the " ima a diva" makes it hard to sing

**tapdancingpig** (8): I go back and forth on this song. I won’t be sad if it goes out immediately, but right now I think it bops.

**waluigiest** (8): all over the place but in a fun way

**radiofan15** (7.8): I see someone likes Lil Wayne's A Milli

**MrSwearword** (7): production is fine for what it is, but I still think is more of a Lil Kim song that Bey ended up with

**TragicKingdom1** (7): bangladesh production has aged surprisingly well considering it sounds horrible conceptually, but this has grown into a bop over the years for me

#Oh let's break it DOWN

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): first of all dva is greater than any other gamergirl by definition. she is the entire reason why most girls can appreciate overwatch seeing as how she is one of the few video game ladies that is respectable all things considered. I bet you enjoy playing Tomb Raider and Portal 2 just because you can play as a girl but there is more to it than that with dva. 1) to start she's asian with says alot for how much she stands out to in international market 2) she is more than a girl 3) SHE IS A GAMER she plays starcarft2 so she knows a thing or two about video games unlike you. i actually wish she was real so she could personnelly tell you a thing or two about diversity. PLEASE learn to respect others before saying something you know will piss them off. but whatever you believe is cute sweetie.

#"Diva" is a female version of a shit song

**jamesfog** (6.5): One of her worst singles :sorry:

**1998tweety** (6): Bey usually delivers but this...ain't it

**ariannagrandtitties** (6): too repetitive

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): This used to be the one very much loathed song from Sasha Fierce, Beyonce’s messiest and most polarizing album, and while it’s not exactly left that legacy today, I’m pretty sure we’ve all agreed at this point that we’d listen to it a thousand times over Video Phone, which is a million times more dated and a million times more unbearable. When I reached this point in the rate I thought ‘oh no, this is going to be bad’ but listening to Diva I actually got the impression that even if this song is mediocre, it’s entertaining mediocrity, you know? Its actual music qualities are bad, but Beyonce’s performance suits its name and probably saves everything. I’ll give this to the Queen.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): I can’t even imagine why people don’t like the Sasha Fierce era

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): i listened to apeshit on repeat earlier today and this seems like a precursor tbh

**ManofOranges** (5): Beyonce kind of snapped but also not really at all

**vapourlomo** (5): I guess Bey wanted her own A Milli?

**ryjomom** (4): Repetitive af

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): honestly always hated this song

**twat\_brained** (4): I hate this song so I'll just get this out the way so I won't have to see it again. Beyoncé, as ever, sounds great, so her vocals are not the issue, but the production is just so unbelievably wack that I have no idea how it a) made it onto the Sasha Fierce tracklist and b) made it to the Year-End Hot 100. And the worst thing is this may survive to day 2.

**xxrandooxx** (4): So your telling me that all those white moms with “Wine Diva” glasses are hustlers?

**frogaranaman** (3): Corporate feminism ghost wrote this song.

**skargardin** (3): this was a choice

**ggodisawomann** (2): again, a bad year for Yonce in my eyes

**hikkaru** (1): Literally HOW has this avoided my zero twice now?????? This is a garbage song with the most obnoxious production possible and melody-less singing that makes my ears bleed. While Sasha Fierce may have had immense success on the charts (there are so many songs from it in this rate), Beyonce thankfully showed us a few years later that she's capable of far better than... this.

**mich4725** (1): this song is a mistake, I don't get what is this beat trying to be.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Man, this is not good at all. Smh

**Plasm\_Trojan** (1): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/296794469825642497/542483925440921603/diva.png
