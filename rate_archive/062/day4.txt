**ExtraEater**: Look, from the very beginning, this song just feels like one of the most−excuse my language−”epic” dance songs to hit the big city streets, being as captivating as all the labyrinth-esque house tracks from the 90s and back. Fuck “grand”, fuck “big”, this is straight up epic, like the level of The Odyssey but for something as simple as a night out on the town. There’s a certain wistfulness to those synth strings, channeling the power of all the good nights long past and using it to prepare for another great night. Like, it just gives you this feeling that tonight’s going to be a good, good night. I think the lyrics mentioned something about that, too. As it progresses towards the end, the synths start to rise up and the song just keeps accelerating towards the climax. The song never really gets into any kind of aggressive tempo, but this thing just drives to the end like a party monster: When they start chanting “MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY”, the whole foundation of meaningful music collapses. There is nothing anymore. There is only raw, dumb pop. There is only heavenly light. There is only I Gotta Feeling by The Black Eyed Peas. Tonight really is gonna be a good night.

**ImADudeDuh**: One of the most fun songs ever, period! That's really all I can say about it.

---
#Mazel Tov

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic bop

**\_wailordfan** (10): This is a bop and a half. Like, legitimately one of the best songs of the 2000s.

**bespectacIed** (10): I think this had a long run as the highest selling digital single of all time (not sure if still is). One of the best and most ubiquitous club bangers of all time. Relistening to the opening instrumental after all these years kinda makes me emotional, this is such a hopeful song

**fishingfor8** (10): I GOTTA FEELLLLIIINGGG

**ManofOranges** (10): My favorite Black Eyed Peas song it's just so feel good and anthemic anyone who thinks otherwise can exit

**MashLuke** (10): Party every day, pa pa pa, party every day

**MrSwearword** (10): for what it is, it's a jam

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Tchalla1966** (10): God I wish I was old enough when this dropped and been able to get drunk and have a GOOD night

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This was my favourite song when I was younger for the longest time. It’s not my favourite song anymore but it’s still fun and I love it. It goes off at parties and socials still!

**Plasm\_Trojan** (9.5): This is by the same band that made "Imma Be"???

**xxrandooxx** (9.2): Made me who I am today

**ggodisawomann** (9): this was an ANTHEM in 2009

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): the mv gives me a lot of emotions for some particular reason? i literally bought it on itunes? also i should have known i was gay sooner lmao i was obsessed with the lingerie shots lmfao

**jamesfog** (9): Mega bop

**moooo566** (9): classic banger

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This song is such dumb fun I love it.

**Roxieloxie** (9): wow can you imagine going to a party in 2009 and being able to dance to this song. God i wish that were me

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): This fucking bangs idc what anyone says

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Welcome to every middle school dance, bar mitzvah, and quinceañera from 2009 to 2012, MAZELTOV

**vapourlomo** (9): The Black Eyed Peas were such dorks and I love it. MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THUUUURSDAY

**waluigiest** (9): nostalgia and middle school me had garbage taste but this song DOES something to me

**radiofan15** (8.9): TENGO UN SENTIMIENTO QUE ESTA NOCHE SERA GRANDIOSA...

**ryjomom** (8.5): Best Black-Eyed Pea Soup Song

**enecks** (8): This is kinda weak in parts of the production, but damn it it's a party song that actually feels fun.

**hikkaru** (8): I can still feel the middle school dances getting LIT

**selegend** (8): gives me war flashbacks but also is one of the most emblematic songs of the electropop era

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.9): “let’s shut it down” -the orange cheeto 2k19

**jval888** (7.5): was so  awesome then has not aged well but will remain

**Mysario** (7.5): I used to hate this song for so many reasons but it grew on me like a fungus so I kind of like it now I guess

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): this still gets pretty regular rotation here??? enough to where this doesn't fill me with nostalgia like some of the other songs in this rate

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Being dumb doesn't exclude you from being fun!!!

**pearllouise** (7): Fergie, will.i.am, and their backup singers

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I used to hate this song as well but it’s got a much better instrumental than the other BEP song on this list. It’s stupid but it’s catchy and fun and I’m okay with it now.

#The Black Eyed Peas' Superbowl performance

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): ok i listened to this song to death in 6th grade to the point that i hated it, and then at my school disco they played this song about 15 times so it’s traumatic

**twat\_brained** (6.8): This just came on the radio so since it's on I may as well just rate it. The hook is pretty basic, I'll admit, and some of the lyrics I disagree with, like "look at her dancing, just take it off", and it feels like "mazel tov, La Chaim" is just a cheap pander to the Jewish crowd. For 2009 this was great. In 2019, I still have a mild appreciate for what it is, but I'm content to leaving it in the past.

**frogaranaman** (6): I'm still not sure what the fuck this band does.

**izeasklapaucius** (5): It's not as bad as I first heard it back then, surprisingly.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i acknowledge how it's a dumb party bop but i find the production where it's just DUN-DUN-DUN-DUN repeating into the void to be really grating, especially because the song is 5 minutes long

**tapdancingpig** (4): I feel like this song is secretly good... I’m not sure how?

**ReallyCreative** (3): Generic, boring, the Black Eyed Peas really haven't aged well, especially their stuff after Monkey Business but even just in general

**NotWith10000Men** (1): god I hated this song then and I hate it now

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): This was spammed every single night as a child by my neighbours when we moved in with my dad and it forever haunts my memories. Sometimes I can stay back and distance myself from my memories, and briefly consider giving this song a higher score, because the hook isn’t all that bad, but then they count down the days of the week and I have to skip the song to save my wellbeing. I’m not sure if this sub is gonna loathe this or love it, but if it’s the latter, I’m sorry.

**ExtraEater**: The showstopper, and the song that endured a lot of controversy as a well-loved song that still drew in its share of naysayers. Ethereal violins and synths(?) combine with top tier "rapping" to make what can only be described as a perfect "girly teenager in the 2000s" pop anthem. The verses are a thousand times more engaging, iconic, and better than any verses from [insert straight rap anthem here, how about "Rap God" by Eminem?], the chorus immediately comes with a desire to belt it out, and this production is just flawless for its time. There are a lot of songs I'm surprised not to see in the Top 20 over half of the songs in the Top 20, but this is the one I'm most surprised about.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song got the most 11's in the rate. Make with that what you will. This song has some great moments between the sisters. I think that the strings are pretty great and the perfect way to grab the attention of the listener and be a great production hook. The stuttering syllables are kinda offputting however, it just feels unecessary and dumb. Still a major bop though.

---
#I just can't resist this song

**bespectacIed** (11): In a rate about one of the strongest years in pop music, full of iconic singles from legendary artists, am I really giving my 11 to a relatively unknown Australian duo's one hit wonder? YES. The lyrics are laughably basic and repetitive, but I don't care. The guttural electric guitars, the sudden change to pulsating synth beats in the bridge, and of course the fucking strings all-throughout the song --- they all made me the person I am today.

**letsallpoo** (11): quite possibly the best chorus in the history of pop music

**Mysario** (11): this song unironically changed my life

**nightjesus** (11): wait this came out in 2007 lol okay America you slept on that one

**ReallyCreative** (11): This is one of the few songs I gave a 10 in this rate that I still actively listen to regularly and include in my more "modern" playlists. As a result it's a perfect choice for my 11.

**rosecoloreds** (11): justice for the veronicas they deserved more!!! a timeless bop

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (11): this song is so unbelievably iconic i can’t even describe it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): they walked so mozart could run

**waluigiest** (11): the first time I heard this song was just a few months ago. I was drunk cleaning the kitchen with my friend and I danced so hard I slipped and fell on my ass. I got up without missing a beat but it hurt so bad I limped for a few days.

**1998tweety** (10): oh wow pop perfection

**enecks** (10): STRAYA REPRESENT. Fucking oath!

**ggodisawomann** (10): another contender for my 11, this song is a beast

**jamesfog** (10): Fucking classic. LOVE THIS SONG!!!

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The best one-hit wonder of the year

**skargardin** (10): I HAVEN’T HEARD THIS IN AGES I’M CRYING AT THE PERFECTION

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I probably should give this my 11 seeing as an Australia will never win another rate so if it comes 2nd by like .3 i’ll neck myself

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this honestly kinda sounds like a parody of a pop song you'd see in a TV show but still an iconic bop that holds up much better than basically any other song with guitars in this rate

**hikkaru** (9.5): Australian queens

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Those strings at the beginning of the song are so iconic. I didn’t even know the same of the song before this but I recognized the strings instantly.

**ManofOranges** (8.5): This song is by no means bad but I just don't really hear what everybody else hears? Like I don't think it's particularly astounding or anything

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Maybe Aussies deserve rights.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): When you say you want scene to be left in the 2000s, that means leaving the Veronicas in the 2000s. Are you prepared to make that sacrifice?

**pearllouise** (8): The Veronicas were so ahead of their time. It's a shame we never saw them again, alexa play Cry For You.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Okay I had never heard of this song going in but I actually enjoy this. It’s a bit all over the place but I really like the main synth melody and those strings add a bit of weight to the track. It’s like an early Avril track but probably better than most Avril singles

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is another song people are hyping up a lot that I don’t get. Every girl group in between Destiny’s Child and Little Mix feels like a mystery from another time to me, and while Untouched is a nice mix of pop punk style delivery and glitz I have no inclination to check out more of the Veronicas or even bother to look up who they are when I listen to this. I can tell that this is going to be an underdog and I’m not especially angry about that, but I’m not happy, either.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://i.redd.it/ghygheu38z621.jpg

#Unfabulous

**xxrandooxx** (6.8): Instrumentals are great!!! The rest made this meh.

**frogaranaman** (6): This song sounds like how emo bangs look.

**GiftoftheGeek** (6): MySpace in one song

**Roxieloxie** (6): for how much you all hyped this up i expected this to better

**ariannagrandtitties** (5.7): meh

**radiofan15** (4.2): Cute but this is basically Aly & AJ's Potential Breakup Song and Vanessa Carlton's A Thousand Miles combined... also the lyrics are tragic at best

**ryjomom** (4): okkay

**fishingfor8** (3): i have a feeling this is gonna mess something up

**MrSwearword** (3): wasted production

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): i like this song but now i'm morally conflicted about one of the veronicas being predatory so i can't in good conscience rate it high

**NotWith10000Men** (1): nope. Bad

**\_wailordfan** (0): [Ok so this song is literally just like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQHx_GPKccY)

**CarlieScion** (0): why are yall gunning so hard for a girl-group consisting 50% a borderline pedophile?

**ExtraEater**: The "da da da da" refrain immediately solidifies this, really. I prefer this to "Sober" as far as reflective, sober-sounding P!nk songs go, particularly because it just sounds so easygoing and the melody is catchier. It's an uneventful song in that it kinda has nothing special about it beyond that refrain (except maybe the chorus), but what a nicely delivered refrain.

**ImADudeDuh**: I remember watching the music video cause my mom showed me and she thought it was one of the funniest videos she'd seen. I ain't gonna mention the video but the song is just more proof that P!nk is an icon. P!nk's voice is so great on this and she does a good balancing act of being an angry bitch and trying her hardest to win back her man. People might call this problematic but idgaf, it's still a bop.

#Pink can chase me with an ax anytime

**1998tweety** (10): My favourite P!nk songs have always been the bops where she gets more emotional and this one is no exception.

**jamesfog** (10): Yas!

**MrSwearword** (10): a lovingly demented and fucked up song; basically Pink's branding

**pearllouise** (10): Don't leave me either, bitch

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): this song doesn’t get enough respect around here, so watch this get robbed

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): is there an album with singles as fucking flawless as funhouse? the answer is no.

**radiofan15** (9.7): I have't heard this one before (weird) but I instantly loved it... the background ''da-da-das'' threatened to be annoying but they're just so catchy

**waluigiest** (9): pink was so sad this year…. Alexa…….

**ryjomom** (8.7): me at serotonin.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (8.5): The singing in the background really makes this song great.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I like this account of her relationship with her husband better than "True Love". I can also tell this is a Max Martin song because it has the same strum pattern as "Who Knew". Most importantly, I lowballed this song during the 2008 rate. I will not do that again, but what I will do is listen to Funhouse in its entirety at some point.

**bespectacIed** (8): Releasing this cute bop after the high octane singles was a great choice

**mich4725** (8): ,5 Wow Pink really was on fire that year

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song just makes me feel things...

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): See, I can get why Please Don’t Leave Me might be widely liked by other people. You have a pop girl, you have relationship troubles, you have above average lyrics and you have a bass. It’s a foolproof formula! And, by that measure, I like the song too. The thing is, I actually have a problem with this song because of its lyrics. They seem to be describing a toxic relationship, and, yeah, look, I get that that was Pink’s intention, but I can’t help but notice that some of the toxicity here seems to come from Pink herself. ‘You’re my perfect little punching bag’ in particular kind of irks me. I don’t think this song is Problematic with a capital P at all, but it ain’t for me.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): an uneventful bop

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.2): i wont leave u pink

#How did she become so obnoxious?

**enecks** (7): Lesser 00's pink is still good

**frogaranaman** (7): I can't believe Isabella travelled forward in time to write a song about Heathcliff. 😍

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): this doesn’t hit me as hard as sober, but I still dig this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): gets an extra point for the video

**ReallyCreative** (6.7): It's very okay but that's about it, much like the majority of Pink's discography

**xxrandooxx** (6.1): Pink out here owning 2009

**NotWith10000Men** (6): she's had worse songs, she's had better

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): i mean..... it's also not 'so what'

**ExtraEater** (11): [essay ahead] I just can't believe we're rating the best song ever made (we rated Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams" too, but this is Best-er). The first reason I love this is because of the total nostalgia factor: Although I probably didn't remember much of it during the year of 2009 (more 2010 really), it was certainly a cornerstone of my childhood in general. When people say "Fireflies" sounds like a total anomaly on the charts because of how different it sounds, it seriously did in my young mind; Nothing else really sounded this deep in grandeur. I love this song for how BIG it is, from those heavenly strings to the way every chorus explodes as if I’m in a rocket launching into outer space. Beyond being a total banger, the lyrics conjure such whimsical imagery that still arrests me to this day. I enjoy the melancholy and sadness in his lyrics, but overall I personally associate this song more with joy and happiness more than the "sadboi in his room" vibe. I love discovering and exploring the vast expanse of music out there, and I've found so much gold, underrated and overrated and timeless and dated and whatnot, but more often than not it's always going to be the songs that I heard first and still love that resonate the most. "Fireflies", I feel, gets the best of both worlds: One of the first songs I heard and loved that STILL holds up because really it's always been top quality.

**ImADudeDuh**: Oh fuck yeah. Fireflies is the motherfucking anthem of youthful wonder. No other song has truly felt like you are looking at the world through a child's eyes quite like Fireflies. It may be written a little oddly, but that just adds to the charm. It's looking at the world and realizing its real and full of so much great things that you want to see. Maybe it's uncool, but this song is not trying to pull off cool. It's just trying to put beauty in words, and it succeeds at that.

#ily

**Roxieloxie** (11): *Dear Diary*,  Ten years ago I was seven. I remember hearing this song on radio disney on my Dora Boom Box. It was a different city and a different time. Ten years later I am 17 about to go off to college in august. God, There's something so poetic about this song the way that it sounds so happy but the lyrics are so melancholy that I never realized back then that really reflecting on now just really make me evaluate my entire teen years. In a way Fireflies is truly a representation of my rose tinted nostalgia mixed my cynical apathetic nature just swirling around me in a vortex of emotions that i don't think any song could ever perfectly capture.

#'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs

**CarlieScion** (11): imagine hating this song. cant relate.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): ok so sad story time i listened to this song on my way to school every morning in Year 7 while i was getting pretty badly bullied, so listening to it again makes me cry, but at the same time, it’s really beautiful so i have a complex relationship with this song cause the chorus makes me cry but i don’t know if it’s out of admiration of the song or trauma

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic masterpiece Disney channel commercial excellence

**enecks** (10): Why did I give this a high score?

**frogaranaman** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThxaAo1QFSw

**ggodisawomann** (10): if you rate this lower than 10 you are fucking LYING and don't deserve 10,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs

**hikkaru** (10): FUCK ICONIC AHHHHHHHHHHHH

**mich4725** (10): no explanation needed, fantastic pop track.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): If you don’t like this song, than you’re a miserable human being.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (10): I still can't believe this actually hit number 1.

**poppinmmolly** (10): everybody's favorite song that year

**rickikardashian** (10): I can literally see the car comercial this song was featured on

**rslashpoopheads** (10): If you don't like this are you even a pophead?

**twat\_brained** (10): YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOUR EYES IF ADAM POSTED "HEY GUYS, I'M OWL CITY, AMA" fuckin timeless classic right here, I'm really disappointed to not give this my 11

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): lowkey an iconic song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.3): i was obsessed with owl city, i was even obsessed with his other project sky sailing. make pop sweet, soft hearted, and eccentric again !!

**skargardin** (9): y'all hear sumn?

**xxrandooxx** (8.9): Got me through moving to college <3

**kappyko** (8): i cant believe this guy ripped off such an important indie band for his tOtAlLy soulless hit single, and decided to rip them off for his career - you guessed it: german electronic band the notwist deserved better

**MashLuke** (8): iconic in its own way

**ryjomom** (8): Overrated

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.8): got me through middle school

**waluigiest** (7): I HATED owl city when this song came out. It was part of my youthful edginess, and I can grow to appreciate his music more. But I also recognize(d) that a lot of these lyrics are not deep but just bloated in a weird pander-y way. It’s a cute song tho

#An extraordinary song

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this song is the reason this rate is happening.

^ *[Editor's Note: This is legitimately true]*

**jamesfog** (10): Classic. /u/ExtraEater

**Mysario** (10): an extra good song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): stream cinematic

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I will admit that I’m not a super huge fan of this song because the production turns into kind of a weird misty atmosphere during Fireflies’ chorus, but despite that one flaw I do think that this is a very memorable throwback to elementary school that’s further sanctified by the fact that it is no longer played at every school ceremony that I go to. Reflecting back on that, I shall give it a higher score for Extra.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Idk how I feel about it but my girlfriend loves it so it’s an 8, I hope this appeases you Extra

**gannade** (5): i am really sorry extra but i dont enjoy this

#[I agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMaLi0xsEWY)

**vapourlomo** (7): The melody is killer, and I even kind of respect the dedication to ripping off The Postal Service. But those lyrics...yeesh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): the postal service.

**CopyCatJ** (4): postal service did it better

#Such an insomniac

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): Nonsensical lyrics + annoying voice, the sound is actually fine but I can't take this song even remotely seriously

**jval888** (2): i never got this either

**MrSwearword** (1): it's trying to be cute but this shit is so weak especially against the field presented

**NotWith10000Men** (1): I hated this song before I ever heard it

**ExtraEater**: The greatest song ever made. If you don’t like this, I don’t believe you. Following Ne-Yo’s “Closer” just the previous year, “Down” snatches the crown for the best and most uplifting cheesy electro-R&B club song of the late 2000s. For anyone familiar with the DJ Earworm mashup for 2009, the phrase “down” was a recurring lyric, and no better than “Down (feat. Lil Wayne)” to be emblematic of this and lead the pack. Songs with a “Go to a club, throw away your worries, and have a good time” philosophy have lasted since the dawn of pop music (in 2009 alone, you have “I Gotta Feeling”), but “Down” assures me better than (almost) no other. Also, “I’m down like the economy” is the best lyric in this whole rate. Remember the late 00s recession? Lil Wayne does. This song wants to lift your spirits back up, and the question is: Are you down?

**ImADudeDuh**: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the for our national anthem. "Down like the economy" single handedly saved our motherfucking economic system. Do you think Jay Sean and Lil Wayne knew they were making the greatest song of all time when they stepped into the studio? Who would've thought they would later inspire not one, but TWO songs by some future one hit wonder in 2019? This song is the definition of the phrase "UGH their MINDS".

---
#Fuck yeah, I'm down!

**poppinmmolly** (11): I had a lot of deliberation about my 11 and I realized that I would be the most upset if this left before it absolutely had to.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): holy shit it was so hard to pick my 11 but it has to be this. What over song has the iconic line “I’m down like the economy?” This is like my 5th most played song of all time

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): This is literally the song I request every time I’m in an uber and drunk and there are MANY videos of me and my friends screaming the chorus to this

**1998tweety** (10): Jay Sean a HOT ethnic king, we STAN. Down is THAT bop, Sweet but Psycho is SHOOK

**Awhile2** (10): waynes verse on this might just be the greatest rap verse of all time

**gannade** (10): jay sean is fucking HOT

**ggodisawomann** (10): this was my jam

**ignitethephoenix** (10): another iconic song that actually hasn’t aged too badly!

**ManofOranges** (10): A classic

**MashLuke** (10): he did that

**Mysario** (10): me when this song comes on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNGAjyhWoy0

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): something something ava max

**jamesfog** (9.5): Aged like fine wine. I get the Sweet but Psycho comparisons, but the song is not a ripoff at all. xoxo

**mms82** (9.5): wow it holds up

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): I couldn't tell you why I love this song, I have no reason to love this song, but this is one of my lowkey favorite bops to come out of 2009. It's so simple and the autotune might be a little thick at times but it's fun and straightforward.

**izeasklapaucius** (9): a legend and some south asian guy cue mariah idk her gif.

**kappyko** (9): The chorus melody is one of the best in memory honestly. Lil Wayne snapped when he said "honestly I'm down like the economy", he snatched the wig off of Pitbull's head. There just isn't enough of it!!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): something something, Ava max joke. But really this song is a bop and a half and that Lil Wayne verse is killer.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): half of this score is nostalgia, half is weezy's verse

**waluigiest** (9): down like the economy.... this song captures a moment in time so well

**twat\_brained** (8.4): At night Cirkut's screaming "I'm-ma-ma-ma-out of ideas so I'll just revamp this forgotten #1 lol" so anyway the moral of this song is a) pop music is derivative as fuck and b) stream Sweet but Psycho so Ava Max can get a top 10 single. In all seriousness, Down is still a pretty fun tune and I'm glad the pop girl prophecy allowed me to rediscover it. Weezy's verse is kinda meh though

**bespectacIed** (8): Distinctly remembered being angry that this song broke BEP's record 20+ consecutive weeks at number 1 but this song is cute

**enecks** (8): This is really good! Good job Jay Wayne and Lil Sean

**frogaranaman** (8): This song really banged in that AirPods commercial.

**MrSwearword** (8): here today gone tomorrow but a nice little nostalgia bomb

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): In the midst of all the various iconic masterpieces (not that this can’t be considered one, though I’m personally not quite on the hype train) and disastrous ruins in this rate that have a lot of cultural context attached to them, Down has no controversy attached to it with the brief exception of Ava Max. It stands out for being no more than a fun throwback to 2009, which it deserves condemnation for alone. Also, did you guys know that Jay Sean is British? Can you even hear that in his voice? I sure can’t. I had to read his Wiki article twice when I learned that.

**ryjomom** (8): I’m down baby, but lil wayne should leave the room

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): i genuinely can’t seperate this song from the DJ Earworm Remix now

**TragicKingdom1** (8): how did jay sean have 3 hits. i originally had it as a 6.5 but i miraculously heard it on the radio during the 2 days in january i did this rate and that saved its score

**vapourlomo** (8): The world forgot about this song, and I kind of understand why — it's pretty generic. But it's also a fun, bouncy little time capsule, so I kind of love it.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (7.9): I don't really like Wayne on this, but it's nice otherwise.

**Roxieloxie** (7.6): if i was 17 in 2009 i'd probably love this song

**hikkaru** (7.5): iconic

**selegend** (7): “down like the economy” is the best lyric of the century

**Tchalla1966** (7): wow Ava Max did THAT

#Down like the economy

**fishingfor8** (6): fuck you popheads

**rslashpoopheads** (6): People joke about Ava Max doing it better but that's actually the tea.

**xxrandooxx** (4): Lil Wayne ruined this song.

**mich4725** (3.5): not that bad but very generic and Lil Wayne doesn't match it at all.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): i am giving this a 3 because of the vertical video on spotify and the intense mediocrity

**pearllouise** (3): Ava did it better

**radiofan15** (1.5): I've shitted pieces of crap with more substance and artistic value than this song

**tapdancingpig** (1): This song bores the fuck out of me. It has since I first heard it on the radio.

**starla\_** (0): The MOST annoying song released that year

**ExtraEater**: Alright, let's slow down for a moment. This isn't even one of the best selections from Circus as far as being fun and catchy goes ("If U Seek Amy" and "Circus" both have that in spades), but I still have a soft spot for the chorus. I definitely admit to listening to this a lot just to perfect my attempts at singing along to it.

**ImADudeDuh**: Does anyone remember that show Don't Forget The Lyrics? I remember once the final bonus round was Womanizer and some lady perfectly did the correct "womanizer woman womanizer, you're a womanizer, oh womanizer oh, you're a womanizer baby" and I was fucking shook. This is a great song. Britney does her best at calling out MEN for their shit! Queen!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): It's a bop but it's not anywhere near my favorite Britney song

**ggodisawomann** (8): a solid bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Britney’s comeback single sure isn’t the best from her discography, or from Circus, for that matter, and its production in particular has noticeably aged like milk. The funny thing about all this is that Womanizer still manages to be fun enough to forgive for its flaws. Maybe we’re just happy it bought Britney back, or maybe Britney’s accent working on the song’s repetitive nature legitimately makes Womanizer a success. I’m not sure why I like it, and I don’t care to find out why, but this is fine as a better version of a Meghan song in my books.

**waluigiest** (8): u know the video of the woman dancing along to her younger self?

#Boy don't try to front, I I know this a bad so-o-ong

**enecks** (7): obnoxious//catchy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): 10 years ago a boy met Britney Spears in Starbucks. During their conversation the boy mentioned he wants to make a difference and change the world. Britney told him to follow his dreams and never give up. That young boy was Jesus.

**frogaranaman** (6): Some gay twink with no personality on Twitter: I know just who you are. 😏

**ryjomom** (4.5): men

**NapsAndNetflix** (3): i remember being so hype when this music video was on tv because of the sauna scenes

**xxrandooxx** (3): Britney Spears slaps… but not in this song :/

**gannade** (2): i always wondered what wouldve happened to this era if this just didnt exist

**tapdancingpig** (2): I really hate this song. The hook is decent, but the lyrics aren’t great, the chorus bores me, the bridge SUCKS, and Britney seems kind of checked out for most of it. The video’s good tho.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): This is Britney’s Worst Number one. And I know I’m alone here but I don’t care.

**Roxieloxie** (0): before you all destroy my inbox can i just say, I dont hate Britney, this song is just kinda basic, there was an effort but it dosent work for me

**ExtraEater**: With a few opening chords, I instantly feel like a teenage girl melodramatically staring out on the balcony on a midsummer evening. My favorite part of this song, aside from the heavenly chorus, is the twist in the typical Romeo and Juliet tale where it happens to have a happy ending instead of, y’know, suicide. When the song drives into that “Marry me” verse it’s like the gates of heaven have opened. I don’t know how many mediocre young adult novels I associated this song with when I was younger, but it’s clear to me that this love story adaptation outpeaked all of them.

**ImADudeDuh**: Taylor's first song that made me pay attention to her. I fucking loved this song and I loved the old time glamour of the video. The song itself felt like such a classic story, but it was told in a way that I loved back then, and it still stays with me today.

---
#Baby just say YES!

**imasalesman** (11): if she doesnt win this i s2g

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Wikipedia says Love Story is Taylor's first single to be critically acclaimed by reviewers, with a lot of scary quotes on the page calling it an instant country classic; it's one of not my favourite songs in her discography, but as time goes by I can see why it got the reception it did! Love Story represents the greatest ideal in a teenage mind of romantic love; it's optimistic, it's enchanting, and it hits all the right notes to make it a nostalgic hit. A lot of other book nerds I know are mad Taylor changed the ending to Romeo and Juliet here, but I enjoy the power of subversion in Taylor's lyrics; let the woman be happy, gosh darn it!

**1998tweety** (10): This is a 10 but I hope Hot N Cold outpeaks it again to see the Swifties melt.

**\_wailordfan** (10): Again, I constantly live for the key change, and I almost gave it my 11, but I don't feel like giving it 3 11s and not having it win any time, so You Belong With Me? It's your lucky day ho.

**ggodisawomann** (10): baby just say yes

**ManofOranges** (10): One of Taylor's best songs ever the key change gives me goosebumps every time I hear it

**MrSwearword** (10): still her best song, fucking fight me

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Say what you will about Taylor, but when she’s on she’s ON.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): Still my fave Taylor Swift song after all this time.

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song deserves the world.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): 🔑 change

**twat\_brained** (10): heard live count - #3. This is the third time we'll be rating this song in about 6 months, and in fact twice in as many months. Funnily enough, this will be our first time rating the song where I have no say in its inclusion. That doesn't mean it deserves anything less than a 10, however. It's probably my favorite song Taylor's ever released; it's just so adorable and sweet and wholesome.

**vapourlomo** (10): Easily Taylor's best song from her country era, and very accurate in that most teenagers don't understand that Romeo and Juliet aren't people to emulate.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.6): setup unrealistic expectations of dating that have stayed with me to this day

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): invented love stories

**ryjomom** (9.5): You know a country song is good when it crosses genres and becomes one of the most popular songs of the year

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): honest to god knock me out miss swift

**jamesfog** (9): Iconic crossover bop. She did that

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): fucking key change.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): COMING to lose its 3rd rate in 6 months

**frogaranaman** (8): Why the fuck does everyone love _Romeo and Juliette_? Is everyone really that suicidal? Shit, if you guys want to die, just become obsessed with _Macbeth_. God fucking damn, fake Shakespeare fans. At least that story is interesting.

**Tchalla1966** (8): wow I really didn’t like this song at the time but she did that!

**radiofan15** (7.9): I guess it kinda invented Shakespeare

**Mysario** (7.7): 🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴

**MashLuke** (7.5): corny but cute

**Plasm\_Trojan** (7.4): I can't believe Shakespeare ripped off taylor smh

**hikkaru** (7): how many times are we going to rate this??? this is the third time in the same few months that I'm being exposed as a fake swiftie for not really liking this song that much while all the other Taylor stans pile their 11s onto it

**pearllouise** (7): outsold Shakespeare

#"Did you know Romeo and Juliet meet and die together within 5 days?"

**Roxieloxie** (7): Check yes Juliet did it better

**waluigiest** (7): have never been a swift fan but this is nice! Kind of bland but pleasant

**enecks** (6): Badly written bop with a catchy chorus. This narrative is incoherent nonsense.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I was a huge country fan around this time and didn't like taylor AT ALL but in retrospect I can appreciate her old stuff a lot more. This one just got overplayed so much I still get kind of annoyed by it

**ReallyCreative** (6): I said this in the All Stars rate and I'll say it again here, Read Different Shakespeare Challenge, do that challenge, America

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6): i didn’t like this song when it came out, I still don’t, it just seems so so so so so basic.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Trite.

**selegend** (5): cute

**mich4725** (3.5): not terrible but a total cheese.

**kappyko** (3): ybwm >>>>>>>>>

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): It’s amazing that the songs she’s writing 10 years later are even more ‘I’m 15 years old’ than this

**xxrandooxx** (3): I liked Toy Story better

**bespectacIed** (2): I absolutely loathed this song's lyricism when it first come out and time didn't seem to change that I'm so sorry. This belongs at the nadir of Taylor's songwriting

**ExtraEater**: Well, I seriously didn't get this and I still don't, although I will try to stick to sounding as neutral as possible for this write-up: It sounds like viable runway music and the chorus explosion with lyrics alternating between dreams and nightmares definitely justifies this song's appeal and arresting qualities. Personally, there's surely better out there for pop like this, but I still enjoy it on a very remote scale.

**ImADudeDuh**: One of Beyonce's most overlooked singles by the GP also being one of r/popheads favorite? Big surprise! But, Sweet Dreams is great. Something about Beyonce just having the power to make the phrase "turn the lights on" feel powerful is just proof of her charisma. 

---
#Turnin' on the lights AND me!

**bespectacIed** (10): The most meh Sasha Fierce single but as a Bey stan I still feel obligated to give this a 10

**CarlieScion** (10): B O P

**enecks** (10): Hey, this is a classic in a very messy era. This would've gotten my 11 if I wasn't such a furry

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of Beyoncé’s most underrated. It’s such a bop!

**jamesfog** (10): Underrated Bey single. Period

**JunkyGS** (10): Her best pop song. All other opinions are wrong.

**ManofOranges** (10): I love this song so much literally a bop

**MrSwearword** (10): the best song from the Sasha Fierce era

**pearllouise** (10): Outsold insomnia

**Roxieloxie** (10): the best song titled sweet dreams dont @ me

**vapourlomo** (10): Beyonce's best song of the '00s.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.6): she kills me

**twat\_brained** (9.6): This sounds great, and it's even my favorite Beyoncé song out of all the songs I've heard from Sasha Fierce, but it feels like there's something that prevents it from being an outright 10 for me, I'm not certain what. What I am certain of, however, is how great Sweet Dreams is.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow another iconic bop, this really was her best era. I actually didn't know this song was Bey so I was pretty shook listening to it.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Is it possible to sleep on Beyonce? I don't know but I can already tell you this song will be rated too low.

**selegend** (9): finally a good beyonce song

**Tchalla1966** (9): TURN THE LIGHTS OFF!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Here’s one of the songs from Sasha Fierce that everybody unambiguously likes, and that’s a small handful I’m talking about. I’m not really a fan of what the production does to Beyoncé’s voice here and there, but this is still a great single compared to the rest of its parent record. After the horrors of Every Girl, it’s certainly an improvement. Wildest Dreams who? (This is a joke! Wildest Dreams is better than this song! Please don’t kill me!)

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): pretty forgettable for B tbh

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This is nice.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): my first bey album. Nostalgia

#Darling, I'm a nightmare, dressed like a nightmare

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Eurythmics honey...

**waluigiest** (7): sounds very nice but lyrics are so so basic

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.8): put me to bed queen bey

**radiofan15** (6.7): Love you Queen B but this era wasn't your brightest moment

**ggodisawomann** (5): honestly 2009 was a weak year in Yonce for me

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): tbh I also never liked this

**frogaranaman** (4): "Turn the lights off," Beyoncé commands of me. I go ahead and flip the switch then crawl into bed. She comes over and kisses me on the forehead. "Goodnight, mama B," I say. "Goodnight, frog," Beyoncé responds, closing the door.

**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): possibly beyonce's worst song, the bass is terrible and it's not even a good melody or anything

**ryjomom** (2): Beyoncé disappointed

**ExtraEater**: I found this song insufferably juvenile (as opposed to the usual "catchy juvenile") for the longest time–I recall a pophead from the old popheads days considering the chorus a form of literary genius when the amateur double meaning really only works in the sexual rather than narrative implication–but this chorus seriously sits among some of the catchiest from Britney's catalog. In an instant, I'm singing along to "Love me hate me, say what you want about me..." and I don't even care that I'm chanting an (intentionally poorly veiled) innuendo, if it even qualifies as one with how overt it is. Also, the mention of "all of the boys and all of the girls" makes for quite a bi anthem if you ask me.

**ImADudeDuh**: Tbh, I like working out to this song more than I like listening to this song in passing. I think it's just the BPM and how hard each beat is puntuated by the la's as well is how I normally do reps and stuff. I do feel like this song's attempt to sneak in F U C K Me in a song would've been clever if the actual "real lyric" made any sense. "All the boys and all the girls are begging to if you seek amy," doesn't make any sense! I do like the eerie feeling of the song though, I love dark pop songs.

#This song Bee Oh Pee Yes!

**GiftoftheGeek** (11): Shakespeare is *quaking*

**enecks** (10): this is an actual masterpiece, and people who dislike it are just scared of naughty words and bops

**jamesfog** (10): FUCK ME BITCH!

**MrSwearword** (10): underrated gold

**Mysario** (10): shout out to my childhood best friend Amy, she's punk af but even she knows this is a big tune

**pearllouise** (10): [Max Martin after he wrote this song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1Yuq20gGG0)

**radiofan15** (10): IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, DOES IT?

**tapdancingpig** (10): ~~Fuck me, Britney.~~

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.3): she really came for me with this one

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Heard live count - #12 I love the wordplay here, but thinking about it in-depth, "ha ha he he ha ha ho"? Max fucking Martin cowrote this, I expect better from him. If that were rectified this would be an easy 10

**ManofOranges** (9): What an iconic move Britney really just went out and said everybody want to fuck her

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song is barely clever but it's just clever enough that I'm in love with it, the cadence of "Amy" is actually pretty cool

**rslashpoopheads** (9): This song and MV bop.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9): It took me too long to get the title tbh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): If U Seek /u/frogaranaman

**1998tweety** (8.5): Queen of teaching us how to spell vulgar words.

**bespectacIed** (8): I think we're ALL blown away after we realized she spelled FUCK me

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The Circus era is at a messy place in my mind. In all actuality I think that it aged like milk with the title track being the one big exception, but despite how dated Britney’s comeback sounds to me now, I still have songs from the album I love because of how boppy they are. If U Seek Amy is a fun single from it that I happen to like. It’s not my favourite Britney song, but I enjoy imagining the horror of middle aged white moms watching their kids sounding out ‘eff you see kay me’ as they run across their backyard in front of all their relatives and neighbours. The song’s double meaning gets stupidly apparent if you’re an adult, because of how little sense the lyrics make otherwise, but this is much more fun to sing along to then the likes of, say, 3. Perhaps it’s a minor classic.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): I literally only learnt what this song meant from this sub in 2017

#This song Es You Seek A Yes!

**waluigiest** (7): gimmicky but still pretty good

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.2): fun but i dont understand what the lyrics are trying to say????

**frogaranaman** (6): Bonus points for having a unique rhythm, my classically trained ass is very into that.

**PuggleMaster** (6): Is till don't think this is clever

**xxrandooxx** (5.2): My cousins name is Amy

**NotWith10000Men** (5): clever

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i feel like i'm being sucked into a black hole when i listen to this song. not sure if that's a good thing

**vapourlomo** (4): One semi-clever lyrical joke doesn't make up for a mediocre song. Sorry, guys.

I wasn’t in high school when I first heard this, but this song and music video gave me my own elementary impression of just what in the world high school was like, filled with worrying about dates and the upcoming prom. The opening chords and that suburban opening shot in the music video both remind me of a time when I romanticized high school in my own odd ways.

**ImADudeDuh**: You Belong With Me, I'm really happy for you, Imma let you finish. But Love Story was the best single off of Fearless!

---
#We belong together

**\_wailordfan** (11): CAN'T YOU SEEEEEEEE YOU BELONG WITH MEEEEE please play the rep tour version of this pls and thank u.

**bigenemies** (11): This rate hits pretty close to home because in 2009 I was peak teenager. I’m giving You Belong With Me the 11 it truly captures that magic feeling of being young, awkward, hormonal and having fun - which is what 2009 was for me. I remember being so sick of all the EDM and club music of the time. Fearless wrote the stories that spoke to me the most.

**1998tweety** (10): I don't know why but I never connected with Love Story the way I did with this song. I love that it continues the storybook theme between Love Story and White Horse. I know that this song is the female version of a “nice guys” song, but I still like it. Its such a tune and I have fond memories to it.

**enecks** (10): This is the best early Taylor song. Clever framing, that fucking GOD-TIER prechorus, the chorus - this is phenomenal. This was maybe the first song that I learnt all the lyrics to just out of other people singing it - it was EVERYWHERE.

**frogaranaman** (10): On one hand, self-centered entitlement; on the other, complete and utter care for the well being of your best friend.

**ggodisawomann** (10): WOW I stayed up so late listening to this when it was released

**hikkaru** (10): the better Taylor smash in this rate

**ManofOranges** (10): People can call this song the female version of Treat You Better all they want that doesn't make it any less iconic like I know all of yall were out here head banging to this shit 10 years ago

**MashLuke** (10): mad cute

**MrSwearword** (10): sanction me or Crimea river, but this song is great

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Still her best song.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Better than Love Story

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): find me someone who doesn’t SCREAM this bridge and chorus when it comes on

**twat\_brained** (10): Well I attended the 1989 tour but didn't hear this live in my city. I did give it a 9.3 in the 2008 Rate, however, and I realize now that it deserves a 10. Forgive me, Swifties, I will not make the same mistake twice.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.2): i LIVE for that montage in front of the mirror

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Wow I love Treat You Better by Shawn Mendes.

**jval888** (9): still great

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I do love how general pop fans have started adoring this song again (after a period of, God forbid, regarding it as a slightly better, female version of Treat You Better) right as it approaches its ten year anniversary mark. For the longest time, this was Taylor's signature song, and it still is, in a way, although, thankfully, we have other, even better musical triumphs commonly associated with her name now. This is what Taylor may have meant by the phrase 'the old Taylor is dead' - as timeless is it is, its perspective is firmly in the realm of the past, both in the minds of the woman who wrote and sang it and in the minds of the people who once related to its lyrics listening to the song today. But that doesn't detract from You Belong With Me - the song is so acutely crafted in a way where all these traits make it nostalgic, not dated, and that miracle is what makes this smash single all the more powerful with age (the fact that the lyrics are recently being subject to queer reinterpretations from now grown gay fans is also a huge bonus, too). Controversies be damned; this was a big success for Taylor that started building her status as a bonafide legend.

**ryjomom** (9): /u/ryjomom is now an official member of /r/countryheads

**waluigiest** (9): now THIS is a timeless Taylor Swift banger. strong high school emotions

**radiofan15** (8.7): Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you and I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time

**jamesfog** (8.5): A bop of its time

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): this was the song that made me realise “huh, maybe this taylor is more than a one hit wonder”

**Plasm\_Trojan** (8.4): A lot of Taylor's old music feels a bit too silly / childish for me to enjoy, even if it doesn't sound bad, but this one actually sounds pretty good, and the lyrics are much better than most other songs from this era of her music.

**starla\_** (8): Not at the level of Love Story but still iconic

**tapdancingpig** (8): Yeah... this song is iffy as fuck, but I still think it’s catchy and cute.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4xlHYC1xmk

**Mysario** (7.7): 🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): kinda juvenile but still bops

#Slutty Taylor was hotter

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): taylor was never on the bleachers and we know it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I wish I liked this more than I do. :(

**Roxieloxie** (7): how old were you when you realized the mean girl in this vid was also taylor

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): It’s kind of annoying but iconic at the same time and I would like to point out again this is the female version of Treat You Better

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I really disliked taylor's pop/country blend in 2009 but looking at where mainstream country has gone now, this is a MASTERPIECE comparatively

**pearllouise** (6): I liked Taylor better when she was less white

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): I'm not like other girls, I love to LAUGH. A yawn and a half, pleasant song but kinda boring and don't love the concept.

**CopyCatJ** (5): incel music

**bespectacIed** (3): Corny video and corny song, Kanye made some points 10 years ago. p.s. This rate is gonna expose my hatred of country taylor :(( I realize I love Taylor with all my heart, but only after 2010

**selegend** (0): annoying

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): I think I realized while doing this rate that this might be one of my least favorite Taylor hooks, also that’s the guy from the Hannah Montana movie in the video and that’s weird

**ExtraEater**: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this for me is how I associate it with those classic Lady Gaga dick schoolyard rumors. Of all the Gaga singles this one definitely could've and should've left in Day 3. Regardless, the RedOne production and disco stick chorus is totally infectious, and I love how smoothly and nonchalantly delivers "you've indicated your interest, I'm educated in sex, yes." Play on.

**ImADudeDuh**: I don't care for this. This was back when people who said Gaga was all theatrics had some points. I didn't care about it from Just Dance cause that was a major bop, but this is not that much. Plus, her actual aesthetic that she had in the video was not even that good? The song itself is fine. I feel like this has Gaga trying too hard to act like a ~ seductress ~ and it doesn't work as well as she thinks. 

---
#LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLET'S PLAY!

**Awhile2** (10): im pretty sure gaga created some sort of sexual awakening for 90% of the kids in my generation and this song/music video were a huge part of that

**bespectacIed** (10): Ugh gaga was fucking RELENTLESS and UNPARALLELED in the fame era, wasn't she?? Doing this rate really reminded me of Gaga's peak power. Fucking disco stick, what kind of mind comes up with that???

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**enecks** (10): This is so nonsensical I love it

**gannade** (10): lets have fun this beat is sick, i wanna take a ride on your disco stick, /u/mudkip. yeah im a twink, what about it? Thank u, next.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): thrust dat dick daddy

**jamesfog** (10): Just Dance and Poker Face outshine this but classic pop bop yas

**ManofOranges** (10): My 8 year old ass would sing this song not knowing she's literally talking about a man's dick

**MrSwearword** (10): yaaaaaaaaaaaaaas Gaga

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): She really had 12 year old me singing about a “disco stick”, wow no surprise I’m gay.

**radiofan15** (10): Why does she wants to ride Edward Cullen's stick?

**ryjomom** (10): | D I S C O | S T I C K | (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ |

**Tchalla1966** (10): bring back the disco stick challenge

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #7 HUH This bopped when I was 10, it bops when I'm 20, it'll bop when I'm fucking 50. I want love AND fame! And I want this to go higher than #11 this time around. This rate is stacked so I'm not entirely expecting that to happen, but I hope I'm wrong.

**vapourlomo** (10): Earns a 10 for disco stick alone.

**wholesomebody** (10): my favorite gaga song

**mms82** (9.5): Best Gaga song pre-Joanne

**1998tweety** (9): I wanted to give Gaga all 10s but....this ain't it. Shame that it ended up higher than Paparazzi. With that said tho, this is still fun and has a nice beat.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): disco stick remains one of the most important phrases in pop culture

**ReallyCreative** (9): Slept on Gaga bop, she doesn't reinvent the wheel but we have to give respect to this darker sexy bop

**frogaranaman** (8): This era of Lady Gaga just reminds me of when I succumbed to capitalism at the age of eight and became a retail slave.

**MashLuke** (8): take a bite

**rslashpoopheads** (8): this gave me the gay

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): remember when the media lost its mind bc she wasn’t wearing pants in this video

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song is kind of generic compared to the other Fame singles, but it is, in fact, a bop.

**waluigiest** (8): disco stick scandalized us

**xxrandooxx** (7.2): High Score of 0 because I don't play no love games.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I used to rock out to this when I was thirteen and when I discovered just how much blatantly homosexual I was, but though the disco stick line remains as iconic as ever, I think the appeal of Lovegame has worn off me over the years. I don’t know if this is because of my music taste expanding, or the song losing its charm. Lovegame is fun, but unfortunately, it’s not much else.

**pearllouise** (7): "What the hell is a disco stick?"

#7.8/10: Too much discostick

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfVEaRxchPY

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6.5): the only iconic part of this song is disco stick

**NotWith10000Men** (6): not my fave of gaga's

**TragicKingdom1** (6): gaga's worst single probably

**hikkaru** (5): this song just sounds kinda awkward overall and I'm glad it's not remembered as one of gaga's biggest and best hits like her other songs in this rate are

**selegend** (4): dae lady gaga hermaphrodite freak xD haha xD 2009 was a great year for humor huh

**fishingfor8** (3): disco stick

**Plasm\_Trojan** (2): This was my first time listening to the song, and almost just turned it off after the disco stick line. It doesn't get much better from there. (Also, how was this made by the same person who made Just Dance just a bit earlier?)

**Roxieloxie** (1): this sounds like they chopped audio of her voice and tried to make this a song and it didn't work

**ExtraEater**: I hear that particular guitar tone a lot across pop, rock, indie, whatever and I always attribute it to a kind of weary and sober sound. So, the title and subject matter for this song is pretty fitting for the music, but y'know I've never felt the need to listen to this when the energetic and fun "So What" is right there. In addition, there's "Please Don't Leave Me" which is more affecting to me in terms of reflective and sober-sounding songs, let alone P!nk songs like that. I still enjoy this one, in particular it reminds me of times when I didn't even know what "sober" meant and I thought it had something to do with light-sabers. Nice tune.

**ImADudeDuh**: TBH, I thought this song was much older than 2009. I assumed it would be back in like 2004 or something. I just love this song. It shows how emotive P!nk is as a performer. She sings about how she's feeling good but she's confused by it and still worried about going back to the bad place. I just love her voice. What else I like? [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSNgbdTdb4w) that is basically just google image searching the lyrics to the song while stealing images from tumblr for the rest of the lyrics. It has such a 2011 vibe, yet was made in 2016 and I'm screaming a bit.

#Lorde, Demi, and Gambino are shaking!

**CopyCatJ** (10): I used to Stan pink in 2008

**frogaranaman** (10): I can't listen to this song while drunk because I get sad then cry the rest of the night.

**gannade** (10): whew an 11 contender

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Pink’s best song, fight me if you disagree.

**jamesfog** (10): Underrated classic

**ManofOranges** (10): Jaw? Dropped. Innebriation? Gone. Wig? Flew.

**MashLuke** (10): the vocals

**mms82** (10): ugh such an amazing song

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Pink’s best performance to date, there’s some genuine sorrow here and it hits me so hard.

**selegend** (10): feel like all my 10s mightve just been fron the 2008 rate

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this song snapped harder than thanos

**twat\_brained** (10): Like many of the songs in this rate, I'd first rated this in the 2008 rate, where this song to me at least was a reintroduction to Pink and her artistry. In fact, it made me realize that Sober is my favorite song of hers, and I'm hoping it ranks higher than So What this time

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): I enjoyed this song very much, the only thing that would make it better is if the chorus packed more of a punch with the guitar in the same vein as Try

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.6): this song cured my alcoholism and drug addiction

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): This song has no reason going quite as hard as it does. Probably the one serious Pink song I can get behind. It's a lowkey anthem, but without trying way too hard to be one *cough* RaiseYourGlass *cough*

**ryjomom** (9.3): sent my wig to rehab

**1998tweety** (9): /u/gannade has made some points

**enecks** (9): Emotionally honest. I miss good Pink.

**ggodisawomann** (9): Pink is a goddess

**MrSwearword** (9): lyrically I get its appeal but realistically, I'm never in a mood to listen to this for my musical pleasure

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Now, this is how you do an empowerment song! I haven’t listened to Funhouse in full, but this definitely stands out from the rest of that songs that smashed in that era as an anthem that’s conflicted yet motivational. The belts that Pink achieves throughout Sober (COMING DOWN, COMING DOWN, COMING DOWNNN) are flawless and amazing to listen to (SPINNING ROUND, SPINNING ROUND, SPINNING ROUND) and all in all it’s one of my favourite songs of hers due to the depth of emotions that she conveys simply because of how she handles its execution.

**PuggleMaster** (9): top 10?

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): The Pretty Reckless' Just Tonight with different lyrics so I guess you could say it's pretty good.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a v sadgery song

**Awhile2** (8): i remember my dad got mad at me for playing this music video on the tv in our family room

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I forgot how much I loved this song

**waluigiest** (8): I cry

#Lorde, Demi, and Gambino have never been more stable

**pearllouise** (7): Demi did it better

**radiofan15** (6.5): P!nk sweetie, you're amazing and everything... but this song is just a bunch of decent okeyness for me

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): – her vocals are great but the song bores me

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): it's no 'so what'

**ExtraEater**: Y'know, back during that dark period when I had an apathetic attitude towards pop and I was exclusively listening to /r/Music and /r/indieheads stuff, this was one of the few straight-up pop songs that I allowed in my vicinity. Now that I'm almost completely in the pop world, I've found so much better, but it makes sense that this commanding earworm of a chorus infiltrated me even when I was at my most pop-resistant. The fierce opening lyric of "There's only two types of people in the world: The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe" catches my attention and the rest of the song keeps it there. Again, there's better from the Ultimate 2008 Rate alone but I'll always cherish this chorus.

**ImADudeDuh**: When I was a kid, I only knew this song as the song that goes "there's only two kinds of people in this world." I'll be honest, I don't *love* this song, and I don't really know why. It feels like there's something off about it. But it's still  a pretty big bop. I love the slow build to the chorus and then the rapid fire delivery when the chorus actually hits. I feel like this is up there with Britney's most iconic songs and it deserves it.

---
#There's only 2 kinds of people in this world...

#...Ones that can handle this song

**1998tweety** (10): One of my fav Britney songs, this song is such a huge bop. And its pretty easy to sing to.

**gannade** (10): yeah im a twink, what about it? Thank u, next.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): THE VIDEO is so fucking iconic, this comeback was iconic, i genuinely love this so much and always have

**ignitethephoenix** (10): another rate, another time I give this a 10

**jamesfog** (10): Alleyesonmeinthecenteroftheringjustlikeacircuswhenicrackthatwhipeverybodygontripjustlikeacircusdontstandtherewatchinmefollowmeshowmewhatyoucandoeverybodyletgowecanmakeadancefloorjustlikeacircus

**MashLuke** (10): the production is super sick

**MrSwearword** (10): fabulousness all around, we love quality Britney singles

**Mysario** (10): if only an actual circus was entertaining as this song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this and womanizer was my intro to britney

**pearllouise** (10): outsold The Greatest Showman

**radiofan15** (10): There's only two types of people in the world: The ones that worship Britney Spears and the ones that are delusional and must be fans of awful untalented hacks like Allie X, Janet Jackson, Ava Max and Bleachers

**ReallyCreative** (10): Shoutouts to the All-Star rate for robbing this song blind

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #5 You're not killing this song. No matter what, we will rate Circus, and you're gonna keep listening to it. Just wait until Circus vs Hard Candy vs Aphrodite, when Kylie will evidently dominate but you'll still have to listen to this. Even when Britney doesn't win, Britney always wins, by way of you streaming her music.

**ryjomom** (9.5): I’d have Britney hit me with a tight whip… so beware

**ManofOranges** (9): Ringling Brothers who????

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Britney really did her thing here.

**waluigiest** (9): the DRAMA

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.9): look at britney bringing us music as god intended it

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): My feelings towards Circus as an entire era have grown a little harsher over the years, but the title track is still a favourite of mine. It does a much cleaner job than the rest of its namesake record, and it’s also one of the only songs from the same album where Britney doesn’t sound like a robot. (One exemption that belongs to that category is My Baby, and we all know how that went.) If it weren’t for Man On The Moon, I’d call this the peak of Britney’s post-Blackout work.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): brb slutdropping to this

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): very slut very bop

**bespectacIed** (8): Britney ended racial divide with the first line of this song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): When Britney split the world into two kinds of ppl

**tapdancingpig** (7.7): This is solidly one of the ~~few~~ good songs on Circus.

**xxrandooxx** (7.5): Still better than an actual circus with torchered animals and drunken clowns with hepatitis

**enecks** (7): This is some good britny

**frogaranaman** (7): This song single-handedly convinced theater gays that they are better than everyone else.

**ggodisawomann** (7): a solid pop sensation Britney Britney song

**ExtraEater**: Halo opens as if revealing the gates of Heaven, which open to a marble stage with a piano and Beyonce singing “Halo”. A power ballad that accomplishes all of the most necessary checkboxes: Big thumping percussion, grand storytelling and imagery, and melodies that ring like an anthem. Angels are singing.

**ImADudeDuh**: One of Beyonce's best ballads, Halo is, what most people would call, a bop. And OKAY let's get this out of the away, it's better than Already Gone. Beyonce is just a good vocalist and here she shows it off. The song itself may not have super duper deep or complex lyrics, but it's a beyonce song so who cares.

---
#Heavenly

**jval888** (11): timeless

**xxrandooxx** (11): :,)

**1998tweety** (10): One of her bests, my most vivid memory of the song was at the last school dance of the year when I was in grade 8. One of my friends in grade 7 had a crush on a girl in my grade, so me and a bunch of others set them up and got them to dance to 1 song together, which was this. She ended up not liking him back but was nice enough to slow dance with him to one song. Looking back it seems super cringy, but it was cute at the time.

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the most iconic ballads of all time!!!

**gannade** (10): i dont care how white this is it bops

**jamesfog** (10): Her best song :sorry:

**ManofOranges** (10): One of my favorite Beyonce songs of all time. Side note but for some reason I remember this song playing of the intercom of my school when I was in 2nd grade and I'm not entirely sure if that actually happened but I think it did and if so, my school had taste

**MrSwearword** (10): among her best songs that gets shat on for no reason [especially from a fandom that thinks Sorry and XO are good songs. HAVE A SEAT]

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is how a ballad is done. And it sounds absolutely beautiful.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): ladygagacompliments.gif

**PuggleMaster** (10): Her best ballad dajf;kaldfjk

**radiofan15** (10): Outsold Kelly Clarkson

**ReallyCreative** (10): I feel like this song is gonna get robbed for some inexplicable reason

**Roxieloxie** (10): a classic

**ryjomom** (10): Literally the Holy Spirit

**tapdancingpig** (10): Probably my favorite early Beyoncé song. I say that about all of them, but I think it’s true this time.

**waluigiest** (10): I want this to play at my funeral

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): one of my absolute favourite bey songs, idc, probably because i'm a walled off bitch!

**mich4725** (9): this aged well

**Mysario** (9): I'd give it a 10 if it was mashed up with "Walking on Sunshine"

**strawberryswing1** (9): overused

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Kind of the opposite of Single Ladies in that it’s the opposite of minimalist, with a big soaring chorus and epic synth lines. While I like minimalism in music, sometimes just going all out is just better because this song is huge and wonderful.

**twat\_brained** (9): As great as Bey sounds here there's something that feels like it's missing for it to be an outright 10

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.9): now this is the beyonce we all know and love

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): ok but beyonce’s performance can never beat that one fan’s performance.

**frogaranaman** (8): Video game.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Well, this is the last comment I have to type out this rate, and aside from a cheap few Already Gone jokes and me casually mentioning that this used to be played in every restaurant I went to, I have no idea what to say about it. It’s the most tolerable single off Sasha Fierce, I suppose? I have nothing more to tell you except that, haha, I’m done writing comments now. Goodbye.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbonVshOLf0

**TragicKingdom1** (8): probably beyonce's best vocal performance

#Gays don't go to heaven, so Beyonce must be homophobic. In this essay, I will

**enecks** (7): A little overstuffed in the production, but this is a damn good ballad.

**izeasklapaucius** (7): overproduced but catchy.

**pearllouise** (7): Challenge: tell the difference between this song and Already Gone. I bet you'll lose.

**vapourlomo** (7): Beyonce in ballad mode isn't my favorite, but this is a staple for a reason. Still kind of weird that this is Mark Zuckerberg's favorite Bey song...

**selegend** (5): white peoples’ favorite beyonce song

**Plasm\_Trojan** (4.3): So this is an EXTREMELY unpopular opinion since this song will undoubtedly make the top 10 but I find this song really boring.

**ggodisawomann** (3): another of my least favorite hit Yonce songs

**hikkaru** (3): zzzzzzz

**ExtraEater**: Did it really change the view of mashups in the public consciousness? Based on the few word of mouth sources I have, it certainly did. DJ Earworm's mashup for 2009's Top 25 was a viral sensation that has stronger ties to this rate and the spirit of 2009 than some of its own songs. The mashup is centered around I Gotta Feeling's beat and arguably Down due to the lyrical theme, which in my humble opinion are literally the two best songs in the Top 25 by FAR, bar NONE (this is coming from someone who literally loves almost every song in the Top 25). Already, it's born to not just be iconic but also be the total and complete spirit of a good time (in 2009, which according to the transitive property means a good time in general). It incorporates some songs in ways that are both irresistibly catchy and endlessly clever/serendipitous: There's the song's strength of narrative (stronger than some of his other mashups), the "Down" repetition, the Miley/Bey duo, among many others, especially the song's shining moment in which it briefly pairs Black Eyed Peas and Beyonce: "I gotta feeling (But I never really had a doubt) That tonight’s gonna be a good night." I think DJ Earworm understood "I Gotta Feeling" better than anyone ever did, even the Black Eyed Peas themselves. His best mashup, for sure, and an absolute cornerstone of the genre.

**ImADudeDuh**: Fucking iconic. Oh my god. This is just amazing. I remember I came across this video cause some person stole the video and reuploaded it as "HIT SONGS OF 2009" and I saw it and I was so confused how all these songs were able to be put together and into a song that kinda makes sense. This was quite literally the first mashup I've ever seen and it really hooked me onto that forever. Lowkey, mashups were a way for me to shamelessly enjoy pop music before I was fine with myself being a pop fan. It just really means a lot to me, and I would legitimately give this my 11 if this weren't a bonus rate song.

---
#He's called Earworm for a reason!

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**Awhile2** (10): goddamn i feel bad for dj earworm because no matter what he releases people wont stop bitching that its not half as good as this modern masterpiece

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): If I was allowed to, this would be my 11

**enecks** (10): duh

**ggodisawomann** (10): blame it on the DANCE

**izeasklapaucius** (10): DJ Earworm introduced me to pop music thanks to this mix. Love you man.

**jamesfog** (10): Fucking iconic.

**jval888** (10): the best one

**ManofOranges** (10): In my opinion this is DJ Earworm's best year-end remix of all time. Some years have been good but I don't think any have come close to the perfection that is 2009. Maybe it's cause the songs are all so similar that they fit together very well, but there's no doubt that it's also because this year truly served some bops. This remix is truly lightning in a bottle, the creme de la creme, the remix to end all remixes.

**MashLuke** (10): changed my life forever

**MrSwearword** (10): Mashups literally came into people's consciousness because of this masterpiece. His first major triumph and his best mashup.

**Mysario** (10): some of my friends would be able to recite and dance to this song almost perfectly years ago and that always impressed me since I can barely remember the second verse to any song

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is a masterpiece, but the 2010 one is his best and I will fight you on that.

**pearllouise** (10): 2018 DJ Earworm? I don't know her.

**PuggleMaster** (10): this would be my 11 hands down if this was in the rate

**radiofan15** (10): DAMN I feel older than Madonna's frozen fetuses listening to this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Legendary.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): this song is easily the best DJ Earworm Remix, part of that is probably because of the overall unified sounds of the year, but also because it feels like there’s genuine passion behind it. The lyrics actually have a message, everything blends into each other nicely, it’s just great, and it’s a great flashback to 2009 when I need it.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): better than half the songs in this list

**Tchalla1966** (10): nostalgia really hit me listening to this.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the best song ever created

**waluigiest** (10): this is masterful. It slaps. The “lyrics” actually form a mostly cohesive song. Points out trends in the year’s music while also celebrating its diversity. Follows patterns while growing and getting deeper. Plus the iconic moment of sticking in the “I found god” as Fergie’s woohoo fades out.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this is the only mashup worth listening to except for the ones made by /u/MashLuke

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.6): honestly? there's been better. sue me.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (7.6): It's probably due to the fect that a majority of the top 25 was excellent, but this remix is pretty good.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I mean, for what it is, it's actually pretty solid, but we need less Fergie, less Fergie, less Fergie, less Fergie, and more of... well most everyone else. Also Taylor got absolutely left out to DRY with the tunings of her parts lmao

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): Good use of even bad songs.

#WE FUCKING WANT POP DANTHOLOGY BACK!

**NotWith10000Men** (6): fun but I really really REALLY wish they hadn't used the peas beat bc that's all I could hear and I hate that song

**CreepyMannequin** (5): I like the 2010 one better.

**hikkaru** (5): I've always found these mashups to be disjointed and not fun to listen to :shrug:

**selegend** (5): don’t care much for him anymore

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): isosine outsold.

**mich4725** (4.5): a

**xxrandooxx** (4): definitely have heard better mashups.

**ariannagrandtitties** (3): this gave me a headache

**ryjomom** (2): I don’t like group projects

**frogaranaman** (1): Blegh.

**ExtraEater**: Yes, you could point out any of the Teenage Dream singles, but I think "Waking Up in Vegas" by far provides the sharpest contrast between old rising pop star Katy and new veteran artist Katy. "Waking Up in Vegas" captures that feeling of a pop star entering fame and having nothing but total fun on their first trips to glamorous fame hotbeds like Hollywood, New York, or Las Vegas. Katy's affinity for fun in the gorgeous and deserved-to-win-Videography-rate-instead music video is unparalleled to even "Teenage Dream" and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)". The walls of guitars and glamour compounded by this haze of newfound glory don't compare to anything else Katy has done, and that alone makes this one of her best. Dare I say it’s even miles ahead of Hot n Cold.

**ImADudeDuh**: Tbh, this might be my favorite song that I discovered through a rate on r/popheads. I learned of this from the Videography Rate with Rihanna vs Gaga vs Katy. I hadn't heard this song and I loved the video so much, I considered making it my 11 (it ended up being California Girls). But the song itself never left me. I just love all the little things in it. I love the intro with the slot machine, I love the little inflections Katy puts on little lyrics that give this song the personality it needs. I could hear Katy going "last niyiyiyight" so many times and get swept up in it. Ugh, this song just reminds me why I loved Katy's earlier work.

---
#Jackpot

**ggodisawomann** (11): this is my favorite Katy song and also my favorite song in this rate

**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow another 10. The lyrics aren't super complicated on this song; I think Katy is describing a relationship where you both take risks and it either pays off huge in the end or you lose big time. Again, I really love Katy's loud vocals on this song, It bops hard.

**bespectacIed** (10): ONE OF HER BEST SONGS. What I love about the One of the Boys era is that every single has a narrative ... and this was the best executed one.

**frogaranaman** (10): God, college is so fun.

**hikkaru** (10): BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of Katy’s best!

**jamesfog** (10): Classic.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I miss rock Katy so much. ~~Also I can’t believe Demi ripped her off here.~~

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): A pop rock classic straight from 2008, and almost certainly one of my favourite songs from Katy, if not hands-down my favourite. Katy’s exercise in lyrical songwriting is actually good here, featuring a memorable and nostalgic yet bitter retelling of events, and the entire way Waking Up In Vegas sounds in general just brings you to a wild mental trip that should prove at the very least that as flawed as it is, Katy’s songwriting isn’t all that bad.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I'm not gonna give this my 11 but if it wins that'll be so ICONIC

**radiofan15** (10): The guys from The Hangover should have listened to this song and maybe they wouldn't have been in as many troubles as the ones they got on the movie

**selegend** (10): i feel like we mightve rated half the songs from this list

**skargardin** (10): total fucking bop

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): this song is still so ridiculously good i miss this katy :(

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): big big big big big big bop

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #8 GET ME SOME CASH OUT BAYBAAAAY This video was everything and honest to God I just miss everything about 2009; I should've seen Katy Perry the first time round when I had the chance

**ryjomom** (9.5): Love the Concept, Plan, Execution, and Evaluation.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): deserved to win videography rate

**enecks** (9): Forget Lukwarm and Cool, this is the real classic of One of the boys

**ManofOranges** (9): another iconic Katy song

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Katy has never needed Max and Luke to create catchy bops. This song is her and Greg Wells co-writing and co-producing, and it is fucking delightful.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): This song does its job because I really wanna go on a trip to Vegas now, Katy really makes a case for it huh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The Hangover trilogy is truly shaking

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): I don't really get the point of this song, nor do I really love the sound personally, but it's a cool direction for Katy and makes me think she could have been the lead singer of a indie/rock band to some success.

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.5): shaking the glitter off

**mich4725** (7.5): not a track for ages but for a season for sure

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I love a good pop rock song

#Casinos are rigged af

**poppinmmolly** (7): I don't like this song nearly as much as everyone else does.

**vapourlomo** (7): Not a classic, yet somehow still better than just about every single from Prism.

**waluigiest** (7): it turns kinda plain after the first verse

**pearllouise** (6.5): DONT BE A BAYBEY

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I legitimately forgot that this song existed to the point where I didn't even recognize it at first.

**jval888** (5): forgettable

**MrSwearword** (4): what she got for Waking Up in Vegas was Witness, some years later

**ImADudeDuh** (11): This might seem like a weird choice for an 11, but I have my reasons. Firstly, I made an [anniversary post](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/96ds2r/so_what_by_pnk_was_released_10_years_ago_today_on/) for this song months ago, where I explained my love for this song already. P!nk does something that's underrated af, which is sell sadness and anger and independence all at once. I could easily see someone doing a sad acoustic cover of this song and it actually working a bit! I love the pop rock feel of the production that just lets loose, but still knows when to keep itself contained, like on the bridge. God damn, I want P!nk to bring this edge back to her new music! Don't give me mom pop anymore, give me angry aunt pop!

**ExtraEater**: When people think “trashy dumb pop”, they likely think of stuff in the vein of grating vapid dance songs like “Sexy and I Know It”. So What is honestly so trashy and so dumb, and in the most beautfully “badass wine mom” kind of way, too. That guitar riff is powerful enough to ring through the ages, and really Pink’s vocals sell the rebellious lyrics too well that I can’t just undermine it by calling it a mom rock anthem. P!nk? More like Punk amirite hahaha.

#She's still a ^^^^pop ROCK STAR

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this is such a bop, I remember hearing this all the time when I was younger and getting pumped up.

**Awhile2** (10): I would constantly play this music video and the Disturbia music video on On Demand all the time

**enecks** (10): Who among us have had sports rallying cheers for school interpolate this?

**frogaranaman** (10): Okay, this explains why soccer moms are obsessed with her.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I'M STILL A ROCKSTAR

**ManofOranges** (10): This is THE song for when you wanna do whatever you want just try and tell me otherwise

**MashLuke** (10): peak Pink

**mms82** (10): who wouldve though P!nk is still a rockstar!

**MrSwearword** (10): one of her best songs [also, a song you're surprised nabbed her a #1? Thank U (Next) who?]

**Mysario** (10): I know I make dumb comments most of the time, but I wish I had anything important to say about Pink besides that I love her songs

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**NotWith10000Men** (10): needs no explanation

**pearllouise** (10): My hoe anthem

**Plasm\_Trojan** (10): Almost wanted to give this my 11

**poppinmmolly** (10): her BEST SONG

**radiofan15** (10): Acrobatic queen SNAPPED

**skargardin** (10): A strong 11 contender. Absolute banger.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): normal person: into you is max martin’s greatest work - smart person: oops i did it again is max martin’s greatest work - galaxy brain: so what is max martin’s greatest work

**vapourlomo** (10): Pink's all-time best song. Snotty, pissed, and with a always-timeless Jessica Simpson name drop.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.8): eternal mood

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): one of the first songs ever on my red ipod shuffle!

**xxrandooxx** (9.2): I used to hate this song...

**jamesfog** (9): Classic, tho she has better

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Still an anthem.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9): What a great “fuck off“ anthem

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): do you know how many times this played on AUS radio

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): A lot of Pink’s most recent singles haven’t done much for me, but this one is still awesome. It’s got a lot of the “fuck you” attitude Pink had at her peak, and the hook is instantly memorable.

**waluigiest** (9): we’re all gonna get in a fight! Great bridge

**twat\_brained** (8.6): NANANANANANANA I WANNA START A FIGHT WITH PEOPLE WHO HATE THIS SONG! Maturity is overrated in music nowadays, we need more songs like these where artists just act like overgrown children; it's vastly underrepresented.

**Tchalla1966** (8.5): SO SO WHAT THIS IS A ANTHEM

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.2): this, however, is 'so what' !!!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Yes, So What’s immaturity is a little annoying at times coming from a fully grown woman, but it’s still a song that I have fond memories of, even if I no longer hold it in as high regard that I used to when I was a kid fawning every time Pink swore in its lyrics. Even if you bear more ill will towards it than I do, its still undeniable that So What’s melody is unbelievably catchy! Tie it in from there and you get a single that’s amazing to know all the words to, even if it might not be the best. There are songs from this era of Pink that are way better, though.

#Well I've been popping pillies and I feel like a rockstar too

**mich4725** (7): Very very catchy, but easily gets quite annoying after being played too many times, so you either love it or hate it. Good song nonetheless.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I still can’t give this song my full endorsement, it kind of sounds like she’s trying way too hard.

**ryjomom** (6.5): no fucks given

**ReallyCreative** (6): Fun chorus but otherwise this song has big problems. I wonder who Pink killed though because this song would not leave the radio where I lived until the better part of 2011. That line is also one of her worst, and that's saying something.

**ExtraEater**: Pop rock from the late 2000s/early 10s kinda had this airy, sweet, ‘happily driving in a convertible and taking in the breeze’ attitude to it. This Kelly song just lifts me back up with its energy and resolute goal to make it clear how much the singer’s life would suck without unnamed male protagonist. This song’s title alone oozes kitsch, and I just have to adore how dedicated it sounds in the face of it all.

**ImADudeDuh**: One of Kelly's best songs, this is basically the AU to Since U Been Gone where she actually does like the guy. When Kelly goes "Cause we beloooooooong togeeeeeeether nooooooooowww yeah," her voice is so great. I just love Kelly's voice so much. Plus, this is the song that holds the record for the biggest billboard jump in one week, she did THAT!

#Give me the succ

**ariannagrandtitties** (11): my life would suck without kelly clarkson

**mateytatey** (11): !!!

**1998tweety** (10): Kelly QUEEN of making power emotional bops

**\_wailordfan** (10): Kelly was so robbed in her rate.

**CarlieScion** (10): almost as good as the glee cover :janet:

**gannade** (10): dr luke can choke but kellegend

**ggodisawomann** (10): KELLY SIS

**hikkaru** (10): the whole story behind this with her label forcing her to work with Dr. Luke is really awful but like... it SLAPS

**jamesfog** (10): ICONIC record breaking smash hit which jumped from #97-1 on the charts. Your faves could never.

**MashLuke** (10): massive

**MrSwearword** (10): because duh this song slays

**Mysario** (10): why was this mid-season Glee finale song better than the show's finale

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A genuinely great pop song. Kelly Clarkson queen of music.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I’ve always knew that Kelly was a vocal legend before this, but, sheesh, this is basically just a brazen display of how high she can go that I can’t help but be amazed by it. My Life Would Suck Without You is miles above her other songs in this rate, and the power exhibited on its chorus is just stunning. The best song by a woman in this rate.

**radiofan15** (10): As much as I love this song in particular I have to say that the Glee version outsold her

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Don't @ me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): My Life Would Suck Without This Song

**twat\_brained** (10): If there's one Kelly song that can hold a dime to Since U Been Gone it's this one

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Kelly's best chorus of her career

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): Ms. Clarkson is very slept on and I lowkey forgot this song existed but I'm thankful for this rate reuniting me with it, I will say the lyrics could use a little work in places, but that's a standard criticism for many Kelly songs

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): great song, terrible title

**ManofOranges** (9): Kelly somehow just knows how to deliver high octane pop rock hits in a way that few can

**pearllouise** (9): Written by the same woman who wrote "open sesame" and

**ryjomom** (9): cute

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): Kelly Clarkson deserved more these past two years

**Tchalla1966** (9): what a hype song, when that first chorus hits

**waluigiest** (9): this doesn’t get old

**wholesomebody** (9): monster hook

**kappyko** (8.5): this is actually baroque even if it's just since 2 been gone

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): This might actually be my favorite Kelly single, it’s like Since U Been Gone but with an even better hook

**fishingfor8** (8): wow remember when kelly clarkson didn't suck

**Roxieloxie** (8): it's cute but it's no Behind these Hazel eyes

**tapdancingpig** (8): Kelly’s voice could probably knock me off the face of the earth, and I would love every moment of it.

**xxrandooxx** (7.8): Something high energy yes please

#Might not suck, but this song blows

**mich4725** (7.5): good for what it is for sure

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): probably the weakest lead single from kelly, but still a bop. this song does hold some reverance with me because it was #1 the week i discovered the billboard charts!

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I miss angry kelly but this kelly is good too

**frogaranaman** (6): I thought this song was about dogs.

**izeasklapaucius** (6): would've been better if it wasn't so overproduced af.

**enecks** (5): mmm sellout

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): i do not remember this song at all???

**ExtraEater**: It's time to rate this for the third time in the past few months! For the record, I love this song but the way it easily infiltrated the Top 10 for this rate is pretty bizarre to me when we've got a lot of other great candidates (most of which went out in Day 3 for some reason) that deserve the slot more. Regardless, I love this song's sense of grandeur and how it led to the equally worthy "Fallen Kingdom" cover afterward. An entry alternative classic, and I have HAD it with detractors of this song (not in this rate, exactly) who just exist to say it sounds like U2 worship or is inherently uncool without any further explanation (all other detractors are fine, of course).

**ImADudeDuh**: I loved this song so much, it was my alarm in middle school. I used it everyday so much that my mom said she got tired of hearing it on the radio cause it always woke her up. BUT, last year I was randomly watching some random morning news show and they did a segment on the best songs to use as morning alarms and Viva La Vida was number one, so who really won in the end MOM?

#Viva la Revolucion!

**Tchalla1966** (11): THIS IS ACTUALLY NEAR PERFECTION HOLY DAMN I MISS THIS COLDPLAY.

**vapourlomo** (11): I feel kind of lame giving my 11 to a song that technically came out in 2008, but Viva La Vida is a truly timeless song that encapsulates Coldplay's best era in four minutes. The soaring chorus, the orchestral backing...you do better than this.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic, masterpiece.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): not really a Coldplay fan, but this is a great song

**CopyCatJ** (10): Minecraft parody slaps

**enecks** (10): Wow, this is an actual masterpiece.

**fishingfor8** (10): this appearing on the 2009 year end must be like Shape Of You being on the 2018 year end huh

**frogaranaman** (10): Anybody else remember the CaptainSparklez parody? That was a moment in time.

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song ruled the world

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): fun story, my dad loves this song and i didn't even know he knew it existed (also shout out my babe u/strawberryswing1, the coldplay stan that has made my life infinitely better, ily strawbs)

**hikkaru** (10): Two months, two rates, two tens

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Copying my review from the last time I rated this song: One of my favourite Coldplay songs. I love the story telling and perspective of this song; it’s really unique.The production and instrumentals is fantastic too with all the strings, chimes and choirs, and this has allowed the song not to age a day at all. It’s one of the few songs that I loved the first time I heard it, and I still listen to a lot even to this day.

**jamesfog** (10): Timeless classic.

**ManofOranges** (10): I will never not give this song a 10 and I will never forget the one Minecraft parody of this song that I listened to on repeat for like a week

**MashLuke** (10): amazing record

**Mysario** (10): I was in high school choir when this song dropped and our chorus teacher wanted us to cover this and it had potential to be good... but just like 'thank u next', it was not as good as anybody wanted it to be. Ruined the song for me but I also still love it as well as the whole album 🍓🐰🍓

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Coldplay’s Best Song. That’s it.

**nightjesus** (10): beautiful song ugh I made a Danny Phantom fan vid to this song and it got copyright truck lol

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I can’t believe I’m saying this about a Coldplay song, but I’m actually pretty sure this is the best song in the entire rate. European history? Sign me the heck up! String melodies coupled with religious references? That just makes me even more convinced that Viva La Vida is a perfect song for a nerd like me. And even if I’d have been hard-pressed to admit this until recently, Chris Martin’s voice just makes the song all the more special. Viva La Vida is a magical masterpiece, and while I’m not giving it my 11 for, uh, strategic reasons (yes, I’m a snake) I just have to call it one of my favourite songs of all time.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (10): Undoubtedly Coldplay's best song. I would argue it's aged the best out of any song here.

**PuggleMaster** (10): this rate has too many songs i could give my 11 to, holy shit

**radiofan15** (10): One of the most interesting songs to top the Hot 100, I really miss this Coldplay

**starla\_** (10): Coldplays best album imo

**strawberryswing1** (10): I love Coldplay

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): yeah i listen to concept albums *puts on viva la vida or death and all his friends barnes & noble exclusive colored vinyl on his crosley player while sipping strawberry soylent*

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Not my favorite song on Viva La Vida (Violet Hill and Lovers in Japan) but still a really unique and beautiful pop song.  God that string section is gorgeous!!

**twat\_brained** (10): It's my third time rating this song, and it's better with every new listen. I like to tease my friend about liking Coldplay, but their music is better than I give them credit for; I ought to check out their albums. Moreover, I expect at least another top 10 placing for this song.

**xxrandooxx** (10): Not only is this song good, but it sounds different than all the other pop/hip hop songs during this era.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.2): redeems 2009

**pearllouise** (9): [I dig Coldplay when they don't try to hard to be ghetto.] (https://youtu.be/SDPITj1wlkg?t=242)

**ryjomom** (9): How many rates is this song going to be in?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): they didn’t have to go this hard for this song but they did

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): It's definitely one of Coldplay's better songs but it's not one of the best

**Roxieloxie** (8): u/strawberryswing1

**waluigiest** (8): i’m not white so I’m allowed to say this slaps more than expected

#CaptainSparklez - Fallen Kingdom massively outpeaked

**tapdancingpig** (3): I’m sorry, I just can’t deal with this song anymore. I’ve had to perform it in too many shitty choirs, and it’s been on the radio so much, just taunting me.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): a big shrinker. like a penis in a bathtub after an hour

**mms82** (2): ugh this song is so boring and relentlessy overplayed

**NotWith10000Men** (2): one of the most overrated songs of all time

**MrSwearword** (1): absolutely terrible

**ExtraEater**: A good time captured like lightning in a bottle. This is like the shorter, more explosive, and immediately optimistic version of those YA coming-of-age novels where a suburbanite enters the big city. One thing I love about this song is how it discusses Hollywood yet it's less about their celebrity aspirations/achievements (the "With a dream" bit is the most we get of that) and more about their personal experience trying to adjust to this glamorous new life. Miley's reservations and yearning for home is an essential part of the song (The homesickness, the gorgeous "hoppin' on a flight" bridge), but through this adventure we get to watch her get used to this unfamiliar place so she can just have *fun*. A party in the USA, for sure (I could talk about how Miley's hometown was literally in the USA and this is hardly different, but I'm no nitpicker).

**ImADudeDuh**: Remember 10 years ago when Miley fucking ENDED Osama Bin Laden? We stan a patriotic queen. This song made me LOVE America, and with Obama as president, why wouldn't I love America? I heard somewhere that some people use this song to see what good production and layering really sounds like? I have no idea if that's true or what, but I can believe it. Also this was written by /u/sapphire1921 's queen, Jessica Jay. We stan!

#Thank you Jessie, very cool!

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic bop, a Disney channel BOP, one of her bests.

**ariannagrandtitties** (10): timeless

**Awhile2** (10): i used to hate this song idk what was wrong with me

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfG94k41MrI

**enecks** (10): I wanted to be a cool kid and give it a low score but this is perfection in glossy pop nonsense.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): me giving this a ten the same day i find out that i'm fucked by the us government yet again >

**hikkaru** (10): FUCK I LOVE THIS FUCKING SONG ICONIC

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented the USA. We stan a founding father!

**izeasklapaucius** (10): this is the only good thing that came out from Jessie J. jk jk luv u babe.

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember the first time I heard this song I heard the Jay Z lyric and I had no idea who Jay Z was sdjksfjs those were simpler times

**Mysario** (10): I solely went to LAX just so I could take a Snapchat there and make this my caption

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is a perfect pop song. There isn’t a single flaw to be found here.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): does this need an explanation?

**pearllouise** (10): If you never stanned Disney Channel, you have never been a true gay

**ReallyCreative** (10): Everything about this song is perfect, in theory it should sound trite and stupid but it doesn't, it accomplishes everything it should and is one of the most fun songs to come out of the 2000s.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): YEAHEAHEAHEAHEHAHEAEHAHEHAHAEEHAEHHAHEHAEHAHEHAEHAHEH

**selegend** (10): also deserves a second win

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): Would’ve given it my 11 but I already won with this song in the Disney Rate when I was the only one to give it an 11 (yes it’s an achievement)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://i.imgflip.com/2tf9jw.jpg

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #6 lol remember the bloodbath that was the Disney/Nick Rate and somehow this managed to dodge the most hate and come out as the unlikely winner? That was brilliant. And this holds up. It shouldn't, but it does. I don't care if it was #31 in the winner's rate, it's still a rate winner and it is pure pop excellence from Miley here. I guess I should also thank Jessie J and MADEINCHINA too. Way better than that Christian pandering garbage her name is tacked onto in this rate

**waluigiest** (10): she sang this fuckin bop and hadn’t even heard a Jay-Z song. Like…. The fact that I think of this song every time I ride a plane or wear a cardigan speaks to its permanence. It’s about finding unity and commonality in an unfamiliar world and I love that.

**wholesomebody** (10): iconic

**radiofan15** (9.7): This song kept Jessie J fed for years so we must appreciate it... oh, and also it became an anthem for American patriotism after Bin Laden died so we must stan

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9.5): Woooooooooooo

**MashLuke** (9): fun song

**ryjomom** (9): If you can’t bop to this you aren’t American

**ggodisawomann** (8): a staple at parties

**mich4725** (8): very decent summer pop track. She reminds me a bit of Ke$ha in this song.

**PuggleMaster** (8): I swear if you f*gs let this win again...

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): My hot steaming take is that Jessie J should have kept this song (hello, Sapphire). Don’t get me wrong, it’s an iconic moment in Miley’s career, and I’m not exactly mad over Disney handing the song over to her, but if you ignore the Nashville line, literally everything else about Party in the U.S.A doesn’t make sense as a song sung by an American. Jessie J’s belts would probably be better suited to it, too. Miley still does a good job on this, though. A slight bop! My favourite fun fact about this song is that spiked in views when Osama Bin Laden died. Yeah, I know.

**frogaranaman** (7): Straight white boys at private schools go NUTS for this song at dances and I have the life experience to back this up.

#We still have Trump for President so...

**MrSwearword** (7): I don't hate it as much as I used to but is still not worthy of any marks higher

**Roxieloxie** (7): I made a comment the last time i rated this song that, i've never heard a britney song on the radio. and doing this rate, i see what miley meant

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): miley's worst vocal performance but i have softened on this over time

**xxrandooxx** (3): I thought this song was really bad, but after hearing some other songs on this list its getting a 3

**CreepyMannequin** (1): One of the worst vocal performances of all time on a major pop single.

**CopyCatJ** (0): I hate this song Miley doesn't even listen to Jay Z

**ExtraEater**: Goodness do I love the big city. Any particularly glamorous city, really, not just New York. The big labyrinth of buildings and stores, stories and posters everywhere from various colorful forms of media, and not to mention the absolutely gorgeous way it glows in the night. “Empire State of Mind” is an ode to the city as much as it is to New York, evident in its story of celebrities, dreams, and lights. Alicia Keys’ massive and somewhat mondegreen chorus (I thought the chorus was something like “I’ve become the wet dreams of Vegas” for a little too long) is the star here, but Jay-Z’s braggadocio recount of his experiences in the city is nothing to discount. I think it’s pretty funny how Jay-Z dedicates a whole line to the Yankee cap and decides to pay homage to “that McDonald’s.” Anyway, this one’s a classic. One hand in the air for the big CITY!

**ImADudeDuh**: Personally, I feel like 80% of the reason this song is here is just because of Alicia's fucking iconic hook. In NEW YOOOOOOOOOOOOOORK, concrete jungle wet dream toMATO! I am not from New York, and I have never travelled outside of california ever, so it has a hard time relating to me. But guess what, Jay-Z is still a great rapper and this ode to NY is defintely one of the best songs for a place (but songs about California still outpeaked).

---
#ugh, their empire state of MIND it amazes me

**NapsAndNetflix** (11): the greatest song of all time

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): I don’t think I’ve ever heard a song make a better case for a place than this does for New York. It’s slick, perfectly produced, and Jay really gets into the details and experience that make New York unique. However, Alicia Keys is the shining star here, with one of the best choruses I’ve ever heard on a pop track. It’s grand, soaring, and feels like a big encompassing mission statement for an entire city. I love New York, New York, but this is the song that I think of when I think of NYC.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic song. Tik Tok gets a lot of flak for blocking Bad Romance the number 1 but this is the true culprit lol Gags never stood a chance

**CopyCatJ** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG

**enecks** (10): THIS IS A CLASSIC I WANT TO GO TO NEW YORK AND HAVE DATES WITH PEOPLE THAT WON'T WANT TO KILL ME

**fishingfor8** (10): almost got my 11 but i gotta give it to my underdogs The Fray

**gannade** (10): slayicia keys

**ignitethephoenix** (10): An amazing song that says concrete jungle wet dream tomato!

**kappyko** (10): please

**mich4725** (10): such a good pop/rap crossover

**Mysario** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUYSGojUuAU

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I definitely still belt this song in the car and I've never even been close to nyc

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This might not be on Spotify, and I might hate Jay-Z  for being a greedy little dick, but when I reached this song I was in tears. Not just because of how good it was (it’s incredible social commentary and as good as Jay’s rapping is here Alicia’s part is just incredible) but because it came after some of the worst trash to ever disgrace this Year-End and hearing it was actually blessed relief. So, with all due respect, Mr. Carter, you might be a greedy capitalist, but I can say this with utmost sincerity: Gracias. I can go back to sanity again.

**ReallyCreative** (10): One of the few times I enjoy Jay-Z's rapping but Alicia goes OFF and that's what we're here for

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Nearly gave this my 11.

**ryjomom** (10): they had white wheelchair guy rapping in the glee version

**Tchalla1966** (10): This song is literally near perfect truly a moment.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): *crosses the holland tunnel, turns on the radio* “new york, new york” 😎 i am a new yorker.

**twat\_brained** (10): empire_state_of_bacon_pancakes_10_hour_version.mp4 If there's any Jay-Z song that would get radio airplay in 2009 it would be this one, so maybe Miley was onto something here. And goddamn, Alicia's voice is legit goosebumping me here. You can also tell where Jay is coming from with these bars, it genuinely feels like his version of NYC, and not some ingenuine tourism pander. If a perfect rap song exists it has to be this.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): [This is the superior version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUYSGojUuAU)

**jamesfog** (9.5): That was a classic, that was a classic.

**jval888** (9.5): obviously

**hikkaru** (9): Miss Keys snapped

**TragicKingdom1** (9): okay but where is iowa's anthem

**vapourlomo** (9): Obviously a classic.

**waluigiest** (9): wow beautiful homecoming song. -1 because Alicia keys didn’t like her chorus lol

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.8): classic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): wasn't this also on glee

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Overplay really killed this one.

**poppinmmolly** (8): bop

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): tbh the chorus is the only part of this song i like really

**MrSwearword** (7): better production but the overall vibe of it reads as "maybe highlight but not the top for either artist involved"

#METROPOLIS NOCTURNAL EMISSION LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM!!!!!!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): Love me some conk rete jungles, wet dream tomatoes. 👌🏼😪😫

**radiofan15** (10): Concrete Jungle Wet Dreams Tomato snapped

**pearllouise** (9): Concrete jungle wet dream tomato

**tapdancingpig** (9): CONCRETE JUNGLE WET DREAM TOMATO!

**selegend** (8): iconic wet dreams tomato

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): add me to the concrete jungle wet dream tomato section

#West coast, best coast

**PuggleMaster** (6): Alicia Key's solo version outsold

**xxrandooxx** (5): Thank you Alicia Keys

**ExtraEater**: Look no further for a song that embodies the spirit of simple fun in these not yet troubled times of 2009. The reason I love “I Gotta Feeling” is because it just makes the typical night out seem like a grand journey set to be the time of your life. “Just Dance” succeeds on its simplicity and very straightforward message: “Just dance.” This production typifies that late 00s/early 10s dance style to a tee [citation needed, we’re all Gaga stans we can use that as a citation right?]. The title of the song says it all.

**ImADudeDuh**: Fucking video game QUEEN! I still own all just dances from the original to Just Dance 2014 (3 will always be the best followed closely by 4). This is one of the best debut singles I can remember tbh. This really was an iconic pop moment. I remember seeing her everywhere and it honestly never clicked to me in a while that she hasn't been a main thing before 2009. Man, this song is good.

---
#Deserved all the kids choice awards the game won

**1998tweety** (11): Iconic bop that jump-started a legend's career. This song is so infectious and easy to dance to and gets me jumped.

**hikkaru** (11): this is maybe the most nostalgic song ever for me

**ManofOranges** (11): Another iconic song this will not be forgotten 10000 years from now that's how good it is

**MashLuke** (11): still spinning this record

**skargardin** (11): Name a more iconic debut single with such imacculate production. 4 minutes long and there's always a switch-up to keep the listener hooked and interested. Even after ten years it still sounds fresh as fuck!

**tapdancingpig** (11): HALF PSYCHOTIC SICK HYPNOTIC GOT MY BLUEPRINT ITS SYMPHONIC HALF PSYCHOTIC SICK HYPNOTIC GOT MY BLUEPRINT ELECTRONIC

**TragicKingdom1** (11): a truly iconic and innovative pop song. i still excites me in the same way it did when i first heard it

**bespectacIed** (10): I may never comprehend the blind fanaticism this sub has for Gaga, I can't deny the sheer power of Gaga's debut.  This is like the super-concentrated essence of what pop is.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): The bridge here is probably one of my favorite parts of The Fame in general. It still sounds new every time I hear it.

**ggodisawomann** (10): the first Gaga song I ever heard and this was the song that made me stan. didn't take much.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song truly does not age. It’s also one of the best (if not the best) breakout single for a new artist.

**imasalesman** (10): ok but imagine not giving this a 10

**izeasklapaucius** (10): a legend and Lady Gaga.

**jamesfog** (10): Almost as perfect as Poker Fa

**MrSwearword** (10): I might as well embrace this fully and not be super scrupulous like I've been in the past

**Mysario** (10): that bridge always makes me feel weird

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Miss Gaga has her 5’1” foot on our collective necks this album, huh.

**pearllouise** (10): Paid for by Ubisoft

**Plasm\_Trojan** (10): There isn't a bad part of this song.

**PuggleMaster** (10): If a gaga song must win i hope it's this one

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Legendary bridge.

**ryjomom** (10): Created https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Dance_(video_game_series)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song literally fucking invented Ubisoft

**twat\_brained** (10): heard live count - #2 I don't think since …Baby One More Time has someone just announced- nay, commanded everyone's attention just from their debut single. Gaga knew she what she was doing when she and Akon released this as a debut single. Colby's verse shouldn't go unnoticed either. There's this playful chemistry between him and Gaga here which just further fuels this song's brilliance. Instant classic right here.

**vapourlomo** (10): This is going to be one of those songs that plays at proms until the end of time, like Yeah! and Staying Alive, isn't it? I'm very cool with that.

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.5): this was 10 year old me’s gateway drug into pop

**radiofan15** (9.5): RIP in peace Colby's relevance 2008-2009... you'll not be missed

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Not my favorite Gaga single but it's still a solid bop and obviously gets points for launching her career

**enecks** (9): Hey it's near-perfection in pop.

**Tchalla1966** (9): JUST DANCE but I totally ignored this song when it dropped.

**waluigiest** (9): this song started a pop culture revolution

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): As iconic as this song is it really does pale compared to most other gaga hits. Also, i’ve never seen a career go absolutely nowhere more than Colby O’Donis’

**frogaranaman** (8): I was working in retail to this song when it was huge. I was eight.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): I’m sure most of the comments will be making fun of Colby O’Donis for this song being basically his entire career, but it’s still impressive that this song, which feels like something an established artist could have dropped for their second or third album, is Gaga’s debut single. I think I prefer Poker Face for a few reasons (mostly the bridge) but this still bops 10 years later.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): God, I wish my irrelevancy could at least make me as big of a meme as Colby O’Donis. Just Dance’s production is somewhat painful to listen to eleven years on, and I can’t be the only one who’s a little freaked out over its lyrics having a creepy vibe (not from Gaga, but ‘how’d I get my shirt turned inside out?’ is a little more awkward to listen to in hindsight) but it still fulfilled the Pop Girl Prophecy pretty well, and if I ignore how much it belongs in 2008 I can agree pretty well that it’s a huge bop. More than a decade on, and she’s still slaying!

**NotWith10000Men** (7): gaga's voice elevates this beyond being just a regular dancey song

#when the old joanna plays

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): tbh I never listen to this anymore, hasn’t aged well for me. But still a 7 bc I loved it so damn much in year 7

**xxrandooxx** (7): Does she get royalties from the game “Just Dance” because i'm sure it wouldn't have existed if it weren't for her.

**Roxieloxie** (6): so you're telling me this song wasn't on the first just dance game

**\_wailordfan** (5): K unpopular opinion, but this is such an annoying song and I hate that of all of gaga's bops, this is her most career defining track.

**mms82** (5): I'm glad Gaga blew up with this song but it never really did much for me

**selegend** (3): one of her worst

**gannade** (0): sounds like it was produced in garageband. thank u, next

**ExtraEater**: Well, how about that? It's the song that just won the Ultimate 2008 Rate a few months back, but unfortunately it’s not reclaiming the crown this time. Among the songs in this rate also featured in that rate, I'm still surprised that this was the song that ended up on top, as opposed to any of the Fearless songs. Regardless, we welcome it with open arms as one of Katy's early career bops. The PMS lyrics, the classic contrast chorus (Hot vs. Cold), and the "Someone call the doctor" bridge all contribute to one of the best hits of 2008 AND 2009. Definitely check out the Sesame Street version if you haven't. Katy's surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ok, so it will seem like I'm rigging a bit, but this song did lose some of it's sheen on me from the last rate it was in. Tbh, it's mainly just the production. I just feel like the production is so flimsy on this song and like it sounds like a kareoke knock off version of itself. Everything else about this song is still iconic though. I want to give a shoutout to a group of girls in my 5th grade class who made a youtube video with this song playing in the back, but they make a sex joke where they go 👉👌 when she sings "You're in and you're out," and lowkey I didn't get it, but I pretended to be disgusted by it to seem cool like everyone else. So, back in 5th grade, I was lying for clout.

---
#This song is hot hot hot!

**1998tweety** (10): Funny story, I always thought she said “you be a mess” instead of “you PMS”. I also heard “stuck on a rollercoaster”, as “staccato rollercoaster” and was pretty confused. This is easily one of Katy's most iconic songs, the video is everything. Again, I love the rock edge to this song. This is my 11 cause it bops the hardest out of all the other songs on this album.

**Awhile2** (10): teenage dream may be the better album but Hot N Cold and I Kissed a Girl are by far her two best singles

**ggodisawomann** (10): this sent me over the top on stannage and my mom loved this song

**hikkaru** (10): Katy going ✈ two-time winner. We love Sandra Diaz-Twine

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of Katy’s best

**izeasklapaucius** (10): a classic, an easy ten

**jamesfog** (10): A winner.

**MashLuke** (10): what a song

**MrSwearword** (10): Legitimate triumph for Katy

**Mysario** (10): you're so gay and you don't even like boys

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A bop and a half, nothing more to say.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): my intro to katy. Katy where did you go

**pearllouise** (10): Queen of climate change

**PuggleMaster** (10): I would give this my 11 but queen already won with this song

**ReallyCreative** (10): The ultimate Katy song, only Circle the Drain and Last Friday Night really come close

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I think this was actually my most played song in 2009.

**selegend** (10): deserves a second win

**skargardin** (10): I C O N I C

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of my favorite Katy singles and a huge bop, but the Elmo version is obviously the superior song

**TragicKingdom1** (10): deserved to win its rate, but although i am giving it a 10 it does not deserve to win here

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #4 Ah, yes. The second of three previous winners in this rate. Shippy will know better than I do but I bet this, and Love Story went back and forth so I'd expect those two to be pretty close once again. There's no way this won't go at least #5 though. That's my bold prediction for this rate.

**vapourlomo** (10): This was a total banger in 2009, and it's still a total banger in 2019.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): This is one of the most surprising songs to not become a #1. I'd argue this song's more iconic and definitely better than I Kissed A Girl

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9.5): this is a rate winner for a reason

**ryjomom** (9.3): Sesame Street Remix will always have a place in my heart

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.1): katy perry should have stayed in this era

**Plasm\_Trojan** (9.1): Probably Katy's best song.

**ManofOranges** (9): Queen of contrasting imagery when will your fave ever

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.5): miss hudson,,,,,,,

**radiofan15** (8.2): Cute but it's not Ur So Gay cute..

**frogaranaman** (8): You're A then you're B, you're C then you're D, you're E then you're F, you're G then you're H, you're I then

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): If you thought Hot As Ice from Blackout was good, Katy delivers a even better game of opposites to pop music in Hot n Cold. This song’s worn off a little, and I’m not happy that it won over Waking Up In Vegas (which is Katy’s masterpiece!) and Love Story, but it’s still incredibly fun, and the energy she exhibits on this track is more than legendary. :elmo:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ryG6sGiBmc

**waluigiest** (8): it’s fun for sure

#I'm pretty cold on this

**Roxieloxie** (7.6): listen, all i can think of with this song is the genderbent chipmunks version

**enecks** (6): This is just a little too artificial and lyrically messy. The formula needed some tweaks, and the Teenage Dream era (apart from the awful title single) delivered that.

**ExtraEater**: How many times could I use the word "glamour" when talking about this era of Lady Gaga, anyway? Well, behind "Bad Romance" this song merits the word the most because that's all it's about. This one's for the fame, the celebrity lifestyle, and for its masterful personification of the rabid and flashy paparazzi. And of course, we all have to love the wild and iconic VMAs performance that likely traumatized and assimilated thousands of viewers, young and old, into the Gaga-verse.

**ImADudeDuh**: AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My 2nd fave gaga song being the 2nd gaga song in the rate makes me sad! I have fucking loved this song for so long. I remember seeing THAT performance and my mom audibly gasping. There's just something about the obsessive nature of this song that just works for me. I love how she's commited to this guy. I love the trashy yet glamourous feel of this song. I love the fucking bridge of this song oh my god. I just love everything about it. Ugh, WHY did we call Poker Face better than this??

---
#Daddy, Daddy razzi

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): I was going to give my 11 to something else until I heard this song again. The Fame has such great songs, especially their bridges. Paparazzi's bridge is great, but the chorus is my favorite part of this song. Gaga's voice here is incredible, especially at the "promise I'll be kind" part. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite The Fame songs and Lady Gaga songs in general.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (11): this is the song that got me into gaga. the masterpiece of a video, the song itself, it's really something amazing. a fucking moment.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): One of Gaga’s best songs! The chorus is so good and this song I feel like it represents this era of Gaga and her transition to the Fame Monster era so well.

**mich4725** (11): This song is perfection. Sorry Day N Nite but this having an 11 is a must

**MrSwearword** (11): GAGA'S BEST SONG EVER [probably not gonna win the rate but hey, the best song in the rate is the best song in the rate]

**pearllouise** (11): I'm not gonna lie, nothing is better than watching blood gush from Gaga's boobs on live tv.

**1998tweety** (10): Love this song, so so iconic. Despite being kind of catchy, releasing this as a single was so risky cause of how broody it is and how weird the lyrics are.

**bespectacIed** (10): Hot take o'clock - this is the song/video, not Bad Romance, that made Gaga almost reach Madonja levels of pop legend status. Iconic in all levels and all its forms (song, video, live performances)

**enecks** (10): Gaga really had ambition with this song in particular. She's been riffing off this formula for the rest of her career - be it the video for Telephone, the ambitious mistake of Do What U Want, the tragic reinterpretation of A Star is Born.

**ggodisawomann** (10): still Paparazzi's biggest fan (not really but the sentiment is there)

**jamesfog** (10): Was obsessed with this in 2009 whew!

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another iconic Gaga song and the music video has me quaking to this day

**MashLuke** (10): iconic

**Mysario** (10): anyone else remember that Greyson Chance cover of this?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Amazing. She snapped here.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (10): this is pop perfection

**radiofan15** (10): I think this is the song that really got me into the Gaga train... the chorus is so euphoric and beautiful that you just can't resist it

**ryjomom** (10): BLOOD, HANGING, MIC DROP, DANCING, VOCALS

**starla\_** (10): The best single from The Fame

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): This is still gaga’s best song and any other opinion is wrong

**tapdancingpig** (10): I love this song so much. I love the video, I love the VMAs performance, but more importantly, it’s just a good tune. It’s a really weird half ballad half super poppy hybrid with a typically amazing early-Gaga bridge.

**Tchalla1966** (10): THIS this was the song that got me into Lady Gaga and I bless the gods for it i’ve loved it from 1st listen till now 10 YEARS OF PAPARAZZI! The music Video was a GREAT ADDITION TO IT.

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #11 LADY GAGA IS OVER! The woman predicted her career during the mid-2010s all the way back in 2009! When will your faves? Also when will Gaga makes another video as half as epic as this? I mean I loved A Star is Born and Shallow deserved its Oscar win but we need another pop video like this from Gaga.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): This is, without a doubt, the best single from the Fame. It has some of the only production on the album that I’d consider timeless, and Gaga’s satirical attitude towards fame before she even hit it still holds up well today. The rap verse on this song is also campy, but tolerable, which is already a major improvement over every Gaga song from this time period. Are we just going to ignore that this is obviously sung from the perspective of Irene Adler from the classic Sherlock Holmes story A Scandal in Bohemia, though? I mean ‘that photo of you/it don’t have a price’? Come on!

**xxrandooxx** (9.5): Lady gaga bleeding out while performing this song live is A.R.T

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): Very much on the same level as Just Dance for me, great but not legendary. It's still classic Gaga magic but it doesn't stack up to some of the stronger singles. Love the chorus to death though!

**gannade** (9): yeah im a twink, what about it? Thank u, next.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Honestly probably my favorite of the Gaga songs in here, the hook is easily one of her best and it has kind of a darker, moodier vibe that really works.

**waluigiest** (9): this song radiates strength

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.7): hang on, i just need to grab my camera

**Awhile2** (8): i remember coming up with a parody of this song about Popcorn and then i got mad when i heard other kids copying it without giving me credit

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I forgot how low key this song was compared to her other songs from this era

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): tmz is shaking

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I liked this before it was popular eks dee

#TMZ needs to be fucking abolished

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): ok but like the production sounds so aged to me???

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): production has aged horribly but kinda iconic ugh

**frogaranaman** (6): I don't trust men who ask me to take x pictures with them.

**Roxieloxie** (5.5): I've only heard the kids bop version of this song from commercials and the actual version is similar

ExtraEater: If **Poker Face** wins, then Lady Gaga will have won TWO rates in a row after the [previous All Stars rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/arndji/all_stars_2_day_3_the_final_countdown/egoo6dh/)! It will mark the first(?) instance of a song [losing a rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5772nl/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8prvwb/) only to win another rate that *isn't* an All Stars rate. Plus, topping an internet forum game is roughly on par with recently becoming the first person ever to win an Oscar, Grammy, Golden Globe, and a BAFTA in ONE YEAR! This will give Gaga her third rate win!

If **Disturbia** wins, it will have topped a poll against OTHER artists after conquering the [Rihanna discography fanvote](https://redd.it/ajah64)! It will mark the second instance after the Billboard 2012 rate that a song in the 70-79 section of the chart that was much bigger the previous year manages to win anyway. Plus, topping an internet forum game is roughly on par with becoming ambassador of Barbados! This will give Rihanna her second rate win!

**ExtraEater**: Rihanna's monolithic pop figure has produced a wealth of great music to the point that Disturbia, a quality song that would easily be the best in a slightly lesser pop girl's discography, is but a decent contender for her best song. It's far from a genuinely horrifying tune, but "Disturbia" nails the perfect sweet-spot of Halloween terror mixed with Halloween festivity. I like to think that "bam bum..." hook can surely be considered a recognizable melodic line, but I know I'm just dreaming. Fun fact: This song just recently topped a [Rihanna fanvote ranking](https://redd.it/ajah64) held on this very sub!

**ImADudeDuh**: FUCK! I wanted this to win so much more than Poker Face. I love Disturbia so much. Like I said in If You Seek Amy, I fucking love dark pop songs, and Disturbia is the QUEEN of it. The atmostphere. Rihanna's voice. The lyrics. The melody. The background vocals. Everything about this song, FUCK ING WORKS! I just love everything about this, this is fucking THE halloween anthem forever. The fact that this is second fucking kills me! I wish Paparazzi was at least the Gaga song to beat it!

#Disturbing, in a good way

**CopyCatJ** (11): I LOVE RIHANNA, this song used to scare the shit out of me when I was 8

**PuggleMaster** (11): I remember listening to this in the car after Christmas. Everything about this song is iconic

**1998tweety** (10): One of my favourite Rihanna songs, this was my shit when it dropped. Lowkey I think Rih was the first pop girl I stanned.

**bespectacIed** (10): This is THE quintessential good girl gone bad song and the one that truly represents Rih's shedding of the cutesy persona. After this song she became THE badass Rih, and we are all blessed for it

**gannade** (10): queen of onomatopeia

**ggodisawomann** (10): yes

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): ugh this really is an 11 of a song, it's so sonically COOL, rihanna is the coolest person alive, im a lesbian

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The spookiest bop of all time! Can’t believe Rihanna invented Halloween!

**jamesfog** (10): CLASSIC. LOVED THIS SONG SINCE IT CAME OUT. YAASSS!!!

**kappyko** (10): yes.

**ManofOranges** (10): I hate how my first memories of this song are of it playing over AMVs

**MashLuke** (10): amazing

**MrSwearword** (10): quality Rihanna. SLAY

**Mysario** (10): I love Shia LaBouf

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): If This was the 2008 list, this would get my 11. The atmosphere is great, especially for a mainstream pop song. Rihanna sounds absolutely fantastic here. And those backing vocals are such an earworm.

**pearllouise** (10): Ugh the nostalgia. It stings.

**radiofan15** (10): This slaps harder than Chris Brown's fist, who, BTW, co wrote this track

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't know why, but taking Rihanna an octave down is like the perfect register for me and I can make this song WORK.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Released 2 weeks before the end of the year and it's this high up, legendary.

**ryjomom** (10): The only thing disturbed by this song is my wig.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (10): we ranked this as the best Rihanna song for a reason

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): did anyone else used to love DogLover1998’s dance to this on youtube?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I thought Rihanna was singing about the Shia LaBeouf movie for years

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this and SOS are rihanna's two best dancepop songs, fight me

**enecks** (9): This is so good, but just a little bit uncomfortable knowing what happened soon after with everyone involved.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): iconic song and album art

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I know that Chris Brown wrote this and that alone is a bit disturbing (ha, ha, ha, I’m a comedic genius) but I don’t really care about that in the end because when Rihanna says ‘ba dum dee dum, ba dum dee dum’ it’s over for me, and I’m forced to stream the song on Spotify and give Brown the shamefully high value of half a cent in revenue. I am displeased that it’s not as…scary as I’d hope it’d be, but at the end of the day I just really related to Riri singing ‘What’s wrong with me?’ A very excellent addition to Good Girl Gone bad for sure!

**poppinmmolly** (9): would be a 10 but I am docking a point because Chris Brown and I have to maintain my level of woke.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Halloween party classic right here

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): like we found love, the track is really amazing

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.1): great for a middle school dance party

**frogaranaman** (8): Dicks u'rp in ya.

**twat\_brained** (8): I had to rewatch the video to see where Detox appears. I now realize she is Rihanna's right-hand woman when Rih is seated with that Kris Jenner-looking ass hairdo of hers while Detox wilds out on the cot. I'm surprised I wasn't more spooked out from this video when I was 10 years old. I'm also surprised at the numerous layers of AutoTune on Rihanna's vocals. She doesn't need that much, damn.

**waluigiest** (8): dark banger

**Plasm\_Trojan** (7.5): The closest a song's ever come to actually feeling like halloween imo.

#You're scaring me mom

**CarlieScion** (6): not the best track on good girl gone bad

#Autotune and a writing credit is the only reason why this song lost btw

**tapdancingpig** (2): Issa catchy song, but her autotune is somehow too noticeable and not prominent enough. ~~Also fuck Chris Brown~~

**ExtraEater**: How about that dark, cavernous introduction and those commanding echoes of “Mum mum mum mah?” The woman of the hour has stepped onto the scene and everyone’s stopping to get a peek of this mysterious darling. Lady Gaga’s mythos wasn’t really that intriguing to me back in the day, all I knew is that this stuff was catchy and the parodies were (at the time) funny. The music video in particular sends me back in time pretty effectively.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ok this is a scorching hot take, but this is not that good a song. This song has a bad taste in my mouth since it was supposed to be abour Gaga being bisexual, but she has said that she isn't bisexual recently? It doesn't make me feel good. Plus, the production is not exactly stellar. But the muh muh muh muh and "poke her face" joke make it so I can't stay mad at this.

---
#There were no bad comments. As Troye would say if he were on this song, "Muh Muh Muh!"

**jamesfog** (11): A pop song that defined her career and pop culture in early 21st century.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (11): The best hit of the year, easily. The production alone is leaps and bounds above most other songs

**radiofan15** (11): The RAH RAH bitch keeps winning my heart and my anus

**rslashpoopheads** (11): Legitimately one of the greatest pop songs of all time.

**ryjomom** (11): MUM MUM MUM MAH ✌♫♪˙❤‿❤˙♫♪✌ Lady Gaga truly is an art tist

**twat\_brained** (11): heard live count - #1 The fact that the only other time we've rated this, it lost to Bad Romance, tells me that this song, on paper, is probably in the best position to win the rate. As such, combined with my total love of this song and its status as my favorite song on The Fame, I am scoring it my 11, because in my opinion, this song epitomizes late 2000s pop and if it doesn't win my 10-year-old self will be having a very strongly-worded argument with you guys.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic bop. I guess this is considered a bigger hit than Just Dance? Shame since I prefer the latter

**bespectacIed** (10): Definition of pop perfection. This or Just Dance will undoubtedly gonna win and as a gaga non-fan, I can't even complain this time, so I am just gonna be that bitter betty who'll say The Edge of Glory didn't deserve to have won the ugly all-stars rate.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): If I could give all of The Fame singles an 11 I would

**enecks** (10): Hey it's perfection in pop.

**gannade** (10): yeah im a twink, what about it? Thank u, next.

**ggodisawomann** (10): a classic

**hikkaru** (10): yaaas gagaaaa yaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Honestly one of the greatest modern pop songs. The production at the beginning of this song is so amazing and this song is a lot more clever than I think most people give it credit for. It’s easily one of Lady Gaga’s best all time, and I think it was very impactful as well.

**imasalesman** (10): iconic

**izeasklapaucius** (10): a classic. with my muffin i'm not lyin'.

**ManofOranges** (10): Literally a legendary song

**MashLuke** (10): muffin

**MrSwearword** (10): always nice to see this and stan

**Mysario** (10): I play poker every week with my friends and I got a royal flush the other day which is p impossible to get so I ended up bumping this in my own honour

**pearllouise** (10): We love a bisexual anthem

**ReallyCreative** (10): Amazing video, amazing beat, fun lyrics with a possible bisexual twist (which is always exciting), Poker Face is iconic for all the right reasons

**selegend** (10): i know this’ll win and i’ll just be a little mad

**Tchalla1966** (10): funnily enough this wasn’t the song that got me into Lady Gaga but still a BOP.

**waluigiest** (10): from the very intro this song is legendary. Bisexual anthem for the ages

**kappyko** (9.5): her best clearly

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9.5): t-t-t top the rate t-t-t top the rate

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): I think this single was what truly established who Gaga was, at least in the beginning.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): i used to like this slightly less but i can acknowledge how iconic it is much easier nowadays

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.1): learned everything i know about poker from the queen herself

**mich4725** (9): very surprised it's not no. 1. Classic while I basically forgot about existence of BBP (in Europe it wasn't more popular for sure)

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I can only tolerate Poker Face’s rap verse because of how awesome the rest of the song is, and Poker Face’s rap verse is downright *awful* (bluffin with my muffin!) so that should be an indicator of how excellent it is as an entire body of work. This is one of the few songs from the Fame to escape the cursed of being super dated, and Gaga’s performance on the track is excellent and just more proof that bisexuals always make them best music. Just Dance may have made Gaga blew up, but this is the single that defined her to the general public for the first time, and it damn well deserves it.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): I remember always preferring Just Dance to this but now it’s the superior of the two

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Like a lot of people, this was my first introduction to Gaga. It’s definitely a product of its time sonically, but the prechorus and hook are still timeless and iconic.

**\_wailordfan** (8.5): CAN'T READ MY CAN'T READ MY MAH MAH MAH PAH PAH PAH PERFECT ILLUSION

**Plasm\_Trojan** (8.5): This song invented bluffing.

**xxrandooxx** (8.5): Iconic

**jval888** (8): has gotten much better with age

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I didn't even like gaga back then but I still loved this song

**fishingfor8** (7): 2010s gaga is better

**frogaranaman** (7): The first ever pride I was sexually active for, I hooked up with a guy who played a Spotify playlist titled "Pop Pride" or some shit like that. I’m about 90% certain this song was the song we nutted to.

# 2009 Year-End

---

**Overall average**: 6.802

---

**TragicKingdom1**: tbh? a year that's grown on me for pop music. it's wayyy better than the surrounding years at least, and some of it has started to age nicely

**CarlieScion**: Great album tbh

**letsallpoo**: I didn't realize until this rate started how *weird* this year was for US hits. In the top 10 alone we have: a song that samples an 80s Dead or Alive song, a schoolgirl interpretation of *Romeo and Juliet*, Beyonce's most obnoxious hit, a song with an instrumental that's almost entirely ukulele, and two downright bizarre BEP songs - even just structurally, they're all over the map. Further down you'll find a Jason Derulo song that samples Imogen Heap, a Flo Rida song that samples Eiffel 65, a T.I. song that samples the Numa Numa meme, Shakira singing about becoming a furry, two versions of "Halo," and 3OH!3. I think the general weirdness of this year contributes to how its remembered so fondly.

**bespectacIed**: While we're all being wistful about how wonderful 2009 was for music/life in general, let's listen to Mac Miller's [2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B3YwcjQ_bU)

**frogaranaman**: Obama got elected and musicians just nutted so hard with their music releases, huh?

**twat\_brained**: As one of the cohosts of the 2008 Rate, I'm going into this rate with some previous knowledge. I will put that knowledge to the test and use it to benchmark the averages in this rate. There are a few songs whose averages I would like to see get raised. Others with averages I want lowered. In any case I'm looking forward to this reveal. As a matter of fact, I'm going to see how many of these songs I've heard live.

bespectacIed: For what it's worth, this has been the most correct rate winner in a long while ~~looking at you, edge of **gory**~~. Poker Face **IS** the defining 2009 song. 

Doesn't excuse all the robbery and reemphasizing popheads' ugly side that we been knew for a long time
