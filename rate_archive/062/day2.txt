**ExtraEater**: As TragicKingdom1 mentioned below, I commend this song for its "icy", chill beat and general demeanor. The drunken autotune-heavy singing and the whole stutter dynamic shouldn't be so good, but Jamie Foxx and T-Pain came through with this song.

**ImADudeDuh**: With so many autotuned songs already out today, it was interesting to see if the king of autotune himself would be able to escape this day. It was close, but he sadly could not beat it. This song is pretty iconic, especially the chorus being instantly quotable af. But outside of it, there is not much this song has going for it. It's another party song, but I feel as though the autotune on this song got in it's own way too much. At least T-Pain won The Masked Singer, so he wins in the end!

#Blame it on the POP!

**MrSwearword** (10): a rare case of "2009 as hell but still fucking slaps"

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Iconic. If you don’t like this song, you don’t have a soul.

**Mysario** (9.9): took away a 0.1 because Glee ended up doing it better

**kappyko** (9): The weirdest, most discordant club song. You can hear the song crumbling as it goes on, Jamie Foxx struggling to hold onto the stuttering post-Timbo electro synths with Auto-tune and vocal phaser(?) effects galore. It's fun but it's genuinely scary in how many melodies it squeezes in, you can't hear where this song is going at all. The only "human" part of this song is the awkward "hey"s in the back, so maybe this was better off a wholly robotic venture. This is genuinely artful.

**ManofOranges** (9): I was expecting to not like this but actually it's a bop don't let the autotune distract you from the fact that this deserves at least an 8

**wholesomebody** (9): crank the autotune up

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): sounds icy and chill in a v good way

**radiofan15** (8.2): The Glee version outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this just made me throw back to that time they covered this on Glee lmao

**MashLuke** (8): super fun

#Take responsibilities for your actions

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is my least favourite so far

**DrunkHurricane** (7): "Fill another cup up / Feelin' on your butt what / You don't even care now" Y I K E S

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): in the words of my flatmate, 'i only know this cause of glee' god 2009 was a fever dream

**poppinmmolly** (7): this was better back in 2009

**rosecoloreds** (7): i only know this song from that glee episode where they all became alcoholics

**Roxieloxie** (7): oh yeah jamie foxx is a singer

**twat\_brained** (7): Why the hell did this music video have such a star-studded lineup and what's with the use of blue and red club lights? When people say the 2000s didn't make sense this video is what they have in mind.

**waluigiest** (7): chorus is a legendary banger. Verses kinda suck

**frogaranaman** (6): Travis Scott heard this song and its lack of beat changes every verse and centered his career around this travesty.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): throwback banger

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I bopped to this a bit the first time I heard it but I honestly don’t like it as much anymore. As great as the beat is here, there’s less and less charisma to both artists on the track the more you listen to it, and while T-Pain is iconic for his use of Autotune, I’m not particularly fond of the way it’s executed on this song. It’s mid-to-low tier on this Year End, IMO.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): There’s a lot of great T-Pain hooks but I really don’t think this one was all that great

**enecks** (5): Weird Al did this better

**fishingfor8** (5): *already forgets what song this is*

**ggodisawomann** (5): this one was just okay, it was never my fav

**jamesfog** (5): Ich.- This aged horribly

**pearllouise** (5): Ray Charles better lay off the drinking

**ReallyCreative** (5): It's a fun meme song but that's about it

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5): Blame it on the boring songwriting

**tapdancingpig** (5): The beat is really cool! If only the song attached to it was good...

**ryjomom** (4): the chorus is such a mood, I blame it on $10 Fleischmann’s Vodka

**xxrandooxx** (3.4): Blaming your toxic actions on alcohol is toxic

**Plasm\_Trojan** (3): You know a song is mediocre when a Polka cover by Weird Al is ten times better.

**PuggleMaster** (3): I'm still sick of this song 10 years later

**rslashpoopheads** (3): The source of all my alcohol knowledge in middle school.

**mich4725** (1): reminder that there wasn't much less terrible hip-hop back then than today

**selegend** (1): absolutely not

**ExtraEater**: Maxwell, not to be confused with MAX of "Lights Down Low" fame (please don't, it's happened before), is a pretty well-known and likable artist in the R&B/soul sphere. In addition to "Lake by the Ocean", this song is another one of his hits that are really good. The production is lush and hazy, and although it's lower on this list and not quite up the Popheads alley it deserves some love.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song is sweet! Maxwell is an rnb artist that no one really mentions anymore. I personally don't find him that interesting, but his delivery in this song is so compelling that it just makes me want to root for him, even though he wants the girl to leave if she really wants to. He's okay with letting relationships end if they really aren't working out. He's a real nice guy and not an r/niceguy.

---
#Pretty sings

**fishingfor8** (10): look classic rnb, do decent please, also i need a modern rnb subreddit if someone knows of one or wants to make one PM me

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh woooow, talk about a throwback. This reminds me of my parents in a really nice way.

**ReallyCreative** (9.6): I LOVE this, it's so chill, the instrumentation and beat are both perfect. Really pleasant listen.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I was bored out of my mind listening to this initially, mainly because piano ballads can feel like an eternity in purgatory if you’re not ready for them, but once I was aware of its length my ability to enjoy its artist’s excellent vocals and ability to control the piano increased greatly. I’m not sure what this Maxwell bloke is doing outside of Super Scribblenauts, but at the end of the day I’d call this one of the most underrated songs on this Year-End.

**1998tweety** (8): this is kind of nice

**TragicKingdom1** (8): a very technically competent song but not something i would revisit

**radiofan15** (7.7): It somehow got better as it moved forward... no idea who this guy is but he already got my attention

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): pretty song

**MashLuke** (7): smooth

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): A fine R&B track. My mom loves this song more than I do.

**pearllouise** (7): I sing this whenever my mom comes home with chicken

**waluigiest** (7): I didn’t know this one but it’s pretty nice

#WHO?!?!?!?

**jamesfog** (6): Mehh

**kappyko** (6): uncut, you say? i understand maxwell is a critical darling and well-belvoed in soul camps but this is certainly not his best

**xxrandooxx** (6): Good 2009 melatonin

**enecks** (5): Pretty meh

**MrSwearword** (5): just middling as fuck

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): prit t wangz

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.4): boring, almost put me to sleep

**twat\_brained** (3.6): he's not saying "pretty wings", he's saying "pre. tee. wayngs." And he shouldn't be on this list in favor of more deserving songs like the Jonas Brothers' "Paranoid". Speaking of which stream Sucker

**frogaranaman** (3): Slow-jam R&B really was an era in time, huh?

**ryjomom** (1): This made the top 100 of 2009? I think the fuck not.

#Scribblenauts' main character sweetie...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Now this is just my personal opinion. The name Maxwell to me is such an ugly, brute and barbaric name, a name so disgusting that few words can give it a just description. I wouldn't give the name Maxwell to my worst enemy, although that is because they are probably named Maxwell already. Whenever I encounter a Maxwell, I can sense it without even being introduced... you just get that feeling, something shifts in the air pressure, the birds stop chirping, and I have the sudden urge to vomit; you know when a Maxwell is near. God created the name Maxwell for the rest of the human race to identify those of which we should shun, beat, extradite, and curse until they have no option but to dig themselves underground like the moles they are and live the rest of their worthless lives with the worms and decomposing bodies. If any Maxwell out there is reading this, I want you to take your fist, smash your computer screen, and eat the shard that falls from it.

**ExtraEater**: Akon being Akon. Originally, my write-up was just that but the completionist in me just can't accept that. In all honesty, I likely resorted to something so reductive and quick because this honestly feels unfinished and without climax, feeling like a predecessor to the infinitely better "I Just Had Sex" with The Lonely Island just a few years later. I love that "I wanna get with youuuuu" hook and the whole beach party mood it has going on, but from this period of Akon alone I prefer "Right Now (Na Na Na)." Still, this ain't bad.

**ImADudeDuh**: The first song everyone associates with Colby O'Donis, just like the last Akon song, it is very okay. It's another song that is talking about their plans for the relationship of a girl, they just met in the club? Didn't they read Romeo and Juliet? This doesn't work out in the end! However, I feel like Kardinal Offishall, who's name is just a mess, has a really great rap verse. Like, way too good for this song.

---
#I feel pretty

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I used to fucking write “like the clouds you drift me away” and my boyfriend wrote “like the sun you brighten the day” on our hands to cement our one month relationship

**kappyko** (9): i'm crying why am i watching stickmen on youtube on a friends laptop while we fight with lightsabers... the guitar tones on here evoke the outro to "say it right", while making a sweet contrast with the dreamy dance synths.

**jamesfog** (8.5): You're so damn beautiful :yas:

**ggodisawomann** (8): so 2019 is the year of remembering Colby O'Donis

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Of the two Akon songs in this rate, I’m not sure which is surperior, but I think I’m going to have to pick Right Now because of a stronger hook being attached to it; however, Beautiful definitely has a more solid atmosphere to it overall. It’s also nice to see Akon actually romantically addressing women like they’re human beings (the ‘not like a hooker, but more like a princess’ line is a little awkward in 2019, though). Miss Independent is a still a stronger  example of this, though!

**skargardin** (8): Come back Akon we miss you and your autotuned greatness

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel beautiful after listening to this song. Thanks Akon!

**mich4725** (7.5): generic and cheesy, but with such a good melody it's still great for what it is

#I hate you cause you're beautiful

**twat\_brained** (7.2): Colby had a second hit? I forgot he was on this. I've also forgotten what Kardinal's verse was like. I wish we hadn't collectively left Colby in the 2000s but Kardinal can stay there

**poppinmmolly** (7): my friends and I thought this was "Break Your Heard" by Taio Cruz until the chorus hit.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this is like the holy trinity of huge artists that literally haven’t been googled in the last month

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): This is like a mausoleum of has-beens.

**ReallyCreative** (6.2): this song is like the poor man's Down imo

**Roxieloxie** (6): it's good but it didn't need to be this long

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): This song is whatever but have y’all seen that video of Akon throwing a fan off the stage man is JACKED

**vapourlomo** (6): Colby O'Donis has a second song?!?

**frogaranaman** (5): I'm certain that not a single word was spelled correctly in the writing session for this song.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): i forgot about autotune, wow!

**MrSwearword** (5): too middling for derision

**Tchalla1966** (5): a okay bop but its missing something

**waluigiest** (5): this blends into 2009 radio friendly r&b

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.3): this song has no end

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Akon is awful.

**ryjomom** (4): Colby O’Donis finally got a job after Just Dance

**TragicKingdom1** (4): akon sounds horrible on this song

**xxrandooxx** (3.2): 2009 was so damn Boring

**enecks** (3): hey colby O'donis isn't a one hit wonder

**nightjesus** (3): omg this song just drains on

**pearllouise** (3): Xtina did it better

**NotWith10000Men** (2): can't stand akon

**radiofan15** (1): Xtina, Mariah, Moby, Carly, Carole, Snoop, and even Bazzi outsold them

**ExtraEater**: I always found this song kind of the embodiment of ‘easygoing’ and silly at heart. I want to talk about the music video because it pretty much captures how I feel when I listen to this song. It’s a bunch of pals hanging out for trips to the beach, the waterfall, out elsewhere in nature, etc. What really nails it is the part where he starts to ride on the bus. Like, doesn’t anyone enjoy that feeling after you’ve spent a whole morning at the beach or water park or something and you’re riding home on a bus at like 3 p.m. reflecting over how fun the day was and how you’re totally ready to take a shower and chill for the rest of the day as soon as you get home? To top it all off, the video includes a campfire and everyone being all happy and stuff. This type of music (you know what I mean by that) garners a lot of flack, but honestly when it’s this sweet and musically evocative of good times, I can’t bring myself to hate it. It mildly reminds me of my old home in the Philippines, too. Good shit. Also this is miles ahead of Wonderwall.

**ImADudeDuh**: Is this THE "white guy with a guitar/ukulele at a beach" song? Yes. Does that mean this song is bad? No. Does that mean it deserves to be this low? FUCK NO!!!! This is one of the cutest songs ever written. It's simple, but effective. That "doo da doo doo do do" bridge is great and this song will never fail to make me smile.

#I won't hesitate, to hit replay!

**1998tweety** (10): Wholesome

**bespectacIed** (10): I only acknowledge the original, more relaxing  of the two official versions of this song, which wasn't the one included in the playlist. Still, this is one of the most memorable and universally-loved songs this century, and for good reason.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**PuggleMaster** (10): bisexual Virginian king!

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song is gonna get brutally murdered on day one which is the only reason im not giving it my 11. This song is truly one of those anchor songs. It's so calming any time i hear it i just transport to 2011 and being on my nook listening to it on pandora. ~~also the bisexuals are claiming this song~~

**ggodisawomann** (9): what a sweet lil bop

**Mysario** (9): I'm a sucker for ukuleles

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I adore this so much, it’s such a cheesy love song that makes me smile so hard.

**MrSwearword** (8): might as well be his best song but I ain't giving it full marks against this field

**ryjomom** (8): another white guy with a guitar… but it’s kinda good lol

**waluigiest** (8): simple but really gets the job done

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): objectively good but not enough time in the world can replace the overexposure this had. I'm still kind of tired of it.

**\_wailordfan** (7): the scat breakdown is kinda annoying, but if this isn't the best white boy with a guitar anthem, then what is?

**jamesfog** (7): Hugely overplayed white bop

**MashLuke** (7): okay

**mich4725** (7): good summer chill song

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Oh, wow, I can already remember this song being played at every school assemble I went to back when I was a kid (see? I’m not that young!). I can try to grumble about how cheesy it is and how much it fits into your typical singer-songwriter profile all you like, but by my second listen of this song I’d already softened up to how pleasant its summery vibe was. I’m still not a huge fan of it, but it’s a nice, chill, hit, and I have to give props to Jason Mraz for coming out!

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I like this more before I heard 10000000000000 bad ukelele renditions by everyone and their mom.

**starla\_** (7): I own the album on cd! But this was massively overplayed, so much so that i am still sick of it

**tapdancingpig** (7): This song is cute. It’s definitely cute. But it was so overplayed I can’t quite bring myself to like it again.

#I tried to be chill, but this song fucking sucked

**izeasklapaucius** (6): epitome of basic bro.

**ManofOranges** (6): This song is just so boring I can't do it!

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): Hated it a lot more then than I do now

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Don’t let this rate distract you from the fact that Jason Mraz is the sole provider of avocados for Chipotle.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5.5): i can’t say anything about this song is remarkable other than how frustrated it makes me for no good reason

**frogaranaman** (5): This song is a plague to café shop playlists, but at least acoustic covers of this song get played more often than the original.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I used to like this song more but it just gets on my nerves now

**ReallyCreative** (5): The heterosexuality of it all, I really want to like this song but there's something about it that just grates the fibers of my being. Some of the verses are actually pretty good though, but the chorus just DRAGS until the end where it picks up into something listenable.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): When I watched VH1 Top 20 Countdown all the time in the late 2000s, this song played constantly, and I got soooo tired of it. Ten years later, it’s not offensively bad, but it’s annoyingly catchy. The “do-dodododdooo” bridge will play on a loop when I inevitably end up in hell.

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.5): i remember this being better. very predictable

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): I still hear this song so damn often and I kinda hate it. Not a mraz fan

**kappyko** (4): Sweet singer/songwriter lite-pop affair, borrowing from pop reggae and ripping from Jack Johnson liberally. Ed Sheeran then followed this guy's footsteps and the rest is history.

**xxrandooxx** (3.8): Okay...

**selegend** (3): bisexual icon has a good voice but i can’t stand his music because of how obsessed white people were it

**twat\_brained** (3): oh god my left eye is twitching from hearing that opening guitar slide. this song just bores the hell out of me, and I'd be really happy to never hear it again. it is the definition of radio filler. I’m not even gonna bother listening to the whole song because it's been forcibly tattooed into my memories.

**radiofan15** (2.2): As much as Jason is a bisexual icon and both 'Lucky' and 'I Won't Give Up' are BOPS, this song is just so fucking boring OMG

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): garbage in 2009, garbage now. also i did this rate with my flatmates and my flatmate with awful taste loved this song.

**pearllouise** (2): too white

**enecks** (1): NO. This is some fuckboi-core.

**TragicKingdom1** (1): this is the most covered song on an acoustic guitar since Wonderwall and that's honestly insulting to Wonderwall because that one has actual musical merit and talent

**vapourlomo** (0): I'm already deathly allergic to acoustic guitar songs, but I don't think any of them are worse than this. It's the audio equivalent of a fedora.

**ExtraEater**: Somewhere deep in the clouded annals of my personal history is this really minor hit. I don't recall where or how I heard it, but I remember somewhat loving it and dancing to it. Now that it's finally resurfaced after all these years, I can't find myself hating it even though it's remarkably plain and cheesy pop reggae. It's honestly the definition of "average", but nostalgia is lifting me back up and making me dance like I always did.

**ImADudeDuh**: The fact that this song doesn't even have 1 million youtube views yet is very telling about it. This is such a non-island person trying to make island music, but I still don't hate it. The production is cute and Michael Franti, who gives me major youth pastor vibes, is okay on this. Also, this song played on the radio SO MUCH for me that I thought this was way older than 2009. I'm lowkey shook to find out this barely turns 10 this year.

#Hawaiian vacation time!

**izeasklapaucius** (10): this is surprisingly a great non-offensive feel-good song. I bet it had already been used in some 3D animation kids movie.

**kappyko** (10): WALGHAEOHGEAOGHKAEWGHKWAEGKAWEKLGLALFWALKFWLEGAHKGALG NOOOOOOOOOOOO

**mms82** (10): wow can't believe this is being rated I love this song

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**pearllouise** (10): BOP! Pop girls Michael Franti and Spearhead snapped on this one

**poppinmmolly** (10): a cute bop!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): i never actually knew the name of this song but it slaps

**strawberryswing1** (10): AMAZING

**Mysario** (9.5): idk why but this reminds me of Arthur every time I hear it

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Underrated.

**frogaranaman** (8): Deductions for admitting to heteronormativity.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This is probably the most uplifting song on the list and that earns a bunch of points

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): this song slaps so hard but i cant relate so

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is good for a reggae song

**jamesfog** (7): Oh this was a cute bop back in the day

#Now say, I was doing just fine before i met you

**waluigiest** (7): I thought this song came out in like 1992

**CarlieScion** (6): if you told me this song was from Moana I would believe you

**enecks** (6): Hay

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I first began this rate during the cursed 7 Rings backlash that haunted us at the start of the year, and seeing Cherine Anderson’s characters being displayed in Japanese script on Spotify almost gave me a stroke. I am not sure who any of the three people on this song happen to be, and I can’t imagine it as anything other than the type of cute song to be featured prominently in a hypothetical animated children’s movie that ends up being a box-office bomb. This is  fine, but in a rate full of incredibly successful attempts at experimentation and hilariously bad tries at the same thing, it ends up becoming even more boring.

**tapdancingpig** (6): Wait this song isn’t 100 years old?

**ryjomom** (5.5): Catchier than the baseball players I fantasize about

**xxrandooxx** (5.5): This song sounds like it was on sesame street.

**MashLuke** (5): not into it

**MrSwearword** (5): cheap sentiments over loosely tinged with white versions of "island tings" so...just blase

**TragicKingdom1** (5): michael franti would be cancelled in a 2009 popheads for being a white guy with dreads and using the word "ghetto"

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): Heterosexual bullshit, it's cheery but it's also just... boring as fuck

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.3): sounds like a knock-off lilo and stitch

**twat\_brained** (3): I can't avoid this so I may as well just listen. This is completely overrated and I'm disappointed this made it to the rate. It just feels too sugary sweet, wholesome and innocent. It's like these cupcakes at this bakery near where I live; they're just so heavily concentrated with sugar, to the point where it's not enjoyable anymore. That's not my music style. It's peak wedding-core, which is just a genre I do not like. I mean on the one hand it's not drowned in AutoTune like most of the songs in 2009 were. I'll just be glad to never hear this again.

**vapourlomo** (3): This song reminds me of every white "rastafarian" that I knew in high school.

**radiofan15** (1): Wakanda shit is this?

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (0): this might be my least favorite song of all time. it's tied with that Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes song they played at every wedding from 2009-2013. there's just something about that forced whimsy that I find incredibly grating

**ExtraEater**: It's a young former reality show contestant's minor hit, and it's as decent as I'd expect it to be based on that fact. The hook's fine and the production is predictably basic. Overall, I'm not too affected by any of this. Nice and passable, at the least.

**ImADudeDuh**: Who? Taking the trend of obvious samples from classics, Goodbye samples Goodbye from Steam, a 1960's rock band song. This song really uses the sample for basically the entire song, but Kristina still brings the attitude from the original here! I don't even know her ex but I still want to go to his twitter and block his ass! It's just a fun single girl anthem that isn't trying to do much, and it succeeds at that.

---
#Good

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**gannade** (10): kristina debarge was about to fulfill the pop girl prophecy until rat nose gaga stole her sheet music

**pearllouise** (10): Kristinia DeBarge: the pop girl we didn't deserve

**jamesfog** (9.5): NANANANA. NANANANA. HEY HEY HEY. GOODBYE! :yasssss:

**Mysario** (9.5): I hadn't heard this song until last month when my friend told me this is the only reason she knew the "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Em Goodbye" tune and it surprisingly holds up

**kappyko** (9): takes guts to interpolate a classic sports anthem for instant familiarity but over the best throbbing dance beats all is forgiven

**ManofOranges** (9): The sample for this song caught me off guard but that doesn't change the fact that this song is amazing

**Roxieloxie** (9): the chorus slaps

**1998tweety** (8.5): a mega bop

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I literally had no idea this was a petty sporting chant before I heard this song. I also forgot how great this song was, it's way better than I remember it being! You can tell it's very of its time, however that actually somewhat works to its advantage. And lastly, the music video's Venetian locale is another huge selling point for me since it's one of my favorite places I've travelled to.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): why does she kinda look like selena gomez if i don't look at her at all

**enecks** (7): oops a bop

#bye

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): wale did the sample better tbh

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): if you’ve even listened to one track off Britney Spears’ 2008 comeback album, Circus, you will realize at once what the people who made this song were planning to profit on. Seeing as this ended up at #95 on the Year-End, I am forced to question if their plans work. Kristina DeBarge, one-time alumnus of a forgotten teenage American Idol spinoff that happens to be related to a weird number of historical figures, is perhaps a little too unconvincing of a singer to brag about ‘single girl swag’, but my sheer incredulity that Goodbye exists is enough to make me forgive it.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is the greatest use of sampling in modern recording history

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Somehow I’ve literally never heard this song

**ReallyCreative** (6.1): It was a great song until you realize the chorus is just a rip-off lmao

**MashLuke** (6): this is a Phineas and Ferb song

**mms82** (6): I wanna meet a DeBarge stan

**frogaranaman** (5): This is trying to appropriate straight white sports fan culture for the gays.

**ggodisawomann** (5): another song I forgot existed, wow

**MrSwearword** (5): a weird case of "has some talent but got a bad song to work with"

**waluigiest** (5): okay

**xxrandooxx** (5): Completely forgot this song existed

**nightjesus** (4.5): Futre Love is better

**imasalesman** (4): um?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): This is the most forced pop career I’ve ever seen. They really thought this girl was gonna be a thing, huh?

**radiofan15** (3.5): Poor girl she really tried but failed... not as much as Ava Max failed to create a followup worthy of her undeserved hype, but failure is failure

**rslashpoopheads** (3): lul

**vapourlomo** (3): Lol this sampling is so terrible that I wouldn't be shocked if Flo Rida ghost wrote it

**ryjomom** (2): Wow, what a career

**ariannagrandtitties** (1.4): i wish i forgot this song existed

**Tchalla1966** (1): how in gods name did this even sell

**ExtraEater**: I was completely unaware of how big this was (I was completely unaware of it, period), but I'm impressed with what I hear. This charted high in the adult contemporary chart, and this is basically an ideal for the chart from what I can tell. We need more pop rock like this.

**ImADudeDuh**: First of all, fucking stream Smooth by Santana and Rob Thomas, one of the greatest songs ever. Second, this song is good! This has some of the strangest production choices in the rate. Having a triangle(?) be the foundation of the beat until the chorus is just an odd choice. The song being about a troubled young woman seems like a very familiar theme from the lead singer of Matchbox 20... The song itself is still good though.

**mms82** (10): wow I figured this song was like 30 years old but its so good

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop!!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Don't @ me

**selegend** (10): my cishet white king

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): maybe he snapped

**Mysario** (9): this is good but it's not as good as Grammy Award-Winning song "Smooth" by Santana ft. Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): this fucking sub better respect rob fucking thomas i swear to god

**fishingfor8** (8): never heard this in my life

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Heard this song a ton when I was younger but had no clue it was Rob Thomas.

**jamesfog** (8): I liked this song when I was younger so-

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The most baffling thing about this song is that it’s dad rock in 2009. It’s not even *that* kind of dad rock that straight dudes used to play a little less than a decade ago. It sounds like a rock ballad straight out of the 80s, complete with dated production and raspy vocals from the guy who sang on Smooth. I have no idea what it’s doing in this rate, and I feel guilty for acknowledging the fact that it actually sounds good. Apparently, it’s also about Thomas’s wife’s illness? I think that might actually be what makes me like it as a song. Yeah, it sounds like it belongs in some parodical Youtube video, but at least there’s sincerity here, I suppose? Whatever. I’m giving it a good score. Case closed.

**tapdancingpig** (8): WHO IS THAT AMAZING BACKING SINGER!?

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Honestly I remember liking this at the time and I’m surprised that I still do. The chorus vocals on the hook actually add a really nice sonic element to the track.

**ryjomom** (7.5): I love songs that reference Rihanna’s 2012 hit Diamonds

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): oooooohhh this song. It’s ok

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): one of the few songs that escaped me until years later i heard it on sirius xm the pulse, a mild bop

#[Cry all you want](https://pics.me.me/cry-all-you-f-ckin-want-your-tears-dont-mean-39105525.png)

**twat\_brained** (7.3): meh, I prefer the Veronica Mars showrunner. Second, I prefer Rihanna's "Diamonds". Finally, I prefer Matchbox Twenty, at least Rob knew what he was doing and he didn't sound as pretentious to me.

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): It's alright but doesn't interest me too much

**MrSwearword** (7): vocally I forgot this song but the video is well done and was like on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown for like a solid month.

**pearllouise** (7): Rihanna did it better

**radiofan15** (6.2): This isn't Smooth!

**frogaranaman** (6): This is the greatest song that I never remember the melody to.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): cute song

**enecks** (5): H D

**waluigiest** (5): idk

**xxrandooxx** (4.6): Wish they were my diamonds

**kappyko** (4.5): the percussive first 30 seconds is beautiful... then it becomes hokey pop rock complete with choir girls for "soul". fine i guess

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): meh.

**ariannagrandtitties** (3): eh

**ExtraEater**: I could not name one thing special or remarkable about this song, and considering how weird and bizarrely fun the rest of this Billboard Year-End is it's honestly a little out of place. I guess being the one song without a quirk gives it a quirk just for that, huh? This is a pretty sweet and decently catchy song, but there's a reason why conflict makes for exciting stories, and y'know a song that kinda just sits there with mediocre instrumentals while also telling a story that really seems to contain a half-resolved, half-assed conflict isn't going to do much for me. It’s still solid, though.

**ImADudeDuh**: Mad was definitely the lesser of the 2 solo hits Ne-Yo had this year. The song is trying to break up the tension of arguments between a couple. The song definitely is an emotional pleed to both go back in love with each other, helped by Ne-Yo's great vocals and great vocal layering. Also, the video really tried it with having a kid get hit by a car in an attempt to make this seem deeper than it truly is. 

---
**gannade** (10): omfg this forgotten bop. Ugh neyo and his hairline may have faded but this is a forever bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Ne-Yo has some genuinely great songs in his discography and they deserve to be acknowledged.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Mad atchoo

**MashLuke** (9): his voice is too good

**Roxieloxie** (9): it's no So Sick but a bop is a bop

**1998tweety** (8.8): This is kinda nice

**jamesfog** (8.5): I always liked this song :sad:

**radiofan15** (8.2): God I miss Ne-Yo on the charts... and by Ne-Yo I mean R&B crooners with a golden voice who aren't pieces of shit

**kappyko** (8): i love u ne yo u gentleman

**rslashpoopheads** (8): My boy.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Nice but forgettable

**ryjomom** (7.5): not as dated as the rest of these songs from 2009

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is honestly better than Miss Independent but that song is much better remembered for some reason

**enecks** (7): smooth enough

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is the Ne-Yo song I like the least on this Year-End. It’s not bad, mind you, but Ne-Yo’s voice shifts a bit awkwardly during the ‘mad at you/mad at me’ parts on its chorus, and it has the same problem as We Belong Together; essentially, it’s not much more than your typical urban radio fair as a ballad released in the 00s. Apparently its video is really cool, though.

**ReallyCreative** (7): It's kinda sweet and cool but it's also kinda boring

**twat\_brained** (7): wait this man had hits this year that weren't Miss Independent or Knock You Down? Where Birthday Sex is just thrift store Usher, this genuinely sounds like something Usher passed up on and Ne-Yo kept for himself. Not that it does much for me

**waluigiest** (7): when I was young and stupid I thought this song said “I don’t wanna go to Maine mad at you”

**ExtraEater**: Yeah, I prefer the stronger AMV-core Transformers-affiliated "What I've Done" over this, but hey a re-hash of a good song still produces an at least decent song about 70% of the time, as you can see here. I think as a theme song for a Transformers movie directed by Michael Bay, Linkin Park nailed it here (interpret that as you may). Futuristic and gritty here we go.

**ImADudeDuh**: First of all, R.I.P. Chester. Your music will always be one of the best outlets for some people going through hard times. This song however, just feels empty of any truly deeper meaning. Which, for a Michael Bay Transformers movie, is extremely fitting. I wish there was something more in this song than just angry vocals. It feels like you put all of Linkin Park's best stuff in a blender and blended it so it's all one gross beige color that loses what made all of it so great in the first place.

#Ended G\*nger S\*t\*n

**izeasklapaucius** (10): the melody is a perfection.

**skargardin** (10): Middle school me is shaking

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this makes me so sad to hear now :(

**Mysario** (9.5): the best thing to come out of the Transformer live-action movies

**radiofan15** (9.2): Such a great BOP wasted on such a mediocre movie

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I love this song even though it comes from the Transformers movie

**ManofOranges** (9): I never really vibed with the whole Transformers aesthetic and the general mood of those movies but for some reason I really like the songs from the soundtrack and this song is no exception

**moooo566** (9): the first couple of transformers films were fun, dont @ me

**1998tweety** (8.8): Emo bop

**jamesfog** (8.5): Oop bop. :rip:

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Okay this is definitely gonna be low but I still like it! For some reason Linkin Park always gave really good songs to the Transformers movies, like it’s angsty but I like some of the more subtle poppy/electronica elements as opposed to their later attempts at that crossover. Revenge of the Fallen is still pretty terrible though

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Didn't like that weird breakdown before the bridge but this was one of my preferred LP songs; it's just harder to stomach knowing Chester is no longer with us. Hybrid Theory is gonna fuck me up in the rock bands rate

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Maybe emos have some taste.

**mich4725** (7): not that good for LP, but still decent

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I feel like it’s obligatory to say this, but, rest in peace, Chester. Linkin Park is never going to be my kind of thing, but they were good for their time, and much like how the band’s been seen as the only good thing to come out of nu metal recently, I’m pretty sure that this song is the only good thing to come out of Transformers. That’s a little wonder that I’m deeply grateful for.

**ReallyCreative** (7): Hardly a classic Linkin Park song imo but it's not bad at all

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): transformersheads are shaking

#I didn't go to fucking school for math

**MrSwearword** (6): it's fine but this doesn't hold up

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): It’s fine.

**waluigiest** (6): oh you EDGY edgy?

**frogaranaman** (5): I was straight and complaining about how my mom needs to stop cheating on my dad as he drinks himself into alcoholic oblivion for four minutes and twenty-nine seconds.

**pearllouise** (5): I feel like I heard this at Hot Topic one time

**Awhile2** (4): transformers was my most hyped movie but it wasnt enough to get me to like a linkin park song

**enecks** (4): Such a shame we couldn't get the good shit on the charts

**NotWith10000Men** (4): generic rock song. Rating it this high just because I really like rock

**TragicKingdom1** (4): not my cup of tea. also this song is identical to Burn It Down

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.9): grateful for the great divide between 2009 and now

**kappyko** (3.5): i get the appeal but this really is far from what i enjoy. i miss this era of transformers a lot though.

**ryjomom** (2.5): this is from the transformers movie……...

**CopyCatJ** (2): I'm glad mainstream rock died tbh

**mms82** (1): ugh how did this group get so low in the late 2000s from there early 2000s and late 2010s peaks

**ExtraEater**: The #1 charting single for 2009, and it really does deserve it—not more than the total good time that is I Gotta Feeling, but I digress. I like dumb pop rap, but Boom Boom Pow is next level (visual shit), because it’s basically worshipping the future in the most embarrassing way. One of my favorite things about this is that cold droning noise that introduces the song and randomly appears throughout. It’s basically a big atmospheric device that honestly kinda works, although if we’re talking future vibes, this ain’t it. With that intro, never has a song been so instantly able to transport you to the warped visions of what the future would be like in the late 2000s. Mocking this song for getting the future wrong would do it a disservice as the time capsule that it really is. We can’t forget the iconic stupid lyric, “I’m so three thousand and eight, you’re so two thousand late.” Next level musical shit.

**ImADudeDuh**: The Black Eyed Peas are pretty iconic. My mom had a CD of theirs and would play it in our car on our way to 2nd grade. But even all that good nostalgia can not convince me this song is that good. Outside of the iconic line "You're so 3000-late," this song doesn't do much except be a time capsule to how we thought futuristic music would be.

---

#Three thousand and eight

**bespectacIed** (10): True, the lyrics are bad then and laughable now. The line "You're so 3008 and late" is so cringey and has aged less than the song itself, but this song (and the The E.N.D. album) is such an iconic yet overlooked landmark in pop music. BEP is the first act that the GP embraced in the late 2000s EDM boom, not Gaga, because Gaga blew up immediately after this. Giving this a 10 because I genuinely bopped to this 10 years ago and this song birthed all y'all EDM faves

**MrSwearword** (10): can't wait for this to bomb out within the bottom five but fuck y'all I live for this song

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Tchalla1966** (10): iconic as fuck for one reason only, see y'all in 3000late.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Like most of my favorite Black Eyes Peas songs, I’m right on the line of ironically and unironically enjoying this. It’s unquestionably dated and the lyrics are very, very corny, but I won’t pretend I don’t know every line of this song. It’s such a beautifully weird track and a perfect time capsule of 2009 music that I can’t not love it.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): like idk if this whole rate is going to be 10s 10s 9s across the board because of nostalgia, but this song is wack and it slaps, sue me

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This is such a dumb song but it’s just so catchy and fun. Can’t believe it was the #1 song of the year though.

**MashLuke** (9): 2000's and great

**mms82** (9): such a late 2000s song but holds up

**radiofan15** (9): will.i.am invented lyricism, Fergie did the same with time travelling... Bob Dylan and Skynet could never

**twat\_brained** (8.9): I love how this was the "peak" of electronic music in 2009. It's hilarious looking back on it how this was the first song out in the year-end #1s rate. Also, there are so many non-sequiturs it's actually somewhat hilarious. Not to mention Fergie's extra try-hard vocals following apl.de.ap's verse. This is so brilliantly dated I actually kinda like it for what it is. Boom Boom Pow is definitely a bad song, but it's a bad song with more replay value than you might think. It might still even liven up parties for all we know.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is iconic but it gets a bit annoying near the end.

**Mysario** (8.5): who's 2000 and late now

**ggodisawomann** (8): so catchy but if I listen to it too often I get sick of it oops

**jamesfog** (8): Overhated

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I used to ironically like this but as always my stupid ass ended up unironically liking it. Fergie's chorus/bridge are legendary.

**waluigiest** (8): I’m in a hard place right here because I was in middle school in 2009 and the black eyed peas were my absolute favorite band. This song is complete nonsense but it somehow slaps. Bonus points for giving us “you’re so 2000 and late”

**wholesomebody** (8): its so 3008

**kappyko** (8): just paste in my jukebox review insteado f this comment please

^ *[Editor's Note: lmao]*

**pearllouise** (7.5): Got a Kit-Kat

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): somebody whip up that video from important videos playlist where this song got bassboosted and shooketh the whole bedroom.

**\_wailordfan** (7): Fun fact: This is the first song I **ever** had on my cheap $25 MP3 player, my mom and I sat down and learned how to illegally download songs online, and we found this, White Horse by Taylor Swift, and Vivaldi's Autumn. You could say my taste in music was exquisite

**gannade** (7): you’re so 2000 and LATE! Is an iconic line

**moooo566** (7): i still like the black eyed peas

#2000 and Late

**Roxieloxie** (7): I guess im 2000 and late cause this is just okay.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): ok as boring and generic as this song is, “I’m so 3008 you’re so 2000 and late” is iconic

**vapourlomo** (7): This song is objectively terrible, but when I was 14, it was a total banger. Hence, I'll always kind of love it for nostalgic reasons.

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.7): fun and funky but wtf is up with the end??

**imasalesman** (6): eh

**ManofOranges** (6): I will never forgive this song for the endless amount of times that kids I hated in 2nd grade called me two-thousand-and-late

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): not bad but like boring???

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): Actually, I used to hate this as much as I Gotta Feeling, but now that I’m listening to again I actually find it kind of okay. Maybe I’m just used to it not being as overplayed as I Gotta Feeling’s been since my childhood, or maybe I just prefer it to loads of other stuff in this rate. I still don’t like Boom Boom Pow, but as a stadium kind of song with a crowd surrounding the music being played, it’s not particularly *bad*.  I’m still upset over Poker Face not getting #1, though.

**selegend** (5): eh it’s terrible but it’s iconic now

**TragicKingdom1** (5): it's surreal that this song exists but i don't think i will ever feel the desire to listen to it again

**enecks** (4): If I was using my critical thinking, this would get a 0. That drone in the background is legitimately headache inducing. But the meme of the loud speakers vibrating had this and that makes me laugh hard.

**frogaranaman** (4): Fergie really 3008’d us into oblivion with this banger. 😪🤘🏼

**NotWith10000Men** (3): fun bop I guess but ive never been a peas fan

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): I haaaaaated this song back then, but it grew on me a little. It still sucks.

**ryjomom** (2.5): The auto-tune, lyrics, and beat has aged like USDA grade A cow milk.

**fishingfor8** (2): Wow this is outdated

**hikkaru** (2): this song is the definition of 2000 and late

**mich4725** (2): catchy phrase and that's all. Song is a bad mess.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): This is one of the dumbest songs I’ve ever heard, but it’s dumb in a new way so it gets a point for that at least

**xxrandooxx** (2): In hindsight the fact that this song exists is unbelievable, but I remember hearing this song for the first time and being shook.

**ReallyCreative** (1.2): I don't know of a song that has aged worse. It was pretty bad in 2009, but it's a true (and I don't use this term often) cringefest looking back on it now

**jval888** (1): made me cringe then makes me cringe even more now

**Plasm\_Trojan** (1): How this was above I Gotta Feeling on the year end list confuses me to this day.

**tapdancingpig** (0): I remembered liking this... how?

**ExtraEater**: Mr. 305’s breakthrough hit with all the same flair as his future efforts in pop, just with less EDM. The horn sample is kind of a really good recurring fanfare that hooks me into the song and into that great chorus. I’m mostly indifferent to the rapping, but I like the energy: The pronounced ROOMBAs, the way his tone gets all playful at some point during one of the Spanish parts, etc. This was destined to leave early, but it continues to entertain us and partially encourage drunken reddit posts (I can only name one, but it was a good one).

**ImADudeDuh**: Pitbull Sweetie, I am so motherfucking sorry that these people don't know how truly amazing you are! Going to a mostly Mexican middle school, you can imagine everyone knew the words to this by heart. This song is very basic, but pitbull still is just a charismatic guy to me. The lyrics are not good, in fact, they are actively bad. From the extremely repetitive chorus, to comparing himself to biggie and tupac, to saying Al*bert* Hitchcock instead of Al*fred* Hitchcock. Maybe this song is mostly nostalgia, but I'm sorry this just brings back fun memories as well as being fun to this day.

#I Know You Have Taste

**1998tweety** (10): Pitbull iconic kingie

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): since you all know how i feel about mr bull's discography, i have to share my friend's commentary, which is that pitbull looks like a human penis.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A FUCKING BOP

**Mysario** (10): Pitbull exclusively makes bops

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**poppinmmolly** (10): BIG bop

**radiofan15** (10): EVERYONE STAND UP FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM

**ggodisawomann** (9.5): wow I love Pitbull

**mich4725** (9): say what you want but this was a bop and actually aged well, still rocks at parties

**moooo566** (9): DALE

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): wow the OG pitbull song imagine a time where he was new and exciting what a world

**Awhile2** (8): “Got her in the cockpit playin' with Pit's” i now just got this lyric and have come to the conclusion that pitbull is a top tier lyricist

**twat\_brained** (7.7): i'm gonna use "ass like a donkey" as my newest pickup line, I'll report the results. I find it humorous how this song is trying to masquerade as this party anthem, but Pitbull just sounds so dull and he looks bored out of his mind in the music video with the women he's objectifying; it literally offers me no sexual energy whatsoever lol. I don't want Pitbull himself, just more enthusiasm. We do need Pitbull back on the charts though, as u/gowestyoungkanye can attest.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): I love that little horn sample more than anything else in this song

**enecks** (7): Oops this is a bop

**MashLuke** (7): nice but the fun kind of nice

**MrSwearword** (7): I mean Pitbull's quality went downhill fast long after this track showed off all his tricks by then but it's cute for what it is (a song that sounds like Pai's stage in Virtua Fighter 4)

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): guilty pleasure

**vapourlomo** (7): DALE!

**waluigiest** (7): pitbull is doing this. Structure is not good

**rickikardashian** (6.7): A BOP. This dominated my country back in the day. That being said, this a 1 minute demo being looped a thousand times

**jval888** (6.5): still fun not pretentious

#I know you want a DNA test

**izeasklapaucius** (10): D-Dad?

#These people said "Build that wall!"

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I know everybody likes Pitbull because everybody likes having fun, and I’m not going to deny that his kind of music is something we need as we all slowly sink into the void, so I don’t blame people for having fond memories of this song. It’s just not my thing at all. Also, props to Pitbull for promoting safe sex, but the condom line kind of makes me wanna choke.

**ryjomom** (6): invented ROOMBA vacuums

**tapdancingpig** (6): This isn’t bad, but it’s not the kind of trashy fun I want from Pitbull. He’s shown us that he can’t be *good,* but he can be fun. This just isn’t fun enough.

**jamesfog** (5.8): 1 2 3 4 Uno dos tres cuatro is all I remember of this middling song

**ManofOranges** (5): And I thought Charli was repetitive

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): The birth of Party Pitbull is...ok.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I heard this song approximately once every 30 minutes over the summer.

**frogaranaman** (4): Pitbull ended toxic masculinity by admitting "damn, he’s hot" when no one else would.

**xxrandooxx** (4): Memorable yes… for the right reasons…. no

**ariannagrandtitties** (3): pitbull, no one wants ur fucking baldass self

**selegend** (3): gives me a hernia

**Plasm\_Trojan** (2.1): I know this is really bad but it gets extra points for being fucking hilarious (probably unintentionally).

**TragicKingdom1** (2): EXTREMELY repetitive especially in the production which is v grating !

**NotWith10000Men** (1): pitbull annoys the shit out of me

**pearllouise** (1): no I don't

**ExtraEater**: It's pretty obligatory to say that Lady Antebellum did in fact produce some remote hits beyond "Need You Now", which would be a big hit in the 2010 year-end chart just next year. This song is pretty sweet and nice. Not to mention, the lyrics are kinda relevant to today, eh? Always remember the ones you love, folks, even in the midst of chaos.

**ImADudeDuh**: The biggest country song not by Taylor Swift in this rate, and it's not that surprising that it was. This was the only country song by a woman to make it in this rate, plus Lady Antebellum are still known for their modern classic, Need You Now. Hilary and Charles have some great harmonies together, and the song is real cute! In the midst of how shit the world is, sometimes love is all we have.

#This record keeps spinning faster

**bespectacIed** (10): My absolute favorite Lady Antebellum song. Sorry Kacey, but they're the OG guilty pleasure of country haters.

**ManofOranges** (10): Lady Antebellum is literally a country icon and no one can say anything else. Stream Need You Now for clear skin and salvation.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this group harmonizes so well

**ryjomom** (10): The Serotonin

**1998tweety** (9.4): this is nice

**jamesfog** (9): Country classic :yashaw:

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): amazingly, need you now was not their first hit! this is a bop btw

**ggodisawomann** (8): I shouldn't like this as much as I do tbh

**pearllouise** (8): I don't know why but I lowkey bop to this white mom song

**ReallyCreative** (8): I have a soft spot for Lady Antebellum, I think their duets are pretty great

**waluigiest** (8): this is the country we needed

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I will say this: Lady Antebellum sound head and shoulders above their country cohorts on this chart.

**enecks** (7): Nearly there, nearly there to Need You Now

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): okay i kinda like this ballad, wow

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I dig this

**Roxieloxie** (7): it's a cute dancy song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): they really snapped with the /r/collapse chorus

#Why are you running? WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?

**CarlieScion** (6): wait lady antebellum has non-need you now songs?

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I’m shocked that Lady Antebellum had a hit other than Need You Now. I’ve been warming up to that one in recent times, but it’s hard for me to figure how I could warm up to a song as boring as I Run To You. There’s nothing much to say about it in favour of sleeping through the entire song instead. It’s here where you lament the fact that the country in this rate is mostly mediocre, with Taylor being the big standout.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): Need You Now did it better

**frogaranaman** (5): Yeehaw. 🤠 [4]

**radiofan15** (4.8): This isn't Need You Now!

**xxrandooxx** (4.8): My dog when I got off the bus.

**ariannagrandtitties** (4): i dont run

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): more like i'm going to run to a good song

**ExtraEater**: Well, there's no compelling narrative core like in "You Found Me", nor does it really hit me hard as "How to Save a Life", but the Fray's other hit is pretty nice after you've worn out those two and want to hear something relatively fresh from the band. The "don't let me go" and "never say never" hooks are quite nice, that guitar(?) solo at the end is great, and for being another emotional Fray ballad it still resonates as something beyond emotional wallpaper. Also, it's the last song in the standard rate, and it's kinda crazy thinking about how far I am in time from when I first listened to "Boom Boom Pow" down to where I am now. Anyway, good song.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song really surprises me with how high it got. In my opinion, it seems to be a generic (mostly) piano ballad. I feel like the minimal production in here highlights more of the problems with Mr. Fray's voice, especially his falsetto, which I did not like at all. I would say this is at least better than Justin Bieber's Never Say Never, but i don't even know if it is.

#Always say Always

**1998tweety** (10): a very good song to finish this rate with

**fishingfor8** (10): The Fray is a 10 out of 10 all the time

**ggodisawomann** (10): me, looking out the windows of my mom's car in the rain, acting out my own version of a music video for this song

**MashLuke** (10): perfect

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**strawberryswing1** (10): 😭

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Y’all really saved the best for last in this rate

**kappyko** (9.5): criticize pop girls all you like for so called hipster voices but dont forget to criticize the shitty post-grunge drawls of these alt roc wait fuck i like this song. vocal performances kinda serve the musical with glen hansard

**bespectacIed** (9): It's easier to count how many tv shows that DIDN'T use this song

**vapourlomo** (9): I was such a big sucker for these emo piano ballads during my junior high years.

**Mysario** (8.5): not as good as "You Found Me"

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): this song is in The Vampire Diaries which is another source of nostalgia for me so this is just a double whammy of a song.

**jamesfog** (8): Oh this cute bop. Whatever happened to them.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Some critic on this song’s Wikipedia page accused the Fray of copying a CCM-style formula in the sense of making a songs attempting to strike up poignant feelings in their listeners without going anywhere interesting musically thematically at all, and I’m not sure I disagree, but the real tea here is that in a decade swamped with indistinguishable alternative rock bands that ended up having little to no influence in the years to come, the Fray are some of the most bearable relics of the genre’s last stand. Never Say Never isn’t a great triumph or anything, but it has more cohesion than a lot of songs in this rate, and I’m willing to give it a merciful score.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): better dramatic swell than You Found Me

**pearllouise** (7): Outsold Justin Bieber

**ReallyCreative** (7): It's aight

#I will never say "play that song again"

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): It’s ok.

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.3): is he even saying words?

**frogaranaman** (4): What the fuck ever.

**MrSwearword** (4): dramatic but fails to have me like it

**twat\_brained** (4): Why wasn't this called "Don't Let Me Go"? Also why are The Fray aggressively white and heterosexual? And why is this on the Year-End Hot 100 in favor of more deserving songs like Evacuate the Dancefloor? This song is a slog and a half, let's leave The Fray in the 2000s.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): its not how to save a life

**ryjomom** (3): Put me to sleep, but not in a good way.

**waluigiest** (3): I’m gonna let you go!!!

**enecks** (1): Fuck off The Fray

**radiofan15** (1): I fucking hate his voice... also Justin and James Bond outsold

**ExtraEater**: The chorus makes the song, but I grew to somewhat enjoy the rap verses over time. As much as I like this, I struggle to see it as anything else but a vessel for a fantastic JT appearance. Justin’s “I turn my head to the east” bridge is wonderful, and the piano/violin flourishes beneath T.I. give the song some extra life. As far as “songs with rappers proudly announcing their redemption and casting away their old demons while featuring a passionate guest singer to do the iconic chorus” goes, I much prefer Diddy's “Coming Home”.

**ImADudeDuh**: Just like every other pop fan, I remember this song more for the amazing hook by JT than the actual rap parts. I don't know much of TI but his rapping skills are honestly a lot better than I realized. I would give this a better score but I feel like the bridge comes way out of no where and the production really takes away from some of the power of the song. It's weird to have a song about personal realizations with a timbaland club banging beat behind it.

---
#T.I. and JT made a B-O-P

**CopyCatJ** (10): the old Justin can't come to the phone Why? He's dead and gone 😭😭😭

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Tchalla1966** (10): underrated BOP

**Awhile2** (9): 2007-2009 was peak pop rap by far

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Justin’s hook is fantastic and T.I’s verses are pretty good. What even happened to TI?

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I used to have a bias against Justin Timberlake and now that that’s fading, I’m grateful that I’m able to comprehend how good this song is. I mean, come on, how have I not heard of it before? It’s another pretty great collaboration between Justin and a hip hop artist and the production behind Dead and Gone sounds much more appealing to me than a lot of stuff from his FSLS (don’t shoot me). I’d call this an underrated favourite on 2009’s Year-End.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): In the current Can’t Stop the Feeling/Man of the Woods era, I really miss when Justin Timberlake was just untouchable in terms of quality. His hook on this song is just killer, definitely one of his best. T.I. holds his own too, with some strong, personal verses that build well to JT. I really did forget how much nostalgia I had for the FutureSex/LoveSounds era.

**1998tweety** (8.7): XXX: The Song

**ManofOranges** (8.5): Profound bop

**frogaranaman** (8): _sees Justin Timberlake in the title_ \*sweating\* Do the mens rate.

**MashLuke** (8): neat

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I really dig the vibe of this son, it feels genuine and that goes a long way.

**wholesomebody** (8): guilty pleasure

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): I honestly forgot about this song but thinking of it brings back fond memories

**enecks** (7): This is edgy nonsense that is well produced.

**moooo566** (7): i forgot this song existed

**NotWith10000Men** (7): pop feature in a rap song sounds very 2009 but I prefer it to the other way around

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): i remember my mum really liking this song for some reason, even though this is totally not her type of music

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): where is T.I.? please come back

**waluigiest** (7): weird intense sound in a mostly good way. Emotional but some of the rapping is eh

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): RIP XXXTENTATIVE

#Meh of the Woods

**twat\_brained** (6.4): I'm sorry, the old T.I. can't come to the phone right now. Looking back, this song doesn't feel all that genuine and I'm pretty glad we all collectively left this in our rearview mirror. Then again T.I gave us Iggy Azalea and he was pretty good in both Ant-Man films so I'm happy to leave his music in the 2000s in honor of his other 2010s ventures

**radiofan15** (6.2): And people dare to say JT is mediocre... he alone saves this overlong mess from being way worse than it could have been

**MrSwearword** (6): if not for the fact DJ Earworm made this work in the mashup, this song is just forgettable as fuck

**Plasm\_Trojan** (6): Although not awful, it sounds extremely dated.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): i used to dislike this more but i can acknowledge that it's catchy now, T.I. kinda sucks on it though and it's way too long for what it is

**rslashpoopheads** (5): MIDI TRUMPETS DOOT DOOT

**selegend** (5): loved jt’s chorus

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): tbh I just never liked this

**vapourlomo** (5): I miss lots of things about the late '00s/early '10s pop scene, but you know what I don't miss? The overblown hip-hop sellout ballad with a pop chorus.

**fishingfor8** (4): This is soooooo boring

**jval888** (4): sounds like discount lonely island now hard to take it seriously

**pearllouise** (4): Title best represents JT's career

**ReallyCreative** (4): Never been a fan of T.I., even less of a fan of the production of this song. JT's vocals are weird here, and not in a good way.

**xxrandooxx** (4): I feel like all these songs sound the same

**ryjomom** (1.2): This is my first time listening to this, as well as my last.

**kappyko** (1): always found this whiny... i get that t.i. is the primary artist and is very well respected (a discussion that can be more fruitful than that but i dont have the time or knowledge) but it's weird how much he kind of disappears on these tracks. jt is stupid

**ExtraEater**: Imogen Heap deserves the coin, the Imogen Heap song is honestly better (if less of a bop), but hey hey this song is still great. Is there anything else remarkable about this song that I can write of it other than the Imogen Heap stuff? Honestly, no, and I would mention the SNL Dear Sister skit if not for the fact that that's a lot more about the Imogen Heap sample than the Jason Derulo song. Thanks for checking out my writeup be sure to hit like and subscribe xoxo.

**ImADudeDuh**: How wild is it that not only was THIS Jason's debut single, but it also went to number one? First of all, yet another obvious sample is here! This time it's Imogen Heap's Hide and Seek, a song which I am in the very small minority of not liking. I am just not a fan of people using autotune to deep songs! I unironically like the autotune on Whatcha Say more than on Hide and Seek. At least on this song, there's less long syllables that make the autotune the forefront of the song. That being said, this is still a "JaSoN dErUlOoooOo" song, so the production is not great, but I still find myself entrapped by the chorus. Sorry, but I do prefer this more than the original!

---
#Jäšøñ Dęrūłœ

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic bop, JD a king of pop and no one can say otherwise.

**Awhile2** (10): the highlight of jason derulos musical career is a chorus thats not even his

**ggodisawomann** (10): Jason served then and he continues to serve now

**MashLuke** (10): the sample did it but its a nice song anyway

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**PuggleMaster** (10): when i was little i thought the sample was that TATU song ajfkl;dsajmfknvna

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCgFuREydRM

**bespectacIed** (9): I heard this wayyy before I've heard imogen's ... electric chair. Still a great song tho

**frogaranaman** (9): Dear sister, by the time that you are reading this, I will be dead. This is how I think it's gunna happen. Dave will shoot me, then I'll shoot Dave, then Eric will enter then get shot by Dave, then you will walk in and get shot by Dave, Eric, and me multiple times. Love, your brother Keith. P.S. Then, two cops will read this letter then shoot each other.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song was one of the first instances that I learned that sampling was a thing in music. It’s one of the most memorable sampled songs out there!

**Mysario** (9): SNL ruined this sample for me

**waluigiest** (9): the start of his dynasty. The Imogen heap sample changed a generation

**jamesfog** (8.5): This song made Imogen Heap more popular, gave her coint and was a dated bop. yas

**ManofOranges** (8.5): I can see why people would hate this song and I feel like the sample of Hide and Seek can be considered egregious but for me it just works

**fishingfor8** (8): best part of the song is the part where Jason Derulo isnt in it

**MrSwearword** (8): I don't wanna say he peaked with this...but I mean...

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): Jason DeRulo has so many bangers

**TragicKingdom1** (8): honestly has a great sample and chorus despite being very ridiculous

**jval888** (7): snl made this a classic

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I may have regarded this as a simple but fun RnB hit that I could enjoy listening to every now and then if it weren’t for me actually paying attention to the lyrics. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still eternally grateful for all the memes everything else about  Watcha Say has blessed us with, but Jason comes off as incredibly self-serving and unconvincing in this song’s storyline; it irks me that his character within the lyrics’ contexts seems to be too entitled to acknowledge the consequences of him cheating. Oh, well, I’m not about to debate over Jason Derulo.

**radiofan15** (7): Ah, I see Jason DeRulo, future Oscar winner for his role in Cats, is also as fan of The O.C.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Imogen Heap is so powerful.

#Dear sister, by the time you read this, I'll give this my 0

**Tchalla1966** (7): I liked this song once but it somehow bores me greatly but its still a GOOD song

**gannade** (6.5): jason derulo thinks hes the next mj but looks like wayne brady

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): did imogen heap deserve this

**NotWith10000Men** (6): chorus is amazing, jason's verses annoy me

**Roxieloxie** (6): [You already know what this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmd1qMN5Yo0)

**tapdancingpig** (6): I like that vocoded female hook, but... everything else is just meh.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): Can I just link that video of Drake getting shot on Degrassi and call it a day

**vapourlomo** (6): Objectively bad song that I can't give lower than a 6 due to it being a massive nostalgia bomb.

**enecks** (5): I wanted to give this a 10 and a 0. So I compromised and gave a 5. This is the best worst song.

**izeasklapaucius** (5): Only worth it cause of the Iomgen Heap sample.

**ryjomom** (5): MmMmm WhaTCHha SaAaaAYyyy

**selegend** (5): how do you sample imogen heap for a chorus then not credit her as a feature

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5): the only good part of this is the imogen heap sample. But of course hide and seek is an infinitely better song

**Plasm\_Trojan** (4.6): Only listenable due to the Imogen Heap sample.

**kappyko** (4.5): It's weird how effectively he lifts from "Hide and Seek", transforming the original ethereal bridge into a choir of auto-tuned R&B girls with just a simple pitch-shift. In this grandiose context, with slamming drums and horns, it becomes a sweet pop song that admittedly could benefit from a little less of everything.

**skargardin** (4.5): God I haven't even liked a single one of the songs I haven't heard of before this rate so far..

**ariannagrandtitties** (4): good for the memes, but not much else

**twat\_brained** (4): next time someone tells me Ariana ruined "Goodnight 'n Go" they deserve to be reminded of Jason's desecration of another Imogen classic. God, that autotuned falsetto is beyond grating. Besides, this completely undoes the message Imogen was going for with "Hide and Seek"! There are worse debut singles, but it doesn't get much worse than Jason's. Thankfully Ava Max is out here raising his tolerability levels, at least

**xxrandooxx** (4): Catchy Chorus

**moooo566** (3): did imogen heap heap really deserve this

**wholesomebody** (3): id always rather listen to imogen heap

**ReallyCreative** (2): I don't know whether to give this song a bad score because it fucking sucks and Jason DeRulo is a hack or give it a decent score because of the Imogen Heap sample. I just want to say that my score is NOT indicative of my feelings of Imogen Heap, she is a queen who deserved better than this bullshit.

**mich4725** (1): what a bad vocal

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Everything about this is awful, the production, the sample, the lyrics, the singer. This hit number one, shame on you America.

**pearllouise** (0): Imogen Heap didn't deserve this homophobia

**ExtraEater**: Easily among my least favorite songs on this whole list, and that's really just because it's plain boring. But I'll put that aside for a moment to talk about the song. The synths are bouncy and the song is generally absent of much actual rapping that it contributes to the airy, rich and ready to indulge in "whatever you like" vibe it's trying to go for.

**ImADudeDuh**: TI's 2nd song out and whew this is a bop. TI just wants to treat you RIGHT! This song is a sugar daddy's girl dream song! Just being pampered and TI is just ready to waste his entire bank account on you. This is just a fun pop rap song. The production is catchy as hell and just a great tune to bounce around to.

**ggodisawomann** (10): this was a contender for my 11, Nicole really did THAT

**mms82** (10): still one of my fave songs of all time- T.I's paper trail was an amazing album

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): God I miss music that sounded like this.

**poppinmmolly** (10): I LOVED this song back then

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBntTfJ3Yoc&feature=youtu.be

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): I can't unhear "I want Joe Biden, I need Joe Biden"

**izeasklapaucius** (9): peak T.I. can't hate him.

**MashLuke** (9): such a cute song

**twat\_brained** (8.7): the original 7 Rings, they don't make em like they used to

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): There’s something kind of endearing about this song, hip hop doesn’t have a lot of cheesy love songs like this and even though it’s still super materialistic, it’s kind of sweet how T.I. just wants to give his girlfriend anything she could possibly ever want. It’s honestly surprising just how big T.I. was in the Paper Trail era.

**Awhile2** (8): if you werent blasting [the you can vote however you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxlwYP0HNdc) parody during the 2008 election wwyd?

**frogaranaman** (8): I want Supreme, I want Gucci, I want Prada, I want Louis, I want big dicks, I want good things, I want sex and I want you, please.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): remember that white girl cover ejnfdcxlncsfdc anya marina. i literally bought that. why god.

**kappyko** (8): crazy how his best song is the one that he actually sings the chorus on. eminem cant relate

**1998tweety** (7.8): I don't think I've ever actually heard this song, I just remember its snippets from the DJ Earworm mashup.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I’m not completely sold on this song since T.I’s voice is a little too flat to make it work out to its full potential, but this is exactly the kind of chill urban radio bop that I really like hearing sometimes when I just want to relax and enjoy life. ‘Patron on ice’ is a fun lyric for me, too, due to fairly obvious reasons! I wouldn’t call this among the best of this Year-End, but based on my mood it could potentially approach my list of favourites.

#Can I get a good song then?

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): I thought "brain so good could've swore you went to college" was talking about her actual brain until I was 16

**MrSwearword** (7): Nicole Scherzinger did it better and he should know

**NotWith10000Men** (7): probably my favorite TI song

**ReallyCreative** (7): Weird Al did it better

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.2): good for background noise

**enecks** (6): I miss crunk

**tapdancingpig** (6): Issa bop, but I’ll probably forget in 10 minutes.

**Tchalla1966** (6): I hear a sneer? In the background that just takes me right of the song and i’m lowkey annoyed wtf

**waluigiest** (6): this was his year but i’m just not feeling it

**vapourlomo** (5): It's mediocre, but remember when Weird Al did a parody of this but about the recession? "You like Top Ramen? Need Top Ramen?" Good times.

**jamesfog** (4): Aged badly. Actually it was never that good in the first place

**Plasm\_Trojan** (3.7): Sounds unfinished.

**radiofan15** (3.5): Why does this song's beat sounds TOO SIMILAR to the much-superior Lil Wayne's Lollipop? i'm the only one who notices it or am I taking crazy pills?

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): super cheesy. also if this is considered hip hop then post malone is as well

**xxrandooxx** (3.2): God I wish that were me

**pearllouise** (1): I'm scared

**selegend** (1): no.

**ExtraEater**: A high-energy middle school 2000s teenage anthem has arrived, and icon Ashley Tisdale is even here to guest star in the music video! The way the guitars explode into a wall of wonder and amazement still captivate me to this day, and quite frankly I enjoy this song more than "Somebody Told Me" because the whole song manages to really live up to how good its chorus is here. I commend that key change, too, because honestly it was a theatrical inevitability from the beginning. The times from which this song emerged are long gone, but the song still remains.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song has such a rocking groove! I love the guitar work on this song. This song deserves to be remembered as one of quintessential pop punk songs along with Check Yes Juliet and Dear Maria Count Me In. Plus, that key change at the chorus in the end, whew!

#heart eyes, motherfucker

**gannade** (10): yeah im a middle school suburban white girl in her just slightly emo phase. What about it? Thank u, next.

**hikkaru** (10): I don't think this was quite as big in Canada as it was in the USA (didn't make our year-end chart, and peaked much lower overall) so I think that's why I don't have the clearest memory of this existing (though I easily could have just missed it), yet just the song's lyrics and melody and everything about it manages to make me feel nostalgia for something I didn't experience. A banger through and through

**Mysario** (10): THROW IT AWAY, FORGET YESTERDAY, WE'LL MAKE THE GREAT ESCAPE

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**poppinmmolly** (10): I LOOOOVED Boys Like Girls in the mid-late 00s.

**selegend** (10): omggggg back when ashley tisdale was relevant and we all freaked out about her being in the music video and flirting with martin

**strawberryswing1** (10): the great escape outsells but ugh this takes me back

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): BRING BACK EMO BOYS LIKE GIRLS

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): slay me ashley tisdale

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i didn't realize it until this listen but i like this song more than anything by the big 4 emo bands. it has a certain nostalgia to it that reminds me of Mr. Brightside and that's one of the best songs of all time so

**jamesfog** (9.5): I USED TO BE LOVE DRUNK! BUT NOW IM HUNGOVER! :yas:

**ggodisawomann** (9): I still bop to this

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This gives me such Disney Channel/TeenNick vibes and I love it.

**pearllouise** (9): Ashley Tisdale doing charity work? Iconic.

**1998tweety** (8.7): bop

**xxrandooxx** (8.3): fulfilling my need for 2009 rock, lyrics are a little cliche but isn't that the point?

**frogaranaman** (8): I hope it was Bartons.

**mms82** (8): I don't think I ever heard this before but its such a cute lil song!

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): The only Boys Like Girls song I’ve ever heard before this is their collaboration with Taylor Swift, which is among my least favourite songs in her discography, and as somebody who hates the scene takeover from last decade and overused alcohol metaphors In love songs my reaction to seeing this in the tracklist was ‘ew!’. Now that I’ve listened to it, I have to confess that it’s good, though. It doesn’t completely get rid of my biases, but it’ll do.

**bespectacIed** (7): Their first album was so cringe and so good lol but thjs was their real mainstream debut. Do y'all remember the cute collab with Taylor lol how the fuck did that happen

**enecks** (7): Corny but enjoyable

**izeasklapaucius** (7): kinda sounds like all time low's timebomb

**rslashpoopheads** (7): YOUR VOOOOOOOOOOOOICE

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6.5): this is like peak generic pop-punk

**CarlieScion** (6): She's Got A Boyfriend Now outsold

**MashLuke** (6): eh

**twat\_brained** (6): this just sounds like a The Great Escape recycle. And I cannot tell you how disappointing it was to see Ashley in this video.

**ariannagrandtitties** (5.2): catchy but im def not love drunk

**NotWith10000Men** (5): generic 2009

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): no

**vapourlomo** (4): Need a pop-rock chorus, but can't think of anything good? Just rip off the Killers! Nobody will notice, I promise.

**waluigiest** (3): this is annoying

**ryjomom** (2.5): Suddenly I’m heterophobic, but this is such a 2000s rock song

**ReallyCreative** (1.5): Imagine ripping off Somebody Told Me and making it sound like every other "peppy but edgy" boy rock band high-tempo love song ever made, 2009 really was a sorespot in some ways

**MrSwearword** (1): oh wow something worse than 5SOS and even McFly

**radiofan15** (1): What is this bland white bread with water heteronormative-advocating band of Trace Cyrus wannabes with this Disney-friendly Mormon Prom-esque excuse of a song that dares to plagiarize The Killers' *Somebody Told Me*?!?!? DIE YOU FUCKER DIE... also, Ashley deserved better

**ExtraEater**: As far as songs from "Fearless" go, White Horse is stood up in terms of fairytale whimsy by "Love Story", stood up in terms of balladry by "Forever & Always" (it counts), and stood up in general popularity/quality by "You Belong With Me" (and "Love Story" too, of course). For that, it's a song that begs questioning as to why it was a single over several other songs on the album. Taylor deep cuts still often have some spark in 'em, yet I don't feel even that from this single. It's still pretty decent, at least.

**ImADudeDuh**: Obviously, this would be taylor's lowest song. If people called Love Story too childish and cheesy, then this had absolutely no chance at staying around. White Horse is a lowkey ballad. Just realizing that this relationship is over and she was stupid and naive to expect this relationship to last long. Even if you hate this, at least it's a better break up song by a 19 year old than Lucid Dreams!

---
#why it got to be white?

**1998tweety** (10): This feels like a direct continuation to Love Story following the storybook theme. I slept on this song for so long and I have no idea why since its probably now my favourite songs on the album. I think the reason why I love it so much is cause it feels like a prequel to Dear John which is imo one of Taylor's best songs.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song is so sad it gets to me man

**ManofOranges** (9): Not one of my favorite fearless songs but still great and the bridge is really good

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I had a strange period of apathy to this song a few months ago, to the point where I actually declared it inferior to All You Had To Do Was Stay in a ranking of Track 5s that I posted on Discord. For that, I'm incredibly sorry! One of the problems I have with Fearless is that it occasionally dips into more immature territory than the wise-beyond-your-years approach of most Self-Titled songs not named Picture to Burn, but White Horse is teaching me that I probably have to chalk that up to marketing, not Taylor herself; White Horse is a stunning development in maturity, and a painful exhibition of a teenage girl approaching adulthood and realising that some dreams just aren't worth chasing. So, for the last time, I was wrong! My bad!

**ryjomom** (9): Love the Lyrics

**ariannagrandtitties** (8.7): taylor swift come save me on ur white horse

**jamesfog** (8.5): You and ur white horse.. come around :sobs:

**kappyko** (8): oh this is cute

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This is good, that’s about it.

**waluigiest** (8): why am I crying in the barn

**Mysario** (7.7): 🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴 Taylor's best album, prove me wrong

**radiofan15** (7.6): Cute but Kacey now has the female country gay crown with her Horse song... sorry Tay, I don't made the rules

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I swear to Godney I heard her say "momma's steak". Also I never understood what the White Horse motif was. Maybe that's because Taylor made horse girl music for her first three albums. Help me @ popheads swifties

**enecks** (7): I kept finding this when looking for the song Swift Horse from the Shadow of the Colossus soundtrack.

#Off to the glue factory with you

**ReallyCreative** (7): I like this more than most Taylor ballads but it's not one of her best.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): yeah but have you heard the rolling stones

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): sorry but who is this boring cowboy chick? i'd rather listen to our main pop girl gaylord swift

**frogaranaman** (6): Coffee-house vibes, purely because she does the "drop the instrumental right when the last line of the chorus happens to make it sound more damning" trick.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): not my favorite taylor era

**pearllouise** (5): Sounda about white

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): honestly one of my least favourite taylor songs I said what I said

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): honestly pretty uninteresting, sorry swifties

**xxrandooxx** (4): not my cup of tea, but its tea.

**ggodisawomann** (3): yeehaw

**MrSwearword** (1): fuck this song and the white horse it rode in on

#literally half of reputation exists*

**ExtraEater**: I like to think that a good number of songs in this rate come in distinct pairs. Halo and Already Gone are both here, Second Chance and No Surprise share the spotlight for 2000s alt rock, Heartless and Day n Nite share the spotlight for moody rap, and Black Eyed Peas/Flo Rida/Pitbull all have two songs each, among many others. "Fallin' For You" serves as the adult contemporary partner to "I'm Yours", and it's just as viably cute and sunny to the point of also being totally irresistible. Some may draw this (and "I'm Yours") up as campy mediocrity but damn does it make me smile. I know I fell for this song already.

**ImADudeDuh**: If you thought White Horse was super cheesy and white, Fallin For You really lays on the mozzerella. If I'm Yours was the "white guy with an accoustic guitar at the beach" song, then this is the "white girl with an accoustic guitar at the beach" song, as is most of Colbie Caillat's music. Fallin For You is a great song for the radio. It's sweet enough to get you through the car ride to walmart and get the kids happy. It's nothing groundbreaking and it's just fine and fun. 

---
#let's go to the beach beach

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song is so sweet and I MAINTAIN THAT

**MrSwearword** (10): Colbie Caillat's best song

**poppinmmolly** (10): this was one of my faves in the fall of 2009!

**Roxieloxie** (10): i thought this was TS but its not. Either way it's really cute

**ryjomom** (10): White Woman Rejoice

**mms82** (9.5): AC Queen jumped out

**Mysario** (9.5): Colbie making cute music since... whenever she started

**1998tweety** (9): this is cute

**selegend** (9): ugh WHITE QUEEN

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): swifties: fed | ariantors: eating | colbiecats: fucking starving

**twat\_brained** (8.7): we need to rate colbie vs sara bareilles vs regina spektor vs maybe norah jones at some point

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This song is really cute not going to lie.

**gannade** (8): i can feel the sun kiss my white skin

**jamesfog** (8): Chill bop :bopping:

**radiofan15** (7.2): It's cute radio filler that I don't really mind

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This is such a sweet love song, it makes me smile every time

**pearllouise** (7): We need more ladies like Colbie

#clumsy bitch

**frogaranaman** (7): This is cheesy coffee-house core, but, like, still too intense.

**MashLuke** (7): the female Jason Mraz

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Fallin’ For You isn’t much in the long run, but it’s probably the best non-Taylor country song in this rate tied with Big Green Tractor (go away, Chicken Fried stans, you have no power over me). I can’t really describe it as anything more than cute, but I like Colbie’s voice and I might find it particularly relaxing on a windy day. A mid-tier song on the Year-End, but still pretty decent.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): wow the autotune on this could do with some touch ups, otherwise, it’s a nice song.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): bobby moynihan's biggest achievement is starring in this music video

**waluigiest** (7): cute

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.9): finally some good fucking music

**CarlieScion** (6): cute

**enecks** (6): This exists

**ReallyCreative** (6): It's pretty generic and boring but Colbie is pleasant enough to listen to so it's fine

**vapourlomo** (6): I feel like Colbie Caillat was just the Starbucks-branded version of Taylor Swift.

**xxrandooxx** (5.2): Decent, wholesome song

**skargardin** (5): cute but a real snoozefest as well

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): this is also boring

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): it's no bubbly

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): colbie is way overrated change my mind

**ExtraEater**: A true sports reel-esque hype song fit with a truly ceremonious airhorn and a throbbing brass beat underneath. All of these verses, save for Kanye's, deserve acclaim. Drake's boastfulness is stronger and more believable than it would ever be again, Lil Wayne's proves itself to be more than a throwaway Lil Wayne verse with those gorgeous piano flourishes, and Eminem's conclusion speaks for itself. "Crack a Bottle" and the album from which it came may have marked Eminem's fall, but "Forever" is the hint that Eminem still has enough greatness to make "Not Afraid" and "Love the Way You Lie" just a year later.

**ImADudeDuh**: I really want to like this song a lot. Drake has some great lines and great energy that he doesn't have anymore. But then he raps about having chemo... Plus, Kanye's verse is really not good. The production is surprisingly weak and the air horns are ruined from memes for me. Lil Wayne has the second best verse on here, and that says a lot about the song.

---
#I'mma play this shit forever

**frogaranaman** (10): If this song was released today, goodbye charts.

**gannade** (10): eminem lowkey has the best verse here ugh

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just so huge and so egotistical and I mean that in the best ways possible. Another song for the history books.

**Mysario** (10): in order of best verse to worst - Eminem, Lil Wayne, Kanye, Drake - prove me wrong

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is a great rap song. Everyone here gave some of their best bars and it absolutely shows.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): now THIS is a good 2009 rap song

**radiofan15** (10): Imagine how much would this outsold all of out faves in 2019...

**strawberryswing1** (10): This is the song that got me into rap in 11th grade

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this is so good still, Eminem goes off

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Infinity War is the most ambitious crosso-

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song is fucking iconic, I know basically every line of it by heart and it’s pretty much the last good content of Eminem’s career. It’s easily one of the most stacked posse cuts in rap history, and it’s crazy that when this song dropped Drake was probably the least popular name on it. This song would not be half as good now, so I’m glad it dropped when it did.

**vapourlomo** (10): This is the moment when Drake became a superstar. Even Kanye's clunky verse is charming in its own way — I'm always open to awkward Superbad references.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I can’t believe LeBron has his own theme song basically with the Avengers of hip hop. His power!

**1998tweety** (9): one of the greatest rappers ever, a pedo, a homophobe, and a trumpie. name a more iconic quartet

**jamesfog** (9): Wait at this classic tho. This and Chris Brown's Forever are BOPS! :sorry:

**TragicKingdom1** (9): one of the most iconic posse cuts of all time tbh

**fishingfor8** (8): damn it Kanye

**kappyko** (8): eminem doesnt sound shit here. shouldve been ester dean on the charts though

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Listening to this after a botched attempt to do the rate, I actually think that there are more standouts here than what I originally identified. The fact that everybody except Lil Wayne of all people’s been cancelled since aside, Drake’s part is bloody great here, and while I don’t think Forever seams especially well as a collaboration, all rappers here try their best or at least something close to it and the end result ultimately pays off.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Kanye big oof.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): 2000s Drake >>>>>>>>>>> 2010s Drake change my mind. Also somehow Eminem of all people manages to come up with the best verse on this song. Honestly that single verse probably blows the entirety of Relapse out of the water. It's a shame he's undone by a conference call of Drake, Wayne and Kanye phoning in their verses. Maybe not as much Drake but this song has potential that just isn't maximized.

**enecks** (7): A classic verse, an okay verse, a overrated as hell verse, and a mediocre verse. I'll let you decide which is which. JK I won't - Drake, Lil Wayne, Eminem, Kanye.

#Eternal damnation

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): There's a lot of big names on here but I just don't think it works for me

**CarlieScion** (6): eminem who [3]

**PuggleMaster** (6): drake is the only good part of this song

**ggodisawomann** (5.5): this fucks a little bit

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): he warned us 10 years ago he would be annoying now and we didn't LISTEN

**selegend** (5): bop but kii at all of these guys turning out to be trash except wayne

**waluigiest** (3): underwhelming this sounds so cheap why did Kanye let this happen

**MrSwearword** (2): because this made a great Sprite commercial and not a goddamn thing else

**ExtraEater**: Look, so I didn't like "Beautiful Girls" as much as I probably should've, and "Eenie Meenie" is just plain... bad. "Fire Burning" is the total dancefloor-smashing bop to cement Sean Kingston's legacy. Call 911, get an ambulance, blow those candles, get your freak on, go crazy! A wonderful song. Rest in peace Sean KINGston.

**ImADudeDuh**: Everyone, please tell your loved ones that you love them. You never know when a jet ski will take them away from your life. Sean, we love you and miss you. I hope you aren't in the palce where there's a lot of fire burning...

#A moment of silence, please

**gannade** (8): RIP king

**jamesfog** (8): RIP

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): R.I.P. THE LEGEND BURN YOUR JETSKIS IN SOLIDARITY

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): fuck xxxtentacion, THIS is the artist we lost too soon. honestly it's disgusting that not even Beautiful Girls re-entered the hot 100 after what happened to him

#This shit is 🔥🔥🔥

**1998tweety** (10): A MASSIVE bop, I remember this song being huge in Canada. The beat is so so good and infectious.

**Mysario** (10): this is one of the songs I forgot about in this rate just from name alone but the second I heard SOMEBODY CALL NINE ONE ONE, high school came back to me

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**selegend** (10): if you dont think this slaps youre deaf or racist

**Tchalla1966** (10): This song is one of the few songs in this rate that doesn’t sound dated. Like if he dropped this today IT WOULD STILL SMASH I BELIEVE IT. SOMEBODY CALL 911

**vapourlomo** (10): Never forget — Sean Kingston was on the birthday cake wave before Rihanna.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I loved this song as a young impressionable teenager who didn't know it was about weed and I still love it now.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Invented the Fire Department, we have to stan.

**twat\_brained** (9): SOMEBODY CALL 911!!!! I swear, the three pillars of pop music in 2009 were Max Martin, RedOne, and he whose name I refuse to invoke. I'm tempted to give this a 10, but I can't comprehend every word Sean is saying, sadly. Fortunately for Sean, this will never not pop off in a nightclub.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): An underrated bop.

**Awhile2** (8): im pretty sure i got a free download of this song from a gogurt promotion and it made me really happy that i had just saved $1.29

**frogaranaman** (8): It's the middle school dance. "Somebody call 9-1-1" plays the speakers. You set your drink down on the nearest table and sprint. You _are_ shawty, you tell yourself as you dance your heart out.

**MashLuke** (8): he had the face of a kid but the lyrics of a man

**pearllouise** (8): Hot

**poppinmmolly** (8): SOMEBODY CALL NINE ONE ONE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): “Hello 911 👮‍♂️👮‍♀️what’s your emergency” Me: shawty fire burning 🔥🔥🔥 on the dance floor!!! 💃💃💃 whoa! 911: 🚓ALL HOMIES REPORT🚓 🚨WEE! WOO! WEE! WOO!🚨 ................ /🚔\ ......... ....🌲......./🚔\ ...🌳. ............. /_🚔🚔........... ....🌲..../_🚔___.......... 🚫need to blow that crazy flame away 🚫

**enecks** (7): This is actually good???

**hikkaru** (7): I forgot this song existed oh my god

**Roxieloxie** (7): [This bops harder than this song does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeZY6BVodTY)

**radiofan15** (6.8): Cory Baxter with the hits and shit

#Just gonna stand there and watch you burn

**GiftoftheGeek** (6): Fred Figglehorn's iconic cover of the intro is honestly better then the original

**MrSwearword** (6): the forgettable hit then and still forgettable song now

**waluigiest** (6): somebody call 911

**xxrandooxx** (5.3): These songs are so simple, I guess 2009 really was a “simpler” time.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I don’t know how many irrelevant Seans are let loose every few years to wreck havocs on the pop charts before disappearing, but can the person keeping them in the dungeons please pay attention to how often they steal the keys with more caution? I tried to be kind enough to Fire Burning to give it a 7, but that would be a disservice to a lot of 7s in this rate; the song does basically nothing, and there are way better examples of the vibe this Sean is going for within this Year-End alone. Fire Burning is meant to be hot, but it’s sadder than it first seems.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (4): this song is fire burning up my eardrums

**kappyko** (3): he was better a dork in "Beautiful girls" than this okay club fare. chorus a 10 the rest a ehhnnnnnnn

**NotWith10000Men** (3): sounds so dated

**skargardin** (3): ehh

**Plasm\_Trojan** (2.1): "Somebody call 911, Shawty fire burning," is the epitome of awful pick-up lines from this period in music.

**ryjomom** (2): God, I am glad we left autotune in 2009.

**tapdancingpig** (1): I feel like this song was probably a lot of people’s childhoods, but... there’s just nothing here but autotune and a bad hook

**ExtraEater**: Like it or not, this is an anthem for long distance relationships that deserves to stand alongside masterpieces like A Thousand Miles. And do you remember (feat. Sean Paul & Lil Jon)… ringtone rap? “Kiss Me Thru The Phone” evokes a lot of ghosts of this era where phone apps didn’t have minimalistic designs as logos. There’s this utterly ridiculous concept of kissing one through, sorry, THRU the phone, and although I know that involves blowing kisses and whatnot I can very vividly see two people with their lips on the screen because that’s just how it kinda was. ANYWAY, this bops to the top amongst similar trashy dumb plot rap songs and the fact that Soulja Boy hired someone to sing his phone number for him makes this legendary and influential. After all, it kinda invented the [Chinese language](https://i.imgur.com/EOceiIb.png)! (Note: In the time since I made this writeup, this “bug” has apparently been “fixed” and it doesn’t work anymore, kinda like how the automated Soulja Boy message you’d get when you typed in that phone number doesn’t work as intended anymore. Everything’s got a deeper meaning, eh?)

**ImADudeDuh**: Well this is a massive improvment to Turn My Swag On. The production is insanely simple as fuck, but still kinda catchy. It's probably soulja boy's best rapping, but that isn't saying much. I feel like a lot of my good will to this song is based on it's use in the DJ Earworm 2009 mix, which is still a better song than this according to r/popheads!

#Miranda Cosgrove - Kissin U

**gannade** (10): all the arianators are probably gonna give this a 1 for being too black despite the fact that she basically plagiarized from him. Thank u, next.

**mms82** (10): by far Soulja Boy's best song (not much of a competition tho tbh)

**MrSwearword** (10): shocking, but when something doesn't suck, I reward it with proper marks

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Invented phones, Gaga and Beyoncé are shook.

**PuggleMaster** (10): ICONIC I was obsessed with this in middle school

**rosecoloreds** (10): soulja invented phones

**Tchalla1966** (10): iconic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): "I listen to Soulja Boy." The class is shocked at my overwhelming intelligence. "...how? I can't even understand his sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well...Soulja Boy up in this hoe, watch me crank it, watch me ohhh!" One student laughs, and I turn to see who the fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Okay this song is incredibly dated and it’ll probably go out in the first 10 or so but I’m throwing my whole support behind it. Soulja Boy is a genius businessman, an influential legend, and a love master.

**twat\_brained** (10): Why do I love this song so goddamn much? I think it's because it's such a wholesome hip hop classic compared to the misogynistic waste in this rate like Every Girl. It's about Soulja and Sammie telling their loved ones how much they miss them in such an adorable way. And it puts a wide smile on my face every time I hear it. It's maybe the silliest love song in this rate and I am all for it

**waluigiest** (10): afrofuturism.

**nightjesus** (9): not a troll I really love this song its a jam

**1998tweety** (8.7): This isn't as good as I remembered it to be, but it still bops.

**\_wailordfan** (8.5): School dances were never the same

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): iconic. Did anyone dial the number back in the day to find out if it really was Soulja Boy?

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh, hey, it’s not fair that we only attach Soulja Boy’s name to Crank That if he’s made songs like this one. The actual best part of Kiss Me Thru The Phone is Sammie, but I do like this a lot. I’ve never heard it before, though. Am I that young?

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): oh GOD me, like, 8 years old, singing, SUPERMAN THAT HOOOOOOOO. remember the cupid shuffle? god

**izeasklapaucius** (8): souljaboytellem.com

**NotWith10000Men** (8): what is this album cover

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): tag your self i'm the atlanta area code

**ManofOranges** (7.5): Soulja Boy is a visionary

**frogaranaman** (7): Can't believe Soulja Boy Tell 'Em literally invented long distance relationships. When will popheads stop denying his influence?

**jamesfog** (7): Cardi is shook

**kappyko** (7): oh ringtone rap i get it

**poppinmmolly** (7): cute

**wholesomebody** (7): invented phones

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.1): catchy

**radiofan15** (5.6): I don't think it's really possible (or healthy) to kiss someone through the phone

**enecks** (5): Yiff me through the DMs ;-3

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): i kinda like this ironically but its just so horrendously dated

**pearllouise** (4): The power of technology

**ExtraEater**: “This is not to get confused. This one’s for you.” …For me? Look, for the most part Drake has always possessed the charisma and flair that made this song work so well. I love how it transitions from his warm falsetto (“Cuz she hold me down”) into those low pitch verse/chorus moments and vice versa. Who knew after this big hit Drake would still be making even more iconic hits over the next ten years? Even with his staying power, this one might just be the best hit he’s ever had.

**ImADudeDuh**: Drake's first number 2 hit that would be just the beginning of Drake chart dominance for the years to come. Drake in 2009 was really a good rapper. Here is another song about a guy rapping about how he'll treat this girl if they continue the relationship, but this one feels the most genuine. Probably because it's more than just to a girl in the club that they just saw. 

---
#The best Drake's ever done

**MrSwearword** (10): wow a time when I didn't hate Drake's music

**Mysario** (10): Drake's best album, prove me wrong

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Remember when Drake used to try? Sigh.

**PuggleMaster** (10): whew when drake wasn't overrated

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I was so obsessed with the line “sweat pants hair tied chilling with no makeup on, that’s when you’re the prettiest I hope that you don’t take it wrong” but if a guy said that to me now I’d be like bye

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): when drake shares the last slice 😩😩😩

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Who would have thought Drake would be one of the biggest artists following this song? It is a good song though but it’s crazy the musical path he has taken since then.

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): ew imagine him singing this to an underage.

**gannade** (9): a sweet song to millie bobby brown

**MashLuke** (9): good

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I’m not a big Drake fan in 2019, but, wow, were some of his earliest hits that he cooked up right after stepping out of that wheelchair fantastic. Best I Ever Had is a great nnostalgic throwback that’s easy to listen to and it makes me all the more disappointed his music hasn’t stayed consistently good over the years. Sad!

**strawberryswing1** (9): Iconic

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): It’s hard to imagine a time where Drake wasn’t the biggest thing in music, but pretty much from the beginning he had a talent for dropping great singles. The clean version of the hook may honestly be better than the explicit one.

**vapourlomo** (9): Drake fatigue is going to lower this song on the list...but it’s still a classic. Every rap banger should have an Andy Griffith punchline.

**wholesomebody** (9): i always loved early drake

**1998tweety** (8.8): This is chill

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Ok but actually make Drake great again.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): /u/Elitefourbrad is the fucking best popheads user.

**bespectacIed** (8): Ahhh remember the good guy drake memes

**frogaranaman** (8): Over/Under on how many songs about pedophilia there will be for this song? My guess is over 5.

**ManofOranges** (8): I'm so not used to hearing the explicit version but this still hits

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): A Drake song I actually like, though he loses points for "Andy Griffith theme song" because I have PTSD from that

**ryjomom** (7): I’m actually living for the lyrics

**selegend** (7): iconic

**waluigiest** (7): it’s got some nice production but the hook is not good. His sung vocals are also nice

**radiofan15** (6.9): I guess this is nice... i'm glad Drake improved tho

#WE THE WORST MUSIC

**enecks** (6): Production's good but that hook sucks

**fishingfor8** (6): Hi Drake

**Plasm\_Trojan** (6): Unpopular opinion: the censored version of this song is so much better.

**twat\_brained** (6): OMFG DRAKE RIPPED OFF JACOB SARTORIUS HE IS FUCKING CANCELLED /s lbr his expiry date will come when he is no longer on the Hot 100. And I will never understand his appeal, nor will I understand how he went from this to Nice For What then back to working with noname hacks like Blocboy JB and Lil Baby

**CopyCatJ** (5): eh

**jamesfog** (5): Aged

**NotWith10000Men** (5): it's okay

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5): this is NOT the best song drake ever had tho

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): i hate his flow on this

**ggodisawomann** (2): I really think this song is garbage

**pearllouise** (2): Seeing the word "best" in a Drake song is the funniest thing I have seen today

**ExtraEater**: One thought I've always had in the back of my head (until I figured out the name) was, "Y'know, this sounds like that one song about free falling." As I would later find out, this song was mashed up with Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" by none other than 2009 mashup icon DJ Earworm, and it sounds great. That aside, I like this song a lot because those strings ring with melancholy and her vocal performance is so passionate and impressive in this song. I'm not sure if this is really a cover considering the original wasn't officially released and it seemed she just took the writing like usual routine (not shade, obviously many pop stars do that), but either way Beyonce's vocals prove she succeeded in making this her song.

**ImADudeDuh**: Beyonce ends sexism and we repay her with giving her a song that gets chopped just before the top half?? If I Were a Boy is a ballad about sexism and double standards that women face, but it eventually turns into her pleading for her man to treat her better in their relationship, which according to Lemonade, didn't work! I do like the whole idea of beyonce making a sexism ballad, but I feel as though turning into a specific relationship song somewhat cheapens the meaning.

---
#I was busy thinking bout beys

**NotWith10000Men** (11): this woman's VOICE

**bespectacIed** (10): As a young teen, that mv plot twist shook me to my core. One of Bey's best lyrics and singles. Classic RnBey, feel like pure shit just want her back

**jamesfog** (10): CLASSIC!

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**ReallyCreative** (10): Listening to this song after I realized I was a gay was a formative experience for me, this song's sound isn't particularly groundbreaking or incredibly interesting but as always, Beyonce's vocals do the work and the song is super meaningful for me and I know lots of other people out there

**Roxieloxie** (10): This wasn't as popular as halo/single laddies but it should've been

**1998tweety** (9): Trans icon

**pearllouise** (9): Transgender bop

**poppinmmolly** (9): a great song. The Spanish version is really good too.

**ryjomom** (9): THE MESSAGE OF THIS SONG 👌🏻

**waluigiest** (9): her fuckin vocals……

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): Men are trash

**ariannagrandtitties** (7.6): we stan a trans rights activist

**ManofOranges** (7.5): tea but damn this song is just a little too boring for my taste

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Yep, Beyonce’s gender politics have indeed been quite a bit messy until fairly recently. If I Were A Boy hasn’t aged all that well, no thanks to laughable lyrics that destroy the song’s advertised purpose, but if I choose to read it as a woman being scorned and lashing out not completely rationality in turn instead of a commentary on sexism, I’d probably count it as a good song. Is this an all-time greatest ballad from Bey? No, perhaps not, but it’ll do.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): beyonce is so ducking stupid not being a hater just being honest. like i just dont get why people think shes the hottest hoe out there 1. shes ugly as fuck 2. her singing well on a scoville scale from bell pepper to carolina reaper is about a banana pepper aka better than rebecca black worse than justin bieber. her fans are annoying af and act like shes a fucking queen when really the only thing shes a queen of is the queen of talentless fucksticks incorporation. its honestly sad that normie bandwagoner teenagers pick her out of all the other great musicians out there to be their "queen" but guess what im not with that bowl shit ok i rather listen to fucking country until i go deaf than listen to that absolute and utter garbage you fuckheads call music. and next time i see someone post/talk about anything approving encouraging or supporting her music career or physical appearance i will take needle nose wire cutters right through the corneas irises and pupils of both of your fucking eyes. sorry to be so blunt but if you cant handle the truth get off the internet before you trigger your own self. because im literally stating 100% facts and no ones dumb ass grimy ass opinions can ever overwrite complete facts that were even proven true by the fda, epa, def, & faa

**gannade** (6.5): we stan a transgender icon

#She really thought she did something here huh?

**radiofan15** (6.2): Beyoncé doing ballads can be a hit or a miss... and this is definitely a miss... it's really sappy and bland but it's still performed with such conviction than I can't fully hate it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Beyoncé is really good here, I wish the lyrics and production could match.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): I’m going to get roasted but this song is boring

**xxrandooxx** (5.6): StOp RoMaNtIcIzInG bEiNg A MaN ItS hArDeR tHaN iT lOoKs

**enecks** (5): Bey had a long way to go with feminism

**frogaranaman** (5): Cool, the spinelessness of her infidelity statements stem all the way back to 2009.

**MrSwearword** (5): overrated as fuck and not worth more attention than it deserves

**Awhile2** (4): if you werent blasting the [dave days if i were a girl parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWhKdXcqYeU), wwyd?

**CarlieScion** (4): this was really deep to me when i was 12. im no longer 12.

**twat\_brained** (4): this does for sexism what Rita Ora's song "Girls" does for LGBT rights. I'm done with it, and I'm also not very interested in listening to I Am…Sasha Fierce either

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (3): i still hate the awkwardly delivered message in this song, don’t /u/ me

**TragicKingdom1** (3): american idol core

**mms82** (2.5): slow and boring sorry Beyoncé really hit her low in this era

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): not even a beyonce ballad pointing out gender disparity can make me like ballads and i will not be silent!

**tapdancingpig** (2): I fucking hate this song so much. Beyoncé’s good, but the writing relies on stereotypes of gender that I’ve never liked, and also it’s boring, even though Beyoncé is trying to sell it SO HARD

**ggodisawomann** (1): one of Yonce's worst songs imo

**ExtraEater**: A lightning bolt of power that more or less deserves its reputation as an anthem. I think there’s a lot of potentially obnoxious production elements, such as that endless squiggly synth, but it all somehow manages to coalesce into a total banger. Well, that’s what I would say if I loved it *that* much. Still a lovable lil’ ball of catharsis and energy, though.

**ImADudeDuh**: It is shocking to me how pop fans really don't care about this song as much as the GP. It's an okay song, but the video and line "should've put a ring on it" has definitely eclipsed the song in the eyes of the GP. The song is ok, but that constant loop in the background gets grating after a while.

#*puts ring on song*

**1998tweety** (10): Bop iconic queen

**bespectacIed** (10): Wanted to give this 11 so much, I really don't get the hatred this sub has to this masterpiece of a song. Is it the obvious, unapologetic, black woman-ness of its lyrics? This is such a well-made, well-produced anthem, I love it with all my heart and I put this near the top of Bey's already impressive discography. And yes, the simple yet iconic mv is one of the best music videos OF ALL TIME. OF. ALL. TIME.

**CopyCatJ** (10): Sunday, September 13, 2009 iconic

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): Gave this an 11 in the 2008 Rate, and it would definitely be a contender if Lady Gaga and Rihanna weren't in this rate. This song is truly iconic and is one of my favorite Beyonce songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): iconic and will probably be robbed in this rate somehow due to popheads poor taste

**MrSwearword** (10): her last #1 on the Hot 100 : (

**Mysario** (10): NOW PUT YO HANDS UP

**pearllouise** (10): Keep in mind that Famous would never happen without this bop

**radiofan15** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP-KFnYg6Hw

**ReallyCreative** (10): Isn't it weird that the national anthem was written in 2009 and actually charted that year? Crazy

**Roxieloxie** (10): if i had to explain this year in music with only 10 songs this song, no question is number one on here.

**Tchalla1966** (10): I still remember the dance! 10YEARS AND I STILL REMEMBER THE DANCE

**jamesfog** (9.5): Iconic

**enecks** (9): This is a screeching dystopian bop that I should hate but it slaps. The mwowm noises in the background are so weird. This feels like a statement.

**tapdancingpig** (9): People seem to have soured on it, which is a fucking shame. It is a universal delight.

**MashLuke** (8): not as good as they say it is but good nonetheless

**skargardin** (8): Lacks some punch without the MV to be quite honest

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): honestly, this song is forever tied with the music video for better and worse. In this case worse since we’re only rating the song and tbh it lacks the magic without the dance

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): my anthem after having been single for 5 years

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): This song is almost kind of experimentally minimalist and ahead of its time, and it’s definitely catchy. However, it’s also definitely repetitive. Also however, the bridge is AWESOME.

**waluigiest** (8): this song’s legacy...... wish they did a bit more with the bridge but otherwise such a dope song

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.5): honestly? it's a mediocre bey song

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): Has anybody noticed the production is kind of strange and dare i say, experimental? Especially the bridge.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): repetitive but iconic

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I remain confused as to whether people consider this an iconic hit or an overrated, repetitive throwaway track, but I’m suspecting it’s a bit of both. That’s where I’m at, too. I loved all the fingersnaps on this song as a kid and I’m still more than a little fond of it, but compared to all the other showstoppers Beyonce can pull this is just okay. Also, I’m yelling at this, Love Story, and Heartless being so close by! Truly an iconic year!

#Not ready to mingle

**ManofOranges** (6.5): This is a bop but like it's just so abrasive it gets on my nerves sometimes

**\_wailordfan** (6): Is the song iconic, or is the music video?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKC_t1eJcXU

**xxrandooxx** (6): Yet another song plagued by Alvin and the Chipmunks, this time it was the female ones....

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): It’s iconic, but it’s really hard to listen to

**vapourlomo** (5): I forgot how grating this production is! It's insane how much better Beyonce's music has gotten this decade.

**frogaranaman** (4): This song just sounds so vapidly older upper-class white woman who thinks she's hip with her kid Mikaylah and Jayzon to me and I cannot get over that feeling.

**ggodisawomann** (4): repetitive and has annoyed me since the beginning. only good for memeage.

**hikkaru** (4): despite being one of the biggest songs ever, it was annoying in the 2008 rate and it's annoying here

**twat\_brained** (4): I'm starting to get tired of rating this song despite me co-hosting the 2008 rate. This is overrated in more ways than one

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): continues to be one of beyonce's worst songs, the production is bafflingly annoying

**ariannagrandtitties** (3): let’s be honest, people only still like this cuz it’s beyonce

**selegend** (3): "I can care less what you think"... did none of her 20 writers catch this error or are they equally illiterate

**rslashpoopheads** (2): Video is legendary but the song isn't sorry not sorry.

**ryjomom** (2): white women are too much

**mich4725** (1.5): Have never been really feeling this song and find it pretty annoying
