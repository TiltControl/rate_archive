**ExtraEater**: As far as dramatic sad alternative from the 2000s go, The Fray held onto me for just a little bit with their effectively sober-sounding ‚ÄúHow to Save a Life‚Äù and, of course, ‚ÄúYou Found Me‚Äù. ‚ÄúI found God on the corner of First in Amistad‚Äù opens the song through a strange hook, and now I‚Äôm really interested in what this guy has to say about his time with God on the corner of First in Amistad. The ‚ÄúLost and insecure‚Äù chorus drives the point home, because it just feels like a rush of sadness. I imagine him singing this not directly in front of God (on the corner of First in Amistad), but rather in his bedroom, crying to nothing in the midst of an emotional breakdown. This song‚Äôs a bit of a whirlwind, and although there‚Äôs much better melodies from this field of alternative, I can still appreciate such a passionate song about finding God on the corner of First in Amistad.

**ImADudeDuh**: I feel bad for The Fray's big first single to be How to Save a Life, one of the best sad pop songs of all time. It really set themselves up to being compared to it forever. You Found Me is a great song, but it isn't amazing. His voice is still somehwat weak and it definitely shows on some parts of here. The lyrics themselves are nothing to special or deep, it's basically a church hymn about being vulnerable and finding god. Still pretty shocking that this got to be one of the biggest hits of 2009.

#You found a good song

**fishingfor8** (11): Underrated band of the entire human existence

**ggodisawomann** (10): I stan the Fray, pls make more music THANKZ

**MashLuke** (10): I love his voice so much, come back please

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Roxieloxie** (10): sir thats my emotional support song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): some of y‚Äôall never found god on the corner of first in amistad and IT SHOWS

**bespectacIed** (9.5): My edgy agnostic teen self thought this song was a serve. Still a good song now, especially the haunting piano

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): I‚Äôm not going to detail my thoughts on this song‚Äôs lyrical content as a whole because then I‚Äôll go into a rant about the problem with theodicy that nobody is going to want to read, and I‚Äôm only allowed to do that on Discord, but my God (yes, pun intended) is this a fantastic rock ballad about abandonment. It‚Äôs one of the few rock songs on this chart I‚Äôd consider great, actually. Heck, maybe it‚Äôs the only one. Isaac Slade‚Äôs vocals are hoarse but really moving, and even if I‚Äôve always lumped the Fray in with all the mediocre alt rock I disliked from the 2000s and early 2010s, their two songs in this rate are making me reconsider my stance. Maybe they made some points.

**1998tweety** (9.2): This is nice

**mms82** (9): I'm surprised how much this held up relistening to it

**Mysario** (9): not as good as "How to Save a Life"

**vapourlomo** (9): It's such a bummer that The Fray disappeared after this album, because semi-emo American Coldplay was such a brilliant idea for a band.

**ryjomom** (8.7): saved my life

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I swear this song was everywhere on every single tv show back in 2009.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): i remember thinking when i was a kid that these guys must be the sort of deep artists that people always referred to as ‚Äúreal‚Äù music. The Fray are not those people, but this song still is really good

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): The Fray were always kinda B-list Coldplay or B-list OneRepublic, but I don‚Äôt mind it here because this song is actually pretty strong. It‚Äôs kind of storebrand Stop and Stare, but I consider that a compliment.

**frogaranaman** (7): I have a vivid memory of me hearing this song on the radio and saying, "He sounds more invested than her," followed by my dad stifling laughter. I think that was one of my first song roasts.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I still haven‚Äôt gotten this song out of my head.

**selegend** (7): kings of depression

**TragicKingdom1** (7): holds up okay but they have better songs

#Where were you to change the station?

**jamesfog** (6.5): I always thought he looked like a naked molerat

**ManofOranges** (6.5): Honestly this song is kinda sad

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): My least favorite Fray song from this era of time, but it's still listenable

**tapdancingpig** (6): ...it‚Äôs good background music? For some reason I feel like TuffMuffin gave this an 11

**skargardin** (5.5): this was boring af

**ariannagrandtitties** (5.2): angsty preteen me fucking loved this song

**twat\_brained** (5.2): I found God too. In fact, I found him in a lover. When his hair falls in his face and his hands so cold, they shake. Moreover, I thought T.I. including a goddamn Bible verse in the Dead and Gone video was blatant Christian righteousness. This takes it to a completely different level. Isaac's accent just makes him sound like a whiny brat here, I'm not sure why we let these guys have so many hit songs

**enecks** (5): This song is as empty as my resume

**MrSwearword** (5): this is probably their best song but I don't see it for them at large

**izeasklapaucius** (4.5): The Fray was one of those 2000s pop-rock band that's just kind of, there. No controversy, no acclaim, just sitting there enjoying their fame with the likes of Travis, Keane, etc.

**xxrandooxx** (4.5): The more I listen to these songs the more I dont like 2009

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): gowest and slow shit, name a less iconic duo

**NotWith10000Men** (4): they sound so whiny

**pearllouise** (4): I didn't know Sasha Velour sang this

**kappyko** (3.5): this song is nowhere near as good as dare you to move wait oops thats switchfoot

**waluigiest** (3): it‚Äôs so plain. Not bad or offensive but so uninteresting

**radiofan15** (1): Has anyone seen that 2004 movie The Bridge of San Luis Rey with with Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates, F. Murray Abraham and Gabriel Byrne? this song is more somehow boring than that

**ExtraEater**: A party song, despite what Rudolf said about it. The way this song sometimes thrashes around in anger and rebellion is surprisingly effective, but above all it just feels like a song intended to rally the masses and make them dance rather than throw a riot. It‚Äôs kinda like pop infused with the attitudes of punk‚ÄîNo, I‚Äôm not calling it ‚Äúpop punk‚Äù for anyone about to blow up my inbox. It‚Äôs a damn good party song for what it‚Äôs worth, and I do enjoy how Rudolf‚Äôs cathartic, bible-loaded verse (‚ÄúNow the son's, disgraced, He, who knew his Father / When he cursed, his name, turned, and chased the dollar / But it broke, his heart, so he stuck his middle finger to the world!‚Äù) happens to be on the same song as one of Lil Wayne‚Äôs obligatory ‚Äòdicking around and having fun‚Äô verses (‚ÄúI can dick you up, I can dick you down‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirty like socks that‚Äôs on the ground‚Äù are some of my favorite cuts here). Also, if you censored this it could be a perfect fit as a soundtrack song to an old Nickelodeon movie that takes place in a school and has a plot containing any form of rebellion. That‚Äôs a good thing. Let it rock, indeed.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song should not work at all. This is a rock song with Lil Wayne and someone who up until a few months ago, I was sure was Kid Rock. But it just works. It's just a fun song with a great hook. Because when **I** ar**RIVE**, **I** I bring the **FIRE** make it **COME** a**LIVE**.

#Let it bop

**Awhile2** (10): waynes first verse on this song is probably the second best rap verse in existence

**frogaranaman** (10): One of THE most hype songs of this year, don't even come at me if you can't rock out to this song.

**ggodisawomann** (10): Kevin Rudolf, wya?

**Mysario** (10): idk how people who didn't experience this era of music feel about this music now, but this was probably one of the better songs on the charts IMO since it feels like a natural combination of everything that seemed to be in a lot of late 2000s tunes: an easy to follow sing a long, a good backing instrumental with guitar, and a Lil Wayne appearance

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Oh Kevin Rudolf, what happened to you?

**PuggleMaster** (10): the 2009 Royal Rumble is ICONIC

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I fucking love this song idc what anyone says and Wayne is hot in the video

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): kevin rudolf came, dropped the greatest song of all time, and promptly left, never to be heard of again

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): ok yep this still bops

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I blew out my voice singing this song at karaoke and I do not regret it for a second, truly one of the biggest bops of all time

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): honestly i heard this on a pacific rim playlist on 8tracks in 2014 or whatever and it's pretty fucking iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song is extremely lit when you are drunk.

**moooo566** (9): this is aggressively 2009

**starla\_** (9): I shamefully love this song

**TragicKingdom1** (9): surprisingly holds up? cash money was kinda winning at this point in history

**vapourlomo** (9): Todd in the Shadows, where is the Kevin Rudolf One Hit Wonderland?? Nobody should disappear off the face of the earth after making such a banger.

**jamesfog** (8.5): BOP!

**hikkaru** (8): I forgot this song existed oh my god

**rslashpoopheads** (8): TBT to when I thought this was rock music because they kept saying the word rock.

**selegend** (8): /u/thereisnosantaclaus this rate is basically our karaoke

**Tchalla1966** (8): BOP!

#Let it flop

**1998tweety** (7.7): This isn't as good as I remembered it, but its rock heavy so I'll give it a better score so I look diverse.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Isn‚Äôt Kevin Ruldof one of those deers that Santa pulls around every time he wants to award you for being naughty or nice? Bad jokes aside, I have no idea who he is, nor what may have prompted Lil Wayne to cooperate with him, but I‚Äôm going to praise this song simply for making Lil‚Äô Wayne sound alive on it. The necromancy worked!

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): This song tries a little too hard in places but I like the pre-chorus and chorus a lot.

**twat\_brained** (7.4): Has not aged as well as the others in this rate, especially those pseudo-English verses from Lil Wayne. How and why was he the biggest rapper of the late 2000s, and in fact one of the biggest names in music, is just mind-boggling to me. Who thought this guy was talented?

**CopyCatJ** (7): RAP IS THE NEW ROCK weezy f baby

**enecks** (7): This bumps, but people losing their shit over this was weird

**MrSwearword** (7): fine for then, meh for now

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): for some unknown reason my mum LOVED this song. Taste is clearly not hereditary. Also, who the fuck IS Kevin Rudolf anyway?

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): https://ibb.co/Hz3c7yx where his eyes

**Roxieloxie** (6): this song could've worked if it was a little bit shorter

**radiofan15** (5.2): Lil Wayne's Rebirth is one of the best albums of the decade... but this song is not on par with that album's quality, a shame because Rock Wayne is a great Wayne

**NotWith10000Men** (5): wayne brought this up from a 4

**xxrandooxx** (5): I was giving this a 7 then Lil Wayne and his disastrous rap came in a tore a hole in this song. I'm sorry Kevin Rudolf.

**pearllouise** (3): meh

**ryjomom** (3): get lil wayne out, now!

**waluigiest** (3): this is unpleasant to me. Lil Wayne gives it a little bit of standing

**wholesomebody** (3): no

**ariannagrandtitties** (2): let‚Äôs banish lil wayne

**tapdancingpig** (2): This song is nothing.

I understand why people might not like it, but I can't help to enjoy it from beginning to end without skipping any track

**ExtraEater**: It's strange how "Mad" seemed to commercially out-peak this song (Mad's position of #42 was higher than its #57 rank on the 2008 year-end too) when I've definitely seen this one around much more, and of course I think it's better. I like it, but this song always irritated me a little because the production feels so... incomplete. Even "Mad" felt complete, likely because it didn't have much to complete to begin with, but I digress. ‚ÄúMiss Independent‚Äù is a rather standard-sounding song as it is, and I guess that‚Äôs fine.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ne-Yo is so underrated. He's got bops for fucking days. Closer, Let Me Love You, So Sick, Let's Go, Time of Our Lives with icon PITBULL! Miss Independent is definitely up there with them as well. Ne-Yo does something that not a lot of "meeting a girl at the club" songs do, and that's give a whole fantasy about her being her own woman before even talking to her. This woman looks like she got everything she need in life. She isn't just beautiful, she has something about her that proves she's confident in herself. And honestly, I love this song.

#I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that mean?

**kappyko** (10): this shit slaps from that badass intro to finish

**Mysario** (10): whatever happened to Ne-Yo?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Yes. Just, yes.

**Roxieloxie** (10): God where did Ne-yo go? can he come back to save pop music

**Tchalla1966** (10): what a beast of a song! He really did that.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): fourth wave feminism found dead

**twat\_brained** (10): I know now why I love this so much; it sounds a lot like Vanessa Hudgens' hit song Say OK; especially the harps and the drums. And color me delightfully surprised to see this song show up in the rate! Since Ne-Yo is both male and black I have low expectations for this song's placement from you guys, but I'm hoping Miss Independent can move up to a Songeniality position at least.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): My first mp3 player had this song as one of the pre-downloadeds track for some reason, so I will never forget this.

**CarlieScion** (9): b o p

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): we love a feminist man

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute feminist bop we STAN

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): We love a man who appreciates independent women!

**jamesfog** (8.5): Remember when Ne-Yo was relevant? (Stream Push Back ft. Bebe Rexha and Steflon Don now)

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): After the unending horrors of EveryGirl In The World, Miss Independent was a pleasant surprise and a huge relief. Now, I‚Äôm not suggesting that Ne-Yo is a shining paragon of feminism or anything, but a song with lyrics that actually respect women? Sign me the hell up! The guy‚Äôs voice is really amazing sung over the smooth and slick groove of Miss Independent, too. All in all, this is definitely where the actually more than decent RnB in the rate begins to arrive.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Really like the melody of this one, it‚Äôs got a really dancehall type flow to it which you can really dance to.

**enecks** (8): Condescending but well intended

**radiofan15** (7.6): Cute and catchy... NE-YO COME BACK AND DELIVER US FROM EVIL (Chris Brown) PLEASE

**mich4725** (7.5): pretty sexy tune

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): I used to hate this but in 2009 this was hella woke and this is cute.

**frogaranaman** (7): You don't know feminism until you hear an all-girls high school prom scream this song at the top of their lungs.

#Definitely a Miss

**MrSwearword** (7): good background music, I'll give it that

**waluigiest** (7): why is this instrumental so tranquil? Great vocals too. The whole message is a little backhanded tho

**ManofOranges** (6.5): This is another cute song but it just doesn't really suit my taste

**ryjomom** (6): I could see this instrumental being a Taylor Swift song

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): good on paper but the main riff kinda haunts me

**hikkaru** (5): Kelly sweetie...

**pearllouise** (5): Kelly Clarkson did it better

**ReallyCreative** (5): It's just a little too boring for me

**ariannagrandtitties** (2.3): miss independent dont need ur crusty ass

**xxrandooxx** (2.3): Yall hear smth?

**ExtraEater**: Sometimes I wonder how people want their lives to be remembered. In the case of the guys behind 3OH!3 and similarly hated groups, I feel like they've damned themselves to both people who hate this song and people who enjoy it. To someone who hates this song, they may see an utterly moronic, mindless, and cynical cash-grab that exists simply as a void and a trap. To someone who enjoys this song a lot, like me, we love the melody and we can bop to it but we don't care for the group who made it, considering how terrible these lyrics are. After all, there's a reason "guilty pleasures" became a thing, although this is certainly just a straight-up pleasure, personally speaking (You can‚Äôt hate the vegetarian lyric, c‚Äômon). Some people make good music that makes us respect them, such as how Janelle and Kacey are praised on this sub to the point where we care about what they do and how they're feeling. I don't think I care about how the guys behind 3OH!3 are doing today, heck I didn't even bother to search anything up about how they're doing while making this writeup. I don't respect 3OH!3 for this song, but I appreciate that they got this amazing and irresistible melody out there, even if it meant sticking on the most ridiculous lyrics possible. Do the Helen Keller, I guess?

**ImADudeDuh**: These guys seem like such douchebags in this song. But you know what? With the surprisingly amazing electro/rock/pop groove throughout the song especially on the chorus, they sell it and it works for them. This song has so many iconic lines, but of course the mother of them all is "if your boyfriend's got beef, tell him I'm a vegeterian and I AINT FUCKING SCARED OF HIM." This song is so fun and I'd give it a full score, but i can not give a perfect score to "do the helen keller and talk with your hips" and expect to go to heaven.

#Who wants the veggie burger?

**Awhile2** (10): my mom wouldnt let me buy this cd because of the vegetarian line. Instead she let me buy an uncensored TI greatest hits album

**CarlieScion** (10): sksksksksksksks

**gannade** (10): they deserved to stay relevant longer. Wouldve been my 11 if it wasnt for that helen keller bridge

**ggodisawomann** (10): I have nothing to say here. this song was just IT.

**hikkaru** (10): this song is so fucking bad

**MashLuke** (10): the boys pop needs

**mms82** (10): such a problematic bop

**Mysario** (10): unfortunately this song probably wouldn't fair well in today's climate, but this bop beat my meat when I was kid

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd categorize this as a ‚Äúguilty pleasure‚Äù but this is fun nonetheless.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this reminds me of sophomore prom. SUCH a bop.

**Tchalla1966** (10): I WILL STAN THIS SONG FOREVER

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this song is THE vegetarian empowerment anthem

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): ok wow

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song is amazingly obnoxious and I don‚Äôt care how stupid it is. It‚Äôll almost definitely be bottom 10 in this rate, and probably for good reason, but it‚Äôs both ironically and unironically one of the best things ever released.

**vapourlomo** (10): The guiltiest guilty pleasure (that Hellen Keller line is especially heinous). But it was the world's warmup for Ke$ha and for that, I will forever be grateful. I can't bring myself to not love it, despite its glaring flaws.

**wholesomebody** (10): unguilty guilty pleasure

**frogaranaman** (9): Reaction gif Twitter is right, that line _is_ one of the hardest lines in music history.

**moooo566** (9): this sucks

**pearllouise** (9): Oh, it's okay. I trust you.

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): so bad it's good

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I hated this the first time I listened to it because of how comfortably it fit into a frat boy aesthetic, but now I love how corny it is to the point where I don‚Äôt even care, much like y‚Äôall. Don‚Äôt Trust Me is, like it or not, considered party music, but it‚Äôs the kind of song where I‚Äôd care more about the people surrounding me than it being played in the background. If they had songs as fun as Don‚Äôt Trust Me, I‚Äôd probably check 3OH!3 out.

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): iconic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.1): this shit has aged like fucking milk, especially the slut shaming, let's be honest, but the sheer iconnery of TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND IF HE SAYS HE'S GOT BEEF I'M A VEGETARIAN AND I AINT FUCKING SCARED OF HIM

**twat\_brained** (8.1): this is what HelloGoodbye would be like if he went to a college fraternity. This is honest to God a song that's so terrible I can't help but dance along and laugh my ass off at the lyrics. "Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips" is practically Shakespearean just for the sheer "how the hell does someone come up with this" factor

**rickikardashian** (8): homeboys truly said that Hellen Keller line‚Ä¶.. wild

**Roxieloxie** (8): another song i skipped on pandora but the "tell your boyfriend" line makes me laugh

**rslashpoopheads** (8): We've reached peak sleaze. Just kidding, there's still Starstrukk.

**waluigiest** (8): all the popular kids at my school listened to 3oh3 and I wanted to be popular so I learned this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): ‚ÄúTell your boyfriend if he says he‚Äôs got beef, im a fucking vegetarian and I ain‚Äôt scared of him‚Äù literally one of the greatest lines in pop music of all time. Also ‚ÄúDo the Helen Keller and talk with your hips‚Äù. honestly these lines make the song better because of how out there they are.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): man this song aged pretty poorly lyrically, but it‚Äôs still a bop. Just a guilty pleasure now.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): it‚Äôs funny bc I‚Äôm actually a vego now

**1998tweety** (7.3): I don't remember this 3OH!3 song at all, I thought their Katy Perry and Kesha collabs were their only hits. This is kind of a mess but the chorus is orgasmic af.

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): honestly trash but "I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fuckin' scared of him" is iconic

**jamesfog** (7): At first I gave this a 8 but then I realized I was thinking of Starstrukk, the superior song. Anyway misogynist slut shaming bop <3

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the vegetarian line is next level iconic

#As a Helen Keller stan, I am offended

**tapdancingpig** (7): Yikes. This bops, and the Helen Keller joke is so stupid it made me laugh, but... yikes.

**radiofan15** (6.3): Cute but vapid and unsubstantial... they peaked with Blah Blah Blah

**bespectacIed** (6): This is totally unrelated but DAE remember their collab with Katy (Strarstrukk) ??? That was a moment I'll never forget, a 10/10 song

**selegend** (6): invented fuckboys

**TragicKingdom1** (6): honestly not as much of a bop as i remember

**ManofOranges** (3): I do not want to comment

**mich4725** (3): difficult to take this group seriously

**ReallyCreative** (3): Everything about 3OH!3 has bothered me. The chorus is pretty fun though. The Helen Keller line is kinda ironically iconic but it's still probably a net negative

**xxrandooxx** (3): This is super demeaning omfg

**enecks** (2): Obnoxious vapidity, thy name is 3OH!3

**starla\_** (2): Shit lyrics and hella annoying

**ryjomom** (1.3): I always trust my hoes, men really aren‚Äôt shit

**ariannagrandtitties** (1): men are shit

**MrSwearword** (1): the chart gods made *them* do the Helen Keller and made the public not see it for them after this shit

**Plasm\_Trojan** (1): I am so glad 3OH!3's career ended as soon as it started, because like every song they've ever made, this song is disgusting.

Awhile2: Nothing much to elaborate tbh.

I got a Best Buy giftcard for my 10th birthday and I really wanted to buy WANT because it was one of my favorite albums at the time. My mom had heard Don‚Äôt Trust Me on the radio though and didn‚Äôt like the I‚Äôm a vegetarian and I‚Äôm not fucking scared of him line so she wouldn‚Äôt let me buy it. They were promoting a TI best of album (‚Äúa king of oneself‚Äù or something) and my mom knew I liked TI so she said I should buy that album instead to support him since at the time he had just gotten his prison sentence for possessing firearms. I had only heard the clean versions of the songs on the radio though so when I got home and put hat cd on my CD player I was incredibly shocked by the amount of times he said the n word

**ExtraEater**: Pure dumbness, so‚Ä¶ a masterpiece. Look, I think that intro is just the craziest thing. Forget the totally dark and captivating way that ‚ÄúPoker Face‚Äù opens, this song‚Äôs first few seconds deserves more attention. I swear, those opening blips sound like you just unlocked the gates to Stupid Dumb Vapid Club Nirvana and the doors slowly open to reveal the one and only Flo Rida delivering his latest masterpiece right into your face and ears. That Dead or Alive sample is so gratuitous that it somehow works, and even though it doesn‚Äôt have any of the infectious Hi-NRG disco beats of the original (which is just as great), Flo Rida‚Äôs energy coupled with the feeling that you‚Äôre slowly blowing your brains out should be enough to make up for it. That ‚Äúfrom the top of the pole‚Ä¶‚Äù refrain, too‚Ä¶ Like, how can one even listen to and criticize the lyrics when the melody here alone should be enough to have you dancing mindlessly? Oh, and did I mention Ke$ha‚Äôs a part of this song? Her talent emerged *very* early.

**ImADudeDuh**: I mean, when you heterosexualize such a gay anthem as "You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)," you're gonna have a real uphill battle to get me to like this. Right Round just doesn't beat it. Flo Rida is an icon with some great bops, but this is basically him to a tee: obvious sample, faceless female singer on hook, generic rapping in between all. It's inoffensive, but that's about it.

---
#Like a record baby (feat. Ke$ha)

**1998tweety** (10): Kesha queenie

**Awhile2** (10): kesha interpolating the hook from a Dead or Alive song may be the closest my dream of hearing Kesha do a cover of Soft Cell‚Äôs Sex Dwarf gets and tbh im only slightly ok with that

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**selegend** (10): a universal anthem about flo rida singing about getting his dick sucked and kesha getting her pussy ate i live

**Tchalla1966** (10): Flo Rida x Kesha the collab we needed and the collab we got

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Everyone's gonna talk about Kesha and how far she's come from this small feature, but the production in the instrumentals/breaks of this song is so good.

**\_wailordfan** (9): If we don't play Lindsey Stirling's cover of this did we even do this rate correctly?

**CopyCatJ** (9): NOSTALGIC reminds me of jumping on my trampoline with my sister

**frogaranaman** (9): I always thought his voice sounded hispanic.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): daddy flo really went off

**hikkaru** (9): the first appearance of QUEEN KESHA on the hot 100, and slapping production

**izeasklapaucius** (9): IT BOP

**JunkyGS** (9): We love the shameless (feat. Ke$ha) they added after she became famous.

**pearllouise** (9): we love a debut from Kesha

**poppinmmolly** (9): this song was in the critically acclaimed, Oscar winning film "The Hangover"

**Mysario** (8.5): MeatSpin

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I distinctly remember going up to the DJ at a middle school dance with my friend to request this song and that is the most 2009 memory I can possibly think of

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this is easy to ironically bop to because the sample actually works pretty well and there's a lot of hooks

**radiofan15** (8.1): I can't believe Kesha got Bebe Rexha-ed before Bebe was even a thing!

**ggodisawomann** (8): wow I forgot about this song! Flo is still a king!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this introduced Kesha to us so it deserves some respect

**MashLuke** (8): kesha's peak

**MrSwearword** (8): cute but not great

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Kesha is the only reason to listen to this song.

**nightjesus** (8): for original track

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): ok apparently there‚Äôs a US version and a much worse international version, and only the international version is on spotify? And yet all i remember hearing as a kid in australia was the US version? This song doesn‚Äôt deserve to be this confusing. Anyway the chorus bops

**enecks** (7): A Flo Rida song is as good as its hook. This has a solid hook, ergo it is good. Honestly I enjoy the verses in this more than usual.

**jamesfog** (7): Ke$ha snapped

**ReallyCreative** (7): This is perhaps the only Flo Rida song I can tolerate, it's a solid bop that has actually aged fairly well, at the same time, it's not necessarily unique or groundbreaking. It's a passable song at the very least though. I just don't understand why Flo Rida insists on using hooks from other songs lmao

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Wait, when did they finally credit Ke$ha with the vocals on this?

**tapdancingpig** (7): I feel like all my positive associations with the song are from the fact that Kesha sounds badass and it‚Äôs use in The Hangover, a movie that, despite being *problematic* frat boy comedy, is genuinely very funny. Flo Rida here doesn‚Äôt do much for me.

**waluigiest** (7): secret Kesha. Good beat and melodies are good, but it‚Äôs so dated

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.8): more ke$ha please

**ryjomom** (6.5): fun, i just wish ke$ha was credited as a feature

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): Gets an extra point bc Kesha

#I invested my life savings into fidget spinners. Please help.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): DO NOT BUY FIDGET SPINNER!! DEATH TRAP Please do not be tempted to buy one of these spinners!!! Caused me nothing but hassle since I bought the fucking bastard thing. It started off ok spinning it round on various fingers listening to the fast rolling ball-bearings spin around. It was quite satisfying and I found faith, peace and harmony in my new fidget spinner. As with anything new you experiment with it so I was pottering round the house spinning it on random shit like the kitchen tap and on top of the salt and pepper grinder, I even span it on top of me cats head he was fucking loving it wagging his tail and smiling. All was well and good I loved this new trendy stress relieving gadget! Until on night i was home alone really really bored out my mind. Girlfriend was at work house to myself yano.. i thought fuck it am gunna do it i lay there on my bed and put the fidget spinner on the end of my knob and gave it a massive spin it was fucking awesome i loved it was going soo fast it looked like my cock was about to fly off to Syria and finally end all this fighting bullshit I was amazed i found a new safe way to use my penis until it all went balls up the ball bearing in the main spinner seized and the spinner stopped dead but because it was spinning so fast previously it gripped and caused friction its left a huge blister on my bell end i cant have a piss or anything i have been to the doctors and he said he has loads of people in Injured by these ‚Äútoys". Share and spread awareness these are out to kill us and it wont be long until it happens!

#Fell for Meatspin as a kid

**twat\_brained** (5.4): ah yes, the classic combination of bottles + models. On the one hand, Flo has chosen worse samples for his music, namely, his butchering of "Blue", and it gave Kesha her first ever #1 song. Then again, that "man" produced this song, so again, my apprehension comes into effect. If anything, at least the dated electropop sound makes me appreciate it as another mindless party jam that isn't trying to be profound or anything

**ManofOranges** (4): Kesha is without a doubt the reason this song was #6 on the list because there's no way people were listening to this for Flo Rida

**NotWith10000Men** (4): sounds really dated now

**xxrandooxx** (4): I'm forever plagued by Alvin and the Chipmunks singing this song

**Plasm\_Trojan** (3.9): I don't really know what to make of whatever this is but I'm pretty sure it's not good...?

**mich4725** (3.5): this has potential to be much better, Flo Rida vocals are bad and so is the beat sometimes

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): I can‚Äôt understand why people think this is iconic. There‚Äôs Kesha, but her appearance here is honestly more of an interesting novelty than something that actually benefits Right Round. I have not found a redeeming feature towards anything else in this song, and Flo Rida, with all due respect, just makes me feel gross. I don‚Äôt feel like going back to this and looking for any thing I like about it, because every time I‚Äôve listened to this I‚Äôve felt nauseous. I‚Äôll bow out now.

**vapourlomo** (3): Although nostalgia has clouded my judgement of the Black Eyed Peas, Flo Rida still sounds absolutely horrible. BEP's lyrics are heinous, but at least they're memorable ‚Äî Flo Rida is just boring.

**starla\_** (2): Cannot stand this abomination of a rework of an 80s classic.

**wholesomebody** (0): this is one of my goto songs for a lame song that's only relevant because of a lazily sampled hook and one of my least favorite songs of the decade

**ExtraEater**: There's something pretty easy to hate about this, what with the uneventful production consisting of maybe the most "shrill" piano I've ever heard and some really basic beats. Still, the melody grabs me, and the vocals are as funny as they are effective. The way she prolongs "The world", "I know", and "this is" sounds like it should be like a cat dragging their nails through a chalkboard but really it's just straight up beautiful. Perhaps I'm too used to discord. Ah, whatever.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ok, i have some fucking history with this song. When I was 11, I would just randomly start singing "I hate this part right here" for no reason other than it would pop into my head. How the fuck am i still in the closet? Nicole has an amazing voice and she pulls off this really well. Her background singers also make for some great harmonies in this. I've loved this song for 10 years, and it just doesn't change.

#tHat part!

**CarlieScion** (10): love it

**gannade** (10): one of the best ballads of all time UGH!

**ggodisawomann** (10): I have fond memories of rolling through the beach listening to this song

**jamesfog** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG!

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): An Underrated gem, I love everything about this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): BRING BACK THE PUSSYCAT DOLLS Nicole‚Äôs vocals are great in this

**twat\_brained** (10): Heard live count - #10 Keep your Don't Chas and your Buttons and your When I Grow Ups. THIS is what I remember when I think of the Pussycat Dolls. The way Nicole is brilliantly able to toe the line between vulnerable and powerful is just brilliant.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): wow the Pussycat Dol- I mean Nicole sounds great here

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): A little stronger instrumentation and this song is a 10, it's a soft bop but a bop nontheless

**1998tweety** (8.4): Emotional bop

**bespectacIed** (8): Hearing this beautiful ballad and seeing the overly airbrushed and sexy album art is so amusing lol. Nicole did THAT in this song

**MashLuke** (8): Nicole and the Diamonds

**NotWith10000Men** (8): this may be the worst album cover of all time

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I really hope this manage to peaks out the Veronicas, to be honest. I still know nothing about the Pussycat Dolls except for every Necki Menij joke about Nicel Shitsinger, though looking at their name I do wonder if there‚Äôs some innuendo involved, but despite the vocals here being a little weirdly processed at times, this is actually a bop and a half. Thank you, girl groups!

**ryjomom** (8): *wendy williams crying*

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): the instrumental gave me life

**radiofan15** (7.5): Don't know why the PD credit when this is basically a Nicole solo track... not that the the other PD songs were group efforts outside of the occasional Melody screw up

**ManofOranges** (7): Nicole Scherzinger deserved better

#I can't take this any longer

**PuggleMaster** (7): I have no memory of this song

**kappyko** (6): girl groups have consistently got the best in pop production, whether american british or fucking whatever it's so unfair. too bad the girls here are mixed like foghorns

**Roxieloxie** (6): this sounds like a DCOM song

**enecks** (4): I hate the parts of pop music history that involve the Pussycat dolls

**frogaranaman** (3): If "this part" is the part where they had to perform this song at their concerts, then yes, I would hate it too.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): not a bop and not much of anything.

**jval888** (2): god i hated this

**pearllouise** (2): Me when this song came on

**waluigiest** (2): what is this

**mms82** (1): eww how did this chart

**MrSwearword** (1): me too, as this is pretty much the worst Pussycat Dolls song that isn't the cover of Feeling Good

**ExtraEater**: I think I have to commend this song's dedication to being "trashy stupid dumb pop" more than a lot of songs here. The biggest indicator of this is how utterly and unabashedly amateur *all* of the vocals are. I prefer "You Make Me Feel..." just for straight up being better, but in this song it's almost as if Cobra Starship and their random feature (no offense to Leighton Meester stans, if you're out there) actually said "fuck it" and decided to record this right in the middle of being drunk from a party (not a bad thing, of course). The story's stupidity is outweighed by its absurdity, and the sheep-like way that the autotuned voice says "Good girls go BAAAAD!!!" alone made me bump this up a point. This could've gone much farther, but at least it made Day 3 instead of being undeservedly dropped off in the Day 1-2 wastelands.

**ImADudeDuh**: Speaking of douchebag edm songs, we have Good Girls Go Bad. Cobra Starship themselves are the wild EDM group from alternative rock label Feuled By Ramen. That itself is wild. I mean, the guy that looks like [this](http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/leighton-concert/leighton-meester-cobra-starship-concert-06.jpg) is trying to tell me he makes the good girls go bad? But guess what? It works again. This song is a motherfucking bop. The fun production and the full commitment to the douche cool guy makes this song work. The only thing that could work against it was Leighton Meester, who has less presence on this song than I do. But, the club boom brought with it some great songs.

#GGGB Reloaded deserves to be rated!

**frogaranaman** (10): This is the song buried deep in your subconsciousness that only resurfaces when you're nearly blackout at the club.

**gannade** (10): this goes off so hard. if the feature wasnt some no name trash (sorry leighton) this would go top 10 EASY.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): i still cant believe this song is real. but god this band.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song just feels so cheesy but who cares it's iconic

**MashLuke** (10): men in pop were killing it back then

**Mysario** (10): this almost got my 11 but then I remembered "Snakes on a Plane" was better

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This Sounds the most like 2009 and it‚Äôs so goddamned great.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): BRING BACK EMO MUSIC AND LEIGHTON MEESTER

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): literally no one: ‚Ä¶ cobra starship: https://www.rocksound.tv/assets/uploads/cobrastarship_header.jpg

**vapourlomo** (10): I'm still waiting for Penn Badgley's trash-pop anthem...

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): did Leighton Meester fulfill the pop girl prophecy? discuss

**bespectacIed** (9): Pop star Blair Waldorf was such a moment

**jamesfog** (9): Cobra Starship > 3OH!3

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Cobra Starship actually made some serious bops.

**1998tweety** (8.6): Ok bop even though its extremely dated

**skargardin** (8.5): whew the throwbacks keep on coming good god

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Not quite as enjoyably obnoxious as Don‚Äôt Trust Me, but still a middle school dance classic

**enecks** (8): GOOD GIRLS GO BAA

**moooo566** (8): this is terrible, i like it

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Leighton walked so Bridgit could‚Ä¶ walk so Maggie could run. I'm not sure who sounds worse here honestly. Checking the liner notes, Kevin Rudolf showing up doesn't surprise me, but Kara DioGuardi definitely does. What's she done lately?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): would bop more if Leighton Meester‚Äôs awful singing didn‚Äôt ruin it occasionally

**kappyko** (7): misogyny bop

**pearllouise** (7): But was their starship meant to fly?

**selegend** (7): lyrics in 2009 were so TRASH lol but leighton meester is a kween and this still bops

**starla\_** (7): Completely forgot this song existed

**ryjomom** (6.9): Pleasantly Surprised

#The Cons of Being a Wallflower

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Maybe I‚Äôd get the hype for this song as a classic if I still wasn‚Äôt annoyed to this day about how metallic its production is and how a goat voice just randomly sounds out ‚Äòbaaad‚Äô right before its drop. I also have no idea who Leighton Meester is. Is she some sort of actress or something? (I know, I‚Äôm young.)

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6): ok lets all agree the only reason this song charted was cause of Blair Waldorf

**tapdancingpig** (5): Idk, I feel like there‚Äôs a good setup for a hook here, but they didn‚Äôt quite know how to finish it.

**izeasklapaucius** (4): it bad

**MrSwearword** (4): limited appeal and whoever told Leighton Meester she could sing is a liar

**ReallyCreative** (4): Extremely meh

**Roxieloxie** (4): there is too much going on here

**waluigiest** (4): annoying

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): so 2009

**radiofan15** (3.2): Why does this sounds like a Lonely Island song without a punchline?

**jval888** (3): so bad though she's lovely

**ExtraEater**: Stadium rock. The onslaught of guitars, the grand whoops and chants, the impassioned vocals, it‚Äôs all there and Kings of Leon deliver. This is the progeny of U2 sitting right here before your very eyes (and ears), formed in what NME calls ‚Äúthe best ‚Äò80s power ballad of 2008.‚Äù For the record, this definitely takes me back to football stadiums and the like because I heard this basically all the time over the loudspeaker at such events. All I gotta say is that they really knew what they were doing because this song totally deserves to be overplayed in its rightful domain: A big-ass stadium. Also, I love that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready‚Äù bridge, as repetitive and seemingly filler-ish as it may seem. Not to mention, it leads nicely into that divine guitar solo just moments afterward.

**ImADudeDuh**: Kings of Leon seemed like they were gonna be *the* rock group for a while, and they kinda were for that grammy's session. This song is one of the reasons why. While I do prefer Sex on Fire, there's no denying this is a great song. It feels so anthemic. I would say this reminds me the most of a Coldplay song, even though their lead singers could not be more different.

#Use Somebody - Natalie La Rose

**Plasm\_Trojan** (11): This song is an actual masterpiece. It also has one of the only good examples of what's been dubbed the "millennial woop," as it actually adds a lot to the song.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): Apparently what the men I date are thinking while we're out together.

**ggodisawomann** (10): a total jam

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is literally so good I feel it in my soul everytime I listen to it

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is just fantastic. No words necessary.

**radiofan15** (10): Caleb Followill can get me pregnant (or at least try several times), he's such a bae... also this song slaps

**Tchalla1966** (10): I miss the Kings ugh this and sex on fire, What a moments.

**ryjomom** (9.2): thank god i went back to church and heard King on Leon‚Äôs gospel

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): i literally went to see them playing at a festival in 2013 solely bc of this song lmfao

**Mysario** (9): "Sex on Fire" was better

**rslashpoopheads** (9): SOMEBADEAHHHHH

**vapourlomo** (9): U2-but-Southern worked surprisingly well!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): The drum break into the chorus is amazing and I love the soaring vocals of the hook, it‚Äôs just kind of sad that Kings of Leon never really approached this song in terms of quality before or since.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this song is euphoric but the production has aged kinda badly for an alt song

**twat\_brained** (8.3): good use of the millennial whoop here, and all around a pretty decent rock tune

**MashLuke** (8): nice record

**selegend** (8): kings of leon, we stan

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): literally no one: ‚Ä¶ kings of leon fans: https://i.imgur.com/do70f30.png

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): so much better than Sex on Fire

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Oh I remember waiting for this song to end on the radio so that we could get to my bops. It‚Äôs fine tho.

**DrunkHurricane** (7): I would probably like this a lot more if the guy's voice weren't so annoying

**jval888** (7): a karaoke staple

**waluigiest** (7): like You Found Me but better in every way.

**xxrandooxx** (7): Not bad...

#Millennial whoops are so entitled these days

**jamesfog** (6): This was never that good

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I used to really love this song but I've since dabbled in a little harder rock and this just sounds kind of bland now

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): It's great on a first listen but its generic sound and even more generic lyrics shine through after being overplayed on the radio for like 5 years.

**moooo566** (5): ugh i just dont get kings of leon

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): At least one person was mad when I revealed my ranking for this entire rate and put Use Somebody at about #80, but if there‚Äôs this much hype for the song then I don‚Äôt get it. Whoever the lead vocalist is, his voice sounds as wheezy as a dad rock singer from the late 80s, and while I think the misty vibe of the song is good it just isn‚Äôt enough to save the song. I sure hope Taylor and Joe didn‚Äôt really meet at a Kings of Leon concert, because then I fear that their relationship would be just as dull as whatever Use Somebody may be!

**pearllouise** (5): Nickelback's understudy

**starla\_** (5): Extremely overhyped

**enecks** (4): Hey, this was one of the songs that led to a rush of mediocre indie rock songs with millenial whoops and questionable framing.

**ExtraEater**: "Obsessed" is among some of Mariah's more funny and gratuitously tacky songs, and I appreciate it a lot. The flagrant Eminem call-out produces some great lyrics, including the "Napoleon complex / bathin' in Windex" line and "I'm the press conference, you're a conversation." Furthermore, that "last man on the Earth still couldn't get this" is just so bizarrely arresting, mainly because it defines and captures Mariah's attitude here more than anything else in the song. I could talk about how honestly ridiculous the grinding autotune-heavy production is, but I think it speaks for itself, very loudly in fact.

**ImADudeDuh**: This song is bad. First of all, there's the autotune. This song is less subtle with the autotune as other songs on the list, but if you have MARIAH CAREY as a singer on the track, you don't need autotune at all. Second, the whole vibe of this song is just being annoying. I know she made this specifically against Eminem, but the diva attitude, that is one of the biggest reasons I hate Mariah. I just can't stand acting like you are better than others and I still have no idea why actively being a bitch makes her so great to her fans. Also, "Why you so obsessed with me?" is the most annoying comeback for people who want to act like they won an argument until "thank u, next" came along.

**Awhile2** (10): is it bad that this is my favorite mariah song

**CopyCatJ** (10): I hate eminem

**gannade** (10): ugh

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): i have subtweeted my enemies with this so fucking many times.

**MrSwearword** (10): a decadent diss track that is one of Mariah's best songs ever

**tapdancingpig** (10): Mariah is one of my faves (check my flair lol), but this song is like a black sheep in her discography. But like, a black sheep with a fucking GORGEOUS set of wool and is really super well groomed.

**radiofan15** (9.8): I can't believe Mariah invented autotune... ugh her vegetarian non-beefing mind

**jamesfog** (9.5): Drag Eminem queen

**ManofOranges** (9.5): This song is really good but for some reason I couldn't help but think that she sounded like Lady Gaga for half the song

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): My apologies to the seven Eminem fans left on Earth, but whether Mariah actually dated Eminem or not, Obsessed is a song strong enough to make her win their beef with each other either way. Though I‚Äôm a bit baffled as to why the Autotune on it was necessary, Obsessed is a great display of the way Mariah combines slick RnB-tinged pop melodies with sassy hip hop lyricism, and these strengths only exemplify how amazing of a roast Mariah achieves. I‚Äôm still bitter over this being her last hit (nobody remembers #Beautiful), but it‚Äôs a good one to go out on.

**pearllouise** (9): SO OH OHOHOH

**PuggleMaster** (9): the auto tune is so bad it's good sksksksksk

**MashLuke** (8.5): campy but funny

**CarlieScion** (8): eminem who

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): if this goes day 3 eminem will release a response album

**vapourlomo** (8): This is just as ridiculous as it should be (bathing in Windex?!?), and that hook is killer.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): This song is awful but I still love it don't @ me

**izeasklapaucius** (7): Mariah - Eminem is the most iconic feud of all time

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I've never listened to mariah before this tbh

#If you like this song, you're delusional

**ReallyCreative** (7): Proof that even Mariah makes mistakes. Her vocals on the back half ALMOST make up for everything though, and the last verse/chorus kinda slap. It's enough to give her a 7 even if I think the rest of the song is more like a 5.

**Tchalla1966** (7): Eminem found dead

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Eminem found dead in a ditch. But seriously this song is more boring than I remember it being which makes me a little sad.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): love the lyrics but the production does not compliment mariah well

**twat\_brained** (6.3): Mariah ENDED Marshall! (just ignore all the #1 singles he's had since 2008) This song it's technically all that well put-together; and it's very of its time, which I can easily tell. On the flipside, that's one of the things I love about it, because I have such a strong nostalgia for 2000s pop culture.

**bespectacIed** (5): Queen of shade, but this was a dry as the eminem feud

**frogaranaman** (5): üë∂

**ggodisawomann** (5): an alright Mimi song

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (5): honestly this song is pretty dissapointing, it didn‚Äôt really go anywhere

**waluigiest** (5): she‚Äôs a queen but this song isn‚Äôt really it

**xxrandooxx** (4.8): Me @ my anxiety

**ariannagrandtitties** (4.2): no one is obsessed with you

**kappyko** (4): bleh. deserves to be higher than eminem at least because of the lyrics but these horns are flat

**Plasm\_Trojan** (3.7): …™  ü…™·¥ã·¥á·¥Ö ·¥á·¥ç…™…¥·¥á·¥ç's s·¥è…¥…¢ ·¥ç·¥è Ä·¥á ·¥ò ü·¥á·¥Äs·¥á ·¥Ö·¥è…¥·¥õ ·¥ã…™ ü ü ·¥ç·¥á ·¥ç·¥Ä Ä…™·¥Ä ú s·¥õ·¥Ä…¥s

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): Eminem: 1. Mariah: 0

**DrunkHurricane** (2): weak diss and sounds like crap. Also Eminem completely obliterated her.

**mms82** (1.5): really boring sorry mimi

**enecks** (1): This is a musical trainwreck. Worst diss track ever tbh. And I hate Eminem more than he hates gay people, so I should be the demographic for this.

**ryjomom** (1): i‚Äôm absolutely not obsessed with this song

**ExtraEater**: Yep, Kanye was a different beast back in the day compared to what we have to put up with today. Now that we have that out of the way, I love that ‚Äútalk and talk and talk and talk‚Äù bridge a lot. Meanwhile, the rest is basically just icy beats and a bunch of autotune to underscore the song with a potent level of emotion. I find it funny how of all the songs in this rate that have been rated before, this has the highest average of them all, and it won its first rate. Before the rate was even announced, I already knew this wouldn‚Äôt have a chance at winning again, especially with Kanye‚Äôs new shenanigans. Still a good song, but yeah, it‚Äôs done its time.

**ImADudeDuh**: Omg we are really rating this song again?! I still have not changed my opinions on this song. The excessive autotune on the hook is pretty meaningless and I feel like the "How could you be so heartless!" is way too melodramatic for me.

---
#How could she be so heartless to poor kanye!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): invented 808‚Äôs and Drake

**MashLuke** (10): amazing record

**MrSwearword** (10): Kanye's GOAT

**Mysario** (10): Kanye's best album, prove me wrong

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A masterpiece. Simple as that.

**radiofan15** (10): As much as I love Kanye, I can't unhear South Park's Gay Fish

**rosecoloreds** (10): the whole album is a masterpiece and that's that

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of Kanye‚Äôs very best pop singles, which is interesting considering it comes from his most personal, depressing album. The hook is easily one of Kanye‚Äôs all-time best, the beat is simple but intoxicating, and I know every single word of the verses. I know Kanye considers himself too good for pop now, but I wish he could put out a radio song this good again and not shit like I Love It.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): autotune snapped

**bespectacIed** (9): Kanye's a douche and 808s might be my least favorite of his projects, but this song and album are so influential in a way that it kinda normalized autotuning in hiphop

**frogaranaman** (9): Did you know? The first open heart surgery was performed in 1893 by Daniel Hale Williams, one of the few black cardiovascular surgeons in the United States at the time.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I wish I had been into hip hop back then so I could have appreciated this song longer

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I feel guilty for liking this because it‚Äôs Kanye and it kind of feeds into the dude‚Äôs casual misogyny, but I can‚Äôt see any other reason why anybody would dislike it. As somebody who‚Äôs not a huge fan of the stuff I‚Äôve heard from 808s, this legitimately executes Autotune so well that I just can‚Äôt help but bop to the entire song despite my misgivings about its artist. Actually, given how controversial Ye is days, I wonder if this‚Äôll get tanked by his recent behaviour our not‚Ä¶

**twat\_brained** (9): I mean for everyone who claims MBDTF is Kanye West at his Kanye Best I wonder how they'd perceive 808s&H. I've never heard a full Kanye album nor do I plan to listen to one, but the panflute is an instrument that only Kanye could make work. Not sure why the video has art of Jetsons characters though

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Probably my favorite Kanye song.

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is ok

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): it's better in the context of the album

**jamesfog** (8): Bop before he went crazy

**pearllouise** (8): One of my favorite Kanye songs

**PuggleMaster** (8): Thank god popheads will drag this for me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZMEdAIRY0

**ManofOranges** (7.5): Cute song but I don't really care for it

#idk the tin man seems to be doing fine

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): the DJ hero remixes are better

**fishingfor8** (7): am i the only one who likes the fray cover better? just me ok...

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): one of the only Kanye songs in my library and one of the only Kanye songs I have ever rated above a 5. I like this one.

**mich4725** (6.5): definitely a fresh track, but the outcome isn't that great.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Make Kanye Great Again.

**waluigiest** (6): this song lacks the brilliant lyrics and production that made kanye such an icon. Not bad but disappointing in hindsight imo.

**Plasm\_Trojan** (5.2): It sounds alright I guess, but I do think the autotune is very overused.

**enecks** (4): This is the worst song in 808's and Heartbreaks. The narrative is so shallow and unlikeable, and the beat is so empty.

**ariannagrandtitties** (1): takes one to know one

**ReallyCreative** (1): This songs escapes my 0 but make no mistake it's one of the worst things Kanye has put out into the world (exempting the past like, 3 years)

**ryjomom** (1): I am heartless for Kanye

**selegend** (1): how many times we gonna rate this

**ExtraEater**: The fierce military guitar beat alone makes this a cut above the rest. Armed with three big stars from hip hop and R&B, this was destined to be a hit. Also lol at the use of "No homo" on the part of the lovely Kanye West.

**ImADudeDuh**: 3 equally iconic artists, 3 different levels of quality imo, and they come together to make a bop! Rihanna's hook lowkey might be my least favorite part of this. Something about her voice in this just feels weird to me and doesn't fit the song whatsoever. Jay-Z and Kanye though, I really like their verses, even though kanye has some odd lines. I just feel like this song works.

---
#Put this shit on Spotify now!

**frogaranaman** (11): This song radicalized me.

**Awhile2** (10): this rate is making me emotional i literally have so many memories attached to most of these songs. Like i vividly remember having a memorial day picnic with my family and someone was blasting this song in the background

**CopyCatJ** (10): I miss this friendship group, all icons

**MrSwearword** (10): collaborative gold

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This one has also been lost to time. What a shame, cause it‚Äôs really good.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): love me some Jay

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of the most stacked singles I can think of, this song is three absolute superstars at the peak of their commercial success and it lives up to that hype in every way. It just feels huge from the beat to Rihanna‚Äôs hook to the verses. Kanye steals the show a bit with one of my favorite guest verses of his, but there isn‚Äôt a single bit of this blockbuster track that I‚Äôd change.

**radiofan15** (9.2): This bitches really did that HUH?

**MashLuke** (9): Rihanna killed it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): when kanye said that thing about the rav 4 i was like heh bc my parents owned a rav 4 lol heh

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i hope kanye's inclusion doesn't tank this because it feels epic despite the beat sounding like a duck quacking

**jamesfog** (8.5): Bop #FreeRunThisTown

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): shout out to nba video makers

**ManofOranges** (8): Pretty good song but ugh it was so hard to find it. Jay Z needs to quit trying to make me get the Tidal free trial I'm not going to do it!

**ReallyCreative** (8): Would be a 9 but -1 point for unironic use of no homo. Rihanna's vocals here are so simple but so potent! Her "Heyyyyayayayayyys" are iconic.

**waluigiest** (8): quack

**Tchalla1966** (7): What a moment in history.

#Run away from this town

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): i worked to hard to find this song legally to listen to it not for it to be a 10

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I was excited when I saw this song on the list, because I‚Äôd only vaguely heard of this song before, and this seemed like such a fantastic collaboration of talented artists, but it ended up falling flat for me. Run This Town isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, but Kanye‚Äôs verse, much as I loathe to admit it, is the immediate standout here; Rihanna‚Äôs vocals fall flat for her contribution to its chorus, and Jay-Z‚Äôs first pretty much flops. I still like it, but, boy, is it a disappointment.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): i feel like despite all the big-names this song could be so much more

**1998tweety** (7.3): This isn't nearly as good as I would've expected a collab from these 3 artists to be.

**izeasklapaucius** (7): kanye and/or no i.d. is a ffreaking genius for sampling an obscure greek prog song and turn it into a bop.

**twat\_brained** (6.3): jesus christ this song is too goddamn long for what it is Rihanna is literally all I care about not kanye's g-string bullshit or whatever gospel jay-z thinks he's delivering. After I hear Love Lockdown I will be glad not to seek out more of Ye's music for myself

**enecks** (6): To quote Ness this song is "OKAY"

**vapourlomo** (6): For late-era Hov, this isn't bad. But as far as Jay-Ye collabs go, I'll take anything from Watch The Throne instead.

**ggodisawomann** (5): another song that was just alright. I appreciate Rih on this.

**pearllouise** (5): I don't vibe with the quacking noises

**tapdancingpig** (5): I like the beat, but... wow Rihanna has come a LONG way vocally from 2009.

**kappyko** (4.5): i just realized das racist kinda ripped off this

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Wow, this did not age well.

**ariannagrandtitties** (1.1): get rihanna away from those crusty-ass men

**ryjomom** (1.1): Run Rihanna Run away from these men

**xxrandooxx** (1): Me when my snowball shop was the most profitable snowbank shop on the blacktop in Elementary school.

**ExtraEater**: Immaturity is totally in style and it is great. I really can‚Äôt imagine this song working in earnest, and I don't imagine it was ever in complete earnest for as long as they were writing it. The band‚Äôs lead vocalist said this song is a ‚Äútongue-in-cheek way‚Äù of looking at someone you hate, mentioning examples like your mom or your teacher, or in other words, those exact targets you hate when you‚Äôre a petty, young teenager. The joke writes itself. Also, rather than a named person, this song is about someone who doesn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs about them in the first place. It‚Äôs kinda pulling a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre So Vain‚Äù by Carly Simon but even more playful than that. When he says ‚ÄúTruth be told, I miss you‚Ä¶ And truth be told, I‚Äôm lying!‚Äù I won‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm caught in a loop for a bit; ‚ÄúSorry not sorry‚Äù has never sounded better than in this song. There‚Äôs the bridge, too: How about when he says ‚ÄúYou can look me in the eyes‚Äù and his voice starts to quiver just a tiny bit? To anyone who gave this a low score‚Ä¶ well, you know the line.

**ImADudeDuh**: This is the kiss off anthem Thank U Next wishes it was. This song is a big fuck you to your ex. They drag her career, her wealth, her fake sadness, everything about her. I love how on the bridge, there's still a twinge of sadness where she really did hurt him :( but he moved on :), and if this is what they made without her, they definitely won here.

#Found a man that's worth a damn!

**\_wailordfan** (10): For some reason, my local radio station only played this song at night, same with Avril Lavigne's What the Hell. I think they were scared to play it during the day and have our conservative listening base complain about the song.

**ggodisawomann** (10): oh wow this was my shit

**izeasklapaucius** (10): love it.

**kappyko** (10): Dated as HELL, but I got my life to this while imagining Nintendo characters singing it in elementary school okay

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Such a good song to sing at karaoke, invented rock music.

**tapdancingpig** (9): I miss the times when this song would come on the radio and the world would collectively scream it together.

**twat\_brained** (8.9): Of all the things I remember about this song the bridge isn't one of them. I remember the chant though. All in all GYH has aged pretty well, but it will never hold a dime to Move Along in my opinion

**1998tweety** (8): I remember I have a specific reason for not liking this song in the past but I can't remember it right now.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): bangs

**jamesfog** (8): Didn't know this song was so big, but slay. Glee slayed it aswell

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): is there a single straighter song than this one?

**vapourlomo** (8): The all-time petty anthem.

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): This song actually has a special place in my heart because one of my Mom's friends got left at the altar basically by her fiance and this was one of her power anthems to come back from that. The bitch dressed as a bride with a knife in her back for Halloween that year too. I feel like this song helped that happen so it gets bonus points despite not being the most amazing thing to come out of 2009.

**MashLuke** (7.5): clean and thats about it

#Sounds like H*ck

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7.5): this was one of the weaker AAR songs, even in 12 year old me‚Äôs mind

**moooo566** (7): ive really gone off it lately

**TragicKingdom1** (7): too repetitive but i like the slow build

**waluigiest** (7): I‚Äôve performed this song with a recorder choir

**radiofan15** (6.5): Rachel Berry outsold

**ariannagrandtitties** (6): gets better as the song goes on

**bespectacIed** (6): Really loved this song before but now I kinda find it corny.

**frogaranaman** (6): This song is simultaneously is trying so hard and not trying at all to be as white as possible.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): i need songs from 2009 to make me feel like im gonna pass out and this doesn't do it. banger tho.

**skargardin** (6): Never heard this before tbh. It was alright.

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): this song peaks at "where's your picket fence lOvE"

**enecks** (5): Wow this is inane petty and cliched but every now and then the hook HITS for me

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Maybe this is another one of those songs that I was born too late for, huh? I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to go listen to this again and give it another chance instead of judging it as a badly produced rock song that went along with contributing to the genre‚Äôs eventual decline on mainstream charts, but I don‚Äôt feel like going through hell (ha, ha) again.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I definitely do not remember this being the 10th biggest song of the year but ok.

**ExtraEater**: Leading Britney's Singles Collection is "3", which I have to consider a Britney classic through gritted teeth. I think "3" is significant to Britney and fitting for a greatest hits lead frankly because it shows how much she's lost steam, and I say this as someone who likes this song, most of Femme Fatale, most of Glory, and "Work Bitch" quite a bit. As good as "3" is, this basically shows Britney is powerful enough to pull off a song this basic and just plain reductive for Britney standards. I like to think "3" could've hypothetically been some random one-hit wonder's hit, and the pop community would embrace it and consider it underrated long after the one-hit wonder's time is over. It was initially a little surprising to find out this came from Britney, honestly. But hey, I genuinely enjoy it a lot, so I can let that go. It's called "3", but it doesn't really deserve actual 3's in a funny reference to the title, you guys. Also, "3-Way (The Golden Rule)" is shaking!

**ImADudeDuh**: This is one of Britney's number ones? Hmmmm.... Lowkey this is like another generic Britney song, nothing seperates it too much from the rest of her discog post blackout. I will say, the hook on this is extremely catchy though!

**MashLuke** (10): hot

**Mysario** (10): fact, 100% of Britney singles pre-2010 are undeniable bops

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Bi anthem.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I probably like this song too much, but it‚Äôs SO CATCHY! And it hits my personal auto tune sweet spot.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I can‚Äôt believe a loosey by Britney charted at #1 over so many other songs by your favs! Her mind!

**1998tweety** (9): Iconic sexual bop

**radiofan15** (9): QUEEN OF COUNTING, Sesame Street found dead on the dead hours spot of HBO

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (9): This is honestly one of britney‚Äôs best songs, it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs only a single

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): why are there so many songs in this rate that count to 3

**waluigiest** (9): loving the extreme‚Ä¶. Now are you? Gay?

**twat\_brained** (8.8): inb4 "ImADudeDuh (3): lmao i'm glad it's called 3 because it deserves a 3" There are too many elements preventing it from being a 10, or even a 9 for that matter, but it's a guaranteed mood booster and it makes me jealous of everybody here who has experienced a menage a trois.

**bespectacIed** (8): The Peter Paul Mary devil's threeway representation is so important

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): its weird but im never going to give 2009 britney a hard time, sis went off

**hikkaru** (8): fine, but the Circus songs in the rate are better

**ManofOranges** (8): cute song about a three way love that

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i used to like this a lot more but honestly Womanizer does this kind of slutbop a lot better

**PuggleMaster** (7): oh this has potential to win too

**ryjomom** (7): Surprised this went #1 on Billboard

#3/10

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): one of Britney‚Äôs weakest singles tbh

**NotWith10000Men** (4): annoying

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): This song haunts me for confidential reasons that I‚Äôm sure at least one of the rate hosts knows about. My big problem with it is that it‚Äôs a perfect example of how dead shock culture‚Äôs been recently. This isn‚Äôt to say that controversy in pop music wasn‚Äôt a thing in 2009, of course (Gaga is literally right up there) but Britney singing in a robotic Southern accent about how cool threesomes are is not as exciting as the likes of Toxic or Gimmie More. 3 aims to arouse its listeners, but at the risk of saying something illegal here I‚Äôm not even attracted to the song itself.

**xxrandooxx** (4): Britney counted to three and said ‚Äúwow i can make a song about this‚Äù

**enecks** (3): Thanks for giving me a good score to give this Britney! Wow what a mess

**fishingfor8** (3): i don't like this song

**frogaranaman** (3): The funniest part is I actually don't like this song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): How and why did this debut at number one?

**pearllouise** (3): [See what I did there?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Maspo1z34)

**Plasm\_Trojan** (3): haha get it 3 because that's what the song is but 3 because it sounds bad and that's an appropriate score

**selegend** (3): my least fave botney single

**jval888** (2): how could this be number 1 and not all the others!

**ExtraEater**: This song definitely came around for me. It bored me for the longest time, but it clicked just in the nick of time for the rate. The beat is big and galactic, and Keri's "knocks you down" chorus really knocks on my boots. Ne-Yo's performance is maybe among his best and most memorable performances ever, especially with that really well-placed "Miss Independent" reference. Kanye is there like he usually is, but he's still a total element of fun for as long as he's here.

**ImADudeDuh**: Another bop with kanye! Keri, even though I have no idea who she is, she still has some a good voice. I love the extra vocals in the chorus. Also, Kanye falling down and shattering in a million pieces in the music video is iconic, and especially iconic in the DJ Earworm mashup, which still hasn't shown up yet!

---
#Deserved to outpeak Beyonce

**1998tweety** (10): A MASSIVE bop, iconic too.

**bespectacIed** (10): Why did the hive had to drive Keri off the face of the earth, she had bops :( Anyway this song still sounds fresh and amazing to me, especially with its infectious snare/trap beats.

**kappyko** (10): i love the drum sounds on these songs. ne-yo and keri hilson are the dream team aegjeajg MISS I NDEPENEDENT

**MashLuke** (10): amazing song, so smooth and clean.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I think this one has been lost to the sands of time, which is a shame because this is a really good love song.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of my favorite pop songs! Kanye‚Äôs guest verse is the highlight to me, a close second for his pop verses behind American Boy. Keri is awesome of course on her own, and Ne-Yo holds his own too. It‚Äôs just a perfect combination, with an iconic hook.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): One of the most fantastic gems that I‚Äôve discovered from this rate. Keri‚Äôs voice is sleek and smooth across this magnificent song, and Kanye and Ne-Yo‚Äôs guest verses are also incredibly enjoyable, with Ne-Yo name-dropping Miss Independent being a highlight. Considering this is in the Top 20 of 2009‚Äôs Year End, it‚Äôs woefully underrated.

**jamesfog** (9): Her best song

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Radio queen.

**starla\_** (9): I still jam to this on the regular

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Ne-Yo was right. So Sick and Miss Independent were JAMS! He was commander-in-chief of the R&B scene for a time in the mid-to-late 2000s. That said, I dread to imagine what Kanye as commander-in-chief would be like. And for once, he seems to be one of the weaker links in a collaborative song. His verse is pretty good, I'll admit, but if this was just a duet with Keri and Ne-Yo I think it'd be a 10.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): still sad that the beyhive destroyed Keri because she has bops

**Awhile2** (8): god kanye used to be so cool

**ggodisawomann** (8): another song I forgot about! Keri Hilson come back!

**Roxieloxie** (8): is this the lady that beyonce killed

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I love the instrumental on this one

**waluigiest** (8): nice structure, good chorus

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): Ne-yo referencing his own hit on another hit is the most 2000s thing ever.

**radiofan15** (7.3): OMG she sounds a lot like Beyonc√©... maybe that's why the Beyhive destroyed her, because there can only be one Supreme at any time

**Mysario** (7): idk why I never was a big fan of this song

**NotWith10000Men** (7): never heard this song before! I like

**selegend** (7): singlehandedly ended beyonce

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): BRING BACK KERI HILSON

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (6.5): this song musn‚Äôt have gotten big in australia cause this is the first time I‚Äôve heard it outside of the DJ earworm remix. It didn‚Äôt leave a favourable impression

**enecks** (6): why did people feature Kanye on anything - his guest verses were awful

**hikkaru** (6): this is too long

**pearllouise** (6): I love Taraji P. Henson

**imasalesman** (5.5): this felt like an eternity listening to this

**ariannagrandtitties** (5): nice harmonies

**frogaranaman** (5): I want to be knocked out and finally have a good nap.

**ManofOranges** (5): Kinda boring

**MrSwearword** (5): I suppose it has good production but it's just not a song worth many if more than one or two listens

**skargardin** (4): idk this never really went anywhere?

**TragicKingdom1** (4): why is this over 5 minutes long

**ReallyCreative** (3): What the fuck even is this

**ryjomom** (1.2): Keri has a nice voice but the features and lyrics are 90 cent walmart white bread

**ExtraEater**: The anthemic chants of "I do not hook up" and just this whole pop rock instrumental very strongly remind me of Disney music from around this time, particularly Camp Rock and similar media. That is, of course, a very good thing.

**ImADudeDuh**: Kelly Clarkson is an icon. Kelly Clarkson in a pop rock song is fucking euphoric. I wish she would just go back to making this great kind of music instead of whatever was on most of meaning of life. Kelly maintains that she is a woman who is NOT looking to be a one night stand kind of girl. She does NOT hook up. Her voice? Iconic as always, this is why we stan.

#Kellegend Clarkson

**gannade** (10): kellegend clarkson

**Mysario** (10): I love cheap thrills

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**poppinmmolly** (10): okay an ANTHEM because I don't hook up either, Kelly!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): ok i need to know if anyone else hears kelly scream "I FUCK DEEP" in this song please tell me it's not just me

**ariannagrandtitties** (9.5): queen

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I miss pop rock

**jamesfog** (9.5): Katy Perry written bop!

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Those first lyrics are literally Ally and Jackson in A Star is Born. I'll also admit, the millennial whoop starts to turn into the new Four Chords of Pop the more and more I hear it. All I Ever Wanted-era Kelly was sensational, though, and it feels like this was her last true "rock" era, if that makes sense. It was a sound that worked for her, I'd love for her to return to it for her next album. Just checking the liner credits, it says Katy wrote this. Katy and Kelly should team up for a rock-sounding tune, I'd love to hear it!

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Gays are shook

**ryjomom** (9): Asexual Mom

**TragicKingdom1** (9): underrated, this gets compared to Waking Up In Vegas a lot but it's definitely on par with that song

**waluigiest** (9): damn this slaps! I wish I‚Äôd heard this song before I turned into a massive hoe.

**1998tweety** (8.8): I relate with this

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Underrated bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): kelly haters do not interact

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Looking in the credits and finding out Katy wrote this was not surprising in the slightest. It definitely gives me One of the Boys type vibes and in a good way. I may have given this a higher score if Katy herself sung it though.

**kappyko** (7.5): kind of a "not like the other girls" thing but kelly does rock well

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I like the hook where she tells whoever this song is addressed to to put his bottle down, but I‚Äôve seen some Kelly stans hype this up and I really don‚Äôt get why there‚Äôs such a love for it. It‚Äôs a run-of-the-mill pop rock song that doesn‚Äôt do much, and I hope everyone agrees that My Life Would Suck Without You is a much better Kelly standout from 2009. I‚Äôm not actually surprised Katy co-wrote this, though. It sounds like a weaker version of the best standouts from One of the Boys. Waking Up In Vegas comes to mind.

**radiofan15** (7.5): We love a Top 20 hit co-written by Queen Katy Perry

#Stop slut shaming

**pearllouise** (7): Chinese water torture lady is back at it again

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): me singing this in 2009 thinking I‚Äôd never have a one-night stand

**xxrandooxx** (6.2): Demi-Sexual Queen

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (6): seriously, who writes Kelly Clarkson's song titles?

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): i love kelly but why is her discography kinda annoying

**enecks** (5): This was the moment Kelly wanted to be like "I do not make good songs" in her career

**MrSwearword** (5): Kelly has better songs to her name, cut and dry

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): This is...not her best work.

**frogaranaman** (4): Gays adamant about monogamy whenever they hear the slightest mention of an open relationship.

**ggodisawomann** (4): this is sub-par Kelly for me

The lyrics are nice although this sample just doesn‚Äôt work, and there‚Äôs not much else of substance to this song. Anyway, the most notable thing about this is how serendipitously well it fit into the DJ Earworm mashup.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ain't got NO time for no handjob! Also, this is another obvious sample, but I will give this credit for sampling a song that became a fucking meme and still having the balls to use it in a serious song.

#Chasing the paper

**1998tweety** (10): A MASSIVE bop, Rih is the queen of autotuned pop hook collabs with rappers

**bespectacIed** (10): One of Rih's best number 1s. That explosive and anthemic chorus, the banger verses, and of course, the interpolation -- this is pop-hip-hop perfection.

**enecks** (10): This works so much better than you'd think. Every element - Rih, T.I., the sample - works

**mms82** (10): what a beautiful song- peak rap/song collabs

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**PuggleMaster** (10): this only gets a 10 for Rihanna's iconic chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Legends only.

**Tchalla1966** (10): T.I really snapped with these songs holy damn

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This might be the single greatest Rihanna feature and that‚Äôs really saying something

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): I love T.I.'s little comments that he gives before his songs

**ryjomom** (9.3): Sick Beat and Rihanna is always a plus

**ignitethephoenix** (9): T.I really had some of the most iconic hooks on his songs in the 2000‚Äôs

**jamesfog** (9): Blassic

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I cant believe Panic! At the Disco [ripped them off.](https://youtu.be/UMPx9q_zNaM)

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I‚Äôm not sure why Rihanna‚Äôs voice sounds so flat and processed on this and Run This Town, especially when I take into account that Disturbia is on this Year-End, but I don‚Äôt exactly have any major nitpicks when it comes to Live Your Life. T.I does a pretty damn good job here, but what elevates it all is the glorious ‚Äòmaya hee, maya ho‚Äô hook that accompanies him and Riri. That hook was all it took for me to deem Live Your Life as excellent.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): GOT MY MIND ON MY MONEY, AND I‚ÄôM NOT GOING AWAY, we love a prophetic queen

**radiofan15** (8.9): I don't know how they made that sample work this well but i'm not complaining, this is still fantastic after so many years

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.5): myayayayyay ahhahayyahayayya

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): T.I. had some really good pop singles in the Paper Trail era, although getting both Justin Timberlake and Rihanna in two of their best eras definitely helps. This song is a bit too long but it‚Äôs catchy and super likeable.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i love rap that feels grand and bombastic like this

**hikkaru** (8): 2006 YouTube and Rihanna both snapped, but T.I. didn't really. EH EH, EH EH, EH EH

**MrSwearword** (8): basically because Rihanna can play hook girl but the less said about this, the better

**ReallyCreative** (8): This song isn't that bad, Rihanna is amazing and it's generally just fun. T.I. isn't great or anything but he's listenable so that's nice

**frogaranaman** (7): Whenever haters say that Rihanna doesn't support gay rights, I point them to this song so they can FEEL the ally energy this song has. üò™üçµ

**ggodisawomann** (7): teenager anthem

**jval888** (7): numanuma yeeeeee

**ManofOranges** (7): The sample kinda of scares and disgusts me at the same time but still not a bad song

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): omg i never realised this song sampled the numa numa song

**vapourlomo** (7): Sampling the numa numa song was a brilliant move. And Rihanna, unsurprisingly, delivers a killer hook.

#nu mƒÉ, nu mƒÉ, nu mƒÉ

**twat\_brained** (6.2): As great a boyband sample as Ariana pulled off, we can't forget this classic. Actually, is it a classic? Seems like more of a cheap cash-in on an internet meme more than anything. It went #1, so I guess we were into that. And Baby Shark is still pretty popular, for whatever reason. Not sure what to make of it

**ariannagrandtitties** (6): rihanna is the only redeeming factor of this song

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I think my love for this song is mostly nostalgia and the fact that I know a lot of the words

**selegend** (6): rihanna singing over a numa numa sample lmao

**CarlieScion** (5): Dragostea Din Tei outsold

**pearllouise** (5): The least-likely sampling I would ever expect Rihanna use

**Plasm\_Trojan** (5): This is... a really weird thing to sample.

**kappyko** (4): what was the obsession with euro-dance in 2009? what were we going through?? fake horns aside theres a cool synth organ melody in the right channel but it all feels so flat and compressed into a box. rihanna is this song's saving grace. and its 6 minutes

**waluigiest** (3): why did they do that to rihanna

**xxrandooxx** (2.5): They didn't do ma ya hi justice, At least Rihanna is in it

**mich4725** (2): if anything I prefer the original which still is far from great. This version just doesn't do anything for me.

**tapdancingpig** (2): Rihanna is giving me nothing here. This just sounds kind of boring.

**ExtraEater**: This grew on me a whole lot. I grew to appreciate the jilted autotune, the odd production quirks, and even both instances of that ridiculous "awooo" in the chorus. There's a minor element of funk in some of those instrumentals, and the chorus is just so fun to listen to. I'd even say this is a perfect disco throwback that also manages to match the mood of 2009 (Q: What's the mood of 2009? A: Well, if you know you know).

**ImADudeDuh**: What in the world. This is just so weird. Shakira with this vocal production is one of the biggest choices in Shakira's career, right next to not paying taxes. She definitely does give the energy for this, but her little "Uwu" in the chorus feels lifeless to me. Furries deserve more tha- actually idk if they really do.

#Getting my caffeine fix

**enecks** (11): Is this the sexiest song put on record? Maybe so. The bass-heavy, ethereal, funky instrumental for this isn't what you'd expect for a sexy song. As is the vocal effects used. But this adds to an unusual, alien vibe that highlights the inherent eroticism of the lycanthropic she-wolf fantasy. And Shakira - she who demanded Gazelle have more hips (https://ind.pn/2GjXsK3) is the perfect presence to convey this furry wet dream. This is art. This is Yiff. PM me furry yiff please I beg you.

**1998tweety** (10): Shakira is the queen, bopped to this so much when I was younger but now whenever I see the video I think of disgusting gifs.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Underrated bop

**jamesfog** (9): https://i.imgur.com/A5ynlZ7.gif

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): A bop and a half.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I shouldn't like this song but there's something about it that feels fun and bad in a good way. The half-hearted awoos make me laugh every time. The instrumentation is actually pretty incredible though, the Latin/Disco blend is infectious and even though I feel like Shakira's holding back a bit vocally on this track, it's very cohesive and a nice listen.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): I feel sorry for whoever‚Äôs gonna host this rate on the day She Wolf goes out, because y‚Äôall will have to face a mob of raging furries. Good luck! As a person not in that demographic, I feel weird about the first big single from a main pop girl on this Year-End. Some parts of She-Wolf are delightfully cheesy, like the coffee machine line and Shakira‚Äôs infamous howl, but I‚Äôm not a fan of how the tax-evading legend‚Äôs vocal are processed in this hit. I‚Äôll leave it in the closet for now.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): kinda terrible but also kinda iconic

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Disco? In MY Top 40 radio?

**NotWith10000Men** (3): I like the verses, HATE the chorus

**tapdancingpig** (3): This song sounds like nothing to me. I like Shakira usually, so I‚Äôm kind of sad I‚Äôm giving this score.

**ExtraEater**: Call me crazy, but when I hear this the first other song I hear in my head is Demi Lovato's "Made in the U.S.A." instead of "Halo", but of course I still totally see the connection to "Halo". That note aside, "Halo" is amazing and a second-rate rendition of an amazing song is still good 70% of the time. Obviously, I will never ever seek this out in favor of "Halo", but I enjoy having to hear it now.

**ImADudeDuh**: Ryan Tedder, you icon. Song so good he had to give it to 2 mfing ICONS. This literally only loses a point for being an obvious rip off, but it's great besides that. Kelly's vocals are on full display here and it's just a showcase as to why she won American Idol and become the person to set that bar that no one has really surpassed from any other singing show.

---
#I want you to know, that this sounds like Halo

**imasalesman** (10): I love Halo 2

**jamesfog** (10): This and Halo are both timeless classic masterpieces. Fume about it.

**MrSwearword** (10): sure it was involved in a "controversy" that shocker, revealed Ryan Tedder is a lazy bitch and a mostly terrible songwriter. However, much like Halo, this song slays so much.

**pearllouise** (10): Outsold Halo

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): halo shaking

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): slightly better songwriting than Halo but doesn't go off as much at the end

**1998tweety** (8): lmao I thought this song sounded similar and then I realized it was Halo

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The funny thing about Already Gone is that it and Halo are ain the same rate. The sad thing about it is that even if both songs are basically the same thing, Already Gone is my preferred pick out of the two due to having better production, and I probably have to thank the shadiest doctor since Andrew Wakefield for that small benefit. *checks Wikipedia* Wait, Ryan Tedder produced this? Oh, thank God. Ryan Tedder may have murdered a baby for all I care but at least he‚Äôs not Dr. Luke. So, yeah, Already Gone is better than Halo. Ta-ta, suckers.

**ryjomom** (8): Halo literally did it first

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): okay controversial but I like this better than Halo

**radiofan15** (7.2): As much as I feel bad for Kelly being screwed by Ryan Tedder and his self-plagiarizing ass I have to admit that I prefer 'Halo'

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Just copy and paste my Halo comment since this song is just a copy and paste of Halo

**rickikardashian** (6.8): Halo: Electric Boogaloo

**bespectacIed** (6): Halo outsold

**jval888** (5): if not for halo would have been such a hit thanks ryan tedder

**vapourlomo** (5): ...it's just Halo. I know that's Ryan Tedder's fault, not Kelly's...but it's the exact same song.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**PuggleMaster** (10): this sounds like one of my favorite Leona Lewis' songs

**selegend** (10): kelly deserves all her songs in the top 10

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): 12 year old me was SHOOK when this shit dropped my god

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I see you Ms. Clarkson, I see you

**CarlieScion** (9): q u e e n

**tapdancingpig** (9): I still like this song a lot, even with that weird bullshit that happened with Ryan Tedder

**NotWith10000Men** (8): such a strong voice

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): ryan tedder is THAT INDIVIDUAL

#I've already left

**frogaranaman** (6): The production for this song was really phoned in, huh?

**twat\_brained** (6): I love Kelly but I expect more from her and from Ryan Tedder. Then again this was when songs like Secrets and All The Right Moves were big so I'm not that surprised.

**waluigiest** (6): I thought I already rated Halo?

**xxrandooxx** (6): Wow Kelly wrote a song about my serotonin.

**ExtraEater**: Okay, what‚Äôs this doing in a *2009* rate? Like, if you told me this came out any time from 2011-2015 I would‚Äôve believed you, but it seems night feels moody hip hop has been riding the airwaves since 2009 (technically this came out in 2008, but whatever). Pair a minimal, hypnotic beat with some vivid nocturnal lyrics and you‚Äôve got me hooked. The fact this came from the late 2000s makes me imagine what it was like at the time. This one sounds ripe for skipping out on the boring middle school dance to chill in your bed with all the moody lights on to this song. And I hope people don‚Äôt hate that outro (a beat switch? definitely ahead of its time! /s), because it is heavenly and a great way to close out the fever dream.

**ImADudeDuh**: Unironically, really ahead of it's time. Kid Cudi made this song and almost invented a brand new feeling. This song just sounded like nothing else from the mainstream rap of the rest of this year. I'm not too big of a fan of it, but I can definitely give immense respect to this song.

---
#LEGALIZE IT!

**enecks** (10): This is an actual masterpiece. It's been influential yes, but it still has an advantage with how well produced and emotionally honest it is.

**frogaranaman** (10): Always have a soft spot for one of my introductions into modern rap.

**ManofOranges** (10): Literally a superb song nothing else needs to be said

**MashLuke** (10): both the remix and the normal version are incredible

**mich4725** (10): disgustingly insane tune, would be my second 11 if I was allowed to

**MrSwearword** (10): too bad his career went downhill after this because it's very good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): F*ck you! The cudster is the best fucking thing to happen in human history so far. And that will likely never change. I cannot begin to understand what could go so wrong in someone‚Äôs life to make them spout such ignorance. Maybe the subtleties are going over your head? You sick fuck, how dare you. Cudi‚Äôs lyrics have transcended the standard of human communication. He is quite frankly the closest thing we have to a prophet (along with Kanye), and we have proof that he exists! Have you heard pursuit of happiness, mojo so dope, mr ranger, soundtrack to my life or most recently Ghost Town (mind you, you are literally in a fucking sub dedicated to the greatness of Kanye who is the artist behind the masterpiece ghost town). I‚Äôm honestly quite baffled at how uncultured you are. It‚Äôs amazing actually, that you typed this out, read it over and thought yea this comment is worth posting. Are you just trolling, looking for a reaction or are you actually this dillusional? Either way it is just down right disgusting and i think you ought to look into a mental evaluation ASAP! All I can say is that I wish you the best in life and you certainly won‚Äôt get the reaction that you‚Äôre baiting for out of me. How fucking dare you

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I doubt this will do too well in this rate because it‚Äôs more downtempo and sad, but honestly this song was ahead of its time. A song about getting high to cope with your depression was kind of novel in 2009, but now its half of the Hot 100. What‚Äôs also sad is that Kid Cudi had so much potential, and after his first two albums he pretty much entirely fell off in quality until last year.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Good song but I swear all people used to play is the remix with the sirens all the time.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): why wasn't Man on the Moon in the rate with 808s and Take Care tbh !

**twat\_brained** (9.4): This song is such a goddamn mood. I've only ever smoked weed twice before in my life but I need to get my hands on some, I know it'd do me a world of good

**bespectacIed** (9): CLASSIC CUDI

**izeasklapaucius** (9): classic cudi me likey

**Mysario** (9): I didn't smoke the mad kush when this dropped but it just reminds me of getting high

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): A song about a stoner who‚Äôs also depressed? This hits a bit too close to home.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): love the lyrics

**rosecoloreds** (9): only bc i prefer the remix

**vapourlomo** (9): MUAH MUAH

**waluigiest** (9): beautiful

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I should really roll my eyes at Kid Cudi whining about being a lonely stoner, but even if the lyrics to Day ‚Äòn‚Äô Nite are sort of laughable when you look at them I can‚Äôt help but love the song‚Äôs production and flow a lot. Can something I enjoy this much be a guilty pleasure?

**Plasm\_Trojan** (8.2): This is a damn good song.

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): i dont particularly care for this song but the melody is memorable

**1998tweety** (7.7): This is ok

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.3): cudi had to do it to us huh

**radiofan15** (7.2): I prefer the remix but this is nice too

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Before its time, honestly.

#Bad trip

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (7): this song isn‚Äôt bad, but it‚Äôs also kinda missing something

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): It's okay I guess, repetitive though

**letsallpoo** (6): WHY DOES HE SAY "NIKES" THAT WAY

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): the remix is superior

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): this sounded better in middle school

**jamesfog** (5.5): Meh

**ggodisawomann** (5): this song is just okay

**ryjomom** (3): not bad, i guess?

**selegend** (3): not the remix the radio played so bye

**ariannagrandtitties** (2): boring

**CarlieScion** (2): the vine is better than the song

**ExtraEater**: Y'know, I think I prefer this over OneRepublic's "Love Runs Out" just years later. One thing I liked about "Love Runs Out" over this song is that the production was a little more fiery and energetic. Still, this song's fairly sparse beat/piano/drum combo is an infectious and slick alternative that outpaces OneRepublic's fare (disclaimer: OneRepublic still makes bops I‚Äôm not dragging them). Plus, I love the autotune.

**ImADudeDuh**: Kanye's best song of 2009, Love Lockdown finally got it's revenge on Heartless since the Hip Hop GOATs rate. And I've always preferred this to Heartless. One thing that caught me about this song is the building of the drums in here. I feel like the reason I like the autotune more on here than on Heartless, is because it feels like this song was written with the autotune in mind, whereas on Heartless it just feels tacked on. And I'm probably super wrong about that and some kanye fan will read this and complain about someone having this opinion in some kanye groupchat, but as vine once said, that's my opINIOOOOOOOOOOON!

#LOVE lockdown

**izeasklapaucius** (11): please take your meds :(

**enecks** (10): Hey, it's the tightest pop song Kanye ever made

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is how you do autotune correctly. Also the drums are iconic.

**MashLuke** (10): I love this song

**pearllouise** (10): Second best Kanye song after Runaway

**radiofan15** (10): One of the best lead singles of all time FIGHT ME ON THAT ONE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): hip hop fans in 2008 be like yeah i listen to emo

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Very high on my list of favorite Kanye songs. The soft but catchy piano riff somehow mixes perfectly with the pounding drums and Kanye‚Äôs pained delivery. It‚Äôs a showcase of the beautiful lightning in a bottle style of 808s in the best way possible.

**vapourlomo** (10): I understand why Heartless was the bigger hit, but Love Lockdown is a masterpiece.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): The fucking percussions, man

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.3): :(

**NotWith10000Men** (9): iconic drums

**Tchalla1966** (9): YOU LOSE

**TragicKingdom1** (9): big drums good

**twat\_brained** (8.4): https://twitter.com/Pink/status/3967674746 this is one of maybe like 5 Kanye songs I like. What I don't like is how he somehow manages to take African attire and show it in a sexualized manner. Not to get all Freudian but I just don't see the point

**frogaranaman** (8): https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Akanyewest%20love&src=typd

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): It‚Äôs good, but I think this could be way better.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I‚Äôm surprised that this is this high on the list considering how controversial the 808s era was for Kanye back when it took place, but then again I wasn‚Äôt very aware of pop culture in 2009. I haven‚Äôt listened to 808s and Heartbreaks in full yet, but I can understand why this might be considered a standout on any album. I‚Äôm not a great fan of the Autotune effects from what I‚Äôve heard from the record apart from Heartless, but for what it‚Äôs worth, Love Lockdown manages to be pretty catchy. I‚Äôm not fawning over it or anything, but I like it!

**Roxieloxie** (8): the beat and chorus here is nice

**waluigiest** (8): emotional boy. Well done

#Republicans are trash people*

**1998tweety** (7.7): How can a song be both interesting and boring at the same time?

**jamesfog** (7.5): Heartless outsold

**ManofOranges** (7.5): Kinda boring but when the hook came that shit sent me

**ggodisawomann** (7): another Ye song I actually enjoy

**ReallyCreative** (6.2): The ending is pretty cool but that's about it

**xxrandooxx** (5.3): This song was just background noise‚Ä¶ Which is good for a Kanye West song.

**selegend** (4): it‚Äôs impossible for me not ot be biased against him now after what‚Äôs happened in the past year

**ariannagrandtitties** (3.4): just boring

**gannade** (3): the autotune is annoying

**hikkaru** (3): this is so boring

**ryjomom** (2): That Bass

**MrSwearword** (1): the worst song to Kanye's name

**ExtraEater**: It genuinely surprised me to see this song be such a contender for the higher spots in this rate, but I'm not complaining. There's something rather plain about this song compared to just about anything else from both Green Day and their contemporaries, but that mini-falsetto "21 guns" chorus is so catchy that I love it. I haven't listened to 21st Century Breakdown, but this certainly sounds like it was a song carefully tucked into a dramatic rock opera-esque narrative while being set to be a big single. I personally feel we got second rate cuts from so many bands known for more iconic hits (Linkin Park's also in this rate for "New Divide" of all songs), but Green Day's second-rate is pretty nice, eh?

**ImADudeDuh**: I mean, I'm not mad at this. Green Day's last hit is an okay one. Idk what about this just isn't working for me. I blame the fact that the chorus sounds pretty lifeless, especially for a song referencing a 21 gun salute. I am just in absolute awe that this song managed to make it to the Top 30 of this rate.

#Worth dying for

**1998tweety** (10): this was my shit in middle school

**enecks** (10): 21st century breakdown is the messy masterpiece of the 2000's in rock, and this is the most emotional song in it. Such a hook.

**frogaranaman** (10): I wonder how many war hawks completely miss the analogy.

**ManofOranges** (10): I used to be a huge Green Day fan and sometimes I forget why I used to be but then I listen to songs like this and I'm reminded why

**mich4725** (10): I'm not a fan of  pop/rock but this is such a tune.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**Roxieloxie** (10): this just took me back to 2014 deep in my emo phase

**Mysario** (9): the guitar solo sounds like the Full House theme song

**ggodisawomann** (8.5): I like this song more than I should

**ryjomom** (8.5): Time for Gun Reform

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): this is probably the only good modern green day song

**jamesfog** (8.2): Cute rock bop

**kappyko** (8): elementary school me got my life to this

**MashLuke** (8): not my thing but good

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Much like Green Day‚Äôs fanbase, I‚Äôm conflicted on how to regard 21 Guns. Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs a great anti-war ballad in the vein of American Idiot that billy Armstrong delivers with sincerity, and other times I feel like it‚Äôs a bad copy of the stuffed John Lennon pushed out in the middle of being a Beatle and getting shot. My ultimate opinion of 21 Guns is probably ‚ÄòHey, doesn‚Äôt this sound mysteriously like the music that plays in Pokemon over Route 2009?‚Äô but right now I‚Äôm respecting the artistic ambition behind it quite a bit. It‚Äôs an eight from me.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): 21st Century Breakdown was the first album I remember being super hyped for, so some serious nostalgia from this song. It‚Äôs honestly still good imo, Green Day were at their best with some really weight and ambition, and this is a big, epic rock ballad.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): hits pretty hard and holds up but i cannot imagine actively seeking to listen to this

**radiofan15** (7.1): Is this song secretly British too?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Green Day is one of those acts that I respect more than I like, and this song is perfectly fine.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): iconic but overplayed

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I want them to play this song at my funeral, and after the song ends the us marines perform a 21 gun salute, but instead of firing into the air, they fire live amunation into my casket with my dead body in it while it is suspended over my grave. At this point this song will begin playing again, as the sounds of live gunfire echo over it, along with screams from onlookers. After they finish firing and my casket has been thoroughly ventilated, i want the wires suspending my casket quickly severed, allowing my casket to carelessly fall straight to the bottom, and smashing on the ground. After this i want bulldozers to immediately force large piles of gravel onto the splintered mess that lies at the bottom of the hole, in a very rapid, and unceremonious fashion, almost immediately sealing me and leaving my casket in a miserable state. This sequence of events will be kept secret to all except a few members of my close family who will be tasked with rapidly carrying out this operation, much to the horror of all of those in attendance. It is simply what i want

#21 Pilots*

**ReallyCreative** (7): Not really a Green Day guy but it's okay

**twat\_brained** (7): How do you follow up arguably the decade-defining rock album that perfectly captures the political zeitgeist of the time? By releasing an anti-war single, evidently. And then turning into a Broadway musical, for some reason. It sounds like they tried, which I certainly can't fault these guys for doing. Just feels a bit empty if that makes sense.

**waluigiest** (7): plagiarized from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl

**xxrandooxx** (6.8): The average amount of guns owned by Americans

**MrSwearword** (6): there's far better than this to Green Day's name

**ExtraEater**: A hook with "shawty" in it, lyrics revolving around an iPod, and just this whole production/vocal style evoke this song's time so strongly it would be ridiculous to not appreciate this as a time capsule at the very least. It charted much higher in the 2010 year-end, but it's still got some of the late 2000s energy. For one, it's pretty fitting that Iyaz wrote this with Sean Kingston and Jason Derulo, because I could definitely see this melody and production style under both of their vocals, too. Plus, this is just straight up a major BOP (there's the word!) that deserves to dominate shopping malls and old internet shrines forever. Shawty's like a melody? In *my* head? It's more likely than you think.

**ImADudeDuh**: That hook WHEW! Na na na na evEryday! Iyaz is kinda obviously a wannabe Akon and yet managed to make a song better than every other Akon song this year. His fucking MIND! Not to menton he is a KING of breaking stereotypes by cooking for his wife and also having a music video that looks like it was a sketch on So Random! but like the real So Random! show and not on Sonny with a Chance, and that is not a compliment.

#Replay everyday

**1998tweety** (10): iconic bop

**CarlieScion** (10): KING

**enecks** (10): THIS FUCKING HOOK IS ONE OF THE MOST CATCHY THINGS EVER.

**gannade** (10): whew

**MashLuke** (10): bop

**mms82** (10): deserves to win the rate Iyaz was such an underated king for his two bops

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**pearllouise** (10): [Remember his duet with Hannah Montana? Iconic!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAACC3O-Y2I)

**poppinmmolly** (10): an 11 contender because this was HUGE back then and I loved it. I also have an inside joke with my friends regarding this song.

**PuggleMaster** (10): the power

**Roxieloxie** (10): 100% unironically, i love this song. Like this is 11 material. The music Industry peaked with this song and life has not been the same sense. Fuck your Tapioca Swiffers and Aristole Groupons, This is literally the best song ever written

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this song speaks to me

**Mysario** (9.5): what's an "eye pod"

**ryjomom** (9.5): LiKe My IpOd StUcK oN rEpLaY

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9): this BANGS

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The hook on this song is a classic! Also this song is just so pure! I miss songs like this.

**jamesfog** (9): SHWATY LIKE A MELODY IN MY HEAD THAT I CANT something NANANANA EVERYDAY LIKE MY IPOD STUCK ON REPLAYAYAYAYA :yassss:

**ManofOranges** (9): Literally iconic

**NotWith10000Men** (9): my favorite song in 2009 no lie

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): A lowkey iconic bop that I like for reasons I can't explain

**bespectacIed** (8): rip ipods

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8): whatever happened to Iyaz anyway

**waluigiest** (8): this song is why Apple catapulted into this decade

**twat\_brained** (7.5): A very basic bop that's of its time but like if you don't at least move your head or tap your foot to this I don't trust you

**MrSwearword** (7): dated lyrics aside, this isn't as horrible as I remembered

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This Song just sounds like middle school, I can‚Äôt hear it and not immediately think of 2009.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I‚Äôll be fair and roast every genre while doing this rate. We are now leaving the territory of mediocre country and entering the land of dull male RnB singers that have become either completely forgotten, like Mr. Iyaz here, or memes, like Jason Derulo. The RnB in this rate actually becomes really good eventually, but for now, we‚Äôll have to contend with Replay, which bops a bit when you hear it and then completely escapes your mind for the rest of your life. It belongs in a musical purgatory full of stereo speakers from class parties in 2009, desperately trying to break free and enter paradise. Clearly, heaven does not want it in its ranks. I have nothing against it, but I can definitely see why.

**skargardin** (7): oh look this one

**vapourlomo** (7): Well, now I'll have that chorus stuck in my head for the next month. Thanks, Iyaz.

#Nah, nah, nah, nah

**ariannagrandtitties** (6.5): good but i dont wanna replay

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): tbt

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): I don‚Äôt think you could make a more 2009 song than this if you tried

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is one of the few songs in the rate that is appropriately short

**frogaranaman** (6): Points docked for actually being the song my iPod was stuck on, replaying it endlessly.

**kappyko** (5.5): If you hear J.R. Rotem's producer tag on a song you know you're in a very ethereal blend of preset synths and R&B cliches. Iyaz is serviceable, but once I found out Jason Derulo was a writer of this a ton of things made a bunch of sense. The bridge's strings have a pretty digital quality, and the melodies in this part are enough to save it completely. Damn you, Iyaz! Those kicks are tight, too.

**radiofan15** (5.2): No thank you... one time playing this is enough for me

**selegend** (5): we hate skis

**tapdancingpig** (5): This song just annoys me. It annoyed me then, it annoys me now.

**xxrandooxx** (4.5): If this song was stuck on replay it would be kinda unfortunate.

**rslashpoopheads** (2): I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.

**ExtraEater**: Fuck yeah. I like to consider this song the 2009 Rate's equivalent to "Adorn" from the 2012 rate in that it's a dark horse R&B song from the 90-100 region of the charts that somehow manages to dominate by ranking really high. It's just as good as "Adorn" too, brimming with a lively and energetic production that could bring life to even the most bored listener as they do this rate and miraculously trudge through the bottom quarter. I think it's also amazing how John Legend, like the legend he is, decided to write a song about giving consent at parties. In addition to being a very gentleman-like and generally lovable R&B song, it's actually an exciting one (sorry Ne-Yo, this is leagues above both of your songs here). Any song that features Andre 3000 on a fun, futuristic beat like that had to be exceptional. And last but not least, this shits all over Lorde. Period.

Note: This was in the Top 10 for the LONGEST time, and it was comfy in Day 4 for the LONGEST time too, but alas it got knocked out as time went on.

**ImADudeDuh**: God fucking dammit popheads. This song was in the top 10 towards the beginning of the february. Me and Extra were so happy that this motherfucking great song would have a chance at winning the rate. But, as the month went on, it just got lower and lower and so did my hope for this subreddit. John Legend, known for winning the EGOT, looking like Arthur and piano ballads, making a motherfucking party bop like this is something that took a lot of people by surprise. Andre 3000 drops a fun, fast verse that lowkey has too much talking for me, but that still doesn't change that this is an easy 10.

#Finally someone with some actual taste

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): pitbull outpeaked but lorde definitely didn't

#Probably has taste because factually speaking they should be talking about Pitbull

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): ok we all know it's not the BEST Green Light, but it's not far behind

#Green = Good

**kappyko** (11): futurist synth funk that i fucking adore and didnt realize was here until now if this doesnt maek day fucking four im banning /u/luckykida

**enecks** (10): OH MY GOD A PARTY SONG THAT CARES ABOUT CONSENT? THIS IS A FUCKING MIRACLE

**gannade** (10): john legend is so fucking annoying on social media along with his wife but this bops and andre 3000 was a really good feature

**ManofOranges** (10): Another great song who knew John Legend could actually make appealing songs that aren't ballads

**MrSwearword** (10): a nice blend between R&B and Hip-Hop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): More Songs Like This please!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Even when this song was playing on VH1 I was in love with it. It‚Äôs so smooth for John Legend‚Äôs parts and obviously Andre 3000 just kills his verse. I really miss the era where Andre was just on pop songs because they‚Äôre basically all huge bops.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): No clue John Legend had bops in his discography!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Underrated.

**waluigiest** (9): I‚Äôm waiting for it‚Ä¶. Woah this is actually very smooth and good and wow do we love Andre 3000

**jamesfog** (8.5): Smooth bop

**nightjesus** (8.5): you low key jam

**Plasm\_Trojan** (7.8): far better than "All Of Me," and should have been a bigger hit than that song

**twat\_brained** (7.8): this is almost 5 minutes long? Something tells me it will not make full use of all those minutes in the same way a song like Bad Romance would. As a matter of fact, this sounds ahead of its time. There's definitely something there.

**frogaranaman** (7): Ugh, stanning consent and good synths.

#I'm ready to go right now

**tapdancingpig** (7): This is kinda boring, but I appreciate that he‚Äôs asking for consent before he tries anything.

**ariannagrandtitties** (5.8): me at a stoplight waiting for the light to turn green

**ggodisawomann** (4): never liked this song and I still don't

#Oh Lorde, these comments

**1998tweety** (10): Lorde did not outsell, traffic lights...maybe.

**Mysario** (10): that green light, I want it

**Roxieloxie** (10): Lorde could fucking never.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): does NOT outpeak lorde but still a major bop. i expect this to get a lot of comments like "omg i've never heard this before???"

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): I would make a Lorde joke but this song is pretty cool too

**CarlieScion** (8): [insert obvious joke about Lorde]

**radiofan15** (7.9): Cute but Lorde and Beyonc√© outsold

**ryjomom** (7): Lorde Sweetie... I so sorry your wig wasn‚Äôt glued down

**pearllouise** (6): Lorde did it better

**strawberryswing1** (6): group me in with all the other comments that mention Lorde

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): put me in the lorde comments

#A match made in heaven

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): As a student of literature I‚Äôm intensely bothered that not one song called Green Light, whether it be Legend‚Äôs, Pitbull‚Äôs, or even Lorde‚Äôs, actually features any sort of reference towards the Great Gatsby. I am by no means a Fitzgerald fanatic, but if one of the prime contenders for the Great American Novel can‚Äôt even warrant a few allusions in pop music, there‚Äôs something wrong about the selection. Regarding the song itself: it‚Äôs a shame so many young and ignorant folks (such as myself) associate John Legend with All of Me, because as much as I love the sentiments in that song, he has much better displays of talent. This is the literal definition of a bloody slapper. Andre 3000‚Äôs feature is fun, too. The first truly great song on the Year-End.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): normal people will be making lorde memes but me, a gentleman and a scholar, will be making a great gatsby joke here

**ExtraEater**: Yeah, fuck Halo, fuck Already Gone, this as-seen-on-Suite-Life-on-Deck masterpiece is right here. The chorus is veritably, dare I say it, "epic" what with those battle march drums and guitars coupled with Jordin's passionate chants of "Battlefield". Seriously, this is a stadium-arresting pop song right here that we slept on just a little bit.

**ImADudeDuh**: Fucking QUEEN of Suite Life on Deck! Jordin Sparks was the last winner of American Idol that I remember watching the season she was on, and she was a queen from the start! This is not as big a bop as Love is a Battlefield by Pat Benatar, but god does it come close. When she scream battlefield, I feel myself ready to shield her from heartbreak. Plus, this song doesn't have Chris Brown! An Improvment for sure!

#Warriors

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): BETTER GO AND GET YOUR ARMOR

**gannade** (11): jordin shouldve been a main pop girl

**selegend** (11): one of the best pop songs of ALL TIME. better than halo, better than already gone, better than the rest of this list and everything else ryan tedder has done. so sad that she killed her career after this.

**1998tweety** (10): Queen, I remember her iconic appearance on The Suite Life On Deck...what ever happened to her?

**imasalesman** (10): I remember when I was like 9 and I was so mad she won lol what was wrong with me

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**pearllouise** (10): Get your amuh

**PuggleMaster** (10): I'm expecting this to be robbed

**Roxieloxie** (10): Ms.Sparks had me shook at the age of seven when she sung this on suite life on deck

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i swear to fucking god if this sub disrespects this legendary BOP i will probably get a blood clot in my brain and die

**TragicKingdom1** (10): why do people debate Halo vs Already Gone when this song is right there and better than both?

**jamesfog** (9.5): QUEEN

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Yes, this technically ripped off Pat Benatar, and, yes, nobody remembers who Jordin Sparks is anymore, but the simple fact of the matter is that I don‚Äôt care. This is an amazing and almost angelic warrior woman anthem that sends shivers up my spine. I sounded like a white woman there, but, look, it‚Äôs true. Jordin does a great job in this forgotten classic (her voice in particular makes up for the song being a copy of two others) and it‚Äôs just this amazing little gem that I have to include it in a list of my favourites in this rate. Sorry, Pat!

**ManofOranges** (9): For some reason I feel like I remember seeing this music video to this song on Disney Channel but whatever the case this song is iconic

**skargardin** (9): GETCHO ARMOUR

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): basically only rating it so hard bc the nostalgia and I LOVED THIS SONG SO MUCH

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): bop

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): cool

**twat\_brained** (8.1): This is amazing, I don't think I can remember any instances of artists somehow managing to outperform their production, yet that's exactly what Jordin is doing right here.

**MrSwearword** (8): Tattoo is her best song but this one is fine for what it is

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Underrated.

**Tchalla1966** (8): THIS was so much better than No Air! She snapped

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I have played Battlefield since BF1942, and I have studied World War 2 since I was 5 years old. I majored in Economics at UCLA with a minor in German Studies, with a heavy focus on the Second World War. To call me ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù because I want a reasonablly authentic game is completely uncalled for. Women DID NOT serve for the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. I am by no means a sexist, but any quick search online of female roles during the Third Reich will reveal that Hitler‚Äôs ambition for women was to reproduce as many children as possible, in order to create more ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù people and keep the German military full of new soldiers. Having women on the frontlines was the LAST thing that Hitler and the Nazis wanted. You know what Patrick, maybe YOU are uneducated. Maybe you should do some research on WW2 and realize that the game you are creating is a joke. I call on all of you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. We as a community should not be subjected to comments from EA degrading us as uneducated bigots, simply for wanting a game that feels like a World War 2 shooter. Disgusted.

**ExtraEater**: Y‚Äôknow that one image with that guy turning up the volume and cry-singing? I forever associate this song with that image, and I‚Äôd say it deserves it. ‚ÄúThe Climb‚Äù is emblematic of the Hannah Montana Movie and its titular character‚Äôs epic G-rated journey into the best of both worlds. It‚Äôs funny to me mainly because the mountain-moving chorus seems so cheesy and overblown in the best way possible. I‚Äôll still gladly belt this at the top of my lungs with my friend in the most off-key banshee singing possible.

**ImADudeDuh**: Lowkey, one of the songs that got worse with age. Miley's confidence anthem has some sweet lyrics, but Miley's voice was not good enough for her to try and pull this off. It suffers from the same problems Skyscraper from Demi does, where it just feels weak. I still like this song because it's nice and does put a smile on my face, but this song is absolutely not better than Strut by The Cheetah Girls, omg Strut was so fucking robbed in the March Madness bracket.

#Robbed of an Oscar

**\_wailordfan** (10): Somehow Miley peaked here, and then re-peaked during bangers, and then peaked again with NBLAH? A queen.

**CarlieScion** (10): god the teen angst

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Honestly one of Miley‚Äôs best songs

**kappyko** (10): please

**ManofOranges** (10): This song makes me cry literally everytime I hear. Maybe it's just because it reminds of the Hannah Montana movie or maybe it's because it makes me thinks of what's to come in my life but it just makes me feel something that few songs can make me feel.

**Mysario** (10): the second best song from the Hannah Montana Movie, the first being of course "Hoedown Throwdown"

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the greatest song of all time

**radiofan15** (10): Can you imagine the fact that the Hannah Montana movie was almost nominated for an Oscar for this song but the writers had to ruin it by being honest and saying that it wasn't originally conceived for the film? Ugh what a big mistake

**selegend** (10): queen of country

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): you know as a 14 year old when you would daydream about your alternate reality self? My alternate self was basically Sailor Moon and this was the song that I imagined playing in the background before I defeated my ultimate nemesis.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Wrecking Ball wishes

**1998tweety** (9.5): One of her bests, it never really connected with me the day it did to others but I still enjoy it.

**hikkaru** (9.5): ICONIC

**jamesfog** (9.5): Iconic ballop

**ryjomom** (9.5): I feel like this song belongs on the Brokeback Mountain Soundtrack

**ariannagrandtitties** (9): on my mountain climbing playlist

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I‚Äôm not one to fall for generic motivation songs, and I‚Äôve never been the biggest fan of Hannah Montanna or Miley Cyrus, but something about the Climb just makes it feel warm, sincere and genuine. Perhaps it‚Äôs the song‚Äôs incredibly clean production, or perhaps the song‚Äôs so good because Miley exerts actual effort into her performance. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs hard to deny that the Climb might just be one of the most iconic Disney Channel classics of all time.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Karaoke staple, ugly crying go-to.

**StrawberryQueenAsh** (8.5): ok this song is actually really really good for a hannah montana song

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): big grower over the years, miley is a really underrated vocalist

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): A good ballad, but a tad too slow for my liking.

**pearllouise** (8): R.I.P. Hannah Montana

**Roxieloxie** (8): this isnt even the best song on the HM:the movie soundtrack

**jval888** (7): she made it move

**waluigiest** (7): we love a power ballad I guess

**xxrandooxx** (7): ‚ÄúAlways going to be another mountain‚Äù Love the lyrics of this song

#There's always gonna be a better song

**MrSwearword** (6): it's not her worst but yikes is it still all the bad of her vocals in a song

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I never actually watched this movie

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): Big time ‚Äú14 year old singing her first serious song‚Äù vibes from this, but it might actually be a little bit better than I remember. Definitely better than Hoedown Throwdown though, jesus

**frogaranaman** (5): One time I climbed on top of the Chuck E. Cheese play station tubes you crawl around in and started crying because I didn't know how to get down.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): quick math, miley in 2009 is a 10, ballads are a 0, so 5

**twat\_brained** (4): this isn't like god awful unlistenable but I never wanna hear it again. How this went top 10 in the Disney Rate while y'all paid Hilarysus nothing but dust is unexplainable. I liked her performance of this at March For Our Lives however

**ggodisawomann** (3): never was a fan of this song. See You Again though...

**enecks** (2): A ballad with bad vocals and bad lyrics is an easy way for me to easily hate a song

**vapourlomo** (2): ...yeah, I'll pass on the mediocre, overwrought ballad and fast-forward to the Bangerz era, thanks.

To honor /u/Nerdy_boy_chris‚Äôs Billboard 2012 rate, we‚Äôre including **an optional bonus section for the 2012 rate!** Choose up to three songs you feel totally deserved to reach Day 4 of that rate (‚ÄúJessie J - Domino‚Äù is excluded because it technically did make it).
