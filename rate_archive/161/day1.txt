**vayyiqra** (7): "I don't often Twitter" ... god we all wish that were true. Anyway, this is our first song out. Many of you found it very boring and overlong, and it doesn't go anywhere, but I've come to like it and see it as kind of a breather track.

**nt96** (6): this song did NOT have a chance. It's very slow, the vocals are screaming I'm held here against my will

**seanderlust** (0): ….just check the rate graph to see how popheads felt about this unfinished demo-ass song. I don’t care that I’m the rate host, I can be a hater if I want to.

**Keno478** (6): This one has never clicked for me.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): stream Lights the Canadian singer instead

**welcome2thejam** (6): M.I.A. sneaking into the dolphin enclosure to record the ending

**jman457** (5.5): Sounds like a demo I fear

**fadedblue09** (5): this feels cryptic

**homestarguy** (5): Can’t think of anything to say about this one, so here’s an Ellie Goulding joke

**slimboyfriend** (5): this sounds like an off-key demo

###**Can’t See A Thing**

**apatel27** (2): Where the oontz oontz? Why are bad vocals the focus of this song???

**darjeelingdotcom** (2): MIA is really versatile throughout this song, switching up her sounds. Sadly, all the sounds are bad.

**moonagenightmares** (2): this feels like it goes on for ages

**seasater** (2): im sorry mia this is not it. god over 4 min too. i do kinda appreciate the evil vibes from her voice layering

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): Please send help why does this album have so many outright stinkers

**flava** (1): this is like MIA’s version of the white guy acoustic guitar genre

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes, yes, it's camp. (Insert riff on the words "camp" and "tent", get it? We're funny.) One of the songs that feels most like M.I.A. was really just fucking with us on this album and being extra weird on purpose as some kind of statement after Kala was already weird and the public ate it up, it seems she then wanted to see how much batshit stuff she could get away with. Doing a bit of musical trolling, as it were. This song goes from a 4 or so and "wow this is obnoxious" to, after a few listens, "wait this is kind of amazing". Luckily I got into this kind of weird electronic shit in the 2000s so it doesn't faze me much, and also it's nifty how these heavily pitch-shifted vocals call to mind hyperpop which this came before. The chorus, if it can be called that (more of a musical break) gets stuck in my head all the time. Weirdly compelling song!

**nt96** (9): Story time! While working on this song, MIA had trouble finding lyrics that contained the word "tent". She stated that WikiLeaks founder Julien Assange came into the studio and took her computer and basically decrypted the whole of the internet, and downloaded every word in the whole of the language that contained the word tent within it, hence the TENT being repeated here. Also, this song was ROBBED. DeTENTion for all of you!

**seanderlust** (3): [me to mia for this one](https://media.tenor.com/images/45b4dacc43f314ec3291dbb283f23a73/tenor.png)

## It's Camp

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Literally camp.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): its camp

**camerinian** (7): is this camp ba dum pssh

**Awkward\_King** (6): is it too on the nose to call this camp

**flava** (5): a part of me appreciates it's camp. The other majority of me is just bewildered

**frogaranaman** (3): camp

## Glamping

**cremeebrulee** (10): its not rly a 10 but she worked hard enough for it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this kinda slays idk

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kinda the best song ever when you think about it

**plastichaxan** (10): I realized halfway through the song I wasn’t paying attention and I wondered how many TENT wordplays I missed I had to go back to the beginning to know peace and I’m so glad cause this is genius

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this album is straight 10ts 🏕

**imbaby122** (9): she was so ahead of the times for this one

**Keno478** (9): This feels almost like a prototype PC music/hyperpop track - it is so well crafted and the drop from the first chorus is euphoric. So ahead of her time.

**asdf1698** (8.5): love the wordplay

**celladonn** (8.5): i've never heard anything quite like that distorted tent, it's great

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): you have it

**impla77** (8.5): Never knew you could force TENT into so many words

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): i forget why i rate this song so high, then the bouncy bass part comes on and i remember

**1998tweety** (8): more like aEIGHTion

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): the breakdown is really fun, very late 90s. MIA at her best in some respects when she’s mixing new and old sounds

**Stryxen** (8): there are so many people screaming all over this track what was she doing to them in the studio? making them listen to jay park?

**fairytalehigh** (7): this song has zero reason to go as hard as it does... but loubaTENT is inexcusable

**Uberpigeon** (7): portal turrets when u knock them over

**throwaway-7650** (6.6): A.N.T. farm ass song title

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.5): strong "hey you seen what hyperdub has been up to for the past 8 years?!" energy. someone in the comments is trying to tell me this is "underground breakbeat/jungle from the UK back in '92". in 2022, the hardcore continuum is enjoying a renaissance or reconsideration, which makes this cut from 2k13 all the more fascinating. but goodness it sounds HEAVY behind where great dance sounds were coming from at that moment.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this sounds like it would be in a racing game on the ps2

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): maybe if she hadn't capitalised that second t she could've fooled me

**BaconShoes** (6): the TENT over and over gets a bit annoying tbh, but it’s not bad and I like the production

**reput4tionera** (6): kind of grating

**seasater** (6): kinda more catchy and boppy but still not my fav

**shipperondeck** (5.5): literally what

## Forgot Their Tent Stakes And It's Raining

**welcome2thejam** (5): Interesting idea, meh execution

**jman457** (4.8): this sounds a little too dated, like a black eyed peas reject.

**fadedblue09** (4): I feel like this should sound more clever than it does

**sarcasticsobs** (4): Enough with these specific quirks

**TiltControls** (4): I can only fall for the old 'put ten in the title to get 10s' once per rate. sorry MIA

**bogo** (3): she really thought she was doing something adding all those words with "tent" in them

**homestarguy** (3): Alrighty, I think this album just isn’t for me

**pig-serpent** (3): This one is boring but it's not annoying, so that's something.

**runaway3212** (3): this is that bad

**ignitethephoenix** (2): TENT

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): Jesus Fucking Christ imagine asking Julian Assange of WikiLeaks to <paraphrase> “take your computer and decrypt the whole of the internet and download every word in the whole of the language” just so you can have words containing “tent” for this whole song… and not only are the lyrics trash, the fucking instrumental sucks ass. Holy fuck this track is garbage.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): i’m a linguistic major m.i.a don’t do this to me.

**nick1372** (1): wow this is annoying

**Roxieloxie** (1): similar to the 1 song, i dont like the vocal distortion on here nor the emphasis thing shes doing

**musical\_pyn** (0): aZEROTion

**PandaMomentum** (0): just don't ever do anything like this again

**ricki** (0): this isnt as clever as mia would like to think it is

**steelstepladder** (0): but… why?

**nt96** (8): what I use for painting

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes it's only a minute long and the lyrics are mostly in Japanese, but it's really quite a cute little moment on the album. It fell victim to interludephobia, alas, but I like the simplicity of it being about how painting is neat.

**seanderlust** (7): Look, a second artist in this rate! Yeah this was never going to do well. Interludephobia you will be dealt with. It’s pretty, but I do agree with the general consensus - it could have safely been left off the album and not much would be lost. Still, who am I to tell KKB how to make their art. Geddit - KKB, art?

---

###**Art Historians**

**amr** (10): PERFECT SONG THE GREATEST SONG IN THE WORLD....sounds like it would be in a mother game which is entirely why I like it so much but that one hollow tunnel effect honestly shakes me to my core

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9): now THATs what we call...hmm never finished this comment oh well

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): Barely a song but don't care, still dig it

**darjeelingdotcom** (8): the way I like this interlude lmao

**homestarguy** (8): The only Day 1 bait on this album, but hey I still think it’s pretty :)

**runaway3212** (8): yass

**imbaby122** (7.8): such a cutesy glittery song

**fairytalehigh** (7.3): it's a pretty song but there's not a lot going on, interludephobia will win out i fear.

**BaconShoes** (7): Less exciting than the other songs, but it’s cool that she did the song mostly in Japanese, and it’s lovely

**CrimsonROSET** (7): honestly art is magic she’s so right

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): why is this literally Backseat’s intro omfg…

**IIIHenryIII** (7): sounds cool but too short

**plastichaxan** (7): It’s too short but I can’t tank a song that made me consider painting for fun

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Cute little interlude

**TiltControls** (7): this feels more like a cutscene than a song

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): cute

**akanewasright** (6): This is a completely inessential track for me but it’s cute

**AzettImpa** (6): it’s more of an interlude

**bigbigbee** (6): Stardew Valley music

**bogo** (6): i think this would work better without any lyrics at all

**frogaranaman** (6): 🧑‍🎨

**seasater** (5.5): that was sweet and nice

###**My Five Year Old Could Draw That**

**jman457** (5.2): didnt move me that much

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I… didn’t hate it, I guess?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Cute but what’s cute next to gorgeous.

**camerinian** (5): fuck art

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I listened to this twice and I still have no idea what happened

**moonagenightmares** (5): at least it was short

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): interludes bringing down my average >:(

**flava** (3.5): it’s a nice instrumental, wish it was just the instrumental

**MassiveThief** (3): feels unnecessary to be honest

**Awkward\_King** (2): i dont really have anything to say about this song so jamie from kero kero bonito i am free for lunch on thursday that is thursday i am free on thursday for lunch jamie from kero kero bonito i am free on thursday i am free thursday im free

**Low\_Stable7628** (2): generously short

**seanderlust** (7.3): Interludephobia part two! This only doing marginally better than Paintbrush makes sense - they’re both quite short and meant to serve as a bridge to another song. Karmageddon effectively introduces some of the concepts of the record and the wobbling synths do sound pretty neat, but you’d be forgiven for not remembering anything but the pun in the title. Congratulations to MIA for (regardless of what comes next) winning most songs in the bottom five! 🥳

**nt96** (6): it's….ok I guess? I'm assuming this was used as a soft opener before blowing the gates wide open with the title track, kinda like a roller coaster moving uphill before going down.

**vayyiqra** (6): More of an intro than a song, it sets the tone for the rest of the album well (a bit ominous). It's rather short, but it does work well as a lead-in to the title track. Also not that I'm an expert on Hinduism or anything, but note M.I.A. brings up karma a couple of times on this album, and other Hindu references (this is a neat one: look up some photos of how the goddess Matangi is depicted in art, then look at the album cover).

---

###**Enchanted**

**cocosairdep** (10): this album begins and ends with portmanteau-titled tracks, omg her mind!! lorde could never

**IIIHenryIII** (10): karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend…

**moonagenightmares** (10): great album opening

**plastichaxan** (10): Most of this should be a realizashun moment but I can’t believe anything she says anymore like what if she thinks things move like sound because of the 5g waves or something

**runaway3212** (10): I need to give her some points this slayed

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Honestly a banging ass intro I’m prepared for popheads to shun because it’s an intro/interlude. F.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): great intro

**flava** (8): it does what it needs to do

**impla77** (8): I do love MIAs loyalty to stupid wordplay

**jman457** (8): As a intro it really works

**PandaMomentum** (8): adjusts your head and ears

**pig-serpent** (8): I'm not sure what else you could ask for in an album opener. It sets the mood expertly and it stands up in its own right.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): such an MIA way to open an album

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): first time hearing this album: "what the fuck is this, 4". second time hearing this album: OMMMMMM

**fairytalehigh** (7.8): it took me an embarrassingly long time (years) before i realized this was a pun on karma and NOT cars

**jasannn** (7.5): this is what swifties were expecting karma to sound like

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): The instrumental rules but M.I.A.'s disaffected vocal thing (which I usually like!) didn't gel with it that much here for me

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (7): karma coma Jamaican aroma

**fadedblue09** (7): cute intro, love the transition

**homestarguy** (7): Okay…I’m interested

**imbaby122** (7): i understand all these words individually but they don’t feel like real sentences like they don’t mean anything. or maybe i’m just hungover.

**Keno478** (7): A fine intro, nothing special.

**reput4tionera** (7): the lyrics are kinda corny but it’s fun

**vayyiqra** (10): Without a doubt the hardest song on the album to get into and one that tests the "baby ears" (god I hate that term though) of many a pop enjoyer, this song was a bit of a stumbling block even for me at first. If I'd done the rate with this in 2016, it'd likely have gotten a 6 or something. Now though my ears are used to the screaming and whistle sounds and so on, and more importantly Pan's rapping on this rules; she killed it so much I memorized the Chinese lyrics because they got stuck in my head so often. This song might seem out of place on the album, but it makes sense to me. One thing about Grimes I love is how she has these random little moments of ugliness in her work like shrill yells and screams even in her "pretty" songs (you can hear that in "Butterfly" for example), and her use of skulls and snakes and whatever in her drawings, and this song is a great example of that. It's so Grimesian of her to have two upbeat pop songs and in between them a bizarre, heavy, offputting son: not because it's meant to be a "pleb filter", but it's just the way she is. Besides, the beat simply goes hard.

**nt96** (8): YESSSSS DEAFEN ME

**seanderlust** (7.7): I didn’t expect this to do good exactly but bottom five surprises me! A lot of folks had a problem with the screaming against an instrumental that is less provocative. For me it’s a fun but somewhat forgettable cut off Art Angels. Which is surprising cause y’know…the screaming. I will say the panting and snarling after the screams is giving [twisted cycle path](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/037/262/cover5.jpg).

## Bitch, [SOUND]

**darjeelingdotcom** (10): rawr XD

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Possessed Grimes is the best

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): this goes hard

**plastichaxan** (10): I used to live with a very religious aunt and everytime she said something that pissed me off I blasted this cause she hated it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): say what you want about this song… as long as you say it slays

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is gonna go out bottom 5 anyway let me give this a 10 bc i feel bad for it being done dirty

**throwaway-7650** (10): if wolf alice released this it would be day 3 with a 12.0 average

**apatel27** (9): Hating on this is xenophobic

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9): cuts like scream are why I think art angels kinda is brilliant. grimes very much finding herself looking to taiwanese and japanese pop, culling the right person (aristophanes aka PAN) and letting THEM sorta run the track under her cunning production, this is a real savory, libido-laden cut. "pure texture" even down to the scream". makes me wanna get a motorcycle

**fairytalehigh** (9): "wow this lady sounds angry i wonder what she's saying???"

**flava** (9): proof that grimes is actually a furry

**PandaMomentum** (9): yes!

**sarcasticsobs** (9): I close my eyes. I cannot see the haters of this song.

**celladonn** (8.5): AAAAAAAAAAA

**1998tweety** (8): ate a bit

**nick1372** (8): she sure does scream I can't complain

**reput4tionera** (8): i am slightly stoned rn and its freaking me out a bit

**ricki** (8): speak your truth queen

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): I actually love Pan’s rapping and the screams, just wish the music itself was weirder

**amr** (7.7): I think this is the song that sets my rating system in stone like everything is clear to me now

**asdf1698** (7.6): I didn’t get it but then I listened to it when I was angry and now I love it

**BaconShoes** (7): unique and kinda slay, but also kinda structureless a bit idk? …which isn’t a bad thing I guess, but it’s not like a 10 for me or anything

**imbaby122** (7): this song sounds like it eats sheet metal. like major jackie kennedy core.

**impla77** (7): This would be disturbing if I knew what was being said

**pig-serpent** (7): I want to defend rock songs with screaming from angry hoards of popheads raters, but ultimately this song is just fine and in a rate this stacked that isn't good enough.

**ulikejazz** (7): rawr

**jasannn** (6.5): it’s crazy that one of the shortest songs on this album felt the longest

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): 潘Pan I’m so sorry honey but… a different rapper (Janelle??) would’ve murdered this instrumental until it was dead. Unfortunately this is just… whatever, I guess.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): wait this is actually better than i remember

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): There’s a bit too much going on with this one

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): she wants to be Flossie so bad

**akanewasright** (5.5): not really for me, but it’s a much better use of your 潘PAN than Darkseid on Miss A

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): She put this one on the album to get out some extra edginess and you know what it’s fine.

**cremeebrulee** (5.3): see my tears comment (i’m assuming this leaves first)

**jman457** (5.3): it's so weird I can’t tank it entirely

**seanderlust** (8.2): This one ranking in the bottom ten somewhat surprises me. Raters took issue with it being repetitive which is somewhat understandable, but it’s an empowerment anthem ensconced in hip hop-meets-bhangra melodies and a beat that feels like it rattles around in your ribcage. Also the musical outro is actually one of my favorite moments from the early parts of this album. Sad! Oh well, there are other musical moments on this album that arguably execute that combination better.

**nt96** (8): This is headache-inducing [complimentary]

**vayyiqra** (6): As a twin myself, I'd like to point out that given the base rate of DNA mutations and especially the role of epigenetics in the regulation of gene expression, this is quite true! On a biological level, at least. As for what M.I.A. meant by this song: who the fuck knows lol. Unlike the other albums in this rate, where I have a good handle of what the lyrics are about and what the artists meant, on this album I'm so often checked out and just "???". You can't expect anyone to make a lot of sense of some of the gibberish on this album. However, while many of the other tracks on the album are at least bangers, this one is moreso just "weird for the sake of weird". Can't say I love it.

## [8 Billion People And Me](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/799/676/d0a.png)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Bitch I ain’t special.

**fadedblue09** (10): The drums here are crazy

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): \[Anakin Skywalker voice\]: Now THIS is cyberpop

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): “How can you give this a 9? Where’s the missing 1?” read the song title luv

**plastichaxan** (9): Maybe but I think she’s forgetting about the two wolves inside me or whatever

**runaway3212** (9): slayed

**squeezylemon** (9): How the shit did she create an affirmation anthem that sounds like a defiant scratching record and somehow comes together perfectly? This song is an apocalypse that loves her listener.

**reput4tionera** (8.5): this is kinda insane

**jman457** (8.3): Really cool journey

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): the sample is so beautifully chaotic but i imagine it probably is annoying to a lot of people

**BaconShoes** (8): The production here slays

**IIIHenryIII** (8): thank god

**moonagenightmares** (7.7): kinda sounds like a throwback to her earlier albums

**asdf1698** (7.5): really catchy and interesting

**Keno478** (7): The pre chorus to the second chorus is so strong, I feel like otherwise this track is one of the weaker on the album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): “making money is fun but your life is one of a kind” the way my mother said this to me almost verbatim

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): its ok, not the best track

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.8): like the bell sound is good and production hits if you get faded enough, but also this is limp wrist shit. good god

**1998tweety** (6.5): a tepid bop

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): I've heard that there are actually 7 people in the world with your same genetic makeup so idk I wanna see your sources

**CrimsonROSET** (6): dingdingdingdingdingdingding

**homestarguy** (6): This is pretty cool, but not sure I’m feelin’ it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): me when someone asks how many times the letter u appears in massachusetts

**welcome2thejam** (6): PS1 Tomb Raider graphics type quality

## There's 8 Billion People On The Planet

**steelstepladder** (5): this production is just… too messy. The repetition gets really annoying really fast

**Stryxen** (5): far too many ideas going around Ms I.A let’s try condensing

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): what is going on.

**imbaby122** (4): this is cool from a production standpoint but it’s making me queasyyyy

**seasater** (4): sorry not my thing as much

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): bad day for twins

**MassiveThief** (3): and this is where she breaches into just annoying territory.

**nick1372** (1.5): I want to like the video game influences but the rest of the song does NOT come otgether

**Roxieloxie** (1): not to 'give this a one cause its in the name' but I dont like this at all it feels like a distorted demo

**throwaway-7650** (1): this is what I imagine brooke candy's full discography sounds like

## Mic The Snare Burner Accounts

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): crazy frog - axel f

**TiltControls** (7): I can't believe she got Crazy Frog for a feature

**ricki** (3): is that a crazy frog sample

**pig-serpent** (2): Is that crazy frog???

**camerinian** (0): apologies to the hosts that my ballot was super late, but frankly this track put me off finishing this album for a long time, which is a shame because it does actually improve from here on out, but holy shit this is obnoxious. Just a wall of noise, annoying vocal chops, drums as loud as anything and zero hook or melody to attach yourself or any other element on to. There is plenty of proof in this rate that abrasion and pop can go together perfectly, but this track just has no interest in doing either well at all. I was gonna say it's giving Crazy Frog, but even Crazy Frog knew how to find good samples to turn to noisy chopped vocal ass. Get your vaccinations.

**seanderlust** (9): Yeah people did not like this one and for a decent while it was bottom 5. Personally, I like it - cutting commentary with a quick acknowledgement of the M.I.A. Super Bowl controversy that had occurred the year prior to this release. Over a bumping bass, M.I.A. examines the Western view of her music through a satirical lens, the narrator of the song at once spitting racist micro/macroagressions and heralding bikram yoga and Eat, Pray, Love. For better (here) or worse (please get vaccinated), M.I.A. has never shied away from political commentary and this short interlude is arguably as political as this album gets. For me? It’s a serve. But I do get why this tanked.

**nt96** (7): a musical equivalent of a middle finger to her racist haters and the NFL. That’s pretty much it.

**vayyiqra** (4): Many are saying this skit is dated, and the Kony reference means it was dated as soon it dropped (note: he existed long before 2012 and was hardly unknown, I knew who he was, cursed guy). I was expecting this track to bomb and even be the very first track out, but you all felt like "Lights" was the worst track on this album, not this one, which I get (this one is at least short and "Lights" does drag more). Still I feel this track was very unneeded, although she had a point in alluding to the backlash against her she found in America ("brown girl turn your shit down"). Other lyrics just feel like her being lazy and naming random things that one might expect to turn up in an M.I.A. song like drones and ashrams but without any clear point, so I feel this skit was a mistake lol. It really walks the line between "amusing" and "annoying", something that M.I.A. has always loved doing, but unlike a lot of her other music this isn't good enough to justify it.

###Skit Enthusiasts

**akanewasright** (10): the front half of this album made me forget I actually like MIA as a rapper 😭

**amr** (10): is neck and neck with paintbrush for best 5 second song in this rate

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): sure it works

**flava** (10): mia really saved her most potent political content of this album for an interlude. The brain on this woman, no wonder she’s anti-vaxx

**plastichaxan** (10): Oh I know this is first out in the rate let me help it a little for that bit of fun the Boom Shakalakas gave me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKXoYkPe5As

**ricki** (10): interlude solidarity

**Stryxen** (10): this is amazing and i think it could possibly even make day 2. Do not make fun of me when i’m horrendously wrong

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): normalise skits/interludes on albums that are bangers on their own too!!!!

**jman457** (9.3): Interludephobia will slaughter this I fear

**Keno478** (9): This was on my CD mixtape in my car.

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): getting ratatouille style flashbacks to every single time i got micro-aggressed

**BaconShoes** (8): She kinda spilled here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see she holds up even without the ??? production!

**homestarguy** (8): She has some points

**IIIHenryIII** (8): why so short???

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): one of the best songs on the album lowkey

**squeezylemon** (8): It’s fucking funny, you guys.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): it's an interlude alright, there's some interesting beats here

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): wtf ever happened with kony 2012 anyway??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): if this was released today it would be a tiktok trend

**impla77** (7.2): Feel like I’m missing the Madonna context, ‘drama’ is probably a product of its time??

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Honestly this is a decent skit with the “dum dum dum, dum dum da-dum” backing vocals. Once again ready for this to get eviscerated though.

**runaway3212** (7): this is kinda slaying idc

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): best interlude of the rate

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): "Boom shackalacka" is fun to say, but this sure is a skit! (I did like the lyrics, though)

**ignitethephoenix** (6): not Kony 2012 fhsjdjekd

**memezaharamole** (6): good 'skit', bad song

**moonagenightmares** (6): the disappointment when you’re listening to an album and see the word skit

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): not the most memorable MIA skit IMO

###**"Man, SNL Has Really Gone Downhill"**

**1998tweety** (5): well

**imbaby122** (5): boom shakalaka top ten silliest onomatopoeia

**reput4tionera** (5): did she just fucking mention kony 2012

**welcome2thejam** (5): Actually started a bit promising, then interludephobia kicked in. Also, define "skit"

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I'm dying there’s some sitcom that this instrumental sounds like it’s from and I can’t remember. Help me.

**camerinian** (4): I feel like I'm meant to be scandalized by this, and yet all I can think is "anti-vax = opinion disregarded"

**pig-serpent** (4): 2013 isn't the worst year to drop a Kony 2012 reference, but it's also not the best.

**throwaway-7650** (4): everything about this interlude is great aside from M.I.A herself

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): that KONY reference really places this song as a child of 2012

**seasater** (3): ijdk i listened twice bc the first time it washed past me with absolutely no impression. second time not much better

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): Shout out Kony 2012 I guess

**nick1372** (2): this album is getting kind of directionless

**PrimaryCrusaders** (1): glad this is only a skit

**nt96** (8): This song is sending me

**vayyiqra** (8): A fairly weird song with an off-kilter melody, surreal cover art, and then that jumpscare in the middle with the pitched-down vocals (which is very funny to me). Nobody knows why KKB love writing songs about birds, but they're quirky like that I guess.

**seanderlust** (6.9): Yeah I don’t know either. Chicken is a pretty straight-forward KKB BG-era jam until Sarah and co decide to have a little thrash moment? It feels a little too random-core and not cohesive enough - I think KKB’s later experimentation with harsher sounds comes off as a little more fluid.

**vayyiqra** (8): In hindsight this song feels a bit meandering and doesn't really go anywhere, and I think I overrated it a little. There's the obvious joke some of you made about the title and M.I.A.'s questionable actions, but I won't go there. It's a decent enough track, but I don't get the lyrics or the point of it.

**nt96** (7): its ok, but its ultimately forgettable

**seanderlust** (4.5): Me when M.I.A. is getting her ass beat on day 1 of the cyberpop rate. We continue the MATANGI listening party with Know It Ain’t Right, a song that even at its best never left day 1. Some raters vibed with it, but others thought it was boring and/or the lyrics were not good (seriously M.I.A., you’re going to look me in the eye and tell me there was no other way to end those verses with anything but “good licky-licky”???). Personally, this tends to be a song I skip. The Bond-esque guitar riff is cool and the beat is kind of nice but that’s about all I have to say. If you offered me $100 to tell you any lyrics but the chorus and “licky licky” I would tell you to enjoy your money.

**vayyiqra** (10): Here the aggressively positive vibe of this album and the undertone of "haha life hard, millennials, amirite" mesh quite well ... have you ever heard a pop song about how "the job search" and "putting yourself out there" are really stupid? So true, it really is dumb and a little degrading. Kind of pretentious of me, but there is a bit of an anticapitalist theme on this album ... we went from "Graduation" to "Break" to this ... KKB antiwork activists?

**seanderlust** (7.8): [Live footage of popheads doing this rate](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/015/266/Z7HeRxU.png).

This song is arguably the closest KKB gets to being straight-up funny in their songs. Try Me encapsulates the desperation in finding a job that so many of us are met with right out of college. I eventually got there but there was a brief time in college that I straight up worked for gift certificates to the company owner’s friend’s restaurant! Good times. Anyways it’s a bop and deserved better.

**nt96** (7.5): idk what to say about this one. It exists I guess?

###**Hired! When Can You Start?**

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): is this an actual good example of a cover letter?

**homestarguy** (10): This is how I will read someone’s LinkedIn skills/endorsements in my head from now on

**hunnybee12** (10): try me!! really please ive been job hunting for 4 months :( somebody :( please :(

**nick1372** (10): I wish I could just cover this song to get a job instead of submitting a resume through Linkedin. I wouldn't get hired but at least it would be fun.

**plastichaxan** (10): I did know you can do anything Sarah Bonito from Kero Kero Bonito

**reput4tionera** (10): i need this confidence i cant do shit baby!!!

**Stryxen** (10): i put my rating career on my resumé

**TiltControls** (10): glad to see sarah is putting her skills to use post-graduation

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.5): that's right sarah.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): me when somebody asks if I am ready to receive information that may hurt me:

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): costco samples:

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): Me when I lie during a job interview

**apatel27** (9): Me sending job applications to every opening

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Ugh hate her tryhard ass. Great song.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): I'm gonna hyperlink a random dot in my resume to this song.

**Uberpigeon** (9): me trying to get a rate host spot

**BaconShoes** (8.8): When she started listing her impressive list of activities, I was sold tbh

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): the job interviewer: "what are your qualifications for this position" me: "business! dancing! throwing a party... WITH YOU!"

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): linkedin anthem

**bogo** (8.4): putting this as my resume [437852]

**camerinian** (8): Imagining this track being sung by the comic relief on one of the newer, internet-era Disney Channel cartoons when they're trying really hard to get a summer job just like at the community pool

**CrimsonROSET** (8): commissions open

**welcome2thejam** (8): Help I always thought the lyric was "Did you know I can't do anything"

**imbaby122** (7.7): good for you sarah???? like no need to rub it in my face :’(

**impla77** (7.7): playing this at interviews

**shipperondeck** (7.2): https://youtu.be/ElOlFl7pnno?t=72

**pig-serpent** (7): This song sounds like applying for jobs feels, so I guess it's what they were going for, but I hate applying for jobs.

**jman457** (6.8): this gives the energy of me putting “profecient in excel” on my resume

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA-IxpFSRts

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): No I don’t think I will try you, tbh.

**asdf1698** (3.5): I was going to give this a 1 but then on the next listens I was sort of amused

**flava** (3): i hope everyone knows i would not try this band if they weren’t in 3 rates this year

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): falls victim to the charli xcx school of repetition

**darjeelingdotcom** (2.5): Sarah sweetie you’ve sung this song like five times already

**nt96** (9): for a song called that mentions walking, yall TRIPPED exponentially. Its got everything; a nice slow go-go intro, a sped up kind of beat with intense Asian instrumentals, dystopian lyrics about surveillance or whatever, a

**vayyiqra** (7): With a slightly corny intro that has some kind of annoying nasal vocals, this song isn't off to a promising start, but then "I'm gonna still fux with you" is a funny line and then the electronic break and beat coming in adds a lot to the song. Overall it can be called something of a banger, albeit not one of the best tracks on the album by any means.

**seanderlust** (5): We round out the top 10 with Come Walk With Me, a song where M.I.A. invites us along to…I guess take a walk with her. At its best, MATANGI is experimental and cutting-edge, fusing musical elements from hip-hop, pop and bhangra to make music that feels like something nobody has heard before but is still recognizably M.I.A.; at its worst, MATANGI is too many ideas thrown into a pot and barely stirred before being stirred, producing a dish that is borderline unlistenable. This is a good example of the latter. By and large, raters agreed - this track walked its way up to the border of Day 2, but never managed to cross over.

---

###**Take A Walk by Passion Pit**

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the kind of chaos i love in an m.i.a. song

**BaconShoes** (10): Insane in the best way

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not the jumpscare volume adjustment sound in this middle of this.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): yes, of course, let's go, i’m ready, don't ask again

**Stryxen** (10): come SKANK with me YASS

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I was thinking "hey a normal song" for the first 90 seconds. then it got good yass

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): this song has too many great moments. the beat switch, the mouthfeel of "just to discuss agenda," the deceptively anti-pop "tonight we ain't actin like we don't care" lyric. at her best maya really does something nobody else can.

**asdf1698** (9): can’t stop listening to this

**bogo** (9): love how fucking insane this sounds, it's like mia is just throwing shit at the wall and it works

**plastichaxan** (9): Okay but I’ll wear a mask Okay I promise this will be my last antivaxx joke

**amr** (8.8): [kamala harris dancing and stepping and laughing]

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): must… resist… antivax joke…

**camerinian** (8.5): this sounds like the PC Music version 1.0 remix of itself, but you know what's that's forward thinking for 2013 so kudos ig

**TiltControls** (8.5): another that's too catchy for its own good

**jman457** (8.4): six flags theme song if it were hyperpop

**Low\_Stable7628** (8): it's camp

**PandaMomentum** (8): there is beauty in chaos

**impla77** (7.5): This kept coming up on my playlist so I was indoctrinated into (kinda?) liking it

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I love the plucked beat on this song but MIA's vocals in the verses are... really bad and unfitting. The nice hook and beat switch are redeeming qualities too.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): where are we going mia

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): ditto this track

**welcome2thejam** (7): Ooh, kinda went 60s girl group for a bit

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): jill scott:

**imbaby122** (6.5): taking off a couple points bc the vocals are becoming a bit grating but i think from a production and songwriting point this is my fav so far.

**reput4tionera** (6.5): don’t rly like her vocals on this but also imagine a jersey club mix

**runaway3212** (6): this isnt that bad

**sarcasticsobs** (6): I mean, I like beat switches, but this just had me going "Sure". Kinda started to get annoyed by the end, too

**MassiveThief** (5.5): I like the hook a lot but everything is eh

###**The Lazy Song by Bruno Mars**

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): “This kinda just sounds like shitty Paper Planes” -> “... okay never mind”

**homestarguy** (5): Did she just…sample the macOS Photo Booth???

**ignitethephoenix** (5): idk what this song is trying to be but it shouldn’t do this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): trying to assign numerical values to these songs is exhausting

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): this song is full of baffling choices, the hook just does not work. Not terrible though at least

**fadedblue09** (4): some interesting elements but overall borderline annoying

**oscarbrierley1** (4): this is what my stress headaches sound like

**seasater** (4): god listening to this album after doing all of kero kero bonito's is such a contrast hahaha. ok this song. its ok. not for me so much

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3.5): find the key, girl… find the key

**flava** (2): ok mia's voice is just really annoying on this song. And the more upbeat dance break sections suck any life the song had

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): first weak spot on this album

**moonagenightmares** (1): this sure was a song

**throwaway-7650** (0): yeah M.I.A is a worse singer than megan thee stallion

**nt96** (8): this song deserved SO MUCH better.

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes the production on this cut is a bit rough, with the "om" intro making my headphones distorted. It's very "assault on the senses" kind of loud and grating, which is what M.I.A. does best, so the whiplash between those parts in the verses and the sparser choruses works.

**seanderlust** (6.8): Hey we made it out of the bottom ten! Now that that’s over I wonder what we have in sto….aaaand it’s more M.I.A. Well. The instruments have some interesting ideas on this one, but it does feel a little repetitive. These early MATANGI songs do walk that line between experimental and just headache-inducing fairly clumsily. I think she finds her footing better in the middle-to-back part of the album, but Warriors, along with its surrounding tracks, you would be forgiven for forgetting.

---

###**Putting Them In A Trance**

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): GANGSTERS BANGERS WE'RE PUTTING THEM IN A TRANCE

**throwaway-7650** (10): idk why this cacophony makes sense to me but the last 3 don't

**welcome2thejam** (10): This would absolutely annihilate while driving late night in the city

**BaconShoes** (9.5): this song goes so hard

**flava** (9): warriors is everything people say bad girls is

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I’m ready to go to war

**Keno478** (9): BOP ALERT

**pig-serpent** (8.5): The songs on this album need to be so hype that you forget they're annoying, and this is probably the song on this album that does that the best.

**plastichaxan** (8): Ignoring the lyrics so I don’t feel like she’s trying to convince me getting vaxxed was a mistake

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): That initial beat is POUNDING and it makes me a little anxious but in a very good way and I feel that's also the goal. I just wish this went some different places than it did

**imbaby122** (7.8): if whiplash was a song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): wa-wa-wa-wa-wario's in a dance

**fadedblue09** (7.5): has some interesting influences in its instrumentation

**memezaharamole** (7.5): love the drumming pattern in the background and how the "giddy up giddy up giddy up..." etc lines up with it. Some of the better beat switches on the album

**reput4tionera** (7.5): oh the production is everything

**fairytalehigh** (7.4): i like the sample of clanging swords but unfortunately i remember this one the least out of the first few tracks

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (7.1): "the energy is off" is like my entire critique of this album in a nutshell. all the ideas are here and im in an anti-imperialist mindset to take this in, but literally we just can't hit that gangster trance smh.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I couldn’t put people in a trance with my dancing but I could cause debilitating trauma.

**jman457** (7): Catchy, but wish there was a bit here

**PandaMomentum** (7): sick beats

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): a lot going on here that I like but could also be tighter

**Stryxen** (7): songs to sway at a medium speed to. I kinda dislike this but then there’s an occasional moment i absolutely love. WAAAAARIOOAWWRRRRSSS especially. The audience can decide if i love or hate that

**1998tweety** (6.5): theres a lot going on here [2]

**camerinian** (6.5): if any of these disparate ideas was given a chance to develop I'm sure this track would slap, but it sounds like MIA just yanked parts of each section and used RNG to decide where they should go

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): This is gonna be a common theme where M.I.A. really walks a very thin line between experimental and in your face and banger-ific… and just straight up annoying and ear-agony. Warriors is an example where she firmly plants both feet on both sides of the line.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oh my gosh! don’t you know i’m a savage?

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): ‘i’m collecting the ticks’ she’s just saying anything huh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): idk how to feel about this one

###**Just Kind Of Like Waving A Pocket Watch In Front Of Their Face**

**homestarguy** (5): Again…pretty cool, but not sure I’m coming back to this one

**Uberpigeon** (5): nevermind i thought this album would be bangers but its banging my head in with a hammer

**seasater** (4): oooh edgy again. gritty even. funky . i dont have the words. as a song though i think too irregular and odd to be something id really listen too. wont give it a 1 though i admire the production and creativity

**steelstepladder** (3.5): I feel bad for my scores so far cause MIA is obviously an icon and influential but there are a ton of ideas on these songs but they don’t really come together in a way that makes sense or is satisfying

**moonagenightmares** (3): i thought this song was over like 5 times

**runaway3212** (2.5): please no more

**nick1372** (2): but WHY am I being put in a trance? miss MIA please explain yourself

**static\_int\_husp** (0): the mixing on this is not good, each "ohm" blows out my earphones

**nt96** (8): It's a neat bop and The Key, The Secret interpolation is neat as well.

**vayyiqra** (8): I'd agree this is better than some of the songs that made it onto Matangi, and has a cool, slightly menacing instrumental. Out of the two M.I.A. bonus tracks I think this is the better of them and I should've rated this one higher.

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): not this going harder than most of the songs on the album and certainly not ME hearing this for the first time in 2022

**plastichaxan** (9.7): “Watch me go in, watch me go in” - vaccines to M.I.A. on opposite day ~~Okay I needed to finish the rate with a last anti-vaxx joke I couldn’t think of anything else~~

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I like this

**Keno478** (8): I honestly love this track, it’s a good deep cut.

**Stryxen** (8): that scratchy electronic something oooh i love this

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): and i like it like that i and i like it like that

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): better than half of Matangi

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): Would've liked this when it came out, not wild on in now

**BaconShoes** (7): I can dig it

**DirtyRat583** (7): SHOCKINGLY dated

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): uh I couldn’t find this son so I’m going to guess that it was good

**imbaby122** (6): i definitely wrote some variation of that chorus in my songwriter phase when i was like 8

**reput4tionera** (6): the intro reminds me so much of turn down for what for some reason

###**Didn’t Like This**

**jman457** (5): yeah this sounds like a bonus track.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Yeah I can see why this was left off the album.

**PandaMomentum** (4): filler

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): is that a recorder in the background

**throwaway-7650** (4): I didn't

**bogo** (3): i'd prefer it if you didn't give it to me at all, actually

**pig-serpent** (2.5): Instead of being the all out blast like the best songs on this album, it hits the same levels of annoying as her worst songs but sounds more like a dull, club rap song which has always been a vibe that I hate. There are a few interesting ideas, but overall this is completely unenjoyable to me.

**vayyiqra** (10): As many comments said: She is so quirky!!! Love her!!! That aside, I love this intro. A classical bit for violin, piano and voice was not what anyone expected from the intro to this album. Something about it grabbed me right away, and I still love the line "when the leaves begin to fall, I try to catch them all" ... something mysterious about this draws me in.

**seanderlust** (7): she’s so crazzzy…love her. Yeah no I don’t have much to say about this one. I will say it is impressive that a song that mostly just serves as an intro escaped the bottom ten and wasn’t the lowest scored song on the album. Then again, I am someone who would have given the Chromatica interludes 10s if they were by themselves in 2020 Ult so…anyways, enjoy!

**nt96** (6.5): it's an interlude, but what a lovely one at that! The leap in quality from Visions to Art Angels is a massive one and this opener showcased just that.

---

###**Individuality Is Cool!**

**amr** (10): call me cheese cos I love strings

**camerinian** (9): if this gets interludephobia played against it I swear to god

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): she's so goofy… love her

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the strings sets the tone of the album so well

**jasannn** (9): beautiful opener

**memezaharamole** (9): idk, there's just something about listening an intro to an album you know you are just going to listen to the whole way through

**nick1372** (9): love how none of the rest of the album sounds like this. no notes.

**jman457** (8.6): like the start of a tim burton movie

**Stryxen** (8.5): the REAL c xD

**imbaby122** (8.3): grimes could compose eine kleine nachtmusik but mozart couldn’t compose laughing and not being normal.

**celladonn** (8): i don't know what she's saying but i'm living

**darjeelingdotcom** (8): nice eerie opener

**flava** (8): grimes you dont have to specify you are not normal, we know

**MassiveThief** (8): beautiful intro

**Uberpigeon** (8): shes so crazzzyyyy love her

**BaconShoes** (7.5): gorgeous intro but also just an intro

**impla77** (7.5): I’m not like other girls

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): love the instrumental here but I wish it transitioned intro the next song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): me too queen

**oscarbrierley1** (7): orchestra slay

**pig-serpent** (7): Two of my favorite activities!!!

**seasater** (7): wish it were longer its kinda slayy. melancholy lyrics kind scary annoying ending

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): omg she's so quirky i can't take her anywhere

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): the fact that a song with this title was released in 2015 and not 2007 is staggering

**1998tweety** (6): so quirky

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): If this isn’t the most Grimes song name to have ever been Grimesed…

**AzettImpa** (6): idk it’s hard to rate this?

**Keno478** (6): Honestly such a boring and forgettable intro imo

**reput4tionera** (6): it’s pretty i’ll give it that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the joker:

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Shes quirky

**welcome2thejam** (6): I am nervously chucking and looking at my bros because this title is shit only a robot would say

###**In case you haven’t noticed, I'm weird. I’m a weirdo. I don't fit in. And I don't want to fit in. Have you ever seen me without this stupid hat on? That's weird.**

**DirtyRat583** (4): me & my high school bestie

**runaway3212** (4): she's no infinite love without fufillment

**PandaMomentum** (2): what why

**fadedblue09** (1.5): this song has lyrics?????

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): she's so quirky hehe. what was the point if it's not even transitioning into the next song

**vayyiqra** (10): A really nice interlude and beautiful moment on the album (love the cryptic lyrics like "angels will cry when it's raining"), I can see why it wouldn't stand out to everyone, but a breather was needed after "Venus Fly" went as hard as it did.

**nt96** (7): I loved how this was used in the MV. It's a nice respite after 2 electrifying bops before ending it with another.

**seanderlust** (6.5): [Okay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsZu-Owou9M)

After the roof-collapsing banger that is Venus Fly, Life In The Vivid Dream is a significant comedown in energy and IMO quality. The triplet guitar line is cool but this is unfortunately relegated to just being the minute and a half long interlude between Venus Fly and Butterfly, and I think a lot of raters rated accordingly.

---

###**Lucid Dreaming**

**cremeebrulee** (10): me after 10mg of melatonin:

**throwaway-7650** (10): life in the VIVIZ dream (will wake up soon I fear)

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): hot take, this is one of her best songs.

**homestarguy** (9): Uhhh, not this being one of my favorites??? Way too short!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): sounds like a medieval type of track but with lyrics

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): great interlude

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): Is it an "interlude"? Is it just penultimate? Who is to say? Pretty either way.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): it's cute, it's nice, it's pleasant

**BaconShoes** (8): gorgeous lil song

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): actually I want to believe in the inherent goodness of the average person (some exceptions apply)

**plastichaxan** (8): It’s all unintelligible lyrics until she says “What do you mean?” like girl I have the same question

**squeezylemon** (7.8): Claire give us more, for fuck’s sake!!!

**jman457** (7.6): I really wish this a full song, it felt like it was gonna be so epic

**bogo** (7): a good interlude

**darjeelingdotcom** (7): I keep having to go back to this and it’s not making a big impression on me

**seasater** (7): i love it tbh but its just a little wee thing wish it were longer

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this wouldve been so good if it was a full length song, grimes hates her fans so much

**TiltControls** (7): wish it was a bit longer, cause it builds up well but I wish it built to more

**Stryxen** (6.7): sure

**reput4tionera** (6.5): it’s fine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is not bad at all but it’s just kinda a two minute delay to get to the slay closer.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): hello charlotte energy

**fadedblue09** (6): breathe of fresh air after that horrifying song

**imbaby122** (6): delete forever if it was boring (#justicefordeleteforever)

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): I know it's supposed to be an interlude but I honestly wish there was more to this song. It felt like it was slowly building up to something really good like a big chorus or something but instead it just jumpcuts straight to Butterfly. Still a fine song tho.

**Uberpigeon** (6): oh it already ended and i forgot to have thoughts about it

###**Nightmares**

**1998tweety** (5): meh

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Clearly just filler before the masterpiece closer that is Butterfly, oh well

**camerinian** (5): love an interlude doing double duty not just as a break during an album but also a break during the inevitable day one MIA listening party

**runaway3212** (5): this is fine but an interlude

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): oh sorry I was reading something didn't realize this just happened

**welcome2thejam** (5): Dark Sci-Fi Future Renaissance Faire ass music

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): why did she stick a random ballad in omg

**Awkward\_King** (3): one thing about grimes her songs are always gonna be called shit like "the angel who lives under my bed (only on tuesdays)"

**PandaMomentum** (2): slump

**vayyiqra** (9): Even though Grimes herself once called this the worst song on the album, and it does feel a bit filler-ish, I feel the need to defend it a bit: the chorus is really good (especially the delivery of the line "three years later and now you wanna call") and the post-chorus has this nice ethereal sound to it. The little break around 1:50 is a neat moment too, and the strings at the end are a nice touch. While it's outshone by a lot of tracks on the album, I can't say I don't love it too.

**nt96** (7.5): I don't have much to say about this song. Every album has its bops but when your best bops hit high, the ones left behind start looking more mid in the process. This is the case, not a bad song but it can go.

**seanderlust** (5): We lose our third consecutive Art Angels track with Easily. A lot of folks said this was the most forgettable track on Art Angels track and I’m inclined to agree - even with that weird “cleaning a window over floaty synths” bridge, I found myself frequently forgetting how this goes as we were collecting ballots. Grimes herself said this was her least favorite (note to self: double check this is true BEFORE POSTING) so we can tank without much guilt I think.

---

###**Easily one of the best songs**

**darjeelingdotcom** (10): vibes

**jman457** (10): This spoke to the reformed theater kid (derogatory) in me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Genius says this is Grimes’ least favorite song on the album. She has such horrible taste for not appreciating this excellent song that she made.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Had to myself I can’t just interpret every song to my grindr hooking up experiences

**IIIHenryIII** (9): it sounds like angels twerking in heaven

**imbaby122** (9): “easily i’m the sweetest damn thing you ever saw” is easily a top 10 cuntiest lyric ever

**throwaway-7650** (9): maybe if grimes didn't include those damn dolphins screeching/squeaking so loudly it wouldn't be her least fave on the album

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): she gets a whole extra point for that squeaky sneaker breakdown at the end

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this song is what i love about a lot of artangels songs its just like... pretty, the melodies are lovely

**akanewasright** (8): her theater kid moment

**BaconShoes** (8): a vibe

**bogo** (8): some really neat synths in this song

**cocosairdep** (8): the ultimate manic pixie dream girl anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is just such a neat song and not what i was expecting, consider me amused

**MassiveThief** (8): shows how incredible of a songwriter she is

**Stryxen** (8): staring at the ceiling music. If someone asked me to name an art angels album cut i would probably go with this it’s like THE filler grimes song

**asdf1698** (7.5): this is cute but least memorable song on ArtAngels

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Fuck ballads all my homies hate ballads

**fadedblue09** (7): Idk why but I don't hate Grimes' ballad moments as much as I should

**Keno478** (7): I love that whack ass synth breakdown but not much else

**RandomHypnotica** (7): must… resist… mid joke…

**welcome2thejam** (7): Cool of Grimes to sample that 2000s Nike dribbling commercial for the bridge

**homestarguy** (6.5): This is “Easily” not the worst song on the album, I’ll say that!

**pig-serpent** (6): This is easily going out day 1. Gottem!

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Ehhhhhh.

**impla77** (5.5): This is easily one of the most forgettable songs on the album

###**(old man Muppet voice) You know what's easy? My decision to skip this song! OOOOOHOHOHOHO!!!!**

**cremeebrulee** (5): easily the worst song on the album

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (5): again, her production almost feels too fucking good for xmu-core but happens to be scraping its way in there over a pretty meandering pop ditty. HOWEVER, its the lil' quippy percussives. i wanna float and bop around on that. hell, just like that run its own track

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): the last minute is just heelys noises

**reput4tionera** (5): my least fav on the album

**Roxieloxie** (5): have you ever wanted to disappear

**seasater** (5): its good and parts are fine but i find the chorus and piano annoying

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is like a yoghurt covered raisin

**1998tweety** (4): i will easily give this a 4

**camerinian** (4): IGN reviewer voice in fact, there's only one track on the album that you'll easily wanna skip

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): Fruits Basket-core aside from the little ear torture around 2 minutes

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): ouuu i always skip this one

**PandaMomentum** (3): and then it died

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): behe rexha wouldve release this if she could

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): Boring, sorry

**runaway3212** (0): no

**vayyiqra** (9): Another one of the songs where the "cute and wholesome" schtick works best for me, but we understand not everyone has a good relationship with their parents and so it's not going to hit the same (to which I say, if you have a bad relationship with your parents: :hugging:). I do with mine though thankfully, so this is a really pleasant and happy note to end the album on after a bunch of songs that are about "adulting is hard".

**nt96** (8): its cute and ultimately wholesome

**seanderlust** (7): This doesn’t apply to every relationship, but sometimes, a funny thing happens when you go out on your own. As you get distance from your parents, initially you feel a newfound sense of freedom. You’re your own person! You can go to sleep whenever you want and do what you want and you don’t have to answer to anyone!  Isn’t that fun! As the years go on, you may or may not interact again with your folks - again, everyone has a different dynamic with their parents. I can’t tell you how it goes for everyone, but I can tell you how it went for me. I started to view my dad and stepmom, not as parental units hovering in the background like referees in my life, but just as two people with complex needs and uh…complexes. The phone conversations became more pleasant, less tinged with parental anxiety that I’ll be okay and more two grown adults getting to know each other as people - as humans. In moving away from my parents, I feel closer to them than ever.

Anyways this flopped.

---

###**Not Like Regular Moms, Like Cool Moms! Right, Regina?**

**musical\_pyn** (11): There are probably "better" songs in this rate, but this is the song that's going to stick with me the most. My relationship with my parents is one of the things I'm most grateful for--especially because I know for a lot of people their parents really suck--and this song captures the wholesomeness of that feeling like few other songs I've encountered.

**akanewasright** (10): lemme call my mom right now actually 😭

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Thinking back to when my parents took out the carpet in my room as soon as I left for college (I was the last holdout against wood floors) and I got a nasty splinter the first time I came home. They spilled repainting the lime green walls to lavender tho I cannot lie.

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): whoops pressed the one two times and realized oh god this one is the action button season 2 episode 1 part 5 of music for me rn. had to drop to a 10 bc grimes had an 11 that I kept saying "fine you can have it" to. but I do think this entire album is very sweet and eye winking. closing with song about parents and being thankful is sincere so cute. i still live at home and its a matter of my own failed choices. i dont want to be here, but i would be broken without my parents. this is truly a sweet sweet song.

**homestarguy** (10): The single cover to this is just so damn cute, much like this song :)

**plastichaxan** (10): This makes me so nostalgic but like for the future the power they hold is unmatched

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me coming out of my room for the first time in 4 hours to get a glass of water before going right back:

**reput4tionera** (10): i have cried to this

**Stryxen** (10): my parents love trampoline this song is dedicated to THEM

**throwaway-7650** (10): me when I say hi to the parents of the rate (KKB not c/M.I.A.)

**nick1372** (9.5): I don't have to go to therapy to deal with childhood trauma because I have this song

**TiltControls** (9.5): aw this is sweet

**AzettImpa** (9): this is gonna be on repeat when I move out :((

**runaway3212** (9): i luv you mum and dad

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): heartwarming

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): It's sweet!

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): this one took the longest to grow on me, it seemed too precious. as i've grown older (and moved out of my parents' house) though i've come to love it.

**impla77** (8.3): The two most important things in life: sticking to your bedtime and keeping warm

**flava** (8): this is just such a cute and wholesome moment and a nice sweet way to end the album, even if the song is bad, i can’t bring myself to hate this

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I kinda like this one

**imbaby122** (8): i miss my mama so much 😭 (i haven’t voluntarily spoken to my dad in 4 years and that’s totally fine btw)

**ricki** (8): maybe it’s because it’s 4am and im mentally unstable but this moved me more than i’d like to admit

**Roxieloxie** (8): i just moved back from my dorm today so this is making me a tad more emotional than i think it would've if i did this rate any time else

**welcome2thejam** (8): Earthbound ass instrumental

**jman457** (7.8): A nice note to end the album with

**bogo** (7.5): it's cute but it's also unfortunately the weakest non interlude on here i fear

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Cute way to end the album

**shipperondeck** (7.3): i dont really like this as much sonically as i do lyrically. it's cute

**BaconShoes** (7): Totally makes sense with the loose theme of the album and everything, and a cute song, but not the most exciting

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): … I’m gonna call my mum

**frogaranaman** (7): this is just about the holidays

**seasater** (6.5): nice bridge part. i think im a sucker for a big flowy bridge lol

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Very heartwarming way to end the album

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): hey dad, I'm in jail

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): Bit nothing, especially for a closer

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this song is imo the weakest on the album by far and while it makes sense as the closer it also kinda doenst? Idk its weird

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): daddy issues [43]

**pig-serpent** (5): A surprisingly boring way to end this album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): saved slightly by the bridge

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): I swear I heard a version of this on Try Me tbh (like hey, that song sucked, let’s try to replicate it again!)

**camerinian** (4): bizarre that this album bookends with the two tracks where Sarah's at her most cloying

**darjeelingdotcom** (4): this song is whatever but shout out to the video image, super cute Sarah!!! This song is almost thawing my heart cuz I miss my parents a lot, but the song falls so flat for me. But yeah I miss my mom and dad.

**LesApfels** (4): Terrible closer. Sorry to this man

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): maybe im just listening to this song at a bad period of my life but as someone who has very…complicated relationships with both my parents im really not in the mood to hear this. although the song itself is also very boring so even if i was in a good mood i doubt i wouldve been much kinder

**PandaMomentum** (2): gone to sleep

**Awkward\_King** (1): dont even hate this the song just makes me resentful im not sorry

**amr** (0): eh

**cremeebrulee** (0): if my parents loved me i wouldnt be doing rates on the internet or whatever ricki said

**nt96** (10): WHY ISNT THIS A FULL SONG!? WHY TF ISNT IT IN STREAMING!?

**vayyiqra** (8): One genre M.I.A. seems to take a lot of influence from is baile funk, a Brazilian genre that's very abrasive and rhythmic, and I hear it on this track with its weird samples of whistles and clapping, and distorted horns. It's not a bad song, but I see why it was left off the album. It's also too short to develop much, but I like it for what it is.

**seanderlust** (7): Yeah I need a full version of this now.

**throwaway-7650** (10): furry rights?

**Keno478** (9): I know this isn’t on Spotify but it’s so good and fun to dance to.

**imbaby122** (8): this is so arca i likeeeeee

**pig-serpent** (8): Yeah I'd turn down to this.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): As soon as I heard The Partysquad's tag I knew I was in for another banger. This honestly should've been released (psst - do the unreleased songs rate!).

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): energy drink commercial music

**jman457** (7.3): just wish it was longer

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Cool song but not a full song.

**reput4tionera** (7): this is so much but im living for it it’s kind of like the worst parts of early 2010s edm all at once but kinda good

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): uh I couldn’t find this son so I’m going to guess that it was good

**BaconShoes** (6): it’s fun, but I also see why it wasn’t released

**Stryxen** (6): ya it’s alright

###**Gold-Plated Nickel**

**seanderlust** (10): ROBBED! This song started on a high note (my ballot, as a fan of this song) but quickly came crashing down to the borderline between late day 1 and early day 2. In the end, it just couldn’t escape the M.I.A. listening party that today has been. I think raters (correctly) clocked how 2013 this track was but like…this song came out in 2013. It was a product of its time, and M.I.A.’s energy makes up for that in my view. Plus, the idea of refuting YOLO (which was EVERYWHERE in early 2010s culture) through the lens of reincarnation is a really neat idea. And to make it an absolute ass-shaker at the same time? Chef’s kiss. This deserved better and alarms will go off when I enter my voter fraud era to make this songeniality.

**vayyiqra** (10): Can't help but chuckle every time I hear this and she says "I don't even know anymore ... what that even mean tho ?!" because after 15+ years I've had following M.I.A.'s "no filter" approach of saying whatever comes into her head, no matter whether it's based or cringe, yeah ... no further comment. The beat drop on this is of course nuts, as well as the killer "when I enter the building" line, which she was cool enough at the time to deliver unquestioningly. A great track.

**nt96** (8): I like this song but I can understand why many cringed at its obvious reference to YOLO, not the best thing to come out of 2013. It's kinda like uncovering some deeply repressed high school memories you forgot you had….and wished you still did. Speaking of which, DO THE 3MO RATE!

---

###**Yass! A Lovely Anthem!**

**amr** (10): actually pains me this song is in a rate with my daughter pop 2 cos this would easily be my 11 otherwise I don't know a better song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This sounds it could play at a very yassified sporting event.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait this ALSO kinda slays???

**IIIHenryIII** (10): you anly live ance???

**PandaMomentum** (10): why do the rest when you can do this?

**plastichaxan** (10): She’s the baddest bitch in the room until she goes to the next room (unironically)

**Stryxen** (10): this is hitting so hard this listen this is a bit inflated but i have a feeling i dont need to worry for its performance. And it’s just really good!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Is Julianne Moore a particularly high earner or did her name just work in the song? I never understood that line

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): what i would pay to know julianne moore's reaction to this song

**BaconShoes** (9.5): ALARMS GO OFF WHEN I ENTER THE BUILDING

**Low\_Stable7628** (9): oh we're in the banger portion now...

**throwaway-7650** (9): omg they invented karma for taylor to title a midnights song that

**imbaby122** (8.7): why was my first thought “i thought this fucking song was big in germany” like you can’t tell me this isn’t i love it 2.0

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): Feels a bit dated but Still Goes

**fadedblue09** (8.5): sounds like a left-field Rihanna song

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): basing a song off "yolo" is genius

**bogo** (8): it's silly as hell but it's just so fun

**cremeebrulee** (8): yalla habibi

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): Its fun, I like the drop. Not the strongest song but not the weakest

**1998tweety** (7.5): ate a little

**shipperondeck** (7.5): half fun and half annoying

**asdf1698** (7.4): interesting

**Awkward\_King** (7): you anly live ance

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): hey a normal song

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.8): didn't she do this song before?

**akanewasright** (6.6): …this is real heavy handed but at least her message isn’t muddled like some other songs

**camerinian** (6.5): if this was chopped into a DJ mix that lasted up to after the first drop and moved on before the synths got farty, it'd be a 10

**seasater** (6.5): also quite cool. idk how to rate it. i kinda doont love the last monologue but maybe im being classest against her accent

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): You'll Always Live Again

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): HOLY SHITE iz that another SINGAPORE REFERENCE???!! (This isn’t as bad as I remembered… still not great though.)

**Uberpigeon** (6): girl what are u talking about

###***Yearningfor A Lessbad Artist**

**jman457** (5.7): kind of bored me tbh

**homestarguy** (5.5): Responding to Drake feels a bit beneath M.I.A. at this point in her career, no?

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I’m Julianne Moore… so relatable

**darjeelingdotcom** (4): MIA sounds so unenthused on this song here, oddly enough

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Of course it wouldn't be an album from 2013 if it didn't have a song about YOLO

**reput4tionera** (4): i like grating music but this is too much

**impla77** (3): This is dated in a multitude of ways

**nick1372** (3): about three minutes too long

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): what if you took all the worst qualities of every song that was popular in 2012/2013 and put them in one song? the answer is this

**cocosairdep** (2): idk what happened with these singles, but this is horrible

**runaway3212** (2): okay fun part is over

**flava** (1): i just kinda wish i didnt have to think about the term yolo in 2022 tbh

**pig-serpent** (0): The easiest zero I've ever given in my life. MIA is indulging all of her worst tendencies on this song.

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the biggest draws of Pop 2 to me, much as the energetic songs are fun, is how it has this ambient feeling to it (as I said of "Backseat", and many of you love about "Track 10") which meshes well with its electronic sound. I get this song has next to no drums and is slow, and it brings the energy down a lot, so this song may be boring. However the vocals are beautiful with the layering and harmonizing (I don't know much about singing so pretend I do). It's the kind of slower approach to hyperpop that you hear on Hannah Diamond's music which may not go off in the pit at a concert but on the album it's a nice moment.

**nt96** (7.5): That whistle note just sends me. I bought autotune a while back and messed around with the vocals and the pitches. That's what this song reminds me of.

**seanderlust** (5.5): Oh, there she is! Yes, Charli finally makes her entrance in the rate by losing Lucky, the lesser of the two Charli solo tracks. This song never made much of an impression on me - what should be emotional production given the subject matter feels unremarkable and let’s be frank - Charli should not be attempting to hit some of those notes 👀. For the entirety of the rate this was Charli’s first out, but for a while there it was making day 2! But alas, it’s the final result that matters and in the end, it wasn’t so - wait for it - lucky! Thank you, thank you. I’ll be here all week. Tip your wait staff.

## Black Cats (Yes I know these are supposed to be bad luck but that's a lie pushed by Big Dog bc black cats are CUTE!!!!!!)

**akanewasright** (10): this is a ukulele ballad in another universe btw

**pig-serpent** (10): I find it funny how much this song sounds like this mormon brony church hymn mixed with Pachebellel's Cannon. [https://youtu.be/1UgvAJ8pATU](https://youtu.be/1UgvAJ8pATU)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): LOOOOOVE the way she uses autotune as an instrument here

**reput4tionera** (10): have cried to this a few times

**runaway3212** (10): when she says "call you you got no reception" and her voice breaks up I don't think I've ever been more shook by artistry

**Stryxen** (10): i love these way more vulnerable and tender moments during the 2017-2020 charli eras, so THIS and EMOTIONAL have to be some of my favourite charli songs even though this one especially gets so much unnecessary hate. The painfully human emotion amplified by the sounds of technology failing and breaking apart like the track is feeling the pain itself :’(

**asdf1698** (9.9): I love this warped ballad the ending is so heavenly

**bigbigbee** (9.5): “hey this sounds like our old hyperpop rate from 2020”, I say about hyperpop

**cocosairdep** (9.5): one of charli’s best ballads. the autotuned vocals really elevate this one

**darjeelingdotcom** (9.5): charli is the queen of making emotional robot music

**imbaby122** (9.2): crying to the most autotuned song ever, got those r/music bitches sooooo mad

**bogo** (9): predicting that this one will be pretty divisive due to the autotune but i find the use of it to add a lot of beauty to the song

**camerinian** (9): it's literally just clicked for me right now how similar this is to an FKA Twigs track, so I bumped it up a point because yes I'm that easily impressed

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Britney still holds the crown

**shipperondeck** (8.8): realizing i have cried to almost half of this project

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): i'm gonna be bold here, SOMEONE is gonna say "britney outsold"

**MassiveThief** (8.5): probably my least favorite if I HAD to pick. but still beautiful.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): Charli screaming over a meditation beat for a song? yes sign me up

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8.5): beautiful track. I love the moment when her vocals start. This song is the moment this became the album of the winter for me.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): The low-key tune, but very much enjoy the vocal processing on this ditty, adept usage of autotune (or whatever it is, "autotune", "pitch correction", words have lost so much meaning to me).

**BaconShoes** (8): yeah it’s a ballad so not the most exciting, but it’s also kinda lovely and i like all the autotune and stuff

**nick1372** (8): What helps Charli stand out from a lot of hyperpop artists for me, is that she uses the uncanny distored sound to paint ugly, complicated emotions into the soundscape, and this is one of the best examples in her early discography of it. I don't know what I did to Charli but I sure do feel guilt for what I've done.

**plastichaxan** (8): Me feeling shame to give this an 8 like it’s tanking it

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): great ballad, the vocal effects on "you're breaking up" are very clever

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Not terrible but Charli tends to not do so well when the tempo of the song drops and it tries to go in some sorta heartfelt but still distorted direction. Also the leading vocal melody is mid.

**ulikejazz** (7.5): Kanye West wishes he could autotune like this

**jman457** (7.1): Appreciate slower Charli, but wish there was a bit more

**seasater** (7): unfortch its a melancholy one so it cant grab me on first listen too well.. i like the imogen heap wails and production

=====

nt96: TheQueenofVultures (7): This song makes artificial intelligence cry  
throwaway-7650 (7): charli putting her attempt at channeling caroline vocally (and not really succeeding) directly before the collab with caroline herself is a choice  
slimboyfriend (6.5): She breathes a lot which is cool I guess  
moonagenightmares (6.4): the opening got me so interested but then that autotune came in  
impla77 (6.1): some tomodachi life notes at the end there  
1998tweety (6): charli my ears are hurting  
CrimsonROSET (6): i mean yeah he’s a dick for breaking up through phone but but maybe this is a bit much  
CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1 (6): "thinking about getting the dow jones back on track, simply by making a few phonecalls. but certain people have been a bitch to me, so i wont" 8:33 PM · Feb 2, 2018" 4:29 AM · Nov 16, 2016  
memezaharamole (6): I remember her pulling this out at the start of her Primavera set 2019, "interesting choice" as my friend put it, but I do appreciate the almost ethereal production to this song  
welcome2thejam (6): Grower potential  
Walking Under A Ladder  
BleepBloopMusicFan (5.5): This song is fine but it’s mostly me waiting a few minutes for Tears to start.  
fadedblue09 (4.5): I love the atmosphere but overall really underwhelming  
FreeCuddlesAnyone (4): this feels like i'm in gay purgatory  
homestarguy (4): I hate to say it but…Radiohead outsold  
Uberpigeon (4): lucky to escape day 3 maybe  
frogaranaman (3): zzzzzzzzzz  
flava (2.5): space-y and ambientish, and Charli sells it with the autotuned conviction that makes me think only t-pain should be allowed to use autotune. There is also this empty space in the mix that doesn’t really add to the atmosphere of the song and is just very awkwardly there  
cremeebrulee (1): this is not just balladphobia i promise ("i'm not like other girls, i actually dislike this song for other reasons 🤪") but this is genuinely some of charli's weakest songwriting. also is that actually pachelbel's canon being interpolated or am i imagining it  
ricki (1): zzz  
TakeOnMeByA-ha (1): congratulations to mia for making a song that was even worse than this one because this was going to be my 0 up until i listened to that album  
Awkward\_King (0): i just dont get pop 2  
DirtyRat583 (0): is it too much to ask for a drum and a bpm? pleek  
ignitethephoenix (0): imagine being a boring and bad song, pick a struggle  
thisusernameisntlong (0): I don't consider myself lucky to have heard of this song
