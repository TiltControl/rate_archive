[All scores](https://pastebin.com/kiQzPqYM)

**nt96** (7.5): Tommy's verse is ok but the song really shines towards the end where the beat ramps up a notch.

**vayyiqra** (7): There's a good chorus on this by Charli, which I don't think is talked about enough, because we can't seem to get over talking about Tommy Cash's verse with his bizarre lyrics and heavy accent. Having heard his solo music (my friend loves it) his voice is not my thing, but still his lyrics here are silly enough to get away with it. Also, who doesn't love the subtle troll moment with the "Boom Clap" sample? (A song that's a 10, by the way.) I can't hate on his part too much when Charli has a line as awful as "switch it up, bipolar".

**seanderlust** (6): [well](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7I9nFbVgAYB_mj.jpg). For a while this was flirting with making day 3 but then it took a tumble and is instead kicking off day 2 for us. This song was quite controversial - especially, it seems, the Tommy Cash feature seems to have raised some eyebrows. Shoutout to MK‚Äôs ballot for saying he frequently mixes up tommy cash/genesis because when I first read that I briefly forgot Tommy Genesis was a man and I thought he was talking about like‚Ä¶.Genesis the Phil Collins band.

## Scrumptious

**amr** (11): I don't care that it doesn't rhyme this song would be a TWELVE if charli said "switch it up biracial" instead of bipolar like

**BaconShoes** (11): this song is just perfect. The Tommy part is great idc, and the cell phone with the ‚ÄúBoom Clap‚Äù ringtone is just genius. One of my fave Charli songs ever

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): ‚ÄúNo Beats By Dre but beats by your father‚Äù and the fucking Boom Clap ringtone are two cultural resets in the same song, could your fave ever? No? Thought so üíÖ

**akanewasright** (10): Tommy Cash‚Äôs verse rules idc idc

**cremeebrulee** (10): that boom clap sample is the cuntiest thing in the history of music ever

**jman457** (10): This felt like a journey through Charli‚Äôs music career.

**nootnoot781** (10): "no beats by dre but beats by your father" is the best lyric in this rate btw

**pig-serpent** (10): Tommy Cash's verse is easily so bad it's good, you guys are just mean. Who else is rapping about having rape babies with mother nature and then murdering them as revenge? No one!

**plastichaxan** (10): Forcing myself to think of someone when I‚Äôm high even though I just have no thoughts in that state just to relate to this song omg

**runaway3212** (10): BOOM CLAP THE BEST SONG EVER

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I genuinely cannot parse half of Tommy's verse but it's still good imo

**thedoctordances1940** (10): THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING UNDERRATED ALREADY KNOW I'M VOTING IT AS SONGENIALITY BUT LIKE TOMMY CASH IS RIDICULOUSLY GOOD ON THIS HE DOES NOT DESERVE THE JAY PARK COMPARISONS HE'S SO MUCH BETTER AND ALSO THE REST OF THE SONG IS JUST INCREDIBLE TOO LIKE THIS IS TOP 3 MAYBE EVEN TOP 2 ON THE ALBUM AND THE ALBUM IS FUCKING INCREDIBLE ok i'll stop shouting

**imbaby122** (9.5): charli xcx top 10 rapper of our generation.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9.5): Not sure who Tommy Cash is lol. First listen I thought it was Bad Bunny. Solid track tho. I relate to the chorus too much sigh.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.3): Cutting Tommy Cash off with Boom Clap was such an iconic move

**DaHumanTorch** (9): charli needs to stop trying to make tommy cash happen he isn't going to happen

**Keno478** (9): Grown on me so much as well, that production from the bridge to the last chorus is orgasmic.

**MassiveThief** (9): the boom clap callback is so iconic

**cocosairdep** (8.5): tommy‚Äôs verse slaps and I‚Äôm tired of pretending it doesn‚Äôt

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): when i said i love random jumpscares in songs, i didn't mean a quirky white twink

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (8.4): "All music made past the year 1969 is rap. (sseals self in rebuttal proof chamber for 100 years)" 2:49 PM ¬∑ Mar 30, 2016

**shipperondeck** (8.2): tommy cash's verse growing on me, production carries

**sarcasticsobs** (8): God, get Tommy Cash outta here. Coulda been a 10!! Everything else about this is brilliant: Charli's vocal choices, the percussion, the slightly ominous chords during the verses vs. the bright ones in the chorus, that one "groaning" synth, the "Boom Clap" jumpscare into that wild direction change on the bridge, ALMOST every choice made in the post-bridge chorus (god, Tommy, shut UP)

**Uberpigeon** (8): does tommy cash exist outside of charli collabs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is good but at the same time the two seconds of Boom Clap is kinda the best part.

**1998tweety** (7): half of this song is amazing and the other half is meh

**camerinian** (7): Good evening. "Tommy Cash" was a three-year cultural study conducted by the PC School of Music. We are now completed with our research. Thank you for your time.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the thing with this album is that some of the songs get progressively better, at first you're just like, "I don't like it", but then Charli does a full 180 and bam, it hits you and you dead

**jasannn** (7): much needed beat switch up

**oscarbrierley1** (7): something about those edm synths that come in the second chorus really do it for me.

**Stryxen** (7): this song makes me think a lot. Lots of ideas being thrown around, it actually scares me a bit that tommy cash works so well on this even though he doesn‚Äôt but that‚Äôs why it work. All of these points are for the final minute and a half actually

**welcome2thejam** (7): Ending pulling a carry job

**fairytalehigh** (6.8): i'm sorry i just hate tommy cash

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): there's just one too many ideas going on here at once to work, is this what other people hear when they listen to superorganism?

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): I mixed up tommy cash/genesis for the longest time and I would always wonder why I couldn't hear her on this song

**musical\_pyn** (6): the first half of this song is my least favorite part of the album and the last half is one of my favorites

**reput4tionera** (6): THIS SONG IS SO GOOD EXCEPT FOR TOMMY CASH I DONT EVEN HATE TOMMY LIKE THAT BUT I HATE HIS VERSE

**steelstepladder** (6): is that an ignition interpolation üò¨

nt96: ###**Unseasoned**

**bogo** (5.5): this is the one song on the record that I just have never warmed up to. tommy's verse is full of really odd lines that take me out of the song, and the transition from the second chorus to the bridge or whatever feels really abrupt and disjointed, which is a shame cause I do think there are some really nice elements to this song

**homestarguy** (5.5): Drugs are bad

**seasater** (5.5): kinda same comment as last one. its fine theres nothing wrong with it. nice chords. wtf boom clap jumpscare

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): every straight man featured on this album absolutely ruins the song they‚Äôre on

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): Boom Clap Jumpscare

**flava** (5): I‚Äôm sorry I hear that one line as ‚ÄúI was fucked by the NATO‚Äù and I‚Äôm like :confusedsob: . Also quite a few of these lines are pure garbage. Oh and it end on the more choral-inspired outro. What even happened with this song?

**frogaranaman** (5): 8D audio moment

**impla77** (4.7): Yeah there‚Äôs a lot going on here.. Interesting but not a particularly pleasant listening experience

**CrimsonROSET** (4): boom clap jumpscare

**nick1372** (4): only skip on this album. It's like they took 5 different songs and smashed them together with no plan for doing so, and only one and a half of those songs is actually good

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): still don't got this one. BOOM CLAP JUMPSCARE HELLOO? dropped some points for that

**moonagenightmares** (3.5): the fart sounds were not it

**darjeelingdotcom** (3): a white pophead will trash trap music being on the subreddit and then unironically like this

**DirtyRat583** (3): tommy cash is so ass

**ignitethephoenix** (3): what tf was this switch up ‚Ä¶

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): idk who tommy cash is but this song would actually be decent without him

**PandaMomentum** (3): bottoming out

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): not lower solely because boom clap is a 10

**ricki** (2.5): you cant remind me of boom clap and just expect me to not skip this and go listen to that instead

**TiltControls** (2.5): there's some tasty stuff in the back half, but the track doesn't really work as a whole meal

**fadedblue09** (1): I have only heard Tommy Cash twice in my life and I plan on keeping it that way

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is one I'd point to as an example of how KKB wasn't always as cheery as you might think and they didn't suddenly pivot to being a sad and serious band on Time'n'Place - the lyrics to this song are really quite bittersweet, cynical even. That does hit with me given I struggled a lot with education my whole life (undiagnosed learning disabilities will fuck you up) and I hate to say it, I'm one of those insufferable "burnt out former gifted kids". And I did go to university and don't regret it and had a great time learning there, but still, I used to listen to this and feel a twinge of sadness that I was doing that well into my 20s after you're "supposed to" be done and found a job and become "productive". I don't think learning is ever a waste of time, but it is #relatable to many that all that work you put into it feels like it sometimes.

**nt96** (9.5): Get connected! For Free! (Free!) With EDUCATION CONNECTION!!

**seanderlust** (5.7): Didn‚Äôt learn a thing in college [2]. This is a fun and whimsical ode to feeling like your degree is worth absolutely nothing which is [totally a feeling that nobody can relate to right](https://www.finder.com/college-degree-value) ha ha ha so wacky this KKB! This song is very enjoyable and perky but is dragged down IMO by a drop that may once have felt noteworthy and new but now feels dated.

###**Magna Cum Laude**

**TiltControls** (11): this song makes me feel sad for the hat I wasn't allowed to throw : (

**amr** (10): this beat...sarah bonito twerk team captain

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [weeping in unfinished grad school]

**Stryxen** (10): FUCK ACADEMIA good god get me out of here (lied for dramatic effect i actually quite enjoy it)

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I'd cut points for the Pink Flop reference but the actual reference in this song is to Drop It Like It's Hot by Snoop Dogg so they are forgiven.

**throwaway-7650** (10): stealing the comment that's like I could trauma dump but nah

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): i discovered this song after my own graduation so to make up for it, i played it on loop at my sister‚Äôs graduation a few years later <3 she did not appreciate it at the time </3

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): this song is an intricate millennial lament dressed up like a simple celebratory anthem. somehow both triumphant and supremely anxious at the same time, it is a serve.

**homestarguy** (9.5): When my Sim reaches Level 10 in Logic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): me in 2015:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I know most of you are still in school, but oh god I love the little thrill I get every time I go home and don‚Äôt have to do homework. I hope it never fades.

**darjeelingdotcom** (9): honestly I keep failing classes while also flopping in life but also same!!!

**nick1372** (9): the organ in the bridge is GENIUS!! and the freaky breakdown where Sarah contemplates getting a PhD... sarah you're real for that

**rotating3Dtext** (9): man... one day this will be me

**Uberpigeon** (9): this is relatable because i didn't learna a thing anyway, but unrelatable because i did not go to uni

**jman457** (8.6): relate to this alot

**camerinian** (8): wasn't allowed to fucking throw my hat at my graduation, still livid

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): is Kero Kero Bonito also waiting on student loan relief

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): True!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): at the rate i am doing uni work i should not be allowed to listen to this song

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I never attended any of my graduations anyway

**imbaby122** (7.5): which graduation are we talking about here? the dissertation suggests college, the bell ringing suggests high school? i‚Äôm intrigued.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): yes i played this at my graduation no no one got the joke

**Low\_Stable7628** (7): Vitamin C was kinda threatened with this one...

**ricki** (7): this has the same vibe as those novelty songs that were given to random children and would end up going viral because people would make fun of them, think friday, it‚Äôs thanksgiving and my jeans /pos

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (5.5): no. but that outro had ideas.

**seasater** (5.5): boring intro. cool drop. does sound video gamey. was gonna say it before but this song confirms it

**squeezylemon** (5.5): The discussion of when talking on beat becomes rapping is one that I am largely unqualified to have but I feel pretty secure saying this is just talking, and annoying talking at that.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): sounds cool, but these lyrics are atrocious; a kid would've gone deeper than that.

**seanderlust** (9.3): Listen‚Ä¶2013 was a different time. We were only one or two years removed from the Harlem Shake craze on YouTube. I remember the first time I heard it when it first came out and my jaw being on the floor at how hard it went. Was trap-inspired EDM already a thing? Had Diplo already made his spot as a recognizable electronic dance producer? Sure, but I can‚Äôt forget how badly I wanted to dance when this came on in my car. God I miss my CD player.

**nt96** (9): a lot of these sounds are very 2013 but damn is it good! Boasting sounds of Reggae, Trap, Kuduro, Moombahton, this song has one of best uses of genre-switching in this album.

**vayyiqra** (6): After having a moment of liking this song, I had to lower my score after seeing that this is really quite a half-assed attempt at a reggae-ish song and is only good at all because of the Shampoo sample. I've been saying a lot of lyrics on this album feel nonsensical but on this one especially, I have no clue what she is trying to say. Also, the loud synths on the instrumental break are kind of obnoxious, and at the end of the day this is kind of a failed experiment. M.I.A. is good at mixing a lot of disparate genres together, that's always been her thing, but reggae is just not one of them clearly.

---

###**Bursts That Bubble**

**amr** (10): the clap stomp beat that opens this is one I've heard in like a million songs growing up so I'm fully endeared to this song as a result half baked attempt at reggae included SORRY!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): rubble scrubble pubble

**IIIHenryIII** (10): no humble

**plastichaxan** (10): The way this turns into a drag queen performing at my local club here in my country type of mix is kinda cunty

**steelstepladder** (10): I better hear some shampoo during the reveal

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ok maybe this is the best song ever

**BaconShoes** (9.5): makes me wanna shake it

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): the harlem shake ass drop is the only thing bringing this a bit down

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): this 2012 ass drop OMGGGGG

**camerinian** (9): this is dated as fuck but I won't lie this sort of maasive reggae edm fusion scratches an itch I haven't had scratched since Major Lazer sold out (it's always fuck Diplo btw, I just can't deny being 16 in 2013)

**Keno478** (9): The way she blends reggae here with rave music, wild.

**MassiveThief** (9): the reggae section is the funniest shit ever. I actually cackled.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): refuse to believe this title isn't a reference to the legendary Flash game

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): hearing this song for the first time unlocked a core memory of when i was like, 6, watching a kid throw up at a movie theater while shampoo's "trouble" played on the speakers

**1998tweety** (8.5): she kinda ate

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (7.8): love dub, also love official music video Uncensored that brings up 3D printed guns

**fadedblue09** (7.5): this sounds like it could be a Kpop song ngl

**LesApfels** (7.5): Glad to see Shampoo's continued influence

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Reggae??? Also the album should've ended after this song, it's all downhill from here.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): when you accidentally suck up two pearls in your bubble tea

**runaway3212** (7.5): this also slaying

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The production on this one is so insane holy shit, i LOVE this one. The second drop is so nutty!

**seasater** (7): yo this is kinda cool and sique. dance dance ending

**Stryxen** (7): this is the worst song of all time

**reput4tionera** (6.5): i feel like i have to leave a comment on every song but i have no thoughts

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Ngl this kinda sounds like a slightly artsier version of shitty early 2010s EDM

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this one goes on for too long which is weird because she‚Äôs had time lengths good so far

**frogaranaman** (6): my pussy tastes like dubble bubble

**moonagenightmares** (6): this was half-half tbh i liked the first half did not like the second

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes we know "get Shazam" (I don't have it lol) but it's more about the mood it evokes, okay? Haven't you ever had this feeling before, in days of yore when it wasn't easy to find the name of a song and it would get stuck in your head for the longest time before finding it, if you ever did? Maybe it's because music has always been a big part of my life, ever since I was a kid, but this song just feels like a neat ... this is going to sound so corny but it's like a tribute to that and how we connect with music.

**seanderlust** (8.2): The plot twist where Sarah was dreaming the whole time omg M. Night Shamawho? Anyways, this one did not do very well in this rate, earning comparisons to 1D, children‚Äôs music and Car Radio by Twenty One Pilots. As a Kero Kero Bonitj√§rb I don‚Äôt mind this placement - the song is fun and cheery and cheeky but somewhat forgettable in the grand scheme of an excellent album, and in KKB‚Äôs discog it would be better to be bad than mid. Sorry Sarah - as many raters suggested, maybe try the internet?

**nt96** (8): XCX would cover this and I wouldn't blink

---

###**:charlilistening:**

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (11): tbh couldn't decide which KKB deserved this eleven

**bogo** (10): honestly in an alternate universe i could see this being a massive hit, it's endlessly likeable and catchy

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): this is a meta 10. paging u/footnote304 remember the conversation you sparked in the DMD when you asked about "songs about songs you don't realy here" and someone responded with this? Man that was such a good conversation. I really do love when a pop band like Roxy Music (who wrote "Do the Strand" bc Brian Ferry wanted to make up a song about a fake dance but not describe the song to do it to) do shit like this and inadvertently create pop art. KKB imo are on that absolute raw dawg level in their own scatterbrain way. They take us a step farther by turning it into a pretty good as fuck adventure time skit that never loses the wit though--it just is meant to be a serendipitous ditty to enjoy. it helps it stays skeletal, almost sounding like a parody of a litany of really shitty youtube pop that mattybraps, wifi wifey guy, and jacob sartorious mined for the most shallow of rewards; but as soon as you begin to piece everything together you realize "oh wow they're taking me seriously; they're telling me 'hey yeah we too, sometimes hear bangers on the radio and it just sounds like this' and then singing it to me and letting me share the magic of pop music". I simply cannot believe the joy this song causes me; I hope they figure out how to get this energy BACK into LP3 tbh. i know a lot of people hate this and to you all i say "pooey".

**fairytalehigh** (10): we stan a reckless driving queen!

**homestarguy** (10): A Rainbolt video except instead he tries to determine what song Sarah was listening to

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I've been there

**nick1372** (10): for some reason I always imagine the song she's listening to is a Dua track

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me trying to find the song that plays in the background of Season 2 Episode 23 of Parks and Recreation, The Master Plan, where Andy brings April a drink and finds out she's hanging out with Jean Ralphio because he hadn't asked her out and she was getting frustrated:

**reput4tionera** (10): girl just download shazam

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): does Sarah not have Shazam

**sarcasticsobs** (10): "I don't know you but that sounds fresh" - me hearing this record for the first time!

**Stryxen** (10): i‚Äôve never heard a song

**throwaway-7650** (10): why yes, that is what I just did, thank you kero kero bonito!

**TiltControls** (10): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam_(application)

**welcome2thejam** (10): The little sister of Tenacious D's Tribute

**BaconShoes** (9.5): it‚Äôs just so cute and gets stuck in my head like the referenced song

**Uberpigeon** (9): this could have never happened in our post-shazam world

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): banger

**impla77** (8.3): best song ever if it was good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to hear this but she is talking about Heat Waves by Glass Animals.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song is about death grips - i‚Äôve seen footage

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): me talking about Cardboard Box - FLO

**imbaby122** (8): this song sounds like a big time rush cover

**Low\_Stable7628** (8): "insert Addison Rae music tweets"

**PandaMomentum** (8): this sounds fresh

**pikajake** (8): fun fact the song they're singing about is most likely "somebody" by natalie la rose

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): the one that goes bee booboo bop booboo beep

**jman457** (7.6): cute

**camerinian** (7.5): I normally can't stand songs about hearing a song you like cos it always seems like a real cheap way of making your track seem catcher and more significant than it is. This is cute tho so

**DirtyRat583** (7.5): all in my head 2

**MassiveThief** (7.5): this is soooo #relatable #omgee

**plastichaxan** (7.5): I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever done that

**cremeebrulee** (7): i have spongebob brainrot but they really made a whole song based off this scene: https://youtu.be/yYVop6Mv82E

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): isn‚Äôt this the basic concept of One Direction‚Äôs Best Song Ever?

**pig-serpent** (7): A kid ran up to me and yelled "I don't know you, but you lip sync and I drip ink." They're a squid now.

**shipperondeck** (7): kinda boring

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Honestly if I heard this song on the radio, I wouldn‚Äôt last very long before I turned it off either.

**frogaranaman** (6): I like how she just narrates

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Sarah Bonito is the best rapper alive /j

**ricki** (6): dont hug me, im scared music

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): again not for me

**runaway3212** (4): bitch me too

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): no way i also just heard a song too. it wasnt a very good one

**amr** (3): I do like how this inspires visuals of paper animation in my mind like the mv I just directed while listening to this slays. very VOICE by PERFUME

**jasannn** (3): this sounds like a debut track from nugu kpop girl group that has one comeback and disbands after 2 years of silence

**moonagenightmares** (2): kids song they make you listen to in kindergarten

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): boring rather than outright bad which is worse

**flava** (1): the worst thing about this song is it‚Äôs just incredibly boring, while being generically catchy enough to get a little stuck in your head which is a combination worthy of jail. None of the different sounds really come together; the little playful interplay between the band just adds nothing to the song. It isn‚Äôt funny, and it sounds like it could fit in LADN

**ignitethephoenix** (1): this could be a Taylor swift song in another universe

**oscarbrierley1** (1): "that sounds fresh" no it doesn't, it sounds like kids music.

**Hulnia** (0): that‚Ä¶ rapping is embarrassing lol

**seanderlust** (10): And you never get sad and you never get sick and you never have to pee or whatever Grimes said. This was a standout from the album for me - the half-country guitar underlying Grimes‚Äô floating, thoughtful voice is a real treat to my ears. Still, it couldn‚Äôt beat the boring allegations so it rounds out the 30s for us and exits the rate.

**vayyiqra** (10): Another thing I love about this album (did you know I love this album? no bias whatsoever in this rate I've only listened to it about 300 times) is the acoustic guitar moments in between the heavy electro bangers. Not a move anyone expected at the time, but she likes to keep the listener on their toes, you know? It may not be the most "cyberpop" thing on the album for sure, but that strummy little riff is very catchy and one of my favourite things about the song. Another thing is the kind of dark lyrics ("I could leave the world today"; "everybody dies, we cut out their eyes") and the upbeat music playing off each other. This song is quite the grower and went from "next-level mid filler" to "one of the best tracks" for me over time. Anyway many of you are not seeing heaven for doing this to it.

###**Never Gets Sad, Never Gets Sick (Up to Date Vaccines)**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Don‚Äôt tell me what to do. I‚Äôll cry until I throw up if I want to.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is a bit of an overlooked song on the album but it‚Äôs seriously grown on me so much

**pig-serpent** (10): Big Funeral doesn't want you to know that after you die, they will cut out your eyes!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): andyounevergetsadandyounevergetsickandyounevergetweak

**throwaway-7650** (10): selener

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): The vocal rhythms in this are just so immensely satisfying

**plastichaxan** (8.5): I don‚Äôt know what the hell she‚Äôs talking about but girl I‚Äôm living

**imbaby122** (8.3): alllllll i neeeeedddd is a belly and a beat

**impla77** (8.3): God I wish I was creative

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): one of the weaker tracks on the album BUT it never fails to fill me with a warm fuzzy feeling

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): A bit on the sus and vore-y side hermana‚Ä¶

**Awkward\_King** (8): i just saw bones and all....

**BaconShoes** (8): she ate that or something

**homestarguy** (8): Great groove, but again the whole song is just kinda samey and Grimes‚Äô vocals just don‚Äôt really move me

**runaway3212** (8): When the music musics ugh I die

**TiltControls** (8): whenever grimes brings out the guitars I know I'm in for a good time

**Stryxen** (7.5): this is such a grimes title and song concept but it works so well . the vision was so clear this era

**CrimsonROSET** (7): if i had a nickel everytime a song swapped beast to beat in an expression i‚Äôd have two nickels, which isn‚Äôt a lot but its weird it happened twice

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (7): they really just let her keep making videos for this album. they really said "you have great haircutes keep going to places". i couldn't tell you who "they" are nor how much her brother was paid to film most of these.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): not upbeat enough

**reput4tionera** (7): it‚Äôs fine

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): My wife says this album reminds her of the cranberries and I see that

**ulikejazz** (7): This is ALMOST filler..

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): aaaaYYEeeeYeahhha

**akanewasright** (6.5): This is one of those songs that I like‚Ä¶ but would literally never come back to outside of the album. Very cool production, not much else to grab onto for me

**seasater** (6.5): good enough song just doesnt grab me as much. its good though

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): for a song with beat in the title this is so bland

**jman457** (6): bops a little, but kind of boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sounds like it would be on the soundtrack of an indie farming game

**seanderlust** (9.5): Honestly I think this one is a bit underrated. Picture This starts out with an intriguing use of (I think?) pan flute - something that sounds peeled straight out of a 1970s martial arts B-movie. It then peels into a song that sounds an awful lot like another KKB song that‚Äôs more of a fan favorite. I want to give a shoutout to a few things - that low buzzing synth, the looking around sound effect at the end of verse one, and the overall theme of how it‚Äôs important to photograph the things around you so someday you can look back and reminisce. Or [as Moira Rose would put it‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/hSISh_jk6V8?t=68)

**vayyiqra** (9): Do you remember how, in yore-days (around the early to mid-2010s), there was internet discourse about how selfies are bad and millennials are ruining everything by taking too many photos of stuff? Nowadays it seems everyone got over that and it's an accepted part of life, but that was a hot topic for a bit. I like that KKB pushed back a bit here and said "it's okay to take photos of stuff", which seems very obvious and boring today, but I like the positivity anyway.

**nt96** (7): I can picture this in day 2

**Stryxen** (10): i have a very vivid memory of listening to this on repeat and playing minecraft until like 5 am what was wrong with me

**throwaway-7650** (10): it's bugsnax! (as in this literally sounds like it's bugsnax! 2.0)

**Uberpigeon** (10): me walking around every inch of my room with my phone trying to find the perfect lighting and angle combination to take the perfect nude

**welcome2thejam** (10): This song is the reason why you can take selfies in Zelda now btw. No don't look at what year Wind Waker Wii U released

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): That one synth is making me go smooth-brain mode

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.5): :o

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): the bridge really sells this song

**imbaby122** (9.2): this song is so me in my taking facebook mom selfies in every public place i went to era bc i wanted to be a little embarrassing.

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): lon lon ranch type beat

**nick1372** (9): There's so much negativity regarding taking photos/selfies instead of "living in the moment" that this is just such a sweet reminder that it can be wholesome if done healthily. also the almost-spoken word second verse is just incredible

**bigbigbee** (8.5): wow, I did not realize how similar Bugsnax was to this song! They got paid for that like it was a whole new song?

**TiltControls** (8.5): unrelated but this just makes me wish I took more photos of myself/things I did/people I've known when I was younger. Brain memory only goes so far sometimes!

**bogo** (8): i wish i had something more insightful to say about this song than "outsold blondie" but unfortunately i am no thoughts head empty right now

**impla77** (8): was 2016 peak selfie culture?

**plastichaxan** (8): Sorry I forgot what they wanted me to picture cause I don‚Äôt pay attention to lyrics but I‚Äôm sure it was nice

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): look at this photograph

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): i love selfie by the chainsmokers

**jman457** (7.6): like the lyrics of this

**BaconShoes** (7.5): a fun song, but it maybe doesn‚Äôt stand out as much

**CrimsonROSET** (7): memories are such a special thing, like i wish i was smarter about making sure to capture the moments i wanted to keep with me when i was younger

**frogaranaman** (7): Lucy Dacus with that one picture of herself

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't picture things

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): This song and their Bugsnax one definitely share the same DNA

**shipperondeck** (6.8): i forget about this one a lot

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**jasannn** (6.5): its like if bugsnax and princess and the clock had a baby

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): the intro sounds like the white lotus theme song.

**Awkward\_King** (6): i think its clear kkb have grown a lot since this album because while none of these are bad at all they do tend to blend together after a certain point, im glad they started experimenting more

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): instagram is flopping!!

**nt96** (9): the rock sections are giving 90s theme song vibes and it sends me

**vayyiqra** (9): "An existential song contemplating the actions and thoughts of a fish in a bowl" Well then. A cute little song, but not one with a whole lot to analyze in depth here. I like it though. It's literally an ode to a fish, and that rocks. What do fish think about? Nothing, I guess.

**seanderlust** (8): Aw :frown: I really liked this one! It‚Äôs short, sure, but it has twinkly, video game-y music interspersed with sparkling synths and dreamy lyrics about a fish seeking a wider ocean that serves as a pretty brilliant metaphor for the larger subject matter of the album - going out from school into the wide world and not really knowing where to go. Early to mid 20s things. This spanned the gamut of day 2 but never really broke into day 3 nor did it fall to day 1.

---

###**Ichthyologists**

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when I'm visiting Sydney and decide to visit the dentist on Wallaby Way and I see a girl with braces being really annoying to the fishes:

**reput4tionera** (10): this was actually a taylor swift-esque easter egg at their next era (this is actually canon)

**Stryxen** (10): what a gem. Right after Graduation the ‚Äùbut when you find the ocean how will you know where to go‚Äù HITS. really wanted to 11 this honestly

**throwaway-7650** (10): it's giving intro bonito [complimentary] stream sick beat etc.

**Uberpigeon** (10): ra da di da da la di da di daaaa dont pee on the floor use the commadore

**homestarguy** (9): Kind of a Time ‚Äôn‚Äô Place prequel

**Keno478** (9): This song is such a cute little gem; short, sweet, and pretty.

**TiltControls** (9): keep your fish in tanks! with filters and temperature control and stuff!

**AzettImpa** (8.9): I LOVE the breakdown in the middle

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (8.7): i think kate nv is outselling with the bass on Room for the moon, but the accidental steven universegaze flourishes are hype

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): The slightest of hints of what may come on the next record appearing here

**BaconShoes** (8.5): pleasant fish vibes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to hear this but the fish in this song was voiced by Ellen.

**impla77** (8.2): reminds me of my childhood goldfish turning silver due to lack of sun

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): the only time i ever tried showing KKB to someone it was this song and it did NOT land

**CrimsonROSET** (8): where all the fish3 reside

**imbaby122** (8): a song as short as a goldfish‚Äôs memory span!

**jasannn** (8): ANT Farm theme song

**Low\_Stable7628** (8): Middle section eats so hard... low-key the progenitor of Time n' Place

**oscarbrierley1** (8): why do i like the interlude more than most of the album.

**plastichaxan** (8): I had to pause for like 3 full minutes to process this which is like double the length of the song

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the metaphor in this song is a bit eh but I just realized I understood the Japanese lines in this song so yass me omg

**jman457** (7.4): guitar riffs were fun

**1998tweety** (7): this chewed a bit

**Awkward\_King** (7): i love the imagery this song paints. it feels like a pre-cursor to swimming from TnP a little

**bogo** (7): uhh idk fish slay i guess

**frogaranaman** (7): state fair music

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): wait i actually like this

**nick1372** (7): wish it were longer tbh

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The bit from 0:50 to 1:07 is so good

**welcome2thejam** (7): Love me some good oohs, really good ones can really drag a song from the depths

**akanewasright** (6.8): very cute production, but this has never stood out in my mind much

**cremeebrulee** (6): idk what to do when people pull up my previous rate scores like i have a goldfish memory i do not remember doing that

**IIIHenryIII** (6): if this isn't a nursery rhyme with beep bop beats I don't know what that is

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is just theater kid music

**fadedblue09** (5.5): this is cute

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I feel like they could‚Äôve ripped off Slowdive a little better if they actually fucking tried, you know?

**moonagenightmares** (5): nothing more annoying than a ooh-ooh-ooh chorus

**runaway3212** (5): y'all this is so boring

**seasater** (4.5): sounds like stardew valley. oh shit new song for my fish playlist!! kinda boring sorry. its fine

**darjeelingdotcom** (4): why did it only have one good kinda shoegazey part? Sad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the best part about this song is that its short

**amr** (3): I like the little twinkles and when it switches up for a second

###**HELLO???**

**bigbigbee** (6.5): my dad‚Äôs college roommate sealed a crack in the fish bowl with glue but did a bad job, so the glue leaked and the fish looked like it was dying, so my dad took the fish and put It in the toilet. It caused a roommate fight but apparently the fish was much happier there

**nt96** (10): Yakko wished he could've put the ENTIRE circumference of his animaniacussy into teaching geography the way MIA did

**vayyiqra** (9): While it's invoking a couple of standard M.I.A. tropes (the chaotic instrumental brings to mind "Bird Flu" and she lists a bunch of random countries to let you know what a world citizen she is), this is nevertheless quite the "weird banger". After not finding it all that special, it clicked on day and I woke up with that heavily filtered "Ma-tan-GI" in my head. An underwritten and maybe overlong track, but it does give a good taste of what you're in for with this album and its bizarre and repetitive sounds.

**seanderlust** (8.7): As someone else said in the comments, this track has no business going this hard - at least the first three minutes. The rolling drumbeat and hiccuping yelps and screams that make up most of the beat is energizing as fuck, and M.I.A.‚Äôs voice sounds like it‚Äôs coming out of a loudspeaker. Like an announcement saying to get to the floor. That said, it does drag on a bit more than it perhaps should. It feels like a thesis (or manifesto) for the album but lyrically it gets bogged down by ice cream metaphors and out-of-left-field shots at Drake (which won‚Äôt be the last on the album ~~and is a lyrical technique we will later see Drake employ to a much less effective extent yes I‚Äôm talking abou the Megan sneak Drake you‚Äôre still trash for that~~)

---

###**Has A Manifesto**

**cocosairdep** (10): ok this is has no business going this hard

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I feel attacked for the fact that she name dropped basically every other country but mine

**jman457** (10): That transition was smooth wtf, but also shook me.

**MassiveThief** (10): SO cool. so fucking cool. The country listing is SO hard.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): me doing the countries of the world sporcle quiz

**plastichaxan** (10): She mentioned my country!! Automatic 10 üá®üá¥

**RandomHypnotica** (10): damn this animaniacs remix kinda goes off

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Boppin' my head, boppin' my head, boppin' my head, boppin' my head

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): it's like those "learn countries" children songs aside from the children part

**TiltControls** (10): I don't know what magic MIA employed on this song in particular but the production is so sleek

**amr** (9): she may be antivaxx but she believes in palestinian liberation which automatically makes her realer than everyone else in this rate. keep up! always thought it was funny she paired them with greece tho

**PandaMomentum** (9): still moves me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this production is fucking insane

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): Hate her manifesto now though :/

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I really like this but I could do without the consistent screeching if I‚Äôm being completely honest.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): points for namedropping my country

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): reminds me so much of "boyz," it's somehow dark and noisy and colorful and melodic at the same time. underrated banger.

**bogo** (8): every time i listen to this song the only thing i can think about is yakko's world

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): member of the ‚ÄúM.I.A didn‚Äôt shout out my country in this one‚Äù gang

**Keno478** (8): It‚Äôs so simple get to the floor!! This song is so good, I think it‚Äôs only flaw is it goes on a bit too long but otherwise it goes off.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): intro slaps like a track off Arular

**seasater** (8): oh yes. coooooool intro. this slaps. my comments and analysis are getting lazier im sorry. i shouldve listened to the albums in random order. but this is sick. not sure about the 'ping'y bridge near the eend though

**Stryxen** (8): this sounds like putting something too hot in your mouth .

**Uberpigeon** (8): ohh this slaps... i can feel the vaccines exiting my body as we speak

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): HOLY SHITE iz that a SINGAPORE REFERENCE???!!

**apatel27** (7.5): insert animaniacs here

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): ok geography lesson

**imbaby122** (7.5): yeah i have matangi geography class after pronouns english class and then after that i have gay club gym class.

**DirtyRat583** (7.1): this is absolutely fucking insane i kinda love it

**BaconShoes** (7): Drags on a lil, but I don‚Äôt mind and it sets the tone for the album

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the award of most out of nowhere Drake diss goes to

**frogaranaman** (7): outro itches my brain

**moonagenightmares** (7): this wouldve been perfectly satisfying if it was shorter

**reput4tionera** (7): so glad that i waited until i wasn‚Äôt stoned anymore to listen to this album i would‚Äôve gotten a panic attack

**nick1372** (6.5): love the instrumentals here but whats the point of the country list babe

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): it has ideas ig

**1998tweety** (6): theres a lot going on here

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): do NOT come for Yakko Warner‚Äôs job he is my client.

**homestarguy** (6): Oh whoops this reminds me, I forgot to play the worldle today

**ignitethephoenix** (6): me in geography class

**impla77** (6): Is this Yakko core?

**pig-serpent** (6): It's kind of annoying so I go back and forth on it, but there's no denying the hype, especially at the end.

**runaway3212** (6): I actually dont hate this either but it does go on soooo long

**welcome2thejam** (6): I would like more countries yes, you only named like thirty of them

CyberpopRate: ###**Better Get One Presto**

**memezaharamole** (5.8): honestly gets a point for naming just countries (plus two islands) rather than mixing up cities and countries and continents like half the pop stars who fly from Paris to Japan to Africa. Like pick a category, please.

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): music to do the sporcle countries of the world quiz to

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (5.7): It's like a "Be Here Now" moment where you realize "oh fuck we have three minutes to go and this lady's whole shtick is NOT hitting like it should". something here is missing--is it the laundry list of countries and her raps? maybe, but not quite. is it the fact that this song can't fucking stop and keeps tacking fragments of ideas one after the other that don't satisfyingly connect? yeah prolly.

**flava** (5): and now the nations of the world, brought to you by Mathangi Arulpragasam

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): it's giving those "ROSAL√çA fans be like 'yo this shit fire'" tweets

**camerinian** (3): can't wait for the Animaniacs shitpost

**oscarbrierley1** (3): the scream is so piercing that i cannot enjoy the song. it also seems to go on forever.

**shipperondeck** (3): cant believe im saying this but this is too much

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2.5): okay what is this

**ricki** (1): madonna american life

**seanderlust** (9): This was a grower for me! It feels like a stepping stone between Sucker and what would have been XCX World - plus I love Lil Yachty so his verse is a delight. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a rate graph for this one but needless to say this one was never doing well.

**nt96** (6): it's a bit meh for me

**vayyiqra** (3): A Charli song that's always been a disappointment to me, I found this really boring when it dropped and still can't say I like it much at all. The video is also disgusting, but that's an aside; I don't watch it ever. The chorus is just limp and songs about partying tend to bore me unless they bring something else to the table, but this doesn't. Even giving it one last listen to see if my score goes up, nope, the shouty chorus is really annoying. Can you see yourself playing this at a real-life party and everyone enjoying it? I can't. It feels like a fake song for an ad campaign.

###**24 Hour Party People**

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): my poor little meow meow who did nothing wrong I‚Äôm so sorry for what people are about to do

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This truly was Lil Yachty‚Äôs imperial era.

**DirtyRat583** (10): i hate lil yachtys rap but i love the rest of the song too much to tank it

**fairytalehigh** (10): choosing to believe this is the SOPHIE demo and not the lil yachty version so i'm giving this a 10

**IIIHenryIII** (10): can I give this an 11, please??? This is her best track, and you're wrong if you disagree. You know the way Immaterial makes you feel? Well, this song makes me feel the same way. It's pure joy.

**MassiveThief** (10): I don't get why this isn't beloved. Charli's hook is just perfection.

**reput4tionera** (10): this is a banger idc

**steelstepladder** (10): this song was great and deserved much more love

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I love this song, RIP XCX World you wouldve been a legendary flop

**plastichaxan** (9.5): I always forget what Lil Yachty sounds like here there was no need for him to feature at all

**BaconShoes** (9): catchy bop

**imbaby122** (9): ‚Äúi got glitter in my underwear like it was studio 54‚Äù is such an egregious line i fucking love this song

**cocosairdep** (8.5): iconic mv

**jman457** (8.3): this is a lot better than i remember being

**asdf1698** (8): so catchy

**throwaway-7650** (8): it's cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7.6): lil yatchy really collabed with Charli and Carly, which other rapper has catered to popheads as much as him?

**PandaMomentum** (7): never grabbed me

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): good but why men

**LesApfels** (6.5): Not a bad song, but a perplexing choice for a lead single

**impla77** (6.3): its just a bit tame for ripping it up

**shipperondeck** (6): i still dont get this song

**static\_int\_husp** (6): this is actually kinda good (but not Yacht's verse)

**pig-serpent** (5.5): Of all the XCX World songs to actually be released and actually get a music video...

**cremeebrulee** (5): shout out to who, lil yatchy

**nick1372** (5): I'm so glad Charli stopped pushing for mainstream success after this because she does not sound good over 2016-18 era minimalist beats. Despite that, this song is decent. Goes in one ear and out the other.

**bogo** (4): really really pales in comparison to her other songs here, also the video is awful and makes me extremely uncomfortable so i have a vendetta against this

**Stryxen** (4): sometimes charli‚Äôs vocals are so grating to me oo no i do not like this

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): yeah this sucks. being a bit extra harsh to charli in the bonus for being extra kind in the main rate. but this is still one of her worst songs

**vayyiqra** (10): WAKE UP! Relating to this since I have a fucked-up schedule and love staying up late and hate getting up, she is truly just like me for real. If you aren't grabbed by this song and its "slice of life" "relatable" approach to the lyrics, you are going to have a bad time with this album, but I love this shit. Also shoutout to the little interlude with pan pipes, I love whenever KKB uses those.

**seanderlust** (9): KKB at their most ‚Äúshes just like me fr‚Äù with this one. This ode to not wanting to get out of bed even though there‚Äôs adventures to be had has lots of interesting moments - the beeping dial tone-esque synth, the pan flute breakdown, the brassy chorus, an overall bright soundscape. Sarah‚Äôs lyrics are as tongue-in-cheek and cutesy as they have ever been. Still, this song was only briefly in day three and quickly settled itself smack in the middle of the results, finishing at #26.

**nt96** (8.5): you know what? mood

---

###**Woke (Complimentary)**

**akanewasright** (10): me staying in bed instead of going to class

**bogo** (10): she gets me

**cremeebrulee** (10): sarah bonito is something else bc how does she make waking up seem THIS fun

**homestarguy** (10): Sleep Apnea Warriors rise and shine up!!

**musical\_pyn** (10): everything about this works?? somehow?

**nick1372** (10): the fluid bilingualism is one of the core reason this album is so great, and this might be the best example. it's just SO smooth you barely notice when it switches

**plastichaxan** (10): If there‚Äôs something KKB have is songs I use as my alarm that I haven‚Äôt gotten tired of

**reput4tionera** (10): she‚Äôs so me

**sarcasticsobs** (10): COULD IT BE? IT'S KKB. THIS is how you make a thesis statement for a record. Tells you everything about what you are about to go through for the next 36 minutes and 28 seconds. And you know what? They succcessfully provide the arguments to back up said thesis statement. A+, gold star, passing grade, honor roll, Rhodes Scholar, Dean's list, etc.

**Stryxen** (10): yawn

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this was my previous alarm, now it's Bj√∂rk going "thieeez is an alarm call, so wake up, wake up now. beep beep beep beep". can't tell which song I like more

**throwaway-7650** (10): britney spears - work bitch almost made the top 5 of my spotify wrapped this year (it doubled its placement [#6] from last year [#12] actually) simply by being my daily phone alarm clock. IT'S BRITNEY BITCH!

**TiltControls** (10): i listened to that TLOZ mashup so many times leading up to the VGV/VGI reveals that now its the one that plays in my head. this is still a 10 though

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): they‚Äôre just like me fr

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.2): a hard one to rate. old roommate always slept late. coolest man I ever met, please understand. he loved kkb and grimes and replica and early james blake and fleet foxes and modest mouse and and and...once i played this and he agreed "yeah waking up is the hardest thing to do". this song is like a lot but earnestly it seems to be sleepslaying its way through this wombo combo instrumental, just absolutely resonates with me in how it is able to properly pull this off. it could have sucked so fucking bad.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): me watching a rate reveal at 5am:

**Awkward\_King** (9): gm

**CrimsonROSET** (9): qp is this a depression anthem

**PandaMomentum** (9): this is how you do side 1 track 1

**Uberpigeon** (9): sarah understands that waking up is the hardest part shes just like me fr

**jman457** (8.8): This was a fun opening

**BaconShoes** (8.5): They‚Äôre so right, it is hard to wake up

**shipperondeck** (8.2): what's that in the sky? it's KKB!

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): "i'd rather go back to sleep" bitch me too

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): A really great song but I‚Äôm deducting a few points because it activates my fight or flight.

**darjeelingdotcom** (8): honestly‚Ä¶..I‚Äôm smiling

**DirtyRat583** (8): norway that is sarah bonitos wake up sound

**frogaranaman** (8): me rn (I just wanna snooze)

**Keno478** (8): Wake up!

**martian\_pet** (8): not sure which came out first or who is the original muse but this sounds like a don't hug me i'm scared song

**ricki** (8): KINDA BUG AND KINDA SNACK

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): waking up? couldnt be me, ive been in a coma for 15 years and im ignoring all the subliminal signs telling me to snap out of it

**imbaby122** (7.5): kkb songs can venture into don‚Äôt hug me i‚Äôm scared territory sometimes

**impla77** (7.1): nothing can cheer me up about waking up

**pig-serpent** (7): It's iconic, but it's also too much.

**runaway3212** (7): this is kinda too much kkb but is too much kkb even possible

**seasater** (7): never heard this artist before. what a cute voice and accent and song. so cute! are the lyrics as simple as they appear. eh i dont wanna criticise that.. idc about lyrics

**welcome2thejam** (7): You can probably tell if this album will work for you right off the get-go

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Honestly the prime example of a typical KKB song: some glimpses of greatness with the sharp horns, catchy chorus, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. But then, bogged down by Sarah‚Äôs singing voice and the insipid verse instrumentation. This will be a common theme through the record, so‚Ä¶ fitting for a starting track I suppose.

**flava** (6): look despite being incredibly cringe for most of it, I do find it a little endearing, with a cute little chorus

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): The bridge with the chords in it (from 2:06 to 2:27) is so amazing, I wish those chords were throughout the whole song

**Roxieloxie** (6): theres such a jumpscare of going from grimes doing whatever grimes is doing to going to kkb giving me wario ware rhythm game for the nintendo wii

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): eh not for me

CyberpopRate: ###**Just Five More Minutes**

**jasannn** (5.5): this is giving ‚Äúdont hug me I‚Äôm scared‚Äù vibes

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): adding a comment for every kkb track so my ballot doesnt get rejected

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): if this song was my alarm i'd hit the snooze button repeatedly

**oscarbrierley1** (5): the music sounds like someone is hitting random buttons. it sounds like a kids song, but not quite as bad as others on the album.

**amr** (4.4): my distaste for this affectation sarah's voice possesses is no secret but somehow it sounds better when she sings? sing talks? in japanese. something to do with the phonetics maybe. still not a good song

**1998tweety** (4): erm what is this

**ignitethephoenix** (4): the more I listen to them the more I realize they love their pan pipes

**IIIHenryIII** (4): this is a toddler song at its core

**Low\_Stable7628** (4): a snooze tbh

**thedoctordances1940** (3.8): ridiculously annoying start to the album I don't think I'm gonna like this album am I (well I did listen to the album ages ago but I completely forgot that I had so I feel like I'm going in fresh)

**fadedblue09** (3): too obnoxious

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): sounds like a song they would use in don't hug me i'm scared

###**Hit The Snooze Button Twice**

**asdf1698** (0): I can‚Äôt stand this song and it made me dislike the entire album upon first listen. Who is this music for? If I wanted quirky jpop there‚Äôs plenty of actually good music to listen to I really am not into this. The delivery is so uninteresting and the lyrics are not memorable, clever, or poignant

**nt96** (10): I'm calling the police cuz I just witnessed a ROBBERY. Easily the most rambunctious track on the album, it features MIA rapping in a spitfire motion.

**vayyiqra** (10): More of a coda to "Y.A.L.A." than its own song, it works well in that sense as it goes extremely hard and is maybe the song where the loud, overbearing "sensory overload" feel of the album is done best. It really is noisy! As well, note the classic M.I.A. troll lyrics like "get off my dick"; it's gloriously stupid, such as when she mispronounces her own name for the sake of an awful pun with the word "bangin'". Truly: what the fuck is even this song (complimentary). Just bonkers.

**seanderlust** (8.2): This song is batshit but I mean that as a compliment here. In the same way that Come Walk With Me was a ton of ideas mashed together chaotically (derogatory) this is a ton of ideas mashed together chaotically (complimentary). The de-de-de-dem break down with the creaking sound effect creates a really neat soundscape. The all-over-the-map instrumental is assisted by M.I.A. bringing her lyrical A-game; ‚Äúwhy is your tattoo some ugly-looking thing‚Äù is hilarious as is ‚Äúclick click click, please get off my dick‚Äù, and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not me and you it‚Äôs the fucking banks‚Äù is honestly especially based for a take from 2013. All that said, no I don‚Äôt know why the outro is here.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): keep bringing it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is basically just a sophie song

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): woah hyperpop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): i too love Woodpecker No. 1

**1998tweety** (7.5): ate a bit [2]

**apatel27** (7.5): This is just a Major Lazer song

**flava** (7.5): something weirdly compelling about this sonically despite being really annoying

**imbaby122** (7.5): the noize was brought but i would be lying if i said the noize wasn‚Äôt hurting my brain a little.

**frogaranaman** (7): this is just a Major Lazer song

**bogo** (6.5): credit where it's due, she did in fact bring the noise on this one

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Interesting production choices here

**camerinian** (4): I mean, it really is just noise but at least MIA is serving some degree of bars here

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): i‚Äôm blaming this migraine on this album.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): well, you brought noize alright, just wish it was some good ones

**seanderlust** (10): Who‚Äôs Richer: Exodus or Exodus but somebody typoed and now it says the Sex word. (For people who are curious: all I can hear being the difference between Exodus and this is a) the helicopter info replacing the vocals at the beginning, b) a subtle horn section that isn‚Äôt present in the original, and c) idk something else about it just feels like a fuller fleshed-out sound. I think there‚Äôs a subtle hum underneath the verses in this one that isn‚Äôt there in the OG Exodus - not sure what it is though. Maybe a really subtle choral backing? Anyways yeah this one is the first out of the Exodi, and while it started fairly high on the list, it gradually made its way down to a mid-day two placement.

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes it's basically the exact same song as before, and on an already kind-of-long album, that's pushing it. It's pointless, and the "feat. The Weeknd" part is basically a lie here too, but it's a better ending than "Know It Ain't Right", I guess? How else would she even end this confusing mess (complimentary) of an album is an open question. As it is, I'm fine with hearing the same song twice since it's a good song, but yeah it's barely different lmao. I do like the amusing backstory that this song basically only exists because of a typo.

**nt96** (9.5): many were wondering why this existed in the first place. Well apparently, the song was originally titled "This Exodus", but they deleted "This", however they accidently left the S, so it looked like "s Exodus". MIA decided to keep the error. Not much is different from Exodus except the helicopter sounds, nevertheless it‚Äôs a bop.

---

###**Sexy And They Know It**

**runaway3212** (10): More like YASSODUS

**throwaway-7650** (10): the original title being "this exodus" is camp

**cocosairdep** (9.5): I mean, if she‚Äôs going to include the same song twice it might as well be this one

**plastichaxan** (9.5): It‚Äôs kinda funny how this is way better than the other one idk it‚Äôs not even that different but whatever detail changed it made all the difference

**imbaby122** (9.2): my memory is so horrific that i genuinely can‚Äôt tell the difference between this and exodus. pleasantly surprised that i remembered exodus has same lyrics though.

**Low\_Stable7628** (9): exodus the re-up

**Uberpigeon** (9): this is good but its the same as the other one

**TiltControls** (8.5): exodus [nsfw edition]

**impla77** (8.4): The helicopters DO make this better!

**oscarbrierley1** (8.1): i always think that there's going to be a drum n bass breakdown, idk why. i suppose i just expect it to be more different to exodus.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): While I like the ending on "Exodus" more, I like the percussion on this version a teeeeeny bit more (and the helicopter), so extra 0.1 for you!

**1998tweety** (8): its the same song but every word has the letter S at the start

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): The score jump from Exodus is for the slight instrumental bump (I think is the difference? I‚Äôm still traumatized by the previous three songs) and the fact that this album is over thank the Lord

**amr** (8): I love the helicopter sound this is just like succession

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I‚Äôm sure there are significant differences between this and Exodus but I have a hard time hearing them during an album listen. Still a slay but a point off for repetition.

**celladonn** (8): I can barely tell the difference between the two tracks but I think I like Exodus a bit more than this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait this is just- what????

**fairytalehigh** (8): HELICOPTER REMIX

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): she‚Äôs so quirky for this

**PandaMomentum** (8): and the horn section to bring us home

**Stryxen** (8): her own crown slipped a little‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (8): Feel pretty equally between the a two, consider it a draw in the personal battle of the (S)Exodus

**akanewasright** (7.8): exodus is slightly better but this has the funnier name, so who really wins?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I‚Äôm still confused what the difference between exodus and this song is ? But I think this one is better?? Ot maybe cause it‚Äôs like I listened to it twice essentially

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): hearing this just made me like exodus more tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): if I had a nickel for every song in the cyberpop rate that has an alternate version with slightly altered production I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice

**jman457** (7.2): I feel like I heard this track before, but it hit harder the first time

**BaconShoes** (7): a bit more laid back? Kinda lacks the punch of Exodus

**jasannn** (7): idk how this sounds different than exodus and i dont feel like listening to them back to back but this works well a closer

**slimboyfriend** (7): is this the same song but with helicopter noises

**pig-serpent** (5): This isn't bad, but after how bad the last 4 songs were this just isn't enough to make me reinvested in this.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): again? a fucking gain?

**MassiveThief** (2): ...why?

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): why‚Äôd she even make this song fr

###**Ladies and Gentlemen, The Weeknd**

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): ABEL STILL ISNT ON THIS

**seasater** (8): hey ive heard this before!!!! or is it the same as exodus above. idk. i like the tune and brass instrument sounds. drifty backing synths nice. where tf was the weeknd

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i dont really understand why both this AND exodus were both included on the album when this is basically just the same song but more complete sounding, also i feel like that weeknd featuring tag is flat out a lie

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.9): *weeknd voice* stretch that runtime girl!

**fadedblue09** (6.5): calling Abel's presence as a "feature" is generous

**homestarguy** (6): Allegedly The Weeknd is on this track??

**reput4tionera** (6): wait so did the weeknd cowrite this or smth where is he

**vayyiqra** (8): An underwhelming collab at first, given M√ò is an old favourite of mine (was heavily into her debut album in 2014-15) and as well I don't quite get Charli's fascination with cars and her need to work them into so many songs. It's grown on me though and even though its placing in the tracklist is kind of weird with the whiplash between this and the song after it, it's at worst "pretty alright". The way M√ò's voice almost cracks when she hits high notes is musical ASMR to me as well. Maybe underrated song!

**seanderlust** (6): Peep the graph for this one - this one actually had a fairly successful climb to late day 2! This collab between Charli and the main-pop-girl-that-never-was M√ò had its fair share of defenders, but never quite clicked with me. IMO, it feels like a forgettable tracks sandwiched between two all-time classics, and I would argue that as short as it would make the runtime, both this and Delicious being left off the final tracklist would have made Pop 2 a no-skip album (yes, even Lucky don‚Äôt @ me I know what I gave it).

**nt96** (0): im sorry but M√ò's voice is not doing it for me.

###**1969 Porsche Cayenne**

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This used to be my favourite on the record: still really great, I love the synths being used here, the production overall is stellar, and the melody is really nice and sticky. Can sort of see why people might not like it though.

**BaconShoes** (10): one rose layin on your grave cuz you pushed everyone away, but‚Ä¶my mausoleum, pretty like Versailles, and i played it out, bout a thousand times, yeah

**cremeebrulee** (10): this track is definitely a day 1 cut since i‚Äôve never seen anyone talk about highly of it and it‚Äôs unfortunately right before the smasha of the album, but oh my god do i love this one so much üò≠ the subject of working hard to spite an ex is pretty unoriginal and cheesy and maybe a bit problematic in a capitalistic sense, but i can‚Äôt lie and say it doesnt hit close to home! i also love how nonchalant charli‚Äôs delivery is, especially on the ‚Äúone rose laying on your grave / cause you pushed everyone away / but my mausoleum pretty like versaillles‚Äù lines... it goes so fucking hard‚Ä¶. she‚Äôs so right about it being her favorite lyric on pop 2

**frogaranaman** (10): this is a good song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): im so glad this grew on me just in time for the rate

**runaway3212** (10): omg no charli dont buy that porshe, you're gonna crash oh no she cant hear us she has airpods in oh no

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Totally unrelatable song but makes sense for Charli to fantasize about a car who can blame her

**impla77** (8.5): the universal experience of a breakup Porsche

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): The sounds on this are almost‚Ä¶ "tubular"? Like, not in the outdated "'tubular' meaning 'cool' way", like synthetic tubes. Whatever.

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): y'all i think charli wants to fuck a car.

**Awkward\_King** (8): i LOVED this song when i was 14 like....

**bogo** (8): it's probably the most ordinary of the songs on here but I just really love M√ò's voice on here

**nick1372** (8): beat goes HARD

**shipperondeck** (7.7): i always think this is on N1A for whatever reason

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is good but actually might include my least favorite feature on the album.

**homestarguy** (7.5): Prequel to ‚ÄúCrash‚Äù (original joke)

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Honestly, an extremely respectable song to easily be the worst song on the album

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this one is also good

**PandaMomentum** (7): more cars

**seasater** (6.8): my dad has a cat called pawsh=) cute start i like that... noise. drum? synth? no clue. cute song relatively simple but its nice

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): proof that mercedes outsold porsche

**seanderlust** (10): But I thought we liked city pop! If I were to stuff the ballot box for any eliminations from the first few days‚Ä¶.well, given some upcoming elims :eyes: I can‚Äôt say it would be for sure this but this would make the shortlist! I live in a large city and there‚Äôs a particular street downtown that I envision myself walking down, popping in and out of shops, feeling confident and upbeat on a warm spring or summer day. The J-pop influence really shines through on this one. For me, this was an album highlight, but for raters, it spent most of the rate in day two.

**vayyiqra** (10): "This sounds like a video game music" many said. Yes. Yes it does. I love the synths on this and the retro sound of it - listen to the synth bass, lol - and the feeling it evokes of approaching a big city for the first time, a feeling I love. (And no it's not really city pop, but we're willing to call it that for the sake of the bit.)

**jasannn** (9.5): ok popheads, this is actually city-pop now

**camerinian** (9): is this city pop or am I just a dumbass

**Keno478** (8): Love the city pop vibes on this song.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The 80s city-pop vibes here are immaculate

**jman457** (7.5): Ok is this city pop?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): VOTE FOR THE CITY POP RATE!

**moonagenightmares** (6.2): if i cared about citypop i imagine id appreciate the attempt

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Is this what city pop is supposed to sound like? Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt all sound this mid.

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): citypop?

**flava** (2): this one feels particularly plastic, from the faux city pop feel mixed with faux 80s pop feel. Especially with that synth loop that sounds way to wirey. But Sarah Bonito‚Äôs overearnest voice really just makes it seem like this song has just come up to me on the street while im listening to a good song through my headphones, and proceeds to ask me to be its friend while I try to walk around it

**apatel27** (10): Me moving out for Uni

**Awkward\_King** (10): i wish the whole song was as slay as the intro

**homestarguy** (10): Blaring this while rolling into Wichita, KS

**imbaby122** (10): least relatable song ever (hate cities, not feeling good to be me) but i love cosplaying as a cool confident city girl whenever i listen to this song.

**Low\_Stable7628** (10): Kinda honestly, I think they were really ahead of their time...

**shipperondeck** (10): i got lost in my own city while listening to this song. true immersion!

**Uberpigeon** (10): its like the scene from the devil wears prada when shes walking around in the slay outfits montage but like if she was in a wacky kids show instead

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): "that's what I heard someone say!" every true crime documentary, apparently

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.1): BIG CITY NIGHT BAYBEE!!! You're an ODST being dispatched to slay some hunters on the dancefloor. bring a sniper n' jetpack; turn that joystick sensitivity up to 10. it's quickscoping time!

**BaconShoes** (9): urban anthem

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): this instrumental could have easily soundtracked a level in sonic the hedgehog 3

**AzettImpa** (8.1): sounds like it‚Äôs from the Pok√©mon soundtrack lol!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): maybe its just because a lot of the lyrics are in japanese so i don't understand them, but i find this much less cringy than the other songs.

**1998tweety** (7.5): the bop has arrived

**TiltControls** (7.5): this song is sonic adventure 2 coded

**akanewasright** (7.3): maybe I‚Äôve been sleeping on this one

**frogaranaman** (7): this is so me when I‚Äôm in the big city

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this one is also :daisybop:

**Roxieloxie** (7): stan tilly green from big city greens

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): opens like an 80s anime lol

**seasater** (7): love the inntro synths n vibe n funky bass!!! cute n happy still. very synthetic album. as in. in synthesis. like every song goes well together on theme

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Love the instrumental here, but it gets tiring after a while

**memezaharamole** (6.5): tbh I don't hold an attachment to this album like I do the others, so maybe the lack of nostalgia doesn't help with my ratings, however I like the synthwave vibes of this

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): I mean I guess this is neat enough

###**Most Of The Rest Of The Comments (Neg)**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is very sweet and catchy but just doesn‚Äôt have the stickiness and impact of most of the other songs on the album.

**runaway3212** (5.5): this is also boring but also the fakeout at the end kinda slayed

**amr** (5): that one long synth is soooo fun I'm almost mad it's not in a better song lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i cant bring myself to care

**IIIHenryIII** (2): points for that cool synth they underused

**vayyiqra** (10): The mood whiplash between tracks on this album is most clear here with this somber track built around a Weeknd sample (his vocals are only here, if at all, in a barely recognizable form) which ends up being oddly compelling. The religion-themed lyrics have maybe aged interestingly after M.I.A.'s sudden and unexpected conversion to evangelical Christianity this year, but the track is really carried by its instrumental.

**seanderlust** (8): This song is just so smooth and sexy. That Lonely Star sample slaps and legend has it if you buy the record and play it backwards, you can actually hear The Weeknd‚Äôs feature! The instrumental in general sets an incredible atmosphere for M.I.A. to sing wordplay-after-wordplay over. Her voice sounds so good on this track. While this song initially went on a journey reaching down into the valley of mid-day one, it found its feet and a comfortable seat at number 21.

---

###**Let My People Go**

**cremeebrulee** (10): realistically this is the only time we‚Äôre rating lonely star so BABY YOU CAN HAVE IT ALLLLLLLLL THE CARS THE CLOTHES THE JEWELS THE SEX THE HOUSE

**flava** (10): just an incredible little song that fucks hard. The ghost-like strings just driving the momentum of the song, and a great atmosphere that mia actually fits with

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh yeah, well my blood type is no positive so‚Ä¶ I need a hug

**runaway3212** (10): where was this hiding this entire album

**sa5m\_i\_am** (10): why did I not know this existed before this rate. This is when the album really picks up for me

**throwaway-7650** (10): the weeknd really was exiled from the song title in the ballot wow

**Uberpigeon** (10): oh... bitch

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): sexodus outsold

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a total vibe. I fear this will be underrated for some reason

**cocosairdep** (9.5): I can‚Äôt tell if I like this on its own merit or just because I love lonely star. either way this is a bop, and I love how she challenges the original songs‚Äô ethos

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I'm all in for a bible lesson

**imbaby122** (9.2): a melody for the girls who are a little simple.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The Weeknd filling the same role as a female Taylor Swift feature in this song.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is the most normal song on the album so far i like it

**Low\_Stable7628** (9): she's kinda giving Bjork Army of Me x J√≥ga

**pig-serpent** (9): The switch into a slower style with swelling instrumentals is actually working really well for an album that's just been nonstop in your face until this point.

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): the "you ain't gotta christian dior" / "yeah i'm not a christian girl" double entendre is a linguistic masterstroke. i just wish the chorus went harder

**shipperondeck** (8.3): finally something i can understand musically

**akanewasright** (8.2): I think my brain is just poisoned by The Weeknd, I recognized the sample and yassed

**jman457** (8.2): even though The Weeknd got the taylor female collab treatment, this sounds so modern

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): not abel and bad girls carrying this album

**MassiveThief** (8): had to warm up to this one. got pissed originally because the feature feels like a bait and is honestly unnecessary, but the song is good.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): idk why because they both sound almost the same, but i like this slightly less than sexodus

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Was gonna tap my foot and say "This is not a promising stretch of songs, Miss M.I.A.!!", but this grew on me as it went on

**seasater** (8): yay a tune with chords. very nice. she has a nice singing voice too

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the lyrics claim she says exodus in this one but it still sounds like sexodus lol

**TiltControls** (8): who is this The weeknd fellow I'd like to see him get big

**welcome2thejam** (8): This was good but I'm reading the word Sexodus down there and I am concerned

**plastichaxan** (7.8): I love her genius moments in lines like ‚ÄúMy blood type is no negative‚Äù. Never change M.I.A.

**1998tweety** (7.5): the man is barely here

**amr** (7.5): his just isn't as good as lonely star which is already a song I've become burnt out on over the years like I already only listen to the intro and the first verse then tap out. however I do think it's nice if U look at it as a cover :)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): all it took was to sample a Weeknd song to make thing better on this album so far

**impla77** (7.5): Surprised MIA knows her blood type, thought she didn‚Äôt like doctors with needles

**Stryxen** (7.5): and if i say this is mcu film trailer core

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I honestly don‚Äôt know why M.I.A. decided to release two versions of the song when they kinda sound barely different. Oh well. The song is cool but it‚Äôs carried by the sample and we all fucking know it so‚Ä¶

**DirtyRat583** (7): wait where tf was abel on this

**ricki** (7): just fell down to my knees and cried at the sight of a song i could actually fathom listening to

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): still no idea why she made sexodus too when it‚Äôs basically the same song

**seanderlust** (10): No this elimination sucks I‚Äôm going on break.

**vayyiqra** (10): Another "rush of serotonin" song on this album, and one that always makes me happy (that's an oversimplified and inaccurate description of how serotonin works, by the way, but I won't be a pedant about that). Given my default way of doing anything is "avoidant coping + frantic rush of intense work for hours" because of ADHD, which I hate, sometimes I need to be told to chill out and relax, and not feel guilty about it. And this song does that in a fun way, and you can bob your head along to it! And that's what music is meant to do.

###**On Their Hour-Long Lunch Break**

**Roxieloxie** (11): now hold on, am i hearing something,,, i think i am ,, they did it,, they made a 4th kkb song,,,

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): broke: a thought-provoking song criticizing the clenches of capitalism on our society that is especially relevant today with buzzwords like hustle, grind and various letters of the Greek alphabet being thrown around everywhere nonsensely. woke: The Lazy Song for weebs.

**akanewasright** (10): man this song is just so pure

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ended Bruno Mars so EASILY.

**celladonn** (10): this has always been my clear fave from this album, sooo fun and charming

**homestarguy** (10): Smh my head, even KKB isn‚Äôt immune from staffing shortages

**MassiveThief** (10): first song I heard from them and has always been my favorite. aggressively cheesy in the best way possible.

**nick1372** (10): grind culture found dead in a ditch

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when I'm quiet quitting:

**reput4tionera** (10): finals are coming up i have to keep going!!!

**Stryxen** (10): magical chorus. makes me feel so good.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): anti work anthem

**Uberpigeon** (10): theres NOT much better than nothing at all SO TRUE!!!

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.9): this is why haru nemuri can do well on indieheads (i think?). also that fucking breakdown with the voice answering machine is the kind of shit for me. i don't give a shit if you don't think she can rap; i feel like you needed to watch adventure time or just get past your nose to fuck with it

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): I SHOULD go take a break!!

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): she calls them while they're taking a break to tell them that she's not doing anything then hangs up. relatable queen

**CrimsonROSET** (9): honestly sometimes i do forget to just stop for a bit and take some time to myself, so thank you kero kero bonito

**plastichaxan** (9): This is just what I advise everyone

**impla77** (8.6): going to blame Sarah for my hour long breaks after doing 10 mins of work

**camerinian** (8.5): Alexa play the chats smoko

**TiltControls** (8.5): is it really a break if this is just me every day

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): i have never taken a break in my life

**imbaby122** (8.2): but when i say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not much better than nothing at all‚Äù i‚Äôm severely depressed and unmotivated? and it‚Äôs true :(

**BaconShoes** (8): This album is just lovely‚Ä¶ like this song is so endearing

**bogo** (8): it's a little overrated i fear but really cute

**frogaranaman** (8): ayo

**Low\_Stable7628** (8): It's like an indie minimalist postmodern interpretation of an S Club 7 song, y'know?

**shipperondeck** (8): when she says yooooo <3

**throwaway-7650** (8): I wish I knew this album when I took contemporary japanese culture

**welcome2thejam** (8): Commercial-core (complimentary)

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Giving Persona 4 vibes here

**PandaMomentum** (7): slaps

**moonagenightmares** (6.8): im imagining her as the pink wig girl from lazytown

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.7): i, too, take 50-minute breaks for each hour for my essay

**Keno478** (6): One of the less exciting tracks here for me.

**amr** (5.9): most of this album does but this one especially sounds like a song that would be in arthur like those little talking animals would eat this up while walking around their neighborhood

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): was disappointed when she said bye and the song didn't end

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): advice for anyone doing 3mo

**darjeelingdotcom** (4): kind of makes me into capitalism for 3 minutes and 17 seconds. Scary

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I can't stand songs in two different languages, is it so hard to just pick one? I don't mind when it's just a sentence or a phrase in a second language, but entire verses and shit‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs annoying as hell. I hate when artists from my country do that, and that‚Äôs where my trauma comes from

**seanderlust** (8.3): Just when you were doing this rate and thought you were free of Jack Antonoff he is both here and he will be in the Boys MV. You Are Not Immune To Jack Antonoff. Anyways, this one is cute. It‚Äôs very Grimes collaborates with Bleachers - it‚Äôs very if JackOff produced Art Angels. It‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs quite pleasant, then it‚Äôs gone. It plays again some time later and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh right, this one! üôÇ‚Äù Lather, rinse, repeat.

**vayyiqra** (8): Not a song even I listen to a whole lot (in case any of you haven't picked up on it yet, I'm the deranged Grimes stan among your hosts) but it's good. I feel like it ends up sounding way more like "a Bleachers song that happens to have Grimes as a guest singer" than a Grimes song that happens to have Bleachers on it, but I'm fine with Bleachers. Perhaps we should've put "Go" in the bonus instead, which is better-known, but also I was kind of afraid it'd get torn to shreds. But this is a cute song, not amazing but it's fine.

**nick1372** (10): this song pumps 10 gallons of serotonin into my brain I think it's the way she sings "calculate'. ALSO JACK ANTONOFF RIGHTS YES HE CAN TAKE ALL OF YOUR INDIE GIRLIES AND YOU'LL LIKE IT

**plastichaxan** (10): Found out people called her a sell-out for this and Go. Not shocked but kinda upset, both songs are 10s and she wasn‚Äôt a sell-out people just couldn‚Äôt see her evil side until recently :mario:

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm jackoff stan

**IIIHenryIII** (9): there's no way this Collab could go wrong

**Low\_Stable7628** (9): hear me out guys... Jack Antonoff produced Grimes alb-

**RandomHypnotica** (9): why does this have the same vocal melody as RealiTi

**squeezylemon** (9): Fucking figured I‚Äôd adore the Antonoff and Boucher team up. Me, Antonoff stan, constantly putting on fucking clown makeup but let‚Äôs be honest about how much this slaps, which is a LOT! It‚Äôs a Grimes song with some Antonoff smoothness. It really works.

**jman457** (8.7): im sorry, but Jack antonoff can make bops

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): "calculate the entropy" um no ma'am i dropped pre-med for a reason

**DirtyRat583** (8): this collab is so ????? but it isnt that bad either

**impla77** (8): This is cute, but the pedant in me needs to state that you can only calculate change in entropy

**Stryxen** (8): love it! Never really return to it for some reason tho

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): not jack ruining another indie girl >:(

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): Something about the acoustic guitar tone is throwing me off, or maybe I've just heard it too much. I like when it dropped out. The beeping near the end sounds WAY too much like my timer alarm, so that scared me each time it happened. Rest is nice

**imbaby122** (7.5): grimes really wanted to be on the soundtrack for a trashy YA movie adaptation or something

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This would've fit in with the album well enough, but I guess that it would fit in too well and it's just a little too similar to better songs that made the cut. Still well worth listening to.

**reput4tionera** (7.5): it‚Äôs fun

**vayyiqra** (10): A song that's hovering in between "this seems weirdly controversial to me" and "yeah okay I get it". The chorus is very repetitive, and I have my issues with Charli's sudden pivot towards "more repetitive = more better" songwriting from 2016-onward (uh ... about that 0 I gave ...). As well I didn't care for the raspy vocals, and can't help but think Tove's feature was a bit wasted. However I love the instrumental to this so much, those little stabs of synth especially, that it grew on me and now I think it's underrated.

**seanderlust** (7.2): The second track on Pop 2 sees us with another collaboration between two underrated pop girlies (and also ALMA who i‚Äômma keep it real with you chief - I don‚Äôt know who that is). Out Of My Head started low and clawed its way to end of day 2 quickly, but then just hovered there for the remainder of the ballots. Detractors noted the repetitive chorus grating a bit and the SOPHIE production being surprisingly lifeless for a SOPHIE production, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree. It‚Äôs fun, but forgettable with a tracklist filled with (mostly) bangers. Shoutout to my partner who heard me listening to this and was like ‚Äú...is that a pitched-up cat noise?‚Äù.

**nt96** (5): it's ok but to be honest, I'm not big on Tove Lo's voice. The repetition of the chorus doesn't help

---

###**Is Fine With This Song Being Stuck In Their Head**

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Can Tove and Charli please PLEASE please please do another collab one day please especially if they can all be bangers like this! (Also RIP SOPHIE u_u)

**darjeelingdotcom** (10): thinking about the time I said I liked one Tove Lo song and multiple stans asked me to check out 15 of her other songs

**pig-serpent** (10): maybe the catchiest song of the album, and this style fits Tove Lo's voice so well. From what I remember I feel like she's trying capturing this sound elsewhere but not as good.

**runaway3212** (10): A yass moment in time

**BaconShoes** (9.5): This song put me onto ALMA, which I appreciate, and it‚Äôs just exquisite. Tove Lo legend

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): I‚Äôve seen people criticize this album for being too repetitive, but honestly artists use too many words in general and I‚Äôm glad she took a stand.

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): one of the underrated highlights of pop2. the crystalline production, the vocal harmonies, the kylie minogue allusion, and it's somehow hype and low-key. glad to say that i know what a SOPHIE/tove track sounds like. RIP SOPHIE

**plastichaxan** (9.5): This being some of Sophie‚Äôs weakest production and yet being so good wow her power

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.1): "my big sons have made a mess of the garage again after being riled up by the good word of the Lord" 5:26 AM ¬∑ Nov 26, 2014¬∑Twitter Web Client

**bogo** (9): "get outta my outta my head" - me after hearing this song (get it, it's because it's insanely catchy hahahahahaha i do not have any insighful comment for this whatsoever)

**homestarguy** (9): Me to this song

**PandaMomentum** (9): riff to die for

**reput4tionera** (9): yassified h&mcore

**squeezylemon** (9): She‚Äôs a bop, she‚Äôs a vibe, she won‚Äôt ever get outta my head.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): real Sayori shit https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ1RDF3tYYUn9GfXzfrIVUfKNpGPe0H61x5Jg&usqp=CAU

**imbaby122** (8.7): this is a very charli xcx charli xcx song

**1998tweety** (8.5): a bit repetitive but the girls ate this

**jasannn** (8.5): just because it‚Äôs safe doesn‚Äôt mean its bad

**ulikejazz** (8.5): This is itttt

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): When this was the first single from the mixtape I cannot tell you how underwhelmed I was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and here we are

**Keno478** (8): Bop

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): Love Tove Lo. It‚Äôs a bop. Not my fav track, but not bad by any means. Probably the weakest track IMO.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): I think I'm just gonna timestamp production choices that I like when I'm not super super high on the overall song. The chorus chords that first start at 0:40 are very nice, as are the doot-doots that start at the end of the chorus (see 0:57). I also really like the starry sprinkling starting at 3:17 to introduce the outro.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Who stepped on the squeak toy at the end

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why are they killing a squirrel and/or 645AR in the background

**shipperondeck** (7.5): duran duran's sexiest member, john taylor, put this (and a kim petras song) on his favorite modern music playlist. so, he is now even sexier.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): this is probably my least favourite SOPHIE song, it kinda just does‚Ä¶ nothing.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): out of my head out of my head out of my out of my head

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): me whenever I listen to a bop by an artist I'm not the biggest fan of

**jman457** (6.3): A little repetitive tbh, catchy though

**asdf1698** (6.2): My least favourite song on the album

CyberpopRate: ###**Glad This Song Is Out**

**impla77** (6): inexplicably like the squeaking mouse sound or w/e that was, found everything else quite dull

**camerinian** (5.5): awful, awful single choice

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): ALMA's chorus is just horrible

**amr** (5): U can tell this is a sophie song if U listen really closely but that's just cos her production trademarks are so notable. it's like she skimmed a manual on how to make a sophie song and took 0 liberties w the instructions. like it actually upsets me to say the worst song on this is a SOPHIE song that just doesn't sound right!

**frogaranaman** (5): not sure why they added the squeaky duck orgasming sound in the background so much but sure

**Uberpigeon** (5): dont worry this song has no chance of being in my head

**Awkward\_King** (4): the song kinda peaks with tove's verse for me....

**flava** (3): the synths sound nice and synth-y but the lack of any defining hook really lets this song down. The chorus is one of the weakest in the rate, where it just sounds so dry, repetitive and weirdly enough unattached to the rest of the song. It‚Äôs just a weird little song that sounds so awkward. Plus I can barely tell which artist is singing which part, adding to the anonymity of the song.

**seasater** (2.5): boring start. ok the whole thing is kind of boring. have to be honest and say im excluding lyrics from this analysis bc i cant listen to lyrics for all of 3 new albums to me. vibes only. dont like that squeak sample either. catchy i guess

**moonagenightmares** (2): shes a fan of repeating the same few words a ridiculous amount of times for a chorus i guess

**Stryxen** (1): big miss which is unfortunate for so early in the tracklist and kills the incredible backseat momentum. The verses feel so empty and everyone on the (pre-/) choruses sound like they‚Äôre on totally different songs, and some of the vocal moments ‚Ä¶ skull emoji. I was just so bored i like always skip this

**CrimsonROSET** (0): kylie minogue sweetie

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): this song puts everything I don‚Äôt like about this album into one song and surprise, surprise, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Found it really annoying, actually.

**nt96** (10): you know that scene from Elf where Buddy has a plate full of spaghetti and he throws a load of sweets and drizzles it with some syrup before indulging on it? This is the musical equivalent.

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the most shocking robberies to me, I thought for sure this would be one of the higher-placing songs on the album ... you all really liked "Pin" better than this one? Alright then. This is a top 10 Grimes track for me, keeping up her "whatever, fuck the haters" energy of the album. "You're so far behind me" was also a boast that she could back up at the time, when she was at the cutting edge of pop music. That little bleepbloop video game-esque synth riff some of you derided? That's one of the best parts of the song! Not much to analyze about it for me: it's simply an alltimer. I also love the video especially, which is just Grimes and Hana being besties and mugging for the camera in a (real) castle. [UPDATE] you are all sick and wrong for making this go from day 3 to day 2 at the last second

**seanderlust** (6.4): Last track of day two is one that got a resounding ‚Äú....huh.‚Äù out of me once I saw the results! Yeah I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt get the hype for this one. It sounds like a less-evolved version of the prior two tracks. It‚Äôs not bad - just fine and kind of forgettable, which made it a surprise that it almost made day three.

###**Wanted to Be a Princess When They Grew Up**

**amr** (10): songs that eliminate Ur gender dysphoria for 5 minutes and make U go Ukw maybe I AM world princess

**cocosairdep** (10): BOP (stream halfaxa btw)

**cremeebrulee** (10): went to world princess island and they all knew you

**IIIHenryIII** (10): when a song is so perfect you need a part II so you don't ruin it

**moonagenightmares** (10): the euphoria that floods me the second this song comes on‚Ä¶ third 11 contender of the album

**plastichaxan** (10): ‚ÄúI know most likely how I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind‚Äù so just like my rate comments

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I was very close to saying World Princess Part 11. so anthemic, melancholic and catchy at the same time

**seasater** (10): i get this and flesh without blood mixed up a little their vibes are very similar to me. luckily that vibe is immaculate!

**Stryxen** (10): i can never remember exactly which song this title corresponds to but every time i DO listen to it i think wow this is one of the best songs i‚Äôve ever heard. I just have to relisten to remember why every single time as soon as it‚Äôs done

**Uberpigeon** (10): she heard lazytown stingy's song and thought what if this was sung as an amphetamine fairy princess

**imbaby122** (9.7): this song is on my crying playlist even though idk what it‚Äôs about or what she‚Äôs saying most of the time. it‚Äôs just about the vibes.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): the one time i'll be a monarchist

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): #SLAY!

**Awkward\_King** (9): just got back from beautiful princess island. they didn‚Äôt know you. i actually showed them a picture of you and two beautiful princesses threw up.

**bogo** (9): oh this is serving a lot

**homestarguy** (9): Damn those drums are kinda nice with it, and a sweet little bleep-bloopy melody

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): Grimes is just Stingy from LazyTown

**welcome2thejam** (9): Gonna use the Warp Zone to get to World Princess part IV

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): sounds like music you'd hear while k-holing in a casino on one of saturn's moons (complimentary)

**throwaway-7650** (8.8): ariana grande's post-nickelodeon career:

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): I swear she says ‚Äúmasturbate‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmust convince‚Äù I can still NOT hear it at all like are my ears broken or something Jesus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I was gonna make an unreleased rate joke but it turns out part I does in fact exist.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): I'm floating

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i‚Äôll be honest, i haven‚Äôt been listening much to the lyrics in any of these albums but i really like these actually!

**flava** (8): what the hell is this video game ass production (complimentary)

**impla77** (8): this bleep bloop hits!

**jman457** (8): where is part I?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): something about that main synth melody just sounds so‚Ä¶ freeware

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**darjeelingdotcom** (7.5): this one doesn‚Äôt hit as hard for me, again the main synth line is falling to close to something Darude would do lol

**BaconShoes** (7): fits really well on the album, but not my favorite on its own

**Low\_Stable7628** (7): ok Grimes Bonito...

**reput4tionera** (7): i have never heard part one

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.4): i don't know why my brain loses its shit over california, when like 3 other cuts on this album are cut from the same cloth but just happen to go in a slightly different direction that are more "yeah that's fine"; again, even as much as the track is merely pleasant, the outro is exceptional. the synths on this one though, are borderline offensive to all gamers imo.

CyberpopRate: ###**Down With The Monarchy Swag (can someone please find that tiktok)**

**pig-serpent** (6): One of those songs that I constantly realize I forgot to actually listen to long after it's over. It does have a nice synth line though.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this is way too long i tried to listen to it three times in a row and i zoned out each time its doing way too much for its own good

**ignitethephoenix** (5): idk how else to describe this but I think this is what the teenage Na‚Äôvi from Avatar would listen to if they got modern music there

**runaway3212** (5): this is fine

**akanewasright** (4.5): yeah this has never done much for me. I think I just find the main synth (?) line so brightly ugly and off putting that I can‚Äôt really get into it

**TiltControls** (4.5): do i need to listen to the first one to understand this one

**PandaMomentum** (4): I'm so tired

**fadedblue09** (2.5): most torturous 5 minutes of my life

sa5m_i_am: ‚ÄúWomen‚Äù indicates more than 1, typically? Hence my confusion. 

But yeah, I‚Äôm surprised Grimes is hanging on bc Art √Ångels is not particularly interesting? I‚Äôm surprised she outlasted KKB bc they have a bit more going on IMO even if I don‚Äôt like them either. 

And the MIA slander was expected bc this sub has no taste, but I‚Äôll also say that Matangi is still weaker than Arular.
