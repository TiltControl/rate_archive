**nt96** (9.5): Is this what it's like when you take too many poppers?

**seanderlust** (9.4): Quick question as we start - [do you think Charli‚Äôs got it?](https://twitter.com/fckyeahcharli/status/987464485249208320?lang=en).

We‚Äôre starting off Day 3 with the most controversial song in the rate - I Got It! This was missing day 3 until the very last ballot which lifted it above World Princess Part II. This track was extremely divisive for obvious reasons. This reminds me of that one tweet that was like ‚Äú100 gecs fans be like listen to this song it‚Äôs the worst thing i‚Äôve ever heard i love it‚Äù or something like that. Anyways I love this track and CupcakKe literally kills any beat she‚Äôs on so ü§∑the girls that got it got it

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah ... I'm well aware that this is a fan favourite and so I'm singling myself out here for hate (be sweet to me Popheads) but I can't get past my longrunning visceral dislike of this. First of all, it has my old foe, Brooke Candy. While I like the idea of Brooke, and her appearance in the video for Grimes' "Genesis" is cool, my first time running into her musically was on Charli‚Äôs "Cloud Aura" where she delivers a truly godawful verse that I feel is far worse than either of the much-derided features by Jay Park and Tommy Cash. I tried her debut album, but did not like it either; I just don‚Äôt like her voice. Aside from that, CupcakKe does have some memorable one-liners and I like Pabllo's verse fine, but its Achilles heel is that I can't stand the chorus and find it super obnoxious. Given that I hardly ever listen to this song when playing the album, and the last time I saw Charli live (2019) I used this song as a convenient time to go to the bathroom, I think it's fair to 0 it ... so I don‚Äôt want to tank my album average, but I cannot help that I simply hate it lol. \[UPDATE\] also I‚Äôm still seething that this narrowly beat World Princess Part II. fucked up and evil

‚Äî

## Offers On The Table

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): Man I remember very distinctly hating this song when I first heard this record. Poor baby me 5 years ago with my first true abrasive, off-kilter hyperpop exposure. Anyway what an adjustment I‚Äôve had to recognize this as the masterpiece that it is. It bumps, it slaps, it slays, it bangs, it goes so fucking hard that there‚Äôs no way I can‚Äôt let everything else stop and just scream ‚ÄúIGOTTITIGOTTITIGOTTITIGOTTITIGOTTITIGOTTIT‚Äù like chile‚Ä¶ Everyone brings their A-game, even umru behind production: but especially cupcakKe, her verse still has me stunned whenever it comes on. I‚Äôm still waiting for the sequel to Shake It to see how much the limits of this song archetype can be pushed, but this is a phenomenal, insane, off-the-walls track that someone like K\*nye can only hope to put out. I‚Äôm sure this song will probably be one of the first to drop from Pop 2 but whatever, the folks who put 0 on this need to show they‚Äôre tasteless once in a while, right? (jk but this song still slaps /o/ )

**hikk** (11): this will be robbed (anything that isn't #1 counts as being robbed)

**memezaharamole** (11): fagmob assemble!

**plastichaxan** (11): The entire earth moved lives were ruined, ended and fixed this impacted every single person alive or not

**shipperondeck** (11): is this or shake it the greatest song ever made? we still don't know

**1998tweety** (10): they all ate

**amr** (10): songs to listen to when U smack the hat off Ur taller brother who wears a matching outfit in a green variation then stare menacingly outside the car window

**BaconShoes** (10): i feel like this party playlist staple is gonna be tanked and underrated, but real ones get how much of a smash this is. CupcakKe devoured as always

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): People eat at tables?

**bogo** (10): i feel like i'm getting yassified every time i listen to this and it's amazing

**camerinian** (10): anyone know if she got it

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): "might do the obama thing and follow 600000 accounts so people cant get mad at me for following specific guys" 5:59 PM ¬∑ May 18, 2021

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Ariana better watch out: [https://twitter.com/siteptbr/status/1588877673790480384/photo/1](https://twitter.com/siteptbr/status/1588877673790480384/photo/1)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the way this song didn't click until I made the sweetenermore 2 mashup‚Ä¶ brainworms

**reput4tionera** (10): can charli please work with umru again

**runaway3212** (10): POTS AND PANSSSS

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Almost an impulse 11 for me, solely because I saw it live and it changed me. The energy this song had with a crowd, I cannot describe it. Truly a marked moment in my life. Anyways, doesn't get the 11 due to Brooke Candy doing‚Ä¶ ya know‚Ä¶

**Stryxen** (10): cupcakke‚Äôs verse is top 5 music ever and i‚Äôm being so serious

**thedoctordances1940** (10): igotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotitigotit

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I also eat on the couch, but its so I can watch tv while I eat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.9): slurs arent cute sis

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): i just want the person who called ‚Äúnew shapes‚Äù a posse cut to know, you are wrong. this (or shake it) is the real charli posse cut

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): Pabllo and CupcakKe truly elevate this track to banger status, Brooke is the reason it‚Äôs not a 10 but her verse lives rent free in my mind anyways, and Charli wields repetition like a maestro‚Äôs tool. Those who get it, get it!

**cocosairdep** (9.5): get it girl!!

**MassiveThief** (9.5): Pablo ate. Absolutely devoured.

**imbaby122** (9.2): I GOT IT I GOT IT I GOT I GOT IT I GOT IT I GOT ITTTT LYRICAL GENIUS

**celladonn** (9): SO MANY OFFERS ON THE TABLE A BITCH GOTTA EAT ON THE COUCH

**CrimsonROSET** (9): /fades out into undercover martyr

**fairytalehigh** (9): this is the sound of gay brain damage (complimentary)

**frogaranaman** (9): this song is gay rights

**jasannn** (9): lawful chaos

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9): This just slaps, Cupcakke can do no wrong. It goes so hard, I‚Äôd love to see a dubstep remix from Skrillex or Excision. Or hell give it to Flume.

**squeezylemon** (9): Industrial and gritty until that gorgeous Pablo feature. ‚ÄúYellow tape around the body but not measuring waistline‚Äù is low key one of CupcakKe‚Äôs best.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): this feels like a buffet of the best delicacies and Brooke Candy's verse

**homestarguy** (8.5): This one took me a few listens, but now I get it I get it I get it I get it

**pig-serpent** (8.5): Brooke Candy is an iconic staple of the grimiest Charli tracks and I hope that never changes. Feels like a warmup to shake it but it still evolves into a gnasty club banger by the end.

**jman457** (8): I love how intense it is

**Keno478** (8): A BITCH GOTTA EAT ON THE COUCH!!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Pabllo's bridge is probably the best part of the song by far (imo of course)

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.5): Charli is what drags down this song, which is strange since it‚Äôs her own song. She just doesn‚Äôt have much presence or the sort of charisma that compliments any of the three very strong guest features. The ‚ÄúI got it‚Äôs‚Äù are the only place where she really fits

**fadedblue09** (7): Definitely expected this to be way worse considering all people involved

**oscarbrierley1** (7): a bit repetitive, but the pablo vittar part is really good

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): I don't love this but I've come a long way from hating it. Might be my favorite Charli song in 3-4 years at this rate who knows.

**Uberpigeon** (7): this song revolutionised the way i say "i got it" in everyday life forever

CyberpopRate: ###**Firing Their Agent As We Speak**

**Awkward\_King** (6): if i could spend a day anywhere in the world i would spend it inside the head of brooke candy the day she wrote that intro

**welcome2thejam** (6): That had the potential to be way more annoying than it actually was

**DirtyRat583** (5): this song walks a fine line between serving pussy and being SO annoying

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): This score is 90% for cupcakke and 10% for pablo. Because the rest is a 0 contender

**apatel27** (4): Indivdually good, together it's a mess

**seasater** (4): i dont really care for slow bassy boring sexy songs. no interesting synths and stuff. boring boring and repetitive. UGH shit stop doing this charrrliiii i had come to a conclusion but the third act is so cool now!!!!!!!!!!!! i love the ending. unfortunately the rest is so boring n annoying to me it the coool bridge and beats at end only lift it from a 1 to a 4.

**Low\_Stable7628** (3): ummm...

**Roxieloxie** (3): yeah I hear this and I get war flashbacks to 2017 popheads/stan twitter

**impla77** (2): I do like the verses but ‚ÄòI got it‚Äô has lost its meaning

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): like we get it‚Ä¶

**ricki** (2): charli xcx after landing some great collabs and verses: great now make the chorus fucking unbearable

**throwaway-7650** (2): I'm a pabllo akgae

**TiltControls** (1.5): the extra 0.5 is for cupcakke and cupcakke only

**flava** (1): autotuned I Got It ad nauseam over some limp production is not a good idea for a chorus you can‚Äôt not convince me

**moonagenightmares** (0): the 0? shes got it

**seanderlust** (10): This one placing so low day three is a surprise imo! California was the first song to really grip me and never really left my rotation. It was never an 11 contender for me but it was an easy 10 - the cheery beat and buzzing synths make for a fun bait-and-switch to lyrics that deal with Grimes‚Äô ~~Pitchfork basement moment~~ frustration with the music industry. Fun fact: the YouTube video in the playlist credited to the Mitchell and the Machines soundtrack because that was the only video that was available everywhere. Region restrictions you will be dealt with.

**vayyiqra** (10): Surprising to me when I learned this year how many fans think of this song as country, which never even came to mind for me. It's just acoustic pop to me, and its bright and sunny sound pair so well with the upbeat drums and clapping sounds (yes, we know what the beat sample is üëÄ). The vocals on the chorus are rather shrill, which not everyone likes, but I'm well past that. To me this song captures the feeling of not giving a fuck perfectly (as it should, given this song is about not caring what haters say). Given Grimes', uh, complicated relationship with fame and the media, one can't help but see where she's coming from on that - there really was a lot of dumb, bad and sexist discourse about her back in the day. If only she had this self-awareness at all times ... but I digress.

**jasannn** (9.5): once a california girlie, always a calfornia girlie

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): trying to reference that HIMYM bit that‚Äôs like "my parents live in ohio, i live in the moment." but it‚Äôs like i live in california. i also live in a state of depression. maybe i workshop this a bit more

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): this is the the anti-clit (flop) of the album

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): i like it but the chorus saves it from being up there

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): California good. This song fine.

**1998tweety** (7): rihanna ended ha

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song is good but why does she say california like that

**homestarguy** (7): I guess it‚Äôs not the worst song about California

###**I meant ‚ÄúArtangels‚Äù the song not the whole album, but good bit**

**amr** (10): I was told by one of the hosts of this rate that art angels the album is about canada so obviously this song must be about the city of ontario, california and is a deeper metaphor f-

###**We have some good news about that**

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): the drums remind me so much of Pon De Replay

**nt96** (10): this one was a grower for me. Over time I began to appreciate it a lot more and before I knew it, it was on loop

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the most polarizing songs in the rate, to an extent which kind of shocked me, I always thought this was a fan favourite and would do very well. The intriguing little melody at the beginning with the metallic percussion grabbed me, and as well I have a weakness for this kind of "sing-talking" that Sarah does on this song, which I feel is a close cousin of Grimes' faux-cheerleader lines in the chorus on "Kill V. Maim". The lyrics are, we must admit though, kinda cringe (e.g. "you see I'm jackin'" to which most listeners would think "what the hell does that mean", and "I have to rap on tracks" yeah ‚Ä¶ weird line coming from KKB). As well, the theme of "words are kind of meaningless, everyone just says shit" is far from original in music (see: "Wordy Rappinghood" for just one example). However for me this is a strong case of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make it not bop‚Äù.

**seanderlust** (9.3): You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation. Yeah, check that controversy score: this may have been the most discussed song on PH Discord‚Äôs rate channel and for good reason. The best adjective in this group of rate comments I can find is ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù - it‚Äôs UK Garage meets J-pop meets Hey QT-esque hyperpop. Lyrics discuss essentially the same topic as Babylon by Lady Gaga but in a much more off-the-wall fashion. It‚Äôs disorienting but overall quite fun. Lipslap managed to claw its way into day 3 by the skin of its teeth - a placement that I would say fits but this song is bewildering enough that I have no idea where I would rank it.

CyberpopRate: ###**Thinking Caps On**

**CrimsonROSET** (11): this is gonna come in to sweep most 11s/most 0s and i am helping

**akanewasright** (10): why the hell did they make the song about the pointlessness of words a hip house BANGER

**Awkward\_King** (10): i once had a panic attack at a party because the guy i was kinda a thing with made out with another girl and i was overwhelmed and hid in the landing upstairs and looped this song

**BaconShoes** (10): real ones get how much of an absolute slay this is

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): No idea what she‚Äôs talking about, but all I can say is the second synonym of the title is very accurate.

**bogo** (10): idk why i threatened to tank this i guess i must've been in a really bad mood then, luckily i have since repented and realized how good this song is

**camerinian** (10): I'm so into voguing right now

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): b-side banger. super monkey ball. like insane just to open the side with this clusterfuck of energy. that's called pacing kids, which on a 36 minute 12 track album (that should require one moment you have to flip it over), the KKB gang legit know how to fucking do it. sarah also has brilliant talk speaking (across the album) that beats pretty much anyone doing it atm besides florence shaw imo. yeah i like this a lot scurry off haters and cowards who go "boo-hoo"

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): Lipslap haters put on your thinking caps challenge

**frogaranaman** (10): I‚Äôm shocked this gets hate‚Ä¶ I thought we all talked lipslap

**homestarguy** (10): House icons KKB

**plastichaxan** (10): NO, YES, FUCK IT! I AM IN LOVE WITH LIPSLAP AND IT IS IN LOVE WITH ME AND DONT YOU FUCKING GIVE ME THAT LOOK DARJ/FLAVA/ANYONE ELSE WHO TANKED BECAUSE I DIDN‚ÄôT TANK YOUR FAVES. YOU TWO HAVE 0D IT FOR 3 WEEKS AND 3 DAYS BEFORE I EVEN HAD CONSIDERED IT AS AN 11 SO I DIDN‚ÄôT BETRAY YOU. PLUS YOU ARE TERRIBLE FOR EACH OTHER AND YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT AND YOU GUYS CAN ALL JUDGE ME IF YOU WANT I DO NOT CARE. I HAVE NEVER EVER BEEN HAPPIER

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me after applying chapstick:

**reput4tionera** (10): real house music

**runaway3212** (10): this is the first song where the weirdness doesnt take away from the quality

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The 11 contenda. Whimsy captured and shoved through whatever they use for production for 3 minutes and 39 seconds of distilled joy. I'm boogieing in my chair so much rn

**Stryxen** (10): always inspires me to block people on discord

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the zeroes are just lipslap.

**Uberpigeon** (10): im jacking

**welcome2thejam** (10): Don't worry everyone, I saw this song was overflowing with fun, so I added a reservoir underneath to catch it. If you didn't notice, I already added the excess to such fun bops as Big City. You're welcome!

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): this song has so many clever details: the beat picks up exactly when she says "this beat is taking over," how gus/jaime gets a word in when she says "you never get a word in" and it's not even a word (UHHHHH), how this song is about not understanding someone when it's the only song she performs entirely in english. did i mention it also fucks?

**shipperondeck** (9.8): you have all tricked me into listening to UK rap

**imbaby122** (9.4): i NEED to hear this song in a club.

**AzettImpa** (9.2): there‚Äôs something about this that just makes my body move omg. Love her attitude.

**apatel27** (9): üòÄ‚ú®stfu‚ú®üòÄ

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): (hex hector dance mix)

**Low\_Stable7628** (9): Definitely KKB's strongest PC-Music adjacent single.

**PandaMomentum** (9): no this slaps

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): This is so goooooood

**throwaway-7650** (9): [eren voice] YAMEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**jasannn** (8.5): this reminds of that slide whistle episode of Spongebob

**pig-serpent** (8.5): Sarah Bonito does the who "I'm a bad bitch now" rap song better than... well, anyone else I can think of, but especially better than Rina.

**TiltControls** (8.5): someone just got a new sound effect board (complimentary)

**jman457** (8.3): Groovy

**ignitethephoenix** (8): idk what this means I‚Äôm bopping

**nick1372** (8): KKB is the kind of music you listen to when that annoying girl in class is spreading gay rumors about you but you can't do anything about it so you just go home and listen to indie records MUCH cooler than hers. Take that Stacy!

**seasater** (8): heyo new sound!!! this would make a great hard dnb remix. FUCK YES another fish mention yesss. idk i really vibe w this one. reminds me of the "shes homeless" song i think? or something like that.

**1998tweety** (7.5): its giving cvnty

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Probably the best KKB song there is where Sarah‚Äôs voice serves the instrumentation well tbh.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i called this the ‚Äúmake believe‚Äù of the album before, so i would like to formally apologize. this is kinda good unlike make believe

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7.5): one of the more interesting tracks for me

**fadedblue09** (7): A fire beat wasted on irritating vocals

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is low-key reminding me of a Madonna song

**Keno478** (7): This one the productions a little too absurd for me, do like parts of it though.

**MassiveThief** (7): kinda sucks. kinda slays. idk

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): is this what people hear when they find hyperpop annoying? I know it‚Äôs a fan fave but I can‚Äôt fully love this, sorry Bonitoheads

**memezaharamole** (6.2): the beat gives me SOPHIE, which I always hold dear to the heart.

CyberpopRate: ###**Never Gets A Word In (uhh-)**

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): well I see why this has created so much discourse. On one hand it's egregiously annoying even by their standards but it also definitely has one of the best instrumentals on the album. Not enough to make up for the annoying parts but at least I will not be joining the 0s for this

**oscarbrierley1** (5): i like the instrumental, but i hate the lyrics. especially the phrase lipslap, it just makes me think of mouth sounds and close ups of peoples mouths.

**moonagenightmares** (4): im only halfway through this album and i feel like im going insane

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i thought maybe the haters were exaggerating about this one but no it really is that annoying and irritating

**amr** (2): very fun beat but I hate everything else like just a very irritating song

**darjeelingdotcom** ~~(0):~~ ~~**11:**~~ 0: I‚Äôm so uncomfortable

##**I Can't Believe It's Not Rap (It Isn't)**

**flava** (0): one of the most aggressively bad songs I‚Äôve heard in a rate in a while, mixing some truly unidentifiable hyperpop-inspired production (with no fucking groove or melody). Just wonking around with different sounds. And yeah making me hear Sarah Bonito rap is a crime worthy of any 0

**impla77** (0): does this count as rapping??

**indie\_fan\_** (0): "Can't believe I have to rap on tracks-" yeah no that's all i need to hear for my tanking here to be justified

###**As A Fan Of Lipslap This Caused Me Immediate Psychic Damage Because It‚Äôs Sort Of True

**Roxieloxie** (8): oh this is the song thats breaking #rates, this is just nintendo ds imagine fashion designerz music

**vayyiqra** (10): Might be weird to call this one of the most nostalgic songs in this rate, but did you know "nostalgia" comes from the Greek for "old pain"? The lyrics to this song are so vivid ("drunk in a parking lot just after 3"; "lighter and a safety pin") and kind of dark, being about a destructive friendship that didn't seem to end well, not to mention the references to self-harm. Many of us have had those kinds of experiences with chaotic or unhealthy friendships; I sure did in my youth, so it reminds me of those days. This is another one where the upbeat sound of the chorus really contrasts with the downer lyrics, and as I keep saying that's something I really like about this album.

**seanderlust** (7.9): Art Angels in general, imo, was top-tier grimes ‚Äútake a bunch of random sound influences and make them sound like an upbeat pop song with depressing lyrics‚Äù, and this track is a great example of that. Overall the soundscape here is really interesting - it feels like a straightforward pop song but there are small little musical moments that are just left-field enough to be interesting but not off-putting. Also side bar: we have just now eliminated over half of Art Angels. Pretty impressive Claire.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): perfect song which describes the falling-out of a friendship which you believed would be lifelong‚Ä¶le sigh

**pig-serpent** (10): Always been one of my favorites from the album. The rawest version of the album's sound with plenty of random noises thrown in to raise interest.

**plastichaxan** (10): Grimes being a talented musician and a real communist WAS too good to be true

**RandomHypnotica** (10): rate hosts fighting for their life against main pod girl, jukebox, ph charts and ama's to get pin space

**seasater** (10): this song is so punk and lyrics are swagy and heartfelt (sorry other artists i dont know your lyrics so this isnt totally fair) and its a fun fun song too

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): me when I press somewhere randomly on Google Maps

**fairytalehigh** (7.3): i could never shake the feeling that this song feels... unfinished.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): There are like 3 or 4 (maybe more) little specific "pops" in this that drive me so insane that I have to dock points off the song as a whole (see 1:36 and 1:43 for an example).

**jman457** (7): alright

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): shes so obsessed with making the same song over and over again in this album isnt she

**vayyiqra** (10): A song that never fails to make me happy, given my love of Canadian music and being a musician myself, and this her tribute to the city of Montreal where she began her career. While I'm from Ontario and not Quebec, this song also reminds me of my best friend, who also loves Grimes and now lives in another city, and this is her favourite song on the album. It's unabashedly just a simple and happy song that brings up a lot of good memories for me.

**seanderlust** (8): And with that, Artangels floats up to the great \[RATE REVEAL\] in the sky. After some initial turbulence, this song nestled into early day 3 for most of the rating period. I personally really like this song, though it does feel like somewhat of a comedown after the preceding track in the album‚Äôs tracklist. Also for some reason if AA were a feature-length film, this would be a great end-credits track.

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah we know, Caroline's screeching like she's being strangled to death is maybe not to everyone's taste and seems like a love-it-or-hate-it thing. As a not-that-big enjoyer of her music (I wish I liked it more), she is a very good singer, and one wonders if that was the best use of her here. However the chorus to this is great with Charli's vocals over those synth arpeggios.

**nt96** (9): when I was younger, I remember reading the shampoo labels that usually say "tear-free". So what did I do? Put in my eyes, of course! It hurt like hell and that's when I learned it meant tear as in breaking, not crying. This story has nothing to do with my score but aren't you glad I shared this with you? Anyway, I love pterodactyl screams in my pop music, we need more of that!

**seanderlust** (8.5): We have arrived at the Caroline Polachek collab of the album that will make a listener, for better or worse, say ‚Äúyep, that‚Äôs Caroline Polachek.‚Äù Personally, I really like the beat and synths, and Caroline‚Äôs screechy scream??? I have ascended. Also isn‚Äôt it wild that we have just *now* lost over half Charli‚Äôs album, as we move into the top ten?? I wonder how that will play out ha ha ha. üôÇ

**Stryxen** (10): 3 years ago and this would have been my immediate 11, like the blown about percussion and the background screaming, it‚Äôs so disorienting but simultaneously IN YOUR FACE i almost get dizzy listening to this. I also love the lyrics ‚ÄúSay your name so nervously now / Kiss in a hallway / Fade out‚Äù for some reason. It‚Äôs since grown off me from absolutely loving it but i can‚Äôt help getting a bit excited just for how much i used to ADORE this song. Me and caroline have been enemies recently but pang and chairlift exist so she‚Äôs forgiven for the meantime

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): peak of sad girl music -person who hasn't heard a single Lana or Lorde song

**throwaway-7650** (10): imagine if grimes got caroline on scream

**shipperondeck** (9.8): so who else unironically listens to this song and backseat during a mental breakdown

**memezaharamole** (9.2): i'm crying?

**buddhacharm** (9): This used to be thee song for me but I realized over time that maybe I don't like Caroline Polachek, so -1

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9): "congress members fighting over who can scream 'halo 5' the loudest, until a senior member stands up and yells "halo 6", infuriating them all" - 11:31 AM ¬∑ Jun 2, 2010¬∑Twitter Web Client

**fadedblue09** (9): I can see this growing on me a lot

**Keno478** (9): This one has grown on me so much, the production on the bridge is absolutely immaculate

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): i wish it was socially appropriate to just scream, i feel like if i could just do it once i can relieve like 6 years of stress immediately

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): caroline's background shrieks ARE homosexuality itself in 2017, i don't make the rules

**ricki** (8.2): i like tears a lot, if only i could get an ocean of them‚Ä¶..

**DirtyRat583** (8): scissor running down my face

**flava** (8): caroline polachek you are my worstie but this song isnt bad so‚Ä¶

**homestarguy** (8): When I see a cute dog in a sweater

**impla77** (8): love Caroline singing the chorus while Charli screams like she‚Äôs being murdered

**PandaMomentum** (8): CP!

**pig-serpent** (8): I always thought that Porsche would be the last song I would name from this album if asked, but it turns out it's this one... This song isn't bad enough to deserve that but I guess it's one of the weaker cuts here so it checks out.

**Uberpigeon** (8): this is what i wanted that chairlift crying song to sound like

**asdf1698** (7.9): Love Caroline Polachek

**seasater** (7.7): nice voice and singing and wailing and scratchy wailing. lyrics kinda annoying. ugh shit the third act is spectacular. gains 1.5 points right off for that. oomf . what do i do... i do love carolines voice too.

**1998tweety** (7.5): i cant decide if i like the background screaming

**jman457** (7.3): a pretty track

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I still remember that fucking ‚ÄúCheck like Caroline Pola‚Äù line from Thos Moser like I don‚Äôt remember the rest of the song that line lives in my head RENT FREE Jesus Christ

**moonagenightmares** (7): the scream added spice

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): caroline's screeching during the second chorus is both iconic and annoying

CyberpopRate: ###**Repressed Emotion (fighting the CRJ reference so hard rn)**

**celladonn** (6): you would really think a collab between these two would be a bit more memorable

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): half of this song kinda just sounds like the gopher screaming in the god is a woman video

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): the screaming would have absolutely gone off in another song where it didn‚Äôt just feel like an afternote like it does here. Caroline here sounds a bit bored, which is very common with the first half of this album, and while I would suggest ‚Äúmaybe that‚Äôs how people with British accents just sound‚Äù, that‚Äôs not the case here.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): she‚Äôs so crazy haha love her

**frogaranaman** (4): interesting song. didn‚Äôt need the elongated harrowing scream in the background, but was a nice touch to keep me engaged with the track for a bit

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): not Caroline being in the worst track from two separate Charli projects‚Ä¶. damn double homicide.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): such a weak chorus and then she repeats it a kajillion times

**darjeelingdotcom** (1): I am sorry I keep ‚Äúnot connecting‚Äù with Caroline Polachek and this furthers that. I absolutely despise the screaming at the end, makes me physically upset

**vayyiqra** (10): It's hard for me to begin talking about this song. I feel the oddest mix of emotions when the opening notes play - hopeful, sad, wistful? \[Trauma dump\] I feel a weird connection to this song. You see, this song almost didn't exist. I almost didn't exist - I almost died when I was born and spent days in the hospital as a newborn. Fucked up but true. \[End\] But I love that it made it onto the album anyway, even if she had to remake the whole thing - it's not a very popular take, but I really feel the change to a brighter sound was for the better. The strangest thing to me is how I've seen takes that it's happy and inspiring. For me, this is maybe the single bleakest, most depressing song Grimes has ever made, only dressed up as an upbeat pop song. I called it "existential" and it is: life is a struggle, sometimes happy ("there were moments when it seemed okay," she sings) but still fleeting. This is the kind of song that plays in my head when I wake up and look out the window at the grey skies and think "I don't want to get up, I can't do this" and then have to do it anyway. This was my 11 for the longest time and I wish I hadn't chickened out and given that to a different song because I knew this one wouldn‚Äôt win. It's the song I have the deepest feelings about and my true favourite Grimes song, maybe my favourite song ever. An underrated feature of it is the extended outro, which I need to process a bit before moving onto the next song lol. This song fucks me up emotionally in the best way and captures a complex feeling so well with not even that many lyrics. A happy song? There are mountains to climb? Yeah - like Sisyphus pushing the rock up his hill every day. But that's life.

**seanderlust** (8): Can you believe there was a brief moment this was the last track in Day 1? Realiti is incredible. I‚Äôm going to skip the demo vs album [Popheads Civil War](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MTgyNjAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzMDkyODE@._V1_.jpg) \- you can check my bonus rate comment for that one. Overall this is a great mid-tempo track from Grimes with arguably one of my favorite choruses on the album, but the track does tend to lose me a little during the chorus. The text painting in the pre-chorus with the ascending and descending notes on ‚Äúevery morning there‚Äôs a mountain to climb‚Äù is a really nice touch though. Now that it‚Äôs out, welcome to ~~Realiti~~ the top ten!

CyberpopRate: ###**Real Ones**

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): honestly a contender for my favourite song ever. it just has such a simultaneously timeless and nostalgic feel to it

**runaway3212** (11): If grimes wasn't grimes "everyday there are mountains to climb" would already be tatted on my body

**seasater** (11): kept switching my 11 from this to kill v maim but i think realiti wins out its just so good. i like the demo equally. love the extra juice and jazz and pizazz on this version though, love the clicky beat and hollow synths and lyrics (yes baby im gonna climb that fucking mountain) and the oooohs at the end.

**throwaway-7650** (11): real

**asdf1698** (10): perfection

**BaconShoes** (10): the way the song pulses and chugs along is just so stun. Kinda crazy this didn‚Äôt make it on every version of the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Omg this song is for sure playing at ALL the clubs in the underworld fourteen devil emojis

**bogo** (10): really really beautiful

**cocosairdep** (10): ended fiction I fear

**darjeelingdotcom** (10): maybe I should stop hating Magdalena Bay cuz this slaps

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this feels like a trip in space i love it so much

**handmadeh3aven** (10): I think this song is just perfect it's so wistful and beautiful

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if this wasn't in one of those FIFA games, they made a terrible mistake

**plastichaxan** (10): Okay but what if one morning you have to climb the Hyperballad mountain and Bj√∂rk is at the top throwing little things like car parts, bottles and cutlery or whatever she finds lying around‚Ä¶ then what?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): harry styles to florence pugh:

**Stryxen** (10): perfect song to play while driving at night i‚Äôm correct

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): only a 10 because it reminds me of All Fired Up by the Saturdays. also she spoofed the title from Capsule üò†

**Uberpigeon** (10): OH BABY EVERY MORNING THERE ARE MOUNTAINS TO CLIMB TAKING ALL MY TIME OH WHEN I GET UP THIS IS WHAT I SEE WELCOME TO REALITI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Great melodies

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Can someone tell Grimes that normal people would not go on hikes the first thing in the morning please

**1998tweety** (9): ascending a little bit

**CrimsonROSET** (9): why isn‚Äôt this in euphoria

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9): one of the cuts that got workshopped so hard she put the demo on because it was also, about as good as this cut. realiti's ethereality feels a little more blunt and hands on in a way that I found a good chunk of the previous bops never to properly implement; it feels like an actual song. even the lil' chippy synths that recall cod montages are implemented in a way that keeps the synth pop gamer logic going, while also really winning me over. realiti's whole package feels like artifice making a strong case its the real thing...and I love that immensely

**ignitethephoenix** (9): surprisingly vibing to this

**PandaMomentum** (9): yeah baby, this is pop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): there are some parts I don't vibe with, but this is by far the best song on the album

**impla77** (8.1): This is background music in the best way. Like I can imagine wondering around ancient ruins and totally being in the vibe

**Awkward\_King** (8): girl this isnt reality if reality was like this i might actually be happy

**frogaranaman** (8): that‚Äôs not how you spell it

**jman457** (7.7): this was a pretty journey

**homestarguy** (7.5): Perfectly functional dance track!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The big song from this album that took the longest to grow on me, but I still think it's probably the worst single.

**reput4tionera** (7.5): i remember liking this song more in the past

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): Maybe its cause i overplayed the demo for a year

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): I prefer when Grimes goes more ethereal and synth-y

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this has vibes of a song that plays in the credits of a kids animated movie

**seanderlust** (10): This is so cute and I‚Äôm pleased it came in third ~~because I kind of assumed it would be between Charli and Grimes here~~. It‚Äôs a charming very KKB-core song that feels like the offspring of Trampoline and Lipslap. The post-chorus cheap-keyboard-horn section dates it a bit, but I don‚Äôt care. This makes me want it to be summer and to be in the car with my friends driving to the beach.

**vayyiqra** (9): A fun and upbeat song, not deep or anything but I do like it. One of the best KKB loosies.

**nick1372** (10): I first got into this song in June 2020. When it seemed like we were about to enter an actual forever summer holiday that was apocalyptically horrifying. Somehow the unbridled joy of this song made it extremely foreboding to listen to but I can't help but love it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): global warming :D

**reput4tionera** (10): a staple on my summer playlists to the chagrin of everyone around me

**plastichaxan** (9): Walking a fine line between fun and children‚Äôs music I see

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): This is amazing! This should've been on the main album instead of just being regulated to a Japanese bonus track.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): maybe if sarah sounded like a vocaloid on all of their songs id like kkb more

**vayyiqra** (10): As a big sci-fi enjoyer, these kind of goofy-but-charming lyrics appeal to the dork in the me. Dorian is also an underrated artist (Flamboyant is good!) whose voice I like the sound of, and the anthemic chorus (listen to those keyboards!) tickles my brain cells just the right away. Mykki's verse is the perfect mix of silly and fun and won me over right away with the shoutout to Ghost in the Shell, the thudding electronic drums and Daft Punk-esque vocoder. Another nice touch is one of my favourite moments in the song, when the beat cuts out and Charli's vocals stutter a bit before the last chorus. One of the best tracks on the album for sure.

**seanderlust** (9.6): We start off the top ten by saying goodbye to a BANGER. I actually hadn‚Äôt heard of Dorian Electra until the hyperpop rate of a couple years ago and have since been obsessed with them - through good songs and‚Ä¶[post-good songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxw_hynAees). This song bangs though - the synths are so fun on the chorus, and all three artists deliver. Yes I‚Äôm including Mykki in that list - stream Stay Close To Music for clear skin and pink diamond bezels. :noitstrue:

CyberpopRate: ###**Runs On The Latest Cutting-Edge Tech**

**camerinian** (11): literally just a perfect hyperpop track, back before we even knew what the fuck that meant. The production is buffed to a mirror shine, right to the point of putting strain on it in all the right places. The hook is mammoth and futuristic and just off-kilter enough to ensure it never leaves your head, and Dorian and Mykki both deliver uncanny vocal performances that compliment Charli perfectly. Also shoutout to Mykki for delivering the one rap verse on this album that doesn't suck and actually understands the assignment. I adore this song and honestly feel it gets overlooked both on this album and in Charli's discography as one of her crown jewels.

**LesApfels** (11): This song randomly inspired me to make my first (and only) AMV using Ghost in the Shell (1995) clips. Now that's impact!

**amr** (10): mykki blanco probably has the best moment on this entire project mykki blanco egot mykki blanco nobel peace prize

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the single greatest song ever made

**BaconShoes** (10): GO FUCK YOUR PROTOTYPE

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the love robot they give to yassified incels.

**celladonn** (10): i lose my mind at mykki's verse every time

**DaHumanTorch** (10): mykki blanco's verse is an album highlight fuck the gossip

**fadedblue09** (10): this is Silver Cross' older and more upbeat sister

**homestarguy** (10): Austin Powers voice YEAH BABY, YEAHHH!!!

**Keno478** (10): This chorus is pure bliss and Mykki turns me out

**nick1372** (10): I'm just constantly saying "do you want a femme bot or do you want a hoe bot?" to myself in my brain all the time now

**oscarbrierley1** (10): i feel like we don't talk about how much of a bop this song is enough.

**pig-serpent** (10): Dorian really said "Hey, that femmebot track I was on was great, I should make it again" and dropped Guyliner.

**plastichaxan** (10): Yass fit all those robot puns you‚Äôre so sexy

**runaway3212** (10): Dorian has like the coolest voice ever

**sa5m\_i\_am** (10): Perfection. It was hard to choose between this and Tears for my 11.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): C'est pop perfection! Non, c'est vrai!!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): this song changed my life (i hadn't heard it before I listened to it and then afterwards I had)

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): oh this one. i got it this time. also wtf how have I never noticed the Ghost in the Shell lyric before?? shameless anime rate plug give inner universe your 11s

**Uberpigeon** (10): A song that asks questions. Do I want a femmebot or do I want a ho-bot? Much to think about.

**imbaby122** (9.7): mykki blanco verse haters are tastless!

**ulikejazz** (9.6): This feels like an outtake from Flamboyant in the very best way. I'd like to petition for a version excluding the Mykki Blanco verse tho

**impla77** (9.3): love the random sci fi references in the third verse

**1998tweety** (9): it was camp

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): This song‚Äôs score really changes for me based on my mood. My conclusion for now is that the instrumental slaps but the features (especially Mykki) drag it down kinda, though the song doesn‚Äôt quite work without them.

**bogo** (9): yeah i could pretty much say the same thing about this song as well it's also very yassifying

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song is hilarious because charli‚Äôs hook so chaste when you compared it to dorian & mykki singing like DO YOU NEED A CUMBOT

**jasannn** (9): the break free MV would fit this song perfectly

**Low\_Stable7628** (9): You'll never be Fembot by Robyn!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Such a slapper

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): why does dorian sound weirdly like marina on this song

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): mykki absolutely ate here

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): reclaiming the matrix for the girls

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): I've got some news for you.... Femmebots have feelings too

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): this is the first song where I‚Äôve been ‚Äúyeah, this is good‚Äù. I can‚Äôt really explain why, it just feels like it‚Äôs more complimentary of Charli‚Äôs strengths than the earlier tracks.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): the rare Charli track that can do without any features tbh

**frogaranaman** (8): -2 points but for Dorian Electra‚Äôs feature on this, Mykki Blanco slayed üôè

**reput4tionera** (8): mykki‚Äôs verse is the best part of this song

**ricki** (8): is this the inspiration for the no one dies from love music video

**welcome2thejam** (8): One "Charlie Bit My Finger" reference too many

**jman457** (7.2): fun, we should rate more Mykki Blanco

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I'm still not a big fan of the chorus

**shipperondeck** (7): really wish i liked the rap verse more bc usually i do like them in charli's songs

**Stryxen** (7): i get why mykki hated doing this song her verse kinda sucks in retrospect lmao

**darjeelingdotcom** (8): this song title reminded me of that Robyn song, ‚ÄúFembot‚Äù. In my high school French class, our teacher made us watch this movie ‚ÄúBabette‚Äôs Feast‚Äù where a French nanny moves to Sweden to work for a family there. My teacher did not tell us that the movie was mainly in Swedish. So, I was VERY confused what kind of French they were speaking. Were they from Brittany??? Anyway, I kept hearing them saying ‚Äútack‚Äù, and I remembered that was the Swedish word for thank you. Very bizarre moment. Anyway, then years later I got into Robyn‚Äôs ‚ÄúBody Talk‚Äù, including the song ‚ÄúFembot‚Äù. One of the lines I misheard as ‚ÄúOnce you go t√•k you ain‚Äôt never going back‚Äù (in my head I turned this word into this, maybe to Swede-ify it). As I listened to this song for years, I misremembered the word t√•k and thought it was Swedish for ‚ÄúSwedish‚Äù. So that Robyn was saying, ‚ÄúOnce you go Swedish you ain‚Äôt never going back‚Äù which kind of makes sense with the original phrase they‚Äôre referencing. Anyway, at my big age I literally just had a Swedish indiehead tell me that t√•k is made up, and the Swedish work for Swedish is Svenska. I‚Äôve been living an ignorant goofy lie for a decade. Anyway, this song is alright

**vayyiqra** (10): The perfect ending to the album, this song did well and is well-liked by fans. It sounds as carefree as the lyrics suggest, with the much-quoted "dream girl" line being Grimes' rejection of that image of her (remember this album came out 6 years ago when the perception of her was very different to say the least). A very upbeat and catchy pop song, it never fails to get me in a good mood.

**seanderlust** (9.2): Aside from misheard lyrics (‚Äúbig bee‚Äù, ‚Äúold man take a shit‚Äù, etc), I am very happy to see this in the top ten! For most of the rate this was hovering in the 8-13 placement range and for good reason - the production feels like a compilation of everything that makes AA such a great album  with a Grimes vocal performance that smashes that mf serotonin button. This serves as an excellent album closer, as it feels like a culmination of the Art Angels ideas presented as well as a fantastic standalone track.

CyberpopRate: ###**Butterfly by LOONA**

**Stryxen** (11): perfect declaration and summary of this album as a whole. The dreamy atmosphere makes it sound like whatever song just came on the radio while you‚Äôre driving or sitting at the window at night and mesmerised by whatever lights are going past and feeling like this moment of absolutely nothing is the most important moment of your life. If you‚Äôre looking for a dream girl / I‚Äôll never be your dream girl. genius choice for a closer and one of my all time fav songs

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): HIGHER THAN AN AEROPLANE!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): i feel like if artangels is a butterfly then miss a is a moth and i think thats sick

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is a slay but don‚Äôt let it distract you from the fact that the Monarch Butterly entered the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Endangered this summer.

**cocosairdep** (10): such a great closer

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended the manic pixie dream girl industrial complex

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): slayyyy

**imbaby122** (10): funny that u mention butterflies flying in the air grimes bc actually listening to this song morphed me into a butterfly and gave me the ability to fly. like actually if u saw me rn i‚Äôm typing this as a flying butterfly.

**moonagenightmares** (10): serotonin injection directly into my bloodstream

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): top 3 on the album when you think about it‚Ä¶the production is just too good

**oscarbrierley1** (10): hate the intro, but the rest of it is such a dance pop slay

**RandomHypnotica** (10): FANTASTIC closer, stunning, gorgeous, divine

**throwaway-7650** (10): not this song crashing her computer, grimes = ajayII confirmed?

**plastichaxan** (9.8): This song has grown on me quite a bit. Backstory I am a drag queen and the drag family I‚Äôm part of is called Haus of Animalz, each one of us chooses an animal we love/identify our drag persona with and I chose the butterfly and when I was in drag for the first time my drag mother introduced me as her drag daughter with this song so it holds a very special place in my heart.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): big bees, she gets me

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): The BASS SYNTH doing things to my brain

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): the transition into this? slay

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): untold blessings upon that flute sample and the serotonin it has wrought to me over the years

**BaconShoes** (9): a lil euphoric finish to the album

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I just don't love this song more cause it's not at the same level as the other tracks of the album, and it's the FUCKING closer

**jman457** (9): This is what y‚Äôall were saying what that Porter Robinson album sounded like

**ricki** (9): im on a loona boycott so this will have to replace their butterfly

**seasater** (9): most parts of this i really love. first listen i remember i didnt really care for it though so i know the other albums ive rated will be biased down a bit. the "ill never be your dream girl" lyric in this kinda annoys me it feels too preachy and obvious to be from grimes and its the thing ppl always quote. oh well

**impla77** (8.7): the chorus is just so full and uplifting

**shipperondeck** (8.7): cool one to end on

**1998tweety** (8.5): she bops a bit

**homestarguy** (8.5): Good, but of course you know Crazy Town outsold

**bogo** (8): it's a minor thing but in the second verse of the song i can't help but hear "take his shit" as "take a shit" and it kinda sends. i'm mentioning this because while i do like this track a lot i have virtually nothing else to say about it

**fadedblue09** (8): glad she bothered closing this album with a good song

**frogaranaman** (8): mariposa

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love the lyrics on this

**reput4tionera** (8): a medium slay

**Uberpigeon** (8): i hear the opening as "big bees butt clubs"

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (7.8): she can really get a exceptional amount of ooomph out of that wail. enough that pretty much any track is gonna be worth a bopping of the head up and down to.

**steelstepladder** (7.5): is there a different version with better production? I could have sworn this sounded better

**TiltControls** (7.5): the opening notes make it seem like Bonito Generation started a song early

**PandaMomentum** (7): wait there's one more track? Ok

**nt96** (10): I'm sorry but she popped off, three-time rate winner Janelle Monae was the cherry on top. The bourgeoisie made points.

**seanderlust** (10): WHY YOU LOOKIN AT ME! WHY YOU LOOKIN AT ME AGAIN!!!! This EATS. Grimes‚Äô famous collaboration with a PH moderator who also idk [does](https://open.spotify.com/album/3bnHtSmmsgJiG82hGCmsq9?si=Hw9Y4xLGRJaBUP9DsrCwWQ) [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Janelle_Mon%C3%A1e) [other](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-moonlight-janelle-monae-20161018-snap-story.html) [stuff](http://noirehistoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hidden-Figures-Feature-Image.jpg) [on](https://www.bet.com/article/vgwf7b/janelle-monae-joins-artists-and-activists-for-protest-anthem) [the](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/04/671242319/the-50-best-albums-of-2018-page-5) [side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJCRFKmUic4) [I guess](https://hbr.org/2020/09/lifes-work-an-interview-with-janelle-monae)? This is one of the highlights of the album for both myself and pretty much universally which is why it was Day 3 for the entire rate, and top 10 for most of it. The bass is undeniable and pulse-pounding and the attitude given is :velmaserve:. I did think this was a frontrunner but it falls a little short of the crown at number 8.

**vayyiqra** (10): The energy on this one and the incredible production (listen to that bass! listen to it!) is undeniable and the rhythm goes extremely hard. The lyrics are intriguing (what the hell does "feelin' my beat like a sniper girl" mean? Nobody knows but it sounds cool) with their use of bizarre imagery; the concept being "too scary to be objectified". Grimes has always had a lot of gripes about sexism in the music industry, and this song comes from that frustration, I think. Janelle's part is of course great too, with her vocals sounding distant and echoing a bit which goes along with the surreal vibe of the song (and video). Ending it with a violin solo was also a great touch.

CyberpopRate: ###**Venus Fly Traps**

**asdf1698** (11): realiti and kill v maim are perfect but I actually love this song so much- the drums the creativity the message. And I love Janelle Monae

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (11): saintly 11 dispatched to the one banger that didn't stop banging as I drove through that evil fucking village. art angels straight up insists you have a car stereo system or subwoofers or literally anything to pick up on the details in the production. Fortunately I had the former when I first heard this. I kept wondering throughout the first listen "is it gonna get any deeper than this?" because usually Grimes would seem to connect a song to her genius production and it not quite hit the brass ring, or the song would just not be there for me and we'd meander. But with Janelle Monae in tow and the most limb-melting EDM-inflicted bass 2k15 could provide, we hit the sublime skeleton key for why Art Angels theoretically works for me and entrances me in its best moments. Venus Fly's absolute manic structure between silenced ump45 pre-choruses and massive AC-130 level bass that straight up quiver and edges over until it basically becomes the song. It loses itself in the sheer omnipotence of that. Which for a humongous kiss-off song you can sing along to, lands perf. it weaponized an obsession over textures, voice, and gendered assumptions into THIS bash! it's fleet, sleek, and hyp-fucking-notic to an uncomfortably sublime degree. that's what i was waiting for; "Everything is posed, every Sign selected with a fastidiousness...pop as pure texture..." even down to the fucking violins that appeared to have been learned just for this (supposedly); and I do really like the strings on this one, as the kind of variant of this texture I wanted more on the album. The depths don't need to be pined for, because my fingers are already running along the sound waves. THE triumph of the album, and a cut that literally forced charli and kkb out of the running for an extra point. wow grimes, you clever mlg galaxy brain popster

**darjeelingdotcom** (11): apocalypse jam

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): always gets me hyped, the beat LITERALLY slaps, Janelle and Grimes have so much chemistry as collaborators

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Janelle Monae could slap me across the face and I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúyes please more mommy‚Äù tbqh

**amr** (10): "feeling my beat like a sniper girl" should've singlehandedly inducted janelle into the songwriters' hall of fame like I don't think U understand the grip that lyric has had on me for the past 7 years

**BaconShoes** (10): the bass omg this song absolutely eats. This song came on at the club once and i danced so hard that I ripped my leopard print pants

**cremeebrulee** (10): i hate being percieved too besties

**CrimsonROSET** (10): janelle monae keeps the streak of only making one bad song (make the bus)

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): there‚Äôs an interpretation I‚Äôve seen about this song that explains the song as one about how gender conformity empowers creeps preying on what they believe to be people with feminine traits (read: submissive and powerless), and the singer takes the imagery of ‚Äúsoft girlishness‚Äù to take those and use it as a weapon to terrify and lose unwanted attention. I feel like this is an interpretation I‚Äôve applied to so many songs but it is apparently a very common theme for a lot of songs.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): joint slay

**frogaranaman** (10): I would like to thank Janelle Mon√°e for being Janelle Mon√°e

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this beat hits so hard that I can't even pay attention to whatever they're mumbling

**Stryxen** (8): janelle is parent but idk this one has just never been a fav. BUT Oh why u looking at me? Is a classic grimes hook

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Stop looking at them! Leave them alone!

**vayyiqra** (10): Another song that fills me with warm fuzzies, with its chorus being a case where Charli's "more repetitive = more better" approach works. The pitched-up vocals and "beautiful" sample add another nice touch. Another "elephant in the room" moment, but you all really hate that Jay Park verse that much, huh? I don't get it. It's so in one ear and out the other for me, barely notice it's even there. It's so inoffensive to me. Also shoutout to Kim for saying "maraschino" right.

**nt96** (9.5): docking half a point for Jay. Everything else bops. It's translucent, sugary pop (near) perfection.

**cocosairdep** (10): jay park‚Äôs verse was my misandrist awakening

**nootnoot781** (10): rating the version without jay park so i can give this album a 10.000 average. <3

**pig-serpent** (10): TBH I normally listen to the mashup with Better Off Alone and the most impressive part of that mashup is the fact that they made Jay Park's verse sound good.

**plastichaxan** (10): I knew stockholm syndrome was real when the Jay Park verse didn‚Äôt sound bad anymore and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs andale‚Äù started sounding like something normal to sing along to

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the day this came out I downloaded an edit without jay park's verse and 165 plays later I haven't looked back

**thedoctordances1940** (10): ignore the part in my delicious comment where I slander Jay Park this songs is still fantastic

**DirtyRat583** (9.6): this song was my top song on wrapped last year bc the stream cutoff is before jay parks verse üò≠

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Would be a 10 without the man

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the non rap version would be my eleven (the song going viral would've been a great opportunity to put that version on streaming ms xcx). as it is the rap messes up the flow of the song abit.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): removing one point for the Jay Park verse.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Same predicament as Femmebot where IDK the real score for this; conclusion for now is that the instrumental is fine and Charli and Kim slay, but‚Ä¶ Jay really dropped the ball for this, seriously. Omit him or put someone else in his place and this song is several notches better. Unfortunate.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why was Jay Park‚Äôs verse a jump scare

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): finally some good fucking food. even though jay park did the equivalent of pissing into the fryer

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the "no Jay Park" edits on YouTube are hilarious because they work so well.

**shipperondeck** (7.8): unlock the swag (the swag is cultural appropriation)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): lock it lock it lock it unlock it unlock it lock it lock it lock it lock it lock it ew jay park lock it lock it lock it lock it lock it unlock it lock it lock it lock it lock it lock it lock it

**Uberpigeon** (7): thank u jay park for coming in and reminding us to not take the good parts of this song for granted because it could be over at any moment x

**martian\_pet** (6): could've been a seven and a half but I had to take the jay park tax (one point) and the kim petras tax (half a point)

**flava** (5): bubblegum goodness until the chorus happens and kim petras starts singing and Jay Park‚Äôs verse was particularly awkward

**fadedblue09** (4.5): https://twitter.com/cakketv/status/1597943068640301056?t=-PBFWMq-hhNZyaX07uObHA&s=19

**Stryxen** (3): never liked this and annoyed that this is probably her front runner. nowhere near the quality of the majority of the rest of the rate. Oh my god jay parks verse just came on EW why did they release it with that on

**TiltControls** (3): That Jay Park section isn't terrible but does not fit the song in the slightest

**moonagenightmares** (2.5): THE JAY PARK JUMPSCARE?

###**Raters who have swag**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I know the Jay Park verse is not good and very out of place I‚Äôm simply ignoring that tbh because I don‚Äôt want to give this less than a 10.

**bogo** (10): the jay verse is great y'all are just lame

**celladonn** (10): perfect song. i love jay park's awful verse

**MassiveThief** (10): Jay Park's verse is great. I'll say it.

**runaway3212** (10): jay park's verse is not that bad

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): Took me like 5 listens of this mixtape before I was able to discern between Charli and Kim's vocals, was too lazy to look it up. I personally don't get the complaints about Jay Park's verse, but only because I'm able to completely black it out, time just kinda skips forward [XX] seconds in my world. It's fun, you all should try it.

**imbaby122** (9.5): i too believe that jay park messes with the pop perfection of this song but ‚Äúunlock the swag‚Äù is a top 10 line in a charli song

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): one of the few that doesn't mind jay park's verse like, at all. this is pop perfection.

**apatel27** (9): Jay Parks verse is overhated

**Keno478** (9): Roxxxy Andrews walked so Jay Park could run

**nick1372** (6): While Charli's first verse is absolute pop perfection, the rest of this song is NOT as good as y'all make it out to be. Without the first minute, it's easily the most boring and safe song on this record. Jay Park's verse is overhated tho, the problem is mostly on Charli for fully removing the beat from behind him.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): this is cute but nice. The Jay Park feature is kinda cringe but unfortunately I‚Äôve listened to enough Jay Park that I‚Äôm desensitised.

**seanderlust** (10): [They tried so hard, and got so far,,,, but in the end,,,,,,,,,,,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtjvFoJymtQ).

KKB narrowly misses the top five as we say goodbye to Trampoline. This one hurts because it was one of my three 11 contenders. It‚Äôs fun and appropriately bouncy and a good anthem for dealing with the highs and lows of life. Plus that key change!! KKB truly nails every (or at least most) key changes they go for. Among the NGE and Charly Bliss (plsss leave DQ ALONE!!!) references, raters generally tended to agree but not enough to ever have it in first place, and about a quarter of the way into collecting all ballots, Trampoline was pretty solidly set in its placement.

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the first things I learned about KKB and their lore is that their fans would go to their concerts and mosh to this song. Having seen KKB live, I still don't quite get it, but I guess the song does literally tell the listener to jump. But aside from the energy on it, I kind of love how this song is one case where I think the "pure and wholesome" vibe of this album works best. It's literally a song about how jumping on a trampoline is fun, which it is.

CyberpopRate: ## Can Do Flips And Cool Tricks

**apatel27** (11): This is my life motto

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I came into this rate 100% sure this would be my eleven. I nearly strayed. Tears caught my eye. Artangels title track caught my breath. Know It Ain‚Äôt Right caught my COVID. I bent but I didn‚Äôt break, and my 11 is right where it always belonged.

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): there‚Äôs something about this song that just makes me want to get back up even on my worst days. That‚Äôs the KKB magic, I guess. Every early KKB song makes you feel like you have your own personal cheerleader who‚Äôs just trying to hype you up and make you perform basic self care, and I‚Äôm grateful for that one even if I have like zero thoughts on the music itself.

**frogaranaman** (11): great instruction song

**homestarguy** (11): Whenever I hear the opening synth sweep: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a\_VTvQLAfaE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_VTvQLAfaE)

**1998tweety** (10): the bop has arrived

**Awkward\_King** (10): honestly yeah

**BaconShoes** (10): jump, jump, trampoline!!!

**cremeebrulee** (10): you know i‚Äôm usually a key change anti‚Ä¶. but this one is pretty well executed and makes sense in context!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I GET KNOCKED DOWN! BUT I GET UP AGAIN!

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): when you hear this in the club where the airplane flies over yr head you will go "awooga". sarah get OFF the trampoline that is not a good object (feels like time n place foreshadow idk). i once came home to a trampoline. sorta miss it but I realize it had to stop bouncing at some point

**DaHumanTorch** (10): she put the sarah in sarah tonin

**fadedblue09** (10): That chorus is a stunner, my favorite on the album

**hunnybee12** (10): FIRST U FALL DOWN ‚Ä¶.

**imbaby122** (10): are u ever having a bad day and then FIRST. YOU. FALL. DOWN. THEN YOU JUMP BACK UP AGAIN and then ur ok?!?!?!?

**jasannn** (10): Tinashe is shaking

**Keno478** (10): Absolute bop full of unhinged joy.

**LilacDaffodils** (10): this was the first Kero Kero Bonito song I ever heard. I found it on YouTube one night when I couldn‚Äôt sleep. It was joyful and hopeful and bouncy and I really needed that at the time. It‚Äôs been a long time since 2016 but I still listen to this song often.

**Low\_Stable7628** (10): Perfume's crown slipped a little here...

**musical\_pyn** (10): bouncebouncebouncebouncebounce

**pig-serpent** (10): ÈÅ•„ÅãÊú™Êù• „ÇÅ„Åñ„Åô„Åü„ÇÅ„ÅÆÁæΩÊ†π„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã„Åì„Å® ÊÆãÈÖ∑„Å™Â§©‰Ωø„ÅÆ„ÉÜ„Éº„Çº Á™ìËæ∫„Åã„Çâ„ÇÑ„Åå„Å¶È£õ„Å≥Á´ã„Å§ „Åª„Å®„Å∞„Åó„ÇãÁÜ±„ÅÑ„Éë„Éà„Çπ„Åß ÊÄù„ÅÑÂá∫„ÇíË£èÂàá„Çã„Å™„Çâ „Åì„ÅÆÂÆáÂÆô„ÇíÊä±„ÅÑ„Å¶Ëºù„Åè Â∞ëÂπ¥„Çà Á•ûË©±„Å´„Å™„Çå

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Genuinely catchy and probably my favourite KKB song ever. Was so temped to 11 this.

**reput4tionera** (10): i wanted a trampoline so bad when i was little but my parents said no

**runaway3212** (10): an iconic moment in time

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Moshing in my room alone rn

**static\_int\_husp** (10): on god the only mosh pit I've ever been to was during this song at a KKB show

**Stryxen** (10): played this for my parents once and they said something like oh this is REAL music not that shit on the radio about drugs and swearing and twerking. their youtube comments serve

**thedoctordances1940** (10): songs like this really make me wish I did like KKB more, but maybe they should just be making more songs like this :shrug:

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I almost fell from the stairs yesterday but Kero Kero Bonito saved my life by reminding me to keep an eye on gravity. Thank You KKB! (based on a true story)

**throwaway-7650** (10): need tinashe to plagiarize this so DIA can then plagiarize her

**AzettImpa** (9.5): it‚Äôs the best one for sure.

**cocosairdep** (9.5): ok this slaps

**camerinian** (9): weird to think this is the only track on the album with a key change. Just aesthetically you'd think they'd have shitloads on here

**darjeelingdotcom** (9): [https://images.app.goo.gl/yADeZiDFi6awETzs9](https://images.app.goo.gl/yADeZiDFi6awETzs9)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): story time: i had a trampoline obsession when i was 6. the mall recently opened near my house had a playground, which included a trampoline and i literally BEGGED my mom to go there every weekend. so one weekend, while i was there there was this one boy that were like? older than me, like 7 or 8 years old or so. after like a while of just jumping around we started having a competition to see who can jump the highest and in his overexcitement he full on KICKED my face. like full on karate kick and all that jazz. it took me like 3 months to heal from the broken nose i got. anyways this is a good song <3

**impla77** (9): unfortunately I am quite bad at trampolining but I appreciate the tips

**nick1372** (9): check out the live rock version it's incredible

**PandaMomentum** (9): this is what we came for

**Uberpigeon** (9): this is the most overrated kkb song ever but its very fun live so i'll give them that. it even got the confused 11am festival crowd to actually move at their tragically poorly received set i was at.

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE

**amr** (8): another song that sounds like smt very familiar to me (MIRACLE by MEG) but it has enough (a lot honestly) personality of its own that I still enjoy it. also sarah's voice doesn't bother me in the slighest here which is surprising but welcome lol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is just a cruel angel‚Äôs thesis‚Ä¶anime rate promo???

**asdf1698** (7.6): a cute bop I inflated the rating because I enjoyed this song the most on this album. The one note cheeriness really worked for this song

**bigbigbee** (7.5): oh yeah? anyone? What about worms?

**jman457** (7.5): This is fun

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7.5): one of the more interesting tracks

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Probably one of the best choruses on the record.

**seasater** (7): bit of a bop innit. not groundbreaking but cute and fun

## We‚Äôre all trying to forget that line from the Bubblegrunge rate

**seanderlust** (8.458): My poor meow meow‚Ä¶my baby my little baby who hurt so much but treats people with nothing but kindness forgive me for not being able to do more..i tried my best i really did..This album is good!!! In my personal ranking of KKB‚Äôs albums, it‚Äôs Civilisation > TnP = Bonito Generation > Intro Bonito. This album is fun and charming and upbeat, an album to play when you just need to turn your brain off a bit and give yourself a goofy grin. It‚Äôs light-hearted fun that dips its toe in the waters of serious topics, but KKB‚Äôs spirit of protagonist-esque optimism shines through. Their sophomore album helped put them on the map, and for good reason. I‚Äôm sorry to see this album be the first to go out.

**vayyiqra** (9.583): An album which is very well-liked outside of Popheads but ended up being controversial within it, the reactions to this one were a bit surprising. Given its aggressive cheerfulness I see why some of you thought this album was annoying and childish, and it doesn't help we've been doing a KKB discography speedrun lately, which might have left some of you burnt out on them and tired of what I've been calling "KKB evangelism". They're a cult band whose fans tend to be very heavily into them, and very much an "internet music nerd" thing. While it seems like *Time'n'Place* is the consensus when it comes to their best album, this is definitely the one I enjoy most and found very easy to rate. To me this album is just goofy fun, but also with an interesting undercurrent of some more serious lyrical themes. It's definitely an album meant for millennials which you can take as you will. I feel it's aged well though and is a very well-made album full of catchy hooks. Unfortunately not everyone agreed, so maybe it's something you had to get into years ago and not now. It struggled a bit in the rate, but at least we mostly agreed *some* of the songs on it are good. But this band is the one artist in the rate who I believe was never once in the lead and did not ever have a serious chance of winning. Maybe they'll win when we rate *Intro Bonito* next cycle ... lol jk.

CyberpopRate: ---

**steelstepladder** (10.000): After relistening to this album for the first time in a while this is still one of my favorite albums of the 2010‚Äôs. Yes it‚Äôs cheesy and corny but the corn works so well here! There is no cynicism behind Bonito Generation which (while probably not good for all you Gen Z‚Äôs strung out on irony all the time) makes it one of the most sincere and brightest albums of my lifetime. Every song is just a sweet little vignette about a simple pleasure that we often take for granted every day. A sunny sense of optimism that turns what would otherwise be a set of fun but disconnected pop songs, into an experience greater than the sum of its parts. It‚Äôs a dedication to this sincerity that makes songs about jumping on a trampoline and taking a selfie feel like the most important things in the world, because this is one of the few albums that actually understands that they are. Perfect album.

**Stryxen** (10.000): this is one of my top 5 albums of all time. Adore it. Was the soundtrack of my 2020-2021 and helped me really process the absurdity of‚Ä¶ That. every song here is so special and i even have an emotional attachment to the interlude

**RandomHypnotica** (9.825): I never really appreciated this album for how fantastic it is until now, they really took the sound from their debut and refined and polished it to a perfect shine. I'm not surprised they moved away from this sound because... how can you make it better than this?

**throwaway-7650** (9.708): still lamenting the fact that this isn't being rated against poppy.computer (and that I can't claim intro bonito is better than this anymore I mean what I never said that who would ever say that idk what you're talking about anyway stream intro bonito it deserves a rate eventually)

**sarcasticsobs** (9.550): Watch Bonito Generation get a higher average than Pop 2 for me, because even though the latter is (arguably) more "important" or more of a "landmark" (it is to me, at least) and I return to it much more, KKB has a very specific goal and they just smashed numerous multiple-RBI-inducing, hard line drives. Pop 2 has a round-tripper, a bomb, a dinger, and a moon shot. But KKB has the Ichiro Suzuki-like ability to consistently get on base with a bonkers batting average. I don't even like baseball.

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.200): still just found an earnest resonation when alexalone and lomelda made it their walk on music for their leg of the tour in January 2022. very hard album for me to rate due to being somewhat tied to a time and place and people I can't return to. anyways...its not the "paid in full" or "viva la woman" of whatever genre it wants to claim to. these albums just sprung into my head as comparisons points of capturing the same joy of capturing and claiming your own noise; what does it mean to move the crowd AND know your chicken? On bonito generation (and only that album to date), KKB display that. It's perhaps too blinding at times, but also playful in a way they'd only capture once. still growing even more on me as tnp settles. insane amount of perfect pop exists on this that many people cannot give a fair shake for reasons that are beyond me. i wanted to come and hate this album 3 years after buying the tape. im coming away deeply moved?

**plastichaxan** (9.125): There‚Äôs just a joy I feel with this album I can‚Äôt really describe, it‚Äôs kinda funny that this is my least favorite in the rate and yet has this average but like wow look at the material, also whoever tanks this hates fun even if they are my besties :(((((

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.000): a big moment for weebs everywhere who didn't know Japanese people also made music. stream do do pi do by Capsule

**TiltControls** (8.875): KKB has gotten a bit more serious with their songs and some people really like that! However, this goofyness will be their peak for me. I didn't hate TnP, but after coming off with so much life on this album it was hard to fully enjoy it. I just want another album as needlessly bright and cheery as this one from them.

**fairytalehigh** (8.758): i'm nervous KKB is going to get completely shafted in this rate. that would be a shame, as this is one of the most deceptively brilliant (and dark) pop albums of the past 10 years.

**nick1372** (8.667): I say this completely unironically: this album is one of the most incredible examples in modern times of the power and potential of pure pop music. The way it incorporates small details of the minutae of life as a young person to create this portrait of the struggles and euphorias of growing up is incredibly masterful. And of course, the incorporation of video game-style musical elements is such a genius way to soundtrack this period of life, especially for the young millenial/older gen z audience that KKB targets.

**bogo** (8.658): it's fun

**welcome2thejam** (8.583): Think I might slightly prefer TnP & Civilization, but this does some of the best songs in their stellar catalogue. Strong album, of course I was gonna like this, KKB are one of my faves

**musical\_pyn** (8.542): this was my first time listening to kkb and I absolutely love this sound so much, it's such a sweet album in both tone and material and manages to be really happy without being clich√© or sacchrine.

CyberpopRate: **imbaby122** (8.442): incessant positivity can sound a bit like an attack on my ears, but somehow kero kero bonito manage to tackle themes like mental health, education, and meandering working class life with a nuanced positivity that doesn‚Äôt make me want to punch them in the face. as a college student, it can be hard to accept that my life is kinda okay despite all the work that drives me insane, but when kkb sings it, i just get it. musically, i appreciate all of the influences, from synthpop/city pop, to house music, to video game soundtracks, and of course, to the organized chaos of hyperpop (it feels illegal to use this word). i will say that sometimes the kkb sound can be a little sparse to my ears, but regardless, i appreciate their outlook on music, and on life in general, that is especially prevalent in bonito generation.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.375): a very cute and clever concept album, I fear I may be underrating it because of lack of familiarity, but I appreciate the vision

**pig-serpent** (7.842): I first saw this album on 4chan's "people who drink plastic water bottles core" list and it was actually a pretty cool selection. KKB are aiming to be the cutseyest band in existence, and they pass with flying colors. I do think that their biggest strength can also be their biggest drawback at times though.

**ricki** (7.775): sorry for being mean to you kero kero bonito, i really like your music, i just dont like your fans

**frogaranaman** (7.750): a practice in enjoying the mundane

**Keno478** (7.667): There is something about this album that scratches my brain in a way no other album can. I think it‚Äôs something about the way it sounds like a kids show sing along but actually sounds good? This album‚Äôs earnest nature somehow prevents it from being cringe and yet it still sounds refreshingly childlike? I love it.

**jman457** (7.425): I liked this better than the KKB we rated a couple months ago, but less than the one we rated in May

**DirtyRat583** (7.417): kkb knew kidz bop would never cover them so they did it themselves

**shipperondeck** (7.375): i was expecting a jumpscare the whole time but really this is just happy music ig

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.167): from listening to all three KKB albums (I have no idea if Civ or Intro Bonito count), I have come to the conclusion that KKB‚Äôs albums are incredibly inconsistent. There‚Äôs some songs that are literal sunshine, a cheery love story with life, and then there‚Äôs some that make me sigh in frustration because they‚Äôre poorly thought out and sound like Cocomelon. I do think KKB have the ability to make an album that‚Äôs 100% great the whole time, but it‚Äôs not this.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.083): WOW! This album is so light-hearted and bubbly and genuinely fun. Probably a little too sticky-and-sweet for some listeners but whatever. If you're a parent and have kids, play this album around them. I'm sure they'll love it.

=====

CyberpopRate: **cocosairdep** (6.917): This was my first exposure to them, and I thought the album was ok. The songs are fun and catchy, but they do tend to blend together a bit. Also, I don‚Äôt usually care about lyrics that much, but I‚Äôm not a fan of the teletubbies style lyricism. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a downright impediment to my enjoyment of the songs, but after a while it does get kind of jarring.

**Roxieloxie** (6.867): kkb has been making the same song for the past 3 albums them im begging you all please find another artist

**Low\_Stable7628** (6.833): 7

**jasannn** (6.708): I see the transition into time n place but this album leans a bit too saccharine for my taste. I‚Äôm glad they leaned more into indie in their future albums.

**Awkward\_King** (6.708): WE WILL BE. WELL. RESTED. WHEN THE EXTENSION COMES.

**Sam Ray** (6.667): 6

**MassiveThief** (6.625): It's good, but does get kinda old imo. Hard to listen to so many sweet wholesome songs in a row.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.583): This album was too happy for me personally lol. I don‚Äôt really like City Pop inspired bouncy music like this so I knew I would be in for a challenge here. I probably won‚Äôt listen to it again.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.517): this album feels so meta

**cremeebrulee** (6.300): we rated the best kkb project in may and it‚Äôs been ciara.gif since then

**lipe18090** (6.000): 6

**thedoctordances1940** (5.817): I have tried on quite a few occasions to get into KKB but never really did, I've generally found them more annoying than endearing, and this year of rating has really settled for me that I just don't really like them all that much (with the exception of civ ii). Every step back to an older album I've just enjoyed them less and less and hopefully this is the end of that journey.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.708): A sort of frustrating record that I really wanted to like‚Äîand it just seems like the instrumentation is just a bit too tacky with its chiptune-esque direction just not quite getting there. Some good songs yeah, but a good number of just pretty underwhelming or annoying tracks that add up to a largely throwaway album‚Äîat least in my books. Funnily enough Sarah just came out with a really good EP on her own, so I have to wonder if it‚Äôs just the instrumentation from the other KKB members not supporting her unique vocals well enough (an issue that prevailed on Time‚Äôn‚ÄôPlace). All in all: you could really do a LOT better for a pop record in 2016 than Bonito Generation, frankly.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.583): I really don't get their appeal. I have the impression their target audience was kids in the making of the album. I mean, did you listen to the lyrics besides the nice beats???

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.500): yeah i get thats its supposed to be ‚Äúquirky‚Äù and ‚Äúfun‚Äù, but theres plenty of music out there thats both of those things while also managing to be, you know, good music

**squeezylemon** (5.342): Totally new to KKB and‚Ä¶well! They‚Äôre not for me. I can recognize and respect what they‚Äôre doing but Christ this was a slog to get through.

**Hulnia** (5.167): i feel so scammed lol i went in expecting a great album after only hearing lipslap and trampoline

**fadedblue09** (5.083): This marks the third time I listened to KKB against my will! And honestly I find this quite a slog (which is a shame, cuz I thought I was starting to appreciate them with Time N Place). The delivery of the lyrical themes here comes off as annoyingly childish compared to their later work, and the constant insertion of Japanese feels random. Some instrumentals were cute, I'll give them that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.750): this entire album sounds like the unofficial soundtrack for don't hug me i'm scared

**darjeelingdotcom** (4.708): I like silly music. It‚Äôs weird to me I don‚Äôt love KKB. There are some songs I really like, that get me into their bright, silly mood. Other times it really sours on me and I feel cold. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm literally sitting in the dashcon ballpit: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESNh8SbXkAEp5pw.jpg This album kind of makes me think of the time I was like 4, I had really tasty Trix-flavored yogurt in preschool. A few hours later during nap time I threw up. A lot of the production I think is clever and well-done. My biggest gripe is Sarah‚Äôs delivery. I like my fair share of some monotone, deadpan vocalists. I think they‚Äôre usually baritones or altos, and Sarah‚Äôs often brighter chipper tones gives me a cold, grating feeling inside. Like the music is fine, it‚Äôs cute, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs depth and a heady mix of irony and sincerity and KKB stan would love to explain to me but it just does not click. I‚Äôm cool with people liking this music, just know I can‚Äôt love all of it, some of it really gives me the ick.

**oscarbrierley1** (4.417): i presume this is supposed to be ironic or something. half of it sounds like music from toddler tv. i'm so sorry but i really do not like her voice and i think it adds to the childrens tv vibe. also this is completely irrelevant to the rate, but i find the album art so ugly. especially compared to the others in the rate that are all nice looking.

**flava** (3.917): I might've liked this more if sarah‚Äôs vocals weren‚Äôt giving off this quirky aesthetic that just subtracts any expressiveness her voice has and makes most of the album unbearably annoying. And this album forced endearing quirkiness that just screams ‚Äúthe friend who tries way too hard to make people like him‚Äù. And while there is a great need in this world for the positivity and support in this album. It could stand to sound a little less forced, and maybe it would be more compelling if there was like an edge, even a smooth one.

**moonagenightmares** (3.917): im struggling to take this seriously

**indie\_fan\_** (3.808): I tried, but I just really did not like this. The talking parts are just more grating than they are charming or entertaining and the production has that juvenile type of sound I'm really not down for. I liked a decent chunk of their other material from past rates, but this did not hit the mark for me

**seanderlust** (10): God I was rooting for this one so hard. I just love it so much! Thirst trap music video aside, it‚Äôs Pop!Charli at her best. Sparkling synths, a rolling trap-lite drumbeat and a cheeky Mario coin sound effect are all used extremely effectively. Also, I have never spaced out during conversations because I was thinking about a boy I liked but I *imagine* this would detail the process pretty well. Fun fact: for the longest time I thought Jack Antonoff in the MV was John Oliver.

**vayyiqra** (7): A cute song, good chorus, love the Mario coin sample, and neat concept for the video (despite me not knowing who most of the guys in it are lol). I'm not that big on most of Charli's "loosie" songs so I don't play them often or think about them a lot but this one's good.

**vayyiqra** (10): While I'm never going to get why so many fans are evangelistic about this and prefer the album's more, at the end of the day it's still my favourite Grimes song and one of my favourite songs ever, so a 10 is a 10. I've heard an argument that the less bright sound fits the depressing lyrics better, but I feel like that ironic contrast between the lyrics and sound of the song is a big selling point of it for me. I feel like the reason so many stans argue this version is better is just because they heard it first and got attached to it. I don't feel the same, but that's fine, even though this version feels a bit incomplete to me. I do love the music video, so it did give us that. I'm just tired of the discourse over which is better. (On that note, I'm very glad we didn't get a ton of comments about "Track 10" that brought up "Blame It On Your Love", which is a way different song and doesn't even make sense to compare to me. At least both versions of "Realiti" are recognizably the same song, lol.)

**cocosairdep** (10): the superior version ofc, though the other one fits the album better. would‚Äôve loved to hear this on visions though

**cremeebrulee** (10): the chokehold this had on me during early lockdown like fuck‚Ä¶.. welcome to reality indeed

**darjeelingdotcom** (10): @ if I heard this demo in 2015 I‚Äôd probably have vayy‚Äôs zealous love of synth pop too (affectionate)

**fairytalehigh** (10): would get my 11 were it eligible. the soft production, the trance synths, her reverby vocals, that stunning music video. an iridescent bridge between visions and art angels.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I actually prefer this version over the original. Oh, wait‚Ä¶ this is technically the original.

**Low\_Stable7628** (10): this song indoctrinated me... no further elaboration

**martareinon** (10): If I could I would give this one an eleven without a doubt

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It‚Äôs a demo version alright.

**Keno478** (8): I like this one way better

**pig-serpent** (8): I can obviously tell that the album version is more finished, but without the extra reverb the sparseness in this version actually adds a lot the feel and I think I like this one more.

**BaconShoes** (7.5): Doesn‚Äôt quite have the same punch from the production in the final version, but it‚Äôs still pretty good

**TiltControls** (7.5): the continued streak of canadaphobia coming from inside the house

**seanderlust** (10): We kick off the top 5 with a bang - or should i say a banger. The collaboration between [two gay](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2efKJp9eEp0) [icons](https://electronicdelusionstarlight.tumblr.com/post/180931286441/til-carly-rae-jepsen-and-naruto-uzumaki-better) starts the album out with top-tier A.G. production that IMO perfectly compliments the tone of the song and the sound of these two artists‚Äô respective voices. While not everyone agreed, this song did not spend much time outside of the top five - as may be expected in a PH rate. It‚Äôs Choli and Colly babie - what could go wrong.

**vayyiqra** (10): What a good intro to this album. Ambient metal-scraping sounds have got to be one of my favourite music aesthetics. What I love is when songs can capture a very specific vibe incredibly well, and this song nails the vibe of being in a vehicle (doesn't have to be a car, could be anything) at night, staring out the window, lost in your thoughts ... love that feeling. Of course Carly's hook is wonderful too; this whole song is just ear candy.

**nt96** (9): Its Charli baby! I love this opener and how it sets the tone with this bombastic breakbeat.

**lipe18090** (11): Simply a perfect song and maybe her best.

**MassiveThief** (11): Had to give it to Backseat. The sheer audacity of this song - the contrast of their singing, the glitchy icy production perfectly replicating being drunk in the backseat, and the sythns swirling at the end all come together to make a masterpiece.

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): I know that there is a lorde verse for this song sitting in Charli's spam folder

**pig-serpent** (10): One of the two pop 2 songs I immediately decided were amazing, I realized I had never heard anything quite like this before. An introspective swirl of glistening haze that's perfect for dancing by yourself.

**reput4tionera** (10): played this song for my friend who loves carly and doesn‚Äôt like charli and it did not go well

**runaway3212** (10): MOTHERS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): They did an excellent job at bringing the dreaminess of E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION into Charli‚Äôs glitchy electro world

**shipperondeck** (10): so who else unironically listens to this song and tears during a mental breakdown

**squeezylemon** (10): Pop masterpiece. The winding repetitions on ‚Äúall alone‚Äù get better every single fucking time. You knew a collab with these two would be legendary and it absolutely is.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): joint slay from the two queenliest queens

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Genuinely really underrated and such a fantastic opener

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Carly and Charli on the same song? I call cheats. Also it's really good

**throwaway-7650** (10): whoa charli and carly on the same song/in the same rate there's no way they would ever flop right like I can't imagine one of them would ever get shut out of day 3 right hahahahahaha

CyberpopRate: ## It Got So Many 10s It Needed This Other Section

**plastichaxan** (9.7): Not even getting the Carly collab Charli is winning a rate she‚Äôs doomed

**memezaharamole** (9.6): should be noted as the pop(2)pers of the album, as it prepares you for what is to come

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I do think this is a touch underwhelming for an anthem from 2 gay icons, but that sparkly ending is divine

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (9.5): "WIFE thinks she can tell her man, when to CHARLI!! WELL GUESS WHAT! i will CHARLI when I LIKE TO! and if that Pisses her off..DIVORCE HER ASS !!" - 9:21 PM ¬∑ Jul 19, 2017¬∑Twitter Web Client

**Keno478** (9): Proof we need a Carly XCX collar album.

**PandaMomentum** (9): and so I turn it up.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the breakdown at the end elevates everything

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9): solid open to the album. Took me a while to get into it bc I was not expecting a Flume like vibe from Charlie but after listening the album like 20 times it‚Äôs grown on me. I also love CRJ contribution, her voice is so textured.

**Stryxen** (9): me talking in my album comment about how I don‚Äôt really love this album anymore and then this being the first song i hear and making me doubt myself immediately

**Uberpigeon** (9): me when im backseat hosting putting shitpost suggestions in my ballot. by the way you should use this video for the shitpost [https://twitter.com/StrangestMedia/status/1587910036621230080](https://twitter.com/StrangestMedia/status/1587910036621230080)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): Look, it's not on my top-tier for two of my top-tier pop artists, but it's still nice. Or maybe it's (Cyber) Stockholm Syndrome (he he he). That percolating synth that comes in at 0:47 and 1:52 is a real "that hits the spot" touch, same with the percussion that starts at \~1:04-1:05 and 2:08. A. G. Cook and EASYFUN knew what they were doing. Or when the chords really kick in at 2:24 and the arpeggiated bridge synths at 2:41. Am I really gonna timestamp every specific production choice I like as I go through this record? Only time will tell. Anyway, I forgot about the warbling bleeps and bloops at that kick in at 3:17 to lead the song into it's minor-cacophony-of-sound-ending, gotta love that, let's bump up this song's score a bit just for that.

**camerinian** (8.5): Carly Rae doing hyperpop just seems so wrong inherently, and yet the way they chop her vocals up at the end is just euphoric. Brilliant. Genius. Iconic opener.

**homestarguy** (8.5): Charli shoulda been in the Frontseat if she didn‚Äôt want to Crash

**seasater** (8.5): pretty singing, nice synths and harmonies, cool beat, sparkly arpeggios

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): It‚Äôs wild to me that Carly is like a single degree away from hyperpop

**asdf1698** (8.2): I love CRJ‚Äôs verse

**CrimsonROSET** (8): carly rae jepsen if you‚Äôre reading this i am free on thursday night. if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out. i am free to hang out on thursday night so

**musical\_pyn** (8): The song is fine but the bridge/outro is excellent, I just wish carly was used more throughout the song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): honestly would've worked a bit better with a harder 4/4 drum beat instead of a weak half-time one, the outro with carly's looped vocals is so good tho

**welcome2thejam** (8): Two popheads titans, around the peak of their powers... yeah, this was never gonna live up to expectations

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I like some things about this but not others

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): this is a big letdown‚Ä¶ I mean, I still enjoy it a lot but I expected something greater. It‚Äôs Charli and Carly, c‚Äômon

**TiltControls** (7.5): Carly sounds angelic here

**flava** (7): This song is good when, maybe even great, but then I think about the lack of interplay or chemistry between Charli and Carly, or the annoying outro where the warbling bass-y sound starts coming in and the drills start going off. But still I can‚Äôt deny there is something special when the song does work

**frogaranaman** (7): so cool of them to release a song about the place their gay fans hook at in when listening to their music

**impla77** (7): You keep on repeating all alone, and yet this is a collab. Curious

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): strong opener

CyberpopRate: ## Lost All Hope Today,,,My Car Broke Down,,,,,,

**ulikejazz** (7): A cool opener, but idk this is kinda lacklustre to me

**DirtyRat583** (6): considering that this is a pc music album you would think that the intro was entertaining. YOU WOULD THINK

**Roxieloxie** (6): Its weird to think about how i was on the sub actually when pop 2 dropped, which is something i forgot until this very moment. I knew charli and carly were very beloved and I remember people loosing it over this collab and I think i listened to try and hear what everyone else was hearing and clearly it did nothing for me because here i am like 5 years later and i dont remember anything about how this song sounds

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Carly was so unnecessary here sorry

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): the more ‚Äúall alone‚Äùs i had to sit through the more my score dropped

**Awkward\_King** (1): i should love this i cant drive

**nt96** (10): I absolutely luv this song and its colorful mix of zany, melancholy and cheeriness.

**vayyiqra** (10): It's hard to dislike this song, with its melodic verses and one of her most anthemic choruses, and in fact it placed highest of all her songs when we first rated this album. Another selling point is the bitter lyrics about letting go of a toxic friend - I notice quite a lot of songs on this album are about friendships, both their ups and downs.

**seanderlust** (7.7): It‚Äôs fun! Grimes is always very enjoyable when she‚Äôs in her melancholy-lyrics-with-sugary-sweet-production bag. Is it fourth place, better-than-the-entirety-of-Bonito-Generation fun? Questionable. Still, miss Claire puts on a fun show and the lyrics can really hit if you‚Äôre in the right mood and listening closely. Raters really enjoyed this one generally - by the tenth ballot this was in the top ten, and halfway through the rate it had nestled into fourth place where it would stay for the remainder of the ballots. This is an enjoyable, very well-crafted piece of pop music that I do not expect to come back to. (Also fwiw I gave this and SCREAM the same score which given the contrast in performance‚Ä¶lol.)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): okay either this song is growing on me, or the rest of this rate is just not great so this is an easy highlight

**asdf1698** (9.8): what a pretty song about shade

**BaconShoes** (9.5): heavenly

**imbaby122** (9.5): we need more songs about destructive female friendships bc i swear platonic breakups hurt more than romantic breakups

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is like kill v main prelude

**pig-serpent** (9): The pedal tone of the guitar adds so much energy to a fairly loose and dreamy song, and it makes for the best of both worlds, unlike some KKB songs we may have rated recently.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): flesh without blood is just like yass without slay, like what's the point? Luckily this is both yass and slay

**Uberpigeon** (9): this song gives me such nostalgia of my 2015-2017 era of life. a life i spent terminally online, as i have continued to do, but the online vibes then were great!

**welcome2thejam** (9): This feels like a lost CHVRCHES song

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): So like‚Ä¶ watermelon flesh? Coconut flesh?

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i just saw bones and all....

**impla77** (8.5): This appeals to the toxic side of me that wants to cut off someone for annoying me once

**nick1372** (8.5): she said guitars

**frogaranaman** (8): this song gives me anxiety

**PandaMomentum** (8): pop pop

**runaway3212** (8): Yeah she slayed in this part

**squeezylemon** (8): A boppable fuck you is a fabulous weapon to have in one‚Äôs arsenal.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): finally a song that makes sense in this album

**homestarguy** (7.5): This one is nice, but just doesn‚Äôt really have any moment that elevates it to bop status imo.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): relatively "normal" within the album, that's the most I can say about it

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (5): i am not drawn to her doing cuts like this, which feel WAY too sonically streamlined and cruising beyond what I do like on the album. the based/cringe lever got tilted a lil' too hard towards cringe for me. but the video is funny as fuck, she loves her dresses and her gore!

**Roxieloxie** (5): i have a certain memory of this song thats not even mine but it makes me :/// in a multitude of ways that I dont think i will unpack right here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): worlds most generic pop rock instrumental with some of the most annoying vocals in the rate, what does anyone see in this the material is NOT there

**nt96** (10): Boy oh BOY, where do we even begin with this hulking loss? This was winning for the LONGEST time and I accepted that outcome‚Ä¶.until the last few ballots came in and prevented that, and we were FLABBERGASTED. Us Cyber-Hosts were HYPERFIXATED on whether it would reclaim its throne but to no avail, and that was that. With a record breaking amount of 11s, one of Charli's greatest songs and her biggest hope of a rate win came to an ear-splitting, screeching halt. We wrapped up 2022 quite neatly but not without ending it in one of the biggest upsets in recent rate history.

**seanderlust** (10): This track is unreal. From the beginning malfunctioning Wii-ass sound effects to the heavenly synths underlying the chorus all the way to the squeaky Animal Crossing dialogue sound effects, this song makes an immediate impression. There was a lot of debate in the comments over whether this or BIOYL was better, to which I say‚Ä¶[something something two bad bitches](https://imgur.com/1srgG5Z). Comparison aside, this song is wounded and gorgeous and has one of my favorite outros in music. Even though it didn‚Äôt win this rate, it was winning for the vast majority of the rate and does land on the leaderboard for most 11s - picking up an impressive 24! That‚Äôs almost ¬º of raters who said, yes, this song is the best in the rate.

**vayyiqra** (6): Without a doubt the song I struggled over my score the most in this rate ... "agonized" is a better word for it. After all the hype this song gets, the first time I heard it I was so ... whelmed. Yes it's an amazingly made song, but you have to understand I'm old :tm: and grew up on weird experimental glitchy stuff like Kid A and Wish You Were Here, so this doesn't have the same "wow factor". It's a bold sound Charli had never done before, but still has one of her biggest faults: her lyrics tend to be weak. For many of her songs that doesn't matter, but for a song which is trying to stir up emotion in the listener, it's not working for me. One of the things I like about this rate is that almost none of the songs in it are about anything romantic, so Charli singing about being lovelorn here isn't doing much for me and feels a bit out of place even. I do really like the synths behind the first chorus, that's a great moment, but then the arpeggios near the end (yes I know that's a favourite part for many of you) feels like it's trying too hard. It's so ... bombastic. It's like this song is telling me "hey you! feel emotions! right now!", but it's not happening. So I respect what a masterwork this is in production, but can't say I have ever had a strong bond with it. It was winning for most of the rate until it became neck and neck with "Kill V. Maim" and then "Bad Girls" snuck into the top 3, so that posed the dilemma of "if I tank this, Grimes most likely wins, but then I'll have to live with the guilt of rigging a rate", and I'm too moral for that. But my score here is a sign of how mixed my feelings are on this song. I do love those chirping samples like birdsong and plucking on the harp though. \[UPDATE\] In hindsight, after the results were settled and this came in third and we could chill a bit, I thought it over. This deserves a higher score, because I do like it even if I don't fully "get it". Luckily we have the hyperpop rate on Indieheads coming up! I will redeem myself there.

CyberpopRate: ## Track 11

**1998tweety** (11): more like Track 11

**akanewasright** (11): this was one of the songs I initially hated on the album‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt get that hook out of my head. So I felt compelled to relisten, asking myself why I was still so drawn to it. 5 years later, it‚Äôs one of my favorite songs ever. It‚Äôs absolutely brilliant in the way it pushes the limits of pop music, putting in style after style, noise after noise, daring you to ask if it‚Äôs still pop. That‚Äôs what I think the whole album is - taking something in pop music, twisting it a little, and asking you if it‚Äôs still pop. This is the clearest example of that, and it‚Äôs the fan favorite for that reason

**fadedblue09** (11): Spotify is telling me this was one of my Top 100 tracks back in 2019 so I guess I need to honor that somehow. (in all seriousness, I do like this song. The calming atmosphere, paired with introspective lyrics, is such a nice contrast to the wild nature of this mixtape).

**flava** (11): it‚Äôs really the only moment on pop 2 where the experimental moments actually accentuate and complement the melodies and the sense of yearning. Where the self-destruction of the songs mirrors what Charli does with her relationship. Everything really does come together into something a little lost in the haze but nonetheless special.

**handmadeh3aven** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping. I just love this song, it's such a unique experience

**Hulnia** (11): picking an 11 on this feels kinda impossible but ig it just has to be this. the whole song is insane but especially the bridge and the final chorus like omg maybe this is the best song ever made.

**hunnybee12** (11): speeding down the highway and nearly flipping my car getting off the exit (metaphorically)

**imbaby122** (11): stroke of genius. every sound is intentional, charli gives an incredible performance, the lyrics are devastating. just perfect. track 11 asf.

**jman457** (11): As much it pained me not to give it to Grimes, I specifically waited to the end of the rate bc this song is so amazing. A true feeling of 3am after a night partying and the comedown hits.

**Keno478** (11): THE Charli XCX banger, I notice something new every time I listen to it. There‚Äôs a reason fans still talk about this deep cut 5 years later.

**nootnoot781** (11): i've listened to this song so much, i actually ended up dreaming about it. in my dream the song got remixed really badly and had a lizzo feature on it. the lizzo feature was really good but it had such god awful production that it flopped both with the fans and commercially. anyway thank god that never actually happened, i would've hated charli to waste a lizzo feature like that aha x.

**PandaMomentum** (11): song of the year, at the time the best.Charli.ever.

**pheromenos** (11): 2019 me thought i was so slick to discover this alternative experimental glitchy beep boop masterpiece and now i'm just another gay in a sea of gays

**pig-serpent** (11): Possibly the best pop song ever written and the song that converted me into a pophead. Even after years every listen to this song sounds like a magical journey. In my will I'm requesting this song be played on loop.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): More like Track 11 am i right

**reput4tionera** (11): once i played this in the car with my mom and she made me turn it off

**sarcasticsobs** (11): People died

**slimboyfriend** (11): Charli XCX has the perfect voice for autotune and that's NOT a drag--I just mean she can convey so much emotion even when her voice is digitized to death while singing the simplest of lyrics

**squeezylemon** (11): I‚Äôm not even mad our queen decided to release a watered-down redux. Honestly if she wanted Charli could release variations on this until after her death, it‚Äôs that good. Bookending such a perfect album with two phenomenal tracks is so satisfying. The way this song builds and falls is a masterclass. IT‚ÄôS CHARLI, BABY!!!!

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This is the song that first really got me into glitchier, more hyper-pop style songs. The outro of the song is completely ascendant, and it is definitely one of the Charli Songs of All Time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): when charli xcx said ‚§ï‚ùπ‚û®‚≤∫‚ñ¨‚Üî‚≤é‚¶º‚ß†‚¨ù‚Ä†‚éÉ‚öö‚¨Ä‚™ß‚éù‚ûì‚¶°‚äö‚ö®‚áë‚∏á‚•ó‚ãÇ‚ÜÑ‚¨∏‚©°‚á™‚á∞‚§§‚©ö‚å®‚ñ®‚§ô‚¢Å‚ùÅ‚¥≥‚å±‚£í‚ú¨‚Ü¥‚£∫‚èï‚ìâ‚èß‚ú•‚¥Ω‚ú∏‚è∫‚ßø‚äé‚éß‚çë‚ñæ‚º©‚õô‚ºÉ‚ìá‚°¢‚≥Ä‚∞∞‚ù£‚£é‚Éô‚òÇ‚∞µ‚úê‚•æ‚ù©‚è£‚∫¨‚Ñë‚®®‚µå‚èÜ‚ßô‚äõ‚óì i felt that

**theburningundead** (11): This is still Charli's best song, a real masterpiece

**runaway3212** (10): the best song ever

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I wish we had multiple 11s in this rate so badly. This sounds like a robot learning to feel and I‚Äôm here for it.

**shipperondeck** (10): track 10.

**Stryxen** (10): sometimes i‚Äôm so amazed this song really exists, one of the most genius songs i‚Äôve ever heard unceremoniously untitled at the end of this mixtape but the music really does speak for itself like that, i don‚Äôt even know what title would do justice to this masterpiece. Her best song and i don‚Äôt think this could ever be topped

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I don't think I can add much more here, it's just an amazing track

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Blame it on the juice

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): hah! it's in the name! such clever commentary

**TiltControls** (10): Tens across the board solely focused on this track

**welcome2thejam** (10): Okay yeah y'all were right this boat races Blame It on Your Love, and tbh I liked that one

CyberpopRate: ###**Track Less Than 10 But Greater Than 6**

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9.5): I have listened to this song like 40 times. The refrain ‚ÄúI blame it on your love‚Äù just gives me chills.

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): Hi I'm the one person who thinks I Blame It On Your Love is way better

**nick1372** (8): While I really admire this song's twists and turns and Charli's vocal performance, it really just doesn't go as hard as Blame it on Yo--wait hold on a second I need 30 seconds to get absolutely steamrolled by the monster of a bridge on this song--anyway as I was saying

**steelstepladder** (8): Kind of a perfect representation of the album. Really good, high quality stuff all around, but we know a better version is coming down the road

**amr** (7.7): a song that took 4 years to click for me but when it did I was walking to my baby sister's school to pick her up and aired her the entire walk back cos I was looping it and having multiple epiphanies

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): can't wait until we get to rate the dy11an brady remix of BIOYL

**impla77** (7): its fine

**Low\_Stable7628** (7): this Pokemon scream-ass intro

**seasater** (7): quirky experimental song alert! aw its so pretty angelic. fucking again!!!!! was ready to give it a low or mid score but then the third act just eleeeevaaates ungh

CyberpopRate: ## Track 6 Items Or Less Aisle

**frogaranaman** (6): I like the Lizzo version better

**Uberpigeon** (6): this song is so overrated im sorry charli fans. its just kind of a whatever track with a big breakdown at the end and its not as exciting as some people make it out to be!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): ‚Ä¶ i prefer blame it on your love

**ricki** (5): gays be like ‚Äútalented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before‚Äù and then it‚Äôs just *autotuned distorted vocals* *glitch sound effect* *bleep bloop bleep* *metallic sound*

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): blame it on your love is a better song (although I think that song does miss the emotion of this song by being more upbeat). But the production doesn‚Äôt match with the lyrics at all, it just feels like someone went into the studio with Charli‚Äôs skeleton of the lyrics and made some cool noises and put her part over it. Like Charli‚Äôs lyrics and melody are great on their own, the production is good on its own but together it doesn‚Äôt work at all. And that irritates me alot.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): this song is the audio equivalent of getting blueballed

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): did this really need to be over 5 minutes long?

## Blame It On These Scores (but not really, be sweet to them)

**Awkward\_King** (3): i am so intensely sorry for this opinion because i am aware it is local-coded but i just so sincerely prefer BIOYL its so much boppier

**Roxieloxie** (3): blame it on your love is actually my most played charli song so im a little disappointed I dont like this more, i know this is the blueprint of it but the more it goes on i'd really rather just go listen to BiOYL

**nt96** (7.500): this album took a while to grow on me and even then, I kinda liked HIFN a bit better üò≠. That being said, this was still enjoyable and I see why XCX stans love it so much. While the sounds of "hyperpop" have existed years before, you can def see where that soundscape def started to take off especially after the Vroom Vroom EP. Combine these experimental sounds with an all-star cast of both well beloved and up-and-coming artists, each with diverse backgrounds, as well as from LGBT communities and you got yourself a modern classic.



**seanderlust** (8.220): Say what you want about Pop 2 and Charli in general, but this album was more than just an album. It was a genre-defining project that a main(ish) pop girl took a chance on to incredible success. It‚Äôs worth revisiting just how left-field this album was when you look at where most of pop music‚Äôs focus was that year. Pop had come down from the high of early 2010s maximalism, had retreated into a Lorde-inspired minimalism, and was struggling to find its identity. Charli offered a new direction, one crafted by the talented hands of SOPHIE, A.G., Hannah Diamond, and other early hyperpop pioneers. This was a moment that, if it did not change all of pop music, it changed a significant portion.

**vayyiqra** (8.100): A great album (mixtapes aren't real [joke]) that took me a while to get into, not because of finding it inaccessible (I love weird takes on synthpop) but ... I don't even know. Resistance to the hype it was getting? See, I used to be kind of bitter about how all the attention and praise Charli's music got after 2016 when she began her hyperpop era, as a former diehard stan of her True Romance era. But now I'm over it and see that this is one of her best works and even though sometimes I feel like she needs to be told "more features isn't always more better and there is such a thing as a chorus that is too repetitive", damn the hooks on this are good and the production on this is outstanding. (Shoutout to A.G. Cook, dude rocks.) As well, Charli's lyrics sometimes feel empty when they're just "lol cars and partying", but this album isn't like that - there is some real emotion here. While as anyone who knows me could predict I was gunning for *Art Angels* in this rate, this is a project that does deserve a lot of respect for what it achieved and the influence it had. Having said that, if you like Charli I beg you at least give her debut a chance, it's good! But this was a step she needed to take to get her career on track and it paid off.

CyberpopRate: **akanewasright** (10.100): This is like my favorite album ever and one that was deeply formative for my tastes, my lack of comments is solely bc it‚Äôs finals week and I want to d\*e, I could write essays about all of these

**thedoctordances1940** (10.100): This is one of my favourite "albums" of all time, it's comfortably her best project. The collaborators are almost all fantastic (we don't speak about jay park), the production sounds great throughout, the songwriting is Charli at her best and I cannot praise this mixtape enough, it's just incredible from back to front really and I felt like I'd be doing it a disservice by not giving it the perfect average it deserves.

**Hulnia** (9.900): the best album ever made no it‚Äôs true

**plastichaxan** (9.770): This is genuinely one of my favorite albums ever, this album brought me back to being an Angel full force and I adore Charli with my life, regardless of how this does I‚Äôm so glad I could get to express my love for it!!

**MassiveThief** (9.750): favorite of all time, flawless, changed my life, listen to it every day, etc etc

**imbaby122** (9.580): wow. pop 2 is incredible, managing to showcase everything that pop music can be in a few perfectly curated tracks. pop 2 isn‚Äôt my favorite charli album (she perfected the 2 month long album process with how i‚Äôm feeling now), but i can see the argument that it‚Äôs her best, effortlessly incorporating a vast array of collaborators onto a.g.‚Äôs glossy, sprawling production, and including some of charli‚Äôs most devastating songwriting and vocal performances, along with some of her poppiest, catchiest tunes. this is a genuinely impressive feat for her first full length venture into this ‚Äúhyperpop‚Äù sound, mixing the emotional with the mechanical, the mainstream with the outlandish, and overall creating one of my favorite albums (mixtapes) of all time.

**pig-serpent** (9.500): It's Charli baby. After listening to SOPHIE's Ponyboy I was told to listen to this album... and I hated it and turned it off halfway through. But after being told that Track 10 was transcendental I gave it another listen, and it's been steadily growing into one of my favorite albums since then, as well as turning me into a bonified pophead and eventually leading me to this sub.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.450): I could rate this album from memory, simultaneously a cultural reset and pop‚Äôs best kept secret

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9.300): My fav album on this list and quite possibly just rose to one of my top 10 albums of all times. The production is ridiculous, the features are amazing, I never get tired of listening.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.250): It‚Äôs no wonder that many Charli fans and even pop music fans in general herald this record as the, well, second coming of pop and Charli‚Äôs magnum opus. And while this record isn‚Äôt perfect, and I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs Charli‚Äôs best album (that‚Äôd be how i‚Äôm feeling now), this album is so magnificent and straddles the line between experimental and yet biding by all of pop‚Äôs trademarks‚Äîit‚Äôs tough not to agree with said fans. Some of Charli‚Äôs finest works and best collaborations land here, and marks the start of a golden era for her and hyperpop that I can only really hope returns with new vigour. For now though, Pop 2 is a record that may need some getting used to‚Äîbut once it truly clicks, it‚Äôs like the gears of the femmebot start churning for good.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.230): Ah, yes, features, one of Charli's greatest strengths but also one of her greatest weaknesses. A true battle for the ages, an Ace versus a Slugger-type battle. But good has vanquished evil. This round at least, but who will come out on top in the best-of-7 series? Looking at Charli's discography, all signs point to a 4-game sweep for Good (Reading this back, just what was I shooting for with this comment?)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.220): this was my first ever Charli album, and as such, a lot of the songs on here took some time to grow on me, since it was outsold my usual sonic comfort zone. But now, i can look at this album and really appreciate it for how fantastic it is, and it absolutely deserves it's icon status

**bogo** (9.150): I don't know if i'd call this charli's best project, but it's definitely incredibly strong and the one I think has the highest highs.

**cocosairdep** (9.000): A perfect pop album, just so fun. All of the features get to shine and do their thing without losing cohesion or overshadowing her in the process, it‚Äôs a great balancing act. It really is hit after hit after hit. Still my favorite Charli project to date.

**jasannn** (8.950): I don‚Äôt think she will ever top this.

**fairytalehigh** (8.930): i remember seeing the announcement of this album--sorry, MIXTAPE--like it was yesterday. SOPHIE? tove lo?! CAROLINE POLACHEK?!?! CARLLYYYYYY?!?!?!?! miss xbox had her pulse on the zeitgeist on this one, like nothing she'd done before or since. fond memories of listening to the album for the first time on my noise canceling headphones, snowed in at my house, while the power was out. good times.

**hikk** (8.800): back in 2017 during my baby pophead era when i first started browsing the sub this mixtape was so vital to my music taste developing, as far as pop music goes at least this was definitely a gateway into more abrasive and experimental production during a time where i was mostly listening to hot 100 hits so it holds a special place in my heart <3

**lipe18090** (8.800): 8.8

**shipperondeck** (8.780): there are a couple songs here i wont die defending but this is still one of the best things ever

**cremeebrulee** (8.760): music was so good she invented a sequel

**Keno478** (8.700): Honestly one of my favorite albums of all time and it holds up so well.

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (8.580): "who the fuck is scraeming "LOG OFF" at my house. show yourself, coward. i will never log off 11:36 PM ¬∑ Sep 15, 2012" \[all comments for this album are withheld until indieheads rate it for Hyperpop; every comment has been replaced with a dril tweet\]

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.500): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_EgwtMi1qMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EgwtMi1qMg)

**Sam Ray** (8.500): 9

**1998tweety** (8.400): the gag that charli has the best album by far

**IIIHenryIII** (8.300): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**jman457** (8.190): probably charli‚Äôs magnum opus, a melding of boom clap charli, true romance dark wave charli, and futuristic hyperpop charli.

CyberpopRate: **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.990): if you would like to hear my extended thoughts about this album make sure you do the hyperpop rate on indieheads next april hosted by me ‚ù§Ô∏è

**nick1372** (7.800): It's an extremely arrogant move to call your album Pop 2, a complete recreation of the most, well, popular genre of music. Only Charli XCX would try it, and only she could actually pull it off! This album is full of bangers, each more innovative and fresh-sounding than the last.

**welcome2thejam** (7.700): Indieheads rate committee will remember this.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.700): if pop 2 was so good then why is there no pop 3

**Stryxen** (7.400): iirc this was the first album out of these 4 i got into, i loved it at first listen but it‚Äôs consistently grown off me ever so slightly since and at this point it‚Äôs just lost the spark to me.

**DirtyRat583** (6.760): men make a meaningful contribution to this album \[IMPOSSIBLE\]

**throwaway-7650** (6.700): I'm afraid charli is just an artist that I will never fully get, there's some good songs but overall there's not much I'd return to on pop 2

**Low\_Stable7628** (6.600): 6

**fadedblue09** (6.450): This is the first time I sat through this mixtape in one sitting, but I have heard most of the song at some point since I joined the sub. Honestly I'm not a big fan of this era of Charli, too many features leading to many inconsistencies. I understand that she wanted to be collaborative, but I just prefer her music in a more atmospheric, solitary setting (hence, my 11 went to the one song that fits that very description).

**seasater** (6.050): great production over all very pleasant listen. my comments in this album and throughout and more notes to self than analytical comments but ill include them nonetheless.

**TiltControls** (5.950): I may not have loved the whole album (which is pretty standard with me and Charli) but I always love how at least she'll try to keep things interesting

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.500): I just don‚Äôt find this album very engaging. Nothing about it really sticks out, to my ears it‚Äôs a large goop of nothing, driven by boring vocal performances and instrumentals that are a bit too muted and/or non-impactful. If everything on this album sounded like Track 10 then maybe I‚Äôd be a lot more charitable.

**ricki** (5.470): everything charli tries in this album, vernon does better in gam3 bo1

**Roxieloxie** (5.470): I honestly feel bad rating this album because I know how much people love this album/charli in general. Like I cant disassociate some of my good friends both online and irl away from her just cause they ride for her so much. But this is just not for me as much as I dont think ,from what ive gathered, she doesnt like the more pop sound, i really only like her when she's doing that. Like im really sorry for my scores this just inst for me but im glad theres a large amount of people that have found community and love and everything from this album/charli as a whole

**Awkward\_King** (4.850): i love charli so much but i have never gotten pop 2, maybe its just too much for me but like a lot of this album i just feel like i understand when people call hyperpop noise. femmebot mothered though

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.400): charli music is just not for me and never will be, but some good songs on here

**moonagenightmares** (4.400): she fell off here

**seanderlust** (11): [YOU MANIACS!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQCoPL3-wo)

I went into this rate convinced that I was going to 11 something from Pop 2, or one of the KKB singles (KKB being one of my favorite bands), or hell, even something from MATANGI given the overplay that got from me in the mid-2010s. But nope. This colossal banger with the most batshit premise I‚Äôve ever heard took it. KvM is a pulse-pounding thrasher with driving synths and a chant that will wedge itself in your brain like a knife in a watermelon. It is unbelievably good, still to this day one of my favorite Grimes tracks‚Ä¶and yet it couldn‚Äôt snag the crown. Claire Boucher and coming in second place, [name a more ](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/qtwppb/comment/hkn2j3w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[iconic duo](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7qe4dw/comment/dsor3if/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

**vayyiqra** (11): B-e-h-a-v-e, Popheads! A 2010s classic and fan favourite, this is the song that maybe captures best, out of her whole oeuvre, the chaotic and zany energy of Grimes' mind and whatever thoughts go through her head (even those with detailed knowledge of her have to be ?! sometimes). You just know this is on several Spotify playlists with titles like "feral girl energy" and whatever. Its infamously bizarre backstory behind the nonsensical lyrics is also a funny bit, and I still get a chuckle to this day out of the sheer "wtf"-ness of it. While I gave this my 11 since it was a clear frontrunner and I didn't really care which Art Angels song got my 11 (the whole album is one big 11 to me), sometimes I do think this song is a bit overhyped - not because it doesn't deserve it or isn't great, but because it overshadows the rest of the album which is pretty good too. But without a doubt if your goal is to show someone what Grimes is like as a person and musician, this song and its over-the-top video are about as "her" as it gets.

**nt96** (10): This doesn't slap, this doesn't bang, IT CURB STOMPS. This song shows off Grimes quirky ability to get into a character to her fullest extent. With her vocals shifting between childish, shrill, punkish and tranquil, Grimes exerts a deranged joker-like persona as fluctuating as the beats themselves, all the while keeping that adrenaline to an all time high.

CyberpopRate: ## Gender-Bending Al Pacino Who Can Fly And Travel Through Space

**AzettImpa** (11): yupppp

**cocosairdep** (11): of all the songs about Al Pacino as a gender bending vampire who can travel through space, this is probably my favorite one

**IIIHenryIII** (11): B-E-H-A-V-E arrest whomever give this a score below 5

**LilacDaffodils** (11): my eleven was so hard to choose but this song has been apart of my life for so long and I have yet to tire of it. When I am sad, happy, angry it does not matter I will probably turn this song on.

**martian\_pet** (11): insane vibes, the first grimes song I ever heard, inmediately obsessed

**moonagenightmares** (11): changed my life

**oscarbrierley1** (11): i have absolutely no idea what the lyrics are but it sounds so fun.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this is my 3rd time 11ing this song and i absolutely do not regret it

**rotating3Dtext** (11): feels weird giving my 11 to this non sense song but... it's like that

**Uberpigeon** (11): one of the top 10 gender switching al pachino time travelling vampire songs for sure

**welcome2thejam** (11): "I choose... uhhh... Maim." "He chooses Maim!" Grimes yells before howling to the night sky to call her creature of choice. A rotted, hulking figure steps out of the black with a stiff grunt. It's the grizzly bear this week.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah idc this is the Grimes song. It‚Äôs completely bonkers, but in a way that‚Äôs actually executed perfectly. The production is immaculate and perfectly demonic and depraved, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the right levels of insanity clicking

**asdf1698** (10): Inject it into me

**BaconShoes** (10): This song goes so hard‚Ä¶CUZ I‚ÄôM ONLY A MAN, DO WHAT I CAN!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I‚Äôm assuming Grimes will have enough tankers for none of her songs to win but like‚Ä¶this would fully deserve a crown.

**bogo** (10): i think this song being my introduction to art angels, and grimes in general, really gave me a bit of a wrong impression about what the rest of the album would sound like, which initially left me a little disappointed when i listened to the rest of the album for this rate. idk exactly how that relates to my feelings on this song though, but it is a massive banger

**cremeebrulee** (10): this being the rate villain of redemption was so undeserved idc idc this is literally the sexiest song of all time

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is the most mundane shit ever butt here is one specific street i have to cross at midnight when i‚Äôm coming back to uni and i have a playlist specifically for when i‚Äôm crossing that street dancing and having fun because no one is watching and this is the first song on the playlist

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (10): "‚ÄúKill V. Maim‚Äù is written from the perspective of Al Pacino in The Godfather Pt II. Except he‚Äôs a vampire who can switch gender and travel through space." yeah sure grimes. BUT at least the video and song damn outright slap. industrial strength production crossed with a weird deviation from chromatics or other synth-laden acts turned this into one of the most sonically challenging cuts on the sound system. there appeared a level of distortion is there in the mix that is clawing at the fray and yet totally makes the cut the perfect little nugget it is. Grimes rlly be an otherworldly talented vocalist and maniuc screamer, one that feels based in pure texture and MAKES a cut like this that could be "oh that's too much faery", insanely replay-able. hysterically based outcome.

**darjeelingdotcom** (10): I used to jog constantly to this. Maybe the perfect jogging song. The drums leading up to the chorus? Crazy. I also tore my hip socket from running overuse so maybe I have Claire to blame really

**DirtyRat583** (10): she made this song fuelled on slay juice and a fuckton of spaghetti

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I was going to write a comment about misheard lyrics but then I realised I barely know what she‚Äôs saying anyway. For example, I just learnt it was ‚Äúbig time bomb‚Äù and not ‚Äúbig time bum‚Äù when reading the lyrics to make this comment.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): rat\_going\_feral.mp4

**frogaranaman** (10): breakdown vocal chops are insane

**hunnybee12** (10): maybe she snapped

**imbaby122** (10): i will not feel whole, fulfilled, or complete until i can scream ‚ÄúYOU GAVE UP BEING GOOD WHEN YOU DECLARED A STATE OF WAAARRRRRRRRRR‚Äù in a room full of people

**jasannn** (10): this is my fight song

**Low\_Stable7628** (10): she was kinda insane for this one...

**MassiveThief** (10): I think I listened to this 100 times in a row the first time I heard it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): who said rate winner

**PandaMomentum** (10): fave rave

**plastichaxan** (10): Al Pacino‚Äôs character in The Godfather, but get this: He‚Äôs a vampire that can change genders and travel through space!! This literally shaped my gender identity and it‚Äôs kinda sad I have to thank Grimes of all people for it

**reput4tionera** (10): banger of all time

**ricki** (10): the best introduction to grimes as an artist was reading her explanation of what this song is about. told me everything i needed to know about her

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Grimes reaching for her HIGH high register is always a risk, but it pays off here. 11 contenda. Still one of the most psychotic stories behind a song's lyrics I've ever heard

**seasater** (10): this song is just fantastic. you get all the facets of grimes' dynamic voice. its a bop you can dance to. the fire bridge is so gorgeous. spelling out letters in a chorus is an instant way to be a classic. punk rock vibes.

**Stryxen** (10): masterfully executed, she sounds like she‚Äôs letting loose but every moment of screaming or chaos is precisely and carefully placed for maximum bubblegum overproduced sleazy trash but simultaneously pretentious garbage it‚Äôs like performance art itself

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): in any other rate this would be SUCH an easy 11, so fun and powerful and an adrenaline rush

**thedoctordances1940** (10): smash hit

CyberpopRate: ## Going to the Party, Going to the Show

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Claire going on about how she tries to make an as aggressive song as possible and like‚Ä¶ Venus Fly comes not 6 songs later sis?? This one slaps tho.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): a token "what are songs about bizarre topics" popheads thread song

**camerinian** (9.5): gamers you gotta get Crypt of the Necrodancer on PC and do a custom import for this song

**homestarguy** (9): Okay can‚Äôt deny this is a banger, even though I hate those vocals on the 1st part of the chorus lol

**impla77** (9): really gives be jinx vibes when she says WARR!!

**Keno478** (9): This is where the album gets interesting! Love the genre blending here and the lyrics are so fun.

**pig-serpent** (9): I loved this song for a long time but it grew off me. Once everything kicks in, most of the instruments sound a little too muted.

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): an electro-punk cheerleader banger about a time-traveling gender-bending vampire mobster, your fave could NEVER

**throwaway-7650** (8.9): why is grimes repeating "OVA" over and over again in the chorus... omg wait she's supporting the anime rate VOTE FOR ANIME PLEEK

**nick1372** (8.5): a track like this perfectly fits her voice

**jman457** (8.3): just an immaculately made pop rock song

**runaway3212** (8): SPILLING

**flava** (7.5): it‚Äôs good but I can‚Äôt take y‚Äôall seriously, calling it the greatest song ever

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): Again its fine, I just wouldn‚Äôt really go looking for these songs

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): punk music for people whose metal music is XS

CyberpopRate: ## Regular Al Pacino Who AS FAR AS WE KNOW Can‚Äôt Do That

**apatel27** (6): Just isn't hitting like it used to

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): The production is excellent here but this is why I can‚Äôt get into grimes sometimes, her voice is such a barrier sometimes (also the lyrics are a bit cringe).

## Arrest Them

**fadedblue09** (0): I considered giving this my 0 in that cursed Redemption Rate, and my feelings have not changed on it since. If anything, they just got worse.

**Roxieloxie** (0): I was willing to hear this out until the chorus hit and I just lost it. I hate the high pitched voice on the chorus I have no idea how popular this track is so sorry if this is like the winner or something but I cannot stand it at all

**TiltControls** (0): the vocal effects grimes loves to use can work for me sometimes (see my 11) but here using it during the chorus(?) kinda tanks the song for me

**nt96** 8.320: STORY TIME!!! Somewhere in my college years, I discovered GarageBand on my new Macbook with absolutely no clue about what it was or how music production even worked. Using my piano training from High School, I slowly but surely learned the ropes of the program until I got the hang of it, and before I knew it, it became one of my biggest hobbies. As I learned more and more and began making little songs of my own, I began to wonder what artists have used this program to its fullest, that's when I discovered Grimes. As weird as Visions was, I admired her confidence in self-expression. Then I discovered Art Angels and the rest is history.   This album is easily amongst my all time favorites. Visions already showcased her talent, versatility and her willingness to not only be the voice of her music, but the foundation behind it as well. Art Angels took those strengths and kicked it to 11. With a updated Logic Pro usage, newly acquired digital art kits, self-training in multiple instruments and a higher budget, Art Angels is without a doubt, one of the best glow-ups in recent music history. It‚Äôs the music equivalent of answering the question: ‚ÄúWhat would you do if you knew you could not fail?‚Äù. Grimes wasn‚Äôt interested in impressing everyone, she simply unabashedly expressed herself without limitations, and that‚Äôs was I like about her. While her career has recently been mired with some problematic decisions, it doesn‚Äôt take away what I love about this album and how it inspired me to express myself.

**seanderlust** (8.171): Though I love all four of these albums dearly, this is the album that is arguably the most cohesive and consistent. Even the low points are enjoyable. Grimes had a vision she clearly articulated to incredible effect. While some of Grimes‚Äô music has struggled to connect with me, whenever I need an upbeat-ish album with forward-thinking instrumentals and artistry out the wazoo, I do not hesitate to [give Grimes a dall](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2020-07/27/16/asset/9ddb0b23669a/sub-buzz-5147-1595865836-7.png?downsize=900:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto).

**vayyiqra** (10.00): My favourite album of all time, the one I've played the most in my life (literally hundreds of times for each song), and a masterpiece which Grimes will likely never surpass; one of the best albums of the 2010s. What do I even say about it? Ironically I have played this album on my college radio show several times and had no problem talking about it, but right now words are escaping me; I guess that's what comments are for (and my writeup in the rate post is there too if you want to read it). But this album was a huge left turn from Grimes after her career being mostly dark, vaguely gothic electronic and experimental music that paid off stunningly well. Funnily enough I didn't get into this album for a few months after it came out, until I got Spotify in the summer of 2016 to listen to it ... and then couldn't stop listening to it. Suddenly I was transfixed; I'd put it on every day and listen to it, then play it again, and again ... it was like everything shifted. This album never gets old to me no matter how many times I play it; as frustrating as Grimes can be I'll always love this, I think, and I'm so glad we got to rate it again after I missed the first time.

CyberpopRate: **plastichaxan** (9.700): For better or worse this album was genuinely transformative to me and a real stepping point in my music journey I wish Grimes wasn‚Äôt the devil herself cause this is such an important album to me sfjkskjfd

**throwaway-7650** (9.686): my 11 was pretty much locked going into the rate but doing it made me appreciate the whole album much more so tyvm hosts <3

**IIIHenryIII** (9.571): this is one of the best pop albums ever, like top 10 no kidding. Also, Grimes has turned into one of my faves in the last couple of years. I blame popheads for that.

**cocosairdep** (9.250): This is one of my favorite albums of all time. It‚Äôs the perfect blend between pop and grimes‚Äô more experimental tendencies. The production is honestly immaculate, there are so many interesting details and choices throughout the album. The visuals are also great, all of the videos for this era are insanely good. But most importantly, every single song in this album is a BOP. Even though the stuff she‚Äôs put out recently is of significant lower quality, this project (and the rest of her discography to a lesser extent tbh) remains an absolute masterpiece.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.064): this album was a lot of first for me. It was in the first rate i ever did AND it was the first album I ever had on vinyl. There's just something magical about what Grimes managed to put together here, and I'm so glad to get an opportunity to rerate it.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.014): I remember being asked in 2016 which celebrity I could imagine as part of my friend circle, and I said Grimes. That hasn‚Äôt aged particularily well but the music is still fantastic

**asdf1698** (8.921): One of my favourite albums ever

**imbaby122** (8.879): i didn‚Äôt realize how much i loved this album until i revisited it in whole. as a playlist girl, i wasn‚Äôt aware of just how many hits were in this body of work. when i think about art angels it‚Äôs just kill v. maim to my silly little brain despite knowing and enjoying every other song. but damn am i glad that this rate forced me to listen to the album in whole, and realize just how powerful of a statement it is. from friendships, to mental health, to misogyny, and most importantly, to montreal, this album covers themes that are relatable and refreshing (no i‚Äôm not just bored of romantic relationship songs bc i‚Äôm unloveable they‚Äôre just getting a bit tired). not to mention just how intricate the production on these tracks is, completing the ethereal (and sometimes deranged) tone of grimes‚Äô voice perfectly. i am laughing and not being normal about art angels at all times.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.786): one of the greatest albums of all time #imo

**cremeebrulee** (8.679): i had a huge, huge grimes phase during the beginning of lockdown and sometime during it, this became one of my favorite albums of all time. it‚Äôs just superb, fantastical music to get lost in and honestly c, you don‚Äôt need to release anything else ever again !! please don‚Äôt actually !!!

**Stryxen** (8.550): god this blows me away every time, i always wanna say miss A or visions is my favourite grimes album just from personal connections, but this is so consistently great that it just has to be this one. This is the perfect night time driving album to me even tho it sounds so summery and upbeat at times and idk how i‚Äôve managed this connection

**moonagenightmares** (8.500): a modern classic

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.500): awesome album. I really don‚Äôt have any thoughts on it, it‚Äôs consistently great and so much fun, but there‚Äôs nothing I can really nitpick. It‚Äôs certainly Grimes, and that‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse, but luckily it‚Äôs more of a blessing for me because I really do like Grimes‚Äôs brand of nerdy electropop.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.450): HIGH highs, but can get inconsistent. She is the hot 'n' cold slugger who gets you the four-baggers but at the cost of some untimely whiffs. Still probably her best project to date though, far from bad, a true "player in their prime" era, but could she have another in her...?

**fairytalehigh** (8.414): words cannot express how much i miss this era of grimes.

**shipperondeck** (8.371): dammit why was this good

**welcome2thejam** (8.357): Only somewhat familiar with Grimes' music, didn't realize how un-cyberish this album sounds at times. It's great though, some high scoring tracks on here & likely worth returning to

CyberpopRate: **seasater** (8.321): i am maybe biased bc i come into this album with a lot of pre existing love so if these scores are too outstanding maybe reduce them all by 1 point but dont delete my ballot please

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.214): One of the most colourful, catchy, overall wonderful pop records of the 2010s, this still remains to be Grimes‚Äô magnum opus. I‚Äôm glad to hear that Grimes doesn‚Äôt actually hate this album‚Äîthere are some songs on these that would be worthy of a top 50 songs, at least, of the decade. Not everything here is a winner but for the most part, every box‚Äî-performance, production, songwriting‚Äîis ticked for what I want out of a pop record like this.

**DirtyRat583** (8.179): WHERE IS FAIRIES CUM FIRST CLAIRE üòñüòñ

**jasannn** (8.171): idk how I managed to never listen to this album but it‚Äôs right up my alley. Bubble gum pop with a little edge from the amazing electronic production. It‚Äôs been stuck in my head for weeks.

**jman457** (8.100): This was the Teenage Dream for the Art hoe kids

**pig-serpent** (8.079): It's been a while since I was into this album, and I forgot how much the guitar on this album slays. An amazing album and it's a shame that Grimes has been a disappointment since this.

**MassiveThief** (7.964): Wouldn't have ever imagined Art Angels could be in a rate and it NOT be my favorite, but here we are. Grimes hit upon near perfection here, and however much she tarnishes her image she'll always have this album for me.

**Awkward\_King** (7.893): the more i listen to this album the more of a masterpiece i think it is so im gonna stop

**oscarbrierley1** (7.821): i have no idea what she is saying most of the time, but the beats are fun so slay, ig

**Keno478** (7.571): This was my first Grimes album and really helped me get into her older stuff, which I think has grown on me a bit more. But after exposing this album again I‚Äôve forgotten how stellar it is. Lot of solid bops with some exceptional tracks as well!

**nick1372** (7.429): I was very pleasantly surprised by this album! The first half especially is hit after hit. I've always liked Grimes's voice from what I have heard but I'm very impressed by her wide range of musical styles.

**bogo** (7.357): the opening run on this album is really rough and holds it back from greatness in my opinion but i still think this album has some of the best and most creative pop songs of the 2010s

**Low\_Stable7628** (7.214): 8

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.214): This one is really good! I love her voice, I love her production, there's a lot of good songs on this one.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.157): I had listened to this album a reasonable amount coming into the rate and thought I liked it but then I listened to it in prep for the rate and kinda felt nothing but luckily while actually giving it my full attention and rating I have gone back to realising no yeah it is a pretty good album. Has a few semi-duds still I think but also a few really great tracks.

**Sam Ray** (7.143): 7

**akanewasright** (6.857): I have to be in the right headspace for this album‚Ä¶ but when I am? There‚Äôs nothing else that does this better. Grimes is a mess of a person, but she‚Äôs a truly gifted producer

CyberpopRate: **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.679): yeah, i really dont get whats so groundbreaking about this album, most of the songs on here are either super generic or have been done before (and better) by other artists before. we should‚Äôve rated visions instead

**CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.664): jeepus crickets christropher. i told myself "im not gonna have big thoughts on this album. im not doing that". i failed. Art Angels is demonic, which based on this overall and by-its-parts score is me very clearly drawing a line wrt where I stand with Grimes. I have done such a good job not listening to Grimes and I WAS living a great life. This album has unfortunately opened that pandora's box slightly. By this point, "anti-imperialist" "enya enthusiast" Grimes had DDOS'd hipster runoff, had a real cunning idea of top 40 pop radio, & seemed to be in a good relationship with "the lisa simpson of labels", 4AD. Even if the multiple delays, restarts, and rampant sexism had somehow taken a while to get here, Art Angels genuinely Had a Vision for pop music that saw Grimes being able to be and do anything and everything; even if in 2019 she seemed to suggest it wasn't the end result she wanted (i refuse to take much of what claire says at face value, she talks a lot and honestly, that's a world unto itself). In the same year, 4AD would also put out the more scholarly n' overlooked Platform. I think Platform and Art Angels should be viewed as step-siblings, situated reports on trends that have now had about seven years to really sink in. Platform is back-end coded architecture, finding an angelic, humanistic quality to the machine and its electronic dance laden pulses; it is art for art's sakes at times, but deeply pleasurable nonetheless. Meanwhile, Grimes' idea of top 40 is pretty cunning and open-book; she can write engaging pop across a galaxy of styles. But returning to Platform's staunch dark humor and blank emotional states, it highlights a flaw that I have with Art Angles: this album misses a next-level art pop abstraction or having actual...songs that don't coast off of production majesty and enya overdubbing. The Art Angels I need, the one where "Everything is posed, every Sign selected with a fetishistic fastidiousness...pop as pure texture. Don‚Äôt look for depths, run your fingers along the surface," is sort of here but not quite as a result. Art Angels does a solid job of actively honing at this by being omnibus in sounds, production, and features--any cut im giving a 9 to basically passes with flying colors. Shit rips. Yet to me, something here in all of this is missing. There are parts of this album after 5 listens I still couldn't fucking remember existed on the damn thing! I kept having this sense that AA has a (god I sigh to write this I just don't have the term i need) "gamer-brain not-orientalism but obsession with the East" underwriting it at times. It's rarely suggested in a few splashes, but never quite kicked like a hornets nest. And honestly, I actively may be the only person who would brainstorm and wonder whether this would increase my adoration for Art Angels because I truly felt like i was grasping for straws with this one at times. I do wonder if this album had been more Eastern oriented over its approach to Top 40, maybe we would have been able to see this person with a greater level of qualification. The kind that the 4AD albums genuinely benefit from going in with all these years later and just perusing as a document of a time n' place. FWIW, Grimes can and does writes bangers, demonic ones more or less; but in giving me pure pop transcendence? not often enough. the hardest 6.66 i have ever heard in my life.

**lipe18090** (6.643): 7

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.357): I don‚Äôt dislike it? But don‚Äôt super like it either? I prefer Visions from Grimes and I prob wouldn‚Äôt listen to this regularly. It‚Äôs good but Pop2 is God.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.286): when is the visions rate

**TiltControls** (6.107): I think sometimes Grimes gets a little too experimental for my baby ears (hence the 0), but every now and again she'll strike actual gold for me (hence the 11). Though there were a few misses I found this much better as a whole than Miss Anthropocene that we rated last year

**Roxieloxie** (4.343): sick twisted fucked up and evil. Me and Grimes do not mix at all sonically, its like oil and water its never gonna happen. I just dont enjoy sonically how the album flows together and I know the whole thing is the cyberpop sound and based on my average for the rate, that sound may not be for me! but this one especially isnt

**fadedblue09** (4.214): To me, discovering the existence of Grimes and her music is like stumbling upon some cursed fanart on DeviantArt or uncovering some weird slash fic on AO3: it's baffling, confusing and it's hard to believe it exists, but it does, and there are more people into it than one would think. And that's not even getting into her personal life, which is just as mind-boggling. I hate how I can't offer a more detailed comment on her music, but I just couldn't find a way to express myself otherwise.

**nt96** (11): Pop songs that go THIS hard are rare but M.I.A. did it with ease. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the vid literally features female drivers doing crazy car tricks in protest to women in Saudi Arabia being banned! HOW CAN YOU TOP THAT. This song was my 11 the moment I became a host and I was afraid this song was gonna flop hard after seeing what yall done to the rest of her album, but it slowly climbed up and before you knew it, IT WON. Yall made her go through but we love to see a massive underdog win!!!

**seanderlust** (10): Ladies and gentlemen, your Cyberpop winner! Watching this bhangra-tinged banger snatch a come-from-behind victory over Kill v Maim and Track 10 was such a gag honestly - Track 10 was winning until the extensions came in. Also, having every M.I.A. track except this one go out by late day 2, only for this to be our winner? Iconic. Once all was said and done, Bad Girls found itself in first place, and it also has the honor of having our lowest controversy score at 1.237! Let‚Äôs hear it for non-controversial rate winner M.I.A. everyone!

**vayyiqra** (10): A rate winner! Even your hosts didn't see this one coming for quite a long time: for most of the period we were taking ballots, "Track 10" was in the lead and the only song that seemed able to challenge it was "Kill V. Maim". This song climbed into the top 10 and from there the top 3, and then these three songs duked it out among themselves and switched places quite often. This made for a much more exciting rate on our end, but still I thought this wouldn't win ... until it did. Perhaps we should've seen it coming since this song did almost win a rate before and is almost unquestioningly agreed to be awesome, which is helped by its memorable and very cool music video. "M.I.A., who is the least popular artist in this rate on Popheads as well as a late addition to the rate with an album almost nobody had heard before, won the rate" is not an outcome many thought would happen surely. But it did, and I'm not even that mad that Grimes lost ... again. This is still a really good song and definitely the best track on the album, and who can lie and say it's not a banger.

**bigbigbee** (11): there are two wolves inside of me. one of them is currently a public health professional. the other one was in high school in 2012

**buddhacharm** (11): I wrote a whole longform paper on this and its video so I have a bit of an obsessive attachment to it. I should probably incorporate some degrees of separation in my life

**DaHumanTorch** (11): one of the best songs and music videos ever made

**DirtyRat583** (11): im sorry she made a song called bad girls and we are surprised shes a bad girl?

**ignitethephoenix** (11): there is a reason I submitted this to Ratemas‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs cause I didn‚Äôt think we should rate this album‚Ä¶and we shouldn‚Äôt have based on how it‚Äôs going to do (it‚Äôs flopping for sure)

**amr** (10): her brown girl swag

**BaconShoes** (10): I mean‚Ä¶just an iconic smash

**bogo** (10): live slow die old good girls do it bad

**camerinian** (10): this being so good only makes the rest of the album that much more frustrating because the album is so full of ideas and yet they simply aren't cohesively put together anywhere other than here, where she somehow finds a way to seamlessly drop three iconic vocal hooks in quick succession without breaking a sweat

**celladonn** (10): sooooooo true

**cocosairdep** (10): a classic

**cremeebrulee** (10): how evil is it that this song is in a rate with two of my favorite albums ever... relistening to it makes me want to 11 it but i don‚Äôt want to inflict my second place curse on it again, so i won‚Äôt üôè

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I went through a period at like 14 where I was obsessed with this song. Interesting choice considering how incredibly unedgy I was and am now.

**Low\_Stable7628** (10): Give her her 10s. That‚Äôs one thing about me I give 10s where 10s are due. Her rap bridge is forever seared into my brain. Forever disappointed this didn't become the world-conquering smash it deserved to be.

**moonagenightmares** (10): i keep connecting the lyrics to her being antivaxx and its killing me

**oscarbrierley1** (10): has always been a banger, will always be a banger.

**plastichaxan** (10): I promised myself not to make more than 3 anti-vaxx jokes on the album so let me just say I‚Äôm so happy I already got 11ing this out of my system

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god fucking dammit why does she need to occasionally make the best song ever

**nt96** (8.400): As one of my favorite albums of the decade, watching this album get consistently dragged was truly painful, even if it was reasonable. Personally, I love music that‚Äôs unconventional and eclectic in spirit, mixing different club sounds with a wide palette of cultures from around the world to give you something that‚Äôs truly adventurous and MATANGI offers that in spades. The problem with this album was how different it was to the lineup. It shared the experimental aggression of Pop 2, the constantly shifting soundscape of Art Angels and the curiously layered lyricism of Bonito Generation. But the one thing it severely lacked: "sweetness", for lack of a better word. The other three albums had their quirks, but they also had a certain sense of sweetness to their sound that tied it all together and made their world a bit more approachable to enter. Matangi, on the other hand, offered none of that, it wasn‚Äôt welcoming in the slightest, became aggressive right off the bat and offered virtually no sense of respite, which alienated and even exhausted much of its pop-oriented listeners, many of whom have never heard her music aside from her signatures. MIA was sadly the black sheep here for many reasons and some have questioned why she was included in the lineup. The core ethos of Cyberpop is that it offered forward-thinking ideas, showing their diversity in their own ways whether it was their own or from others, and had an internet-focused approach to their brand. MIA came at a time when the internet became a mainstay and Myspace became the de-facto place to connect with the world, one that was still adapting in a post-9/11 society in the midst of the War on Terror. Fusing club-oriented sounds with her South Asian culture at a time that representation was almost non-existent, and using her voice to express the injustices through her point of view via the internet, MIA is pretty much the blueprint of a 21st Century Pop star, and perhaps the purest example of what Cyberpop is. I'm happy to see other people give her a listen even if it wasn‚Äôt all positive. I hope one day in the future, we'll give her another chance and rate Kala (her magnum opus) or even MAYA, but only time will tell.

**seanderlust** (7.200): In the mid-2010s, I drove a car that had a CD player and I had bought MATANGI on CD at a local record shop. Frequently while driving to work I would put it in, listen to the first two, then skip ahead to Exodus or Bad Girls. We talk about experimental production with Art Angels and Pop 2, but this is the album that probably has the easiest time laying the claim to experimental. This sounded like nothing else at the time, for better or worse. My biggest problem with the album is the inconsistency; I appreciate the influences and M.I.A.‚Äôs charisma, but this really is a collection of some of the greatest songs ever made and some questionable choices.

**vayyiqra** (8.067): The lyrics on this album are often written in a style that brings to mind the cut-up beat poetry with random phrases mashed together. While on other M.I.A. albums they aren't too hard to follow, this one has both the chaotic and abrasive sounds she's known for with lyrics that are often just "???". Matangi, what the fuck are you talking about? Tempted to say this is the last "good" album she'll likely ever make, though I felt Mata was really not bad, but her heart doesn't seem into music that much anymore. Before this rate I didn't know this album that well and would have rather that we rated Kala, my favourite M.I.A. album and one that I feel is a much better introduction to her music than this is, and we understand this album's rather long and not that easy to get into, but at least some of you liked it. Ironically one reason that was cited for not rating Kala was that "Paper Planes" was the one big standout track and clear frontrunner ... and then we rated the album with "Bad Girls" on it, which then won lol. But this album also fit better timewise since it's from 2013 and not 2007. Even so its datedness was said to be a downside of it, though I don't care about that myself. I feel this album really is pretty good, but messy and definitely too long, and that hurt its performance in the rate. If you didn't like it, I would still say you should try Arular or Kala and see if you like them better. It's too bad she seems to be much less relevant these days and most of Popheads doesn't seem to know her music well, because she was quite influential and innovative back in the day. M.I.A. made her whole career from getting influences from around the world, and first became popular because of the internet, so she was still a great fit for this rate.

CyberpopRate: **plastichaxan** (9.373): Ooooh boy this is gonna be tough. This average is partly defending M.I.A‚Äôs music (but not her of course), part just being extremely invested in this album. I know this won‚Äôt be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and I understand that 100% but it‚Äôll be sad to see the robbery unfold ~~By the point this average is revealed I probably have called half the songs out robbed anyway~~

**IIIHenryIII** (9.300): I'm in awe of how amazing this album is. I listened to Bad Girls when it was released as a single and added it to my playlist, but the thought of listening to the whole album never crossed my mind, and now I hate myself for that. This is spectacular. Also, I have to shout out Double Bubble Trouble, because that song is such a banger, literally one of the best things I‚Äôve ever heard. I almost gave it my 11.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.700): who else did it like her

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.433): she used to be so stannable, before going too far in the conspiracy theorist dipshit direction. my hot take is that MAYA is her best album, but MATANGI do not fail to serve up the electronic energy, eclectic influences and political lyrics that made M.I.A. a musical icon

**fairytalehigh** (8.307): revisiting this after the alex jones and candace owens brouhaha has been a real doozy. MIA was my first musical obsession and this is my 3rd favorite record of hers. really, nobody else could pull off these songs like maya does.

**Stryxen** (8.100): and where is Nadia Oh

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8.067): I‚Äôve listened to MIA since 2005 but didn‚Äôt keep up with her post sophomore album. This was surprisingly really good and I enjoyed hearing the progression of her production skills into the 2010s. I really need to see her do a DJ set live bc I bet that‚Äôs where she shines.

**Keno478** (8.000): This is one of the albums that helped form my music taste for years to come and I honestly think it‚Äôs aged like fine wine. There‚Äôs so many bangers here and the production is crazy fun.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.887): I made baseball references in every other album comment but I'm coming up blank here. But gotta commit to the bit. MATANGI is \[spins wheel\] Mike Lieberthal in that it aims for \[throws dart\] the cycle, but instead gets a small number of \[picks out of a hat\] frozen ropes scattered amongst the \[rolls dice\] punchouts. Anyways, "Galang" the 11 of M.I.A.'s career

**Sam Ray** (7.800): 8

**cocosairdep** (7.600): This album was such a pleasant surprise honestly. I knew paper planes and bad girls going into this, but this is the first full length project from her that I‚Äôve listened to. The first half of the album, up until bad girls, I absolutely love. So many interesting production choices and song structures. The second half falls a bit flat though, especially the singles. They definitely sound of their time, and not in a flattering way. Still, there are some absolute bangers here, like the title track and the one sampling the weeknd (bad girls as well obviously).

=====

CyberpopRate: **imbaby122** (7.540): i struggled with this album a bit. M.I.A. is such a pioneer, of electronic music, of internet culture, of producing in an overwhelmingly male space, and of discussing global political topics in her music. but matangi was just a little too out there at some points for my personal taste. not only were some production elements abrasive on the ears, but the audio quality of the entire album just sounded awful? which is weird for a relatively recent album. with the negatives out of the way, M.I.A is such a creative writer, and i could find something to appreciate in almost every song. in fact, i thoroughly enjoyed the songs where she stripped down the heavy, hectic production, and let the melodies and lyrics speak for themselves. i don‚Äôt think i could truly define M.I.A. with any one genre, which speaks to her creativity as a songwriter and producer, and elevates matangi as whole.

**cremeebrulee** (7.447): she was so khalamoni for this

**jman457** (7.433): There is some really forward thinking songs on here it but it drags in the end

**fadedblue09** (7.233): From a production point, this is probably my favorite album. M.I.A uses a diverse set of instrumentals that have varied influences, which made the whole thing engaging to listen to. Her lyrical themes are intriguing, but IMO they're not as compelling as she wanted them to be, and her recent actions makes me take them less seriously.

**DirtyRat583** (7.233): this album would be so shockingly mediocre without queen Bad Girls

**welcome2thejam** (7.133): Interesting album, didn't always hit but makes up for it with some real bangers

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.067): i still have yet to listen to MAYA so this opinion may change but this is easily MIA‚Äôs best album imo, it could even be amazing if she just cut a few songs

**RandomHypnotica** (7.007): the only album of the rate I was unfamiliar with going in, I think for the most part there is some really interesting ideas here, but it feels like the songs just can't stay put, it's like there's fleeting moments of magic in a lot of the songs that is just quickly replaced by some new sound

**jasannn** (7.000): idk why I always dreading to relisten to this album; the production is great and experimental in a good way. Nevertheless, these songs are too repetitive and blend in with each other so I probably won't revisit this album again

**akanewasright** (6.927): maybe I‚Äôd like it better if I heard it in 2013

**moonagenightmares** (6.893): this album has such high highs and such low lows

CyberpopRate: **CyberLietoc2k22\_version2.1.1** (6.747): "paul simon on acid" yeah sure okay there Maya. there is an n+1 article from 2011 that rather cunningly analyzed pitchfork and argued that MIA was no brand new, but retro: "Instead of striking out in pursuit of new musical forms, they tweaked or remixed the sounds of earlier music, secure in the knowledge that pedantic blog writers would magnify these changes and make them seem daring. Instead of producing music that challenged and responded to that of other bands, they complimented one another in interviews, each group ‚Äúdoing its own thing‚Äù and appreciating the efforts of others. So long as they practiced effective management of the hype cycle, they were given a free pass by their listeners to lionize childhood, imitate their predecessors, and respond to the Iraq war with dancing. The general mood was a mostly benign form of cultural decadence...M.I.A.‚Äòs politics worked in the same way, making the particular brutalities of oppression in Liberia or Sri Lanka danceable by lumping them into a vague condition of sexy global distress." There's a lot you can dissect there, but what I love about this pompous n+1 piece (besides quoting a Vampire Weekend cut to further this take) is that it does levy a humongous take against MIA's politics and the limits that were present and no one wanted to truly go to task with. That to me really doesn't detract from the sonic veracity and bliss of Kala (or my sampling of Arular in 2k20). But WHY music blogs in the mid to late 00s bolstered MIA before deciding to engage in a journalistic-180 and go after her...it never sat right with me; " She's a provocateur, and provocateurs want to be provocative" is what Lynn Hirchberg said in wake of the imperial-phase-killing 2k10 piece she wrote, and why not have chased that thread years earlier?! Music Blogs writ large used her when they didn't have the wherewithal to reach for the brass ring and have these dialogues tbh; end of story. Still, MIA can write bangers we can't forget this. Coming to Matangi, what struck me was how little she had actually was evolving sonically. it never mattered she was right about the government or had some hog wild takes or zany thoughts--just did she have bloody songs? and more often than not, Matangi sounds like MIA is getting flanked and beat at her own game across the board, even when the beats add up to a banging time. even if she did has aesthetic ideas--visually this album is a BLAST that helps salvage the "paul simon on acid" idea, she just isn't here as a rapper or lyricist period, especially over a bloody hour. god we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of Kala aren't we? how'd she squander this for a mid 6?! i will never revisit this again.

**throwaway-7650** (6.733): I don't get why this is in the same rate as KKB but oh well

**Low\_Stable7628** (6.667): 6

**TiltControls** (6.667): Took a while to grow on me, so I'm glad I didn't just send this in right away (though some tracks still haven't). Some absolutely stellar production can be found here - and though I don't think anything here (or ever will) matched the brilliance of Paper Planes there are still some amazing tracks here.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.540): M.I.A. tends to have a lot of ideas and I generally don't find that they all pay off for me and this is no exception really. There are some really good tracks here but there are also a few quite bad ones and some of them definitely could've been cut.

**Awkward\_King** (6.533): if her music was a little better id honestly be willing to believe vaccines were causing 5G

**bogo** (6.467): i respect this album for daring to be really weird and adventurous, but with that being said i have no fucking clue what is going on in like half of these tracks

**shipperondeck** (6.340): this is not my thing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.133): ive never listened to an album that was as hard to rate as this one. like half of these songs are simply beyond numerical value i dont know what to do with these

**MassiveThief** (5.733): this was a TRIP. she truly is an innovator, like I did not expect to hear anything like this from 2013. Doesn't always pan out... but damn.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.673): extremely hit and miss. some bops, but a lot of it is just noise to me.

CyberpopRate: **dream\_fighter2018** (5.567): this album is absolutely incomprehensible. Most of the songs here are three different songs rolled into one with absolutely no attempt to make them gel. All of these songs together, including Bad Girls which sounds fine on its own, make me feel like I‚Äôm in an altered state of mind and my brain seems to be reacting accordingly. It‚Äôs really hard to assign songs scores based on numbers when they make you feel like you‚Äôre entering a fourth dimension, but I tried anyway.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.533): If this album could have cut out its fat it would‚Äôve been a pretty decent or good record that manages to be hard-hitting and employ all these influences from electronic music and (what I assume to be) Indian/Middle Eastern music and R&B/hip hop/etc. But‚Ä¶ Jesus Fucking Christ I really have no clue what happened to some of these tracks, especially near the tail-end of this album, that just were straight up unlistenable garbage‚Äîeither just by virtue of her singing not being as charismatic or the instrumental just being a wash. This is definitely a ‚Äòpick and choose‚Äô album for your favourite tracks and just dump the rest. This was the one record I hadn‚Äôt heard yet coming into the rate and it‚Äôs really disappointing to see it not live up to the heights of a record like Arular. A huge mess.

**flava** (5.400): this was an exercise in patience. It's kind of cool that MIA relates to the Hindu goddess, Matangi, an outcaste which fits MIA perfectly because she's never really fit into categories with easy definitions. And I do respect that. Just wish this album actually followed through on the concept more and not relies on some tired uninsightful political statements that Idles would call clich√©d, with a distance that makes this album unengaging.

**hikk** (5.300): the only album here that i haven't heard at all and honestly i'm regretting not pushing harder for poppy.computer to be in over this, not because i necessarily think it would fare better in the rate overall but just for my own sake bc i did not really enjoy this at all i fear. for the most part these songs feel plodding and unexciting when the production choices should indicate something more exhilarating - instead i just found myself quite bored...

**lipe18090** (5.267): 5

**pig-serpent** (4.967): The only album I had never heard before the rate. I really liked it at first, but the more I hear it the more I feel like outside of a few highlights, this is just Treats, but bad.

**Roxieloxie** (4.600): dont accidentally look up afropunk headliners from 2016 worst mistake of my life

**ricki** (4.500): This whole album is just a drag. I can appreciate the production and how experimental it is, but they don‚Äôt make up for the fact that listening to this is a pretty unenjoyable experience. Multiple of the songs could be decent, but they just continue repeating parts that aren't good enough to warrant such repetition. On top of that there‚Äôs this air of pretentiousness around the whole record that makes me want to roll my eyes to the very back of my head, and also I can‚Äôt say I enjoy M.I.A.‚Äôs voice very much

**nick1372** (4.167): This might be the worst (or at least most painful) album I've ever listened to for a rate. This is what people think of when they call futuristic pop "pots and pans" music. So many of the musical ideas here just do not mesh, and they almost never come together to form a clear emotional message. I don't expect music to hand me an emotionally resonant theme on a silver platter, but I expect to feel something other than confusion. Maybe I just don't get it, but honestly considering MIA's current declining reputation I will certainly not be putting any more effort into getting it.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.000): I was worried the rate organizers were ignoring her idiotic anti-vax views but I'm so glad they're well aware and are against them. Anyways, this album was okay. There are some highlights like The Partysquad's insane EDM trap production on Double Bubble Trouble and of course the smash that is Bad Girls, but other than that there's not really much else I enjoy about it. A bit of an odd choice to put this album alongside the poppier sounds of Charli and Grimes and the bubbly vibes of KKB but whatever.

TiltControls: Great job with the reveal Vayy, Sean, and Cat! Now I'm going to go stream Bonito Generation 3 times and will be taking tomatoes thrown at me all night.

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congrats to **Bad Girls** for pulling out the win! It becomes the **131st** highest rated song across all rates. It sits below Britney Spears - Gimme More (130th) and above Mitski's Nobody (132nd). Across all winners it places 77th between Britney Spears - Toxic (Winners I) and Selena Gomez - Naturally. 

For anyone curious how it scored earlier in the year the ratemas iteration got a 8.969 and is ranked 388th overall. 

For other songs that crossed the 9 point barrier

* **Kill V Maim**: 148th
 * Between: The 1975 - The Sound (147th) and Brandy - Full Moon (149th)
* **Track 10**: 173rd
 * Between: Carole King - I Feel the Earth Move (172nd) and Bruno Mars - Treasure (174th)
 * Funny enough, it narrowly outplaces Kill V Maim from the original Art Angels rate (175th)
* **Flesh Without Blood**: 237th
 * Between: Kimbra - Cameo Lover (236th) and Little Simz - I Love You I Hate You (238th)

**Other song stats**

* **Track 10** takes a spot on the most 11's list! With 24 11s given, it places 18th overall. It ties with Taylor Swift's All Too Well which also picked up 24 in the 1st Anniversary Rate.
* **Kill V Maim** becomes the 2nd track in Popheads history to make it to the top 2 with more than two 0s. The only other time it has happened was with Red Velvet's Bad Boy also picking up 3 in the K-Pop Girl Group Singles rate.

## Artists

Charli, KKB, and Grimes have numerous other placements affecting their score, but this will be M.I.A.'s first time on the board. Artists are out of 350.

* 107th: Miguel (7.760)
* **108th: Grimes (7.755) [PREV 122nd]**
* 109th: Kelly Clarkson (7.752)

-

* 164th: Bridgit Mendler (7.559)
* **165th (TIED): Charli XCX [PREV 182nd] / Kero Kero Bonito [PREV 143rd] (7.552)***
* 167th: TLC (7.549)

-


* 281st: The Jonas Brothers (7.039)
* **282nd: M.I.A. (7.035) [NEW]**
* 283rd: Pharrell Williams (7.019)

-

\* though they are officially tied in rankings due to sig figs and all that, technically KKB has a 0.0005 lead on Charli

**Featured artist changes:**

* Janelle Mon√°e: 40th -> 39th
* Caroline Polachek: 52nd -> 51st
* Carly Rae Jepsen: 128th -> 125th
* The Weeknd: 130th -> 132nd
* Tove Lo: 155th -> 152nd
* cupcakKe: 202nd -> 195th
* Kim Petras: 246th -> 225th
* Dorian Electra: 248th -> 229th
* M√ò: 281st -> 273rd

(due to the guests only getting one song added onto many of their averages didn't change much)

**Other Artist Stats**

* **Grimes** has enough songs rated with 48 to make it into the most songs rated leaderboard for artists. She is tied in 24th along with Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera
 * **Charli** also moves up this list going from 14th to 12th
* **The Weeknd** appears in another rate, making him one of the artists to appear in the most rates on the sub. With 20 appearances he now ties Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, and Ariana Grande (though the last 2 will move up to 21 in January with the Ex-Acts rate)
 * **Charli** gets another appearance putting her at 19th and tying her for 4th with a few others
 * Now with 16 rate appearances, **Carly Rae Jepsen** also joins this list
 * Nicki Minaj (20) and Charli XCX (19) are the only artists on this list not to have won a rate yet
* **Charli** picks up enough 11s to move her from 8th to 4th on the artist 11s list. She passes Ariana, The Weeknd, Lana, and Beyonce
 * Carly (currently in 2nd) also picks up 8 11s in this rate, closing the gap between her and Taylor Swift in 1st who is now only leading by 134 more 11s than her
* **Charli** also moves up to 4th for most 0's (previous spot was 6th). She passes Ariana and Rihanna to this new spot

## Albums

Averages are out of 362 albums rated

* 53rd: Janet Jackson - Rhythm Nation 1814 (8.074)
* **54th: Charli XCX - Pop 2 (8.056)**

* 241st: Little Mix - Get Weird (7.364)
* **242nd: Kero Kero Bonito - Bonito Generation (7.361)**
* 243rd: Yelle - Compl√®tement Fou / Hayley Kiyoko - Expectations / Niall Horan - Flicker / Panic! At the Disco - Vices and Virtues (7.359) [yes they are all tied lmao]

-

* 322nd: Nicki Minaj - Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (6.907)
* **323rd: M.I.A. - MATANGI (6.906)**
* 324th: Zara Larsson - So Good (6.890)

-

**Other album stats**

* With only 5.9% of the rate's 11s, **MATANGI** gets a spot on the lowest 11 dominance list as the 8th lowest overall. Unlike our current leader for this stat (Drake - Views), at least she got some
* A leaderboard that hasn't had any new entries since before Winners II has been updated! **MATANGI** becomes one of 3 albums to be marked for having the lowest 11 spread across the album. To achieve this an album must have all of its 11s accumulated on a single song. With **Bad Girls** picking up all 6 of the 11s given to this album, it gets to join this exclusive club. The other 2 members are The Neighbourhood's I Love You (4/4 11s went to Sweater Weather) and Whitney Houston's Whitney (12/12 11s went to How Will I Know)
* **MATANGI** breaks a record for the biggest gap between winning and losing its 2nd highest song. The final song on the album avoided elimination 20 times after the 2nd highest track, Exodus, went out in 21st. The previous record holder for this was set all the way back with Britney Spears' Glory when Slumber Party pulled off the win after Man On the Moon went out in 16th.

CyberpopRate: That's it for this rate! Cyberpop is over! Here's a brief recap:

* **M.I.A**., despite having only one song left by day 3, pulled off a sneak win with her widely acclaimed banger "Bad Girls" and narrowly beat both frontrunners Charli XCX and Grimes! Her lack of immunity was not a hindrance.
* **Charli XCX**, despite being widely expected to win, came in 3rd with her widely beloved "Track 10". However, she had a very respectable showing with the highest album average and over half of her songs made day 3.
* **Grimes** came in 2nd yet again (the third time in a row), this time with fan favourite "Kill V. Maim". However she also had over half of her album make day 3, and won the bonus rate with "REALiTi (Demo)".
* **Kero Kero Bonito** became the most polarizing artists in the rate with an average controversy of 2.118, and missed the podium. However they had a higher album average than M.I.A. and won Songeniality with "Break".
* Also today we were reminded that new Reddit is cursed and to never use it for anything that needs a lot of editing.

Thanks so much to everyone who did this rate and supported us! We got good participation and lots of comments! We loved showing you all these great albums!

For a much, much more detailed breakdown of today, see this comment by our wonderful rate statistician /u/TiltControls.

Be sure to check for upcoming rates here on Popheads and Indieheads! Pop 2 is in one. üëÄ

And thanks most of all to my cohosts /u/seanderlust and /u/nt96, the real MVPs of the rate, who ran the results and made the banners and shitposts while I merely tinkered with the comments and posted them.
