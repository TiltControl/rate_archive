Welcome to the Grammy Song of the Year Rate! I'm [Piccprincess](https://78.media.tumblr.com/dec39d78cdad346d025a5e68aa4e0f79/tumblr_ne645rgYUN1r5lqijo1_500.gif), queen of popheads, and I'll be one of your hosts this month along with the infamous [Tubbs](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323291518699831296/386345530588004352/20171201_213854.png) and the shit-posting king [/u/ThatParanoidPenguin](https://m.popkey.co/1a4190/1Zmy7_s-200x150.gif)! 

A quick word from my co-host:

"As you all know, the Grammy Awards are a celebration of music, honoring what The Recording Academy deems as outstanding achievements in the field of music. In this rate, we will be judging the merits of what The Recording Academy has deemed as the song of the year. We have 50 songs here today, all the way from 1968 to the present day. Whether you agree with the song of the year winners or not, this is a pretty impressive collection of music that outlines a rough skeleton of a timeline for late-20th century to 21st century music. And with this wide variety of music on display to rate, we implore you to use this rate as an opportunity to learn more about music. There’s a good chance you haven’t heard every song on the list, I know I haven’t. It’s rare to get a rate with Lorde alongside Billy Joel, or Beyoncé against The Police. So, please, give every track a fair chance, even though I know half of you are salivating about the Lorde 11, with the other half eyeing Beyoncé. 

"So, buckle up, because like the actual Grammy Awards, there’s gonna be upsets, unnecessarily long interludes, and at least twelve separate times we beg you for money (please donate to the /r/popheads mod team, they’re starving; I think one of mods ate the PopheadsBot for sustenance). This is gonna be a fun rate and /u/PiccPrincess and I will make sure of it, probably by holding you all hostage during the rate reveal."

Now, I was going to make a comment as well about how we should all give the older songs a chance, but I'll let Tubbs have a few words instead before we get to the songs:

"here's the rat

do it pls

thank"

###RULES

I'm legit just stealing this from everyone else, and if you break any of these rules I will permaban you from the sub.

- Listen to **each song** and assign each a score between **1 and 10**. Decimals are fine (please make sure they are decimal, not comma), but please don't give scores that have two or decimal spots: giving a **6.2 is okay, but a 6.21 isn't**. /u/letsallpoo has created this program, this is the way it is. If you don't put a score in, you break the program, and you ruin everything for everyone. Words to think about.

- Feel free to talk about your scores, we don't mind!

- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11.** Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. 

- It's not required to use these! Please don't give out 0's and 11's just because!

- You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.

- To make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post**, such as right [here](https://tinyurl.com/yb7kovkm). PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.

- If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but **I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.**

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. **Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!**

- **If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!**

- **I can't believe I even have to say this but don't change the submission ballot it just messes everything up** 

- If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song please feel free to message me about changing scores and I will be happy to oblige

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
>piccprincess: 11 Red deserved a grammy!

**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
>tubbs: 11: literally a gift from heaven

>tubbs: literally a gift from heaven11

>buckets: I'm giving a 1 because he's trash, unlike tubbs

>tubbs: 11-literally a gift from heaven

>tubbs: 11 (tubbs for president!)
