Piccprincess: # [#30: The Way We Were](https://i.imgur.com/7rgCHcg.png)

---

**Average:** 6.488 **// Total Points:** 376.3 **// Controversy:** 1.986

---

The Way We Were, written for the 1973 film of the same name, was a song that helped singer Barbra Streisand revive her career, and eventually became one of her biggest hits, placing at number one at the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 list. This Barbra track fared much better than the other one, but not too well, coming in at number 30.

---

**Highest scores:** (10 x2) jamesfog, letsallpoo (9.3 x1) Sunny\_Waterloo (9 x4) agentofscranton, kanyewestrep, Leixander, therokinrolla (8.5 x1) calltehshots 

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) lassidoggy 

[All Scores](https://pastebin.com/V4BbxzA5)

---

##The Way We Are

**kanyewestrep** (9): Barbara Streisand is a real one

**calltehshots** (8.5): I gave this an 8 before but I'll bump it up a bit because Barbara really did step on necks with this, just a bit.

**julry** (8): Queen Barbra

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Well, things haven't changed with this one, either; I'm still bitter at Barbra for outpeaking Glory. All things considered, though, this is still a perfectly decent ballad, which means that I'll be giving it a perfectly decent score.

**SupremeShani** (8): This is Barbra Streisand at her peak, a gorgeous song that does a good job of capturing a feeling of nostalgia.

**zamomattel** (8): Barbra's voice is otherworldly

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): [DISCUSSION] Was 'woman with vocals' the 'white guy with guitars' of the 70s?

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I forget what I scored this in the other rate. At least I can clearly hear what Barbra is singing. It's a very beautiful song, but it's nothing too memorable IMO.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7): The strings and keyboard take off a few points for me; they just make it too cheesy. Amazing voice though!

##The Way We Aren't

**stansymash** (6.8): duck sauce >

**shineflyer** (6): Oh, Barbra. Queen of melodramatic 70s cheese. This is the better of the Barbra tracks on this list.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): ngl these 1930s songs are ok but they're indistinguishable from one another

**ignitethephoenix** (4): Oh this is Babs? I’m am very underwhelmed by this.

**LazyDayLullaby** (4): I prefer my cheese on a platter

**Mudkip1** (3): the first thirty seconds were pure humming asmr

**lassidoggy** (1): Barbra is trash

##Our Favorite Comment In The Entire Rate

Piccprincess: # [#29: Wind Beneath My Wings](https://i.imgur.com/DPIJ1y5.png)

---

**Average:** 6.490 **// Total Points:** 376.4 **// Controversy:** 1.913

---

One of the few artists with multiple songs in this rate, Bette Midler’s rendition of Jeff Silbar and Larry Henley’s Wind Beneath My Wings did much better than her other track. This iconic bop is actually the most played song at British funerals. How they measured that, I don’t know, but there you go.

##Kid Icarus

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok major bop

**fifthchevron** (8): DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU'RE MY HERRRROOOOOO?

**julry** (8): bette midler is an underrated queen

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): We're back to traditional diva ballads now. There's nothing I can say here that I haven't said already, but I think the 'did I ever tell you you're my hero?' part shines more than the part of the chorus that actually drops the title.

**SupremeShani** (8): The lyrics are way too dramatic for my tastes, but I guess that just comes with power ballads like this. Bette Midler's vocals are godly here, the part where she sings "fly" kills me every time. It seems like there are thousands of depressing memories with this song.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): Is it appropriate to sing this instead of tipping for good service?

**snidelaughter** (7): Solid vocal performance that elevates this song from okay to good

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): aaaaaand we're back to the formula. I don't really mind it at this point though because the previous ones were so bad that this feels refreshing.

##Those Dumb Monkeys From The Wizard of Oz

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): it sounds vaguely motivational

**rickikardashian** (6.5): the first verse is literally “thanks for letting me be the star xoxo”

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6): Her best song is still the one from Hocus Pocus tbh.

**stansymash** (5.1): horse sound

**Raykel** (5): I thought this song was 7 minutes long after it was over, but I checked back and it's not even 5 minutes long what

**zamomattel** (4.5): the verses are piss poor and the chorus is slightly worse than I remember

**DraculaWeekend** (4): I'm sorry but I can't explain why I hate this song so much.

**LuckyKidA** (4): 5th grade graduation song lol.

**twat\_brained** (3.3): Bette Midler is a great singer. I'm not denying that. She is NOT great at picking songs that work well for her. Especially that "FLYYYYYYYYYYYY" part. I don't wanna hear this again.

**calltehshots** (3): No wonder this is a popular song at funerals because it also makes me want to die.

**shineflyer** (3): I guess it's heartfelt? But uhhhhh Bette Midler's not a good singer.

Bruno Mars is shaking. Billy Joel is responsible for recording and writing this song, which ended up being his first real hit and track to chart in the top 10 on the US Billboard charts. It’s not one of my favorite Billy Joel songs, but it’s nice. Some quaint saxophones grace the track, and we get classic Billy Joel vocals, and for some that’s enough, but for others, it’s woefully underwhelming.

##Don't Change A Thing

**dirdbub** (10): leskeddit

**jamesfog** (10): wug

**mustangs16** (10): i'm basically a billy joel stan tbh

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.5): 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I love this song, it has a good relaxed vibe to it. Also a certain song has taught me to appreciate a good saxophone.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): This is good, but I feel like there are songs similar to this that are better tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s a bit sappy, but it’s a still a good song! The sax in this song is great and makes it so much better.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): One of the better Billy Joel songs

**zamomattel** (7.5): billy joel has such a good voice and even though this isn't necessarily my favourite song by him, I still enjoy it

**agentofscranton** (7): a lot of the songs pre-1980 were hard to rate purely for the reason that I just didn’t have an opinion on them – they were aggressively inoffensive

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): A sweet song, but Bully Joel has done far better, and if I'm going to be honest, Bruno's song is much more fun to listen to. This is one of those crossover staples I hear a lot, and while it's one of the more tolerable ones, it's not something I'd listen to again, at all.

##Change Everything About It

**stansymash** (6.5): uptown girl? whats wrong with uptown girl? why couldnt we have just picked good ol' uptown girl. now thats a song. this song? no. its like if uptown girl was boring and completely different. if this was uptown girl it would be a 10

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): the sax on RAWM was better

**Leixander** (5): nothing really special about this song

**shineflyer** (3): One of my least liked Billy Joel songs. It's a really muddy electric piano tone.

**fifthchevron** (1): Who the fuck voted this as song of the year? It's basic as hell.

##Bruno Joel

**sletrab07** (9): Bruno Mars found stripped, whipped and slaughtered in a ditch

**calltehshots** (8): Bruno Mars and the RAWME saxophone are trembling.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Bruno Mars who? I actually really like the instrumental here. I also stumbled on a Mac DeMarco cover of this song which was a nice surprise.

**twat\_brained** (7): Cute but both Carly and Wham! outsax'd and Bruno did it better. How'd this beat "Stayin' Alive"?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): Bruno Mars did it much better.

**awryj** (5.5): bruno outsold

This country track, written by Johnny Christopher, Mark James, and Wayne Carson, was recorded by many famous musicians, including Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, and Pet Shop Boys. The Willie Nelson version is the one that won the song of the year Grammy, Seems like most people here either liked it, or felt indifferent, and as a result, it’s scored at number 27 in this rate.

##Stuck In My Head

**kanyewestrep** (10): I'm giving this song a very high score because I'm a fan of Willie Nelson

**mustangs16** (10): as a texan i reserve the right to fight anyone who gives this a bad score!!!

**snidelaughter** (8.5): I'm a sucker for good country and good covers, not surprised I enjoy this

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): aw.

**dirdbub** (7): me at my crush :honk:

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7): I know Willie Nelson's a legendary musician but I've just always known him as the weed guy lol. Kind of a boring song but his voice sounds good!

**SupremeShani** (7): The song is surprisingly soothing to listen to, and Willie Nelson does a good job balancing talking and singing to capture that storytelling feel.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): Maybe I just don't listen to enough Willie Nelson, but I did not expect this kind of ballad from him.

**julry** (6): kind of a classic

##Forget You

**twat\_brained** (6): Eh, better this than "Ebony and Ivory", I suppose.

**stansymash** (5.5): its fucking hilarious how his name is willy. WILLY

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Okay, Grammys, I'm already sick of ballads. Please, please, please, don't just give me a ballad sung by some dude that looks like a hybrid between a neckbeard and a hippie and has a Texan accent. That's...just cruel. At least I remembered this one upon first listen, unlike Sailing...

**zamomattel** (4.5): I guess this is cute BUT it is deeply uninteresting

##Concentrating On Covers

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): HIS VOICE IS SO SOULFUL AND SMOOTH pet shop boys did it better tho

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Lovely. Pet Shop Boys did it a bit better

**awryj** (7): ive grown up knowing the pet shop boys version of this song and its so weird listening to the original

**fifthchevron** (7): Great but I prefer the Elvis version.

**shineflyer** (6.5): Willie's not got a great voice. The song itself is a classic though, honestly one of the best of all time. But, then, this is just yet another cover of it. And not one of the better ones.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): Great song, just not this version

This unforgettable track probably proved to be anything but. Originally written by Irving Gordon, the most popular version is Nat King Cole’s original recorded version. This version, however, is a duet done by Natalie Cole, and her father, Nat King Cole. There’s been a ton of covers of this track, but this is the one that won the Grammy.

##Memorable

**Leixander** (11): Simply perfect.

**awryj** (10): This song is the definition of "smooth".

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Absolutely gorgeous.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song's great, but how was something from the 50's eligible for SOTY in 1992? I could understand ROTY, but the song was not written or originally released during the eligibility period.

**calltehshots** (8.5): Just smooth and lovely like a nice wine.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Nat King Cole is unforgettable

**SupremeShani** (8): It's so sweet that they managed to win a Grammy for this beautiful duet.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I'd call this the Boyhood of music where it's a really cool idea what they did and the song is objectively good, but if I didn't know why this is amazing, this song wouldn't be amazing.

**poppinmmolly** (7): Thomas Rhett did it better

##Forgettable

**stansymash** (6.8): sure jan

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): vaguely nostalgic but i can't place it

**shineflyer** (5): Nat King Cole, aka The Voice of Christmas, has the warmest voice. Natalie's okay.

**therokinrolla** (4): this song was forgettable

**mustangs16** (3): i literally fell asleep

**DrunkHurricane** (2): this is one of those boring unremarkable 60's songs, yet it got a Grammy in the 90's after everyone should have been over that style of music...

**GlialUreterostenosis** (2): Out of context, this song is beautiful. But there's something overwhelming creepy about duetting with a dead singer without their consent, even if that singer is your father. The awkwardly-spliced in footage of him in the Grammy performance is a predecessor to holographic Tupac.

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): I hate the original song this is based on. The latest version of the Pop Essentials post made me listen to Nat King Cole's album and I was nearly asleep upon finishing it. Adding the daughter's voice to the dead guy's voice seems sweet and all, but really, it doesn't help matters. A overrated 50s song being adapted in the 90s just does not make a good Song of the Year.

##Nat Sremmurd

**fifthchevron** (10): french montana is shaking

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): would greatly benefit from a Swae Lee hook.

**twat\_brained** (5.8): Awww, a daddy/daughter duet! If only the song title wasn't so poorly chosen. Where's French Montana and Swae Lee when you need them? Sidenote: I listened to this after "Daughters". I'm not sure what to feel.

This Bruce Springsteen track was recorded for Philadelphia, a 1993 drama that was one of the first major Hollywood films to deal with HIV/AIDS. The song from the movie was released a year later and went on to win not only a song of the year Grammy, but also a Grammy for Best Rock Song, Best Rock Vocal Performance, and Best Song Written Specifcally for a Motion Picture or Television (what a wordy award name). It’s a somber and haunting track, and it comes in at about the halfway point in this rate at number 25.

##Old City

**agentofscranton** (10): this is the first time I’m ever hearing a springsteen song and honestly, he’s pretty damn good

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Idk a lot of Springsteen music but everything about this song is good! It's all very 90's but in a good way.

**shineflyer** (10): This is probably gonna get robbed, but I've loved this song since I heard it. The synths are great, I really enjoy the depressing, introspective tone the song sets for a slowly dying man.

**theburningundead** (10): I had completely forgotten that this song existed but it is definitely my most unexpected favourite from this rate, I absolutely love it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): heck, I gotta check out Bruce Springsteen's music now.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This gets a bit too lowkey at times, but it's a haunting, sombre song that makes me glad that I was born after the AIDS epidemic. Bruce Springsteen, who has always been a stellar ally to the LGBT community, gives a top-notch performance along with morbidly gorgeous poetry for lyrics. Perhaps one of the most underrated Grammy winners of all time.

**fifthchevron** (8): Never heard this before but wow, it's so striking and different for him

**snidelaughter** (8): Funnily enough, this beat out two Lion King songs, and those two are my exception to not liking the non-film versions because Elton John is amazing.

**SupremeShani** (7): I'm not the greatest fan of Bruce Springsteen, but the song is good and I like the more subtle approach in terms of production where other artists might gone for the more dramatic route.

##Badlands

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Is it just me or are a lot of the 90s songs in this rate from movies?

**stansymash** (6.5): bruce is a talented man but i still don't feel anything

**calltehshots** (5): I mean it's fine but it's also too monotone and I'm can feel myself drifting off listening to this...and not in a good way.

**zamomattel** (5): the instrumental sounds like White Flag by Dido

**twat\_brained** (4.9): In what universe is this a) nominated, b) a winner over "Circle of Life" and c) has all the honor and praise that **BORN IN THE USA** should have received? This was the last song I listened to for this rate. I really wish it would've been "We Are Young" instead.

**johnazoidberg-** (4): Worth noting - this beat out TWO songs from The Lion King and the only explanation I can think of is that it was Bruce Springsteen

##Silver Screen

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.4): Good movie, too

**ignitethephoenix** (6): This just makes me want to watch the movie Philadelphia, since I still haven’t seen that movie yet. The song is alright though, it’s well written but just underwhelming.

Written by Eric Clapton and Will Jennings, like many tracks in this rate, it is a soundtrack song. However, although it is a song scored for a movie, it is also about Eric Clapton’s late son, who passed away at the far-too-young age of four years old in a tragic accident. It’s a really disheartening and powerful track with a sad background story, and here it is at number 24.

##:sad:

**fifthchevron** (10): Rest in Peace, Conor.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is one of the saddest songs ever if you know the backstory behind it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): "I'll take songs that popheads will rob because they don't know the story behind it for $400, Alex."

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Surprisingly simple for a man who's widely considered to be one of the best guitar players of all time, this is a song that everybody and their mother knows the backstory to, and its popularity makes it no less heartbreaking. I'm not a fan of Clapton at all but you'd be a heartless monster to deny the fact that this makes you shed at least a few tears.

**snidelaughter** (10): Easily the most heartbreaking song on here. There are very few popular songs that talk positively about religion that aren't trite, and this is the gold standard for those few songs that don't suck.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): :(

**julry** (8): Not Clapton's best song but I'm glad he has a SOTY

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Impossible to listen to without reflecting on the awful, painful back story

**mustangs16** (8): i'm not a huge fan of this song? but i'd feel like an asshole for giving it a lower score than this?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song is heartbreaking if you read the inspiration behind it. Not the biggest fan of man + guitar sings but this one is touching.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): this claps.

**zamomattel** (7.5): this is a lovely song

##:emofish:

**twat\_brained** (6.6): I can't imagine how tragic it is to lose a child, especially at such a young age, but I think "Beauty and the Beast" would've won if there was no pity vote.

**SupremeShani** (6): The lyrics are bittersweet and beautifully written, but I don't find much of this song memorable at all.

**Mudkip1** (5): this didn't deserve to be so long

**shineflyer** (4.5): It's super sad and all, but like... a triangle? Really?

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): eric pls press all the way down on the guitar strings next time thanks

**awryj** (3): Welp, another song I don't like.

**stansymash** (2): watchmojo told me that this was the saddest song of all time so i guess i'm crying now? it didnt make me sad but apparently this is just how it works.

This upbeat, funky track is probably the fastest track in the rate until Bette Davis Eyes, and it’s also one of the best. From the wild synths to the wonderful vocal performance here, it’s a fun, somewhat catchy track, and man, those synths. They’re great. Seriously. It seems most of you agree with me, as this song has very few scores under a 5.

##Geniuses

**calltehshots** (11): Wow, a classic BOP. This deadass is one of my favorite songs of all time. The melody, the vocals, the lyrics. If this doesn't well in this rate, popheads is truly tasteless (but this is already confirmed by other rates that didn't have Slumber Party winning.)

**stansymash** (11): music began in 1980. music peaked in 1980. this is a pop rock legendary track that i have 100% confidence has won this rate, and everybody else has given their 11s. this is why 'doobie' has become such an important name in music history. when you hear this track you immediately wish you too were a doobie brother. the instrumentation is sublime. the vocals are pretty good i guess. a perfect song deserving of its inevitable victory. (i havent actually heard any other doobie brothers songs but they have a 100% batting average so i'm gonna assume theyre perfect) **[(Editor's Note)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/357312449000767490/404051538802114580/SG-OSGwFR8On_QWHEoLy3w.png)** 

**milkywayinradius** (10): falsetto where you don't know what they are saying in the chorus but still groove to the song

**twat\_brained** (9.2): A FUNKY, UPTEMPO SONG?! AND IT'S ACTUALLY **GOOD?!** Man, oh, man how we desperately need more of these in this rate. Anyway, my hot take of the rate is that this deservedly beat "I Will Survive". As iconic and legendary as Gloria Gaynor's OG "New Rules" is, this hooks you in right from the beginning and doesn't let you go, whereas IWS takes time before going off. Hot take this deserved to win

**fifthchevron** (9): Well that was a funky moment.

**shineflyer** (9): I don't even care what y'all are gonna say, this is a bop. That piano, that bass, that rhythm section.

**snidelaughter** (8.5): I have never heard of this song nor this band but this singer could narrate an entire day of C-SPAN and I'd be invested

**berober04** (8): loving the thomas the tank engine toots in the background

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I was surprised by how much I liked this. Coincidentally, this is the second song on this rate that I found a Mac DeMarco cover for, so that was exciting. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Ugh, when will this sappy 70s/early 80s shit end? At least this one is more upbeat than the rest, but everything just blends together and I can't make out specific parts other than the last part of the chorus, which is admittedly quite beautiful.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Wow I can’t believe it took until 1980 for a SOTY to be more of a bop than a snooze fest. So props to these guys.

**SupremeShani** (7): I don't really care for the vocals or lyrics, but that synth is super catchy and the production is interesting its time.

##Fools

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.7): I really like the song/vocals, but the production is kind of annoying.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): wish the rest of the song was as iconic as the opening notes are for any commercials

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): i'm sorry but what kind of name is "the doobie brothers" also i'm mildly disappointed they didn't all change their names a la the ramones

**Mudkip1** (5): this is a bop but also i would never ever listen to this agian

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): the song just ended and I truly have no idea what it sounds like.

This E S S E N T I A L coffee shop hit scalped me and my indie brewed mocha latte (with a sprinkle of nutmeg)! A slow, but wonderfully cozy jazzy pop track, Don’t Know Why is actually a cover of a song originally written by Jesse Harris in 1999. It’s her only hit single in the US and her only song to hit the top 40, and it only peaked at 30, but changed coffee shops around the world forever.

##You Know Why

**poppinmmolly** (11): this is such a chill song. It reminds me of my childhood. Omg I love it so much.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I absolutely loved Norah's debut album when it came out, and this song is no exception. There is a softness to it that works so well. Also, I think this song/album was released at just the right time. I don't know if it would have been such a hit if it came out today.

**julry** (10): I LOVE NORAH. This is a jazzy bop.

**milkywayinradius** (10): Who didn't sing this song in their early teens on Karaoke Revolution (now available on Playstation 2)

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9): I don't think I could listen to a whole Norah Jones album without falling asleep, but this is cute.

**twat\_brained** (8): "I felt like I went to somebody else's birthday party and I ate all their cake. Without anybody else getting a piece." In other words, Avril Lavigne deserved a piece of that cake. There's nothing wrong with it, but that's just as much of a weakness as it is a strength. It's too safe, unlike "Complicated" or even "A Thousand Miles". All this to say that I actually like Norah, but I just "don't know why" "Complicated", a RATE WINNER, didn't win SOTY.

**calltehshots** (7): Yo this biiiiiiiiiiitch. God every mom in 2003 stanned her. Anyway, this song is alright. It's harmless. Cute.

**SupremeShani** (7): I always enjoyed hearing her softer vocals and productions, this song is extremely smooth and flows really well.

**awryj** (6.5): Well... It's nothing special, but it's sweet and nice, basically tea commercial music.

**shineflyer** (6): Sweet, gentle, and jazzy. It doesn't grab your attention, but honestly, it doesn't really need to. It's a song that's happy being background music.

##You Don't Know Why

**Raykel** (5.5): Her voice is beautiful, but it's the only notable thing in this song.

**johnazoidberg-** (5): I refuse to believe this peaked at 30 because this song was fucking everywhere when it came out, and I will never understand why because it's lowkey pretty boring

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): I also don't know why this won.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (3): another snoozefest

**fifthchevron** (2): It's a cute bop but I never understood the hype then and I still don't now.

IT’S A QUARTER AFTER ONE, I’M ALL ALONE AND I NEED YOU NOW! This 6x platinum, five week country chart-topping, radio-dominant smash became the most downloaded country song ever, ending popheads fave Taylor Swift (probably until Cruise came out) and solidifying pop country as a tour de force to be reckoned with. It’s a serious country bop and I can’t count the number of times I sang along to this on the radio on the way home.

##I Need You

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Such an emotional song. I remember when this was first coming out and how I would raise the radio whenever it would come on and sing with all the emotional depth a 12 year old could sing with. Probably could be considered the first country song I really liked, but it never got worse over time. It's such a great and emotional song that's easily Lady Antebellum's best work and a song im glad was able to be such a huge hit, and is the highest peaking country song of the past 7 years.

**Mudkip1** (10): only the best country bop ever made! love this song to death

**mustangs16** (10): one of the best country songs of the last decade, which, unfortunately, is not saying a lot about the state of country music these days

**TragicKingdom1** (10): A deserved country crossover. Really this is one of those songs that's just so good I think everyone should be able to find at least a part of it they can connect to.

**twat\_brained** (10): This, "Not Ready To Make Nice", "Daddy Lessons" and "Man! I Feel Like A Woman" are all examples of country songs done right. Why can't all country be like those songs? Especially this? Also, I never noticed the phone call at the beginning of the song. It adds the perfect pretext to the song. I regret deleting this from my iTunes purchases.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.3): Omg I forgot about this song! Their harmonies are great.

**therokinrolla** (9): omg this is country ish so it will get robbed but omg good

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This is one of those view country songs I think most people who don’t like country much (me) still really like.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): This song is my guilty pleasure, and I still enjoy listening to it even though at some point every artist in the industry thought it was a good idea to grace us with another cover of it.

**rickikardashian** (8): my only reference for country music is taylor swift pre-1989 and carrie underwood, and this sound like it could be sang by both, so :woot:

**shineflyer** (7): Now that I finally haven't heard this song everyday for some time now, I can say it's actually pretty good.

##I Don't Need You

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): the hook is pleasant but I'll be fine if I never listen to it again.

**johnazoidberg-** (6): This song beating out Fuck You can only be explained by racism, sorry.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): this would've been excusable about 30 years ago

**fifthchevron** (5): LMAO must've been a slow ass year.

**zamomattel** (5): this is kind of annoying but cute I guess

**awryj** (4): Haven't heard this song in like 6 years... I think. It's not very memorable.

**stansymash** (2.5): no way that these people have personalities

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): This song means nothing to me. I'm serious. Every time this comes on radio I just switch to another station.

**Raykel** (1): To me the lyrics aren't that great to warrant a Song of the Year Grammy, I'm not a fan of the vocals, and the instrumentation annoys me.

##1/4 After 1

**calltehshots** (9.5): This song is me, quarter after 1, drunk as hell thinking about pizza tbh.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): "It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I NEEEED YOU NOWWW." Bleh.

**LazyDayLullaby** (4): It's a quarter after one, this song isn't great so I rate it low

The last song in this rate, last year’s winner, is not the last song to be eliminated in this rate. Coming in at number 20, say hello to Hello. Written by Adele and Greg Kurstin, the song was an absolute cultural phenomenon and sales behemoth, debuting at number one in the Billboard Hot 100 and staying there for 10 weeks. It was also the champ for most views in a 24-hour span, with 27.7 million views, and claimed the award until Taylor Swift’s snake anthem Look What You Made Me Do usurped the throne last year. Alongside a song of the year Grammy, Hello also received a Grammy for Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.

##Hi

**dirdbub** (10): this song is a statement of clout

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Hello it me

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I live for how overdramatic this song is; I would love to be her standing in the wind with a fur coat.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): It’s hard to follow up the success of 21, but this song did that. THAT chorus did that. This song definitely brings out the best of Adele and I think like her other songs will definitely stand the test of time.?

**Leixander** (10): hi

**Mudkip1** (10): the best song to be released in the last 100 years. adele really did that

**rickikardashian** (10): I hate Adele. She always releases this dramatic ass songs with high notes that I can’t hit, and i end up making a fool of myself while showering and doing a 45 minute concert, without any note being hit correctly. This is why I stan Selena Gomez

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I love you mom.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Obviously a powerhouse of a song, the 2nd chorus --> bridge --> 3rd chorus is unreal with the dramatic swell. I wish it had stronger percussion and a stronger 2nd verse, though.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): An iconic song. Everyone knows the greatness that is the phrase "HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIIIIIIIIIIIIDE"

**SupremeShani** (8): This isn't even anywhere near my favorite Adele songs, but the opening is memorable and the chorus is so fun to sing along to.

**stansymash** (7.9): hoo boy she sure can sing words can't she. man oh man

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): Hello? Is it me you're looking for?

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): adele is just clean lana for moms tbh

**calltehshots** (7): Hey sis.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): 'What does she have to do to win Album of the Year?' Okay, now that I've said that quote, this is way less interesting than Rolling in the Deep. It's still a good song, but I'm not eager to listen to it until the very end, when Adele's vocals reach their peak. This isn't a 'hello', nor a 'goodbye'. It's just more of a 'oh, you again?' Eric Clapton Curse V3.

##Bye

**shineflyer** (7): goodbye

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): I don't think a big pop chorus works for this song, even if Adele sings it beautifully. It doesn't develop the narrative told in the verses, and it doesn't provide emotional catharsis because "Hello" is about a lack of closure.

**therokinrolla** (6.5): one of the most overplayed songs of all time is hurt further by the fact that this is 5 minutes long. Yiksies.

**milkywayinradius** (6): It's no rolling in the deep

**mustangs16** (6): it's sort of amazing how huge this song was and how you never hear it anywhere anymore tbh

**awryj** (5.5): By far the blandest single of hers

**zamomattel** (5.5): the smash on this album should have been when we were young, but people have bad taste

**sletrab07** (5): Goodbye

**fifthchevron** (4): Like it's epic and all but it's Adele by the numbers, song of the year should be groundbreaking imo. It's funny though the first few songs at the top of the list were all slow, epic love songs like this, like the Grammys have gone full circle with the past three wins. There's also nothing nominated next year that deserves it the way these songs did.

**kanyewestrep** (3): Dusty ass song, 25 is trash, I've heard all those songs from her before...

**PendulumThief** (3): How did Adele manage to take 4 years to follow up 21 with a bunch of boring b-cuts from said album

##This Comment

**twat\_brained** (10): "Hello. It's me. I was wondering if after this year you would like to speak. To go over… SOTY. They said Beyonce was supposed to sweep but she ain't done much sweeping. 

HELLO FROM THE BEYHIIIIIIIIIIVE

I MUST'VE TWEETED A THOUSAND TIMES 

(only like twice lol) 

TO TELL YOU

YOU'RE STUPID

FOR LETTING FORMATION LOSE

AND DON'T TELL ME

THOSE FORECASTS

WERE ONLY A SILLY RUSE"

All in all, I'm glad "Hello" won over "Love Yourself" and "7 Years" and deservedly so but "Formation" deserved it more. Also, it just came to my attention that I've heard all but one of the last 6 SOTYs live. I've even heard a few of them twice!

**Average:** 7.409 **// Total Points:** 429.7 **// Controversy:** 1.678

This folk rock track written by Shawn Colvin and John Leventhal was a shock to many, and is one of those late 90s tracks that you feel like you’ve never heard until the chorus hits, and then you’re like OH MY GOD YES. And for many of you, it seemed to be a surprise hit, doing better than songs like Hello and Need You Know, which is pretty shocking to me. I’ll take it though, because this song bops and I love it so.

##Sunny

**lassidoggy** (11): A beautiful, haunting piece. A moment. Sunny is the queen of arson.

**agentofscranton** (10): i’m handing out 10s like participation ribbons but honestly a lot of these songs, though hearing them for the first time, are entirely justifying why they won soty

**letsallpoo** (10): what the fuck this is so good where did this come from wtf

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): The token folk rock song in the 90s part of this rate is brilliant, blending atmospheres of mystery, nostalgia, and melancholy effortlessly. Another underrated Grammy winner, that's for sure. Just what happened to Sunny?

**calltehshots** (9): Um I really like this. I was wondering how this song who's title I didn't recognize beat 1998 powerhouses but once the hook hit, I was all in sis.

**shineflyer** (9): The best song about setting fire to your own house. I also always appreciate when I, as a baritone, can sing in the same range as a female vocalist.

**awryj** (8): This is mom rock and I love it

**twat\_brained** (7.3): The banjo is a cute touch but my biggest problem with this song is that the artist's first name is Shawn but their last name isn't Mendes. Yes. Bigger than the fact that it beat "Don't Speak".

**stansymash** (7.1): hey the pitchfork rate 2 is coming in like june next year or something idk but give your 11s to round and round or robyn or something

##Cloudy

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.8): She sings about setting her house on fire the way Jewel sings about making herself breakfast.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): This song isn't terrible but was it really worthy of SOTY?

**zamomattel** (6.5): I'm lowkey mad this beat Don't Speak but I think it's fairly good

**ImADudeDuh** (6): learning the backstory made me raise a point

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): ugh it's like we're going back in time after that Seal song. no progression whatsoever.

**snidelaughter** (5): I have no strong feelings about this song one way or the other. I get that it's well written and well composed, but I just can't get into it. I don't know why.

**SupremeShani** (4.5): This song has such a nineties vibe to it. I always love a song that tells a story, but besides that I don't like much about this apart from the bridge and parts of the chorus.

##Protect Ya Neck

**johnazoidberg-** (10): Please calm down. The music and everything, everything. It's nice that, uh, I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money today, you know what I mean? 'Cause I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win. I don't know how y'all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children. You know what I mean? Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best. Okay? I want you all to know that this is ODB, and I love you all. Peace!

It’s almost like with the first second of the track, the dancefloor explodes. Written by Chistopher Stewart, The-Dream, Kuk Harrell, and Beyoncé, it’s one of the best-selling songs of all time, and it’s one of her biggest, if not her biggest hit. It’s probably the danciest track to ever win a song of the year Grammy (unless you’re out there bopping to Send In The Clowns, and if you are, by all means enjoy yourself). Regardless of whether it was your 11 or your 0, you’ve heard it and you have a strong opinion on it.

##Taken

**milkywayinradius** (11): Can't listen to this song without thinking of the dance and MV, it's so good that everyone knows the hand flip move

**BreezySeason** (10): I once danced to this drunkenly at a flat christmas party so it is forever in my heart

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Not even my favorite Beyonce song but this is still so good.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I know some people are going to make jokes about Bey getting an award for songwriting, but I feel like we can definitely assume she at least wrote the lyric about Dereon jeans lol.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): I've heard this song has one of the greatest videos of all time

**snidelaughter** (10): Probably her best song from her worst album. It's Beyoncé, she's essentially Queen Midas.

**kanyewestrep** (9): I only found out about Beyonce through Jay-Z back in '08 if I'm honest...

**Mudkip1** (9): a gay anthem

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): deserved to win Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. (Not sure it deserved this Grammy though bc Poker Face and Use Somebody are better songs).

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): It’s a catchy, fun and memorable song. This song definitely is one of these defining songs of the 2000’s too. However I feel like Beyoncé has way stronger songs than this.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): Compared to the rest of Beyonce's work, this song is nowhere near my favorite, but I won't deny the production is on point and the outfit and dance in the music video are iconic at this point.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Gets the job done succinctly and ever so danceably

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The breakaway success of this song is weird considering how disappointing Sasha Fierce was as a whole, and I think I prefer Halo to this by a lot. It's still iconic, but it's an iconic I was born too early yet too late for. Also, I'm waiting for the Kanye memes.

**zamomattel** (7): as a BeyBitch I enjoy this song, although the production is horrific

##Single

**Leixander** (6): Has an amazing video but the song itself? Nah, not that good.

**ImADudeDuh** (5.5): Honestly one of my least favorite beyonce singles.

**fifthchevron** (5): She's had far superior songs before and since. Kanye must've been happy with this win tho.

**twat\_brained** (5): Say what you will about the video, but the song itself is quite overrated. "Poker Face" is one of the greatest songs of the 2000s and should be in this rate instead of "Single Ladies".

**shineflyer** (4): I'm not a fan of most of the choices in this song. Except for the presence of Beyoncé, that's always a pretty good choice.

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): The beat on this really sucks! Lyrics are good tho

**calltehshots** (1): I don't know if this is a controversial opinion but this is easily Beyonce's worst song to me. The video and the dance is literally the only thing good about it. It's just annoying. The beat is like a sound from a horror film. For a song that's being like "hey we're single women woo yay!!", the lyrics are soooooo salty and bitter about being single. This song makes my skin crawl.

Piccprincess: # [#17: We Are Young](https://i.imgur.com/PGYt2yP.png)

**Average:** 7.640 **// Total Points:** 443.1 **// Controversy:** 2.442

---

Give me a second, I need to get my story straight: We Are Young didn’t even make day 3! This iconic, wig-snatching rock pop (more pop than rock) car commercial-spawned track clocks in at number 17. It’s energetic, instantly recognizable, and probably annoying to as many as it is electric. It’s mostly chorus, and it’s almost shocking that it wasn’t the band’s only hit (although it was by far their biggest). It’s kinda tragic that Fun. never put out another album, but it gave us the producing powerhouse that is Jack Antonoff, so I’ll take that.

##Fun.

**rickikardashian** (11): God, this song is just so perfect. It’s one of the best produced songs I’ve heard, and it’s very well written. When you listen to it you get the feeling you have when you’re fucked up, like feeling everything in slow-mo and just wanting to keep going. Just pure pop perfection

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): idk what it is about this song but it is just unforgettable and lovable and I will never stop loving it and singing it at the top of my lungs. not only that but I feel like it also paved the way for many other non-traditional songs to become successful and yeah, I just like it a lot. I hope popheads doesn't kill in day 2 like it does with most of my 11s.

**twat\_brained** (11): I just got hit with an absolute wave of nostalgia and I am covered in goosebumps. Call it recency bias, call it me appeasing one of the mods, call it what you want (by Taylor) but after hearing this again after so many years, and rediscovering just how great this song is, it made me yearn for a time I didn't even know I yearned for. "We Are Young" is just so powerful and anthemic that I can't see myself emotionally investing my 11 into another song on this rate.

**berober04** (10): I love this song. I've seen them live, got the T-Shirt, everything. Some Nights would have been my 11 if I could choose a fun. song though

**theburningundead** (10): For me this will always be one of the quintessential Glee anthems, makes me a bit sad and nostalgic whenever I hear it

**TragicKingdom1** (10): I used to like Some Nights more, but in hindsight that song is slightly hokey. This has a super strong melody and sounds fresh 6 years later.

**julry** (9): I liked this, then I hated it for a while, but it’s been a couple years and now I definitely like it. Go Janelle.

**Raykel** (9): I love this song but yeah that maybe-domestic-abuse line aged poorly and distracts me every time.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): Pretty irresistible. Anthemic and soaring. I love songs that slow down for the chorus

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Good song, but Janelle Monae is severely underused it in.

##Unfun.

**stansymash** (6.7): we didn't even know back then

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): I love Janelle and I enjoyed Nate's work with The Format , but I don't think this song holds up that well.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): The fact that the song changes its flow so many times is wild, but it manages to pull it off with charm. The chorus is incredibly fun to sing along to, but something about it feels dated in a bad way to me.

**calltehshots** (6): Glad Janelle Monae got a check for this.

**dirdbub** (5.5): "The A Team" and "Call Me Maybe" deserved better

**fifthchevron** (5): I had no idea this won. Let's be real this is a chorus, not a song.

**awryj** (2): +1 point for janelle

**johnazoidberg-** (0): This song was annoyingly overplayed the first time I heard it. The fact that this beat out Call Me motherfucking Maybe cements it as my zero. This song was a mistake. Jack Antonoff makes some great music, and I'm glad he got this trash out of his system, but holy crap does this song need to die.

##Best Mod.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Their first album is better but this is a perfect song (especially because it gave Queen/Mod Janelle a #1).

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Nothing but respect for MY Oscar winning mod!

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): i can absolutely get behind melomaker and best mod

**Mudkip1** (8): only the best subreddit mod

**shineflyer** (6.5): I was never big on this song, but it's well-made. And our very own Janelle Monáe gets like, two lines in, so

Piccprincess: # [#16: Bette Davis Eyes](https://i.imgur.com/I919teo.png)

---

**Average:** 7.647 **// Total Points:** 443.5 **// Controversy:** 1.964

---

Just barely missing the third day, we close day 2 with a song that’s been in another rate before, the Billboard #1s rate. Fortunately, it fared much better here, coming in at number 16. It’s an early 80s track for sure, and it’s probably one of the better tracks of that time, with a sweeping instrumental, some rough but fitting vocals, and one of the catchiest choruses in the rate. For the record, Bette Davis liked the song and was flattered to be eternalized in this bop of a track.

##:Eyes:

**awryj** (11): This song was PAID DUST last time. C'mon popheads, get in formation and get it to top 10. This is a synthpop classic.

**agentofscranton** (10): absolutely definitive of the 1980s and so reminiscent of my childhood – this was my 11 in the billboard #1s rate and is definitely a contender for it again here

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): I'm hoping people will have realized how good this song actually is and hopefully not cut it before the last day (then again this a rate so I'm not expecting much)

**jamesfog** (10): This is a pop master class. People do the absolute most on her voice.

**lassidoggy** (10): ICONIC

**shineflyer** (10): I don't really have words for this one. The synths, the clappy snare beat that comes in during the second verse, and Kim's raspy, flirty delivery all come together in this one.

**SupremeShani** (10): I absolutely love this song, Kim Carnes's vocals have the perfect amount of rasp in them, that synth riff is so memorable, the song taught me who Bette Davis was, I see no flaws.

**johnazoidberg-** (9): It's weird how covers keep winning, right? Like, this song is from 1974, it just didn't get popular until Kim Carnes sang it, but that makes this song from 1974 the best song from 1981? The Grammys just don't make sense. IT's like a wookie living on Ednor with all the Ewoks!

**zamomattel** (9): I just want to writhe around on the floor to this song

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): her voice creaky af but i love it

**calltehshots** (8): "She's pure as New York snow" is one of my favorite lyrics of all time. But her Rod Stewart-esque delivery brings a 10 song to a 8.

**stansymash** (8): i rated this song low in the billboard rate but hearing something upbeat has made me feel whole again

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): For some reason I always thought this was by Bonnie Tyler. In any case, this song's good, but 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' is better

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I go back and forth between liking Kim Carnes's rough, husky voice and thinking that it's trash. The song itself is a relief, coming after a long line of ballads. It's mysterious, sexy, and tantalising, and it would have continued being an anthem past the 80s if it wasn't less divisive for Carnes alone.

##Eyes Closed

**Raykel** (6.5): She sounds like she needs some water.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.3): Not bad, but not great. This feels like it would play during an 80's rom-com when the main characters have their first kiss. Also, I can't get past the extreme raspiness.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): All I can hear is "eyessssssssss"

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): it is a song.

**Leixander** (5): i really don't like her vocals

**snidelaughter** (4.5): I just don't get the modern appeal outside of the raspy vocals, maybe it was provocative at the time but honestly it feels aged with how it undersells everything

**therokinrolla** (4): still sounds like a cigarette addict

**twat\_brained** (4): I hatejerked this song too much in leaf's rate and I realize now that it's not all that terrible. Kim just can't sing to save her life. Maybe if pitch correction existed in the '80s this could've been redeemed.

**DrunkHurricane** (3): this woman's voice is awful

##Taylor Swift Eyes

**fifthchevron** (10): Timeless classic bop, for some reason I always picture Taylor Swift as the woman being described ("All the boys think she's a spy" hello!) She should cover this omg. **[(Editor's Note)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZNETmBSW3E)** 

**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop. Tay does a great cover of this.
