**Average:** 7.716 **// Total Points:** 447.5 **// Controversy:** 2.033

---

Our second and final U2 song is the first song of today. Scoring way higher than I thought any U2 song would score, Beautiful Day is the epitome of what makes U2 tick. It’s ethereal, optimistic, and it’s just, well, beautiful. However, with a controversy score of 2.033 it seems like not everyone agreed. Some popheads found this track boring, along with the rest of U2’s discography. You may have taken U2 out of this rate, but Bono is laughing all the way to the bank with the billions of dollars he earned on tour.

##Day

**agentofscranton** (10): this is the epitome of modern dad-rock, I should know considering my dad used to play it all the time when I was younger – and as a result this song became one of my favourites, and at least to me and my friends/family this is like the ultimate road trip song

**awryj** (10): say what you want about u2 but i love this song

**dirdbub** (10): this song is a defining moment of my childhood

**fifthchevron** (10): We're at the turn of the century when all these 80s/90s stars randomly had huge comeback hits out of nowhere. My favourite memory of this track is an Australian music channel doing a whole fanvid mashup of other videos set to this song.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I love everything about this song. It just feels euphoric.

**julry** (10): U2 in their prime

**shineflyer** (10): I used to adore this song growing up. And it's still pretty damn good and atmospheric. Will get robbed, though, because it's 2018 now and no one gives a fuck about U2.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The instrumentals in this song are great, especially during the chorus. I love how intense and grand the song gets in that part.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Oh. This song is so 00s and so British that I don't know what to say. What I will say is that it makes a great start to this century. (The 21st century began in 2001 and not 2000. I'm saying this because Time Magazine reported that the last person born in the 19th century died in the middle 2017, and I was pissed, because there were still two more people who were born in 1900 at the time, one of which is still alive at the time of writing. But, eh, this is r/popheads, not r/historyheads.)

**calltehshots** (7.5): I never really cared for this song and found it annoying as a kid but I saw U2 live this summer at Bonnaroo and hearing this song and screaming this song at the top of my lungs, drunk, with best friends and complete strangers like emotionally moved me? it's still kind of crap but I appreciate it more lol.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): I've never cared much about U2 (will I ever, who knows) but this song is pretty nice.

##Night

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I heard this song sooo much when it came out that I just can't really enjoy it anymore.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): Grammy voters sure as hell love U2 because this is in no way better than Say My Name

**snidelaughter** (6): This won over Say My Name? Really? It's completely okay but I'm baffled how U2 can secure Grammy's over a decade outside of their prime.

**zamomattel** (5): this is cute. but beating Say My Name???? Disrespectful

**twat\_brained** (4.3): I was gonna give this a 10 but midway through I realized how "girly" it was so I decided against it :kisskiss: Also, it's a crying shame that the one SOTY Beyonce deserved the most got taken away from her by some pretentious rock douchebags.

**johnazoidberg-** (3): This song is just boring. U2 might be the most overrated band of all time, and their bullshit is the reason I buy Android phones. Hey Grammy voters, look me in the eye and tell me this is a better song than Say My Name. Because holy shit Say My Name should have won.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (2): U2

##You Too

**stansymash** (7.1): is bono even like a real person or just like frozen dad juice in a human shape

**Average:** 7.788 **// Total Points:** 451.7 **// Controversy:** 2.285

---

Why are there so many movie tracks on here? Anyway, A Whole New World is THAT movie track, and the Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle cover was used for the Disney movie Aladdin. The original song was composed by Alan Menkin and written by Tim Rice. I can’t lie and say I disagree about the Menkin version being better, but that’s besides the point. It’s a godforsaken bop, and I’m glad it managed to make it this far into the rate.

##Brave New World

**calltehshots** (10): I am wigless that this has a well deserved Grammy. I need A Whole New Wig.

**dirdbub** (10): one of the many, many songs where I can't stop thinking about Robin Williams whenever I hear it :'(

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): If you say you don't love to sing this song you're lying.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): To be honest I was hoping for the movie version, but this is still the greatest thing a anybody named Peabo has ever done. I mean, it's Aladdin, the movie that taught me that all you have to do to get the girl is lie about how much money you have. It's incredible

**mustangs16** (10): this is my ringtone for my bff lmao

**poppinmmolly** (10): the song of the year when I was born!!

**SupremeShani** (10): This song is literally perfect and I don't care what anyone says, even if I have no idea what the hell a red letter is to this day.

**therokinrolla** (10): one of my favs songs ever <3

**zamomattel** (9.5): one of the best songs, BUT I prefer the soundtrack version

**julry** (9): ALADDIN GRAMMY?? HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS??

**stansymash** (9): man i did not expect this to agressively be one of the best songs here

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Aladdin and Jasmine did it better. That version feels more magical, and as great as these singers sound, I just prefer the movie version (probably due to nostalgia). Still a great song though.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.1): One of the best Disney songs, great harmonies and vocal interplay

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a step down from the original, just more oversinging.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): ngl Aladdin kinda thicque.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Disney Animated Canon songs rate when

##The World's End

**fifthchevron** (7): Circle of Life is better

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): LITERALLY MANDOPOP

**Raykel** (6): I hope no one rates this thinking it's the version in the movie cause wow talk about taking away the magic. They make it so extra for no reason.

**snidelaughter** (6): The film version is one of my favorite Disney songs, but I've never been fond of the non-film version of most of these songs. This is too ballad-y for my liking, but the base song is amazing enough on its own that I can deal with how overwrought this gets.

**agentofscranton** (5): aladdin and jasmine outpeaked

**sletrab07** (5): This is… not a good version of the best Disney song.

**awryj** (4): the original version is better

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Alan Menken, sweetie, I'm so sorry. They took an amazing song with an iconic gay Filipino icon in it and made it into this crock of shit. This is way worse than Beauty and the Beast. I'm only giving it a score that isn't completely terrible out of respect for the original composition. Seriously, can showtunes/soundtracks not win Song of the Year or something?

**twat\_brained** (3): WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO TO THE ORIGINAL?! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE INSULT TO WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS AND THE LEGACY OF THEIR '90S FILMOGRAPHY. Okay, it's not awful but it's at least 146 times worse than the movie version; where's the chemistry? Where's the magic that the Disney film brings? Where's the rush of excitement I get from listening to this? It's all lost in this rework. Then again, looking at the other nominees that year, it's not like there was anything good in the first place.

**shineflyer** (0): The epitome of "Holy fuck, why did they make another version of this song, I want to die." I'm so glad this inspirational-romantic-duet-for-movies thing is a dying breed. You can get all you need to know about this song from a 10-second clip of it.

**Average:** 7.816 **// Total Points:** 453.3 **// Controversy:** 2.477

---

In the wonderful words of Pitchfork, “it’s amazing [that] this is the first time she was a teenager for how good she was at it.” And Royals, for all intents and purposes, is a fantastic portrayal of what it means to be a teenager, for better or worse. “In a torn up town, no post envy,” she muses, and that is a summation of what this song embraces. It’s anti-materialism, anti-fame, and anti-pop music. And, in the pursuit of something different and rebellious, she managed to top the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks. So, where do you go from there? We all know where she went, but this was the song that started it all. It’s minimalist, strikingly so, and it was unlike anything on the radio at the time. It may be your least favorite Lorde song, your favorite song in the rate, but whoever you are, you cannot deny its impact.

##Hard Feelings

**AFlyingWhale\_** (11): i remember hearing Royals in 2014, it felt very empty and i didn't like the beat. but Royals was my first exposure to the Lorde and i remember liking Team before making the connection like woah they're the same person?? and now Pure Heroine is the single most important album to me. Royals is instantly relatable for the 99% of us who aren't living it up. Even though it's flawed - it's partly Ella's criticism of hip-hop culture, or rather her then-conception of hip-hop culture - it's still a great song.

**PendulumThief** (11): I tried giving the eleven to someone else but it was causing me physical pain

**dirdbub** (10): think about it this way: it was either this or "Roar"

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Queen of having a diamond debut single that also won multiple Grammys.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): "Royals is so overrated!" well no shit, it was number 1 for 8 weeks, of course in an album with only one other top 10 song it's gonna be overrated. It's not like radios were clamoring to play something like Million Dollar Bills or A World Alone.

**rickikardashian** (10): Im almost the age Lorde was when she won a grammy and got a #1 song,and i honestly can say i feel like crap because im really not doing shit with my life

**stansymash** (10): i first heard this song at a bowling alley as i bowled straight into a gutter. my friends laughed at me.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Still holds up 4 years later. I know a lot of people don't like it because it's more mainstream than Lorde's other stuff but I still feel like anything she touches is on a higher tier than the majority of the rest of pop music, and especially what generally gets recognized by the Grammys.

**twat\_brained** (10): Let's put this into perspective: Ella recorded this when she was 15, it went #1 when she was 16, she won TWO Grammys for it at 17, and had it certified diamond in the U.S. a month after turning 21. While many consider this one of the weaker songs in Ella's discography, it's the one that made me fall in love with her. I hope this is at least top 15.

**Raykel** (9.5): I think we all know this isn't Lorde's best song, but hearing it along side the songs next to it makes me so thankful it exists.

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I love this song for introducing me to Lorde, even if it is a little weaker compared to the rest of Pure Heroine. It still is incredible how she managed to build such a catchy song with that minimalist production and seeing that style influence many artists years later.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): looking back on it, it is pretty fucking edgy, but it's such a bop that frankly I don't care.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Every time I hear a Lorde song, I just think about how good of a song writer she is for someone her age. The fact she was 16 when this came out blows my mind.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): In the 5 years since "Bad Romance", pop music had gotten so outlandish and so decadent that literal joke songs like The Fox and #SELFIE were hitting the top 40. With "Royals", Lorde calmly waltzed in into the party, turned off the stereo, and told everyone to go home. Kesha and Miley fled pop for country; Halsey and Alessia Cara owe her royalty checks, #vibes has replaced maximalism. For better or worse, "Royals" is the most important song of the 2010s.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): See, I think that Lorde's statement in Royals is actually a good one to make, because the glorification of wealth in pop music is lowkey disturbing. But coming from a white teenager in New Zealand, her criticism feels noticeably incomplete. In some ways, it's an anthem, but in other ways, it does come off as quite obnoxious. What can I say, though? The entire selling point of Pure Heroine was being a teenager, and for her age, Lorde did that really well.

**calltehshots** (7): I could not stand this song at all when it was huge - I found it so eye-rolly but Lorde was 16 lol. It's grown on me. The minimal production works really well.

**fifthchevron** (7): YAS LORDE holy shit imagine winning song of the year at 16 with your first song! Having said that I never liked this song much lol.

**shineflyer** (7): queen of minimalism. It's not much, but it's a small jam.

##Loveless

**therokinrolla** (7): one of lorde’s worst songs. Im glad she got a grammy tho

**zamomattel** (7): I think this song is good, but Lorde continually has put out better

**DrunkHurricane** (3.5): this song is way overrated. Honestly, the instrumental is so empty and the melody is so boring that I have zero idea what the hell people see in it.

**kanyewestrep** (2): Worst song off the album...

**mustangs16** (0): before everyone starts screaming SABOTAGE, i've never liked this song OR lorde's music, so

##A Story

**awryj** (8): The first time I heard Royals was at my friend's house. He wanted to show me this cool game called Euro Truck Simulator (it turned out that it was an actual European truck simulator). It was truly riveting. I was about to fall asleep when I heard this weird song on the in-game radio. Of course I didn't tell him about it (ugh, a pop song, what are you, gay??? he stanned linkin park though so its not like he wasn't guilty either), and then I had to look it up on the internet. So, yeah, whenever I hear Royals, I think of trucks.

**Average:** 7.909 **// Total Points:** 458.7 **// Controversy:** 2.154

The oldest remaining song in the rate, Simon & Garfunkel’s beautiful Bridge Over Troubled Water comes in at number 12. It’s super iconic, considered one of the greatest songs of all time, and with good reason. It has a breathtaking climax, the type that makes you think, wow, this is music, and this matters. It’s powerful, and most popheads agreed, with this track getting a ton of acclaim and nearly bringing us to the 8+ average territory, which is a threshold we will overcome with the next track.

##Low Tide

**julry** (11): fucking timeless

**LazyDayLullaby** (11): Truly great. It reaches such incredible heights. When the vocals, piano, and violins all climb to a stunning peak, it's just beautiful

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I gave this a 10 in the Billboard rate and I haven't changed my opinion on it. I'm autistic, so some sections in songs give me sensory overload, which can either be extremely pleasant to my ear or extremely torturous. It goes without saying that Bridge Over Troubled Water's climax fits into the former category. The first time I heard it, I legitimately gasped. This easily deserves my first perfect score.

**Raykel** (11): Beautiful. This is how you make a slow tempo song sound interesting. Nice melody with a small but satisfying climax at the end.

**agentofscranton** (10): once that fucking crescendo comes, the song slaps you in the face, rubs onions in your eyes and reminds you of every single horrendous thing that’s ever happened in your life, but also simultaneously caresses your face and tells you everything’s going to be okay with a kiss on your forehead

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Really beautiful, and I love how delicate Garfunkel's voice is when he starts over just the piano, but he continues to get stronger throughout the song.

**snidelaughter** (10): that Lady Gaga gif of her praising something is how I feel

**stansymash** (10): that last chord is better than your entire life. you suck compared to that chord.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I love my original sadboiis.

**awryj** (8.5): I remember giving it an 11 in the Billboard rate... I must've been really depressed. The song is still pretty though

**fifthchevron** (8): I wonder how many popheads are hearing this CLASSIC for the first time

**SupremeShani** (8): I am more familiar with Aretha's version, but this song is still a classic. Absolutely love the instrumentals here, but I'm not a huge fan of Garfunkel's vocals at the end.

**shineflyer** (7): The first of these that stands the test of time. It's nice to just hear Paul's naturally gentle voice over piano.

##High Tide

**johnazoidberg-** (6.5): I've long felt that this is one of the most overrated songs of all time. And looking at the other nominess that year, I'd rather be listening to Fire and Rain or Let It Be. That being said, this is easily the best song out of the first 4 in this rate. This is one which, while I've never been a fan, I understand the argument. I can see how somebody would call this the song of the year. Plus Simon and Garfunklefrinklefrankle are legends.

**twat\_brained** (6.4): I forgot that I listened to it in the other rate. Did I even listen to it? I don't remember. I still won't remember it after this rate probably. Still pretty good though

**LuckyKidA** (5.8): Honestly one of my least favorite S&G songs.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): his voice is tolerable and the writing is ok

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Just not that good. If this were live, I feel like it would have more of an impact, but the studio version just does nothing,

**lassidoggy** (2): i hated it on the last rate and guess what? i hate it STILL

##A Bridge Inside My Troubled Water

**dirdbub** (10): I would let Simon & Garfunkel do anything to me. anything. literally anyhgthing

**Average:** 8.029 **// Total Points:** 465.7 **// Controversy:** 1.752

The last song before we reach the top 10 is the absolute megabop that is mid-80s perfection. Written by Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, it’s Tina Turner’s most iconic hit, and with good reason. It’s a snappy track with a bombastic chorus that absolutely makes the track, and is complete with a [pseudo-harmonica](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/classic-tracks-tina-turner-whats-love-got-do-it) that is just so fitting. It’s a wonderful track, and although it just misses the top 10, it did rather well this rate.

##What's Talent Got To Do With It

**calltehshots** (10): Who does need a heart, Tina?! Not me, queen!!! A masterpiece.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Tina did THAT.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A classic, one of the best chorus in all the 80's

**jamesfog** (10): Legend

**SupremeShani** (10): This gave me flashbacks to Shangela's Snatch Game. Tina Turner is hands down one of my favorite artists though and this song is simply one of her best.

**twat\_brained** (10): Ah, yes. A feminist anthem from the Whitney of the '70s/early '80s. A powerful and emotional tune which fully deserved to win, and deserves to go top 10 in the rate.

**zamomattel** (10): OBSESSED with Tina, would be 11 if it was Private Dancer

**snidelaughter** (9.5): Amazing ballad.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Going to be honest, I'm slightly disappointed about this one. Is this a great song? Yes, but Tina's vocals here aren't really too my taste. They crack too much, IMO. However, make no mistake, the entire Private Dancer era was awesome, and I'm all for appreciating how iconic it and this song were back in the day.

**therokinrolla** (8.5): omg a bop

**awryj** (8): its a bop and its a fact

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Love the key change in the song!

**julry** (8): yaaaas Tina

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Great chorus

**Raykel** (8): This song is used as a joke a lot but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's good.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): an iconic bop.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): Fantastic vocal performance, bland instrumental

##What's Tina Got To Do With It

**stansymash** (6.8): i thought tina turner was supposed to be fun

**fifthchevron** (6): Relatable but eh...

**Mudkip1** (5): this wasn't as good as i had remembered

**shineflyer** (3): Tina is a really good singer. But this song is really sparse, and only accentuates how dated it is. And not charmingly dated, either.

BAAAAAABYYYYYYY! A song on the Batman Forever soundtrack, Seal’s Kiss from a Rose is the 10th highest rated song in this rate, unlike Batman Forever, which is not the 10th highest rated Batman movie (are there even 10 Batman movies). Kiss from a Rose is a cinematic song, one that is ridiculous but so ridiculous you can’t help but sing along. It’s a wild ride, and I’m glad to see it show up this close to the number one track.

##The Petals

**agentofscranton** (10): the ultimate karaoke song #sixseasonsandamovie

**fifthchevron** (10): Flawless classic, Selena could never record a song this lyrically unusual

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Wow I forgot how great this song is! The vocals, the production, and Seal’s acappella parts. The chorus is the best part though; there’s so much passion and drama and I love it.

**Leixander** (10): chilling, show-stopping, amazing, beautiful, my goosebumps have transcended into outer space and reached Andromeda galaxy

**Mudkip1** (10): this is such an iconic song lmao!! the lyrics are so funny since the entire thing makes literally no sense at all. my english professor last year had this whole spiel about this song showing us how weird it was and how the whole thing was just language fluff but the world just latched on and loved it regardless.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This gives some dad rock vibes, and it's so 90s in the same way Iris is, but I can't help but be won over by that epic chorus. If old people have to continue stanning power ballads in the future, I hope this one'll be in the centre of their hearts.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.6): One of my favourites from the list, just fantastic

**stansymash** (9.6): this is melodramatic and over the top in just the right ways. god i love this. [another song that community made for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUYGRxRCCoc)

**calltehshots** (9.5): A Batman bop. We stan a song about cocaine, Can't Feel My Face is shaking.

**awryj** (8.8): This is the first time I listened to the whole song and it's actually pretty great??? I am shockt

**shineflyer** (8): This is cheesy as all fuck, but I must kind of listen to it ironically, because in my heart this is a banger.

**SupremeShani** (8): I love the use of Seal's vocals in this, and song has beautiful instrumental breaks.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): https://imgur.com/gallery/tuulpgK

**twat\_brained** (7.1): Up until this year I would've never believed for a second that the man who made this was the same man who made "Video Killed The Radio Star" and was a Yes alum. Also, this is one of those instances where the production is better than the actual vocals, so this loses points from me. Sidenote: why wasn't this passed onto Celine Dion? It would've been perfect for *Titanic* seeing as how Jack gets a kiss from a Rose. 🤣:tasha:

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7): I can't think of anything to say, so...Fun Fact: Seal has been a coach on three seasons of The Voice Australia.

##The Thorns

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): tbh I prefer Dean Pelton and Jeff Winger's version of this song from Community

**Raykel** (6): Opens with very obvious distinct Seal voices harmonizing and scatting "All of these voices are Seal." Lmao!!

**sletrab07** (5): I can’t tell if this song was memed into continued relevancy or not, but I just don’t care for it.

**DrunkHurricane** (3): these lyrics make zero sense

**julry** (1): No.

##The Batman

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This song is so good it was worth the Batsuit getting nipples.

**LuckyKidA** (10): BATMAN FOREVER

**snidelaughter** (10): Seal is the only artist that could convincingly sell this song both as his own and for a Batman soundtrack. It fucking bangs.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): What's with 90s artists and giving their best material to shitty movies? Did you know that "Are You That Somebody" was a Dr. Doolittle tie-in? Or that "Ghetto Supastar" was for Bullworth of all things? Did you know Joel Schumacher directed the video for this?

**zamomattel** (8.5): I love this song but idk why it's in a superhero film

**Average:** 8.060 **// Total Points:** 467.5 **// Controversy:** 1.446

---

Written by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel, Killing Me Softly with His Song was one of those songs that came dressed to impress. Roberta Flack first performed this track while on tour opening for Marvin Gaye. After she played it for the first time, Marvin Gaye came out and said not to perform that song live again until it was recorded. And it was a hit, spending five non-consecutive weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the second Roberta Flack song on the list to win a song of the year Grammy.

##Killing The Rate Softly

**snidelaughter** (11): Beautiful song responsible for the greatest reinterpretation of a song in modern music. Amazing.

**calltehshots** (10): Instant 10. This song is a perfection. A masterpiece. I astral project and see god when I hear this beautiful bop and god's face was Roberta Flack's.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Roberta's reworking of this song is magical (the original is a lot more folksy and doesn't have a beat). I would've given the Fugees' version an 11 tho

**jamesfog** (10): Legendary

**SupremeShani** (9.5): The opening for this song is literally iconic to me, overall a great song and Flack's voice, the electric piano, and the guitar are heavenly here.

**fifthchevron** (9): YAAAS such a beautiful hook/song in general.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): This rate turned me into a Roberta Flack stan. kween

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Major bop. I will say, the fugees did improve the song tho.

**Mudkip1** (9): cute jam

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Roberta Flack winning the Song of the Year Twice is certainly impressive, and no doubt this track is better than the previous one. Carrying a catchy melody despite being relatively slow, this is one song I'd love to hear somebody like Lana Del Ray cover.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): fugees version is better but still a sad bop

**awryj** (8.8): I really like this song, probably because I've known this cover since I was a little kid. It's basically the sequel to the original song, and it's definitely darker than the Roberta Flack version. The lyrics tell the story of the woman who is now tormented by the song, she says that it's outright evil and it will send her straight to hell. I guess Europe has always been a bit more metal than America

**Leixander** (8.5): OHHH KILLING ME SOFTLY-wait wrong song

**therokinrolla** (8.5): this is moody i like it

**rickikardashian** (7.3): this is a safe bop, my wig doesnt feel threatened, and im at peace

**DrunkHurricane** (7): the better Roberta Flack song, simply because it actually sounds like a song

##Killing My Happiness Softly

**stansymash** (6.8): there sure are a lot of female fronted slow ballads on this list and this sure is one of them

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): this is what we would get if we took Adele and took away any sort of excitement that comes with her music.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): wait she did it a second time wow

##Killing The Original Version Softly

**agentofscranton** (10): I prefer the Fugees’ cover but this is just as amazing in it’s own way

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Although the Fugees' version is really good, you can't deny that this is a classic

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Roberta's reworking of this song is magical (the original is a lot more folksy and doesn't have a beat). I would've given the Fugees' version an 11 tho

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.4): Another timeless tune, it kills me. I slightly prefer the Fugees version, but both are great

**twat\_brained** (9.1): Is this the first song to have multiple covers of it win multiple Grammys? I'd love to know the trivia behind that. Anyway, I listened to Lori's version, and I have to deduce that Roberta's cover not only does the original justice; it actually exceeds it. Not by a huge margin but an exceedance nonetheless. Listening to the Fugees cover, I notice there's something worth appreciating in each version; the haunting acoustics in Lori's rendition, the grandiosity of Roberta's recording, and the R&B/hip-hop interweaving of the Fugees version. This may be a bold statement, but I think "Killing Me Softly" is the most versatile song in this rate. (sorry bout the assay)

**zamomattel** (8): the Fugees version would get a 10

**shineflyer** (7.5): Fugees who? I really love the transition from verse into the chorus.

**johnazoidberg-** (7): The Fugees did it better, but this is still the best song in the rate so far. But for real, Fugees, come back.

**julry** (7): Idk how I feel about Roberta winning all these Grammys on covers. Lauryn Hill's version 4 lyfe!

**lassidoggy** (6): Roberta Flack is more boring than I thought she was. Thank god for Lauryn Hill

##Basically Every Comment Is About Titanic

**fifthchevron** (11): I don't give a fuck, the only thing bigger than the movie that year was the theme song for the movie. 2000s kids have never seen hype like Titanic hype, I swear at one point nearly every TV commercial referenced Titanic somehow. Every time this song came on the radio, my mum and I had to go see the movie again haha I think we saw it 12 times.

**calltehshots** (10): My wig will go OFF. I'm so happy to have been alive in 1999 even as a child to fully experience this songs impact. Some people hated it and those people don't deserve ears. The climax at the end?! A vocal legend.

**dirdbub** (10): a slutdrop anthem

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Iconic. If this isn't Top 5 I will be shocked.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Queen Celiné did that! The key change is EVERYTHING and the build up to that is so good. This is the ultimate power ballad and it is perfection.

**Leixander** (10): the flute part of this… changed lives and created so many memes. Thanks Celine!

**letsallpoo** (10): more like my heart will go OFF YAAAASS CELINE

**Mudkip1** (10): an inspiring anthem

**poppinmmolly** (10): iconique sad bop

**rickikardashian** (10): [**JACK DID FUCKING FIT IN THE MOTHERFUCKING DOOR, ROSE, YOU LET YOUR MAN DIE YOU FAKE BITCH**](https://i.imgflip.com/1npzvg.jpg)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): one of the best vocal performances of all time and one of the best ballads of all time thank you very much.

**zamomattel** (10): ICONIC I mean that last chorus where she just belts it really did invent songs and years

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Alright, I absolutely hated listening to Celine's album for the Canadian rate and I dislike her, agreeing with Todd in the Shadows's criticism of her music: divas like Mariah belt out as if they genuinely love singing, while Celine acts as if recording and performing her hits are jobs for her record label. This, however, is a rare song of hers I genuinely enjoy, despite its overplay. No, I never intend to see Titantic, and, yes, this is one of those songs that I was born too late to remember, but, hey, maybe that helps my impressions of it.

**shineflyer** (9): This should by all means be too cheesy to be enjoyed, and yet, here we are. This song is great, I don't even care.

**SupremeShani** (9): I was going to give this a lower score because I thought I was sick of hearing it, but those damn flutes got to me. I forgot how easily Celine transitions from fragile and vulnerable at the start to complete powerhouse by the end.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.8): Again, don't act like you don't sing along with this.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): If you ever bust out Cards Against Humanity then play the "pennywhistle" card. It's definitely an underrated one. Also, I'm not sure if the rash of memes associated with this song has harmed or aided its legacy throughout the years. If this gets rated higher than *Falling Into You*'s average I will do whatever the comment with the most upvotes says.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): It's a formidable performance, but I'll never forgive it for beating Elliott Smith at the Oscars

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): this is one of those songs that's impossible to avoid

##My Rate Will Go On

**johnazoidberg-** (7): I absolutely H A T E D this song when I was a kid because it was everywhere. I culdn't escape it. It was all-ding-dang-present. Now that I'm listening to it with fresh ears - after the 2 minutes it takes to get started and the minute and a half after that it takes to get really good, this is a pretty beauitful love song.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): There's an alternate universe where Titanic never came out and this song became a highkey gay anthem because nobody associated it with ROSE! and JACK! and ROSE! and JACK! and JACK! and JACK!

**mustangs16** (5): i have to be honest, i expect this song to win, and that's fine; but i literally HATE titanic, like, i consider it "one of the worst movies i have ever seen" kind of hate, so i cannot in good conscience give this a higher score

**snidelaughter** (3.5): I don't like Celine Dion's voice. I don't like how cheesy this song is. The flute's nice, though, and post key change the song picks up like crazy. Honestly, I'd probably give the song a 6 if it sounded like the key change throughout. It's a 1 without it, though.

**julry** (3): yeah yeah whatever

**sletrab07** (2.5): [Lana voice] Noooooooooope.

**stansymash** (2): [*waving lighter in the air*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WH8mHJnhM)

##Honey The Titanic Sunk Like A Century Ago

Wow, I can’t believe The Police invented new wave! Every Breath You Take is THAT stalker bop, and everything from the glorious instrumental to the bombastic [middle-eight](https://genius.com/2853576) makes for one of the most iconic songs of the 80s. It’s aged like fine wine, and although it’s dated, it doesn’t show its age. And popheads seems to agree as this 80s bop ran full stop all the way to number 7 in this rate.

##Good Cop

**agentofscranton** (10): that guitar riff gets me hard every time

**CrispyEggs123** (10): We love a good creepy stalker anthem

**jamesfog** (10): C'mon stalker anthem

**PendulumThief** (10): Why did it take me so long to realise this was about a creepy ass stalker

**snidelaughter** (10): There's not much I can say, it's the original stalker anthem, and for that alone it deserves props (although beating Billie Jean is kinda odd)

**calltehshots** (9.5): We stan a emotionally abusive stalker bop.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song has one of the most iconic bass lines out there and makes the song really memorable. The only issue with this song is how creepy the lyrics but everything else regarding the song is amazing.

**zamomattel** (9.5): where's Puff Daddy

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9): It's catchy, but I still don't understand why people use a song about a stalker at proms and weddings though?

**kanyewestrep** (9): watch your back lol

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): it's probably the best song ever written about being a fucking psycho.

**stansymash** (8.2): this song actually sounds like people were interested in making it

**DraculaWeekend** (8): The lyrics are kind of creepy but I can't deny this song is a classic. Love that bass line.

**fifthchevron** (8): Here's the non-creepy version.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A bop but a creepy song.

**johnazoidberg-** (8): Weird how this song about an obsessive stalker is remembered as a love song, huh?

**julry** (8): I pretend to hate this song, but actually I love it

**shineflyer** (8): So, do I rate this as a love song, or the stalker song it was intended as? Either way, its got emotion to it.

**awryj** (7): I've heard this song a thousand times so it's tempting to give it a very bad score just because of the overplay but tbh it's pretty clever in its creepiness

##Bad Cop

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I gave this a higher score in the Billboard rate, but unfortunately, I don't like it as much as I use to. The stalking element is creepy, for sure, though at the very least there exist alternate interpretations of it. My main problem with this track, however, is how much I dislike Sting's voice, as well as how 'dad-rocky' the entire mood it sets is. I will say that the bridge near the end of the song is brilliant.

**rickikardashian** (6.8): This beat Michael Jackson, twice, and Maniac. It aint even that good

**SupremeShani** (6.5): Even though it's being pointed out so many times how creepy this song, I can't help but view it as a romantic love song. I like the guitar in this, and the rest of the instruments are pretty stellar as well.

**twat\_brained** (6.4): I like this song better now than when I did the other rate but it doesn't deserve to go #14 like it did last time. Or even higher, for that matter. It still glorifies stalking and still is vastly overrated.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): and we hate po-po, wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho

**therokinrolla** (2): ew

Hating the president may be an olympic sport in 2018, but back in 2006, it was still taboo, an unthinkable feat. That is, unless you were The Dixie Chicks. In the weirdest act of defiant protest besides Seth Rogen’s film The Interview, a comment that Natalie Maines, a Dixie Chick, made regarding Bush’s invasion of Iraq spawned rampant public backlash, resulting in an eventual death threat towards the group. Not Ready to Make Nice addressed this controversy in blatant and unwavering terms, as the group proudly proclaimed that they were “not ready to back down” and “mad as hell.” It was a watershed moment in mid-2000s music and set the stage for pop-oriented activism with songs such as P!nk’s Dear Mr. President to be able to be released. It’s a surprisingly poignant yet bold track that feels about as tactful as a “fuck you” can be.

##Ready To Make Nice

**agentofscranton** (11): yaaasss fucking go off dixie chicks – the audible anger in natalie’s voice makes for easily one of my favourite musical performances of all time

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): There are a few other songs in this rate that I really love, but I was never going to give my 11 to anything but this. This is probably one of the most well-written songs to come out of the 2000's, and it's hard for anyone to not be able to feel the anger and frustration and the rage pouring throughout the song and the lyrics even if they don't know the incident that inspired it (although the background certainly adds an extra punch to the song). The fact the the Dixie Chicks were able to release this song and have it become a hit is one great big fuck you to the public who abandoned them and I love it for that. It also helps that it's just a damn good sounding song.

**shineflyer** (11): I'm SUCH a sucker for harmonies. And it's really cool that their voices blend so well, but each voice is also very distinct. And the lyrics of the second verse are bringing me to tears.

**theburningundead** (11): wtf I love country now

**TragicKingdom1** (11): woke queens, the lyrics are obviously flawless. On top of that, the melody and production are incredibly strong, perfectly capturing their "mad as hell" emotions. I genuinely think this is one of the greatest songs of all time.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): An iconic "fuck you" song.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fucking YES! This song is so fucking powerful. This legitimately might be the only song that when I listen to it today, I legit get goosebumps. The whole second chorus on it's own is enough to be deserving of song of the year. The fucking violin part has me just as emotional as when I first heard it and this song is just fucking amazing.

**julry** (10): LOVE

**Leixander** (10): An amazing song that deserved much more success.

**Mudkip1** (10): the dixie chicks are icons

**poppinmmolly** (10): okay this is a great FUCK THE PRESIDENT song. It's sad that the sub only knows the Dixie Chicks because of this song, though. They are so good. Everyone go listen to "Fly" the album please.

**twat\_brained** (10): 10 10 **10S ACROSS THE BOARD** These girls are so brave for making a political statement during a time when it was considered unwise and thoroughly deserve their Grammy. It is pure poetic justice when at the midway point of the song, the blame is shifted to the bigots who feel they have to send death threats to these girls. Nobody deserves to be killed just because they said something you don't agree with.

**awryj** (9): they snapped

**fifthchevron** (9): The Grammys don't usually reward political rebellion (see: Beyonce), wonder what changed their minds here (see: victimised white women). I do love this song but honestly fuck the grammys. "It turned my whole world around...and I kinda like it" is the goat lyric for waking up to ignorance. You'll never go back no matter how hard it gets.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9): I want the Dixie Chicks to perform this at the Grammys again next year but against a backdrop that says "IMPEACH."

**mustangs16** (9): the thing about this song, though, is that it reminds me just how wrong the American public did Home (which contains their best songs, Long Time Gone and Truth No. 2)

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'm not a huge fan of this because their vocals aren't really all that appealing to me, especially compared to their version of Daddy Lessons, but the context of this one raises it up a lot. The Dixie Chicks are woke queens and this is such a breathtaking, unapologetic middle finger to the conservative backlash against them. When will Ariana release a reply song to Donutgate?

**SupremeShani** (9): I'm probably one of those Popheads users that hates most of country music for no reason, but I will always have a soft spot for the Dixie Chicks.

**berober04** (8.5): that's an extra two points specifically because of that violin

**snidelaughter** (8.5): Solid and personal protest anthem that was a bold risk for a country band to take. I dig it.

**calltehshots** (7.5): The Dixie Chicks leaving conservative country stans shook will never not pull my wig. Political legends.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Interesting to look back on

**stansymash** (6.9): remember the cheetah girls

##There's No Negative Comments So Here's This

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): is this neutral milk hotel

##Not Yet Ready To Make Nice

**letsallpoo** (11): if you dont give this an 8+ you support bush and neo imperliasm

**jamesfog** (10): Ended Bush

**zamomattel** (8): yeah fuck you bush

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): fuck donald trump.

There’s little moments in songs that are just so attached to that song, it’s impossible to imagine them anywhere else. One of these moments is the looping strings in one of Coldplay’s signature hits, Viva la Vida. It’s an undeniably catchy track with a fascinating story, and it features some of Coldplay’s sharpest and finest display of lyrics, and it’s both appealing and unlike anything else on the radio. It’s frankly one of Coldplay’s best, and I’m glad to see it round out the top 5.

##Vida

**ignitethephoenix** (11): One of my favourite Coldplay songs. I love the story telling and perspective of this song; it’s really unique.The production and instrumentals is fantastic too with all the strings, chimes and choirs, and this has allowed the song not to age a day at all. It’s one of the few songs that I loved the first time I heard it, and I still listen to a lot even to this day.

**jamesfog** (11): A masterpiece

**sletrab07** (11): I’m a good little Coldplay stan, plus those timpani/church bells make my dick implode

**agentofscranton** (10): one of Coldplay’s goats

**calltehshots** (10): Possibly Coldplay's best song. A lyrical masterpiece.

**fifthchevron** (10): U2 were SHOOK. Watch the video if you haven't already.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I loved this song so much as a child that in middle school I made it my alarm clock to wake up and then like 4 months ago I saw thing on the Today show that apparently this was the best song to set as your morning alarm clock and I was SHOOK at my good taste. But seriously, this song is fucking amazing and even listening to it today, I'm so shocked and happy that it managed to hit number 1.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I know that this is probably about the French Revolution, but I have a theory that it's actually about an obscure Anglo-Saxon king, Sieghbert of East Anglia. I know y'all are saying 'who?' but bear with me. Seighbert was a guy who didn't like being king. He set up some social services and churches and retired to a monastery. Woke queen, right? Unfortunately, his former subjects pulled him out of the monastery to let him lead in a battle. Seighbert was like 'no way Jose' but his subjects forced him to go and he died refusing to lift a weapon. Sad story, but the lyrics really fit better in this case-the ruler in this story doesn't reign over anything anymore, but he's still alive, yet out in the streets and not in prison, so he couldn't have abdicated in the regular way, nor could he have been ousted. And the religious references fit in with Seighbert's story-'I know Saint Peter won't call my name' is his acknowledgment that he won't die a monk due to the insistence of his subjects. There's no way in hell Coldplay intended this, but it's my headcanon from now on.

**rickikardashian** (10): Coldplay tends to be just fucking boring, but they have some amazing gems in their catalog, and no one can deny that this song is a journey from start to finish

**snidelaughter** (10): Coldplay's magnum opus.

**SupremeShani** (10): I'm usually on and off about Coldplay, but this song is pop perfection, the whole vibe of the song is so magical.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): when will your fave give birth to the millennial whoop?

**zamomattel** (10): we love the drama of this damn song

**shineflyer** (9): This song is nostalgic as fuck. I've overlistened to it, but it's still really, really good.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.9): When was the last time the cello line was the best part of a hit song?

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): One of Coldplay's best. Spritely violins, decent lyrics, and the Midas touch of Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Remember when this was the first song One Direction covered when the live shows started on X Factor? u/rickikardashian if your rate was chosen it definitely would've gotten a 10 from me.

##Muerte

**Mudkip1** (7.5): this got so overplayed lmao but it's still pretty damn good

**kanyewestrep** (7): it's a good song though it's no Lost +

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): I used to like this a lot more but I think 
some of the production choices are questionable and detract from the atmosphere it's trying to create. Sorry /u/strawberryswing1 :emofish:

**awryj** (6): I never liked this song that much. It's really kinda basic... Although the lyrics are beautiful and imaginative, I'll give it that.

**Leixander** (3): A meh song, I will never understand why this song is their most popular one. The chorus is so underwhelming.

##Woahhhhh

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): YESSSS THIS ICONIC SONG there are so many things i love about Viva La Vida. the rich strings add so much body, and the riff rhythm is instantly recognizable. it has the best interlude and the best bridge and the best woOoOOaAaAAH.

Alicia Keys’ debut single was not set to disappoint, with sweeping gospel-influenced vocals, some simple but effective production, and airtight delivery. Sometimes, an artist’s best track is their debut single, and for me, that’s possibly the case here. Fallin’ is near-pop perfection, a breakout hit that did just that, destroying everything in its path. It became one of the best-selling songs of 2001, and here it is, at number 4 in our rate.

##Jumping

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): Still her best song and still one of the best songs ever.

**kanyewestrep** (11): :>

**awryj** (10): Iconic.

**calltehshots** (10): I only realized a couple years ago that Alicia Keys was a stage name. Anyway, what a great first single and while she's obviously still really successful, I don't think she ever lived up to this song.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I remember listening to Alicia's debut album and instantly loving it. Looking back, this song was such a great first single.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Alicia really kills it on this song. Her vocals are great and the instruments and piano are wonderful as well. This really should have won ROTY too, even more so than SOTY.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): Can you believe this was Alicia's first single? One day she just exploded onto the scene with this classic, and she's been a star ever since. This is how you start a damn career.

**milkywayinradius** (10): The piano, the beat, the strings, backup singers, and her voice are all perfect. 10 of 10, would do naked interpretive dance

**SupremeShani** (10): One of Alicia's best songs, her vocals are an outstanding combination of strong and raspy here, and that piano complements her so well.

**twat\_brained** (10): A perfect Grammy-winning choice for the perfect debut single.

**agentofscranton** (9): alicia keys' goat

**fifthchevron** (9): That first "LOVE YA" with the choir, unbelievable. It's hard to imagine now she's struggling for relevancy but Alicia was unstoppable at this stage. The song was a real anomaly on the charts too, everything else was teen pop.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): around the halfway point, the extra voices get kinda distracting tbh

**julry** (9): Damn Alicia. Come back please. I was really into this back in the day.

**zamomattel** (8.5): this was always so hard to sing on singstar, so like well done Alicia

**shineflyer** (8): Harmonies are absolutely on point, a swaying piano line, and damn, LISTEN to those drums. The bridge harmonies are iconic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): probably her second best song. buy 'In Common' on iTunes.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.6): One of those songs I shouldn't try to sing, but do

##Fell

**stansymash** (7): alesha dixon

**mustangs16** (6.5): i associate this song with 9/11, unfortunately

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): it's not even in A minor...

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Outside of Girl on Fire I never enjoyed Alicia Keys. There are impressive vocals here but the chorus neither that pleasant nor that impressionable, and even a more interesting vocalist such as Beyonce wouldn't have helped here, in my sad opinion.

I guess you thought this one would win, right? What more can be said about this track that hasn’t already been immortalized by various threads and comments about this very track? More than 15 million copies sold. 65 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, 7 of those spent at number one. Grammy for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Short Form Music Video. We don’t get songs like this often, Adele has given us a hit that will last until entropy takes this earth in fiery brimstone. This is probably the biggest hit of the 2010s that isn’t called Shape of You, and it’s by far one of the most universally-liked singles of the last decade. Your grandmother likes it, your little cousin likes it, your mailman likes it, your mom loves it. I’m honestly shocked this wasn’t number one, but alas, it wasn’t meant to be. Either way, this song is my personal 11, and for good reason – it’s timeless.

##Rolling In the 11s and 10s

**Mudkip1** (11): so for adele - hello i said it was 'the best song to be released in the last 100 years. adele really did that' but turns out this is actually the best song of the last 100 years. adele actually did do that

**awryj** (10): well she blew that wig off my middle schooler ass back in 2011 and she did it again

**calltehshots** (10): Adele's best bop. She was kicking dicks with this song.

**dirdbub** (10): the only nomination for this year that I would have been mad if they won was "Grenade". however we aren't in that timeline so I am thankful (still wish it was Bon, but it's fine. totally fine)

**DraculaWeekend** (10): "WE COULD HAVE HAD IT ALLLLLLLL" gives me chills. 21 was such a great album.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song really is timeless.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is the definition of legendary. I just love everything about this song. Adele of course is Adele and kills the vocals. The drums and beat is exciting and fits really well with the drama of the song, and it’s just one of those songs you have to belt along too.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): If you can look me in the eye and tell me you've neve tried to belt out this chorus, you're a pretty good liar

**milkywayinradius** (10): I was gonna give this song the 11 but I didn't want popheads to bully me into becoming a stay-at-home mom.

**SupremeShani** (10): There was a time where I thought this song was overplayed and overhyped, but a replay through 21 reminded me otherwise. The production of this song still sounds surprisingly fresh to me today, the lyrics are gold, and Adele nails it with vocals that are equally confident and emotionally vulnerable.

**twat\_brained** (10): Adele may not be the greatest vocalist in this rate but godDAMN does she know how to play to her strengths! It's musical achievements like RITD that will cement Adele's legacy as the all-time greatest millennial musician. I feel like she deserves *far* more credit here than we give her.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.6): you can't help but sing along

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): a classic.

**zamomattel** (9.5): this is undeniably a good song, even if I think there were better songs that year

**Raykel** (9): I haven't played this in a while cause of overplay. I thought I wouldn't like it but it's still a bop!!

**stansymash** (9): i want an adele spoken word album

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.8): This song was played on pretty much every radio station. Near universal appeal, and it's well-earned: explosive song

**fifthchevron** (8): I hated the hype at the time but tbh it really was worth it.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): I heard this song way too much, sadly. Give me 5 more years.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): "Rollin" is a song by Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris. It features vocals from American rapper Future and American singer Khalid. It is the third single from Harris' fifth studio album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 (2017), following "Slide" and "Heatstroke". It was released on 12 May 2017 through Sony Music.

##Rolling In The Dislike

**lassidoggy** (2): OVERRATED

##Rating In The Deep

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is the third time this song's been in a rate. If we rate 21 and rate the Decade End Chart in a few years, we'll be rating it five times. Truly, the Adelepocalypse is in store. Anyway, I'm not a huge fan of Adele as a whole, but I can't understand why people lump this in with her boring songs. She sounds absolutely terrifying here, and it deserves its place as one of the most successful songs of the 2010s. If soccer moms have to play a song over and over I'd clamour for this one.

**rickikardashian** (10): how many times are we going to rate this song?

**TragicKingdom1** (10): tbh we need to rate 21 just to rate this a 4th time

**shineflyer** (8.5): Honey, you already won a rate. Let the mortals have a turn.

Never quite reaching number 1, but coming ever-so close, is the tremendous crossover hit Smooth. Written by Itaal Shur and Rob Thomas, the song is a collaboration between Thomas and the Latin rock band Santana. It’s got a fiery instrumental, a rapid fire flurry of amazingly fitting Rob Thomas vocals, and a ton of charm. As a result, it spent a remarkable 12 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, and became the second most successful song of all time until it was later dethroned by Ed Sheeran. Smooth is a transcendent radio bop, and it’s honestly simultaneously surprising and not surprising it got this far. Just shy of winning the rate, it comes in at number 2.

##Matchbox 20/10

**DraculaWeekend** (11): "Man, it's a hot one." Seriously, what an iconic opening lyric. Something about this song (and even the music video) captures the 90s so well that I can't help but smile every time I listen to it. I genuinely love everything about this song: Rob Thomas' raspy vocals, Santana's signature sound, and the lowkey cheesy but oddly poetic lyrics (come on, "Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa" is great).

**johnazoidberg-** (11): The iconic guitar work of Carlos Slaytana mixes with some of mankind's greatest poetry from the guy who wrote 3 fucking AM to make 4 minutes and 55 seconds of perfection. The way the verses sound like Rob is singing them over a PA system, to then put it down for the prechorus and chorus, it's magic. All the while, one of the greatest guitar players of all time is just subtly melting your face in the background. Then the solo hits, and the his guitar screams out more emotion than Katy Perry has ever been able to put into a song. Give this song your 11, make it real, or else forget about it.

**mustangs16** (11): there were like five other songs i considered for my 11, but this wins. this song was such a huge part of my formative years that it couldn't be anything else. (fun fact, though, i heard this on a classic rock station recently and nearly crashed my car in shock)

**agentofscranton** (10): quite possibly the sexiest song in existence (also TIL this is the same rob thomas who did little wonders and unwell, can’t believe it’s taken me this long)

**fifthchevron** (10): Holy shit I forgot this won song of the year, Carlos Santana is a music GOD. Rob Thomas needs to come back, such a distinctive voice. He'd never done anything remotely sensual before so this probably had people shook (I was 8 so lol)

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Man it's a hot one.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): , YES! Santana king of the latin guitar riff.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Certified bops are finally starting to win the Grammys, and so are non-white folks. I've only heard Maria, Maria before this, but this somehow manages to be even better. The first time I listened to this, I messaged my straight friend 'I want to have sex with a dude in Mexico' (we've been friends for three years, being slightly racist towards each other is a joke at this point' and he replied 'Sure'. I don't know what this means.

**rickikardashian** (10): I probably have listened to this song more than 10 times already, and I first heard it a week ago

**shineflyer** (10): mAN iT's a HOT OnE

**calltehshots** (9.5): I literally cannot hear this song without thinking of the memes. But damn, does this shit go off. Also listen to Santana's bop with the legendary Michelle Branch that should've won this Grammy.

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I never would have imagined a collaboration like this would work so well, I love the Latin vibe Santana brings to it and Rob Thomas's vocals work really well with the production. The only criticism I have is that the lyrics could use some work.

**zamomattel** (9.5): this song makes me want to swing around my non-existent long hair

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This is such a great blend of the early 2000 music and Latin music. The guitar part is iconic and it’s really a fun song.

**julry** (9): SANTANAAAAA

**twat\_brained** (8.9): Let's be honest, the real star of this song is the guitar, who needs Rob Thomas?f I feel like "Unpretty" or even "Livin' La Vida Loca" would've been just as worthy a winner. Speaking of which, you CAN rate "I Want It That Way" in my Y2K Teen Pop Rate which I'm hosting with u/calltehshots this April!

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.8): 1999 really was Santana's year. This song is the gift that keeps on giving

**snidelaughter** (8.5): [The only video necessary to talk about Smooth](https://www.theonion.com/santana-and-rob-thomas-smooth-sweeps-grammy-awards-for-1819595412)

**stansymash** (8.4): Yes Absolutely Thank You

**therokinrolla** (8): this is a song my mom would like

##Santano

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): this isn't the good Santana song and it's also not the good Rob Thomas song. the guitar solo is nice though.

**awryj** (6): This song sounds like a whirring fan, old sweat and 30°C

##Wild Thoughts

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song copied wild thots

**Raykel** (8): I can't tell if preferring this or preferring Wild Thoughts is worse, but I am a fan of both!

Here’s a fun fact: this song wasn’t number one until the last few days of submission, when it surged up and passed a handful of songs. Rolling in the Deep was number one for weeks, and while I love the song and gave it my 11, I think this deserves to win. From the wonderful and lush instrumentation to Amy Winehouse’s masterfully-constructed chorus, it’s hard not to deny this song is deserving of this award (plus Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance). It’s a song that’s shrouded in substance abuse, but it’s a modern Motown smash that seamlessly interweaves themes of love and family dynamics in an organic and compelling way. And all of this is while Winehouse delivers stunning and flawless vocals fit for the vibrant and beautiful instrumental. It’s a worthy winner, and it’s even more sophisticated and poignant in the wake of her tragic and early death. Rehab arrives at the number one spot in this rate, having fought off tough competition, but in the end, the winner was clear.

##A Rate Winner

**SupremeShani** (11): This is one of my favorite Amy Winehouse songs, the chorus is perfection and the entire thing makes great use of Amy's unique voice, shoutout to Mark Ronson for the amazing production as well.

**zamomattel** (11): this is just such a perfectly crafted pop song. It manages to be defiant, desperate, sad, sexy all at the same time without it sounding contrived. CLASSIC

**agentofscranton** (10): effortlessly slick and cool, rehab and it’s accompanying album remain in my top 10 of both songs and albums of all time

**calltehshots** (10): A bit depressing in retrospect but Amy really did make a fun upbeat bop out of being a sad drunk.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): She was so talented and would've made so many more great songs and albums. RIP.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I don’t think this is Amy’s best song, however it’s still a brilliant song from someone who left us too soon.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): You guys already know this song and you already know it's a major bop.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Possibly the last classic mainstream jazz song, Rehab is kind of like Lucky in terms of foreshadowing, but given that Amy actually wrote this, and that said foreshadowing proved to be actually fatal, it hurts even more. Perhaps the most truly sophisticated song to win a Grammy this decade. Rest in peace.

**snidelaughter** (10): It's Amy Winehouse. Like, come on. I don't need to sell you on this.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): not her best song but still so good

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I fucking love this so much and I'm angry that I did not appreciate Amy Winehouse more when she was still alive. what a gem.

**twat\_brained** (10): My favorite member of the 27 Club❤️✝️🕯 Also, a perfect choice for SOTY! You don't see too many of those.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): Incredible song, sultry and infectious. It's haunted by her premature death

**stansymash** (9.5): its so good that this song and album got the attention and love it deserves

**dirdbub** (9): "Hey There Delilah" is definitely more relevant in my life than "Rehab" but I'm not mad that Amy won, she deserved it

**johnazoidberg-** (9): These lyrics about Amy Winehoue refusing to go to rehab have not aged well

**TragicKingdom1** (9): can't wait to see who makes an insensitive joke about Amy's death after this goes out!

**awryj** (8): I've heard this song so many times that it's seriously hard to give it an honest score.

**fifthchevron** (7): Once again fuck the Grammys and anyone else who bopped to this instead of hearing what she was saying.

##The Only Negative Comment

**shineflyer** (5.5): I've never liked Amy Winehouse as much as everyone seems to. She's obviously talented, but idk. Just isn't my thing.

##Thank You

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): lana
