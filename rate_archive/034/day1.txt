[RATE REVEAL] Grammy Song of the Year Rate Day 1: Hello, It's Me
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7rl0uw/rate_reveal_grammy_song_of_the_year_rate_day_1/

I was wondering if after all these weeks you'd like to meet  
To go over all the flops  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But you won't be doing much healing  

___
Hello Hello Hello! Welcome to the Grammy Song of the Year Rate Reveal! If you've forgotten us already, here we are, your hosts [/u/piccprincess, /u/ThatParanoidPenguin, and Tubbs!](https://giphy.com/gifs/xULW8OrRbU2FLeFbZm) 

We will be starting the reveal in about one hour from this post, at **4 pm EST!!** You can either hang out in here, [come in to to our plug room](https://plug.dj/popheads), or both!

___
A few facts before we get started:

* A total of **58** people submit scores for this rate! Some of these comments are absolutely to die for, and we had plenty of elite shitposters submit. Hold onto your hats because it's going to be a lot of fun.
* The average average is **6.916**
* The controversy average is **2.102**

Today we will be revealing **#51 - #31**.

**Average:** 4.341 **// Total Points:** 251.8 **// Controversy:** 2.475

---

So, our first song out is probably not a big surprise to most of the people in this rate. Nearly a point below the next highest song in the rate, I Write the Songs left most of you unamused. With or without the context that Bruce Johnston isn’t writing about himself here, it seems like most of you were not on board with this track. Manilow’s performance here didn’t seem to impress, and for the record, I’m with you on this one.

##I write sins

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This is my first Barry Manilow song, and, holy shit, I can already tell he's gay, haha. This was apparently written by a Beach Boy member, which if a fun bit of trivia, and it's supposedly from the perspective of God, rather than a personification of music itself. This is cheesy, but it's the right kind of cheese.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): rihanna is shook

**twat\_brained** (6.4): I'm glad that a gay icon as great as Barry won SOTY, and he's a great singer, but the award is ostensibly given for "great lyrics and melody". The melody is there, but the lyrics make no goddamn sense. This shouldn't make it past day 2 at most.

##I write tragedies

**stansymash** (5.9): i thought this was barry white for a second and almost felt something for once

**julry** (4): I was kinda becoming a fanilow until he made the young girls cry

**snidelaughter** (3): Uh, this sounds insanely overwrought, with an unearned key change for a song that doesn't seem to offer any emotional heft outside of Manilow's voice. Also, it's doubly stupid because he didn't write this.

**Mudkip1** (1): meh i don't like his voice

**calltehshots** (0): Wow, I hate this garbage song. Barry Manilow makes me want to pour battery acid into my earlobes. You write the songs that makes the whole world deaf. Picking this for record of the year was the exact moment when the Grammys became tasteless.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Wow maybe there’s a deeper meaning (edit: yes there’s is apparently according to Wikipedia) but it’s just sounds annoying and pretentious a little.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): lmao what ego trip is this

##Who wrote this?

**LazyDayLullaby** (5): Who writes the good songs?

**shineflyer** (5): Obligatory reminder that this was not, in fact, written by Barry Manilow.

**dirdbub** (4.5): whoa bold statement there buddy pal

**agentofscranton** (3): the irony of manilow not even having written this song

**SupremeShani** (2): It's been pointed out, but I find it hilarious that Manilow didn't participate in writing this song at all. The lyrics come off as strange to me, like I know it's not suppose to come across as a massive ego trip but that's just how it comes across.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): holy shit have you ever heard anything more pretentious? Larry writes the songs and I fucking skip them. Also he didn't even write the song lmfao take this L Harry.

**PendulumThief** (0): lying little shit didn't even write the song. smh.

**theburningundead** (0): He couldn't even write this song smh

I believe a bit more did the Billboard YE rate, but honestly, this rate has a lot of ballads, songs popheads doesn't know (and I didn't know a bunch either), and is super long.

Piccprincess: # [#50: Games People Play](https://i.imgur.com/AxA8Tku.png)

---

**Average:** 5.222 **// Total Points:** 302.9 **// Controversy:** 1.913

---

Our next song out isn’t so surprising either. A folksy country track isn’t the best fit for a sub called popheads, and seeing it as the second song out in this rate isn’t too shocking. Games People Play is a song concerned about manipulation of communication. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem like you all were playing games, and this song was quickly eliminated early on. Sorry, Joe South, but not sorry because you have a Grammy.

##LoveGame

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): how have i never heard this before?? a country bop

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.4): Good message, and I like the instrumental lines.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): I thought I was going to hate this but I don't. Sounds like it could be an interesting sample for a song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is the first melody here I really dig, and I think the way the guy delivers this is pretty nice, but for a song from 1970 this is disappointingly quiet compared to the other two. Would have gotten a better score if it had better production.

##End Game

**awryj** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxWkfJ4uvV0

**SupremeShani** (5): The lyrics in the verses are surprisingly not that bad, but the chorus falls flat and is just a bore to listen to.

**shineflyer** (4.5): Sitar Hero, here we come.

**johnazoidberg-** (4): This dude sings entire sentences as one word. And this beat Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head? This beat I'll Never Fall In Love Again? At least Dionne Warwick knew how to enunciate! What the hell is this?

**stansymash** (4): i've never so aggressively not heard of a song before

**Mudkip1** (1): yeah no anything but this muffled ass voice

##Donkey Kong Country

**calltehshots** (5): Must've been a slow year lol. This sounds like a drunk person at 4AM at some podunk karaoke bar.

**twat\_brained** (3): *Sigh*, it's like you guys don't even remember what happened the last time we rated a country song. Of course, there's a much better country song on this list I'm looking forward to listening to but still.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (1): im convinced this era is just all terrible country music

From a distance, this is a christian subreddit :/ But for real, this Bette Midler rendition of Julie Gold’s From a Distance did not fare well in this rate. This unabashedly Christian track clocks in at about four minutes and thirty seconds, and most popheads deemed it to be an unpleasant four minutes and thirty seconds. Fun fact: Julie Gold wrote this song while she was a secretary for HBO. Apparently, she watched about five minutes of Oz or Westworld and decided she needed Jesus.

##Front And Center

**mustangs16** (10): i loveeeee bette midler she's a real fucking queen

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I have a love-hate relationship with this song, because when I actually recalls what it sounds like, I can't give it a bad score, really. It's a pleasant song. The thing is, it should be pleasant in all the wrong ways. From an objective point of view it's trite, it's bland, it's boring for a singer who rose to fame by singing in gay spaces, and the religious references in the lyrics are terrible and they actually end up implying deism so it sucks to be Bette Milder. I truly, truly do not know what is compelling me to give this song a 7.

##Far Away

**rickikardashian** (7): From a distance I’m still depressed and fat, what’s your point?

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.7): I enjoy this song more from a distance

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6): Again, her best song is still the one from Hocus Pocus.

**stansymash** (5.7): fox sound

**shineflyer** (4.5): Cheesy, sure, but its got a couple of interesting chords and whatnot.

**awryj** (3): "The Midler recording of the song ranked at number 37 on VH1's list of the "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever." and ranked at number 14 on the now defunct Blender Magazine's list of "The 50 Worst Songs Ever". Criticisms focus on the song's lyrical content and the production of Midler's version."

**snidelaughter** (2): This is really bland. Even with Bette's vocal performance being as good as it is, I just can't vibe with it. It sounds really dated.

##Close To God

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): this is guaranteed to win considering we're a Christian subreddit.

**letsallpoo** (4): does god watch me jerk off cause that would be gay

**dirdbub** (3.5): oh sorry, a Christian song :/

**TragicKingdom1** (3): as a proud satanist this song is NOT for me!

**calltehshots** (1): Wow, the Grammys were really eating out of Bette's ass with this. From a distance, god is an asshole - thank you Bette.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (0): She sings from a position of smug moral superiority and it makes the song unbearable. It's a charity single in disguise.

**twat\_brained** (0): Is there anything to say here which Todd in the Shadows hasn't already said about this song? No wonder more and more people are turning atheist if this is the kind of "religious" music they're subject to.

**Average:** 5.405 **// Total Points:** 313.5 **// Controversy:** 2.876

I’m so angry the Grammys didn’t have the insight to nominate the superior song this year, the [trap remix of this song](https://soundcloud.com/hood-classics/john-mayer-daughters-sata_hd), as /u/BreezySeason pointed and /u/snidelaughter out. Anyway, did anyone expect a song this recent to go out so early? So much for recency bias I guess. Daughters seemed to have popheads split, with half in favor of this sappy Mayer track, and the other half not on board with his questionable lyrics. I still wish we rated the trap remix.

##Caretakers

**agentofscranton** (10): this is so fucking problematic but goddamn if this song isn’t just so easy and chill to listen to

**BreezySeason** (10): I give this a 10 solely because of this remix: https://soundcloud.com/hood-classics/john-mayer-daughters-sata_hd

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song makes me think of weddings and that’s all I have to say.

**snidelaughter** (7): I'm a sucker for John Mayer, even for something as sappy as this. Although the trap remix is still stuck in my head.

**stansymash** (7): somebody help me, i can't figure out if i'm supposed to like or care about john mayer or not. do we hate him? do we like him ironically? i am only an out of touch british boy you can't expect this of me

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): ayo John imma let you finish, but Jesus Walks is one of the best songs of all time. of all time.

##Helicopter Parents

**calltehshots** (6): This song sounds beautiful as a piece of music but the lyrics I just can't. It's so cringey. It reads like middle school ~deep~ poetry.

**Leixander** (6): too vanilla and this is coming from a person who loves vanilla maybe a little bit much

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5.5): Oh fuck off you don't even have kids.

**SupremeShani** (4.5): I really tried to like John Mayer, but I can't listen to half his discography and this is no exception. I'll give it credit for solid guitar work and vocals.

**awryj** (4): [RATE] Songs About Family

**twat\_brained** (3.4): Remind we why WGWAGs (White Guys With Acoustic Guitars) are allowed to be nominated? Let alone allowed to win Grammys? This should never have beaten "Jesus Walks" for Song of the Year.

**dirdbub** (2.5): this is the "7 Years" of 2003

**fifthchevron** (1): Wow this fuckdouche won song of the year?

**ImADudeDuh** (1): I actually got goosebumps from this song, and not in a good way.

**DraculaWeekend** (0): As a casual fan of John Mayer, I think this song had potential. The instrumental is pretty good, and the opening lyrics aren't bad. Unfortunately, the chorus and bridge are just not good. "Girls become lovers who turn into mothers…" and "On behalf of every man looking out for every girl..." are terrible lyrics that are enough to ruin this song for me.

**milkywayinradius** (0): Bleh, he should have distracted me with some sick beats and a sax solo so I wouldn't notice these preachy lyrics

##Taylor Swift Says Hello

**rickikardashian** (6.5): Buy Dear John of itunes

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Didn't expect John Mayer to have this terrible of a voice. I suppose the lyrics could be characterised as heteronorma-I mean, sweet in a sense, but coming from the guy who dated Taylor when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s they...feel kind of creepy. I'm not saying the shitpost to this should be Dear John but it totally should. **(editor's note: 👀)**

**zamomattel** (0): I hate this so much, Taylor & Katy can do better

**Average:** 5.536 **// Total Points:** 321.1 **// Controversy:** 2.130

---

Evergreen (or Everygreen, if you go by our wonderful typo in the rate message template), is the soft and ever-so-Streisand theme song for 1976’s musical film A Star is Born. Written by Streisand herself and composer/songwriter Paul Williams, it’s not exactly the fastest song on this rate. As a result, many users found it boring, myself included. I’m already bored writing this writeup so

##Perennial

**kanyewestrep** (9): giving default 9+'s to Barbara Streisand

**Mudkip1** (8): i like this one a lot more than her other one

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Oh, look, another song meant for a musical! This one is perfectly fine-Barbra does a good job with her vocals and I'm excited to see Gaga try out this one. My main problem with it is that the verses blend in a bit too much with the chorus.

##Biennial

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): there is a way to make ballads interesting and it has been done many times. This is not one of those times.

**stansymash** (5): i would pay somebody for like, a song with drums or energy or personality or something at this point. like, blondie released parallel lines this year but instead we go for this. tragedy

**zamomattel** (5): Babs sounds lovely as ever but I am bored

**SupremeShani** (4): The scene from A Star is Born always made me uncomfortable, and I can't help but remember it when I hear this song.

**twat\_brained** (2): I- I'm confused. This is practically the same as "The Way We Were". Literally, if you played these songs back-to-back, I'd have no idea which one is which. Debby Boone should've been the only winner of this award. Unoriginality should **NEVER** win.

##Gaga Streisand

**jamesfog** (9): Gaga is quaking

**therokinrolla** (9): gaga is coming

**rickikardashian** (8.5): gAgA WiLl oUtSeLl

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.1): The whole time I was listening I imagined Lady Gaga singing this in the remake.

**ignitethephoenix** (2): This is forgettable, I’m sorry. But maybe when Lady Gaga covers it it will be better...

We Are the World frankly is a perfect example of too many cooks in the kitchen. This song sounds like a cake baked by a rabid army of chefs in some relay race, taking turns whisking and measuring sugar. Unfortunately, all the chefs also managed to leave this cake in the oven for about a week too long and burned down the kitchen. There’s too many artists to list here, and they all make an appearance on this 7 minute charity track that most users felt was painfully long and unwieldy. I love the intent, but I’m not a fan of the result.

##World Peace

**dirdbub** (10): ended racism **[(editor's note)](https://i.imgur.com/FqVYBi1.png)**

**jamesfog** (10): This is too iconic

**SupremeShani** (9.5): It feels wrong to criticize this song, not only because of why it was made, but just because it's a good song. The choices in production do a sound job of avoiding being overly preachy like someone might expect, and it manages to come off as sincere instead.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I always really enjoy group charity songs and hearing all the vocals of all the different singers. The only thing is the song is a bit too long and repetitive towards the end.

**julry** (8): charity bop

**mustangs16** (7.5): yes it's preachy westernized bullshit but it's not terrible preachy westernized bullshit

**twat\_brained** (7.3): Bob Geldof was involved in this? That explains so much. Also, why was the entire Jackson 5 on this but not Janet? That isn't fair. All in all, this song set out to do what it intended, raising 8 figures in donations, and it's better than the other nominees, I suppose.

**awryj** (7): I love the Bob Dylan part where he's basically reading the lyrics off of the paper lmao

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): A star-studded gimmick for a good purpose

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): this song stayed a meme in my schools all the way up to HS. it's nice

##World In Flames

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): This is one of the only charity song that people can semi-tolerate these days, and I myself can barely stand it. I feel that this is at least somewhat genuine, since it was headed by Michael Jackson, but I find Todd in the Shadows's critique of the updated version just as equally relevant to the original; though it was ultimately made for good, it's still somewhat disappointing that the song states that *we* are the world. Even when it comes to making works of art for a good cause, the song has to talk about *us*. Not the people who're suffering, *us*. It feels kind of self-serving. I'm probably reading too much into this, but, eh, all things considered this shouldn't have been seven minutes long.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): I know this song was for a good cause but it is so corny.

**milkywayinradius** (5): bunch of people being really extra and trying to one-up each other in their lines and in caring about the children

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.3): I feel bad rating a charity single so low, but this is a super cheesy song.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): I don't think this is "worst song ever" territory like some people but it did NOT need to be 7 minutes long.

**calltehshots** (2): Oh my god, they really gave this trash song a award lol. Ego tripping nonsense.

**DrunkHurricane** (2): this song is too long for its own good. It doesn't help that it's so goddamn slow. The lyrics make the writers sound incredibly selfish; they made a song about starving children about how awesome they are. Plus some of the singers sound awful, e.g. Cyndi Lauper.

**snidelaughter** (0): Look, I respect the cause, but like in the real world, cheese spoils quick, and there's enough cheese here to feed every rat and their children for the rest of their lives. There's no substance here, and making it seven minutes long makes it absurdly overwrought to boot.

##Earth Song

**zamomattel** (6.5): SEVEN MINUTES!! But like Diana is better than Michael, discuss

**fifthchevron** (6): Room full of celebrities but only one star. I feel bad for MJ having to sing with so many basic vocalists.

**shineflyer** (1): It takes a special kind of discompassion to write a song about people in pain and make it sound like this. Michael couldn't save this, Springsteen couldn't save this, and God KNOWS Bob Dylan couldn't save this.

Another song, another guy with a guitar bites the dust. Stay with Me (Darkchild version) is probably a song you’ve heard one too many times on the radio, and it appears as if its gospel leanings and [Tom Petty stylings](http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-30997759) didn’t fare well with you guys. Understandable, as it didn’t fare well with me either. Oh, and if you’re confused about that weird Darkchild thing, it’s okay, you’ve probably never seen it before, but it’s the version you’ve heard many times before.

##I'm Not The Only One

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): man, I know y'all do not fuck with Sam, but this song is so fucking good. It's simple and heartbreaking and his voice just shines through and I'm gonna be really pissed when it goes out in the first day.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): The beautiful beginning of a career consisting of this same song repeated 20 times (also no t, no shade, but take me to church or chandelier should have won, ijs)

**dirdbub** (8.5): https://i.imgur.com/9BGKbQ5.jpg (should have been "Take Me To Church")

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I was quite fond of this song when it first came out, and I still kind of enjoy it. It's got a good easy listening feel to it, and it shows off Sam's tenor pretty well. Chandelier, however, is a 10 and should've won instead.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I actually liked Sam Smith a little back in this era of his, because his ballads at the time were fairly refreshing to hear after the EDM of the early 2010s, as well as to have a queer artist in the mainstream. Now...this seems even less groundbreaking, even if I still enjoy listening to it. The only Sam Smith song I really enjoy nowadays is Like I Can, but it's kind of cringy at the same time.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): Unlike Mayer or Sheeran, Smith's at least honest about the fact that he's trying to woo you.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Choir vocals really elevate the song. Plus it's under 3 minutes which really helps it from getting boring.

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I had no idea that the version people know was a Darkchild remix, either way I gave this a decent score because it wasn't a bad song to me when I heard it on the radio, and it was before Sam made a thousand of his own remixes and put them all on an album called The Thrill of It All.

##Lay Me Down

**fifthchevron** (6): wouldn't have won without the choir

**zamomattel** (5): no leave me alone

**calltehshots** (3): Absolutely not.

**shineflyer** (3): Sam, follow my lead - don't do hookups if you can't emotionally handle hookups.

**therokinrolla** (3): ugh

**awryj** (2): I wish an actually good fat-era Sam Smith song was in the rate latch

**sletrab07** (1.5): This song is outright repellent for me. It’s so thoughtless, so uninteresting and so overwrought, I just don’t know what to do with myself whenever it comes on besides audibly grunt in anger.

**kanyewestrep** (1): One out of ten

**AFlyingWhale\_** (0): sam smith

**Mudkip1** (0): don't u ever ever fucken send me any thing like this again. U r so ignored. U will be so sorry one day. But u don't even know it yet. That pride of yours u think u know everything but u know shit. Your have really pissed me

**stansymash** (0): i just wanted to give a zero

##Petty Comments

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.7): The rest of the album is boring, but this is a great song. I took off 0.3 points for plagiarism though lol.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its a bop but loses 2 points for literally being I Won't Back Down

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): This song won't back down, it'll stand its ground

**johnazoidberg-** (5): I liked this song better when it had a faster tempo and Tom Petty was singing lyrics about protesting. RIP Tom Petty

This twinkly soul track written by Bobby Russell comes in at number 44. Some vibed with the slow, sparse nature of the track, and others did not want any part of the unorthodox lyricism. Some people also pointed out that this won over 1968’s Hey Jude, a Beatles track that you may possibly have heard of. I’m not gonna say that it was a completely undeserved win for Little Green Apples, but I think we know which one gets talked about more half a century later.

##Granny Smith

**kanyewestrep** (10): O.C. Smith is a legend haha

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I thought this was going to borderline tread into boring heterosexuality (TM) but it ended up really sweet. This is the right kind of heartwarming when it comes to classic songs.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): not sure what the apples have to do with anything but it's really cute.

**calltehshots** (7): This song is cute but also what? Like okay god didn't make green apples and disneyland isn't real and neither are bb guns and are you okay O.C. Smith

##Rotten Apple

**rickikardashian** (6.7): i wanted it to pop off after the first verse, but nothing happened

**DraculaWeekend** (6): Thought this was a Christmas song at first.

**agentofscranton** (5): is this like a lullaby or something

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5): The production on this is really dated (especially the keyboard horns and backup vocals).

**johnazoidberg-** (5): Hungry for apples? Because this song beat Hey fucking Jude.

**stansymash** (5): man this guy could be a literal saint but i already hate him a lot

**dirdbub** (4.5): one time in school I got in trouble for asking why only green apples were sour and not any other apple was and long story short that's how I learned about racism

**ImADudeDuh** (4): "there's no such thing as dr seuss." wtf way to be a buzzkill

**zamomattel** (3.5): I love you Steve Jobs

**twat\_brained** (1.3): I- I'm conflicted. It starts out really weird and the whole twinkling xylophone kind of puts me off, and the lyrics don't make a lot of sense. This isn't getting my 0 but it's not gonna score very high either.

**therokinrolla** (1): oh my god please shoot me

##M.C. Smith

**awryj** (8): "Apples" and "Indianapolis"/"Minneapolis" RHYME??? As a non-native speaker, TIL

**julry** (7): apples/indianapolis rhyme works surprisingly well

**shineflyer** (3): Apples rhymed with Minneap-plis.

This song written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager is most known for its cover by Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight, and Stevie Wonder done for AIDS research in 1985. Unfortunately, though, popheads was split on what friendship meant. In the end, though, we learned that the true spirit of the journey was the friends we made along the way. Or something like that. Well, either way, this charity track comes in at number 43.

##Besties

**jamesfog** (10): Amazing collab

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Oh, look, another charity song! I may be sick of ballads at this point, but it's nice to return to actually pleasant cheese once again. This is aided greatly by the beautiful backing saxophone, as well as the stellar performances Dionne and guest stars such as Elton John provide. It's much better than a lot of other charity songs, that's for sure.

**SupremeShani** (8): These songs for charity are so hard to rate because I feel bad for not giving these songs a perfect score. Dionne, Elton, Stevie, and Gladys all killed it in terms of vocals and complement each other and the song well, even if they look like they never met each other in the music video.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.3): The scene from Bridesmaids where Annie and Helen start singing this a cappella is iconic. This song's cheesy, but they really sell it so I'll give them some points haha.

##Frenemies

**stansymash** (6.9): if i close my eyes i can pretend this is just a stevie wonder song

**zamomattel** (6.5): I get the appeal but Dionne is so good she should be alone here

**Mudkip1** (5): these songs all are so similar lol

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): will a good song ever come on again? tune in at 9pm to find out.

**Raykel** (4): I already know this is one of the songs I'm not gonna remember during the rate reveal.

**calltehshots** (3): I mean, it's better than We Are The World but charity singles are still sooooooo trite. This benefits by strong, contained star power behind it. But still, bleh.

**twat\_brained** (1.6): The harmonica makes this sound so cheesy. This song's greatest moment in history was when it was featured in *Shrek the Third*. Who cares if it went Year-End #1 AND won SOTY? Also, please make sure it's LOWER than #37 this time.

**awryj** (0): no please no no no nononooo

##Friends With Benefits

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I mean I'd be able to count on my friends too if my friends were dionne warwick, elton john and fucking stevie wonder!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.2): Dionne Warwick has talented friends

**shineflyer** (2): These guys aren't friends. This isn't what friendship sounds like. Stevie still sounds alright, though.

Ironically enough, the next song to go out is the next song of the year follow That’s What Friends Are For. This 1986 track, funnily enough, was recorded for the Steven Spielberg film An American Tail. Yeah, the movie about the mice. When will Disney ever. Anyway, this pop ballad didn’t score many points with listeners as it’s somewhere out there in day 1 at number 42.

##The Great Beyond

**Leixander** (10): their voices go along really well! I love this

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): I used to fall asleep to a version of this song when I was younger

**stansymash** (7.5): [community made this song mean something to me through the power of deep male friendship. the gambino cover we needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSNwmqY9cCU)

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): There are a lot of pleasant and respectable ballads in this rate. This is one of them.

**zamomattel** (7): his voice is heavenly

**twat\_brained** (6.9): Its…equal parts powerful and beautiful but in all honesty I feel like U2 should've won instead. Okay, SYCMIOYO just shuffled after this. Is this a sign for something?

**milkywayinradius** (6): Weird addition of electric guitar solo, but okay

**SupremeShani** (6): Even though the entire thing, from the orchestra to the electric guitar to the dramatic vocals, comes across as overly sentimental, it's still a sweet song.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): I didn't like how the momentum of the song was constantly changing but the guitar solo was good.

##The Abyss

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.9): This just feels so 80's I can't deal with this.

**calltehshots** (5): It's fine, this is what every 80s duet ballad sounds like. How this was that popular I'll never know but hey, the 80s.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): I'm sorry but this is so fucking boring.

**awryj** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCVDqzcdw-s

**snidelaughter** (3): Boring duet propped up by an admittedly out of place guitar solo.

**DraculaWeekend** (2): Why were the 80s so cheesy?? Hearing this awakened the hatred I forgot I had for this song.

**shineflyer** (1.5): You ready for nostalgia bias to get this song way further than it needs to be? Cause it will. This song makes me feel like throwing up, it's so sickening.

##Fievel Goes West

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Ok screaming at the fact that this song from An American Tale won the song of the year. Edit: The guitar solo had me so incredibly shook why is this such a good song

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): As a Disney fan, I'm kind of obligated to hate An American Tail since it prospered during their dark area. I mean, seriously, Great Mouse Detective is way better. Petty rivalry aside, this song is just bad. It's obviously made to win Oscars and it sounds like almost every other song made for that reason. Though, it's a damn shame the female singer here can't sing anymore due to Parkinson's.

This second U2 song of the year didn’t impress those who did this rate, coming in at 41. I agree with many of the commenters here that this is nowhere near U2’s best, but it’s still a solid track from the Irish band. The song itself is about the declining health of Bono’s father, and as /u/rickikardashian pointed out, this ended up winning over Mariah Carey’s We Belong Together.

##With A Little Help From My Friends

**shineflyer** (10): I have some bias with this one, if we're being real, cause this song has been with me through a lot. It's really comforting. It isn't a "bop," though, so Day 1 elimination here we come.

**fifthchevron** (9): I don't remember this having much impact but wow, it should've.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): U2's really good at writing anthems.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): I especially like the additional melody and lyric in the final chorus

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this is very emotional and I really like the instrumental.

##Giving Up

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.8): Until I was 20, I had no clue that U2 were considered one of the all time greatest rock bands. They were just that band from the Apple commercials, a peer of Coldplay and Muse instead of the band that made their careers possible. And with songs like these, can you blame me?

**DraculaWeekend** (6): I honestly don't remember this song at all

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the vocals and instruments feel like they come from 2 different songs

**rickikardashian** (6): Okay, the song is cute and all, but how did this win over We Belong Together?

**SupremeShani** (5.5): The lyrics are powerful, but the rest of the song just doesn't get my attention. I think listening to all these sad songs in a row is making me biased.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): U2 gets the Eric Clapton curse here. They have another Song of the Year in the middle of the decade, but it's much blander than their first award. Sweet song, but it's bland and easily the most obscure Song of the Year of the 00s cage. There's not much to say about it because it's so average.

**zamomattel** (5): this sounds like when Coldplay made music I didn't like

**mustangs16** (4): i! don't! get! the! u2! obsession!

**twat\_brained** (2.8): This isn't even the best song on the album! "City of Blinding Lights" wipes the floor with this song. (My parents are the biggest and most dedicated U2 stans **EVER**. They've seen them live 6 times; the same amount of times I've seen Lady Gaga live)

**snidelaughter** (1): I want to give it a 0 out of principle because every other song nominated deserved it over this. U2 in 2001 was barely okay, U2 20 years after their prime is not justifiable. The song itself is bland, nothing more, nothing less.

##Ambien Baby

**awryj** (4): snoozefest

**johnazoidberg-** (1): Thank you for making this song, U2. I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately, but this piece of shit put me straight to sleep.

This song was written for a film of the same name. Written by Joseph Brooks, the Debby Boone-sung cover became the first song to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 10 weeks straight. However, the ballad didn’t even come close to topping this rate, arriving at number 40. As for me, this song kinda bored me so I’m not surprised to see this so low.

##Light Me Up

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I can't lie and say I'm not starting to get tired of the ballads at this point, but Debby Boone does a fantastic job, as always, and this is easily one of the best ballads of the first half of the rate.

**mustangs16** (8.5): this is such a good "dramatic car singalong" song

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.4): Idk why but this sounds like something from Grease.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): sounds vaguely familiar like the kind of song you'd play over a "heartwarming"/"motivational" montage

**shineflyer** (6.5): I was ready to give this a MUCH lower score, but Debby Boone actually has a pretty good voice? Like, am I crazy or?

##In The Dark

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): #FFFFFF

**calltehshots** (6): Inoffensive pageant girl karaoke anthem.

**LazyDayLullaby** (5.5): Shepherds sing 'ewe light up my life'

**snidelaughter** (5.5): Generic song propped up by decent instrumentation and a solid vocalist

**zamomattel** (5.5): this is a cute girl but beating nobody does it better? girl please

**SupremeShani** (5): Everything about this song screams generic to me, but I didn't hate it.

**twat\_brained** (4): You DON'T light up this rate, which is the problem. Hell, why did this tie her and not "Hotel California"? I'm not the biggest fan of it but at least it's historical. Not like this.

##Light A Fire Under The Grammys

**agentofscranton** (6.5): I can’t shake this feeling that my mum was in charge of choosing the record of the year winners these past couple of years

**stansymash** (5): i was almost gonna comment on how they chose two songs this year before i realised they are both the same song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): is it fair to say that around this time there was a formula to decide the SOTY? They all sound the same.

Ah, popheads and hating Ed Sheeran, name a more iconic duo. This massively popular single off of his album X was inescapable, for better or worse. It’s a diamond single, it was the first song to be streamed over 500 million times on Spotify, and it held the record for most streams on Spotify until a little track called Shape of You dethroned it. Regardless of how you feel about Ed, that’s pretty impressive. And honestly, I really like this track, along with the majority of his work before Divide (but that’s an opinion for a different thread). But, understandably, a lot of you hated this token wedding song, and I can definitely be on board with that, because it’s basically required at every wedding from now on. It’s one of the biggest songs of the last 10 years, and I am not the least bit surprised it’s as successful as it was.

##I'm In Love With The Song of Ed

**agentofscranton** (10): I’m already mad that this is going to unjustifiably leave on day 1

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love this song. It's so sweet.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): knowing popheads this will be out very early but I love this song and I am proud to admit it. Nothing but respect for my ginger man.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A sweet little couples tune! I love it!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.5): Isn't this basically a retread of "Let's Get it On"?

**SupremeShani** (8): One of the few Ed Sheeran hits that I genuinely like, he really pushed himself in terms of vocals and there's no lyrics about bed sheets or sweet and sour chicken here.

**therokinrolla** (8): ed aside this is a solid sappy ballad. I kinda like it

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.9): Unwilling to commit past age 70? He really belts it out on the chorus, though.

**milkywayinradius** (7): I can't get over the "loving you 'till we're 70" line. I also used to think Justin Bieber sang this song, no shade sry

##Ginger Satan

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): old sheeran wasn't that bad, this one in particular is great for photo montages and weddings

**fifthchevron** (6): took a while to grow on me and it is a very passionate song but not song of the year IMO

**stansymash** (5.7): why is this man so boring, bless his soulless heart

**calltehshots** (5): Bland wedding song nonsense.

**shineflyer** (5): Remember when Ed put out a crazy good album, and the biggest hit was the worst and most generic track on the album? It's still okay, though.

**zamomattel** (4.5): I feel like this song would be much better if he wasn't singing it

**awryj** (4): weddingcore

**TragicKingdom1** (3): Obnoxiously obvious wedding bait. It's not the worst thing I've heard but I have a lot of trouble listening past the 2nd verse.

**dirdbub** (2.5): cute but undeniably straight

**sletrab07** (2.5): I loathe this song with the fire of a thousand ginger Satans. Thanks a lot, pop radio/every wedding I’ve been to since its release.

**DraculaWeekend** (2): This song means well but it is so cheesy. Definitely considered giving this a 0 but showed mercy.

**kanyewestrep** (0): I don't like song... at all...

##The Edsays

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This must have been how old people felt when Everything I Do was released. I went from loving this to hating it to being indifferent in the span of half a year. I'm still somewhat indifferent, but hey, compared to Bryan Adams's smoker's voice it makes a fairly good wedding song.

**rickikardashian** (8): The thing about this song, and many other Ed has done, is that its lyrics can be a bit too direct and not too artistic, however in this case it works because it makes it sound like an spontaneous and genuine speech to a lover. I wish this song hadn’t become so fucking popular because having to hear everyone sing it when someone in the band played it in the guitar got real old very fast (blank space still is better and should have won)

**twat\_brained** (6.2): "Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?"🤢 I enjoyed this song a lot more than I should have. This was a cute song but I feel like "Tenerife Sea" could've performed just as well, if not better if it was released instead of TOL. At least it doesn't have any cringy lyrics or Ed trying to push his voice to limitations it cannot reach. Or an uninspired guitar solo. Not to mention it isn't as long, nor does it feel as long. "Alright" should've beaten this.

**Raykel** (0): This was the introduction to his sell out ways. He had potential with '+' and he threw what could've made him a great artist for an easy-money-grab wedding song. And ever since he's been on the decline. I hate the cheesy lyrics, the nothing melody, the BAGHBY NOW in the final chorus that makes him sound like he's choking on a frog, the oooh ad libs in the background in a bad attempt to sound emotional. I hate the intruments on this thing, they make no sense; where did that wierd classic rock blues electric guitar come from? Why? I can't stand anything about this song and the fact that I had to hear it everywhere all the time doesn't make matters any better.

**Average:** 6.128 **// Total Points:** 355.4 **// Controversy:** 1.935

Written by Jimmy Webb and performed by The 5th Dimension, Up, Up, and Away is chronologically the first song in this rate and the song of the year for the 10th Annual Grammy Awards in 1968. It actually won a ton of other awards, including Record of the Year, Best Performance by a Pop Duo or Group with Vocals, Best Performance by a Vocal Group, Best Performance by a Chorus, and Best Contemporary Song. Yeah, I just got that off of Wikipedia, but like, were you gonna look it up?

##99 Red Balloons

**Mudkip1** (10): this was actually really fun and cute i'm obsessed

**kanyewestrep** (9): this would have been a 10 if there wasn't guitars

**agentofscranton** (8): this is like the entire 1970s condensed into one song

**Leixander** (8): Holy apples, this is a bop!

**Raykel** (8): I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this.

**snidelaughter** (7.5): An oldie and a goodie, and since I know y'all don't listen to older music you really need to get on that Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In medley that the 5th Dimension did, that probably would've gotten my 11 if we did ROTY tbh

**sletrab07** (7.2): Up! Up and awAAAAaaaaAAAY! Goddamn if it isn’t catchy.

**calltehshots** (7): This song makes me feel like I'm high in a Folgers commercial and I'm okay with that.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Captures the sweet and simple side of the sixties, soaring up above the fields of Napalm

##Balloon Boy

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.8): I like the arrangement, but the song itself sounds like something written for a kid's show.

**stansymash** (6.8): this is what happens when laura nyro doesn't write their songs

**DraculaWeekend** (6): Yeah this song definitely sounds like the 60s. Also, maybe this is just me but it reminded me of "It's Not Unusual" at some parts.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): First song of the rate and I actually have no idea what to think. For a 60s song, this is gorgeously produced, but a lot of it is really saccharine. Perhaps its production ends up hindering it more than helping-if I'd choose to listen to something as cheesy as this song, I'd want old, jazzy elements to it filled with saxophones and deep voices and shit, not lavish instrumentals.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): I mean it's fun and harmless but it's definitely not SOTY material.

**zamomattel** (6): I'd love to hate this Disneyland-esque song but it's cute

**shineflyer** (5.5): Cheesy as fuck, but at least it's in a funny way, as opposed to the way where you just want to die.

**johnazoidberg-** (4): This sounds like a song from a rejected Around The World in 80 Days mash-up with the Muppets. If this shit won, the acid back then must have been C R A Z Y

**SupremeShani** (4): I guess if I ever catch myself on a hot air balloon, I'll have a song to listen to.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (3): the extreme stereo bothers me cuz my IEMs have hardly any soundstage. im also 90% the "beautiful balloon" is a euphemism

**julry** (2): wow, lyrics really WERE just as bad back then

**jamesfog** (0): I can't believe this won a Grammy

##Balloon Clap

This 2003 single, written by Luther Vandross and Richard Marx, and performed by Luther Vandross, is a touching tribute to his late father. A lot of you found solace in the emotion portrayed here, while others found the production lacking. Most everyone found that Vandross’ vocals were great here, and I agree, although I also agree about the production. Well, here it is at 37.

##Father's Day

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Some people might think that this song is a bit too slow or depressing, but it's hard not to feel something when hearing the heartbreak and desperation in the song. The wish of having more time with someone you've lost is something that always gets me

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FUCK im crying

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): One time in Art History, my professor asked us to draw, sing or write something that had importance to us. A classmate of mine picked this song, because his father had passed away a few years ago. The entire class cried and he got a well-deserved perfect score. This is a perfect swansong for Vandross.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I am now really sad and full of feelings. This lyrical this a great song and it made me tear up a little while listening to music (which is something I don’t normally do).

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.3): I'd rate it higher but the production is kinda basic. Luther is one of the best singers ever though and this song is really sweet.

**johnazoidberg-** (8): This one hurt for a couple reasons. One, my mom once told me I was conceived to Luther Vandross and that's a mental image I never wanted nor asked for. Second... my dad's been sick lately, and a song about losing your father is something I needed even less than a mental image of him getting it on. Beautiful song, but it missed its potention by putting some awful images in my head. Would not recommend

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): A touching tribute

**rickikardashian** (7): good relationships with my dad? can’t relate

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Oh! I wanna dance with my father I wanna feel the heat with my father Yeah! I wanna dance with my father With my father who loves me

##Daddy Issues

**therokinrolla** (6): hm

**stansymash** (5): there's no way this song is real and came out this millenium

**SupremeShani** (5): I feel bad for giving this an average score given its lyrical content, but I can't remember much after hearing it.

**calltehshots** (4): The sentiment of this song is nice but it's just so...boring. I never cared for it.

**zamomattel** (4): this is a bit cheesy tbh, but Luther sounds amazing as ever

**CrispyEggs123** (3): Pretty much all singers from my country have sung this song and I'm sick of it

**shineflyer** (1): Wow, they really know how to pull the rough out of the diamonds, don't they? That percussion is really grating. Like, REALLY grating. It gives me a headache.

##Daddy Lessons

**letsallpoo** (8): beyonce sweetie

**Mudkip1** (5): Hottie: You guys are just jealous because all of my friends that know me tell me that I remind them of Beyoncé. New York: Look like Beyoncé? Are you out of your fuckin MIND? Beyoncé, sweetie, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that an ugly ass bitch like this would even say that. Oh my God. Are you fuckin insane? Beyoncé? Beyoncé?! BEYONCÉ?!!? You know what you – you know who you really look like? You fuckin look like Luther Vandross.

**awryj** (2): What is this? Why is Beyonce in the video? Why did they show a picture of Celine Dion? Is that Wayne Brady? What is happening? I know I'm an uncultured swine but I literally have no idea what is happening here. Maybe it wasn't popular in Europe or sth

**twat\_brained** (5): Anyone ever tell you you look like Beyoncé? :sweetie: Also, this is cute but it feels at least one decade removed. How did this beat "Beautiful" by Xtina? Or even "Lose Yourself"? Take off the rose-tinted glasses, NARAS. You're not fooling anyone.

This song written by Tommy Sims, Gordon Kennedy, and Wayne Kirkpatrick was popularized by British singer Eric Clapton for the 1996 film Phenomenon. Obviously, the world must’ve been hella changed because I was born that year. It feels amazing to have a song written about me win a song of the year Grammy. I’m so honored. Anyway, this solid Clapton track was liked by as many as those who found it middling.

##Leaders

**agentofscranton** (10): honestly kind of a bop

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Not sure why I like this song so much. It's just so smooth. Also, this is the third song in this rate that I found a Mac DeMarco cover for; not sure why I keep finding his covers but I'm not even mad.

**fifthchevron** (10): I never knew this was Eric, what a genius he is

**johnazoidberg-** (9): The way Slowhand plays guitar on this, it almost sounds like the guitar is singing with him. It's beautiful, and his guitar-playing combines with his voice to really to pull off the mix between rock, blues, and soul. I just wish Clapton didn't waste this on a telekinetic John Travolta movie

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): Catchy song with some deft guitar lines. Cool chord progression

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.4): I was expected to be bored by the first verse but then the chorus kicked in. I actually love this song.

**SupremeShani** (7.5): I enjoyed this way more than Tears in Heaven, the guitar is catchy and Clapton does a good job switching between full and rich in the verses to airy and light in the chorus.

**zamomattel** (7.5): I've enjoyed the Clapton songs more than I thought I would

**calltehshots** (7): This song could be very middle of the road but Babyface's background vocals in the chorus are so smooth that it completely saves the song.

##Followers

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): that song just came and went and I did not care for it at all.

**twat\_brained** (5.7): Okay, it's been several years, you can drop the pity vote now and give "Give Me A Reason" its Grammy. This song has NOT aged well, seeing as how John Mayer said we're still "waiting on the world to change". Which, if he only ever won one SOTY should've been that song instead of "Daughters".

**shineflyer** (5): Dad rock, in easy-listening form.

**awryj** (4): bland

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Compared to how heartbreaking Tears in Heaven was, the stripped down, laid-back vibe of this one is really disappointing. Nothing much happens here and I was expecting more for a second Eric Clapton song. That, and the fact that it's in between two stellar rock ballads.

Much like the actual activity of sailing, many found this Christopher Cross track to be pretty and ethereal. Also, much like the actual activity of sailing, many also found this Christopher Cross track to be pretty damn boring. I personally liked it, and while it is a slower track, it’s pretty soothing. Funnily enough, Cross himself didn’t originally intend this to be a single, but he loved the track, and as a result, it was a smash and later helped create an entire genre of music called yacht rock. Sperrys Top-Siders are shook.

##Lil Boat

**fifthchevron** (9): This is so pretty and dreamy.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I should not love this song and I have no idea why i do but i just really like this song and I've never heard it before the rate

**SupremeShani** (9): The vocals and instrumentals are so lush, the song flawlessly captures the feeling of sailing away.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.8): I thought this was gonna be "Come Sail Away With Me" and was disappointed. This is good though!

**awryj** (8): Ok this is so chill. It makes me think of a giant, white mansion near the ocean. I bet someone's made a vaporwave remix of it.

**calltehshots** (8): I don't know why I live for this song - I'm sure it's because I grew up with the NSYNC cover (a superior version, I must add) - but yes, a nautical bop.

**shineflyer** (8): I always avoided this song, cause the clips made it sound boring. But that guitar part is dreamy, there's a lot of cool harmonic stuff going on with that and the vocals.

**bwc222** (7.5): good, but lesley gore did it better

**stansymash** (7): he is a boat boy

##Capsized

**LazyDayLullaby** (6): Snoring

**Leixander** (6): AWOLNATION outsold

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): I actually really like Arthur's Theme but this doesn't go anywhere

**zamomattel** (5.5): this is a nice background song, but that is where it remains

**twat\_brained** (5): This feels like an uptempo version of the "Dire Dire Rocks" theme from Super Mario 64. At least the first part does. Anyway, this one strikes a solid 5 from me. It's nothing too unpleasant, but it doesn't feel memorable or timeless at all. Not like "New York, New York" by Frank Sinatra, at least.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Aside from my personal thirst for upbeat songs, the reason why I'm giving this a low score is because I've literally listen to it three or four times and I can hardly tell you anything bland about it. I'd assume that a song about sailing on the ocean waves would be a lot more exciting. Also, this reminds me about a spooky r/UnresolvedMysteries post regarding a disappearance on a ship and that's not good.

Written and performed by Bobby McFerrin, Don’t Worry, Be Happy became the first acapella song to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Yes, every “instrument” is actually Bobby’s voice. I didn’t actually realize that so I figured I would share that fact (that many people in the comments noted) for those who didn’t know. This classic track was either a hit for those who found it carefree, or a miss for those who felt it was long and annoying.

##Happy People

**jamesfog** (10): Innovative king of a capella!

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This absolute classic. For anybody who doesn't know, there are no instruments on this song. No background singers. No features. Every single sound you hear on this song came from Bobby McFerrin. This is an a cappella vocal jazz song that outpeaked Ariana! Bobby McFerring deserves his own damn island for this song!

**Mudkip1** (10): ok this is a mother fucking bop

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.8): When this song's playing, worries really do flit away, if only for a while. Such a wonderfully happy tune; Bobby McFerrin's great

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): I can't help but bop along to this.

**awryj** (8): this is a bop ok

**Leixander** (8): literally iconic instrumentals

**Raykel** (8): A good example of a good meme song. Ok maybe it's not good, but it's fun and catchy.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): The song is very chill and gives a nice vibe, and it should be 3 minutes shorter

##Worrywarts

**stansymash** (7.3): well i guess i don't have depression anymore? I think?

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): this was happy before happy was a thing. the doo-wop is strong in this one

**fifthchevron** (7): Official chill tune

**PendulumThief** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6PYQjYlyhE

**calltehshots** (6): This song is sooooo stupid but it's stupidly charming and sweet. Like yes, I will not worry and I will be happy sis!!!

**DraculaWeekend** (6): This is one of those songs you have to be in the right mood to listen to because otherwise it can be kind of annoying.

**shineflyer** (5.5): I was certain this song was sarcastic and misunderstood by the public. But, I can't find anything to point to that. I'm still a fan of the adlibbed lines throughout the song, though, because I imagine them being said by Tommy Wiseau.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): This song is either the most optimistic song ever, or it's so fucking passive aggressive like "Oh no, all you have to do is don't worry and be happy, that'll solve aaaaalllllll your problems."

**snidelaughter** (4): That accent is put on as fuck and it's throwing me off like crazy.

**mustangs16** (3): ughhhhhhh

**zamomattel** (3): I'm not happy mind ya own business

**dirdbub** (0): this is insufferable

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): how the fuck should I be happy while this shit is playing Bob? tell me Bob. I haven't even given a 0 in a rate in so long Bob you really fucked this one up. Even Pharrell's Happy is better than this Bob. also I'm depressed so like this is really fucking rude Bob. fuck.

**therokinrolla** (0): aaaaaaaaaa fuck my fuck off

**TragicKingdom1** (0): Painfully sparse and boring. Also for a song about being happy the instrumental doesn't really express any happiness (or any emotion at all).

##Pitch Perfect

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I had no idea this song was done completely acapella or was comedic. Fast Car deserved to win the Grammy that year though.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Why is song is actually hilarious? Also I’m impressed that this song is all acappella. It’s weird that this won a Grammy though...

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I have conflicted emotions right now. This has all the elements of an acapella track that I'd absolutely hate under normal circumstances, but on the other hand, the guy singing this is just so *snuggly*. I mean that in a completely innocent way, mind you, he seems so friendly and loveable and I want to hug him. I'll be giving this a 6, but this is probably going to be the most positive 6 I'll ever give.

**twat\_brained** (5): Remind me again why people think Bob Marley sang and wrote this song? Also, this was entirely acapella? And it not only went #1 but won SOTY? Pentatonix could never. Finally, and these are **BIG** flaws, the song is a) too long and b) deserved to be Views'd because Bobby is singing in a fake accent just like Drake did.

This track, written by Ewan MacColl, was popularized by Roberta Flack in 1972. Her version was much slower than the original, more than twice as slow as the song was intended to be played. MacColl actually hated all the covers of his original song, which goes for many of you popheads. Some of you also liked it too. So, it stands here at number 33. Nice.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): I have chills

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.9): This is something I'd listen to while sipping coffee on a rainy day.

**SupremeShani** (8.5): One of my favorite vocalist of all time, Flack delivers a fantastic performance here, and the production here is hauntingly beautiful. I was never a fan of this song though and it goes on for far too long.

**therokinrolla** (7.5): yes this is pretty can we stop with the ballads

**twat\_brained** (6.2): To quote u/MrSwearword in the Billboard YE#1 rate, "good vocals but I was tired of it by the two-minute mark." Lullaby of the Year? For sure. Song of the Year? Not over the all-time classic that is "American Pie".

**ImADudeDuh** (6): def drags on a bit, but the first part of this song is really good

**Raykel** (6): Ok it's beautiful but I'm bored as shit.

**shineflyer** (5): I'm split between saying this is beautiful and saying it's boring as fuck. I won't seek it out, but it's nice when I'm forced to hear it.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): it's a chill jazz song i guess

**awryj** (4): invented ambient, Brian Eno who

**julry** (4): this is a great song, a folk classic, but frankly I find Roberta's version quite boring

**johnazoidberg-** (3): Look me in the eye and tell me this deserved to beat American Pie.

**zamomattel** (3): This song is so damn boring like you wait the whole thing for something to happen

##Rate Dead Redemption

**calltehshots** (9): I gave this a 7 when I rated this before but was I fucking deaf?! This shit is fucking beautiful.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Going to bump this one up by a point from how I scored it during the Billboard rate. It doesn't bore me as much as it used to, but what bugs me about it is that it seems more like poetry put to music than an actual song that just happens to have amazing lyrics. Also, 'yooourrr faceeee' is the stuff of memes.

**Average:** 6.355 **// Total Points:** 368.6 **// Controversy:** 2.544

This song title sounds like a military order from a twisted funhouse army. The song however, sounds anything but. Written by Stephen Sondheim in 1973, it’s been adapted by acts like Frank Sinatra, Stars of the Lid, and Krusty the Clown. However, the Judy Collins version, recorded two years later, is the one we’ve rated today. It’s received as controversially as clowns, with some of you appreciating the sadness of the track, and others bored out of your minds. I see a trend here, do you?

##Ronald McDonald

**Mudkip1** (10): love her voice so much

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): My inner theatre-geek is freaking out that Sondheim is in a rate. This song is so sad.

**zamomattel** (9.5): this is such a classic I cry

**calltehshots** (9): Damn, this shit is fucking sad. But where ARE the clowns?!

**julry** (9): I truly love this. Send in the clowns to my life, please.

**dirdbub** (8): me when It (2017, dir. Andrés Muschietti) started playing

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I like Judy Collins as a person a lot, and I also like her delivery here. This is a good song, but it's a song meant for Broadway, and it's even made for a particular Broadway archetype that I'm not a huge fan of. The title unnerved me a little, though according to Wikipedia the 'clowns' here are supposed to refer to fools, not actual clowns.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7.5): she reminds me of a lighter higher-pitched lana omg

##Pennywise

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Really pretty but sooooo slow

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): this is from an album called 'The Very Best of Judy Collins'. Imagine what 'The Very Worst of Judy Collins' would sound like.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I was not laughing at this song, I feel robbed

**SupremeShani** (6): A beautiful song, but not my favorite of Sondheim's work, even though Judy Collin did a fantastic job singing it.

**stansymash** (5.3): i'm like 8 songs in but i think i've already heard this song about 40 times

**twat\_brained** (3): Georgie could've survived if he just ran back home instead of crawled and got Bill to call 911. Granted, a prosthetic arm would've been expensive as hell but at least he would've lived. Then again, he may have proved to be a [liability](https://open.spotify.com/track/4iSN72L6xCM7vQZR2I9Suz) to the Losers Club. Anyway, let's see this go out on day 1.

**mustangs16** (2): what in the hell is this

**DrunkHurricane** (0): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

**LazyDayLullaby** (0): Send in the good songs

##Sweet Tooth

**awryj** (8): It's a beautiful song, but the clown metaphor is just weird.

**rickikardashian** (7): no thanks, clowns are ugly

**shineflyer** (7): The concept of clowns has not aged well.

**snidelaughter** (5): The clown metaphor just seems weird to me, IDK

**Average:** 6.367 **// Total Points:** 369.3 **// Controversy:** 2.116

Carole King’s You’ve Got a Friend is the next song out in this rate. The James Taylor-recorded version is in fact, not that song you heard in Toy Story, so let’s get that out of the way. The version we’ve rated is a soft rock track about the good of humanity. Always good to have more of that. Unfortunately, some of you didn’t find a friend in this song, and here it is, out at number 31.

##Friends In High Places

**calltehshots** (10): Ooooh this coffee shop bop fucking SLAPS! Sing the names of the seasons king.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Carole King is a brilliant songwriter.

**Leixander** (10): Aww so wholesome

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I adore Carol's version, something about the instrumentals and her vocals are really comforting and makes me feel all warm inside, I can say the same about the entirety of Tapestry.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): To be honest, this is an 8, but I'll be bumping the score up a bit because, speaking as an aromantic person, having songs about non-romantic, non-familial love is great. You've Got A Friend is about a special kind of agape love, a love that applies to humanity as whole, and I absolutely adore it for that. I feel like this applies to my relationship with my best friend-this is hard to explain to people who experience romantic love frequently, but my best friend *is* my partner in life. I mostly hear people saying that while they love their best friend more than anything, they can't imagine living with them forever, but I can. I obviously don't regard him as my boyfriend or anything, because I don't feel jealous when he experiences romantic attraction towards other people, nor do I desire to call him my husband one day, but we both agree that we want to move to Mexico, adopt a couple of snakes and cats (which I assume Taylor approves of) and die happy. I feel like the kind of love we have is captured in this song, but I also feel that all kinds of love, whether romantic or familial or platonic, can apply to what James Taylor is singing about. After all, that's what *agape love* is all about. And I've always said that if I wrote poetry or lyrics, my love songs would come from a similar, all-encompassing perspective.

**Mudkip1** (8.5): songs like these are so nice and make me feel all warm and fuzzy

**stansymash** (8.1): i finally feel loved after listening to this song

**kanyewestrep** (8): I'm so conflicted rating a lot of these songs because I hate acoustic guitars...

**poppinmmolly** (8): :)

**snidelaughter** (8): I never really got into James Taylor even though my mom loves him, this is tight even tho it's a cover

**agentofscranton** (6): oh wow it’s this song – I heard this all the time growing up and i’m literally just now finding out what it’s called and who it’s by

##Fake Friends

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): 1971 is also the year the first Starbucks was opened. Coincidence?

**ignitethephoenix** (6): It’s a good song however I just do not like the singers voice at all.

**julry** (6): I totally sang this in elementary school choir. We had arm gesture choreo and everything

**shineflyer** (6): I really don't like James Taylor's voice. But, the song's written pretty well. Go listen to Carole King's version instead, I guess.

**twat\_brained** (6): I don't have anything against this song but was this really the best song from that year? It feels so… mellow and… uneventful. I'm disappointed a better song wasn't chosen.

**awryj** (5): Wow I love Bridge Over Troubled Water

**berober04** (3.5): that scene where James Taylor says he's Mrs Nesbitt cracks me up

**AFlyingWhale\_** (3): at least it's a regular guitar and not the twangy country kind

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I do not trust this guy. this song feels like he's whisper singing it directly into my ear and I'm not even wearing headphones.

**DrunkHurricane** (2): this song makes me feel like he's my friend just so he can tell others he's a good person, not because he genuinely cares about me

##...In Me

**zamomattel** (7.5): I remember we sang this in my school choir and I initially thought we were gonna sing the song from Toy Story

**therokinrolla** (6): is this pixar

**mustangs16** (4): i went in expecting the song from Toy Story and am quite disappointed tbh

**fifthchevron** (2): Pixar did it better
