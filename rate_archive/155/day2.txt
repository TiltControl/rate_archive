And so we lose our first track of the day! I'm not really as enamored with this compared to everything else still in the rate, but it's fun enough. I know there were some complaints from Persona fans that it's not even in the game (though apparently does show up prominently in Arena), which is honestly a fair complaint for a series as Persona having this as its lone rep (though on initial listen I liked this quite a bit more than the track it was competing with 💀).

#Crime Fighters

**qazz23** (10): this is a good variation on the original, upbeat and dancey

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I remember some Persona fans being mad this was picked during the reveal, that just makes me more excited to play Persona eventually if this was the wrong pick while slapping this hard. also electro-shibuya-kei needs a rate but that's a topic for later

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): its not white boy funk! its future funk!!!! ahhh what a shocker. need a 7' cut so I can dj and scratcha this fella around! everyone wants to get down on the dance floor!

**BasedButta** (9): electronica choir… its good lol. reminds me of those rock songs where there’s a softspoken woman singing and all of a sudden a guy with screamo vocals comes in. its all in the dichotomy here… if you can see it and don’t think I’m insane then thank you ily

**pig-serpent** (9): This is pretty much everything I want from electonic music.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): [arms crossed, tapping foot]: I technically hear vocals!!!

**shipperondeck** (9): my mom called this mediocre but idc this one bops. also how did we get no P5 songs in here? when mother was there?? hello?????

**welcome2thejam** (9): I'm convinced the Persona developers were composers who used JRPGs as a platform to gain interest in their true passion project: dancing based rhythm games

**2RINITY** (8.5): Love me some classic piano house

**BebeLuigi** (8): a bit of a random track for Persona but I'll take it lol

**celladonn** (8): I prefer the original velvet room song (aria of the soul) but this is bopping

**Exaltatus** (8): Kinda hate Persona for how infectious the music is.

**Rigumaro** (8): I've only played Persona 5, and I was only familiar with that game's version of the track. So this one was a really cool surprise.

**StroHersh** (6): absolutely fuming that this was the persona pick. life goes on?? iwai's music?? youthful lunch???? PRICE??? YOU CHOSE THIS?? sorry.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): im just puzzled at how THIS ended up being the persona/smt rep in this rate out of the entire franchise

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): do the indieheads trip hop rate

**apatel27** (5): I'm sure the garbled voice has a purpose in the story but it sucks as an instrument

**rslashpoopheads** (5): if it ain't Mass Destruction I don't want it!

**Slaycoco** (5): I am once again complaining that there are far superior songs in a franchise. Hell, the ACTUAL velvet room theme is far superior to this!!!

I feel like the Donkey Kong Country soundtracks sometimes get forgotten in the talk of best soundtracks ever. Which is funny cause they're still talked about quite a bit! But the amount of atmosphere and emotion the composers (shoutout to David Wise and Eveline Fischer, among others) were able to portray in a series about monkey with rideable animal buddies is unbelievable. [In A Snowbound Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eio1LBm2Z4I) from DKC2 might've taken my 11 if it somehow made it in. Not to mention the slays of [Forest Interlude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5EgRk0mQM8), [Ice Cave Chant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEOYy4_3ciA), [the original Stickerbrush Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdPlcKg-qFs) (also shoutout to the [DKC Tropical Freeze arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SLOGs9ttiE)), [Gang-Plank Galleon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0H_gtLBeFo) and so many more. This was winning for a very brief point in time and I would've been 100% happy with it.

#Ambientheads

**2RINITY** (10): Man Tasked With Making Score For Monkey Riding Swordfish Underwater Creates Transcendent Piece of Music

**anothertown** (10): reminds me of the chrono trigger soundtrack (HUGE PRAISE 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍)

**apatel27** (10): Nothing quite like vibing to this while riding a swordfish

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): david wise is a fucking god

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): wow this is incredible. Ever since playing this for the first time, it's what I think about whenever encountering a water level. Jumping in that painting, swimming down to the sunken ship, bouncing on those Goombas? Wow

**letsallpoo** (10): i hope someone posts the hard drive article

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (10): David Wise is a genius. My commentary on Stickerbrush Symphony largely applies here as this piece was definitely the stepping stone that lead to that masterpiece.

**nt96** (10): a masterclass in ambient music found in an underwater level traversed by monkeys? It's more likely than you think!

**pig-serpent** (10): Music that makes you feel like you're floating, staring at the most beautiful coral you've ever seen in your life.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): blub blub i am under the water blub blub

**rslashpoopheads** (10): donkey kong games have some of the most incredible serene soundtracks for how utterly goof ass they are

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This makes me feel like I’m floating

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): still v impressed that a super nintendo game ost could sound so sexy

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): oh wow the title accuracy goes hard

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): this one had colossal ideas. Im hearing bits of Halo 3: ODST in here. rock on SNES 16-bit limitations! made for a winner. i feel like im doing investigative work in a lucasarts point and click classic! hey'd anyone ever play LA noir? love that drone ditty. would've won ez.

**flibbityflob** (9.6): Okay. Okay. So. David Wise wrote a masterpiece, but it’s written on one of the most impressive limitations of all time. And also not a limitation. The SNES used this sound chip called the S-SMP, developed by Sony. It allowed for eight channels of sound to be played at once, and nobody’s ever really used it like Wise did on this track (a blatant lie, some of the best soundtracks of all time came from the SNES, but I have a fondness for Aquatic Ambience). Eight channels doesn’t seem like a lot, and it wasn’t, and he was very limited by the restraints of the chip, but it wasn’t connected to the CPU and it was an individual chip with EIGHT CHANNELS. It’s insane how ground-breaking that was. This score is astonishing, and this track stands as a piece of music that everyone of a certain group will know, a piece of ambient music that sounds just as fresh now as it did when DKC released.

**akanewasright** (9): I like how this is equal parts tranquil and dangerous, it’s the right way to approach water level music… like idk who the New Super Mario composers thought they were fooling with that pretty ass water music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): All this potassium making me contemplate things…

**notdallin** (9): am I ascending??? Or sinking?????

**qazz23** (9): prefer Stickerbrush but this is good also, very relaxing and fits the title perfectly

**throwaway-7650** (9): the round at the beginning pleek

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): “I'm a Genesis guy Sega for life ... But this song hits hard” - YouTube user Amateur Everything, 1 month ago

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): this is proto-dreampunk

**BasedButta** (8): very elegant this is good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i remember this being better

**Exaltatus** (8): This is way prettier than it has any right to be.

**runaway3212** (8): me and the girls when we say "water levels have the worst levels but the best music"

**vayyiqra** (8): Never got the hype over this game's soundtrack; overall I like Donkey Kong 64's soundtrack better. Was going to say shoutout to Eveline Fischer, who composed a lot of the music for this game (and was also the voice of Joanna in Perfect Dark, one of my favourite games ever) but she didn't write this track! Sad! Anyway yeah it does deliver on the "ambient" part so that's cool. Proto-climatewave and seapunk [citation needed]

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Developers always have to go ham on underwater music cause they know gamers fucking HATE those levels so they have to balance it out

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): was not expecting Donkey Kong to have a new age spa song here lol

**1998tweety** (7): this is giving a bit more space than it is aquatic

**celladonn** (7): mmm that ambiance sure is aquatic

**fortyfive33** (7): how are we considering the OG version of this but the SSBB stickerbrush

**hikk** (7): it's pretty.... stickerbrush symphony og kind of robbed though

**PhloxInvar** (7): I think it's decent, it does a water-y feel quite well. But that's it.

**Rigumaro** (7): This is funny, but listening it after what I wrote about the Disco Elysium one, this song makes me feel like I just moved to that city, and I am still struggling and still wondering if I made a mistake.

**shipperondeck** (7): dkc has pretty nice music huh

**Slaycoco** (7): A Vibe

**slimboyfriend** (7): this came on and I assumed it was from an indie game without looking at the title

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): its just the vibes y’know

#Stuck in the Water Temple

**skargardin** (6): hm

**bigbigbee** (5.5): Ambient is right

**BebeLuigi** (5): It's fine, It's just that I think it's failing to give a lasting impression beyond being appropriate for its level

**welcome2thejam** (5): Can't say this is the kind of DK music I really like

**impla77** (4.1): is indeed ambience

**ricki** (4): zzz

**frogaranaman** (3): FUCK WATER LEVELS!!!!

**Zypker125** (2.7): Another song that I’m confused what the appeal is? This song can’t decide between whether it wants to be chill/relaxing or eerie/suspenseful, and its constant ping-pong between these two extremes really is a musical recipe for disaster.

Though I absolutely love this track, perhaps this might've done better with one of the season themes. In-game it's closely tied to the event itself (as meaningless as it is, it's definitely beautiful). While that normally wouldn't be an issue, I feel there were a lot of tracks of that type that got voted in which might've dropped it a little. Still! It made day 2 so I suppose people enjoyed it enough regardless! Stardew has blown up among so many friends of mine that hardly even touch gaming and every element is fined tuned to make the perfect farming game (except fishing. Fuck fishing). I was a fan from back with Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, so I'm ecstatic at how much this game revitalized the series (and made it easier to explain the appeal of a game where you do 'mundane' things like farm. The fact that ConcernedApe basically did all the work is mindblowing.

#Farmheads

**letsallpoo** (11): My vagina is shaking. I love this song.

**1998tweety** (10): CLASSIC

**apatel27** (10): It's so calm but not in a boring Minecraft way

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Maybe I should go outside sometime.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): poohascend

**Exaltatus** (10): Such a beautiful game and a particularly memorable moment from it.

**nt96** (10): oh this is just gorgeous

**runaway3212** (10): I get why everybody loves this

**sarcasticsobs** (10): To have a life or to start a third round of Stardew Valley, that is indeed the question...

**seanderlust** (10): like the game itself, this song is so soothing and nice. I love it (and this game) so very much

**skargardin** (10): stardew valley ost my beloved

**throwaway-7650** (10): I love ambient music

**welcome2thejam** (10): So fyi, this is the theme to an in-game event that marks the end of summer in Stardew Valley. There's a bittersweet feeling here perfectly matches the tone, of everyone getting together for something fleeting and impermanent and yet so beautiful. Combine that with the ending text of "The glow of summer has faded now... and moonlight jellies carry on toward the great unknown" set to the sound of crashing waves, and the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies made me super nostalgic for carefree summers gone by in a way that absolutely destroyed me. Magical, legit had to move to my bed and think for a good twenty minutes. And a completely unexpected reaction too, like this first happened to me while playing during real life winter, on my sixth playthrough of this scene lol

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): again bringing up jason schreier, reading about the development of Stardew Valley is insane. that guy was obsessed with his product and had insane levels of support and familial/social investment in what he was doing. good on him

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): the waves softly hitting your ears... my skin cleared and grades went up immediately

**akanewasright** (9.5): idk stardew at all but if this isn’t music you have a long, meaningful conversation with someone to in the game, it’s a waste

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): one day i will play this game and i will love it

**notdallin** (9.3): I could actually see this being on some critically acclaimed ambient album

**2RINITY** (9): Is this what lesbians hear the moment they realize they've found the one

**pig-serpent** (9): Oh, this is super chill. This would make excellent sleep music!

**turtle\_on\_mars** (9): what if...we touched hands...next to the jellyfish...on the evening of summer 28th...

**impla77** (8.1): enchanting

**hikk** (8): this is really pretty! i've tried to play stardew like 4 times now and i've never been able to get into it, but

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): whoa what timing, how topical

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): The lo-fi bits hit just right.

**PhloxInvar** (8): Sparkle. Twinkle. Ripple.

**Rigumaro** (8): Immediately transports me to the world of the game. It feels a bit generic, but it just gives me so much peace.

**shipperondeck** (8): nice

**Slaycoco** (8): Pretty song; useless event! But now we said it.

**vayyiqra** (8): Feeling guilty yet again about my Switch that I bought last year which I played exactly once with my friend. I haven't seen him for months and I got it so we could play together so that's very sad :( Anyway because this question seems to come up a lot among fans, I assume I will marry Abigail.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Feels very space-y

**diamondsandglass** (7.5): so peaceful

**fortyfive33** (7): I just can't get into this game no matter how hard I try

**qazz23** (7): relaxing, peaceful

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I'm Jelly Baby

**TragicKingdom1** (7): doing this rate kinda feels like rating the playlist of ambient music i use to block out the world around me in an airport

#Watched the September Direct

**flibbityflob** (6.2): I’m gonna be real here lads, I like to play stardew with the soundtrack off because whilst the soundtrack is impressive, it’s just not for me.

**anothertown** (6): alright i love stardew valley and i get that the whole thing was that eric barone did everything himself but i think he could have left the dinky ass music up to somebody else.

**BasedButta** (6): pretty, but that’s it really you gotta be in the mood for it

**celladonn** (6): if i was a moonlight jelly i probably would dance to this but sadly i am a human so i remain motionless

**frogaranaman** (6): very proud of the depressed gamers out there who banded together and voted this in

**shhhneak** (6): This is cute! Thank god I never got into this game.

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): the way i genuinely fell asleep to this as i was rushing to do the rate last minute during the extension period

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): sorry if im coming across as harsh in my scores for these more mellow pieces but idk maybe i just want more excitement in my video game music

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I never played this game because I have Farmville trauma. I imagine this works very well in context but I don’t really care for it outside of it.

**Zypker125** (3.8): If one could plagiarize “every sleep music sounds video ever” and make it into a song this would be it

**theonewithoutmynudes** (3.6): really pretty bland for me personally but I do love stardew

Though getting this high up in a field is nothing to scoff at, I feel like this underperformed a bit? Especially considering the dominance Pokemon fans showed at the rate voting. Sure, the track is a bit hectic, but it feels so carefully composed to inspire fear in the hearts of any trainers approaching the champion's room. (Or have stumbled onto someone's beachfront villa by accident). 

Though this is an easy 10 (and close 11), my favourite Champion Theme is actually probably [Iris's from B2/W2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb9ee9lWSbg), You also have to appreciate the classic [Lance Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbXOyXaJJBc) from Gold and Silver. And shoutout to the underrated [Battle at the Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dkK9r57BNk) from Sun and Moon as well.

#Champions

**throwaway-7650** (11): she's so mother

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): it's not my favorite in the rate but it's at #2 right behind the botw guardian theme on my list of video game themes that activate my fight or flight response

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Nintendo made one transcendently bad bitch, saw all the “step on me mommy” fanart, and decided to never be difficult again.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): iconic franchise

**hikk** (10): have lost nuzlockes to her before and it's painful but i was still shaking ass

**Rigumaro** (10): I actually don't have nostalgia for this theme, because I didn't play D&P until last year lol. But this song really goes, and it's very dynamic. And the way it implements the classic melodies into it.

**runaway3212** (10): I wanted to give this my 11 but alas some songs were simply better

**sarcasticsobs** (10): “I always wondered what this sounded like without the constant health low sound” - YouTube user Michael Kelley, 5 months ago

**seanderlust** (10): wait holy shit this actually goes off. i want a theme as banger as this is

**shhhneak** (10): I remember when I first battled this bitch and the drums kicked in as she sent out her Spiritomb—a Pokemon I’d never even seen before. I knew then I was doomed. Not my favourite battle theme in Pokemon but the quintessential Champion music.

**skargardin** (10): queen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): pokemon peaked with diamond and pearl in general but especially when it came to the music

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Not everyone deserves to be called mommy. But some force you so deeply into submission you have no choice.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): i think og that bomberman 64 soundtrack comment where a fella mentions how his mom just wanted him to play the main menu music over and over. for some internet ppl, it's a seminal drum n' bass classic. this should be to. lotta ideas well documented.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): kinda hyperpop

**shipperondeck** (9.5): yeah this is just iconic, minus half a point for being jumpscared by porn of her on twitter more than once

**Stryxen** (9.5): noone will ever do it like cynthia, zara larsson and ava max wanna be her so bad

**2RINITY** (9): Cool Pokémon fact: No one has ever said "Step on me, Mommy" to Cynthia because she stomps everyone to death before they even get the chance

**anothertown** (9): ok shes hot

**AzettImpa** (9): gosh I can hear the low health sound…

**diamondsandglass** (9): Cynthia!!

**qazz23** (9): intense

**Slaycoco** (9): Iconic. Simply iconic. Cynthia stepped on all of us and we said thank you.

**turtle\_on\_mars** (8.5): this may slap but I think Cynthia slaps harder

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): alright fess up how many pokemon fans had cynthia as their big titty goth gf

**1998tweety** (8): she ate

**bigbigbee** (8): I WISH THAT I HAD A BOSS THEME SO BADLY!!!!!! I literally listen to the first few seconds of Pokémon boss themes to hype myself up for things (though the Pokemon RS May/Brendan theme is my weapon of choice for nostalgia reasons)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): overrated a tad

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): that shark guy is so funny, what's his deal? Are those missiles? Can he fire those?

**rslashpoopheads** (8): this is good but Steven ate her up

**impla77** (7.5): slay

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Why in the remakes did they simplify everything about the game, but then made Cynthia even HARDER

**BasedButta** (7): it stays in your head but thats it

**BebeLuigi** (7): This ost is a tiny bit overrated by the fandom in my opinion... It's good I just think it's not that good dsqfsdfsqf

**Exaltatus** (7): I mean yes this slaps but can we talk about how Pokemon is obviously dogfighting?

**flibbityflob** (7): Cynthia, hiiiiiiii I’m a lesbian and you’re very hot and I would like to hang out some time if that’s amenable to you hahahaha….yes I AM twirling my hair… And how tall ARE you??

**vayyiqra** (7): Eh. Is this better than the original Red/Blue/Yellow battle theme? That ruled. Still good though it's tense.

#There's no running from a trainer battle!

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): never got into pokemon somehow :gasp:

**2specific4google** (6.5): - Her encounter theme is better!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I love Pokémon and Cynthia is a baddie but the battle music blends together for me unfortunately

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.1): I never really did get that into the battle themes in Pokemon

**StroHersh** (6): - much prefer other songs in this game...

**welcome2thejam** (6): Mentally preparing myself for the amount of times I'll see "mommy" in the comment section

**notdallin** (5.6): I’m in the car right now and it’s very stressful in here now

**PhloxInvar** (4.5): I think this song kind of falls under a category of songs in this rate that you need the context otherwise it doesn't make sense. I believe Cynthia is one of the hardest trainers you have to fight in this specific Pokemon game I believe, and that makes this intensity to the sound much more resonant than it does by itself. Still, I didn't the play the game so it just sounds like a decent battle theme, but that's about it.

**Zypker125** (4.1): YOU CAN’T RUN AWAY FROM TRAINER BATTLES!

**apatel27** (4): Is this theme really that good or was Gen IV your first pokemon game?

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (4): I'm exhausted just sitting here listening to this. Way too busy and unfocused.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I do not understand the appeal of the battle themes, they're all anxiety-inducing to me. The only battle theme I can bop to is the Hoenn Elite Four theme.

**celladonn** (3): honestly this is a pretty boring battle theme

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): 🤐

Coconut Mall is an extremely fun track and one of the best coming from the Wii. However, I don't love the track as much as some of the others (though I really still enjoy it). It's defifnitely leaning on the hectic more than the fun side of karting. Those Miis' blank stares as they try to run you down with their cars at the end haunts my nightmares

#Mall Rats

**1998tweety** (10): i wanna go there

**akanewasright** (10): THEE slay, anyone who tells you otherwise missed out on some core childhood experiences

**anothertown** (10): the way this goes crazy on lap 3

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Do we think that COVID-19 killed Coconut Mall or had it already succumbed to changing economic norms by then?

**cremeebrulee** (10): you just got C O C O N U T M A L L E D share this with all your friends to totally coconut mall them

**CrimsonROSET** (10): iconic

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the cupcakke remix is an 11

**frogaranaman** (10): why is this not the WAP mashup version

**hikk** (10): "meme" song, but it just gives

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): what a jam, this rules so hard

**nt96** (10): The good ol days of playing online and seeing Vader and Hitler plastered on the posters

**qazz23** (10): love the 🎷, definitely feels like you're inside a mall

**RandomHypnotica** (10): someone probably fucked on a beach to this song

**Roxieloxie** (10): banger of the fucking century

**sarcasticsobs** (10): “i bass boosted it and it suprisingly sounds pretty good” - YouTube user big man, 2 weeks ago

**seanderlust** (10): me and the girlies listening to coconut mall

**stupidslappa** (10): Right in my playlist.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): you know those big historical events that are so important you remember exactly where you were when you first heard the news? coconut mall getting confirmed for mario kart dlc was one of those moments for me

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): GOGOGOGOGOGOGOOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGGOOGOGOGOGOG COMON HSUTLE FUCK FUCKUFCKUFCKUFKCUFJKFASIOfhSEIOJFSEKJHGFSIDFLPKSJEIFH NOZNOPONONNOON GET BACK HERE RED IM GONNA GET YR AS-WEHAOIFJA BANANA PEEL OH MOTHER FJWDP(UWQ(*DUI. [lietoc has been ejected from gaming on a wii]. brilliant auto 10; real gamer music taking lounge vibes to sorta deranged extremes; even a lil' boom stop clap + hyperrealist sound design here (that's when the game sounds are added to the real track; listen to Noah Creshvensky's Orange Milk tape, you'll see) anyways lets celebrate in style! wii remote fails! good stuff! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_uXEWKdsTY

**Zypker125** (10): Accurately depicts the vibe of a free-for-all Black Friday

**throwaway-7650** (9.8): shaking in anticipation over this in winners

**shipperondeck** (9): i got jumpscared by a coconut mall "shortcut tutorial" on youtube but wasn't scared of it bc they left this song playing in the background even during the jumpscare and i thought it was funny

**vayyiqra** (9): What a wacky theme! It sure is zany. This is about what one would expect from a stage called "Coconut Mall".

**welcome2thejam** (9): Can't believe this rate was a setup to Coconut Mall dozens of unsuspecting pophead raters

**flibbityflob** (8.9): YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): plays piano limpwristly

**2specific4google** (8.3): - Meme song I guess? But there's so much cool shit happening with the instrumentation! It really is a joy to listen to.

**notdallin** (8.1): somehow the classiest yet silliest, busiest yet most light-hearted track of (still somehow) newest Mario kart game

**2RINITY** (8): I never noticed how good this song was as a kid because I was too busy trying not to get run over by those idiot Miis at the end of the lap. You people aren't even important enough to be 3D models! You're sprites! Get out of the road!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this song and course are fun as hell, but imo there's a lot of other better mario kart themes that could've been in the rate instead, like waluigi pinball

**impla77** (8): iconic, the vibe is just so correct

**plastichaxan** (8): need Rosalía on this beat fr

**Rigumaro** (8): I love this vibe. This cheered me up.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): it absolutely is iconic but it's never been my favourite mario kart track (in both senses)

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7.5): It's a bop. Has a bit of a Benny Hill slapstick in there.

**Exaltatus** (7): It's giving yakety sax energy.

**runaway3212** (7): I love this but the memes were literally never funny

**skargardin** (7): I saw a tiktok stating how aurora's cure for me interpolates this and.. I don't hear it?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh-uh! Uh! Smack my ass smackmyasslikeadrum!

#Sunday Drivers

**steelstepladder** (6.5): the weaker of the Mario Kart tracks

**Stryxen** (6): iconic but kinda not that good

**celladonn** (5): this does make me feel like i'm having a panic attack in a mall, i'll give it that

**Slaycoco** (5): Outstanding racetrack, overrated song I fear…

**theonewithoutmynudes** (4.5): didn't love it

**BebeLuigi** (4): Quite frankly I never got why it's so popular beyond it being a meme song and I still don't fsqfqsfdq

**StroHersh** (4): - is this really your pick or do you just like memes too much

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): circus music goes harder

**flava** (1): this is such a happy song and i hate it, why can’t my Mario Kart songs be melancholic and have piano

**apatel27** (0): Genuinely don't understand why people like this. It a dread inducing song that builds and builds with a sound like a psycho clown is gonna show up but it's supposed to be happy???

**rslashpoopheads** (0): which one of you little gay terrorists entered this

Though the music of the Sonic franchise is one of the few consistent bright points of the series, I can't find myself caring about this track. It's almost too ubiquitous to enjoy fully. It's still iconic and not a bad listen, but I would've much rather preferred almost any other Sonic track over this one

---

#NEED4SPEED

**vayyiqra** (11): Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the first video games I ever played, something that's been around as long as I can remember. many happy hours spent with my brothers playing it and Sonic II. This quirky little theme makes me happy, you know? :') I have to 11 it, it's too important.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**2l82bstr8** (10): [this is the version I'm listening to in my head (and it's my unofficial 11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Yxt9bIf)

**akanewasright** (10): I’m giving this a 10 out of solidarity, where were the sonic fans in the submission thread??? I was being harassed off Reddit, what’s your excuse for not submitting rooftop run?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just think of all the pages and pages of erotica that eventually spawned from those mounds of green…

**celladonn** (10): yeah this still slays

**Exaltatus** (10): I can't stop myself from hearing the No Drug Like Me lyrics every time I hear the Green Hill Zone now. It has no right working as well as it does. https://youtu.be/k2Yxt9bIf_M

**frogaranaman** (10): I sucked at this game so much. literally could never get past the first zone. I never knew how to save a game file as a kid too so I would restart this process every single time I would visit my grandparent's house. the pinball level of this game ruined my life

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Iconic.

**qazz23** (10): so nostalgic, one of the best first level themes, gotta go fast!!! (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): literally one of the most iconic melodies in gaming

**Rigumaro** (10): God this is my childhood. I can't be unbiased. Nostalgia chills even to this day. But I legit think it's an incredible song.

**Roxieloxie** (10): my good friend has been holding me hostage for almost a year now to learn about sonic lore and tbh i now know more about sonic adventure 2 than i ever thought i would in my life

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ahh the good ole days when the sonic games were just as good as sonic’s music

**throwaway-7650** (10): wendywilliamsthatwasaclassic.gif

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): stone cold classic. Anyways, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7zPlQjAr8 you know this "remix" did a LOT to move the conversation forward about what we were accomplishing with music on the internet.

**2specific4google** (9.2): - It's a great song just on the strength of its melody alone. (By now you might be able to tell, but melody is the thing I usually care about the most in VGM, and particularly for classic games).

**anothertown** (9): sanic

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): a lot better than the butt rock vocal themes of 2000s sonic

**hikk** (9): the first sonic game i ever played was Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) for the Game Boy Advance and i think im entitled to financial compsenation for that ... but it does still bop

**Hulnia** (9): it’s kinda weird without lil nas x on it for me tbh

**nt96** (9): Mario hears this in his nightmares

**PhloxInvar** (9): This song is just so charming. It feels so fresh and inviting. Adventurous and speedy, but it's not particularly fast by any means. Even though I like the vibes of Studiopolis more, Green Hill Zone is iconic for a reason.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): my only exposure to Sonic content is a YouTube channel that makes fun skits so I don’t know much about the franchise, but this song so good goes hard etc.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): It's better than the Super Mario Bros. theme that's for sure

**welcome2thejam** (9): A classic, but I'll be sitting here in the back sadly waving my Emerald Hill Zone flag

**flibbityflob** (8.9): Iconic.

**notdallin** (8.6): how high did the creators have to be to make their protagonist an incredibly fast… hedgehog!

**BebeLuigi** (8): I say this as a proud Sonic anti but this slaps

**DefaultPophead** (8): I'm a beta male.

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): the whiplash from going from silent hill 2 to this is very funny, I love that. Also this is kind of a bop.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): Too much blast processing. Chilli dogs make you fart, you know?

**runaway3212** (8): I love how gotta go fast this is

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8): a very bright and shiny sounding song if that makes sense

**impla77** (7.9): nice and catchy

**2RINITY** (7.5): It's been run into the ground with all the remakes, but at the same time, I get why it's such a classic. Also gets a bonus half-point for inspiring Crawling In My Hill Zone

**sarcasticsobs** (7): ““Don't sit there and waste your precious time. When you want to do something, do it right away. Do it when you can. It's the only way to live a life without regrets.”~ Sonic the hedgehog.” - YouTube user Hydek.B, 1 year ago

**skargardin** (7): I can't be too mad at this!

**Slaycoco** (7): Classique.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Ok yes a classic, but it drags after the second run-through

**Stryxen** (7): Sonic's character design unsettles me but a good song is a good song

#UR2SLOW

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I am the Dr Eggman

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): don't have nostalgia for this and so i don't find myself caring about it too much

**apatel27** (6): Casino Night Zone is better

**bigbigbee** (6): SONIC WAS ROBBED IN VGV, I cry, while proceeding to rob him here

**CrimsonROSET** (6): get more material why is it always green hill zone so many others deserve to be here instead

**indie\_fan\_** (5.5): idk, something about this always mildly irritated me

**Zypker125** (4.2): Sorry, I never understood the appeal of this song. The sounds used in the song are just too annoying to me, and I don’t really like the layering of the song.

**shipperondeck** (2): im a hater zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz this shit annoying as fuck zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz also sonic mpreg in the queup = TANKED

**shhhneak** (0): Sonic (derogatory)

**1998tweety** (11): SLAYED, the games here ate

**anothertown** (11): they dont call it Dragon Quest 11 for nothing

**AzettImpa** (11): Dragon Quest XI!!!

**BasedButta** (11): honestly both are fine but I have to honor the strategy rpgs

**Blazingscourge** (11): Persona, Pokémon, Final Fantasy, etc. Do I need to say more?

**flibbityflob** (11): given i am playing the jugdral dualogy and those are emulated fan translated SNES games i have insanity for one

**RandomHypnotica** (11): i want to get JRPG tattooed on my chest

**rona NG+** (11): I like taking my time and thinking things through! They also have the best stories

**runaway3212** (11): i stan pokemon

**shhhneak** (11): Pokémon turning to real time action would be my 9/11.

**shipperondeck** (11): this was easy. fire emblem changed my life. NEXT

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): objectively one of the best genres of games

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I say this like I haven't only played one turn-based RPG in my life (the pokey man)

**welcome2thejam** (11): Honestly, the toughest since both these genres are in my top five, but I just can't get enough Scrimblo Bimblo & their merry crew

**apatel27** (0): When it's good it's great (XCOM) but most of the time these kind of games are just frustrating to play.

**DefaultPophead** (0): This was the hardest category.

**frogaranaman** (0): boring!!!!!!! takes too much time

**nt96** (0): I would love to get into this subgenre, but that day is not today

**qazz23** (0): sry not a true 0, love oldschool FF's

**slimboyfriend** (0): I still love you, Dragon Quest XIS: Echoes of An Elusive Age; Definitive Edition for the Nintendo Switch

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): really depends on game

**vayyiqra** (0): Aside from Pokemon I can't remember ever getting into these much. Shoutout to chess though which I do play a lot and is kind of the blueprint for games like this [citation NOT needed]

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (0): i'm lying really i love them, but i'm, taking a chance on action rpgs this time

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (0): scared of these

**apatel27** (11): Strategy without the boredom and annoying menu crawling of turn based rpgs.

**DefaultPophead** (11): This was the hardest category.

**frogaranaman** (11): quick. good pacing

**JayElecHanukkah** (11): this is a very tough one because I love turn-based RPGs, but I think I have to go with the action version since the Souls franchise might be my all-time favourite. I think I'd say Bloodborne is my all-time favourite game, so I can't in good conscious vote against it.

**nt96** (11): I like my games to with a dash of spontaneity and RPGs are no exception

**qazz23** (11): Souls / Diablo 4 life

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): I grew up with Elder Scrolls this 11 is purely for that

**vayyiqra** (11): Idk I don't play a lot of RPGs but real-time combat is more fun to me. Why wait around? Also some shooters are arguably these are well [citation needed] and I like shooters.

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (11): so fun, quite hard to get into and far too intense for my little anxious heart but they are fun to watch and play

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (11): i play these

**Zypker125** (11): There's nothing better than mashing controller buttons to beat the shit out of easy CPUs

**anothertown** (0): i literally go back and forth on this so much because i prefer real-time combat and a lot of action RPGs are my guilty pleasure games (the modern assassins creeds, genshin impact, skyrim) but so many of the ones i have played just do not come together as satisfying games imo.

**AzettImpa** (0): very very close… Bayonetta is the best one tbh. They sometimes do feel same-ish though

**Blazingscourge** (0): but only because I suck at the souls series.

**flibbityflob** (0): not you xenoblade chronicles 3 you're perfect and i'm playing you but i have to follow my core

**indie\_fan\_** (0): very much depends, but they can be mindless fun the majority of the time

**LesApfels** (0): I get overwhelmed ok?

**RandomHypnotica** (0): ok i love me some soulsborne games but like… jrpg’s

**rona NG+** (0): my hands do not move fast enough for this

**runaway3212** (0): i stan pokemon

**shhhneak** (0): I am terrible at most of these. I play Skyrim to explore and beat the shit out of everything on easy.

**shipperondeck** (0): can't imagine this winning on popheads but maybe i'll be surprised/disappointed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i dont think ive ever played an action based rpg i’ve actually enjoyed

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Too complicated

**welcome2thejam** (0): Action Adventure might have gotten the 11

Smash has done many fantastic remixes, but I don't think any will match how memorable this one was. Though it can attribute a large part of its memorability to its appearance in the Subspace Emissary from Brawl. I'm with a few of the other commentators that prefers the DKC original, but this is so well done it almost feels like a completely different track and is still an easy 10 for me.

---

#Bring Back Subspace!

**2specific4google** (11): - AMAZING ARRANGEMENT. Why is it so emotional?? I'm just trying to punch dudes offscreen! I'll always remembering running back and forth through this area in the final leg of Subspace Emissary.

**cremeebrulee** (11): this managed to steal my 11 from some nostalgic choices here, but WHEW it fucking ate. it reminds me of anime opening in the best sort of way, it just sounds so fresh and cinematic.

**rslashpoopheads** (11): music peaked here

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Still in disbelief this actually made it in. One of my favorite video game songs ever. This particular section of Subspace Emissary was a VERY long and VERY confusing maze, and I’m pretty sure getting to listen to this on repeat was the only reason I didn’t go insane. It’s beautiful and wistful and nostalgic and melancholic all at once. I love it so much.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): the best use of pizzicato strings in a video game, among us who

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I have so many good memories of sub space emissary because I did it with my cousin who sucks at videogames so when he went home I’d just beat the level on my own and next time he came around we’d continue the story

**hikk** (10): ahhh i love both this version and the og... #JUSTICEFORSUBSPACEEMISSARY it was my fave as a kid!

**nt96** (10): I just know that Moloko's clawing at the door, desperately trying to get into the recording studio

**PhloxInvar** (10): Honestly, I think this is a contender for winning the whole thing. It just winner energy. I'm rooting for Disco Elysium, but I wouldn't be mad at all if this got to the end. It just feels so... powerful.

**pig-serpent** (10): Donkey Kong Country 2 both ignited my love for 2D platformers and my love for videogame music. I think the fact that this song is still a 10 and probably not in the top 50% of the game's soundtrack speaks for itself. I never would've expected the acoustic guitar to work so well on this song, but the Brawl remix is a fantastic reworking and showcases how a remix can leave the greatness of the original intact while taking it in a different direction.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i would kill for a proper subspace emissary sequel

**shhhneak** (10): Waking up and checking the Smash Bros DOJO like its was a morning newspaper was one of the best experiences of my life.

**shipperondeck** (10): this was my favorite song in 8th grade :((

**Slaycoco** (10): Gorgeous. That is all.

**throwaway-7650** (10): FINAL DESTINATION!

**bigbigbee** (9): so good it briefly convinced me that “stickerbrush” is a real plant

**Exaltatus** (9): Weirdly manages to be both so energetic and calming. Definitely one of my fave songs from Subspace Emissary.

**qazz23** (9): slightly prefer the original, but this version is more suited for a fighting game

**Rigumaro** (9): This is weird, I don't remember this song but I played a lot of Brawl. Either way, it's amazing, I have no clue how I could have forgotten this.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): “The original Stickerbush Symphony is an absolutely serene masterpiece of video game music, and has its place in my heart too. However, this remix takes the groundwork layed down by David Wise and derives a wild, adventurous, and heart warming and invigorating song that I'm not sure has any equals. There is no doubt in my mind, even after nearly a decade of listening to various artists since first hearing this song, that this is one of the greats among the greats among the greats of video game scores.” - YouTube user Nitroxity, 2 years ago

**welcome2thejam** (9): When that guitar came in I screamed, when the strings came in I screamed again

**whatsalanka** (9): The tropical freeze credits jazzy version would be a 10 for me!

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): the absolute childhood trauma of when i got this from gamestop when i was little and my mom watched the cutscenes and thought it was too dark for me and made me return it

**flibbityflob** (8.3): Nintendo games and Spanish guitars, name a more iconic duo.

**2RINITY** (8): This brings back fond vivid memories of DK and Diddy running around beating up Goombas and Koopas until they run into Fox McCloud

**BebeLuigi** (8): Bring back the Subspace Emissary

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): We love Diddy! We love Dixie! We love their cute little hats!

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): it's pretty good

**skargardin** (8): oh go off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is FAR from the best remix smash bros has given us (MELEE FOUNTAIN OF DREAMS DESERVED) but this is still nice to listen to

**notdallin** (7): is this not called Bramble Blast? I’m so confused

**runaway3212** (7): I love diddy kong

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): the original would have been a 10

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): smash? more like pass

#Tripping

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.5): I am familiar with the DKC version but had never heard this version and I sadly do not love it

**fortyfive33** (6): og better

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (6): This part of the rate really really hurts. Stickerbrush Symphony is a masterpiece of the SNES era, but unfortunately the Super Smash Bros. Brawl version is anything but. This version has sucked out everything that made the original so fantastic. It sounds like the whole thing was recreated using the most boring General MIDI synth they could find. The instrumentation has lost all of its soul, all of the defining timbrel evolution is gone. The skittery percussion changes the mood from the floaty ambiance of the original to something something hectic and uncalming. The original piece demonstrated Wise's virtuosity with the SPC700; this piece has no business being _this good_ on _this chip_. The wavetable pads and evolving timbres are in a league of their own on the SNES and few, if any, other composers used these techniques nearly as skillfully as Wise did on this piece. The only other piece with this much artistically skillful use of the SPC700 in this way is Wise's own Aquatic Ambiance from the previous DKC entry. If we were rating the original version of Stickerbrush Symphony, it would have easily and unquestionably gotten my 11 but, unfortunately, I'm left with the despair that is this butchered milquetoast recreation. :(

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah this is fine, I like the beat, but there is much better music from this series (where Dream Land theme?).

**Zypker125** (6): I’m shocked that this received the most votes during the nominating stage. This song is the definition of lacking cohesion, nothing about it flows or transitions well and even though I enjoy its high-energy moments, the confusing mixing choices prevent me from enjoying this song.

**StroHersh** (5): - original better

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (5): why this one? was the melee edition of corneria just too busy?

**frogaranaman** (4): I'm SO sorry but this sounds like a Hamilton instrumental

**Stryxen** (4): this was like my favourite game when it came out i played it so much. Why do i have no memory of this track at all

**impla77** (3.7): doesn’t do much for me

**apatel27** (3): It's missing the signature Donkey Kong styling that make those soundtracks so good

**TragicKingdom1** (0): brawl was an ugly game and that extended to the music

I was a little worried that a 9 minute song (especially one that was second on the list) would be cut much earlier than it ought to be. And while it just missed the top 10 (songs 13 to 8 were all within 4 points of each other), it still did much better than I was expecting! Celeste is another on my 'to-play-list-at-some-point', but this track is absolutely beautiful. It takes a bit to build up, but once it does it transcends to a whole new level.

---

#Patient Gamers

**DaHumanTorch** (11): the best song in the rate being from the best game ever yupppppp

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I’d like to hear an art pop girl sing over this!!! Hearing this track second honestly turned my whole mind around in the concept of this rate and the music I’d be hearing. I’m typing my comments after scoring everything and happy to say so much cool music here! This one is awesome, enveloping synth music. Gonna check out this OST.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (11): Lena Raine nailed it for the entire Celeste OST. The evolving atmosphere and timbers takes this piece on a journey from introspective melancholy, to intrigue, to an urgent climax. The melody and motifs hold weight, both musically and from character building perspective. The percussion punctuates each section and feels both mechanical and organic at the same time. This piece just makes me want to go back and play Celeste every time I hear it.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): The build Lena Raine constructs in this… her power! Can’t even talk about it! The 5:53 transition!!!

**1998tweety** (10): this is so good omg. I'm ascending, descending, un-aliving, AND resurrecting!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now here’s song that makes me want to eat strawberries and spend some time contemplating my various anxieties and fears.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): iconic

**fortyfive33** (10): couldn't go wrong with any selection here

**hikk** (10): lena raine is so talented!!! i've not played celeste but i absolutely adore her contributions to the newer minecraft soundtracks (nether soundtrack has me fully in my dark ambient stan era) and this is also slaying. it's long, but i can only imagine this being a slay to hear in game.

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): whoa I love aphex twin, is this selected ambient works volume 2.5

**plastichaxan** (10): I was dreading this being so long but the switch ups slayed omg

**RandomHypnotica** (10): hidden indie gem

**runaway3212** (10): just an absolute slay of intrige and boppiness, I expect celeste to kick her self doubt of the mountain during this song (never played celeste btw)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I really need to play this game, this piece is so evocative even without context

**shipperondeck** (10): worth the nearly 10-minute ride

**skargardin** (10): Lena Raine is so mother for this calming bop

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): at first I thought this was cute and sparkly then the percussion came in and it got a lil spooky and then it switched up again loved it

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this goes hard. also I stan Lena Raine for making a separate Chicory album with calmer tracks only so you don't get blasted with Probably Ancient Evil (a 10) while relaxing/sleeping.

**throwaway-7650** (10): (dear god let me be wrong... PLEEK) songeniality

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): just when I thought it was over she pulls me back in (and again and again)

**seanderlust** (9.3): this is hypnotizing

**2RINITY** (9): This song is like 9 and a half minutes and yet it earns its runtime with constant variety and an interesting progression and goddammit am I gonna have to play this now instead of just watching other people make memes about it on Twitter

**akanewasright** (9): I don’t know anything about this game except for trans rights, and also that this song rules

**anothertown** (9): the whole last half of this is so cunt. this soundtrack is Lena Raine's magnum opus fr

**celladonn** (9): such a cool spooky vibe

**vayyiqra** (9): I watched Hana played this game on Twitch and should really try it myself, it looks so pretty and this light and airy but mysterious music fits the aesthetic well.

**flibbityflob** (8.8): Lena Raine, your MIND. There’s a synth that kicks in at 2:40, and it’s one of the best parts of the soundtrack, because it sounds just…grimy and horrible and when you consider where you are in the game, it’s so fitting. The piano melody also allows for such incredible countermelody (which I’m always writing as I listen to this soundtrack, sorry), and it fits what I’d argue might be Celeste’s darkest moment, a place of loneliness and confusion, where you’re alone and working through an ever shifting world (the combination of game mechanics and score). And then it shifts into the second part, where you’re chased by yourself in a world that almost doesn’t fit you. One of the best parts of this score is the very low bass notes throughout, something not just in this piece but that feel especially effective within the context of a level defined by the dark purples and blacks. It’s just so good. Watch a Celeste speedrun, by the way, and watch Madeline move in time with the music, so so cool.

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): this is really pretty, maybe a tad too long, but i am definitely interested enough to check out the game

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): this one is for the indie girls

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): sometimes you just need a 10 minute long slay

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): yeah its fine cool beans; like its just 32-bit downtempo done well. y'all ever play metal slug 3 and get stuck on lvl 2? imagine spending $50 on that as a 6 year old in 2k4. plz i beg

**apatel27** (8): This second half is amazing

**Exaltatus** (8): This is great. Love when it starts picking up in the last couple minutes.

**qazz23** (8): nice dreamy feel, i like how the different parts blend seamlessly

**Rigumaro** (8): I can feel like this song is telling me a personal story, if that makes sense. I haven't played the game so I'm not emotionally invested in it, hence my 8. But I could see myself giving it a better score if/when I play it.

**Slaycoco** (8): Never played Celeste but this is really eerie and lovely.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This makes me feel lonely

#Bring Me To Life

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): a little long but the atmosphere is nice

**BasedButta** (7): longsongphobia, I admit it

**BebeLuigi** (7): very nice, love the ambient feeling

**PhloxInvar** (7): This song LONG AF. It's definitely slow at first, which matches the kind of lethargic dream vibes of the chapter it's played in. However, based on Youtube, most people skip to the chase part, which is the most active so fair but that's also five minutes in. Has great vibes, but just way too long.

**Stryxen** (7): so pretty but I feel like I've heard this sound executed a little better

**welcome2thejam** (7): That whole song definitely felt like scaling an entire mountain

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Why are all these incredible games platformers? And if they MUST be platformers, why don’t they provide an option where you can sit in a sad little bubble while your much more talented friend handles the hard part of the level for you?

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The music in Celeste never stood out to me as much as it did for other people, but this song does have my favorite passage in the OST (Those arps in the second half.)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): celeste is a great game but i really dont think the music is anything special in it? this song is fine but for being 9 minutes long it doesnt really do enough to justify its runtime

**impla77** (6): probably good in the context of the game but repetitive otherwise

**rslashpoopheads** (6): okay idk how to rate this because it started off so vile but then it turned into a certified banger

**stupidslappa** (6): I love ambient

**Zypker125** (5.4): The first 2/3rd of the song drag and are too monotonous, but once the climax kicks in the song picks up. Song is way too long though.

**frogaranaman** (5): pretty. nothing totally fucking over the main character is about to happen right

**notdallin** (4.8): after 9 minutes… there better have been MULTIPLE resurrections

And it's a sad day for indie platformers, as we lose both of our big reps back to back. This is a game that's been on my 'to play' list for a while! And though I know very little about the game itself, this is just gorgeous. I can easily imagine hearing this as a piece of solace in an otherwise dangerous world.

#Still Waiting For Silksong

**pig-serpent** (11): I love both Dark Souls and Hollow Knight, but while in Dark Souls the vibe is "this world is already gone, do not cry for it, you do not have the time," Hollow Knight's world is still in the process of dying, and the game tells you that you're allowed to slow down and have emotional reactions to it because you're correct, it is sad that the world is dying. The first time you reach the City of Tears, sit on the bench, and stare out the tower window is one of the most magical moments I've experienced in any video game, and this song is a large part of why.

**Stryxen** (11): wonder and determination through melancholy and loneliness. gorgeoeaurghs

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): there's something incredibly beautiful yet also kinda ominous about this song and i love it, it's what all video game music should be

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Beautiful bleeps…beautiful bloops…

**CrimsonROSET** (10): troye sivan - could cry just thinking about you

**flibbityflob** (10): Hollow Knight is one of the best video games ever produced and so much of that (and very little, too, it is an incredible game) comes from the soundtrack, which makes you feel so much grief and loneliness. You’re just a little bug in a cruel world and yet you’re going to get through. The City of Tears is one of the most beautiful parts of the game, a zone that’s literally sobbing as you experience it, and you have to battle through it because the world’s out to kill you, but this score reminds you that despite that, it’s going to be okay. Through its sacrifice, Hallownest lasts eternal.

**hikk** (10): i think it might be hard to appreciate this beyond just a pleasant listen if you haven't played hollow knight because oh my god... reaching city of tears was just such a MOMENT???? like seeing the peak of this fallen kingdom after the journey through the treacherous areas beforehand, having the game open up to you and reveal its true nature, just fully understanding the LORE behind everything... every time i talk about this game is just me shaking and crying because it's actually just so stellar LITERALLY THE BEST GAME IN EXISTENCE THIS SONG MAKES ME CRY

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): if you hit me with a twinkly piano and go "whooooaaaaa" I'll say "wow this is incredible, no one has ever put so much emotion to audio before"

**PhloxInvar** (10): IT HAS VOCALS RUN!... Jokes aside, it's beautiful.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): beethoven's body was not found in a ditch because christopher larkin ate him up

**Rigumaro** (10): One of those songs that instantly brings me to that world. The long high notes in the vocals give me total frisson. God that was such a good game.

**runaway3212** (10): just so insanely pretty

**skargardin** (10): The moment in Hollow Knight when you arrive to the City of Tears and the world just completely opens up in all kinds of directions was so exciting for me

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): a game I could never get into but this track is beautiful

**apatel27** (9.5): This build 👌

**1998tweety** (9): shes rich and decadent

**nt96** (9): rain intensifies

**qazz23** (9): peaceful and calming, love those strings

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Castlevania II “Bloody Tears” outsold

**welcome2thejam** (9): That was gorgeous

**Zypker125** (9): Fantastic sense of ambiance and nostalgia

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): Loses the ethereal vibe a bit as it goes on, but definitely caught my attention

**2RINITY** (8): There's a nice build here, I wish I'd played Hollow Knight so I had a better grasp of which part this was supposed to remind me of

**BebeLuigi** (8): It is far from being one of my favourite ost from the game but Hollow Knight has an immaculate ost anyway

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this is soooo pretty!

**Exaltatus** (8): Very pretty, love the harp.

**fortyfive33** (8): damn I should really get around to this game

**shipperondeck** (8): my mom walked in and called this beautiful and asked me to make a playlist of relaxing video game songs for her classroom now. thanks

**throwaway-7650** (8): her vocals are giving into the unknown aurora

**vayyiqra** (8): It does the ~~ethereal thing so I have to like it

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Is this what plays in heaven?

**notdallin** (7.5): are those vocals in MY instrumental rate?! for shame!

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7): It's pretty. I like it. Maybe a touch too busy for the vibe I imagine it's going for though.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): pleasantly surprised

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i think the choir vocals are adding a lot to this one and it would have a much lower score without them

#No Tears Left To Cry

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (6.9): halo lite. i read the jason schreier book that cover the SHOVEL knight game development. good book in all honesty. arguably I think jason schreier's writing with Blood, Sweat, & Pixels + Press Reset are some of the most noteworthy, considerate, and IMPORTANT 2010s non fiction writing. like legit should be taught in college bc he's bluntly telling you how fucking awful the game industry is. anyways as I was saying earlier, this is fine but team...what's here that marty o donnell didn't do like a decade earlier for Bungie?

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.3): pretty but a lil boring

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): this character design is so freaking cute, just wish this song was a little more memorable to me

**frogaranaman** (6): plus points for a good game but genuinely surprised this song of all them made it in

**impla77** (5.6): atmospheric but not much else

**Slaycoco** (5): Pretty but forgettable.

**Hulnia** (3): bored me to tears so true

The second of Yoko Shimomura's tracks to go out, and one that's just as (if not more) iconic than Dearly Beloved. This was one of the few tracks in the rate that held first at one point (though it was a very brief moment) and for a while it looked like a lock for the top 10. However, with a 0 it couldn't keep up with the rest of the top tracks and fell just barely short at the end. Though it's a very enjoyable track, I can't bring myself to love it the same way as some of the others left. Maybe it's due to my utter trash ability at traditional fighting games, but it's stuck in 'good' for me while there are so many left in 'great'.

#Flash Kick

**apatel27** (11): Name any other song in this rate that goes with everything

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): Truly can't get more 80s than this

**shipperondeck** (11): i mean this from the bottom of my heart, FUCK you all for not getting any other fighting game themes in this rate. at least listen to jazzy nyc 99 so you can think about what you've done.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I should stop just having my comments be ‘iconic’ and talk more about the music but like idk we made so many good choices

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): city pop cleared here

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (10): This song makes me feel like an 80s action hero and I love it.

**nt96** (10): this song just exerts perseverance, it fixed my car, it paid my student loans, it body slammed my boss and quit my job and kicked started my dream career.

**stupidslappa** (10): Super iconic intro whenever referencing street fighter or any instance of introducing a competitive setting.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is the definition of “this goes hard”

**throwaway-7650** (10): going to pretend this is ORAS - battle! wally

**vayyiqra** (10): It isn't my favourite theme in Street Fighter II (classic game, I grew up playing it a lot with my brothers) but it really does go with everything.

**welcome2thejam** (10): I recline back into a kneeling position and wait for you to approach wyd

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): an all time smasha. i used to go to an orthodontist that had the arcade cabinet that you could play for free. i didnt--preferred to play Rally Sports Challenge! learned the cut from watching kinggothalion beat box while playing borderlands and destiny. I hope he's doing okay.

**BasedButta** (9.5): Bass goes WILD here i love it

**PhloxInvar** (9.5): Oh, I've heard of this. Now I'm just realizing where it came from.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): undeniably the most iconic fighting game song of all time, unless you count the theme from the mortal kombat movie (which is an 11). ahh the nostalgia of watching “guile’s theme goes with everything” videos as a kid

**Zypker125** (9.5): Ahh, so THAT’S what this song is called!

**1998tweety** (9): hes fine if we ignore the hair

**bigbigbee** (8.5): [fighting game people, especially queer people who are into them, are usually really cool people but]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Grq8Rm4K-8)

**notdallin** (8.5): how does this sound so familiar and classic, I’ve never played this game

**DaHumanTorch** (8.3): i thought it was goose not guile

**anothertown** (8): hellll yes

**BebeLuigi** (8): The only times in my life I feel straight is when I listen to this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Men what is stopping you from having this exact haircut besides gravity and shame?

**Rigumaro** (8): Incredibly iconic, for sure.

**runaway3212** (8): omfggg the muscular man slay

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Where else but in old video games can you find a song that’s both incredibly manly and also very pretty and sparkly?

**impla77** (7.8): gets you pumped up

**flibbityflob** (7.4): It’s good, but compared to a lot of the other soundtracks on here, it’s like…I think it’s technically superior to everything I’ve ranked below it, but there’s a lot of other ones I’d much rather listen to.

**frogaranaman** (7): makes me wanna fight some mfs in front of a jet plane

**rslashpoopheads** (7): HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN! HADOUKEN!

#Button Mashing

**Exaltatus** (6): It's fine I guess. I feel like the whole "Guile's theme goes with everything" is more of an indictment on it than anything else. Doesn't really have a strong identity in my mind. So it fits with whatever.

**pig-serpent** (6): I don't think I've ever played this game and yet this song is burnt into my mind.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): “I finally passed math after failing my tests and dealing with a terrible teacher, so I just felt such a wave of relief. This is the song that popped into my head when I heard I passed” - YouTube user spindletea, 1 year ago

**Slaycoco** (6): Nothing special.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): this sounds like bland motivational hero music you'd hear in a ripoff of rocky

TiltControls: #[BONUS #3: 2D vs 3D Platformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3SvsQP2Hs)

#**Controversy: 5.433**

Probably one of the hardest to choose. While I love 3D platformers too, 2D ones feel so much more fluid and faster without having the worry about the 3rd dimension. Plus it's much easier to mess up 3D movement (cough Sonic)

**1998tweety** (11): it was close but i think she wins out by a little bit

**anothertown** (11): nothing's topping Mary-Kate & Ashley: Get A Clue for Game Boy Color

**apatel27** (11): There's a reason metroidvanias became their own special genre.

**Exaltatus** (11): Has always been better, and I expect it to be always.

**flibbityflob** (11): not having to worry about 3d graphics and thus the effects of physics in three dimensions makes for a better platforming experience

**frogaranaman** (11): FEZ supremacy

**Hulnia** (11): nsmb 2 > 3d land no it’s true

**qazz23** (11): jumping is EZ

**RandomHypnotica** (11): yes there’s more of them then there are people on earth, but idc it never gets stale

**rona NG+** (11): they always have the best art styles and fun mechanics

**shhhneak** (11): Super Mario World and DKC2 fall under this category and that’s automatically a W…

**shipperondeck** (11): for mega man 11 and all the other mega man games (and mmx games) i love them

**thedoctordances1940** (11): it's just a genre that's suited to 2D, like it's not just nostalgia that results in people still making new 2D games to this day

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): better

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (11): classics and underrated hidden gems only

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (11): seems like a better realm tbh. Safer and smarter.

**AzettImpa** (0): it’s just not gonna get better than DKCTF and Celeste. And I don’t love those either, too stressful

**BasedButta** (0): i'm assuming metroidvanias don't count

**Blazingscourge** (0): They’ve been blending together for me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): What kind of platformer is Battle for Bikini Bottom? That answers the question.

**nt96** (0): tough to give this a 0 because it's a VERY slim competition

**runaway3212** (0): yeah celeste is great but it could never be mario galaxy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): not necessarily bad, but i feel like a lot of 2d platformers just arent as fun to play as their 3d counterparts

**AzettImpa** (11): MUCH bigger sense of adventure, a lively world, NPCs and so on. Super Mario Odyssey hello?? Easy choice

**Blazingscourge** (11): More variety but we all just want Mario at the end.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): What kind of platformer is Battle for Bikini Bottom? That answers the question.

**MrMushrooms** (11): My reflexes are too bad for 2D platformers, give me a comfy exploration-based 3D game instead :)

**nt96** (11): Metroid Prime, one of my all time favorite games was a 3D Platformer (albeit in 1st person). Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask while they were more adventure oriented, had strong ties to 3D platforming And because Samus and Link are my ride or die bitches, this gets my 11.

**runaway3212** (11): mario galaxy best game ever!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): again, super mario galaxy is my favorite game of all time, i have a bias going into this

**vayyiqra** (11): You can't, unless you were alive at the time, quite get how much of a thrill it was to go from 2D platformers to being able to jump, flip and spin in any direction in a video game.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): My favorite Mario games are the 3D ones

**Zypker125** (11): You just can't beat the legend of Mario 64, Mario Galaxy, Mario Odyssey, etc.. Literally impossible

**1998tweety** (0): paper mario is the hannah montana of platformers

**anothertown** (0): just nasty and bad

**apatel27** (0): Nothing against these but a lot more misses.

**flibbityflob** (0): so they're finally here performing for you if you know the words you can join in too put your hands together if you want to clap as we take you through this monkey rap

**frogaranaman** (0): I also like these but not as much as 2D

**qazz23** (0): hard 2 judge distance can get dizzzy

**RandomHypnotica** (0): a *great* 3D platformer is superior, however i find that a lot of them fall short and feel “off”, it’s a lot harder to get right (see: Sonic)

**rona NG+** (0): I’m bad at depth perception

**shhhneak** (0): Shoutout to my genetic lack of depth perception!

Narrowing down to a single Zelda track was always going to be hard, but I think this one is unique enough throughout the franchise that it stands out in many players' brains. It's also one of the first islands in the game, so even players that didn't get very far may still have it stuck in their minds.

---

#Sails the High Seas

**2specific4google** (10): - Comparatively simple, but effective. The organic instrumentation is fantastic, it feels traditional and celebratory, like a peek into Rito folk-culture. The pan flute melody is one of my favorites of all time, and when the bass comes in, something awakens within me.

**akanewasright** (10): Wish we got more Zelda rep, but I do dearly love this song

**flibbityflob** (10): look I’ve talked a lot of shit about Koji Kondo but uhhhhhhhhhh I take it all back sometimes music can make you cry!! This was reorchestrated and reworked to fit the soundtrack for the Rito Village

**Rigumaro** (10): Super iconic. There's not a lot of videogame music in this style, so it really stands out too. I love its uniqueness. And the instruments they used.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Most Zelda music is good but Gerudo and Rito music always slap extra hard

**Slaycoco** (10): One of the ultimate Zelda tracks, maybe the absolute best. When I think of Zelda music, this is what first comes to mind.

**throwaway-7650** (10): my fav twink

**welcome2thejam** (10): A solid answer to the "if you crashed on a desert island" question

**shipperondeck** (9.8): i have good memories of this song. i dont have patience for most first player games so i would watch my little sis play ww

**bigbigbee** (9.5): one of the best songs from my single favorite Zelda soundtrack

**notdallin** (9.5): comfy yet invigorating, home bound yet foreign, tribal yet seaworthy, firey yet you can feel the splash of the waves

**CrimsonROSET** (9): THE FLUTE????

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): they didn’t have to go this hard!!!

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (9): This song just begs to have celebratory folk hero stories told to it. While I prefer the chiller rendition in BOTW, this version is still a banger.

**runaway3212** (9): I love the vibes of this

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): sea shanty-core

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): this feels weird as being the only zelda rep in the rate but its still a great song so im not gonna complain about it

**impla77** (8.2): nice and snappy

**Zypker125** (8.2): I like the chill flute instrumental, but the frantic instrumental layer isn’t for me.

**2RINITY** (8): Man, this rate has a lot of acoustic guitar jams that go well with exploring a vivid, well-designed world

**apatel27** (8): It's a good track but doesn't feel like it hits it's full potential

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): i like it but i'm not really sure why out of all Zelda themes this was the one that got the most votes

**qazz23** (8): that bass drop

**RandomHypnotica** (8): of all the zelda songs, this is definitely one of them

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): This percussion and guitar brings to mine the Gerudo Valley theme from Ocarina of Time which is quite a ditty! As well I have a weird love of pan flute so yeah this is pretty good even if it's not the Zelda theme I'd pick by any means.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Never played this one but yas

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.3): fun

**Exaltatus** (7): It's a bop.

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): am I losing my mind or is this like almost the same melody as the last of us what is happening

**StroHersh** (7): - i like the botw version more

#Too much water

**shhhneak** (6.5): It’s fun but like, I’m turning this song slider all the way to zero on all the Zelda stages in Smash Bros.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The real wind maker is the one playing all these Nintendo flutes.

**frogaranaman** (6): THEY'RE ROASTING DRAGONS????

**BebeLuigi** (5): Very far from one of my favourite from Zelda sadly

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (5): hint of hint of steely dan.

Though it may be repetitive and one of the shortest tracks of the rate, you really have to appreciate just how memorable it is. It gets your blood pumping and ready to perform whatever duties laywers do. I assume just shout at each other and solve crimes.

---

#Take That

**CrimsonROSET** (11): no song has brought me more joy in this rate, this was pushing me forward when i thought i was just throwing shit at a wall, watching them all break down as their arguments fell apart was always the best part

**plastichaxan** (11): I wasn’t expecting this to go so hard isn’t the game about lawyers talking or something

**steelstepladder** (11): hope my gay little lawyers win this gay little rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): This game’s music is so insanely good, not only standalone, but also with the way it fits the game’s dynamics and turns everything up to 11. It also turned its score into an 11

**anothertown** (10): gay person's theme

**RandomHypnotica** (10): never before has a song so perfectly captured the "gotcha" feeling

**rslashpoopheads** (10): holy shit this makes me want to scream at random people in public

**shipperondeck** (10): Y'all, please play ultimate marvel vs. capcom 3. Phoenix wright is a playable character and he can go into Turnabout mode and THIS SONG PLAYS as he wrecks shit and makes crazy comebacks like this https://youtu.be/I2dmVRUfH6w?t=40 . yes that last super is him prosecuting the opponent.

**skargardin** (10): You just know that shit is about to go DOWN in the court room when this starts playing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): yeah this song may only have 40 seconds of content but consider this: its the best 40 seconds of music ever put in a video game

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm ace attorney bot fan

**welcome2thejam** (10): This is what plays whenever old friends & family ask me what I've been up to

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR4Pd3QbVFA one of the most important, undershared videos i have ever seen using this music; shout out to the ace attorney bot. incredible invention

**Zypker125** (10): Play this song on loop while simultaneously watching the Amber Heard case and eating popcorn

**2RINITY** (9): I'm pretty sure this song has convinced millions of unfortunate souls to consider law school. It's me, I'm millions of unfortunate souls

**akanewasright** (9): god… I feel like this probably doesn’t land as well if you haven’t played the game, but in context this song is EVERYTHING

**apatel27** (9): Go get his ass

**runaway3212** (9): I know literally one phoenix wright reference but the UPDATED AUTONOMY REPORT is so fucking funny to me

**seanderlust** (8.5): maybe if court were actually like this there wouldn't be so many people trying desperately to get out of jury duty

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): if only that ace attorney bot could work on rate comments

**2l82bstr8** (8): amazing how anxiety-inducing Ace Attorney's OST is. perfectly compliments the game

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): me winning imaginary arguments i create in my head

**BebeLuigi** (8): It's hard to note cuz that theme is obviously so iconic and good but the one from the first game is one of my least favourite version of it.. Stream the one from Apollo Justice imo

**bigbigbee** (8): there is nothing more satisfying that seeing the witness transition from their normal sprite art to their “breakdown” sprite art, with this in the background

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): So immersive I really feel like my own ass has been got.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): the urge to become a lawyer just to play this while i enter the courtroom in my cuntiest trial outfit

**Exaltatus** (8): I'm a sucker for those old tunes.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): I haven't played these games but this feels like classic video game boss music to me.

**nt96** (8): listening to this while commentators are debating on whether soup is a food or drink is truly magical

**qazz23** (8): sounds like a racing theme

**Rigumaro** (8): Don't have much to say about this song, but it's good.

**Roxieloxie** (8): that bot that turns twitter fights into scenes from this game is legendary

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Guy who has only played Pokémon, playing his second video game: Getting a lot of ‘Pokémon battle music’ vibes from this…

**vayyiqra** (8): Good ditty! Very hi-NRG.

**2specific4google** (7.7): - A classic, but Apollo's Pursuit theme is superior.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**BasedButta** (7.5): songs that make you meltdown

**PhloxInvar** (7.5): The big problem with the Ace Attorney series is that the games have had like 9 different versions of certain songs, not to mention a shit ton of songs from all the games. Still, Cornered is arguably the most iconic and certainly well remembered by anyone's who plays AA. Still, I kind of prefer the orchestral sound of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles more, but this is still very much a great song. There are other songs in the franchise I adore more of though.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.3): energetic and pretty fun

#Objection!

**flibbityflob** (7): Look, I love Ace Attorney, I have a LOT of opinions about the score, but my biggest hot take is I think Pursuit Cornered is outshone by AA3, AA4, and both DGS games in terms of how cool they sound. Not even considering how fucking good the soundtrack to Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright is, especially that pursuit theme. Iconic for a reason, but I don’t…know.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Never played Ace Attorney so I feel like I’m missing something

**notdallin** (6.6): Objection! The song is just fine!

**Slaycoco** (6): Intense

**frogaranaman** (5): this gay ass courtroom

**impla77** (4.5): another event track that doesn’t do much for me

**JayElecHanukkah** (4): this is for a game about court proceedings? Really? Not like, fighting a dragon? Okay

**StroHersh** (3): - great in context but would you actually listen for fun

Though I'm familiar with the influence and acclaim of the game's story, I never really looked too deeply into the music of the Silent Hill franchise. After hearing this track though, maybe that's something to be changed soon. This is a bit rockier than I thought Popheads might like, but I'm glad it managed to squeeze its way so high up! The part when the strings kick in is really just immaculate. Sure Silent Hill might be a horrific place to find yourself, but with tracks like this there's a small solace to it.

---

#Indieheads

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): this is one powerful piece of music

**BasedButta** (11): why does depressed girl from scary game has such a good rocking out song

**JayElecHanukkah** (11): in my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised me you'd take me there again someday. But you never did. Well, I'm alone there now... In our 'special place'... Waiting for you....

**2l82bstr8** (10): about five songs ago this rock party started following me on instagram. I scoffed my nose at it. "I'm never going to a rock party!", I thought. well...

**2specific4google** (10): - I forgot that Laura isn't Maria, the clone of your dead wife who negs you, she's the little girl who's even meaner. The song makes being ruthlessly bullied by a nine-year-old in your personal hell born from guilt worth it.

**apatel27** (10): The way this song conveys emotion is actually insane. From the melancholic start to the slow building of hope and triumph only to take it all away at the end with the last 30 seconds

**BebeLuigi** (10): Absolutely amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (10): apparently this song took a week to compose? it fucking paid off holy shit the build

**nt96** (10): a win for the mandolins

**qazz23** (10): the guitar melodies and violin really make this (11 candidate)

**Slaycoco** (10): Mega sodding BOP. I never even played a silent hill game but I listen to this track often.

**Stryxen** (10): iconic Smash hit I haven't even played this but it's an amazing ost

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song conveys an emotion that doesn’t exist

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): RYM nerds didn’t miss with this one. won me over in one listen, I was in love at the second. this goes hard

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Omg banger spotted

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): i need to find my wife laura and no this is not a metaphor for depression, guilt, or desire, she is real i love my wife. i made this rock ditty for her, see?

**PhloxInvar** (9.5): I think this is a sick theme, I don't have any context for it but it just speaks to me.

**shipperondeck** (9.4): this is the little girl's theme? why did she outsell? (good for her of course)

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): Rock n roll

**1998tweety** (9): rock serve

**runaway3212** (9): an unexpected slay

**shhhneak** (9): I have a love/hate relationship with Silent Hill (mostly hate) and Silent Hill 2 is SO angsty but this is still a serve to this day.

**stupidslappa** (9): Very 2k nostalgia. Haven’t played Silent Hill for so long.

**welcome2thejam** (9): This rocks and still has a "who knows what lurks around the bend" quality to it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Reminds me of the Buffy theme but less frantic

**notdallin** (8.4): if we can’t get Amy Lee or Avril Lavigne or Soccer Mommy to sing on top of this we have accomplished nothing

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): i kinda love how you would never expect a song like this to be a theme in a game as fucked up as this

**bigbigbee** (8): I like how grimy and industrial this sounds. Not only is it pleasantly unique in this rate playlist, but it’s beautifully on-theme for the game. Even in the “non-haunted” version of the Silent Hill town, there’s a beautiful, dark, run-down-ness / abandoned-ness / grittiness to the environments that this song evokes really well.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Claims to be silent, has music anyway.

**skargardin** (8): ooh this is lovely

**2RINITY** (7.8): What a nice late-90's/early-2000's adult alternative song, I'm sure nothing devastating happens to the character it's for

**impla77** (7.2): this song is peak 2000s instrumental

**akanewasright** (7): not my usual thing, but very good song

**Exaltatus** (7): Feels so of the time. Didn't think there would be any songs in a game like Silent Hill

**ricki** (7): evanescense song

**Rigumaro** (7): I can see (well, hear) its value, but it's not really my thing.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7): kinda giving early 2000s teen drama movie but not in a bad way

#Pyramidheads

**Zypker125** (6.3): Sounds kinda generic? Like this is what I’d expect a 90s cowboy action show to sound like, not a horror game. Still kinda nice though

**pig-serpent** (6): I wasn't expecting the dream pop. It's not entirely my thing but I can see myself getting attached to it in game.

**slimboyfriend** (6): This song could benefit from some lyrics

**vayyiqra** (6): This series creeps me out so I've never played it only read about it in gaming magazines in the 2000s. This is not very creepy! Interesting!

**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like a song my Deadhead uncle would tell me was game changing for the 70s

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

Even though this series is a veteran in rates at this point, I am a little surprised to see that it managed to make top 10 with not only a long song, but only that really requires the context of the game to understand. I can't complain however! This is probably one of my most played tracks of 2015 and I'm so glad to see it up here. This is another track that's probably best to go in blind on (and completely ignore the fanbase til you're done and past it), but it's 100% worth the journey. Say what you want about Toby Fox's influence on the internet kids of the 2010s, but he is a masterclass musician. 

(If you plan on playing the game at some point I'd avoid the comments on these for spoilers) Everyone probably knows [Megalovania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5daGZ96QGU) and some raters might remember [Death By Glamor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TgO-tN5wAM) (if you don't they're both incredibly fun and catchy tracks!) For other battle themes I'd like to shoutout [Hopes and Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz82xbLvK_k) which falls into the Rainbow Road category of 'why does this sound joyous and intimidating at the same time'. [Spider Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ3XjVVNagU) is another incredibly fun battle theme from the game. [Reunited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgRfPc1lfJk) is similar to Undertale in the 'this hits 100x more once you finish the game'. And something about [Snowdin Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6LmMCuGjfA) feels like coming into a warm house after a cold winter's day outside. And [Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_E_y1AWAfc) manages to bring the cozyness to 100. However all of these pale in comparison to the true [best Undertale track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlyF43Te6U)

#The comments that might show up if you scored it highly

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): The way Toby Fox dropped this game and changed the lives of sensitive nerds all across the globe for years to come. The way this song made a logically inexplicable exposition dump seem natural and we cried. The way this soundtrack repeats like five melodies 20 times and we don’t care because it slays every time.

**celladonn** (11): undertale soundtrack just hits different

**Rigumaro** (11): This theme is so full of emotion. I have a hard time putting into words what I feel, but it's SO powerful. The leitmotiv that's used throughout the entire soundtrack literally touches my heart everytime I hear it.

**StroHersh** (11): - slaps

**1998tweety** (10): yet again...i am ascending

**2l82bstr8** (10): it was almost my 11 honestly I really need to finish playing this game

**akanewasright** (10): god… I really need to replay this game

**apatel27** (10): Reminds me of Speed of Youth from A Silent Voice

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): i always preferred the boss themes to this, but this is still amazing

**bigbigbee** (10): everything I said about Aerith’s theme, except I’ve actually played this game and so it DOES hit exactly in the right spot for me

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wooooah story of undertale

**diamondsandglass** (10): everything Toby Fox touches turns to gold

**notdallin** (10): not my favorite song from the game (that honor would go to the sleepy and icy “shop” theme) but doggonit if it doesn’t fill me with determination!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): good god, when this first played... the overwhelming rush of emotion i got... absolutely jaw-droppingly stunning and beautiful, and i love how it contrasts the rest of the soundtrack, wish i had 2 11's so i could give it to this as well

**runaway3212** (10): yeah I wanted literally any undertale song but also it's incredible

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I still don’t know what this fckning game LOOKS like (do not tell me)

**skargardin** (10): this is sooo soothing, also at this point someone please force me to play Undertale

**stupidslappa** (10): Never played Undertale but that bgm sounds too good. That key change tho

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): this one almost got my eleven based on how much I love the game also I love how beautifully the song builds but musically I like GGG a lil more

**welcome2thejam** (10): Haven't played a second of Undertale but tempted to put on the soundtrack one day regardless, every song I've heard from it is ace

**PhloxInvar** (9.7): The title track of the beloved Undertale. It's super well-made and the heart of the entire game. While arguable not the most iconic of the franchise (Megalovania) and not the best of the soundtrack (Death by Glamour) it certainly is its most emotional. There's emotion baked into all these instruments for sure. I think it peaks at the flute section though, but the entire song is monumental in what it accomplished. I do like songs like Finale, Hopes and Dreams/SAVE THE WORLD, Bergentruckung or Battle Against a True Hero much more than Undertale, and even Deltarune has its amazing tracks like Attack of the Killer Queen, Chaos King, The Legend and My Castle Town that I prefer more... but Undertale is certainly an amazing track regardless.

**shhhneak** (9.7): The urge to sabotage this because of Toby Fox stans.

**flibbityflob** (9.6): Despite everything, it’s still you. (but this isn’t toby fox’s best score work, please for the love of god google “theme of apple girlington” or play that song after this in the rate reveal it’s pure distilled toby fox insanity)

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): this is just lifelike but if it was long as wind tempos

**2RINITY** (9): It's not the funny dudu-DUT-dut song, but it's still an incredible piece of music

**cremeebrulee** (9): wait i’m not supposed to be listening to this i haven’t finished the game yet

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (9): I feel like this could be improved if the bass were 4-bit triangle but that's a subjective nitpick. This piece is great.

**pig-serpent** (9): I love this song but the mashup of the piano version of it with Rihanna's Umbrella is the true 10 here.

**qazz23** (9): heartwarming and beautiful, love the buildup

**seanderlust** (8.5): the way toby fox lives in the ""music composers that slap"" part of my brain right next to like...a.g. cook

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): We're gonna look back and realize that Undetale (and Homestuck, etc) was a top 10 most important online cultural thing of the 2010s. not sure what it signifies or outlines as a symptom of what video games/online communities/video game soundtracks mean bc I rlly only VAGUELY interacted with it from the angle of being a steven universe fan. good song!

**Exaltatus** (8): Feels very nostaglic, but I'm not sure what for. I should probably play Undertale some time, just couldn't really get into it.

**hikk** (8): this is what lifelike what sound like if it was as long as wind tempos

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It's cute but that keychange is ehhh

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I don’t know if this song does a great job of capturing the game. It’s a little cliche

**impla77** (7.4): some songs are just made to sound nostalgic

**frogaranaman** (7): this is Homestuck adjacent enough to say we're rating Homestuck

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): this sounds like it was engineered in a lab to make a 13 year old say "wow this is so emotional"

**rslashpoopheads** (7): this would've gotten my 11 if it was Mettaton EX theme

**Slaycoco** (7): Cute but naurt much to say. Feels like it’d be more meaningful if I played the game.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is fine and all but almost any other undertale/deltarune pick would’ve been better

**vayyiqra** (7): I have no clue what this game is about but this is cute

#Carrying too many dogs

**Zypker125** (6.6): Music you play on a train ride

**fortyfive33** (3): vote here is as much about the game as it is the music.

**LesApfels** (3): I guess this might be really emotional if you've played the game

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): is it weird that I don’t really like the bass in this track? The build-up of the song is great, sure, but I don’t want to sit through that irritating bass for 3 minutes. also I know Death by Glamour was not an option but Spider Dance was right there sob. The skip button goes hard

**shipperondeck** (1): i haven't played undertale so this song means nothing to me sorry

I hadn't heard this track before the rate, but it quickly became one of my favourites. Starts off a bit slow, but once the strings kick in it becomes magical. It can feel a little all over the place at times, but it does it in the best way possible. This was holding 3rd for a good portion of the rate so I'm a bit sad to see it miss the top 5, but the tracks above it are just as excellent.

#Give me another puzzle

**PhloxInvar** (11): Holy fuck. WOW. This is gorgeous. The piano, accordion and violin's are JUST INSANE!!! Jesus fucking christ, the arrangement feels so perfect. The melody switching between instruments are just killing me like oh my fucking god.

**apatel27** (10): Classical music is good

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): epic

**celladonn** (10): an unexpected slay

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): wait this RULES

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): I love unwound, LTIY is my favourite album of all time, but all of their albums are worth a listen. Their more aggressive, post-hardcore sound peaked with New Plastic Ideas if you ask me, but I don't think they put out a bad album. Challenge for A Civilized Society isn't really one of their usually cited favourites, but I think it's a little underrated - it really represents a turning point in their sound, with an interesting blend of the more long-form, less immediate indie rock styling they'd switch to fully on Leaves with the more upfront, aggressive post-hardcore of their earlier work. It's a little rough around the edges, there's some growing pains but no one is reading this anyways

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this soundtrack makes me want to move to paris and solve puzzles (i know this game is in london but idc it has french vibes)

**shhhneak** (10): This children’s game makes me want to burlesque dance.

**StroHersh** (10): - i respect anything that got people momologging in the youtube comments

**welcome2thejam** (10): Way too epic for a logic puzzle game, imagine hearing this as you start to read "four farmers and their sheep need to get across this small bridge before lunch"

**shipperondeck** (9.5): i love the artstyle of this game. professor layton looks like a nice friendly man.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): yo wtf

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (9.4): love 90s chicago post-rock released on drag city, thrill jockey, or touch & go's quarterstick record-wait this ins't that!

**2specific4google** (9): - SLOT MACHINE GUN.

**BasedButta** (9): oh shit i feel it unwounding

**CrimsonROSET** (9): layton in general is so underrated!! such a fun game to play with friends and argue logic aboit

**Exaltatus** (9): Why is Luke not in school? Why is he off solving mysteries with some professor?

**hikk** (9): never played layton but wait.... im a little gagged

**Rigumaro** (9): I really like this vibe. I don't have much to say about it though.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.9): bit of a slow burn but I really liked how it got more chaotic towards the end

**1998tweety** (8.5): ate

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): professor layton genuinely some of the best games ever made, i think i prefer just the standard theme but the way it's interwoven into this track is still pretty cool

**flibbityflob** (8.2): It’s Professsor Layton and the Lost Future here and I’m still not over it and how good this soundtrack is and I’m crying just listening to this actually!

**notdallin** (8.2): this probably isn’t what the game is about but this gives me serious underground lively tavern music vibes

**2RINITY** (8): This reminds me, I never played any of the Professor Layton games after the first one even though I know I really should

**BebeLuigi** (8): I'm not the biggest fan of the Layton Franchise but I have to admit the ost is usually really good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Put this PILF in Smash.

**qazz23** (8): great use of piano and 🎻

**rslashpoopheads** (8): the series peaked here

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): this title is so cool actually like irenenotes

**impla77** (7.6): I’m a simp for professor Layton

**akanewasright** (7.5): the pianist and violinist deserve their [redacted bc this series has E rated entries]

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I have a masters degree and I still have never been able to solve a “move only one matchstick…” puzzle without looking up a guide narrated by a 14-year old boy on youtube

**runaway3212** (7.5): a cute bop that reminds me of american's vision of france

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): those violin and piano plays are absolutely going the fuck off

**skargardin** (7): this is nice

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't quite understand what this game is about but support the film score vibes.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Video games have certainly helped me realize the sex appeal of the accordion

#Hint token needed

**pig-serpent** (6.5): There are some cool moments in the song towards the end.

**frogaranaman** (6): classicalheads rate WHEN

**Slaycoco** (6): Cute I guess.

**Zypker125** (5.2): Too many instruments in this one, it’s too overcrowded to the point of sounding unsettling. Nice overall theming though.

This really is more MMORPGs and I guess Overwatch too, but I like seeing happy numbers show up instead of relying on someone else to keep me alive. (Also I'm terrible at leading the charge if we are talking Overwatch)

**1998tweety** (11): the champs are just skinnier

**AzettImpa** (11): obviously

**BasedButta** (11): it's a fetish thing

**Blazingscourge** (11): Love helping people.

**DefaultPophead** (11): I am always the healer.

**nt96** (11): I can't photoshop your life with better decisions but somebody has to save your dumbasses

**qazz23** (11): you are constantly saving lives

**rona NG+** (11): healer main here and it’s always hell but always the most fun also

**runaway3212** (11): healers are so gay coded…

**slimboyfriend** (11): i’m gay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): literally the most important part of any team, the amount of battles ive only barely managed to pass in games all because of healers saving my ass is in the hundreds

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): freelo

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): You're just asking who's a top and who's a bottom

**welcome2thejam** (11): Fuck you, Genji

**whatsalanka** (11): Yukiko Amagi my girl in charge

**Zypker125** (11): Healer requires less work and receives more gratitude

**anothertown** (0): i already made the mage or whomever in my party the healer and that sure as hell isnt me

**apatel27** (0): You will never find a more holier than thou group of people and most of them aren't even good! Congratulations!!! You want a sticker for doing the job you chose? DPS drops? Healer bitches them out. Tank misses a bodyblock? Healer bitches them out. But call out a Healer for messing up rotations? "don't be mean uwu I save your life and you don't care about that" They come on all the forums and talk about how underappreciated they are. How the rest of the squad/team don't understand how integral they are to the game. How they're the nicest, most caring people and get nothing but abuse in return all while being passive aggressive in game chat non-stop. "I wouldn't need to be such an incredible healer if my dps just opened their eyes :)" They create a circlejerk and play the victim so much people from outside the game start believing them allowing them to get away with more toxicity! Now watch me be the only person with this take and everyone else gives them the 11.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): What do I look like, a Nurse Joy??

**flibbityflob** (0): i used to main healers also and then i realised that was profoundly boring and doing damage and taking hits is so much more fun

**frogaranaman** (0): bottom joke here

**indie\_fan\_** (0): Just thinking about fire emblem and healers are useless for the most part as long as ya got enough elixirs in your inventory

**RandomHypnotica** (0): healing is for nerds

**shhhneak** (0): I crave attention and they get disrespected!!

**shipperondeck** (0): i don't play team games but if i did i would never heal anyone

**vayyiqra** (0): I don't get this role, I have never played a game where I was a healer, theoretically it sounds good but I've just never done it.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (0): i use all the medkits on myself in l4d

**anothertown** (11): actually is this about overwatch?

**apatel27** (11): While this role is played by people that mistaken their lack of social skills for stoic-ness, they're mostly chill.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Put the bullets inside me.

**flibbityflob** (11): OUTTA MY WAY GAYBOY!

**frogaranaman** (11): top joke here

**hikk** (11): im a top

**RandomHypnotica** (11): haha d.va go brr

**shipperondeck** (11): i don't like tanking either but i'd rather not be a healer lmao

**thedoctordances1940** (11): this probably isn't talking about DnD, but i'm assuming it is

**vayyiqra** (11): Ironically despite saying above I would rather play offensively, and a tank seems to fit better with defensive play, I've at least played this before. Also I play D.Va who is well, literally a tank character so sure. (But tank-ies- are a 0; do not interact with them online.)

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (11): I WANT to play healer but i'm a massive pushover and always get forced into tank roles

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (11): louis from l4d voice "TAAAANNNNKKKK"

**1998tweety** (0): BOOT

**AzettImpa** (0): ew it just gives very straight energy (sorry D-VA)

**Blazingscourge** (0): I would avoid taking a hit on purpose if possible.

**Exaltatus** (0): Tanks are the jocks of gaming, overrated and unneeded. Yes, I am attracted to them but shut up.

**qazz23** (0): you just stand there and hit stuff

**rona NG+** (0): I get so stressed when I’m playing tank like am I taking enough damage am I taking too much damage is someone else taking damage should I heal

**runaway3212** (0): FREAKYFISHYFISHYIMSOFRAKYFISHYFISHY

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): almost always the worst class in any game that has them

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): boreee

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): No I'm a scaredy cat other people can be tank

**welcome2thejam** (0): My fight-or-flight is tuned 95% towards flight, so this is not for me

**Zypker125** (0): I like to prtend like I'm an altruistic person, but truthfully, I know I'd get my ass kicked if I was a Tank so I'd be a Healer instead

TiltControls: #[BONUS #1: Charizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arj-tjV6aw)

##**Controversy:** 5.494**

Okay Charizard does get a bit too much attention from GameFreak, but it's also a winged, fire-breathing ~~dragon~~ lizard / part-time dragon. What's not to enjoy?

This ended up being the closest split in the rate. Though Charizard is a fan-favourite, it does come at the cost of other Pokemon missing out on the love.

**anothertown** (11): there are some weird looking pokemon dragons that deserve to be on t-shirts

**apatel27** (11): Why did this dumb lizard get preferential treatment for so long.

**AzettImpa** (11): it’s a dragon y’all please calm down …..

**BasedButta** (11): dragons are overused and barely cool

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): A lot of Pokemon hate topics are dumb and tired but they really need to retire this lizard.

**Exaltatus** (11): Pokemon is dumb and I'll go to the grave saying it.

**indie\_fan\_** (11): Just a bit, yeah

**MrMushrooms** (11): POKEMON COMPANY PLEASE STOP

**nt96** (11): There's so much more pokemon like....?

**rona NG+** (11): TWO MEGAS?

**shhhneak** (11): Fuck Charizard and I said that shit!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): VENUSAUR OUTSOLD!!!!

**vayyiqra** (11): Fuck Charizard, being an OP fire-breathing dragon doesn't automatically make you cool or a good player.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Me, a Bulbasaur stan:

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (11): venusaur cleared with ease

**1998tweety** (0): shes perfectly rated imo

**Blazingscourge** (0): Haters be damned!

**Zypker125** (11): He's a flying flaming dragon that can spew fireballs. I will not take any criticism.

**apatel27** (0): When a pokemon becomes the second mascot and is prioritised over the starters and legendaries of the game -X&Y say hello- you don't get to be called overhated.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Nobody cares that you stan Venesaur.

**indie\_fan\_** (0): Yes, one of the most beloved pokemon in the entire franchise is "overhated"

**rona NG+** (0): just say genwunner

**shhhneak** (0): Bulbasaur and Squirtle outeverythinged.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): dont get me wrong, i dont hate charizard by any measure, but if you unironically tell me your favorite pokemon is charizard im gonna give you some raised eyebrows

And we've got our Paradise Killer award for, 'making it much farther than its reputation expected'. And even placing 4th again! I like this track, I know nothing about the game beyond the title and it seems to fit pretty well with the aesthetic vibe its going for. I think if this had a bit more time to grow on me or if I played the game I might've scored it higher, but top 5 is quite the accomplishment regardless!

#Jukebox Hero

**anothertown** (10): this game has about a million songs in it and, insanely, it asks you to pick a few to load into the jukebox every in-game day. no ipod shuffle in cyberpunk world

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh I haven’t even HEARD of this game/series but this is a slay I don’t need any context!

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is the paradise killer of this rate tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when my sleep schedule is fucked

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is better than most 80s synthpop revival music I’ve heard

**LesApfels** (10): Absolutely gorgeous synths. I listened to the full soundtrack because this was so good and it did not dissapoint.

**nt96** (10): just sexy all around

**PhloxInvar** (10): The most popheads track on this rate. Literally.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Holy shit this is a banger

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this game was really boring but the amazing soundtrack kept me going

**rslashpoopheads** (10): discovery of the rate

**shipperondeck** (10): damn now THIS song is worth rating

**steelstepladder** (10): we love a left field pick

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): So happy one of my picks made it! Turns out that over here at popheads we love synthwave. Frankly, I don’t have much to say about the song aside from it’s a cute synthy bop and it goes hard, so I’m just gonna write a recommendation lol. I’d suggest you check the game out if you like cyberpunk or slice-of-life, even if you’re not necessarily into visual novels. The Western tone (though it has its animeisms, it’s a lot more self aware about it), the eccentric characters and the amazing soundtrack make it one of the most accessible entries of the medium imo.

**throwaway-7650** (10): CITY POP !?

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): yeah i like mag bay what about it

**1998tweety** (9.5): serve a bit

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): and this isn't even the best song this game can offer

**skargardin** (9): we love a vaporware-y moment

**Slaycoco** (9): That’s a bop Maury.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): we love city pop

**vayyiqra** (9): this is city pop !! will not be taking questions. Love that cyberpunk 8-bit image too as the thumbnail, that rules.

**2specific4google** (8.8): - Yeah, this shit is hot.

**notdallin** (8.7): I stand with synthwave!

**hikk** (8.5): city pop

**Zypker125** (8.5): Does a pretty solid job at setting a cyberpunk atmosphere.

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): disco!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): I am groovin’, baybeee

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.3): this was fun and jazzy a lil city popish

**apatel27** (8): This is how you do a synth track

**BebeLuigi** (8): I really need to play VA-11 at some points everytime I hear an ost of this game it's great

**qazz23** (8): yay there is 🎷

**Rigumaro** (8): It's good. Was going to give it a 7 initially but after the complete listen it grew up on me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Disco club 80’s synthpop city pop uhh quick what are some other words r/popheads overuses

**welcome2thejam** (8): Stop, you had me at "Cyberpunk Bartender"

**shhhneak** (7.2): Synthwave supremacy!

**2RINITY** (7): Nice for what it is, but putting the word "cyberpunk" in the title of your game makes me want to hear acid synths, and this song fails to hit that bar

**Exaltatus** (7): Very bouncy and fun.

**runaway3212** (7): me joining rate reveals at 1:00 am my time whereas everybody else is partying in the afternoon

#Another drink please

**flibbityflob** (6.7): nobody wants to listen to me give a long rant about the soundfonts of the PC-98, but for a game inspired by those of the PC-98 era, this soundtrack does NOT do enough to emulate the sounds of the music that inspired it. The music itself is like, it’s good! But I think it doesn’t do enough to establish place outside of the generic trappings of the genre; you’re listening to this and there’s nothing to surprise you and I think I expect an indie game that uses such a non-traditional structure should maybe try and surprise its listener.

**impla77** (6.5): another solid vibe

**frogaranaman** (6): boppy but this is so random to be voted in?? LMAO

**BasedButta** (5): gets boring… much like the game

**pig-serpent** (5): This should be so much cooler

Falling just short of the top 3 is the ever-present sounds of Wii Sports starting up. It may not be as flashy as some of the other tracks in this rate, but the results show it still holds a ton of sway in peoples' minds. It does sound a bit like elevator or hold music, but there's a warmth to it as well that brings a smile to my face. And though I love the Wii Sports theme, I do think the [Wii Sports Resort Menu Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEWxzW2wJU) outsold a little.

**impla77** (7.5): ironically and unironically a bop

**Stryxen** (7): it’s fun! maybe i’ve heard it too much because i’ve definitely cooled on it now but it’s good and fun and happiness and joy etc etc

**stupidslappa** (7): If you were to guess by now Wii isn’t my childhood.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): Wii Fit Plaza music is where it's at.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): WOW!

#Bogey

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (6.9): again, the implication that this is a "gamer national anthem" could only be assumed if you ever had friends with nintendo or were gifted this console and the handful of good in-house games nintendo made for it. This song seems aware that it is for a nintendo game on a console that is a lowkey gimmick (not flop, just gimmick). the attachment level is not here to coronate. But the comments on this video are gorgeous, again reflecting that same level of heartfelt energy Wii Shop Channel brings out. This comment in particular tho nails the whole thing: "****The Wii was weak. The Wii was full of shovelware. The Wii often relied on tired gimmicks. Wii Sports is without question the most fun I've ever had with a game, simply because the entire family could play and my 60 year old parents stood a chance.****" rock on sir :,)

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): we'll give her a few points for a lil bit iconic

**pig-serpent** (6): Iconic opening notes, but basically carried by nostolgia.

**vayyiqra** (6): idk okay it's nighttime and I've been up since 7 and haven't moved for three hours from finishing this ballot I give up this is fine

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5): the Wii with its motion controlled stuff was marketed as like a way to keep your kids active and my mom explicitly bought it for me for that reason so this song brings mixed emotions lmao so imma just keep this rating neutral

**apatel27** (2): Peak nostalgia overriding ears moment. Like the game was incredible both gameplay and innovation wise, but the music is not special in the slightest

For a portion of the early month this song had the lead. However, it picked up a few lower scores and dropped down then back up to a very solid top 3 finish! Many people list this piece as one of the most iconic tracks in all of gaming, and it's easy to see why. When you first enter the world you get this serene aquatic track to guide you, and then it picks up - but doesn't get bogged down. Koji Kondo is a master composer, and this will always be one of his standouts to me.

#Backwards Longjump to Victory

**Slaycoco** (11): Maybe the pinnacle of VGM for me? If not, it’s close. The memories I have of this song will be carried with me for the rest of my life! A true masterpiece.

**stupidslappa** (11): Hate this level in the game but I absolutely love the theme. Played the 30 min version on YT during my college exams LOL

**2l82bstr8** (10): nothing dire or dock about this one it's just pure floating on clouds

**akanewasright** (10): oh look the soundtrack to dozens of my deaths by drowning

**anothertown** (10): an A press is an A press, you can't say it's only a half

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): second best video game water theme behind aquatic ambiance

**BebeLuigi** (10): It's just so good, like the whole thing is so immaculate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Beautiful beautiful song. Stupid stupid level. It’s just a boat inside one room. You can’t even go inside the boat!

**frogaranaman** (10): me speedrunning thru this rate like: YAHOO! YAHOO! YAH-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H- (instantly noclips to submitting in Tilt's dms)

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): wow this is incredible. Ever since playing this for the first time, it's what I think about whenever encountering a water level. Riding that swordfish? Doing other things as a big ol gorilla? Great stuff

**nt96** (10): if childlike wonder was a song

**pig-serpent** (10): That N64 midi is used expertly for this song, creating a wholely unique soundfont that is absolutely beautiful. I wish more songs sound like this one does. The song becomes even more magical once the drums kick in.

**qazz23** (10): strangely relaxing, i've always like the mario water themes (11 candidate)

**Roxieloxie** (10): a game i unfortunately now associate with bjorks debut album because the last time i played it i listened to that

**runaway3212** (10): this is literally such a fucking huge slay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is kinda just the best ambient music to ever been created

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is so calming

**vayyiqra** (10): "Dire" is the word indeed because this is boring and there are way better themes from this game! Where Bowser fight stage theme? No jk I like this theme a lot, a nice peaceful New Age kind of track. Also I think of this every time I listen to this one Faye Wong song on her album Fable which rules.

**whatsalanka** (10): It's a masterpiece

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): windows 95 boots up and in an ***owen wilson voice*** you go wow.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (9.9): The second best water level music of all time.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): lucid dreaming core

**2RINITY** (9): It'd be the greatest water level theme of all time if Aquatic Ambience didn't exist

**apatel27** (9): That drumbeat towards the end really pulls the song together

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the only water sign I always associate with peace like it’s a sundown at the beach not ‘you’re running out of breath grab a bubble’

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): do the secret ambient rate https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/wvts1c/comment/ilhrhho/

**PhloxInvar** (9): It probably does underwater the best out of the underwater-esque tracks in the rate. Just so water-y and vibey.

**Rigumaro** (9): I love this melody, and the vibe it creates. Took one point off because I'm kinda tired of hearing it on gaming youtubers' videos. Very overused. I don't blame them though, it's good.

**throwaway-7650** (9): I love shoegaze

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ahh what a classic

**flibbityflob** (8.9): Koji Kondo is one of the best composers of all time, but it’s also important to remember that the Super Mario 64 soundtrack is the music for one of the greatest Youtube videos of all time, SM64 - Watch for Rolling Rocks - 0.5x A Presses (Commentated).

**notdallin** (8.6): I’m now picturing Mario as an N64 polygonal Zora and it’s not pretty. Help

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute but she doesn't sound dire enough

**seanderlust** (8.5): this actually does make me want to go swimming so...well played, music composers

**Zypker125** (8.3): This rating is solely supported by nostalgia points.

**Exaltatus** (8): Music to take hallucinogens to.

**shhhneak** (8): Just using this space to share my truth and say Super Mario Sunshine is the best 3D Mario.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): it's just very nice and that's pretty cool

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.7): a chill classic

**hikk** (7): pretty but overrated there are better songs from this game !!!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (7): “Super Mario 64 was always a very lonely game for me. Walking around the worlds made me feel so... isolated, at a melancholic peace, in serenity. But I think that was the intended beauty of the game, right? Mario, on his quest alone, fighting through solitude, to someday be reunited with the woman that fills his gap of isolation. To me, I can relate to that feeling of loneliness, I think we all can, from one point in our lives or another. Through the venture of life, we feel often feel alone, tackling those obstacles by ourselves as time moves on. Super Mario 64's narrative captures that venture, and in a sense this crazy world we play in seems more real to us than we could have imagined. Personally, I think this theme epitomises that feeling of loneliness, and adventuring through life alone, and rather perfectly at that.”- YouTube user Wackaz (Arthur), 1 year ago

**skargardin** (7): cute

#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yw5jkAHgME

**rslashpoopheads** (6): to this day I still have not been able to unpack why such a calm track is called dire dire docks

**welcome2thejam** (6): False advertising, I wanted something dire and instead I got the theme they play during dolphin shows at the zoo

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I think I’ve made reference to “mario water level synths” in at least three rates prior to this, and every single time, I am referencing the way that this song sounds

**impla77** (5): feel like I may have heard this before, then again it sounds like much of this list

**shipperondeck** (5): a level theme

Though it had a strong run, it was never really able to get into that first place spot. And while it would've made a fun surprise winner, I'm happy with the current results as well! Even though I never really played Ducktales, the music is something I've been well aware of. Originally from the SNES back in 1989, the game was remastered with all new graphics and soundtrack for a more recent generation. While the original [Moon Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF32DRg9opA) is a banger in its own right, I think I prefer the cleanness of the new one over it. Both versions are full of life and energy, not exactly something you think of when it comes to the moon but if it meant this joyous track was created it's hard to complain too much.

---

#Over the Moon

**nt96** (11): a video game track so iconic, it not only made its way back bigger and badder than ever, it even made its way into the show!

**qazz23** (11): love how epic sounding this is, both versions are good

**welcome2thejam** (11): Kubrick should've waited the few extra years so this could soundtrack the moon landing

**2specific4google** (10): - A great melody will take you a long way. The original was already wonderful, this arrangement pushes it to perfection (replacing some of the NES beeps makes it a little less harsh on my sensitive ears too)

**apatel27** (10): You know a theme is good when they use it as the emotional crux of the TV show

**bigbigbee** (10): So is this game actually good, like Goof Troop (supposedly a really good Zelda game wearing a Goofy and Max costume), or did they write this absolute banger for a NORMAL quality Disney game (a.k.a. Shitty, Cheap, and Not Fun) goths dancing under a bridge.gif

**CrimsonROSET** (10): OH ITS THIS SONG

**Exaltatus** (10): Never played the game, but it doesn't matter. Certified classic.

**hikk** (10): the original is the more iconic one, but honestly they did such a fantastic job with this remastered version too. keeping the 8 bit excellence but adding additional parts to add to the drama, it just gives! let's hope there's not crusty ppl tanking this for not being the og cuz this slays so much too

**PhloxInvar** (10): Climb aboard, get ready to explore there's so much to find! Just lovely honestly. Feels so adventurous but most of all, triumphant. I feel like I can take on anything with this song behind me.

**Rigumaro** (10): It's one of my favorite ever videogame songs. The melody is just so strong and it "tickles" my brain in the best way.

**Roxieloxie** (10): my only exposure to ducktales was the 2017 reboot (which was tbh really good) and knowing that people really love this theme and for good reason its really nice

**rslashpoopheads** (10): no this absolutely has no right to slap this hard it doesn't it just doesn't

**runaway3212** (10): me on the moon with my little knapsack without any oxygen: "where is scrooge mcduck???"

**Slaycoco** (10): Absolutely iconic.

**slimboyfriend** (10): A classic; you can play it at birthdays, weddings, funerals, etc

**steelstepladder** (10): wild how the greatest composition ever made ended up in a ducktales game but I’m not complaining

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i’ll always have more nostalgia for the original but it sounds just as fantastic in the remake

**throwaway-7650** (10): this sounds like it could be in ORAS

**Zypker125** (10): Another song I’m hearing for the first time that’s getting an insta 10. Cinematic as fuck and very adventurous/high-energy.

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): now that was a classique

**shipperondeck** (9.7): when i first found this song in middle school i thought ducktales was a fanmade idea and someone made the song for fun to go with it

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): why did a kinda generic game have such an amazing and iconic soundtrack

**1998tweety** (9.5): this BOPS (it also gives off some Sonic Colours vibes, which reminds me Planet Wisp was ROBBED)

**seanderlust** (9.5): scrooge mcduck yelling voice HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, OBAMA??? I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU FREAKIN IDIOT!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this honestly goes crazy

**pig-serpent** (9): The new instrumentation opens the song up so much and makes it incredible to listen to, but for whatever reason I don't like the drums in this version? They feel a little too overpowering and they're missing the character of the original 8 bit drums.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/273/647/a7d.jpg

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): It’s funny how this song is both super amazing and also not at all what I think the moon would sound like

**notdallin** (8.8): an historical piece of art… but the og outsold for sure

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): hyperpop

**2RINITY** (8.4): If there was one thing this remake had to nail, it was the moon theme arrangement, and they succeeded

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): This remaster is well done and adventurous while keeping its chip roots on its sleeve.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): this shit sounds like snow halation lol

**sarcasticsobs** (8): “I closed my eyes through this whole song and imagined myself in space. I ventured on Saturn’s rings, touched the icy atmosphere of Neptune, and I saw so many unique and inspiring constellations. Music like this sparks the imagination and I love the roller coaster that our mind can take us on. I’m a Christian and things like this really emphasize the magnitude and intricacies of God’s creation and I will forever be awestruck.” - YouTube user Caleb Arledge, 3 months ago (edited)

**skargardin** (8): To To To To the moon!

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.7): this was cute and energetic

**impla77** (7.3): sounds like a super mario galaxy reject

**BebeLuigi** (7): this one is fun

#HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT OBAMA!?!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Would be an easy 10 if it were the vintage bleep bloop version. This version is a little much.

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): this is a very video game theme video game

**flibbityflob** (6.5): I’m going to admit that I think I’d enjoy this more if I was listening to the original SNES version, and if I actually like….grew up on Ducktales. But I didn’t. It’s good but I think a lot of why this stuck around in the cultural memory is from nostalgia, and it’s a nostalgia I don’t have. I can think of a dozen pieces of music from video games that do what this does, just better and that make me feel things.

**vayyiqra** (6): It's so funny how fast and energetic this theme is, and then the cover art is a duck with a top hat and pince-nez glasses holding a cane.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (6): where is the giant pile of gold coins I jump into? god im grabbing a beer for this.

**frogaranaman** (5): why did these ducks go to the moon

**akanewasright** (4): I originally had no feelings about this song, but after listening to the old version… yeah that deserved over this

AND HERE IS OUR WINNER! Though it wasn't in the lead until September, once it got the spot it never let go. Ducktales put up a good fight for a bit, but eventually the gap grew too big. Maybe not the most surprising winner pick as this song also dominated the voting, but it's an incredibly deserved one. The orchestral backing knows exactly when to lift you up into some sort of joyous release. Mario Galaxy is one of my favourite games of all time, and the music was definitely a big component of it - so well done on a deserved rate win!

#Welcome to the Galaxy!

**hikk** (11): not to be the most basic bitch in the room but like.... one of the best video game songs ever composed

**rotating3Dtext** (11): play this when I die

**runaway3212** (11): Space. The Final Fun-tier

**slimboyfriend** (11): why did they go so hard on the instrumental for this random world

**theonewithoutmynudes** (11): is it a lil unfair that the whole OST consists of a literal professional orchestra maybe but god this song is so triumphant and timeless

**akanewasright** (10): Music!

**anothertown** (10): i cannot listen to any music from this game for too long without starting to cry or sob. i'm just like all these comments on all the youtube videos in this playlist fr

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): fuck yes pump the nostalgia directly into my veins

**bigbigbee** (10): I stance up whenever this song starts

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the pussy supreme of the rate let’s just be honest.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i actually didn’t know what track this was from the name alone, but as soon as it came on i was like oh shit!!! i have such fond memories of playing this with my brother, who is very far from me now and who i miss very dearly

**CrimsonROSET** (10): there’s a reason there’s a symphony recording of the galaxy ost, come on now

**DaHumanTorch** (10): main pop girl rosalina

**shipperondeck** (10): i cried to this song more than once in middle school bc i thought it was the most beautiful song ever

**Slaycoco** (10): This feels like it could be a modern official theme for Mario or even Nintendo itself. They really put their entire pussies into this one dolls.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): my absolute favorite game of all time, would be an 11 contender if this rate wasnt as stacked as it already is

**throwaway-7650** (10): if this doesn't win, what's the .

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I used to have an obsessive crush on a guy who played oboe. One day I saw him playing this song, and you can probably imagine how absolutely euphoric it was to witness. Hope he’s doing okay wherever he is

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hyped up let's go on an adventure right now!!!

**Zypker125** (10): Duh. I gave Wii Sports my 11, but let’s be real, this song should win the rate by a landslide. Next song please

**2RINITY** (9.8): The main theme of this game is an all-time classic, but this is a very close second

**2specific4google** (9.6): - There's something really lovely and whimsical about pairing space adventures with orchestral music.

**pig-serpent** (9.5): The standout song from Mario Galaxy, and for a good reason. I love the bright, cheeriness of grassland themes and Gusty Garden has an urgency to it that most other grass themes don't.

**1998tweety** (9): its giving DRAMA

**fadedblue09** (9): majestic

**rslashpoopheads** (9): timeless classic

**sarcasticsobs** (9): “Imagine in 50 years this starts to play at the retirement house we all gon start crying or something” - YouTube user AvizOnce, 1 month ago

**skargardin** (9): oh this went off

**ricki** (8.5): not sure how to explain it but this reminds me of the parent trap

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): i absolutely adore galaxy, and this theme is very pretty but also kinda does nothing for me

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): growing up as a kid with a wii i'm not sure how i never played galaxy but i just didn't

**apatel27** (8): Definitely completed Super Mario Galaxy but can't remember a thing from it outside shake wii mote to do star shooty thing

**Exaltatus** (8): I love how epic Galaxy's music was. Truly appropriate for the scale of the game.

**PhloxInvar** (7.9): I think this song starts being really good once the resonant violins start really kicking in at around a minute and twenty, and people seem to agree as evidenced by how Youtube seems to indicate that's what people most relisten to in the song. I think it's brilliant, but not top tier. Gorgeous sound though.

**flibbityflob** (7.7): the thing about Koji Kondo is like… once you’re familiar with his work you start to know what to expect, and whilst he’s a genius of the highest order, he’s also like…I’d rather listen to a dozen other composers before him, yknow? Still, this is an incredible bit of music, it’s just one I find I lack any emotional attachment to, and one that reminds me of the very very similar sounding Odyssey, and I don’t think that’s a great thing to me.

#Stuck as P2

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): what in the John Williams

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7.5): Too heroic for our goofy, shroom-eating, Italian plumber.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): This lacks the personality and quirkiness that makes Mario iconic, it just sounds like a competent orchestra

**impla77** (7.4): feels like starting a heroes journey

**notdallin** (7.3): I fear I may be too old to understand the draw people feel to calling this game a classic. I have no special attachment to it, let alone it’s soundtrack. But it’s cute I guess?

**vayyiqra** (7): should give this game a whirl sometime. My girlfriend tried to get me into it in 2012 or so; that's a long time ago. That's putting it off long enough.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (6.9): thinking of "the music of video game" concert series and how while those are job creators, they also only reproduce this kind of music.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): both mario picks having alliterated titles

**BasedButta** (2): oh I remember this. It’s from a time where, in videogame music, somehow everyone thought that orchestral = good. well orchestral music certainly is fine and even great in some situations, but here? this is a disjointed mixture of a bunch of instruments at 80dB that just ends up sounding like worthless noise (and i like noise music)

theonewithoutmynudes: If you don’t like Nintendo, think Mario games are played out, etc. I can’t fault you for that… but listening to *this* song and thinking it’s disjointed noise?? 🤕

TiltControls: Some more late stats coming! You'd think I'd have these ready as the host but I was too busy making shitposts

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up!

# Preamble

So if you take a look at the artists for the tracks (and also for VGI) you might notice that they're a bit of a mess. In the next update to the songlist (usually released around December) I am planning to add a proper series sections for pieces from media (would also apply to rates like Disney Movies and LADN). Unfortunately I'm not ready with it yet and I'm going to have to come back and add composer info to these songs once I do, so for now I've left them off. Just know that things like that are coming in the future!

# Songs

Congratulations to **Gusty Garden Galaxy** for pulling off the well-deserved, though predicted, win! Across all songs GGG comes **426th**. It ties with Avril Lavigne's I'm With You and Zara Larsson's Lush Life. It places right below Fiona Apple's Limp and places higher than a couple tied songs include Michael Jackson's Billie Jean (from Winners I), Katy Perry's Hot N Cold (from 2009 Year End), Ellie Goulding's Lights (from Alternative Pop Queens), and The Go-Go's We Got The Beat (from NWG). 

It also does **not** take the previous record for highest instrumental track, which was set by Mii Channel Theme. (8.918 vs. 8.942)

(Also for those curious, for **highest controversy** Lavender Town comes 48th across all songs. Not enough to land on the top 25 leaderboard)


# Artists

Without the series update mentioned earlier, there's not much use of this category as things tagged as series are not added to the artist leaderboard. However; Persona, Final Fantasy, and Sonic all *technically* have enough songs to show up here, so this is where they'd place otherwise.

_


* 154th: TOMORROW X TOGETHER / Alanis Morissette (7.585)
* **156th: Persona [series] (7.578) [NEW]**
* 157th: Cyndi Lauper (7.577) 

_


* 278th: MisterWives (7.000)
* **279th: Final Fantasy [series] (6.983) [NEW]**
* 280th: Jess Glynne / *NSYNC (6.968) 

_


* 288th: Madison Beer (6.936)
* **289th: Sonic the Hedgehog [series] (6.935) [NEW]**
* 290th: ITZY (6.905) 

# Rates

Video Game Instrumentals places 9th with the **highest 11 spread across songs**. 77.50% managed to get at least someone's 11! (31 out of 40)
