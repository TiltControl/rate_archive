Video Game Instrumentals Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wqr7y2/video_game_instrumentals_rate/

Sept 24 update: The last of the extensions will be coming in Monday night (Americas time zone). If you are planning to submit a ballot please either do it in the next 24 hours or let me know so I can wait for yours! Once I get the final ballot from the extension list, submissions will be CLOSED! 

This is a short rate (just a bit over 2h) so even if you're on the fence about participating I highly recommend you do!

##**Intro**

[Hello gamers](https://c.tenor.com/Jn0ENz9SKYkAAAAM/kirby-wave.gif) and welcome to the official posting of the [Video Game Instrumental Rate](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/704859238563840073/1009220463257460777/unknown.png)! Video games have been a massive media staple over the past 40 years, and although we looked into the songs focused on vocals and lyrics last year it's time for us to tackle the big beast of video game instrumentals!

With over 300 submissions in the voting thread last week we have narrowed down our rate tracks! Though there were many close submissions that would've been fantastic these ended up being the best of the bunch.

**Reminder on the criteria:** these were games or gaming related applications that focused on instrumentation primarily (as opposed to last year's rate which was for vocals. [You can check a recap of those results here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/o4chsj/video_game_vocal_reveal_day_3_for_the_songs_that/h2h4wxe/)). Some of these tracks may still have vocals, but they aren't the primary focus and are a minor component of the track. Also there was a limit of 1 per game, with duplicate series were heavily limited unless they did extraordinarily well in the voting (the 3 duplicate series in the final list had both of their representative songs in the top 15 highest votes)

[The voting thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wl0vwv/video_game_instrumental_minirate_voting_thread/) itself is off contest mode if you wish to know how your submissions did, though try to avoid adding/removing any new upvotes to keep the order as similar as it was to when the polling finished. 

##**Rules**

- **You must listen to every song in the main rate and assign it a score from 1 to 10.**
 - Scores should only be to a max of one decimal place. So 9 or 9.4 are valid, but 9.45 is a no go.
 - **You are allowed to give one song an 11 and one song a 0**. These should be reserved for your favourite and least favourite tracks. You are not required to use these. It is also highly recommended you leave comments for your 11 and 0.
- Speaking of comments, **comments are highly encouraged!** They aren't required but it adds flavour to the rate and helps give your thoughts on the track. Comments should be formatted by commenting after the song without adding anything else. For an example:
 - Life Is Strange - Golden Hour: 10 Kacey Musgraves is my favourite video game character
- As long as you tell me before the due date, you are also free to change your comments or scores at any point! You can message me here on Reddit (u/TiltControls) or on discord at TiltControls#5066
- **Do not sabotage!** This is a grab bag so there's a bit more leniency, but rate the songs based on how much you enjoy them, not to just get them to win by tanking their competitors. Writing comments for your hot takes can go a long way. I may ask you to provide a comment if I suspect foul play.
- For your scores please send a ballot using the

Only half of the songs are on streaming, so you'll need to use Youtube regardless. As sometimes songs are taken down (thanks to a certain company in the rate) please let me know if you notice any videos are missing and I'll replace them as soon as I can.

##**Other Rates**

Don't forget to do the other currently open rates! Charity 4 closes at the end of the week so if you haven't gotten on that you should hurry! Live Action Disney/Nick and Y2UK Girl Groups are due within the next month, so don't forget to submit for them either! You can message the hosts if you have questions.

Theme | Hosts | Due
---|---|---
[Charity Rate 4](https://redd.it/vpw2b5)|/u/CarlieScion & /u/skargardin|August 19
[Live Action Disney/Nick Soundtracks](https://redd.it/wejz02)|/u/ImADudeDuh, /u/NapsAndNetflix & /u/TragicKingdom1|September 10
[Y2UK Girl Groups](https://redd.it/wejz9z)|/u/darjeelingdarkroast & /u/berober04|September 16

Also if you can't get enough of rate discussion the **[Popheads Discord](https://discord.gg/57C67VBs)** is always lively! The **[rate channel](https://discord.com/channels/236918780129705985/292042312958083075)** is where a lot of rate discussion happens which will be especially important once the next voting cycle goes up in the next month!
