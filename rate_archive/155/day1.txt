I still stand by this being game music and valid for this rate so it's included. Though it does stetch the definition of game more than most of the list, I'd still argue educational activites like this can still be done in a game sense (though maybe it's cause I was already out of school when this came out and was never subjected to it). Anyways I think it's a valid submission and deserves a spot in the rate

But also I hate it so it gets the 0. Feels like generic 80's stock music. I wouldn't have scored this as low if [regular Kahoot theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnnUD9-hD8A) made it in

---

#A-Students

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I thought this was a joke submission but it goes way harder that it needs to

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok in hindsight i should've submitted the original but i really did not think this would get in. oops

**Hulnia** (10): the original is still better though ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Roxieloxie** (10): you all are HATERS !! this should WIN

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): gamer anthem, very funny here. god i used kahoot for my last film class during COVID. hated that class. watched birth of a nation at 2x speed and later, a lot of other silent films while playing Astral Spirits tapes. I was not in a good place. i promise im better and more thoughtful.

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): idk what a kahoot is but apparently it's a trivia game for schools how did it end up with the coolest retro wave loop ever

**bigbigbee** (9): I don‚Äôt get why people were that mad that this got in? it‚Äôs good! Then again I never had to use Kahoot so maybe there‚Äôs some trauma there

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Make this song longer!!!

**seanderlust** (9): just another main pop girl wanting to make blinding lights soooo bad üôÑ

**stupidslappa** (9): a bop. I‚Äôm jumping to the 80s bandwagon kids!

**turtle\_on\_mars** (8.8): Now that I'm in grad school, no one wants to kahoot anymore so this was a very nice blast from the past

**BasedButta** (8.5): YO

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Seeing Kahoot in here takes me back to my high school days where we played this a lot (probably the best part about high school imo). This remix fucking rules btw.

**1998tweety** (8): this bops but I must remove a point because of the snubbery to the original

**qazz23** (8): well this definitely sounds 80's to me

**vayyiqra** (8): I like when the song goes bleepbloop

**hikk** (7.5): kind of bops but... why not the original?

**impla77** (7.5): surely doesn't have to slap this hard

**PhloxInvar** (7.5): Iz good.

# Random Guessers

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Kinda pissed at this selection because the original version is highkey an 11 contender.

**Exaltatus** (7): I like it generally, wish it were a bit longer, though.

**pig-serpent** (7): Kahoot has updated its music selection since I regularly played in 2015 and this new synthwave song is nice, but still kind of generic. People eat this up though.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): blinding lights core has gone too far üôÑ

**Rigumaro** (7): It's catchy, it's good. But it doesn't make me really feel anything.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Smh every song is trying to be Blinding Lights these days

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): elevator music if elevator music slayed

**2specific4google** (6.3): - I keep thinking the intro is leading up to a song from Sayonara Wild Hearts! Get out of here!!!!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): i'll admit, this is a pretty well done version of the kahoot lobby music, but it's still the fucking kahoot lobby music

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i cant make it not bop but like she doesn‚Äôt even go here

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (6): Cookie cutter synth arpeggios. Sounds corporate and sanitized to me.

**nt96** (6): very 80s

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): was Kahoot really that much of a moment!?

**Zypker125** (6): Stranger Things OST called, they want their music back

**fortyfive33** (5): wait what

**JayElecHanukkah** (5): ehhh it's very like "wow have you ever heard of the 80s???"

**skargardin** (5): I'm sorry to all the Kahoot stans

**welcome2thejam** (5): I don't even know what Kahoot is, I'm just gonna assume it's related to the Duolingo owl

**theonewithoutmynudes** (4.8): she's pretty cute but maybe stretching the definition of video game here

**2RINITY** (4): Oh, boy, an instrumental '80's synthpop homage from decades later, not like we already have a zillion of those

**BebeLuigi** (4): I guess it does count as a video game

**thedoctordances1940** (3.7): i do not know why this version is here and it's not even a good synthwave song it's just boring, luckily it's as short as it is

**flibbityflob** (3): should have been an actual video game piece of music I feel nothing but apathy listening to this. I have no idea how this goes when I can hum you basically every other piece of music on this rate.

**frogaranaman** (3): what's y'alls go to Kahoot name mine is Tess Stickles

**Slaycoco** (3): Generic 80‚Äôs inspired codswallop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i hope everyone who ‚Äúironically‚Äù upvoted this in the voting form and got this in over actually good songs from bayonetta and kid icarus has an awful day

**AzettImpa** (2): who tf put this on here‚Ä¶

**akanewasright** (1): no

**apatel27** (1): 80s inspired synth worship has gone too far

**runaway3212** (1): yeah this is horrible but imagine if it was the original

**shipperondeck** (1): fuck this getting in instead of literally any fighting game song

**notdallin** (0): it‚Äôs the fact that you guys voted this in‚Äîwhen ANYTHING from Ocarina of Time or Chrono Trigger was right there‚Äîis what gives me trust issues

**steelstepladder** (0): Ka-who?

**StroHersh** (0): - we should not let children use the internet, let alone reddit

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): some parts in this irritate me to no end.

**throwaway-7650** (0): it's fine really but shouldn't be in the rate!

So my fun learning fact of the rate was that the drummer of The Police, Stewart Copeland, did a ton of work on the Spyro franchise (including this track). AND that the Amanda Show took its music from the Spyro franchise. It's a fine track, but really feels out of its element compared to some of the other massive tracks up in this rate.

---

#He was a sk8er boi

**nt96** (10): an underrated classic but the uploader is annoying af

**steelstepladder** (10): I have a Spyro tattoo so‚Ä¶ yeah

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the whistling, the sound effects, the chaos goes hard

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): stream The Police - Synchronicity

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): The bass??? I feel like the final product here needs a little more ‚Äúoomph‚Äù in terms of production, but still very good

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): the limitations of the 5th generation of consoles automatically dates not just graphics, but music. everything has a crisp layer of compression attached to these brilliantly fun electronic instrumentals. perhaps one day we will untether them

**1998tweety** (8): boppy

**anothertown** (8): this is so funny like it sounds exactly like the title.. an enchanted skate park

**rslashpoopheads** (8): go off furries

**skargardin** (8): iconic minigame

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Vote for the Tony Hawk rate.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): there‚Äôs a direct line from this to gecs

**impla77** (7): cute groovy song

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): put this in Tony Hawk, you won't, cowards

**shipperondeck** (7): STEWART COPELAND WORKED ON THIS?

#See you l8er boi

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this sounds like a song that reddit sex guy would have in his playlist

**vayyiqra** (7): And why he ourple üòÇ

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Spyro knows how to skate?? The things I missed when I became a Nintendo kid

**flibbityflob** (6.7): this sure sounds like an early 2000s skate park! And I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good thing!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): tony hawk rate when

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (6.5): Actually kindof annoying and repetitive. Instrumentation is lacklustre.

**2RINITY** (6): Stewart Copeland is a legend, but I'm sorry, this composition is WAY too restrained. If your cartoon animal mascot is skateboarding in your '90's platforming game, the music needs to be as obnoxiously X-TREEM as possible

**BasedButta** (6): the dragon‚Ä¶ skates? well the squeaky sound kinda rocks but this song makes me anxious

**Exaltatus** (6): I loved Spyro, but can't remember this area at all for some reason.

**frogaranaman** (6): radical

**throwaway-7650** (6): not feeling this

**celladonn** (5): The Enchanted Towers skate park is such a legendary zone but the music is not so iconic imo

**pig-serpent** (5): The sound font is cool at first but that bassline started grating on me fairly quickly.

**Slaycoco** (5): Meh

**StroHersh** (5): - joke house song

**akanewasright** (4.5): I‚Äôve heard this song so many times and still have no impression on it other than ‚Äúthe drummer from the police wrote this????‚Äù

**runaway3212** (4.5): I don't get why some of the songs here are beloved classics

**BebeLuigi** (4): a bit whatever

**indie\_fan\_** (4): eh, gets too uninteresting and repetitive after a while

**PhloxInvar** (4): Why does it sound like there's zippers in the song?

**Rigumaro** (4): It feels weird because I guess every song on this list is supposed to be amazing, but this one is not doing much for me. It feels like there's stuff in the arrangement that should be taken out.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (4): quite repetitive and the whistling was offputting

**seanderlust** (3.7): sorry gamers i don't like some of the sounds in this one

**apatel27** (3): It exists

**Hulnia** (3): they really did the bed squeaking thing before drake did üò≠

**welcome2thejam** (3): Tony Hawk's doing 900's in his grave right now

**Zypker125** (2.6): I have no idea what this song is going for. It sounds very eerie and discomforting, but then it oscillates to becoming more mellow and upbeat.

**shhhneak** (2.5): Not Xtreme enough for a 2000s skate park.

**notdallin** (1): this is truly barely a song

It may not match the iconicness of the DK Rap, but Grant Kirkhope will forever be an icon. I think there's much better in terms of Banjo tracks out there, but this one is definitely one of the most memorable. I've always been a fan of the holiday-ness of [Freezeezy Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQedZAUXKCY). And of course have to mention the [Main Title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGWwe4OysKA), which I think would've been my preferred choice for a BK track, and [its Smash remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tMGMq3p86k) rearranged by Masafumi Takada (also known in this rate context as the guy who did the Danganronpa soundtracks)

#Getting Jiggy with it

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this is like if the circus came to frontierland and that is an unhinged yet perfect combo

**qazz23** (10): good intro level music, I also like the hub theme that changes as you go near each level

**nt96** (9.5): Banjo you will always be that bitch

**Exaltatus** (9): Banjo-Kazooie is my shit, love using the soundtrack to the series as background music

**Rigumaro** (9): It's a very iconic tune, and I may be biased because of the nostalgia and it being one of my favorite games. Lowered it down to nine because it can be tiring listening it for a long time, though.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): why aren't we doing the banjo kazooie theme? one time as a kid I discovered those videos of ppl uploading custom tracks 2 guitar hero 2 and I rlly wanted the banjo kazzoie theme. I told my family around the dinner table. they were clearly distraught. as an xbox gamer, I only ever rlly played the misunderstood Nutz & Bolts, which was too fucking hard at the age of 10-13 imo. idk what happened there. Imo Microsoft buying Rare was one of the dumbest fucking moves ever (in SPITE of releasing at least 4 honestly good games a bunch of assholes couldn't properly contextualize [bc they didn't realize the shooter ppl went to make timesplitters or whatever] or just accept--Kameo elements of power?! HIGHLY underrated! grabbed by the ghoulies? HAD IDEAS NOT WELL IMPLEMENTED). Out of that, Viva Pi√±ata, my first xbox 360 game, still remains one of the greatest things ever. the whole romance aspect of that game is funny as hell. idk rare was genius,

**anothertown** (8): malls, coffee shops, government buildings,

**apatel27** (8): redneck bear ftw

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This really makes me want to touch some virtual grass.

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): this big thief song rules

**pig-serpent** (8): One of the greatest games ever made, and Grant Kirkhope is a musical genius who expertly weaves new textures and sounds into fairly repetitive melodies. Personally I think this song stands out less that a lot of his other songs but it's still a great example of why I love his work.

**Roxieloxie** (8): leapfrog music

**skargardin** (8): spiraling, but make it camp

**throwaway-7650** (8): spiral (twist) mountain from B/W outsold

**2RINITY** (7.5): Always down for music from the bear game

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): guh huh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): cotton eye joe slaps here

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): the animal noises go hard

**CrimsonROSET** (7): e i e i o

**sarcasticsobs** (7): ‚ÄúThis music sounds like when the farm has a lot of chickens‚Äù - YouTube user Brian Shen, 3 months ago

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Knowing how this sub treats anything vaguely related to country I don‚Äôt expect high marks

**welcome2thejam** (7): Running to Disney World right now to pitch them an incredible new idea for the Splash Mountain retheme

#Guh Huh

**flibbityflob** (6.8): I‚Äôm SORRY Grant, as much as Banjo has an incredible soundtrack, it‚Äôs one of these games that has a soundtrack limited by the hardware - where other consoles before the N64 could play music from a dedicated sound chip, the N64 was forced to rely on the CPU, which really limited the sounds, it also didn‚Äôt force composers into boxes of forced creativity as the 8-bit and 16-bit consoles did. Also, like, I just never played Banjo and don‚Äôt have that fondness that others do. It‚Äôs a repetitive soundtrack piece, but not in a fun way. Still, Kirkhope is a legend for a reason, and I very much adore him and won‚Äôt slander him too much.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): why are the bird noises in the song, that's so annoying

**impla77** (6.7): a bop but also kinda annoying

**1998tweety** (6.5): it does in fact give off a spiral mountain vibe

**2l82bstr8** (6.5): I liked the banjo there just wasn't enough kazooie

**akanewasright** (6.5): there‚Äôs charm and whimsy here, but idk if this is working for me as well as it would if I‚Äôd played the game

**BasedButta** (6.5): i like the birdies :)

**bigbigbee** (6.5): The Smash re-recording would have gotten a 10. I like this for what it is - a very friendly, peppy song that's like, good for a silly little game about a bear and his bird.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (6.5): An iconic tune that I wouldn't bother listening to out of game. This was my first N64 game so it gets an extra half point for that.

**notdallin** (6.4): I‚Äôm sure the nostalgia would kick in if I actually played this game but rn I‚Äôm just like, why are there so many bird sounds??

**fortyfive33** (6): Grabbed by the Ghoulies is Rare's best game don't @ me

**Slaycoco** (6): A Classique but far from the best of what this series has to offer.

**stupidslappa** (6): not in my childhood but sounds decent.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): any song with a banjo on it is automatically gonna sound goofy no matter what you do with it

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6): this might hit different if I grew up with the game but since I didn't it's sorta basic giving very tutorial level of the game

**cremeebrulee** (5.3): okay now let's do a goofy one

**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like it's a hard level to beat

**hikk** (5): never played banjo just watched youtube playthroughs of it lmao. so it doesn't really hold nostalgia and this song is kind of just whatever

**MrMushrooms** (5): Never played this game as a kid and all the random animal sounds are really annoying to me...

**runaway3212** (5): this is fun and bouncy but also I got sick of it after listening for more than half a minute

**seanderlust** (5): girl bye this sounds like a song that would be played during the splash mountain ride at disneyland

**PhloxInvar** (4.5): Don't get me wrong, this song is a very cheery juvenile well-made track perfectly tailored to the game and excellent for most people... I just don't have any emotional attachment, nor am I developing one from listening to it. It's not a genre I go for. So yeah.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): this game is an absolute classic but this track kinda annoys the hell out of me i'm so sorry

**shipperondeck** (4): ik this song is iconic but i seriously cannot deal with the animal noises im sorry

**Zypker125** (3.7): The xylophone(?) is nice, but the bird sounds get annoying and the song is overall too monotonous

**BebeLuigi** (3): pretty boring

**celladonn** (3): this is driving me insane a little bit

**vayyiqra** (3): Yeah if you went into this not knowing anything about this game, you'd definitely think "this is about what one ought to expect from a game called Banjo-Kazooie". No one can fault it for that! Doesn't mean I like it though. (Still a good game)

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Banjo-Kazooie more like Banjo-Midisynthazooie

For a while this was fighting for its life at the bottom with Kahoot. However, some late high scores managed to bump it out of the bottom 3, despite having a ton of 0's and the highest controversy in the rate. For the song itself, it does what it needs to do, and a really incredible job at it. Unfortunately that job is not making me enjoy the music. It's fine as an atmosphere piece, but I don't really want to listen to it outside of that, even if it is Halloween soon.

If we're talking overworld music from the original games, you can't beat the iconicness of [Road to Cerulean City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-KueQMr2I)

#Spooky

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Halloween classic! They truly harnessed the limitations of the medium to create a perfectly haunted-sounding and unstelling experience. Even before knowing the disturbing backstory of Lavender Town, this soundtrack makes you feel like something is off.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (11): saintly 11 dispatched to one cut I spent a lot of time in 2011 and 2012 on bungie dot net's the flood sub board. I dunno if I miss it because I shouldn't have been on there, but it was a place filled with randoms and was less chaotic than 4chan (even then I knew "dont go there!"). If a post got over 50 comments on the flood, it'd sorta become a long running thread and wouldn't close after a day or two and could possibly be open for weeks, if not months. This kind of possibility of the internet always fascinated me--it happened with Emily St. James' AV club review of the szn 3 community finale that had over 100,00 comments over summer 2012, could it happen on the flood? Well, there are two threads that warrant mention: the fellow who sought after an old animated short about a clockman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3hBYS6M-m0) that took over 5+ years to find but DID happen & the creepypasta thread. Candle Cove, Slenderman LSD Dream Emulator, Squidward's Suicide, & Lavender Town...this is where I found out about them from a user who was explaining and proving the stories wrong, perhaps to alleviate the fears or possible "cursed" aura. I never got into r/nosleep or whatnot, likely an indirect result of sorta seeing a user lay out the falsified levels of creepypastas those years earlier. The Lavender Town creepypasta was just too insane! BUT the track itself really does grow with each year?! The reverb + lone hanging drone with pitter patter percussive sound like a liturgical death march. what was going on at the time?! insane vibe on the track that codified "spoopy" for the internet age and set us on a path forward towards warping our collective memories. what more to say?

**1998tweety** (10): this is my vecna sound thing idk I didn't watch the show

**anothertown** (10): there's just something about gameboy soundfonts that makes me wanna bust a mother fuckin move.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Spookyphobia is gonna hit this hard and it‚Äôs so sad.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): need Spellling to sing over the updated version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngmxG3MzlRI&t=16s

**diamondsandglass** (10): obviously

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): whoa did you know that the cubone is REALLY DEAD FOR REAL IN REAL LIFE, WITH REALISTIC BLOOD???

**pig-serpent** (10): Nothing else matches the blown out chiptune eerieness of this song. There's a reason the only creepypastas I ever read unironically were all related to Lavander town.

**ricki** (10): sad to think i was LIVING at the lavender town concert while others were commiting suicide due to the depressive impulses implanted into their brain via this song

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Goth

**vayyiqra** (10): My bestie u/JayElecHanukkah said "Lavender Town is an alltime 2009 era creepy pasta track" and he was right, you know? Far from my favourite theme in Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow but still there is no denying it's both weirdly catchy and very eerie.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): behold, the mother of all creepypastas

**frogaranaman** (9): I feel like I'm about to have some creepypasta lore read to me

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (9): I'm not sure it's possible to make spookier Gameboy music than this. An iconic song for the whole system.

**MrMushrooms** (9): An iconic spooky anthem

**nt96** (9): makes me wanna die

**Rigumaro** (9): While it's not a song I really enjoy listening to, it's incredible how can it make you feel so much dread an uneasiness with just 8 bit chiptunes. It's impressive.

**shhhneak** (9): That era a decade ago when being afraid of this was a personality trait??

**skargardin** (9): iconic!!

**throwaway-7650** (9): y'all are haters if this goes out first

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.1): so spooky honestly if this were a later gen version of this song I would have gone with a higher score

**celladonn** (8): this isn't as good as i remember it being but still an iconic spooky little track

**Exaltatus** (8): Huh, I can see what people were saying about this being real creepy.

**plastichaxan** (8): Yoko Ono Why vibes

**qazz23** (8): calming in a weird way, love these oldschool sounds

**stupidslappa** (8): My nostalgia and bias LOL

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): They had three sound channels and a vision

**welcome2thejam** (8): Behind you

**notdallin** (7.9): it does what it supposed to do‚Ä¶ and what it‚Äôs supposed to do is freak me tf out

**runaway3212** (7): she's not good but she did not deserve the hate

**slimboyfriend** (7): I don‚Äôt think this was meant to be listened to on headphones

**Stryxen** (7): overhated probably

#Ghostbusters

**2RINITY** (7): Whatever creepy vibes this piece was supposed to convey, the Internet has destroyed them and replaced them with "Uh-oh! Stinky! Poooooop! Hahahaha"

**hikk** (7): pokemon having soooooo many amazing bops and bangers and yet this is in... i get that it is iconic and truly a piece of internet history but

**PhloxInvar** (6.5): Ah, the source of many creepypasta songs. It does its creepy vibe incredibly well, especially for how goddamn old this song is. By itself, I probably wouldn't listen to it that much, but it's a decent song just not my style.

**flibbityflob** (6): My first Pok√©mon game was X, and I mean, I think so much of why this has stuck in the memory is that it‚Äôs such a nostalgic part of the childhood of so many Pok√©mon players, but I‚Äôm 23 and grew up with YouTube and a 3DS, I didn‚Äôt need Pok√©mon to scare the shit out of me.

**BebeLuigi** (5): I mean, it wasn't chosen because it's a nice ost so I won't say something mean about it in this comment...

**bigbigbee** (5): scared the sh*t out of me when I was 7! Objectively conic but not a pleasant listen IMHO

**StroHersh** (5): - creepypasta legened but ass to listen too

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i cant believe yall let a song from a creepypasta meme its way into this rate

**DaHumanTorch** (4.5): confession: i've never played a pok√©mon game in my life so i have zero nostalgia boosting this

**Slaycoco** (4): I know it is legendary but I daurnt rly like listening to it! Especially this version which makes my ears BLEED.

**steelstepladder** (4): this makes me lavender frown

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): I didn‚Äôt know Pokemon made horror games

**2specific4google** (3): - It's overrated and not even a bop. Even if it consists of beeps and boops.

**apatel27** (3): HeY GUyz dID yoU KnOW LaVEndeR ToWN iS HauNTed!? ü§™ü§™ü§™

**impla77** (1.3): this is unsettling

**akanewasright** (1): The way this just straight up sucks

**BasedButta** (1): very funny

**indie\_fan\_** (1): nope nope nope back away satan, not today!

**rslashpoopheads** (1): hey why does pokemon get 2 reps anyways this song is good but the original sound is honestly so grating

**CrimsonROSET** (0): this would have been a 10 in a meme rate but like sonically i dont care for it

**RandomHypnotica** (0): for all the creepypasta's in the world, that can't change this absolutely vile and painful song

**seanderlust** (0): sorry this one honestly gives me a headache

**shipperondeck** (0): this is the epitome of that "classic but mid" mentality yall loved to exercise when voting for songs. except this is just shit.

**Zypker125** (0): This song is so atrocious that it got people to actually believe that hundreds of kids ages 7-12 committed suicide after listening to this song.

Though I had a good friend with an Xbox and had some fun times with Halo, outside of my Nintendo experience I was with Sony for the PS3/360 competition. inFamous 2 and Uncharted 2 are two of my fave games of all time and the console also had some other good series like Last of Us, LittleBigPlanet, etc.

**anothertown** (11): my ps4 that i bought at the absolute end of its generation.. youre gonna go far kid

**Blazingscourge** (11): Exclusive and pretty and I had one it would be an 11.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Damn Sony, Where'd You Find This?

**Exaltatus** (11): The PS exclusives blow Xbox completely out of the water.

**flibbityflob** (11): better exclusives

**frogaranaman** (11): I am forced to take a side here

**hikk** (11): has a lot better exclusives

**JayElecHanukkah** (11): I just love the exclusives, things like Rachel and Clark, the final of us, lord of fighting, not mapped yet, very famous but for a bad reason, horizontal none morning, and the others

**nt96** (11): its franchises may not be as diverse as Nintendo's but they sure as hell beat Xbox by a landslide

**qazz23** (11): PS4life, except 3 where I went with the 360

**RandomHypnotica** (11): the PS2 was my first console, i still love this baby dearly

**runaway3212** (11): I love FIFA

**shhhneak** (11): I‚Äôve only ever had a PS3 but we had fun back in the day.

**shipperondeck** (11): they support fighting games a little more and i play fgs with their controllers so they win

**slimboyfriend** (11): playstation is queer

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): flops compared to almost any nintendo console though

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): PC masterrace

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I'm a Nintendo fanboy through and through, but in fact my first ever console was a PS2! So I have a soft spot for it‚Ä¶

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (11): this is entirely just for the existence of until dawn

**1998tweety** (0): flop

**apatel27** (0): Everyone I knew that had a Playstation 3 were dicks. PS1/2 were great tho.

**AzettImpa** (0): really good games, I like both

**rona NG+** (0): see my console vs pc ranking

**sarcasticsobs** (0): The Adventures of Cookie & Cream still the most difficult game of all time. Of all time!!

**vayyiqra** (0): It's a good line of consoles, lots of great titles, tended to be technically better (higher specs) than its competition at the time. At the peak of the rivalry with Nintendo though it was mainly a gimmick that it had "edgier" titles (more violent etc.) which left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, not even always true; there were lots of M-rated Nintendo games in the late 90s and early 2000s.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (0): the dvd player killed the dreamcast--evil. the blu ray player killed the hd dvd player--chaotic good. The ps3 launch flopped so goddamn hard its still impossible imo to EVER recover from that 2k6 press conference (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pRqKffIjCDU). They made fun of the XBone bc the world wasnt ready for what microsoft was doing. Dualshock is ass. I hate that controller for cod. I bet the exclusives slap tho.

**Zypker125** (0): I really couldn't care less between Xbox and Playstation so I Googled the differences and a Reddit thread said that Playstation cockblocked backwards compatibility, so I guess I'm giving this my 0.

**1998tweety** (11): i was more of a nintendo girly but we got an xbox before a playstation so she wins!

**apatel27** (11): Better exclusives and better controller. Nothing on PS3 came close to Halo, Gears of War or Viva Pinata during the time I played on consoles. While PS2 > Xbox and no opinion on after, the xbox controller is one of the best to ever exist.

**AzettImpa** (11): honestly both are fine. Xbox has Gamepass though

**rona NG+** (11): see my console vs pc ranking

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Gotta go with what I was raised on, sitting in the Halo 2 lobby on mute while 10-year olds calling me racial slurs and telling me they slept with my mother. Sorry I was better at the game than you! Get good!

**vayyiqra** (11): This category is one I don't have strong feelings on but if I had to own one I guess Xbox is better? More games I'd play? Idk.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (11): man what a console line in soite of dipshit names. gave us Halo. Gave us the sega dealz gave us the xbla. Gave us the HD Dvd player (thru 2007; https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uB3KA2GVgis), gave us halo 2 xbox live. Gave us netflic with reactions for a few years. Gave us an early idea of reissues and cross-platform ports. Gave us the best shooter controller. Gave us halo waypoint. Gave us crimson skies. Gave us netflixbox in hd. Gave us basically a steam store. Gave us god tier backwards compatibility that truly revealed what a console could/would/should do. Gave us the xbox live vision cam where you could expose yourself on Uno. Gave us Yaris. Gave us Gears. Gave us Halo. HaloBox have me making halo 1 energy shield sounds!

**Zypker125** (11): I really couldn't care less between Xbox and Playstation so I Googled the differences and a Reddit thread said that Playstation cockblocked backwards compatibility, so I guess I'll give my most reluctant 11 ever to Xbox.

**anothertown** (0): stinky

**BasedButta** (0): honestly fuck the xbox for coming out with a controller that inverts the classic SNES layout and has different colors from the playstation one so it's the most confusing shit ever and most pc games use it just to spite me.

I think this is one that goes a lot harder in game than it does on its own. In game it feels like the climax of the trial using a mechanic that was woefully underused imo (though it did make you appreciate it more when it came up). I can see how this would be grating, but to me it's an intense track to match the intense atmosphere. 

On the whole, Masafumi Takada did a killer job with the soundtracks, though tbh most of my favourite songs are wayyy too depressing to have considered putting into the rate. The haunting and oppressive atmosphere on [Desire for Execution / Deathwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHlKfNSiM2c) makes it one of my favourite tracks ever (I've put over 1000 plays on it (somehow) last I checked)!

---

#Ultimates

**diamondsandglass** (11): I know this one is going to be controversial because the game's fandom has a... reputation, but the music is really well crafted and Masadumi Takada deserves a lot of respect. Also it goes hard as fuck don't come for me

**AzettImpa** (10): it‚Äôs just really really hype and perfect. wish it was used in the game more

**CrimsonROSET** (10): 6 > 5 > 1 > 2 > 4 > 3 literally do not @ me

**PhloxInvar** (10): This shit is HYPE. The fakeout drop after the first one might turn people off, but the even more hype second drop makes up for it. I like the small reprieve to give that final drop more impact.

**throwaway-7650** (10): my pfp is makoto naegi

**Zypker125** (10): Almost gave this my 11 despite this being my first time hearing this song. The intensity and dramatic tension of this song fuck HARD, although it is a bit too repetitive for my liking.

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): feeling like an imposter fan because i never technically played DR (only read through someone's playthrough on tumblr LMFAO) but this goes off in a very dated electropop way

**1998tweety** (9): killing (fifth) harmony('s career)

**2RINITY** (9): Are we sure this is from a visual novel and not Tekken? 'Cause this shit sounds like Tekken character select music to me, and that's high praise

**BebeLuigi** (9): The real despair is that we never got to hear it long enough in game because scrum debates are so short

**hikk** (9): never touched danganronpa in my life but as someone forever stuck in early 10s edm era im enjoying it

**runaway3212** (9): so true vote 2010s EDM rate

**skargardin** (9): now here's a BOP

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.2): not my favorite DR song but it does make me want to dance

**BasedButta** (8): in the club scrumming

**Exaltatus** (8): Find me in the club bopping to this.

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): wow underworld let's go

**pig-serpent** (8): Hey, can you turn down those EDM bangers, we're trying to have a proper argument here!

**seanderlust** (8): I can't believe i've paid $300 for an EDM fest ticket when all I needed to do to hear a banger was just to play fucking danganronpa

**stupidslappa** (8): I love house especially when it‚Äôs a bgm of a popular VN

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this would go crazy at a video game themed rave

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): imagine Britney serving on top of this instrumental Femme-Fatale style

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): i know very little about these games and i would like to keep it that way. song's good though

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I KIN KOKICHI! WHO DO YOU KIN? NAGITO? (snarling growl noise)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): danganronpa is such an iconic series with a great soundtrack... but this song is kinda generic and uninteresting to me üò≠

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Not really my thing but I respect the rave.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): It's dope, but it kinda overstays its welcome and could've easily been shortened by a lot

**rslashpoopheads** (7): not even a top 20 danganronpa instrumental track tbh

**shhhneak** (7): Danganronpa fans scare me but this is fire.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this could be a pitbull instrumental

**vayyiqra** (7): Idk what Danganronpa is and the way you all talk about it kind of scares me so I will not be trying it.

#Reserve Course

**anothertown** (6): we have danganronpa and we have undertale so if we don't hear fingers in his ass sunday in the queup i'll be disrespect

**flibbityflob** (6): Takada Masafumi is a really fucking good composer, and the EDM really adds to the tension that builds throughout the game, but the problem is, I‚Äôve not played DR3, and whilst you can feel that building tension, it‚Äôs just not quite the same. I know we should be judging these based on musical feelings alone, but one of the best feelings is listening to this music in context, and it‚Äôs hard to describe those feelings out of context. Still. It bops.

**frogaranaman** (6): vote for the Golden Age of EDM grab bag next cycle

**qazz23** (6): kinda repetitive but good beat drop

**Rigumaro** (6): It's hard to give such a lukewarm score because all these must be great songs, but this one is not really my thing.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): even David Guetta would find this too generic

**sarcasticsobs** (6): 2013 Electric Daisy Carnival: Las Vegas-ass song

**shipperondeck** (6): oh god i know this song. IT'S IN SO MANY MEMES LMFAO. damn it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Techno is not really my vibe

**welcome2thejam** (6): Love the word "scrum"

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): Heat Up themes go harder

**2specific4google** (5): - Of all the DR tracks, this is the one that made it? It's fine I guess.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (5): Uninspired synths. Clich√© key change. Barely any progression. Artist must have a glow stick stuck up their butt.

**notdallin** (5): anybody wanna do some laser tag?

**ricki** (5): white\_girls\_dancing\_to\_the\_oonts\_oonts\_at\_the\_club.gif

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): It sounds like faceless edm

**akanewasright** (4): you just know some weeb of a DJ uses this in all of their sets

**apatel27** (4): I want to like it but it's giving Britain's Got Talent wait music

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): what in the David Guetta

**Slaycoco** (4): Very bland tbh. Again, imo there are far better tracks in this series!

**Stryxen** (4): dated and nothing special really

**impla77** (3.4): this is pretty grating

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (3): so you all just wanted to do a bigfest EDM rate? you can just say it. like this was just a trojan horse to tie nostalgia to dubstep or big fest EDM? man I'd mute this and put on Justice's Black and Gold T album (2007), the high bar for dipshit EDM.

**Hulnia** (0): lol this is the worst song i‚Äôve ever heard in a rate apart from MAYBE clementine. i hate everything about it, but that buildup from about 1:40-2:40 is especially horrible. i guess the terrible games have to get the terrible songs. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I never really made it far into Life is Strange, but I really love how calming this track is. It sounds like it'd be good as a sleep aid (complimentary)

#Same Trailer, Different Park

**AzettImpa** (11): Best video game ever made period. I‚Äôd rate the whole soundtrack 11 if I could, it‚Äôs Indie heaven. Truly (and I mean this) a cultural reset.

**notdallin** (11): sometimes I would just sit and ground myself to this song, controller in hand, twinkling lights above me in my best friend‚Äôs bedroom, winter candy apple wafting through the air, my partner asleep on the couch. The fact that this song can evoke such a visceral sensation years after playing the game is a testament that this song is not only one of the best video game soundtrack songs, but one of the best songs of the last decade.

**2l82bstr8** (10): thank you all so much for voting this in, I wish I could give another 11. it's amazing what the plinky punky keyboard in the back is doing for the mood of the song

**apatel27** (10): Got me to install and play the game after 5 years

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): adding this to my sad gay music playlist

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Listening this cozy in my hoodie when fall weather is really starting to hit. We love it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what an iconic soundtrack, this blends right in with all the licensed tracks perfectly, and absolute must play for anyone who loves a good video game soundtrack

**Rigumaro** (10): This is so peaceful. It's not exactly relaxing, it's more like... This song is telling me "you're on the right track, you're fine". It's like a venting session with a good friend. Like a day off from work happily chilling at home.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): i honestly don't know anything about this game but this is absolutely gorgeous

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): I kissed both Warren and Chloe.

**1998tweety** (9): ended that fad kacey musgraves

**Exaltatus** (9): Life is Strange walked so the rest of indie acoustic music could run.

**PhloxInvar** (8.5): Feels like it needs the extra background noises of the menu screen, but that's not a bad thing. Still, this theme is very very good for the title track. It just exudes such a wonderful and consistent drive that's so peaceful.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): cozy

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): no problems here with sub pop circa 2k6 core.

**hikk** (8): i love this game even though it is admittedly flawed... so bisexual core i have no choice but to stan

**JayElecHanukkah** (8): hey you know what? Life IS strange.

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): Down to earth. Not overly crowded or busy. Has more soul than other songs trying to accomplish a similar vibe on this rate.

**nt96** (8): perfect introduction for sad girl autumn

**rslashpoopheads** (8): very cute

**skargardin** (8): this is nice

**welcome2thejam** (8): Perfect for doing some early morning reflections with your two favorite bestbians

**flibbityflob** (7.6): Peace. Simple as.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): hello fellow depressed bisexuals

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): can't believe this won over H.E.R. for AOTY

**CrimsonROSET** (7): kacey wishes and washes

**Slaycoco** (7): We love an acoustic moment

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7): could use more of something

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensive: vibes

#star-crossed

**ricki** (6.5): kacey musgrave had to diversify careers after her last album flopped

**2RINITY** (6): Isn't this that game where everyone inexplicably talks like a Homestar Runner character

**fortyfive33** (6): Am I the trans person who hasn't played LiS1?

**sarcasticsobs** (6): ‚Äúdoes anybody have the tab for this‚Äù - YouTube user Brun0 Disegno, 2 years ago

**StroHersh** (6): - slowed down reverbed tiktok special

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Background music‚Ä¶.. Okay every song in this rate is background music but you know what I mean!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): acoustic phobia goes hard

**akanewasright** (4.5): This is pretty, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs really good in context, but after my one friend yelled about how much they hated the ending (and why), I feel no need to explore further

**impla77** (4.3): boring

**pig-serpent** (4): Music for the type of girl who says "I love indie music" before handing you a Taylor Swift mixtape.

**runaway3212** (3): this is kinda nothing, how did this get voted in?

**shipperondeck** (3): ok there are maybe too many soft ambient songs in this rate it's getting a bit boring

**Zypker125** (2.5): Life is indeed strange if a monotonous and utterly forgettable song like this can get nominated? Someone please explain to me why this got voted in, I am so confused.

**BasedButta** (0): we should break this guy‚Äôs guitar

**frogaranaman** (0): the concept of this game even existing ruined my life to an immeasurable ammount

It's fine? I know it's well known but I'm still a little unsure how it even made it in. It has a few fun moments in it, but nothing that really jumps out to me. Not a bad track or anything but compared to all of the other titans in the rate (and ones that didn't make it in) I have a hard time scoring it any higher.

---

#PK üî•

**qazz23** (10): fitting tune for walking around in the starting town

**Stryxen** (10): homogenic

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm a ness stan in spite of how annoying he is to face

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): does the jazz hands while telling you why its the "smasha", a new vocab word I just learned this week from our indie pop 2k18 hosties who clearly don't realize the deranged ass lengths im gonna go to using that phrase now. anyways, lotta early nintendo games just had perfect ideas i suppose.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): this is so funny to me lkdlsldsdslk

**BebeLuigi** (9): yessss I love it, that ost feels like listening to a postcard in a way it just perfectly conveys Onett

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this sounds like a super mario song

**PhloxInvar** (8.5): I quite like the peaceful energy. Definitely feels like Animal Crossing as a first impression, but it's a nice vibe. Not amazing, but a good theme.

**2RINITY** (8): I'm more used to higher-fidelity rearrangements from Smash Bros. and shit, but the quality of the songwriting and the influence on modern indie RPG soundtracks is unmistakable

**akanewasright** (8): I haven‚Äôt played this game much at all, but this does capture a kind of small town comfort that I really love

**anothertown** (8): this game was full of music that was perfect for the "being a shitty little kid" / "having to save the world" dichotomy

**shipperondeck** (8): this has a tremendous amount of instrumental depth for a snes game. that guitar? yeah

**Slaycoco** (8): Nostalgique, but I do prefer the smash version (this goes for any MOTHER track though)

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8): quirky and cute

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I almost tanked this because it‚Äôs not the iconic Earthbound meme song but I was being dumb this goes hard

**welcome2thejam** (8): Ain't a JRPG early city theme if it doesn't make me wanna bounce in place

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): One day I‚Äôll play this game. One day I will fire up that emulator (Nintendo, if you‚Äôre reading this, totally jk-ing!!)

**notdallin** (7.8): defund the onett police

**flibbityflob** (7.6): I will keep coming back to the freedom offered to video game composers by the S-SMP chip, and the variety of instruments and the charming music that could be made with the tools offered by the SNES always astonishes me. Whilst I don‚Äôt think of this as a particular masterpiece, especially not within the Mother series (Strong One: Masked Man is a much better example of the sheer insanity and skill that this series could reach), it‚Äôs just such an incredible place-setter. You feel like you‚Äôre at home just listening to it.

**Zypker125** (7.4): Are we sure this isn‚Äôt an Animal Crossing song

**impla77** (7.1): cute little song

**1998tweety** (7): getting hit by the cars in the stage in Smash was a bit part of my childhood

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7): A good encapsulation of what I'd call ‚Äú90s weird‚Äù. Makes me think of some Saturday morning Nickelodeon cartoons.

**Rigumaro** (7): This feels like a very nostalgia-heavy song, and sadly I never played Earthbound. Still decent though.

**skargardin** (7): I would like to thank Nintenheads for finally making me giving this a chance

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the part where all the instruments drop out and the only part you can hear is the bass never fails to put a smile on my face

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs a cute little thing

#Undertale fans

**apatel27** (6): It's cute

**Exaltatus** (6): Very Stardew.

**steelstepladder** (6): smash version deserved

**BasedButta** (5): this will make me go insane

**JayElecHanukkah** (5): I dunno maybe if I played this as a kid but it just kinda sounds like if there were a runescape theme for a xylophone factory

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): All I‚Äôm gonna say is that the influenced outsold the influencer in this rate.

**frogaranaman** (4): Pitchfork 8.3 BNM circa 2004 sounded like this

**RandomHypnotica** (4): maybe it's just because i haven't played earthbound but this is really boring

**rslashpoopheads** (4): I'm sorry but the Super Smash Bros Onett medley absolutely ate this up

**runaway3212** (4): should've been that theme where you get inhaled into some person and then the person is the dungeon

**vayyiqra** (4): Earthbound frustrates me because when I was a kid it was this incredibly hyped-up game that was said to be amazing but there was no way for me to play it. Coupled with how annoying Ness is in Super Smash Bros., this led me to think "well never mind Earthbound sucks anyway!" I was like 10 okay, give me a pass here. Anyway I'm sure it's a good, albeit weird, game but I don't like this track; the percussion is weird and the whole thing meanders and doesn't go anywhere.

**apatel27** (11): Counterattacking style is usually more fun. There's just something so satisfying about it.

**Blazingscourge** (11): Works but boring.

**shipperondeck** (11): unless wake up DP is an offensive action (it is offensive as in it will offend you), i am unfortunately in this position

**BasedButta** (0): you are cool as well don't worry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Saving ass < getting ass.

**flibbityflob** (0): i used to play defensively and stealthy and then i realised chaos was better than anything else

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): honestly given how bad i am at offense in most games i should probably be playing defensively instead, but something in my brain keeps me coming back to the offense‚Ä¶

**vayyiqra** (0): I respect it but camping or turtling is kind of boring as a strategy and also often leads to merely delaying the inevitable. Better to be active.

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Honey I don't even drive defensively

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (0): not built for this. Built different

**Zypker125** (0): Defense may be smart and that means it's for LOSERS

I think there are tracks I enjoy much more from this series (and even game) than this one. As iconic as it is, I think I grew tired of hearing it a little everytime I booted the game up. However, it does a fantastic job fitting the energy of the Sims in all its 'cosmic entity fucking over the lives of its inhabitants' glory

---

#Zerpa powey imba heb

**DefaultPophead** (11): I'm a 1000+ hour simmer. This was inevitable.

**impla77** (11): probably the song I‚Äôve listened to most in my life üò≠ those loading screens were long so you‚Äôd better like this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My virtual self ass is up (and burning to death in a puddle of piss)!

**Exaltatus** (10): Sims has done more for the in-the-closet queers out there than ANYTHING else. Sul sul!

**flava** (10): the nostalgia of waiting 10 hours for the loading screen to actually load!

**notdallin** (10): I only know sims from the memes‚ÄîI did not expect my life to flash before my eyes in such an epic way listening to this song. You could have fooled me and said it was from a Beethoven movie or something

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i feel like this song is equal parts iconic and traumatising

**Roxieloxie** (10): a game i pie rated this year on my dear old mac

**2l82bstr8** (9): whippna choba dog

**2RINITY** (9): Damn, they didn't need to go this hard for a game about deleting the ladder so everyone in the pool dies

**Rigumaro** (9): This is a beautiful track. A bit corny, but I love it. It feels like a huge celebration. Although I have other favorites in this series.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): it‚Äôs a really good thing that this song is good, because you would hear a LOT of it because the load times for the Sims 3 were horrendous

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): [Alexa, play ‚ÄúBe Sweet (Simlish)‚Äù]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wynB7Pjeog)

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Always love hearing this song right before my game crashes

**Zypker125** (8): It‚Äôs a nice upbeat but chill song. Not much to say about it.

**flibbityflob** (7.2): imagine being hit in the face by the strongest wave of nostalgia of all time, that‚Äôs how I felt when this started playing.

**cremeebrulee** (7): i really made all my girl sims woohoo each other in middle school and still thought i was straight huh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is like stickerbrush but worse

**frogaranaman** (7): ahhhh yes the sound of ruining lives and playing god

**PhloxInvar** (7): I think it slaps but I'm confused by the sudden shifts in the middle.

**plastichaxan** (7): Raising the score cause I love the sims

**seanderlust** (7): songs to go swimming to! in your pool! that has a ladder that will definitely still be there in 10 minutes trust me! :)

**skargardin** (7): bop

**stupidslappa** (7): Reminded of my childhood dreams coming true.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the sims 2 outsold in literally every single way

#Vengeful Gods

**akanewasright** (6.5): I only played like an hour of the sims with the sound off before my parents took my copy away because they saw me make a hype house of my friend group at the time and that I accidentally made everyone pee themselves‚Ä¶ but this is fun!

**JayElecHanukkah** (6): why is this so epic for a game you're gonna make a character just live their life in a 3 bedroom townhouse listening to Katy Perry speaking damn gibberish

**pig-serpent** (6): Grabs toast "Sorry mom, late for work" leaves frame, then comes back in to kiss his mom on the cheek "Love You" opening credits play as he bikes down a hill "woah" dodges car "aaahhh" crashes into newspaper stand "sorry Bob!" runs into office "HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU TO STOP BEING LATE" song ends

**runaway3212** (6): sims 3 best one but this sucks idc

**Slaycoco** (6): Cute but I‚Äôve heard it so many times and it‚Äôs almost maddening instead of nostalgic. Sims music peaked at sims 1 anyway!

**StroHersh** (6): - why wouldnt u pick the sims 2 one...

**vayyiqra** (6): Hey I know this guy, he does movie scores. Anyway this is alright! quirky!

**shhhneak** (5.5): Wait, the OG Sims isn‚Äôt in this rate? What are we even doing here. Everybody go home.

**steelstepladder** (5.5): Jerma dollhouse theme outsold

**apatel27** (5): White People Music

**rslashpoopheads** (5): why are they so hype it's literally the sims

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): the choir went hard

**throwaway-7650** (5): yea I have no attachment to the sims at all I fear

**BebeLuigi** (4): This is a piece of music, for sure

**anothertown** (3): this isn't sims 1 buy mode theme

**shipperondeck** (2): barbie movie background songs outsell

**theonewithoutmynudes** (2): this didnt do anything for me but I also haven't played the sims since the first one

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): soulless corporate music

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (0): idk here gonna slap the irrational hate 0 here bc y'all would go apeshit for this but prolly say "my stummy hurts" if you listened to one minute punk smart bombs. yeah its different context i know! im being petty.

It's memorable, it's iconic, etc. etc. It's nice but I can't just care about this as a song all that much. Perhaps it's cause I never was a huge Final Fantasy fan in the first place, but this is not doing much for me.

---

#Flower Power

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): man this theme hits hard, almost as hard as a sword to the torso

**CrimsonROSET** (10): cloud strife i am free this thursday at 6pm for dinner

**qazz23** (10): so nostalgic

**Rigumaro** (10): I can't be unbiased for this. I don't know if it's nostalgia or it's actually that good. But god damn is it powerful. It transports me to that world instantly.

**skargardin** (10): Aerith my poor little meow meow

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way I plagiarized the first minute of this OST for an assignment back in high school orchestra class (and passed)

**vayyiqra** (10): I cri ever tim : ( No really this is a very pretty theme and fits the scene perfectly, even if it's hard today to feel sad about blocky polygonal characters dying. I am old enough to remember seeing the trailer for this game on TV though and at the time it was mindblowing that a game like this could be made.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): As we gather here today to celebrate the life of Aerith Gainsborough, I‚Äôd like us all to remember her not for her sorrowful end, but for her wonderful accomplishments. Like the time she bodied a guy with a steel chair.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): who watched the action button review of final fantasy 7 remastered but never played the game? raise your hand with me!

**2RINITY** (9): Tifa is best girl, but Aerith has the better theme song

**celladonn** (9): sadness, sorrow even

**RandomHypnotica** (9): a classic for sure... but i do wish something else represented final fantasy here (like the victory fanfare SLAY)

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): can you imagine this being performed by a full orchestra though I think I might cry

**apatel27** (8.5): It's pretty but never really cared for the FF series so no real attachment here

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): final fantasy as a series is such a god tier trove of music

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): YouTube comments try not to spoil the game challenge (VERY HARD)

**impla77** (8.4): Great bittersweet song

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): https://imgur.com/a/mu29V4v

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): What a queen she was. Slayed and was slain.

**flibbityflob** (8): I‚ÄôM FINE I‚ÄôM FINE I FEEL NOTHING AT ALL PLEASE DON‚ÄôT MAKE ME THINK ABOUT AERITH IT‚ÄôS FINE!! UEMTASU NOBUO HOW DARE YOU!!

**notdallin** (8): I cry

**seanderlust** (8): aerith's theme is just so relaxing and nice. this could fit very well into the soundtrack of a game like stardew valley

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**BebeLuigi** (7): It is a great ost, sadly I don't have the emotional attachement that a lot of people have to FF7 so it doesn't move me that much but I find it very cute nonetheless

**bigbigbee** (7): A downside of the way that this rate was voted in is that often times, the most "iconic" track from a video game is a slow, beautiful, meaningful song like this one. But unfortunately, I think that if one hasn't played the game that it's from, they kind of blend together. I bet I would love this if I played FF7.

**Exaltatus** (7): A classic yes, though I do personally prefer the older Final Fantasies. I feel like the PS1 era music is in a weird middle ground between the simple and catchy 8 and 16-bit era music and the full orchestra that would come in later titles.

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): this is indeed a theme from the game final fantasy VII for the character Aerith, there's no denying that

#Backstabber

**2specific4google** (6.9): - You ever seen that "Aerith dies to Seinfeld music" edit?

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): this feels like it would be much better if it were transformed into a vaporwave song

**hikk** (6): all i know about ff7 is that cloud has big sword so it's not rly hitting sorry. it's pretty i guess

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (6): Overrated. Give it up. She's dead.

**pig-serpent** (6): This is very close to doing something for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i listened to this song 10 times and im still not sure what my opinion on it is

**Zypker125** (6): If I had played FF7 I‚Äôm sure I would have had more sentiment attached to it, but alas I have no emotional connection to the series.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5.7): it was alright I think I was waiting for a big flourish or something

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): on it's own it's kinda boring, but i can see how this could hit harder in-game

**frogaranaman** (5): I listened to this whole thing NOT because I'm a weeb but because my Fred again preorder was not working

**welcome2thejam** (5): Assuming this probably hits like a truck if you played FF7

**PhloxInvar** (4): I never played this game. I assume this is probably a very emotional and deep theme of one of the main characters... without that connection it's just a little boring. Probably better with the right context.

**plastichaxan** (4): I‚Äôll use this as an opportunity to say listening to instrumental music is hard to me especially if it doesn‚Äôt catch my opinion

**ricki** (4): i dont like that kazoo synth

**shipperondeck** (4): sorry i have no emotional connection to ff and i just think this is boring. however, my mom overheard me listening to this and said it was pretty music. i'm not making her listen kahoot lobby music 80s edition to make her own ballot though.

**Slaycoco** (4): Emotionally manipulative

**runaway3212** (2): if Ed Sheeran did Video Game soundtracks

Once again TK uses his magical influence to get a song in the rate and then doesn't even 11 it!1!11 Anyways this time it's all alright since it's a fantastic track from one of the best written games to ever come out of Nintendo. The art style is both stellar and fits well with the game mechanics. I mean having the battles [take place on a stage where you have to manage the audience members](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uBueZVGdFRI/maxresdefault.jpg) is brilliant.

#Rock antis

**qazz23** (10): really good town theme, love the üéª that comes in after a minute

**throwaway-7650** (10): :tkyola: :somepoints:

**TragicKingdom1** (10): no instrumental has better captured the spirit of adventure. vivian is a queer icon btw

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): desmond get in the animus u gotta relive the memories of your great-14th cousin once removed, paper mario! use your ezio skills to outmanuever anyone you meet! [press Y to counter and steal a weapon. then keep pressing Y to taunt an enemy into not wanting to fight you!]

**BasedButta** (9): ok now this is really great: has a theme it sticks to, has enough instrumental depth and variance, and it‚Äôs not ultra repetitive like some songs here. mario made of paper slays i guess

**Exaltatus** (9): Can we stop and talk about how Rogueport is one of the best hub areas in all of Mario and it ain't close? Like, the sheer level of detail and amount of hidden things, the overall atmosphere, I love it so much.

**Rigumaro** (9): This song is so dynamic, and it really gives a feeling of adventure. I love when songs feel like they're bringing you on a ride.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Omg the best Paper Mario song from the best Paper Mario game

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): god i miss good paper mario

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): so upbeat and fun!

**Zypker125** (8.4): This one feels like it‚Äôs telling a story and avoids staying monotone, giving it a cinematic feel.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): tkyola

**runaway3212** (8): we love a fun bop

**sarcasticsobs** (8): The ascending and descending part, that‚Äôs the ticket!

**2specific4google** (7.8): - This instrumentation is incredible but the melody isn't resonating with me.

**2RINITY** (7.5): Never realized how desert-y this track was for a seaside town full of pirates, but it really captures the feeling of stepping into a strange new part of Mario's world

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): gonna piss off a lot of fans of this game and say that the origami king soundtrack washes this game's soundtrack

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7.5): This one is kinda all over the place. Rhythm is kindof a yawn though.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): i was gonna ask if yall rated "in the final" (final boss theme) from mario and luigi: bowser's inside story, but then i remembered that is in fact Not the same series as paper mario

**flibbityflob** (7.2): This just‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt click. I‚Äôll extoll the virtue of any game written on the SNES sound chip, but this just‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt it for me.

**apatel27** (7): Nothing that really sticks outside the twang

**bigbigbee** (7): I actually like this, and maybe this is gamer brain speaking, but in a town called Rogueport, I feel like they missed an opportunity to include farty Pirate synths? What I‚Äôm saying is that Sea Shanty 2 should be here

**rslashpoopheads** (7): TTYD a goated game with a goated soundtrack but this wouldn't have been my pick

**vayyiqra** (7): Still not sure to this day what Paper Mario is or why it exists but sure this is cool.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): I looked this game up to see if they translated ‚Äúsennen‚Äù as ‚Äúthousand-year‚Äù when the word millennium exists (Yu-gi-oh‚Äôs Millennium artifacts and Millennium Actress are examples, imagine if it was called Thousand-Year Actress üíÄ) so imagine my surprise at the game‚Äôs Japanese title being Paper Mario RPG. they really didn‚Äôt put in the effort for that title huh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Origami King robbed tbh.

**frogaranaman** (6): the hotter Mario

**skargardin** (6): it's .. a song

**Slaycoco** (6): Gorls of all the TTYD tracks why this one‚Ä¶ good but‚Ä¶

**steelstepladder** (6): thousand year whore

**welcome2thejam** (6): Got a nice, tense atmosphere

**notdallin** (5.8): lest you think I would give any Nintendo song an 8+

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5.7): it was ok but maybe also a lil too busy

**impla77** (5.2): just fine

**PhloxInvar** (5): It's desert vibes, but it's a bit meandering and loud for my tastes.

**JayElecHanukkah** (3): yeah I dunno this one's kinda paper thin

**BebeLuigi** (1): Yeah, this is the mario track that is too much here dfqdsfsdf

##**Controversy: 4.796**


Chao Garden you will always be famous but there's no way I can put Sonic over Mario for me. Don't think Mario's really had a mainline miss ever which is more than the blue hedgehog can say. Plus the 2d ones go to fast for me and I have no idea what I'm doing

**anothertown** (11): Mario, Todd, Peach, Pink Gold Peach, Wario, Gay Bower, those guys are my bestfriends.

**AzettImpa** (11): everyone knows this guy

**BasedButta** (11): Mario wins because his 3d games don't suck

**Exaltatus** (11): It ain't even close, who in their right mind is putting Sonic over Mario?

**flibbityflob** (11): whilst sonic's music fucks harder mario just has more overall consistancy

**frogaranaman** (11): he could save me

**JayElecHanukkah** (11): yeah and it's not close

**PhloxInvar** (11): I like plumbling. Also we got Bowser from Mario which like??? Way to design a hottie.

**qazz23** (11): always good and reliable

**RandomHypnotica** (11): even if i haven‚Äôt personally likef *some* mario games, there is still such a consistently high quality here

**runaway3212** (11): imagine being good in 3d

**shhhneak** (11): A solid eleven until Crisp Rat ruins his legacy.

**shipperondeck** (11): i've seen less mpreg of him than i have of sonic

**slimboyfriend** (11): definitely a republican though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): super mario galaxy is literally my favorite game of all time this is a no brainer

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Why can't we settle this like adults‚Ä¶ with a match of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games??

**welcome2thejam** (11): Lets-a go!

**whatsalanka** (11): You dropped this king

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (11): she's an icon, she's a legend, and she IS the moment... come on now!

**Zypker125** (11): Literally outsold all your faves

**1998tweety** (0): it says a lot about society that Sonic, a blue hedgehog, is more attractive than Mario, an Italian

**apatel27** (0): They had a thing going. It was good. They started innovating on it. It was great. Then they just did the same thing again ad nauseam. At least try to make the games memorable. Yeah sure they have more games that are on the "best ever games" lists but when was the last time someone talked about Super Mario Odyssey?

**Blazingscourge** (0): Averaging out lately.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Outsold by his own brother.

**rona NG+** (0): my favorite YouTube moment ever is alpharad/jo/altrive reacting to the Mario movie cast

**thedoctordances1940** (0): As a character Mario is just kinda boring, but the franchise is way better

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): just to use my 0

**vayyiqra** (0): There are some fun Mario games but they're the kind of games to play casually and that's about it. Some are also very frustrating and take forever to beat, and that's just from bad design. Also, an offensive ethnic stereotype (okay I'm not serious about that part.)

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (0): should NEVA be forgiven for starring in hotel mario on the phillips cd-i

**1998tweety** (11): im not gonna say anything here that will get me in trouble, but the other sonic girlies out there: i see you and hear you, we are one and the same üòå sonicxshadow > sonicxamy

**apatel27** (11): While they have more dips in quality (2006), most Sonic games are better than the Mario counterparts in every way. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is better than every Mario Kart don't @ me. Sonic Mania is better than every mainline Mario game since Super Mario 3.

**Blazingscourge** (11): The GOAT of everything except consistent gameplay.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Who inspired more cursed fan art?? Enough said.

**LesApfels** (11): I like the Mario series more but Sonic is such a cooler character

**rona NG+** (11): THEY MADE A VOW THEIR MOTHER WILL BE FOUND

**thedoctordances1940** (11): i have played like half an hour of sonic in my life but just from pop culture alone sonic is an easy win

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): I love Jehtt

**vayyiqra** (11): Sonic has fallen off a lot as a series and his "mascot with attitude" persona is hilariously dated to the 90s, but the first three Sonic games are masterpieces and I grew up playing them before any other game I can remember so I have to give them cred.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (11): class conscious anarchist hero. WHO ELSE in the nineties went outside nintendo headquarters with a megaphone ready to start the revolution?!? even today, soniclandia still gets all the olympic medals. Powerful!

**anothertown** (0): Very helpful explanations throughout this franchise about the topic of Inflation but yall just dont cut it

**AzettImpa** (0): hasn‚Äôt had a good game in years :((

**BasedButta** (0): but he's an 11 in being funny

**flibbityflob** (0): rip to live and learn as covered by hatsune miku where everyh word is miku

**frogaranaman** (0): "gotta go fast" how about you gotta go fuck yourself Sonic

**hikk** (0): i do like sonic more than a lot of people but like ... let's be real he has so many shit games it's kind of unbelievable that he is still even remotely relevant in the modern day

**JayElecHanukkah** (0): lol come on I mean is anyone seriously gonna pick this blue mf

**MrMushrooms** (0): This is also the number of good Sonic games made in the last 10 years

**PhloxInvar** (0): Robotnik is cool, but Sonic has a really bad track record so he's getting chopped.

**qazz23** (0): you gotta go fast... but you fell off after SA2 :(

**RandomHypnotica** (0): ‚Ä¶ what happened to you

**runaway3212** (0): his relevance is soley based on the charity mario does with him at the olympics

**sarcasticsobs** (0): Shadow the Hedgehog outsold

**shhhneak** (0): There‚Äôs no rivalry here. It‚Äôs wild how Sonic fumbles the bag every time.

**shipperondeck** (0): i've seen more mpreg of him than i have of mario

**slimboyfriend** (0): oh how the mighty have fallen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): sonic has had more bad games than good games at this point honestly

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): I'm gonna sound like a dweeb for saying this but Sonic games are TOO DAMN FAST! I've tried my handful of Sonic games but every time the action is just happening too fast to keep up‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (0): Haha, ha, zero!

**whatsalanka** (0): I'm pretending Sonic Rush doesn't exist so this doesn't hurt

**Xx\_Stryxen\_Gamer\_2002\_xX** (0): hate his stupid voice and his stupid hair and his stupid boots and gloves.

The other track that falls into 'is this really fitting of being in a gaming rate' category. Though its sibling Mii Channel won out in its own rate, Wii Shop falls quite short. Though I still think having any gaming-related tracks eligible was fair at first, I do wonder if this would've been instead better saved for the eventual meme rate 2, where I'm sure it would've done much better. Anyways, too late to dwell on that topic. Wii Shop Channel stuck out to many Wii owners minds due its unexpectedly catchy tunes for a shopping platform.

#Savvy Shoppers

**frogaranaman** (11): c'mon team let's do it this time

**1998tweety** (10): now THIS is a classic

**anothertown** (10): üé∂ Bubble Bobble, Double Dribble, Double Dragon, F-Zero üé∂

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The way the Wii has so much power in this rate. Ended the Fad Cube.

**cremeebrulee** (10): we love a previous rate winner, not everybody has that to their credit

**CrimsonROSET** (10): capitalism won

**hikk** (10): tbt to being so perched to buy ocarina of time after playing that weird ass 5 minute demo thing that was in brawl

**PhloxInvar** (10): While I think Stickerbrush Symphony has the best chances of winning, this one might honestly just win by sheer meme power.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): to the nerds who say "bUt ThIs IsN't A gAme", here's a counterpoint. shut the fuck up.

**Rigumaro** (10): It's just so stylish, so unique. Impossible not to groove.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i hate that i just got reminded that theres a video of me fortnite dancing to the wii shop channel on the day it shut down

**skargardin** (10): I will hear NONE of the overrated comments

**stupidslappa** (10): If Nintendo were a music company they‚Äôd excel on making elevator music, and a good one that is.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ‚Äúthis isnt even from a video game, this shouldn‚Äôt have been included in the rate!‚Äù i say, giving it a 10 anyway

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): "you could stop at five or six stores. or just one." ;) I wanna read the thousands of comments on uploads of this cut. Absolutely iconic piece of digital storefront ambience that is so tethered to a gaggle of personal and shared cultural memories. It truly soundtracked an era of being able to buy games online. The xbox live marketplace never did that! Anyways, here's the Sherry Poppins drag queen lipsyncing wii shop theme video that's goated. Sherry did this for 7 minutes, looked flawless, and straight up taught me how to live, laugh, love, etc again. goddamn perfect tysm bae https://twitter.com/eric_shorey/status/1167832077531799553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1167832077531799553%7Ctwgr%5E9707bd756acc9907d2cc2d3035a74b6e77cf6fcd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fdrag-queen-lip-sync-wii-store-music-sherry-poppins

**2RINITY** (9.5): Bumping it up a half-point because I sent my scores in on Wii Shop Wednesday

**flibbityflob** (9): so fun fact about me I never actually went on the wii shop because we never connected our wii to the internet so the first time I heard this was as an adult and it still made me feel like I‚Äôd heard it a million times before. Truly the blinding lights of video game music.

**qazz23** (9): wii love menu music, yes wii do

**runaway3212** (9): is this a game? is this just fantasy?

**shipperondeck** (9): eh sorry this is a bop

**Slaycoco** (9): WATCH drag performer Sherry Poppin‚Äôs lipsync to this song for queer skin!!

**slimboyfriend** (9): they don‚Äôt make them like this anymore :(

**DaHumanTorch** (8): when i become president this will be played in every department store on loop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): KKB instrumental

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): This piece knows exactly what it needs to be, and succeeds.

**welcome2thejam** (8): If you're not undulating your body in strange new ways to this song, then what are you doing?

**turtle\_on\_mars** (7.8): ICONIC

**notdallin** (7.5): where my ludbuds at‚Ä¶ I hate that all I can hear when I listen this song is ‚ÄúBBBBBBBBOOOOys the plan is SIMPLE‚Äù

**steelstepladder** (7.5): the wiikear of the two Wii tracks

#Frugal Fiends

**impla77** (6.9): didn‚Äôt know wii shop was a game

**Zypker125** (6.3): I‚Äôm sorry to betray the Nin10do gang, but it‚Äôs just way too monotonous for me and it lacks the impact that the M11 Channel theme had.

**2specific4google** (6): - Cause I know when that hotline bling!

**pig-serpent** (6): It's great as a meme or mashup instrumental but the original song is kind of bland, all things considered.

**throwaway-7650** (6): boo tomato I wanted the wii menu music over this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Some of these songs are good in theory but I‚Äôve listened to them over and over so many times I just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt

**indie\_fan\_** (5.5): I mean this is just sterotypical Elevator Music. I don't mind it, at least.

**BebeLuigi** (5): do we count this as video game dfqsdfqsdfs

**LesApfels** (5): I love the beautiful toxicity of commercialization in capitalist America

**sarcasticsobs** (5): ‚ÄúThis song has big ‚ÄúNo thoughts, Brain empty‚Äù vibes‚Äù - YouTube user Saint Somnia, 1 year ago (edited)

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5): I mean its just elevator music right

**seanderlust** (4.5): why does this kind of remind me of the instrumental to ""feels like summer"" by childish gambino

**Exaltatus** (4): Makes me feel like a Dickensian orphan boy staring into a shop window. Family was fairly poor at the time so I could only really look at things, never buy them in the shop channel.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): the mashup with Hotline Bling goes hard also wow this is much more irritating than I remember

**vayyiqra** (4): Enough memeing Wii music. Once was enough. I'm bored of it now.

**apatel27** (1): The only good thing to come out of this was the Hotline Bling remix

**rslashpoopheads** (1): when do we stop nominating meme songs and start nominating good ones

**akanewasright** (0): This did not deserve

**nt96** (0): girl this is a not a gaming track. Its good but I wanna tank it for extra damage ‚ù§

**Stryxen** (0): it‚Äôs just not interesting, not like it's supposed to be since its just idle music so it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do but, i couldn‚Äôt care less about it and i would hate if this won

Going into the rate, I think a lot of people thought Minecraft would've done really well. But I think the soundtrack is one that you really need to be playing to appreciate the ambiance of it all. Otherwise I can see how it falls a bit flat. Also I never really thought of it until it was brought up in the comments, but it is pretty fun to compare the Minecraft fanbase to the calmness of this soundtrack. However, C418 did an amazing job creating the soundtrack and I have no doubt the game wouldn't have been as great without it. Something about watching the sun rise from your little hidey hole built into a mountain. Or jumping up cliffs to discover new cave entrances. Or just watching the rain come down from your well constructed house. Though the creativity made the game famous and extended its life to even today, I think the soundtrack helped make some of those early memories. 

I primarily played when there was only volume alpha so most of my faves come from there. A lot of them have the same calming aura as Sweden does, but I like the magicality that [Mice on Venus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ47H84Bc_Q) brings. [Haggstrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZNy6eHw3FA) is another stellar track that reminds me of sunrise/sunset. And [Subwoofer Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpd85y_iTxY) is a perfect rainy day anthem. If you need any help sleeping, this album is perfect to throw on (complimentary)

#Block Builders

**thedoctordances1940** (11): one of the few games here i've actually played and this evokes so much nostalgia for me. But this 11 isn't just because of nostalgia, it's an incredibly beautiful song in its own right and I just love this soundtrack so much it's absolutely gorgeous.

**AzettImpa** (10): the soundtrack of a whole generation‚Äôs childhood.

**Exaltatus** (10): I absolutely love all the Minecraft music. So hypnotic and memorable and calming.

**frogaranaman** (10): sobbing in the club to the thought of C418's iconic Minecraft soundtrack Alpha

**hikk** (10): minecraft soundtrack literally the best music ever created this makes me SOB

**JayElecHanukkah** (10): when you're just exploring all by yourself in the wilderness and the piano comes in? Now that is a serene vibe

**PhloxInvar** (10): I'm totally being hypocritical because I am 100% sure nostalgia is coloring my view of this song, but Sweden just has such a brilliant tranquility to it. It might be one of the most nostalgic song here by virtue of how widespread Minecraft is, it's a literal decade-long childhood game that is STILL popular to this day. Still, it just works. C418 is brilliant, and most of the Minecraft tracks are honestly quite great. It's an incredible work of a trio of albums, and Sweden is like right up there in its best tracks.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the minecraft soundtrack is absolute perfection, and this track is such a perfect example of why. It feels equal parts natural and curious, fitting for a game all about exploring a world and building, it's ambient enough to not be overhwhelming or distracting, but it 100% adds to the experience of the game.

**runaway3212** (10): I love depression

**Stryxen** (10): just watched midsommar halfway through doing this rate‚Ä¶ freaky!!

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): seminal ambient banger i guess? there's nothing out of place here, but what cracks me up is that this is legit half the fucking Windham Hill catalog. None of you have EVER dug through the $1 tape or vinyl pile and been like "sure I'll listen to a windham hill piano sampler or that Spring album". guys...its literally just that but even *slower* and taking notes from Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's masterclass in Windham Hill-core piano ambience. if we as a society are gonna cherish and coronate this, I need an audience of people who've heard a portion of the windham hill catalog, please give their winter solstice album a shot.

**flibbityflob** (9.9): Talking about Sweden is like‚Ä¶what if you had this game you‚Äôd been playing for over a decade, a game that defined the decade it was released in and fundamentally shifted how the games industry worked, one that made a transphobe from Sweden endlessly wealthy and deeply pathetic, and one that made your life meaningful. I doubt I‚Äôd be here without Minecraft. It‚Äôs been a decade since I first started playing, and Sweden is still just as emotionally devastating now as it was then. C418 is a sincere master of his craft (and his mines!) and I‚Äôll never get tired listening to this. This is the sound of every mansion, every farm, every building, and every home that I‚Äôve made in this game that has defined my adult life.

**1998tweety** (9.5): i wanna go there

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Love getting my ass eaten by zombies to this beautiful track.

**Rigumaro** (9): Another one that brings me to that world and sends my troubles away. It feels like a meditation song. Sorry if I'm leaning too much on feelings versus actual music, but I don't really have knowledge on music theory.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Biggest surprise of this rate is a minecraft song ending up in my top 5

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): Another monstrously silly game song getting to me??

**shhhneak** (8.8): That annoying kids game with the worst Youtube thumbnails of all time has music like THIS?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): Wi n√∏t trei a h√∏liday in Sweden this y√´r? See the l√∏veli lakes, the w√∏nd√´rful teleph√∏ne system, and m√§ni interesting furry animals

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): love that we're finally doing the ambient rate on popheads

**BebeLuigi** (8): I never played Minecraft so I was pleasently surprised, it's like one of those animal crossing ost at night

**CrimsonROSET** (8): we love minecraft

**nt96** (8): It's nice

**seanderlust** (8): this didn't click with me until i listened to it while watching my cat take a nap in the sun

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): why does this turn into clash of clans music halfway

**bigbigbee** (7): WHEN YOU GO TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN AND THERE‚ÄôS A SNOWY SUNSET...TEARS WERE SHED AND PEOPLE SHIT THEMSELVES AND DIED

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7): The piano is just slightly detuned and I'm for it.

**pig-serpent** (7): I like to think that some kids who loved this soundtrack used it as a springboard to Aphex Twin and other idm artists.

**qazz23** (7): this is pretty relaxing

**Slaycoco** (7): Pretty, gives me the sims 1 build mode teas.

**steelstepladder** (7): shmorgi borg

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): the part where it gets cosy and quiet goes unnecessarily hard

#Stepped on too much Lego

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): since I imagine the Minecraft fanbase to all be 12 year old boys, I didn‚Äôt expect them to be vibing to somber piano music. This whole time I imagined Minecraft music to sound like if Aphex Twin ate a lot of pixie sticks

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I-a make-a da meatball

**notdallin** (6): I am not a zoomer

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It‚Äôs a piano

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5.9): pretty but a lil dull

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i dont really care for ambient music but this one is nice i guess

**skargardin** (5): This is nice I guess but I don't really see what the fuss is about. Also fuck Sweden

**welcome2thejam** (5): Whatta bunch of blockheads

**2specific4google** (4.6): - At times, melodically it sounds like a worse version of Persona 3's "Memories of the School"

**vayyiqra** (4): I don't understand the hype this game has on the internet. I'm sure I'd like it if I tried it, but you can't convince me this doesn't do well solely from nostalgia. A somber piano ballad on Popheads? lmao

**Zypker125** (3.8): Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

**impla77** (3.4): this inspires no emotion in me

**2RINITY** (3): These sorts of intimate piano pieces need a very strong melody to connect with me before I actually play the game they're from, and since I've never played Minecraft...I'm sorry, I hear this and I feel nothing

**apatel27** (3): Didn't play minecraft obsessively when I was younger so I guess idgi

**BasedButta** (2): im just getting real annoyed by all of these slow piano songs

**shipperondeck** (1): boring as fuck (i dont play minecraft)

I haven't played much Grand Theft Auto (and I guess this is also making its way around as a tiktok related thing? Paging resident expert frog for confirmation) Anyways as a song it's not doing too much for me. It does a great job as an opening sequence, but otherwise not something I'd throw on otherwise (not that I can since it's not on Canadian streaming for whatever reason)

#Seventeen number 10s, 12 number 9's, 14 number 8's, 15 number 7's and a large soda

**2l82bstr8** (10): changed the course of world history forever

**apatel27** (10): It fucks

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this gets you in the mood of it right away like time to run some people over

**plastichaxan** (10): A CLASSIC

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what an absolutely flawlessly perfect theme, this sounds exactly like the instrumental to some unreleased west coast hip hop song, and it PERFECTLY sets the mood for the game

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is really good music to stalk someones twitter likes too

**seanderlust** (10): this is honestly just cool as hell...they nailed the early 2000s hip hop vibe with this one

**skargardin** (10): talented, incredible...

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): should've won meme rate already but Nintendhoes didn't even vote it in (and gave the win to Mii Channel!!!).

**vayyiqra** (10): This gets stuck in my head all the time despite not having played this game for a good 15 years so yeah it earned its 10. Perfect theme for this game, 90s vibes. You had to be there.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Awwwww yeahhhhhh

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): "hey man make the most on brand g-funk instrumental you can; make sure that shit can be played infinitively without ever getting boring". yeah they did it. still never played san andreas; only did 5 really (a game i never wanna return to). that being said, the the san andreas stations are terrific, specifically SFUR which def had long term effects for my music paths.

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): i feel this is mad verse city lobby music‚Äôs older, cooler cousin

**1998tweety** (9): groovy girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Not sure what that yassified cowbell noise is in the background but I like it a lot.

**fortyfive33** (9): ah shit, here we go again

**indie\_fan\_** (9): Damn it, I know a flour ranger made this ghetto ass beat, but I still can't help but love it

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (9): It's rare that a video game theme gets the vibe so spot on.

**nt96** (9): going from emotional to fuck shit up mode was certainly a whiplash

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Dr. Dre??!?

**2RINITY** (8.7): If I had a bunch of extra votes, I would give this two 9s, a 9 large, a 6 with extra dip, a 7, two 45s, one with cheese, and whatever number a large soda is worth

**PhloxInvar** (8.5): Perfect for the game. Just such a baller track, with a city vibe.

**notdallin** (8.3): gettin‚Äô crunk off in the club we gets looowww

**akanewasright** (8): I never played GTA but this def sounds like a song that makes a 12 year old feel like a badass that runs people over (in a fun way)

**anothertown** (8): i never played gta and i thought this song was actual 90s g-funk for years. screams

**qazz23** (8): that bouncy bass

**Slaycoco** (8): A pussy pop!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): crazy how authentic this sounds to being a real 90‚Äôs hip hop, they absolutely nailed the vibe in this one

**shipperondeck** (7.8): WJAT THE HELL THIS IS WHERE THAT SONG COMES FROM?????????

**flibbityflob** (7.5): Genuinely fucking iconic. Whilst GTA V was my GTA game, this is a sound that nobody‚Äôs ever going to forget.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): normalize using flexatones in music again

**rslashpoopheads** (7): slink n' slide

**runaway3212** (7): she's iconic but she's also a 7

**sarcasticsobs** (7): ‚ÄúI'll be pimping this in my low rider not a real low rider cjs low rider lol lol‚Äù - YouTube user El Payaso, 9 years ago

**Stryxen** (7): i‚Äôm SURE magdalena bay sampled this on secrets (your fire)

#Couldn't catch the damn train

**DaHumanTorch** (6): it's giving american life instrumental

**frogaranaman** (6): giving this a six in anticipation of what that one British teenager leaked

**welcome2thejam** (6): All you had to do was 11 the damn song, raters!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): this is essentially just an intro track so it gets scored accordingly

**hikk** (5): i only know this song from the tiktok trend of people walking like they're in gta and that sends honestly... but like otherwise it's not that good

**pig-serpent** (5): I can picture Ed Edd and Eddy walking around CN City to this music.

**Rigumaro** (5): I feel like it's a song with a lot of cultural impact but I don't really like it.

**impla77** (3.5): a bit too tinny for me

**2specific4google** (3): - Nothin' special.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (2.6): the constant jingling took me out of the vibe im so sorry

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): headache

**Zypker125** (1.5): The cops in GTA would arrest me for playing this music, that‚Äôs how offensively terrible it is

**shhhneak** (1): This reminds me, I need to get my engine checked.

**fadedblue09** (0): I love GTA and I know this is iconic, but does anyone actually willingly listen to this while playing??? This is literally loading screen music (aka the worst kind of video game music)

**ricki** (0): girl

A subdued guitar driven track not landing in the bottom 10? On Popheads? It's more likely than you think! Though this track was flopping for a good portion of the rate, eventually it pulled through and managed to sneak out of the bottom. Not even gamer wrath could keep it down. The track itself perfectly fits the atmosphere and environment of the world in the game. The plucking guitar is the focus and though it's rarely flashy, it does a fantastic job drawing in your attention.

#Fungi

**flibbityflob** (11): The Last of Us is one of my favourite video games ever. Talking about why involves me coming out as a lesbian to myself, a lifetime spent feeling alien in my own body, consuming letsplays of this game far too young, and one of my favourite soundtracks of all time. I learned to play this on the guitar. I don‚Äôt regret it. Everything about this piece makes me think of how painfully lonely the Last of Us is, as a game, how this solo guitar reminds you just how lonely Joel and Ellie‚Äôs journey is. And the theme is recontextualised so often through the game, especially devastating in part 2, and I just‚Ä¶I love it. I‚Äôll always love it. If you‚Äôve never heard this score played live, I highly recommend checking it out, it is absolutely gutting.

**fortyfive33** (11): this game had such a deep impact on my life I took one of its character's names as my own.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): haven't played either game but i'm gonna say part II is better just to piss off fans of the original game, they deserve it

**Exaltatus** (10): Gustavo has me by the THROAT.

**nt96** (10): being sick and tired of all the COD clones and the tired old wannabe Hollywood garbage where being "cinematic" was defined by how many explosions can you shoehorn in a scene, this game was a breath of fresh air back in high school. It's renewed my interest in storytelling and was one of the only games (Metroid Prime was another game)that inspired me write to this day.

**runaway3212** (10): one day I'll play this game

**welcome2thejam** (10): Much like Ellie I will protect this song with my life

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): cold stunner.

**notdallin** (9.8): where post-apocalypse biohazard meets the brutal and Wild West. The soundtrack is truly haunting

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): It‚Äôs kind of just vibes that exist, but I like those vibes

**shhhneak** (9.5): There‚Äôs plenty of acoustic twee dittys in this rate but she is the supreme.

**1998tweety** (9): ate

**BebeLuigi** (9): It's truly beautiful

**sarcasticsobs** (9): ‚ÄúWhen the world ends, this will be the song that plays in the credits.‚Äù - YouTube user Hesus, 1 year ago

**skargardin** (9): ate

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): As someone who knows nothing about this game, this theme is pretty good!

**2RINITY** (8.5): It says something about this game's cultural impact that I've never touched it and yet I immediately pictured Joel playing the guitars

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): i wonder how many people learnt guitar just for this

**impla77** (8.3): very atmospheric with nice little flourish at end

**BasedButta** (8): mainly acoustic guitar song is good? how could it be?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): discourse

**pig-serpent** (8): Cool ominous acoustic song? Yeah, ok.

**Slaycoco** (8): This better be used for the opening credits on the HBO series, that‚Äôs all I know!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): never before has an acoustic guitar sounded so sinister before

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): I like this as much as sweden so yeah 7.5

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): this is fine. The game is good. The game is better than the soundtrack if we're being real, the tunes are just okay. Part II is even better, but again the music isn't a defining trait.

**Rigumaro** (7): Another song that feels like I'd give it a better score if I was emotionally attached to it. May be a hot take but it feels slightly generic to me? Still good though. But yeah.

**Stryxen** (7): reminds me of the dishonored theme a bit (which I wanted to submit but wow it would have flopped) but not quite as good

#Gamers

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I‚Äôm not crazy about this song but I really respect the frothing incel rage this series has inspired.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.3): I don't hate or love it

**frogaranaman** (6): Joel could raw me

**stupidslappa** (6): iconic game, not too iconic theme.

**apatel27** (5): It's a good atmospheric track but nothing major

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): if there is one rate where acoustic-phobia is most justified, it‚Äôs this one. I think. gimme the BOPS

**vayyiqra** (5): Idk I haven't played this game; I watched two of my friends play it and wasn't interested in it, and also I'm not into this song. I feel nothing.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): wal-mart ennio morricone

**shipperondeck** (3): i'd hear this at my local hobbit-inspired cafe (it has great food and atmosphere but mid music)

**Zypker125** (3): I feel like this song fails on multiple counts for what is such a cinematic video game. It doesn‚Äôt do a particularly good job at setting the tone of the game (being too chill for the post-apocalyptic world of TLOU) and it‚Äôs musically rather monotonous.

Though I have infinite love for the Mario Kart franchise, my favourite soundtrack of all time has got to be this one. I don't want to go into spoilers since this game is best gone in blind, but this game would not leave my brain even 5 or 6 months after I finished it. Massive shoutout to steelstepladder, bigbigbee, and RandomHypnotica for inspiring me to get the game in the first place!! I suggested this in the voting thread and was so happy that it made it in.

Andrew Prahalow put in **work** on this soundtrack. For fans of the game, I would actually place 14.3 Billion Years or Travelers above this, but I think those very much need the context of the game to really enjoy. [Timber Hearth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtMdp70h0) and [Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C59AUL804WQ) are two other fantastic tracks that probably could've been here instead that don't need as much context, but elements of the Outer Wilds title track show up in many of the other songs that play over the course of the game so it was a great one to represent my love for the game. Some of my other favourites are probably a bit too restrained/ambient for rate purposes, but if you want something calming it's hard to beat [The Ancient Glade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwIWC9fCCFc) and [The Museum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJqpy4iAm5Y). For those that have played the DLC, I'd also rank the Echoes of the Eye title theme super highly as well.

#Travelers

**2l82bstr8** (10): we'll do it all anything on our own

**apatel27** (10): Fills you with hopes and dreams

**bigbigbee** (10): Spoilers - people who enjoyed the plot of this game, look up >!The Last Question by Isaac Asimov!<

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh I might need to play this game.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): tiltyola but when you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre right

**RandomHypnotica** (10): good god i never thought a banjo could make me cry

**Rigumaro** (10): Haven't played the game or heard this before, but wow I really loved it. It's an interesting mood.

**Roxieloxie** (10): giving this a ten to thank tilt for accepting my late ballot

**skargardin** (10): is this my gateway into playing outer wilds??

**steelstepladder** (10): SO close to my 11

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the first time I listened to Sophie I was weirded out by It's Okay to Cry and the rest didn't register properly, so I thought "maybe it's not for me". the second time I listened to Sophie was when Andrew Prahlow shared a playlist of songs that inspired the DLC of this game and Ponyboy was there. that's when OOEPU first clicked for me and I fell in love with Sophie. so thanks Andrew Prahlow for that (and also for making a soundtrack that goes hard). I also HAVE to mention that this is the GREATEST game of ALL TIME

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'm not an outdoors guy, but outer space camping to this song would almost make me wanna be

**flibbityflob** (9.2): Every time, tears. What if the world was made for you, what if you saw space and time and came out of it knowing only love and life.

**hikk** (9): i haven't played this game yet, i've heard amazing things, but it's rotting in my steam library - this song might convince me to finally play it though? this is lovely and i think i'd love it a million times more in context

**PhloxInvar** (9): I like how spacey this feels despite it being very country-like.

**seanderlust** (8.4): the opening guitar riff that opens the song made me think it was a slowed down version of chasing cars by snow patrol

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): Better banjo than Banjo-Kazooie.

**Slaycoco** (8): Skinny

**slimboyfriend** (8): Makes me want to play this game and maybe go camping

**notdallin** (7.7): this is actually making me want to play this game‚Ä¶is it any good?

**2RINITY** (7.5): If there's one thing this rate has taught me, it's that there are a lot of games released in the last 10-ish years with songs like this I haven't played yet

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**frogaranaman** (7): banjo in a videogame OST means the storyline is going to cause emotional damage

**JayElecHanukkah** (7): okay it's a little stomp-n-clappy but if you haven't flown into the sun like 6 times in a row trying to land on a tiny lil planet it just might not click

**qazz23** (7): sounds similar to Snow Patrol - Chasing Cars

**rslashpoopheads** (7): the Banjo-Kazooie song if it was actually good

**sarcasticsobs** (7): I am feeling ‚ÄúGravity Falls‚Äù

**throwaway-7650** (7): who submitted (and) let country music into VGI?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This reminds me of Planet Coaster

#Grounded

**Zypker125** (6.7): "lofi beats to relax/study to" energy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I didn‚Äôt know Mumford and Sons were in the rate

**impla77** (6): feels like this could lead somewhere more

**runaway3212** (6): sure

**vayyiqra** (6): Neat game (another one I watched Hana play on Twitch) but I'm not that into the country vibes right now. It's nice though.

**fortyfive33** (5): I'm sorry, did Lord Huron write this?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is the beginning of this song not literally just chasing cars

**shipperondeck** (3): can't stand this kind of sound sorry

**theonewithoutmynudes** (2): I am simply not a twangy music sort of person

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (1): i drank a weed seltzer and have been eating pizza + drinking my adult beverage and the seltzer just started giving me the "hiiiiiiiiii" hug rn and ALL i can think of is the Portlandia cable intro music sketch. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2GikVQXvf0) like god damn it i didn't realize the worst version of a decemberists/boom stomp clap/mumford and large adult sons'/the arcade is fired cut. wow. im NOT doing gamer errands for this one to understand or unlock it!!!

My other poor little child. Going out back to back too! I have so much fondness for both this and the Double Dash version that both would be almost instant-11s if my actual 11 weren't here. Whenever I hear this song it just brings me back to playing N64 for the first times. It never fails to calm me down and I just wish I could've 11'd it alongside Outer Wilds.

As I mentioned earlier, but the [Double Dash Rainbow Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbK2ywEzLsI) is just as calming and nostalgic to me. I also thought that the [Mario Kart 7 Rainbow Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJighbbNphQ) did a fantastic job pulling from the past without seeming to reliant on it. And while the [Mario Kart 8 Remaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuG53TOJqlo) isn't as great as the original, it'd still be an easy 10 if I ever had to rate it. What I really love about all the Rainbow Road themes is that they never rely on darker sounds like other boss themes to be intimidating. Rather, they sound like a celebration for getting to the end of the game. That said they can still inspire fear quite well!

---

#1st Place Racers

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): fun fact: the YouTube video for this song is shorter than the actual course

**nt96** (10): A queer coded this, your honor.

**pig-serpent** (10): This song sounds like pure magic. It made the worst track in MK64 worth playing all by itself.

**qazz23** (10): i keep falling off when trying to do the shortcut

**runaway3212** (10): Fuck it this is too iconic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): such a classic

**throwaway-7650** (10): antis are so boring, this outsold your faves!

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (10): smasha; literally! imagine how many controllers, friendships, marriages, etc collapsing have been soundtracked to this absolutely bonkers good post-4AD x Japan music ditty. at least DOZENS! anyways colossal screw up not having any Sega Daytona USA tracks in the rate here to compete against this; like look, i put a MOH: Frontline, Halo, and Castlevania cuts--do people just not know about Daytona USA? deranged as fuck soundtrack there. anyways go mario.

**2l82bstr8** (9): wherever those flutes in the background are now I hope they're peacefully resting content with the knowledge they'll always be lgbtq+ ICONS

**BebeLuigi** (9): Dare I say this is probably my favourite Mario Kart ost after Waluigi Pinball

**hikk** (9): iconic

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (9): That galloping rhythm ‚Äî that soaring melody ‚Äî brings me back every time. Just don't fall.

**Rigumaro** (9): I feel like it objectively doesn't seem like a great song, but I really like the melody.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Iconic

**Slaycoco** (9): Not as skinny as the double dash version, but we love this!! Unforgettable!

**notdallin** (8.6): a song to make you blissfully forget that you could literally fall into space off of the hardest track in the game

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): how does nintendo manage to make every single rainbow road theme hit so hard

**whatsalanka** (8.2): Would be a high 9 if it was the mk8 version bc the remaster eats the original alive

**flibbityflob** (8.1): YEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH BOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIII

**2RINITY** (8): A great way to capture the end of a long, arduous journey. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta cheat my way to a win 'cause the AI spent the last 15 tracks shamelessly rubberbanding on me

**Exaltatus** (8): Nothing else in this world gives me anxiety like being pushed off of rainbow road on the last lap even though I've been destroying everyone else and have been in first place half the race. It's violence on sight.

**skargardin** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): I'm not good at any Mario Kart game (maybe the NES one but who cares) and this level is a nightmare in every game as well, but it sure is aesthetic. A fun fact is that one time I was in a N64 game tournament when I was about 18. I played Mario Kart and lost pretty badly. I remember flopping badly while racing on this stage. However I won #1 at GoldenEye! Anyway this is a good little ditty even if it doesn't go anywhere for its nearly 5 minute runtime.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This might be the best Rainbow Road theme

**1998tweety** (7.5): worst stage EVER

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): wanna give this a 0 for not being Waluigi Pinball but it still slays

**Zypker125** (7.3): They kept on remixing this song in future Mario Kart Rainbow Roads and they were always leagues superior to the original (ex. The Mario Kart 8 Rainbow Road rendition is a solid 10). The OG version is just too chill and it doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs enough going on.

**2specific4google** (7): - It's called a road, it's called a rainbow road. It is a place where you go, when you die.

**anothertown** (7): she's cute, she just doesn't really evoke rainbow road for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Thank god this course has a fence around it can you imagine falling off the track over and over against to this cheery whimsy??

**ricki** (7): news music

**shhhneak** (7): Haven‚Äôt heard this song in ages because my friends and I banned this course from our plays.

**shipperondeck** (7): i have a good past with this song why do i not dig it as much anymore

**Stryxen** (7): bop but there‚Äôs something off about it that stops it being perfect

**welcome2thejam** (7): Shoutout Lakitu for always picking me up when I fall (from trying to do the shortcut)

#Blue Shellers

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.5): nostalgic but not a favorite of mine

**impla77** (6.4): a bit overrated tbh

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): stream rainbow road by nanobii

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): Need for Speed music goes harder but it‚Äôs nice when the guitars come in

**apatel27** (5): It's passable. Not really grandiose signature race material

**CrimsonROSET** (5): idc this isnt the iconic one for me, it‚Äôs too slow its not chaotic enough for rainbow road

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I would get so so anxious playing this map as a kid that I would black out everything except controlling my character, you could‚Äôve offered me $5 million dollars to tell you how this song went and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do even a second of it

**StroHersh** (5): - its called a road its a rainbow road its where you go when you die

**PhloxInvar** (4.5): No nostalgia for me, so it just comes off as a bunch of flutes. I do like the subtle starry feel, but other than that it's not quite for me.

**BasedButta** (4): i am very sorry mr rainbow road but i found you to be very boring i couldn‚Äôt finish your song i just wanted to do anything else while you played

**frogaranaman** (4): easily the weakest Rainbow Road theme

**RandomHypnotica** (4): rainbow road has always been one of the most boring songs in mario kart to me, and this is no exception i'm afraid

**akanewasright** (3): This is honestly really boring for a climactic race song

So yeah. Vocals were contentious in this rate even if they didn't really comprise of much of the runtime here. In hindsight maybe these types of songs should've been saved for a mixed rate, but since they wouldn't really fit in vocals all that well I think it's fine enough for them to be eligible here. For the song itself, I think it really benefits having something to watch (like gameplay) while it's on, otherwise it feels a little all over the place. Also some of the remixes are incredible. Thanks to bee for showing me this [Smash Bros one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJJmpVvEQ94)

#We Got The Beat

**anothertown** (11): nintendo (derogatory)

**bigbigbee** (11): I went from not knowing this song when the rate was announced to legitimately considering a tattoo of a [huebird of happiness]( https://cdn64.picsart.com/184690737001202.gif) less than one month later

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this is just objectively one of the coolest things a game has ever done. if you haven‚Äôt seen gameplay of remix 10 yet do yourself a favor and watch it RIGHT NOW.

**akanewasright** (10): I never played Rhythm Heaven, but a streamer I followed (TheChongoShow, known for voicing Shadow in the SnapCube Sonic dubs) dearly loved it, and used to use Remix 10 as the last song before he‚Äôd start his streams. He‚Äôd do a bit of a fake out with the ending of the song each time, which was always really charming

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the CHAOS the DRAMA the RHYTHM justice for i love you my one and only

**nt96** (10): the score was already written for me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): finally a track with the correct number for it's score in the title

**seanderlust** (10): not even in the video game instrumental rate can we escape the sounds of men singing :pensive:

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): remix 9.9* because of the vocals I fear

**Zypker125** (9.5): Bopbopbopbop

**1998tweety** (9): ok bop but I'd expect nothing less from a game with that title

**qazz23** (9): this is a neat mashup

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): why are there WORDS in here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**DaHumanTorch** (8.8): bohemian rhapsody WISHES

**notdallin** (8.7): from what little I know about this game, this song sounds like it would be stupidly difficult

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): like it wants me to give it a 10 but im NOT doing it! XD n e wayzzz...i was never good at DDR and it still scares me. call me captain jack tho! (not cactus jack)

**apatel27** (8): Some parts stick out but overall pretty good

**BasedButta** (8): that guy jumpscared me but he rocks

**BebeLuigi** (8): wow the bop

**Rigumaro** (8): This was difficult to score, because it's a mash up of a bunch of different songs, and some I lile better than others. Still, it had me bouncing in my chair the whole way through.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): pick a consistent rhythm??? jk. I honestly would‚Äôve not liked this if not for someone showing me actual gameplay along with it, looks fun.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): jabbing minigame with the stickman that gains muscles is my favorite. also I swear the video with the minigames on display goes so much harder, the post is sabotaging the song. Lonely Storm goes so hard deserves VGV2

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The vocals legitimately jump scared me a bit.

**DefaultPophead** (7): Liked it until the voices started in my head.

**Hulnia** (7): it feels kinda empty with the sound effects from the game tbh

**PhloxInvar** (7): Ahhhh Remix 10. One of the most confusing songs if you've never played the game for sure. I still love the medley of the entire game, but it's not my favorite and there are better individual songs in Rhythm Heaven.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I really need to start playing more video games, Rhythm Heaven was the shit when I was 8.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): THERE WERE VOCALS THIS IS AN ILLEGAL SUBMISSION!!!

**skargardin** (7): bops a little

**slimboyfriend** (7): It‚Äôs good but if I had to hear it looped even one more time I think I‚Äôd go insane :)))

**vayyiqra** (7): Never heard of this game! This is fun.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Are we really rating this as a song? Cause like this is one of my favorite game series of all time, but asking me to listen to and rate this is a different story

#Ew Vocals

**2specific4google** (6.2): - I want to rate it higher but it's not actually that fun to listen to a string of different songs like that.

**2RINITY** (6): Had to dock points for having multiple intelligible lines of vocals, but this does a great job of stringing variations on its main idea together

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): more like remix 6/10

**frogaranaman** (6): this song may finally beat the "rating the song with the number in the title" curse

**welcome2thejam** (6): Think it needs the minigame sound effects to really sound complete

**Slaycoco** (5): Meh‚Ä¶ Chorus Kids you will never be good enough for smash!!

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (4.5): A medley of tired, rehashed, drivel that can't hold its own attention for more than five seconds at a time.

**thedoctordances1940** (4): deducting some points cause while sure that's not many vocals, it is two whole lines and in this rate that really stands out a lot (obviously not in a good way for what should be an instrumental rate)

**shipperondeck** (3.5): do yall seriously play rhythm games to these kinds of songs? this is why we need vocaloid rate

**theonewithoutmynudes** (3.5): was this intended to be a medley bc every time I would start getting into a groove the vibe changed giving very mario party minigame music

**JayElecHanukkah** (3): it's like someone layered 15 VLTs on top of each other

**runaway3212** (2): FLIPPERROLL

**impla77** (1.6): looks frustrating

**Exaltatus** (1): Way too chaotic, do people just listen to this straight through? I'd go crazy, this is the ADHD of music.

**flava** (1): vocals, in an instrumental rate? now I never!

Supergiant you've been robbed again. Look what they did to you in VGV and now VGI. I think they've typically shined more on their vocal songs than their instrumental ones (not to shade their instrumental tracks cause some of them, like this, are full of life and energy. But there's something unique about hearing Ashley Barrett and Darren Korb in the world themselves.) Anyways Hades; fun game, fantastic music, god-tier character design. Highly recommend you all play it if you enjoy action games and haven't.

---

#Had a Greek Mythology Phase

**2l82bstr8** (10): I'm too biased to speak level-headedly about Hades but like... look at the material!

**apatel27** (10): Darren Korb refuses to miss

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): god, zagreus is so hot

**BasedButta** (10): the ‚Äúchorus‚Äù slaps real hard wtf

**CrimsonROSET** (10): himbo anthem

**DefaultPophead** (10): ya killin' it korby senpai

**fortyfive33** (10): merciful end go brrr

**PhloxInvar** (10): Darren Korb from his interviews said he makes a first song as a basis for the rest of the tracks. For Hades, it was this song, and you can definitely see its influence in all the tracks following it. Fun fact: Darren has described Hades' OST genre as "Mediterranean Prog-Rock Halloween"... which I feel accurately describes this song honestly. Perfect introduction to the game honestly. Honestly, I feel like this song could totally have been a vocal song if it didn't happen to be the main exploration music. Darren Korb vocals would fit nicely.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Another game I need to play. I love the aesthetic and themes, and every song I‚Äôve heard has been a 10

**seanderlust** (10): when I catch those plague monsters that shoot poison darts at you in the final level out in these streets it is on SIGHT

**skargardin** (10): the chokehold Hades had on me in winter 2020 really would make you think there was no escape

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this goes hard ~~and so do I when I see any Hades character~~

**throwaway-7650** (10): whoa... is that hades on the cover art? he's kind of hot

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Zagreus can adamantly rail me any day

**turtle\_on\_mars** (9.8): JUSTICE FOR GOOD RIDDANCE COMING IN AT #47 IN THE VIDEO GAME VOCAL RATE

**1998tweety** (9.5): what Zagreus whispers into my ear right before [redacted]

**2RINITY** (9): BRB gotta sing the entirety of "Do You Call My Name?" by RA on top of this instrumental

**celladonn** (9): stan darren korb

**Rigumaro** (9): Wow I had never heard this before, but I love it.

**runaway3212** (9): god this guy on the cover whatever his name is is so hot

**Slaycoco** (9): Makes me want to play the gayme.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): god i really need to play hades someday, everything ive heard and seen about it look so amazing

**impla77** (8.7): pretty epic

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): darren korb can pluck my guitar strings

**shipperondeck** (8.5): this game is so cool even though i never did finish it

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): yeahhhh, could be longer but like this is cool

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.4): it was a grower for me sorta Muse like

**flibbityflob** (8.3): A lot of my discussions are going to be me hooting and hollering about video game composers, and Darren Korb of Supergiant Games is no exception here. He‚Äôs a master of his work. Playing Hades is an experience like no other, and it speaks to the way Supergiant makes games, I think. Music is a part of the development cycle from the first moments, the sound of a game made by this team is as distinctive as the artstyle, as the voice acting, as the way they just flow. Hades is an incredible game and so much is added by the score. Even in this, you hear the whole game laid out before you; Hades‚Äô pulsating guitars and Elysium‚Äôs theramins, there may be no escape, but there‚Äôs a path for you to fight through.

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (8.2): love the jesus lizard and saint vitus. this imagines a less heavy, 0% alcohol version of the formula perhaps? im talking outta my ass but lol its fine.

**anothertown** (8): let's go they/thems

**bigbigbee** (8): Did you have a Greek Mythology phase or were you normal? Not even a Percy Jackson fan btw, because I was TOO! OLD! when that came out! #don‚Äôtwatchtheanimeifyouhaven‚Äôtreadthemanga #hermesstan #artemistoo

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (8): I'm a big fan of the instrumentation used here. It's got some good crunch. This song never got boring or irritating over the 100+ hours I put in to this game.

**qazz23** (8): the buildup to the end is so good

**Stryxen** (7.5): HIT

**Zypker125** (7): This song doesn‚Äôt do anything for me, but it doesn‚Äôt have any notable downsides and I need to inflate my scores so that my rate submission doesn‚Äôt get rejected lol

#Horny Police

**akanewasright** (6): one of these days I‚Äôll actually play the copy of hades I‚Äôve had sitting around for ages

**Exaltatus** (6): Didn't really care for it.

**BebeLuigi** (5): It's fine? Nothing groundbreaking to me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Maybe this is just too badass for me.

**cremeebrulee** (5): all my knowledge of hades comes from 3.5 people i know on discord who regularly thirst over characters from it

**frogaranaman** (5): BONK BONK HORNY POLICE

**rslashpoopheads** (5): honestly I know nothing about this game other than that it made gay people horny as hell

**sarcasticsobs** (4): [Pokes with a stick] C‚Äômooon, do something!!

**vayyiqra** (4): It's okay but doesn't go anywhere

**notdallin** (3.5): y‚Äôall really like boss battle music huh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): the VGI version of Dream Theater is not my vibe

And so there goes the track with the most 11s on day 1. Maybe it was just due to the reigning championship of Simple and Clean (which you should all give 10s to in Winners 3), but I felt like this was one of the favourites going into the rate so I'm extremely surprised it's leaving this early!! And it's not even the 0's fault - without that ballot it still wouldn't be making day 2! I can see without context how some might find this a bit dull, but personally I think this is an absolutely gorgeous track - even from when I first heard it on the KH2 menu before I knew the depths of madness involved in the KH franchise. For as straightforward as this track is you'd think that the games would match it. Yoko Shimomura has called this one of her favourite creations and its not hard to see why (though in the raterbase it seems Guile's theme, which she also composed, wins the matchup for her tracks in this rate).

Though I think this and [KH1's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixSrQI-J-80) are the top for most fans, I'd like to give a shout out to the version in [Kingdom Hearts 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL_uJJyWJ_E) which adds a ton of absolutely gorgeous piano flourishes to elevate the theme to a different experience. For the rest of the series there's of course the vocal themes which everyone knows, though my underrated fave of the bunch is [Passion (After the Battle)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RAW_uCCi9k) from KH2. There's a ton of amazing choices for battle themes, but for me nothing beats the epicness of [Vim and Vigor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krzeqqjs12A) and heartbreak of [The Other Promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9XljBWGrRQ). And for overworld music it's easy to embrace the cozyness of [Lazy Afternoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSdNxXGUaRU) (yes I'm a bigger KH2 fan how can you tell?)

#Did somebody mention the door to darkness

**akanewasright** (11): I feel like nearly every Kingdom Hearts fan has had a moment or two where they just‚Ä¶ let this loop on the title screen for a while and maybe teared up a little. Kingdom Hearts is a deeply silly game, sometimes in ways that work, sometimes in ways that involve time travel, but it‚Äôs always got this earnestness, this sweetness, this beating heart behind it all. This song (the best version of it) is kinda the perfect encapsulation of that

**BebeLuigi** (11): Beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautfiul

**Exaltatus** (11): Kingdom Hearts is so special to me. KH1 is the first game I ever properly got into and finished completely as a kid. And all the music in it is truly magical.

**MrMushrooms** (11): Honestly this one deserves like a 20+, one point for each of its amazing remixes.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this song is just so... magical. When I first played Kingdom Hearts II, i'd never played any type of JRPG before, and loading up that main menu and hearing this to that iconic white background with sora eating an icypole, it was burned in my mind, the gentle keys with the perfect orchestration behind it to just carry you away. I vividly remember having a dream not long after where I was inside the menu of KH2, with this song playing, and feeling at absolute peace. I wasn't in a white abyss, but instead in a little cottage in the forest, and it was such a total sense of warmth and completeness, and that's why i adore this song.

**skargardin** (11): I don't know a better song omg

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): explain the kingdom hearts lore in under 10 minutes challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): again why are you hurting me like this its just so pretty

**flava** (10): trying to payola my dearly departed as the interlude pls tilt, i‚Äôll give it a 10

**hikk** (10): i know nothing about kingdom hearts but im crying a bit. im gonna give this a 10 cuz i just know that if i had any investment or knowledge in kh i'd sob to this

**notdallin** (10): so simple yet so powerful. I love that with every passing game, this theme gets grander and grander

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Yoko Shimomura is one of the greatest composers of all time

**sarcasticsobs** (10): gOD DAmNIt, even the instrumentals of this stupid game series make me wanna cry??

**seanderlust** (10): the way this simple piano ballad had me in a stranglehold during kh1/2/CoM era.....of all the songs in this rate, this is the one that gives me the strongest warm fuzzies of nostalgia.

**shhhneak** (10): Music‚Äôs pretty amazing because a few piano keys on repeat can give me chills every time.

**throwaway-7650** (10): goofyfloat poohascend [utada emote]

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Two-time rate winner Kingdom Hearts???

**1998tweety** (9): serve

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): They should refit this one for Video Game Vocal 2 where it‚Äôs just various Goofy noises mixed in.

**JayElecHanukkah** (9): this game is not a real thing it is a psyop from a 6 year old's fanfiction that has somehow gaslit you all. You really think an officially licensed game where goofy fights cloud strife exists and isn't just the lie of a child? Come on. V serene piano though

**StroHersh** (9): - i am winnie the poohing off into the sky

**flibbityflob** (8.9): CRYING SOBBING SCREAMING!! I haven‚Äôt even FINISHED Kingdom Hearts but this still hits like a fucking freight train.

**apatel27** (8): The strings

**Rigumaro** (8): Really good. But haven't played the games so I don't vibe with it as much as it probably deserves.

**runaway3212** (8): why do I stan this randomly

**bigbigbee** (7): I know that the use of Disney characters in these games is kind of a precursor to the soulless, ‚Äúhail corporate‚Äù Disney games that we get now that are for GRoWing BRAnD LoYaLTY‚Ä¶but I honestly think it works beautifully here, in a game aimed at (relatively) young audiences: well thought out, and most importantly FUN. If the KH series was just about that, I would have played all of them‚Ä¶but instead, Square decided that the most interesting thing about their game was the anime characters, and so I‚Äôve never had any desire to play any of them

**pig-serpent** (7): I've never played this game so I like to assume this music plays during Goofy's funeral.

**shipperondeck** (7): this is very pretty i just wish it wasn't in kingdom hearts

**vayyiqra** (7): Someday I will understand what the hell this game series even is but for now it's just "the weird game that has Mickey Mouse for some reason and a bunch of songs by Utada Hikaru" and that's enough to go on for now. Good music! Very pretty. Love the piano.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Based off this title I'm gonna assume Goofy died nobody correct me

**2RINITY** (5): The KH1 version is a 10, but in KH2's arrangement, the main piano drives me crazy by only playing half the notes, therefore it gets half the score

This was teetering on the edge of day 1/day 2 for a while and though I hoped it could make it back into day 2 it just couldn't get the numbers. Though I had never played the game before it got voted in I actually picked it up a couple of weeks ago after hearing rave reviews. Though I'm still early in the game, I love hearing the Whirling in Rags theme off in the background. Something about the track is so enthusiastic and calming - it feels a little like a warm fire in song form. Again, not super far in - but something about the [Martinaise Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVMAF6rtxY) that plays when you first get out into the world really makes you feel like you're in this cold and unknown environment - yet one that begs for exploration and understanding.

#White check passed!

**2l82bstr8** (11): this is anti-pop right

**shhhneak** (11): HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARDCORE! My absolute favourite game in this rate (and I‚Äôm not even finished.) I think it might have one of the best ambient soundtracks of all time.

**anothertown** (10): any kimkitsuragiheads in the crowd

**apatel27** (10): There's something so soothing about this type of music

**BasedButta** (10): japanese breakfast?

**BebeLuigi** (10): I didn't play Disco Elysium so this was a really nice discovery, it's so good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is very very pretty but I hate looking at this Dark Seed ass cover art.

**celladonn** (10): I didn't realise how fond I was of this song until I listened to it for this rate. God, this game is so good in every way

**cremeebrulee** (10): now why is this game not called indie rock elysium. (on a serious note love how serene this one sounds, i've made my mind up that this is gonna be the next game i get from this rate)

**PhloxInvar** (10): This energy is immaculate. If I had to describe Disco Elysium's soundtrack, it would honestly be something like tranquil devastation. Most of the tracks in this OST feel so lonely, but this is one of the few that feels joyous. Honestly, it's very post-apocalyptic (like all the other songs) even though the game isn't set in such a time. Makes it even more poignant. That said, they are better songs in-game than by itself, but it's just so good. Definitely 11 energy, but another one takes that cake for me.

**skargardin** (10): this actually made me want to spend more time in the lobby

**flibbityflob** (9.8): KIM KITSURAGI - He smiles at you. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dreary day, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù YOU ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a day where we‚Äôre ranking all of these pieces of music. It could be worse.‚Äù KIM KITSURAGI ‚Äì He laughs, shaking his head. EMPATHY ‚Äì He‚Äôs enjoying the sound of the Whirling in Rags, you realise. The thrumming beat and the guitars that drive the soundtrack forward, the trumpets that make up the sonic identity of this game you‚Äôre a part of. It sounds like Revachol. It sounds like life, bearing through, after the storm. You‚Äôre working the worst job in the world, but it‚Äôs music like this that makes you feel alive. You‚Äôve got the urge to dance along. DRAMA [Challenging: Success] ‚Äì You dance, boogie along to the sound that makes you feel alive, the stunning piano solo and the way it makes you feel alive. It‚Äôs good to be alive, you think. You‚Äôre even managing to make a couple of these dance moves look good. THE HOMO-SEXUAL UNDERGROUND ‚Äì I hope the gays of popheads appreciate this joke, because it‚Äôs taking a strength of will known by few to make. YOU ‚Äì You‚Äôre good at this! What‚Äôs your next move? Maybe you can impress Kim by pulling off a really epic dance move? 1. Oh god, I‚Äôm dancing. We‚Äôre dancing. Absolutely fucking not. [Stop dancing] 2. Nope, this is working for me! 3. Do something crazy. The music‚Äôs that good, it‚Äôs worth dancing along to. (Chosen: option 3, do something crazy) PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT [Impossible: Failure] ‚Äì You smash your toe into the staircase as you attempt what some might call an ‚Äúimpossible dance move‚Äù but you like to think of as ‚Äúa good time.‚Äù It‚Äôs bad. You collapse onto the karaoke bar, and GARTE stares at you. GARTE, THE CAFETERIA MANAGER ‚Äì He clears his throat at you, looking exhausted. ‚ÄúPlease, sir. Would you mind not breaking our karaoke stage.‚Äù It‚Äôs not a request. KIM KITSURAGI ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôd have succeeded if it was Instrument of Surrender, that‚Äôs the one I come back to when I‚Äôm in the mood to feel inspired. In fact, if it had been in this rate, the writer would have given that his 11.‚Äù YOU ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre right. Still, Kim, isn‚Äôt the sound for the Whirling in Rags just one of the best feelings in the whole world?‚Äù KIM KITSURAGI ‚Äì He nods. You‚Äôre not wrong.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): one of my friends keeps nagging me to play this game. maybe I will now because this goes hard

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): lovely indie rock instrumental

**Rigumaro** (9): Sorry to be oddly specific, but this song makes me feel like I moved to a new city, and after the initial struggle, I'm finally starting to feel comfortable and the anxiety is going away, and know that I'll be okay.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): go off Fleet Foxes

**Stryxen** (9): NEED to play this. So cool

**stupidslappa** (9): I really intend to play this game. Fully expected to hear Chris Martin break into the song LOL

**theonewithoutmynudes** (9): this sounds like it could be on an indieheads fresh thread and I mean that in the nicest way possible I am v curious about what this game is

**welcome2thejam** (9): Damn this makes me wanna spin around carelessly alone in the city streets

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): honestly I bought this game and played it for 2 hours and it was just so fucking boring but the soundtrack is amazing

**steelstepladder** (8.5): those rags do whirl

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): the start of this sounds like butter

**2RINITY** (8): What a nice song from that game where you can fuck up your stat build and accidentally rip your own arm off trying to open the fridge. The buildup and climax is great too

**fortyfive33** (8): British Sea Power are a great band

**nt96** (8): is this indie

**sarcasticsobs** (8): ‚ÄúThis game met me at a very strange time in my life. It will never be forgotten. As painful as it can be to play--its immaculate writing and genius integration of mechanics and story‚Ä¶ If you played the game, and read this--dont let it slip away as just another game. This might be one of the more important games advancing the medium; a status quo changer that occured within a human art form that will no doubt go on‚Ä¶ If you read this, and somehow haven't played Disco Elysium: don't read anything else. Go buy it, steal it, pay them back later; whatever you have to do to play this.‚Äù - YouTube user AudiosurfArchive, 1 month ago

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): this is what indieheads VGI would sound like

**seanderlust** (7.7): this feels like it would be the instrumental to a beloved yet underrated indie pop bop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): oh i didn't realise (british) sea power were in this, cool track

**notdallin** (7.4): bonus points for bringing in an actual band to do the soundtrack

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**akanewasright** (7): why do the drums in the intro sound like Butter by BTS

**bigbigbee** (7): In this game, if you defend women enough times, you gain the trait "Inexplicable Feminist Agenda", which gives you +2 in all your interactions against men and +1 to your empathy (a.k.a. if we were rating the games this would be a 10)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): disco elysium is the indieheads of videogames i will not elaborate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): very much a British adult contemporary vibes backing track

**Exaltatus** (7): This is a plant by indieheads, I know it. Still bangs, though.

**frogaranaman** (7): this sounds like some indie instrumental band I'd randomly get attached to as a teen and call them influential or some shit

**Monsieur\_Marguerite** (7): I'd listen to this to chill out. Too much snare though ‚Äî it's distracting.

**pig-serpent** (7): On one hand it is pretty, but it's just one mediocre barrotone away from having a 4.1 on RYM and living in the category of indie rock bands that drive me up a wall.

**qazz23** (7): calm and soothing

**Slaycoco** (7): Another game I never played, but I appreciate what I‚Äôm hearing.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Not the first few seconds giving me B*tter flashbacks

TiltControls: #Red Check [Impossible]

**Hulnia** (6): it‚Äôs giving butter

**runaway3212** (6): im frankly kinda bored im sorry

**shipperondeck** (6): so: 1. where's the disco 2. the art and general vibe of this game is absolutely not what i expected

**vayyiqra** (6): Lol it's funny because it has "disco" in the name and it's a meme that Popheads thinks every dance-pop song ever is disco, which they do; but also this song isn't disco at all! It's dream pop!! [citation needed]

**impla77** (5.8): chill vibe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i‚Äôll be honest i don‚Äôt really feel anything from this

**ricki** (5): this would be a slay phoebe bridgers song

**hikk** (4): this is very much i know nothing about this game so this song is not hitting at all

**xXxWaneHaloGamertoc\_420xXx** (3): what the fuck is here that a 2012 captured tracks act couldn't sate? forreal? a cross between "wild nothing shite longform" and "edward sharp and magnetic zeroes" wine mom core. wow gamer anthems are truly running on empty.

**Zypker125** (2): Starts off droning/dragging and then becomes notably more unsettling/uncomfortable as it progresses. Not for me.

**fadedblue09** (1): this was so dreary sorry
