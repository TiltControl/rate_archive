# Stats

* Participants: [120 weeaboos](https://pastebin.com/c73ZM5xL)
* Average Score: 7.080
* Average Controversy Score^(‡): 2.051

^(‡) The controversy score = a measure of how spread out the scores are. For example, a song with scores of 10 and 1 will have the same average score as a song with two 5.5s, but the former has a higher "controversy". For stat nerds, this is the standard deviation.

~~Attack on Titan - Feuerroter Pfeil und Bogen~~

~~Baccano - Gun's & Roses~~

~~Bakemongatari - Renai Circulation~~

~~BEASTARS - Wild Side~~

~~Chainsaw Man - KICKBACK~~

**bigbigbee** (7): Potentially the most Italian anime in the rate?

---

#fight, fight

**TiltControls** (8.5): a smile bomb is just an older yass grenade

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): is a smile bomb a downgraded version of a yass grenade

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): oh im so fucking obsessed with this. what a groovy little ditty

**distressedbeatboxing** (11): I have a feeling many are going to pass this up for being mellower and less bombastic compared to the rate’s heaviest hitters but for me, this is perfect. The English dub cover is also an anomaly in that it’s still fucking great.

**mongeese0** (11): The bass, the emotive voice, perfection. Rare occasion where the dub absolutely kills it too - I even prefer it.

**BebeLuigi** (10): YESSSSS so happy this is here it's so good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Fantastic show. Where Judy & Mary - Sobakasu

**phonethephoenix** (10): love the retro vibe! excellent vocals.

**Qwilphish** (10): this feels like it was a song that was pulled rather than a song that was made for this show

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Yusuke, Kazuma, and Keiko, my friends. Botan and Genkai, my guardians and protectors. Kurama and Hiei, my beloveds

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): I actually love this anime much more than I ever did Chobits but Let Me Be With You is just so much more powerful a bop

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): Recently been watching Yu Yu Hakusho's first 28 episodes (dvd boxset) with the 2002 funimation dub...it took TEN years for this to air in the states?!?! jesus! anyways let's go over a couple things here. 1) watch the 2002 dub, Cynthia Crnaz does a brilliant no-frills lil' british accent on Botan and its adorable. 2) the intro in both Japanese and English is fucking undefeated. like holy shit the pacing translated brilliantly

**alexismateofan** (9): This song has DRIP, much like the fashions of the main characters. STYLISH

**dysphorbs** (9): would be a 10 but the random guitar ruined it. loving the city pop vibes otherwise

**maybecrf** (9): classic anime sound in the best way

**saviorARMY101** (9): A bop!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): idk who this singer is but she gave it her ALL

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): ended fromis_9 - love bomb

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Loving the 80's freestyle/funk vibes here! This one is uber-dope.

**vexastrae** (8.5): this song manifested citypop rate <3

**beeozan** (8.2): Wish we could turn back time to the good old days when our mama sang us city pop songs for shonen openings but now we’re stressed out

**allodude** (8): gimme that city pop

**cheatviathan** (8): Okay. This bops in that distinctly early ‘90s way, and that gives it a unique identity amongst the other tracks in the rate. That synth bass and those rhythm guitars make me nod my head uncontrollably, and that solo is killer.

**Nagisoid** (8): Love Bomb is about to EXPLODE

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**apatel27** (7): Vintage

**dreamingpastel** (7): OK, but imagine Dua Lipa sampling this in a song. It would be a bop.

**nyoom** (7): i like altos

**prettybirbkotori** (7): i like it but man that ending is abrupt

**vayyiqra** (7): cool ending track to the rate do i pick up on some city pop here ... also neat funk guitar. it's the sound of the summer

**hacatu** (6.5): Quite dated

**wujinan** (6.5): classic but doesn't sound distinct

**pig-serpent** (6): It's a little too light and floaty for my action anime tastes. That said, I have always thought about mashing it up with "The Type of Pony Everypony Should Know." 

 I started watching this show at the right age for it and gave up around the dark tournament arc, probably because I was watching it on youtube because I hadn't discovered kissanime yet. (ps don't use that site, nyaa!)  I don't have much desire to go back but the show was cool so.

**Poydoo** (5): death note

**Zypker125** (5): Yu Yu Hakusho was an action shounen classic that aired from 1992-1995. While a very popular anime overall, I do think the younger anime fans (ie. “those who got into anime after 2015”) have not really watched it (causing it to fall in terms of popularity), and that includes me. Unfortunately, I am quite the ageist when it comes to my opinions on songs, and Yu Yu Hakusho falls into the “forgettable older song” to me. It’s not *boring* and it doesn’t do anything poorly (aside from maybe an overly repetitive instrumental), it’s just that nothing sticks out to me. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**IIIHenryIII** (3): you can’t use the word bomb in your song title and proceed to not deliver a banger

**shhhneak** (2.9): I should get bangs…

**bigbigbee** (7): This is not bad at all, but it is in fact completely washed by the song "Ohayou" by the original 1999 anime. Hunter X Hunter is a wildly popular shonen series that has been strongly recommended to me by my roommate, and I think it looks good! This song had a spell in Day 2 but its fans brought it back to Day 3 as we closed out.

---

**amr** (11): of course the most perfectest show featured here gets the most perfectest song it's only right

**Around-town** (11): When I started watching this anime I had to stop myself from listening to this song on repeat in case accidentally made myself sick of it before I finished the anime

**maybecrf** (11): im convinced this intro cures all diseases of despair

**beeozan** (10): dodges misandry by actually delivering good vocals (consistently good instrumental throughout too) no wonder this man fronts a power metal band. they slay btw check out galneryus and their album angel of salvation (full caps) which had one of the endings of hxh too

**horridhendy** (10): It’s just so catchy and fun to sing along to. All I need to hear is those drums and I’m like DAICHI WO FUMISHIMETE…

**PSSST12** (10): You know the Theme is perfection when they used this one all throughout the 168 Episodes 😤😤😤 It's just that good

**Qwilphish** (10): Top 5 Material right here. They knew it was so good that they just kept using for the entire show!! And I watched it every time

**saviorARMY101** (10): A fucking banger, I really hope they keep this as a theme song whenever HxH comes back

**seanderlust** (10): this slaps when taking off on a flight

**DutchPeasant** (9): Madhouse knew what they were cooking for keeping this OP for 148 episodes straight. Always able to lift my spirits with that oh so cheerful "You can smiiiiile again!!!". The rest of the lyrics are also very positive.

**evanbrooks324** (9): do I love it cause it's a good song or cause it's my favorite anime trying not to be biased tho

**mongeese0** (9): Always liked the first and last 30 seconds a good amount more than the middle. Those opening sounds definitely trigger some kind of pavlovian response...

**wujinan** (9): always get shivers hearing the intro

**Zypker125** (8.7): *Insert “Hunter x Hunter hasn’t been abandoned yet” copium* Hunter x Hunter is a shounen action anime that’s both super-popular *and* super-highly-rated, arguably the highest-rated shounen of its kind. It was 148 episodes long, a pretty beefy length for an anime in the 2010s, and the story didn’t even reach its conclusion at the end of the series. We’ll probably never get a true ending for Hunter x Hunter. Ah well, onto the song. While Departure follows a rather standard anime OP formula musically, it does it pretty well. The mixing between the vocals and the instrumentals is nice, the instrumental choice is pleasant, and the ‘boisterous’ feeling of the vocals elevates the energy of the song. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**vexastrae** (8.5): a bop and a half!

**1998tweety** (8): bops

**alexismateofan** (8): fucking banger of an opening, that’s what’s going on here today. Loved the opening part of it the most.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I live for when the movie Hunter Hunter came out and weebs thought it was related to the anime

**korobizaka** (8): i think the best thing about the hunter x hunter openings is that you hear different snippets of the whole song with each new version. its a fun and hopeful song and easy to sing along to

**Lynflower680** (8): The 80s synths are hype.

**vayyiqra** (8): this has to be one of the most anime-theme-ish anime themes to ever anime-theme (complimentary)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): sounds kinda gay to me idk

**phonethephoenix** (7.6): you can smile :)

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): hunter/hunter this pronoun shit getting outta hand

**apatel27** (7): synths

**Nagisoid** (7): I would give this a higher score if I hadn't listened to this like 200 times thanks to the anime never using a different song as the OP. The second opening from the 1999 HxH anime is better but the results wouldn't reflect that thanks to it being an indie rock britpop-esque song that's way sadder than this, and what can you do about it?

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Blue eyes and skateboards omg he's just like me fr. Why is the villain The Joker, is this a Batman prequel?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I love that it's a nice throwback to the era of cheesy shonen openings but also we kinda left that behind for a reason

**hacatu** (6.5): The first couple of seconds are ten/ten, but after that it's very underwhelming

**impla77** (6.4): actually you don’t pronou-{GUNSHOTS]

**cremeebrulee** (6): ended airline terminals

**prettybirbkotori** (6): completely unremarkable song also why is it called hunter hunter why would the x be silent

**nyoom** (5.5): [and then hunter 2 says "kiss me, you darn fool"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3N-Y7rFrSk)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this particular singing style grates my ears so much and i cant really explain why

**BebeLuigi** (5): I love love LOVE this anime but I never cared about that song at all sob

**cheatviathan** (5): This one is a resounding meh for me. I’d watch it once per binge, but I’d never listen to the full version on my own volition. It’s pretty mediocre as far as shounen OPs go, at least for me. If there’s ever an ED rate, please put “HUNTING FOR YOUR DREAM” on there. That one kicks ass.

**dysphorbs** (5): sounds like childhood

**pig-serpent** (5): Anime openings stop dropping everything interesting about the song as soon as the verse starts (impossible) 

 I've seen exactly 2 episodes of this show and one of them was SCHWING

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (4.2): genuinely one of my least favorite parts of the entire show is how this intro never changes and just coasts on painfully nicecore vibes. man hunter x hunter is such a bizarre nothingburger of a show. i've watched 100 episodes and I still could not tell you if we accomplished anything besides "got to the deviantart arc...wow this is so fucking long". but you can smile! (that part is adorable but this shit is like so cookie cutter hype up ditty!)

**Poydoo** (4): death note

**shhhneak** (2): Have y’all never watched an anime because you just know from the protagonist’s design that he’s going to be annoying? Yeah

**bigbigbee** (11): I haven't seen a single episode of this anime but I still love this song with my whole heart. My 11 had no competition. This is end-of-a-teenage-romcom music that plays as our heroes meet at a dance under the stars. It's so nostalgic to me and it fills me to bursting with joy every time I hear it - seriously, like the happiness might just about spill out of me at any moment, and I want to give that feeling to others. ❤️ I was a bit worried at the beginning there, but once it hit Day 3 it was there for the rest of the rate, and I'm glad!

---

**allodude** (10): hopefully we will get to rate EDs too

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): KISS KISS FALL IN LOVE!!

**cheatviathan** (10): One easy way to short circuit my critical faculties is to invoke my fondness for 2000s pop punk. Those “sk8er boi”-ass guitar leads at the start hit like a fucking train, and the rest of the song brings a similar energy. This one’s going on the plan to watch list for sure.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended the concept of romance

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): BANGER ALERT! i have so many lovely memories of watching Ouran with my college roommates one summer in 2012. we watched Ouran and Noah’s Arc, that 2000s Logo show that was like the Black version of Queer as Folk. Iconic, some time in early quarantine despair I bought all the episodes of Noah’s Arc online klsdlkdslk. When the them song wins charity rate yasssss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTmmE7UL68M

**dreamingpastel** (10): Stunning, amazing, iconic, a true masterpiece.

**horridhendy** (10): This is cheesy in the best way. If Avril wrote an anime OP…

**IIIHenryIII** (10): what in the disney channel

**PSSST12** (10): Wanna give this an 11 just for the fact that I almost died of laughtet watching this shit. it also helps that this in fact is pop perfection

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): infectiously catchy

**nyoom** (9.5): this show fast-tracked an entire generation of homophobes into lifelong yaoi enthusiasts and it's so real for that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): come on now

**Dragusken** (9): kiss kiss, pretty song; good shoujo vibe song

**dysphorbs** (9): its cheesy af but it sounds like something avril lavigne would have put out in the mid 2000s and im here for it

**hacatu** (9): A bop to be certain, but for some reason I feel like I'm on a list now?

**macnbee** (9): so i watched this in high school and told my friend about the weird incest twins like: imagine the degeneracy! she then revealed to me she wrote fred/george fanfiction and I was like Ah, sorry for overstepping by criticizing wincest. she later went to harvard.

**vexastrae** (9): fujoshi national anthem !! drawing the national flag on deviantart as we speak

**nt96** (8.5): https://rave.dj/kZZyJM59twHDqQ

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8.1): this anime seems like it would have done great with boys 8-12 who watched cartoon network after school between 2004-2007.

**1998tweety** (8): some of the singing in the chorus is a little rough but the rest of the song slaps

**alexismateofan** (8): Mori Senpai deserves the world.

**CrystaltheCool** (8): KISS KISS FALL IN LOVE

**pheromenos** (8): sk8er boi what are you doing here???

**pig-serpent** (8): Probably the biggest surprise of the rate, I was not expecting this show to have an OP that slaps this hard.

**Poydoo** (8): those drums ❤

**prettybirbkotori** (8): CORNYYYY (ignore the score)

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): To this day whenever I hear Sk8er Boi I STILL think of this song

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): This feels so 2000s but in a positive way, it makes me feel nostalgic

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): very sk8er boi (i haven't heard any of these songs before so sorry if this is a tired comparison)

**wujinan** (7.5): this song plays in my head randomly sometimes

**indie\_fan\_** (7.2): he was a boy. she was a girl. can i make it a-

**distressedbeatboxing** (7): Tamaki was one of the greatest proto-himbos of our formative years.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): This sounds like Sk8er boi

**Nagisoid** (7): Going to tell my kids this was Heartstopper

**shhhneak** (7): This anime has such a specific brand of fan that I don’t want to engage with but I can’t lie, this chewed a bit.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Make your theme song a power pop bop? That's a paddlin'

**impla77** (6.7): i don’t know how to feel..

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): what in the disney channel

**sarcasticsobs** (6.2): Not "bad" but not for me!

**apatel27** (6): Disney Channel sounding song

**beeozan** (6): every gender studies students' favorite anime and they chose to sing sk8er boi as its opening cuz the venn diagram of the group and avril fans is probably a circle. the vocalist almost sounds too cutesy for the instrumental but then the lyrics are like kiss kiss fall in love so I can't really be mad about that.

**ImAWeebDuh** (6): the ending of this sounds like Hannah Montana - Rock Star riff

**maybecrf** (6): its a 6 for anime avril lavigne, im so sorry

**milkywayinradius** (6): those guitar chords are giving me he was a boy, she was a girl

**MrSwearword** (6): just this side of tacky, if I'm being honest

**vayyiqra** (6): elsewhere in my ballot i say i hate anything even vaguely pop-punk-ish [citation needed] so this feels hypocritical but idk this is kind of good !

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (5): weird girls across the planet were all watching this one in year 7

**DutchPeasant** (4): Whilst I could like this song back then, nowadays it unfortunately does not fare well.

**Qwilphish** (4): The vocals aren't giving they way they are supposed to

**Zypker125** (3.4): Ah, *the* classic reverse harem (a female character with multiple male love interest characters). I forgot how ‘childish’ the aesthetic of this show was. Onto the opening; I find it pretty bleh, the verse has a pretty bad instrumental and the mixing sounds quite dated. Actually, the vocals overall sound quite dated as well. The brief rock intro was nice, but then it heads straight into “cheap sounding” territory. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**bigbigbee** (9): It's a fun coincidence that the tie in our rate is two super fun pop-rock / pop-punk-adjacent songs. This one spent more ballots in Day 2 than Sakura Kiss, but steadily rose to Day 3 over time. I wasn't sure what kind of opening to expect from such a joke-y / parody anime (I've only ever seen clips, never a full episode) and was pleasantly surprised to find a song that was so, well, pleasant!

#Puppie :3

**Awkward\_King** (10): the fucking dog just appearing behidn him at the end what AJSAJSA

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Delightful. Aw, giant puppy. I trust that purple-haired red-glasses-wearing woman with my life

**TiltControls** (9): BIG DOG! I WANT TO PET IT!

**impla77** (7.6): what is it with all the oversized animals

---

**horridhendy** (10): Ugh, I can’t stand this show but the OP undeniably slaps.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this one is top 10 material

**phonethephoenix** (10): classic vibes! good vocals and instrumentals

**PSSST12** (10): one of the best shonens I fear.

**korobizaka** (9.5): tommy heavenly6 please come back!!!!!!

**allodude** (9): tommy heavenly nuff said

**beeozan** (9): tommy lore is kinda wack like I have to stan having multiple fabricated personalities to release music. popheads would eat up tommyfebruary6's first two albums they're campy disco synthpop which is the unifier of all popheads. this is not campy disco synthpop but when tommy goes "hey baby why" it puts a smile on my face. also slay chorus

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): ended wolf alice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): rina sawayama would eat on a cover of this

**AmandaYoung2083** (8): Love tommy heavenly6

**apatel27** (8): Lyrics as nonesical as the show

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): You know I can’t really articulate what makes this sound better to me that some of the other very standard j-rock themes in this rate but idk it’s just nice!

**cheatviathan** (8): I personally would have picked “Stairway Generation” or “Pride Revolution”, but this still goes off in the way that only 2000s pop punk can. That’s a genre that I will always eat up. The show’s length intimidates me, and the only reason I’m 180 episodes deep into it is because I’m watching it with a friend. It’s his favorite of all time, but I think it’s merely good.

**Dragusken** (8): pretty nice

**macnbee** (8): am i, like, problematic for voting all the english language ones so high?

**MrSwearword** (8): the vocals sell this

**saviorARMY101** (8): a banger

**vexastrae** (8): god i need to watch this anime so bad

**welcome2thejam** (8): This is Bubblegrunge

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (7.8): pray prayer

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**Qwilphish** (7.5): inject into my veinsssss

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): kesha sounds different

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cute little rock song

**ricki** (6.5): this kelly clarkson song

**alexismateofan** (6): Man I don’t even know, it’s fine, I don’t hate it. But it’s not anything more than that.

**Nagisoid** (6): That microphone was in its last legs

**nyoom** (6): the gentleman's 6

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**vayyiqra** (6): power pop ?! pop-punk even ?!

**wujinan** (6): eh

**prettybirbkotori** (5.5): i liked this until the chorus started and then it started to sound weird

**Zypker125** (5.4): [Bernie meme] *I am once again asking for us to rate Gintama OP13, [Sakura Mitsutsuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXpGVuaQwXo), in the future* (as it is arguably the highest-rated anime opening of all time). Anyways, getting back on track. If you go onto MyAnimeLIst (the biggest anime database) and take a look at the Top 50 highest-rated anime, 20 of those entries are from Gintama, which speaks to how well-liked Gintama is, even if it’s not necessarily as popular as some of the other anime on this list. Gintama is known for its heavy focus on meta comedy, parody, and satire of anime tropes, frequently breaking the 4th wall and explicitly referencing anime meta. Its 367 episode length is daunting and puts off many from giving the anime a shot (including myself), but it is quite the journey for those who choose to embark. As for the song itself, I unfortunately find it a little generic, being a standard J-rock song with a pretty standard vocal delivery. The vocal color of the singer isn’t my favorite either, she sounds kinda grating. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**hacatu** (5): I liked it less the more I heard

**maybecrf** (5): im lost, with both this intro and the visual, what is going on here

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I'm glad that balladphobia didn't tank this one - I think it's lovely! Also [this ProZD skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGxCMyLm6js) has been one of my favorites for a while and I only just found out yesterday that part of it directly references this show.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): piano! :3

**phonethephoenix** (10): lovely! great vocals and instrumention

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [Violently sobbing] So pretty, ha ha. Good thing there are only 8 episodes, I bet if there were an episode 9, 10, and 11, they would break me. But there aren't!

**vayyiqra** (10): i love this show it is so beautiful and moving i watched it last summer

**mongeese0** (9.2): Consistent quality throughout the song, like that it didn't try to have the 'one climactic moment' a lot of songs try for

**1998tweety** (9): im crying

**alexismateofan** (9): Just breathtakingly beautiful.

**distressedbeatboxing** (9): Someone described this show like: "a very traumatized girl with a cool prosthetic arm goes through therapy," well I'm sold.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ok, this is going on my playlist

**saviorARMY101** (9): A very beautiful and serene opening song, and btw the art style of this show is GORGEOUS

**Zypker125** (9): There was immense hype for Violet Evergarden before it came out: it truly was one of those “Oscar bait” anime that felt destined for critical acclaim and awards. Based on an award-winning light novel and produced by the most-critically-acclaimed studio in Kyoto Animation, everyone was pumped for Violet Evergarden when it released. Did the anime reach those expectations? That’s certainly debatable, as while for many Violet Evergarden is one of their favorite anime of all time, there’s also a lot of people who felt like Violet Evergarden definitely did not match its hype and was underwhelming. I am of the latter camp unfortunately, as to me Violet Evergarden felt too much like “cry bait” and the story was rather stale otherwise. Now onto the opening: Violet Evergarden’s opening is one that seems to be more highly-rated in the Youtube circles than the r/anime circles, consistently nabbing top rankings in the Youtube group rankings whilst never receiving an equivalent top accolade in the r/anime rankings. It should be interesting to see whether r/popheads will align more with r/anime or YouTube. For me personally, I like it; it’s a very emotional song that’s surprisingly fast-paced, and the instrumentals throughout are amazing. [Prediction: Top 10]

**TiltControls** (8.5): Violet Evergarden sounds like it could be a drag queen name

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8.4): this is actually a sneak peak at what phoebe bridgers is cooking up for her latest masterpiece on interscope records for fall 2023

**Dragusken** (8): beautiful and heartfelt, sincere to a fault

**DutchPeasant** (8): It does hit rather different after the horrible KyoAni arson, which makes this song especially feel far more emotional to me. But even without it, the song is absolutely beautiful.

**nyoom** (8): this would be a 7 if it didn't follow the tokyo ghoul song

**Poydoo** (8): man I love Vinlai Ivapyapday

**prettybirbkotori** (8): very pretty. i prefer the ending but i like this too

**vexastrae** (8): very pretty sounding

**impla77** (7.5): this translation slayed, the smell lyrics that don’t make any sense in English remind me of KH RE:COM so we love

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is such a 7.

**cheatviathan** (7): An impassioned vocal performance and a cool bassline keep my interest while the strings pump away in the background. A solid enough OP for a show that I really need to get around to watching.

**Nagisoid** (7): Nevermind

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Anime loves super orchestrated ballads bit I can't say I'm a huge fan of them

**wujinan** (7): nice outro

**apatel27** (6): Let the strings shine you cowards why is her voice so loud

**BebeLuigi** (6): I loved Violet with all my hearts but the soundtrack was kinda whatever sob

**hacatu** (6): Pretty good instrumental but I don't like the vocals

**MrSwearword** (6): the song is OK but all I really know about this anime is that someone tries to make carbonara but sucks at it because it's a lump with eggshells in it

**Qwilphish** (6): purely from a song perspective its a 6, but this show made me bawl my eyes out

**pig-serpent** (5.5): It's succeeding at sounding large at least.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): never heard of this anime in my life but at least it looks visually stunning

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i remember in primary school learning you had to use sincerely or faithfully differently at the end of letters depending on whether you know the person or not. that shits dumb af

**maybecrf** (4): im biased because this anime is a snoozefest

**ricki** (3): that gave me nothing

**beeozan** (2.8): zzz

**bigbigbee** (6): I have no excuse for not knowing about this show's popularity - it came out during the apex of my anime fandom, back in 2011. I think that this is one that I would like a lot more, had I seen the show (I know, I know, rate the song not the anime...but the thing is that songs tend to grow on you when you listen to them once an episode for 13 - 26 episodes!) This one rose to Day 3 about a third of the way through the rate and toed the line between Days 2 and 3 for a while, but ended the rate in Day 3.

---

**1998tweety** (11): i mean come ON now, get this shit on spotify PLEASE. I went back and forth between this and Again for my 11 but something about this song just itches my brain perfectly. Like the HACKING TO THE GATE into the chorus and then the part in the video i mean come ON i have no choice but to ascend.

**Dragusken** (11): the intentional static in the beginning with the buildup just lets you know this is gonna be a bop

**phonethephoenix** (11): absolutely and truly a banger.

**BebeLuigi** (10): Despite everything... a classic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): boop!

**dooper8** (10): [a close 11]

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is just one of the most effortless epic ops ever

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Bangerrrrrr

**mongeese0** (9.8): Excellent buildup without sounding boring, and the climactic part is great and lasts just enough time

**impla77** (9.3): its giving we live in a society

**korobizaka** (9.3): i havent listened to this in 10 years but wow... goosebumps

**hacatu** (9): Really great opening, the intro sounds suitably mysterious. Conflict of interest notice: I watched like half of this anime, I haven't finished it

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): If I have to hear my brother try to get me to watch this one more time, I'm jumping off a roof

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): really good has aged super well

**apatel27** (8): Starts out promising then meanders out but picks up towards the end

**beeozan** (8): fun fact: I can recognize this song from the first second of static noise because I was obsessed with this show in 2020-2021 and watched it around 8 times all while forcing a different weeb (or weeb ally) friend to watch it with me. For the most part the experiment results were a success and they liked it (even my dad liked it), although I don’t think anyone was as into it as me which is just them being healthy individuals so it makes sense. The song itself I’m a bit iffy about after the incredible intro but the chorus and the latter half of the song pick it up and I can’t really hate the queen of 2000s anisong Itou Kanako. The visual novel opening Skyclad Observer is a 10 but we haven’t *opened our eyes* to that rate yet (nor will we ever)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Part of me wants to calculate my average for the male vocalist songs in this rate vs. the female vocalist songs cause I’m curious, but I really don’t need to expose myself like that.

**Nagisoid** (8): Hacking to the gays? That's what happened to Ariana Grande's website

**TiltControls** (7.5): https://media.tenor.com/Ry-jYCyu2O8AAAAC/mega64-hacking-in-progress.gif

**alexismateofan** (7): Sometimes an OP can just be there to be a vibe.

**Awkward\_King** (7): mikes mic ass anime

**vexastrae** (7): the cybergoth visuals are so 00s coded to me

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): ended caroline polachek

**shhhneak** (6.1): My annual reminder that I need to watch this some day.

**cheatviathan** (6): That chorus is an absolute unit, but that’s all this song really has going for it. Works as an OP, not so much as a full composition.

**nyoom** (6): yeah that's about what i expected

**saviorARMY101** (6): It’s a decent song but it just reminded me of how I fell asleep watching the first episode 💀

**vayyiqra** (6): was in one ear and out the other the first time but eh it's fine

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (6): cyber goth ass shit. y'all telling me THIS is the pinnacle of anime? no, a bunch of cyber goths who logged on just decried it as such. if a bunch of jazz heads got to anime you damn well know you'd hear bebop from womb to tomb

**welcome2thejam** (6): Think I have this anime's game on my PS3 because I heard it was an easy platinum

**wujinan** (6): eh

**Zypker125** (5.6): Commonly considered one of the best anime of all time, if not *the* best anime of all time, Steins;gate is an absolute must watch for anyone entering anime. Subsequently, its main characters are often labeled as some of the best characters in all of anime, and its opening is often labeled as one of the best openings in anime. Unfortunately, I never got into Steins;Gate (its infamously slow-burn first half burned me out and the second half came nowhere close to delivering on what I was promised), and that extends to the opening. The instrumental is pretty bad, it doesn’t really match the vocals, the opening notes are grating, and the loud mixing of the instrumental is annoying. The vocals in the chorus also lack the “full-chested” passion and loudness, causing the chorus to be drowned out by the instrumental. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): it sounds quite nice instrumentally, but the melodies ain’t it

**bogo** (5): not feeling it

**Poydoo** (5): death note

**pig-serpent** (3): I think this OP has roughly the right vibe for the show, but it has never captured my attention musically and I've never remembered what it sounds like despite listening to it at least 30 times by now. 

NINE This show was so cool when I watched it.  The branching paths of time travel had not particularly gained popularity in fiction at the time and this show was a new and refreshing take on time travel.  It was a lot of fun watching the slice of life gradually break open during the first half, then the second half of the show being about undoing everything from the first half.  Also, this may just be in my memory, but I remember Okabae learning to respect Ruka after her arc and it was really nice seeing a transphobic cis character learn to respect a trans woman.  Fuck Steins;gate 0 for tripling down on repeating the same transphobic joke every episode with literally no variation though.

**maybecrf** (1): NO MORE OF THESE NOTHING SONGS angry emoji x10

**Qwilphish** (1): I forgot this was playing

**bigbigbee** (9): Personal soapbox: Reigen should have never gotten so far in the tumblr sexyman poll. He's way too normal to count as a tumblr-specific sexyman. They're too busy shipping old men and calling them baby girls. 

 This song was a comfortable Day 3 song for basically the entire rate.

---

#Counting
**1998tweety** (10): the way the counting is integrated into the song but doesnt feel overdone, the chorus, and the ending??? IMMACULATE song and IMMACULATE show

**apatel27** (10): insert counting up here

**Lynflower680** (10): I never thought I’d be head banging to someone counting.

**phonethephoenix** (10): sooo catchy. i like the driving beat and counting!

**plastichaxan** (10): Songs that feature counting just hit different

**Qwilphish** (10): making a song out of counting to 99 is genius and perfection

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (9.9): oh fuck she gonna count to 99 and then da bomb will asplode!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): no way are they gonna count up to 99...

**cheatviathan** (8): The prechorus goes way harder than it has any right to. Also, it’s a song whose verses are built around a countdown, but unlike that one Gloria Estefan song, it doesn’t grate on my nerves. Still need to watch this one.

**Poydoo** (8): 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 44, 68, 27, 35, 42, 58, 47, 63, 85

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I was gonna say they definitely skipped some numbers but I guess that’s what the full version is for!

**TiltControls** (7.5): one two three four five six seven seven and a half

**indie\_fan\_** (7): the counting kinda drags this a bit sadly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): hey kids, spelling counting is fun!

**impla77** (5): counting is fun

**flava** (4): skipping those numbers like they are trying to cheat at hide & seek

**ImAWeebDuh** (3): uh uh, y’all cheaped out and skipped like 40 numbers

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): its very like okay we get it you can count...

**milkywayinradius** (1): once you get to the number 5 it's no longer acceptable to count higher in a song

**Zypker125** (1): 2 3 4 5 6….. 98 99 100! Mob Psycho 100 exploded onto the scene into 2016 with its unconventional character design and superb animation. This surreal action-comedy anime is quite quirky and insane with its presentation, and while it’s widely acclaimed by the populace, I personally always hated my experience watching Mob Psycho for those reasons, as the surreal quirky nature of its comedy and presentation never appealed to me. Anyways, onto the song. The song definitely reflects the whacky nature of the show, which means I don’t like it. The counting in the song is absolutely unbearable to listen to, the transitions between sections are awful, there’s nothing redeeming about this opening for me. It tries to be overwhelmingly bombastic but ends up just being overwhelmingly tedious. [Prediction: Day 3]

# \#Counting 

**bogo** (10): the ratrick games channel on march 3rd 2023:

**pig-serpent** (8): And the winner of counting 3.0 is... 

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (8): me in tk's ratemas games

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): ended ratemas day 1

**seanderlust** (11): mob? mob? have you worn wigs? mob? mob? will you wear wigs? mob? mob? when will you wear wigs?

**BebeLuigi** (10): Serizawa and Reigen are so gay omggggggggg also the opening is insane obviously

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): oontz oontz

**KuhBus** (10): MOB! MOB! WHAT DO YOU WANT!

**saviorARMY101** (10): I was gonna give this a 9.9 to fit the song title lol but then decided this song is too much of a banger to not give it a 10!

**vexastrae** (10): congrats to reigen and sans for killing the queen

**beeozan** (9.9): see what I did there with the score (please dont let me be alone in this). this is so good despite not being like an actual song with song lyrics. they just count to 99 and shout out random moves from the anime (**SARUTO SUPURASSHU**) and say **YOUR LIFE IS YOUR OWN OK* and it works. can u believe they finished adapting an entire shonen manga without fillers? now that’s what I call crazy. watch this if u want to watch the eeaao of anime. also one final note, when the vocalist sings “maybe you will find your own answer” (exclusive to the full version club 😎) it really sounds like she says ese instead of answer. its funny to me

**evanbrooks324** (9.9): how could I not

**nyoom** (9.5): i have a deep appreciation for songs written so specifically for an IP that they make absolutely zero sense divorced from that context

**alexismateofan** (9): you know what this fits.

**popularsong** (9): lmao i promise im not trying to steal the example joke but while i love the song especially the spoken / yelled parts i dont actually like her vocals that much. not that much that it ruins the song for me just a littttle away from that 10

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): When this wins with a 9 average :o

**wujinan** (8.5): so original

**zadooi** (8.5): Gayle's impact

**Nagisoid** (8): Ended CUUUUuuuuuute by ROSALÍA

TEN I love the message of this show so much.  It's about being well rounded and not using your strengths as a crutch for personal growth or having a personality.  It's about always trying to get better at what you love, even if you suck at it.  It's about redemption; Mob never overpowers his enemies with force because then he's speaking their language.  Instead he always overpowers them with love, compassion, and understanding.  Season 3 has the two perfect villains for Mob to end up facing.  It's just, so wholesome, but still packs in some outstanding fight scenes and has a perfectly well rounded cast of characters, even if most of the girls are sidelined a little more than I would like them to be.

**shhhneak** (7.7): If you gave me 99 tries to guess what this anime was about based on the opening I’d lose.

**pheromenos** (7.5): it's flat and a bop at the same time

**Dragusken** (7): counting the seconds until the song is over

**hacatu** (7): I've heard this is really good but it was a little underwhelming for me

**horridhendy** (7): Keep it CUUUUuuuuuute

**mongeese0** (7): Integrating the subject matter is pretty innovative, buuuut I'm not really a fan of the song. As much as it pains me :')

**vayyiqra** (7): this is riot grrl [citation needed]

**welcome2thejam** (7): I had to block this show's tag back on Tumblr because the amount of content I had to wade through on my dash & in searches was overwhelming

**DutchPeasant** (6): It's unorthodox which is part of its strengths, but also a bit too rough. It's really the visual aspect that is so great of this OP, not so much the song.

**maybecrf** (6): its fine, but i didnt ask for the heart rate jumpscare

**prettybirbkotori** (5): not counting visuals really hurts this song because i just do not like it without them

**sarcasticsobs** (4): ooooh, these guitars are the opposite of hitting the q-zone, and I don't like them with the synths

**AmandaYoung2083** (2.8): Mob is my son but this song doesn't do anything for me

**IIIHenryIII** (1): this math is not that difficult

**ricki** (1): that’s just that one bald guy but with a cunty bob

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Listening to this and realizing that I unfortunately vastly prefer the opening that this band (Claris) sang for the anime called, sigh, "My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute". 

 This song dipped in the middle but came back strong, and Day 3 was not in question at the end of things!

---

**dreamingpastel** (11): Literally so tough to pick one song to give my 11 to, but, in the end, this is it. I think it perfectly encapsulates the overarching themes of Madoka Magica, and I don't think I ever really skipped it when I watched the series. It's also just a really good song. Give the full version a listen if you haven't already.

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): Perfect no notes

**amr** (10): it was one thing for them to go with such a stereotypically shoujo-esque song to throw off any unassuming viewers but they had to go and make it the greatest song in history too

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended lives

**CrystaltheCool** (10): ICONIC MADOKA GOAT

**horridhendy** (10): Love this one.

**Nagisoid** (10): I'm glad this is the ClariS song we rated considering most of her other work is in literal incest anime

**phonethephoenix** (10): shout out to the first anime op i bought on itunes!

**popularsong** (10): ive listened to this song so much ages after the anime lmao. so good

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this shit is FIGHTING in the loudness wars

**Zypker125** (10): Madoka Magica is an anime written by Gen Urobuchi, who is commonly nicknamed “the Urobutcher” due to his surprisingly gruesome and tragic storylines. Urobuchi has written highly-acclaimed shows such as Fate/Zero, Psycho-Pass, and Kamen Rider Gaim (the show that had the most impact on me and completely blew my mind as a tween). Madoka Magica was Urobuchi’s first of his smash-hit shows, taking people by surprise by presenting a cute “magical girls” show before turning into a dark, twisted, and tragic direction. Episode 10 in particular is commonly considered one of the best episodes in ALL of anime, and for my money it’s one of the best episodes across all of television. But alas, we’re not rating the anime here, we’re rating the song here; fortunately, I have a lot of great things to say about the song as well. The lyrics are amazing, the tinge-of-sadness in the vocal delivery hits hard, and the emotional journey the song takes me through is truly a cinematic experience, and I expected to give this my 11 heading into the rate. However, Your Lie In April’s Hikaru Nana stole my heart and my 11 as well, so I have to give Connect a 10. [Prediction: Late Day 2]

**RandomHypnotica** (9.9): she wants to be Sakura so bad

**mongeese0** (9.7): The "chorus" parts are undeniable 10/10. The middle drags a liiiittle bit, but not much

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): :3

**1998tweety** (9): iconic

**alexismateofan** (9): dont become a magical girl worst mistake of my life

**Dragusken** (9): a classic bop, the beginning few lines still hold up and a nice beat

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this rocks

**maybecrf** (9): if youre gonna be formulaic, at least nail the formula

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Everything about this just screams "tricking u into breaking ur heart by the end"

**vexastrae** (9): cute rabbit :) i sure hope they do nothing fucked up :)

**shhhneak** (8.6): It feels like every single song from this rate has people in the YouTube comments being like ‘yeah the opening is cute but this is the saddest thing you’ll ever watch.’ Like okay cool, I won’t then!

**BebeLuigi** (8): My red flag trait is that Homura is one of my favourite character ever

**DutchPeasant** (8): Despite it being a ClariS song, my is this certainly a classic. Somehow everything comes together in a nice harmony. Still is ClariS though, so I could never give it full marks.

**pig-serpent** (8): It's funny that I always skipped this when I watched the show, because it's actually pretty iconic, even if mostly carried by that amazing chorus. 

TEN I really owe this show a rewatch, although I'm worried it will fall out of my top 3 anime if I do.  I know the show is visually stunning and sad and I love Shaft's directorial style, but I'm afraid that I'm mostly remembering being swept up in the shock value.

**saviorARMY101** (8): sounds very pretty but also quite melancholic

**vayyiqra** (8): awesome

**wujinan** (8): this song is incredible

**hacatu** (7.5): Video is a little sus

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6hOgysWIpw

**apatel27** (7): A bit lowkey

**KuhBus** (7): A perfectly unobjectionable opening that will wedge itself into your brain and make you break out into a cold sweat even years after watching it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): https://youtu.be/TrgxHDoe8gA

**bogo** (6.5): is that enough key changes for you

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): look i hate to use the word overrated but there's no better descriptor. it's FINE but if madoka was not popular no one would care about this

**impla77** (6.3): ok but I’m not convinced I haven’t heard this at least 5 times already this rate

**cheatviathan** (6): My favorite anime of all time gets an OP that’s pretty bog standard for an upbeat magical girl show. Within the context of the anime, this approach is absolutely brilliant for reasons I will not spoil. But outside of it, I’m actively searching for other ClariS songs to listen to before this one. The OST and ED both go hard, though. Yuki Kajiura has the magic touch.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): And the award for stupidest key changes goes to

**babadork** (5): I’m getting the impression that this is supposed to be ironically sounding like it is for a kid’s show but it’s actually for a serious show for adults, but I’m spending this entire rate confused about what I should score on a kid show curve.

**beeozan** (5): this feels like the most anisong anisong ever after blue bird by ikemonogatari. like everything is precisely calculated and engineered to make the ultimate anisong. Sho Watanabe who composed this also composed some of the most famous anisongs ever (for example, crossing field is right there in the rate) and ClariS do what is necessary to make the song work. I just dont love it like give me something to latch onto (that something could very well be the show itself but unfortunately I havent seen madoka)

**nyoom** (5): connect me to a different song

**ricki** (5): this is fetish bait, i just saw her panties and i saw her inflated

**TiltControls** (5): oh it just stops huh

**Poydoo** (4): death note

**Qwilphish** (4): These are blending into each other

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): sorry i keep getting paranoid that there's a mouse in my room

**bigbigbee** (7): Same score as in the main rate - if I watched this I would have a crazy amount of nostalgia for it but I guess I was too busy watching yu gi oh with my sister! Still a nice song!

---

1998tweety (10): i mean come on now

alexismateofan (10): I like the Japanese and English OPs equally, like sorry, it’s a vibe.

dreamingpastel (10): ICONIC!! Brings back fond memories of going to Blockbusters and renting the same VHS tape over and over again. And I never got tired of it.

impla77 (10): facts

milkywayinradius (10): they did a good job changing the lyrics and keeping the melody; then that bridge! yessss

nt96 (10): saying never running from a real fight when her ass was BOOKING the first 15 minutes of the show was pure camp

Poydoo (10): I wish I could use my 11 in the bonus rate

TiltControls (10): I never really watched much of the show, but this opening is iconic

Verboten\_Prince (10): Iconic. What else is there to say

Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc (10): yo take me to fox kids thats my safe space. anyways this one also rips.

korobizaka (9): this one feels like cheating because its working off of an already amazing song! but the lyrics are cute

Nagisoid (9): Walkie-talkie kbps ass quality

saviorARMY101 (9): Though I never cared for Sailor Moon, can’t deny this is a classic

nyoom (8.5): who ever gave a single flying fuck about tuxedo mask? who even remembered he existed when sailor uranus walked onscreen? WHO doesn't want sailor uranus in theiranus

PrimaryCrusaders (8.5): This and Dragon Ball are the only ones out of these English themes that are super faithful to the Japanese original.

hacatu (8): Omg this is so precious and wholesome

macnbee (8): ok i'm choosing this bonus song to plug the best openings for (western) animated kids' shows: code lyoko, w.i.t.c.h., teen titans, and GARGOYLES (which doesn't really have a song in the opening per se i just think more people should watch the show)

TakeOnMeByA-ha (8): FIGHTING EVIL BY MOONLIGHT!! WINNING LOVE BY DAYLIGHT!!! NEVER RUNNING FROM A REAL FIGHT!!!! SHE IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR MOON!!!!!!!!!!

welcome2thejam (8): Enjoyed both the Sailor Moon themes

allodude (7): I mean this is just a cover of the original song

bigbigbee (7): Same score as in the main rate - if I watched this I would have a crazy amount of nostalgia for it but I guess I was too busy watching yu gi oh with my sister! Still a nice song!

Dragusken (7): somehow i’ve heard this one more than the japanese one

IIIHenryIII (6): I can see this growing on me if I give this anime a shot

phonethephoenix (6): iconic!!

distressedbeatboxing (5.7): In case you’d rather listen to than read Sailor Moon’s character profile on some wiki.

cheatviathan (4): Sticking so closely to the original template only makes it clearer how inferior this recording is in every facet to the original OP. 4Kids dub unironic banger this is not.

vayyiqra (4): british opening ... what the ... was this the one used in canada? i think maybe ... ? anyway not good vocals

Zypker125 (3.2): Just realized this is in incorrect alphabetical order, lol ~~smh hosts slacking off~~. Anyways, back to the opening; I don’t like it, it sounds pretty washed-out and muted, and it feels very restrained and forgettable.

BleepBloopMusicFan (2): Yeah I wasn’t in love with the original Japanese theme but it’s MUCH better than this.

indie\_fan\_ (2): the way i thought it was couple of kids singing this with the way the vocals sounded, but apparently not. either way, still don't like this

maybecrf (2): sorry, no, next

pig-serpent (1): Kidz Bop!  Your favorite songs, by kids, 4kids

Senn\_Kyu (1): the vocals needed to commit and they did not

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): Weed Circulation outsold

**1998tweety** (9): insert tired snoop dog meme

**distressedbeatboxing** (8): Come on and slam.

**Dragusken** (8): snoop dog version was better tho


#Kero Kero Bakemonogatari

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): For some reason I can easily imagine Kero Kero Bonito covering this

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it sounds like it could be one of the few KKB good songs

**nyoom** (6): kero kero bonito soundin ass

**shhhneak** (1): Kero Kero Bonito DUPE

---

**DaswefSayLazy** (11): platinum disco vs renai circulation is impossible to choose

**horridhendy** (11): Iconic. This catchy little bop is instantly enjoyable. If you’ve seen the anime, the lyrics make total sense and it’s just so fitting for this arc. I had this stuck in my head for weeks.

**Poydoo** (11): Wow, this song is so good! I hope nothing horrible happens to her later in the show!

**Awkward\_King** (10): this feels like taking marshmellow edibles and ascending

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m smiling!

**hacatu** (10): Simply iconic

**imasalesman** (10): the fact this isn’t my 11…..

**maybecrf** (10): when it's right, its right

**pheromenos** (10): ICON

**pig-serpent** (10): A song designed to be as moe as possible while being a weird combination of several styles and never sacrifices its musical complexity.  One thing I really love about the Monogatari music is that many of the instruments feel like they were pulled from different places, but every instrument is a layer of the character they're representing.  When all of those instruments come together, it showcases the many layers of the character singing, and this is a great example of that.  

ELEVEN The Monogatari series gets a bad rap, and like, I get it, but it's still my favorite anime and favorite TV period.  The characters all have an amazing amount of depth and every little interaction with every character leads to learning more about them.  The philosophy of the good arcs can actually be really deep, and has had me pondering aspects of life I never had before watching it. The artstyle is very fun and works for telling a story that is mostly just people talking to each other, as well as I love highly stylized direction in general and it leads to shots that are far more beautiful than what most studios are putting out.  The banter is just fun to read even if 90% of it goes over my head as an english speaker.  It sucks that NISIOISIN has such a bad sense of humor sometimes that justifiably puts a lot of people off, but I found it to be so worth pushing through for everything else in the show.  But also, sometimes I like that it feels like the show doesn't want me watching it and is actively trying to get me to stop watching.  It's endearing.

**popularsong** (10): sooo cute and sweet

**PSSST12** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSLMfxjUC/

**Qwilphish** (10): when it's right it's right

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): never watched this anime but I've listened to this song and covers of this song so many times over the years

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (10): platinum disco outsold but this can still smash idc

**vayyiqra** (10): somehow i know this well and it's a cute little ditty

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is lo-fi hip hop house

**beeozan** (9.6): a song here partially for its meme/novelty status, is it silly? Yes. But under the cutesy vocal delivery (and failed attempts at rap) from HanaKana lies a full on jam I can't make the tuba not bop!!!!

**mongeese0** (9.6): I mean...you don't get to be that big of a meme without being insanely catchy

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): ended the circulatory system

**bogo** (9): aw this is such a cute theme i hope the anime this is from is as wholesome as this

**cheatviathan** (9): The vocals are cutesy, but not in a grating way, and those horn stabs and muted guitar leads are irresistible to me. I can definitely see why meme culture gravitated towards this one, and years of listening to meme mashups have not tainted this one for me. Also, that bridge certainly takes a turn, and I am absolutely here for it.

**dreamingpastel** (9): If you ask me what "moe" means, this is what I'll point to

**korobizaka** (9): one of my karaoke songs

**Nagisoid** (9): Did y'all know "Seno" means breast in Spanish?

**saviorARMY101** (9): this is such a cute and wholesome song, I’m sure the show will be as well 😍🥰

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i have never heard anything about this anime outside of this song, i am lowkey convinced this anime doesnt actually exist and was invented out of thin air just to promote this song

**vexastrae** (9): this is so girlypop to me <3

**ImAWeebDuh** (8): oh this is that tiktok sound

**ricki** (8): can you believe that im nostalgic for early tiktok days… how low have i fallen

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Kyute

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Now why are you gonna make me rate the meme song

**impla77** (7.8): its giving fashion icon

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): ok there are so many better monogatari ops but this one is good

**TiltControls** (7.5): aw this is really cute.

**BebeLuigi** (7): I am begging listen to the other openings and especially Kogarashi Sentiment greatest song ever made

**CrystaltheCool** (7): Very cute, always cheers me up.

**KuhBus** (7): fluffy, airy, like marshmallow for the ears and eyes.

**macnbee** (7): unfortunately slaps

**RandomHypnotica** (7): vague cutesy vibes

**DutchPeasant** (6): Probably the most overplayed song of the list for me where all the memes using it did not help. Regardless, it's a cute song with a fun trumpet, nothing too extraordinary though.

**JIRACHI** (6): the english cover lowkey outsold

**phonethephoenix** (6): i do like the middle of this song. it is on the whole kind of cloying though

**indie\_fan\_** (5.5): i typically don't dislike cutesy type music for anime but i don't really have strong feelings about this one

**alexismateofan** (5): Even for someone who loves bubblegum pop as much as me, this was WAY too fucking sweet sounding like goddamn.

**Bisonsouro** (5): is cute

**saturnribbon** (5): I like the production but not a fan of the vocals

**welcome2thejam** (5): Oh, it's this song! Tbh it doesn't have much outside of that part, but what a part that is

**babadork** (4.5): It did not occur to me until I reached this song that there would probably be a lot of songs on this rate that sound like they’re sung by children, which is terrible news for my rate average.

**Zypker125** (3.5): The Monogatari Series is one of the highest acclaimed series of all time, relying on unconventional audiovisual presentation styles and whimsically unique dialogue/convos to drive its episodes. Renai Circulation is the OP4 for Bakemonogatari, which is pretty uncommon in this song rate as it’s mostly populated by OP1s. That speaks to the popularity and acclaim that Renai Circulation has received over the years; it won r/anime’s 7th Best Opening tournament bracket, as a dark horse win. The song is a cutesy talk-rap, combing hip hop with a “moe moe kyun kyun” blast. However, I can’t say I like the mixing of elements, and I’m just not a fan of the singer’s extremely-cutesy vocal color and the low-key energy of the song. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**apatel27** (0): The grip this has on the weeb community will forever baffle me. Outside the fact there's better monogatari openings, the uwu voice is really annoying (Kana Hanazawa is one of the most overrated seiyuus of all time fight me), the beat is really repetitive and annoying, and it goes nowhere.

**MrSwearword** (0): absolutely fucking not, this cutesy shit irritates me

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This is a real banger - it really grew on me throughout the rate. I love the buildup. I really hoped, at the end, that this could crack the top 10, but sadly, it wasn't possible. Of the sister series, Baccano and Durarara!!, this one ended up falling short. (visuals geekout moment: I LOVE the ensemble cast opening style of both of these.) Check out /u/nt96 's raveDJ mashup for this song, as well; it's excellent.

---

**1998tweety** (10): banger

**DaswefSayLazy** (10): tough to choose between this and renai circulation for my eleven

**macnbee** (10): oh this one is LEGIT

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm surprised it slapped too

**nyoom** (10): STRAIGHT BANGER

**phonethephoenix** (10): it's catchy!!!!

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is basically a dismemberment plan song from the japanese timeline. anyways durarara!! is super important "dark period" adult swim saturday block shit. like this show got to just exist at that time where saturday nights bled ratings and this was like the ONE thing 3 guys at adult swim were able to agree "i guess people will watch and we can pay SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than actually idk getting utena". someone can tag me and reply trying to explain why i should watch this show. im not opposed! but I feel like i gotta go back in time to fall 2011 to watch and savor this

**welcome2thejam** (10): The one rocked. A lot of songs in this rate so far have big intros, slow a bit for the verse, and then come on strong for the ending. Starting with just the drums and building up definitely makes it stand out positively

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): these intros are so fun just to watch. im sure one day ill get around to actually watching anime but for now these intros are so well animated and stimulating and colourful. i love it

**alexismateofan** (9): One of the OPs you don’t skip because the music is so banging and popping.

**hacatu** (9): Unique, good vocals

**nt96** (9): https://rave.dj/hgnZQEWrIuob0Q

**plastichaxan** (9): Why does the first second sound like We Rock from Camp Rock

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): One of the first anime I ever watched and the first I ever fell in love with. The OP bangs. Shizaya is gay heritage. No I will not be elaborating further

**wujinan** (8.5): as beautiful as the day I first heard it

**BebeLuigi** (8): This is SO sad cuz this is by far one of Durarara's weakest opening/ending yet it's so solid

**dreamingpastel** (8): (drums start playing) SEE THE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN TH- Wait. Wrong song

**indie\_fan\_** (8): INDIE ROCK ESSENTIALS

**KuhBus** (8): stylish and cool as hell

**mongeese0** (8): Thought it was interesting how (upfront?) the vocals were compared the backing track. I liked it. Side note: I'm getting a little sick of all these openings freeze-frame introducing characters. be a little more mysterious or something idk

**pig-serpent** (8): Is this show just Baccano set during the 90s with swagtastic rock music instead of jazz?

**saviorARMY101** (8): Haven’t seen this show yet but it’s a banger

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (8): an anime not as good as baccano

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): what exactly makes a sunset treacherous

**ImAWeebDuh** (7.5): teetering on the edge of being annoyed with his voice but the good side won out in the end

**Poydoo** (7.5): death note

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): i can never figure out what this show is about. good song though

**beeozan** (7): the little sister of baccano and a very similar opening style that's like "look at Ryougo Narita's ensemble cast" - the song itself is quite different though. Trying to figure out what kind of band name is Theatre Brook but I guess that's the thing with band names. And yeah the song is aite i honestly have very little thoughts on it

**cheatviathan** (7): This certainly has a swagger to it that few of the other rockers in this rate have. I can vibe with this.

**Dragusken** (7): edgiy drives into the sunset

**Nagisoid** (7): Protect your vocal chords!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): please tell me im not insane when i say the beginning of this song is literally identical to we got the beat

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): I bopped my head

**maybecrf** (6): not my taste, but it works

**korobizaka** (5.7): not even the best song featured on durarara

**Zypker125** (5.6): Durarara, along with Baccano, are the two quintessential “ensemble cast” anime, both of which were written by Ryogo Narita. While Baccano was only 13 episodes, Durarara was a hefty 62 episodes in length, allowing for further exploration of storylines and perspectives. Durarara’s opening credits 15 characters, all of whom have decent screentime from which to see their perspective, which is both a selling point and a criticism of the anime (ie. some people argue that *too* many perspectives to the same event are shown and make the pacing extremely sluggish as a result). While I like the visuals of the opening and the fun way all the characters are introduced, I’m not a fan of the audio, it feels a bit repetitive and I dislike the vocal color/tone of the singer. [Prediction: Day 2]

**vexastrae** (5.5): eh

**apatel27** (5): When this first came out it was one of my favourites then drrr op2 came out and it's just kept shrinking since then

**TiltControls** (5): I think I'm even more confused watching this opening

**vayyiqra** (5): this is post-punk revival which i like but with vocals i do not like

**Qwilphish** (4.5): wasn't giving for me. im sorrryyyyyy

**IIIHenryIII** (1): that was boring

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Attack On Titan Abridged washed 

 An anime whose reputation precedes it - I was annoyed by the fandom during the early hype days of this show (~2013) and so never checked it out. (And there were MANY fans - as some raters mentioned, this was a huge crossover hit with people who are typically not anime watchers). As a consequence, I completely missed all of the discourse surrounding it, which ultimately I think was a net benefit for my life. 

 This song was a genuine Top 10 contender in the early days but settled around this placement for most of the rate, which I think makes sense considering the fairly strongly divided opinions on it.

---

# Attack on Burgers

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Sind sie das [burgers] nein wir sind der [Onika] 

**Awkward\_King** (6): attack = onika titan = burger


# The Rona Taking Psyching Damage Section

**indie\_fan\_** (9): thinking about that reveal trailer that had the anime/drag race rate fakeout

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this deserves to suffer for all the anime fakeouts TK inflicted

**welcome2thejam** (5): The revenge for making us watch that clip in rate reveal trailers starts now

**TiltControls** (4): bonus points for providing so much fakeout content for the past 4-5 cycles before this one. rip a legend you will be missed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): look i know we’re not supposed to let our personal opinions on the anime in the rate cloud our judgement from the songs themselves, but for attack on titan in particular i physically cannot do that. fuck this antisemitic, anti-korean, genocide defending, imperialist, ugly ass animation show, the theme song itself isnt bad but there’s no song in the universe thats good enough to make up for the fact it’s attached to one of the most genuinely horrible animes to ever exist. also @ ratcom STOP USING THAT SCENE IN THE RATE CYCLE REVEAL TRAILERS ITS BAD AND MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!

---

**ImAWeebDuh** (11): this is objectively a bop, why are y’all hating

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now. one of the BEST animes ever (even though the fanbase is highkey very annoying especially the pro-Eren fanboys).

**agnes\_honey** (10): EPIC

**apatel27** (10): overhated. It's big anthemic and angsty, an anime opening style that's been forgotton as of late

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Perfection

**dreamingpastel** (10): Song of a generation (2013 weebs)

**evanbrooks324** (10): this will always be THE AoT opening for me

**impla77** (10): I may have watched some aot asmr videos.. (:

**KuhBus** (10): THIS is how you do a motivational song about killing shit!

**mongeese0** (10): The first 5 seconds alone did their job, and the rest of the song backs it up. It has several different parts/tempo changes, and they all are incredible.

**MrSwearword** (10): it fits the anime it's made for

**Narhun** (10): All AoT songs are absolute bangers

**phonethephoenix** (10): tbh i don't want this to win but this opening is iconic for a reason!! epic and catchy

**pig-serpent** (10): I've never had any interest in watching this anime but it's easily the most hype anime opening I've ever heard in my life.

**popularsong** (10): i hate this anime with passion but this song is undeniably epic and iconic

**PSSST12** (10): We need extra 11s 😭😭😭 This is History. This is Peak. Everytime I hear this, in the words of Ajayii "I don't know where the fuck I am going but I AM GOING"

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I feel like I could run through a WALL

**saviorARMY101** (10): SIESINDDASESSENNEIRWIRSINDDIEJÄGER!!!

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): even after years of not listening to this... it still hits I fear

**shhhneak** (10): Obsessed with the final season happening for like 4 years now.

**vayyiqra** (10): my friend showed me a bit of this show i didn't get it and all i know is something about fighting giants and allegations the creator is a crypto-fascist which sounds cursed but this is pretty epic nonetheless

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): ITS THE HYPEST THEME OF ALL TIME! IT'S THE ANIME THAT IN THE MID-2010S CROSSED OVER WITH THE BASEBALL AND JOCK KIDS WHO WERE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANIME BUT HADN'T BEEN HANDED SUCH A MIDDLING ANIME WITH A BANGER INTRO! FORREAL FIRST SEASON SUCKED ASS BUT SECOND SZN ON TOONAMI IN 2K17 DID RULE. AND THIS THEME FUCKEN SLAPPED! IM LIFTING ALL DA WEIGHTS 2 DIS DITTY! GIVE ME DOSE BLAST BEATS AND BIG JUMPS!!!!

**Zypker125** (10): Ah, Attack on Titan ~~The Final Season - The Final Chapters (Part One)~~. Even people who aren’t into anime know about Attack On Titan (or they live under a rock). The timing of this rate is kinda fun because it’s scheduled right before the *final* part of the *final* chapter of the *final* season is scheduled to release, *finally* bringing a conclusion to the Attack on Titan anime. Attack on Titan is in a weird stage now where it’s now widely known for its infamous source/manga ending, with many comparing it to Game of Thrones in terms of “finale bastardization”. Whilst the prolonging and dragging-out of the final season has caused me to fall off the AOT train, I still remember the highs of watching the AOT show, as it is a pretty amazing show at its peak. The first opening of AOT’s first season is a great kickstarter to the most popular anime of this decade, providing an epic cinematic experience that makes you feel pumped and hyped for what’s to come. Its anthemic instrumental and vocal delivery differentiate it from other anime shows and sets the tone superbly. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**DaswefSayLazy** (9): this show is more interesting to read on the wiki than to actually watch but the opening is good

**horridhendy** (9): Not personally a fan of SnK but I have to admit this OP is a classic. Such a hype intro.

**macnbee** (9): wtf i love martial law now

**nt96** (9): the industrial strength gorilla grip this had on my fellow college peers

**saturnribbon** (9): I’m a slut for anything with an orchestra in it

**Bisonsouro** (8.5): Still iconic, regardless of what came after

**nyoom** (8.5): now we just need a cameo from mario

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): God this one is epic! I love the orchestral elements mixed through it.

**seanderlust** (8.5): it slaps but I'm docking points for attack on titan

**alexismateofan** (8): One of a number of OPs that even if you never saw the show or haven’t kept up with anime in years, you probably recognize. That opening like 5 seconds is undeniable and it’s REALLY hype

**allodude** (8): iconic

**BebeLuigi** (8): my reputation as an elitist will take a hit but this does slap

**cremeebrulee** (8): ended nothing

**CrystaltheCool** (8): This one really gets the blood pumping!

**Dragusken** (8): a classic that misheard anime lyrics would have a field day with

**korobizaka** (8): still a banger 10 years later

**Poydoo** (8): death note

**prettybirbkotori** (8): it's a classic and it fucks (roselia cover better tho)

**wujinan** (8): nostalgic banger

**Lynflower680** (7): SIND SIE DAS ESSEN NEIN WIR SIND DER JÄGER

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): i hate attack on titan but this opening is iconic like the first 10 seconds... that is perfection.

AnimeOPsRate: 
**cheatviathan** (5): I mean, there are some interesting turns this track takes, but the overall production just sounds too cluttered for me to get into any of it. The sound effects are just extraneous filler that detracts from the stuff in the foreground.

**bogo** (4): just like the series itself this is way too over dramatic for its own good

**Qwilphish** (4): honestly never got the hype for this intro, the visuals and the song aren't doing much for me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): not the electro-zeuhl number

**IIIHenryIII** (3): I have only watched 5 whole animes my entire life, so I’m not one to trust, but this one is so overhyped. I honestly don’t get the appeal. That maneuvering equipment is dope though. And this song is whatever.

**maybecrf** (3): a buffet of nothing

**plastichaxan** (3): I’ve seen so much about this anime but the intro too straight for me

**ricki** (2): this is so heterosexual

**beeozan** (1): TikTok-ification of symphonic rock. Having 2 hype moments in what is basically the limpest symphonic rock song I’ve heard doesn’t save it. I wish the German narration added like some flavor but honestly it's just corny (derogatory). I also wish we could’ve rated Boku no Sensou for this show but I get why it had to be this. Needed the alternate universe where this show flops entirely and sneaks no songs in tbh

**Nagisoid** (0): This is the kind of music that would play at Straight Pride rallies. Iconic misheard line: "HAVING THE SEX WITH THE BEES AND THE EAGLES"

**vexastrae** (0): playing this in germany should get you arrested

**bigbigbee** (7.5): For a long time at the end of the rate, this song and its sister series Durarara were going out one after the other, and so I'm mildly peeved at Attack on Titan for splitting them up. And actually, for most of the rate, this was lower than Durarara - I guess the jazzheads won out in the end! 

 P.S. Isaac and Miria are couple goals, just be very stupid with your SO and cause chaos 

 P.P.S something that happens in this anime traumatized me real bad when I was 15

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): ended r/indieheads

**flava** (9): TAKE ME DOWN TO PARADISE CITY

**vayyiqra** (8): this isn't paradise city but i'll take it ! (vayyiqra: tank! was the blueprint for jazz-inspired themes [citation needed]) (crimsonroset: no youre right)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Take me down to the Anime City where the weebs are mean and the dubs are shitty!

**TiltControls** (7.5): TAKE ME DOWN TO THE PARADISE CITY?!? WHERE THE GRASS IS GREEN AND THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY?!?

**Nagisoid** (7): Take me down to the paradise city!

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Take me down to the paradise city, where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): r/indieheads when they need to pull a funny shitpost before they reveal the top 2 in a rate:

---

**1998tweety** (10): this is pure cunt

**Awkward\_King** (10): realising i just like all the openings that sound like lisa simpson is tearing that saxophone tf up

**hacatu** (10): Very unique, really sets the mood

**imasalesman** (10): genuinely one of the best shows and OPs to exist

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/CgKbFSJ74lAkXw

**nyoom** (10): LET'S GOOOOO

**popularsong** (10): the intro seconds alone are worthy of a 11 but it just keeps going. amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (10): bitch they did not name a character JACUZZI SPLOT

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (10): this is the godfather for people who's shawshank redemption is prison school

**Zypker125** (9.5): Ah, Baccano, *the* quintessential ensemble cast anime. Despite the anime only being 13 episodes long (each episode being only 25 minutes), the show boasts 11 main characters, and the opening credits 17 significant characters in the story. Baccano juggles the act of balancing so many main characters through having multiple storylines from different time periods, all interweaving with each other at various points whilst still maintaining an overarching plot. The opening does a great job at setting the tone for this anime, being a jazzy sax-focused instrumental with clear theming towards early-1900s America, the setting of this anime. The opening has a ton of style and is extremely fun. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**cheatviathan** (9): There are a lot more jazzy instrumentals in this rate than I was expecting. Not as catchy as the others, but still an enjoyable vibe regardless.

**DutchPeasant** (9): Bebop's OP may be considered as the most popular jazz OP, but if we're talking about iconic it has to be Baccano. Such a fun and lively jam, how can one possibly not enjoy the whims of jazz.

**macnbee** (9): rent was DUE for the bassist

**phonethephoenix** (9): it's a nice song!!

**wujinan** (9): i love jazz

**impla77** (8.6): ngl, that opening trailer actually made me wanna watch this

**beeozan** (8.5): *don’t rate the anime rate the music don’t rate the anime rate the music* well here we have one of my favorite anime ever and this opening is tied to it very deeply but I just know I wouldn’t be giving an (almost entirely) instrumental jazz cut a 10 if I randomly heard it somewhere. Now more facts about Paradise Lunch who are apparently an all female jazz big band whose only single is this song and don’t have a Wikipedia page even in Japanese (googling them in Japan local duckduckgo resulted in me finding what I presume to be a hotel called Paradise&Lunch) so it’s crazy to think how they just happened to make this banger and like 3 more songs and (as far as I know) call it a day. They also have a vocal version of this song which I won’t score for the purposes of this rate but I think they fit quite well so check it out on Youtube, it's certainly an interesting take on the song at the very least. 

 Anyways watch Baccano! EVEN if you are animephobic (exaggerated term for all my rater besties who aren’t as degenerate as me <3) this show has a great dub and takes place in 30’s America on a train called Flying Pussyfoot like I’ll leave the rest of it to your imagination! (also it is a rather quick binge at 13 episodes 24 mins each as anime usually is)

**alexismateofan** (8): you know what more anime OPs need? Jazz.

**apatel27** (8): I wanna say it's a 10 but the Tank influence is so big and obvious I just can't

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Would be a 10 if there were words

**Dragusken** (8): jazz vibes intensify

**dreamingpastel** (8): LET'S GO SAX!!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): if Televisa made anime:

**KuhBus** (8): A track that screams for a singer to lend their voice to it.

**MrSwearword** (8): just enough to sell the show it's for

**pig-serpent** (8): It's Tank at home, but like, Tank still sounds good reheated. 

SEVEN Baccano is a fun show but there's nothing past the surface other than having fun watching badass characters do badass things.  I'm still not entirely sure what the point is.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Okayyyy come thru Mr Epic Sax Man!

**saviorARMY101** (8): a great jazzy and upbeat opening theme that perfectly sets the mood for the show

**seanderlust** (8): is this the one where they change the opening credits sequence based on what happened last time? if so that's really cool. if not, this feels like a really specific opening sequence

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I love Asia's idea of American-core

**vexastrae** (8): wait youre not lupin the 3rd ...

**Poydoo** (7.5): death note

**ImAWeebDuh** (7): jazzy lil tune but wow that punctuation is aggravating

**welcome2thejam** (7): Found the winner of the indieheads anime rate

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): this is fun but some of those horns in the middle are CRUNCHY kinda hurts my ears

**BebeLuigi** (6): I was always a durarara kind of guy...

**DaswefSayLazy** (6): pretty good but i have a feeling it will go out early

**korobizaka** (6): its not tank!

**amr** (5): ambient head 6 jazz club edition

**JIRACHI** (5): was waiting for someone to start singing i felt like ajay in that selena gomez video

**ricki** (5): ok

**shhhneak** (4.1): we have Cowboy Bebop at home

**plastichaxan** (4): The way I’ve never heard something called guns n roses be good, not the band, not the lana song and definitely not this

**Qwilphish** (3): I like this instrumental.... but really no vocals?? Is there no budget this time around

**maybecrf** (2): this sounds like the background track of a bad mario kart track.

**bigbigbee** (6.5): [redacted anecdote] 

 One of the bigger crossover hits of the past five years or so (though I have to mention as a nerd that it's been around for much....MUCH.....longer!) Basically the only time that this wasn't Day 3 was...right after my ballot, lol. Sorry! I like it more now than I did then - those horns do a lot for me. And that animation is just SO stylish, sleek, and incredible.

---

**babadork** (10): I’m mostly here for the jazzy songs.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I thought I might end up being real basic and 11’ing one of the few songs I knew before the rate, but no I found something new I like more! Sorry JoJo!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): groovy jam

**korobizaka** (10): if i could pick two 11's this would be the other one. CODA's voice is so fun! also when you understand the last part with joseph screaming... yeah

**maybecrf** (10): never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**Nagisoid** (10): I hate JoJo's with a passion but you can't deny the boppery

**pig-serpent** (10): Always my favorite JOJO OP, this song is just a blast of funky energy, on top of being super catchy and always having some nice fills to mix up the song.  I wish there were more anime OPs that sounded like this. 

EIGHT Jojo is just the right level of stylized and over the top for me to get invested in a shonen.  I'm in love with how much of the show is just "aha, but you didn't notice that I covered you with grenades while we were talking to each other!"  Btw, 2>5>6>3>4>1

**PSSST12** (10): Fighting gold is still their best theme and a 12 Candidate but this will do

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): counting the anime sound effects to this score

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): kinda insane how jojo consistently produces some of the greatest anime ops ever, crazy noisy bizarre town would probably steal my 11 if it was in this rate

**vexastrae** (10): cunt servers (megan thee stallion) recognize cunt servers (jojo's bizzare adventure)

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is "dub", not THAT kind of dub but "we added based sound effects dub". oh and its jojo! god i do love the insanity of this one!

**hacatu** (9.5): It's always the ones you least expect that are really good

**ImAWeebDuh** (9.5): oh these gay(?) bitches ate

**1998tweety** (9): ate

**apatel27** (9): if this is tanked for the sfx on the Youtube video there's gonna be blood

**Dragusken** (9): changing za warudo one chorus at a time

**mongeese0** (9): Actually not as energetic as I remember, but still really enjoyed the melody. Go get em ham boy

**seanderlust** (9): British people who hate the environment walking through nature be like

**welcome2thejam** (9): Such a dazzling flair to it

**AmandaYoung2083** (8.5): Imagining that picture of James Charles as Pesci rn

**bogo** (8.5): please be normal about this song

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): i'll admit this is good but you will never make me watch jojo

**allodude** (8): CAESARRR

**cheatviathan** (8): Through pure cultural osmosis, I know a lot about this show despite not seeing much of it. The memes are too powerful, man. I do slightly prefer “Crazy Noisy Bizarre Town” and “Great Days” to this. However, this is a funky, immaculate vibe that gets my head bobbing every time. Should I be bad and skip parts? Because the first two episodes of Part 1 did nothing for me.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): That animation was questionable but the song isn't bad

**DutchPeasant** (8): Wait a minute, this isn't Sono Chi no Sadame!!! Well it's hard to go wrong with any JoJo OP to begin with, as this certainly goes hard. Nevertheless, Coda does lack the power to really make it work well.

**horridhendy** (8): Docking a mark for the annoying sound effects but otherwise, this is pretty great.

**nt96** (8): https://rave.dj/xn4LkawQtYTMTw

**nyoom** (8): the aesthetic is impeccable

**ricki** (8): how do you serve cunt under the male gaze

**saviorARMY101** (8): a bangerr, and probably one of best animated opening sequences I’ve ever seen

**vayyiqra** (8): za worudo or something idk all i know about this show i picked up from memes. theme is pretty cool sure. (pretending i know a lot about japanese culture) aha yes rather shibuya-kei [citation needed]

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is for the gays and theys

**wujinan** (8): I like the other jojo ops better

**phonethephoenix** (7.6): i do like the vocals!

**Awkward\_King** (7): my only knowledge of jojo is virgins making references to it! good for them though <3

**macnbee** (7): where's that post that's like: i don't watch anime. luckily, JJBA is just gay porn

**Qwilphish** (7): camp (positive)

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Just what da hell is going here in this opening?

**TiltControls** (7): why do I know so much about this show without actually knowing anything about it

**beeozan** (6.4): this rate is kinda popheads bizarre adventure when u think about it

**plastichaxan** (6): Everything I’ve seen or read about this has been against my will

**alexismateofan** (5): oh my god soundeffects. SO distracting from the song. Unfortunate because the song is a banger, but i need to take people’s sound effect boards away.

**Zypker125** (4.6): Jojo’s is an anime known for having STYLE (just look at those character designs), and this opening is definitely a great representation of it. However, I feel like this opening is mostly supported by its strong visuals and styling, and I think the audio isn’t pleasant to listen to on its own, which is what we’re supposed to be grading. The loud sound effects definitely detract from the listening experience, even if they enhance the visuals of the opening. I also find the music…. Rather generic? The visuals of the opening really carry the opening for me here, I don’t think the song would have been memorable to me otherwise. [Prediction: Day 2]

**shhhneak** (4): this is how I sound 4 margaritas deep at karaoke.

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (4): jojo is the persona 5 of anime in terms of how i want their fans to shut the fuck up

**Poydoo** (3): Jojo 🤢 + sound effects

**IIIHenryIII** (1): not good at all

**bigbigbee** (10): I knew that femdom was really having a moment when this show got popular. P.S. "he just like me fr" is one of my favorite images of all time 

 We generally tried to avoid adding songs that are this recent (late 2022), but Chainsaw Man was simply too popular for this to be excluded. Who knows - it's possible that this is this high due to recency bias as well. But maybe not, because my god, does this song ever slap. I can't stop listening to it lately. And the opening animation is something special, as well. If this is the thing to drag me kicking and screaming back into my anime phase, at least it will be well deserved.

#I looked him up. He DOES look cool

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): kenshi yonezu i am sexually attracted to you

**dysphorbs** (11): i feel like i cant praise kickback enough. its legit the only anime op ive ever had on a regular playlist, kenshi yonezu's voice is on point, and its just got this fantastic hectic energy. i might be biased bc ive been a fan of his since his hachi days but i think the 11 is well deserved

**apatel27** (10): Kenshi Yonezu is main Japan pop boy for good reason

**cheatviathan** (10): Congrats to Kenshi Yonezu for making an OP that is every bit as batshit as the show it was written for. That bassline, those sporadic guitar leads and organ riffs, the out of nowhere orchestral bridge. It’s a unique sound palette that Kenshi’s vocals fit perfectly.

**CrystaltheCool** (10): GRIND! FUTURE! BEAUTIFUL STAR! I love Kenshi Yonezu.

**korobizaka** (9.8): my mom, 60 year old japanese lady, has stockholm syndromed me into loving kenshi yonezu so everything he does is a masterpiece to me. but really this song is so unexpectedly good and fits the anime well

**beeozan** (9): omg it’s a song I submitted to the Popheads Jukebox! Kenshi and Daiki united to give us this singular bop and then idk what they have been doing since (Daiki made a song with Sheena Ringo for Hell’s Paradise, unfortunately he decided he should compose the song over THE Sheena Ringo, big mistake) but is that relevant when this high octane banger is so good. I’ll be chanting DORYOKU MIRAI A BEAUTIFUL STAR in the Queup when this goes out at number 12 and then we will listen to *Souda! We're Alive!* by Morning Musume

**popularsong** (9): dont really get kenshi yonezus hype but this is an undeniable banger

**Dragusken** (6): i love kenshi but nah…kick that back to the abyss

**1998tweety** (10): this kinda devoured ngl

**Awkward\_King** (10): this FUCKS

**bogo** (10): i can see why this was #1 in japan for like a million weeks

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): rawk

**DaswefSayLazy** (10): this opening is so fucking good

**DraculaWeekend** (10): No idea what was happening but this popped off

**evanbrooks324** (10): this will definitely become a classic

**impla77** (10): Me when describing Leatherface:

**KuhBus** (10): Insane, abrasive energy in the best way possible.

**Lynflower680** (10): Thank you PopHeads for reminding me to start Chainsaw Man.

**nyoom** (10): i heard there's a gross disgusting girl who doesn't bathe in this? they're so real for that. i showered today but i didn't want to

**Qwilphish** (10): the visuals, the vocals, the instrumental. everything on point

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this sounds like an anime in the best way possible

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGER!! I feel like this song perfectly encapsulates the chaotic and gritty nature of the show while still being upbeat and enjoyable

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): unrelated to the score but god bless this song for slightly increasing awareness for morning musume even if hellopro did absolutely nothing to capitalize on this

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (10): the smasha... i love the random electro bloops in with this its so slay to me!!!

**vexastrae** (10): the only manga where >!the protagonist gets hit with the trauma beam then immediately gets over it by giving himself a lobotomy!<. iconic || update 2023/06/13 new manga chapter of all time just dropped. [happy pride month](https://twitter.com/D_Kumii/status/1668639281101824002)

**phonethephoenix** (9.9): this would be 10/10 if I like the Todo/mirai/beautiful part a litttllleeee more. banger! love the bass and overall instrumentation

**mongeese0** (9.8): The baseline immediately got me interested, and the rest of the song was absolutely crazy. One of the few times a song (and visuals, won't lie) convinced me to watch a show

**alexismateofan** (9): oh man i loved when that man chainsawed.

**TiltControls** (9): one of the few songs I know here purely because it showed up in the jukebox last year

**welcome2thejam** (9): Dope track

**wujinan** (8.5): convinced that even if this wasn't an opening it would still be a hit

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (8.3): the bass line here is so fun

**amr** (8): feels awful to not give a perfect score to my favorite animanga of the past couple of years but that's what they get for making my son aki hideous for no reason

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Damn they didn’t lie that is a literal chainsaw man.

**macnbee** (8): hey, that's pretty good

**Narhun** (8): holy shit what is this anime

**pig-serpent** (8): I feel like it captures the manic energy of the show without going so over the top that is scares normies away, which is also true to the show tbh.  

TEN I was a manga reader, so this was my most hyped anime, possibly ever, and It really did manage to live up to my high expectations.  The only complaint I can think of is that the artstyle is too good.  I loved the scratchiness of the manga and I unironically wish the show looked worse but had the same quality of animation.

**Poydoo** (8): cool

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Oh wow, he actually is a chainsaw, wasn't expecting that. I trust the devil-horned woman with my life

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): That slap bass work in the intro is fucking SICK

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Me over here with no knowledge of Chainsaw Man whatsoever: Hmm… okay

**maybecrf** (6): it got me to the message, but it just didnt sound good

**prettybirbkotori** (6): this show is like an anime nepo baby like i'm sure it's good but there is no way it got there naturally. anyways the song is fine but generic. fitting

**vayyiqra** (6): this show looks absurd and cursed but kind of into these beats here at least the hihat goes crazy

**xavieryes** (6): another one that keeps swinging between being great and terrible

**babadork** (5.5): On first listen, this was in zero territory, but it grew on me.

**Nagisoid** (5): I feel like I should like this more... weird eclectic alt j rock stuff is usually my jam but this bores me. I don't know, it feels like they used like five different sample packs randomly and told someone to scream over it with no rhyme or reason

**Zypker125** (5): The latest smash hit anime to hit the streets, Chainsaw Man’s anime was hyped for *years* prior due to its source manga being extremely popular and highly-rated, spurring immense hype when the anime was announced. Chainsaw Man has a different ED for each of its episodes, so if we ever do an ED rate, it should be fun to see the CSM representation; but alas, let’s switch back to talking about the opening; I personally never really got the hype. The song nor the visuals never really appealed to me, the screamo(?) chanting is unpleasant to listen to (especially in isolation), and the chorus doesn’t kick into high-enough gear for me personally.

**BebeLuigi** (4): we wanted bocchi instead

**IIIHenryIII** (3): this one is just an ugly noise

**DutchPeasant** (2): Just a mess of a song, coupled with it sounding rather generic and to top it all off a bad voice to listen to, certainly not my jam.

**flava** (2): Bruce Campbell outsold

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (1): been trying to figure out to score this one for ages since seeing the intro when Corona told me "we're rating this". While this anime is pretty, it also looks absolutely fucking terrible in a baffling "oh shit i gotta watch and/or read THIS" way that I'm too busy to get into. I just genuinely cannot rate this cut that is itself, made for the 90 second intro MO; it sort of seems to barely function as a song, but more a series of verses that happened to get stitched together that some very talented animators + editors then attempted to make their anime theme. I think they tried very hard, but unfortunately something was off in a way that made me had to drop da 1

Lynflower680: There’s this series called Romantic Killer on Netflix and it’s super cute. Plus it’s 12 episodes so it’s an easy watch. I recommend it if you like romance anime. So far it’s my favorite watch this year alongside Chainsaw Man but I do plan to start other series soon so that might change.

**bigbigbee** (10): Just missing our top ten, here's a classic 2000s anime, Code Geass! Well deserved - this song is amazing and never fell out of Day 3. 

 Random side note: throwback to Produce Camp China, an idol survival show...a Russian dude who just wanted to be a translator ended up being forced to compete on the actual show, and he actually got mega far, despite LITERALLY at one point asking people not to vote for him. Anyway that guy called himself "Lelush" on PURPOSE, so I think that he deserved his fate

**mongeese0** (9.2): Definitely feels like an archetypal shounen anime song. Hadn't heard it in a while - I don't remember the anime fitting this vibe at all though heh

**DutchPeasant** (9): After all these years, its upbeat sound hasn't waned a bit. It's a triumphant song, but even more than that it also alternates the song quite a bit to keep it interesting.

AnimeOPsRate: **impla77** (7.2): damn these bitches have long legs

**alexismateofan** (7): It’s funny when you know enough OPs, you can tell when anime was released just based on how the music sounds.

**beeozan** (7): one of the two artists who snuck in two songs in this rate, this is the cut Flow deserved! Watching Code Geass is like being insulted by a bunch of scriptwriters but at least they had this song to make up for it (until they changed it for the 2nd cour, big mistake). The song itself works quite well with the guitars playing a rather melancholic melody in the back but with the vocals, the drums and the horns (?) being very anthemic.

**bogo** (7): utada outsold

**cheatviathan** (7): The best FLOW song in this rate has an iconic intro, and one of the better guitar solos in the rate. The prechorus melody also gets stuck in my head fairly easily. Not my favorite OP they did (“DAYS” and “Re:member” outsold), but still pretty damn good.

**maybecrf** (7): its a solid opener, but side note what the fuck is going on in this intro 💀

**sarcasticsobs** (7): I trust the crying green-haired woman with my life

**vayyiqra** (7): really not what i expected knowing what i do about this show but cool rock on

**MrSwearword** (6): the pacing is boring but these man vocals sounds great

**nyoom** (6): this sounds like an anachronism—like a bleach op instead of a code geass one

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**ricki** (6): they look like giraffes with these long legs and necks

**Zypker125** (5.8): This song is frequently very highly rated in YouTube song rate rankings, often making it into the Top 20 of any “Best Openings of All-Time” rankings, although it hasn’t fared as highly on the r/anime brackets. Should be interesting to see which direction this song performs. For me personally, I never got the hype for this song; the song simply never grabbed me and I don’t feel engaged with the song at any point. I think I just don’t jibe with the mixing; the somber-feeling vocals are mixed with a happy-sounding instrumental, and so the song overall lacks direction and a concept for me. [Prediction: Top 5]

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (5): I had a very long comment typed out and unfortunately lost for an indieheads GD a few months back when I finally finished code geass. Basically to put it short: I think this is probably a top 5-7 anime of the century so far. The show bizarrely keeps aging very well and I think a lot of that is the result of its absolutely batshit, bipolar pacing. There are like 3 to 5 programs, tones, and genres of television in an average Code Geass episode (war mecha! royal family backstabbing soap opera! high school comedy! spectral fiction fantasy! and uhh all around surreal experience), and a lot of emotions are repeatedly excavated in the span of 22 minutes than can range from deeply bleak displays of violence one episode, to C.C. trying to get pizza and flop around in a hysterical follow-up half hour. Whatever the studio was doing with this program, they seemed to understand the misery of lines blurring and contexts collapsing amongst the litany of high schoolers they'd drawn up; almost all of which were deep in some shit. The show's politics were bleak. The main character legit sucks (in a good way) and the show repeatedly tells you "this guy sucks (in a good way)" and somehow stuck the landing through the 52 episodes of 2 seasons. I felt fucking sated finishing this and like I actually got something out of television that American animation & broadcast live-action had failed me with. Nothing I'd ever seen had been so good at displaying bipolar tones in a scripted format and letting the audience have fun with it while pondering just how bad shit could be if these contexts collapsed. the show is, to put it nicely, perfection. &&&&&&&&&&& every other Geass intro is personal a ten (and I do love watching C.C fly around at dat one point) BUT this was always my least fav part of the opening 13ish episodes. Why dat horn? Why dat vocal delivery? Why THAT tempo? mb is this was like a key lower or higher I'd fuck with it more. The four on the floor is integrated super well and a huge piece of hype, but this was not the show's strongest part. i just finally had to display somewhere that I did see code geass, and was deeply moved by actually accomplishing its objective as a piece of media

**pig-serpent** (4): This song starts hype then gets really boring.  Like, this is the most generic j-rock I've ever heard. 

THREE Code Geass is a show that wants to seriously talk about the horrors of war while being nothing but "war = fun action scenes."  I was having fun with it, even when cracks started to show mid season one with the Mao arc, but the twist towards the end of season one is legit the worst moment of any TV show I've ever watched and it made my opinion of the whole show plummet from the sheer contrived stupidity.  I'm old enough to be well past the phase of my life where I get mad at people who write bad cartoons but this twist genuinely made me angry.

**bigbigbee** (7): The Yu Gi Oh dub washes the original in every single way, it's not even funny. It's, in my opinion, a literal perfect example of the art of translation / adaptation - they were trying to make a show for kids (literally 4Kids) and it worked! 

 Sure, the Yu Gi Oh abridged series had a hand in how much I love it to this day, but the abridged series had excellent material to work with. Also Seto Kaiba is literal goals, if I transitioned I would want to be like Seto Kaiba

---

allodude (10): YOUUR MOOOOVE

cheatviathan (10): I went to see Yu-Gi-Oh: The Movie in theaters when I was like six, and I had no idea what the hell was happening the entire time.

CrystaltheCool (10): IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DUEL

DaswefSayLazy (10): ddddddddddddddddddddduel

impla77 (10): this is like those doe eyes to siren eyes transition

maybecrf (10): its time to d-d-d-d-d-duel is probably the most iconic line in dub history

nyoom (10): YOUR FUCKING MOVE

phonethephoenix (10): straight banger

Poydoo (10): oh damn

RandomHypnotica (10): its camp

shhhneak (10): I’m sawry to compliment 4Kids but this gives me that buzz!!

TiltControls (10): god the d-d-d-d-d-d-duel part is 11 worthy

Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc (10): thinking about that episode of the rugrats spinoff "all grown up" where they made fun of yu-gi-oh card collecting with the "you gotta go" series. this is real music btw in case we were wondering.

1998tweety (9): instrumental ethnic slay

alexismateofan (9): If we didn’t have that ‘It’s time to duel’, this would be a perfect 10. Rest in peace Kazuki Takahashi you did great work.

Narhun (9): this song pops up into my mind at random times at least once a month

nt96 (9): that D-D-D-D-DDDDUEL line sent me back to my elementary school years

Qwilphish (9): it doesnt hit as hard on episode 150 but it is a classic

saviorARMY101 (9): BANGERRR

BleepBloopMusicFan (8.5): The du-du-du-du-duel part adds at least 2 points by itself.

Bisonsouro (8): Thank you for the Rate! It was my first one and I had a lot of fun!

Dragusken (8): it’s mostly instrumental but goes to show, compared to the other ones, that less is more

Nagisoid (8): Iconic but maybe not that good as a standalone piece of music. You have to consider The Culture

pig-serpent (8): Wait I forgot how hard this song slaps.  I still know basically every note by heart.

ricki (8): hyperpop

vayyiqra (8): utterly silly narration but ignoring that because the track itself is kind of awesome

indie\_fan\_ (7.6): it's TIME to d-d-d-d-...do-do-do-do-do-d- duel!

bigbigbee (7): The Yu Gi Oh dub washes the original in every single way, it's not even funny. It's, in my opinion, a literal perfect example of the art of translation / adaptation - they were trying to make a show for kids (literally 4Kids) and it worked! 

 Sure, the Yu Gi Oh abridged series had a hand in how much I love it to this day, but the abridged series had excellent material to work with. Also Seto Kaiba is literal goals, if I transitioned I would want to be like Seto Kaiba

IIIHenryIII (7): it had potential to be epic

LesApfels (7): D-D-D-D-D-D-DUEL!!

seanderlust (7): it's time to dududu...dududududududuudududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududududu

Senn\_Kyu (7): 4kids has the TV size ver blocked in my country so I'm basing my score on the full size, surprisingly good though not as much of a bop as the italian opening. but not everything can be eurodance perfection

welcome2thejam (7): Oh, that's what the plot of Yu-Gi-Oh was about? Huh.

hacatu (6): Can you just link Brooklyn Rage instead? This is embarassing. The opening narration caused my life functions to stop (in a bad way), but "It's time to d-d-d-duel" is so iconic that I came back to life

milkywayinradius (6): yami is daddy

sarcasticsobs (6): I trust Dark Magician Girl with my life

distressedbeatboxing (4): This is the ideal karaoke song.

Zypker125 (3.5): IT’S TIME TO D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DD-D-D-D-DD-D-D-DUEL (Also, this opening was much more of a nothingburger than I remembered it to be)

TakeOnMeByA-ha (3): why does this kinda sound like kirby boss battle music

Verboten\_Prince (3): Wait this sound like literal nothing I was expecting some epic du-du-du-du-ddddddueling

1998tweety (10): absolutely iconic

alexismateofan (10): don’t care fight me in the comments i will take challengers.

allodude (10): can't wait for the ED rate where we rate every PokeRap

BleepBloopMusicFan (10): I MEAN. You cannot deny that the English language snapped at least this one time.

bogo (10): how am i supposed to catch them all if game freak made it literally impossible

cheatviathan (10): This theme is iconic, and the reason why I was always excited to watch this show on VHS as a kid. I do slightly prefer the Johto Journeys theme. But this is still a certified hood classic that always goes on when I feel like being the very best, like no one ever was.

DaswefSayLazy (10): of course its a ten, you know this, we all know this, shoutout my boy sandshrew

DraculaWeekend (10): Who would give this less than a 10

dreamingpastel (10): If I could give this an 11, I would.

hacatu (10): When people make claims like "All I want for Christmas is You", I have to laugh because it's ACTUALLY this song right here

imasalesman (10): ICONIC

impla77 (10): i will eat a pokemon if this doesn’t win the bonus rate

indie\_fan\_ (10): I love how passionately Jason is here singing fictionally catching some imaginary cartoon animals. It's corny, overdramatic, and exactly how an anime song should be like. With that being said... I want to be the best there ever was. To beat all the rest, yeah, that's my cause.

krusso1105 (10): I can't wait for this to beat the highest ever score for a bonus song

LesApfels (10): I mean come ON

Lynflower680 (10): I mean duh

macnbee (10): in high school someone told me michael jackson sang this song and i literally believed them

maybecrf (10): very obvious 10, beyond just nostalgia, its just beyond

milkywayinradius (10): this song is just too good

Nagisoid (10): If this doesn't win force me to voiceover a raunchy Pokémon fic

nt96 (10): the most iconic theme ever and put it in the bonus. Rip you could’ve dominated PH records 😔

phonethephoenix (10): fun to sing too, can't give it any less

Poydoo (10): of course

PrimaryCrusaders (10): I mean, what more can I say, it's a classic. I haven't watched a single episode and yet I still know all the words. If this wasn't a bonus rate this would instantly get my 11.

PSSST12 (10): This is a 20 stop playing 😭😭 Would have won the main rate

Qwilphish (10): this transcends everything in this rate

sarcasticsobs (10): Finally some good fckning food

saviorARMY101 (10): A CLASSIC

seanderlust (10): i mean come ON! a classique

Senn\_Kyu (10): one of the two bonus songs I have actually heard before and it still slaps

shhhneak (10): She is THE blueprint. From the very first second you will know this song. It set the bar and no other anime has ever compared to how iconic this is. Even Pokemon continued to chase the dragon, they sampled this opening a couple more times and straight up just did a cover for the Kalos season. I hope Jason Paige has handsome residuals for life.

TakeOnMeByA-ha (10): lord please let me 11 this

TiltControls (10): but when are we rating bdg's 30 minute perfect pokerap presentation

vayyiqra (10): an awesome theme it's cheesy but it's hard not to get hype from it and that's what music is supposed to do ! i had a kind-of friend in high school who thought it was the dumbest thing ever but he was wrong !

Verboten\_Prince (10): I mean

Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc (10): if you DM me or politely ask, I will personally share "Pokenomics" with you, an absolutely batshit AP Econ project that I laughed so hard I cried the first time i saw it. one bro who filmed it refused to show up to school bc he was so embarrassed, not realizing he had just starred in the best thing a bunch of high school seniors saw all Spring semester. PROFITS GOTTA CATCH EM ALL!

welcome2thejam (10): Oh, to be a ten year old child exploring the world with my team of pocket monster besties (For the record: Ampharos, Totodile, Hawlucha, Charizard, Krookodile, Slurpuff)

Zypker125 (10): All rise for the national anthem. I would give an 11 or even a 12 if I could. I’ve really wanted to submit this song to a charity rate for quite some time, hopefully I’ll get the opportunity soon.

agnes\_honey (9): the anime hit

AmandaYoung2083 (9): In the face of such strong competition this one just doesn't measure up

bigbigbee (9): We didn't put this in the main rate cause it would have won by a mile and that wouldn't be fun!

distressedbeatboxing (9): It’s no Pokemon World but it’ll do.

Dragusken (9): it’s close to being the very best

Narhun (9): This isn't my favourite pokemon intro, but god it is just too iconic to go any lower on.

pig-serpent (9): I can’t listen to this song without thinking of “try to sue us now, pokemon!” and I’ve never even liked Smosh.  But like yeah this song is obviously good of course it’s winning.

IIIHenryIII (8.5): this has nothing to do with nostalgia, this song is actually good even though the recording sounds off

nyoom (8): johto outsold

RandomHypnotica (7.8): overrated af

ImAWeebDuh (7): digimon ended

---

**prettybirbkotori** (11): perfect song for a perfect anime i fear

**TiltControls** (11): this is camp and wins the 11 for being everything I wanted from this rate

**zadooi** (11): Showstopping. Beautiful. Brilliant.

**1998tweety** (10): Great song and great anime.

**apatel27** (10): This is labelled French Indie on google

**beeozan** (10): BOOM BOOM BOOM DANCING THROUGH THE SKIES! the visuals of the only AMV I ever made comes from this OP with its banger dance section (roxie what did you make me do) but the song in general is just such a funky bop i have to ten. I watched the first 2 episodes of Death Parade and stopped there for some reason but it’s okay because this song is thankfully up on Spotify so I can just listen to it there instead of watching episode 3!

**distressedbeatboxing** (10): Based on what everybody’s telling me, I’m in for a bad time if I take this OP at face value.

**Dragusken** (10): EVERYBODY PUT YOUR HAND UP

**dreamingpastel** (10): Every time this song comes on, it's suddenly a dance party

**DutchPeasant** (10): It's a crime that we got so little Bradio songs for anime, especially with how big of a hit this one was. Having songs where you can dance to are an absolute commodity, but ones that are this good? Bradio absolutely delivers.

**KuhBus** (10): the juxtaposition between this beautiful, energetic opening (which is also gorgeously animated) and the actual anime still haunts me.

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/55Aj6IshwjEIEw

**popularsong** (10): so good it made me watch the anime lmao. bradio in general just release bangers only, i love red car chase, chocolate flavor, hit parade...

**PSSST12** (10): STOP MISINFORMATION

**Qwilphish** (10): SO MUCH FUN!!

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): rona you got me to watch this so I wouldn't be pissed by whichever shit you didn't choose instead. I mean it worked lowkey. I love the intro because none of this shit happens in the show. they never have a dance party! we have downtime episodes and some brilliant moments of humor between the arbiters, but this is so hysterical for how much it fucks with what Death Parade is lol

**Zypker125** (10): This opening won r/anime’s 4th Best Opening tournament bracket, which is the most participated-in Best Opening tournament bracket of all time (with 3.7k participants). It was the 10th seed, so it was somewhat of an underdog win. It definitely has style, being a rock fusion with some clear disco elements fused in. The upbeat and festive nature of the opening is a stark contrast to the anime itself, which is much more dour and melancholy (as it focuses on, you guessed it, death). I’m a huge fan of this song; the high notes throughout this song are heaven to my ears, the Boom! Boom! Boom! pre-chorus is incredibly catchy, and the fun energy of this song is overflowing. [Prediction: Day 3]

**mongeese0** (9.7): Did not remember this theme at all. Genuinely a good enough song to listen to outside of anime, blown away

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this is just such a slay concept for an anime

**alexismateofan** (9): Actually slaps.

**Around-town** (9): I've heard that the anime and song do not match at all, which is fine by me because this song slaps

**Awkward\_King** (9): okayyyyy. why this sound like brendon urie

**bogo** (9): finally a man puts his whole man pussy into the vocals

**Lynflower680** (9): This is so upbeat for a show called Death Parade. I love it.

**pig-serpent** (9): Extreme dance pop banger.  The best part of every Death Parade episode! 

ZERO This show had no idea what made its premise interesting and constantly made the worst decisions possible.  It continued to frame the games as if they mattered after telling us they didn't, even to the point where they forgot to explain why they chose who made it to reincarnation in at least one episode.  The back half of the show decided that we needed to know the audience surrogate's backstory for some reason and it made the last 5 episodes hell to watch because her backstory literally didn't matter to anything happening with the story or themes.  If I had a youtube channel where I made 2 hour "show you like is garbage" videos, this is the first show I'd choose.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): just pure seratonin

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I just think all dramatic shows should have disco theme songs (also see Eva)

**welcome2thejam** (9): That intro just charmed me. That said, even if I'm going into this rate mostly blind, this is probably the first opening on the list where I have utterly no clue what this show could possibly be about

**impla77** (8.5): I’m assuming the actual anime is not as upbeat as this opening??

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): ended superorganism - flying

**BebeLuigi** (8): The ending is like phenomenal next level tho

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Oh this is cheesy but I’m having fun!

**cheatviathan** (8): Some well-executed falsetto vocals, a killer groove, and those horn hits hit all the right places for me. The part right before the second chorus where it’s just handclaps is awesome, as well. Just a fun bop all around.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): corny chorus but vocals good

**phonethephoenix** (8): is kind of anthemic!

**wujinan** (8): wow!

**nyoom** (7): not a bad summery bop-type thing. i hate this show

**saviorARMY101** (7): I love how upbeat this song is even though this show is literally about death lol

**vayyiqra** (7): kind of a jam

**babadork** (6.5): This might have done better if I had rated it in one of the batches that I wasn’t watching the videos for, because it had me expecting disco or at least more of a bop

**maybecrf** (6): its a jam, but you gotta bring more to the table ijs ijs

**MrSwearword** (6): groovy sound, bad singing

**Nagisoid** (6): If I hear another lazy disco song I'm going to move to Paraguay with Doja's haters

**sarcasticsobs** (6): I swear this is the easiest thing to tune out, I listened like 5 times before giving a score

**vexastrae** (6): ngl i dont like the vocal inflection on this

**IIIHenryIII** (5): meh

**plastichaxan** (5): Ricki said this sounded like Brendon Urie and I took off an entire point

**Poydoo** (5): This guy's voice is annoying

**ricki** (5): brendon urie

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This anime has always been sold to me as "omg the saddest thing ever" and I just don't believe that that's true. However, this song is really, really nice! A well deserved Top 10 finish. I love a good duet.

---

**Zypker125** (11): Here we have another one of the “cry bait” anime classics of the 2010s. Unlike the other ones on the songlist, though, Your Lie In April received extremely high scores/ratings and was commonly regarded as one of the best anime of all time. Since then however, I believe the overall reception of the anime has gone down notably (definitely one of the anime that has held out the least well throughout the years), with particular criticism given to the way it treats depression and how the physical violence the main character receives is played off for laughs. I am firmly in the ‘negative’ camp for YLiA, as I do feel like it terribly mishandled its themes and sent bad messages overall. However, the overall consensus on YLiA still remains very positive even if there is a vocal minority against it. We are rating the opening SONG, though, and it’s an absolute banger. I almost always tend to prefer “a group of vocalists singing a song > “just one person singing a song”, and Goose House (the singing group of this song) was mixed-gender AND had a wide variety of vocal colors/tones to boast, elevating a great song to perfection. The group harmonies and vocals in the chorus and post-chorus are amazing, and listening to each vocalist bounce off each other line-by-line is a lot of fun. This song evokes so much joy and happiness every time I play it, with the opening notes being whimsical nostalgic magic. This song just makes me happy, and so I’m happy to give this my 11. [Prediction: Top 10] (copium)

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**agnes\_honey** (10): this is a masterpiece

**apatel27** (10): Goose House you legends

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Goose house.

**cheatviathan** (10): I could talk about how each vocalist contributes something interesting to the piece, and the way they harmonize on the chorus is ungodly. I could talk about how the guitar and horn leads make me happy. I could talk about how I think YLiA is a good but not great show. But honestly, this is one of the only songs from this rate that affected my personal life. See, my brother and I would light fires on our patio with music playing, and talk music, life, work, etc. When I introduced this song to him, he loved it so much that it became his standard last song of the night before putting the fire out. Isn’t it funny how the most unforgettable scenes can be so trivial?

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended bcnr

**Dragusken** (10): the chorus feels like a grand chorus

**DutchPeasant** (10): Goose house is an absolute treasure of a band, bless them forever.

**impla77** (10): where are their nipples

**Nagisoid** (10): So happy I bet the anime must be some wholesome slice of life show where nothing bad ever happens

**pheromenos** (10): now if this was an anime endings rate...

**phonethephoenix** (10): I have to give this a ten because I set it as an alarm for an entire year in college and didn't even get tired of it. so catchy! great refrain

**prettybirbkotori** (10): so unbelievably good 100% will go down as a classic

**Qwilphish** (10): great im crying again

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): kinda obsessed with animes that have the most joyful song in the world when the actual content of the show will give you irreversible depression

**vayyiqra** (10): shoutout rona for payola-ing this to me and making me like it well in advance of this rate your strategy worked

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): really like the new BCNR direction

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): If I was told the duet was probably the best song in the rate, I would have not believed you

**mongeese0** (9.4): seems like the gold standard of duet style ops

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): me and akane making our top 2 fakeout:

**alexismateofan** (9): The whole thing felt so grand and majestic. Just big and beautiful, and a lot of love went into it, you could tell.

**BebeLuigi** (9): I never watched this I have to admit but I always loved that song

**saviorARMY101** (9): Feels very wholesome and uplifting

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hell yes rater meetup at the goose house

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): Music!!!

**CrystaltheCool** (8): if you can't sing this at the top of your lungs are you even a human person?

**vexastrae** (7.5): very cutesy and feel-good, as a shoujo anime OP should be

**bogo** (7): it's may

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Giving choir singalong vibes

**wujinan** (7): good but eh

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): its may

**nyoom** (6): alarmed and deeply concerned by the sheer number of anime openings involving a shot where children are naked

**pig-serpent** (6): This is a really bright and sunny song for a crybait anime.

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**beeozan** (5.5): this is an alright song that I don’t love but at this point I think there is an element of me not caring about all this emotion they put with their harmonizing and stuff cuz I think about the show afterwards and just go “meh”. But not like I was a huge fan of the song during (or before) my watch either so I think it's just not my thing

**hacatu** (5): Bland

**maybecrf** (5): are we excited by this? what are we doing here

**bigbigbee** (6.5): And with that, we've officially broken the 8.0 barrier!! This show is incredibly popular with the 9-12 year olds of the city in which I live. I see that green guy on a T-shirt at least once a month.

---

# Love Us Some (LA)LISA (part 2)

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I could go with something more appealing to my personal tastes, but come on. The power of LiSA is undeniable. In terms of technical skill, of drama, of sheer awesomeness, none do it better than this

**apatel27** (10): LiSA main anime OP girl for a reason

**Dragusken** (10): yes, lisa, slayyyyyy that demon

**dreamingpastel** (10): LiSA is probably my favorite artist who provides songs for anime, and this is a clear reason why. She has such an amazing voice, and the instrumental doesn't hold back either.

**horridhendy** (10): Another great opener from LiSA, queen of anime OPs.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I take 10X psychic damage every time lastfm redirects me from LiSA to Blackpink Lisa

**shhhneak** (10): If (when) this rate gets greenlit for a spinoff we need a LiSA vs Aimer mother-off.

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): LiSA has her whole style but like. it does work!!

**cheatviathan** (9): Okay. This goes off. The way the verses build into those choruses is a lot more enthralling than I remembered, and LiSA kills it on the vocal front. I’m sure I’ll circle back to this show eventually. I liked the first three episodes when I saw them in college.

**prettybirbkotori** (9): i had no idea this song was from demon slayer. anyways lisa can do no wrong

**Nagisoid** (8): I want to see if anyone will confuse this for BLACKPINK's Lisa that would be so funny

**popularsong** (7): ngl dont get the hype at all though lisa's vocals are amazing. the first take version is somehow better, i feel like her vocals just need to sound raw for it to hit

**wujinan** (7): LiSA's voice gives me life

**AmandaYoung2083** (2.4): LiSA's worst

**beeozan** (2.3): A song they played in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics show! Anyone else gets really bugged by the way Lisa sings the last syllable of every line in the chorus? Just me? Ok. Otherwise a meh pop rock tune. They really didn’t put any effort into the second verse, maybe cuz it’s an anime opening (woah!) I can still call them out idc

---

**agnes\_honey** (11): i listen to this almost everyday

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): This one goes hard!!! Excellent mix of metal and J-pop in this one! Such a bad-ass theme song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): we are seated we are ready this is cinema

**bogo** (10): being boring and giving this a 10 cause it's the only anime i've actually watched

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this rules

**PSSST12** (10): This The one. an 11. Singled handedly made Demon slayer the biggest show of its generation I fear 😤 Watching this show for the first time and this op immediate SNATCHED me

**saturnribbon** (10): one of the best intro songs in the last decade imo

**saviorARMY101** (10): THIS SONG IS A FREAKING BANGER!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): tbh the best song ever….

**korobizaka** (9.9): goosebumps every time

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (9.9): i am being informed this cut and anime is "not gay". it also misspells grunge.

**impla77** (9.2): okay guitars!!

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**IIIHenryIII** (9): slay

**KuhBus** (9): you think you're in for another softly sung opening and then you're slapped in the face with drums and guitars in the best way possible.

**Lynflower680** (9): The guitar goes so hard

**welcome2thejam** (9): A straight banger

**alexismateofan** (8): Hype!!!! Oh this is a good OP, music leaves you HYPED for the anime.

**babadork** (8): I don’t necessarily want to listen to this, but I could imagine someone hypothetically choosing to listen to this.

**macnbee** (8): so the og link for this was removed (copyright strike?) and i was planning to make a comment like: youtube was trying to save me. but no, it's actually good.

**Qwilphish** (8): When the guitar comes in at the end :chefskiss:

**vexastrae** (8): pretty neat, ill have to watch the anime eventually

**vayyiqra** (7): feel like i'm going to be overusing this phrase a lot in this ballot but the drums and guitar together kind of "go crazy"

**Zypker125** (6.4): Demon Slayer is the latest “smash hit shounen” action anime. While it’s extremely popular internationally, it’s actually even MORE popular in Japan, as Demon Slayer is bar-none the most popular anime in Japan right now, with people of all ages watching Demon Slayer in Japan. Demon Slayer is known for its explosive and colorful animation, backed by well-acclaimed studio Ufotable. Gurenge is also one of the most viewed/streamed anime openings of all time, despite being released only 4 years ago. The opening itself is unfortunately rather formulaic to me and it’s not catchy enough to escape its lack of innovation (I feel like I’m one of the only anime fans who don’t get the supposed hype/catchiness of the chorus). The verses are pretty good at times, though. Also, obligatory “Zenitsu annoying” [Prediction: Day 2]

**nyoom** (6): very disappointing that the main characters aren't both girls like i thought

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): i wasnt slayed

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): This is fine but there’s absolutely nothing memorable about it.

**hacatu** (5.5): Boring

**pig-serpent** (5.5): I've heard this song so many times and have no thoughts on it whatsoever.  It might as well not even exist.

THREE The most overrated show of all time, anime fans will ever get non weeabos to take anime seriously as long as this garbage is the first thing people are being shown about anime.  It has some of the worst shonen pacing, especially at the end of season one where it stretches 2 episodes worth of content into 6, but even before and after that the beautiful animation is too infrequent to be worth watching whole ass 25 minute episodes for the 10 seconds of it we get.  On top of that, the characters are annoying.  Zenitsu is probably my least favorite anime character ever, Tanjiro is every goody two shoes shonen character with no personality outside of his singular motivation, and Inosuke is mostly fine, but he's a good example of just how loud the show is.  Everyone is constantly yelling or crying at the top of their lungs and it's like: guys, shut up already.

**Poydoo** (5.5): death note

**DutchPeasant** (5): Whilst the part at 0:47 is very nice, all in all it's a rather generic OP, chorus especially.

**ricki** (5): okayyy i see you with that little green checkered chanel poncho

**MrSwearword** (4): again with this blasted attempt at rock sound, but at least whoever sings this sounds like they can sing

**maybecrf** (3): sometimes you just do too much, and the background rock was just much too much

**bigbigbee** (9): The animation reminds me of those felt animals? Sylvania? those things would financially ruin me but I do want them 

 This song was ALWAYS high-placing-Day 3, and it deserves. Jazzy, but stands out even among the jazz openings because of the great vocals on top of it.

---

# Mentions Furries

**Awkward\_King** (10): this goes SO fucking hard for a jazzy furry track. like okay fantastic mr brass

**ImAWeebDuh** (10): how are furries so talented

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): maybe furries can have some rights

**macnbee** (8): maybe the furries are onto something...

**plastichaxan** (8): My Quay Dash furry dancers video is shaking a bit

**prettybirbkotori** (7): furries ate this one thing

**saviorARMY101** (7): song kinda bops, too bad it’s for a f*rry anime 🤢


# Mentions Zootopia specifically

**Zypker125** (8.5): Beastars is basically Zootopia, except with more dramatic plot points that stretch it out into a TV show. ~~Furry nation let’s go~~ This opening is oozing with style. The jazzy direction of the music, combined with the hip-hop verses and celebratory chorus vocals, is an absolute treat and sets it apart from most anime openings. Not that we’re including the visuals, but the use of stop-motion gives this opening a further sense of identity, which I think also helps give the song a sense of identity. While I think the vocal section is really great, the talk-rap section isn’t really my cup of tea. [Prediction: Day 3]

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I love Zootopia

**welcome2thejam** (7): So who took their Zootopia fanfic and pulled a 50 Shades?

---


**babadork** (11): I like all the jazz themes, and this is my favorite of them. I like a good pastiche, but this is a little fresher.

**Lynflower680** (11): AND THAT’S CALLED JAZZZZZZ

**alexismateofan** (10): one of the few OPs I actually have on rotation in my spotify this song slaps. GO OFF LEGOSHI!!!!!

**apatel27** (10): Let's swing. Jazz Rap is the best anime opening genre

**bogo** (10): car seat headrest could never make a song that slays this hard

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Idk about this anime but damn the opening was good

**flava** (10): what the actual fuck did i just watch

**hacatu** (10): The anime is fine but the opening is exceptional. Conflict of interest notice: I've seen this anime

**KuhBus** (10): wonderful, seamless switch in moods

**milkywayinradius** (10): i'm a sucker for any song with horns; uwu

**MrSwearword** (10): see this is the weird shit I signed up for

**Nagisoid** (10): No don't speak French you're so cute haha

**nt96** (10): this is Jamiroquai-coded

**pig-serpent** (10): My freshman year of college I went to a halloween swing dance dressed as Wirt from Over the Garden Wall and even with the lesson I absolutely sucked at it and never went back.  This is the type of song that makes me want to actually learn how to dance with other people and go out in public and dance with others. 

NINE Beastars is the only show I'm aware of that takes time to think through the reality of a society of anthropomorphic animals, and it's incredibly deep and very uncomfortable.  It was everything I was looking in for an anime... until the mob arc happened and the show went full shonen by having a high schooler beat up 30 gun wielding gangsters with his fists.  Most of the show is still incredible but it sucks that it had to break the immersion like that.

**Qwilphish** (10): COME ON NOW! the stop motion plus the jazzy instrumental. This song stands out in this rate in the best way, when the beat switches up in the middle it makes you want to move!

**saturnribbon** (10): I forgot how good this one is!! It’s so playful but with a hint of something more

**seanderlust** (10): and that's called jazz!!!!!

**TiltControls** (10): god that piano line

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): yo the animation fucking rules here! this is some crazy japanese boy fusion funk that just wants to belt it out! it doesn't even really have claim to a genre or idea, this 90 seconds is just jammed packed chorus splicing. i love it!

**korobizaka** (9.6): some of these old songs have such doodoo mixing i appreciate this so much more in comparison. also its just dynamic and fun

**Bisonsouro** (9.5): Just good all around

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): first of all, this is giving theatre music, but in a good way. 2nd, that opening is probably the first time I've ever seen that style of animation for an anime ever

**nyoom** (9.5): the music: ya like jazz? 

 me: ya :) 

 the animation: what if tim burton used sylvania to play out a rape allegory where the rapist felt bad after 

 me: what the fuck

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): ended fantastic mr. fox

**beeozan** (9.2): sometimes gets too similar to *Tank!* but they manage to pull it well! This song benefits like crazy from the full version experience (the flow!) despite it only being a minute longer. If the switch-up doesn’t bring you joy idk what does. AND THAT’S CALLED JAZZ!!

**1998tweety** (9): this would be a 10 if not for that man doing his weird scratchy voice thing

**allodude** (9): delightful

**cheatviathan** (9): Okay. This is an immaculate jazzy vibe. Some cool horn leads, a walking bassline, some funky rhythm guitars, and Jua’s smooth flows make this a bop and a half. This has done a better job convincing me to give this show a shot than any video essay has ever done.

**CrystaltheCool** (9): and that's called jazz!

**popularsong** (9): looove the mix of funk and rap

**Poydoo** (9): Well this is different. I should probably get around to watching this show sometime

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): bunny is a rider

**JIRACHI** (8.5): Normani and Cardi look different here

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): i like how jazzy it is!

**amr** (8): deducting points cos I can't remember what the hell this reminds me of

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I think Kalush Orchestra should cover this

**impla77** (8): you could’ve told me this was a Wes Anderson animated film and I would’ve believed you

**sarcasticsobs** (8): What a trippy opening animation. Anyway, "Tank!" should be the only jazz I allow in this rate, but I'll be nice 'cause I bopped my head

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): WHYYYYY arent we rating yoasobi’s op for beastars. i mean i know why we arent bc objectively the season 1 op is superior animation wise but WHYYYYYY

**Dragusken** (7): quite tame actually

**maybecrf** (7): it was off to a great start, and didnt go anywhere. but at least it started somewhere.

**vayyiqra** (7): this is kind of crazy with the filtered vocals and jazz piano and drums wtf is this show

**vexastrae** (7): its a cute bop, love the stop motion in the op too

**horridhendy** (6): Such a shame the other Beastars S2 OP wasn’t picked. That would have been a solid 10 from me - such a great OP. This one is okay but missed opportunities when YOASOBI is right there.

**ricki** (5): okayyyy stopmotion

**distressedbeatboxing** (4.2): This is exactly my shit and yet.....

**xavieryes** (4): most of it is insufferable but that part near by the middle-end is cool

**bigbigbee** (7): Just missing our Top 5 is one of the greatest shojo anime of all time! As I said in my bonus rate comment, this is not my personal nostalgia but it's very solid, and I'm glad it did so well because the series is so iconic! 

 Also I bet the singer of this song had a MIGHTY perm, just incredible waves and curls

---

**BebeLuigi** (11): In the end, no matter what, Sailor Moon will always be my favourite piece of media and the opening is kinda the most insane song ever created.

**beeozan** (11): these drums genuinely make me elevate and its a really weird part of a song to focus on but the sound is just so good. every bar ends and the drum goes dududu and im like yeah and then every 4th bar it does du du du du and im like hell yeah and then when it needs to transition it just goes insane and im like HELL YEAH. the day this song dropped on streaming services (peak rate manifestation) I just listened to it in loop because its what it deserves. I dont even have nostalgia for this show!! I first saw it in 2021 and dropped it after 5 episodes cuz I got distracted but this song is an all-timer. May I say the culture shifted!!

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come ON now

**alexismateofan** (10): what sailor scout did everyone want to be growing up, I wanted to be Sailor Mercury.

**amr** (10): Idgaf if U grew up w the english version U will sit down and enjoy this timeless hit

**apatel27** (10): A song so good they just translated it to English for the dub

**cheatviathan** (10): Despite three (four if we want to be generous) of my top ten anime being magical girl shows, I’ve only just now started chipping away at this show, one of the progenitors of the genre. I love this opening. The bassline is smooth, the reverb soaked drums are the sort of thing I can’t get enough of, the chimes and strings bring an air of elegance to the piece, and that vocal melody is so iconic that they didn’t change it one bit for the DIC dub.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended astronomy

**CrystaltheCool** (10): THIS IS A MIRACLE ROMANCE

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! y’all I am old enough to have suffered through the DIC translations in the US in the 90s. And Cartoon Network only aired Sailor Moon for what felt like five months, i was DISTRAUGHT. Again, oldhead alert, the way I got my parents to rent Sailor Moon VHS tapes at Blockbuster plz. And tbh, my first memories of the internet are literally trying to research more about Sailor Moon - that’s how I learned about the outer senshi, and I would spend hours as a kid just reading the synopsis of all the episodes lkklsdlks. I miss you that one extensive Sailor Moon website and forum, my internet experience back then was refreshingly wholesome and wonderful!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): The nostalgia

**dreamingpastel** (10): I might've grown up with the English dub from DiC, and thus have some attachment to "fighting evil by moonlight, winning love by daylight", but I can recognize that the original slaps. It's the same melody! I love that melody!

**impla77** (10): idk why sailor moon’s the main one when the moon is kinda weak and pathetic ngl

**JIRACHI** (10): now THIS is iconic!!!

**KuhBus** (10): While the song has aged a little, it's still insanely memorable and the visuals? Are still magical.

**Lynflower680** (10): Who doesn’t love this opening?

**milkywayinradius** (10): i'm not nostalgic; you're nostalgic! vibe of the opening fits the anime really well

**MrSwearword** (10): another serious contender for the eleven, but in the name of the moon, HIGH MARKS

**plastichaxan** (10): An 11 contender tbh

**popularsong** (10): 80s perfection

**sarcasticsobs** (10): QUEENS. SAILOR MARS FOREVER. 11 contenda

**TiltControls** (10): both versions are easy 10s

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (10): i love sailor moon because shes so useless stupid and lazy like shes just like me fr

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): now THAT'S what we call "the major key smasha!" so many themes want to be gamer anthems but none could do it as effortlessly as sailor moon. this shit actually pulls the heavy weight of being a tv theme AND sounds like something that'd blare out through dracula's castle in Symphony of the Night; now THAT is what we were looking for and gobbling on! makes me feel like im the ice princess with a spear about to clobber some demons! damn if only utena was in the rate...

**agnes\_honey** (9.5): the intro of my life

**Nagisoid** (9): Feeling urethral today

**nyoom** (9): one time my roommates and i queued up this one at karaoke and we all simultaneously sang it in the language we knew the lyrics in and it wasn't even the lamest karaoke i've ever done

**vayyiqra** (9): i never watched sailor moon as a kid because it was "for girls"; had me and my brothers been more based we wouldn't have cared, but alas it was maybe the year 1999 or so and we were not yet cool enough to not care. awesome theme tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I'm gonna pretend I'm listening to the original version

**vexastrae** (9): shes so gender ... <3

**shhhneak** (8.9): I WANT TO LIVE IN A 90S ANIME OPENING

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I love the Winx

**Poydoo** (8.2): death note

**bogo** (8): it's fun

**maybecrf** (8): it started off sick, but didnt go anywhere really

**mongeese0** (8): For some reason I remember the music/vocals being more dramatic than this

**phonethephoenix** (8): i like her delivery! also it even sound sparkly

**prettybirbkotori** (8): it's real good what can i say (i genuinely think i may prefer the english version)

**welcome2thejam** (8): My work here is done

**hacatu** (7.5): Good but definitely a little dated

**allodude** (7): still surprising to me that they just covered the original song for the english dub

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): A classic show for sure but this opening isn’t super memorable for me.

**Dragusken** (7): a decent classic

**dysphorbs** (7): peak 90s anime

**ImAWeebDuh** (7): yeah doesnt hit as well

**ricki** (7): QUEEN ALERT !!

**wujinan** (7): classic

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): who up sailoring they mo- fuck. who up mooning they sailor??

**Qwilphish** (6.5): If the audio quality was better, I don't think I would have liked it as much

**distressedbeatboxing** (6): As an opening it does its job of getting you hyped for what you’re about to watch, but I can’t really listen to it just as a regular song.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): it's fine

**pig-serpent** (5): https://youtu.be/uPgtVzr9xro

**saviorARMY101** (5): I’m sure those who grew up with Sailor Moon find this nostalgic, but to me it’s just meh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sailor moon iconic brilliant perfect ect ect but this op is kinda bad. maybe i just have too much nostalgia for the english one but idk this sounds so cheap

**Zypker125** (2.6): An iconic magical girl classic of the 20th century, Sailor Moon is iconic to Japanese pop culture and media. That being said, Sailor Moon was before my time, and I am also quite the ageist when it comes to rating music, so Moonlight Densetsu really shows its age. The song doesn’t feel like it goes anywhere, I can’t really hear where the “chorus” is because the song never picks up. Also, the opening song cut includes the horror-ish instrumental in the first few seconds, which drastically off-puts my listening experience. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**bigbigbee** (8): I don't have a lot to say about this; it's just really good. A semi-unknown anime, I think it speaks to its quality that it got 11s from TWO raters who had never heard it before. Thanks Rona, for doing the rater community a solid!

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): ended my other 11 choices

**hacatu** (11): Oh my god this is amazing! Damn, why haven't I heard of this before?

**nyoom** (11): "you can't see me but you hear me loud, don't that make you crazy now? don't that make you crazy now?" YOOOOO. i had a few 11 candidates coming into this rate but i had to give it to this effortlessly cool surprise jam that came out of nowhere to grab me by the throat. everything about it is perfect, down to the shot where they slapped "Virgin Music" across the screen.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is eating..

**babadork** (10): that drop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): maybe my favorite discovery of the rate

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Actually a banger

**evanbrooks324** (10): haven't heard of this show but wow this bangs

**IIIHenryIII** (10): some Halloween vibes, I like that

**imasalesman** (10): I watched 4 episodes of this and dont remember it at all but I do remember this

**maybecrf** (10): pop the corn and feed the children

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song is super cool

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/bknR-t6Y7xb31A

**phonethephoenix** (10): WOAH this is super cool!! love love the instrumention and vocals.

**pig-serpent** (10): OK!  This is how you ROCK!

**popularsong** (10): help why did the intro to this make me think of like a g6. love the edm-y breakdown closer to the end of tv version and the far away singing?? this is so good

**PSSST12** (10): Don't know anything about this anime but this kinda slays

**Qwilphish** (10): OH, IM ON MY FEET

**RandomHypnotica** (10): maybe host payola is good sometimes

**ricki** (10): okayyyy dubstep

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): an OP that makes you wanna watch the anime

**TiltControls** (10): oh that second half really picks things up!

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): now THIS is white boy funk! wait white boys didn't make this? this is boy funk!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hot damn, once it picks up, it goes from fat groove to absolute bop and then swirls the two perfectly

**Zypker125** (9.8): Okay, I said Chobits was the least popular anime on this list, but no it’s definitely Kokkoku. Flashback is one of those rare openings where a ton of people are familiar with the opening but not with the anime, and people frequently say that “the anime didn’t deserve this opening” (which BTW was a mixed-reception slow-burn mystery thriller). Visually it’s extremely interesting, using colors and transitions masterfully to create a viscerally interesting audiovisual experience. However, we are just rating the song here; fortunately, while I was more mixed on it at-first, it quickly grew on me to become an absolute favorite for the rate. It’s so frenetic and chaotic, and yet the sections of the opening flow into each other so well. Flashback absolutely leaves an impact and differentiates itself from the pack with its explosive elements. [Prediction: Late Day 2]

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): Holy shit, da bass. I'm 2-steppin in my room rn

**mongeese0** (9.4): Song that surprised me the most of any song in the rate. I was already into to the song, then it got into this MGMT/PassionPit/Yeasayer frenzy. What

**beeozan** (9.3): sometimes hostyola works!! need to watch this show (or lie and add it to my anime list) so that it shows up on animemusicquiz.

**1998tweety** (9): hold awn this song BANGS

**alexismateofan** (9): the moment this started I knew it would be banger and i was absolutely right.

**bogo** (9): oh i'm hearing something

**cheatviathan** (9): That guitar tone is peculiar, that bassline rips, the EDM elements are worked tastefully into the mix, and that breakdown with the choir is less grating than you’d think it is.

**DaswefSayLazy** (9): i have a feeling that if i watched the show by episode 12 id really really get into this track

**saturnribbon** (9): oh this one’s real good

**vayyiqra** (9): unexpectedly a banger listen to that slap bass

**indie\_fan\_** (8.5): i don't like the intro but everything after that slaps

**apatel27** (8): David Guetta take notes on how to do a drop

**KuhBus** (8): Did not expect where this would take me but thoroughly enjoyed it

**Poydoo** (8): death note

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The second half was about 6 of these points

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): damn that second half slaps ngl

**seanderlust** (7.5): queens of repetitive lyrics charli found DEAD

**wujinan** (7.5): wow

**allodude** (7): interesting, felt like I had no idea where this song would go

**ImAWeebDuh** (7): this is so danganronpa coded sorry

**korobizaka** (7): feels like one of the songs that kind of suffers from being TV size

**Nagisoid** (7): Not everyone should have access to Logic Pro (complimentary)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I have literally never heard of this show what. Cool song tho

**vexastrae** (6.5): this is so persona coded

**impla77** (5.8): This simultaneously bangs and is very annoying

**prettybirbkotori** (5): this song has terrorized my youtube recommended for 5 years just to not even be that good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i have a grudge against miyavi because he has this song called so on it that is no exaggeration one of the worst songs ive ever heard in my life but i guess this song isnt that bad in the grand scheme of things

**Dragusken** (4): it’s…something

**bigbigbee** (8): Serial Experiments Lain has definitely cultivated a reputation for having fans who boast that it's NLOA (not like other anime), so it's fitting that its opening stands out very distinctly as being NLOO (not like other openings) 

 We're definitely SLIGHTLY predictable for having this so high just because it's a woman singing in English (and, I suppose, because it was a TikTok trend). This is the anime rate, dammit, and we should be rewarding women who sound 12 singing about killing God! 

 But seriously - 4th place is an amazing and suitable placement for this, because it IS a fantastic song, and I'm glad to see that talent was rewarded.

# Sounds Like Teen Spirit

**amr** (10): elizabeth fraser was shaking in her boots

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Okay Cranberries!!

**MrSwearword** (10): despite this song not making sense for an opening...I literally found out about this song from it popping up when browsing YouTube. Honestly, "Duvet" is a fucking stunner even if I hear similarities to "Linger" by the Cranberries.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so Mitskicoded I have to stan

**PSSST12** (10): It's giving halsey

**Qwilphish** (10): This is from an anime????? I literally thought it was Imogen Heap

**flava** (9.5): you could told me Dido did this and I would believe you

**seanderlust** (9): guy who has only heard the cranberries: you know what this gives me?

**saturnribbon** (8): this reminds me of Alanis Morissette a lot

**mongeese0** (7.5): what in the natalie imbruglia

**letsallpoo** (7): is this dido

---

**Nagisoid** (11): This is THEE anime song for me. One of my most listened tracks of ALL TIME, my brain tends to burn out of repeating them but this is one of the select few that I never get tired of. Flawless in every sense, conveys loneliness in such a touching and realistic way that I'm not surprised this blew up on TikTok (apparently?). It deserves all the accolades it can get, and I hope this performs well in the rate.

**ricki** (11): the gag of a song i know and love showing up okayyy

**vayyiqra** (11): much of what relatively little i know about anime lore i picked up around 2011-12 when i had a very bleak year of depression and many problems. i watched lain around this time and loved the theme so much i would listen to it all the time. maybe helped a bit with the doomer vibe i guess. even though i'm doing better these days still what a beautiful song you have to hear the full version. anyway obligatory let's all love lain let's all

**1998tweety** (10): iconic viral tiktok smasha

**apatel27** (10): 90s Alt Rock just hit different

**DutchPeasant** (10): Has to be the best OP from the 90s. Oh so delightfully somber.

**horridhendy** (10): This is so great. So fitting for this anime. Such a 90s vibe.

**macnbee** (10): LET'S GO LESBIANS

**maybecrf** (10): having this song as an anime opening feels like cheating

**popularsong** (10): this feels like russian rock to me somehow in a good way... man i really need to watch this and this song is definitely motivating me lmao

**saviorARMY101** (10): I already loved this song before, and now knowing it’s this show’s theme, I’m gonna need to watch it

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I never actually knew what this show was about but this is a classic

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): look i know i gave shit to one theme for being in english, but i eat this shit up because its in english CORRECTLY. also it's from the 90s, and because its so short I went ahead and put the DVD on hold. thanks!

**welcome2thejam** (10): This is the hip person's choice in anime openings

**beeozan** (9.8): are boa nepo babies considering they’re the children of one of the dudes in Bad Company? Actually idek if Bad Company are even a flop band or not but they had a jojo reference in part 4 so they must have some reach. Anyway I feel like this discussion is necessary cuz like how would they get a tiktok hit with this otherwise?

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): lovely vocals!!! love the dreamy sound :)

**wujinan** (9.5): thank you for putting me on

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): Holy shit, was NOT expecting this kind of alt rock from my childhood

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): ended my target bedding

**alexismateofan** (9): a really fascinating opening song choice, so beautiful and clean.

**allodude** (9): can't beat the 90s vibes

**Awkward\_King** (9): vote for piano girls question mark

**CrystaltheCool** (9): let's all love lain

**dysphorbs** (9): running up that hill energy

**hacatu** (9): Wow

**prettybirbkotori** (9): the emo bitches ate this one

**TiltControls** (9): love these chiller vibe openings in the rate!!! sometimes you just want to vibe

**vexastrae** (9): the trans girl hikikomori anthem IKTR

**bogo** (8.6): this sounds like it could've been a late 90s alt rock hit in another universe

**nyoom** (8.5): HAAAAAAAAAAA

**pheromenos** (8.5): WHY IS THIS HERE

**Poydoo** (8.3): death note

**cheatviathan** (8): Inject those jangly guitar leads and serene vocals directly into my fucking veins. Also, I would like to redirect you to Nakinyko’s mashup, where this vocal is placed atop the instrumental to “Levitating”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjAj9Lc674

**dreamingpastel** (8): An English song? In my Anime Rate? OK, it's a pretty good song, actually.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): how did a song from 90s VH1 rate sneak in here

**impla77** (7.8): I’ve heard this on TikTok and all this time I thought it was a random Dido song 💀

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): oh, no! This had so much potential. I feel deceived. I thought I had found the treasure, but that was a false alarm

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): INDIE POP ROCK ESSENTIALS

**pig-serpent** (7): It's a chill song but the op not being in the episodes in the youtube upload has made so the song didn't grow on me while watching the series. 

NINE Without a doubt a show I'm still digesting, but it's a wild ride. I love the aesthetic, and the show's themes about the dangers of becoming terminally online have only gotten more relevant as the show has aged.  There's a reason every trans woman has a Lain pfp.  Listen to Rat Jesu.

**AmandaYoung2083** (6.5): For the guy I met with a Lain tattoo

**ImAWeebDuh** (6): i thought this was that tiktok sound

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i know this song is a classic among anime fans but tbh i never cared for it

**milkywayinradius** (4): song makes me not excited for whatever anime that was

**Zypker125** (2.2): Serial Experiments Lain was only 13 episodes, and while 13 episodes is about the standard length of anime nowadays, back in 1998 this was extremely unprecedented. In fact, Serial Experiments Lain arguably kickstarted the trend of “shorter length” anime and led to the rise of anime with 11-13 episodes. Lain is also known for its surreal and avant-garde imagery, and its thematic exploration of technology and identity. Unfortunately, I’ve never been a fan of Lain (there’s no words that can turn me off from something more than “surreal and avant-garde”), and that extends to the opening. It just feels like really old J-Pop, and yes that’s meant to be derogatory. The singer is quite emotional, but the instrumental is way too upbeat and thus it kills any sense of emotion for me.

**bigbigbee** (10): more like Agood. This was winning, once! And it says a lot that even some very late low scores weren't enough to drop this out of third place. 

 I have to take this opportunity to rave a bit about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as well. My friends and I often joke around that this is the only good shonen anime ever made, and we're only half-kidding. As one of them put it: FMA:B does a fantastic job fleshing out a world full of moving parts. the ensemble cast is vibrant and believable with their own motivations and storylines that may intersect with, but don't necessarily directly involve, the main characters. and it has an incredible amount of empathy for its characters, and handles themes of xenophobia, survivor's guilt, war crimes, the value of human life with thoughtfulness and sensitivity. As another put it: "its' sooooooo fucking good"

---

**DutchPeasant** (11): Perhaps the biggest what if were Yui do a lot more anime songs, both this and Rolling Star were the crème de la crème back then. Great rock with a banging guitar, but it's the singing that is exceptional. There isn't another anisong artist that can emulate what Yui did, and that makes her songs that more special.

**milkywayinradius** (11): ugh the prechorus going into the chorus is so gooddd.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): Perfect song for a perfect anime for a perfect manga

**apatel27** (10): Classique

**BebeLuigi** (10): yesssss

**Bisonsouro** (10): I would Bet my lifesavings that this one is a top 5 at least

**DaswefSayLazy** (10): winry wobbling for no reason absolutely cracks me up every time

**dreamingpastel** (10): When the drums and guitar kick in during the prechorus... Chef's kiss

**evanbrooks324** (10): a certified classic iktr

**ImAWeebDuh** (10): the law of equivalent exchange: i take your bop and you take my wig

**KuhBus** (10): powerful. Iconic. Unskippable. The drama alone within JUST the opening. And then Stereopony somehow took this song and ran with it.

**Lynflower680** (10): Thank god for the iTunes global top 100 list because without it I would’ve never heard this banger.

**macnbee** (10): she literally didn't have to go this hard. but she did...she did it, for us.

**Nagisoid** (10): Rona you're evil for putting this collapse of the century next to the Fruit Basket song of the same name

**nyoom** (10): quirked up white boy with a little bit of human transmutation busts it down alchemical style.. is he Gated with the Truth?

**phonethephoenix** (10): epitome of an anime opening tbh!

**PSSST12** (10): OOOFF Another 11. Hologram (OP2) outsold though.

**saviorARMY101** (10): A fucking classic, a perfect opening song for an incredible show

**shhhneak** (10): I think, as a whole, FMA:B has the best openings of anything ever. My favourite changes every time I think about it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The SMASHAAAAA (I need to actually watch this show)

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): again, you're no FMA og 1 but you are banger

**alexismateofan** (9): the better of the songs titled Again.

**Dragusken** (9): trying to set a record for highest spoken wpm

**mongeese0** (9): Again, a fan of the vocal production. In a lot of songs like this, the vocals would get lost behind the backing track.

**impla77** (8.8): Let’s go again!!

**beeozan** (8.6): avg fmab fan anime rate ballot would give this a 11, evangelion a 0 and every other song a 1. anyway this song slaps by mainly having a good transition to its second verse (very important if you want me to listen to ur song), variation in the lyrics (which I don't understand if I don't try but still sonically its a change up) and a nice bridge. A rare shonen pop rock opening W (kinda like how FMAB is a rare Shonen Jump W). Once it returns to the main riff to close out the song I'm like thats a damn good song.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): ok NOW we're getting into it

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): oh I can see what all the hype is about

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): I know nothing about this except one thing and that's [REDACTED] but omg this looks so much more intense than I imagined, I gotta get on this

**seanderlust** (8.5): the two agains back to back on the rate ballot...again...again...Again Again...lady gaga easter egg omg

**wujinan** (8.5): such a good song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Okay now why didn’t the girl also unravel and turn into lightning? I suppose that’s probably something I need to watch the anime to understand and not a particularly hilarious animation error.

**bogo** (8): this one slays a bit

**dysphorbs** (8): the superior again

**hacatu** (8): Conflict of interest notice: I've seen this anime

**MrSwearword** (8): most of the vocals hit, so that's in the score

**TiltControls** (8): oh I'm 100% going to accidentally enter the stats for these two songs in the wrong spots in a few weeks from now

**vexastrae** (8): okayyy !! i like this quite a bit

**welcome2thejam** (8): Raterkind cannot slay without first robbing something in return. To make day three, something of equal value must be eliminated. That is Ratrick's First Law of Equivalent Exchange.

**plastichaxan** (7.7): 💋

**pig-serpent** (7.5): When she sings fast  

 EIGHT A show that does little wrong, but imo the only great part was the plot.  And because a lot of people only analyze the plot when deciding if something is good or not, it is understandably overrated as a result. Still, it's one of the shonens I can tolerate so that deserves major props.

**cheatviathan** (7): The first opening to the perennial #1 highest rated show on MAL is pretty solid. An impassioned vocal performance and a decent buildup from verse to chorus makes that possible. Of the FMA OPs, “Ready Steady” was my personal preference, but this is still pretty good.

**prettybirbkotori** (7): feels like it should be a bit livelier

**Qwilphish** (7): when it presses the gas, get on for the ride

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): again?? AGAIN?? nothing new nothing changed

**vayyiqra** (7): the double-time vocals kind of go crazy at that one part

**pheromenos** (6.8): oh the elon musk anime

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): ill watch fmab eventually i promise (i have said this at least 20 times now)

**popularsong** (5): no matter how many eps i watched this song refused to grow on me its impressive

**Zypker125** (4.5): Here we go, the highest-rated anime on MyAnimeList (the largest anime database). Also one of those “I swear I’ll get around to watching it someday” anime for me (the series length has put me off from embarking on it previously). For the opening itself, I find it pretty underwhelming, the mixing sounds very… amateur-ish? It feels like a YouTube cover more than an actual song, and the instrumental doesn’t feel like it fits the vocals well. [Prediction: Day 3]

**maybecrf** (2): we cant do this subtle ass music while children are exploding on the visuals, it doesnt work

**bigbigbee** (8.5): See you, Space Cowboy. 

 It had a great run! Despite what my non-10 score might indicate, I was rooting for Tank as I watched the results come in. I really wanted to see if it could pull it off. But every time Tank seemed to be catching up, some ballot came along and widened the gap again, and in the end, it wasn't particularly close. 

 But this really is a classic. The instrumentation and production are incredible - bless Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts. And - while this wasn't a rate of the animation - as a full package, this may well be the most iconic anime opening of all time. Its impact is felt in *several* songs in this rate (as many of you alluded to).

---

**cheatviathan** (11): Easiest 11 I’ve ever given in any rate ever. Fucking iconic. Goes so inconceivably hard both in the TV size and the full version. That bassline, those drum fills, and those horn leads never cease to get the adrenaline pumping. It’s nice to see jazz continue to evolve after Persona 5 invented it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): as an anime oldhead, i must 11 this! :-) just a breathtaking and iconic moment for utilizing wonderful j-jazz in an anime intro. so many memorable moments here, from the intro to the solo. immaculate

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Iconic

**impla77** (11): to the surprise of noone, this is the only anime I have seen lool

**macnbee** (11): so many anime on this list--most of them younger than cowboy bebop--have aged so poorly in comparison. bebop is timeless. the opening and accompanying OST are in such harmony with the show, and so recognizable! i can't think of another anime with a consistent sound like this one has. the skill of the musicians in this song is unmistakable, too. you hear that bassline? those high trumpet notes?? the bongo drums??? the sax???? HELLO?????

**MrSwearword** (11): the definitive anime opening song.

**nt96** (11): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsyTs76XMAMEpZW?format=jpg&name=900x900

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Call me "basic" all you want. I mean, c'mon. Yako Kanno the GOAT

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (11): Saintly 11 dispatched to traditionalism. Yes, it set a bar for a jazzy theme and uhh (trying to find a word here) line-oriented editing that often can be matched; the Lupin the 3rd 2015 intro wasn't a copy or an exact tribute to Tank! but an excellent modernization of Lupin that happened to realize their 70s aesthetic and pacing had in fact, prolly influenced Bebop (it was completing the circle, so to speak). look, I watched some Bebop on my video iPod in 2k12 when you could watch certain Adult Swim programs for free online. Tank!, the intro, was huge it was undeniable and so so so so so so so so so so so so so different from anything and everything that has come since or of that time in terms of yr anime. And this was documented and well known! To be a dipshit at a 1998 anime convention seeing this on VHS (dubbed, likely) for the first time...could you believe that this was real? I still go back to those Amazon VHS reviews, when I'm checking to see if I could just afford a few of those precious dubbed tapes, and those few who left reviews between 1998-September 2001 (when cartoon network could finally use the new adult swim block to air a program that'd Big O fans would like but also you couldn't air for an 8 year old at 5:30 PM) genuinely feel like they walked away seeing something novel. Like at the age of 14 i just knew I was going to own all the episodes and that'd I would be irreversibly changed; lotta my friends still have not seen the program proper. And as such, a lotta my friends have never experienced tank in 5.1 surround sound! Tragic! 

Anyways, of all the anime here (and because Utena is missing), Bebop is the premiere symbiosis of music and image accomplished by anime. I am a traditionalist. I will reward on this merit the 11 most of all.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**alexismateofan** (10): Honestly who ever did it like Cowboy Bebop in the OP department? Your faves could NEVER. Also Spike Spiegel I am free on Friday.

**allodude** (10): the defacto jazz OP

**amr** (10): them making faye a lesbian in the live action still kills me like she has so much baggage already I don't think she's ready for pussy information!!!

**apatel27** (10): 🎺🎺🎺I think it's time we win this rate get everybody and the stuff together ok 3 2 1 let's jam🎺🎺🎺

**Awkward\_King** (10): this opening deserves the world tbh. conceptual. creative. cunty. it makes me wanna watch the anime

**beeozan** (10): yoko kanno too much of a legend not to 10 (although her 11 composition isnt in the rate). the sax solo in this song invented rawme actually. and if your reaction to this information is "was there a sax solo" in this song then it means you didn't actually listen to the song and you're a POSER. jk but the sax solo slaps. did u know that the guitarist of the seatbelts did the ost for trigun the very year cowboy bebop came out. thats crazy tbh. and mai yamane who sang the ending song (+ a bunch of other songs for the soundtracks) is in city pop rate so do that in september thank u

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Go on Tank! Try to pull that upset!

**DaswefSayLazy** (10): this was my introduction to anime beyond just like digimon and pokemon

**imasalesman** (10): anyone who rates this low needs to look inward

**Lynflower680** (10): Instant classic

**maybecrf** (10): its beyond a classic, and its stood the test of time. iconic.

**milkywayinradius** (10): LET'S JAM

**phonethephoenix** (10): jazz!!!

**pig-serpent** (10): Classic example of spy action music, perhaps the best example.  Songs like this prove that the kiddos can still be into jazz.

SIX POINT FIVE Cowboy Bebop excels at having a fantastic vibe.  I love the grunge and the grit, but unfortunately the show itself is pretty boring outside of a handful of episodes that are fantastic.  The ending run of episodes is really upping how much I enjoy this show.

**plastichaxan** (10): I've never seen cowboy bebop but my first uni crush was told he looked like the main character from it let me give it a 10 for that

**popularsong** (10): would be my 11 if not for asterisk... i still somehow havent watched this but the song is so perfect, from the little spoken intro and let's jam... wah

**Poydoo** (10): death note

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): if this wins ill be so mad

**Zypker125** (5.7): Here we have the winner of the 6th r/anime Best Opening tournament bracket! In a bracket extremely dominated by recent anime, Cowboy Bebop managed to withstand the test of time to snatch the crown as a W for the classic. The opening definitely has a ton of style and identity, drawing inspiration from Western film (especially from the noir style). Unfortunately, while I can appreciate the identity that the opening established for itself, I feel like the audio is quite repetitive and there are other full-instrumental openings in this rate that are in this style and are simply better (sure, TANK may have been the first of its kind, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best of its kind). Also, I’m not a big fan of the noir style to begin with. In conclusion, I am Team #TankTANK. [Prediction: Top 5]

**bigbigbee** (10): Yeah, most of you saw this one coming. 

 After it overtook Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - Again at ballot 11, it never dropped off again. (I didn't want to comment this on that song because of spoilers - but Again was actually the ONLY other song in the rate to ever have the #1 slot for multiple ballots!) 

 Anyway, as several people commented, it's well deserved. This is basically THE classic anime opening song for a lot of reasons that also undoubtedly contributed to its win - an iconic opening riff, an incredibly talented singer, being from a popular series, and enough time on its side to - as the song says - become a legend (at least among anime fans). Congratulations!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Well.

---

**imasalesman** (11): most iconic song in HISTORY

**LesApfels** (11): A classic!

**PSSST12** (11): Oh Y'all know this bitch Is going to win. Like this is literally Like a prayer's anime op Version. The Choir, The intro, The production. Truly ahead of its time. This is literally art.

**Qwilphish** (11): what else can be said, except that it perfectly blends all of the themes of the show with just an absolute banger of a song that literally changed the intro game

**saturnribbon** (11): this was predestined to get my 11 as soon as this rate was announced LOL. At one point this was my most-played song in iTunes

**saviorARMY101** (11): The easiest 11 I’ve ever given, even though NGE is not my fav anime on this list I can’t deny the opening theme is a FUCKING BANGER

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (11): shinji i am GAGGING for you faggot

**vexastrae** (11): Neon Genesis Evangelion - A Cruel Angel's Thesis: 11 legiterally iconic to me. changed lives and pop culture. [simply built different](https://twitter.com/junoavalon/status/1671016665046478848)

**welcome2thejam** (11): Get in the Winners Rate, Shinji

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic

**alexismateofan** (10): since I know this is sweeping, make sure to listen to the Glory Gospel Singer’s version, which would have gotten an 11 from me.

**allodude** (10): one of the greatest anime OPs of all time

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): Would be such a predictable winner but like everyone else is playing checkers and CAT is playing chess

**amr** (10): I mean...come on

**apatel27** (10): You Can (Not) Win

**BebeLuigi** (10): If this doesn't win the rate I'll campaign for a swift delete of r/popheads. Absolutely HEARTBROKEN to not 11 this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Okay yeah I see why this is the big-time frontrunner.

**CrystaltheCool** (10): this song is REALLY fun to sing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ya this deserves to win, rock on!

**distressedbeatboxing** (10): It deserves every amount of praise it gets and also many will call it overrated. Looking forward to the potential bloodbath. (Get in the fucking robot/Congratulations)!

**dysphorbs** (10): this isnt really a comment on the song this is just a suggestion to whoever is reading this comment to go listen to either the gospel cover or the cover ginger root

**horridhendy** (10): This is just a masterpiece. I'd have 11'd this but my support is needed elsewhere.

**korobizaka** (10): ALWAYS start a karaoke session with this song

**macnbee** (10): this is the one, right? if you're choosing something else you're wrong

**maybecrf** (10): never watched this show, but i feel like ive heard this a million times, and im not mad at it

**mongeese0** (10): Everyone else can go home. Music has peaked. The flashing text was so frightening to me as a child lol

**MrSwearword** (10): a contender for the eleven, but an iconic slapper in its own right

**Nagisoid** (10): See you in Winners 4! If we were rating the anime and not OPs this would be my 11 but alas

**nyoom** (10): https://media.tenor.com/RU4GYk2E8MsAAAAC/live-slug-reaction-live-slug.gif

**phonethephoenix** (10): honestly do think that it lives up to the hype!! perfect on every front tbh

**pig-serpent** (10): I love how bouncy this opening is.  It's very unique and funky, and it has one of the strongest singers in the rate too.  An iconic opening for a reason! 

SEVEN Neon Genesis Evangelion is an amazing show and unlike anything else I've ever watched... by the end of its run.  The first seven episodes before Asuka and Kaji are introduced are painfully boring, and even then it takes a while for the show to ramp up into amazing, even if the last 8 or so episodes are some of the best anime ever made and are entirely worth watching the series for.  It's a show I really need to get myself to rewatch to be completely honest.

**plastichaxan** (10): City pop etc

**popularsong** (10): if this dont win i swear

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 11 contenda. C'est parfait. Non, c'est vrai!!!

**seanderlust** (10): i was mad when trampoline by KKB didn't win so contractually i have to give this a 10

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): besides the iconic opening line, I've always loved how this ends so definitively since some OPs end kinda abruptly

**shhhneak** (10): The random June 3 years ago that I watched this series and the movies for the first time was kinda life-altering…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): most obvious rate winner of all time but like…look at the material

**TiltControls** (10): I hope something unpredictable wins this rate, I say slapping a 10 on this without second thought

**vayyiqra** (10): before even watching this show, which i avoided until 2021 out of fear of it being too depressing and upsetting (turns out it's merely kind of confusing), i heard this on youtube and it got stuck in my head, but i forgot where it was from. every now and then it'd pop into my head and i thought it was something made up somehow, a confabulation, a false memory, a mere platonic ideal of "the archetype anime theme". turns out it's that but also a real theme for a show! an alltimer you kind of can't fuck with this. 11-worthy if tank! and duvet weren't here (and my beloved, inner universe which sadly isn't here). would be a solid winner very catchy and iconic

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I love this song this song is worthy of my grace

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): they knew that even though this show was basically akin to building a railroad while the train is coming and in real time, that the theme needed to have EVERY single vocab term and hint of what da fuck was to come

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): Forever a banger. You don't even need to watch the anime to recognize this one.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): why does this anime that I know is one of the most brutal tragic and upsetting pieces of media ever have such a banger OP

**cheatviathan** (9): Shinji. True happiness is not about loving others, nor is it about others loving you. It is about loving yourself. It is also about the Mets, baby. Love the Mets. Alright, baby. Let’s go. Get a home run, baby. Love the Mets. Let’s go, Mets.

**impla77** (9): ooh its on Netflix

**prettybirbkotori** (9): exactly as good as literally everyone is going to say it is

**ricki** (9): i wanted to be a contrarian and tank this but i fear this was a bit of a gag

AnimeOPsRate: **Zypker125** (9): Here we go, the presumed favorite to win the rate! This may surprise people, but A Cruel Angel’s Thesis actually hasn’t performed well in most song rates I’ve seen; at least in the YouTube communities, it’s pretty rare for this OP to break into even the Top 20 of a “Best Openings of All Time” song rate, although it’s fared better on the r/anime tournament brackets, winning r/anime’s 5th “Best Opening” tournament amidst a field heavily dominated by recent anime. Still, I don’t think there’s a lot of statistics/metrics that would support this OP being the *clear* favorite; instead, I believe this OP is predicted to be the rate favorite for other “less systematic” metrics (aligning with r/popheads’s taste, being frequently labeled by the general populace as being one of the best openings of all time, constantly topping popularity polls online). Therefore, I wouldn’t be surprised if this song doesn’t win; if it does win, I’ll be happy because I like it and disappointed since it’s such a consensus winner prediction. [Also, the hosts put the wrong version of the opening in the rate, here is the correct one, thank me later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHdUakiEo4) [Prediction: **Winner**]

**hacatu** (8.5): This is really good, but it isn't the best on the list, y'all are kidding yourselves. If I can move my eleven from Wild Side to Flashback, a song I've never heard, Evangelion enjoyers can accept that this is not quite a ten/ten

**beeozan** (8.4): why did they take down the director’s edit version from spotify?? (future me: its only like that in turkey idk why they hated us like that) this is such a crime. for mere minutes I was hopeful that only the single version listed in 2018 was faulty but then I listened to the 1995 version and it was also not right. backing vocals in this song are insane and all - and the lil guitar solo in the directors edit and the following choral transition to the second verse is mental – but the rest of the song I think is just *fine* and not a top 5 pop song ever like some people suggest it is. and I say that as a fan of evangelion. now if we rated best song oat komm, süßer tod it’d be an easy 11 but that's due another rate I guess

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): started my depression

**Dragusken** (8): congratulations!

**milkywayinradius** (8): the electric guitar in the chorus does not rest

**Poydoo** (8): Kinda overrated tbh

**bogo** (7.5): oh wait i know this one, annoying people love playing this on any instrument they get their hands on

**pheromenos** (7.3): her voice adds so much to the song (it'd be a 6 otherwise)

**evanbrooks324** (7): overrated cause how great the show is still a good song though

**Awkward\_King** (5): its ok. that little do doo da doo doo dadadadadadadado melody is iconic but the rest kinda just flounders around for me

**IIIHenryIII** (5): there’s nothing divine about this song

TiltControls: Fantastic job rona and bee for the long awaited Anime Openings rate!!! Not a ton to talk about stats-wise today, but you both killed it with the rate!!

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congratulations (congratulations! congratulations!) to **Cruel Angel's Thesis** for the win! Across all songs rated by the sub it places 135th. It sits one place below Britney Spears - Toxic [Winners I] (which has a 0.004 higher average) and one place above Kelela - Frontline (which has a 0.003 lower average)

For our other 9+ score:

**TANK**: 353rd

 * Ties with: Tracy Chapman - Fast Car (Winners III) [353rd]
 * Lower than: Sky Ferreira - Everything is Embarassing / Curtis Mayfield - Pusherman [351st]
 * Higher than: The Supremes - You Can't Hurry Love

**Other song stats**

It's not entirely tracked, but congratulations to the Pokemone Theme song for becoming our 5th highest rated bonus song of all time! It only sits behind Mark Ronson & Amy Winehouse - Valerie, Madonna - Vogue [VMAs], Daft Punk - One More Time, and The Beatles - Eleanor Rigby

Also this is probably the first (and only) time the winner and bonus rate winner have tied with the exact same score! 

## ~~Artists~~ Series

I promise I'll get the series tracker done someday (I know I've been promising it since 2021)

Anyways there probably wouldn't be much to talk about here regardless as the only returnee is Pokemon (and only in the bonus rate)
