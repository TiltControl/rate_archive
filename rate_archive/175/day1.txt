Welcome to Day 1 of the reveal for /r/popheads’ Anime Openings / Themes Rate! I, /u/bigbigbee, along with my cohost /u/CrimsonROSET, are thrilled that you came. Today, we will reveal the bottom third of our songs (#75 - #51) as well as the lowest three songs in the bonus rate (#9 - #7).

The reveal will start at 2:30 PM EST (about 1 hour from now)! [Come join us in our Queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/myanimelist-reveal) to watch the eliminations live (plus some fun shitposts and interludes) with everyone else! Or you can follow the reveal right in this thread, as we will posts songs as they are eliminated, including the song's score, controversy score^(‡,) banners, and rate graphs.

^(‡)The controversy score = a measure of how spread out the scores are. For example, a song with scores of 10 and 1 will have the same average score as a song with two 5.5s, but the former has a higher "controversy". For stat nerds, this is the standard deviation.

(*^(I stole most of this post from the 2021 k-pop essentials and video game instrumental threads, thank you to those hosts <3)*)

AnimeOPsRate: **Two things to sit on as we wait:**

1. We hope you stick around for the reveal of the [Popheads Top 100 for 2022 after this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/14dngez/renaissance_visual_f_the_top_100_tracks_of_2022/) 
2. If you had fun with this, and want to make your voice heard in another way, consider checking out the [Popheads Essentials Project](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/14fkt6h/the_popheads_essentials_project_voting_true/): the project is currently looking for suggestions for "albums that are truly essential to the story of pop music", which will become a popheads official recommendation list in the near future!

**bigbigbee** (8): Wow, you all really hated this one but this song in CrimsonRoset's rate trailer is what convinced me that the anime rate would be a good idea! This song hit bottom almost immediately (at ballot 18) and never left. 

 And I get it - this sort of chorus-y ensemble song done by some enthusiastic maybe-non-singers overlaid over unsettling animation is not really accessible or public-friendly. Whatever. More for meeeee!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Before starting to get ballots, if you gave me seventy five guesses to guess what would come last, honestly I don't think this would be in the first half! I can understand why it got pretty annoying for some raters, but for me this is just a fun silly ensemble number that absolutely does not match the tone of the show it is for. It's not that great of a loss, but I am still kinda shook about it.

---

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): it played the full one of this so i have to give it a 10

**impla77** (9.3): pretty sure i’ve seen that face on shitty hmv merch so this is mainstream??

**Awkward\_King** (9): this does NOT deserve last. yall hate fun!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): baller anime name

**prettybirbkotori** (9): ok i won't give it a 10 because i'm EXTREMELY biased but i love this song even separate from the show (which you should watch)

**TiltControls** (9): I'm sure the lyrics work better in Japanese, but the translation on the vid is peak opening theme

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): :)

**nt96** (8): themes like these are death traps. They’re NOT happy

**seanderlust** (8): "If you want to shake it off, just shake it off" - me handing the aux to a swiftie

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I don’t think I’d have ever graduated if school was this fun

**Narhun** (7.5): maybe I will finally start watching this

**Zypker125** (7.4): I would argue this is the quintessential high school coming-of-age anime, despite being a surreal comedy with an absurd premise. Yes, the teacher of the class is a yellow octopus, and he’s one of the best damn characters in anime (even winning one of r/anime’s Best Guy tournament brackets). The anime has a lot of life lessons, balancing whacky comedy with character drama. For the opening though, I find it to be fine. I can appreciate the comedy of the singers gleefully singing about how they want to satisfy their bloodlust by assassinating their teacher, but that doesn’t really enhance my listening experience that much, especially since I don’t know enough Japanese to truly understand the lyrics. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**1998tweety** (7): high camp

**flava** (7): this seems so happy and peppy for an opening for a show about murdering people

**phonethephoenix** (6.6): don't love the vocals but the guitar is cool!

**Poydoo** (6.3): death note

**apatel27** (6): harmonising over killing someone is fun

**Dragusken** (6): just hyper energy

**hacatu** (6): Fine, but the Amalee cover is simply much better

**saviorARMY101** (6): a cute fun little opener that PERFECTLY SETS THE MOOD FOR THE WHOLE SHOW, AMIRIGHT??

**Bisonsouro** (5.5): not my vibe

**cheatviathan** (5): The ensemble cast of vocalists are of varying degrees of grating, and how loudly they’re mixed doesn’t help. That’s a shame because “songs that sound like they’re about to collapse at any moment, but never do” is one of my favorite genres, and the way that instrumental shifts keeps me on edge.

**KuhBus** (5): Perfectly captured the half assed sound of a school class having to sing a motivational song.

**plastichaxan** (5): I did’t pay attention at first cause this sounded like the beginning of Bird Box by Cupcakke and I forgot to score

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Excuse me? "Bloodthirst"? Oh, I didn't read the anime name, I just had the playlist on autoplay. I do not trust the yellow smiley octopus

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (5): why are they so happy shut up

**JIRACHI** (4.5): 3.5 for the song and bonus point for big yellow tentacles

**alexismateofan** (4): if i skip the OP, i can save enough time to regain my sanity.

**BebeLuigi** (4): I prefer the two that come after this one

**CrystaltheCool** (4): It's fun but kinda annoying.

**horridhendy** (4): Despite never having seen this one, I still knew the OP. Don’t particularly like this one. It’s a bit annoying and the voices are a bit naff.

**pig-serpent** (4): Really corny and painfully theatrical.  I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little endearing but it's also bad and annoying.

**welcome2thejam** (4): "Young people's discourse on bloodthirst" that's just stan twitter

**wujinan** (4): not good music

**bogo** (3): this just looks like danganronpa in a different font

**DutchPeasant** (3): Having the cast sing a song adds charm to the song, but as a drawback it also tends to sound worse than a professional singer. This song is no exception, with the bland instruments especially feeling lifeless.

**mongeese0** (3): Don't really like the vocals or the speedy style of lyrics that had to be delivered. The music didn't feel memorable either

**Nagisoid** (3): The sudden group vocals actually scared me I thought a ghost was speaking behind my back

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): “assassination classroom” isnt that just danganronpa

**vayyiqra** (3): kind of annoyingly cheerful-sounding

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): You would think being known as "Ass Class" would be the worst thing to come out of this franchise but no

**beeozan** (2): What is this, a Danganronpa Paranoia Agent crossover? The song itself is a typical anime pop rock affair but I’m biased against voice actor group performances and they don’t work for me here

**Qwilphish** (2): this is camp (derogatory)

**cremeebrulee** (1): ended dangan ronpa

**DraculaWeekend** (1): It kept getting worse

**maybecrf** (1): why are we doing harmonies with bad voices, HUH

**milkywayinradius** (1): subtracted points for each tentacle that teacher has

**MrSwearword** (1): this is absolutely horrible

**nyoom** (1): wow even the opening is incredibly obnoxious

**vexastrae** (1): this is so grating to my ears please dont make newcomers watch this

**dreamingpastel** (0): It's giving musical theater vibes, and it's not good.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Hypno clocked this as absolute ronayola, and he was absolutely right in saying that. I don't know, this absolutely activates all the right neurons in my brain where, for a while, it was a genuine 11 contender for me. For so long in this rate I was alone in the highest scores section, and it threatened many times to go below Assassination Classroom as the first out in the rate, something I probably would never be able to live down!

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Well, k-pop boy groups rarely do great with music that sounds like this in THOSE rates, so I don't know what I was expecting here.

---

**JIRACHI** (10): me when someone asks me about the start of Katy Perry's indefinite flop era:

**Dragusken** (9): the beginning guitar reminds me of guilty crown, sounds pretty nice overall

**saviorARMY101** (9): BANGERRR

**seanderlust** (9): some of these songs we absolutely should have slipped into the pop punk rate playlist and just gaslit anyone who questioned it

**TiltControls** (8.5): i'm guessing they picked pokemon shield over sword

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Ended that one Katy Perry song that definitely existed.

**nt96** (8): https://rave.dj/_Cgqc2dnyHnpJA

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): please RISE for the ronayola anthem

**impla77** (7.6): NOT THE MILLENNIAL WHOOP!!

**phonethephoenix** (7): i like the driving beat! don't care as much about the vocals but they're not bad either

**Poydoo** (7): cool rap

**Qwilphish** (7): The second half goes hard

**1998tweety** (6): this is trying to do too much and its not doing any of it successfully

**alexismateofan** (6): what was that like 5 second rap that never returned

**bogo** (6): it started off good and then it kinda lost me

**hacatu** (6): Really generic, would be higher cuz it's fairly good but the unnecessary rap part holds it back by not working at all. Anyway, Ken Ashcorp's I'm Your Slave is clearly the superior Shield Hero Song

**popularsong** (6): wow not feeling this rap at all

**vayyiqra** (6): whatever this is rock on

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This sounds like a mid k-pop boy song

**welcome2thejam** (6): Great moment when the percussion comes thumping back in after the pause

**shhhneak** (5.6): Using a fan as a weapon is so cvnty.

**Zypker125** (5.6): Rising of the Shield Hero was an extremely popular Isekai anime that started out hot, being very-popular and decently-rated, but the later episodes (especially once we entered the second season) polarized fans and received negative reception. However, Shield Hero’s overall popularity cannot be denied, even if it may not be that popular in Reddit circles. Song-wise, the rap is very catchy and a nice addition, but the song is kinda boring and lacks the energy or hype of other songs on the list. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**IIIHenryIII** (5): not bad, but the song kinda goes nowhere

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I can't decide which colored-hair woman to trust with my life. Anyway, didn't really like the song tbh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why is this kpop coded

**vexastrae** (5): my cousins dont watch this in case youre asking

**wujinan** (5): soooooo boring

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (4.2): landfill!

**apatel27** (4): It's definitely a Boyband song

**cheatviathan** (4): Those electronics don’t blend in with the guitars anywhere near as well as you think they do. Nor do the rap parts gel with the rest of the song that well.

**Lynflower680** (4): It’s not terrible but it’s so boringggg

**prettybirbkotori** (4): this does absolutely nothing for me

**Nagisoid** (2): :audience:

**BebeLuigi** (1): I'm not rating the song here but I can't in good conscience give a note related to that anime above 1 just for the whole slave plot

**beeozan** (1): if this outlasts battlecry delete popheads im not even kidding

**maybecrf** (1): the whiney voice and the awful audio mixing, what are we doing here

**pig-serpent** (0): I nearly did a spit take when he started rapping.

**bigbigbee** (3): Will never forgive this anime for popularizing this art style and making anime incredibly ugly for like, five straight years. Amuria on Deviantart, you will be punished 

 Of the Kanon-AIR TV-Clannad trio that were popular around this time, I think that Clannad was the most popular (?) but Air TV always had the best opening of the three to me. Between balladphobia + old song, this one was never gonna do great in this rate.

---

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this shit is the closet to utena we get in this rate. it's an auto ten. this anime looks way too delirious for me. im not at this stage to watch big eyed anime teenage girls learn about friendship.

**CrystaltheCool** (9): Just listening to this makes me feel the emotions of the source material...

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): like the strings a lot!

**saviorARMY101** (8.5): Haven’t watched this show yet but I can already tell I’m gonna be an emotional wreck when I do

**1998tweety** (8): im gonna cry

**imasalesman** (8): oops im crying

**maybecrf** (8): its very good but i will almost certainly forget about her in an hour

**pig-serpent** (8): I love how the serious beginning of the song opens up with some breakbeats and leads to a strong, epic feeling.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): it sounded better on my first listen

**pheromenos** (7.5): cute but the singing sounds kinda off

**BebeLuigi** (7): sadly I prefer the ending and the second season opening or every piece of soundtrack from clannad really

**MrSwearword** (7): the vocals are mostly there so let me be nice here

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): How funny would it have been if they got the actual Clannad to do the theme song for this one lol

**vayyiqra** (7): put a ? because no thoughts on this one and went back to it. still no thoughts but it's nice. eh i bumped up the score a bit because cool beat

**vexastrae** (7): bug eyed anime girls you will be dealt with

**hacatu** (6.5): The beginning is really weak but then it picks up

**Qwilphish** (6.5): I liked the amount of progression they were able to do in a short amount of time. Unfortunately I dont really like where it went

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): Lacks some oomph in some way

**wujinan** (6.5): vocals go offff but also boring

**bogo** (6): hmmm

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this could have slayed but it’s a little tepid

**mongeese0** (6): Doesn't feel like the vocals go that well with the music

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**TiltControls** (6): did this also get a video game? I think I remember someone sending something from it to VGI or VGV

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): ugly ass bug eyes

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Sorry I'm not a big anime ballad fan

**prettybirbkotori** (5.5): please free romance anime from these boring ass openings

**cheatviathan** (5): I may have ruined this for myself by accidentally listening to the version that was in the original VN first (It’s an 8). This sounds far more pedestrian and flaccid in comparison to that. The more off-kilter, electronic sounding instrumentation there works for me far more than the pumping strings of this one. Haven’t seen this show, which is weird considering I’m a huge KyoAni simp. Maybe someday.

**ImAWeebDuh** (5): they did the bare minimum

**nt96** (5): there’s something about the mixing here that’s preventing me from enjoying this and it’s bothering me

**saturnribbon** (5): I think I liked this one better before it hit its stride and then I didn’t like it as much lol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): ill watch clannad one day and maybe i’ll get this song. until that day though i think its boring

**alexismateofan** (4): Dango Daikazoku would have never done this to me

**apatel27** (4): Bad vocals

**Awkward\_King** (4): this feels like im being beaten up by frankie grande

**KuhBus** (4): the beat and the strings are having a FIGHT and the loser is me, the listener

**welcome2thejam** (4): Dear lord those giant anime eyes

**dreamingpastel** (3): Unfortunately not the Clannad song that makes me bawl like a baby. (Yes, I am talking about the damn Dango song.)

**horridhendy** (3): The vocals sound really off to me.

**nyoom** (3): please don't be good please don't be... phew

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2.5): Just don’t really enjoy anything about this.

**macnbee** (2): contender for show with the worst art style in this rate, and that's pulling from a long and ugly list. also, the song sucks!

**Nagisoid** (2): It offends me when people assume my name comes from one of the moeblob characters in this shitshow, no, it's a reference to Kaworu Nagisa from Evangelion (a future rate WINNER!)

**ricki** (2): these girls are fugly

**Zypker125** (1.8): Clannad, a classic harem anime from the 2000s. Nowadays, Clannad is more well known for its sequel season, Clannad: After Story, which is frequently called one of the best anime of all time ~~even though I heavily dislike both seasons~~. Unfortunately, the opening really bores me. The vocals sound really terribly processed and the mixing is also a trainwreck in terms of prediction, it feels more like a fanmade song than an actual produced-for-television opening. [Prediction: Bottom 10]

**AmandaYoung2083** (1): For how popular this anime was this opening is so forgettable. Like I actually forgot about it.

**beeozan** (1): the second of the Key studio anime in the list (after Angel Beats), Clannad is renowned for its incredible soundtrack and for good reason. Mag Mell - the visual novel opening - is one of my least favorite tunes on the 40ish tracks across 2 CDs of the Clannad OST, but don't get me wrong, that's still a good tune that happens to compete against some of the best music I’ve ever heard. Unfortunately this "cuckool 2007 mix" version is horrendous and basically makes the entire drumming sound uncool (the best thing about the original), replaces the cheap sounding yet effective synth stabs with some lame ass chiming and the rest of the mix is just incredibly uninteresting, leaving aside a boring shell of a track. Don't know why they decided to use it in the anime at all. The ending song and the After Story opening turned out to be iconic songs by utilizing tunes from the game. The tempo change in the After Story op (thanks to its interpolation of *To The Same Heights* from the game) warranted a 10 alone. This is just disappointing to listen to. Also why did they make the chorus visuals look like a harem catalog, not like Tomoya romances anyone but Nagisa in the anime, it always bugged me. 

 Anyway, welcome to the Clannad soundtracks recommendation section! We have: "look out a window and contemplate your life choices" anthem *Town, Flow of Time, People*, love encoded into music sheets anthem *Nagisa*, goofy peaceful days anthem *Spring Breeze* (and its mature version *White Clovers*), "I have very bad news" anthem *Roaring Tides* (and there is a "now deal with it" bonus track *Roaring Tides II*), "my whole world is now devoid of meaning and I'm being crushed by endless suffering and loneliness" anthem *Snowfield*. It's great!

**Dragusken** (1): just sounds like a sad old school japanese love song

**bigbigbee** (7.5): the only food wars I'm interested in are in Overcooked 2 

 I like the melody of this one, but it really doesn't stick in my brain, and it seems like a lot of raters weren't fond of the vocalist's tone.

---

**maybecrf** (10): progression, vocals, high notes, story, they ATE

**Qwilphish** (10): i really hated this song on first listen, but it's such a banger on subsequent listens

**ImAWeebDuh** (9.5): so its like chopped?

**pheromenos** (9.5): you can never tell how pornographic this anime's gonna get through this opening alone

**TiltControls** (8.5): how i imagine myself cooking after watching an episode of top chef

**Dragusken** (8): sounds like pure shounen

**saviorARMY101** (8): Honestly slaps, also the video reminded me how delicious food always looks in anime 😩

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8): kinda fucked food network didn't really take note here and start trying to syndicate a fucked block of food shows and anime from around the world for the 10pm-4am crowd. like it seriously baffles me that in the US, more networks didn't take note and do shit like adult swim. There was no ESPN 8: the ocho (a genius idea) nor insane food network shit. you got nick at night (horrid by mid 00s) and adult swim (horrid for other reasons, i wrote a giant paper on it I have a lot of takes)

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): ended cooking mama

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): big slice of life energy

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): kind of classic but nothing super special

**sarcasticsobs** (7.4): ugh now I'm so hungry I wanna SCREAM. I trust that purple-eyed blonde woman with my life

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is like one of the 5 animes I’ve seen. I wish I had more time so I could watch all the ones on my watchlist…

**prettybirbkotori** (7): eight years later and i still can't decide if i like this guy's voice

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's an okay song but not exactly orgasm-inducing if you catch my drift

**vexastrae** (7): [the judges when they eat salmon roe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907052681145765909/1107454146015150100/im-lovin-it-v0-2soc3nhuyk291.png)

**wujinan** (7): hype and catchy, passing grade

**mongeese0** (6.5): Was super invested into the climax the first 20 seconds was building into, and felt a little disappointed by the rest of the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): food wars is a very unserious show

**impla77** (6.2): Pro-tip: Australia has the best cookery competition shows!

**alexismateofan** (6): Could have used another 10-12 minutes at 350.

**cheatviathan** (6): This is most definitely an anime OP that exists. One might even call it one of the OPs of all time.

**JIRACHI** (6): this is making me very hungry actually

**KuhBus** (6): "What do you have there?" "A knife!" "NO!!"

**plastichaxan** (6): This is okay (not in a gay way just okay with one y)

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**welcome2thejam** (6): I'm gonna be so mad if this is anything other than a wildly stylized cooking anime, if there's a whiff of anything crazier I'm gonna go bananas

**bogo** (5): oddly tame theme for a show about food so good it literally causes people to get naked

**DaswefSayLazy** (5): manga was pretty decent but the anime was garbage

**hacatu** (5): Not completely without charm, but I didn't like it

**macnbee** (5): was enjoying the food visuals until i got flashbanged multiple times by busty anime girls (to me this is a bad thing)

**seanderlust** (5): this singer's voice makes this sound like an AI generated axl rose singing the intro

**shhhneak** (5): where is the camp it can’t be that serious

**zadooi** (5): This guy's voice is not pleasant to my ears

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): one two grapefruit three fore lose more

**babadork** (4.5): If I didn’t dislike the singer’s voice, I might like this

**Nagisoid** (4): You should drink water before singing

**vayyiqra** (4): lol what is this

**nyoom** (3.5): what is chainsaw manlet even trying to accomplish? anyway this song is somehow both very annoying and incredibly forgettable

**apatel27** (3): Filler sounding OP

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (3): called food wars but this didn't eat

**Zypker125** (2.7): Here we have Food Wars, the ecchi cooking anime, the anime that makes the phrase “food porn” truly live up to its label. Frankly, it’s the most boring type of J-rock, being a relatively slower tempo and in general being a “quieter” song, with the chorus barely leveling up the energy at all. Also, I don’t like the singer’s vocal color. [Prediction: Bottom 10]

**DutchPeasant** (2): Yeah that voice is definitely not doing it for me.

**dysphorbs** (2): objectively i can tell its a decent song, subjective it feels like a mashup of every single mid shonen op ever

**pig-serpent** (2): I hate that screeching singing, and the guitars feel so lifeless.  It also does the thing where the verse goes super low key which is my least favorite op trope.

**beeozan** (1): when food wars got mega popular in turkey with the one episode where they made köfte and döner (or maybe it was multiple episodes idk) I then realized the importance of representation in media. Seriously, even my dad caught up on that scene a couple months ago when he was like yo beeo have you seen this anime scene where they make köfte (this man preferred scarjo gits to og btw he is not very in touch with anime, love him for that) But still, as much as I love eating I thankfully dont cum when I eat good food (imagine the mess) so I never felt like watching this tbh. Also all openings of this show sound the same and unfortunately not in a good way. What are these vocals pleaseee

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Super boring instrumental, pretty grating vocals…oh that’s an absolute recipe for failure (get it because there’s food)

nt96 (8): the cheesiness of this intro can top a thousand pizzas

impla77 (7.1): bars

indie\_fan\_ (7): this is so incredibly corny but in a good way

Lynflower680 (7): 80s/90s cartoon theme song type beat

phonethephoenix (7): okay wait that was so fun! has a musical vibe for sure.

saviorARMY101 (7): kinda bangs, definitely prefer this one over the Japanese opener

distressedbeatboxing (6.9): The vocalist didn’t have to put their whole soul into it and yet!

Zypker125 (6.1): Pretty epic sounding song, it sounds magnificent and grand. I appreciate the ambition. However, I believe we have to factor the opening 45 seconds into our audio listening experience (although I’m sure most people aren’t gonna follow the rules of the rate that closely, smh), and in isolation it just doesn’t work.

welcome2thejam (6): Oh this is a different vibe lol. Still, it's very traditional Saturday morning cartoon theme song type fare

PrimaryCrusaders (5.5): Nah bc the Japanese one is way better

seanderlust (5.5): we have the pokemon theme at home

Around-town (5): I like the Japanese one better

bigbigbee (5): I'm sorry I'm sure this would hit if I saw it when I was 10 but it sounds like Christian musical music

1998tweety (4): this is kind of a mess

hacatu (3): Made me lose my will to live

macnbee (3): why did they do this to her

maybecrf (3): what is going on here, honestly

pig-serpent (3): This sounds like they gave a random person $5 and asked him to recreate the pokemon theme.

Verboten\_Prince (3): The Great De-Yassification

dreamingpastel (2): I almost liked the second half but it's like a pale imitation of the Pokemon theme song

Nagisoid (2): Was that Billy Joel impersonator 5$/hour on Craigslist or what

ricki (2): unyassification

TakeOnMeByA-ha (2): girl what

vayyiqra (2): never heard this before. very edgy stuff jk it's so cheesy and weak

IIIHenryIII (1): this is a 0 btw

nyoom (1): it's not that it's objectively that bad (though it is bad), it just feels like the showrunners were ashamed of how femme the show is and that's cringe

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I put this one forward because I wanted to somewhat showcase what more recent openings have been up to and how they work- and while the animation is beautiful, by sound alone I probably should have kept it off, as it flopped much more than expected. There is that one synth which detracts a bit, but I don't know, I just find pretty cool? It just sounds futuristic and dystopian, which is just the right vibe for the show (which I recommend.)

**bigbigbee** (6): Here to beat the "first in the playlist always gets a boost during rates" rumors

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): one song in and i’m completely gagged and i gonna have a 10 average for this rate!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This lowkey went hard

**popularsong** (10): the instrumental is crazy omg. i dont really like his breathy light vocals in places but overall its a bangerrr

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Oooooh, math-y. I don't know this series so I don't know the woman in these opening credits, but I trust her with my life

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i have never heard of this anime in my life but the op is made by hitorie aka wowaka’s band and thus i have to give it a 10 out of vocaloid solidarity

**cheatviathan** (9): Did not realize these guys kept going after Wowaka’s passing. Good to see that they haven’t lost it. There are some very interesting guitar tones here, and that bassline makes my head spin. Probably my second favorite bassline in a rate full of great ones.

**plastichaxan** (8.6): hehe

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8.1): all late 00s and beyond anime themes are the products of Battles' essential hyperrock ditty Atlas

**alexismateofan** (8): how many 8.6 jokes is this one going to get.

**Awkward\_King** (8): i know its alphabetical but this is also such a perfect start its really grabbing. im not too keen on the breathy vocals but the instrumental is really cool

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Already off to a strong start! Those decending powerchord bits remind me of the ones in Rina's XS.

**impla77** (7.8): i’m v bad at civilisation 6 so i spam giant death robots for easy domination too

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Not sure whether I like that squeaky sound towards the end, but I definitely don’t hate it.

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): hmm don't know if i love the tempo but also it's interesting

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Maybe the best executed of the generic jrock songs.  I love the screeching noises, there are tons of cool guitar licks, and the vocals are fairly catchy too.

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): ended the rich (idk about this but i’m going off what rona told me)

**KuhBus** (7): Solid, almost chill.

**Nagisoid** (7): I love blender noises

**vayyiqra** (7): guitar is crazy we're off to a good start here

**CrystaltheCool** (6): I forgot Hitorie was still an active band after wowaka died (RIP he was a genius). Good song.

**Dragusken** (6): i mean…the guitar's nice

**Narhun** (6): I wish this song was good enough to give it an 8.6

**Qwilphish** (5.5): Theres a lot of instrumental breaks, and I didn't particularly care for the actual song

**vexastrae** (5.5): eh its okay

**hacatu** (5): Perfectly decent but not exceptional

**maybecrf** (5): all of a sudden I hear this arritating, grating whirring noise, that ruins the otherwise good opening

**prettybirbkotori** (5): really gotta question the production choice to repeat that skree noise every 3 seconds

**saviorARMY101** (5): Meh it’s your typical shounen/seinen theme

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): My least favorite thing about anime themes is their tendency to get singers who… can't really sing…

**wujinan** (5): feels like a middle of the road J-rock opening

**macnbee** (4): already forgot this one

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (4): this is a mess and yet still sounds generic... pick a struggle

**korobizaka** (3.5): Started off strong but sounds like a weird unsynced version of a Ling Toshite Sigure song.

**apatel27** (3): whiny vocals with basic rock beat is the worst anime op genre

**ImAWeebDuh** (3): this man can not sing

**nyoom** (3): maybe he can try again after puberty's done with him

**Poydoo** (3): boring as hell

**ricki** (3): who started printing shit while they were recording this

**IIIHenryIII** (2): holy shit, the characters are all gorgeous, but I can’t say the same thing about the song

**MrSwearword** (2): this is really badly sung

**beeozan** (1.5): that shrill guitar riff is really annoying, the TV size version doesn’t know how to end and unfortunately neither does the full size (which I’m rating) DESPITE the liberties of having your song be whatever length you want. Also I was going to say something about more Japanese bands investing in Vocaloids (their vocalists can be :grimacing:) then I learned wowaka used to be a part of Hitorie until 2019. Maybe their older material is worth taking a look at but this is a skippp for me

**Zypker125** (1): It’s interesting that as a result of the alphabetical order of the setlist, we have a newer anime to kickstart off of the Anime Openings Rate ~~(of course, *real* raters like me choose to shuffle the playlist order)~~. 86 is the latest *seinen* (anime targeted towards the older male demographic) action show to become a smash hit amongst international audiences, delving into themes of oppression, war, and classism. While there are many who enjoy the series, there have been a vocal minority who feel like the handling of oppression/war/classism are too shallow and surface-level, and unfortunately, I fall into that category. As for the opening itself, I dislike it immensely from a listening perspective. The high-pitched *whing* sound actually hurts my ears and is inserted seemingly at random throughout the song. Even if you were to take that sound effect out of it, the song simply isn’t as hard-hitting or impactful as other songs on the list, and I dislike the vocal color of the singer. [Prediction: Bottom 5]

**bigbigbee** (8): Massive guilty pleasure type music for me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): You know, this was a song that was in the rate from its first drafts- mainly because it became such a big meme for some god unknown reason. It's cutesy, sure, but depending on the day this is absolute poison to my ears. I'm both surprised and not that this didn't exactly fare well in the grand scope of things, but one thing is for sure: it's between the more memorable openings of the rate. It'll be stuck in your head for weeks. Smile, sweet, sister, sadistic, surprise, seventy!

---

**horridhendy** (10): No justifications for this score.

**pheromenos** (10): CUTESY ANIME OPENINGS I LOVE YOU

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we love pre-existing shitpost material

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): they are all my wives if u bully this cut you are bullying my wives you fucker!!!!!!!!!!

**Zypker125** (9.7): Another one of the less-popular anime on this songlist that was a hugely surprise to see on the list, especially since I haven’t heard anything in particular about this opening. I was a fan of Blend S, as I liked its meta exploration of female character tropes in anime (tsundere, sadistic, little sister, masochistic) and seeing the contrast/dualities in personalities was funny. While I personally wouldn’t have included this opening in the songlist, I personally like the inclusion because I like this song a lot. It’s catchy, energetic, frenetic, cute, unapologetic, and dynamic throughout. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**maybecrf** (9): you succeeded in the cute mission, well done

**popularsong** (9): ??? im deeply puzzled abt the concept of this anime but the song bangs. very like, idol anime kind of song? it reminds me of a specific love live song but i cant put my finger on which lmao

**Poydoo** (9): 💀 oh god I forgot about this meme

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): everything was so much easier during that summer when everyone was making parodies of this op

**mongeese0** (8.7): Pleasantly surprised - fun song

**seanderlust** (8.5): girl what is going on

**impla77** (8.4): I’m both uncomfortable and intrigued

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): ended katy perry

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is groovy but why does it sound like babies singing it

**BebeLuigi** (8): Sadly outside of the beginning it's not that good but like the beginning is still there so a 8

**CrystaltheCool** (8): SMILE SWEET SISTER SADISTIC SURPRISE SERVICE SUPER GIRL WE ARE STILE

**dreamingpastel** (8): Is this score influenced at all by the memes? Do I think the score could be higher if it was the fanmade mashup with Snoop Dogg? Would I have given said mashup an 11? Questions, questions...

**imasalesman** (8): most iconic intro ever

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Such a bright burst of energy!

**vayyiqra** (8): very upbeat sounds fun don't tell me if this show is about something cursed it sounds cute at least from the theme

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**agnes\_honey** (7.5): made me want to watch

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): it looks like a goldmine for people who are into hentai

**alexismateofan** (7): you know what else starts with S?

**bogo** (7): something about this video is vaguely unsettling and weird but the music is decent

**plastichaxan** (7): This is like the other side of the sound I was expecting to hear for the rate but it is by women so it’s better

**ricki** (7): the upskirt shots and jiggling titties make me feel like perhaps im not the target demographic

**sarcasticsobs** (7): "Sadistic"???

**Senn\_Kyu** (7): it's cute but unfortunately I have listened to enough similar music

**TiltControls** (7): there's about a billion things going on here lmao

**wujinan** (7): good but not too catchy

**Bisonsouro** (6): iconic but I had never heard it from WE ARE STILE onwards

**dysphorbs** (6): ngl the snoop dogg 420 edit is the supreme version

**macnbee** (6): 6 for the song. jail for the animators.

**Qwilphish** (6): this is undeniably catchy, but I cannot rate it any higher in good faith because it feels like bait

**welcome2thejam** (6): Intro kinda made me second guess my choices to lead me here, but it eventually grew on me

**beeozan** (5.8): TOYOTA SUPRA! This is a novelty song that’s an easy target to tank, right? That’s what I initially thought, but then I listened to the full version which I had never heard before because the TV-size kinda sucks big time. Turns out, everything after the 90 second cutoff goes hard? I’m still not a big fan of the VA singing style here but I listened to the instrumental version to double check if this is a good song and my final verdict is yes. Unfortunately the vocals drag it down for me. A shame it was unfortunately wasted on this waste-of-time anime with the most unfunny, bland gags I’ve encountered. Blend-S more like Bland-zzz. I had a challenge planned for myself to see every anime in this rate (I’ve seen like half, and I would’ve skipped stuff like Clover and Bleach for my sanity) then I watched this and had to question my life choices and didn't pick up where I left off.

**phonethephoenix** (5.2): catchy but I don't love the vocals

**cheatviathan** (5): By the standards of cutesy slice of life show themes, it’s pretty mid. Would anyone remember this if not for the meme edits of the first ten seconds that were everywhere in late 2017? I certainly wouldn’t. Then again, I did give this show a shot because of them. This was my first SoL show after reentering the weeb phase, so I’m curious to see how it holds up five years later.

**Dragusken** (5): for smile sweet sadistic mf's

**ImAWeebDuh** (5): wait, so straight people AND gay people have two different songs called Bon Appetit that are memes?

**Lynflower680** (5): This came out in 2017. Katy Perry’s Bon Appetit also came out in 2017. Coincidence? I think not.

**OutrageousWorldTour** (5): Katy Perry outsold

**pig-serpent** (5): I want to like how bright and chipper this song is, but I think the meme format ruined the song for me, and implying there's anything to this song beyond being happy is being extremely generous to the op.  That said, I can't hate it because I do like the horns.

**prettybirbkotori** (5): the first few times were fun and then every single time after makes you realize how utterly grating it is

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Sucks

**vexastrae** (5): i would say its overly cutesy but i literally listen to pc music lmao

**hacatu** (4): Grating and obnoxious

**JIRACHI** (4): sadistic???????

**saviorARMY101** (4): ngl only know this song from a meme but the rest of the song is cute ig

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (4): something evil and nefarious is afoot

**Nagisoid** (3): The first 5 seconds are an enormous jumpscare to anyone that was terminally online in 2017/2018

**nyoom** (3): literally think anyone who likes this show should be in ja— HEY, that's the fucken, my son

**saturnribbon** (3): hmm not really into this

**allodude** (2): isn't this just the lucky stars OP

**flava** (2): your wives can’t carry a tune Wane

**apatel27** (1): viral bait hook into the most generic anime opening sound. It sounds like a bad Idolmaster song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): not sure if I like the vibes here

**MrSwearword** (1): nope, because again; shit that's cutesy irks my nerves

**yahi** (0): (prison honey)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): do the 00s pop punk rate

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Searches "ergo proxy protagonist" to see if I can accurately make the joke "putts the butt in butt rock" (I can't) (this also isn't really butt rock but walk with me here) 

 This song was in a lot of those "TOP 25 ANIME OPENINGS" videos on the early 2010s, probably because it does stand out among most anime openings - it IS different. However, in this case, it appears that it's a difference that /r/popheads doesn't appreciate - which makes sense, considering the general tastes of this subreddit.

---

**IIIHenryIII** (11): what in the Smallville

**bogo** (10): this is so indie coded i love it

**indie\_fan\_** (10): why do i get 3 doors down vibes from this

**Nagisoid** (10): This is just a Radiohead song circa The Bends, and I think that's beautiful. They probably knew considering how Paranoid Android is the official ending theme. Not related to the song but Ergo Proxy is an anime I hold in high esteem and it means so much to me. I recommend it a lot, it's only 23 episodes long and has an unique plot. It's similar to Lain and Evangelion in themes and aesthetic, I'd say.

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/MJksChD6Snt9OQ

**phonethephoenix** (10): okay wait another great pop-rock tune!!

**PSSST12** (10): OOHHHH This one is a nice discovery. It's giving evanescence

**shhhneak** (10): Didn’t know Dave Matthews Band was in the business of anime openings.

**pheromenos** (9.3): this is a linkin park song

**apatel27** (9): indie rock is good actually

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is kinda giving Christian Rock if it slayed.

**saviorARMY101** (9): Wow I think this is the first anime op I’ve heard that’s completely in English, but I enjoyed it, it has a nostalgic feel to it and packed full of emotions

**TiltControls** (9): this could've been a 2000s alt rock billboard hit

**beeozan** (8.8): WHAT ARE YOU GUYS WAITING FOR SITTING IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER WATCHING THE REVEAL?? DIDNT YOU HEAR?? **GO AND SAVE THEMMMM**

**1998tweety** (8.5): he ate that

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): ended the fray

**flava** (8): ok Coldplay, I see you

**ImAWeebDuh** (8): i actually like the song but because its in english, i’m gonna look xenophobic UGH

**Lynflower680** (8): This is the most 2000s sounding anime opening I’ve ever heard and I mean that in a good way.

**plastichaxan** (8): do 00s pop punk

**allodude** (7): almost a WB show intro

**Dragusken** (7): sounds like someone likes pop punk…

**macnbee** (7): this belongs on a soft rock playlist with creed (affectionate)

**Qwilphish** (7): They wanted a 2005 Christian-adjacent rock song and they absolutely delivered

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Literally the only thing I know about this anime is that the opening is popular… What's it even about?

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (7): textbook defintion of cousins music

**impla77** (6.5): you could’ve told me this was a Muse song and I would’ve believed you

**cheatviathan** (6): Works well enough as an OP, but not something I would ever seek out on its own. The full version does drag on a bit. The ED outsold, but the ED is literally Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”, so very few songs would have stood a chance.

**Narhun** (6): generic indie rock sounding mofos

**nyoom** (6): this is just coldplay

**Poydoo** (6): is this grunge

**wujinan** (5.5): decent american soft rock? idk not memorable

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (5.1): It's giving Creed.

**babadork** (5): Okay but gives mild Hoobastank vibes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this is so Lips of an Angel-coded

**hacatu** (5): This isn't bad, but I would never guess it was an actual OP and not an AMV

**KuhBus** (5): as much as the anime itself goes hard, the opening is a snoozefest

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its giving guitar hero 3 bonus track

**Zypker125** (4.6): Ah, Ergo Proxy, *the* emo-cyberpunk anime of the 2000s. I was somewhat surprised to see it get representation on the songlist (it’s popular, but not *that* popular, especially in the Reddit communities). The opening has a lot of supremely interesting visual choices and stylistic direction, but alas, we are only rating the song. Unfortunately, I think the song is pretty bland (even though its somewhat different from the other songs on this list); it’s too slow and there are too many “empty” sections. I’m betting most of r/popheads will tank this because it sounds like a song that would be made by a Western pop guy. [Prediction: Day 1]

**DaswefSayLazy** (4): scott stapp tier

**dreamingpastel** (4): Christian rock vibes

**pig-serpent** (4): This droney post-britpop isn't my thing but that drummer is going ham so I'm giving the song and extra point just for them.

**prettybirbkotori** (4): this is dad music. like if you told me it was daughtry or something i'd believe you

**RandomHypnotica** (4): is this a fever dream this can't be real

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (4): im a weeb im a weirdo what the hell am i rating here

**sarcasticsobs** (3.5): This looks real neat but my god what a bland ditty

**mongeese0** (3): Not sure if it was cool at the time, but right now it feels more Creed/Daughtry than Linkin Park/AFI

**vayyiqra** (3): that was a real nothingburger huh

**vexastrae** (3): this literally sounds like lukewarm coldplay

**welcome2thejam** (3): Buffy/Charmed type intro without the charm

**distressedbeatboxing** (2): Nice try but your Christian rock won't work on me!

**maybecrf** (2): 2000s rock in all the worst ways

**ricki** (2): when i think i saw the most 00s intro, there’s always another that outdoes it

**alexismateofan** (1): Regrettably it is an OP. and even more regrettably, I listened to it.

**Awkward\_King** (1): this is literally a coldplay song. and not a good one.

**Around-town** (0): This song is so bland that its only redeeming quality is that it acts as a palette cleanser for the rest of the great songs on this list

**dysphorbs** (0): you know the rock station that only dads seem to listen to? the one thats like "nothing but rock all day everyday" and then plays three days grace or nickleback? this would play on that butt rock station and even the dads who go to shinedown concerts would be like "damn this sucks". i was gonna rate some of the moe songs 0 bc they're p bad but at least they seem self aware and ive heard some good songs sampling moe stuff but there is no saving Kiri. this is like if creed made an anime opening

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Remember when anime was like, what if countries were people? What if Gods were people? This anime asks, what if authors were people? 

 This song is definitely a little generic, but I'm surprised that it did THIS much worse than other "generic anime openings", of which there are definitely a handful in this rate. I like the intro a lot (rater pig-serpent's comment describes my feelings well). 

 Lastly - we're sorry for the mixup on the ballot (where this song was briefly labeled "Reason Living", which is a different Bungou Stray Dogs opening)! I don't think that this would have done much better if we hadn't made the mistake, though, tbh.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): As the show I most recently finished in this rate, you'd think it would rank a lot higher- but actually, the score was a lot worse before it grew on me some! Those synths absolutely make my ears bleed, but I highly recommend checking out some other of GRANRODEO's stuff!

---

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this cut is trash (complimentary) for cousins

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): ended doja cat - trash man

**hacatu** (9): Is the link right? Very good

**mongeese0** (9): He really sang it out. Instrumentals reminded me a lot of rhythm game songs, felt a little similar to stuff I've heard before

**popularsong** (9): i think the titles got mixed up? but the song in link is very good

**saviorARMY101** (9): wait this honestly slaps

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): doja cat mashup when

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**alexismateofan** (8): GRANRODEO is just a great band name, they really don’t make band names like that anywhere else.

**Poydoo** (8): damn ok

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my friends are all MASSIVE bsd stans and im gonna be honest but i dont see the appeal in this show at all, i’ve tried to get into it multiple times now and i completely lose interest by episode 5. this op kicks ass though

**vayyiqra** (8): banger

**pheromenos** (7.8): guy with long black hair you will always be famous

**impla77** (7.7): surely we are crashing into catboy territory here

**Narhun** (7.5): Why does the singer sound like he has an American accent

**plastichaxan** (7.5): This was great until they started singing oh

**phonethephoenix** (7.1): pretty good but not super special

**cheatviathan** (7): Those guitar riffs hit hard, and I like the little synths in the background in the chorus and before the verses. Good song all around. I will admit that I went by the ballot and not the playlist at first, and submitted an assessment for "Reason Living" (It's a 5) before having to correct it.

**Nagisoid** (7): The hosts when they left the Candy Candy OP out:

**pig-serpent** (7): The "we have to get quiet and serious for the verses instead of continuing the momentum from the intro" really kills this song because the first 17 seconds are the most badass thing ever and then the song never reaches those heights again.

**korobizaka** (6.9): not granrodeo's best

**nyoom** (6.5): not really living up to its title tbh

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): Hard synth rawk

**agnes\_honey** (6): cute?!

**allodude** (6): thought this was TM Revolution for a sec

**KuhBus** (6): while I love the heavier guitars the singer's voice is just a bit too wobbly on purpose

**prettybirbkotori** (6): i know granrodeo has a lot of shooters but i would skip this every episode after the first

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is not Japanese… idk what language they are speaking…

**welcome2thejam** (6): Singer's voice super hit or miss

**Zypker125** (5.7): I was somewhat surprised to see Bungou Stray Dogs get representation on the songlist. While it does have decent popularity, it’s not as popular as the majority of other anime on the songlist and the popularity of the show has low-key fallen off over the years. I especially haven’t heard anything about the opening prior to this rate, so this was a niche pick in my eyes. Musically though, the opening is one of the stronger entrants for me, even if I do still end up kinda middling on it. [Prediction: Day 1]

**wujinan** (5.5): love the show but the song is not good

**Around-town** (5): I like the opening sequence but it loses me with the vocals

**Awkward\_King** (5): instrumental fucks why did this man have to ruin it by singing

**bogo** (5): ehhh

**Senn\_Kyu** (5): have watched this anime and enjoyed it, but I don't remember this OP

**vexastrae** (5): average rock OP, doesnt do much for me

**Qwilphish** (4.5): I was not into it at the intro, but that breakdown is pretty nice and hits

**apatel27** (4): バナナとアボカド

**Dragusken** (4): meh kinda trash…

**DutchPeasant** (4): You either like Granrodeo or you don't, I myself don't.

**macnbee** (4): more like BUNGLE stray dogs

**MrSwearword** (4): what has more fighting; the show or the arrangement and beat against each other

**AmandaYoung2083** (3.9): Usually I like Granradio but this didn't click with me

**babadork** (3.5): I hate this guy’s voice.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Oh god I just don’t like these vocals at all

**maybecrf** (3): the gruff voice editting on this poor mans voice, make it stop

**TragicKingdom1** (3): this sounds like they used a bad shakira AI vocal track

**ImAWeebDuh** (2): when you tell chatGPT to write a 1/10 review for Sour Candy

**amr** (1): I would assume for a show a concept this bizarre the music would match but that was a dud

**IIIHenryIII** (1): trash

**beeozan** (0): Granrodeo is a band I hear often in this terrible browser game I play call animemusicquiz and I’m taking my anger out on them right now. Their brand of electronic rock is lame, their vocalist is lame, I haven’t heard a single good song that they have done. There are songs from them which I occasionally enjoy in glimpses but this isn’t even one of them. Fuck you Granrodeo.

**bigbigbee** (4): I acknowledge this opening as very cool and unique but I personally don't get much joy from listening to it. If it were the animation this would be much higher but the song? eh. However, I really appreciate that it's trying something different, and I am glad that a handful of our raters really liked this!

---

**allodude** (11): RIP NUJABES

**amr** (10): nujabes may not be alive to see the low scores for this song but I am.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is basically a lowkey 90s rap song its kinda sending me

**DaswefSayLazy** (10): love nujabes

**DutchPeasant** (10): Watanabe simply does not miss with their OPs.

**dysphorbs** (10): watanabes love of american culture is really coming through

**macnbee** (10): mr president a second anime directed by shinichiro watanabe with a killer opening has hit the towers

**saviorARMY101** (10): I love how unique this opening theme is, I don’t think I’ve ever heard a hip hop inspired theme in any other anime

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): no shit sherlock nujabes was a real one for this; he broke barriers for nerds who like anime and wanted to get into hip hop that wasn't white nerdcore shit! huge leap for adult swim aesthetics tbh

**beeozan** (9.4): I love you all so much like thank u for making rates real!! they're a really fun experience and I really enjoy them and chatting with you guys on Discord

**apatel27** (9): Nujabes 🙏

**cheatviathan** (9): This is my first rodeo with Nujabes, and I see the hype. This has a unique, jazzy style to it that I dig, and Shing02’s off-kilter flows fit this off-kilter beat. I now realize that the only one of Shinichiro Watanabe’s works I’ve seen is Bebop. I should probably watch more of his stuff.

**Dragusken** (9): i’m biased bc i like lofi chill vibes but i’d love to listen and study to these beats

**maybecrf** (9): certified hood classic

**seanderlust** (9): Lo-fi hip hop? In my anime rate?

**TiltControls** (8.5): this could be in the sonic adventure 2 soundtrack (complimentary)

**Bisonsouro** (8): Stylish!

**hacatu** (8): Seems to fit very well and set the mood effectively (although I haven't seen the show so that's just a vibe)

**milkywayinradius** (8): such a cool, solid opening that goes with the vibe of the anime

**phonethephoenix** (8): a vibe!!

**Qwilphish** (8): I love the vibe, I understand the offbeat rap is part of the musicality but it is slightly distracting

**vayyiqra** (8): this is kind of weird but cool there aren't many hiphop themes so it stands out

**wujinan** (8): wow

**sarcasticsobs** (7.7): Chill stuff

**nyoom** (7): me talking shit under my breath after i lost the argument:

**welcome2thejam** (7): Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Battle to

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): ended serena chacha

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): This is a viiiiiiiibe. Very well-needed change of pace. Don't know if it works well as an anime opening but it's definitely serviceable.

**1998tweety** (6): shes different

**alexismateofan** (6): I love that it’s a chill opening but man it just doesn’t gel with me.

**indie\_fan\_** (6): something about the sound quality feels a bit off to me despite me listening to more than one version of this on youtube

**popularsong** (6): wow i didnt expect that. very laidback hiphop tune... i feel like its a bit too empty for me to enjoy though

**impla77** (5.1): I can appreciate the vision.. I guess

**mongeese0** (5): not a huge fan of all the english raps over nujabes songs...

**pig-serpent** (5): I'm going to give this a lot of credit for sounding like a real hip hop song and not a 45 year olds idea of what 10 year olds listen to.  It's not working for me, but I respect it.

**prettybirbkotori** (4): i know a lot of people like this whole offbeat rap thing but i REALLY don't. it's ambitious though

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Ohh I get it, him not following the beat whatsoever represents the main character's refusal to follow the rules of society. Or something.

**Poydoo** (3): Needs an Ice Spice feature

**RandomHypnotica** (3): i appreciate this for being different, unfortunately it is also kinda bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): lyrical spiritual miracle individual

**IIIHenryIII** (2.5): it’s too monotonous for my taste. Nothing happens throughout the whole song.

**bogo** (2): this sounds like an untrained eminem AI

**Nagisoid** (2): Serena ChaCha flow

**ImAWeebDuh** (1.5): they fought the beat and the, beat won.

**evanbrooks324** (1): sorry but I hate this

**MrSwearword** (1): something worse than bad rock in Japanese programming? Bad attempts at rap or non-sung music

**vexastrae** (1): eminem if he was a weeb

**Zypker125** (1): Samurai Shampoo is a historical action-comedy from 2004 ~~(back when the dinosaurs were still alive)~~. It became popular in the West after airing on Adult Swim, which was rare for anime back then, and the anime was also known for its hip-hop infused soundtrack ~~I ripped that straight from the MyAnimeList page~~. Shampoo’s opening certainly deviates from the usual anime song, being a fully-English hip hop rap song. Unfortunately, I find it really boring, as it’s monotonous and repetitive and lacks the energy or passion that would have drawn me in. The processing of the rap really brings the energy down and severely hampers my enjoyment of the song. [Prediction: Bottom 5]

**JIRACHI** (0): find the beat girl find the beat

**plastichaxan** (0): Promised myself to 0 Eminem any chance I could (apologies to the singer no one should be called that)

**xavieryes** (0): by far the worst song in the rate

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Haruka Mirai sounds like what named my OCs when I was 12 

 Yeah, I agree with commenters who call this one is a bit formulaic - which is something that you can level at a few songs in the playlist, but I'm sure the male vocalist didn't help either.

---

**agnes\_honey** (10): i "sing" this in the shower

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I could mosh to this

**sarcasticsobs** (10): WITCHES!!! THAT'S 10 BAIT FOR ME, BAYBEEEEE

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): POV: you just picked up the auto shotgun in l4d1 and are mowing the lads down

**nt96** (9): https://rave.dj/HadlyZ6X9NoeqA

**phonethephoenix** (9): okay i think this is a good example of the anime sound. i like the instrumentation and the vocals feel very classic!

**saviorARMY101** (9): been meaning to get into this show maybe I might finally watch it soon if there’s more bangers like this lol

**Dragusken** (8.5): Uverworld vibes

**cheatviathan** (8): Great execution of a rather standard format. The bassline is one of the most compelling in the entire rate, and the vocals and guitar leads are as triumphant as you’d hope the theme for a battle shounen would be.

**DutchPeasant** (8): Isn't Black Clover fortunate that we're only rating the song here, as the visuals were sadly a bad part of this OP. Not even that special of a song, since it was rather common for a battle shounen. But my is it nice rock with them putting their heart in it, intensifying it a bit more after the chorus is also always a sure way to bring the hype.

**hacatu** (8): Kind of generic, but good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Big driving pace to start, was worried it stalled out at the start of the first verse but it came roaring back

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**pheromenos** (7.5): love black clover but guess who is back is SO MUCH better

**Zypker125** (7.5): Black Clover is a modern “mixed-reception-but-very-popular” shounen anime (primarily targeted towards younger males). While Black Clover the anime is very mixed, many of Black Clover’s openings have received high acclaim. We should be rating Black Catcher or Black Rover, that is a hill I will strongly die on (both are more well-liked and highly-rated, even if I personally prefer Haruka Mirai). Anyways, onto the song. It’s pretty fun and energetic, and the instrumental goes absolutely ham, so I overall like a lot of elements this song has; I just don’t find it as catchy as some of my top-rated opening songs. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**alexismateofan** (7): yami if you’re reading this i am free on thursday night. if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out. i am free to hang out on thursday night so if you want to hang out on thursday night i am free.

**bogo** (7): i'm going to take a wild guess and say that this anime is very edgy

**nyoom** (7): that bit where he goes >:| then flies away on his dumb little broom LMAOOO

**popularsong** (7): kind of cliche "shonen opening" not much else to say

**Qwilphish** (7): I was going to rate this a lot lower at first but then the guy decided to give major vocals in the second half and I was hooked

**NervousLemon6670** (6.9): Nice

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Guitar and Drums slay, vocals meh.

**horridhendy** (6): There are WAY better Black Clover OPs tbh. Kinda a shame OP3 wasn’t picked, that would have got a 10 from me.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I know we’re supposed to rate the songs, but this opening looks stunning, and I can’t help but raise my score. It caught my attention and now I’m feeling tempted to watch the anime. It looks right up my alley.

**KuhBus** (6): even a mediocre opening will still be elevated by decent j-rock

**maybecrf** (6): shes not changing the game, but she gets the job done

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Unfortunately not every j-rock anime opening is high-quality…

**Around-town** (5): It's just so generic

**babadork** (5): There’s like two seconds of nu metal, so I hate it.

**ImAWeebDuh** (5): nothing special

**MrSwearword** (5): too boring despite the very "an attempt was made" level of rock Japan loves so much

**plastichaxan** (5): This is kinda what I was expecting to hear for 75 songs in a row and the reason I was not too excited for the rate ~~I love you Rona you will slay and I’m happy for you and the besties that like this~~

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is like the worst black clover op why did you pick this one

**TiltControls** (5): this could've been in guitar hero

**vayyiqra** (5): missed this one because i got distracted and went back to it and idk if i like it

**prettybirbkotori** (4.5): trying extraordinarily too hard i cannot take it serious

**wujinan** (4.5): sounds like every other opening from this era but worse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Unless I missed something I think this is our first HUGE BAZONGAS sighting in the playlist.

**macnbee** (4): whatever

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (4): the rock song anime openings simply blend into a grey-sounding sludge at some point. and that point is immediately after starting this rate

**vexastrae** (4): skippable OP

**apatel27** (3): It's aight

**Awkward\_King** (2): every now and again there's a track here where the vocals sound like a random eurovision entry that wouldnt make it past the semis

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): not big on the guy’s singing voice

**Nagisoid** (2): 00s Pop Punk is next month ❤️

**BebeLuigi** (1): It should have been Haruhi

**beeozan** (1): this rate is going to have a lot of songs that I’m going to dismiss as generic shounen pop rock and this is one of them, NOTHING about this song stands out to me aside from the couple high notes the vocalist tries to do which sound awful

**Poydoo** (0): Holy shit this song is super boring

**bigbigbee** (7): Is it considered representation to have this song in the anime rate? 

 Here we have it! Our most controversial, most-zeroes song in the rate. :) I am actually kind of fond of horrible noisy breakdowns like this - call it nostalgia for 2012 k-pop - but I get why this one got such mixed reception.

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Um…you know what…sure!

**bogo** (10): i promised myself i wouldn't make thirst comments in this rate and this video is severely testing that promise

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended david guetta and also racism

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): why’d i read this as (feat. Tyler the Creator)

**hacatu** (10): It's already nightcore, can't be improved. I've never watched this but it gives me nostalgia. Slaps so hard. I can't believe that Justin Biever would rip this off for What Do You Mean

**indie\_fan\_** (10): oh this boutta have a high ass controversy score. but it slaps so lemme be on the right side of history

**Nagisoid** (10): We can't escape from NCTcore even in Japanese rates, but this makes me laugh too hard not to 10

**pheromenos** (10): a dubstep anime opening...match made in heaven

**amr** (9.9): no reason for a show with a premise like this to have this hit on its hands

**Zypker125** (9.9): Here we go with the prime example of “highly-popular-but-not-very-well-received” anime. God of High School is an anime known for its amazing fight scenes and choreography, as well as its bombastic action animation. However, The God of High School is widely panned for its nonsensical story and its lack of plot (basically the *Transformers: Age of Extinction* of anime). The opening is very stylish, bold and energetic, with a striking color palette and a ton of hype movement/action in the visuals backing it. The song itself is a fully-English dubstep song, and the instrumental choices remind me of the [Danganronpa V3 Scrum OST we rated during the Video Game Instrumentals rate a year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQZONitFs9g). I gave the Danganronpa OST a 10 (it was ROBBED btw, Bottom 10 is a crime), and sure enough I’m giving Contradiction a high score. While the chorus is a bit difficult to listen to due to the high-pitched squeaks and notes, the unapologetic hard-hitting nature of the song makes up for it, and being a true head banger gives it points in my book. Also, if this song makes it out of the Bottom ~~10~~ 5, that’s a WIN in my book. [Prediction: **Last Place :(**]

**dooper8** (9.5): [Tyler Carter??? Hype. RIP Issues]

**phonethephoenix** (9.4): dubstep moment!!

**dysphorbs** (9): honestly this is probs going into my regular playlist rotation

**maybecrf** (9): UNIQUE [beyonce voice]

**pig-serpent** (9): From what I've gathered this might be the most hated song in the rate, with a ton of people calling it a trainwreck, and I feel like we can't be listening to the same song.  This feels like a pretty normal EDM song, albeit an extremely hype and badass one.  This is the type of music I want to hear at clubs and go hard to.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Some parts of this are giving me Knife Party in the best way possible. This tingles my EDM-enjoying senses!

**Qwilphish** (9): giving skrillex a run for his money

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (9): this is like if troye sivan made dubstep and im listening

**vayyiqra** (9): industrial banger ⁉️ wtf this slaps

**beeozan** (8.9): more like I’ll be ur controversy winner and it would be fitting!! honestly this kinda dubstep still works on me- CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE WE NEVER RATED BANGARANG, AM I TOO MUCH OF A GAMER AND EXAGGERATING THE CULTURE SHIFT IN MY HEAD OR WHAT. anyway this is good (haters dni), the electro house touches in the second verse kinda go hard for like the 10 seconds they last

**ricki** (8.5): OKAYYYYYYYYY GET IT DUBSTEP

**1998tweety** (8): this is so close to being a 10 but ies a little too skrillex-y

**apatel27** (8): Brostep at it's finest

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Tyler is trash, song without him is still good

**dreamingpastel** (8): For something released in 2020, there's something so 2012 about it

**macnbee** (8): the god of my high school was my AP japanese teacher, who gave us no schoolwork, took us out for ramen, and had a messy public affair with a colleague

**nyoom** (8): in english we call that a principal

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this sounds like a fnaf fan song

**ThaCoolness** (8): for those who are unaware the vocalist of this song is a piece of shit btw

**mongeese0** (7.5): loved the opening buildup. wasn't too much a far of the rest. Don't mind a dubstep op, but the "dubstep" parts didn't feel well-executed

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): I don’t think I’ve ever heard an EDM opening theme before but it kinda slaps tbh

**cheatviathan** (7): This is a very solid dubstep track right here. The buildups are tense, and the vocals fit nicely here. I do wish the drops hit a little harder, or at least played different melodies, but this is pretty good.

**horridhendy** (7): Hey Girl, Hey Boy…

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I was really vibing with this one but then it started squeaking

**wujinan** (7): i actually like this song

**distressedbeatboxing** (6.9): Noooo don’t peak in high school you have the whole rest of your life to become God!!!!

**Dragusken** (6): sounds like a rave bae's wet dream

**vexastrae** (6): this is giving 13-year-old gamer boy who listens to monstercat and trap nation

**villblomst** (6): the dubstep???😭

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I prefer my edm generic

**Lynflower680** (5): Was going to give this a 9 but then I found out the vocalist here has allegations so yeah I’m docking a few points. Fuck that guy. The production here is great though. I would love more EDM anime openings.

**popularsong** (3): is this the first edm song on the list. dont like the drop like at all...

**welcome2thejam** (3): Is this a good song? No. But does it have a muscly lady hitting a Stone Cold Stunner? Yes! So see, it's not all bad

**Poydoo** (2.3): hate that drop so much

**allodude** (2): a bit much

**AmandaYoung2083** (1): Just a little disappointed this isn't The World God Only Knows sorry. But fr it sounds bad

**Awkward\_King** (1): wtf is this LMFAO edm drop ass anime

**ImAWeebDuh** (1): ok this literally sounds like a club remix of some boring song

**JIRACHI** (1): burn it

**MrSwearword** (1): the sound is just horrid

**alexismateofan** (0): oh dear fucking god no. what an absolute fucking awful song.

**DutchPeasant** (0): Absolutely no.

**flava** (0): it’s like NCT because there is a lot of things going on that wouldn’t work on their own, and when brought together, work even less

**impla77** (0): the beat drop is ass idk what else to say

**prettybirbkotori** (0): i had several zero contenders and this managed to be worse than all of them. this is horrendous

**sarcasticsobs** (0): I am at Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas 2012 purchasing illicit substances from strangers

**seanderlust** (0): listening to these lyrics, the concept really is "what if Hot N Cold by katy perry came out in 2011 and was produced by one of those skrillex knockoffs from around that time"

**TiltControls** (0): my god goes to a different high school. you wouldn't know them

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (0): oh this sucks! like wow this is bottom of the barrel post-big beat westernized no-meat-on-the-bone bad acid bad "everyone is dressed in diapers and pacifiers" rave vibes from this terrible fucking intro. huge achievement there; the irrational hate 0 was never so easy to find.

**bigbigbee** (9): I have never seen a single full episode of One Piece and yet I am very fond of it. It was THEEEEE classic shonen series of my time. I know that the art style has its haters...and I get it...but I don't think that you can deny it's both instantly recognizeable and iconic. Plus, I just love the sea (The Wind Waker is my childhood game.) 

 With all that in mind, I think that this is a great opening. It's bombastic and a little theatrical - it sounds like someone telling the story of a legend...which I do think that Monkey D Luffy and his crew are, at least to anime fans!

---

**apatel27** (10): Nostalgia speaking again but shut up

**dysphorbs** (10): THIS IS WHAT A OP SHOULD BE. THIS IS ADVENTURE THIS IS FUN THIS IS FRIENDSHIP IT TELLS YOU THE SERIES VIBES RIGHT AT THE START. AMAZING

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/ra-LJQlxppPRlA

**prettybirbkotori** (10): i don't even like one piece and i adore this song

**Qwilphish** (10): its impossible for me to be unbiased as a fan of the show. Everytime this song is used in the show, I get emotional. They knocked it out of the park on their first attempt

**vexastrae** (10): i have a bunch of mutuals who are into one piece and if i score this any lower than a 10 they will kill me on the spot. anyways have fun guessing the context of [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292042312958083075/1112492485944561674/image.png)

**indie\_fan\_** (9): https://twitter.com/DatChaosGuy/status/1630318197969747975?s=20

**saviorARMY101** (9): Honestly not a fan of one piece cause I don’t have the patience to sit through 10393949 episodes but can’t deny this is a banger

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): so one piece was abt pirates all along huh

**Zypker125** (8.1): The infamously long 1000+ episode anime is here! You could watch ~80 other shows in the time it would take to finish One Piece. The opening is very fun, making you want to sing along with the lyrics, and the singer’s soulful vocals drive the engagement for me. The opening vocal line also kickstarts the opening well. However, the chorus doesn’t kick in as hard as I would have liked, and the verses are a bit too restrained for my taste. [Prediction: Late Day 2]

**mongeese0** (8): Rating is basically just off the opening monologue alone

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8): we are we are the youth of the nation

**babadork** (7.5): I like this song’s ideas. If I had any nostalgia for this, I might have given this a 10.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Trying desperately to think of a joke comment about how long One Piece is Uhhhhhhhhh oh god uhh starts melting MORE LIKE LONG PIECE explodes

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I love the happy vibe

**impla77** (7.4): idk anything about this show but I’m sure the real treasure is the friends we found along the way

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): yeah this sounds exactly how i would expect the one piece opening to sound

**1998tweety** (7): shes kinda derpy but fun

**cheatviathan** (7): Those horns and synths sound dated in all the right ways, and this conveys an adventurous vibe, fitting for what I presume this show to be about. The guitar and sax solos in the bridge are cool, too. The most experience I have with this show is the “The One Piece is real” meme, and listening to the Film Red soundtrack on loop. I’ve never seen a single episode. Its length intimidates me, and I feel like I’d be completely lost if I watched Film Red by itself. I just think Ado is a queen.

**Dragusken** (7): tell me the song is old school anime without telling me the song is old school anime

**maybecrf** (7): the city pop vocals, the sound effects, the crash landing, it works but wow thats a lot

**welcome2thejam** (7): An extra point for keeping in the "Wile E. Coyote gets an anvil dropped on his head" sound effect

**beeozan** (6.8): they actually put the epicness in the song kinda!! I vaguely subscribe to the notion that what is going to unfold after this song plays is going to be hype, which I can’t say for every shonen jump representation in this rate. fun fact the singer of this song is also in jam project who did opm which is right after this song, nice coincidence

**phonethephoenix** (6.3): i like some of the twinkly bits

**macnbee** (6): OUTSOLD BY YAYO YA YOOOOOOOO

**MrSwearword** (6): again, iconic franchise with mid theme

**sarcasticsobs** (6): I still don't know what the "one piece" is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask

**nyoom** (5.5): WE ARE! bored

**alexismateofan** (5): MMMM. that’s all i’ve got today sisters.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): lord i’ve always hated the One Piece art style. i mean points for having a distinctive style but it’s always irritated me D: anyway the song itself is eh

**KuhBus** (5): Once again transforming into The Most Insufferable Guy In The Room by insisting that the German opening blows this one out of the water.

**Poydoo** (5): he said one piece

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (5): well im not

**vayyiqra** (5): had some friends who were very into this show once but always found it boring and don't remember this theme at all. not sure how to feel about this it's cheesy but has kind of a neat vintage sound but idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Why does he pronounce "friend" like Fergie pronounces "ramparts"

**JIRACHI** (4): what exactly are we? description unclear you can get a 4 from me

**milkywayinradius** (4): love the guy breakdancing

**pig-serpent** (4): The 4kids opening too iconic, and this is just... a chill nothing.  My brain refuses to accept this as the actual One Piece opening.

**bogo** (3): i'm sorry but the dub version is much better, this is just boring

**cremeebrulee** (3): ended everglow

**horridhendy** (3): I mean, I clicked the right link but the first thirty secs of this was just talking? I get this is a classic or whatever but it’s not really doing much for me.

**Nagisoid** (3): Audiobook type beat

**ImAWeebDuh** (2): im sorry this sounds like a cruise ship singer

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i am NOT fucking watching one piece

**shhhneak** (1): “Should I start reading One Piece?”: me when I’m at my lowest.

**hacatu** (0): One of the most generic openings, further brought down by narration at the beginning. Originally I had it as a three but since it was my least favorite I gave it the honor of a zero, I hope that's the correct way to give a song a zero

**bigbigbee** (6): I don't think it's a spoiler for me to say that this lost the battle of the Agains really really hard. This is pleasant in an Asian drama OST way but I'm not surprised that this is where it's going out.

---

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended western astrology

**ImAWeebDuh** (10): very pretty wow

**nt96** (9.5): https://rave.dj/UZMc9YAGrI0ZiA

**dreamingpastel** (9): If this goes out early because of balladphobia then, well. I am disappointed but not surprised.

**horridhendy** (9): Another perfectly fitting OP for the anime if just a little cheesy.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): so pretty, I feel like crying

**indie\_fan\_** (9): another song that feels more like a closer than an opener. but it's beautiful regardless, so what else can i say

**milkywayinradius** (9): gotta wave my lighter to this song; it's a solid ballad and i don't really like ballads

**mongeese0** (9): Really a fan of the vocal production on this song. Feels a lot more like a fully released ballad than an anime opening

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Aw. I should finally queue this up

**saviorARMY101** (9): This is very relaxing and gorgeous, like I can envision myself listening to this while laying down on a sunny open field

**alexismateofan** (8): YES DIVA HIT THOSE HIGH NOTES AT THE END.

**apatel27** (8): It's cute

**cheatviathan** (8): As of this writing, I just finished Episode 14. I see the hype. “Chime” was slightly better, but this rate needed a few ballads to break things up, and goddamn, this is a good one. A tasteful instrumental with some cool piano chords, and a powerhouse vocal performance. The key change in the last chorus hits harder than most key changes in this rate.

**distressedbeatboxing** (8): Beautiful enough to break through my balladphobia.

**Poydoo** (8): is good yes

**nyoom** (7.5): it's... nice

**plastichaxan** (7.5): When I see gays in a basket:

**vexastrae** (7.5): would sing at the karaoke bar

**MrSwearword** (7): even with it being Avex because fuck Avex, this song is nice

**phonethephoenix** (7): kind of pretty and sweet but also ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Wish I could say I liked this style of generic ballad more, but at least she sings pretty

**wujinan** (7): karaoke bop

**babadork** (6.5): This is boring, but I’m giving too low of scores to let my balladphobia bring this down too much.

**Dragusken** (6): oh shit…here we go again

**maybecrf** (6): at least she can sing i guess

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): stream Girl with Basket of Fruit by Xiu Xiu

**Qwilphish** (6): i feel like this was probably in everyone's karaoke rotation when it came out

**saturnribbon** (6): I think this was actually my least favorite OP from the Fruits Basket reboot 💀

**TiltControls** (6): it's definitely pretty but not really what I want from an opening tbh

**vayyiqra** (6): 90s adult contemporary type beat but not bad

**welcome2thejam** (6): That youtube comment was right, that last "ahh" was amazing

**DaswefSayLazy** (5.5): its fine

**Awkward\_King** (5): big girls dont cry

**prettybirbkotori** (5): romance anime continuing to not beat the boring opening allegations

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): do the 90’s r&bheads have any thoughts on this. i have no thoughts head empty

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (4.2): might just fuck around and subscribe to twitter blue after hearing this!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I was so bored.

**macnbee** (4): only one "again" in this rate is good, and it's not this one!

**beeozan** (3.6): turns out shonen-poprock-phobia does not cure ballad-phobia. the full version tries its best tbh first hitting u with key change and then all these different instrument and the vocal slayage but once a ballad always a ballad i fear. Prism by AmPm ft. Miyuna was kinda robbed of being the Furuba pick here especially cuz we know how ph "loves" their ballads. That song's a smasha when the chorus hits like yall need to hear it (although it has kinda trop house vibes so maybe dont check it out if youre averse to that sound)

**AmandaYoung2083** (3): Nowhere near the icon status of the original opening

**Nagisoid** (3): Balladphobia is justified in this ONE instance

**ricki** (3): that grey hair twink has an evil aura…. [edit: idk why i said this when i first rated this]

**shhhneak** (3): a lil balladphobia never hurt anyone

**Zypker125** (2.2): “Openings named ‘Again’ from an anime that starts with the letter F”, heh heh. Fruits Basket is arguably the most famous *shoujo* (targeted towards the younger female demographic) anime of all time, eventually inspiring the famous Asian drama series “Boys Over Flowers” and other similar dramas. The song definitely feels like an ending instead of an opening, being very piano-heavy and focusing on the emotional vocals. Unfortunately, these kinds of songs bore me and I’m glad this isn’t the standard for openings (give me a generic J-rock song over this any day of the week). [Prediction: Bottom 5]

**bogo** (2): this being right next to the full metal alchemist song is such a setup cause it's much worse

**Senn\_Kyu** (0): something about this puts me on edge which is unfortunately the opposite of the goal

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I've defended this show a lot while hosting the rate, and this opening perfectly exemplifies why- it just does not take itself very seriously. It's there to be a parody of the magic battle isekai genre that became super popular in the 2010s, and I think it gets off on all its marks- and this opening only adds more to that, with really fun visuals and a peppy song running throughout! The part where the chorus truly ascends is an absolute highlight of the rate for me.

**bigbigbee** (7): ["In the 80s every Japanese student who strayed into the path of a vehicle was tackled to safety by a passing tokusatsu protagonist. They don't do that anymore and that's why isekai exists now"](https://twitter.com/SunshineMoonRX/status/1537894296480731144) 

 While this was solidly Day 1 throughout the rate, this one has grown on me while preparing for this reveal - I agree with the commenter who said that it's very funny.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): more prominent basslines yassss!!!!

**phonethephoenix** (8.4): some nice peaks in the song

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): I trust the witch in red and her cat with my life

**alexismateofan** (8): just really silly and so much fun to listen to.

**bogo** (8): did they just blow up that giant turtle

**Dragusken** (8): honestly, surprisingly decent. Well played konosuba

**milkywayinradius** (8): really like the chorus; very sweet sounding

**mongeese0** (8): Felt a little subdued than I'd like - still a fun song

**prettybirbkotori** (8): unfortunate victim of "the first op is better" syndrome but the dance is cute

**ricki** (8): okayyyyy ponytail i see you

**Narhun** (7.5): Unrelated but I just want a gay isekai with this much fan service, is that too much to ask for?

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**pig-serpent** (7): A pumping rock rhythm with earnest vocals and slightly goofy secondary instrumentation choices.  All of these choices fit Konosuba very well, I'm happy that they went slightly beyond the typical J-rock for this one.  

FOUR Konosuba is the type of show that has one funny joke per episode, then the rest of the show is rehashing the same few character jokes over and over to the point where I was annoyed with "aqua is useless'' jokes well before the halfway point of the first season.  The good jokes just weren't worth sitting through the rest of the series, and I've heard it gets transphobia later too, so good riddance.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): That slap bass work in the first six seconds was dope!

**vayyiqra** (7): vibe is kind of "the band midori if they were normal". indieheads j-punk rate type beat

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): These bitches be crazy

**welcome2thejam** (7): 😏👍 😏👍 😏👍 😏👍

**hacatu** (6.5): Bland and it's tough to look past the fanservice in even just the OP MV, but musically it's certainly servicable

**impla77** (6.5): Paul McCartney on opposite day:

**cheatviathan** (6): The slap bass in the intro, outro and bridge are the only exceptional parts of this one for me, and Machico’s vocals aren’t the best fit for this instrumental. “Fantastic Dreamer” would have been a 9 (a key change, a grander instrumental presentation that better fits Machico’s voice, and the weird shift to 3/4 time in the prechorus does that to songs).

**IIIHenryIII** (6): not a fan of the voice, but it’s nice

**maybecrf** (6): vvvv cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): idk i have absolutely nothing interesting to say about this song whatsoever. its ok.

**vexastrae** (6): ive never seen this anime before and yet i somehow clocked this as the fanservice kind

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (6): workhorse power chords

**Zypker125** (6): Both of KonoSuba’s openings from the first two seasons are highly acclaimed, so I was a little surprised to see S2’s opening be chosen over S1. I’m not complaining though, because there’s a lot to like about the S2 opening. The visuals and mini-storyline of the opening are super funny, the ‘blank face’ dancing is absolutely hilarious, and the jokes are jam-packed whilst still having a coherent plot. However, we are supposed to be rating the opening just based on the song, and uh….. I find it really generic. The vocals are pretty generic “cutesy singing” and detract from the comedic energy of the song, I feel like a more fiery vocal delivery would have suited the opening better. In general, the opening feels like it’s focusing too much on being cutesy and it doesn’t take any risks, ironic given how risque the jokes in Konosuba are. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**DaswefSayLazy** (5.5): very standard

**wujinan** (5.5): boring

**apatel27** (5): ehh a sound thats been done thousands of times before

**Nagisoid** (5): I feel dirty giving this a lower score than SAO but

**Qwilphish** (5): The song is pretty whatever but this might be the funniest intro yet i was laughing the whole time

**saviorARMY101** (5): bopping slightly

**beeozan** (4): this is kinda a perfectly fine song that I just don't like at all. Bonus points for some riffing near the end

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I’m getting the feeling that this show might have fan service in it.

**nyoom** (3.5): "her voice is annoying, sorry about it, she's probably lovely" - bigbigbee

**macnbee** (3): nope

**Poydoo** (3): death note

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this world is not wonderful i fear

**bigbigbee** (5): A little bit like being hit in the head by synths. The singer's voice was divisive - I think our comments are fairly evenly split between thinking it's the best part of the song, and finding this grating. This was another "always Day 1" song.

---

**evanbrooks324** (10): this will never not hit

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i dont wanna know any more about this show but its opening is amaze

**shhhneak** (10): Lemme put a goddamn mark to that.

**TiltControls** (10): THE VOCALS HERE. Came really close to giving this an 11, but something else just beat it out

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (10): this was one of the first times i actively followed an anime as it aired and i was so invested and oh my fucking god how embarassing of me because it was a total fucking mess. i dont think it was as bad as some people make it out to be.... it was nice it was different it was unusual. i do not stand by it or defend it at all mind you. 02 was cunty tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): "You are rating the song, not the anime" WHEW you don't need to tell me twice! What an absolute fucking trainwreck this was! I hopped off before it really went to shit but it was so entertaining just watching all the chaos happening on r/anime and /a/ in real time. But the thing that frustrates me the most, more than the premise begging for a queer-friendly plot and yet becoming one of the straightest shows of all time, more than the extremely creepy sexual content involving minors, more than inspiring Kim Kardashian, is that it did NOT deserve this masterpiece of an opening theme, misleading every viewer into thinking this show would be ANY kind of quality…

**impla77** (9.5): The singer kinda sounds like Cyndi Lauper ngl

**pheromenos** (9.3): ouuu do you hear the SYNTHS

**amr** (9): I'd live in a city exclusively occupied by teslas if it meant never seeing zero two's face again

**BebeLuigi** (9): The opening is the only reason I dropped this at episode 3 instead of episode 1

**Bisonsouro** (9): Actually pretty cool

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I was gonna comment “you can’t just use loud synths in your theme and expect me to like it” but no yeah they kinda got me!

**bogo** (9): it was a 6 until it hit the slay button

**prettybirbkotori** (9): song so good it almost makes me forget how unbelievably awful this show's ending was

**saviorARMY101** (9): Ngl this song hits, and I love the singer’s voice

**nt96** (8.8): https://rave.dj/HnE4BaZog5P-kQ

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8.3): this is basically a more eaze pop ditty

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): Enjoying this drum beat. I trust this pink-haired devil woman with my life

**cheatviathan** (8): The way the layers of percussion come in one on top of the other in the first verse is great. The pianos and synths sound polished, but not to a fault, and those vocal melodies are sure to stick in my head. Also, not related to the music, but I’mma just say that I don’t get the appeal of 02. Can someone explain why r/animemes went wild for her?

**DutchPeasant** (8): A solid song with an incredible drop? Yeah this OP certainly is one of the few good things about this show.

**KuhBus** (8): this has no right to slap this hard

**mongeese0** (8): Didn't enjoy the song a whole lot, but felt like it conveyed sadness better than a lot of "sad anime" themes. (I assume this is a sadboi anime, cuz if not then ???)

**MrSwearword** (8): despite some wahey vocals, this does mostly hit

**welcome2thejam** (8): Good thumping beat and nails the drop

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**alexismateofan** (7): The kind of music you might hear in Hot Topic, and that’s neither complimentary nor derogatory.

**apatel27** (7): I see the vision but it falls just short

**indie\_fan\_** (7): this could be really great but I'm not too huge on the vocals

**maybecrf** (7): she stayed in her lane, but its a solid lane

**Nagisoid** (7): Syphilia anthem

**Narhun** (7): Had a lot of potential but I don't feel like it quite lived up to it

**Poydoo** (7): death note

**babadork** (6.5): This is kind of good but the mix is terrible

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): this is screaming early 2010s

**phonethephoenix** (6.4): the synths are cool enough, and I like a couple of the lyrics

**Dragusken** (6): honestly played to death

**hacatu** (6): How did this get on the list but not BNA/Kill La Kill/Edgerunners/PS&G?

**Senn\_Kyu** (6): the song is fine but unfortunately the vocals aren't for me

**wujinan** (6): mid

**agnes\_honey** (5): i would pass

**plastichaxan** (5): Oh that kinda seemed like it was getting ready to eat and then stopped

**Qwilphish** (5): Perfectly mid

**vexastrae** (5): eh its nice when its on but very forgettable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): zero two ruined an entire generation of men

**vayyiqra** (4): this beat and piano are not going together well to me and the vocals are weak; hard to explain but this sounds like an AI listened to porter robinson's worlds exactly once and was then prompted to write a song but it didn't turn out well

**Zypker125** (3.3): Darling in the Franxx is another anime in the box of “very-popular-but-critically-not-well-received anime targeted towards younger males”. DiTF obviously was trying to become the next Neon Genesis Evangelion, and while the anime’s first half was well received, its second half in comparison was panned. However, the opening song is well-acclaimed and has stood the test of time for many. Unfortunately, it’s never stood the test of time for me, because I’ve never gotten the hype for this song. The mixing is just off for me, the instrumentals are too quiet for the song and thereby misses a lot on the catchiness factor. The vocal delivery is great though, very emotional and rich. [Prediction: Bottom 10]

**Around-town** (3): I can't but my finger on why, but I don't like it

**macnbee** (3): some of these i'm like...WHO is watching this...

**nyoom** (3): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EIFDKx-WkAARIRo?format=png&name=small

**pig-serpent** (3): This song had a bunch of cool ideas and chose to execute all of them in the least cool way imaginable.

**ricki** (3): that slayful synth was wasted in this song

**beeozan** (2): I don’t know much about Mika Nakashima but they really tried to save this song. Hyde’s production doesn’t really resonate with me though, neither in this song nor in the Attack on Titan opening he did for season 3. Imagine if Hyde had a band where others did the composing and he was left to sing and they did some great openings for some classic anime like GTO and Fullmetal Alchemist… now that would be a crazy coincidence mmmhmm

**DaswefSayLazy** (2): straight up one of the worst television shows ever made holy shit i hope somebody got fired when the aliens showed up and then they launched into outer space

**Awkward\_King** (1): u will never be deathnote

**dysphorbs** (1): for a trigger series you think the op would serve more cunt

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): the singer is kinda struggling here oof

**distressedbeatboxing** (0): Everything about this is hitting wrong for me. It’s drags. It’s a slog. The synths hurt my ears. It’s ugly.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): what can i say. i saw this anime when I was 14. nostalgia is powerful. This song fueled many of the most annoying people that you've ever met at anime cons. 

 If you extend the trajectory of this song on the rate graph, this might have made Day 2 if we'd extended the deadline to 2028!! 

 user /u/nt96 made a lot of mashups for this rate as their comments - I recommend you check out the one for this one, it's excellent.

---

**pig-serpent** (11): For a while this was the number 1 song of all time according to my RYM friends list.  I kinda want to go back tbh.

**amr** (10): rating the meg cover

**BebeLuigi** (10): BEST ANIME EVER OMGGGGGGGGGG the girls that get it get it etc...

**beeozan** (10): one day I’ll find myself in a denpa rabbithole and come out of it a changed man (for the worse) but until then I can just acknowledge how good this is and consciously decide to stay away

**bogo** (10): you're out of touch

**CrystaltheCool** (10): DARLING DARLING PLEASE!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): it’s camp

**dreamingpastel** (10): No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. Gets the people GOING.

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/SXwcdACEWku76g

**plastichaxan** (10): Now why are these children eating like this ????

**popularsong** (10): the instrumental is so hypnotic and the quick rapping/singing really adds to it im so into this

**PSSST12** (10): Me and my FBI agent having a stare down while this plays in the background:

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Da bass once again!! This whole thing is insane. Screw it, a 10 bestowed

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): an earworm among earworms

**vayyiqra** (10): this is batshit wtf this rules. literally laughed from the sheer unexpectedness of it (hard to explain hope you get it)

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): the trans girls love this. they'll gif spam it and for good reason! it's da greatest ditty of all time!

**mongeese0** (9.8): Absolutely did not let anyone know I liked this when it came out. Has all the weirdness, and then a crazy catchy anthemic part?? A classic

**hacatu** (9.5): Incredibly adorable

**1998tweety** (9): they ate that up

**alexismateofan** (9): its no Out Of Touch Thursday, mind you.

**Awkward\_King** (9): if you asked me to create what i think an anime opening sounds like id create this

**cheatviathan** (9): I adore Lucky Star, but I enjoy it more as a fascinating time capsule from a period of otaku culture I wasn’t a part of rather than as a show that I watch. A real “10/10 would not recommend” for me. This OP is a bop. It has infectious vocal lines and the best bassline of the entire rate. The frantic sax solo in the bridge ties everything together well. I’m happy this got more exposure when #OutOfTouchThursday was the hottest meme in town.

**Poydoo** (9): death note

**vexastrae** (9): [hyperpop enthusiasts rise up](https://twitter.com/OldInternetFeel/status/1665125398777036803)

**Narhun** (8.5): A bit higher than it maybe should get but my boyfriend looks adorable when he dances to it so it gets some bonus points

**Around-town** (8): to my teenage self this wasn't song it was an identity

**dooper8** (8): [Iconic]

**LesApfels** (8): Insert joke about Out of Touch

**macnbee** (8): the power they have...

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This mashup kicks major ass: https://soundcloud.com/dumbshitthatjakazidmade/okkiro-sailor-fuku

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): wait this isnt out of touch

**zadooi** (8): Had to listen to this twice to get over the shock of not hearing Out of Touch

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (7.9): OKAYYYYYY

**Zypker125** (7.6): Lucky Star is another one of the anime that I’m least familiar with on the list. It’s a cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime from the 2000s, which may explain its lack of discussion in the modern times (as the 2010s has had plenty of cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime for anime newcomers to feast on). The opening song is pretty funky and catchy, being very lively and frenetic. Much to my surprise, I’m a fan of how it’s executed here; it executes its infectious-happy-virus concept very well, and it maintains a good sense of flow despite its roller-coaster nature. [Prediction: Day 1]

**Bisonsouro** (7.5): When Thursday hits

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): who up buyin sausage (decade old jokes aside this song SHOULD get old fast but it simply doesn't)

**distressedbeatboxing** (7.1): BUT WHICH ONE IS BEST GIRL????

**DutchPeasant** (7): What a chaotic song this is, especially with the talking whilst the sax goes on a solo. To this show's favour at least.

**phonethephoenix** (7): actually liked this more than I thought but not really my preferred vocal style.

**saturnribbon** (7): okay this kind of slaps

**welcome2thejam** (7): I've seen Out of Touch Thursday so many times it never occured to me that this has an actual theme song behind it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Calling this hyperpop and immediately getting assassinated.

**Dragusken** (6): misheard anime lyrics has ruined this song for me lol

**IIIHenryIII** (6): CARAMELLA GIRLS???

**ricki** (6): im bopping but im a little scared

**seanderlust** (6): happy out of touch thursday

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): NO I am not letting the anime girls win today

**allodude** (4): isn't this the blend s OP?

**apatel27** (4): It's certainly a 00s song

**KuhBus** (4): Off the charts chipmunk energy

**maybecrf** (3): DOING TOO MUCH !!!

**Nagisoid** (3): I feel like I just got assaulted by kindergarteners

**nyoom** (3): anime con flashmob ass music

**saviorARMY101** (3): meh

**TiltControls** (3): change the vocal modulation and this could be a squid sisters song

**horridhendy** (2): I get why people love this but I just find it annoying.

**DraculaWeekend** (1): I did not enjoy this

**ImAWeebDuh** (1): yeah I get why Out of Touch was put over this song

**JIRACHI** (1): ready for the incoming 3+ controversy

**cremeebrulee** (0): what the fuck was that

**indie\_fan\_** (0): oof, well. I hated the first minute of this then it started to get better then the last 10 seconds it reverted back to how it was and got bad again. I can see people loving this for its more quirky nature but that style usually does not appeal to me at all

**Qwilphish** (0): I feel like i'm on drugs

**shhhneak** (0): Nails on a chalkboard.

**bigbigbee** (7): Now here's one of the bigger "crossover" hits of the past 10 years (as in, I think it draws in some non-fans of anime). The premise of this show is better than the reality of it, but I still really like its energy! I'm guessing that it did this poorly because of the singer's vocals; however, I enjoy the semi-gremlin-y energy, tbh.

---

**apatel27** (10): Hype personified

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): WOOOO!!!!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This had no reason to go this hard but I appreciate that it did

**hacatu** (10): The problem with One Punch Man is that it's a transcendent masterpiece that grossly exceeds the huge majority of the shonen it parodies, and the OP is defintely no exception. It's extremely hype without being cliche. Conflict of interest notice: I've seen this anime

**milkywayinradius** (10): ONE PUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCH!!! too hyped now; it's cool, i didn't need to sleep tonight anyway

**saviorARMY101** (10): I WANNA BE THE STRONGEST HEROOOOOOOO!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i personally just think that-ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): and all-time great anime op chorus tbh. hero!!!

**shhhneak** (9.5): Such a shame that there was never a Season 2 and never will be a Season 2 :(((

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**beeozan** (9): **ALL OF THE COCKS TOO MANY COCKS ACTION!!** This is just such an epic performance from these guys and now I feel kinda sad because the main guy who banded the group together passed away last year. R.I.P. check out Ichirou Mizuki dude legit has been singing anime songs since

**nyoom** (9): YEAHHHHH

**pig-serpent** (9): ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 

SIX I really liked the  first season, and there was one moment where Saitama lets himself look like the villain to protect the reputation of every one hero that I thought was really compelling.  Unfortunately, the second season convinced me that the show had run its course and had nothing left to offer me, and no it wasn't just because the animation was worse.

**mongeese0** (8.5): One of the few where it's hard to differentiate the song with the anime. It's like being "in" on the joke

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): He can allegedly defeat every opponent, but he has yet to face the strongest of them all…popheads misandry!

**Dragusken** (8): song packs quite a punch, from the first lyric

**dysphorbs** (8): i wish it wasnt so obviously an anime op bc otherwise it would be p good

**Lynflower680** (8): Not just any hero. The HERO

**macnbee** (8): this song really makes you FEEL like a strong bald man

**saturnribbon** (8): oh this slaps too

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Wanpaaaaaaaach!!!!!!

**Poydoo** (7.6): death note

**TiltControls** (7.5): this could 100% be a fighting game theme song

**bogo** (7): real metal

**wujinan** (7): not as good as everybody says

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): if its really just one punch that sounds like some very uninteresting action scenes

**distressedbeatboxing** (6.5): Eight years ago my friend anonymously left a hundred Saitama faces on a white board in her dorm common room and it went semi-viral on tumblr. Anyway this is pretty okay.

**sarcasticsobs** (6.3): Rock n roll

**cheatviathan** (6): I mean, that intro is a 10/10. When the guitar leads actually manage to punch through, they sound great. I just wish the over the top vocals weren’t overpowering everything in the mix, especially during the chorus. I got the first season on blu ray as a birthday gift, watched the first four episodes, and never got around to finishing it. I probably should revisit this given how hilarious those episodes tended to be.

**popularsong** (6): ig its stylistic but the initial scream feels almost out of tune somehow haha. i dont necessarily dislike metal-type vocals (id give ichirin no hana a 10 if it was on this rate) but im not feeling this song much

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): it gets one point for being kind of different

**impla77** (5.8): Thanks Merty12 and Bruh clan for making subtitles with slightly more clarity than a Taylor Swift lyric video

**flava** (5): Trogdor could probably take him

**seanderlust** (4.5): i just kind of feel like there's a lot going on here and none of it is working particularly well

**alexismateofan** (4): Some of these OPs man I don’t even know. Calling it subpar feels mean but if it fits…

**IIIHenryIII** (4): if Lex and Clark had a baby:

**prettybirbkotori** (4): the first 10 seconds are the only part of this i enjoy

**Qwilphish** (4): the screaming is a lot especially since that's not even the vibe of the show lmfao

**vexastrae** (3.5): sorry to all the rockheads this just isnt my thing

**Awkward\_King** (2): this could just be a black parade song. i also would not like it then but it could

**Nagisoid** (2): Taylor hates this song and I agree with her

**JIRACHI** (1): this was irritating to listen to my ears

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (1): impossible to rate! 1 point!

**Zypker125** (1): OPM, one of the most famous parody anime of the 2010s. True to its name, the anime focuses on a character who is so overpowered he can defeat any supervillain with just one punch. Unfortunately, I never really jived with the jokes in the show, and I don’t jive with the opening either, the use of heavy metal and screamo are annoying to me and the different sections of the song flow really poorly (I have no idea why so many anime fans enjoy this, I get it’s different from the usual J-rock, but different doesn’t always mean good). [Prediction: Day 2]

**horridhendy** (0): Really just not my taste at all.

**maybecrf** (0): what are we doing here, why are we grumbling, why are we screaming, knock it off

**vayyiqra** (0): yeah i said elsewhere i don't tend to like metal-ish anime themes and this kind of cheesy power metal and its vocals is aggressively not working for me rn i hate this

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I'm sure this show is good! I've heard good things, but this opening just does nothing for me. GET OUT OF HERE TRUSCUM I guess, but other than that I even struggle to really remember what it sounds like. Sorry!

**bigbigbee** (6.5): the devil is actually a full time employee (my boss's boss) 

 This song was always Day 1, from the very first ballot. lol! Sorry to the show, which seems like it has a fun premise (see Zypker125's comment for a good description!)

---

**RandomHypnotica** (10): absolutely not, this is a TEN!!

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**dreamingpastel** (9): Ba da ba ba ba I'm lovin' it

**sarcasticsobs** (9): What I'm gathering is that the Devil does not have health insurance or a 401k. Risky move in this economy!

**seanderlust** (9): ...okay again, yes i see the joke. don't do it ph

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is so doomed from the name omfg [cut to it getting no zeroes]

**saviorARMY101** (8): A bop

**TiltControls** (8): well it's not a zero

**Zypker125** (8): One of the most popular and notorious genres found in anime is the Isekai genre, where “a character is suddenly transported from their world into a new/unfamiliar one.” Usually, isekai anime consist of “a self-insert character transported from Earth into a fantasy world (usually with cute girls/boys who follow the main character on their adventures”. The Devil is a Part-Timer is a subversion of this trope by having the main character be a demon from a fantasy world who gets transported into Earth, and the anime follows his subsequent adjustment to our world and the many hijinks that come with it. This was one of the more surprising inclusions to me, tbh; while the anime is very popular, it’s not as popular as a lot of the other anime on this list and I personally haven’t heard much about the opening specifically. For me personally, the opening is quite pleasant to listen to, but the chorus doesn’t hit as hard as it should for me, but I like the “hopeful” energy the song brings, and the overall direction of this song is quite good. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): catchy!

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (7.9): sleeper

**impla77** (7.6): why do they keep stubbing their toes

**vexastrae** (7.5): hes a part-timer. he wears prada. he gets lap dances by lil nas x

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): You don’t have to be a part time Devil…

**cheatviathan** (7): It is just now, listening with a critical ear, that I notice those high pitched synths wailing in the back on the chorus, contributing nothing to the song. Everything else is great enough to distract me from that, though. TRUUUUUUUUUE SKYYYYYYYYYYYYY.

**Dragusken** (7): it's not a zero!

**IIIHenryIII** (7): SEVEN!!

**plastichaxan** (7): That is such a slay title

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): SEVEN!!

**vayyiqra** (7): ‼️

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's okaaaay but not something I'd put in a best anime OPs compilation, you know?

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): ended newjeans but not the yeah yeah yeahs

**nyoom** (6): the devil is kept an independent contracter to deny him insurance

**prettybirbkotori** (6): plain but not bad

**Qwilphish** (6): I like her energy even though she is the same as others

**welcome2thejam** (6): Me too

**wujinan** (6): i sleep

**Poydoo** (5.5): death note

**apatel27** (5): Eh

**bogo** (5): FIVE!!

**Nagisoid** (5): GET OUT OF HERE TRUSCUM!!!

**pig-serpent** (5): I feel obligated to talk about every song for every show I'm reviewing but I'm regretting that because some of these songs really give me a "no thoughts head empty" feeling. 

 One of the first shows I remember watching when I started my high school anime phase.  I liked it at the time but idk how well it would hold up.  I guess it's the perfect time to go back to it, with season 2 coming out soon and all.

**alexismateofan** (4): I just felt UGH listening to it. Not bad but still like can we move on.

**ImAWeebDuh** (4): if this were more memorably bad, i’m sure someone would make a good joke using the title

**macnbee** (4): the songs later on this list alphabetically are at a disadvantage bc at a certain point i'm just like fatigued by Anime Music

**beeozan** (1): get out of gaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy. this is my nomination for the worst vocals in the rate tbh they instantly activate my fight or flight mechanism.

**maybecrf** (1): im being punished right now by having to listen to this nothing of an intro

**bigbigbee** (10): OMG I LOOOOOOOOOVE <3 <3 <3 I'm a proud member of the One Piece/Naruto/Bleach generation, you kids need to sit DOWN and respect!!!!! The seiyuu covers of all of the OPs/EDs...to me, that's music. This was the winner for a brief and beautiful moment after I submitted my ballot, since both Rona and I love it so much.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Perhaps the most painful day1 cut for the hosts, as we both have somewhat shown to be huge fans of both Bleach (clock the playlist cover) and of this song. I don't know, like with everything about it I just find that it oozes cool. The way the chorus crashes, the even the rap verse I've absolutely grown into loving. We'll miss you, but you'll forever be eternalized in the popheads spotify. RIP O7

---

**popularsong** (11): immediately sooo nostalgic. it's a testament to this song that im still not sick of it more than a decade later. the verses, the chorus... sound of the summer idc. bleach has loads of fantastic op/eds and i love the seiyuu covers too ugh shaped my childhood music taste for sure

**xavieryes** (11): one of the most nostalgic songs in existence for me

**alexismateofan** (10): ABSOLUTE FUCKING BANGER OF AN OP. this is where anime OPs peaked. Bleach really picked some goddamn good ones. I need an Anime ED rating next because I know Bleach will also sweep there.

**allodude** (10): I remember downloading this song off mIRC

**amr** (10): god be giving anybody (tite kubo) excellent art ability

**MrMushrooms** (10): My entire life I thought they were spelling out G-O-O-D-Y...

**TiltControls** (9.5): Oh I love the vibe on this one. Whoever is on that guitar carries hard

**pheromenos** (9.3): waittt i don't even watch the show but this is a legit SONG it's so good

**mongeese0** (9): I still love the sung parts, but the rapping parts feel a little dated now

**pig-serpent** (9): This is actually very good.  It feels very modern to its time, slotting right in with the softer alt rock of the late 90s while adding in a tasteful hip hop flare and including synths that remind me of some of the post-britpop coming out around then too.  Despite all that, it doesn't sound dated.  I'm very impressed that this song was written for Bleach of all things.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I feel like you could just call this rate "Emo Rate 4 J-Rock Edition" and you could get the same point across

**nt96** (8.8): the linkin park print

**1998tweety** (8): this isn't as good as I remembered but it is still very iconic

**DutchPeasant** (8): Ah nostalgia the song, it sure is lovely to reminiscence on Bleach. Not even that special of a song, but that early 00s sound does make it keep a special place in my heart.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): iconic

**indie\_fan\_** (8): D-Tecnolife woulda been the 11 tho

**JIRACHI** (8): was the production really that bad or was the video just very old? we will never find out

**nyoom** (8): i actually think this sounds more like naruto and the naruto one more like bleach but what do i know, i never watched either

**welcome2thejam** (8): Okay no really, is this shoegaze?

**wujinan** (8): big orange range fan

**phonethephoenix** (7.7): I like the overall sound but it's a bit repetitive

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): why don't they make music like this anymore

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): I feel like this screams 2000s anime opening theme

**Awkward\_King** (7): this is the most mid 00s opening ive ever seen in my life and just for that i wanna love it

**cremeebrulee** (7): ended ipr

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): never watched much of this older show. This is cool

**Dragusken** (7): say you're edgy without saying you're edgy

**Poydoo** (7): The guitar is really cool but is there not a higher quality rip anywhere????

**shhhneak** (7): I have such a love/hate relationship with Bleach. There’s far too many characters and the plot is pretty bad but it’s just COOL. The art and character designs are timelessly cool.

**vexastrae** (7): this OP makes me feel like im watching an ancient 2000s era amv

**beeozan** (6): as someone coming into this with zero nostalgia for Bleach, this kinda beat my expectations, their non-existing rap flow is actually kinda fun to listen to and the beating synth in the back is quirkyyy. These guys were the rock version of NCT we didn’t know existed 15 years before NCT which is crazy.

**bogo** (6): i got nothing idk lemme just call this shoegaze (it's not)

**cheatviathan** (6): Some interesting synthwork and sweet flows that are ultimately held back by that “One Week”-ass St. Anger-ass snare drum.

**hacatu** (6): Fine, but pretty dated and the youtube video doesn't seem very high quality

**macnbee** (6): i think i'd like it better if i were a bleach girlie but naruto forever

**sarcasticsobs** (6): This fuckin' guy again

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): Not sure if it's the quality of the YouTube upload but somehow it sounds like it was mixed in a dishwasher

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this is bottom 5 coded

**AmandaYoung2083** (5): Just like Orihime x Ulquiorra 5ever!

**Around-town** (5): nothing wrong with it, it's just forgettable

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (5): damn I watched part of the zanpakuto era and then I hear this and I just know im neva gonna watch those first 60 episodes now!

**apatel27** (4): Not sure if it's due to an old upload but the mixing is so bad

**BebeLuigi** (4): RANBU NO MELODY????? SHOUJO S?????

**maybecrf** (4): cool concept, ugly noise

**Qwilphish** (4): the chokehold that this style of rap had on anime in this era... it needs to be studied

**Nagisoid** (3): Aggresively 2000s

**ricki** (3): okay flash animation i see you

**vayyiqra** (3): this show confuses me never seen it what the hell is it even about but this is alright i guess [update: upon relistening the intro sounds like shit wtf the production on the drums is awful and the guitar isn't great either. what a mess]

**DaswefSayLazy** (1): wow this is really bad, sorry bleach fans

**flava** (1): is this a Gorillaz song?

**MrSwearword** (1): eww this is horrifically sung

**ImAWeebDuh** (0): this is so bad and for such different reasons

**RandomHypnotica** (0): ?

**Zypker125** (0): Bleach is one of the “Big 3” shounen (which is “anime focused to the younger male demographic, usually consisting of heavy action”), along with Naruto and One Piece. It’s arguably lesser-known in the international spheres compared to those two (at least, based on the circles I frequent), but it’s nonetheless extremely popular and one of the most popular anime of all time. However, this was an opening from 2004, and it sounds like it was made in a decrepit basement during the 1960s. The audio and mixing are quite terrible, and the transitions between the vocals and the talk-rap sections are terrible. None of the elements flow together, and the song is a complete jumbled mess. An easy 0 choice for me. [Prediction: Bottom 5]

hyogurt: Genuinely disturbed by this outcome... but I also hold myself accountable for not finishing my ballot in time. Maybe people just had to be there at the time to know the chokehold this had on the anime community in the mid-2000s, and for good reason.

This should have survived until the top 10, if not top 5. Then again, I feel like [Opening 10](https://twitter.com/wangjipng/status/1240305825501118465) or [Opening 13](https://twitter.com/wangjipng/status/1240307919964553216) would have performed much better in this subreddit, as u/BebeLuigi alluded to.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Listen, Fairy Tail is THE generic shounen, you guys better show it some damn respect. The OH YEAHs really add a lot to it, especially in a show that's a lot about power of friendship to the max and all that. Maybe nostalgia goggles are also in play, but this absolutely is up my alley, especially the random guitar solo at the end. Far too early out, but that goes for many of the songs today.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I was a little surprised to see this song do as badly as it did - it feels generic shonen opening, but not in a bad way to me. But nope, this was solidly Day 1 for basically the entire rate.

---

**pheromenos** (11): nakama power!!!!

**phonethephoenix** (10): the flute!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): LFG!!!!! I trust Erza Scarlet with my life!!!!!

**TiltControls** (10): Oh yeah!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the anime looks just as good as the song

**BebeLuigi** (9): This is so emotional to me you know

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): bop!

**Dragusken** (9): sounds classic shounen but still keeps up the joyful vibes

**dreamingpastel** (9): Fun flute!

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**Awkward\_King** (8): that guy was hot

**DaswefSayLazy** (8): the flute tones are a nice unique thing

**Senn\_Kyu** (8): i'm a sucker for Oh Yeahs

**welcome2thejam** (8): Has a classic "we're going on a big adventure!" vibe I quite like. Love the gang vocals on the "oh yeah!"

**seanderlust** (7.5): shoutout to the person i knew irl who was a fan of fairy tale but was always embarrassed to say so because it has "fairy" in the title...hope you're doing better bud

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): the best parts are whenever the flute player goes off

**cheatviathan** (7): I dig those woodwinds, and the slight difference in rhythm between the verses and choruses. The vocals and melodies are kind of eh, but this is still a good vibe nonetheless.

**prettybirbkotori** (7): you do not under any circumstances have to hand it to fairy tail but this is pretty good. the BOA opening is superior tho

**impla77** (6.7): My sister had a ‘Ezra Scarlet is my spirit animal’ jumper, and I don’t know enough about this show to tell me what that says about her

**nyoom** (6.5): within the first 5 seconds of this opening i could already tell this show contains the character "old man who is a gross pervert but the viewer is supposed to like him" and i KNOW it's the one in the stupid hat

**wujinan** (6.5): loved this song but doesn't hold up

**macnbee** (6): i wanted to use the joke "fairy fail" but it's actually fine

**maybecrf** (6): the song is fine, but can we talk about how hot natsu is

**Qwilphish** (6): not the most original song in this rate, but she's cute

**saviorARMY101** (6): a decent song though I enjoyed the use of a flute in the background

**vayyiqra** (6): omg i love snow halation

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is indeed… exactly how I expected a Fairy Tail theme to sound…

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (6): tried to watch the pilot of this subbed at comic con 2k12 and got 12 minutes in and gave up. i am giving up again

**Zypker125** (5.8): Fairy Tail is another popular shounen anime amongst younger males, although its overall reception amongst the wider anime base is much more divisive. Onto the song; it’s nice, but nothing I’d write home about. I feel like the instrumental should be going a lot harder, but it feels restrained, and as a result the song lacks the hard-hitting impact I’m looking for. I’m also not a fan of the vocal delivery from the singer, and his vocal color is not my favorite. [Prediction: Day 1]

**mongeese0** (5): Found myself rolling my eyes a bit at the "Oh yeah!"s

**ricki** (5): I KNOW THAT BLUE CAT

**alexismateofan** (4): Music that would fit an early 2000s anime more (derogatory)

**AmandaYoung2083** (4): Where's Fiesta smh

**apatel27** (4): pls don't call and response in a song

**plastichaxan** (4): When I say a canadian gay:

**Poydoo** (4): death note

**vexastrae** (4): i watched a fuckton of this as a kid and yet i do not remember this op at all

**hacatu** (3): I was offended by how low effort this was. The music is bad, and the video looks like a moderately talanted eleven year old's dnd themed parody of something

**pig-serpent** (3): I've always been under the impression that Fairy Tail was the kind of shonen that had nothing to offer anyone over the age of 10, and this song isn't changing my perception at all.

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (3): girl who let the kool aid man in the studio

**beeozan** (1): how does this have every marker of zero bait. it's crazy. love crazy! jk we already had the Sticker of anime rate when the bleach opening played, this isnt even camp good. What is camp is that apparently their guitarist is called JOTARO (all caps). is that a mfin jojo reference=!?? If you like to torture yourself you can find the full cut on spotify and listen to it like I'm doing rn. Nostalgia is mad powerful

**Nagisoid** (1): Bad instrumental, bad vocals, bad show, bad production, bad lyrics, it should be illegal to tack this many struggles into a ditty

**bigbigbee** (6): It's a rare anime that comes along and I'm like oh wait, men thought that THAT would appeal to the general audience of teenage boys? In this case, it's when the main character doesn't know how to do anything so she pee pees herself on the floor. 

 Surprisingly, this song was less controversial than I was expecting, though still more controversial than the rate average (2.5 vs 2). I completely get why some people love it (I actually love opera, though this song doesn't do it for me AS much) and I completely get why people find it boring, as well.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Big boobs?

---

**Bisonsouro** (11): The sweet siren song that drives sailors into watching Elfen Lied

**flava** (10): Debussy hasnt released anything since this dropped, i think that says something about how good this is

**maybecrf** (10): gothic opera over a landscape of titties, work

**MrSwearword** (10): an absolute slay

**Nagisoid** (10): Served Lingua Ignota, traumatized children and died. Iconic misheard line: "I need to poo, your butt is funny, oh no now we die"

**nt96** (10): throwback to 12 year old me watching the first episode on youtube where it was spilt into 3-6 videos with over half of them being blacked out due to nudity

**plastichaxan** (10): They went full on the art references and even got Lingua Ignota for the song I respect that

**popularsong** (10): another one of "detest the anime but damn the opening is a slapper"

**Poydoo** (10): booba

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This is such a beautiful theme. Love the opera/classical feeling of this one.

**PSSST12** (10): We love Church Music

**vayyiqra** (10): i know it's a classic pleb filter but i watched the first episode of this and was so put off by the gore and creepiness i didn't watch the rest but hey i was in a bad headspace at the time ! (very depressed). this is a great theme though quite beautiful and hearkens back to my churchgoing days of my youth (better than it sounds, catholic masses are short and the music kind of slaps). show still kind of creeps me out but whatever. here's an anecdote: one time i was on a long bus ride around town and randomly felt like listening to this theme so i did. someone (memory hazy) i got into a convo with a girl sitting near me about anime. she was, no word of a lie, wearing cat ears and kept calling herself a neko but pronounced it like /niko/ even though i tried to subtly hint the right way to say it is /neko/. after a while it got awkward and i didn't know how to get away because she wanted to talk at (not to, talk at) me about anime i'd never heard of. awkward interaction

**villblomst** (10): god, slayed

**xavieryes** (10): I can't tell if this song is extremely deceiving or if it fits the vibe of the anime itself perfectly

**shhhneak** (9.5): Angelic choral voices and Gustav Klimt? Two of my favourite genres of art joint slay.

**1998tweety** (9): she ate this

**apatel27** (9): Pretty

**DutchPeasant** (9): Stands very much out because of its style, maybe it ranks even higher because of it. Regardless, it's a very beautiful song.

**hacatu** (9): Genuinely good

**phonethephoenix** (9): I mean! nice vocals! idk!

**agnes\_honey** (8.5): wtf is this? I love it

**BebeLuigi** (8): The only thing worth watching in this anime

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): between eurovision, drag rate and now anime rate, why does every media-related grab bag rate have 1 opera track lkdslkdklslsk

**Dragusken** (8): never thought i'd like anything close to opera but oh well, i lied

**impla77** (8): Was gonna talk about Klimt but then I got distracted by tits

**KuhBus** (8): ART

**mongeese0** (8): Wow, what a risk. I don't totally love the track, but totally respect it. And all that Klimt-inspired art. Wtf is this show even about

**pig-serpent** (8): Going for the full on classical op is a bold choice I respect deeply.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Somber!

**saviorARMY101** (8): a very hauntingly beautiful yet melancholic opening theme that I think does a good job of showing the dark tone of the show

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): throwback to when i was first learning about anime as a kid and went onto netflix to see if they had any anime available and the first one i saw being advertised was elfen lied and me, being 9 and not knowing any better, started watching it. i did not watch anime for a while after that.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Wow! This doesn't sound happy!

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): ended nbpq topless

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): this feels more like an ending song than an opening

**TiltControls** (7.5): complete 180 vibe from the rest of the rate lmao

**wujinan** (7.5): banger

**amr** (7): for effort

**CrystaltheCool** (7): how does this anime have this OP

**ImAWeebDuh** (7): she was in her monet x change bag with this one

**Qwilphish** (7): I really respect this eerie opera choice

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): Drew like a dark, fucked up version of the chobits girl. Just a glimpse into my dark reality

**vexastrae** (7): BOOBIES!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Okay that’s different.

**seanderlust** (6.5): i can't shake ass to this

**beeozan** (6): titties. it's weird how there are a bunch of uploads of this opening's "full version" on youtube but they all have a clearly edited fade out fade in moment and no one tried to salvage the shitty editing and reuploaded a better version. So I looked it up and there is no mention of a full version existing on the discographies of the composers. I did find a slightly longer violin version that replaces the vocals with violin and that goes hard. There is also a 2015 arrangement that's like almost 5 minutes but it's not as good. I looked into this way too much for a song that I don't particularly even care about, but I did use to think this was the best anime op ever damn I was an annoying nerd (still am annoying nerd)

**prettybirbkotori** (6): there's no way it's that serious. it's pretty i guess but. yawn

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (6): this intro is just porno

**allodude** (5): what can you even say about this show

**cheatviathan** (5): I am going to commit a balladphobia with this one. This one just kind of bored me. I’m sure it works better in the context of the show, but it’s not that interesting to me outside of it.

**horridhendy** (5): I get why this is considered a classic but as a song, it doesn’t do much for me.

**macnbee** (5): when i was 11 i watched an amv of this show set to rosemary's baby by fantômas and i think it was the first time i felt true fear

**ricki** (5): okay titties i see you

**welcome2thejam** (5): Guessing it might work better in context

AnimeOPsRate: **RandomHypnotica** (4.5): girl i was so bored

**distressedbeatboxing** (4): Well, I'm sure it's great in the context of the plot.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): this is the most boring opening I’ve seen and the song ain’t helping

**bogo** (3): sorry i'm gay

**Zypker125** (2.5): Elfen Lied is arguably the most divisive anime of the 21st century. Some view it as an edgy, pretentious anime pretending to have deeper themes where it doesn’t exist, while others view it as an avant-garde, rich-with-symbolism mastercraft. I haven’t watched it, but based on my dislike of avant-garde, I’m fairly sure I’d fall in the former camp, which is why I haven’t started it yet. Onto the song; it’s really boring. Sad opera makes me want to fall asleep, and that’s meant as a point against this song. The song doesn’t go anywhere either and the lack of a chorus massively hurts this song. [Prediction: Day 1]

**alexismateofan** (2): Kind of the worst 1 minute and 30 seconds of my day without question.

**LesApfels** (2): Loved the art references in the opening tho

**nyoom** (2): this is for perverts and not even in a fun way

**Awkward\_King** (1): this is the anime opening themes rate idgaf about medieval bard music

**Roxieloxie** (1): what?

**DraculaWeekend** (0): This made me uneasy

**evanbrooks324** (0): hate everything about this reminds me of church

**milkywayinradius** (0): song was boring but i wonder the reasoning behind having the main character be nude?

**bigbigbee** (8): I just know that the singer of this song has an incredible mullet (HOST UPDATE: I was wrong. His guitarist DOES have an incredible mullet tho). 

 This one fell to Day 3 about halfway through the rate and never recovered. I like it a lot - as one commenter said, it makes me nostalgic for something I didn't even experience - but I get that its old style (and audio quality) were points of issue for some raters.

---

**Poydoo** (10): penis

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): (latinx) cousins music

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): Nah bc why the hell does the YouTube upload of this theme song from 1996 sound like it was recorded in 1986 💀

**Bisonsouro** (9): Nostalgic

**DraculaWeekend** (9): This made me emotional and idk why

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I honestly can’t comprehend how I’ve managed to not watch a single Dragon Ball episode my entire life; it was so huge and such a big deal within my cousins and classmates.

**KuhBus** (9): iconic, beautiful intro that due to nostalgia hits harder (for me) in German

**Nagisoid** (9): Would be better if the sound quality wasn't recorded in a nuclear fallout shelter

**Senn\_Kyu** (9): sound of nostalgia tbh

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): i like the tune!

**cremeebrulee** (8): ended my vcr

**hacatu** (8): Shockingly good considering it came from Dragon Ball

**saturnribbon** (8): really love the 90s feel

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**Qwilphish** (7.5): this soft rock genre is getting me together. makes me feel nostalgic for an era i never lived through

**TiltControls** (7.5): I always got home too late for Dragon Ball so I never got into it like some of my friends did

**vexastrae** (7.5): Lady Gaga Tried to Investigate The Dragon Balls Herself—'I Looked For Evidence'

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): shout out to my one friend in high school who loved DBZ more than anything

**Dragusken** (7): kinda done done with this one

**macnbee** (7): feels a little understated for dragon ball but still solid

**maybecrf** (7): i dont know if the sound quality was a choice or just part of the era, but its kind of giving

**plastichaxan** (7): Oh they were fr going after dragon balls???

**prettybirbkotori** (7): i love how utterly 90s this is

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Neva watched this one but idk it's cute

**welcome2thejam** (7): Didn't match what little knowledge I have of Dragon Ball Z, and no idea why the nudity went that long, but still good

**wujinan** (7): aged but classic

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): time has not been kind to this I fear

**pig-serpent** (6.5): lmao this sounds like a 1960s song.  I love how bright the chorus is, and the various licks do a great job of building momentum and power that you'd expect for Dragonball, but that verse is weaksauce.

**beeozan** (6.2): this half shonen pop rock half post-idol pop rock christmas song is going to get Charli XCX - Taxi'd a bit and it's fine I guess. They were kinda proto Asian Kung-Fu Generation for this cut but not as angry, skilled or charming. Speaking of, AKG not being in the rate is one of the bigger crimes of this ordeal

**Zypker125** (6.1): IT’S OVER ~~EIGHT~~ NINE THOUSAND! ~~Real weebs will get that joke I just made~~ Dragon Ball is another classic shounen anime of many Gen X’s childhood, but since I’m one of those damn young’ins, Dragon Ball was before my time. However, this song is pretty nice. The vocals are pretty soothing and clear, and the instrumental does its job, even if its quite repetitive. Unfortunately, the song audio-wise definitely shows its age, so it gets marked down some points. [Prediction: Day 1]

**apatel27** (6): Should've been Cha la head cha la

**bogo** (6): why does this sound like it's playing from a vintage radio

**cheatviathan** (6): I’m not sure why this isn’t hitting for me the same way some of the other older OPs are. Maybe it’s the lack of any memorable vocal melody. I don’t know.

**nyoom** (6): this is not inspiring me to go super saiyan

**ricki** (6): why is he buttnaked

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Cheesy as hell, Cha-La Head Cha-La easily outsold

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): why is the quality of this as if it was recorded in the 40s

**alexismateofan** (5): you could play this again for me in like 10 minutes and i would not even be able to tell you what anime it was for.

**horridhendy** (5): I just don’t have the nostalgia goggles on this one.

**mongeese0** (5): Trunks is still the coolest mfer alive. Feels like a song for karaoke

**MrSwearword** (5): considering how legendary this franchise is, this theme kind of sucks

**saviorARMY101** (5): I’m sure this is the type of song that makes everyone nostalgic, but since I didn’t grow up with DB I just don’t feel the same way :/

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (5): i have never in my life watched an episode of dragon ball and i dont care about this song

**allodude** (4): man what even was DB GT

**Narhun** (4): not me punishing the song for the terrible sound quality

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is so ridiculously corny

**vayyiqra** (4): if i heard this with no context and you told me it's a dragon ball theme i wouldn't believe it but here we are. vintage anime themes were different i guess

**shhhneak** (3): Dragon Ball is a blind spot in my pop culture knowledge but I must say I’ve never wanted to chase that dragon.

**flava** (1): oh neptune, my ears

**bigbigbee** (6): OH this sounds JUST like an advertisement for a local water park that used to play when I was kid

---

1998tweety (10): bop, and the rap??? ENDED Kendrick Lamar

allodude (10): the only dub OP I wasn't familiar with, but I'm speechless

impla77 (10): The 3d animation dinosaurs💀

RandomHypnotica (10): kendrick wishes he had bars like this

ricki (10): okayyyy cgi i see you

seanderlust (9.5): these fossils are colossal!

Zypker125 (9.5): Now this is a catchy song, hell yeah. Gives me Power Rangers energy, and I mean that in the best way possible. That rap is absolute flames.

BleepBloopMusicFan (9): Artistic boundaries are being explored and pushed here.

hacatu (9): "The Past is in the Present" is a lyric from the future, no doubt about it

nyoom (9): this feels like watching a stranger crash your party and absolutely tear up the dance floor, like wow great but who are you???

Senn\_Kyu (9): kid's toy commercial jingle perfected

TiltControls (9): if this came out when I was 5 I would've been all over this

Narhun (8): okay why are all the 4Kids ops this good

nt96 (8): We have Pokémon, Yu Gi Oh and Digimon at home

Poydoo (8): Is this that one song from the fight scene with the guards from shrek

Qwilphish (8): camp

saviorARMY101 (8): A jam

shhhneak (7.9): Oh I definitely had a crush on this protagonist

PrimaryCrusaders (7.5): I love the big bombastic orchestral/rap bridge but then the final chorus is just... Instant whiplash lol.

agnes\_honey (7): shook memory unlocked

Bisonsouro (7): cute

dreamingpastel (7): Did 4kids get the same guy who sung the Pokemon Battle Frontier theme song to sing this? Or am I just thinking that because it sounds exactly like that song? The attempt at a rap verse or something is tragic though.

welcome2thejam (7): Damn this guy's got bars, go off Dinosaur King

IIIHenryIII (6.5): this one is very catchy

krusso1105 (6.5): I have literally never heard of this show please tell me the awful cg is in the actual show

bigbigbee (6): OH this sounds JUST like an advertisement for a local water park that used to play when I was kid

Dragusken (6): 4Kids really likes slow rap to animated chibi creatures huh…

pig-serpent (6): That Juxtaposition is so funny

static\_int\_husp (6): the first half goes hard, the second is a bit eh

AmandaYoung2083 (5): I have literally never heard of this before? What alternate universe did this come from

macnbee (5): i literally love the art style

phonethephoenix (5): it's cute! a bit too sing-songy and repetitive though

Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc (5): this is a burger joint jingle

imasalesman (4): camp

maybecrf (4): i dont know whats worse, the cgi dinosaur or the 4kids vocals

Nagisoid (4): I watched this when I was like 6 and I still have recurring nightmares from the prehistoric CGI

vayyiqra (4): eh don't like it, forgettable

alexismateofan (3): oh god some of these OPs are just SO bad.

bogo (3): ugh

DraculaWeekend (3): What is this

TakeOnMeByA-ha (3): i’ve literally never heard of this show in my life. im convinced you guys made this up for this rate

Verboten\_Prince (3): The fuck is this

indie\_fan\_ (2): first of all, i saw 0:11 of the opening linked on the post and thought i was in for a beyblade knockoff. Which might i add beyblade was kinda robbed from having a spot here. 2nd, I'm going to assume based the interesting dinosaur animations that this anime was made for a far younger audience than myself. 3rd, apart from the animation the nick jr. ass nature of this song is not convincing me any more to try to watch this show

distressedbeatboxing (1): EW

milkywayinradius (1): what the hell is this song; WHY DO WE LET THEM MUSICALLY PATRONIZE CHILDREN

sarcasticsobs (1): WhAT is going on here?

**bigbigbee** (10): Aww, this song's gradual fall from Day 3, to Day 2, down to here in Day 1, makes me sad. :( I think that this song is amazing, even if anime fans suddenly having strong opinions on actual figure skating at the 2018 Olympics drove me nuts (I never said I wasn't petty). 

 I love a song in waltz time, and the sentiment "we were born to make history" is just lovely. I agree with commenters describing it as "epic" and "theatrical" - though I can see why that's divisive on a pop music subreddit. I was actually getting emotional watching this - the opening as a whole is such a celebration of music, and dance, and skating as art - I just love that. 🥰

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Oh, people are going to be mad at this one. I'll be honest, there is so much to love in this song- both the context of being born to make history in the context of the show but also just it standing as the main gay anime for a while, truly making history and marking its ground in the genre. While I can't say I don't get why this is so low, I do wish it was a bit higher. Maybe the true history were the friends we made along the way?

---

**bogo** (11): my gay ass can't resist this

**1998tweety** (10): another gay BOP

**alexismateofan** (10): holy shit sports animes really overpower in terms of raw power in their song choices (KnB this isn’t talking about you)

**apatel27** (10): Gay Rights!

**BebeLuigi** (10): gay people

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song might actually be bad tbh but it’s sure getting the serotonin flowing rn.

**horridhendy** (10): Obsessed with this song. Had it on repeat after I heard it. I wish I could give this an 11 too…

**Lynflower680** (10): Y’all don’t know how meaningful this song was to 14 year old me who had just accepted her sexuality.

**Nagisoid** (10): HERSTORY MAKER 🏳️‍🌈

**pheromenos** (10): isn't this a very yaoi-y anime

**phonethephoenix** (10): WE WERE BORN TO MAKE HISTORY

**Qwilphish** (10): and make history it did

**Zypker125** (10): Yuri on Ice was arguably one of the first popular “boys’ love” anime, making its mark in anime fandom when it notoriously won the Crunchyroll Awards’s (the biggest anime awards) Anime of the Year in 2016, over more-popular-and-more-highly-received anime such as Re:Zero, Mob Psycho 100, KonoSuba, Jojo Part IV, Rakugo Shinjuu, and Haikyuu. While I admittedly haven’t watched this anime yet, this opening is a huge banger. It’s epic, it’s cinematic, it’s theatrical, it’s unique, and it’s energetic. The full-English delivery definitely adds to the memorability for me as well, but I think all the musical elements here are simply spectacular. This was a HEAVY 11 contender for me, but alas, Your Lie In April’s opening captured my heart the most; still, I absolutely love this song and think it deserves to be in the pantheon of best anime openings. [Prediction: Day 1] (unfortunately)

**TiltControls** (9.5): this is the exact type of thing I'd expect from a figure skating anime (complimentary). It sounds like some forgotten inspirational winter olympic theme song

**mongeese0** (9.3): is it bad that the production reminds me of a coldplay song now?

**saturnribbon** (9): I’ve always really liked how ice skatey this sounds… does that make sense

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Not the youtube comments about the movie dated 2 years ago… man

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Sounds like something that would make it into the Top 5 in Eurovision.

**babadork** (8): Is this not supposed to be about lesbians?

**nyoom** (8): i was at a party once where i overheard a girl telling someone "if you liked yuri on ice you'll love killing stalking" and i have not known peace since

**saviorARMY101** (8): I like how grand and epic this feels

**shhhneak** (7.9): Slayed but cringe. Slange. Also wasn’t S2 supposed to be out like two US presidents ago??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): yuri on ice stans are some of the most insufferable fans in all of anime and the discourse around this show and whether or not its queerbaiting was one of the lowest points in all of anime fandom discussion, but yeah this is a good op

**Dragusken** (7): have you heard of yaoi on fire?

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): i feel the need to say the f word

**beeozan** (6.9): i was too straight to indulge in all the discourse surrounding this show in 2016 but I cant help the song from bopping. This invented epic house or whatever this is. also can we appreciate how good the english singing is like the pronunciations are almost 100% right that’s crazy for an anime op

**hacatu** (6.5): Perfectly ok, the vocals and music are both good but it manages to be repetitive even thought it's so short

**Poydoo** (6): I wonder what they were born for

**welcome2thejam** (6): TBH I prefer the live action English adaptation Hallmark Channel did

**wujinan** (6): boring

**macnbee** (5): the best song from this show is theme of king jj; listen to that instead

**maybecrf** (5): its giving gay zedd - clarity, and idk who asked for that

**popularsong** (5): i feel homophobic for this but im not liking this much takes a while to build up and the build up isnt particularly good

**zadooi** (5): I'm sorry fujoshis

**prettybirbkotori** (4.5): why does this sound like a fun. song. how can i blame this on jack antonoff

**cheatviathan** (4): The EDM style drums and buildup clash hard with the pumping strings, and on whole, this type of overblown yet generic empowerment anthem was always going to be a nonstarter for me. If you’re going to take this lyrical route, can you actually come through with an instrumental that doesn’t sound gutless?

**seanderlust** (3.5): Why is it named yuri on ice and there's a man singing…not even yuri can pass the Bechdel test :pensive:

**impla77** (3): no this sounds like a eurovision song gfdsg

**JIRACHI** (3): you could tell me that this song is from a drag race rusical and i'd believe you

**pig-serpent** (3): I like the soft theatrical vibe it starts with but the payoff is too overproduced and I'm not a fan of the vocals on this one, so there's nothing here that makes the song worth listening to for me.

**ricki** (3): one of the best animation in this entire rate but this song is straight doodoo

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Uh hu

**vayyiqra** (3): wtf is this it's going for bombastic and uplifting but i do not like it

**vexastrae** (2.5): unfortunately this doesnt do anything for me

**dysphorbs** (2): inspirational song from a feel good inoffensive broadway musical (derogatory)

**RandomHypnotica** (2): why does the gayest anime in history have imagine dragons core as the OP

**ImAWeebDuh** (1): now what kind of terrible genre mashup is this

**MrSwearword** (1): I can hear the singer's heartbeat and their being offkey

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (1): yo wait why is this in english? like I thought that was quarantined to the bonus? this got in over trigun?!? they grunt in japanese in that theme?!!? therefore, this 3.8/10 is docked to a 1/10. it already sucked by i wanted to hear japanese language enunciations, NOT english language enunciations in the main rate!

**Awkward\_King** (0): no. nononononon no no no. noooooooo. i hate this

**IIIHenryIII** (0): my inner child is screaming right now. I was obsessed with ice skating as a kid even though I never had the chance to try it. I remember watching the Winter Games and the Olympics just to see those phenomenal athletes float on ice and be amazed by their smooth moves. I’ll be adding this one to my watchlist. Now let me talk about the song. Well… it is trash.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): eeeeeeeee!!!

**prettybirbkotori** (10): i may not like this show but i am an fhana stan first and a hater second

**Zypker125** (9.5): One of the most popular CGDCT (cute girls doing cute things) and SoL (slice of life) anime of the 2010s is here! The opening is a cute burst of energy, completely infectious with happiness and bright power. The singer brings her absolute 120% with her vocal delivery, and the fast-singing in the chorus is an absolutely based choice. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): why does certain jpop love to use that christmas bell sound

**1998tweety** (9): fhana slays

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Big boobs??

**alexismateofan** (8): those people spinning in the OP? That’s me every day of my life. Spin. Spiiiiiiiiin.

**ImAWeebDuh** (8): a fun song but this anime title activated my fight or flight response

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Oh, SHE's the dragon. Rad.

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (7.8): it's so bright i might asplode! the t-pose and dragon wiggle is cute

**beeozan** (7.5): an abomination of a show and when they start spin floating in the op its really creepy but like this song is such a bop, or at least I’ve realized that when I started not minding the vocalist’s voice.

**vexastrae** (7.5): okayyyy this ones got a pep in its step!

**BebeLuigi** (7): I love gay people

**bogo** (7): the more i paid attention to the video the weirder it got

**IIIHenryIII** (7): why is everybody spinning

**mongeese0** (7): Didn't feel very memorable besides the ending. Nothing bad about it though

**Nagisoid** (7): This is not the Electric Light Orchestra + Queen mashup I was expecting, false advertising!

**phonethephoenix** (7): nice enough! sweet vocals.

**saviorARMY101** (7): Quite sweet and wholesome sounding

**TiltControls** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR1GOytnd0I

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Never know how to feel about cheesy-type anime themes…

**wujinan** (7): eh

**Qwilphish** (6.5): It sounds like they put a regular song on 1.2x

**zadooi** (6.5): I expected the anime that gave us the term "MILF Coded" to have a better theme song. smh.

**cheatviathan** (6): The instrumental is as grand and as peppy as a show like this deserves, with some interesting rhythmic shifts. But the vocals do grate on me a bit. Season 2’s “Ai no Supreme” would have been an 8.

**impla77** (6): but why tho

**nyoom** (6): i like when songs have a bit where they start singing really fast. that's about it tho

**welcome2thejam** (6): It's a kink C-C-C-COMBO

**macnbee** (5): so THIS is that show with all the weird porn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): what if you wanted to watch a cute anime about dragon girls but god said https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/462/088/2df.jpg

**vayyiqra** (5): the disco intro lol but the rest was not memorable

**apatel27** (4): Chu Chu no. Sorry Fhana

**maybecrf** (4): the jumping scene was really unnecessary

**Poydoo** (4): -1 point becuase i hate this show

**ricki** (3): this is fetish bait

**shhhneak** (2): Dragon Maids are my least fave Yu-Gi-Oh deck so this is guilty by association.

**bigbigbee** (6): This one had a slow climb - starting in literal last place (thanks to my darling cohost's 0),  as ballots came in, it slowly ascended, even making Day 2 at one point before finally settling as our final cut of Day 1! 

 I don't know much about this anime. All I know is that I have two friends who love horror and recommended it enthusiastically to me, and one friend who refuses to watch it because they say the creator is a weird pervert. And I will happily exist not knowing which group is right. Maybe both!

**CrimsonROSET** (0): What a delightful way to end Day 1- my 0! I honestly didn't think I would end up with one this rate, but the more I thought about it, every part of this opening somewhat annoys me and is done better somewhere else in the rate. The pitched vocals, the drop (citation needed) and overall structre just don't inspire anything in me, and that synth line got more grating everytime I heard it, and it was many times! Sorry to these kids.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this was really nice i was smiling

**DutchPeasant** (10): The best cast song for me, though to be fair it's carried hard by the backing instruments. You'd think it makes a lot of sense considering the music of this show is done by Kevin Penkin, but it's actually not him providing the score for this song. What this song does best is capture the grandness, wonder and drama of this big adventure.

**PSSST12** (10): ANOTHER BANGER DAMMIT. Snatch me immediately when it played on the end credits of ep 1

**RandomHypnotica** (10): cave exploring

**alexismateofan** (9): a really grand song in the instrumentals, building up to a really nice ending.

**BebeLuigi** (9): ngl this thing is kinda fucked and not just because of the gore

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Okay Cave Story!

**saviorARMY101** (8.5): this op feels very cute and wholesome but from past experiences I’ve learned not to judge a book by it’s cover or in this case by it's opening theme…

**mongeese0** (8): Nine for instrumentals, but didn't really enjoy the voices, even if they are supposed to be the MCs

**Nagisoid** (8): Wait, this isn't Deep by Hyo!

**phonethephoenix** (8): like the melodies!

**vayyiqra** (8): piano goes hard on this. vibe is "AI heard one album by mondo grosso and wrote a theme but it turned out pretty well"

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**hacatu** (7.5): This opening is quite good, but I have no desire to ever watch Made in Abyss, and that would still be the case if it were tonally consistent and not, as I've taken to understand, truly disturbing body horror

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): these kids are horny

**beeozan** (7.4): bonus points for how this is a duet between riko and reg’s voice actors but it doesn’t jump out at you like other va performed ops, they kinda harmonize nicely too. cute song for a very cute show!

**Dragusken** (7): not me giving points just based off how much I like the first few beginning arpeggios

**horridhendy** (7): The voices are a bit annoying but it’s a good OP

**TiltControls** (7): this opening is a lot lighter compared to the little bit I know about the show

**vexastrae** (7): not bad

**shhhneak** (6.5): My cat was sitting beside me and did a full 180 away from me during this…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): wow what a cute looking anime about kids exploring im sure nothing bad will happen to them whatsoever

**apatel27** (6): The drop isn't hard enough

**cheatviathan** (6): It’s fine. The strings and pianos are okay. The vocals are cutesy but not to a fault. It captures the sense of adventure while obscuring the darkness that lies below, so it fits in that sense. Outside of the show, though, I have no desire to listen to it.

**pig-serpent** (6): Made In Abyss has some of the best music I've heard in any anime, but most of that is relegated to Kevin Penkin's score and the fun and goofy ending theme.  The opening of this show is... fine.  It's not doing anything wrong but it can't live up to the standards of the rest of the music in the series.  I'm gonna give it a 10 in the ED rate though. 

NINE Adventure is such a hard genre to do correctly, but Made in Abyss is nailing it.  Everything about the show is glorious and majestic and terrifying.  It captures the beauty of nature so well it rivals Miyazaki's portrayals, but it always has that dark core waiting around every corner.  The only thing holding this show back for me is the author being weird about things, and I do think it could be a little more character driven at times.

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**sarcasticsobs** (6): idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): 🧐

**welcome2thejam** (6): These kids seem way too young to explore the Abyss. Get them out of there

**impla77** (5.8): This sure does sound like an anime opening

**KuhBus** (5): surprisingly middling OP for something as intense and polarizing as this anime

**nyoom** (5): deep in piss

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (5): when we need a scapegoat to point to the deficit in good hardcore continuum bandcamp electronic grips, I'd blindly point to this? this has gamerbrain songwriting rot; low levels at least.

**Zypker125** (4.9): The smash-hit adventure-suspense anime from 2017 has arrived! Don’t be fooled by the anime’s cute/moe anime style and the infectious energy of the opening, because this is actually a really dark and twisted anime with lots of horror elements. The anime won r/anime’s Anime of the Year for 2017; however, I unfortunately never got the hype for the series, and that extends to the opening. The cutesy singing style is a huge detriment for this song, as it prevents the song from becoming more emotional and limits the range the song can traverse. [Prediction: Day 1]

**dysphorbs** (4): moe is saved by a sick beat

**prettybirbkotori** (3): annoying vocals and boring song so fun

**maybecrf** (2): always the same, never unique, completely been done before

vayyiqra: /u/pig-serpent what is the ED rate and what is NINE adventure genre

sorry my brain is mush today
[/r/popheads/comments/14h4mip/the_anime_opening_themes_rate_reveal_day_1_catch/jpsxgqi/]

=====

pig-serpent: ED is how anime fans refer to the ending songs as opposed to OPs being the opening songs.  The ED rate is a hypothetical sequel to this one where we rate anime ending themes.

&#x200B;

For shows I watched I wanted to talk about them as well as the song, so I did a 2nd paragraph where I started with my score for the anime then left a comment for it.  I didn't really explain this anywhere because obviously I didn't know which song would be out first so I was kinda just hoping people would be able to figure it out but I think your confusion is justified.

hyogurt: "[Asterisk](https://youtu.be/wW9TwZdWpjw)” was made for the arts, not for the charts! I'm both bummed and shocked it didn't make it to top 50 at least... Even though BLEACH has many better openings and better endings than "Asterisk," it is still one of *thee* definitive 2000's anime openings.
