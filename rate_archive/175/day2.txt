The Anime Opening / Themes Rate Reveal, Day 2: The Filler Arc
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/14hzcm5/the_anime_opening_themes_rate_reveal_day_2_the/

いらっしゃいませ, (and welcome back, people who were here yesterday!) to Day 2 of the reveal for /r/popheads’ Anime Openings / Themes Rate! Your hosts /u/bigbigbee and /u/CrimsonROSET think that you're super sugoi for being here. Arigatou.

Today, we will reveal the middle third of our songs (#50 - #26) and three more songs in the bonus rate (#6 - #4).

The reveal will start at 3:00PM EST (about 1 hour from now)! [Come join us in our Queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/myanimelist-reveal) to watch the eliminations live (plus some fun shitposts and interludes) with everyone else! Or you can follow the reveal right in this thread, as we will posts songs as they are eliminated, including the song's score, controversy score^(‡,) banners, and rate graphs.

^(‡) The controversy score = a measure of how spread out the scores are. For example, a song with scores of 10 and 1 will have the same average score as a song with two 5.5s, but the former has a higher "controversy". For stat nerds, this is the standard deviation.

**bigbigbee** (7): Should have been bluebird? What clowns made this list anyway? ;) 

 The winner of the One Piece/Naruto/Bleach battle...at least in this race. After a long descent from a comfortable Day 2 to Day 1, a few late high scores pulled this back up. I want to shout out the animation of this opening, but in a negative way - what the hell? Where did the budget go? Seriously, go look at it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): FINE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLUEBIRD YOU GUYS WIN

---

# Maybe We Should Have Picked A Different One

**shhhneak** (10): THEE SMASHAAA but Silhouette would’ve cleared this rate.

**pheromenos** (8.8): cute song but silhouette was RIGHT THERE

**apatel27** (7): It's fine but the other Naruto OPs are better

**popularsong** (7): huh feel like naruto has more iconic ops but i wasnt really a naruto fan so who knows. its aight

**ThaCoolness** (7): silhouette outsold

**cheatviathan** (6): This was my gateway anime back in the pre-cancellation days of Toonami. It had so many great openings. “Silhouette”, “Blue Bird”, “Haruka Kanata”, even other openings FLOW contributed like “GO!!” and “Re:member”. Yet you pick this? This is fine, I guess. It’s a decent enough rocker from this group. I would never listen to it outside of the anime, and I would only watch it once per binge session.

**DutchPeasant** (6): It sure must've been hard to pick the OP for this franchise. It's certainly one of the better ones, though again I feel it works better visualwise and how it fits with its arc than the song itself, it isn't that special. Now if this was Seishun Kyosokyoku, then it would be a completely different story.

**macnbee** (6): HELLO?? of all the openings we rate this one and not bluebird? not fighting dreamers? not GO!!!???? not hero's come back?????????????????? but, it's still pretty solid for being, like, tenth on the list of quality naruto openings.

**korobizaka** (5): naruto shippuden has too many good OPs and this was not one of them lol (nogizaka46 tsuki no ookisa best)

**Nagisoid** (4): Including this as the Naruto rep out of all options is camp as fuck because practically anything else would have a better performance but honestly it's what the franchise deserves

**prettybirbkotori** (4): go and silhouette exist and this is what we went with? i dunno

**beeozan** (3.2): this is not YU ARR MAI FREEEEEEEEN WAAAAAAAAAAA but like it had the camp potential with that intro it just didn’t tap into it.

# You're Being Very Nice, TY lol

**evanbrooks324** (10): this show has so many amazing openings I can see why this one was picked though

**saviorARMY101** (10): fucking banger of an opening theme, and probably the best naruto opening theme as well
[/r/popheads/comments/14hzcm5/the_anime_opening_themes_rate_reveal_day_2_the/jpdp7r7/]

=====

AnimeOPsRate: **1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I can’t get enough of that chorus, it’s just so good (wish we had gotten Haruka Kanata instead)

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Jiraiya 😢

**maybecrf** (10): this is probably just biased because its attached to one of the best arcs, but wow its cinematic and powerful

**milkywayinradius** (10): SASUKEEEEEEEEE!!!! love the drum part that leads into the chorus; gets me every time

**Qwilphish** (10): it still makes me emotional, i get chills whenever I listen to it

**AmandaYoung2083** (9): Naruto + Naruto Shippuuden + Boruto openings rate when

**TiltControls** (9): I never had a naruto phase, but with how good this sounds maybe I should've

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I know jack shit about Boruto's dad but at least I know he had some banger OPs

**wujinan** (9): one of the best

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I heard the Sign. And it opened up my ears I heard the Sign!

**impla77** (8): i didn’t realize the pop punk rate had started already

**phonethephoenix** (8): nice vocals and good instrumentation!

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): One time I got so high that I read the entire Naruto plot via every episode summary on its wiki over the course of like an entire day. Anyway, I would give my life for Hinata

**alexismateofan** (7): It’s a good anime opening song but it’s also a fairly average one. Like yeah it sounds good but unlike some, it’s not memorable?

**cremeebrulee** (7): ended ramen

**JIRACHI** (7): Cancer Sun Capricorn Moon Leo Rising

**mongeese0** (7): Not a big fan. The beginnings sounds a little like 21 guns :P. Seeing Naruto openings always makes me want to watch the show though

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The way the singer pronounces "scar" in the intro is so funny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is just a 00’s pop punk song

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (7): lol this one is gonna get bullied

**Zypker125** (7): Naruto was many people’s first anime, being the quintessential shounen anime that ended up being the childhood for many. Compared to most other anime of the 21st century, Naruto is pretty lengthy and is stuffed with filler episodes, so for many it may not hold up as well upon a rewatch. However, no one can deny the childhood nostalgia that Naruto brings. Onto the opening: I find it to be a fine J-rock opening, being a pleasant listen but not much more. The mixing is kinda off for me and prevents it from being more memorable, with the instrumental being way too loud and overpowering the vocals. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): that broken english in the start is... rough

**MrSwearword** (6): an iconic franchise with a mid theme

**nyoom** (6): more like Fine

**ricki** (6): green day

**Roxieloxie** (6): 00s pop punk lost track

**vexastrae** (5): yknow that one naruto shot that looks exactly like the climax of the spongebob squarepants movie? yea

**welcome2thejam** (5): If we Naruto run we can move faster than these low scores

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): these vocals aren’t great

**Dragusken** (4): meh sounds generic

**hacatu** (4): I hate the vocals, I initially had it at three because the opening is that bad, but it does improve

**horridhendy** (3): This just feels so generic. Perhaps because I have no nostalgia attached to this but it’s really not that good.

**Poydoo** (3): -2 points for the dumbass edgy lyric at the start

**vayyiqra** (3): i am so not into this; my dislike of anything vaguely pop-punk-ish is not subtle i fear

**babadork** (2): This sounds like Green Day if Green Day sucked.

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): WEEZER?????????

**pig-serpent** (1): Oh!  I hate the singing, I hate the false epicness, I hate how generic the instrumental sounds, and those first 10 seconds before the song kicks into gear is probably the worst individual moment of the rate.

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I watched every single episode of this anime in 2009 and I remember absolutely none of it, except for that blonde girl Mugi being a real savage. This one had a slow rise to settle here at the very start of Day 2!

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): would take a bullet for them

**dreamingpastel** (10): These are my main pop girls. Stan talent, stan Ho-kago Tea Time.

**hacatu** (10): Immaculate

**horridhendy** (10): The K-on songs are all so much fun. This is such a little bop and will be stuck in your head for weeks.

**pig-serpent** (10): Yeah I see why this is the prototypical music anime if the music is this good.  I've been curious about K-On! for a while, but I know its fans have gotten an unsavory reputation in recent years.  Is the show actually worth watching?

**popularsong** (10): bandoris mothers

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love boygenius

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): ended rita ora charli xcx bebe rexha and cardi b

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (9.1): *painfully rapsy dweeb ass voice* a 5 piece girl band would never sound like this! they don't use real death by audio pedals! the keyboard isn't plugged in! the drummer doesn't know neu! motorik! they'll NEVER beat my band in the battle of the bands!

**Poydoo** (9): The naziness entering my body after hearing this song:

**impla77** (8.8): GIRLS! WHO! ROCK!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): Give them a Pitchfork Best New Music right now!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): okayyyyy

**Lynflower680** (8.5): The ending chant has no reason going that hard

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): anyone who tells you this show is anything but boring is lying to you btw. this song is really good though (don't say lazy better)

**Around-town** (8): I'm pretty sure that me stumbling on this song on YouTube is how I discovered anime in the first place

**mongeese0** (8): Really liked the immersive style song for an anime about teenage musicians. Always liked the ending song more than the opening

**phonethephoenix** (8): i like the driving beat!

**ricki** (8): oh these are the homophobic facts video girls slayy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): when are we rating ho-kago tea time

**TiltControls** (8): did they ever have a 'left the band over creative differences to go produce a solo album' arc

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Slay gurls

**welcome2thejam** (8): What episode do they get accused of being industry plants

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**bogo** (7.5): we stan women in rock music

**vexastrae** (7.5): we shouldve never let 4chan claim this ..... bocchi the rock nation i trust yall to keep my girl safe !!

**beeozan** (7.2): this is not the best song they do for this show. oh and the full version kinda flopping a bit

**alexismateofan** (7): its just kind of cute and lighthearted without getting on my nerves, which is key for something like this.

**BebeLuigi** (7): when the anime ENDING rate happens and No, Thank You and Don't Say Lazy are the top 2 omg??????

**cheatviathan** (7): I don’t think I ever fully internalized how many bells and whistles this otherwise straightforward rocker had, and how much that bassline rips. Those echoey guitar leads really work for me. The bridge, where everyone gets a solo passage, is cool. Ultimately, Yui’s vocals are too cutesy for me, but they aren’t the absolute worst here. The organ tinged “Go! Go! Maniac” would have been an 8, but the EDs outsell even that because I like Mio, both as a vocalist and as a character, more. K-On! is my 2nd favorite anime of all time, and the uncontested apex of slice of life shows. Worth a watch.

**ImAWeebDuh** (7): Ca gay cake! GIRLS

**wujinan** (7): good

**saviorARMY101** (6.5): this is almost a bit too saccharine for my liking, but it does have some charm to it

**Dragusken** (6): i swear i heard the same note the whole song

**Nagisoid** (6): That blonde girl is persecuted in several countries for hate crimes

**vayyiqra** (6): kind of bonkers rock on

**Zypker125** (5.6): K-On, the quintessential “cute girls doing cute things” (CGDCT) anime. Known as the anime focusing on “episodic fluff” stories and having very low stakes, K-On skyrocketed the popularity of the CGDCT genre, especially when combining it with music elements. The opening as well is a parade of sweet, sugary energy. However, it lacks the bombastic and frenetic energy of say, Lucky Star’s opening, and thus it’s exactly not my cup of tea (if you use cutesy vocals in your song, then you need the infectious high-octane energy to accompany it, imo). [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**apatel27** (5): too bubblegum

**IIIHenryIII** (5): who’s the new boygenius member?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I’m assuming it’s not part of the actual animation but oh boy animextremist.com does not sound like a website I want to visit.

**nyoom** (4): anyone who likes this kind of show should be legally required to stay 500 feet away from me

**indie\_fan\_** (3): yeah now we're getting into the cutsey type music that starts to annoy me a bit

**maybecrf** (2): i cant seperate this from the racist anime pfp brigade that it spawned

**MrSwearword** (1): NO

**Qwilphish** (1): this song has been done so much better in this rate already.... especially for an anime about music

**shhhneak** (1): When the drink be too strong, when the tree be way too strong I love to get

---

**CrystaltheCool** (11): This is a classic for a reason. The pause at 0:39-0:40 is peak.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic. lowkey wish the 2nd opening was here instead cause some of y'all would go CRAZY

**apatel27** (10): idc if this is just nostalgia speaking it bangs

**saviorARMY101** (10): This song will always make me nostalgic since it’s the first anime apart from Pokemon that I ever watched

**shhhneak** (10): instantly teleports me to my emo teen angst era.

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this shit is for sick freaks

**mongeese0** (9.6): Vocal delivery is absolutely as dramatic as it needed to be. Instrumental could probably be a little more intense IMO

**horridhendy** (9): A classic

**indie\_fan\_** (9): Misa you deserved better and Light you deserve to go through the gates. no not the ones above

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is the better opening but god I really wanted to see popheads try to rate What’s Up People

**korobizaka** (8.6): the singing is kinda silly lol

**Around-town** (8): I like the second opening better, but this one is iconic

**dysphorbs** (8): butt rock done right

**hacatu** (8): Conflict of interest notice: I've seen this anime

**Lynflower680** (8): Random tidbit incoming but I just remembered that the voice actor for Duncan from Total Drama was in the English dub of the show. That’s it. That’s the tweet. Good song too btw.

**macnbee** (8): yup

**nt96** (8): https://rave.dj/vLr0ZX41hm6_ZA

**nyoom** (8): ok, iconic

**wujinan** (8): what KISS OF DEATH wishes it was

**Awkward\_King** (7): u will be deathnote

**BebeLuigi** (7): My problematic trait is that I had a crush on Light

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Me when someone is thinking about 0’ing my 11 in a rate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkQiUlYxIhA

**cheatviathan** (7): I saw an AMV once where the twist was that the Death Note actually turned people into bronies, rather than killing them. It was better edited and produced than it had any right to be given how shitposty the premise is.

**Dragusken** (7): nothing really sticking out for me tbh

**IIIHenryIII** (7): hosties better write down the usernames of those who tank this

**popularsong** (7): a pity its not the maximum the hormone song in the rate that one would also be a 11 candidate

**DaswefSayLazy** (6.5): bog standard anime OP

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): The singer sounds so goofy and over-exaggerated.

**Zypker125** (6.3): Arguably the most well-known anime of all time, Death Note was released more than 15 years ago and still remains super popular to this day. Death Note also happens to be my 2nd favorite anime of all-time (and I’m usually not a fan of the most-popular anime); I loved watching the psychological mind-games unfold between the two main characters, and although it did get super convoluted at points (like, these characters are definitely *too* smart and have too much foresight), it was super thrilling and enjoying to watch. However, we are rating just the music of the opening, and I’m afraid it doesn’t hold up well for me. The song definitely feels like a product of its time, and despite having a heavy instrumental, it doesn’t really end up being catchy for me (the chorus doesn’t jump into high-enough energy for me). I’m also not a fan of the singer’s vocal color/tone. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**DutchPeasant** (6): Unlike Code Geass, this song hasn't aged too well. The part at 0:35 still is divine as it was back then, but everything else is rather generic. At least it does still have that nice eerie vibe to it.

**Nagisoid** (6): Go off Green Day!

**Poydoo** (6): one piece

**prettybirbkotori** (6): this picks up at the chorus but before that i was just focused on how weird this guy's voice is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): light yagami was kinda the dumbest man on earth

**vayyiqra** (6): anime themes with metal-ish guitar that try to be "edgy" are often not my thing but this kind of hits idk

**vexastrae** (6): [misa binks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896148582699266058/1107449412176846879/FwDlq9LXoAEhZ6Y.png)

**welcome2thejam** (6): The Hamburglar - Strangulation

**phonethephoenix** (5.6): not really my cup of tea but the guitars are cool enough

**seanderlust** (5.5): have i just been listening to my own rate's playlist or does this sound a lot like dear maria count me in

**alexismateofan** (5): I’m left kind of speechless here like wow. That sure was definitely music on an OP.

**bogo** (5): for how iconic this anime is this theme is very mid

**sarcasticsobs** (5): YOU again

**pig-serpent** (4): Horrible singing and falls into a lot of my least favorite J-rock tropes.  I know people hate on the death metal opening for being death metal, but I genuinely believe that anyone who likes both genres equally would call the metal opening the better of the two by far.

**TiltControls** (4): there's something off about the vocals here for me. Like the singer has something stuck in his throat

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): good energy but vocals kinda rough

**ricki** (3): this is too emo

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (3): he musta wrote in the death note that i die of boredom bc thats how i feel listening to this

**Qwilphish** (2): I'm not rating on the visuals of the OP, only on the song and this song is fucking shit lmfao

**ImAWeebDuh** (1): man sounds on the edge of vomiting the entire song

**maybecrf** (1): this man's voice is so irritating, make it stop

**MrSwearword** (1): I am so over this halfway sung attempt at rock music

# No wait...let him cook

**beeozan** (4.2): "Light. Do you want to have sex?" 

 *Light almost choked on his sip of coffee. Think. He had to play this strategically.* 

 *If I immediately say no, he'll definitely think I'm Kira. It's too obvious. Would Kira have gay sex? Kira would never let himself be in a position so vulnerable, never mind gay or not. Though... Would he? Kira, albeit drawn from me, is a concept who exists in a divorced state. While I may not jump at the opportunity for sex, someone such as Kira may see it as a show of power. So if I declined here, L may suspect that I don't want to come off as too power-hungry, and accuse me of being Kira.* 

 *I have to go through with it. I don't have a good enough reason to reject him.* 

 *But if I say yes, that still points towards Kira, who could use the argument that "a hole is a hole" and therefore top. No, if I suggest topping, he'll definitely think I'm Kira. But wait. That's it.* 

 *I'll take his dick up my ass, proving that I am neither homophobic nor Kira.* 

 L, in the meantime, ate his cake without so much as giving it a second thought. His trap was well-laid and well-prepared. 

 *If Light asks me to top, he's definitely Kira.*

**bigbigbee** (3): who are you breathing on with those vocals. stop that 

 This was a controversial one! About half of us thought that this song is stunning, and beautiful, and I wish I could hear what you all hear, because I am in the other half, who finds this difficult to listen to due to the singer's voice. The absolute cliff dive that this takes from Rona's ballot to mine sends me. But, the people who love this song meant that it was never in danger of falling to Day 1!

---

**KuhBus** (11): Genuinely didn't expect this to be just as powerful as I remember it being.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**BebeLuigi** (10): Quite insane that chorus will go down in history as one of the most insane

**beeozan** (10): you could tell me this is the peak of japanese emo and I would believe u in a second. **YURETA YUGANDA SEKAI WO DANDAN BOKU WA** these riffs go INSANELY hard holy fuckin shit. I should become a Ling Tosite Sigure fan like right now and binge all their albums instead of doing the rest of the rate but deadlines are evil. unrelated with this song but like how am i supposed to give the boring violet evergarden ballad a good score after listening to life changing culture shifting banger (tbh there is no universe where i give that a good score anyway)

**evanbrooks324** (10): one of the most popular and iconic opening for a reason!

**indie\_fan\_** (10): soon as i heard that guitar that's all i needed

**JIRACHI** (10): a seashell girl seashell girl say no it's a gummy worm a colonoscopy 😔

**korobizaka** (10): i dont know how you can listen to this song and not think it's one of the best of all time. it builds up so well, and once you get the chorus... man. the singing and emotion is unmatched.

**maybecrf** (10): and just because of that high note bitch, you're safe as fuck

**popularsong** (10): the list of animes i think dont deserve these bangers keep increasing. unbelievably beautiful and moving performance

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I've heard the chorus to this in soooo many memes. This definitely deserves to win.

**saviorARMY101** (10): GOD THE NOSTALGIA HITS WITH THIS ONE

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (9.7): cornball shit. cousins get riled up so easily when they hear it

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): If something bad happened to the blue and the purple-haired women in the start of this opening, I will scream

**Dragusken** (9): every emo weeb has tried to mumble sing this song at least once

**phonethephoenix** (9): banger!

**Senn\_Kyu** (9): I have moods where I can't stand the singer's voice so I can't give this a full 10

**mongeese0** (8.5): always felt the muted vocals sliiightly overstayed their welcome. I didn't need a whole minute of buildup

**vexastrae** (8.5): yep its iconic

**alexismateofan** (8): I really love when they do the change up in OPs, like starting soft, going HARDCORE and then going soft again at the end. Really my kind of vibe.

**Bisonsouro** (8): I still like the song

**pheromenos** (8): the dj-jo hatsune miku remix is so much better

**pig-serpent** (8): That falsetto is a bold choice but they're pulling it off.  I love that juicy piano riff and the screeching guitar that follows that pattern.  The chorus actually succeeds at having an epic feeling.  Yeah, they played with fire on this song but they roasted some darn good marshmellows.

**bogo** (7.8): slow start but it eventually started mass slaying

**Poydoo** (7.7): I liked the part where he goes hee hoo

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): an interesting experiment

**Qwilphish** (7): the whispers at the beginning are iconic

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is probably gonna go top 10, maybe even top 5, and I will not be enjoying it! This man’s voice has two modes, waifish whisper and out-of-tune screech, and they’re both equally bad!! But the production is too good to totally tank this song

**Zypker125** (5.9): One of the big favorites to win the rate! Unravel is consistently one of the highest-rated openings across rankings between different communities and circles. While Tokyo Ghoul the anime is not very highly rated (being one of those very-popular-anime-for-boys-that-isn’t-critically-well-received), the opening is acclaimed by all. It won r/anime’s 3rd Best Opening tournament bracket (which had 3.1k participants). In fact, I’d argue from a statistical perspective, Unravel boasts THE BEST statistics/scores across all 75 songs, even over heavy winner favorites such as A Cruel Angel’s Thesis and Tank. Will r/popheads like it as much? That’s definitely up in the air. This opening definitely has style, immediately starting the song with no instrumental and a soft vocal delivery. The obvious hook of this song is when the heavy metal and drum elements kick into overdrive, and the vocals subsequently go ham as well, a contrast to the softer delivery of the first verse. Unfortunately for me, I’m not a big fan of how jarring the contrast is between the verse and the chorus, and I find the vocal delivery in the verse annoying. [Prediction: Top 5]

**Awkward\_King** (5): the build is so beautiful and then comes on the worst vocals you've ever heard i kinda love it

**cheatviathan** (5): This would be great as an instrumental, especially with how the more elegant instrumentation in the verses contrasts with the noisy, chaotic as hell bridge. However, I cannot stand this guy’s voice. I just can’t.

**seanderlust** (4.5): cool instrumental, really don't like the singer's voice

**apatel27** (4): God I hate his voice but the guitars smash

**vayyiqra** (4): not awful but sthe vocals and facemelting guitar do not go together at all eh

**villblomst** (4): im so sick of her

**welcome2thejam** (4): Hate hate HATED that starting voice in my ear

**impla77** (3.5): find the note girl.. find the note

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Oh man I really dislike the vocals on this one. Instrumental is fine tho.

**AmandaYoung2083** (1): This song has sounded horrible FOREVER and I finally have a platform to say it

**IIIHenryIII** (1): what are you doing with your voice? Oh my goodness he sounds insufferable. I love the instrumentals though.

**milkywayinradius** (1): those weak vocals really bring me down. reminding me of Shy Ronnie from lonely island

**prettybirbkotori** (1): going in i thought this would be my 0 easily but something managed to be worse than a song i have hated for years. this guy's voice is insufferable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i fucking hate this song im sorry

**babadork** (0): I just hate the singer’s voice.

**nyoom** (0): is this the producer's nephew or something

# take me to YOUR karaoke sessions, please

**Nagisoid** (9): I remember my cousin once sang this in karaoke and my mom told me to never speak to him in public again

**wujinan** (8.5): i play this at karaoke every time

**bigbigbee** (6): That blue haired girl is worth SO much on the "mudae bot", a gacha-based discord bot game where you roll for waifus

---

**villblomst** (11): ….. unexpected 11 for this one

**1998tweety** (10): What we'll need to do if this song doesnt win the rate

**bogo** (10): idk yass

**cheatviathan** (10): The vocals go hard. The way the rhythm keeps switching up on the chorus goes hard. The shift from electronic sounding drums to live ones goes hard. I might just be a sucker for songs that remind me of my nu metal days, but I dig this one.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love the dynamics

**JIRACHI** (10): giving this a 10 for no reason other than because i recognised the bitch with the blue bob

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love a dramatic banger

**Dragusken** (9): honestly, kinda slaps

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the chorus is quite disappointing

**sarcasticsobs** (9): No idea what's going on in this opening, but this is a slapper

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): You know if your only knowledge about this anime is maid waifus and dog femboys then this opening goes surprisingly hard

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (8.2): its got those raspy brrp brrp grunge debris effects!

**evanbrooks324** (8): I like Paradisus-Paradoxum over this but still a good song

**hacatu** (8): Really good, the glitchy heartbeat motif is effectively unsettling. Re:Zero I'mma let you finish but Mother of Learning had the best time loop story of all time

**pig-serpent** (8): The way that repetitive guitar riff plays into the show's themes? *Pacha meme* I really like the guitar work on this one. 

SIX.FIVE Man, I have crazy mixed feelings on this show.  Subaru is both a cool subversion of the op isekai protagonist and one of the most annoying anime characters I've ever seen.  The world actually intrigued me but its so big that the show feels like it's constantly mystery boxing, even in season 2 when it's relatively contained and building depth for one segment of the world.  Some parts of the show were painfully boring, like I really didn't care about the white whale or fighting Beetlejuice 8 times in a row.  On top of that, this show has questionable treatment of its female characters.  I think I'm mostly enjoying it so far but the show is just, a lot, and I'm not sure I'm down for another 300 episodes of it.

**prettybirbkotori** (8): the ending song is phenomenal but this one's pretty good too

**saviorARMY101** (8): bangerr

**phonethephoenix** (7.6): it's fine!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): why'd i think he had a tote bag ghfhgghj

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's unfortunate that the multiple songs that it'd be easy to make 0ing jokes for are all pretty good

**alexismateofan** (7): the latter half got good. Like actual banger territory.

**vayyiqra** (7): legitimately the guitar made me think of a cut by swedish punk band refused so that's cool

**vexastrae** (7): sounds neat

**Zypker125** (6.9): Rate hosts having to ReMove the “:” from “Re:Zero” because it messed with the rate website processing, heh heh I’ve been there. Re:Zero is one of the most famous anime in the Isekai genre, a genre where “a character is suddenly transported from their world into a new/unfamiliar one.” Usually, isekai anime consist of “a self-insert character transported from Earth into a fantasy world (usually with cute girls/boys who follow the main character on their adventures”. While Re:Zero follows this premise, it is known for its darker storylines, especially in regards to the moral grayness of its main male character and the gruesome violence of the first arcs. It is frequently falsely labeled as a “deconstruction” of the Isekai genre, but it definitely has deeper & denser storylines than your average “fast food” isekai anime. Also, my younger brother was absolutely obsessed with this show, so it did mark a spot in my anime history, even if I was never the biggest fan of Re:Zero. As for the song itself, while the “audio rip” effects in the verses add to the cinematic effect for the audiovisual experience, from a pure listening experience it hurts my ears. Aside from that though, it has pretty good mixing and nice emotional delivery, it’s just not that catchy for me personally. Also, Rem overrated, Emilia best girl [Prediction: Day 2]

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): ended tinashe - undo

**wujinan** (6.5): mid

**apatel27** (6): Edging without release

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): rezero is the worst anime of all time

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): ram my beloved

**BebeLuigi** (5): I watched this and it made me hate every person on the internet that idolizes Rem and Emilia quite powerful. Also the endings are better

**maybecrf** (5): mid beyond belief

**plastichaxan** (5): Okay this one can have its joke scores for the name idc

**beeozan** (4.8): is putting the title card a minute into the opening the power move they think it is? I actually can’t decide. anyway this song rocks more than it has any right to but I’m kinda tired of this kinda dramatic delivery I think. and it tires too hard in the full version to do things it doesn’t need to do so it adds up to the tiresome part. if this doesnt win the rate will we get a redo cuz anime rate 2 would be very fun. lets just keep rating anime songs until we rate all the rezero ops it would be thematic

**Poydoo** (4.5): death note

**macnbee** (4): can we get a count of videos on this list that have a girl in a maid costume

**Nagisoid** (4): Was this recorded next to an air turbine or something

**nyoom** (4): redo this song

**Qwilphish** (2): What a confusing structure that doesn't really work for me

**bigbigbee** (8): Reminds me of Rina Sawayama "you slay....cause you're brave" music. 

 Pleasantly surprised that this one rose to Day 2 over the last third or so of the ballots - I didn't have a ton of hope for this soft pop-rocky song with a man singer. I definitely think that this is the highest that this song could possibly achieve on r/popheads, so I'm glad it achieved it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): bee's comment

---

**beeozan** (10): “You are rating the song, not the anime.” ok no this is impossible this has a full 5 minute animated music video (not an amv cuz its official) with the characters from the show AND it is simply incredible. Bump of Chicken (god what a stupid band name) are maybe a good alt rock band of early 00s but their later stuff like the recent spy x family opening was really mid. this one is the exception cuz its just channeling some of the emotiveness of the show through the riffs and progressions and they kinda cheated there. still a 10 what can I do about it absolutely nothing

**dreamingpastel** (10): I might be a bit biased because I like Bump of Chicken, but this song is great too. Go give their song Acacia a listen if you like this.

**DutchPeasant** (10): Ahhh Bump, one of the loveliest bands out there for anime. Never a miss, and always filled with such warmth. Answer especially feels like one of their calmer ones, and whilst I may prefer Hello world over this, you really can't have a lackluster song with Bump.

**phonethephoenix** (10): oh I like this one!! it feels evocative somehow. a nice mood

**1998tweety** (9): goated show

**alexismateofan** (9): BUMP OF CHICKEN slaps absolutely incredible band.

**bogo** (9): this is pretty lovely

**hacatu** (9): Fantastic instrumental and good vocals

**mongeese0** (9): Like how clear the vocals are here and how engaging the song is given the (conveyed?) subject matter

**TiltControls** (8.5): both the show title and the song sound like some forgotten early 2010s one-sorta-hit indie band

**Nagisoid** (8): The artist being named "Bump of Chicken" is so funny like what does that even mean

**prettybirbkotori** (8): sayonara bystander is like one of the best openings ever but this one is really good too. also watch this fuckin show!!

**Qwilphish** (8): I do like me some angst

**saviorARMY101** (8): Sounds very pretty and pleasant

**wujinan** (8): bump of chicken is so amazing

**cheatviathan** (7): The vocals are fine. There are like two guitar leads competing for space at any one time, but not in a way that makes the song sound cluttered. That one lead line gets repetitive after a while, which is not what you want in a five minute song. It’s enjoyable in OP size, but not as much in full.

**cremeebrulee** (7): ended pisces and aries

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the vocalist doesn’t sound good, otherwise this would be a 10

**KuhBus** (7): The animation bumps this up another point for me.

**Poydoo** (7): death note

**vayyiqra** (7): cool piano

**vexastrae** (7): hmmmm i think the sad bitches will like this

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Seems intense but the song didn't really hit

**Around-town** (6): I really like this artist, but this is just an ok song

**horridhendy** (6): This is fine.

**korobizaka** (6): every male singer in a japanese band has sounded like this since 2018

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I love one Bump of Chicken song! It's not this one

**Zypker125** (5.7): This list is chalk-full of action/comedy anime, so it makes sense to put some drama anime in there, such as the heavily-acclaimed-and-top-rated March Comes In Like A Lion. March Comes In Like A Lion focuses on depression, anxiety, and character studies, and it is one of the highest-rated anime and manga of all time. Onto the song; I think it’s okay, but it really lacks the memorability for me. The vocals feel somewhat restrained and the opening as a whole lacks the emotion/direction needed to set a lasting impression for me. The first few notes of the opening are the highlight, but otherwise I find the music middling. [Prediction: Day 2]

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (4.2): fairly certain this is just a longinus records comp cut i didn't like

**apatel27** (4): The issue with Bump of Chicken is once you've heard one of their songs, you've heard all of them

**Dragusken** (4): okay but not too memorable

**nyoom** (4): yall really made me watch a nerd drown for a minute and a half

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): snooze

**maybecrf** (2): im so tired

**plastichaxan** (2): The name is such a slay what happened

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): what does that even mean

# If I had a nickel for every time a rater gave this song a 10 and made their comment "bump of chicken"

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Bump of Chicken

**shhhneak** (10): Bump of Ch11cken

**bigbigbee** (5): This is b8

---

**plastichaxan** (11): XUNT

**1998tweety** (10): banger, chorus is so hype. also points for being gay

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/891209572520448000.webp?size=240&quality=lossless

**evanbrooks324** (10): one thing about me I will eat up a Sawano song

**phonethephoenix** (10): like the vocals and tune and instrumentation

**popularsong** (10): idw to embarrass myself w not knowing abt music genres but i just love this sound whoa... i feel like this anime doesnt deserve this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I could definitely see this fitting on Hold The Girl

**PSSST12** (10): oohhh a banger me thinks

**seanderlust** (10): I feel like I'm in a 90s movie and hacking the mainframe of an evil organization in a leather catsuit

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): now THIS is the cybergoth slut bop

**sarcasticsobs** (9.6): I trust this red-eyed pink-haired ballerina demon (?) with my life. I don't know if Im supposed to, but I cannot help what I feel!!

**bogo** (9): slay

**cheatviathan** (9): The way those synths and guitars meld together is hype as hell, and the vocals and lyrics have the sort of unique charm that can only come from non-native English speakers writing and singing in English.

**hacatu** (9): That opening instrumental tho

**saviorARMY101** (9): Holy shit this is a banger, it has a dark and somewhat sinister feel to it that I enjoy

**vayyiqra** (9): ignoring whatever cursed-looking stuff is happening in the video for this track being a total banger

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Robyn but make it rock

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): okayyyy

**shhhneak** (8): titty.gif

**horridhendy** (7.5): The anime might be boring as fuck but the OP is pretty good.

**Lynflower680** (7.5): It’s kinda like late 90s eurodance mixed with rock.

**TiltControls** (7.5): spooky

**vexastrae** (7.5): we love a techno bop!

**alexismateofan** (7): the vocal dissonance from the music is something else.

**apatel27** (7): Where Japanese?

**BebeLuigi** (7): don't be fooled, this part goes hard but the full version is ass

**DutchPeasant** (7): Very solid first half, but the Sawano drop I've grown weary of.

**JIRACHI** (7): more like XU-ck my dick

**Poydoo** (7): death note

**Qwilphish** (7): I really like how delicate the intro is, and then the power of the secnd half, but it ends kind of abruptly

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): “Queerbaiting” wasn’t always a word to throw around when famous man #52 wears an ugly pantsuit, queerbaiting used to have MEANING. There used to be a CULTURE.

**wujinan** (6.5): interesting but mid

**Zypker125** (6.4): Owari no Seraph is another one of the anime on the list that I had vaguely heard of, and I was surprised to see it on the list (it’s not that popular and I hadn’t heard anything about the opening before the rate). The premise is apparently “a post-apocalyptic world ruled by vampires”, which sounds kinda cool, vampires are awesome. Anyways, onto the opening. It’s pretty nice, the chorus picks up the energy well, but the song overall isn’t as intense or cinematic I would have liked, as the instrumental feels kinda generic. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**Dragusken** (6): sounds like a hiroyuki sawano song, enough said

**Nagisoid** (6): GIMME GIMME NOW GIMME GIMME NOW XU XU XU

**pig-serpent** (6): I have never heard of this show, but this felt like two different OPs.  One for a dark and mysterious thriller about sexy vampires with a Depeche Mode-esque music to fuck vampires to OP, and then a different show about generic dudes with swords fighting monsters with a generic j-rock OP.  I think it's obvious which half I was more invested in, both in terms of music and potential show content.

**prettybirbkotori** (6): the chorus is such a drastic change and i do not think it is a good one

**nyoom** (5): brothers or lovers?

**Awkward\_King** (4): gosspi girl xuxu

**KuhBus** (4): knock off Rammstein vibes without fully committing to the sound

**ricki** (4): evanescense

**beeozan** (2.5): i swear this song has an identity crisis but i dont know how to explain it in detail

**AmandaYoung2083** (2): Can't explain it but it feels reductive

**maybecrf** (2): a fast food delivery of nothing

**bigbigbee** (10): Ohhhhhhhhhhh 😔 

 I was real sad to see this one slowly descend from a solid Day 3 to here in early Day 2. This was absolutely the discovery of the rate for me - it's so fun and good, real "teenage girls being teenage girls" energy. For the anime itself, I also like that it looks like it wasn't designed to appeal to male otaku.....lol. Also I don't think it's apparent from this opening but the show is actually pleasantly diverse for anime (I watched clips after falling in love with this song).

---

**Roxieloxie** (11): i got into this from kappy playing it day 3 as an interlude in the ep reveal and its just so bouncy and fun

**1998tweety** (10): devoured and ahead of its time

**apatel27** (10): It bangs (any more time spent on this will result in a 10000 word essay on the show)

**Awkward\_King** (10): tell me why i wanted to 0 this and now im listening and its the best thing ever. ok le tigre

**beeozan** (10): idk who eizouken is but i know to stan chelmico. such an earworm like... facts

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): gec

**dysphorbs** (10): another song that is great outside the context of being an anime op

**hacatu** (10): This might be the actual best one on the list, effortlessly cool, instantly recognizable, and it's just a shame that the Triple-Q mashup with Shake it Off had to be dragged down by the less talented Taylor Swift

**Lynflower680** (10): You just had to be there.

**phonethephoenix** (10): funky and fun!

**Poydoo** (10): This was my second choice for my 0, oddly enough

**prettybirbkotori** (10): extremely fun and high energy i come back to this song constantly

**vexastrae** (10): a smasha that will leave day 2 i fear ... praying for songeniality

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is an olympia, WA punk song. prolly somehow owes something to shonen knife who owe something to...olympia, WA. cycle of life

**welcome2thejam** (10): The zany, chaotic, old Cartoon Network energy we've been missing in our culture

**Qwilphish** (9.5): so unique, I want to listen to an entire album of songs like this

**AmandaYoung2083** (9): ezpz easy breezy

**macnbee** (9): solid!!

**pig-serpent** (9): Okay I've decided that this off kilter post punk type beat makes for a great anime OP and I want every show to do this now.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Beautiful, CoverGirl

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is what bree runway and yung baby tate thought they were doing when they made damn daniel

**TiltControls** (9): i kept expecting utada to jump in

**nyoom** (8.5): reminds me of like a rhythm heaven track

**Bisonsouro** (8): Iconic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Me when I’m in the finale episode of America’s Next Top Model (at least in the first 10 seasons no idea wtf they’ve been doing recently)

**cheatviathan** (8): They managed to build a catchy pop song around a filthy sounding slide guitar riff and some ska upstrokes. I’m a sucker for a good slide guitar riff, so of course this bop was going to rank high for me.

**cremeebrulee** (8): ended hikki

**milkywayinradius** (8): i kind of love how hectic this song is

**plastichaxan** (8): 100 gecs coded (complimentary)

**popularsong** (8): really fun omg. at first i was a little ??? about the monotone rap but it works

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): SpongeBob-ass music [complementary]

**ImAWeebDuh** (7): why the hell is the anime titled this

**mongeese0** (7): The weird guitar kept me interested, but the talk-singing wasn't that pleasant to listen to. -- Definitely catchy, but also grating

**Nagisoid** (7): Lipslap's legacy lives on

**Narhun** (7): Points deducted for never saying "lemon squeezy"

**seanderlust** (7): why is the guitar kind of giving Loser by Beck

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): im easy breezy and this rate is japaneseey

**lexiaredery** (6.5): It feels likely that when this goes out I will realize that I underrated this

**wujinan** (6.5): cool

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Gorillaz???

**maybecrf** (5): im not high enough for this energy

**distressedbeatboxing** (4.9): Actually, this is kind of difficult to listen to.

**alexismateofan** (4): this is weird and like not in a fun way for the most part. Just kind of wished it was over real quick.

**saviorARMY101** (4): it’s decent

**allodude** (2): I think I like this more on a conceptual level

**Dragusken** (2): …no thanks

**vayyiqra** (2): [sighs deeply] she's got a new microphone. are you happy popheads i did the thing. oh i wrote that comment before hearing this theme. this sucks for reasons hard to articulate but the vibe is "the AI heard half a cibo matto album and then was prompted to write a song only it came out bad"

**Zypker125** (1.5): Here we have Eizouken, the anime about…. Animation, that’s quite meta (and surprisingly rare, there’s not too many anime about anime). While the song may be catchy, that’s many due to its overly repetitive nature, which is personally grating from a listening perspective. Also, I feel like the song stays too much in its “box” and feels kinda monotonous, and a lot of the sound effects are annoying. I also just generally hate the lackadaisical tone of the vocal/rap delivery. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**indie\_fan\_** (1): yeahh no. Don't like the singing at all and the instrumentation just adds to my dislike for it. side note though the animation for the opening seems cute tho i might look into the show a bit while skipping the opening.

**JIRACHI** (1): this is the bad kind of camp where it's not even enjoyable but just annoying

**shhhneak** (1): Keep Your Elevens Off Eizouken!

**bogo** (0): somehow worse than the utada song

**ricki** (0): there's something decidedly unchic afoot

**bigbigbee** (6): the hook is so iconic that i didn't realize that there was more (bad) stuff to this song

---

1998tweety (10): i mean come on now

allodude (10): I appreciate this theme explaining what Digimon was short for

Dragusken (10): digimons are the champions (of this rate)

hacatu (10): An ironic masterpiece is still a masterpiece

Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc (10): industrial from the meat beat manifesto/pop will destroy itself! timeline

korobizaka (9.5): when this song came on saturday morning and everyone ran to the TV

krusso1105 (9.5): I recognize this is not better than the original opening but nostalgia brain

TiltControls (9.5): As a huge Pokemon fanatic, I never really got Digimon's whole deal. However I can admit this is a smash

Around-town (9): I sometimes unironically listen to this alongside regular music

DaswefSayLazy (9): i am torn because while i like this as the opening song, any digimon fan who has watched the shows has also heard the song like 9 billion times because the song plays during every single digivolution, so you have some episodes where this song just plays like 6 times and its so clear that they are trying to pad the runtime. i like the song but im so tired of the song that i cannot give it a higher score because im still burned out from it

macnbee (9): it's funny because this is a very strong effort but once again digimon is washed by pokemon

maybecrf (9): certified hood classic

Narhun (9): iconic

nt96 (9): ugh these 2000-ass effects 😩

Qwilphish (9): my favorite show growing up

RandomHypnotica (9): it's funky fresh

Bisonsouro (8): Almost nostalgic ^ ^

dreamingpastel (8): LISTEN I know this isn't Butterfly, and like 10 words are sung in the entire song, AND the melody is basic af, BUT I'm afraid nostalgia is a hell of a drug. Negative points for not being Butterfly or the theme song for the English dub of Digimon Frontiers

impla77 (8): thank god they’re only digital i was getting scared

Lynflower680 (8): CHAANNGGEE INTO DIGITAL CHAMPIONS TO SAVE THE DIGITAL world

Senn\_Kyu (8): ....listen!! It's obviously no Butterfly but it's so fun in a pure kid's toy commercial jingle kind of way I can't hate it

saviorARMY101 (7.5): Probably just nostalgia speaking but this kind of bangs

BleepBloopMusicFan (7): I swear to god they’re saying “Digital Mustard”

cheatviathan (7): I’m going to use this spot to talk about how Digimon: The Movie (which is Saban attempting to recut, and make a coherent plot tying together, the first three Digimon movies) has the best anime soundtrack ever. It had Smash Mouth’s “All Star” before Shrek did. It also had Barenaked Ladies, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Less Than Jake, and some cool originals written specifically for this recut. Stream “Let’s Kick It Up” for clear skin.

Nagisoid (7): Love some shoegaze representation in rates

phonethephoenix (7): I do love this song, actually. digimon are the champions!!! love the delivery

welcome2thejam (7): Oh, this is so much worse than the main rate one, BUT I'm too inside the nostalgia bubble to not give good marks, sorry but I still imitate the way he says "DIGITAL (WORLD)"

bigbigbee (6): the hook is so iconic that i didn't realize that there was more (bad) stuff to this song

IIIHenryIII (6): this song never did much for me

Poydoo (6): i liked the part where he said digimon

sarcasticsobs (6): I honestly have this refrain pop into my head at least once a month and have since this was released in the US

seanderlust (6): i didn't even watch digimon and i knew this theme growing up

alexismateofan (5): This was always my least favorite opening out of the ones I watched. Like I was fine with it as a kid but listening to it now I have many concerns about what I used to like.

shhhneak (5): They’re never escaping the Pokemon bootleg allegations cause this sounds exactly like the Pokerap.

TakeOnMeByA-ha (5): i have absolutely 0 nostalgia to digimon at all

Verboten\_Prince (5): This that "electropop" you all love so much

zadooi (5): This song is so catchy, but not in a pleasant way. I never watched Digimon as a kid but I definitely know the song.

milkywayinradius (4): i'm just so disappointed bc i finally heard the japanese opening and it was so good compared to the english one

distressedbeatboxing (3): I try not to dunk too hard on Digimon cause I think it was probably the better show between it and Pokemon, but this sucks.

indie\_fan\_ (3): this is so incredibly corny and in a not good way. i do not remember it being this bad back then, not to mention the complete 180 in tone this sets vs the Japanese opening despite opening for the same season

Zypker125 (3): The lyrics are as generic as they could be. I’m pretty sure the person who wrote the lyrics for Digimon had no idea what Digimon was. The song in general is just really soulless and it feels like no one who produced the song actually cared about doing it.

bogo (1): i feel like i'm being pounded in the head with a sledgehammer listening to the chorus of this

ricki (1): girl just use the original

vayyiqra (1): as said elsewhere i think this theme is bad and groanworthy for its incredibly stupid lyrics; having said that there is a theoretically kind of alright beat here but it's way overshadowed by everything else filling me with cringe

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Alright, this is it: the biggest piece of Ronayola on the rate. More than things that will be upcoming, more than things that have come, this show is just extremely special to me and I couldn't just not put it in. And as you might be able to stop in the comments, I'm not the only one! Saint Seiya was the first anime to actually become a hit in Brazil, and basically opened the doors for the industry- this rate probably wouldn't happen if this show didn't exist. Of course, my score isn't just from that- I absolutely believe this theme holds up, and nothing gets me as hyped as hearing the first chorus, be it in portuguese or in english. It absolutely still fucking ROCKS in anime cons. Don't watch the new movie, though. Bad.

**bigbigbee** (6): What Zodiac are they knights of? Cause it looks like mostly the greek gods from a cursory look at wikipedia, which, IDK if they've told you this, but is not actually a zodiac at all. Do the people really dislike the Sagittarius and Gemini Knight?

---

**apatel27** (10): Retro hype machine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What the

**cheatviathan** (10): This is the exact right amount of ‘80s cheese for me. The vocals are suitably epic for this sort of arena rock song, and the wailing guitar notes that punctuate the “Saint Seiya!” chants in the chorus sound awesome AND cause me to laugh uncontrollably. Fun fact. There is a Hollywood live-action adaptation of this one that premiered in theaters back in May, and I absolutely would not have known about it had I not seen a trailer for it before my screening of Suzume. It probably bombed.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is kind of Rush-coded

**MrSwearword** (10): this slaps

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): openings that include the sound effects get an additional point, they add something idk

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is real hot boy shit. benching 4000 lbs and NOT busting a nut listening to THIS!!!

**mongeese0** (9.3): About to go ask my mom to buy me a Saint Seiya action figure wtf this is great

**beeozan** (9.2): found a live version of this on youtube and have to say, dudes were rocking

**Bisonsouro** (9): Brazilian blood allows no less

**welcome2thejam** (9): Old school arena rock sounds crazy good right about now

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): ended bollywood

**Zypker125** (8.2): This and Chobits are the two anime I hadn’t heard of prior to this rate. The opening song feels pretty epic and powerful, which I quite like. It reminds me of old tokusatsu, which I guess shouldn’t be a surprise given how clearly adjacent this is to the tokusatsu genre. [Prediction: Late Day 2]

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**alexismateofan** (8): way better than the OP I got when it first premiered (‘I Ran’ by Bowling For Soup)

**bogo** (8): oh this is 80s as hell, i kinda love it

**impla77** (8): Percy Jackson anime when??

**milkywayinradius** (8): dang the electric guitar goes hard in this song. esp for the chord after they sing SAINT SEIYA

**vexastrae** (8): oh i just know the 80s filipino kids would love this

**sarcasticsobs** (7.8): Omg, we found the most memory-holed show in the whole list, I completely forgot this existed

**dysphorbs** (7): peak 90s anime but less lesbians

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it’s nice but I don’t feel nostalgic somehow

**Lynflower680** (7): Rainbow Dash core

**maybecrf** (7): damn they used to make anime mcs hot as hella 🥵

**prettybirbkotori** (7): i thought i didn't like this but i think it wrapped around to being camp actually

**saturnribbon** (7): love the 80s vibes on this one

**saviorARMY101** (7): This is so 80s lmaoo

**TiltControls** (7): fire emblem early game unit tier lists

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): ok 90s

**vayyiqra** (7): one of the metal-ish themes here i like that's epic

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Rock on dudes!

**wujinan** (7): classic

**ricki** (6.5): boy slut in the red kinda serving

**allodude** (6): give me the awful bowling for soup cover /s

**Awkward\_King** (6): does anyone else think PEGging is a SUS af FANTASY

**hacatu** (6): Generic and the energy blast sfx really don't help it

**nyoom** (5.5): does he turn into a horse...?

**Dragusken** (5): musically sounds like jojo’s old tamer cousin

**macnbee** (5): this reminds me that this rate is missing berserk

**Nagisoid** (5): Zodiac rate I hear you

**phonethephoenix** (5): not my favorite vocal style

**Poydoo** (4): Sound effects again

**Qwilphish** (3): it's showing its age unfortunately

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): i think i just hate most 80’s anime openings im sorry they sound so corny and weird to me

**bigbigbee** (9): Me and two friends did this rate together and this is the only (?) song on the list where none of us could come up with anything to say. And we all like the song a lot! It's solid, but as /u/distressedbeatboxing says...maybe a bit unremarkable.

---

**alexismateofan** (10): That guitar is fucking SHREDDING out, HELL YEAH.

**bogo** (10): 2000s pop punk if it slayed (do the pop punk rate)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): rock on

**MrMushrooms** (10): 'I'm a Believer' would've gotten my 11

**PSSST12** (10): Fandom might be a mess but this bangs

**horridhendy** (9.5): The best OPs suit the anime that they are for, are catchy and are memorable and this is all three.

**Narhun** (9.5): personally prefer Fly High but all the intros are bangers

**TiltControls** (9.5): oh this is the volleyball one!

**Zypker125** (9.4): Haikyuu, the quintessential sports anime! I mostly associate Haikyuu as being the anime with a massive male/male gay shipping fandom, and even from the opening, it’s pretty easy to see why their fandom is so big ~~shoutout to Amaki Sally~~. Onto the song; I like it, the rock instrumental is pretty catchy and the mixing is pretty good here. It’s not bombastic or bold enough to make it into the top tier, but it’s a pretty good listen overall. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**Awkward\_King** (9): no thoughts just men bonding and looking hot and playing volleyball

**maybecrf** (9): this is what i imagined when i pictured what a good intro could sound like

**phonethephoenix** (9): like how the melody works! nice guitars :)

**Qwilphish** (9): special shoutout to OP 2 FLY HIGH!! one of my favorite songs of all time

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Japanese writers are on another level, who else would come up with the idea of a tv show about volleyball and actually make it

**saviorARMY101** (8.5): a bangerrr, also pretty iconic this was played at the olympics

**shhhneak** (8.4): To be fair, you need a High IQ to get it.

**1998tweety** (8): he bops

**DaswefSayLazy** (8): this show was pretty good but once it started to take an entire season to get through one match it was just too slow

**ImAWeebDuh** (8): isnt this about high school volleyball

**Lynflower680** (8): This song perfectly represents the epic highs and lows of high school volleyball.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): A bump-set-spike in a rate is when three people give a song a 2, 1, and 0 and successfully keep it from winning.

**hacatu** (7.5): Hype

**mongeese0** (7.5): Feels like I've heard songs like this dozens of times

**pheromenos** (7.5): hate the way they draw necks

**wujinan** (7.5): I had a great time in high-school sports

**dooper8** (7.4): [Fly High by Burnout Syndrome SLAPs tho]

**impla77** (7.4): lazy kamoshida reference here

**cheatviathan** (7): The jangly rhythm guitars work for me, the chorus melody is catchy as hell.It’s pretty standard, but it executes on this well enough to win me over.

**cremeebrulee** (7): ended the olympics

**Dragusken** (7): much wow, such shounen

**prettybirbkotori** (7): it's alright. anyways haikyuu fans how do you keep up with all these characters. i mean this is only season 1 and theres like 500

**sarcasticsobs** (7): This reminds me of when I got yelled at for not taking high school CYO co-ed volleyball "seriously" enough

**vayyiqra** (7): 90s college radio indie rock inspiration [citation needed] i'm not against it tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Typical sports anime opening but not bad

**welcome2thejam** (7): Does this count as a jock jam

**apatel27** (6): Breakdown not hard enough

**JIRACHI** (6): Rina Sawayama after discovering nouns:

**Nagisoid** (6): The new Sky Ferreira album:

**ricki** (6): this animation is so modern but this is a 2004 song

**distressedbeatboxing** (5.2): Haikyuu is very dear to me and I resent its soundtrack for being unremarkable. I like peanut butter, but have you ever tasted the unsalted kind? This is what it’s like.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i’ll take “things haikyuu fans have to use in order to justify their ships being canon” for 400

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (4.2): it rocks

**BebeLuigi** (4): my best friends are obsessed with this and I do not get it to this day but the one

**plastichaxan** (4): Men doing sports is in theory gay

**Poydoo** (4): I hate the come on come on come ons

**vexastrae** (4): [yaoi mental gymnastics should be an olympic sport](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/949107580683309086/1112511902489268245/image.png)

**amr** (1): Idk what hinata's final obstacle in the story was but I hope he didn't make it

**beeozan** (1): recently while browsing r/japanesemusic I learned spyair had genuine fans and I had to double check. this gets so much worse as it goes on btw its unreal.

**korobizaka** (1): greatest sin of being a boring as hell generic shounen song

**bigbigbee** (9): This song is hype to me, but I heard it at a very critical time (freshman year of high school). I enjoy this but I don't think there's a TON to say about it, and you all seemed to agree. It's good, but nothing incredibly special.

---

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): This song makes me feel thirteen again. In a good way

**Bisonsouro** (10): Paper Moon would have won

**hacatu** (10): It's sickening how good this is. The song, not the anime. When people say they never skip the opening, they're thinking of this opening in particular. It set the standard. Conflict of interest notice: I've seen this anime (but I was a baby please forgive me)

**plastichaxan** (10): ATE those souls omfg

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Now if we were rating openings based on how well they fit the vibe of their own show, this would be my obvious 11. It just sounds like Halloween rock!! I love that!!

**phonethephoenix** (9.6): straight banger

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**alexismateofan** (9): T.M.Revolution does no wrong in music ever.

**BebeLuigi** (9): T.M Revolution omggggg that man is insane

**CrystaltheCool** (9): i know papermoon is the more popular of the two OPs but imo resonance sweeps

**Dragusken** (9): paper moon is better but gonna give diligence where it’s due lol

**impla77** (9): There were some questionable things in the opening that I’m not going to dwell on

**saviorARMY101** (9): A classic for sure

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): Omg, that cat had a witch hat!!! Anotha one where I have no idea what is going on

**allodude** (8): no one sounds quite like TMR

**cheatviathan** (8): Those vocals and guitar leads hit harder than you’d expect, and the little synth flurry before the chorus is hype. The bells are actually worked into the mix quite tastefully, which I did not expect. Good shit all around.

**Nagisoid** (8): :ate:

**pig-serpent** (8): I'm happy that these edgy shonen that actually want to attempt to have an edge exist so that we get jrock songs that actually rock out instead of constantly holding themselves back as to not alienate people who would fall apart upon hearing the slightest amount of distortion.

**vayyiqra** (8): kind of goes hard

**shhhneak** (7.7): VOTE FOR THE HALLOWEEN RATE

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (7): this one is a 7

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i love nonbinary people shoutout to crona

**vexastrae** (6.5): death the kid is so skrunkly to me like ... my boy my son my child

**wujinan** (6.5): used to love this show but song is repetitive

**apatel27** (6): oontz oontz

**nyoom** (6): i love you silly pale bird gentleman (the rest of it can go)

**TiltControls** (6): spookier

**Zypker125** (5.6): Damn, the art style for this show feels very much like a combination of Fairy Tail and One Piece. Anyways, back to the song. It has a very hard-hitting instrumental, which I appreciate, but the instrumental overwhelms the vocals too much and the chorus doesn’t enter high-enough energy to hook me into the song. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**beeozan** (5): I can kinda respect what's going on here but also I dont really enjoy it all that much. More importantly I feel like this invented all the 2010s electronic rock disasters that we had several of in this rate so far. I personally needed them to just not come up with this sound ever

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Yup this definitely sounds like the theme for an anime called Soul Eater. You have to give it that.

**bogo** (5): i feel like i've heard this type of song at least four times throughout this entire rate

**Qwilphish** (5): I'm a little bored but I'm not mad at it

**Roxieloxie** (5): why did the visual opening of this kinda start like fairly odd parents

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): except they didn’t eat anything

**Awkward\_King** (4): nom nom yummy souls

**maybecrf** (4): im so tired

**Poydoo** (4): death note

**prettybirbkotori** (4): i have heard this song at least a dozen times and can never commit what it sounds like to memory

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Why is it so fucking hard to find this on Youtube? Is it some great secret that Japan is keeping from us? Or maybe...protecting us from?

---

**alexismateofan** (11): Bitches, Bros, and Non-binary hoes know what’s UP.

**Awkward\_King** (10): you cant tell me this isnt runaway baby by bruno mars

**shhhneak** (10): Why have cute when you can have gorgeous because this show has the best ending song of all time.

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): oh lets fucken GO

**nyoom** (9.5): this is sk8 but it slaps

**1998tweety** (9): bop, and its GAY

**Dragusken** (9): a preview of bruno mar’s jp performance of “runaway baby”

**hacatu** (9): This goes hard

**impla77** (8.5): JOE

**mongeese0** (8.5): what i'd consider a medium-good op. Didn't mind the autotune

**saviorARMY101** (8.5): I enjoyed how groovy and funky this was

**phonethephoenix** (8.2): it's pretty cool

**Bisonsouro** (8): Cute!

**dreamingpastel** (8): I once had this on repeat while working on a school project in the middle of the night (i.e. trying not to have a mental breakdown). Huh, maybe that colors my rating a little bit...

**horridhendy** (8): I am going to try and be impartial because I absolutely hated the anime…but the song is admittedly fun and catchy

**maybecrf** (8): sunglasses emoji very cool guys sunglasses emoji

**Qwilphish** (8): sorry i wasn't listening i was just looking at the porn flying across my screen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me and my friends tried to watch sk8 together as it was coming out but we had to stop halfway through bc the main villain was actively making us extremely uncomfortable so my opinions on the show are kinda tainted by that. that being said this op slaps

**TiltControls** (7.5): tony hawk pro skater rate when

**cheatviathan** (7): I can see that guitar lead in the verses getting stuck in my head really easily, and the opening bassline gets me pretty hype. The rest of the song fails to match that hype for me, and man, that key change does not feel earned.

**MrSwearword** (7): the key change should only be for acts that can sing in them, but good try for them

**vayyiqra** (7): wonky track not bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I have no opinions on the opening but I would like to say that thanks to the ending my boyfriend is permanently traumatized by palm trees

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**seanderlust** (6): this band would do numbers at van's warped tour in the late 00s. actually, no they wouldn't but they'd be there

**vexastrae** (6): the anime would be better if they were actually gay

**welcome2thejam** (6): Super promising intro, but then it kinda just hit the same type of J-Rock seen in a lot of this rate with no surprises. Still decent, but hard not to want more out of music from a skateboarding anime. Also idk if its the video or on purpose but I'm mixed on the effect on his voice

**beeozan** (5.4): this is really k-pop coded (has insane potential to grow on me but not hitting really rn) but ye this man named his first ep 22 and the album he released next year 23. does he think he’s adele or what.

**Zypker125** (5.2): Another one of the blindside picks of the rate, this being in the rate surprised me because SK8 wasn’t *super* popular (especially in Reddit circles) and I didn’t hear anything about the opening. While SK8 the anime isn’t that popular on Reddit, it notably has an extremely large male/male gay shipping fandom, especially in the fanfiction communities. Music-wise, I like the groovy nature of the song, but the autotune brings the song down some notches, and it’s not much of a dance-club-banger as I personally would have liked (cuz I’m a dance-pop club-banger addict). [Prediction: Day 1]

**apatel27** (5): nothing that hasn't been heard multiple times before

**JIRACHI** (4.5): Rina Sawayama after discovering nouns:

**ImAWeebDuh** (3): similar placement to Hits Different incoming i fear

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Not into these vocal effects

**IIIHenryIII** (2): rather dull

**Nagisoid** (1): I understand why only streamable wanted this horrid song

**prettybirbkotori** (1): spared of a 0 only by something else being somehow worse. put down the vocoder PLEASE

**CrimsonROSET** (10): The discourse about MHA has been fascinating to watch from the sidelines and only from the sidelines because some of you people scare me. For the song itself, I love it! Any OP that wasn't the very first was picked for a reason, be its cultural relevance or just for the sake of keeping the rate interesting and diverse- but for this one it's just the one I think is the best, and I think coming to just break the top half of the rate speaks that not everyone agrees! I just love how bombastic it feels, it grabs you from the first seconds and doesn't let go.

**bigbigbee** (7): This song had its ups and downs, flirting with all three days at different parts during the rate. I like this a lot, and while I've never seen it, I've always enjoyed My Hero Academia as the sort of "next generation" of shonen after I sort of grew out of my anime phase in the early 2010s; it just seems fun and enjoyable.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this was so intense lmao

**DaswefSayLazy** (10): gets me hyped up

**Dragusken** (10): uverworld with an out of this world performance

**maybecrf** (10): MODERN ANIME PERFECTION, finally somebody delivers something both not generic and cinematic in the best ways, thank you

**nyoom** (10): this is k-pop (complimentary)

**phonethephoenix** (10): genuinely not sure why i like this song so much. this would be an 11 contender for me if it had the sax from the bridge of the full song lolll

**PSSST12** (10): Fandom is smelly and full of fetishizers But I can't make this not bop. An 11, Their best OP still.

**Qwilphish** (10): a breath of fresh air in this rate!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): There are a lot of My Hero openings you could have chosen, and guess what? You chose the right one!! This theme was a grower for me, but when it finally hit me it was undeniable. It helped me fall in love with MHA (I then proceeded to fall out of love with it like two years later) and fall in love with UVERworld, who by the way make KILLER pop punk music with an extra dose of sax! Check them out!

**1998tweety** (9.5): kind of a huge banger, rare my hero academia W

**hacatu** (9): Really hype shonen opening that like most things MHA is fairly well trodden but very well executed. The season four opening where they put on the talent show is the best one. Conflict of interest notice: I've seen this anime

**milkywayinradius** (9): i like the different structure of this song and the vocals

**nt96** (9): https://rave.dj/_9dOmzHC2m97HQ

**popularsong** (9): like the edm-y influences and some vocal effects. not that classic j-rock/pop openings arent good but i was getting a bit sick of it by now

**dooper8** (8.8): [Honorable mention for ANY UVERWorld songs, especially Colors of the Heart from Blood+. Underrated goats]

**TiltControls** (8.5): there's a second at the end that sounds so similar to the slack notification sound that I considered bumping it down a point just for that jumpscare

**impla77** (8.3): RAWR I’m so quirky ehe

**alexismateofan** (8): one of UVERworld’s better OP songs.

**Awkward\_King** (8): if you dont play a fucking odd future song after this

**BebeLuigi** (8): I'm a MHA hater but I have to admit this goes hard, it could be a 10 but I saw Bakugou and Mineta in the opening and I was reminded that I hate mha

**cheatviathan** (8): If I were just judging the TV size version, this would probably be lower. The full song actually has a pretty compelling linear build where the guitar embellishments don’t come in until the second verse, and a pretty killer sax solo to boot. The “I keep my ideals” refrain doesn’t come in until the very end, which caught me off guard. Makes you realize how much songs have to be cut around to meet the 90 second quota. I went into this prepared to say “Peace Sign” and “The Day” outsold, but this proved me wrong.

**Roxieloxie** (8): nct:anime

**saviorARMY101** (8): a banger

**distressedbeatboxing** (7.6): Every one of these sounds is dated as hell but I don't mind it one bit.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): The way it kinda sounds like they say Kish at one point… Do alt club rate!

**wujinan** (7.5): a lot of the UVERworld songs sound the same

**agnes\_honey** (7): MHA has better op

**apatel27** (7): K-Pop sounding song

**mongeese0** (7): Don't really enjoy the vocals or the stuttered rhythms. One of the songs where I watched the season and don't remember the song :X

**Poydoo** (7): I hate this show, but I gotta admit, this song is pretty good

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): isnt that the loona subunit

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): love the anime not the biggest fan of the song

**Narhun** (6.5): ngl kinda the worst MHA OP

**shhhneak** (6.3): 93 MILLION views?? I’m scared…

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): this song kinda just went nowhere

**Nagisoid** (6): The first 10 seconds eat in excess which makes them choke and fall off a cliff, you hate to see it

**pig-serpent** (6): This show's best opening is worse than its worst ending.  The EDM for this one is kinda cool but it's still not doing all that much for me. 

SEVEN I really liked the hero killer arc of this show at the time, and All Might calling out Shigaraki for not actually having a philosophy was very refreshing at the end of the 2010s, the decade where every villain needed to have some sort of point or reason to justify their behavior.  However, during season 3 the cracks really started showing for me, starting with that abysmal training arc in the forest, All for One's first appearance where he has every super power, and uses them to have a giant arm to punch things with an nothing else, and the fights were getting insanely dull because everything revolved around a single 8000% power punch or whatever.  I'm still a little curious about going back to the show but I've sadly been told it's not particularly worth it.

**vayyiqra** (6): lol the autotune

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Not the best autotune I’ve heard in my life I’ll be honest.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): Too much going on here and it doesn't gel for me

**Zypker125** (3.8): MHA is an extremely well-known anime, even outside of anime communities. It’s *the* quintessential superhero shounen anime, and I think this anime being released at the height of the Marvel Cinematic Universe definitely bolstered the hype and fandom for the show (it has a lot of obvious appeal for kids in the Western hemisphere who may have grown up more with comic books and cartoons, as MHA definitely has the most appeal on those fronts). Onto the song itself; unfortunately, I do not like it much. The verse kinda drags and the autotune in the pre-chorus sounds super grating. The transitions and mixing of the instrumental in the chorus are also not my favorite, they feel too sudden and the chorus doesn’t feel like it flows well. [Prediction: Day 1]

**vexastrae** (3.5): if we were rating fandoms this would be my 0. anyways the autotune is fine i guess

**horridhendy** (2): This one is all over the place. Don’t like the vocal modulation either. It’s a no from me.

**ImAWeebDuh** (2): why did the song decide to stutter so much near the end

**beeozan** (1): this is not real this is not real this is not real

**KuhBus** (0): the autotune... No no nonono

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now. absolutely iconic

**BebeLuigi** (10): TACHIBANA KANADE THE GIRL YOU WERE TO 15 YEARS-OLD ME... AND I WAS GAY SO THAT WAS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE

**evanbrooks324** (10): a classic what can I say

**RandomHypnotica** (10): seems like a pretty shitty trade offer to me

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): Lambchop - My Face Your Ass (1997)

**agnes\_honey** (8.5): that's art

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): Oh, this series is gonna make me cry once I finally watch it, isn't it?

**cheatviathan** (8): Unlike a lot of the other more elegantly arranged OPs in this rate, this one manages to keep my attention with some interesting instrumental details. Those sporadic string runs in the first verse, leading into those reverby guitars, and the acoustic guitar strumming in the second verse are highlights for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): nice harmonies

**KuhBus** (8): Dramatic!

**prettybirbkotori** (8): hate the show but i can admit when a song fucks

**korobizaka** (7.8): Quintessential anime OP. i always skip it on my playlists lol

**nyoom** (7.5): reminds me of a younha song

**horridhendy** (7): I know people love this one and it’s good for sure but it’s not up there with my favourites tbh.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I know this song is a fan fav, I just think it's okay

**wujinan** (7): classic vibes

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): anime is so cool i wish japan was real

**beeozan** (6.5): Maeda Jun is notorious for being a better pianist than a writer (which is true) but his melodies work best standalone (or at least, not this diluted with guitars/drums) imo. Lia slays the chorus (especially the second part of the last chorus omg) but overall I can’t say I return to this too much.

**hacatu** (6.5): Nice

**MrSwearword** (6): cute but then the singing goes out the window

**nt96** (6): idk what’s with sad anime and bright blue skies but they slap I guess

**pig-serpent** (6): I remember the Angel Beats music being really good even if I haven't gone back to it in years.  That said, this OP is very plain, even if fairly well executed.  I think I remember a lot of the other songs being better. 

SIX Angel Beats has a few incredibly sad moments that it pulls off really well but ultimately it still feels like tear bait, and I remember the plot being confusing.  I'm happy I watched it but I don't think it's a classic or anything.

**saturnribbon** (6): I

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): helena cant hear you shes wearing beats ect ect

**vexastrae** (6): why does this lowkey make a good song for a rhythm game

**apatel27** (5): completely unearned orchestral drop

**DaswefSayLazy** (5): This show sucked but the opening is pretty decent

**popularsong** (5): uhhh its a song

**Zypker125** (4.7): Angel Beats is a staple anime from the early 2010s, being one of the classic “cry bait” anime that even now still remains as one of the go-to recommendations for anime newbies looking to tear up. However, don’t get me wrong: Angel Beats is very much an “anime” through and through, and that encompasses many of anime’s weaker cliches and tropes. It didn’t appeal to me, although it did have a solid conclusion. For the opening itself, I unfortunately just don’t connect with it. Despite the heavy use of the piano, it doesn’t feel that emotional to me, and the vocal delivery too is missing the extreme-melancholy flavor that I would have liked. [Prediction: Day 2]

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): ive heard this exact song 500 times before

**allodude** (3): kinda forgettable

**AmandaYoung2083** (3): I didn't like this in middle school and I don't like it now! Continuity.

**ricki** (1): boring

# This song has a piano in it

**imasalesman** (10): The piano intro is just so iconic

**phonethephoenix** (10): love the piano and the driving beat!

**Poydoo** (10): That piano in the start is enough to make this a 10 on its own

**saviorARMY101** (10): Great opening theme, the piano melody is gorgeous and the singer has a lovely voice

**Qwilphish** (9): https://media.tenor.com/j_DUeuoAnXgAAAAd/piano-piano-on-fire.gif

**indie\_fan\_** (8.9): the piano said "lemme carry this entire song"

**Dragusken** (8): the piano really hooks you in

**Nagisoid** (8): Where's the beat? I only heard a TWINKly piano

**vayyiqra** (8): cool piano

**DutchPeasant** (7): The piano sure elevates the song, with it being the primary focus for the first 20 seconds being a nice touch. The singing and other instruments can't match it though.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): piano man found dead on a ditch

**JIRACHI** (6): her ass was NOT playing the piano in the youtube video i'm crying

**CrystaltheCool** (5): It's not a bad song but it's not very interesting, I feel like the only reason it's propped up as a classic is due to the piano intro creating a vibe of prestige as well as the strength of the anime itself.

**maybecrf** (2): its hard to make a piano sound bad, so congrats i guess

# This video has a gun in it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Is the gun that one girl’s instrument?? When they do a modern update of 1812 Overture.

**alexismateofan** (7): you know what this anime op needed? A GUN. thank goodness it was there.

**welcome2thejam** (7): This opening was all fun and games until red-haired girl pulled out the glock

# This rate has a TK in it

**TiltControls** (8): TK?!?

**seanderlust** (7.5): I was gonna make a TK joke but when I googled the character apparently he is "a mysterious character who speaks in semi-nonsensical English quoted from pop culture" and tbf that's like half my rate comments so i'll just say me and move on

**impla77** (7.3): anyway obligatory TK IS IN THIs?!?! comment

**CrimsonROSET** (11): And here, we have my 11! If you check earlier in the cycle, this was probably not even up for consideration- I had already settled for FLYERS a while back while making the tracklist. But the more I heard it, the more it grew on me, through the cornyness and the arena feel of it. I don't know, it's kinda a simplistic and childish hopeful message, but isn't that what all anime is about? It's about big adventures, that while can't be replicated 1:1 in our day to day lives (as opposed to what many believe, I am not a demon dog boy) but I still like to hold onto that belief that everyone can change the world. Hell, I convinced popheads that this rate was a good idea, that's gotta speak for something. So, I guess what I'm saying is that if you complained about the sound effects you're going to hell

**bigbigbee** (8): If you want to change the world, I personally think that you should [redacted] and then probably also [redacted] 

 I don't expect this to be true for the majority of this raterbase, but this sound is very nostalgic to me - I grew up on DVDs of old Asian media, and there was always SOME song that sounded like this. I'm very fond of it and I wish this could have done better (though mid-Day 2 is not at all bad) but I get why this sound doesn't appeal to everyone.

---

**apatel27** (10): There's something about these old stadium rock styled songs that just hit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh fuck now this one I definitely remember from occasionally staying up to watch Toonami.

**flava** (10): sounds like a rate winner

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if this wins, I won’t be mad

**milkywayinradius** (10): song makes me hopeful for the future. be the change u want to see, everyone

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/6O1E4DfmxEMdyw

**agnes\_honey** (9.5): anthem

**Bisonsouro** (9.5): Beloved

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): This one fucking rules! The chorus is giving major ABBA vibes.

**shhhneak** (9.3): Tell me why I had to sneak watch this in my house growing up like it was the Playboy channel.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): perhaps my hottest OG anime take is I thought Inuyasha was kind of overrated, but I just liked it less than my one high school friend who stanned it. Banger theme song tho

**hacatu** (9): Did one of the best jobs of making me want to watch the anime

**sarcasticsobs** (9): I would give my life for Kagome Higurashi and Sango

**vayyiqra** (9): another show i had many friends into back in the day but never seen it however this theme bangs wtf? no one told me!

**vexastrae** (9): the bishounen babygirl ever ..... giving u all the kisses rn muah muah muah

**saturnribbon** (8): this is also super nostalgic for me lol. Baby’s first anime. I downloaded a bunch of the OPs/EDs and background tracks from YouTube to put on my iPod

**saviorARMY101** (8): this screams 90s anime theme song but in a good way

**wujinan** (8): timeless

**dooper8** (7.8): [Fukai Mori by Do as Infinity would be my 11 for Anime endings if done. Kimi Ga Inai Mirai would be my preferred opening]

**TiltControls** (7.5): I remember watching this show when it'd come on as 'late night programming' on one of the channels I used to watch. I don't think I ever actually understood what was going on though

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): breaking my bit to mention that i avoided this show for years because a girl in the 4th grade told me it was straight up porn and i just believed her

**horridhendy** (7): Love this anime, full nostalgia vibes but this OP is admittedly a bit cheesy

**ricki** (7): almost paaaaradiseeeeee

**Senn\_Kyu** (7): as much of a fan I am of V6 even watching their livestreamed final concert, I also watched Inuyasha as a child and completely forgot about this theme song but it's ok V6 has many better songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): these men are in their 50s and the lyric video i watched for this song has them doing silly heart hand poses im kinda obsessed

**phonethephoenix** (6.8): I like the percussion, but the vocals are pretty average

**impla77** (6.2): I really feel s club 7 could sing this

**Awkward\_King** (6): this is kinda corny..

**bogo** (6): it's giving 80s group charity single with a dance beat

**Dragusken** (6): I WANT TO CHANGE THE SONG, to something else

**welcome2thejam** (6): Don't really remember what happened in this show, but I do have a lot of nostalgia for it as an Adult Swim anime mainstay that I'd put on while trying to sleep to the tv's glow

**nyoom** (5.5): g.o.d b-track

**cheatviathan** (5): If not for the chorus melody and the first post-chorus, there would be literally nothing for me to latch onto. This song is just a resounding meh from me.

**JIRACHI** (5): when a flop talks about changing the world 🤣🤣 WHO ARE YOU???

**dysphorbs** (4): idk why but this sounds like it would play in weeb church

**KuhBus** (4): Probably the biggest case of 'the German opening holds up so much better' because the original doesn't even remotely fit the vibes.

**pig-serpent** (4): The opposite of most of these openings, the verses are pretty fun but that hook blows.

**AmandaYoung2083** (3.8): Mid Inuyasha opening imo

**mongeese0** (3): Definitely a song where you can guess what time period it came from. Don't think this style aged that well

**MrSwearword** (3): the ending themes, mainly "Come" by Namie Amuro outsold the theme. Doesn't mean Inuyasha isn't iconic, but the theme ain't good.

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (2): do they know its christmas ass sounding song

# The SFX add crunch! Like nuts in a sundae!!!

**1998tweety** (10): the sound effects in the video send me but the song is still a BOP

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): they should keep adding sound effects to shit I'll gobble it up

**beeozan** (9.5): this arrow sfx struck my heart GOD it hurts someone save me from the pain. NOW THIS IS BOY BAND MUSIC these synths are doing something to me and I'll know you guys will rob it already it's so sad

**Qwilphish** (9.5): the added effects are so funny, but besides that its so joyful!

**allodude** (9): I still find it odd that there are SFX in the song

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): the ridiculous amount of corny sound effects from the opening genuinely make me like this more

**alexismateofan** (7): real talk since we’re only talking about the music, I really needed them to do less sound effects in the songs sometimes. These days, it’s far less prevalent but the early 2000s, late 90s LOVED this and i do not understand WHY.

**dreamingpastel** (7.2): Not the sound effects 😭

**maybecrf** (7): the sound effect additions are camp

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Are we rating the sound effects too?

**Nagisoid** (6): The sound effects are unserious as fuck I can't stop laughing

**Narhun** (6): ok but why are all the sound effects there

**Zypker125** (4.9): Inyuasha, similar to Yu Yu Hakusho, is another one of these “anime that was popular with Gen X and has a huge 2000s fanfiction following, but isn’t as popular with the current Gen Z anime audience”. I think the opening song here has potential, but it’s hampered by the loud sound effects randomly dispersed throughout the opening verse, and I’m more of a high-octane energy person, so this isn’t exactly for me. [Prediction: Day 1]

**Poydoo** (2.6): Ruined by the sound effects

agnes\_honey (8): iconic

alexismateofan (8): wait no this actually kinda slaps.

milkywayinradius (8): wow an actual song for the english opening? i'm impressed that theres actual words and melody

saviorARMY101 (8): Can’t deny this is a classic

**bigbigbee** (7): My friend in college liked this anime but she would always mistakenly call it "lupong the third", I think because of this opening. This song basically always hovered right around this position - we love the consistency.

---

**apatel27** (11): This song. This Riff. The definition of iconic. It has influenced every jazz OP since it originally came out in. From the original only vocal version of Part 1 to the Part 6 version with the punk rock influence, this is one of the most iconinc and instantly recognisable themes in anime history.

**1998tweety** (10): serve

**beeozan** (10): when this gets robbed will lupin be behind it. Also crazy how these people have been composing music for this show since the late 70s, like damn that's passion. And this composition has so many little subtle touches that keep growing on me more and more dare i say it might be better than tank

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): vibes

**DutchPeasant** (10): For more than 40 years we kept getting variations on this classic theme YET somehow Yuji Ohno keeps pulling it off time after time. Might be my favourite version of them all, the little changes can add so much to it.

**vexastrae** (10): classy and iconic who else does it like mr lupin the third

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): wowza! really just love the visual pairing itself that gives the character designs real finesse n' meat on da bone!

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): there's something abt those synth jolts in the beginning and then a jazzy mystery theme that... it just gets me. ok mario galaxy

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): I'm noticing how the instrumental + spy/detective-esque openings are turning out to be my favorites here

**macnbee** (9): MORE BRASS IN ANIME OPENINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**hacatu** (8.5): Beginning is ten/ten

**alexismateofan** (8): hello jigen are you free on saturday

**allodude** (8): styyyyyyle

**cheatviathan** (8): The synth experiments don’t work well for me here, but the rest of this instrumental is an immaculate vibe. At the very least, the xylophone solo goes off. We need more xylophone solos in modern music.

**Nagisoid** (8): Is Lupin a Main Bond Girl?

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Groovy

**Senn\_Kyu** (8): one of the melodies really reminds me of that song from Mulan 2

**wujinan** (8): the og

**phonethephoenix** (7.8): nice vibe! need a bit more though idk

**impla77** (7): kinda reminds me of music from the Monopoly Wii game (no one else is gonna know what I’m talking about)

**KuhBus** (7): The animation does the heavy lifting here

**nyoom** (7): this is fine

**pig-serpent** (7): This might be impressing me the least of the instrumental jazz tracks tbh.

**ricki** (7): anime animators really put their heart into it when it comes to drawing boobs

**vayyiqra** (7): this is a show about a spy right because the theme kind of sounds like it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Every instrumental jazz opening wants to be TANK! so bad

**Poydoo** (6.5): Kinda boring but at least it's pleasant

**Narhun** (6): I feel like I've heard this exact song quite a few times now

**saviorARMY101** (6): a jazzy light bop

**welcome2thejam** (6): My knowledge of this is limited mostly to that one Lupe Fiasco line in Touch the Sky

**Zypker125** (5.4): Another “WTF” pick from the songlist is here; while Lupin may be a well-recognizable figure, the Lupin anime seasons aren’t very highly-watched, especially in international circles, so it surprised me to see the theme song from one of Lupin’s latest installments to make the songlist, especially since I hadn’t heard anything about the opening prior to this rate. It’s again a fully-instrumental opening, which makes sense given how Baccano and Great Pretender also are fully-instrumental and the three are all similar genres. However, this is definitely the least memorable of the three for me; it lacks the vivacious energy of Great Pretender’s opening and it lacks the adventurous feeling of Baccano’s opening. [Prediction: Late Day 1]

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the opening kinda tanks the song

**maybecrf** (5): diet sugar free cowboby bebop

**prettybirbkotori** (5): maybe i'm experience crime show instrumental song fatigue but i like this one the least of the genre

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): mamma mia i cooka the pizza

**Qwilphish** (4): How many more of these jazzy instrumentals are we getting

**Dragusken** (2): not for me personally…

**villblomst** (2): sick of the jazz intros

**bigbigbee** (7): The opening bars of this song promise something better than the end product - something a little more Origa: Rise-shaped - but it's still not bad, and it grew on me during this past week prepping for the reveal. 

 This anime is one of several iterations of this set of characters, the most recent of which I believe is a gacha game called Fate Grand Order?

---

**korobizaka** (11): thank you for including the 2nd opening instead of the LiSA one cause OMG Kalafina is so amazing. everything they sing is gold and to the beginning had always been my favorite of theirs because while i feel like it captures the triumph and devastation of the show... kalafina's voices are so powerful and beautiful, and kajiura yuki is a composing goddess and i think in to the beginning moreso than any of her other works, her baroque pop style meshes perfectly with kalafina's voices.

**shhhneak** (11): Yeah so this is my favourite anime of all time. I don’t know why this made the imprint on my brain that it did but it’s perfection. The animation, the character relationships, the concept… if this wins the rate I will finally get a tattoo of Rin’s command seal.

**1998tweety** (10): y'all need to get into Kalafina cause their discography is immaculate

**BebeLuigi** (10): I'm so glad you chose this one and not oath sign

**horridhendy** (10): Suitably dramatic OP. Just fits the anime so perfectly.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this title feels like a setup

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so dramatic I live, I better not see any plays on the name with your scores

**popularsong** (10): between giving this + elfen lied + aot a 10 i wonder if every song can be improved with a choir or some chanting /j

**villblomst** (10): I LOVE THIS ONE

**DutchPeasant** (9): Kalafina is known for her great songs, but this one especially is my favourite of them. Gently building up to the climax, oh so beautiful in its tragedy.

**phonethephoenix** (9): I don't love the structure (?) of the second half of the song but like. vocals!!! 😍

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): this is so Kate Bush - Wuthering Heights [citation needed]

**alexismateofan** (8): Kinda eats TBH though I think it’s one of the weaker opening songs Fate has done.

**CrystaltheCool** (8): gotta hand it to kalafina

**Dragusken** (8): sounds nice and angelic

**mongeese0** (8): Another "qunitessential anime-opening sounding" song. Feel like I've heard a dozen shows with this same exact sound. Even if it's one of the first ones, didn't feel that outstanding

**saviorARMY101** (8): Nice opener, love the singer’s voice and the use of strings

**pig-serpent** (7.5): There's a very nice balance of orchestral touches and a driving rock beat, and the end result is both energetic and pretty.

**apatel27** (7): Vocals don't do the instrumental justice

**cheatviathan** (7): A solid OP. The vocals are great enough to elevate an otherwise okay instrumental. Maybe I was just too floored by “Magia” from Madoka, but I was expecting more from a song written by Yuki Kajiura and performed by Kalafina. At the very least, I was expecting something heavier, where the strings don’t take precedence over the guitars.

**KuhBus** (7): ufotable cannot make bad openings

**Nagisoid** (7): Tár The Beginning

**vayyiqra** (7): we're back to that "epic" choral vibe rock on japan

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sure I guess

**sarcasticsobs** (6.7): I trust that red-eyed blonde chef with my life

**hacatu** (6.5): Generic but pretty good

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): this is what every anime opening sounded like in the 2000s

**bogo** (6): it gets a petty 6 cause the video got copyright blocked. also it's just alright

**Poydoo** (6): death note

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): every time someone brings up the fate series i feel the need to tell the story of the time when my super religious grandparents heard that i liked anime and they wanted to get me an anime gift for christmas, so they bought me a figure of joan of arc…from fate/grand order. i have never watched or played fate in my life and did not have the heart to tell them that they bought me a figure from a borderline ecchi game that has no correlation to joan of arc from real life

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (5.8): hmmm

**Zypker125** (5.7): First, obligatory “Brave Shine and Oath Sign should have been in over this song” (both are more well-liked and highly-rated). Fate/Zero is an anime written by Gen Urobuchi, who is commonly nicknamed “the Urobutcher” due to his surprisingly gruesome and tragic storylines. Urobuchi has written highly-acclaimed shows such as Madoka Magica, Psycho-Pass, and Kamen Rider Gaim (the show that had the most impact on me and completely blew my mind as a tween). Fate/Zero is arguably the go-to recommendation for “death game battle royale” anime, with its fair share of tragic deaths and intense thrills. Onto the song; I personally find it middling, whilst it has emotional vocals and a very cinematic feel, the song doesn’t pick up at any point for me and it is in need of a more intense chorus, because it barely feels like a chorus to me. [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**nyoom** (5): yeah of COURSE i know *squints at title card* fate ipvo. anyway i'm not impressed

**vexastrae** (5): eh its fine i guess

**welcome2thejam** (5): Show title is completely asking for it

**wujinan** (5): i sleep

**ricki** (4.5): those clouds are a stock video

**beeozan** (3.5): mad respect to Yuki Kaijura but this song is weird. The chorus kicks off at the same energy as the verse which feels wrong, the backing vocals are SOO overused (doubly so in the full ver) and the general flow of the song feels unnatural to me idk. Obviously the lady is good at her symphonic classical type beat and it shows up in this song but it's just not a good song

**Awkward\_King** (3): idk how to explain this but im a bigger fan of the songs here that sound like sugar and sweets than like.. olive oil?

**Qwilphish** (3): you will never be nge

**maybecrf** (2): generically bad

**bigbigbee** (7): It's a jazzy instrumental opening, which I always like but don't find myself with much to say about! I will say that the opening *animation* is really fun - I love the color palette that the animators chose. I'll put this one on my list!

---

# Gowboy Pepop

**DaswefSayLazy** (9): i feel like its trying to invoke Cowboy Bebop

**vayyiqra** (9): jazz theme concept clearly lifted from tank! (it's even the bebop genre lmao) but whatever this also does slap

**vexastrae** (8): wait youre not cowboy bebop ...

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's like TANK! but without the rizz

**shhhneak** (6.7): The Saul Bass visuals and jazziness is inspired but she’s greatly pretending to be Cowboy Bebop.

**bogo** (6): tank from wish

**maybecrf** (6): she thought she was giving TANK! but she was giving INFANTRY?

**saviorARMY101** (6): I like the jazzy neo-noir style but at the same time I feel like Cowboy Bebop did it much better :/

**Qwilphish** (5.5): we have to knock it down for being an instrumental -- and it has nothing on Cowboy Bebop

**mongeese0** (5): Guessing 7 "TANK at home" comments. (*HOST'S NOTE: 10 actually but extremely close guess!*) Song felt a little meandering, didn't feel like each section transitioned well.

# Yes! You should do this! 
**Nagisoid** (8): Listen to Miles Davis if you like this

---

**1998tweety** (10): G.rate P.winner

**Awkward\_King** (10): one thing abt me im gonna eat up a pink panther esque intro sequence

**cheatviathan** (10): I never think of this song as an OP. I mostly associate it with the full version, whose movements frequently soundtrack the best parts of the series. The full seven minute shebang is one of the most dynamic pieces in this rate. The chill breakdown past the two minute mark is just transcendent, and listening to it build back up is a thrill to behold. Watch this show if you like heist movies. The english dub is top tier. They namecheck Mike Portnoy at one point, so that’s how you know it’s good.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended everyone else here

**ImAWeebDuh** (10): ok WHY did this go so hard wtf

**phonethephoenix** (10): ! like the runs at the end

**popularsong** (10): big fan of the pink panther chunes

**RandomHypnotica** (10): jazzy funky fresh

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this one is like 7 minutes and clearly WANTS to be 7 minutes...holky shit we got ourselves another smash

**Zypker125** (9.4): I forgot how much of a TedX styled video the G.P. opening was. The opening is one of the few fully-instrumental songs on here, and the frenetic jazz musicality makes for an energetic, lively and exciting soundtrack that wonderfully sets the tone for the show. Great Pretender is a very Hollywood-inspired heist show, and the opening is a great reflection of what the anime has to offer. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**alexismateofan** (9): I’m always down for more jazz.

**Dragusken** (9): i like it, gives me michiko to hatchin vibes

**plastichaxan** (9): Ricki called this monsters inc song and that made me give it one full extra point

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Snappin' my fingers and tappin' my leg and orderin' a whiskey neat

**seanderlust** (9): love a jazzy moment! shoutout to the saxophonist

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Such an absolute batshit crazy theme tune, I bet all those musicians must've had a GREAT time in the studio.

**TiltControls** (8.5): funky

**impla77** (8.4): smooth

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Ya like anime?

**hacatu** (8): Short and sweet

**nyoom** (8): *thumping on the tv to make it focus again*

**wujinan** (7.5): jazz but not as good

**macnbee** (7): this reminds me of the incredibles soundtrack!! best pixar movie btw.

**pig-serpent** (7): It sets the tone well but doesn't stand out amongst similar songs.

**ricki** (7): monsters inc

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): who put a straight up jazz improvisation in my anime ops rate

**welcome2thejam** (7): Super fun jazzy/aesthetic combo

**Poydoo** (6.5): Opening is cool but the song doesn't do much on its own

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): somethin about a crime show that makes people wanna have an instrumental trumpet heavy opening. and it's a good impulse they're fun

**apatel27** (4): Had high hopes for this but it's really derivative. If you're gonna do a jazz OP don't pull bars straight from other classic OPs

**beeozan** (4): yutaka yamada kinda poggers of an anime composer for vinland saga but i never watched this show and this opening is my least favorite of the anime meets jazz openings in the rate. on my quest to listen to full versions of every song I realized the full version of this song is 7 minutes which is like wow, you shortened it to 65 seconds for the show and added mad men opening core visuals. the full version shouldve been multiple songs and it isnt which is very annoying for me right now.

**horridhendy** (3): This one is kinda frantic and annoying

**IIIHenryIII** (3): no way I’m listening to the 7 minute version

**villblomst** (3): why are jazz only anime openings such a big thing

**bigbigbee** (7): I saw a post from a man who was like "watching Spy x Family made me realize that I want a wife and kids" and I was like...oh buddy 

 This show seems really fun and cute from everything I've seen about it - I definitely want to check it out!

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this looks super fun maybe i should watch. song’s a bop

**impla77** (10): okay what is this peanut business bc my weeb friend (who vehemently states she IS NOT a weeb) was wearing a t shirt with this kid on it about liking peanuts and hating carrots or something???

**phonethephoenix** (10): great horns great vocals catchy!!

**popularsong** (10): omg another surprise from "artist i normally dont really like" this is so good?? maybe i should check them again i just really didnt fuck w pretender and shukumei

**RandomHypnotica** (10): when you're in a gay threesome or something idk

**ricki** (10): why is the clip art eating

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): the animation fucking ripped it up here

**1998tweety** (9.5): bop

**pheromenos** (9.5): loid forger can top me

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): This is SO cute to watch. And loving these guitars and drums, wow.

**mongeese0** (9.2): Song's production felt higher budget than normal? if that makes sense?

**alexismateofan** (9): oh this gave me goosebumps.

**Around-town** (9): I've had this song in my playlist since it came out and I had no idea this was an anime opening

**Dragusken** (9): i’m biased because i think this is a cute contrast to the ending but take this rating from the peanuts! gallery

**KuhBus** (9): A beautiful example of style and song being in perfect harmony for an opening. Could just use a dash more jazz.

**vayyiqra** (9): all i know about this show is from memes and every cosplayer on the internet doing a shoot as yor when it came out (not a bad thing it's a cool look). did not know the theme was another bebop-influenced heater that's awesome. might even watch this show the animation looks cool

**welcome2thejam** (9): https://youtube.com/watch?v=9hoEYaLuDdc

**nyoom** (8.5): but if YOU'RE a spy... and I'M a spy... then WHO'S WATCHING THE KID

**Qwilphish** (8.5): It starts off a bit slow for me but it really picks up into something great

**seanderlust** (8): this feels like a metaphor KKB would come up with (complimentary)

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): Even though I watched Spy x Family, this didn’t sound familiar until I remembered it’s because I always skipped it oops 😶 but it’s a bop

**TiltControls** (7.5): love the storybook visual vibe of the opening

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): ended the incredibles

**korobizaka** (7.3): its a paint-by-numbers higedan song, but even the average higedan song rules

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is cute, but it gets kinda overly frantic in the middle.

**cheatviathan** (7): This is one of those where I can’t really make heads or tails of it after repeated listens. I love the jazzy instrumental palette, especially that walking bassline. But the vocal melody on the chorus doesn’t really gel with what’s going on instrumentally, and the trap percussion in the second verse is certainly a choice. As of this writing, I’m leaning more towards respect than disdain. This show has a little something for everyone. Highly recommended.

**CrystaltheCool** (7): i like souvenir more but this is good

**DaswefSayLazy** (7): absolutely love this show but i dont love the opening

**prettybirbkotori** (7): this is alright i gotta watch this eventually huh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im sure spy x family is probably a really good show but the fans are literally some of the most insufferable ever so im refusing to watch it solely based on that

**vexastrae** (7): i need to watch this eventually

**wujinan** (7): fun

**apatel27** (6): Mixing is weird

**bogo** (6): at first i was confused why the video was so different from the thumbnail and then i realized what the premise of the anime was

**hacatu** (6): I felt really bait and switched by the beginning vs the rest of it

**Poydoo** (6): Probably the worst of all the openings and closings for this show

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Wait I'm kinda disappointed I thought this would be more slay

**Zypker125** (6): Spy x Family, the super-hyped-up comedy action anime that hooked everyone in with its fun and accessible premise of “the dad’s a secret spy, the mom’s a secret spy, the kid’s a secret clairvoyant, and none of the family members know each other’s secrets”. Whilst starting off with a strong first half, the second half of the first season was viewed as underwhelming to many, as it focused more on domestic comedy and less on spy-assassin espionage, with the mom being particularly shafted and relegated to a domestic role. However, Spy x Family is still widely liked by many; I am unfortunately not one of those people though, and that extends to the opening. To be honest, I can’t really explain why I don’t like the opening, since on paper it has most of the elements I like; I think I just the instrumental doesn’t quite fit the vocals and the overall direction of the song feels a little all over the place. [Prediction: Late Day 2]

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i love this animation style a lot!!

**IIIHenryIII** (5): where the nuts at?

**Nagisoid** (5): The Walmart organic aisle:

**maybecrf** (4): this is both unique and boring, thats crazy

**pig-serpent** (4): This song is really freaking cluttered!  Everything that's happening is cool but it's way too much.

**JIRACHI** (3): love the show DOWN but this has never been my favorite opening

**beeozan** (1): this is clickbait in song form. exciting 10 seconds followed up by the most generic boring ass song ever. its kinda similar to spy x family in that regard but at least the show was (for the most part) enjoyable even after it fell off a cliff in episode 5

**bigbigbee** (9.5): GOATed running music 

 Yeah, this is another one of the ones that is good-but-a-bit-generic that I think I personally love due to fondness for both the series and the period of my life when I saw it (high school). It had some times in Day 3, but ultimately fell a bit short.

---

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**beeozan** (10): kinda crazy how they got the mix of electric guitars, annoying synths and anime-opening core vocals EXACTLY right in this recipe. I never watched Gurren Lagann and my gut reaction was to tank this song to infinity but it was not meant to be and I would come to recognize the slay after all

**phonethephoenix** (10): good melody and vocals!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): How can you not love this? This is a classic of the form, this is what should pop into your head when you think "anime opening"

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): God what a fun anime that's split into 4 super digestable arcs over 26 episodes? need that in the economy

**korobizaka** (9.8): kamina

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): this slaps

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): let’s rock

**saturnribbon** (9): this is super nostalgic for me

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): I trust the red-haired, bazooka-wielding woman with my life

**wujinan** (8.5): this song had a profound impact on my life

**alexismateofan** (8): We’re really drillin’ out here today fellas!!!!

**cheatviathan** (8): A rather passionate rock rager that’s a perfect fit for my third favorite anime of all time. When this kicks in during the finale, I always get shivers down my spine.

**DaswefSayLazy** (8): lets see you grit those teeth

**Dragusken** (8): a good rocking time

**Nagisoid** (8): Authentic drill music

**vayyiqra** (8): one time my friend tried to sell me on this show and explain the premise to me and it to this day makes no sense to me but theme kind of rocks

**bogo** (7.5): i feel like i've heard part of this before but idk

**BebeLuigi** (7): Kamina omggggggg I'm free if you know what I mean heyyyy

**mongeese0** (7): Feels like it could've gone harder

**prettybirbkotori** (7): i remember this being more fun than it actually is

**nyoom** (6.5): THIS is the gurren lagann op? i am flaccid

**impla77** (6.2): TRANSFORMERS??

**apatel27** (6): A song that won't pierce the heaven (8.0 barrier)

**Awkward\_King** (6): they look like gays at brunch

**hacatu** (6): Pretty bland, how did this get on the list but not BNA/Kill La Kill/Edgerunners/PS&G?

**pig-serpent** (6): It's doing that cool chorus meh verse j-rock thing again, but now with crazy breakbeats. 

 FOUR Most of this show was so boring to me.  Most of the fights were pretty explosions with no choreography, which got stale around episode 3, and fights have no stakes when it's all determined by who has more willpower because a shonen protag is never going to lose that battle.  It's a shame though, because this show has so many great moments, such as the underground village, the big death, and the post-time skip political section until everyone is friends again at the end.

**saviorARMY101** (6): it’s a decent song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): ive always thought this art style was so ugly

**vexastrae** (6): eh its okay

**Zypker125** (5.8): Another shounen mecha-action classic from the 2000s, Gurren Lagann is both very popular and very highly-rated in the anime circles. That extends to the opening as well, which has remained a huge favorite 15 years later and is one of the few openings from the 2000s to retain a huge fanbase throughout the years. Unfortunately, I never got the hype for the opening, as I find it to be a generic opening and exactly what I’d expect from a shounen action anime. It tries hard to be catchy, but again because of the mixing, the song just doesn’t stick with me (the forgettable visuals of the opening don’t really help either). [Prediction: Early Day 2]

**maybecrf** (4): did it get quieter during the peak? what are we doing here

**Poydoo** (4): death note

**Qwilphish** (2): Maybe it's the fatigue but I've heard this song a billion times already

**bigbigbee** (7): I always got this confused with Guilty Crown. And even the OPs are kind of similar (guess they must have come out at the same time). Anyway, I relate to this anime because I also like looking at art of swords online 

 This one was rising towards the end, and maybe if we'd gotten more ballots from popheads who aren't as familiar with anime, she could have soared even higher!

---

# Love us some (L-A-)L-I-S-A

**dooper8** (9.6): [the LiSA chokehold]

**agnes\_honey** (9.5): LiSA needs a statue

**dreamingpastel** (8.5): This score is entirely because LiSA is an absolute queen.

**Dragusken** (8): quintessential lisa

**beeozan** (3): ok I had a mental note of this as “the better lisa song in the rate” and now I’m listening and I think I’m just a lisa hater in general cuz I don’t like this either. the part where it’s like “i wanna always be with u” is good because she is pseudo-whispering and not doing whatever she normally does with her vocals which sounds not as good


# Shots at the show's quality

**BebeLuigi** (10): I'm a proud SAO anti but even I have to give credit where its due this song kinda defined the 2012 anime generation...

**Zypker125** (9.5): Ah, Sword Art Online. SAO is many people’s first introduction into anime, and it’s one of the most notorious anime as a result of its divisive critical-reception, being a frequent punching bag for more hardcore anime fans. This was also my first introduction into anime, and I was addicted to this anime when I was a tween. Looking back, I can definitely see the numerous plot issues and character mishandlings the show had, but I think the concept and ideas presented in the show are still very interesting ~~also, this anime has incest in it, which is a plus in its favor~~. For the opening itself, I still like it quite a lot. The opening notes and instrumental are iconic and a fantastic opener to the song, and the mixing in this song is a lot better than most other openings. The singer absolutely goes off, delivering absolute vocal power while simultaneously serving emotional vocals. [Prediction: Day 2]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I know this show is apparently really bad, but this bops at least.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i saw an ad for sword art online while watching adult swim once and thought it was the coolest idea for a show i’ve ever seen. man im glad i never actually got around to watching it and saved myself from a LOT of disappointment

**ImAWeebDuh** (7.5): even i know this one is a bad anime but sorry kinda slapped

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (5.5): sword art online fucked up anime bottom line cut and dry

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (5): everything i've heard about this program has implied that it just takes a massive donkey doo doo halfway through and this intro doesn't really confirm or deny that

**macnbee** (3): a man liking sword art online is a good litmus test for whether he thinks women have thoughts and feelings

**AmandaYoung2083** (0): I've been a SAO hater since day one and I'm not stopping now


# Both of those things
**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The power of LiSA is strong enough to overcome anything, even the power of bad anime

**prettybirbkotori** (8): this is going to lose points bc sao is very bad but i love lisa i can never do her dirty

**cheatviathan** (7): LiSA’s vocals do a lot elevate an otherwise standard j-rock track from an otherwise mediocre show.

________

**evanbrooks324** (11): this always be THE anime opening for me like say what you want about the show but the song will is iconic

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic and a BANGER and I wont let anyone say otherwise just cause they dont like the show

**apatel27** (10): Hate on the anime all you want this OP was the moment

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): rawk

**PSSST12** (10): Another 11 wew. This song takes me in another life time and makes me sad and longing for my past years 😢😢

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i genuinely believe if not for this opening this show would've flopped

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Omg, I am online too!! I do not have a sword though. But my brother does. I trust this ginger swordmaster with my life.

**mongeese0** (9.5): oooh those opening notes. The "chorus" sounding part is 10/10, Wish it didn't have the little denouement part after

**phonethephoenix** (9.4): oh i forgot this was actually a good song

**CrystaltheCool** (9): this anime has no right to have an OP this GOATed

**saviorARMY101** (9): A very epic sounding and banging ass theme

**Awkward\_King** (8): is sword art online the big titty anime

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I feel like the female vocalists are delivering better

**TiltControls** (8): I can't believe this is the one anime I've actually seen on my list lmao. The opening is great though

**vayyiqra** (8): was this show that popular? never seen it don't know this theme it's cool

**bogo** (7.5): i have no idea what this anime is about and i think that's for the best

**wujinan** (7.5): like the song but not the show

**milkywayinradius** (7): decent song but i blame them for all the isekais

**Nagisoid** (6): Anime died here

**vexastrae** (6): [SAO opened on november 6 2022](https://twitter.com/SAO_IRL/status/1589105296328335362) so if you plugged in to the metaverse and midnights was the last album you listened to i am so sorry for your loss

**alexismateofan** (5): Just a completely average opening song like okay we get it.

**hacatu** (4.5): Though it is generic and unexceptional, it managed to cement itself below 5 by including english lyrics

**nyoom** (4): a weird thing about anime is that generally the more girls there are per boy the less feminist it is actually

**Poydoo** (4): death note

**shhhneak** (3.3): This is so Minecraft coded like are y’all really still watching this?

**pig-serpent** (3): I think this is the 5th time this OP has appeared in this rate.

**maybecrf** (2): imagine how tired we are, imagine how tired we are

**Qwilphish** (2): shes just like every other bitch

**bigbigbee** (10): I LEFT EVERYTHING I OWN...IN ONE. PIECE.

---

1998tweety (10): iconic

allodude (10): when people ask for more hip-hop in anime, I point to this song

AmandaYoung2083 (10): ICONIC dub they were not fucking around

bigbigbee (10): I LEFT EVERYTHING I OWN...IN ONE. PIECE.

bogo (10): this slays

dreamingpastel (10): This has simply never been cringe for me.

imasalesman (10): the “in the Grand Line” part at the end hits so hard

maybecrf (10): THE SETO KAIBA VOICEOVER??? HUH??? this was dense

nt96 (10): we need to bring back rap sections describing what the characters are doing

pig-serpent (10): I forgot Seto Kaiba did the narration for this.

Poydoo (10): he said one piece

seanderlust (10): okay literally bars

Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc (10): this rap ended racism. i remember seeing ads for this with the theme on the saturday morning cartoon 4kids block. i cant believe this shit isnt over.

Zypker125 (10): When people ask me what the peak of hip-hop was, I say it was this song and the DK rap

korobizaka (9.8): yo ho ho he took a bite of gum gum

BleepBloopMusicFan (9): Omfg I forgot that Brock narrated this. Anyway this is stupid and slaps.

Senn\_Kyu (9): I have no nostalgic ties to these OPs I just love fun

DaswefSayLazy (8.5): this song slaps wtf

saviorARMY101 (8.5): It’s so cheesy but man does it slap at the same time lol

cheatviathan (8): When I went to an anime convention this year, I waited for a panel to start. The panel was a high demand one, so it was in a ballroom at full capacity. I’d say about 200 people were in that room. They played this theme while we were waiting, and the crowd responded with cheers and boos in equal measure. Because of that, I’m assuming this will have the highest controversy score.

IIIHenryIII (8): I love pirates of the caribbean

impla77 (8): Me when I describe what kind of swimwear I prefer:

Nagisoid (8): Everglow why are you on the floor

Verboten\_Prince (8): DON'T GIVE IT UP ZOLO

ricki (7): okayyyy

welcome2thejam (7): Going absolutely insane over this dude needing to burn a line to clarify that One Piece is the name of the treasure

shhhneak (6.6): The Brock/Kaiba VA on everything like a Phoebe Bridgers feature.

indie\_fan\_ (6): why i feel like this is eerily similar to the fresh prince of bel air opening with the rap part. Which also is probably the best part of the song

hacatu (5.5): Wow the English version is actually better, that's astonishing

distressedbeatboxing (5): This is not as unlistenable as I thought when I was a kid.

LesApfels (5): it's......camp?

Lynflower680 (4.5): Anyways stream

NervousLemon6670 (4): YI YO YI YO!

phonethephoenix (4): oh so that's why it's called one piece

Qwilphish (4): YA YO YA YO YA Yo

sarcasticsobs (3): Christ on a cracker

dooper8 (2.5): [The reason why I never got into One Piece, oooop]

Dragusken (2): …just no

RandomHypnotica (2): imagine having to hear this for 900 episodes

TakeOnMeByA-ha (2): i am NOT fucking watching one piece

alexismateofan (1): I need a volume lower than mute. Like I need to remove my ears.

DraculaWeekend (1): I would prefer never to hear this again

milkywayinradius (1): my god...

vayyiqra (1): didn't we already rate this theme i don't understand one piece - oh this a rap version ... and a very bad one

**bigbigbee** (10): See, this song is why we had to tell people to rate on the song not the anime because this anime is, respectably, what the fuck 

 I love this song, and I have for a long time! I was nervous that the show's reputation would precede it, but it seems that a fair number of you fell for the soft, sweet strings just like I did. This one was flipping over the border of Day 2 and 3 basically all rate - it just got unlucky that we closed the rate at a time it was a little lower, I guess.

---

**Senn\_Kyu** (11): it's perfect

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That “yeah” is really putting in a lot of work here.

**horridhendy** (10): When I watched this anime, I would genuinely put on the next episode just to hear the OP again. It’s so catchy and fluffy. Iconic.

**JIRACHI** (10): this is so cute i wish i'm in love with someone right now

**Nagisoid** (10): I prefer the N.H.K OP but both are beautiful queens. When this wins and it manifests a shibuya-kei rate and we all yass in unison

**nt96** (10): https://rave.dj/PFVZwPcKvZDHxg

**RandomHypnotica** (10): clamp kinda dropped the ball with this animation, the song is fire tho

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): pop music is back!

**welcome2thejam** (10): So catchy. Has an infectious joy to it, hard not to smile

**dooper8** (9.8): [Never watched this anime, but this played in Porter Robinson's Secret Sky DJ set in 2020 and I've been in love since then.]

**beeozan** (9.5): It’s Round Table ft. Nino baby they don’t miss. The song kinda lasts too long for its own good so I'll be deducting a half point off (can't be hypocritical and rate the tv cut only for this song :p) but also uu uu yea uu uu yea uu uu let mii bii with youu

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): so nice! love the vibe

**1998tweety** (9): the early 2000s serve

**Around-town** (9): I think this song was somehow nostalgic the very first time I listened to it. I certainly have no way to objectively rate it now that it's actually nostalgic.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): I never liked Chobits’ vibes when I was a teen, the plot didn’t seem my thing. Also was never crazy on the CLAMP art style. Anyway song is cute I like that at least!

**KuhBus** (9): soft, bouncy, sweet

**mongeese0** (9): Fun song - almost feels like it fades into the background at times, but the ooh-oohs are kinda mesermizing

**nyoom** (9): please don't be good please don't be... fuck

**popularsong** (9): also so cute... im gonna add this to my playlists lmao

**Poydoo** (9): eh uh eh uh yeah

**Qwilphish** (9): That hook is so catchy -- i can't think of anything else, it'll be stuck in my head for the next 10 years

**impla77** (8.8): This looks tooth rottingly cute

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): oooh ooh oooh ooh

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): it's just an anime op yall did not have to go this hard on the production

**TiltControls** (8.5): this opening visual is so low key compared to the previous ones that throw 14000 things on screen at once

**allodude** (8): certified hood classic

**BebeLuigi** (8): that anime is creepy to me but the opening does slap

**cheatviathan** (8): The rhythm guitars are understated yet engaging. The strings fill out the mix nicely. The vocals are serene and cutesy, but not to a fault. But it’s ultimately that bassline that keeps me coming back to this one.

**CrystaltheCool** (8): I love the vibes. The voice is kinda relaxed but the drums and bass are doin' overtime.

**DutchPeasant** (8): There is no way you can exclude Nino feat Round Table in a top OP list. Not only a very sweet voice but always an earworm no matter what she sung. Simple, but if it works there is no harm.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): cuuuuuuuuuuuuute

**macnbee** (8): we need a hard drive reveal for the creator of this show. song slaps though.

**maybecrf** (8): very cute, but we need some progression here folks, give me something

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): That "Oo-ooh, oo-ooh YEAH" hook is gonna be stuck in my head for the next few days now.

**saviorARMY101** (8): why is this song making me weirdly nostalgic

**vayyiqra** (8): i was interested in watching this about 12 years ago and never did anyway cute little ditty i like the strings

**wujinan** (8): completely slept on

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Easy breasy groove

**vexastrae** (7.5): im a sucker for cute easy-listening OPs

**dreamingpastel** (7): Infectious!

**Lynflower680** (7): The little “ooh ooh, ooh ooh” scratches the right part of my brain.

**ricki** (7): this would have been killer for an romcom in the mid 2000s

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (7): an anime i only know of because i used to play this club penguin-esq game called choBOTS but whenever u would search it this stupid anime would come up because the game was a flop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this just repeats the same notes for four minutes straight

**shhhneak** (6.3): Never heard of this in my life. Is it about a robot catgirl falling in love with the most generic looking man ever designed?

**alexismateofan** (6): Someone is singing over the telephone hold music again

**ImAWeebDuh** (6): the “yeah”s sound like good sample potential

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Very cute but also little substance

**apatel27** (5): Nothing stands out

**bogo** (5): it's kinda nothing

**pig-serpent** (3): Ooh ooh, ohoh, ooh ooh, ohoh

TWO I'll be honest I've heard this show gets really good towards the end but the opening episode where the MC had to turn on the robot by reaching insider her vagina made me want nothing to do with this show.

**Dragusken** (2): yeah, let me give a two

**MrSwearword** (1): they couldn't carry a note in a bucket

**Zypker125** (1): This is one of the only anime on the list that I wasn’t familiar with prior to the rate, and while I’m still mad confused as to why this made it onto the songlist, I do think it’s fun to have those “outlier/WTF picks”, so I’ve accepted it. I definitely think this is probably the least popular anime on the list, being an anime from 2002 that had pretty middling/mixed reception. Plastic Memories is probably the more popular version of this anime (sorry not sorry to classic anime fans). As for the song itself, there’s an obvious catchy hook, but the monotony of the opening makes it feel unpleasant to listen to. It just feels soulless and plastic to listen to, it’s like if you were to mash Baby Shark and Nyan Cat into a song and then remove all the meme potential from it. [Prediction: Day 2]

**bigbigbee** (6): I've been a bit out of the anime loop for the past 3-4 years or so I had no idea that this opening was a popular one! To that end, it was solidly day 3 for the vast majority of the rate, but over a few ballots it dropped down to Day 2 and couldn't recover by the end of the rate. (I would be interested in seeing if there was a difference between the more anime-fan leaning ballots and the more popheads leaning ballots on this one).

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this rules

**horridhendy** (10): It’s a bop. Tbh, you could have picked any of the Kaguya-sama OPs and they’d have got a 10 from me

**phonethephoenix** (10): classic vocals and solid instrumentation! nice

**Poydoo** (10): death note

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Mmm daddy daddy if you want it drop the addy

**PSSST12** (10): Oohh Y'all set kaguya up, Becauss If Love dramatic was here instead of this, you know the girls won't even stand a chance 😭😭

**Qwilphish** (10): a song that is great by itself but is even better in the context of the show. i can't sing the praises enough

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): my hellopro suzuki airi loving heart would have wanted to give this a 10 regardless but good thing this is a 10 song anyway

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It's obviously amazing, but sorry I am an OP1 stan til the day I die!!

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is what they call a munch

**TiltControls** (9.5): when you want daddy to do but instead he says no

**1998tweety** (9): ate

**alexismateofan** (9): This era of OPs like fully goes hard in terms of song choice, there’s no denying this is a banger.

**allodude** (9): liked it more than I thought I would

**Dragusken** (9): daddy daddy don't lie, you know this is a bop

**maybecrf** (9): strictly good vibes here

**popularsong** (9): ngl first time i heard it i didnt feel like their voices meshed together well but im really into it now. masakazu suzuki is so charming also lol though i mostly only checked out the song bc i love airi

**saviorARMY101** (9): a bop, and the singer’s voice is so pleasant to listen to

**Zypker125** (8.9): *The* quintessential rom-com anime of all time is here! This anime is *the* go-to recommendation for fans in search of rom-com goodness. It parodies the rom-com genre in an extremely fun way, turning the “high school confession” trope into an intense game-of-war by having the two main characters turn to a sharp battle of wits in an effort to get the other main character to confess to them first, with each of them going through ridiculous lengths and enacting crazy plans to get the other main character to confess. This opening from S2 is somewhat unconventional for a rom-com, being very jazzy and funky, reminiscing more of 1980s European pop than J-Pop ~~(I learned some of that from Google)~~. I am a sucker for multiple vocalists, especially when there’s a co-ed mix, and the harmonies between the female and male vocalist are *chef’s kiss*. [Prediction: Top 5]

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): I trust this red-haired archer with my life. I would like one of her bentos!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This food kinda looks better than the food in the cooking anime earlier.

**dooper8** (8.5): [Love is Show has now become the strongest Kaguya-sama opening, tho)

**mongeese0** (8.5): Liked how soulful it was, felt unique. Surprised the theme song wasn't more upbeat, knowing how popular this anime was

**cheatviathan** (8): A smooth and suave sounding opening that’s a perfect fit for one of the most hilarious rom coms out there. The two vocalists harmonize perfectly, and those horns are great.

**Lynflower680** (8): Is it bad that I knew this song first through vtubers?

**welcome2thejam** (8): My heart says yes but my Daddy! Daddy! Do! (Uh!)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): i do not like the connotations of anything in this

**apatel27** (7): There are no daddies in Kaguya. This is false advertising

**bogo** (7): hosts please for the love of god do not make daddy says no the interlude for this song in the reveal

**evanbrooks324** (7): was never a big fan of this series openings great show tho

**macnbee** (7): thank you daddy

**Nagisoid** (7): It has Daddy! in the title twice so it's basically Daddy AF

**nyoom** (7): don't

**plastichaxan** (7): The name of this song kinda made me do such an unhinged comment like

**prettybirbkotori** (7): the first opening would be the easiest 10 of my life but i've never been that into this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the haschak sisters’ dad on opposites day:

**vayyiqra** (7): never heard of this show! cool themes

**vexastrae** (7): its cute

**DaswefSayLazy** (6.5): i love the manga and the show was also really good but i dont like the opening that much

**seanderlust** (6.5): okay lana del rey calm down

**wujinan** (6.5): cool

**cremeebrulee** (6): ended slayyyter but not the haschak sisters

**IIIHenryIII** (6): are we sure this is not a soap opera?

**pig-serpent** (6): Ok, this is a nice mix of classic but still maintains a curious energy about it.

**Awkward\_King** (5): daddy says do

**hacatu** (5): I know this is really popular but it just doesn't work for me at all

**ImAWeebDuh** (5): soudns fine but that title does not give me hope

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (5): excuse me what now

**beeozan** (4.5): Daddy! Says! No! (to watching kaguya-sama. I have personal beef with aka akasaka) girl those back vocals serve so hard I wish u were the main singer

**AmandaYoung2083** (1): Wanted to turn this off 20 seconds in

**BebeLuigi** (0): god I hate everything about this anime and it includes this opening

**korobizaka** (0): I would skip this if I could, but.. sorry! not going to score the guy who was literally the leader of a blackface group.

**bigbigbee** (6): This anime is definitely a 10: one of the greatest shojo anime, incredibly influential, still well-loved to this day. That being said, I never watched it as a kid, and therefore I have no nostalgia for this song in particular, which is cute but nothing special to me. 

 This was climbing towards the end but wasn't able to make Day 3 in the end.

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): It’s catchy, fun, matches the visual style of the anime, and has a woman singing so no need to fight back any misandry instincts. It’s perfect!

**JIRACHI** (11): this song is very uwu princess peach energy and i love it. i just love cute girly puss songs and this is doing it to me.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I know we're supposed to be seperating these songs from their attatched anime's, and for the most part I think I have been doing that... but it's impossible to fully seperate this one for me. 

 When i was extremely young (like 3 years old) I started watching and falling in love with Cardcaptor Sakura after Cartoon Network started playing it, and it was the greatest thing i'd ever seen. The animation was so gorgeous, there was drama and stakes and action and I just loved it. I was obssessed with it for a couple of years, but as i got older it kinda went to the back of my mind and I hid my like of it away for fear of being too "girly'. When I was an older teenager, I realised it had been ages since I last saw it, so I decided to rewatch it and that's when I realised just how special the show was. At it's core, it's a show about love and all the different ways you can experience it. Romantic, parental, sibling, platonic, friendship, respect, the entire show really at it's core is about the strength of love, family and friends, and it's wrapped in a layer of fantastic animation, tons of love and attention to details, and a fantastic series of magical creatures and powers. And this opening theme song truly just represents the absolute bliss that the show is, it's radiant, it's shining, it's bright and sparkling and gorgeous and just hearing those opening notes fills me with life in a way not many if any other songs can.

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): song of the year, decade, millenium, eon

**amr** (10): a perfect show in spite of all of the weapons formed against it (incest, pedophilia, clamp themselves) sakura kinomoto is literally buffy summers for middle school girls

**BebeLuigi** (10): NICE TO MEET YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU KITTOOOOOOOOO

**beeozan** (10): Catch you Catch me more like Catchy you Catchy me because it’s the slay of the century! TV-size folks are missing out on the grooves in the bridge which, while not the stand out point of the song, is definitely a great addition. Not to mention the equally groovy B-side track. 90s shoujo openings were something else, we need the music industry to stop with the 80s revival and have Dua Lipa sing bops like these

**horridhendy** (10): So catchy

**Poydoo** (10): nice one yes

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This is dooooooooooope. Got such a fun little disco flavour to it. Also reminds me a bit of "Where Is The Feeling" by Kylie Minogue (but like the album version not the video version).

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): catchy as hell even decades later

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): omg she's just like me!

**milkywayinradius** (9): cute anime opening done well; doesn't have weird high pitched vocals

**Qwilphish** (9): Easy breezy. Feels like a classic in the best way

**shhhneak** (9): I can’t recall the story at all but I was always seated for the dub when I was a kid.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): anime was just better when every op looked and sounded like this

**alexismateofan** (8): love daytona usa

**bogo** (8): cute!

**nyoom** (8): i grew up listening to the korean version but this is nice too it's just not MY nostalgia

**ricki** (8): OH SHE WAS AN IT GIRL FOR ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG

**sarcasticsobs** (8): https://i.redd.it/ksw8dil3t7t01.jpg

**vayyiqra** (8): not what i expected but cute. a bit city pop too [citation needed]

**vexastrae** (8): love how peppy and cute this is

**phonethephoenix** (7.6): it's sweet!

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**hacatu** (7): Cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I love the instrumentals, but the vocals ain’t doing nothing to me

**KuhBus** (7): incredibly cutesy and catchy

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): How cute

**wujinan** (7): aged but still a vibe

**allodude** (6): expect the unexpected now

**apatel27** (6): Is this Citypop?

**cheatviathan** (6): I mean, the main hook is catchy. That little string run in the bridge is an odd touch that I quite like. This doesn’t really do too much for me besides that, tho.

**MrSwearword** (6): fits the show it's selling but those vocals are just...no

**Nagisoid** (6): Sappho felt threatened

**TiltControls** (6): ngl the weird spoken opening of the English adaptation was always a guilty pleasure of mine as a kid. This song has nothing in common with that one, but it's hard not to compare them

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): she wants to be madoka so bad...

**welcome2thejam** (6): Ahhh it's the little guy from the 2018 indie pop rate! Cute song to match too

**DaswefSayLazy** (5): its okay

**saviorARMY101** (5): cute

**mongeese0** (4): Wasn't really feeling it

**pig-serpent** (4): This is the kind of floaty OP that probably fits the show but I absolutely do not care to listen to.

**prettybirbkotori** (4): the vibes being fantastic cannot make me like this as a song

**maybecrf** (3): you delivered nothing, congrats

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): clouds

**Dragusken** (1): the beginning sounds like a game show, but otherwise kinda forgettable

**Zypker125** (1): Next up we have Cardcaptor Sakura, a magical girl classic from the 1990s. Unfortunately for the cultured classic fans, I am hugely prejudiced against older songs and it definitely shows here, because I don’t like this song at all. It’s too quiet and soft, and the chorus’s attempt to be catchy completely fails for me. It aggressively puts me to sleep by being so passive musically. [Prediction: Early Day 3]

**bigbigbee** (7): being a digimon trainer is fun but the season where they could turn into digimon? life changing. little bee wanted that so bad for herself. also man digimon are so ugly compared to pokeymons 

 This one was solidly Day 3 for most of the rate but started to slip in the final third of ballots and ultimately JUST missed Day 3.

---

# Outsold by DI-GI-MON. DIGITAL MONSTERS!

**Narhun** (9.5): This song is great and all, but do you know what would be even better? If the song just repeated "Dig-dig-dig-digimon" again and again (/s, although that version is iconic in its own way too)

**mongeese0** (8): Sure it's a good song, but did it cause as much discourse as "digimon are the champions"

**allodude** (5): they didn't say "Digimon Digital Monsters" once

**macnbee** (5): totally washed by DIGIMON, DIGITAL MONSTERS, DIGIMON ARE THE CHAMPIONS

**vayyiqra** (5): the digimon theme i remember from the show i saw in passing on tv as a kid was not good (it literally had the line "digimon, digital monsters") so this is better i guess. one time i was at an art opening and me and my friend were kind of drunk and got into a debate over whether the original run of the pokemon anime or digimon was better and that turned into a debate over if the world of pokemon is a cyberpunk dystopia or not. true story. i don't remember the outcome of that though

# And other international versions that slap with abandon!

**plastichaxan** (10): SI TU LO DESEAS PUEDES VOLAR!! (I thought this was the Dragon Ball opening lmfao but I knew it in Spanish)

**KuhBus** (9): ALMOST as good as the German version, which I highly recommend people listen to as it ramps up the energy even more

**agnes\_honey** (8): i never listened to the original version , only in portuguese

**welcome2thejam** (8): #NotMyDigimonIntro

---

**MrMushrooms** (11): Even though I grew up with the English opening, this one still somehow gives me such a sense of nostalgia and enjoyment!

**alexismateofan** (10): oh we’re discussing BANGERS today on the subreddit. Like SLAPS.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended loona

**Senn\_Kyu** (10): if Chobits wasn't on here this would definitely be my eleven point pick, but alas

**Wane\_I Support American Dubs bc I Support American Jobs\_Lietoc** (10): this is REAL 90s rock

**apatel27** (9): One day I will FC this on Starlight Stage

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this one sounds better than the one I’m used to

**phonethephoenix** (9): now that's what i call late 90s/early 2000s pop-rock (complimentary)

**Qwilphish** (9): this is the most biased 9 of my life, i love digimon

**TiltControls** (9): when are we rating the Digimon Movie soundtrack cause that was stellar

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): rest in peace king

**Bisonsouro** (8.5): Lots to say on the anime, little on the OP.

**hacatu** (8.5): This goes so unnecessarily hard for digimon lol

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**Dragusken** (8): wow wow wow

**ImAWeebDuh** (8): for me being told to hate digimon ever since i became chronically online, this kinda ate

**JIRACHI** (8): help i've just realised digimon is a real thing and not some pokemon knock offs

**MrSwearword** (8): finally, a competent understanding of rock music

**Poydoo** (8): death note

**prettybirbkotori** (8): digimon had no business having such an unbelievable banger as its opening

**impla77** (7.8): i always thought pokemon and digimon were in the same universe but i guess not???

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Oh I really like that cactus guy.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Remember that jester Digimon? Fuck that guy

**wujinan** (7.5): still a bop

**cheatviathan** (7): Solid enough rocker with some cool synth leads and an infectious hook. I have more nostalgia for the Saban dub’s opening, but this is every bit as good for different reasons.

**maybecrf** (7): they didnt do a lot, but they did it right

**saviorARMY101** (7): Never was into Digimon but song kinda bangs

**vexastrae** (6.5): this is so disney channel core

**CrystaltheCool** (6): it's a good song but I have no nostalgia for it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): kinda giving karaoke

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): you will never be smile.dk

**Uberpigeon-Sama** (6): aieeaiai im your little butterfly kinda wish i had this show when i was a kid bc i wanted to like digimon but all i had was digimon: the movie which was like 3 different short movies stitched together for a western release and it made absolutely NO sense and confused the fuck out of me

**Zypker125** (5.9): Everyone’s favorite non-ripoff of Pokemon is here! I assume most people have heard of Digimon before, even if they haven’t watched it, and I am one of those people, as it aired before my time. The song itself is pretty decent, having a nice-if-admittedly-basic rock instrumental, and the vocal mixing is pretty good. The chorus isn’t that memorable unfortunately, which brings the score down, but it’s overall pretty solid for its time. [Prediction: Day 1]

**nyoom** (5.5): go girl give us nothing

**Awkward\_King** (4): i have to be so honest i still dont think i know what digimon is

**Nagisoid** (4): I'm still grieving LOONA don't do this to me

**pig-serpent** (4): *pokes with stick* come on, do something
