##Men. Why?

Ah, men.

/r/popheads has had quite the history with the mystifying beasts. While some men have done their best to ruin this planet we live on and say it wasn’t their fault, some other men have recorded music. Music that helped define the 2010s, spawning singles that still get ample radio play to this day. These artists are some of the biggest artists of the decade, and look to continue that momentum into the next one. We bring you the 2010s Ultimate Male Rate, featuring Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, and Ed Sheeran. From the explosive comeback, to the solid sophomore album, to the EDM reinvention, to the most streamed album in the world (until he dethroned himself with his third album), there’s something here for everyone. Welcome to the 2010s Ultimate Male Rate, where we celebrate (or condemn) the men that defined music this decade.

##Justin Timberlake – _The 20/20 Experience_

Justin Timberlake’s _The 20/20 Experience_ is the first part of a double album, released on March 15, 2013. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with a staggering 968k copies in its first week, launching it into the spot as the best selling album of 2013. A neo soul/R&B album with sprawling, oftentimes lengthy tracks, the record spawned 3 singles: “Suit & Tie” ft. Jay-Z, “Mirrors”, and “Tunnel Vision”, the former two being massive hits with both peaking in the top 3 of the Billboard Hot 100. It received some critical acclaim, hailing at a noble 75 on metacritic and a fabled Best New Music label on Pitchfork; it is also ranked as the 200th best album on Rolling Stone’s 200 Best Albums Of All Time. _The 20/20 Experience_ is, well, an experience, and between its bold song lengths, huge commercial success, and massive singles, it’s one of the most iconic albums of the decade.

##Bruno Mars – _Unorthodox Jukebox_

Bruno Mars’ _Unorthodox Jukebox_ is the highly anticipated follow up to his debut smash, _Doo-Wops and Hooligans_, released on December 7, 2012. It debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 192k copies in its first week, and spawned two #1 singles, a top 5 single, and two more top 40 singles. The album incorporates elements of reggae, disco, doo-wop, and more, having some of his most interesting songs in his discography. With a 70 on Metacritic, some critics were mixed on the project, but many felt this was a very admirable sophomore project with some standout tracks that had some killer hooks. The album went on to become the fourth best-selling album of 2013, and was a considerable step forward for him in terms of production and experimentation. It may not be Bruno Mars’ most popular record, but it’s certainly his most interesting, with songs like “Locked Out of Heaven”, “Treasure”, and “Young Girls” being some of his most catchy and unique songs to date.

##Justin Bieber – _Purpose_

What do you get when the biggest male pop star in the world attempts to prove himself as a worthwhile, mature musician after years of bad attitude, immaturity, and scandals to fill books with? Well, you get _Purpose_. Released on November 13, 2015, Justin Bieber’s fourth studio album is an EDM self-revolution with production assistance from electronic production legends such as Skrillex, Diplo, benny blanco, Poo Bear, and more. It proved to be his most successful era of all, producing his first three #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 (all of which replaced each other on the chart) and debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 with an astonishing 522k copies in its first week. While the album was received mildly well critically, receiving a 63 on Metacritic, Justin still proved himself to be a more mature popstar through this album and launched his career even farther into stardom.

##Ed Sheeran – _x_

Hailing off of the success of his debut album _+_ (pronounced “plus”), Ed Sheeran was spending his time stuck in the studio whittling down the hundreds of songs he had written to just fifteen songs. The result of this was _x_ (pronounced “multiply”), the second studio album from the English singer-songwriter. Debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 210k copies sold, the album produced a myriad hits including a top 20 hit, two top 10 hits, and a top 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. While the album did mildly well critically, receiving a 67 on Metacritic, it took the general public by storm becoming one of the most-streamed albums on Spotify to this date, amassing nearly six billion streams. Like him or not, Ed Sheeran’s success is immense and can be heard around the world.

###Rules That Are Very Original And Not Copy/Pasted From Multiple Rate Threads

-	Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). Please. We beg of you.
-	We also kindly ask that you guys give nice, whole, round ratings. **The only scores we will accept will be whole numbers or point-fives (X.5).** For example, if you send us a score for a song of 7.3, we will not accept that - either give it a 7 or a 7.5. A 7.3 is a stupid, unassured rating and we hate it. Be confident in your scores! Be like us where this is the only part of our lives we are confident about.
-	You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11). These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to! Be trendy. Apathy is in nowadays.
-	Sorry to bring the terrible news to you, but you have to rate every single song in the main rate. If you skip any and do not give us a score when we ask you for one, your ballot will not be counted. This is because the program used to determine the results will break if scores are not successfully put in and /u/ThatParanoidPenguin, /u/letsallpoo, and I will cry from the unknown-ness of it all.
-	Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! It’s an artisanal link that would cost you guys $50 if we were capitalist.
  - Note: if you’re trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com as a result, and you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!
-	If you desire to change any of the scores after you’ve already submitted them, simply message us (/u/frogaranaman or /u/ThatParanoidPenguin) and we’ll be glad to help! Our lives are boring anyways.
-	If we believe your scores include any form of sabotage, we reserve the right to ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. Sabotage will be defined as extremely low album average(s) that show a clear bias against one (or more) artist(s) in the rate. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, we strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)
-	Your sc	res should not be considered confidential! Don’t be scared to share them. Go nuts. Campaign for whatever song you gave an 11 to. Or don’t. Shit is lit and we should probably put the fire out because it smells.

It is also highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, like this:

>	Thinkin	 Out Loud: 0 I hate straight people.

Any format other than this is NOT good and you’ll deeply hurt us if you don’t follow the example given here. This includes:

>	One: 1:	Haha, matching the score with the number in the song title. Creativity.

>	Don’t: you think men suck? Me too! 1

>	I’m A Mess: Bebe Rhexa stole this 10 of a song and made it an 8.

>	Sing: 1	-This is what I like to sing at karaoke nights.

>	Even My Dad Does Sometimes: (7) This song is gay coded.

Please note: we do not hate or stan Ed Sheeran, as indicated by this section. We here over on the Men™ rate team simply like to meme.

You can also add comments to albums! In order to do this, simply put a colon (:) after the album title. Like so:

>	Album: x: Ed Sheeran is the ginger devil and we know that for sure because he likes math.
