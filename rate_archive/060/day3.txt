Welcome to day 3 of the mens rate reveal! Hope your favs got their jockstrap ready, because they’re about to be fucked by the results. The facts again:

- There were [46 participants](https://pastebin.com/jp4mb0k2) in this rate. I!
- The average score on a song was **7.1120**. Hate!
- The average controversy score was **2.0763**. Men!

Also, to blatantly rip off the 2017 depression rate, here are fun facts about the hosts:

- /u/frogaranaman has gotten sick at Valentines Day for two years in a row, and
- /u/ThatParanoidPenguin had a waffle with sprinkles today because they were out of chocolate chips and would like to speak to the manager.

Today is #3 - #1 for the bonus rate, and #15 - #1 for the main rate. We will also be revealing this rate on the plug.dj at 2PM EST. [**Join it here!**](http://plug.dj/popheads)

**penguin** (7): Pretty solid album track. I like the little vocal effects a lot, and the chorus isn’t that distinguishable compared to some of the other songs here, but it’s catchy. 
 
**frog** (8):

CUT TO SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND. I DON’T KNOW WHERE ED LIVES OR RECORDS HIS SHIT, THIS IS JUST A MEME. LET ME LIVE. [PENGUIN] IS ANNOYED WITH [FROG].

PENGUIN: (ANNOYED) How the fuck are we supposed to get in?

FROG: Don’t worry, I have a plan.

[FROG] DIGS INTO HIS POCKET AND PULLS OUT TWO FAKE IDS. [PENGUIN] DOESN’T QUESTION IT AND JUST GOES WITH THE FLOW BECAUSE WHAT ELSE IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO? HE JUST GOT FIRED. MIGHT AS WELL DO THIS.


THEY APPROACH [ED SHEERAN]S STUDIO, BUT SOON GETS STOPPED BY A [SECURITY GUARD].

SECURITY GUARD: (STERNLY, COMPLETELY DONE WITH THEIR JOB) IDs, please.

[FROG] AND [PENGUIN] HAND OVER THEIR IDS. THE [SECURITY GUARD] LOOKS AT IT, THEN AT THEM, THEN BACK AT THE IDS, THEN SIGHS.

SECURITY GUARD: Man, I dunno if y’all actually are the Chainsmokers..

[FROG] AND [PENGUIN] BEGIN TO SWEAT.

SECURITY GUARD: ..but fuck, man, all white people look the same to me.

PENGUIN: (CONFUSED) Wait, why are you working in Europe?

SECURITY GUARD: (DONE WITH THIS SHIT) Just head on in, y’all.

[FROG] AND [PENGUIN] RUSH IN, THEN BEGIN THEIR SEARCH FOR [ED SHEERAN].

#Has ran away before

**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): super catchy, good story
 
**kappyko** (9): OHHH I HAVE HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE!!!! Bop
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): I don't know why but I keep hearing Ed use male pronouns which makes me think this song is gay, but he's very obviously not talking about a love interest since this is about his dad. I'm really tired and should honestly delete this comment at this point.
 
**CarlieScion** (8): good song
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): A little less substantial than the other big bops on the album, but it’s still great.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): also a banger.

#Kanye did it better
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): i’m a sucker for funky basslines but the melody is fairly lazy oh well it’s cute
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): a mild bop, the guitars could be improved tho imo
 
**twat\_brained** (7): Never listened to this because I didn't appreciate the intro nor was it a single or on his tour setlist. I like the bassline, for what it's worth. There's not much replay value here, though.
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): This is not Kanye West

frogaranaman: Y’all hate anything above three minutes in length, huh?

Also, we didn’t catch a .7 so that’s why this song beat "Runaway". We tried being snobby, we really did.

**penguin** (8): A bit repetitive but definitely a bop, those horns are everything. Justin kinda gets lost in them, but I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing, as he he blends in with the instrumental quite well. 
 
**frog** (6):

AFTER GOING OVER TO [POO]S LOCATION, [FROG] GETS GRABBED BY THE FACE AND PULLED CLOSE TO [POO]S, WHILE HE SAYS:

POO: (INTENSELY) Listen here, you are _not_ going to tell anyone that my store is just a front, okay? Not even your dumbass friend, penguin.

FROG: (VERY CONFUSED) A front for what?

POO: (CURSING) Shit, I gave away too much info.

[FROG] CONTINUES TO BE CONFUSED AT THIS. [POO] SHOVES HIM TO THE GROUND AND BEGINS RUMMAGING AROUND FOR.. SOMETHING. AS HE IS DOING THIS, [PENGUIN] ROUNDS THE CORNER WEARING A FANCY NEW SUIT.

PENGUIN: (PROUDLY) So, what do you guys think of the this? I think it fits wel-

REALIZING THAT HIS FRIEND IS SHOVED ON THE GROUND AND THAT HIS NEW BOSS IS RUMMAGING AROUND FOR SOMETHING, [PENGUIN] HAS THE THOUGHT: _Aww, shit. My new boss is a sugar daddy._

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Justin can get more than just his groove in me 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏

#Groove: In

**J\_Toe** (10): Interesting to hear both Latin sounds and those of Burkina Faso!
 
**kappyko** (10): I'm very glad that a song with the word "Groove" in the title delivers on its premise. The horns at some point reminded me of a Go! Team track. I love it!
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): bop
 
**radiofan15** (10): One of the most maligned immaculate bops i've ever heard, this is pure festive pop perfection
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): pretty repetitive but also a big groove (haha). this also has one of the best outros on the album
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): Somewhat simple, and (as is standard with songs on this album) a little to long. However, its simplicity works in its favor, as this is a good, infectious groovy song.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): groovy banger.
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): A bit of a bop but this is a song where the length does more damage than good.
 
**twat\_brained** (8.5): Justin's getting into the groove, and he's definitely proving his love to me. Impressive.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): it’s definitely groovy

#Groove: Out
 
**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I can hear his autotune in parts where it’s not supposed to be an effect.
 
**selegend** (5): this belongs in 2006
 
#lol oops

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): ok please don’t do this song dirty i know it’s repetitive but it’s supposed to be experimental

**penguin** (8): This is the most metal title for an Ed Sheeran song honestly. That buildup is pretty nice though. 
 
**frog** (5):

AFTER SOME SEARCHING AROUND THE PERIMETERS, [FROG] YELLS AT [PENGUIN].

FROG: Over here! I think I found him.

[PENGUIN] RUSHES OVER AND SEES [ED SHEERAN] SITTING IN A STUDIO.

PENGUIN: Yes, that’s definitely him.

FROG: You sure? He looks uglier than I expected.

[PENGUIN] PUNCHES [FROG] AND BEGINS TO WALK INTO THE STUDIO. ONCE [ED] TURNS AROUND AND SEES THEM, [PENGUIN] INTRODUCES THEMSELVES:

PENGUIN: Hey Ed, it’s us, the Chainsmokers.

#Loves MDMA

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): love the intensity here, this sound suits him and his singing register much better
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): man, this song is so heartbreaking, and so powerful. definitely feels like addiction is something Ed may be in the edge of, and he's scared that it will take over.
 
**OriginalKappa** (9): idk what it is but something about this really works for me. the rudimental version is also great in a different kind of way
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): This almost feels like it could've been a country song if the production was changed a little bit.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): rudimental remix > but i really like the vibes on this one
 
**radiofan15** (8): If this was the Rudimental version it would be a 10... as it is it's still good

#Supports the War Against Drugs
 
**kappyko** (6.5): Almost reaches the height it wants to reach, yet doesn't. Disappointing for a song that builds this tension for such a lack of resolution. Oh wait, is that the point
 
**Raykel** (6.5): The chorus was starting to get a bit annoying
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): yeah the way ed sings this pisses me off like it doesn’t make the song more dramatic if you sing it shitty ed

#im

**twat\_brained** (10): Does "this is how it ends" foreshadow Ed's death? Is he gonna Amy himself at some point? EDIT: okay it's fine it's about him rolling on MDMA at someone's wedding. Who does MDMA at a wedding? I'm glad Ed did, because a great song came from it. Also, just re-listening to the Rudimental rework, I never noticed Ed had new vocals to go with it. Anyway, this song fucks hard and I fuck with it.

**penguin** (6): This closer is just okay. It’s not a strong way to finish the album, and it just doesn’t carry much weight after the heavy Thinking Out Loud. It’s fine, but definitely not fine enough to carry the end of a record. 
 
**frog** (5):

ED SHEERAN: No it isn’t.

[FROG, PENGUIN] ARE NOW BOTH SWEATING.

ED SHEERAN: Although it is impressive that you guys actually got in using that trick.

FROG: They do look like a duo of white frat dudes, yeah.

ED SHEERAN: Exactly, I would have been fooled too.

(QUESTIONING) Anyways, why are you two here?

FROG: Long story short, I need you to collab with Zara Larsson or else I die.

ED SHEERAN: ..you what.

#Love on fire

**ExtraEater** (9.5): surprise standout non-single
 
**1998tweety** (9): A great closer to the album.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): I was enjoying it until I realized what it was about. Then I got really sad (but it’s still good). Fuck Alzheimer’s.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): beautiful closer.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): love the mood this captures...the chanting and clapping really brings everything together

#Where’s the fire extinguisher
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): Of all of the Ginger songs... this is one of them
 
**CarlieScion** (6): kinda weird closing track
 
**kappyko** (6): The production reminds me of Super Smash Flash for some reason
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): fuck you ed this track pisses me off so much you shallow twit

#\*listens to men’s music once\* \*instantly needs to validate the fact that they also listen to women’s music too\*

**twat\_brained** (7): lol so when I'd hear the violins in the intro, I'd always think this was Ultraviolence by Lana Del Rey. Also hearing it now it just feels like such a comedown from the whole album; which is a shame because I would rather Shirtsleeves have been on the standard edition compared to this

**penguin** (10): This just feels like a classic JT song. The synths are literal heaven, cascading over Timbaland’s signature percussion, and Justin gives perhaps his most energetic performance on the album. There’s just something so blissful about the distant ambient synths backing Justin’s wistful delivery. The dream team really killed this one. 
 
**frog** (9):

_Fuck, they think I’m a sugar daddy,_ [POO] REALIZES. QUICKLY FISHING OUT EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDED FROM THE DRAWER, HE WALKS OVER TO [PENGUIN], MENACINGLY.

PENGUIN: (SEES POO WALKING OVER) Oh, sick. Do you have something about the suit you want to adjust?

POO: (EVIL-LIKE) Yeah, it needs some blood on it.

TAKING THE PIPE THAT [POO] FISHED OUT OF THE DRAWER, HE HITS [PENGUIN] ON THE HEAD WITH IT AND KNOCKS HIM OUT. [FROG] IS SHOCKED AND WONDERING WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING, BUT [POO] TAKES NO TIME AND BEGINS TO RUN OVER TO HIM.

FROG: (SCRAMBLING FOR SELF DEFENCE) Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

POO: It has to be done, I’m sorry.

#Can’t see, needs glasses

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is that bitch. Timbaland’s production is really great on this and it’s just a catchy and fun song.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): peak JT. this song is so fucking great and so is the video that goes along with it.
 
**radiofan15** (9): A BOP AND A HALF THAT DESERVED BETTER
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): this is so dark and dramatic and it fucks me up
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Oh wow another bop, I like this, it's long like all the other songs but doesn't feel dull.
 
**kappyko** (8.5): Net positive results from Mr. Timberlake, rich in production as always. The hook is catchier than other songs on the album so far, so no wonder it was released a single. The beatboxing is BATSHIT insane, and there's some genuine progression on this track that's seductively good. However, this potentially has the WORST single art of all time.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): this sound is what makes JT good
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): don’t get me wrong i adore this track but it was the wrong choice for a single. it’s too experimental in its own amazing way. i do love the long interludes but this one drags on a bit but there’s a beautiful taste of innovation in here with the tight contrasting and unexpected melodies. 20/20 is on its own level
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.5): Zoom, zoom, zoom
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): I remember when the controversey about the music video happened just because the girls were topless, wow that would barely be a headline nowadays

#Has 20/20 vision, fucking hates glasses
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): This is overlong (there were no less than three times where I thought it could have ended well) and overproduced, but it also bops.
 
**twat\_brained** (6): It's serviceable but little more than that I'm afraid. I really hope Man of the Woods didn't have super goddamn long songs like here.

**penguin** (8): The classic ballad on the album, this song has actually aged quite well (understandably so). It’s a simple track, but sometimes that works best, and as songs like It Will Rain show, sometimes simple piano backdrops for Bruno Mars are enough. 
 
**frog** (3):

AS [BRUNO] CONTINUES HIS MENTAL BREAKDOWN FROM TRYING TO APPEAL TO WHITE PEOPLE, [FROG] TRIES TO CALM HIM DOWN.

FROG: It can’t be that bad! I mean, you’d make history books. How cool is that?

OUT OF RAGE, [BRUNO] GRABS [FROG] AND SHOVES HIM OUT OF HIS BEDROOM ONTO THE VERANDA LOOKING OVER THE APARTMENT POOL COMPLEX. THIS CAUSES [FROG] TO TRIP OVER THE RAILING AND FALL OFF TOWARDS THE POOL.

AS HE HITS THE POOL WATER, [FROG] THINKS TO HIMSELF: _Man, I really should have gone for paid internships. This shit blows._ HE KEEPS ON SINKING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, WONDERING WHEN HE’LL HIT THE BOTTOM, BUT LITTLE DID HE KNOW...

#Needs a Valentines date

**1998tweety** (10): An amazing love song, honestly while LOOH and 24KM bop, I love Bruno's ballads. He puts so much emotion into them. That and his vocals are amazing.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): king of acknowledging his own faults! and not pressuring you to take him back!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): honestly one of my favorite ballads of all time probably bc it's almost a little too relatable haha i'm fine.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): good for a ballad but a weird place to put it on an album and extremely cheese

#Adele

**twat\_brained** (10): If there's a male equivalent to "Someone Like You", this has to be it. I've heard it at least 20 or 30 times on the radio over the years, but it feels like I'm hearing it all over again for this rate. Bruno's emotion is just so raw, and he genuinely sounds heartbroken. THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is how you do piano ballads.

**penguin** (6): This is one of those Ed Sheeran songs that I just don’t get. There’s an obviously distinct chorus, but it never really felt that potent to me. It’s an attempt to capture some of that indie catharsis - artists like Family of the Year/The Head and The Heart, but this song falls a bit flat. 
 
**frog** (8):

FROG: I’m dead serious.

[ED], NOW CONFUSED, PULLS OUT HIS PHONE. HE LOOKS THROUGH HIS CONTACTS THEN SIGHS.

#Is hurt

**1998tweety** (11): This probably seems like an odd choice for an 11 especially with Thinking Out Loud on the same album, but I always connected with this song a bit more. It was actually a bigger hit in Canada than in the UK so I heard it so much on the radio. It's really cute, although it always sounded like more of a father-daughter song where the father is away fighting a war or something, than about two lovers to me.
 
**unovachamp** (11): Whenever I temporarily think badly of Ed Sheeran's songwriting thanks to too many bad-good pop hooks, I come back to this song. The imagery is vivid and sweet, the lyrics and little phrases are so whimsical and charming, and the build up to the final chorus is amazing.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song always tugs at my heartstrings. It’s really sweet.
 
**kappyko** (10): Something is really striking about the emotions of this song at the current moment I'm living rn. Speaks a lot more right now than it has before.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): gorgeous, beautiful, earth-shattering, tear-inducing, life-changing. maybe his best song.
 
**twat\_brained** (9.5): It's evident Ed tried to recapture the fire he'd created with this song when he wrote Perfect. I prefer this, because it feels sweet but not overly sappy and saccharine, like his second #1 hit. Also, the only reason it's not a 10 from me is because it's a total undercut of the last song on the record! "Wait for me to come home". Nina waited, but you flat out told her you're never going home! I wish Ed's writing was more consistent. Also bonus points for the video which included footage of him picking up music as a kid.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I remember this being played on the radio, and I kind of always liked it.
 
**CarlieScion** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns

#Wants to hurt Ed
 
**OriginalKappa** (7): would be better if the chorus wasn't just a pitched-up version of another person's song

**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): this is quite dull and ed's falsetto :yikes: also the volume increase is a cheap excuse for an actual climax

**penguin** (10): I’m trying to stay formal in the pursuit of respect as a cohost, but I cannot refrain from saying what I am about to say: this song is a bop. It’s a delicate tropical pop track, and in even moments where the synths are absent, the beating percussion created the perfect atmosphere for 2015-era over-filtered Instagram ambience. This is mall music at its final form, and Justin Bieber is the perfect mood to shape a tropical house-borrowing hit. 
 
**frog** (8):

POO: That’s it, I’m done.

#Knows what they mean

**selegend** (11): pop perfection
 
**1998tweety** (10): Massive chill bop, I can't believe some of you called this song problematic lmao. He's literally asking to be sure what the girl wants, some of y'all... :snowflake:
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): throwback to Lena D
 
**kappyko** (10): The only song on this rate I feel genuine attachment too. Tropical house pop takes me back to the middle school summers when responsibility was distant enough to throw away and when I had freedom that felt real. "What Do You Mean?" is a sweet pop song and that's all. I can't explain why I like this, or "Cheerleader" as remixed by Felix Jaehn, but I know how much I can tell you about loving the times spent in a hot car and going to eat mediocre BBQ during summer 2015...
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): my favorite from this cycle. This is such a bop.
 
**CarlieScion** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T-rJGwnwU4
 
**OriginalKappa** (9): Humanity doesn't deserve production this good
 
**radiofan15** (9): Annoying bop but bop nothenless
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): iconic consent anthem.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): i was in deep denial about how much i liked this song for a long time, but i can appreciate it heavily nowadays. the clock noises really tie everything together and "be more straightforward!" is an underrated adlib

#Does not know what they mean
 
**ExtraEater** (7.5): good instrumentals but it's just kinda.. empty
 
**twat\_brained** (7.5): this has definitely aged. it's not aged to its fullest potential, I'll admit. I do still admire it, if for no other reason than the fact it gave Justin his first #1 single, which was a #1 debut, no less! Of course, this was at a time when it wasn't as commonplace. And it made me feel proud to be a Belieber for the first time in awhile. Unfortunately for Justin I'm no longer in his court, but if he can get back on the right track I might consider coming back around to him.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): where's the progression though
 
**JunkyGS** (1): Hate the production, hate his vocals that sound like he is half awake and is about a girl not knowing what she wants in a relationship. Yawn. It sounds like from the previous 2 songs you don't even know who you are as a person, let alone criticizing somebody else.

**penguin** (6): This’ll probably be my most controversial score in the rate but I’ve never really liked Suit & Tie ever since I watched the Grammy performance of it, and that’s mostly because of Jay-Z.  I’m a big Jay-Z fan but his verse seems pretty out of place here, and it’s always pretty forgettable for me. The rest of the song after his part isn’t as potent as Justin’s slick delivery in the front half, and I just don’t find either JT Jay-Z collab (the other being Holy Grail) that good. 
 
**frog** (10):

AS YOU GUESSED IT, [POO] HITS [FROG] ON THE HEAD WITH THE PIPE TOO.

[PENGUIN] WAKES UP AND SEES THAT [FROG] IS UNCONSCIOUS. CONFUSED, HE SCREAMS:

#Likes being fancy

**kappyko** (11): I'll be so mad if this pop excellence DOESN'T win but I'll take whatever. Anyways, have you ever heard a song sound so damn EXPENSIVE? It's the perfect example of pop medium suiting pop message, luxury celebrated on swirling champagne clatters and futuristic percussion. How can Justin sound so much like the future of pop in 2013 and come back 5 years later sounding like a distant artifact?
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ugh, fucking iconic in every sense of the word. the production is so LUSH!
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (10): This is actually a 100 when paired with the David Fincher directed video.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): ok like this is such a good comeback from futuresex/lovesounds can we just acknowledge that and ugh... god the intro for the album version is just so.... sultry. justin takes all of the air out of the room for it to burst back in and it’s beautiful
 
**strawberryswing1** (10): This song is a 10 based on the way JT delivers "I can't waaaaait to get you on the floor good lookin'" alone
 
**TragicKingdom1** (10): this song made me feel rly cool when i was 13
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): Weird lead single choice but still snaps
 
**1998tweety** (9): A massive bop, sexy af.
 
**OriginalKappa** (9): The lyrics are so cringeworthy (especially the 'ooh, so thick!' bit) but the horns, Jay's verse and the chorus are absolutely irresistible, a pop classic.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Jay and Justin complement each other very well 9 out of 10.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Justin made having your girl call you daddy a thing before it was cool
 
**twat\_brained** (8.5): The brilliance in this song is undone by the beat switches, but I appreciate Jay's verse. Not into Justin's vocalizations during said verse though.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): The chorus and Jay-Z's verse are both excellent. The verses, however a little stilted and the long intro in annoying. Could have been one of the best songs in the rate but it falls short.
 
**hikkaru** (7): This is so slick and boppy, other than the 40 second intro, as well as Jay-Z's part where the production changes up

#Does not like being fancy
 
**Raykel** (6): The trumpet parts were nice, but I really don't see why this was a single other than the Jay feature
 
**selegend** (6): bop but heterosexual
 
**tapdancingpig** (6): I hated this song when it came out, but I’ve significantly softened on it. The song should be at least one minute shorter (the 40 second intro and 30 second outro should have been slashed apart), but it is charming, even if there are moments that make me want to punch him.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (3): it's a mystery why this snooze-fest was chosen as a title track
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): there's not much of a melody, boring
 
**JunkyGS** (1): I hate the introduction beat, the production is so uninspired sounding for a song about supposedly about passionately flirting with your love interest, the lyrics are so empty & vapid even for a pop song along with cringe moments such as "Going out so hot, just like an oven And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it" Jay Z cant even save this song.

It’s a whirlwind of fun, from both the spiraling chorus to the punchy instrumentation. And the rap verses can be cheesy at times (that’s just how his songwriting is), but it’s solid. And it’s fun.

**penguin** (10): Another massive single and highlight on the album, Sorry, is majestic. It’s present at every dance party, every beachside swimsuit shop, every department store, and with good reason. Every artist who contributed to this helped shape one of the slickest EDM-leaning pop tracks in recent memory. Skrillex and BloodPop inject moments of bliss, with punchy horns, primal screams, and that weird synth thing that I can’t get out of my head. It’s one of Justin’s best songs, and it deserves its massive success.

**selegend** (10): i used to hate this, but now i realize how monumental it is
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): you literally have to be a liar to say this is not a banger.
 
**1998tweety** (9): This song bops but idk why exactly it was a bigger hit than WDYM.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): I feel like this will be looked back on fonder cause it will be removed from this song being justin's apology for being a little shit in 2015 lol
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): justin does generic really well
 
**kappyko** (8): Another addition to the gr8 pop pantheon of JB's bullshit idk the video is iconic and this era was kinda perfect everybody forgot about it but it was a good time man. White noise sweeps
 
**hikkaru** (7.5): this song just reminds me of 2016 when I was really depressed, but I guess it's not so bad
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): slightly overrated but easily a top 20 most iconic song of the decade

#Does not accept the apology

**twat\_brained** (8): I don't accept Justin's "apology", but I definitely accept the beat of this song.
 
**tapdancingpig** (6): This bops too hard to completely deny, but... these lyrics are so entitled, I’m repulsed if I’m not dancing hard enough. #JustinTrantorDidItBetter
 
**JunkyGS** (1): Finally. the moment we have all been waiting for. self reflection! calling yourself out! well.... no. Justin's ego couldnt handle that and this song comes across as the most insincere gaslighting apology. "'ll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two"

you'll apologize cause your partner wants you to? Not because you fucked up? Also continuing to not go one song without blaming the other person. yawn, especially when you promo this song specifically saying its about selena, along with other songs. Its yikes.

frogaranaman: # #4. Purpose
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 6.517
 
---
 
**TragicKingdom1**: I think I was subconsciously still a defener when it came to Bieber because I really didn't like this album back when it came out in 2015. However, in retrospect the production has aged really well and it's a cohesive collection of trop pop bops. It's still kind of rough around the edges and not particularly deep but I really hope we haven't passed this phase of pop because there's so much more potential here. [Grade: B+]
 
**ExtraEater**: ok album
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah**: haven't listened to it in a minute, but it was nice to come back to it and see it's still full of bangers. even the filler slaps. pretty awesome overall. Average: 8.15
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin**: Ultimately my biggest problem with this album is how repetitive it is. I know pop is usually that, though this comes across as annoying rather than cute and fun.
 
**selegend**: that album cover always makes me hard. also where is the bop Been You
 
**hikkaru**: I love EDM which was what I've seen this album described as but I do not like this milquetoast brand of it, nor do I like the more R&B-leaning cuts. The bonus tracks are honestly way better than the standard edition songs.
 
**OriginalKappa**: Pretty crazy that one album seemingly single-handedly changed the whole world's perception of Bieber. Like he went from absolute joke to a respectable 'mature' pop artist
 
**kappyko**: Justin shocks millions as he creates an album of pop songs that sound like pop music. It's very of-its-time for sure.

**penguin** (9): The famed Ellie Goulding diss track flows rather nicely, and his rapid delivery is a great way to usher in the sudden chorus. There’s some notable moments - “we were staying at the same fucking hotel floor” and as a whole, it’s a single that swings and hits. 
 
**frog** (10):

[_X_ FROG] COMES THROUGH THE WALL. [POO] CALMLY HELPS HIM UP, BUT [_PURPOSE_ FROG] IS FREAKED OUT.

_PURPOSE_ FROG: (PANICKING) EXCUSE ME? THERE’S ANOTHER ONE OF ME?

_X_ FROG: (LOOKING UP, THEN SCARED) WHAT THE FUCK?

_PURPOSE_ FROG: (HYPERVENTILATING, WALKING BACK AND FORTH) This is it. I am going insane. Nothing about this makes fucking sense. I’m definitely dead.

_X_ FROG: Or drugged?

_PURPOSE_ FROG: (SCARED) THAT MAKES IT WORSE.

AS [_PURPOSE_ FROG] CURLS UP INTO A BALL ON THE FLOOR, CRYING, [POO] WALKS OVER TO [_X_ FROG] AND EXPLAINS WHAT IS GOING ON.

POO: So, the explanation for what is going on is actually pretty simple. Basically, I got you guys and a few others from different dimensions together because I have a rate that you guys need to run.

_X_ FROG: A rate?

POO: (DISMISSIVE) I’ll explain what it is later. But, basically, no one in the proper dimension wanted to run this one. It’s an unpopular concept, for some reason. It’s focused around four pop men,

_X_ FROG: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Oh, that fucking explains it.

POO: and you guys were chosen because you were all listening to that artist when I met you.

#Don’t fuck with their love

**1998tweety** (10): Apparently this is sexist? I have to laugh, sometimes I can't with you popheads :snowflake:. This is one of the first Ed songs I bopped hard to, the chorus is so infectious. I didn't hear the uncensored version until recently so I thought he was just taking a breath between "Don't" and "with my heart". The first time I heard him say fuck shook me, I still bop to both the uncensored and censored versions.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): this bops but it's a guilty bop
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): a moetherfucking bop i still don't know where the slut shaming is
 
**OriginalKappa** (10): The self-censoring is weird but that's the only objection I have against this 100% certified BOP
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): ok yeah this fucking bops the synth work incorporated into the acoustic elements is outstanding
 
**skargardin** (10): Huge bop

 
**tapdancingpig** (10): If this song goes out before Day 3, I will actually riot.
 
**unovachamp** (10): Edward SNAPPED. His weird sing-rapping ability is questionable at times in other songs but this is solid.
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): very catchy, great wordplay
 
**ExtraEater** (9.5): good title
 
**twat\_brained** (9): One complaint I've heard about Ed Sheeran, which Todd in the Shadows has alluded to, is how overly wordy his songs are. That's definitely on display here. I think it's a great song, but it feels almost a little tooscathing for me to give it a 10, if I'm honest. All in all, it's like a gender-swapped "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", but done way, WAAAAYbetter.
 
**kappyko** (8.5): Electro fuzz bass accents a decent retribution pop rap track. Alrighty
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): bars.
  
**TragicKingdom1** (8): mildly slut shamey but complex which is something that i always appreciate
 
#FUCK Ellie Goulding lives

**hikkaru** (10): some say Ellie is still shaking to this very day. Actually I don't like the slut shaming associated with this song so Ed can kinda choke but like... it's such a bop
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my all time favourite Ed Sheeran songs. Ellie Goulding is shook! (Also it’s fun listening to On My Mind and this song back to back).

**strawberryswing1** (10): Ellie won.

**radiofan15** (9): Ellie Goulding deserved

**Overall average**: 7.470

**TragicKingdom1**: Despite not liking any of his projects, I don't believe Ed deserves the hate he gets on this sub. His terrible decisions are confined to just a handful of songs, and otherwise he generally makes wholesome, inoffensive, decent bops. My grade for it really depends on how many other songs from the endless amount of deluxe tracks are included to offset the three or four horrible songs on here. I really hope Ed can make more upbeat songs like Sing because that's where he truly shines. [Grade: B-]
 
**ExtraEater**: good album
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah**: obviously a polarizing album when it came to critics, but frankly I think it's a masterpiece when it comes to radio-friendly ballads and love declarations. surely Ed's best. Average: 8.83
 
**selegend**: not bad but not my type of music
 
**hikkaru**: I do not really like Ed Sheeran but this ended up being my highest average. Really it wasn't that bad at all other than Thinking Out Loud tbh
 
**OriginalKappa**: I will never understand popheads' hatred of this guy i swear
 
**strawberryswing1**: A surprisingly good album once you trim a few tracks.
 
**tapdancingpig**: I did not expect for this to be my favorite of the batch. 20/20 is probably much better, but it’s problems are things I judge more harshly.
 
**kappyko**: This album seems calculated to not offend, it's done its job. I was very happy to hear this
 
**twat\_brained**: this is one of my favorite albums of the 2010s; I was really looking forward to this after + and I found some much needed solace in it and its lyrics

**penguin** (10): The instrumental on this is so brilliant. The synths, the vocal samples, the buildup (which reminds me a bit of We Found Love, oddly enough), it’s all great. It’s a bold song from Mars, definitely outside of what was popular at the time, but all the elements work so well together it’s hard to imagine this not smashing. 
 
**frog** (10):

_PURPOSE_ FROG: You look kind of like someone who says “well, let’s see the damage” when you get the bill at a restaurant.

_X_ FROG: That’s funny, you kind of remind me of someone who doesn’t understand what a good tattoo is.

[_PURPOSE_ FROG] IS OFFENDED. AFTER [POO] HAS FINISHED EXPLAINING THE SITUATION TO [_JUKEBOX_ FROG], THEY WALK OVER TO THE OTHER TWO.

_PURPOSE_ FROG: (WHINING) Poooooooooo, _X_ Frog is being a meanieeeeeeee.

**1998tweety** (10): This song is so so good, such a groovy tune.
 
**hikkaru** (10): An honest to god anthem, Bruno is so good at making bops
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): this bops and always has
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song is so good, i have never met anyone who ever disliked this song
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): this was very overexposed in 2012 but this is a really good song.
 
**radiofan15** (10): A SEX BOP HOLY SHIT... I needed an ass in front of me as soon as I finished listening to this song
 
**rslashpoopheads** (10): bop
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song is awarded “stupidest song to be such a fucking banger”
 
**twat\_brained** (10): AW YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH! ooohThose guitars! That bassline! Bruno's passion! When I was 12 and I saw on Facebook that Bruno Mars would be releasing a new song that week, I was excited, because I enjoyed his Doo-Wops and Hooligans singles and would be looking forward to new music from him. I was NOT prepared for this, though. The fact that it's still played on the radio today says lots about its lasting power.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): i used to be almost exclusively a fan of Bruno Mars' ballads, but I've come around to also appreciate his more upbeat bangers, and damn is this a fucking gem!
 
**kappyko** (8): Bruno Mars pastiche pop succeeds mostly here, his co-opting of the Police's new wave is really quite fun as an element introduced into his slightly muddied pop/disco palette. The chorus's hoover synths and rising sweeps are really badass tricks of the pop producer palette. His best Sting impressions are great, too.

#Wants to stay in purgatory
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): The lyrics make me weirdly uncomfortable, but Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars are a match made in heaven.
 
**Raykel** (7.5): I hate all the weird ad libs that bring the song down, "Heyheyheyheyheyhey OOGH"
 
**selegend** (5): i remember when kidz bop covered this
 
**OriginalKappa** (3): Literally every time I hear this song I am shocked and confused as to how it became a worldwide hit lol

**penguin** (8): Meme intro aside, this song was destined to succeed, but sadly squandered. I blame the world because this is very much a funky disco modern classic. Mars isn’t quite perfect on this, but he’s saved by the infectious synth loop  and precious chorus.

#We ARE worth something

**hikkaru** (11): If you listen closely, you can hear the echoes of spiderman's ass being slapped (six times)
 
**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is the most fun song ever in existance. I can not imagine why anyone would hate this song.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): this baseline is so funky and fun and bruno’s charisma and personality makes this peak pop
 
**twat\_brained** (11): I was thinking of giving Mirrors my 11. Then this came on. I don't think there's a single music reviewer out there who doesn't like Treasure. If this doesn't win the rate I will actually be upset beyond consolation and will react accordingly.
 
**1998tweety** (10): So funky and groovy, my brother was the treasurer at my high school and the rest of the student council was trying to convince him to sing this song in front of the entire student body. He declined.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): BOP BOP BOP
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): Love the throwback sound to this! An underrated bop!
 
**kappyko** (10): Okay, can we agree this laid out the post-disco pastiche he would explore in literally every song after this? It's not perfect, of course: the gang vocals are notably dorky as hell, and the funk is notably studio-neutered. But his delivery is sweeter than ever before.
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): we go from an extremely sexually explicit song to a wholesome bop I stan.
 
**selegend** (10): one of his best
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): This song is a delight.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): treasure.

frogaranaman: # #3. Unorthodox Jukebox
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 7.259
 
---
 
**TragicKingdom1**: Bruno is extremely talented and this was an incredible improvement over his debut era. I think the pop music community finally realized that after Uptown Funk was released but he deserved recognition for being a living legend starting with this era! Everything is on point here and although compared to 24K Magic it's not as polished, it's definitely less derivative and carves out a better mix of throwback and modern pop. I really hope this album isn't overshadowed by the rest of Bruno's accomplishments because imo it's his best work. [Grade: A]
 
**ExtraEater**: good album
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah**: Great singles, a couple of awesome deep cuts as well. A couple of misses too, but overall a very good collection of songs. Average: 8.35
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin**: Unorthodox Jukebox sounds like it was mixed and mastered in mud. The entire thing is one big mess, especially the lyrics.
 
**selegend**: i far prefer doo-wops and hooligans tbh
 
**hikkaru**: Some really high highs and some low lows. A mixed bag all around, and while I definitely prefer 24K Magic, I understand this album's inclusion over it.
 
**OriginalKappa**: Great when it's funky, awful when it's reggae and mediocre when it's anything else.
 
**kappyko**: I was about to start this off saying that this ought to be compared to Thriller until I got to the actual album filler. This album fucking DROPS in the last half.

**penguin** (11): This is honestly probably one of my favorite songs of the entire decade, full stop. From the absolutely cathartic intro, crashing into Timbaland’s godly production, you’re thrusted into one of Justin’s most gorgeous, emotional tracks. The chorus is just pure pop perfection, catchy beyond belief, and while it feels like a product of its owner, a 90s boyband survivor, it also feels decidedly profound, a moment of clarity and weakness amidst an album of excess and bragadoccio romance. It’s just this perfect storm of feeling that can only exist in its current form, no other singer-producer could make this masterpiece theirs. Mirrors is not only one of the best pop songs of the decade, but one of the best songs of the decade. 
 
**frog** (11):

#Classic

**animefangrant62** (11): If this song doesn’t take first place you guys deserve to rot in hell.
 
**IntegrityNotIncluded** (11): One of the best pop songs of the 2010s, no question
 
**kanyewestrep\_** (11): beast
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): Under the Geneva Convention, you're actually an international criminal if you dislike this song.
 
**OriginalKappa** (11): The REAL Bohemian Rhapsody of our generation. @ me
 
**radiofan15** (11): Timberland (JT + Timbaland) never fail to amaze me with all the magic they can do together; ugh we stan a bromantic talented heterosexual duo of genius
 
**rslashpoopheads** (11): i made an account just to give this an 11
 
**skargardin** (11): a modern classic in the making
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): absolutely easy choice for best song on the album, and the entire rate
 
**tapdancingpig** (11): [sigh] I really hate Justin Timberlake. I really do. But this song is undeniable. The melody is gorgeous, JT sounds great on it, the harmonies are amazing, the outro is actually good, and the production is positively immaculate, especially in the final chorus. Justin should have re-recorded the “oh-oh-ohs” that span up to the end of the song (they sound like he’s really tired), but I can’t fault that in an otherwise pretty perfect song.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): one of the best songs of the 2010s and arguably Justin's best song ever.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (11): this became one of my favorite songs of all time from the moment i first heard it. all 8 minutes are just truly wholesome and magical, and i remember i was SO invested in its chart run back in the day.
 
**1998tweety** (10): Easy 10, this song is so iconic and definitely feels like the main event of the album. The length doesn't really kill it either, but with that being said I prefer the single edit
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): Justin peaked with this song, and what a great peak it is. The production is fantastic and the lyrics fit so well.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): a motherfucking BOP, but what does a pocketful of soap mean?
 
**selegend** (10): i recently chose this for karaoke with my friends but i forgot the song was 9 minutes long and it resulted in 2 minutes of awkward silence as we tried to figure out how to change the song
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): how someone can listen to this and say it’s insincere is beyond me. this takes so many influences to make THE perfect track. it’s all so natural and scratchy and so excessive and over the top. the only criticism anyone is allowed to make is the cheesy lyrics, but beside that, this is a goddamned masterpiece. respect that
 
**twat\_brained** (10): One of Timbaland's holy trinity of songs, alongside Say It Right and The Way I Are. This is what Justin's music should sound like and this is what we **want** from Justin; not that "Filthy" nonsense. Hell, even another Space Cowboy would be great!
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): excellent, so much better than the rest, the only melody i can remember from this album
 
**ExtraEater** (9): "Yesterday is history, Tomorrow's a mystery" lmao

#Is secretly a vampire, hates mirrors
 
**Raykel** (7.5): I love the chorus, I can love long time lengths, but it feels so unnecessary here, it doesn't lead to anything intersting, and it just felt like he was flexing that he could
 
**kappyko** (7): Timbaland as filtered through Alex da Kid fart sounds and Kanye West-aspiring pomposity (read: overblown). Actual song is an 8.5 by virtue of a perfect melody (a first on this album, maybe?), honestly, but the walky-talky outro that you will ALWAYS have to hear on a normal listen is a 3 or 4....
 
**hikkaru** (6.5): it's one of the better songs on the album but when this was a hit I found it to be a bit boring and my opinion hasn't really changed :/
 
**CarlieScion** (5): there's never any reason for a song to be EIGHT minutes long [2]

#Janet stans out in full force
 
**JunkyGS** (0): Another song ruined by over staying its welcome at 8 minutes without anything interesting enough production or lyrical wise to justify it. This song is the worst offender of the cringe narcissistic attitude plaguing this album. It is a song about supposedly reflecting and changing yourself in a relationship but none of this album shows that and Justin as a person to be the deliverer of that message is laughable when his entire career is filled with throwing people under the bus to serve as step stones for his own gain.

frogaranaman: # #2. The 20/20 Experience
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 7.310
 
---
 
**TragicKingdom1**: This is one of my favorite albums of all time. The production is so vibrant and complete and there really isn't another pop album that matches its level of polish from this decade at least. Hate the track lengths all you want, Timbaland SNAPPED and there isn't a moment where I'm not impressed by his genius. I think this is the definition of an essential and the Grammys can choke for snubbing it! [Grade: A+]
 
**ExtraEater**: decent album
 
**IntegrityNotIncluded**: My favorite album of the decade (thus far)
 
**J\_Toe**: OMG the songs are so long. I know someone in the voting thread said not to pay the interludes dust, but I'm gonna have to get my broom out.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah**: One of my top 10 albums of all time. Every track brings something special, catchy, and unforgettable. Average: 9.2.
 
**selegend**: this seems like a nice album for sex. not something to listen to for fun though.
 
**hikkaru**: This album just isn't for me and I'll be the first to admit it. I like songs that I can listen to whenever, are under five minutes, and work well in a playlist of whatever other songs. As it says in the title, this is an "experience" as an album, not really quick singles to enjoy at any time, which is the opposite of how I like listen to music. If you're a longer album type of person, more power to you, but I am most certainly not.
 
**OriginalKappa**: I love the fact that JT took a load of risks on this record but they don't always land. Some songs just weren't meant to be 7 minutes long tbh
 
**SendMeYourSATScores**: ok like no offense but this is literally the 2nd best album of all time right after the 20/20 experience part 2
 
**tapdancingpig**: I had feelings about this album. More than I expected. There’s a lot of good here, but there’s a lot I just can’t handle. Timberlake imports 60’s style casual sexism with the rest of the 60’s, and I can’t quite forgive that. Also, a lot of these outros are fucking ridiculous. But when it works, it fucking works
 
**kappyko**: Practically made to tell critics that pop is good, this has the ambition of a Kanye record yet little of the hooks to make up for the potentially overblown ideas. Sees GREATNESS in slights, sees fun in brief spurts.
 
**twat\_brained**: this album would've been better with a JC Chasez collab #justiceforjcscareer
