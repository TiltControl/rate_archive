The 2010s Ultimate Males Rate Reveal, Day 1 ‚Äì popheads when they have to rate men: 0110110101101001011100110110000101101110011001000111001001111001

\*pots and pans banging\* WELCOME TO HELL, WELCOME TO HELL, WELCOME TO HELL, WELCOME TO-

_ahem_ oh. Hello there. Welcome to the mens rate reveal, day one! We‚Äôre both super excited for you guys to relish in the fact that we actually rated men for once and it only turned out _mostly_ messy, so let‚Äôs hop right into some facts:

- There were [46 participants](https://pastebin.com/jp4mb0k2) in this rate. Neato!
- The average score on a song was **7.1120**. How average!
- The average controversy score was **2.0763**. As expected.

Also, to blatantly rip off the 2017 depression rate, here are fun facts about the hosts:

- /u/frogaranaman is currently being beaten up in a dark alley by late Jane Eyre readings, and
- /u/ThatParanoidPenguin [is a man and it‚Äôs disgusting p.](https://i.imgur.com/JQSJYT1.png)

Today is #8 - #7 for the bonus rate, and #45 - #31 for the main rate. We will also be revealing this rate on the plug.dj at 4PM EST. [**Join it here!**](http://plug.dj/popheads)

(Note: /u/ThatParanoidPenguin will not be able to make the plug.dj reveal and possibly the thread today. He's doing big boy work at a job, but will be able to join us for days 2 and 3!)

OPEN TO [PENGUIN, FROG] WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK. THEY ARE HOLDING HANDS. THEY COME ACROSS A TATTOO PARLOR, AND WALK IN. THEY WALK UP TO THE CLERK AND SAY,

---
 **animefangrant62** (2): That production is serving TLIC in a very very very fucking tragic way

#Almost

**TragicKingdom1** (7): mark my words......this goes out mid day 1

#Words: Marked

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): i really like this honestly. there‚Äôs a nice contrast with the melody and soft production. could‚Äôve used a high energy finish
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): a nice little opener but definitely does not prepare you for the jams that are about to follow.
 
**twat\_brained** (7): I'd mark them if Justin wasn't such a whiny bastard on this song. He sings pretty well, though.

#Words: Not Marked
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6): that vocal instrumental is really irritating
 
**1998tweety** (5.5): Lyrically this is a good intro song, but his weird squeaking in the background is so annoying.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): Ok, but really drawn out for an outro
 
**CarlieScion** (4): really whiney
 
**tapdancingpig** (4): This was too short to be anything.
 
**hikkaru** (3): what is this
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): boring and the production is annoying
 
**OriginalKappa** (2): God that riff sucks
 
**ImADudeDuh** (1): I hate this album already
 
**JunkyGS** (1): Having the hindsight of what we know now about Justin and his relationship this song can't be taken seriously. He admits his partner loses themselves in trying to save the relationship, but offers no self reflection as to why that is and just promises to "give you all i got" whatever that means.... also production that didnt age well which will be a common theme here.
 
**kappyko** (1): About as annoying as having Francis & the Lights moan in my ears for several minutes as Kanye West reads shit poetry in my ear. Only without the beat that made that song worth something to people. A bland intro.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (0): Is this an intro? I can‚Äôt tell but I think it is. Also it‚Äôs boring.

**penguin** (6): Aside from the weird transitions, most notably between the intro and the verse (which sounds as odd as the beginning of The xx‚Äôs Say Something Loving or Kanye West‚Äôs botched Wolves percussion), this is an okay track. I‚Äôm a sucker for steel drums, and while this does feel like a half-assed reggae song, it‚Äôs fun. 
 
**frog** (6):

IT‚ÄôS A NORMAL DAY IN THE [FROG] HOUSEHOLD. COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL, [FROG] CHECKS THE MAIL AND BEGINS TO PAGE THROUGH THEM ONE BY ONE.

**strawberryswing1** (5): lmao imagine calling out Drake for appropriating cultures when this song exists.

#yes

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is going :airplane: day 1 but it's decent

#\*hits blunt\*

**poppinmmolly** (9): this would be a 10 but I don't like the airhorn
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): reggay
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): I see someone liked Amy Winehouse's Back to Black B-Sides‚Ä¶

#\*calls the police\*

**1998tweety** (6.5): The first dud on the album for me, not a huge fan of reggae-styled songs.
 
**kappyko** (5): WHY DOES HE SOUND LIKE EZRA KOENIG ON THIS LMFAO yall LISTEN to "Jessica" by Major Lazer or his freaking "Hold Up" demo... maybe this just speaks more to non-Jamaican people putting on accents but still I screamed
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): definitely one of the weaker songs on his discography.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): This does not fit on this album. At all.
 
**hikkaru** (3): so annoying lmao. the part at the end sounds like I'm playing Space Cadet Pinball on Windows XP
 
**selegend** (3): oh no thank you to this. fake patois is an immediate turn off to me
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): boring and flat
 
**OriginalKappa** (2): Modern reggae needs to be stopped
 
**ImADudeDuh** (1): the fucking air horns had me dying
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): yikes that‚Äôs annoying as hell i had to turn down the volume what kind of garbage generic marimba is that. bruno makes me feel queasy here
 
**letsallpoo** (0): why you gotta be so rude
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (0): I would rather die than ever listen to this song again. Please, put me out of my misery.
 
**twat\_brained** (0): I wasn't expecting to give Bruno my 0 when I started this album but then again, I wasn't expecting Bruno to attempt reggae. And fail miserably. I don't even hate it that much, I just need to give something a 0 and this was my best choice.

**penguin** (5): The title track and closer is just not for me, it just doesn‚Äôt do anything for me at all. The piano is forgettable, Bieber isn‚Äôt all that special on here, and the lyrics are a step above your average Christian piano ballad, with an ounce of the vocal performances you get from the genre. 
 
**frog** (2):

HAPPY TO OBLIGE, THEY SIT [FROG] DOWN IN THE CHAIR FIRST AND BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TATTOO.

TATTOO CLERK: So, what would you like to get?

FROG: Okay, so: (EXCITEDLY) we have a third and we are deeply in love with him.

TATTOO CLERK: (TAKING NOTES) Nice, nice.

PENGUIN: So we would like to get a tattoo of his face.

TATTOO CLERK: (JUDGING, BUT GOING WITH IT) ..okay.

FROG: I opted for the arm, but penguin, being the daredevil he is..

#Do you have time to talk about our Lord and Savior,

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this is so cute i wanna cry.
 
**kappyko** (7): Idk why im giving love to THIS ballad over the others in this rate. Maybe it's his vocals serving well over this type of stuff?

#Isabelle said FUCK religion

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): I hate the voice over at the end it would be rated higher if it wasn't there.
 
**1998tweety** (7): This sounds like the song a father writes about his wife and child. The speaking at the end kills this though, dropped a point.
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): Cute but kinda boring
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): kinda sweet and i like the monologue tbh but could use some more spice
 
**selegend** (6): i hope he‚Äôs got his shit together now
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): It‚Äôs weird that this transitions from upbeat pop bops to Christian down tempo music. Not judging but I feel like there could have been two different albums here.
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (3): The spoken word bit really, and I mean really, brings this song down. Jeez.
 
**Raykel** (3): This doesn't bring me closer to God, it brings Hillsong's leader closer to cumming and I'm just disgusted during the whole song
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): boring and slow
 
**JunkyGS** (2): Justin talking about his relationship with god. Its as good as you expect. It shows Justin is completely lost and hallow as a person.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): ballads are snooze and that vocal outro is super cringy
 
**twat\_brained** (2): What did I say about piano ballads? And besides I don't really feel where Justin is coming from with this, he's still as douchebaggy as he was before this album came out and during its rollout. I'm not really in a mood to hear this song again.

#Praise the Lord

**1998tweety** (8): This is cute; when is his Christian era though? (**Host's note:** This was it.)
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i personally disagree but i see where you're coming from.
 
**ExtraEater** (7.5): good title

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): a somewhat touching ballad...probably the best one on here
 
#\*bursts through the door\* I‚Äôm atheist
 
**twat\_brained** (7): I don't doubt Justin saved a legion of Beliebers with this song; I just feel it's a bit dull. Not everyone can do a piano ballad, unfortunately. He gave it a decent effort, though.
 
**tapdancingpig** (6.5): This could almost be a good song if his vocal wasn‚Äôt this awful. He‚Äôs just too... nasal for any of this to seem legit to me.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): This does not fit in with the rest of the album's aesthetic
 
**kappyko** (5): I eagerly await the documentary
 
**Raykel** (5): This sounds like it was written by someone who was at most sad for a day, just so pandered and uninspired
 
**CarlieScion** (3): this is very boring
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): also very meh and flat
 
**JunkyGS** (1): More general "woah man im working on me but only god can judge me" to again avoid all criticism and no actual commitment to being a better person. Just empty promises.

#I was close to commenting it too, tbh

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I can't wait to see how many EDGY comments will say "no its not"

**penguin** (3): This is my least favorite song on the record. I‚Äôm all for Ed‚Äôs rapping skills, but there‚Äôs just a lot that doesn‚Äôt work here. The chorus seems detached, the lyrics aren‚Äôt anything to write home about, and he wavers between spoken word and rapping that feels really awkward. On top of all of that, the production is incredibly weak, with flimsy drums that aim for a 2000s Fort Minor-esque aesthetic, but just do not have any weight behind them at all.

#We love hip hop!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): once again, bars!
 
**1998tweety** (8): Hearing Ed rap is interesting, I know he did it on his first album and he spat bars on End Game, but this still feels weird. He really is a triple threat huh (singing, raping, and playing instruments).
 
**twat\_brained** (8): eyyy, nice shoutout to Bon Iver. Ed is a brilliant storyteller, and I really appreciate his spoken word efforts here. I don't entirely agree with the lyrics; however, his emotion is palpable and raw, much like Nina. I never gave this enough credit.
 
**hikkaru** (7.5): Ed is the king of rap and Taylor is the queen. stream end game
 
**radiofan15** (7.5): Damn... Ginger Eminem outrapped Taylor and all of our faves
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Ed Sheeran rapping? In my acoustic album? It‚Äôs more likely than you‚Äôd think.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): the "hook was a lie" part had me shook a bit

#Stream ‚Äú7 rings‚Äù
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): This song is fascinating to listen and look at the lyrics but as a song it‚Äôs not the most appealing. It‚Äôs honestly the most passive aggressive song I‚Äôve heard.
 
**skargardin** (6): This was pretty forgettable. Lyrically strong but idk it didn't really hook me :shrug:
 
**Raykel** (5): I can usually tolerate his rap vocals but this was full on and just no thank you
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): this is dorky in an ugly way
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): It's objectively fine but I just found his rapping cringy
 
**CarlieScion** (2): men = bad. the man = worse.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (1): "Hip-hop isn‚Äôt just music; it has a culture. Like when you‚Äôre simply hanging out with your friends and high-five each other, that‚Äôs hip-hop. For example, waking up in the morning and going to school without showering, that‚Äôs hip-hop too."

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is kind of cute
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): yes sir that line right there before the drop

#Luke, close your eyes
 
**skargardin** (6): I used to love this but maan this album is not starting off as good as i remember.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): This is the second song on the album. The first one felt like an inro. This one also feels like an intro. This album does not flow well
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): this is basically filler but it‚Äôs still decent production
 
**ignitethephoenix** (4): I literally forgot this song after I heard it
 
**kappyko** (4): The drop sounds like a video game song that I would love in elementary school. Justin Bieber sounds like he's whispering new age.
 
**OriginalKappa** (3): Really really ugly bass drop. gross af
 
**tapdancingpig** (3): The drop is disgusting.
 
**JunkyGS** (2): WOE IS ME the song. Justin whines about the pressure that comes with celebrity and how people want him to be "perfect", angsty lyrics like "Act like you know me, but you never will" show Justin has 0 ability to self reflect. Nobody wants you to be perfect and we don't care to know you; how about you dont fucking drive under the influence nearly killing somebody and not like a general ass hat? A standard that is a far cry from "perfect".
 
**CarlieScion** (0): 1stWorldProblems.mp3
 
**ImADudeDuh** (0): oh my god this fucking song i remember seeing the stupid music vide of justin in the hills during HR Chart videos and I fucking hated it everytime and I hated this song so much then and if anything it has gotten worse with time and I just hate everything about this and this song has no redeeming qualities whatsoever

#FUCK Trump
 
**twat\_brained** (6.5): Is marrying the daughter of an outspoken Trump supporter "showing us"? Or being a full-blown self-righteous Christian trying to defend the honor of Easter and Christmas on Instagram? -1 for this song aging poorly. Nay, -2 since you lost me as a Belieber.

#I have no creative title, here are the positive comments

**twat\_brained** (9): I used to strain the hell out of my chest voice trying to reach Justin's notes on that chorus. I also used to like Sean's verse but looking back on it his verse is kinda messy. If it was better put together it'd be another 10 from me.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Justin vocal‚Äôs are standout on this song. I feel like he actually put more of an effort here. And Big Sean‚Äôs part actually fits well into the song.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): super catchy but i wish the production had more texture
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): the hook is gorgeous but the rest of the song and especially Big Sean's verse don't add much.

#I have no creative title, here are the negative comments
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): melody is stupid simple and justin in very whiny. this track would‚Äôve suited abel way better

**CarlieScion** (4): i thought one man was bad enough. now you're giving me TWO on one song? disgusting
 
**radiofan15** (4): Justin has to be one of the most uninteresting pop stars outside of his hit singles because this deep cuts are puting me to sleep
 
**kappyko** (3): This song sounds like the sounds of vibrations in the air. I'm not sure, though.

ECSTATIC, [FROG] JUMPS AROUND HIS ROOM WITH JOY. AS HE RUNS TO THE KITCHEN TO GRAB A BOTTLE OF WINE TO CELEBRATE, HE HAS A STARK REALIZATION: _I didn‚Äôt apply to NASA for a Mars trip._ HE CONTINUES TO READ THE LETTER:

LETTER: Bruno, when we read your application, we knew it‚Äôd be a perfect fit. Pop star gone astronaut is not something that‚Äôs normal.

FRUSTRATED, [FROG] THROWS DOWN THE LETTER ON HIS TABLE. _This is meant for my asshole neighbor,_ THOUGHT [FROG]. MUTTERING CURSES UNDER HIS BREATH, HE GRABS THE LETTER AND BEGINS TO HEAD OUT TO WALK UP TO [BRUNO]S APARTMENT.

#\*bangs chest\*

**poppinmmolly** (10): I fucking love this song. It's amazing.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): if you can get past the fact that he's singing about wanting to fuck like gorillas, it's a great fucking song.
 
**1998tweety** (9): The lyrics are wild af. Honestly hearing this is kind of surreal.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): This is the best attempt on making a song about fucking like Gorilla‚Äôs but it still results in a song about fucking like Gorilla‚Äôs. It sounds great though if I ignore the lyrics.
 
**Raykel** (8): Why did the lyrics have to be so gross
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8): remix is better but this is still sweaty in a GOOD way
 
**twat\_brained** (7.5): This is‚Ä¶ a choice. Bruno's found his calling with his hip-hop/funk sound; however, it appears he's giving hair rock a chance here. It's not totally unsuited to him, I'll admit. And I'm sure if they're fucking like gorillas, it definitely‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ feels good. üòâ

#This song, in its attempt to sound sexy, is actually playing off of racism to achieve this sound. In this essay,
 
**ExtraEater** (6.5): i see what he's going for, but eh it kinda doesn't work
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): i used to really hate this song but you know what. i appreciate it even though the melody is stupid
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6): so this was a mental image i really needed in my life
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): The music here is nice and catchy, but what the fuck are the lyrics? Unbeknownst to me this would be a phrase I uttered on almost every track as it continued in it's 30 minute plus run time.
 
**tapdancingpig** (5): Is this seriously a song? That people made? And more people approved? Like, a lot of it‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm not comfortable with sex metaphors involving animals and the chorus is a bit of a letdown compared to what comes before.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): NEVER liked this song!
 
**IntegrityNotIncluded** (4): I never understood the hype behind this one
 
**radiofan15** (4): The VMAs performance with the green digital gorilla in the background is so fucking epic but the studio version is so subdued and sleepy it's almost disturbing
 
**hikkaru** (3): i sleep
 
**kappyko** (3): I loved this when I was in elementary school. I don't think I understood any of the lyrics. They suck and ruin it. But pounding pop rock is a little welcome; this climaxes better than "Sign of the Times" ever could, at least! The production sounds muddy as hell, though. Also note the Haynie "hey"s in the back in the outro.
 
**strawberryswing1** (2): I love sex positivity. I do not love this song.
 
**JunkyGS** (1): Cringe and the imagery is just bizarre, especially since little cutesy bruno mars is singing it. Just isnt the right song for him.
 
**OriginalKappa** (0): Uptown Funk and 24K Magic are two of the best pop hits of the century, and this is the worst. we love a versatile artist
 
**TulipWaffles** (0): What an unsexy sex song. I genuinely don't understand how anybody could find this appealing

#Going‚úàÔ∏èStan

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the distorted bass sound isnt normally something i'm into but it works well here imo
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): This song started nice and then the guitars came him halfway through and I was scalped.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): this is just so interesting with the dark synths and light melodies. i truly believe justin is the only artist who could pull this off so gracefully. what a crazy experience
 
**hikkaru** (8): that electronic buzz throughout is amazing! really like the production but it's still too long
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): even though every song is long, this is the only one that feels a little too repetitive to me. does it still bang tho? of course.

#FUCK flying
 
**kappyko** (7.5): Exercise in astronomic prettiness.
 
**radiofan15** (7.5): Quite harder to digest but still very trippy and spacey, in a good way
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): it was an 8 until the weird screams near the end. That‚Äôs not sexy sorry Justin.
 
**twat\_brained** (6.5): omfg is that some sort of hentai orgasm he inserted into the song near the end? Did he try to do like "Break The Ice" with that sort of thing? Now that I think about it, this song reminds me of "Ready For You" by Beyonc√©. Of course that song has Beyonc√© singing it and isn't overly long, so it won't work as well for Justin.
 
**strawberryswing1** (5.5): the sex noises are so unsettling
 
**CarlieScion** (5): this is very boring
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): all these space things seem weirdly forced and unsexy? idk if i would go to the moon, I would rather just be on the moon and justin can fuck me when we got normal gravity again
 
**Raykel** (4): I really don't like when a song features moaning unless it's Love to Love You Baby by Donna Summer
 
**TulipWaffles** (2): I think JT was aiming for 'timeless' and hit 'dated' instead

**penguin** (8): Another synthy affair, this is definitely a late-album standout, with a killer vocal sample that lifts the chorus above the skeletal verses where I‚Äôm just waiting to get back to those luscious synths. I completely forgot about this track but it‚Äôs damn solid. 
 
**frog** (7):

**radiofan15** (7): Quite fillerish but still captivating and nicely produced
 
**CarlieScion** (6): the opening "vinyl" noises makes me uncomfortable as fuck
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): A song this boring should not be eight. minutes. long.
 
**kappyko** (3.5): I wish his grand pop vision had a lot more fun to it. I've always been more partial to mint flavors, anyways. Y'all really wanted me to skip the outros to these JT songs when they've saved most of them from hook-less, fun-less hell? I love the freestyle bass synth stabs, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis would be proud. A shame this song's sweetness comes only at the end; the first half is about as enticing as nicotine gum.
 
**Raykel** (2): Omg this is so creepy, make that guy shut up
 
**JunkyGS** (1): The intro is uneeded, the deep narrator voice is dumb, the song over stays its welcome big time at 8 minutes, the chorus is awful, more corny & cringe lyrics "So tell why, we're making love like professionals on the first time. Acting unprofessional but it works out"

"Let me elevate your appetite Any flavor you want Now my selection is the tasty kind But you, you're delicious on your own After I break you down my fingers"

In reality, this is pretty much her song, and Justin's playing second fiddle to her. That's what I love about it. And it also feels like a precursor to Strangers.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is the only non single that is good, and NO its not cause of halsey!
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): might still be Halsey's best song.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): MAJOR bop, i really hope they collab again bc their voices sound great together
 
**kappyko** (6): A traditional R&Bass bop that would find its way to killing the charts had Halsey been relevant back then. Maybe this would've been great released now? Never too late, I guess!

**1998tweety** (8): I'm stanning this solely cause of Halsey.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): A Woman? On my Men‚Äôs Rate??? I‚Äôm disgusted I‚Äôm telling you \s
 
**hikkaru** (7): a woman.............
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): Wait... why does this remind me to the alternative anti-pop album Hopeless Fountain Kingdom and its song Strangers?

**Raykel** (2): They're both singing out of their ranges
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this is like closer but not good

#These comments do not mention Halsey
 
**ExtraEater** (9): surprise standout non-single
 
**poppinmmolly** (6): the drop is okay
 
**selegend** (6): he really was ahead of the curve with this album huh
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): meh, melody is flat
