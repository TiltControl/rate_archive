The 2010s Ultimate Males Rate Reveal, Day 2 ‚Äì me: men be making music | popheads: allegedly
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/aouptw/the_2010s_ultimate_males_rate_reveal_day_2_me_men/

Haha, you thought you got rid of the men? Boy, you are in for a surprise. Fast facts!

- There were [46 participants](https://pastebin.com/jp4mb0k2) in this rate. Okay!
- The average score on a song was **7.1120**. Cool!
- The average controversy score was **2.0763**. Sick!

Also, to blatantly rip off the 2017 depression rate, here are fun facts about the hosts:

- /u/frogaranaman has spent more on concert tickets this year alone in comparison to his entire life, and
- /u/ThatParanoidPenguin has managed to narrowly miss seeing half of the 2019 BNA nominees.

Today is #6 - #4 for the bonus rate, and #30 - #16 for the main rate. We will also be revealing this rate on the plug.dj at 2PM EST. [**Join it here!**](http://plug.dj/popheads)

**penguin** (10): The most somber song on the album, Justin closes with this brooding, downtempo track. The ocean metaphors fit the watery reversed instrumental quite well, and honestly, it‚Äôs a wonderful closer. There‚Äôs a magical wonder to it, and quite a bit dreamier than anything on the album.

FROG: Uhh.. what‚Äôs going on?

FROG: What does that mean?

STORE CLERK: That I‚Äôve been expecting you.

FROG: Can you expand on that?

STORE CLERK: On the fact that I‚Äôve been expecting you?

FROG: Yes.

ANNOYED, [FROG] DECIDES TO ASK [PENGUIN] WHO THIS PERSON IS BUT SEES THAT HE IS NOT ABLE TO SPEAK PROPERLY AT THE MOMENT.

#:(

**skargardin** (10): Don‚Äôt do this one dirty y‚Äôall. I believe in you.

#Creative title relating to floors

**1998tweety** (10): This is probably the only song in the rate where the long song length actually helped make the song better. This is so atmospheric and chill, amazing as a closer.
  
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): is there anything more blissful and peaceful than this song? no.
 
**radiofan15** (9): DAE feel this song is remiscent of a Radiohead B-Side song sonically speaking? Maybe that's why I love it
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): super calming
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): love love love the atmosphere on this one BUT this is the one song on the album that prob does not justify its length
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): This is a nice ballad but it just doesn‚Äôt fit with the rest of the album.
 
**poppinmmolly** (7): I like the instrumental, although it sounds like a printer sound sometimes? it's weird.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.5): A ballsy finish to the already ballsy album, JT doesn't nail it completely but it's still a nice sounding song. Sets the tone for Part 2 though.

#The floor is dirty
 
**ExtraEater** (6.5): i see what he's going for, but eh it kinda doesn't work
 
**OriginalKappa** (5): The beat with the rewinding tape is way too creepy for a ballad. It's like if Revolution 9 was a heartfelt love song
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i‚Äôve cried to this before but i‚Äôm not feeling it rn
 
**twat\_brained** (4.5): Even Justin's run out of patience and energy after this long-ass album, and I don't blame him.
 
**kappyko** (4): Hokey ambient pop ballad. I'd be more forgiving of a different artist of this attempt at reaching into deep (haha) territory, but this isn't nearly as enticing for listening on my own time. I'll be nice for the general prettiness of the orchestration, but his forlorn is not convincing. Extra .5 for the last few seconds.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (2): zzzzz
 
**CarlieScion** (1): this instrumental might be the worst and most anxiety-inducing thing i've ever heard
 
**JunkyGS** (1): Cringy metaphors fill another bloated song. Cliche af, barely any lryics, alot of empty noise and overall filler. His vocal deliver is whiny as usual and clashes against the production.

**penguin** (4): I‚Äôm sure a lot of people do like this song, but to me, this represents everything I dislike about Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran‚Äôs songwriting. It has the semblance of being an emotional breakup song, but is riddled with clich√© and self-absorbed lyricism, with laughable lines like ‚Äúmy mama don‚Äôt like you and she likes everyone.‚Äù This is probably one of my least favorite #1s of the decade, and it‚Äôs pretty out of place on this album sonically. 
 
**frog** (5):

THE [TATTOO CLERK] HAS BECOME VISIBLY STRESSED. _How can I get out of this? I don‚Äôt want to become complicit in this hobby._ [POO] SEES THIS STRESS, AND THEN ASKS:

POO: What‚Äôs taking so long?

THE [TATTOO CLERK] NOW HAS A DECISION TO MAKE: TO KINK SHAME OR NOT TO KINK SHAME. THIS DECISION WILL BECOME THE FATE FOR THESE THREE PATRONS.
 
---
**kappyko** (10): One time my dad and I heard heard a radio edit of this song that basically repeated the entire song 3 or 4 times it lasted half of our car ride we were so confused and that's why it's a 10. Does nobody mention the swooping of what sounds like actual air samples in the last half?

---
#We get it, you guys like Halsey

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a bop that halsey did not improve whatsoever

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Halsey actually does a really great cover of this song, don't fucking @ me. More importantly can we talk about how Ed Sheeran is credited for two consecutive year-end #1 songs? A mighty impressive feat if I do say so myself. I've never had an immense hatred for this like the rest of Popheads does, for whatever reason, I'm guessing radio overplay. Just like in the Billboard Year-End #1 Rate, I will proposition to all of you a cover of this song should this get past day 1.

**CarlieScion** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1pUqmaPsFA

#Mama likes you

**1998tweety** (10): This is such a good song and not at all what I would've expected JB to make. Ed is working his magic as well, a def contender for my 11.
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): it was overexposed but it's really good
 
**radiofan15** (10): GINGER SATAN snapped... if JT wasn't in this rate this would be my 11
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i‚Äôve heard this too many times to have an opinion anymore
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This song is kind of juvenile, but it works well. The line "My mama don't like you, and she likes everyone" is corny and seems like it came out of an Adam Sandler movie or something. The trumpet line at the end is good too.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): I actually like this song. I think it would have been better if it was Ed singing it, but it‚Äôs a chill little song.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i think r/popheads hates this so it's gonna be out in day 1 but it's still a cool, relaxing, and empowering bop.
 
**unovachamp** (8): Ed is such a force that he‚Äôs all over tracks he isn‚Äôt even in!!!
 
**Raykel** (7.5): If I wanted an Ed Sheeran song I'd listen to Ed Sheeran BUT this is a good Ed Sheeran song

#Got into clubs using his name

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This should have stuck with the original title of ‚ÄòFuck Yourself‚Äô. It would have been more impactful and less passive aggressive. Or Ed Sheeran should have kept this song for himself because it would see Ed saying fuck yourself but not Justin.
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7): While I very much enjoy this song, I've enjoyed every single cover of it ten times more than the original version.
 
**ExtraEater** (6.5): i see what he's going for, but eh it kinda doesn't work
 
**OriginalKappa** (6): This is literally just a middle of the road Ed Sheeran song so if popheads rates it higher than the rest of X i will be upset
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): zzzzzzz
 
**strawberryswing1** (5): I'll never understand why this song got so huge. It's nothing special.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): this has always felt underdeveloped and forgettable to me despite how big of a hit it was. every other ballad on here is much better
 
**selegend** (1): the worst ed sheeran song in this rate

#When did Justin hurt you so hard

**JunkyGS** (1): We get Justin's most honest lyric so far "And I never like to admit that I was wrong" but that doesnt save the song from being so fucking placating and puts him on a pedestal as per usual.
 
**hikkaru** (0): This is the worst combination of annoying and boring and I cannot believe this song was so huge because it actually just makes me fall asleep every time I hear it. Bieber's voice isn't something I actually want to listen to so he needs to be backed up by good production and this literal Ed Sheeran knockoff (that wouldn't be good on his album either) is about as much of a snoozer as you can possibly get in terms of production. I hope this flops hard

**penguin** (9): Shoutout to the ‚Äúwahhh‚Äù sound effect from Pusha T‚Äôs Numbers On The Board, and shoutout to all the other wild sound effects on this track, from crickets to chants. The production on this is a monster and I feel like it‚Äôll probably be overlooked but this is easily one of the highlights from this album. 
 
**frog** (8):

PENGUIN: (STUTTERING) I.. that‚Äôs..

STORE CLERK: Yes I am.

REALIZING THAT HE‚ÄôS BEEN CAUGHT IN HIS LIE, [PENGUIN] WHISPERS INTO [FROG]S EAR:

PENGUIN: (QUIETLY) That‚Äôs my new boss, poo. I told him I had a suit and wans‚Äôt poor, but now he realizes that‚Äôs a lie. I‚Äôm fucked.

FROG: (ROLLING HIS EYES) Dude, I‚Äôve lied about more for interviews and got the jobs. You‚Äôll be fine.

PENGUIN: This isn‚Äôt that kind of.. okay, I guess.

[PENGUIN] WALKS OVER TO [POO] AND BEGINS TO TALK WITH HIM. JUST OUT OF EARSHOT FOR [FROG], HE STARTS TO WALK AROUND THE STORE. HE CATCHES BITS AND PIECES OF THE CONVERSATION, BUT THE ONLY ONE THE AUDIENCE HEARS IS THIS:

POO: You do realize that I knew you lied about your services, right? You have a prolific profile online.

PENGUIN: (SIGHING) I know, I just.. I really need this, okay?

POO: (CHUCKLING) Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not mad at you for it.

_Fuck,_ [FROG] REALIZES. _This \*is\* a sugar daddy thing._

#Danced in the light

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): ok now if this isn‚Äôt day 3 then the rate is rigged. i‚Äôve never stopped and put my thoughts down while listening to the album before and it‚Äôs amazing. the transition from the creamy regal-ness of suit and tie to the smooth and lucious style of don‚Äôt hold the wall is brilliant. timbaland is a fucking genius
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): LOVE the production here, it sounds like a modernized Scott Storch beat
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): gorgeous.
 
**radiofan15** (8): The first half kinda lost me but the annexed remix in the second half gave me life

#Held the wall
 
**kappyko** (7.5): I love the groove on this, but I'm unsure of how fun it is because of JT's presence and how fun it is because of Timbaland's badass production, straddling a line between pseudo-tribal beats and rump-shaking worthy hi hats.
 
**1998tweety** (7): This feels like background music mostly, a mega long interlude.
 
**OriginalKappa** (7): One of the biggest examples of the main issue with this record for me, it could be a really great track if it cut down at least a couple minutes.
 
**poppinmmolly** (7): a bop but way too long
 
**twat\_brained** (7): How about "don't hold up this album any longer than you need to"? I get that long-form songs are kinda Justin's thing but I don't appreciate it much. And there's too much focus on the deep modulated voices. He tried to recreate LoveStoned but it doesn't feel the same.
 
**tapdancingpig** (6.5): ...it‚Äôs well produced, but that‚Äôs a weird choice of a chorus. I think I like the outro more than the rest of the song.
 
**CarlieScion** (6): this sounds very mismatched to me
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): Ok but as an introvert I very much prefer to hold said wall.
 
**Raykel** (5.5): It was pretty good but then they added that hey chant in the background and depleted my joy
 
**JunkyGS** (3.5): ruined by length and repetitiveness, but had potential to sorta bop
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): started fine but just went on for SO long and had nothing notable about it

**1998tweety** (8.5): Natalie out-sold a little bit but this is still great.

**hikkaru** (7.5): Nina vs Natalie, who will win

#None of the comments were positive, really
 
**twat\_brained** (8.5): I'd always passively listen to this or skip it in favor of a single or a cut I liked better. Some Sheerio I am. I wonder how Nina feels today, especially after Ed dedicated an entire song to their failed relationship. EDIT: Wait it's actually about popheads darling Nina Nesbitt? She dated Ed? I know what I'm asking about when she does an AMA.
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): Cute I guess
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): the cheese lyrics here are close to being cute but it fails and the piano is annoying. but at least the songwriting is decent
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): even when this album was pretty much all I listened to, this was a song I wasn't crazy about.
 
**CarlieScion** (6): kinda boring
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.5): It's weird, this is a good song. But there's just something that really really bugs me about it and I really can't place my finger on it. Instead of me feeling good, I feel annoyed.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Another chill funky song, also not super long so I don't get bored.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): almost filler tbh but i like how it continues the vibes from Pusher Love Girl
 
**OriginalKappa** (8): The intro is cringe but the horns are great, also doesn't needlessly add 4 minutes on to its length so that's a big plus
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): This is really cute, and it‚Äôs under five minutes.
 
**kappyko** (7.5): Same lane as the last one, maximalist prettiness yet not enough time in the studio to be catchy.

#Shook from the START

**poppinmmolly** (10): what an album opener! I love the "I'm just a ju-ju-ju-ju-junkie for your love" bit too. My only critique, like all of the songs on this album, is that it's a tad too long.
 
**radiofan15** (10): THIS, THIS IS HOW YOU OPEN AN ALBUM HOLY SHIT... the outro is so fucking heavenly and epic!
 
**TragicKingdom1** (10): honestly the perfect summation of the album as a whole...i especially love the (first) bridge
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): the kind of intro song that assures you you're in for something special.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): this is a great song but i won‚Äôt be mad if it goes out day 1 like i understand
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Those strings at the beginning of the song are fantastic. As for the rest of the song, it‚Äôs alright but Justin‚Äôs falsetto doesn‚Äôt work for me as much.
 
**tapdancingpig** (6): God fucking dammit. I was about to like a JT song, and then it had to be 8 minutes long. Oh sure, I had some issues with it before ‚Äúj j j j junkie for your love‚Äù was burned into my brain (‚Äúlittle mama‚Äù is a phrase that should have died with the 60‚Äôs), but adding four minutes in length to an otherwise really solid song was a bad move. I don‚Äôt love the ‚Äúlove = drugs‚Äù metaphor to begin with, but I was suspending my liberal rage until he started listing off street drugs. Really?
 
**OriginalKappa** (4): I get the whole 'love is a drug' thing has been done to death but to compare your actual irl wife to a drug dealer is just really weird to me
 
**kappyko** (3): Lacks a personality, melodies are awkward, the production is pretty but still feels soulless. The outro actually does save this, surprisingly. Herowine? Never mind.

#Outros
 
**1998tweety** (7): This is a pretty standard intro but what's with the long outros I can't its 9pm and I have 2 albums after this.
 
**Raykel** (7): Song would've benefited without the last half, but it was fun enough
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): The first half is very smooth and nice. The second half with Justin's pseudo-rapping is questionable in style and much more repetitive. The biggest detriment to this album is that some of the song, this one included, get drawn out much longer than they should, which causes the score to go down.
 
**strawberryswing1** (7): the second half of this is unnecessary

**twat\_brained** (6): There were a lot of things that worked for "FutureSex/LoveSounds". I'm not sure 8-minute songs were one of them. And besides, he can't be singing about Jessica since we've established from BoJack Horseman that she's a B-list celeb, so she'd only offer him class b drugs; not "hero-wine". Speaking of which if you've heard that and you come for Camila in Never Be the Same you are sexist.
 
**CarlieScion** (4): there's never any reason for a song to be EIGHT minutes long
 
**hikkaru** (4): Aggressively long songs make me want to die so this album is going to be an absolute joy for me to rate. Sorry JT stans

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): it's fine but soooo slow and boring and long, stopped four min in

#This is the one

**1998tweety** (10): Ed is a master when it comes to making emotional acoustic guitar ballads. Honestly this sounds more like an album closer than an album opener, but it was so good so I'm pretty excited.
 
**OriginalKappa** (9): I didn't like this the first time I heard it but just as I was about to listen to this album again for this rate I went through my first breakup and it hit really hard. Also I think I'm friends with the person this song might be about lol
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): very beautiful, like all the other Ed ballads you guys are going to destroy in this rate.
 
**twat\_brained** (8.5): I never liked the lick at the start of the song but that lengthy falsetto before the final chorus is impressive now that I revisit it after all this time. A sweet song and really what I needed to hear right now.
 
**hikkaru** (8): this is cute!
 
**kappyko** (8): Surprisingly poignant lyrics and treated with a gentle subtlety that works for this kind of romantic sentiment.
 
**radiofan15** (7.5): Nice transition between + and X
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I do like simple acoustic Sheeran.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7): not a huge fan of ed's falsetto but this is sweet

**selegend** (6): cute

**CarlieScion** (6): the vocals on this sounds very. hallow?
 
**Raykel** (6): His falsetto sounds off here for some reason
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): It's a nice song but it's not a great way to start off this album in my opinion. Its biggest flaw is that it just isn't interesting. And it's frustrating because I know Ed can be interesting and fun.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (2.5): this is weirdly generic like some indie dude who lives in my apartment building could‚Äôve written this. the lyrics seriously aren‚Äôt that deep people

**penguin** (10): May be my favorite Bruno Mars song, honestly. It‚Äôs pining for nostalgia but it does it quite well, reaching ethereality in that holy chorus. It‚Äôs almost too good to be an opener, as it feels more like a closing statement than a preparation of what‚Äôs to come.

**radiofan15** (6): What is this Just the Way You Are + Marry You mashup? it already sounded outdated in 2012, don't know why he put it as the album opener
 
**tapdancingpig** (6): He sounds really good on this, but... I‚Äôm sorry, calling people ‚Äúyoung‚Äù when you‚Äôre implying that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre into them doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore.
 
**kappyko** (5): You can INSTANTLY tell this was produced by the same guy behind The Neighbourhood and Lana Del Rey from that initial tinny percussion sound and the distant echo of recorded screams. Luckily, this isn't nearly as muddy as *I Love You.*'s alt rock; unluckily, it's not nearly as powerful or cool as a Lana track circa *Born to Die*.
 
**J\_Toe** (4): hmmm... nah
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (3.5): This is the first time I have ever heard this song and it makes me want to punch myself in the throat.

**penguin** (5): Probably the weakest track on the album, as it just falls short of the energy it‚Äôs trying to capture. The painful lyrics don‚Äôt help much (I can‚Äôt take him seriously talking about a ‚Äúgold-digging bitch‚Äù) and the production just feels like a lesser version of some of the earlier tracks on the record.

**penguin** (7): This is the wedding song. I really didn‚Äôt like this song at all because it was just sooooo cheesy and on-the-nose. But, after listening to it more recently, I‚Äôve realized it achieves what it sets out to achieve quite well. It‚Äôs not deep, it‚Äôs not profound, and it‚Äôs not complex. And that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs a light sway, an intimate kiss. It is what it is. I just wish the instrumentation was a bit more effective, more stripped down or bombastic. The guitar just kinda is there and I wonder what this song would sound like with James Blake on the keys or John Mayer on the guitar. So, I don‚Äôt hate it anymore, but I still think it could be a bit more than just the wedding song.

FROG: It‚Äôs an excuse to go to the U.K. But, I have to convince Ed Sheeran to collaborate with fucking ZARA LARSSON?

PENGUIN: Why wasn‚Äôt it a better artist?

FROG: Fuck if I know. But I‚Äôm calling you so you can help.

PENGUIN: (SHOOK) Ex.. excuse me?

FROG: (SIGHS) Yes, you already have a plane ticket. I also pretended to be you and called into your job, so that isn‚Äôt an issue.

(UNDER HIS BREATH) Oh yeah, I may have also gotten youfiredfromyourjobsorry.

#Straight

**1998tweety** (10): Even though Photograph got my 11, TOL was a runner up for sure. An amazing iconic love song that'll live on as one of Ed's best, the song captures the bittersweet feelings of first falling in love with someone and knowing they're the one, to then growing old with them. It's cliche but it's the perfect wedding song.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): A classic
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ok I'm expecting this to get a bunch of 0s (I hope I'm wrong [**Host‚Äôs note:** You are.]), but the matter of the fact is that this is already a modern classic and literally nothing or no one can change my mind.
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): not my usual type of song but beautifully constructed
 
**ExtraEater** (9.5): i see what he's going for, and it honestly really works
 
**kappyko** (9.5): I wish this song was titled "Evergreen". It has a flightiness to it that I really find endearing.
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): Annoying but taking all of the overplaying it's actually cute
 
**twat\_brained** (9): I've always loved this song, and I was really proud of Ed when this got like super big between 2014 and 2015. I don't think it should've won a Grammy for Song of the Year over Uptown Funk, though.
 
**OriginalKappa** (8): If this song goes out in the first day its officially heterophobia

#Gay
 
**skargardin** (8): Good god am I sick of this song.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I kind of wanted to give this a higher score, but... what happens after she turns 70?
 
**unovachamp** (4): Even as an Ed fan, this song is aggressively boring and all my points are for that nice prechorus
 
**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): perfect is the much better "first dance at wedding" song. this never really picks up and the production is very repetitive. also the lyrics are kinda trash...like 70 is kinda early to expect to die bro
 
**hikkaru** (1): the theme song to my big fat straight white wedding is such a snoozer
 
**rslashpoopheads** (0): his singing here sounds like a goat whining

#Of legal age

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Really love the production on this. This feels like a highway driving song.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): this could've been a single, i think it has a nighttime vibe that stands out in Bruno's discog
 
**twat\_brained** (8.5): Alright, I like the '80s vibe Bruno's got going on here; reminds me of Michael Jackson in a way.
 
**1998tweety** (8): This is atmospheric (I used this as a metric to score songs way too much without properly defining what it means), but also feels a bit forgettable when put next to the other songs on this album.

#Underage

**ExtraEater** (10): a real groove. surprised to find out it wasn't released as a single. a surprise standout non-single to say the least

**kappyko** (8.5): What the fuck this intro sounds like '90s alternative rock mixed with "Beat It" synths? The synths are woozy as hell? What the fuck? I'm so CONFUSED hold on... this isn't as good as the intro had me prepared for but I'll be damned if it isn't the most pleasant surprise I've been waiting for in this rate I guess "Treasure" wasn't that novel a realization for Mr. Mars after all

**penguin** (10): This song is a lot more influential than people give it credit for. Bieber is perfect for this vocal chopping explosion, and Diplo and Skrillex transformed an early demo of a piano ballad called ‚ÄúThe Most‚Äù into a worldwide EDM smash. The drop is honestly iconic, and paved way for imposters to flood the dance/pop scene. But, this is the original and as time and time proved again, Skrillex and Diplo should never be counted out.  
 
**frog** (10):

_Fuck it,_ THINKS THE [TATTOO CLERK]. _I‚Äôve refused enough tattoos in my life. I‚Äôll just say that I don‚Äôt have the skill for it._

TATTOO CLERK: (PENSIVELY) Listen..

POO: (VISIBLY SAD) What‚Äôs the problem?

TATTOO CLERK: I‚Äôm just not artistic enough to capture the.. (TRYING TO PLEASE) beauty of poo‚Äôs face on your guys‚Äô bodies.

FROG: :(

PENGUIN: (SIGHING) I honestly don‚Äôt think anyone else will do a tramp stamp of a face.

TATTOO CLERK: Actually, I have a recommendation.

WHILE THE [TATTOO CLERK] FINISHES THEIR TASK OF GETTING THE GUESTS TO ANOTHER TATTOO PARLOR, [POO] HAS OTHER PLANS.

#üêã

**1998tweety** (10): His redemption song, a big fat 10
 
**radiofan15** (10): Thank you to Daddy Diplo and Skrillex for breaking the monotony of this boring-ass album with this BOP
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): this song is all skrillex and jack and would‚Äôve been good even without justin that‚Äôs all i got to say
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): please release more music together @ Skrillex & Diplo
 
**twat\_brained** (8.5): I've always liked this; I remember being really glad to hear this when I was 16 because it was Justin's first song in what felt like forever.

#Sea World supporters
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): It‚Äôs good but doesn‚Äôt stand out a ton.
 
**OriginalKappa** (8): This is great but its super out of place on this album.
 
**poppinmmolly** (7): I hate the drop
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.5): I think this song would have been better if Skrillex reworked it and brought it to From First to Last. Song could do with some Sonny Moore vocals on top of it.
 
**hikkaru** (4): so annoying omg
 
**rslashpoopheads** (2): oof
 
**JunkyGS** (1.5): Production did not age well and I do not like Justins vocals on it. A song about the other person showing up to help him after he was always there for them. Well after listening to the other songs here I doubt that.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (0): I forgot how grating that "drop" is
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (0): repetitive, boring, and production is shrill and annoying

#Thanks kappy!

**kappyko** (7): Q: What's Justin Bieber's favorite fruits? A: He kinda likes watermelons, but he likes honeydew the most! Anyways the chorus lost most of its mystique but it's still one of the most significant pop songs of the decade so like whatever

**penguin** (7): Tinashe and Drake be damned, here‚Äôs another song called Company. And this one is also good, a bit danceable, a bit Uber radio-core. 
 
**frog** (8):

SUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CLICK OFF SCREEN.

POO: (ANGRILY) You better be doing these fucking tattoos.

[FROG, PENGUIN] AND THE [TATTOO CLERK] TURN TO SEE [POO] HAS PULLED A GUN ON THEM.

TATTOO CLERK: (CONFUSED) The fuck?

[FROG, PENGUIN] ARE SHELL SHOCKED IN THE CORNER. THE [TATTOO CLERK] TRIES STEPPING TOWARDS [POO] TO DIFFUSE THE SITUATION BUT IT ONLY RESULTS IN [POO] POINTING THE GUN TOWARDS THEM.

POO: (PISSED) You better stop this, you kink shaming bitch.

TATTOO CLERK: (COMPLETELY LOST) I.. excuse me?

#Kept company

**kappyko** (10): This might actually be my 11. EDIT: no Has he ever sounded so damn POTENT before? Chiptune melodies? This is the only song so far that has been trying to sound like a BOP. The deep synths and house beat swagger along brushing EVERYTHING past it. This is so good.
 
**selegend** (10): that BEAT whew
 
**strawberryswing1** (10): wtf this is a bop
 
**twat\_brained** (10): Justin sounds fantastic here! And the instrumental is excellent to boot. My definite favorite of the first half of the album.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): was this bloodpop produced cause it‚Äôs fresh
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): banger.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): robbed from being a hit! my favorite on the album
 
**1998tweety** (8): Tinashe kind of totally outsold but this is still nice
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): This is a little more restrained than I usually like, and it‚Äôs a little underwritten, but fuck it, THIS PRODUCTION BOPS!
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): nice drop
 
**skargardin** (7): cute lil tune

#Is lonely
 
**radiofan15** (5): This is more generic than boring so I guess it's not that bad
