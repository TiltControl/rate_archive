**sufjancaesar** (8): This is very pleasing to the ear but also goes nowhere tbh. Lowkey a decent twerk bop though

**steelstepladder** (8): This never escaped the bottom. Idk what this particular interlude did to draw such ire from you guys over the others but it certainly did something.

---

# Never makes promises


**akanewasright** (9): This makes me feel like being backstage doing choral bits in a show

**nt96** (8): Me convincing myself that this isn't immune to Interludephobia to save the heartache

**skargardin** (8): simple, yet effective

**TiltControls** (7.5): Okay I promise

**afs** (7): oh well I guess these interludes are better than the Tyler ones

# Makes promises

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): nah

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): this sounds like old-fashioned medieval music to me that i would expect to hear in castle

**bigbigbee** (6.5): People who don’t like the interludes on this album clearly don’t listen to the Wicked soundtrack all the way through, even the kind of shitty songs. You’re missing out!

**camerinian** (6.5): this would have been so good if it was literally just the choir left to do their thing, rather than throwing all the fades and phaser effects over their brilliant work

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is a musical number but like one i’d fast forward in the bootleg

**runaway3212** (6): this is an interlude who cares

**modulum83** (5.5): don't mind this one, it's cute

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): the unnecessary interlude

**ignitethephoenix** (5): the shrieky lady kind of kills this in a bad way

**iniekcja\_** (5): I mean

**MrMoodle** (5): man these interludes are gonna fucking tank lol

**RandomHypnotica** (5): ok i can be interludephobic here this is boring af

**IIIHenryIII** (4): meh (negative)

**Neighbourly** (4): really don't like this in context of the album

**BeauMeringue212** (3): me when I flake on people

**welcome2thejam** (2): Promise me you'll never make an interlude like this again

**SmileAndTears** (1): Tanking this one idc idc. This girl has too many interludes i'm TIRED. Like, why did she include this? WHAT WAS THE REASON? WHAT WAS THE REASON?

**just\_thonking** (0): This album has made me interludephobic and that's coming from someone who gave Tina Taught Me a 9

**shipperondeck** (0): can someone please tell me what that effect is at the end? i hear it a lot in 80s (and sometimes modern) music and i really like it. kinda sounds like a plane taking off?

**sufjancaesar** (8): Really fuck with the backing instrumentals and vocals here but I’m just glad a SIMBI interlude wasn’t out first skfjdjs edit: I wrote this comment right before we added the final ballot which meant that a SIMBI interlude was, indeed, out first :woeis:

**steelstepladder** (4): Aren't you glad I had us rate the interludes?

# W + BLESSED

**frogaranaman** (10): I want this to do better than a legit song for the memes

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): i can't unnassociate blessed with the #blessed line from 24K Magic

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): literally can’t relate to a single line of this

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): genuinely a great interlude, love tyler's humour

**Stryxen** (7): this is the better interlude by far it’s just. Cool. and interesting

**bbfan132** (6.5): i don’t know what to give this lol, i like the backing music

# L + CURSED

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): very ready to see whatever movie tyler might make in the future

**afs** (6): we just had an interlude bestie

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i mean good for him (?)

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): life updates! (i'm writing a show!? i'm in a movie!?)

**TiltControls** (6): OPULENCE

**akanewasright** (5): fuck you tyler, I’m depressed and need cash

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): I could do without this interlude, though

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I get why this is here I guess

**IIIHenryIII** (5): sounds nice

**shipperondeck** (5): the only flaw is my hair wont fucking grow LMAOOO

**2dina3dworld** (4): is this slam poetry

**BeauMeringue212** (4): This commercial was brought to you by GolfWang™

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): im getting real tired of all the barely songs on this album

**camerinian** (2): don't mind me, just doing my bit for the internalized tall poppy syndrome

**fadedblue09** (2): A spoken word interlude that somehow manages to drag. Would've been bearable without the instrumental

**Neighbourly** (2): thought we were done with skits in general. at least he put some music in the back

**runaway3212** (2): I hope interludephobia strikes this first

**sufjancaesar** (5): This interlude feels pointless imo. Musically, it’s not very different from the song it introduces and the only thing it offers is around 2-4 lines of text

**steelstepladder** (6): Interlude number two is out! Also never escaped the bottom five, also don't have much to say about this.

---

# LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA


**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): fuck interludephobia this is good

**skargardin** (9): This is a cool respite after the well of emotions from the previous song, and it flows well into Pt. 2 obviously

**akanewasright** (8): I gave this a 10 initially, and then I remembered Tina Taught Me

**afs** (7): I had a double take to make sure I didn't forget a CMIYGL track

**Awkward\_King** (7): i think i would like this more if it were combined with part 2, in one track altogether, but also i appreciate it being done like this bc it makes pt 2 much easier to listen to

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): the good interlude

**camerinian** (7): like yeah ok cool sample guys, why didn’t you just put these two parts together

**CrimsonROSET** (7): grrrrrr these interludes are gonna lower my average so much i hate it here

**plastichaxan** (7): “do i want to tank interludes cause i never know how to rate them or do i just give them ok scores so my average isn’t brought down that much” i asked this when i rated it on indieheads and i have not figured it out

**Roxieloxie** (7): pretty good for an interlude song!

**uberpigeon** (7): lalalala

**welcome2thejam** (7): The kids singing is still such a good hook I'm willing to give even this a good score

# NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH

**bbfan132** (6.5): an interlude!

**BeauMeringue212** (6): dunno if part 1 was needed tbh

**runaway3212** (6): this is an interlude who cares

**TiltControls** (6): La la la la (x25)

**UselessTacooo** (6): I can't really give this any higher of a score

**seanderlust** (5.8): simz can have a slightly annoying sample, as a treat

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this not transitioning to the next song and just repeating in the beginning of the actual song makes this kind of pointless

**modulum83** (5): choir is great but i ain't having this BBC One drama ass voiceover

**Neighbourly** (5): I'll allow it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): uh oh sisters i’m getting interludephobia again

**bigbigbee** (4.5): This isn’t interludephobia, I liked a lot of the interludes, just not this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I thought it was Tyler, The Creator for a second and I had a heart attack thinking I was trapped in *Call Me If You Get Lost* again

**shipperondeck** (3): kinda wish it segued into pt 2 smoothly. im surprised we're rating all the interludes tbh. but there's some musicality here so it gets a couple points for that

**IIIHenryIII** (1): guess I'm interludephobic now

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): I could go on about why I love SIMBI interludes. Are they corny? Sure, but I think that’s the point? There’s something to be said about using voices and aesthetics typically exclusive to whiteness to speak on black womanhood and her struggles. It feels like Simz creates her own black fairytales with a childlike wonder, and the production/build-up is so stellar and unique

**steelstepladder** (8): I like the story book nature but I can't blame people if they are turned off of this interlude. It never escaped the bottom 5 and that's where it will stay

---

# Doesn’t talk much (introvert)

**bbfan132** (10): this is a stunning interlude wow

**bigbigbee** (10): People who don’t like the interludes on this album clearly don’t listen to Mozart’s Magic Fantasy - A Journey Through ‘The Magic Flute’ by CLASSICAL KIDS on cassette tape. You’re missing out!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Gorgeous track, love the theatricality and world building

**RandomHypnotica** (10): that accent... <3

**skargardin** (10): No but I love this soundscape, ridiculously good for an interlude, if this is considered overscoring then so be it

**seanderlust** (9.3): everything on this interlude works so well. the narrator's voice is so soothing and the choir at the end sounds amazing

**you2009** (8.5): I don't respect british people but this is a good counterargument

**CrimsonROSET** (8): camp

**iniekcja\_** (8): hope the tea was good

**runaway3212** (8): this is an interlude who cares

**TiltControls** (8): This sounds like it was taken from a Disney movie the second before the musical number kicks in (and then the musical number question)

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): purr

**afs** (7.5): least British person

**team\_kockroach** (7.3): not sure I understand its placement on the tracklist. Won’t complain though lol

**akanewasright** (7): This is deeply camp and I can’t help but be a little charmed

**ignitethephoenix** (7): is she British I can’t tell

**IIIHenryIII** (7): oh, I kinda like this

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): so when are they making the SIMBI movie

**Stryxen** (7): TEA

# Likes to be entertained (extrovert)

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): every comment I could think of for this felt insufferable so I’m just going to leave it like this

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): the other alright interlude

**Neighbourly** (6): better than the others and not a pace killer. don't like the outro, wish it ended before that

**SmileAndTears** (6): ...i don't like tea, sorry. (also is it just me or does this sound like it could play in super mario galaxy? no? just me? okay)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): its giving broadway musical dramatic finale song

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): disney animated movie type beat

**Awkward\_King** (5): i do think this one is immensely camp

**ImADudeDuh** (5): 21 Savage?

**shipperondeck** (5): cool title and a whole cinematic experience, however i still hate white women especially if they're british so.

**welcome2thejam** (5): And that's the tea! (Am I using it right?)

**camerinian** (4): look I get that going straight from I See You to Rollin Stone would be a huge mood whiplash but there had to be better ways they could have transitioned than this obnoxious fake Disney audiobook nonsense. The choral swell at the end is neat but it’s dragged down by everything that precedes it

**just\_thonking** (3.5): cringe

**whydideveribother** (3): I wish I understood this better, but I just don't like this.

**BeauMeringue212** (2): my tea's gone cold

**modulum83** (1): theater kids were a fucking mistake

**fadedblue09** (0): absolutely obnoxious from start to finish

**MrMoodle** (0): my skin is crawling i just hate the british so fucking much

**sufjancaesar** (7): This is charming but I will never forgive y’all for letting it place higher than some SIMBI interludes

**steelstepladder** (10): Wow that momma really can talk

---

# "Get 'em, mom"

**Awkward\_King** (10): go get your BITCH ASS MOMMA

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): there's nothing better than listening to Tyler's mother talk about how she beat up several children. this is not sarcasm btw I think this interlude is incredibly funny

**cremeebrulee** (10): we got solange’s mom to day 3 so i expect the same outcome here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Secret bonus rate is Tyler’s Mom vs Frank Ocean’s mom

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): she can have a little child abuse… as a treat…

**nt96** (10): So true. All I gotta say.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she kinda spilled

**runaway3212** (10): honestly this is bad but im kinda obsessed with her

**SmileAndTears** (10): 💀💀💀 kind of living for this

**akanewasright** (9): 0 vs 11 rate of this mom and the mom from Be Yourself, GO

**TiltControls** (8.5): Another interlude-type track, but it's memorable and leads perfectly into RISE

**team\_kockroach** (8.1): the rest of y’all will low-ball this but it’s nice to have some sincere optimism after that 10-minute song

**bbfan132** (8): this interlude <3

**CrimsonROSET** (8): whoop his ass

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): yes tyler's mom get their ass!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Honestly hope this outlasts at least one actual song

**you2009** (7.7): euros? dollars? yens?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): so this is where Tyler got his personality from 💀 a queen

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I like this but I don't support some of the things his momma said, especially the part about beating other kids

**just\_thonking** (7): better than SIMBI's interludes at least

**Roxieloxie** (7): shes just like my mom fr

**whydideveribother** (7): Cute

**afs** (6.5): stan main pop girl interludes

# "No, don't do it"

**modulum83** (6): discount blonde interlude

**seanderlust** (6): this deserves to be day three as the evil inversion of tina taught me

**Stryxen** (5.7): cute

**camerinian** (5.5): uhm

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): worst interlude in the rate tbh

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): Basically for the same reasons as ‘The Rapper That Came To Tea’ but I love this so much. It feels so childlike and comforting with some amazing orchestral instrumentation as always

**steelstepladder** (7.5): One more interlude left! The garden sounds gorgeous but interludephobia knows no bounds. Great in the context of the album, but rates know no mercy

---

# Princess Diana stans


**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok we're back to pretty interludes

**team\_kockroach** (9.6): this feels like Princess Diana giving me a hug. r/popheads, DON’T YOU DARE DAY 1 THIS.

**seanderlust** (9.5): I have played too many kingdom hearts games to pretend im above this Disney interlude

**MrMoodle** (9): ok this one’s pretty

**skargardin** (9): "Water your seeds, give your garden the love it needs", I just simply LOVE this line and once again, Inflo's production must be praised

**apatel27** (8): People might hate on the interludes but from an album perspective this wraps up the journey pretty well

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Wish this had more of a musical element but I’m living for these interludes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): honestly i dont know why my rating for this one is so high either! but i know a good interlude when i hear it and this is really fucking good

**afs** (7.5): THE END OF THE INTERLUDES YASS

**Awkward\_King** (7): the instrumental of this song sounds like the shrek soundtrack what in the emma corrinussy

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): the other good interlude

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is cute but goes on for way too long like most of these interludes

**Neighbourly** (7): kinda into this one

**SmileAndTears** (7): pretty

**camerinian** (6.5): this is way better than the last interlude mostly because the narration is a lot more down to earth and a lot less “OH hello boys and girls”

# Queen Elizabeth II stans

**TiltControls** (6.5): back in interlude pre-musical land

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): actually a really funny rate idea would be this album and caprisongs just for the amount of spoken interludes that we would have to listen through

**akanewasright** (6): this one kinda drags the pace of the album down, but I do appreciate the setup for the last tracks

**runaway3212** (6): this is an interlude who cares

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I’m out of things to compare the interludes to but this is nice

**IIIHenryIII** (4): guess I'm interludephobic again

**modulum83** (3): And remember, Simbi: Live. Laugh. And most importantly, Love.

**shipperondeck** (1): sorry i can't with that humble pie line (shoutout to my dad for giving me the humble pie talk when i was 11)

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): The production on this is so fucking lush and I’ve looped it simply cause of that. I think the chorus is quite beautiful too. Overall, a charming victory lap of a closer which is severely marred by the r-slur!

**steelstepladder** (8): The outro of CMIYGL, here's a song that would have done better if Tyler wasn't an idiot and said a word he really shouldn't have.

---

# Aw damn, it’s over

**Neighbourly** (9): strong closer nice raps on topic

**shipperondeck** (9): WE'RE GOING ON A SAFARI BITCH! CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST BITCH!!!

**team\_kockroach** (8.7): VERY strange transition from Wilshire. Maybe it’ll make more sense live.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): "and like that, we gone" is the best closing line in this rate actually

**frogaranaman** (8): entering my problematic era by giving this song a good score

**modulum83** (8): tyler's verse is completely forgettable but that instrumental is so smooth

**UselessTacooo** (8): slay closer

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): it's a fine closer but not amazing

**Stryxen** (7): i’m not sure how convinced i am with this as a FINALE but it’s just a good song

# Thank god it’s over

**afs** (6.5): was that the r slur

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): im more of a chrome type of girl

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i don’t think i will

**IIIHenryIII** (6): safari by j balvin is superior, go stream it

**camerinian** (5): man Wilshire would have been such a good closer, why did they need to tack this on

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): this *should* feel triumphant but honestly at the end of the album it just sounds like soup… the UPN reference is cute though!

**seanderlust** (5): this would be a 10 if it weren't for the r-slur...tyler, man....

**akanewasright** (3.5): not the slur

**DefaultPophead** (3): What a mixed bag of an album, and not in a good way. Glad it's over.

**Roxieloxie** (3): girl

**Awkward\_King** (2): this song is fine i cant lie. i do like the wolf shoutout tho

**runaway3212** (1): not the r-slur

**TiltControls** (0): I'm sorry cause this is dumb, but I'm just so distracted by the backing track sounding like a pitch-adjusted version of the John Cena theme

But yeah so far it's just simply interludephobia, I expect Simz will still dominate the top of this rate

# ASCENDING


**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Is this a Steven Universe thing? My score is jumping

**MrMoodle** (10): wait was that the wii fit lady

**nt96** (10): I opened my closet door while this was playing and suddenly I gained access to Narnia! Her power!!

**plastichaxan** (10): im sorry but this makes me ascend and her voice is so soothing it really makes me want to try being the greatest version of myself

**RandomHypnotica** (10): uncuh gaaaaams

**skargardin** (10): no but this hits me so hard

**CrimsonROSET** (9): best interlude dont at me

**TiltControls** (9): the way this interlude is longer and better than most of Tyler's tracks

**you2009** (9): suites within suites

**bigbigbee** (8.5): People who don’t like the interludes on this album clearly don’t listen to movie soundtracks for fun. You’re missing out!

**fadedblue09** (8): Enchanting instrumental, feels like lifted from a film

**iniekcja\_** (8): Julia Fox of the gems were cut

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): this sounds like a movie scene

**shipperondeck** (8): literally don't care that this is an interlude. this is beautiful. simbi in wonderland!!

**Stryxen** (8): tea

**thedoctordances1940** (8): gorgeous interude

**team\_kockroach** (7.7): the sheer audacity to have a 3 minute interlude. At least it’s really good, and the themes on the album take a noticeable turn afterwards.

**afs** (7.5): I wonder how many people give low scores when they see the word interlude

**frogaranaman** (7): cue unfunny Uncut Gems comment

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is quite nice actually

**Roxieloxie** (7): pretty good for an interlude song [2]

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): is this christmas music

# DESCENDING

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): this is totally the part of the movie when the MC’s subconscious is trying to wake them up right before the third act lmao

**seanderlust** (6.5): okay i hate almost everything about the intro and outro to this interlude but the actual conversation that happens is very nice

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I was on board until I started hearing math, then she lost me

**akanewasright** (6): is this Steven Universe????

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): the alright interlude

**BeauMeringue212** (6): I do like the recurring Alice in Wonderland motif, it makes the album feel like a journey. But they're often clunky and a bit of a drag on repeated listens

**camerinian** (6): this is less than the sum of its parts, but only cos there are so many parts and i can’t be fucked summing up all the different parts of this interlude

**runaway3212** (6): this is an interlude who cares

**welcome2thejam** (6): Put me down for 15 minutes please

**just\_thonking** (4): The fact that we just had an interlude one song ago.. the fact that this interlude is 3 minutes long.. so silly

**Neighbourly** (4): think we're killing the pacing here with a second one. Interesting as a standalone.

**modulum83** (1): why am i here. why am i doing this to myself.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this feels less like a song and more like I’m listening to a movie dream sequence scene

**sufjancaesar** (6): Nothing really happens, it’s a mood builder sort of track but I think Tyler could’ve set the luxurious tone way better. When you look at how much stronger the other openers in the rate are (yet Tyler’s album is the most braggadocious), this falls flat. That pretty as fuck outro carries this for me!

**steelstepladder** (7): And now for the opener of the album! The opener to CMIYGL is less of a full song and more of an intro to ease you into the sound of the album. It does it's job well, but we can't be too surprised it doesn't have the highest marks in the world for the rate.

---

# My skin soak up the sun

**seanderlust** (9.3): I just love that this album wastes no time in soaking the listener in luxury and subtly introduces the theme of travel in a way that you don't even really catch until a second listen-through. this beat just feels opulent

**Awkward\_King** (9): this is a great intro, it sets the mood brilliantly and i love tyler and drama's dynamic

**bbfan132** (9): just an intro but i still love it

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): as in THAT bigbigbee??

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): such an underrated intro tbh, dj drama's parts are great

**you2009** (8.5): almost rings horrorcore

**frogaranaman** (8): I was, in fact, not ready

**modulum83** (8): i like to imagine that DJ Drama just talks exclusively in adlibs in real life too

**Neighbourly** (8): very strong opener, nice verse and good length

**shipperondeck** (7.8): shoutout to bassoons

**afs** (7.5): oh that ended fast, might have helped its score

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): a short and laid back intro, but I still love the lyrical bent here, the way Tyler raps on this album is fantastic and this sets the scene well, making me want more (and luckily there’s more)

**akanewasright** (7): If that’s a clarinet there… I kinda stan

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh god are people going to ask if this is disco

**Roxieloxie** (7): the end of this song, wheres the super spreader gif

**UselessTacooo** (7): it’s a fine way to open an album

# ain't shakin' hands with you bums

**team\_kockroach** (6.6): the A-Bb-A, A-B♮-A beat seriously annoys me - and the verse is 32 bars of nothing important

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): this feels like I'm waiting in the airport for my flight to Hawaii

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): woodwind section hard carries this one

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): nice intro

**Stryxen** (6.5): it’s good!

**camerinian** (6): man this is kinda mid as an opener, it only gets interesting when the actual structured song part ends

**runaway3212** (6): forgot this album is kinda meh

**welcome2thejam** (6): "I hope you been spending your time wisely" I can guarantee you that I haven't

**TiltControls** (4): It's here. Though I always enjoy a good title shout out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): oh man i’m gonna have to write a paragraph explaining this one aren’t i…look i don’t have a problem with intros on albums that set the tone, as long as they have some sort of substance to them to where you can actually listen to them outside of the context of “this is the first song on the album”. yankee and the brave and on the move! are both great examples of songs that work as intros while also having enough artistic merit to where you still want to listen to them occasionally even outside of an album context. but this? there’s nothing in this to come back to. half of this “song” is this an emcee hyping up the album and spoken word, and what actual rapping tyler does on this isn’t special or memorable in any way. for me, a song that flat out boring and unmemorable will always be worse than a song that’s straight up bad, and in a rate with some of the best songs of the past year or so, a song like this is simply inexcusable.

**sufjancaesar** (9): I wasn’t too sure where this would place but I’m disappointed it was so low! I love the beat drop, the chorus and the nostalgic crowd vocal. Doesn’t have the most depth but I think it’s a major feel-good track and that’s enough for me

**steelstepladder** (7.5): While I can't say I'm too surprised this didn't do well, I'm surprised this was the 11th song out. Also the first 11 of the rate going out early. RIP macmillion

# WE GON RUNITUP


**ImADudeDuh** (10): “I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety” brag about it

**you2009** (10): [lies] I ain't never had anxiety!!

**modulum83** (9.2): massive grower, really was made to be a big live show closing song

**shipperondeck** (9.1): tyler closed his show with this song and it was incredible so this song has grown on me a lot. the entire balcony was shaking and ppl were screaming WE GON RUN IT UP truly a religious experience

**Awkward\_King** (9): "treat me nuance like it was a nuisance" is one of the cornier lyrics on the album even if it is great wordplay ajksdkjsa. but also the hook of this song is one of my faves on the album

**CrimsonROSET** (8): traaaaansition

**frogaranaman** (8): this went dummy live

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it's grown on me

**welcome2thejam** (8): There are 35 recognized "We gon run it up" appearances in this song. In low-scoring sports such as hockey, soccer, or baseball, having a score of 35 would absolutely be considered running it up on your opponent. Not necessarily true in American football, when scores over 35 are a semi-regular occurence. And if you score 35 in basketball, you are losing unless you're in grade school or playing in the Big Ten

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): cute

**seanderlust** (7.5): i wasn't really crazy about this one at first but man that chant is an earworm. the number of times i've said "we gon' run it up!! we gon' run it up!!" in my head is a lot. even though i think this song is kind of bleak in the context of buying things to fill a void when you look at it in the album's context, it still bops so when i'm shopping i have to pretend i do not see the larger meaning

**TiltControls** (7.5): I love the chorus, but I don't know if the verses live up to it enough

**team\_kockroach** (7.4): wish they didn’t beat the “We gon’ run it up” refrain into the ground. Also what’s Teezo doing that DJ Drama couldn’t?

**afs** (7): runinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

# ARE WE??

**Stryxen** (6.5): tyler is lucky he’s ridiculously talented because this hook is :pls:

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): Teezo Touchdown is such a funny, good rap name. would be better if a feature like him had more of a presence on the song though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): haha wow nice build up tyler when does the song actually start

**UselessTacooo** (5): really forgettable

**runaway3212** (3): okay after I called him out I have not heard CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST once. I bullied Tyler so hard he stopped saying stupid stuff.

**sufjancaesar** (8): I like this ngl…it has a dystopic, cyberpunk feel and the beat is pretty great. It just happens to be one of the less memorable ones and doesn’t hit as hard as most other RTJ4 tracks imo

**steelstepladder** (8): Now for the first RTJ song out which is probably the worst RTJ song on the album. Still a fantastic albeit straightforward hip hop song although didn't stand out enough for it to get any further than day 1

---

# Never looked back


**iniekcja\_** (10): this has a bit of that clipping vibe to it

**MrMoodle** (10): synthpop icons carly rae who

**camerinian** (9.5): God I wish I didn't procrastinate and could have done the bonus rate. This is maybe the closest to Clipping that the proper rate gets and I'm so into it

**team\_kockroach** (8.7): the ghostly cooing throughout the instrumental is incredible. I think clipping. would murder this beat too.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): super villain music

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): the beat is so filthy but the chorus I wish did more

**afs** (8): I malfunctioned and thought uncle luke was a reference to... him

**Neighbourly** (8): looks average compared to the other songs lol

**you2009** (8): mario ghost house music

**shipperondeck** (7.9): this is good but it comes after a ton of INSANE tracks so the score kinda suffers for that

**Stryxen** (7.6): well no looking back >>> but also no looking back is just that good

# Looked back

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): yeah this is my least favourite track on the album, it's still good but a little underwhelming

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the video is camp

**frogaranaman** (7): thought my microwave was done for a sec there

**welcome2thejam** (7): Did RTJ and Genesis leave Sodom & Gomorrah together, cause they're both very insistent that we don't look back

**modulum83** (6.7): it's giving filler

**TiltControls** (6.5): a good rule for horror movie protagonists

**skargardin** (6): this doesn't quite hit the same heights as the rest of the album for me, maybe I just need more time with it idk

**runaway3212** (5): don't tell me what to do

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this one kinda flopped sorry rtj

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): well… they had to have at least one bad song on the album, right?

**UselessTacooo** (4): how did we go from two perfect songs, to this…

**sufjancaesar** (5): I’ve always wanted to appreciate this for the storytelling aspect but I just can’t get into it. Look at Kendrick on ‘Sing About Me, I’m Dying Of Thirst’ or Joey Bada$$ on ‘Third Eye Shit’, long ass tracks can be interpolated with a hook that makes them more digestible and that would’ve helped here

**steelstepladder** (8.5): The straighter of the two long Tyler songs comes day one, no surprise here. The long songphobia really hurts this one because it's not bad! The only issue is there's another 8+ minute song that is better on the same album which is gayer, so we unfortunately can't be too surprised in an arguble premature exit.

---

# I love reading


**akanewasright** (10): I really appreciate the level of storytelling here, basically filling in the gaps of the plot he’d been taking us through the entire album

**Awkward\_King** (10): i know this is going to be day 1, for being so long and basically being a monologue, ill be happy if it escapes the bottom 5, but i just think it's such a unique format for a song, and tyler's storytelling is masterful.

**cremeebrulee** (10): FUCK!!!!! FUCK!!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): I don't know if it's because my last relationship was a genuine mess, because I've dealt with so many closeted men in my love life, because I stuck at relationships, or a combination of the three but this song hits HARD

**TiltControls** (10): Unlike the other long track, I actually thought this really used its run time well. Sounds good, tells a story - all comes together amazingly

**you2009** (9.5): "I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake" T___T

**modulum83** (9.3): me after like 3 drinks

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh wow

**seanderlust** (9): i fear this will be tanked for being long and recorded on a shitty mic so the sound quality sucks. i get it but it still hurts!!! i think he said this was his second take? and they pretty much just kept it. i think that just adds to the rawness of the track - like this feels like him spilling tea on himself and the love interest. while i don't return to it often, it gets high marks from me for its honesty

**SmileAndTears** (9): the long songs on this album are lowkey the best

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): one point for each minute of the runtime

**bbfan132** (8.5): v pleasant but not a standout to me

**afs** (8): not many people can storytell through rapping on the same beat for 8 minutes straight, respect

**shipperondeck** (8): ok i know it's one note but it's also vibes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): thought my headphones were breaking the entire time listening to this and im listening to this on april 1st so im gonna consider this tyler playing an april fool’s joke on me

**uberpigeon** (8): ok i actually liked this tyler is a great storyteller

**welcome2thejam** (8): Definitely works best in album context, where it's a clear drop of the opulence and pretense and interjections of the rest of the album

# I ain't reading all that. I'm happy for u tho. Or sorry that happened.

**DefaultPophead** (7): Almost great. I just wish Tyler would trim the fat sometimes...

**Neighbourly** (7): but we have sing about me at home... Lacks depth.

**Roxieloxie** (7): tyler im begging you just move the mic like 2 inches away from your lips

**runaway3212** (7): This is his impossible soul and I was kinda w/e on that too

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): i get what he's going for here but i just don't think he really sticks the landing, just drags on for me

**TragicKingdom1** (6): too long

**team\_kockroach** (5.9): this is gonna be the most controversial song in the rate, I guess. I’m sorry, but the monotone performances made me bored 3 minutes in. At least All Too Well 10 Minute Version had some instrumental variation

**IIIHenryIII** (5): well, this one's too monotonous to be this long, where the transitions at???

**plastichaxan** (5): i was so bored this was so long and for what

**BeauMeringue212** (4): I feel bad scoring this so low bit earnest vulnerable Tyler just doesn't resonate with me, and this is 8 and a half minutes of that so...

**fadedblue09** (4): feels like I wasted my time sorry

**ImADudeDuh** (4): yes I want to like this song but I legitimately can not concentrate on this and I have the lyrics in front of me

**UselessTacooo** (0): He’s going off but he also just keeps going

**steelstepladder** (8): What could be considered an underperformance, Danny Brown exits day one. While a song that hits more if you've followed his story up to this point, I can't lie and say that it's as good as a lot of songs off of Atrocity Exhibition. That album is a 10/10.

---

# Tryna live their best life

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Do that hiphopheads 2016 rate and give Atrocity Exhibition a bunch of 10s

**throwaway92720392720** (10): My spotify wrapped 2019 was all songs from uknowhatimsayin¿. That should speak for itself

**modulum83** (9.5): joker_dancing.gif

**bbfan132** (8.5): not my favorite by him but still v good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Great sample use. Can't wait to 11 Danny at hiphopheads this month

**team\_kockroach** (7.7): i didn’t expect Danny to flow like this, especially since he kinda has Earl Sweatshirt’s cadence. The hook is strangely underwritten compared to the rest of uknowhatimsayin

**seanderlust** (7.5): so true! give atrocity exhibition all 10s in this month's HHH rate!

**afs** (7): blow out the WHAT

**shipperondeck** (7): maybe not the most unique topic but he delivers it well ofc

# At their lowest…fat, nasty and broke. Career in shambles!

**steelstepladder** (10): IM SO ANGRY!!! A song that was day two for the vast majority of the rate, which got tanked into day one when the last weeks ballots were coming in. People saw the hook as annoying but with how it plays off the piano it bangs so hard. Robbery of the rate imo

**team\_kockroach** (8.3): the instrumental sounds so crisp but the lyricism is…uh…“Life a bitch and the pussy fish”? “I used to love Bruce, but livin' my vida loca”? C’mon Mike.

**you2009** (8.2): I thought this hook was annoying but if you look at it as them mocking french people then it suddenly becomes performance art

**shipperondeck** (8.1): OOOO LA LA AH OUI OUI (x7.5) and then add a little more bc it's good enough for that

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the “oui oui” was actually a foreshadowing of the piss on their shoes line

**UselessTacooo** (8): giant quality boost from the mess of the first song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Killer Mike confirmed for dude who unironically posts Joker memes

**whydideveribother** (8): After hearing the remix, the song feels kind of naked without the lighter noise.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.9): glad my seven years of French are being put to use

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): wait did LOONA rip this off

**nt96** (7.5): Bonjour mademoiselle👋😊, je porte des lunettes de soleil😎, je veux me venger🔪, merci beaucoup, je ÆÛŔĢHk, oui oui baguette🥖, bisous😘

# NON NON MONSIEUR!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): the piss line and the repetitive "ooh la la ah oui oui" hook take some of the enjoyment out of this song but it's solid

**MrMoodle** (7): mr worldwides

**seanderlust** (7): maybe a hot take as an RTJ fan - this one has never sat well with me. not that it's bad, it's just technically a lowlight on an otherwise banger of an album. the sample is great, el-p and mike sound great...i think it's the hook that's grating

**uberpigeon** (7): bonjour mademoiselle je porte des lunettes de soleil je veux me venger merci beaucoup je hurle oui oui baguette bisous

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): I still like this because RTJ kinda just doesn’t make bad music but I enjoy them more over big energy noise-bombs than doing repetitive hooks over respectable old-school boom bap like Premier provides, as legendary and iconic as DJ Premier’s influence is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): pissing on people’s shoes in public is probably someone’s dirty kink

**TiltControls** (6.5): ooh la la la la la la

**camerinian** (6): man what the fuck is this hook

**Stryxen** (6): i LOVE the vocals and i pull my penis out ALL the time

**ignitethephoenix** (5.8): the chorus is serving omelette du fromage

**modulum83** (5): gay RTJ be like ooh la la a weewee

**runaway3212** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB7G-xbU1xc

**fadedblue09** (4.5): the hook is really irritating

**SmileAndTears** (0): that 'ooh la la' refrain has to be one of the most unpleasant refrains i've ever heard

**sufjancaesar** (6): I’m not too sure if I support everything he’s saying but the actual track is an earsore for me. I think it could benefit from a chorus that drives the overall message over in a simpler, catchier way - alongside the deeper verses.

**steelstepladder** (7.5): One of the harder Tyler songs going out day one, here's a song that would probably KILL live. The energy of the song really jumps off the track and bangs harder than pretty much every other song out so far.

---

# Ain't nobody perfect

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I really like the lyrics of this track, especially Tyler calling out white people criticizing him for being silent about BLM on Twitter when he was at several protests

**camerinian** (9.5): I just admire the fact that Tyler hasn’t lost the goddamn audacity

**nt96** (9.5): This is M E N A C I N G

**frogaranaman** (9): Tyler's crusade against white ppl Instagram continues

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): He draws some blood here

**runaway3212** (9): you know what this was really great

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): im noticing a trend in this rate with rappers named genesis being really fucking good

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): he ate here, I think this is his strongest rapping on the album

**shipperondeck** (8.5): THIS FUCKING INTRO >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**modulum83** (8.3): +1 extra point for tyler thirsting over justin bieber

**team\_kockroach** (8.3): aren’t the chords from “Sir Baudelaire” back under Domo’s verse? Anyway the chemistry on this song is amazing

**IIIHenryIII** (8): these songs can't get past an 8???

**jackisboredtoday** (8): It feels fitting that on Tyler’s most rap-oriented album since the peak days of Ofwgkta Domo might just have the best guest spot on the whole album

**Neighbourly** (8): good stuff

**welcome2thejam** (8): Just a super interesting listen of Tyler, old baggage and all, trying to figure out his place in the current landscape

**Awkward\_King** (7): i absolutely adore the intro and first verse to this song but ive never been too keen on the production once domo's verse comes in, but i do think his verse is great.

**BeauMeringue212** (7): social media posturing has definitely become a demand for public figures and I like that this song makes us confront that a bit more

**cremeebrulee** (7): back when you were tryna fuck who

# Well, at least y'all ain't

**afs** (6.5): this clickbait istg

**CrimsonROSET** (6): hey at least he’s against barebacking

**Roxieloxie** (5): I have thoughts but once again im on popheads so im leaving them to myself

**sufjancaesar** (10): Not familiar with DAISY WORLD but her vocals are so light and beautiful. This is one of the tracks I come back to the most, it’s instantly euphoric for me. Would fit right in on Flower Boy!

**steelstepladder** (7.5): The Tyler listening party just keeps coming. This stretch of Tyler songs mostly fell victim to the mixtappey feel of the album, and songs not standing out to the popheads audience. This one in particular is fairly good but I thought it would do at least a little better due to a woman being on it. Turns out popheads can surprise you!

---

# DAISY WORLD rights!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): tyler's rhyming of "boy-cott-him" and "bot-tom" is so satisfying

**bbfan132** (10): one of the first songs i listened to again after listening to this for the first time

**iniekcja\_** (10): come on Daisy!!

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): daisy's voice is gorgeous

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this sounds so nostalgic to me somehow, it reminds me kinda of old hiphop songs from the early-mid 2000’s especially with that chorus

**welcome2thejam** (10): So incredibly infectious, you are all federally obligated to move and groove to this

**TiltControls** (9.5): In terms of the more upbeat tracks, I think this is the best one on the album

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh daisy completely wipes him

**modulum83** (8.7): reminder that jamie xx is a fucking king

**afs** (8): can I get a witness

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I love how at the beginning he's begging us to stay just to humiliate us throughout the song, mansplain manipulate malewife

# MEH

**Stryxen** (7.5): twerk

**akanewasright** (7): this is one of the thematically weaker flex-y tracks to me, but it does bop a bit

**camerinian** (7): I wish the rest of the track went as hard as that hook does

**Neighbourly** (7): bit messy. reminiscent of cherry bomb. classic tyler key change with the chick is really good

**team\_kockroach** (6.9): a little too much. Might be the only filler song on the whole album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Spoken word intro is a slay

**shipperondeck** (6): this is the only song in this album that im like ehhhhh about

**seanderlust** (5.3): when I was doing the CMIYGL write up this is the one track that I most struggled to write something for. it's fine, but in an album full of top-tier tracks it just felt...eh?

**runaway3212** (4): the previous interlude deserved a better song

**sufjancaesar** (10): Ultimately, I can see why this placed on the lower end but I fuck with this chorus a lot and I think it’s overall kind of hypnotic and entrancing

**steelstepladder** (8): I find this song a little underrated. Spoken word songs never tend to do well but the chorus is just so groovy that it luls me into such a groovy state I can't help but to groove. The title track ends up as the second lowest SWNT score which to me, feels at least a little unfair.

---

# Smiling with teeth


**bbfan132** (10): <3 love this title track

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): love love love this one, the slow and slinky approach is so effective. It’s Genesis’s best vocal performance and the lyrics cut deep, it’s like listening to a full movie.

**KingKabs** (10): another 11 contender I was so drawn in by the rhythm

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): If you were to tell me this was a Frank Ocean track, I would fully believe you. There is just some quality to the song that makes it feel like a grand piece of art.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): the chorus here would be a fire hipster children’s TV show

**Stryxen** (9): :D

**TiltControls** (9): The smoothness of this song is truly another level

**camerinian** (8.5): it honestly takes a lot of skill to get a song deliberately sounding plodding and belaboured and yet not have it come off as a slog

**afs** (8): the story of the two black dogs is what Twin Fantasy aspires to be

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I could listen to Genesis talk for hours, his voice is just 🥰🥰🥰

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this BUILDS

**runaway3212** (8): honestly this is really pretty randomly

**shipperondeck** (8): the concept for this song/album is incredibly well visualized

**welcome2thejam** (8): Liar, I'm looking at the album cover and I see teeth. Checkmate, Genesis

**team\_kockroach** (7.6): after the fast tempos of the last few songs, this slow jam almost sounds like an interlude, but it still sounds awesome! I want Thundercat on this bassline

**modulum83** (7.5): don't let the acapella groups hear about this song

# Not smiling, with no teeth

**frogaranaman** (7): this is just bear face

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): Not gonna lie with how consciously constructed this album felt and how interesting it’s been I was expecting more from the title track

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i got an ad for dentures on youtube before this played

**Awkward\_King** (4): i like the climax of this song and i appreciate the western vibes throughout but they are not for me

---

# :throws gang signs:


**indie\_fan\_** (9.4): Freddie’s annoying as hell as a person, but still one of the most talented of his generation.

**iniekcja\_** (9): flashback to the time Schoolboy Q came to a festival here as a replacement for Wu Tang Clan and proceeded to pick on both the crowd and the festival itself while on stage, jesus this rate keeps on bringing memories

**seanderlust** (9): schoolboy q and freddie collaborating...we are truly blessed

**shipperondeck** (9): idk what to say except i really like this one

**welcome2thejam** (9): Both these guys I know of, but haven't checked out at all, and I guess I oughta change that sooner rather than later

**modulum83** (8.7): freddie gibbs has one of the most satisfying flows ever

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): verrrrry smooth chorus. Also nice to hear a good Schoolboy verse bc they’ve all but disappeared the last few years

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): ig i just completely missed this song when it came out. it's good though

**Neighbourly** (8): schoolboy not good enough for gibbs. great otherwise

# :doesn't move:

**afs** (7): slurring is better than slurs I suppose

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i hate that this music video implies that freddie gibbs has a fursona and its a pink bunny

**IIIHenryIII** (4): studio was a nice song, but this ain't it Schoolboy Q

**frogaranaman** (3): this is where I admit that I think Freddie Gibbs is overrated

**whydideveribother** (3): I have just never been into Freddie Gibbs, his name sounds like a bank manager and his flows are boring.

**sufjancaesar** (5): I don’t think this works well as a closer following ‘No Looking Back’ and ‘A Song About Fishing’. It gives me whiplash and sounds grating here imo. It would fit better on the first half of the album if it wasn’t explicitly labelled as a Bye Bye song

**sufjancaesar** (8): The closing track of SWNT, and one that raters felt a little underwhelmed by. Nev

---

# Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened


**welcome2thejam** (10): The musical equivalent of the horror movie ending where you cut back to the killer's body and they open their eyes

**Stryxen** (9.9): the final-3-track stretch of SWNT is stunning and flawless. although this would be my least fave of these 3 in a rate context, it’s still an all time fav for me

**bbfan132** (9.5): really good outro to an excellent album!!

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): I like the unsettling vibe and the repetition of the recurring metaphors on the album, works great as a closer

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Bye Genesis what an amazing album mwah

**DefaultPophead** (9): What a way to end an album. Kinda low-key but ties the whole thing together.

**runaway3212** (9): slay closer

**afs** (8.5): maybe this guy really likes dogs black dogs

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This is such a good closer

**Neighbourly** (8.5): Really effective closing note, like it a lot.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): weakest closer on the rate but like, its still good? Idk what to tell you genesis IS the moment

**frogaranaman** (8): oh okay the album is over now

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A good closer to the album but not my favorite song

**plastichaxan** (8): nooo don’t go your album is so good

**UselessTacooo** (8): It’s really cute but I don’t know how I feel about it being an album closer.

**modulum83** (7.8): i listened to this late at night and started to hallucinate

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): it's a cool song but doesn't really add much and doesn't really feel like a closer to me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): this is a decent closer though

**team\_kockroach** (7.1): From the Apple Music description, this track’s main purpose is to remind the audience that journeys through depression don’t end on happy, upbeat songs…but you can still end and album with a meaningful, upbeat song that remains realistic and grounded to the situation (just ask Kendrick or Brockhampton). So does this song really belong?

**shipperondeck** (7): please no this ending is so fucking sad

**TiltControls** (7): :kirbywave:

**akanewasright** (6.5): this is a very good ending to the album, but it’s not one I can see myself going out of my way to listen to outside of the album

# Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it’s over

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this is really disappointing as a closer for me. i think if no looking back and this track swapped places in the tracklist i wouldve liked both of them better

**IIIHenryIII** (3): bye

**Awkward\_King** (2): i understand this as an outro track and appreciate how it completes the album but i also dont care for it whatsoever

**sufjancaesar** (5): For me, a lot of the reptition works in Genesis’ music but here it does get irritating and boring. I think I’d chop this in a heartbeat if I could remove one track from the album. It’s the most redundant one

**steelstepladder** (10): And now we have the first Genesis robbery! I know saying this album is slick as hell isn't anything new but this song has such a wispy and ethereal vibe to it I'm a bit dissapointed it hasn't made day 2 at least. A song that was teatering between days for most of the rate comes up a little short for day two, but I think it's a bit of a surprise that other SWNT songs placed above it.

# Hard


**bbfan132** (10): this second half is amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (10): see you in a while, crocodile

**plastichaxan** (10): this song just gets to me no i won’t elaborate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): An 80s synth-y song that sounds fresh in 2022, Genesis thee Genius

**DefaultPophead** (9): Damn, kinda feel bad that this song makes me want to dance.

**Neighbourly** (9): shit eh, didn't know this song was about fuckin invasion day. fuck this place sucks sometimes. Nice tonal shift.

**TiltControls** (9): this weirdly sounds like a sped up Don't Need You at parts during the chorus. But as a whole the song is great

**seanderlust** (8.2): you'll never be troye sivan (NOTE: this is a joke)

**shipperondeck** (8.2): don't kill me but the instrumental reminds me of some mega man 11 song

**afs** (8): Troye Sivan outsold

**uberpigeon** (8): finally a song for space alien clowns

**celladonn** (7): Powerful subject matter but not my fave track

**frogaranaman** (7): pz

**runaway3212** (7): outsold adele

**modulum83** (6.8): more like Hard

# Easy

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Feels kinda repetitive, it’s not bad but it doesn’t go anywhere.

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): this might be the only song on SWNT where there’s a disconnect between the instrumental, lyrical content, and overall themes. Is he criticizing white women for “colonizing” POC? Is the female-male imagery literal or metaphorical? Two verses aren’t enough to make this song clear

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): i’m already easy

**IIIHenryIII** (6): to ignore

**fadedblue09** (2): A generic, derivative song like this has no business being in a soulful and sonically adventurous album

**sufjancaesar** (9): So smooth, relaxing and another showcase of how much Simz’s versatility as a rapper elevates her work. She’s brilliant at selling the mood. Lowkey robbed :sadkiss:

**steelstepladder** (8): The accoustic guitar on this is SO GOOD!! A victim of not being a song to slut drop to, I might want to call this the most underrated Simz song in the rate. Still, the understated nature of this song lead it to fall into the background and didn't generate enough talking points to get it out of day one.

# 👀

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): chillllll

**camerinian** (10): this just really connected with me and I have no idea why. Maybe it’s because coming off of an album with such huge ambition and scope that a small-scale intimate love song really stands out, but the production is immaculate and the chorus vocals are gorgeous. Simbi said on Genius that this is the heart of the album, and I feel it beating so loudly. This hits me really good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why do i like this so much? idk!

**MrMoodle** (10): i’m obsessed with the tiny little guitar plucks in the chorus, cool beachy sunset vibe

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): love the lyrics of this one and the more chill vibe is a nice change of pace

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): idk if it's a sample or if it's Simz singing there but that chorus just sounds angelic

**skargardin** (9): such a different vibe from the rest of the album, but it's well appreciated! Especially before the next few energetic tracks

**UselessTacooo** (9): I would argue this is the most emotional song on the album. While it’s written from a place of happiness, it finds a way to evoke so much emotion, whether that was the intent or not.

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): this coming after standing ovation is really excellent album pacing, i love how downtempo and chill this is

**TiltControls** (8.5): 👁

**shipperondeck** (8.4): truly the introvert's love ballad

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): omg this song finally clicked for me while doing this rate, i mean it's still my least favourite of the non-interludes but on the 45th play i feel like i finally get it at least

**afs** (8): that's a well placed change of pace

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait who’s singing the chorus is it her?

**frogaranaman** (8): me when I see someone

**Neighbourly** (8): perfectly fine

**team\_kockroach** (8): it’s a nice change of pace after two braggadocious bangers. I think a feature verse could break up some of Simbi’s monotony though.

# 🧑‍🦯

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): the hook is great but the verses here feel a lot weaker than the rest of the album so far

**Awkward\_King** (7): phoebe bridgers:

**celladonn** (7): It's sweet and cute but doesn't hit me that hard

**runaway3212** (7): boring but kinda slay

**akanewasright** (6.9): I’ve always kinda overlooked this one, but it’s pretty okay. I was underrating it in my mind

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-uEpa6jtW8

**uberpigeon** (5): phoebe brigder outsold

**fadedblue09** (4): The singing voice is pleasant but this is filler

**modulum83** (3.5): zz...zzzzzzz....zzz

**IIIHenryIII** (3): this is just zzzzzzzzzz

**sufjancaesar** (8): I feel like I should like this more for the industrial influences but it’s sort of there for me. I love what it offers to the diverse sound palette of the album but I think it could go harder. Maybe some more bass idk

**steelstepladder** (8): One of the lowest full Simz songs in the rate is a very good albiet forgettable compared to some of the towering ambition that gives this album a lot of its defining qualities.

---

# I Do Drugs (feat. Little Simz)

**Awkward\_King** (10): the grey area influence is really loud on this one, i remember when i first listened to the album on release night with akane i said it reminded me of grey area and then the next line she namedropped boss, a song from the album sjdsj. i love simz over more industrial type beats, and i think this does a good job at leaning into that a bit while also remaining very cohesive within the album.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): we love Simz flexin on all of us

**iniekcja\_** (10): velocity

**Neighbourly** (10): great. really didn't need that interlude.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): the hold songs named speed have on me is truly something

**bbfan132** (9): :listening: love the more electro sound

**CrimsonROSET** (9): EXTREMELY UNDERRATED TRACK.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I can’t unhear Lust for Life (Iggy Pop not Lana Del Rey)

**skargardin** (9): "Got a hard drive full of classics", honestly after listening to this album, I don't doubt it

**Stryxen** (9): a morse code beat omg

**UselessTacooo** (9): While I don’t find it to be the best song on the album, it is a whole lot of fun to listen to and bop along with.

**team\_kockroach** (8.9): yasss simbi on a drill beat. The transition to Standing Ovation is seriously heavenly

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): banger, probably the track here that would best fit on grey area

**shipperondeck** (8.4): not the genius comment saying this has a donkey kong game beat

**afs** (8): girlbossing anthem

**akanewasright** (8): this is just a GREY Area song (complementary)

**runaway3212** (8): this song is great but speed the drug is very horrible 0 out of 10

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): I don't really have much to say about many of these songs they're just good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): why did she enunciate kanye west so weirdly

**TiltControls** (7): The most forgettable non-interlude on the album. And it's still a 7! That's how good the album is

# I Don't Do Drugs (feat. Ariana Grande)

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): love it sonically, but that's not enough

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): oh... i do not like that synth at all...

**frogaranaman** (6): isn't this a life ending drug

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Not bad but it kinda comes and goes

**welcome2thejam** (6): I rigged this rate to explode if this song goes under 50 bpm

**modulum83** (4): how did you manage to make a brag rap song boring
