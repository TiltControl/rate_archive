**sufjancaesar** (10): She popped the fuck off with these Afrobeats bangers. Also, this song made it onto FIFA 22 and speaking of…FIFA soundtrack ultimate rate when??


**steelstepladder** (8.5): And here we have the first elimination of day 3

---

# Vote for Afrobeats Rate!

**akanewasright** (10): idk what to say this is just the yass

**apatel27** (10): The production on this is insane

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): another good one

**bbfan132** (10): everything about this is excellent

**fadedblue09** (10): Sounds really unique, very Afro-inspired

**Roxieloxie** (10): not the backhalf of this album going the fuck off

**skargardin** (10): the transition from point and kill.. chefskiss

**Stryxen** (10): Very nearly an 11 I am obsessed with this song and the way simz just commands your attention throughout - it’s like a victory lap in the album

**UselessTacooo** (10): Slayed the house boots down or whatever

**camerinian** (9.5): oh my god that transition from Point and Kill is smooth as butter

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the instrumental choices in this are so fucking cool

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): love the sound of this one!

**Neighbourly** (9): great blend

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): i’m actually so stupid i thought they were saying piano man

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): put my mum on the cover of gq, you can't relate cause thats something that g's do

**team\_kockroach** (8.4): i love the carefree looseness of Protect My Energy -> Point and Kill -> Fear No Man. Simbi fits these beats like a glove

**modulum83** (8.3): oh wait this is the good version of that other song

**afs** (8): is that a demi reference or a demi diss

**shipperondeck** (8): that transition broooOOOOOOOOo

**sufjancaesar** (9): Something about this has Kim “get your ass up and work! people don’t wanna work these days” Kardashian energy but I choose to focus on the good vibes :sparkles:


**steelstepladder** (9.5): The penultimate song on simz album is tied for the first song eliminated day 3. I saw a few people saying it didn't deserve to make it but idk, I think this is a worthy day three addition!

---

# idk Simz, a really nice car?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): idk I kinda just walked in

**bbfan132** (10): <3

**camerinian** (10): jesus this hits so hard man, you can really feel Simz' history with every single line, her conviction is just perfect, and the hook is a gorgeous bit of backup. This is such a great way to start wrapping up the narrative

**CrimsonROSET** (10): started from the bottom now we’re here

**frogaranaman** (10): beautiful. wish this was the album closer

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m sitting and I’m listening, fantastic penultimate track.

**KingKabs** (10): another 11 contender. Powerful.

**skargardin** (10): At this point I just don't have enough superlatives left for this album to write comments on, but yeah this is another excellent showing

**thedoctordances1940** (10): incredible

**UselessTacooo** (10): A beautiful wrapup of the album

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): can she be my therapist? The self-love is just overflowing from this song

**akanewasright** (9): someone once told me that glee would cover this if it was around in 2021 and that permanently scarred me

**modulum83** (8.5): this is basically a reading of a college entrance essay. beat goes dummy hard tho

**TiltControls** (8.5): Just a really sweet and genuine track. Plus I always love growing up & looking on the past type songs

**afs** (8): feels a better closer than miss understood tbh

**BeauMeringue212** (8): this is one of the calmest, least bragadocious "starter from the bottom" rap song and I kinda love that lol

**Neighbourly** (8): very solid

**welcome2thejam** (8): Feeling her flows here, it's a well-done version of the traditional slower, more soulful, reminiscing about the rise to the top rap tracks

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): this is lowkey a drake song (complimentary)

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): yes, ma'am, take us to church


# i just walked tbh


**seanderlust** (7.5): "all i had was my brain and my hunger" - me stoned at 1 AM creating a snack out of ingredients that do not at all go together

**shipperondeck** (6.8): i feel bad giving such a meaningful, heartfelt song this score but it's just not clicking ugh

**Awkward\_King** (5): im not too keen on the chorus but the verses bring it up for me

**sufjancaesar** (10): An absolute banger that rings in your head for days, it’s so visceral yet so catchy. RTJ and Zack De La Rocha always make some real magic…‘Close Your Eyes (and Count to Fuck)’ future rate winner!!

**steelstepladder** (10): Look at all these slave masters posing on your dollar is potentially lyric of the entire rate and thats saying something.

---

# Pharrell (complimentary/derogatory)


**camerinian** (10): God damn RTJ and Zack go together like peanut butter and chocolate, which I guess makes Pharrell… like a white chocolate layer? Probably not to everyone's taste but fuck I love the decadence

**iniekcja\_** (10): god i love Pharrell


**shipperondeck** (10): RAGE AGAINST THE JEWELS WOOOOOOOOOOOOO (ALSO NICE WORK PHARRELL)

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Zack is always a treat to hear on RTJ songs, and Pharrell's influence is so smooth and good.

**whydideveribother** (10): I'm just picturing El-P with a pitchfork keeping Pharell out of the production booth. Also best song on the album.

**team\_kockroach** (9.1): might be in the minority but i don’t like the Pharrell hook


**akanewasright** (8): I think I’m just programmed to lose my shit any time I hear Pharrell’s voice


**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): something something can we rate sweetener

**IIIHenryIII** (11): this bass sounds like the one from Black Widow

# $

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): fuck capitalism!

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I'm a sucker for Killer Mike's Trump disses, it's true

**frogaranaman** (10): the week that this dropped my fam and I walked up to the convenience store to grab some beers and someone was blasting this shit when we walked by lolol

**Neighbourly** (10): Brain bounce off walls like a sentient Roomba, Just found out his creator's stupid lol where does he come up with this shit

**plastichaxan** (10): standout from very first listen

**UselessTacooo** (10): maybe the best song on the album?

**cremeebrulee** (9): hard

**CrimsonROSET** (9): LOOK AT ALL THESE SLAVE MASTERS POSING ON YOUR DOLLAR

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): I keep sharing with my brother, a RATM stan, RTJ songs with Zack De La Rocha and he only like’s Zack’s parts sob

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): im a big ratm fan so i was fully expecting to go into this loving zack’s verse the most but pharrell really popped off here this is top tier production from him

**TiltControls** (9): get it?

**seanderlust** (8.8): "got a vonnegut punch for your atlas shrugged" @ libertarians

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I deeply deeply wish that this song didn’t make me immediately think about Hamilton discourse

**apatel27** (8): The get it yeah at the end of the chorus lines brings the song down

**celladonn** (8): This was my favorite track when the album first came out but it's grown off me a bit

**modulum83** (8): "look at all these slave masters posing on your dollar" is one of the hardest lines i've ever heard

**MrMoodle** (7.5): lord sweet buddha please make me 😩💦

# £

**afs** (7): I feel a bit guilty for thinking he said slay instead of slave

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): im not as keen on the beat for this one, i think its one of the only misses for me on the album

**runaway3212** (4): I don't get it

**sufjancaesar** (10): I just wanna say his vocals are so strong throughout this album and this track is no exception. He sounds incredible and the colourful instrumental really makes this one overwhelming and emotional for me

# SINK

**letsallpoo** (11): https://gfycat.com/barrendismalcrocodile

**TiltControls** (11): A while back I assumed I'd just give it to Introvert again but damn is this a catchy song. Blew my mind that this was the sky cowboy song guy too (though not the actual sky cowboy unfortunately)

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i’ll never let go jack

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i can’t believe this album was a way to get me to listen to indie pop rock

**RandomHypnotica** (10): omg it's IPR core

**shipperondeck** (10): it's giving 80s rock inxs/bruce springsteen somehow omg

**skargardin** (10): oh wow

**welcome2thejam** (10): My favorite song during my first playthrough, and it's easy to see why, it's just so catchy and full of energy and a fun change of pace.

**modulum83** (9.5): what is the Big Enough guy doing here

**team\_kockroach** (9.3): CALLINAN ATE! Jfc the chemistry is twice as good as anything from cmiygl

**UselessTacooo** (9.3): the yassifcation of rock

**akanewasright** (9): This is film student-core, but every now and then they make points ig

**bbfan132** (9): :puggofast:

**camerinian** (9): God I love how all over the place this album is that Kirin J Callinan can just pop in and do Bruce Springsteen karaoke and it fits perfectly

**Roxieloxie** (9): Yeah i get exactly why that sinkhole opened in the middle of his show, this album is fucking

**seanderlust** (9): an interesting take on the 80s pop revival we've seen recently. this feels somewhat springsteeny

**Stryxen** (8.9): slay idk he slayed

**afs** (8.5): nooooo the word row is in drown you need to row we need lover streams

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): A cute little pop-rock(?) moment, love to see it!

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): oh that chorus is a bop i'm shaking my ass

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): bop!

**iniekcja\_** (8): something something Olivia Rodrigo something something pop punk something revival

# SWIM

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): the first time I heard this song I thought for a second that Bruce Springsteen was singing on it

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): I feel like the bogans that live behind me would LOVE this.

**frogaranaman** (7): what I'm doing in my night terrors

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I get what he’s going for with the whole ‘80s pop pastiche thing and to his credit he does it well, but I don’t like that sound much lol

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it might be a grower

**MrMoodle** (7): kinda wish the song didn’t have kirin’s vocals lol

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): ohhh the guitar riff on this reminds me SO much of something else but I can’t place it in time to make an interesting comparison so you’ll have to settle for this boring comment

**BeauMeringue212** (6): not crazy about the guitar tbh, feels a bit cheesy 80s

**runaway3212** (6): i am bored

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): the chorus of this sounds like a song that’d be in a video game ost that all the weirdo anime twitter fans would praise and be like “this is better than ANY rap song ever made, this is what REAL music is”

# SCREAMING, CRYING AND THROWING UP

**bbfan132** (11): so fucking good

**CrimsonROSET** (11): this is gonna get SO robbed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): this song is very cathartic for me. Alright, time to actually elaborate. This is such a visceral track just slandering racists with full righteous anger. I love it, Genesis’ energy and the ending guitar moment is everything.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): everything about this song feels so out of place with each other... the peaceful, magical legend of zelda fairy cave type beat, that amazingly funky guitar lick, the brutal lyricism and consistent flow. On paper should all be from different songs... but they combine here to create something truly amazing

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this is such a good track i hope it does well

**bigbigbee** (10): The guitar at the end brings this up to a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): GO THE FUCK OFF!!!!

**iniekcja\_** (10): mama coosa

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): person who’s only ever listened to death grips listening to their second experimental rap song: getting a lot of death grips vibes from this

**welcome2thejam** (10): The drop followed by the riff coming in is probably my favorite moment in the whole rate. And that outro! A perfect release to the last two songs.

**seanderlust** (9.2): funk rock deliciousness with some righetous indignation in the lyrics. magic.

**akanewasright** (9): god he’s fucking brilliant

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): whoa this is a banger

**camerinian** (9): if there is any other rapper out there doing such wild shit with post-punk instrumentals please let me know cos this is an itch that i need scratched urgently

**runaway3212** (9): this outro >>>>

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I agree with what he’s saying here and I like the sound of this track, I just wish the outro were a bit shorter

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): we need more rock hip hop!

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Haha I get it

**Neighbourly** (8.5): really interesting out there song, respect for making this

**TiltControls** (8.5): The outro instrumental is amazing

**modulum83** (8.3): this is absolutely deranged i love it

**team\_kockroach** (8.2): nastiest guitar on the entire album

**afs** (8): I didn't expect the extra profanity here but it's fitting

**shipperondeck** (8): the outroooooooooOOO SIR YOUR BASS LINE

# THROWING UP

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): Honestly wasn’t feeling this outside of the lyrics until the funk rock breakdown came in but that helped a lot… he lets it linger a bit long but its fine to get a bit indulgent when this is clearly a big moment on the album

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): New genre: rapping on minecraft music

**BeauMeringue212** (7.2): I like the song but the Two Door Cinema Club-esque instrumental is a tad out of place

**frogaranaman** (7): is that a descriptor or a command

**Stryxen** (7): no cos we literally dont fuck with neo nazi spew

**IIIHenryIII** (6): another one that feels like a grower

**sufjancaesar** (10): Even the first second of this is smooth as hell, it’s a charming ass song that’s hard not to love. I wanna hear Tyler more in his 90s and early 00s bag with like an Andre 3000 feature or some shit lmao

# r/AmItheAsshole


**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): AITA for telling my anorexic girlfriend she looks malnourished? Some backstory is I'm a huge Tyler, The Creator fan and have been since I was in 5th grade, he's my favorite rapper of all time and Wolf is (IMO) one of the greatest albums ever. About a month ago he released his new album "Call Me If You Get Lost" and on one of the songs (the song with NBA YoungBoy [YoungBoy is normally trash but his verse was fire here]) Tyler starts the song off by saying "You look malnourished" to this girl as a pick up line and I thought it was one of the funniest pickup lines I've ever heard. My girlfriend knows I'm a huge Tyler fan, she even likes Igor (which is his weakest album but whatever) so she's familiar with his lyrics and humor. So the problem starts when last night my girlfriend and I were going on a date to go watch Space Jam 2 and we were talking about which restaurant to eat at before the movie, my GF said she didn't care because she wasn't going to eat anything. My GF has suffered from anorexia since high school and as a result she is severely underweight, I've told her before I think she should seek some help because it's not healthy but she always just ignores my advice. So we get to the restaurant and I order a steak and she only get's a water, the whole time from us leaving the house to arriving at the restaurant I told her I think she should get something to eat since prior to this she hadn't had anything to eat for 3 days and midway through the meal I jokingly said "You look malnourished" and she immediately burst into tears and called me an asshole and caught an uber to her mom's house. I tried calling her but she wouldn't pick up until like an hour later when I got a call from her mother cursing me out, saying "how dare you say that to her, you know she is very self conscious about her eating disorder" and talking about how awful I am, I tried explaining to her that it's from a song (a song that my girlfriend has definitely heard multiple times for the record) but she wasn't having any of it and said that her daughter was going to be staying with her for a few days. This all happened last night and I haven't spoken to my GF since because she's still not responding to my calls or texts, I just feel like my gf is overreacting over such a small joke that ended our date night early and we never even got to watch Space Jam 2. So what do you guys think, AITA for making a harmless joke that my GF took in an offensive way?

# Feeling Nourished

**akanewasright** (10): what’s a worse thing to say someone cool that you’re into: saying they look malnourished or asking them to watch indie movies?

**Awkward\_King** (10): https://twitter.com/zephanijong/status/1426766642076397574

**bbfan132** (10): i knew i’d love this the second i first heard a snippet of it

**iniekcja\_** (9): Ty Dolla $ign truly a legendary feature artist

**shipperondeck** (9): yb on a track like this is interesting right

**welcome2thejam** (9): Smooooth track. Perfect guest verse, love his voice on this, especially how it rolls on "compared" and "proud"

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): yb better

**TiltControls** (8.5): Probably my favourite of the big tracks/singles

**afs** (8): Tyler could've done this track much better on his own

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): For a second there I thought he said “listen to The Vamps” and I was like omg finally someone with taste

**Stryxen** (8): this being our only tyler song in our top 100 of 2021 (AT 101!?????).... embarrassing

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): i wish someone would call me malnourished

**team\_kockroach** (7.8): the neo-soul groove is so lovely, it’s seriously criminal how short this song is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sorry i never liked this one 😭 it’s so short that it barely gets any time to do anything special and what it does show isnt very interesting

**shipperondeck** (10): to quote the top comment on genius when i was looking for the lyrics, "fuck this is really good" also i cant not go a whole rate without giving props to a sexy bass line

**skargardin** (10): this groove!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): he put his whole owussy in this one

**welcome2thejam** (10): Might be his best flow-wise?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): He found 2 Chainz third chain omg

**bbfan132** (9.5): the synths are a neat touch!

**frogaranaman** (9): Kevin Abstract heard this song then disbanded BROCKHAMPTON promptly

# SILVER

**team\_kockroach** (8.7): i love the internal rhyme schemes and cadence a lot, but what does “ripping curls like i’m fucking Keenan” mean?

**TiltControls** (8.5): The vocals are amazing, but the instrumentation is top-notch

**afs** (8): suffering from success - dj khaled

**modulum83** (8): guys i'm not sure but i think he might not be talking about literal golden chains

**UselessTacooo** (8): It almost sounds like he took a demo from American Boyfriend and that is a huge compliment

# BRONZE

**akanewasright** (7.8): he really performed the song with the lyric “I can't deny internal lies in hopes that I'd be televised” on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert huh? Icon

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the chaotic guitar is super cool

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): i'm sorry but this one never clicked for me

**sufjancaesar** (10): THIS FLOW THIS FLOW THIS FLOW…It’s fucking incredible. I’m content with this placement, I don’t think this song is remarkable or anything but it’s perfect for what it is. Tightly-written, a satisfying instrumental build and isn’t overly drawn out. My CMIYGL fave

---

#CORSO AKA Bop!

**Awkward\_King** (11): i was very indecisive over what my 11 should be, but i think i feel the most impassioned by this option. the track goes fucking hard, the drop is insane and it is such a jolt of adrenaline i adore it. lyrically it is brilliant, i particularly love the third verse, "try to take somebody bitch cause i'm a bad person", i love the way it plays into the ongoing theme of tyler's recent work, a semi-fictionalised love triangle. and tyler's delivery of every lyric is brilliant, i really could just loop this song forever and never tire of it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): god there's so many quotable lines on this song

**cremeebrulee** (10): this track nails the futility of trying to "fix" a broken heart so well without wasting a single second of its runtime, it’s a perfect opener to the album and if i had a second 11, it would easily go to this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): his flow is so fun in this

**modulum83** (10): this song makes me feel like im the coolest person to ever walk the earth

**seanderlust** (10): not much I can say here. it's a banger. his flow at the start of the second verse is maybe my favorite on the entire album. also what a flex talking about other-other-other-other cribs

**welcome2thejam** (10): God, that beat drop makes me want to buy a boat too and I'm afraid of the ocean

**shipperondeck** (9.8): shoutout to me losing my SHIT when i first heard this. it's T baby ;)

**akanewasright** (9): God, what an asshole [twerks]

**fadedblue09** (9): oh so that's where the title came from

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): best lyrics on the album

**IIIHenryIII** (9): short song that is so good it feels longer, check

**skargardin** (9): this goes OFF

**UselessTacooo** (9): Tyler: I don’t even like saying the word bitch. Also Tyler: says bitch within 40s of the next song.

**team\_kockroach** (8.2): “Look, tried to take somebody bitch 'cause I'm a bad person, I don't regret shit because that pussy worth it”. Killer line - imagine if A$AP Rocky was here too smh

**afs** (8): with all due respect DJ Drama is like the Charli XCX claws video superimposed on top of Grimes' spaghetti

**frogaranaman** (8): damn Tyler, so multicultural with the Italian song title!!! raw me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A Bay Bay a classique

**runaway3212** (8): YASSS

# CORSO AKA Flop!

**TiltControls** (7.5): I know this is one of the faves on the album, but I don't really love this. It's good - not bad or anything but I think there's better on the album

**Neighbourly** (6): not my thing beats too dirty

#LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): i remember listening to this for the first time and immediately falling in love with it

**akanewasright** (10): One of the best on the album, one of the best in the rate. MASSIVE 11 contender

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): damn

**celladonn** (10): Incredible storytelling and it sounds gorgeous

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this album is so good

**Neighbourly** (10): powerful. Could have condensed 1 and 2 into something a bit shorter and not killed the pace

**Stryxen** (10): This song has probably my favourite verse of the year - incredible emotional storytelling

**UselessTacooo** (10): Simz said she created this song to spread awareness on the topics at hand, and I am quite thankful she did. I’m sure someone, somewhere heard this and truly thought about it, just as I did.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Pretend I gave this an 11 at Indieheads Ultimate so I won't be repeating my 11 next month for JBrekkie. Anyway, favorite song on the album. The children's choir not only works here but that whole hook is a major reason for me liking this, I think it really fits on a song about reconnecting with someone you grew up with and telling their story

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): the beat is just fucking gorgeous innit

**bbfan132** (9.5): love how the sample/voice clip in the interlude was used here

**BeauMeringue212** (9): most cinematic track on the album for me. The lyrics really make you envision a movie in your head of this character's life

**camerinian** (9): holy shit this is that good time summer jam type feeling, man this is dreamy and the narrative is heartbreaking but so hopeful

**iniekcja\_** (9): reminded me that a distant cousin of mine is in jail for trying to run over a cop♥️

**runaway3212** (9): honestly great

**shipperondeck** (9): "my mind told me i'm invincible, but my body reminded me i'm human"

**skargardin** (9): the second verse, that's it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): that second verse…this is so emotionally raw

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this song builds in such a lovely way, simz is such a brilliant storyteller

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Did anybody see that movie *Little* with Issa Rae and Marsai Martin? Regina Hall killed it.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): this is awful (not the song, what she went through)

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): it should be a crime to be such a good storyteller

**TiltControls** (8.5): La la la la (now in song form)

**afs** (8): I do have to admire how open she is with her experiences as well as her eloquent narration

# MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH

**modulum83** (7.8): god i love the instrumental on here but i wish she had a better approach to writing about this topic than "shit changed when i had a brief encounter with death." most of the power in the storytelling here comes in that ethereal, indescribably rich outro

**seanderlust** (7.7): that little harmony after she says "Q." >>>>

**MrMoodle** (7): this song is almost really good but the kid singing the lalalalalala hook like oh my god shit the fuck up

**uberpigeon** (7): lalalala

**ImADudeDuh** (5): sorry but the chorus and the la la la la’s get annoying after a while

**steelstepladder** (8): One of the songs that I absolutely knew would do this well, but I'm just a little confused why its this high other than popheads do loves synths. Really good, but it's an 8 in a sea of 10s that were just eliminated imo.

# Popheadscore

**1998tweety** (11): now THIS is a BAWP. Lyrically it's one of the weaker songs on the album but it sounds the best.

**DefaultPophead** (11): Used to like it, but the more I hear it, the closer it gets to perfect. Love it now. Going to be one of my most played this year.

**Awkward\_King** (10): BANGER

**CrimsonROSET** (10): yes i will throw ass to this don’t judge me!

**frogaranaman** (10): me trying to conserve mana in Wizard 101

**modulum83** (10): this is the first song that's actually ABOUT introversion in a coherent way, and it works perfectly! simz reins her endless stream of self-affirmations here with something that actually feels like it has fun and doesn't take itself seriously. i can absolutely relate to not wanting to get to know strangers because you're afraid of not vibing with them, being so guarded against potential fuckups that you brush everyone off. and the beat is dummy hard - the hardest yet, even. those bubbly flashes of synths and freestyle drums. this is an absolute home run.

**plastichaxan** (10): BOP BOP!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Paradise Killer type beat

**Roxieloxie** (10): spill

**shipperondeck** (10): oh this is totally my energy

**skargardin** (10): so true

**Stryxen** (10): I adore these lyrics and i never thought I would hear a song like this from simz but it just works

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): bop!

**akanewasright** (9): yes, I am gay, how could you tell

**bbfan132** (9): total bop

**celladonn** (9): I always forget what a relatable little bop this is

**welcome2thejam** (9): What a slick track this is, custom made to be dancing by yourself like a true introvert

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): certified BOP

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): bop

**afs** (8.5): SYNTHS !? (AGAIN)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): this is more targetcore than be sweet (no I am not explaining this comment)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Kylie Jenner after there’s a shooting at her party

**BeauMeringue212** (8): an 80s pop song about the joys of an Introvert being on their own? She's pandering to us guys

**camerinian** (8): synthpop is a weirdly good look for this album

**ignitethephoenix** (8): in her 80s/90s bag here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this sounds like a better version of the filler tracks on planet her

**UselessTacooo** (8): This is one of the more relatable and accessible tracks on the album. It is hard to dislike, taking inspiration from classic pop and soul, and not being overly aggressive.

**team\_kockroach** (7.9): SIMBI ON A TECHNO BEAT! Sounds like a Tkay song, but at least it’s a very faithful Tkay song

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): disco???? 😍😍😍😍

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): oh, I like this new energy, why did she take so long  to bring her a-game???

# Hiphopheadscore

**TiltControls** (7): how am i supposed to protect my energy when I'm the one fucking it up in the first place by staying up way too late

**just\_thonking** (6.5): The weakest non-interlude on the album

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): On a rate with so many smooth beats, this is smooooooooooth

**steelstepladder** (8.5): Rainforest is such a groovy little jam in the way that only noname can deliver! Super worthy of the day 3 spot!

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this is one of my favourite songs ever, noname please come back we need you

**Neighbourly** (10): i miss her

**seanderlust** (10): this would likely be my 11 if it were eligible. I love it so so much.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Love the beat, so smooth and well paced. Noname has a perfect tone and flow for this. Had to instantly play it back.

**team\_kockroach** (9.9): imagine if this was the lead single to her new album instead of a one-off. .Paak wishes he could be her

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): "How you lemonade all your sadness when you openin' up?" One of my fave lines in the entire rate.

**Stryxen** (9.5): i have been obsessed with every noname song i’ve heard i need to listen more

**shipperondeck** (9.2): i loved this song last year and then somehow forgot about it so ty for reminding me of this pretty and insightful bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): outsold Billie Bossa Nova

**MrMoodle** (9): i’ve never really resonated with noname’s usual lofi style but this is so lush and pretty

**bbfan132** (8.5): “How you lemonade all your sadness when you openin' up?” idk if i’ve ever seen this mentioned in a song yet but it’s so true

**celladonn** (8.5): Anticapitalist queen

**afs** (8): chill flow

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ive always loved noname’s vibe

**modulum83** (7.3): super pretty and skillfully written but dissolves in my ears like air

**frogaranaman** (7): she's such a vibe

**IIIHenryIII** (3): this kinda sounds like traditional music from my country, which I hate with all of my guts

**sufjancaesar** (10): Genesis knocks it out of the park with strong choruses and this is one of the best examples. This chorus is so unique and goes so unbelievably hard and I will continue to loop it

**steelstepladder** (10): YOUR ASS IS STINKY AND YOU LOOK LIKE A MOLE!!! Has officially gone into the popheads lyric hall of fame at this point

---

# STINKY

**MrMoodle** (11): this song is so dynamic yet manages to flow PERFECTLY. the way he kinda robotically spits the “WAIT. COULD. THIS. BE. TRUE.” line contrasted with that velvety smooth post-chorus, mwah, bliss. plus “your ass is stinky and you built like a mole” is such a good read so direct so forward who’s doing it like him fucking no one

**uberpigeon** (11): uh oh stinky

**akanewasright** (10): one day I’ll find someone I hate enough to say “your ass is stinky and you built like a mole” to


**CrimsonROSET** (10): I SAID YOUR ASS IS STINKY AND YOU’RE BUILT LIKE A MOLE :kirbyell:

**just\_thonking** (10): "your ass is stinky and you built like a mole" iconic roast

**nt96** (10): Calling someone stinky is the new ultimate insult

**plastichaxan** (10): I said, your ass is stinky and you built like a mole

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "your ass is stinky, and you built like a mole" is SUCH a top tier insult like i would fucking die on the spot

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): depression is a stinky-assed bitch, so true

**seanderlust** (10): "your ass is stinky and you built like a mole" is in the top two best lines in 2021 and I don't think it's number 2

**Stryxen** (10): OMFG tbt to when i said “your ass is stinky and you built like a mole” in beatsense and people thought i was randomly dragging someone for a second before this line in the song played

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): telling someone their ass is stinky is probably the deepest burn you can possibly make

**celladonn** (8): I kind of hate the ass is stinky line but other than that, banger

**DefaultPophead** (8): "I said, your ass is stinky and you built like a mole!" I legit think I would cry if someone said that to me.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): ass sniffing to assert dominance

**camerinian** (7): would you believe I actually fucking hated this song on my first listen? Yeah that was a goofy take. The groove is impeccable and most of the lyrics do pick up a lot more resonance with further listening. Still cringe a bit at “your ass is stinky” though.

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): hearing that line for the first time was a memorable experience for sure lol

# CLEAN

**SmileAndTears** (11): the verse after the first chorus>>>>>>

**welcome2thejam** (11): Might've been my favorite song of 2021 if it hadn't been actually released in 2020. Killer grooves, memorable lines, and such a strong middle finger to depression and other mental stuff holding us back. I love Genesis' delivery on these little bits - that perfect dismissive "aaahhhh" in the chorus or every "goddamn!". Also not gonna spoil it, but the current live version ends in the most fantastic way

**apatel27** (10): Godly chorus

**Awkward\_King** (10): rate winner iktr

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): WAIT! COULD. THIS. BE. TRUE. I DON'T NEED YOU. I. DON'T. NEED. YOU.

**bbfan132** (10): :listening: love the disco sound

**bigbigbee** (10): I hope I’m built like this mole

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It feels like Genesis is dragging ME and I welcome it

**iniekcja\_** (10): my two friends who both love this album after they broke out last week🥰🥰

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): banger

**Roxieloxie** (10): im lacking the words to properly explain why I like this song but I really am enjoying this one

**TiltControls** (10): Really some top tier insults in here

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is a perfect song. Everything happening is excellently crafted and unforgettable. While I could probably go on for paragraphs about how incredible this song is, I’ll save all your time. If this doesn’t have my 11 by the end of the rate, it was definitely a difficult cut.

**afs** (9): goddamn manchild kind of iconery with the first line

**BeauMeringue212** (9): res tagging low scorers for this as "built like a mole"

**shipperondeck** (9): YESSS we love our feel good establishment of independence

**modulum83** (8.5): the lyrics are super simple and obvious but at the same time it really works as a straightforward empowering message about defeating your personal demons by just being too cool for them. embrace your inner cringe!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): the unevenness of how he says I Don’t Need You / I don’t like you at the end bugs me, but other than this song is such a vibe

**frogaranaman** (8): LMAOOOOO

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): this bops but something is a bit off about it

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): the spoken word parts sound eerily like Dua Lipa

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): charming delivery and a nice beat can go pretty far

**runaway3212** (7): kinda meh compared to the rest so far but still great

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this one is kinda catchy, so I'm gonna try to give it a positive score

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): Tyler going out first was expected, this was a bit higher until the last influx of ballots but I think the placement is fair. It’s v pretty and the marriage of both halves is really unique. But could it be shorter? Probably

**steelstepladder** (10): And here we have the final Tyler song, bowing out at number 9. Tyler was always slated to do the worst in this rate so I'm super glad his best song was able to squeak into the top 10. 

---

# Appelle-moi si tu te perds, Tyler

**modulum83** (11): i'll always associate this song with the long commutes i took to work over summer and being able to blast this with the windows down every day. ten full minutes of pure pop bliss. i feel like i'm instantly soaring through clouds every time i hear this; it's never ever gotten old.

**Stryxen** (11): yeah this song is like my entire personality it’s just perfect i was silly for thinking i would 11 anything else

**akanewasright** (10): man… this song is perfect at beginning to disarm Tyler emotionally on the album. It’s pretty impeccable to me through both parts

**bbfan132** (10): :glitterfloating:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Stream Fana Hues - Hues, a GREAT R&B album from 2020!!!!!

**fadedblue09** (10): if he separated these 2 songs this album would've gotten an extra 10

**frogaranaman** (10): I am going to quickly and violently off myself into another dimension

**IIIHenryIII** (10): oh, fuck, almost ten minutes long??? Good thing I dig long songs, and this one is no exception

**iniekcja\_** (10): save a dance for me tonight, wait for me, no compromise

**KingKabs** (10): another contender for 11 I was amazed by it

**MrMoodle** (10): i’ve got hyper-stimulated zoomer brain syndrome so making a song ten minutes long and NOT having me be bored is a feat

**plastichaxan** (10): we love almost 10 minute long bops

**seanderlust** (10): it's tempting to put this as my favorite tyler two-parter. it's just so smooth and yet overflowing with emotion. fana is the perfect addition to the track. that "i wish that we had better timing" outro.......no i'm NOT crying my EYES just happen to be WET it's ALLERGIES OK

**shipperondeck** (10): i already liked the second half but it got 10000x better when i saw it live and the entire crowd was singing, was lowkey emotional lol (and tyler said our city had the best energy during this song so <3)

**skargardin** (10): I have a slight fear of this being robbed, hopefully I'm wrong!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if i give this a 10 will you all stop making fun if me for giving impossible soul a 0

**UselessTacooo** (10): trancendant

**you2009** (10): romance...

**thedoctordances1940** (9.9): sweet thots

**team\_kockroach** (9.8): i didn’t get this song for the longest time, but it’s incredible how it hides Tyler’s emotions of regret and heartbrokenness behind the cheery neo-soul song. Even more so than 911/Mr. Lonely or Fucking Young/Perfect

**1998tweety** (9): tiktok smasha

**Awkward\_King** (9): i wish kali was on this track :( normalise kali/tyler collabs again

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): longsongphobia is gonna tear this one apart but it's just so good and, well, sweet

**ImADudeDuh** (9): damn i can’t complain about this being too short

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): for how long the song is

**SmileAndTears** (9): Goes on for way too long but I love it anyway

**whydideveribother** (9): Ah yes, I also remember Igor.

**camerinian** (8.5): how are both pieces of this so wildly different and yet also totally cohesive and equally as fantastic as each other (although maybe part 2 goes on a bit long tbh)

**afs** (8): SYNTHS ?!

**celladonn** (8): I would complain about the length if this wasn't so thoroughly pleasant the whole way through

**Neighbourly** (8): pretty good but its a lot

**runaway3212** (8): Brockhampton out of a job omg/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKYSlLoIodE

# Ne m'appelle pas, Tyler

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): fuck artists putting two different songs together as one, i still don't fully forgive lorde for attaching Loveless to Hard Feelings

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Wanted to like this more than I did. The atonal sample-like melodies that Tyler loves to use are at their best when they’re haunting the edges of his world, bringing them to the forefront felt like a kind of mistake because it highlighted their weaknesses. The back half is actually nice and has some good storytelling to it but I wish this had just been two separate tracks so I could give the part I liked a better score

**throwaway92720392720** (7): Sweet is like a 4 for me, and I Thought You Wanted To Dance is a 10

**welcome2thejam** (7): Between this and Lumberjack, consider me officially worried Tyler is snatching some of his hooks from bad joke books

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): I wish i thought you wanted to dance was a separate track because thats really nice but I hate how long it takes to get to that point

**ignitethephoenix** (6): should have been 2 separate tracks, and sweet is much worse than the second track

**TiltControls** (6): Just drags on a little too long. I'm not opposed to long songs on this album, but this one could've done more / been more compact.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): sweet a 3, itywtd a 7, round ‘em up.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): way too long

**just\_thonking** (4.5): Sorry this is too long and I do not enjoy his singing

**Overall Average**: 7.674 **// Average Controversy:** 1.664

sufjancaesar: I’m not as crazy about this album as I am about Tyler’s previous stuff. A lot of the tracks come and go very quickly and never commit or go as hard as they can. It definitely works better as an overall piece than individual tracks, but I wish it accomplished both. For that reason, I knew it wouldn’t do very well and that’s ultimately quite deserved to me in this lineup. Nonetheless, there’s some sick highs on here and the visuals in this era were absolutely remarkable!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.844): this album is really fun. I think I kinda overrated it when it came out but I do still think it's one of the best albums of 2020.

**iniekcja\_** (8.688): I have to admit Tyler's music never really clicked with me. Even though this undeniably is a really good project and he's an insanely talented artist, I do not feel the things I feel when listening to the other three albums here. It's objectively great, it just sadly doesn't hit all the right spots for me.

**modulum83** (8.644): My favorite album of 2021. CMIYGL is an album dedicated to maturing, to affirming that you are in a better place than you've ever been, and to pursuing your dreams. In many ways it's like a coming-of-age movie - one that I could rewatch over and over, motivating me to never stop rising to a challenge.

**frogaranaman** (8.500): so good live. he made fun of a fan for getting puke on their merch when I saw him. fan deserved it btw

**shipperondeck** (8.481): popheads is going to tank most of this album bc it goes harder than IGOR overall and ppl wont respect dj drama OR gangsta grills and all of that feels a little.... you know.... very much like popheads if you get me

**Awkward\_King** (8.344): i don't know what i can say about this album that i haven't already said or i didn't say in my writeup, but i just think it's a really tight body of work. i think this album is better viewed and evaluated as part of tyler's whole body of work and trajectory, beginning as an edgy cult mixtape artist, branching through different genres at his own pace until critically he was finally re-evaluated with the releases of Flower Boy and IGOR. so to me CMIYGL is kind of a victory lap, and not just because of the braggadocious themes of the lyrics, but even the arrangement of it is much more reminiscent of his earlier work being more alt-rap heavy. the styling of the album and era is just brilliant too, and tyler has so many brilliant lyrical moments. while i don't know if i would say every track is exceptional and stands out on its own, as a body of work, it is phenomenal.

**cremeebrulee** (8.262): this album kind of works better as a unit than individual songs so i’m not gonna be surprised when it gets battered 💀 it’s still one of my favorite releases of my past year despite what these results will say xx

**akanewasright** (8.031): People have kind of been ignoring how thematically rich this album is. Like… admittedly the deliberately fragmented nature of this album doesn’t lend itself to this kind of analysis during track by track rating, but like. There is a pretty distinct plot, throughline, and thematic payoff in this album, making it a really good listen if you care about that stuff. It’s gonna get robbed, and that’ll make me mad

**welcome2thejam** (8.000): Strong production and Tyler is so fun in this sound and opulent aesthetic.

**skargardin** (8.000): Off the other Tyler albums I've heard, I definitely prefer IGOR and Flower Boy, they have more highs than CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST for me. Still not a bad album by any means, I just wish there were more definite highlights.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.981): it's a good album definitely but after a strong start it does start to tail off a bit and idk i think that's what really stopped me from coming back to a lot but I do like what it's going for and I think dj drama's parts throughout the record really help with that.

**team\_kockroach** (7.975): Feature verses ranked from best to worst: 1. Youngboy, 2. Lil Uzi Vert, 3. Fana Hues, 4. 42 Dugg, 5. Lil Wayne, 6. Pharrell Williams, 7. Domo Genesis (but they’re all great)

**seanderlust** (7.775): having done the 2021 AOTY writeup for this one, i'm inclined to be a fan of it. while its average is dragged down a bit by interludes and shorter tracks that i would argue didn't need to be there, i was happy to get to do the write-up because the highs on this album are HIGH. it's luxurious, it's well-travelled, it's a glorious send-up to the mixtapes of the mid-2000s. if you weren't a fan of this one but it was your first time, i would honestly encourage you to stick with it and replay songs for a while - this album is a grower and has some really interesting thematic throughlines that are tough to catch on the first couple listens.

**whydideveribother** (7.563): It's nice to hear Tyler having fun.

**plastichaxan** (7.500): I wanted to give this another chance, and I might do, but if you’re reading this, chances are I either forgot or decided it wasn’t the best choice, I don’t know why, it just didn’t click with me and while this average isn’t the worst I don’t know if I’m just rating on this scale to be nice or if I genuinely like it but just compared to the other 3 it falls short so yeah I’m not sure yet, and I’ve had this issue since release so...

**IIIHenryIII** (7.344): He really didn't let us forget the horrible album title; kept name dropping it in every single fucking song. Anyway, it's a pretty good album, but it's not something I'd miss if it never got released.

**TiltControls** (7.281): I found it to be the weakest of the 4, though it's like comparing amazing to good

**afs** (7.156): this album definitely required the most time to get used to. even then, it still gets the lowest score since this is pretty much the polar opposite of what I normally listen to. still, there are some great tracks on it, so I don't regret this listen!

**just\_thonking** (7.031): I don't think I'll ever fully "get" Tyler the Creator but this is solid. Kind of drags in the middle though and I am just not a fan of his singing

**bigbigbee** (7.031): The flute on this album reminds me of, um, the gem finding levels in Sonic Adventure 2?

**Neighbourly** (6.813): I dno I never feel any need to go back to this album. It's pretty good but not as strong as the others here, a few misses and skips too don't help

**Roxieloxie** (6.419): I saw that people werent enjoying this as much and expected to latch onto it cause i tend to with those albums but i just dont think i enjoy it! Im not sure how much of that is that i tend to not interact with tyler outside of the occasional earfquake stream because,,, yeah,,, or that all of it just kinda felt like one long song outside of the two long songs that I wish were separated. This is my first project from tyler and while i didnt hate it, i dont really feel a desire to to go listen to anything else from him or return to the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.250): https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ4-56Ashtz/?utm_medium=copy_link

**fadedblue09** (5.406): I wish I had something unique to say about this album, but sadly I’ll just echo everyone else’s thoughts. Most of the songs here feel experimental without any huge payoff and don’t really feel like developed enough ideas. Some of the features and certain production choices feel like deliberately sabotaging the album.

**team\_kockroach** (10): it’s hard to overstate how fun this is. .Paak would love this beat

**UselessTacooo** (10): I think it's massively underrated among fans and deserves more respect. People rarely point out how amazing the song is, and that should be changed.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Thank god this picks the album back up after that ass interlude. Just wanna hear Simz ride this beat forever, and the combo makes me wanna get up and move

**whydideveribother** (10): Oh my god, this thing is absolutely phenomenal.

**sufjancaesar** (10): When I first heard this album, this went on repeat for a while. It’s such an addictive chorus that also manages to be really calming and comforting. I love the background atmosphere created by the production

**steelstepladder** (10): When I heard this song the first time I knew I was listening to a classic. For the album to give moment after moment of genre hopping we get an absolutely lovely little ballad that makes me happy as hell everytime I listen to it. An absolutely delightful little detour that ends up adding so much to the album.

# A Heartfelt Story About This Song

**camerinian** (11): This was not an initial favourite of mine on my first few listens through this album. I gravitated more to the energetic and genre-bent wild stuff more than the slower, reflective tracks towards the end. And yet, a year later and this song has somehow become an almost daily listen. The fishing allegory for getting constantly hit with shitty luck and a spiralling mental state is inspired, and I just love how the determination to keep going even when the universe seems to have it out for you is conveyed. The piano and backing vocals are gorgeous and lush and push the message of that bleary-eyed optimism so well. This song has soundtracked nearly every early morning walk to work of mine, not just for the obvious "rise and shine" refrain, but because the feeling of facing the day despite what might be thrown at you resonates real hard, because today might be the day you land the big one, but you'll never know if you don't get out there and face it.

**Roxieloxie** (11): the pophead user roxieloxian urge to give an 11 to either the only song I knew before a rate or some random deepcut i've latched onto. This being the first song I knew from the album made me think that overall it would sound a bit different than what it ended up sounding but its alright. I'd heard steel play this before in beatsense but it wasnt until /u/tiltcontrols used it as an interlude while we hosted 60s that I remembered that it existed. One particularly melodramatic weekend of being a college student I just ended up listening to this a bunch and I love how melodic it was while thematically being this very desperate song of trying and failing to get better because like #mood But yeah I really love this song, doing this rate was partially a last minute decision so I could 11 this because im not sure if its loved well enough to be all stars material.

**seanderlust** (11): okay, sincere comment coming. my partner and i recently scheduled a getaway to an air bnb in a woodsy area in my state. he works in a hospital that has been nonstop overwhelmed with COVID the last couple years and it's taken a toll on everyone who works there's mental and physical health. this trip was meant to put some literal distance between him and the place that i suspect has given him PTSD over the past two years. we were driving along the freeway and this song came on and at his request, we listened to it on loop while he took snapchats of the scenery around us as we drove. it was the freest either of us have felt in a long time. this song is playing a pivotal role in our healing, and for that it is an easy 11.

# A Comment About This Song

**akanewasright** (10): This song is so lovely and sweet sounding

**Awkward\_King** (10): a song that feels like it could have existed forever, it is so comforting it amazes me this song hasnt just always existed it feels so classic, i love it

**bbfan132** (10): :floating:

**BeauMeringue212** (10): one of the least hip hop songs on the rate, but I love this song. Genesis' voice is really emotive, and he really sells it on this song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://i.pinimg.com/564x/60/01/67/6001673c2d25ad0e22b510355a779441.jpg

**DefaultPophead** (10): Really connected with this one.

**just\_thonking** (10): I feel like on the surface this song is a bit silly but it's actually a very nice reflection on despair/loneliness and persevering despite it all

**MrMoodle** (10): was going to give this my 0 in protest of the industrial fishing complex but then he clarified it was a fishless lake so we’re cool

**runaway3212** (10): OH MY GOODNESS THIS SONG IS SO AMAZING I AM IN LOVE

**Stryxen** (10): this song just makes me feel so many feelings and i think this is simply a masterpiece… the more i think about it, i just HAVE to 11 this (i didn’t lol - this rate is stacked)

**team\_kockroach** (10): Back in 2009, Eminem came back from a five-year hiatus with “Beautiful”, a rap-rock single about depression and feeling out of his depth as a successful celebrity rapper. I played the shit out of that song throughout eighth grade…looking back, I should’ve listened to this gorgeous ballad of self-love instead. Just like “Beautiful”, ASAF gives incredible catharsis from a heavy, anger-ridden album.

**TiltControls** (10): talk about fish in a song and I'll probably give you a 10 (baby shark dni!)

**UselessTacooo** (10): Acoustic Owusu is the best Owusu

**welcome2thejam** (10): A lot gets said about Genesis playing with different sounds and genre, and I think this incredibly executed curveball is the best example of it.

**whydideveribother** (10): I fucking love this weird little thing

**celladonn** (9.5): Lovely

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): jerry seinfeld voice It’s a song about fishing

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): The way he switches genres throughout this album so effortlessly is impressive honestly

**modulum83** (8.6): oddly comforting

**afs** (8.5): spoiler: there was no fishing

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): king gizz's fishing song outsold because it actually has an anti-fishing message

**plastichaxan** (8): it was indeed a song about fishing

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Ween pastiche?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I hate how when he said rise and shine, I thought about that Kylie Jenner video … my brain is rotted

**shipperondeck** (7.5): i wish for him to catch a multitude of fishes in his next cast

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): MILF (man, i love fishing)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): an odd song but I like it

**Neighbourly** (7): again love this attempt and it sort of works but I think in the scope of the whole album it just doesn't totally gel. Cool song anyway.

**frogaranaman** (6): heterosexual

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this is the kinda sound I dig, but his voice is a turn down here

**sufjancaesar** (10): Dropping this right before summer was the perfect time. It’s so sunny, warm and Cleo Sol’s feature is perfect. Simz’s verses are a little corny but that’s what this goes for, it’s meant to make you feel loved at the most fundamental level. From start to finish, I love everything about this and almost 11d it

---

# Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow


**akanewasright** (11): Introvert was the perfect first statement to release, but this was the single where I knew how much I’d love this album. It’s brilliant, but also just soft and lovely and sweet. It was hell to pick an 11 for this rate, but I went with my most played song, and it’s the right 11 tbh

**Awkward\_King** (10): i just think this is one of the best songs ever made, its smooth as fuck, the references simz scatters throughout are so smart and so cute, its such a lovely uplifiting song its a wonder i have ~250 plays of it and still am severely mentally ill tbh!!! i also think the video is one of my favourites of all time. also gonna put forward my writeup for the popheads 2021 soty list.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this song is self care

**bbfan132** (10): <3 love this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): little simz :handshake: doja cat | songs called 'woman' that are gonna make the top 10 but won’t be the top song of their albums even if they should

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Divine

**frogaranaman** (10): Jo March in Little Women

**iniekcja\_** (10): Simz and Cleo Sól are a true match made in heaven, this brings so much nostalgia and memories of the time I first heard Selfish live before it was released

**just\_thonking** (10): my 11 in the indieheads rate but I opted for PAK instead. They're both gonna lose to introvert anyways so who cares

**KingKabs** (10): contender for 11 it's amazing. Just amazing.

**Neighbourly** (10): great followup to the opener. good messaging.

**nt96** (10): A surefire Top 5 contender

**plastichaxan** (10): i don’t think even i’m aware of how many times a day i get “i love how you go from 0 to 100” stuck on my head

**runaway3212** (10): doja cat outsold a lil bit

**seanderlust** (10): this is a winner contender and for good reason. it's a beautiful sendup to the power, intelligence and empathy of womanhood that concludes nicely with simbi's mom lightly reading her. gotta love it.

**skargardin** (10): Cleo Sol on this chorus >>>>

**static\_int\_husp** (10): As a contrast to Introvert, this is such a comforting song. But it's just as confident and empowering.

**Stryxen** (10): am i a feminist?? tyler the creator is cool WHAT???

**TiltControls** (10): Has the unfortunate task of following up the explosiveness of Introvert and yet it's still a 10! The delivery is definitely a lot more low-key, but Simz does so well at that type of song

**UselessTacooo** (10): Probably top 3 favorite songs on the album. It is such a simple theme, but the execution is perfect

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): i feel like i was sleeping on this for way too long, it absolutely is one of the best tracks on this album

**modulum83** (9.7): now THIS is an opener, though. the production is absolutely gorgeous and fun and laid-back at the same time; every time simz does that "yeah yeah" flow my neurotransmitters light up. this song is so filled with real, genuine positivty and i love it.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): all songs with the word woman in it are good I don’t make the rules. edit - jk I forgot I don’t like Harry Styles version

**BeauMeringue212** (9): tbh the lyrics got a bit Facebook quotes after a few listens but still a lovely song. Cleo's voice is heavenly

**welcome2thejam** (9): Give the great women in your life their flowers while you still can

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): i just think that women

**afs** (8.5): stereotypes 101

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): one thing i really love about this song is how it shouts out all the woman in african countries, i feel like in any other female empowerment song they never really acknowledge women from that part of the world so to hear a song namedrop them specifically and dedicate several verses to them is really special

**team\_kockroach** (8.4): I hear some Jay-Z influence on the verse structure, like some “Song Cry” vibes. Absolutely lovely

**shipperondeck** (8.2): ngl if i were being purely subjective this score would be lower bc i personally don't like this one that much

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I just think that women

**uberpigeon** (8): ya never pick up the fone!!!!

# Woman to woman, I just wanna see you 0

**bigbigbee** (6.5): All songs that highlight individual people one by one remind me of S Club Party by S Club 7

**IIIHenryIII** (3): woman by Doja is a much better song, and I'm not even a fan of that one. This one is just so joyless

**seanderlust** (10): this is one of the coolest songs i've ever heard. this entire album was a favorite during 2020.

**MrMoodle** (9.5): these guys seem like dorks but i can’t make it not bop

**sufjancaesar** (10): So relieved this made top 5, stellar track. What I love so much about this album is how every song feels complete from start to finish. It’s v difficult to call anything here unfinished and this track is a great example. Her emotional lyrics are only intensified by the grandiose production - which builds up perfectly into the emotional ending

---

# “I Love You”

**indie\_fan\_** (11): I relate to this song far more than I'd like to, really.

**akanewasright** (10): I always forget how incredible this song is. Like by the end, I feel like I’ve been punched in the gut

**apatel27** (10): What a perfect instrumental mix

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): damn, some of these lines are absolutely cutting

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Simz really captured the complex push and pull feelings she has toward her dad in a way that many will recognise and relate to

**camerinian** (10): delicious. Finally some good fucking therapy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): god this is such a strong song lyrically and in concept like mwah

**fadedblue09** (10): Love how her flow weaves with the instrumental here

**iniekcja\_** (10): still perplexed it's not a sample

**Neighbourly** (10): majestic

**seanderlust** (10): get his ass

**skargardin** (10): man this song is so insanely powerful, so much raw emotion

**UselessTacooo** (10): I think this track is a career highlight. Something about it grabs me and doesn’t let me go until the song ends. It was a perfect single choice, and without it, I doubt the album would reach the same highs it does.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Maybe her strongest song content-wise, just a raw, effective look into such a complicated relationship

**team\_kockroach** (9.9): outsold “The Blacker the Berry”

**celladonn** (9.5): The emotions here... what a great song

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): daddy issues have never sounded so good

**TiltControls** (9.5): the build up near the end is fantastic

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): slightly overrated maybe but definitely still amazing

**afs** (9): the sample should've been used only when it's supposed to be noticed, but fortunately it gets ignorable later

**Awkward\_King** (9): i honestly wouldnt hesitate to call this one of the best written songs of all time idc. the way the second and third verses build to such dramatic ends, the way the topic of the song and the story is slowly made more clear, its really poignant. my one complaint would be how repetetive the production can be, but that's more of a personal thing for sure.

**shipperondeck** (8.5): love her use of orchestral elements. also these lyrics are powerful like.....wow

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): These background noises are putting in WORK!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i got all these daddy issues What can I do? I'm going crazy when I'm with you

# “I Hate You”

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): on one hand this is lyrically some of the most interesting and engaging work on the album, on the other hand I don’t care was much for the actual sound of the song as most of the album

**modulum83** (6.7): the orchestral flourishes make you believe you're listening to a more dynamic and versatile song than the extended diary entry that this one is. by the three-minute mark, you're going "okay, cool, i get the idea."

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I hate that I love you, don't want to… oops, wrong song

**runaway3212** (6): fine

**sufjancaesar** (9): As the ballots kept increasing, this track just kept rising and rising up the ranks. I expected a top 3 spot for it eventually but I’ll take this. It’s just a goddamm bop and doesn’t let the energy down until the outro. Like most of this album, it’s also very unique

**steelstepladder** (10):  Oh Genesis you were doing so well!! For far and away the least popular artist in the rate, getting into the top four against the other quality albums in this rate is so good! And this song in particular is SUCH a great banger as well!! 

---

# THIS! SONG! GOES! HARD!

**BeauMeringue212** (11): The beat is so ominous and the song really establishes the black dog motif that's so core to the album. One of those dark songs that you find yourself also dancing to

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this has 11 potential. Nvm, it is my actual 11.

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**apatel27** (10): Layers on Layers

**Awkward\_King** (10): i always forget this is as much of a bop as it is

**bigbigbee** (10): I don’t even think this is scary but it has like a mildly Halloween-y sound to it that I fucks with heavily

**camerinian** (10): I really thought for the longest time that Genesis had a line that said "live for trans rights, smoke a Blairite" and now I'm disappointed he wasn't just spending a verse shitting on the UK

**celladonn** (10): Thinking about how the floor collapsed when he performed this at his concert i went to... his power

**CrimsonROSET** (10): love throwing ass to a song about depression

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): post-punk with ODB-energy style intro I’m in complete heaven

**frogaranaman** (10): this is the sonic equivalent of talking yourself out of an oncoming anxiety attack

**MrMoodle** (10): i love this dude’s delivery, the kinda staccato vocal stabs in the chorus, don’t know what it is but it scratches the right crevice in my brain

**Neighbourly** (10): amazing introduction

**RandomHypnotica** (10): make it deep inside... my hole??? 😳

**Roxieloxie** (10): finally some good fucking food. This shit is so fucking good, Please let this song win

**seanderlust** (10): instrumental: :D lyrics: D:

**UselessTacooo** (10): There is something so infectious about the way Genesis performs his music, and this is a perfect showing of it. It’s engaging, it’s fun, and it’s the whole package.

**welcome2thejam** (10): First track's good and all, but I'll be real and say majority of the time, this is where I press play on the album. An instant jolt. Tunes that play with a contrast of sound and lyrics can be very interesting (and he does it a lot on this album), and this one spells it out right away with a favorite: "All my friends are hurting but we dance it off, laugh it off"

**you2009** (9.9): roadrunner flow

**bbfan132** (9.5): bop!!! and the outro is perfect too

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Genesis's album was the only one that I had not heard before this rate. However this coming as the second song absolutely slaps and made me know that it was a great choice for this rate.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): I! WANT! TO! BE! YOUR! NUM! BER! ONE!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): banger innit

**team\_kockroach** (9.1): I wanna karaoke this when covid ends, strange outro and all

**afs** (9): Iori, Ramon and the Snoop Doggs found wigless

**runaway3212** (9): Sirius Black you better watch your back

**skargardin** (9): wait.. I wasn't expecting this to be so dancey

**akanewasright** (8.5): This man just OOZES charisma like blood oozes from an Australian snake’s bite… I can do better than this joke I swear

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I love the way he just POUNDS this one out

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I love the nervous energy in this track

**modulum83** (8): i will drop my ass to this one

**TiltControls** (8): I love the flow of lyrics here, especially during the chorus

**uberpigeon** (8): he IS looking like a snack

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the production is so interesting and I love all the elements in incorporates all

**shipperondeck** (7.8): i like this guy

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): much boppier than I expected, I really love the production here even if the vocal stylings aren’t totally my thing

# THIS! SONG! IS! MID!

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): are y'all sure this is hip hop? Sonically this is awesome, but I can't stand his voice. Did he swallow a frog?

**seanderlust** (9.327): towards the end of 2021, i had actually never heard this album. i took a chance on it after hearing don't need you as an interlude in a rate, and boy am i glad it did. it quickly rose to be one of my favorite albums of the year, and it is one that i can tell is going to stick with me. genesis' witty and observant lyrics over lush soundscapes is fine enough on the surface, but digging a little deeper you find he finds this really interesting through-line between the two black dogs. overall, especially for a debut album, this is a phenomenal record

**plastichaxan** (9.167): hello??? this is definitely one of the best albums from last year to me, and you’re telling me it’s his debut??? like this man has only just begun and already released such a versatile, cohesive and incredible body of work just wow

**welcome2thejam** (9.133): Debut album and the dude's already hit a home run with my favorite album of last year and, for me, an instant classic. Wild that he could put songs like The Other Black Dog, Gold Chains, Drown, No Looking Back, and A Song About Fishing all on the same tracklist, and it still feels cohesive and in-line with his vision. Anyway, I'm all in on the Genesis Owusu bandwagon and I can't wait to see what he does next. Also, shoutout to him for drinking Malört after his concert!

**MrMoodle** (9.067): so glad we’re rating this album, there were probably more obvious picks that fit the theme of this rate but i like a curveball

**2dina3dworld** (8.933): funky

**iniekcja\_** (8.867): I have made many people fall in love with this album and I'm still happy about it. He shows so much versatility, pulling from many various genres, but it still makes sense all together, making an impressive, cohesive body of work. Easily a top 3 album from last year.

**Neighbourly** (8.800): Fantastic debut, one of my most listened albums all year. Just a bit all over the place is my only critique. A more focused sophomore vision will yield this guy an all time classic for sure.

**skargardin** (8.800): I really didn't know what to expect when I first listened to this, needless to say my expectations were met and then some. It's so sonically diverse yet cohesive. I will definitely be returning to this in the future.

**Roxieloxie** (8.713): oh neat I wasn’t expecting to enjoy this album as much seeing as I only knew the one song that sounded nothing like anything else but it was nice!

**just\_thonking** (8.633): This album makes me smile with a lot of teeth

**SmileAndTears** (8.500): What a stellar debut album. Every time I revisit this album I like it a little bit more. Easily my favourite album in this rate.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.500): Probably my favourite album in this rate. Genesis blurs and moves across genres so effortlessly and the album was very cohesive

**afs** (8.400): super impressive debut album! i'm not much of a hip-hop head, but the genres blending here as well as his impressive skills makes it pretty much impossible to ignore this. how is he only 23?!

**whydideveribother** (8.400): The only new album I listened to for this rate and I am so happy I did, one of the most unique and colourful projects in here.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.367): I don’t wanna brag, but I knew about him before this rate 😎

**akanewasright** (8.353): God I love Genesis Owusu. I think all of these albums have a few areas where they trump the other albums, and I think he has the most charisma (on top of the most versatility). Like I just *like* him

**team\_kockroach** (8.160): This feels like Travis Scott’s Rodeo if he made every feature himself. I don’t think Bowie himself could’ve handled so many genre changes

**shipperondeck** (8.100): this was really sweet i want to be this guy's friend

**letsallpoo** (8.067): honestly might be my aoty. usually when you hear about acclaimed albums that blend genres they turn out to be boring as fuck but this is just slapper after slapper

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.000): dang, I hadn't heard this album before the rate and I really wish I had, it's really cool and unique

**modulum83** (7.780): Love the concept of this album overall, but I won't pretend that one side didn't resonate with me a lot more than the other - there's some truly great writing about depression here that is, uniquely, genuinely uplifting and healing.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.760): While I did enjoy this album, I never really completely bought into all the hype it got, it definitely has some tracks I don't care for too much but at the same time it has some absolutely bangers and quite a few really good tracks, there's a lot of potential here at the very least.

**bigbigbee** (7.667): OOH this album is so good, love the almost 80s rock influences (?) and the sheer diversity

**Awkward\_King** (7.567): the motif of black dogs throughout this album is really awesome, this album is brilliant production wise and lyrically and i cant wait to see where genesis goes

**frogaranaman** (7.533): this album is so good I wish I wasn't so lonely

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.433): overall it’s a bit hit or miss for me but when it hits it REALLY hits. i’m so mad im not able to 11 whip cracker but simz has my heart in this rate

**cremeebrulee** (7.020): i do like how more funk/soul-infused this album is, but i feel like genesis's writing is a step below the other 3 albums in the rate. it's by no means bad, just a little more sparse than the others. i will say this is probably the most consistent album in the rate tho

**fadedblue09** (6.700): This album was a surprise. I enjoyed the various sonic influences of the record, especially the neo-soul tinges, and he has a very charismatic delivery. A handful of duds in the middle almost ruined it for me but it eventually recovers in the end

**IIIHenryIII** (4.700): Initial thoughts: I had a hard time with this one. Listening to it in its entirety was exhausting and almost made me give up on this rate. I really dislike this one. Update: I actually like this sonically, but still can't stand his voice. I realized that's what made my first listen so insufferable.

**sufjancaesar** (11): Very early in the rate, this was winning lmao…was a huge but welcome shock. Dare I say this is one of my favourite tracks ever? If RTJ never released anything else, this feels like a closer to their whole career, not just RTJ4. Amazing production aside, the build-up is emotional, energizing, enraging and more. It’s a culmination of all their music has ever been about. And don’t get me started on that pretty ass outro, feels like a quick glimpse at a cathartic ride into the sunset post-revolution

**steelstepladder** (10): WHAT A CLOSER!!! The song that was actually in first after the first 10 ballots is more than deserving of the top 3 finish. One of the best closers of the entire year and when you realize this was released in the same year as IKTE, that's saying something

---

# Best 7 minutes of my LIFE

**afs** (11): horns improve everything tbh, including horniness

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): uggghhhhhh picking my 11 for this rate was super hard but I just have to give it to this song. this song feels like el-p and killer mike releasing all of the pain and anguish they have over the song's runtime, with the song building and building until it explodes into a massive saxophone solo. it's big, it's cathartic, it's heart wrenching, and it's ending the album on a statement of resilience and defiance. plus the ending skit/verse/whatever is a great end to the album, it feels like the ending credits to an action movie that sets up the sequel and lets you know that these two WILL be back for more. it's also a nice, amusing, lighthearted comedown after all of the intensity and never fails to put a smile on my face. I know this probably doesn't have the best chances of winning but I think it's probably one of the best songs of the past five years.

**KingKabs** (11): like... a masterpiece? Sonically, rhythmically, lyrically... I can keep going? Amazing

**nt96** (11): The menacing beat, the lyricism, the saxophones, the build up feels like world's gonna collapse on itself at any moment. This rate's without a doubt the toughest to find your 11, but upon VERY careful consideration, this song just got me really choked up. For that, this gets 11.

**thedoctordances1940** (11): genuinely fucking incredible, the beat throughout the first half is fucking incredible, the sparse saxophone oh my fucking god and then the saxophone solo is just this incredible moment of that builds up and up and ultimately kinda leads to nothing really? But it fucking works brilliantly with the outro then bringing back the yankee and the brave theme from the intro, just an amazing closer

**apatel27** (10): What a great outro

**Awkward\_King** (10): genius

**bbfan132** (10): what an outro…

**bigbigbee** (10): this is an absolutely insane closer. Perfection. Almost got my 11.

**camerinian** (10): Yaaaaay! The rapture!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): longsongphobia please spare this i am begging

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): as a basic jazz gyal I went “is that Kamasi Washington????” but it’s the saxophonist from the Dap Kings which also a slay. Anyway yeah this is the best closer in the rate.

**DefaultPophead** (10): The whole album is kinda mid but likeable, but this one blows most of the songs out of the water imo

**fadedblue09** (10): just some top notch storytelling

**MrMoodle** (10): this might be like the best song i’ve ever heard but genesis owusu needs my energy so no 11 for RTJ sorry 😔

**Neighbourly** (10): stop it

**plastichaxan** (10): i’ve never ascended so hard doing a rate what the fuck

**runaway3212** (10): slay endening

**skargardin** (10): what an incredible way to close the album with, im floored honestly

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Love an RTJ closing track. The raw anger, the desperation knowing they only have 6 minutes left to make their case, and of course some killer sax.

**Stryxen** (10): well this completely blew me away - deserved to close out the ballot too tbh

**team\_kockroach** (10): y’all better give this a 9.3+ average. This would be an 11 in any other rate - hell, it’s probably the best song in either KM’s or El-P’s discography, with how the verses build off one another to finish in that sax solo. Fuck I wanna hear this live.

**UselessTacooo** (10): I came, I saw, I came

**welcome2thejam** (10): I got chills, man. Think this might be an all-timer album closer.

**you2009** (10): when the sax comes in...

**modulum83** (9.7): fucking love this. a cyborg cowboy anthem

**seanderlust** (9.3): god what an incredible build in this song to the glorious saxophone. I feel like this will be tanked because of the outro skit. I hope it won't because it bangs, but I think it might be

**just\_thonking** (9): very grand

**shipperondeck** (9): the buildup. the 3/4 time. the sax. the bars. this song is fucking epic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): FUCK YES!!!!! SAXOPHONE SOLOS!!!!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): finally some good fucking food. It only took the entire album to get there

**TiltControls** (8.5): fantastic end to a fantastic album

# Damn, that shit was long

**uberpigeon** (8): the end is here

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): i am SHOCKED that this apparently ISN'T sampling Never Tear Us Apart???

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This feels too long but looking at the lyrics there’s nothing I’d really cut so maybe I’m just lazy

**frogaranaman** (7): me facing the Chernobyl mob

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I tend to like long songs, but this one hasn't clicked with me yet

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the last minute was very unnecessary and made me dock a point cause I thought it was over. The rest of it was solid though

**sufjancaesar** (10): So fucking glad this is our runner-up. The chorus is such a simple and effective metaphor for the black experience. When an earworm can be this resonant, you know this is some good shit. They recorded this album a while before the 2020 protests, so ofcourse it’s truly mad how relevant this managed to be!

**steelstepladder** (11): My 11, my sweet, you came so close. RTJ put up more of a fight in this rate than most people were expecting but unfortunately they come up just short. But wow what a song this is. This would be haunting at any point but the way this was released during the summer of 2020 and recorded before the killing of George Floyd just puts this on another level. I think we all needed something to give some release during that miserable miserable year and this song (and by extension this album) just hit me harder more than almost anything released in this period

---

# “Just got done walkin' in the snow”


**bigbigbee** (11): One of the few times a live performance of a song surpassed the original, for me. Their Adult Swim performance is just chilling. Oh, and I don’t think that this is controversial, but I think that this song has the best lyrics in the entire rate

**celladonn** (11): fuuuuuuuuck

**frogaranaman** (11): the fact that this was recorded before George Floyd is just plain chilling

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This song just left me in awe the first time I heard it. Obviously Mike's verse was the more talked about one, for good reason. The "I can't breathe" line was unfortunately given new relevance in June 2020 in the wake of George Floyd's murder, but the fact that it was written months before mainly as a refernce to Eric Garner, among others. It's such a powerful line, and the continued relevance is so heartbreaking. To move over to El-P's verse, it's amazing how he can weave an explanation of how oppression works, and how those above us will always work towards the next opressed groups, while still keeping such an immaculate flow. And in contrast, Mike sums this up in his own verse as well, in a single line: "Never forget in the story of Jesus, the hero was killed by the state". This is maybe the prime example of how their two lyrical styles, El-P being surgical and Mike being blunt, work so fantastically together.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the tension is immaculate, gangsta boo gives one of the best hooks in the rate, and killer mike's verse is the best in the rate

**Awkward\_King** (10): never has an album been released at more of a perfect time, the poignancy of these lyrics especially being released in june of 2020 was wild

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I think the lyrics of this song speak for themselves.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): often political songs can feel like they're full of agreeable platitudes so songs like this are a breath of fresh air

**camerinian** (10): sociopaths are in control of the world's major powers and convincing far too many people that they have their interests at heart, and there's been so much conditioning to just accept that as how life is. It's small comfort, but having a track like this to remind us of that fact and to never be complacent is vital right now.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): did you expect it to be hot??

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): We want to hear Tear Da Club Up 97 as an interlude

**fadedblue09** (10): Straight-up fire

**MrMoodle** (10): killer mike verse is insane

**Neighbourly** (10): omg

**nt96** (10): Twitter's been real quiet since homeboy popped off. All text and no action.

**plastichaxan** (10): i’ve never walked in the snow but if it’s as yass as this song sign me up

**seanderlust** (10): a lot of attention gets paid to the "I can't breathe line" especially given the timing (for good reason - the story of that line is really telling), but i also have to log that the line about the story of jesus made me have to sit down the first time i heard it

**shipperondeck** (10): genuinely haunting that mike pretty much predicted floyd's death here but unfortunately it's not unbelievable because this evil shit with cops keeps repeating in america.

**skargardin** (10): this is so insanely good

**Stryxen** (10): the test scores and “i can’t breathe” verse… i’m tuning in

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i think the live performance of this on the adult swim special concert changed my life

**TiltControls** (10): might be the 11 of the album for me. that lyricism is fantastic

**UselessTacooo** (10): this is actually great

**welcome2thejam** (10): Remembering that this was recorded before George Floyd adds another layer of heartbreak. Hard not to feel like the wheel just keeps on turning, and so proving Mike right about trading empathy for apathy.

**whydideveribother** (10): Killer Mike's verse is the one everyone remembers (and for very good reason), but Jesus Christ El-P also goes the fuck off on this.

**you2009** (10): my gængsta boo we love you

**modulum83** (9.5): will literally never forget the experience of hearing that killer mike verse for the first time

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this shit is a mess but one that I want

**team\_kockroach** (9): on first listen i really liked this but the “prison population” bars are a little under-written. But the sirens in the instrumental are incredible, and the last third of the song is ridiculously fun

**thedoctordances1940** (9): i just remember when this came out at the height of the blm protests, hit hard then, still a great track

# “Goddamn, that motherfucker cold”

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): me coming back from the bus stop in the middle of winter when it’s -40C

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): i've never actually seen snow irl, so I'm just gonna have to trust you that it's cold mr. jewel

**runaway3212** (8): this song is so serious and then he says "I just got done walking in the snow, damn that mf cold"

**afs** (7.5): loses points because I can't relate :( cruel summer

sufjancaesar: So pumped this went down well! Was to be expected that RTJ’s sound isn’t for everyone but I think they got their dues. Barely any filler, lyrical depth, some of my favourite production I’ve heard by El-P and strong accessibility despite heavy themes. Whether you’re looking for catharsis, strength or just some hip hop that goes hard af - RTJ4 can deliver

**iniekcja\_** (9.364): this is the type of album that is truly an experience from start to finish, great lyrics, great production, great transitions making the tracks flow perfectly. Every now and then a track I almost forgot about comes up on shuffle and I get pulled down the rabbit hole again and again

**Neighbourly** (9.364): so good it's just boring at this point. doesn't even feel like they're trying

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.182): this is one of my favorite albums of 2020 so I'm really glad we're finally rating it. it's just a super timely album with poignant and hard-hitting lyrics, really great production, and some MASSIVE bangers. I'm not gonna really delve deep into the messages and political themes of this album but they're extremely important and well expressed.

**team\_kockroach** (8.964): With this album, El-P might genuinely be better than Madlib or J Dilla. How many classics is he still going to make? Also shout out to Polyphonic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GiCuvS5n-w

**thedoctordances1940** (8.845): Yeah I genuinely do love this album, so many absolute bangers and barely any filler

**shipperondeck** (8.755): would it be mean to call them older men bc i love these older men

**plastichaxan** (8.727): it’s insane that an album this good with this average is my third favorite of the rate but hey, that speaks on the quality. This is just really really good and I’m sad I underrated it apart from a few songs on first listen when it came out but hey it’s never too late to redeem yourself

**skargardin** (8.545): The production here is insane actually. I should listen to this album way more!

**frogaranaman** (8.455): it's still so funny to me how my parents stan this album

**welcome2thejam** (8.364): Consistently good the whole way through. Such a joy hearing these two pass the mic back and forth, even if the topics aren't always so joyous. If you wanted to argue RTJ are the best rappers of the four, I certainly wouldn't stand in your way.

**seanderlust** (8.364): killer mike and el-p are legends for a reason. they remind me a little of MF DOOM in that there's real value in sitting down and reading the lyrics and analyzing both the content and the rhyme scheme because it can get fairly complicated fairly quickly. this album is one of my favorites of theirs - it blends personal thoughts, based socio-political takes and fun but down-to-earth boasts all over some KILLER beats. in any other rate, walking in the snow or out of sight would have been my 11, but given the lineup here, i had to put it elsewhere. RTJ4 is a classic. well done boys, can't wait for the cat remix.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.227): I think this is gonna grow on me a lot more. It's a really solid piece of work that can definitely keep me entertained on my car rides. I really dig it.

**fadedblue09** (8.045): Being the shortest album, this album has unsurprisingly the least amount of filler, and the most consistent listen throughout. On top of that, it has everything I want in a hiphop album: fire delivery, compelling lyrics and hard-hitting production. Probably the only album I’ll ever revisit after this rate tbh

**afs** (8.000): these guys probably have the best rhymes and flow in the entire rate, even though sometimes they tend to go too similar at tracks. but when they hit hard (radiation)... whew. good listen!

**bigbigbee** (7.955): I get how people say this sounds a bit “samey”, but I loooove RTJ’s signature sound and I just enjoyed this album so, so much. The production is just amazing - I think that you can really feel their experience

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.955): meow the jewels outsold /s

**Awkward\_King** (7.864): popheads is rating a run the jewels album,,, (bob the drag queen voice) this is WILD

**just\_thonking** (7.818): This is probably the most I will enjoy this style of rap

**modulum83** (7.709): RTJ aren't really bringing anything new to the table but this album is hard to deny just on sheer energy and bangers. At times the album can be somewhat inconsistent, but more often than not you get absolutely face-melting beats or crazy ass verses from Killer Mike and EL-P. It's simple but it still works.

**akanewasright** (7.664): so this is *really* good, but not for me at all. I don’t even know how to say it, it’s just not my taste. It does seem like older raters are digging it a bit more, so I might just be too young/not in the right age range, but while the lyrics are probably the best in the rate, it’s just not really clicked.

**2dina3dworld** (7.091): this album had some interesting instrumental ideas but it didn’t click for me at all.

**cremeebrulee** (6.800): this is kind of the TDDC of the rate, they really got away with making the same song like 8 times

**Roxieloxie** (6.336): I originally left way more comments on here explaining just why I didnt vibe with this album but I think alot of my comments get into a territory and open up conversations that I just dont want to have with a nb audience so oh well! I dont think rtj is for me outside of legend has it, and im at peace with that

**SmileAndTears** (6.336): The more listens I gave this album, the less I liked it 💀 Oh well

**sufjancaesar** (10): What an opener! I secretly hoped an RTJ4 track would pull a sneak win but ofcourse I can’t be mad at this winning. This feels like one of the most epic tracks in hip hop. It does kind of feel weird that an opener called ‘Introvert’ on an album about introversion is so maximalist but if you listen closely, the vulnerable lyrics do offer complex duality

**steelstepladder** (10): And here it is, the obvious winner that everyone called from the beginning but that doesn't mean its undeserved. A grand, over the top epic that was hard to 

---

#The majority

**2dina3dworld** (11): will this win a second rate? Hopefully

**ignitethephoenix** (11): why don’t people do more orchestral rap? It’s so fucking good

**nootnoot781** (11): just doing my part to give this the 10+ average it deserves 😁

**runaway3212** (11): idc im giving this my 11 it's so grandiose and perfect

**Saison_Marguerite** (11): this was THE moment and still is. Simz exposing her vulnerabilities in a confident, epic way never loses its impact. For a track about introversion, there’s nothing shy or withdrawn about it, it’s the sound of Simz taking us on a grand journey of her vast inner world… and it’s only the beginning.

**skargardin** (11): pretty much a flawless introduction to the album cycle and the album itself of course

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this might be the best rap song of all time, from the grandiose production with beautiful strings and brass, to the lyrics themselves, insightful and brilliant, i can’t believe the world went this long without something like this in it

**team\_kockroach** (11): Inflo bodied this beat. This is a ridiculously good mission statement for the entire album - Dark Fantasy who? Wesley’s Theory what?

**UselessTacooo** (11): the best showing of Simz’s talent throughout the album. It highlights how easily she flows on different types of production and proves how creative of a lyricist she is. If I had to choose one song to recommend to everyone, it would easily be this.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): SOTY possibly??? this sounds epic as fuck and is definitely the best opener of the year

**bbfan132** (10): what an intro

**BeauMeringue212** (10): one of the most epic album openers I can think of. The production, the themes, how the song builds - it just feels like a classic

**celladonn** (10): Ugh what an instant classic. So grandiose in all the best ways

**cremeebrulee** (10): maybe one of the most deserved obvious winners

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i don’t see a universe where this doesn’t win, and while I’m not mad at that, I’m mad that i have that thought and that is literally the only bad thing i have to say about this song

**iniekcja\_** (10): I feel bad for not giving this an 11

**MrMoodle** (10): i’ll eat my own toenail shavings if this doesn’t win

**Neighbourly** (10): almost overwrought, but not quite. Great orchestral feel adds grandiosity. Reminiscent of some great rap tracks in the past

**nt96** (10): I am

**plastichaxan** (10): i can’t think of a more grand intro to an amazing album as this, and the way this is the second rate this is in where i can’t 11 it cause i slightly prefer another song kills me

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i feel like i'm about to ride into battle or something

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everything about this song feels specifically engineered to sound like the single most important and dramatic song of all time, and it kinda does

**seanderlust** (10): INFP GANG LEMME HEAR YALL MAKE SOME NOISE!!!!!

**shipperondeck** (10): certain orchestral segments are giving the legend of zelda 25th anniversary symphony

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This serves as such an epic overture to this album. I have to say I'll be slightly irked if this wins just because it's such an obvious choice among so many other strong contenders, but it will be well deserved either way if it does.

**Stryxen** (10): Probably my Song Of The Year - it just has that vibe

**thedoctordances1940** (10): this was soty from the moment the teaser dropped

**TiltControls** (10): so amazing. Already got an win over on IH and I expect the same to happen here

**welcome2thejam** (10): What a way to kick off your album! Instantly gets my attention with its cinematic nature and jaw-dropping production, and then Simz brings her own A game with her own punchy flows as she tackles a wide range of topics like race and corruption. The first words are "there's a war" and this is an unbelievable battle cry

**afs** (9.5): this is winning the rate isn't it!

**camerinian** (9.5): how good is this just as a general thesis statement for everything Little Simz does

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I enjoy the grand cinematic vibe of the production

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): first time listening to this album, and I'm wondering how's she gonna keep the bar up after this grand intro

**DefaultPophead** (9): My score lowered for this a little bit, but that's only because I ended up enjoying songs on this album a lot more than this one, so it can't get top scores.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): me

**uberpigeon** (9): ok i wasnt getting this song before but i get it now.... i can see how if i was more into rap this would be my 11

**whydideveribother** (9): An astonishing opening statement for the album and as a lead single too.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Impressive artistically but there’s a bit of dead air that could have been deflated

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): It's good, I know it is, but I've never been the biggest fan of this kind of music that tries to sound grand and epic. Like, I'm sure this would fucking SLAP in a movie soundtrack, but I can't imagine listening to this on a daily basis, even though again, it is a good song.

**akanewasright** (8): ugh… this is not one of my favorites on the album even though it’s too stunning and incredible to score lower than this

**Roxieloxie** (8): Is this the frontrunner to win the rate? I can see why

# About to be exiled

**frogaranaman** (7): gay

**Awkward\_King** (4): aspects of this song are brilliant, i think simz has a lot of great bars, the production is so grand, and cleo's performance on the chorus is awesome. however there are also things i don't like about the song. i think a lot of bars are too on the nose, for me at least, such as "But if you can't feel pain then you can't feel the opposite", whereas elsewhere on the album they are watertight and don't sound as awkward. for what it's worth i also think this song has a lot of brilliant lyrical moments, like the amy reference and the "I'm directly effected, it does more than just bother me" i think is really poignant. i think my biggest issue with the song might be how the grand production hypes the song up to levels i dont think the lyrics achieve. it's such an epic introduction to a very deserving album, with the orchestral buildup and grandiose outro, but i dont think the lyrics are that special, especially in this rate where all four albums have masterful writing. i dont particularly want this to win but i cant say i'd be mad, i just think simz has much better songs in this rate.

**modulum83** (0): let me start with this - i consider myself an introvert. it's something that i both find a lot of struggle and identity with and i think it's a rich topic for songwriting. this song is not about introversion in the slightest. "introvert" is a song that is trying to be everything at once and manages to land on nothing at all. the instrumental is undeniably beautiful and heart-stirring, but that'd only lend more supposed weight and drama to the lyrics which...let this production down in so many ways it almost feels like a prank. it leaps from one line to the next in almost comical fashion, never stopping to explain what the fuck it meant. "parts of the world still living in apartheid" are namedropped and we move right on to "i should've been a friend when your grandma died." it's just an endless river of acknowledgements of Things Happening paired with greeting card lines like "realise there is a prison in us." "i study humans, so that makes me an anthropologist," jesus christ. in 5+ minutes absolutely nothing is said that isn't a vague shrug of "fight the, y'know, system." i've never felt less seen as an introvert than here.

**skargardin** (9.684): I don't think it's hyperbole to say that this is my favourite album in a long while, I just love the whole thing from start to finish.

**plastichaxan** (9.121): Little Simz can do no wrong, and this is further proof that she can also do anything! This album just keeps on getting better with every listen and definitely deserves all the praise it’s gotten and more

**thedoctordances1940** (8.858): brilliant album, one of the best of last year and one that i hope has allowed many people get into even more of her stuff, genuinely just so happy for her with all the great reception this album got

**Stryxen** (8.789): reused most of my comments from IH lol i spilled once and i spilled again!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.737): let's hope the interludes don't tank this album that much this time around

**akanewasright** (8.647): Little Simz is a treasure of the UK and this is a jewel of an album. I adore this album with almost all of my heart and I think I might still have more layers to peel back and fall in love with. Some of the interludes are.. a bit much, but it’s cool bc basically all of the songs are fucking incredible

**iniekcja\_** (8.605): probably a minority opinion but after the first listen back in september I was disappointed. The five singles released beforehand were all exceptionally good, and none of the album tracks really rose to that level. With time, more and more tracks have grown on me, but I sti think that the choice of singles and their placement on the tracklist could negatively affect the first impression.

**team\_kockroach** (8.579): A few songs (Introvert, Point and Kill) I loved on first listen, but the album as a whole took a long time to fully understand. Also stream “Mother” by Cleo Sol!

**Roxieloxie** (8.442): I've been meaning to get into this album for a minute and I really enjoyed it! it lowkey feels like this is a setup to have this sweep day 3 entirely so im hoping that does not become true but. I really enjoyed it.

**TiltControls** (8.316): Somehow I love this album more everytime I listen in full, which is impressive since I absolutely loved it from my first listen

**seanderlust** (8.300): GOD what an album. little simz' flows on this album are some of my favorites in her discog. the choir/orchestral backing on some of the tracks give this a very disney vibe - not in the naive, someday-my-prince-will-come way but in the way that makes it feel like it had a full-length film and a multi-million dollar budget behind it. simz's introspective lyrics make it easy for the listener to empathize with her journey to make even the extroverts among us feel as if, sometimes, might be introverts.

**afs** (7.947): interludephobia + Rollin Stone tanked this TBH, I enjoyed this album more than the score suggests. Loved the variety, yet consistency, that Simz brought to the table, even if the album could feel dragged at parts.

**Awkward\_King** (7.842): this is my 2021 aoty, and very probably one of my favourite albums of all time. i dont think there's much i can say on this that offers a particularly unique perspective, so i'll keep it short and just say i think the themeing is brilliant, the production is immaculate and simz' flow and lyrics are the best they've ever been

**whydideveribother** (7.842): My most hyped album of last year, I preordered the vinyl as soon as it was available. I still loved it, but maybe my expectations were too high for it.

**frogaranaman** (7.632): I'm reusing most of my indieheads ballot sorry

**cremeebrulee** (7.532): good album despite being unrelatable to my extroverted ass

**welcome2thejam** (7.421): Shame that the interludes will probably bring the album average down. Some epic, ambitious production and great storytelling by Little Simz make this a hell of a listen.

**bigbigbee** (7.421): She’s got interludes like the best Book On Tape my parents ever played for me in long car rides

**just\_thonking** (7.316): Sometimes I Might Be Interludephobic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.211): ive always been a sucker for orchestral elements in music, so this album is right up my alley. so many deep and well written lyrics and the production is top notch. deserves all the acclaim it has and more.

**fadedblue09** (6.763): Overall too bloated and unnecessarily long but I do see the appeal. The first half has a cinematic vibe, and the second half dives into more obscure genres. Some interludes were inessential and there are a few snooze fests, but a worthy listen.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.816): It's a really great album, no doubt, but there are some tracks here that shouldn't have been included. I'm gonna cut off those and make the perfect album.

**modulum83** (5.679): God, I'm so conflicted about this album. All the beats go so hard - the production is amazing. And Little Simz is a very skilled rapper and performer with real intensity. A lot of this album reminds me of Late Registration, Kanye's sprawling orchestra-rap opus of the 2000s - and that's very high praise. But Kanye works on such a long timeframe because he's fundamentally funny and odd in a way that Simz lacks; this whole album, for better or for worse, really is just Late Registration made by someone that took themselves extremely seriously.

=====

TiltControls: Thanks to Steel and Sufjan for the great hosting! Glad that it got some great averages and (despite some worries with the early eliminations) also managed to have everyone make it to the top ten! 

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

**Introvert** takes the win for today (likely surprising no one). Still, a fantastic winner that fully deserves it! (it was almost my 11). It lands at **45th** for overall song rankings by score. It sits just below Lauryn Hill's Doo Wop and just above Prince's Purple Rain. It also ties exactly with Prince's When Doves Cry.

(quick edit but also Introvert becomes our 5th shared winner with Indieheads after Hey Ya, Toxic, Cellophane and Running Up That Hill)

For the other 9+ scorers: 

* **walking in the snow:** 108th (tied with The Weeknd & Daft Punk - I Feel It Coming)

* **a few words for the firing squad:** 153rd

* **The Other Black Dog:** 198th (tied with Róisín Murphy - Murphy's Law)

* **I Love You, I Hate You:** 220th

* **Woman:** 228th (tied with Tori Amos - Crucify)

##**Artists**


* 20th: Sufjan Stevens (+0.001 points)
* **21st: Genesis Owusu** (New)
* 22nd: Amy Winehouse (-0.001 points)

-

* 23rd: Joni Mitchell (+0.009 points)
* **24th: Run The Jewels** (New)
* 25th: Róisín Murphy (-0.020 points)

-

* 54th: Erykah Badu (+0.001 point)
* **55th: Little Simz** (New)
* 56th: Quay Dash (-0.005 points)

-

* 65th: Christine and the Queens (+0.006 points)
* **67th: Tyler, The Creator** (previously 47th, 0.108 point drop)
* 68th: HAIM (-0.006 points)

-

As noted above **Genesis Owusu** and **Run The Jewels** both manage to take a spot in the top 25 highest artist averages leaderboard! Genesis takes spot number 21 and RTJ spot 24. Their additions knock Rina Sawayama and Kacey Musgraves off the list (also no that's not a mistake for the numbers separation for Genesis. The overall separation from 16th to 22nd is 0.010 points. It's VERY close)

Also not shown on the board, but Tyler is 1 song away from making the 'most songs rated' list


##**Albums**

No one in the top 25, but **Smiling With No Teeth** takes an overall spot at #29 and **RTJ4** is not far behind at #33, which are both fantastic!

##**Rates**

The rate manages to pull of an elusive 8+ average! Glad to see Popheads really liked it! Overall it places 17th across all rates.

It also just misses the leaderboard for lowest rate controversy as it sits at 11th overall!

MrMoodle: absolutely devastated i can't say "denzel curry, r/popheads rate winner". it just makes sense. "clipping, r/popheads rate winner" is probably funnier but the zel stan in my heart weeps.

i'm just screaming into the void here but someone please we HAVE to rate melt my eyez see your future (or taboo i would jump for the opportunity to 11 vengeance)

welcome2thejam: Been looking forward the most to this rate since it was submitted, and it delivered! Nice to see all the artists getting something: Tyler with Songeniality, Genesis with highest album average, Run the Jewels nabbing two of top three, and of course Simz' Introvert winning its second rate

Also, incredible job to the hosts! Well-run, so fun, plus an Orange Cassidy/Maki Itoh sighting in beatsense? Helluva time
