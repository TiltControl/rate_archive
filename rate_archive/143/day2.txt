**sufjancaesar** (7.5): I like the horns here and his flow is very well suited to them. But the song feels quite underwhelming for such a grandiose instrumental, and it just kind of comes and goes. Like a lot of this album, I wish more happened

**steelstepladder** (8): Day 2 starts with the status quo of day 1. With Tyler getting eliminated. 

---

# SOUR

**shipperondeck** (11): I DONT LEAN BUT MY HOUSE DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO + SHOUTOUT TO 42 DUGG FOR KILLING THIS

**akanewasright** (10): this goes hard enough that I can overlook that he got Frank Ocean in the studio and didn’t have him sing at all

**cremeebrulee** (10): SMASH!!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): this made me want to say Dugg is the future for a minute then I came to my senses

**thedoctordances1940** (10): such a fucking banger omg, i don't usually fuck with 42 dugg but fuck me he kills it

**UselessTacooo** (10): I think loving this is a hot take but I do not care

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.5): I DON'T LEEEEEAAAAAN, I DON'T LEEEEEAAAAN

**you2009** (9.2): brass!!!

**BeauMeringue212** (9): is a triumphant horn section on a brag track cliché? Yes. Does it work? Also yes

**modulum83** (9): tyler heard one lil baby song and decided he would make one himself

**camerinian** (8.5): it's gonna take a long time for me to get sick of those horns on trap beats. Literally not a single major artist has fucked one of those beats up. Feed them directly into my veins thanks

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): after this much of the 2020s I really don’t wanna see a pandemic, I’m sorry

**Stryxen** (8.5): this is when the album really kicks into gear for me i really understood i was about to EXPERIENCE an ALBUM when this played

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): when will 42 Dugg make a song that lives up to this verse

**afs** (8): outsold sour

**ignitethephoenix** (8): no thanks I don’t want to see a pandemic

**TiltControls** (8): This is so weirdly epic I love it

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): this outro feels so out of place

**celladonn** (7): Nice beat but I don't love 42 Dugg's verse

**seanderlust** (7): this one is one of the tracks I like a bit less off this album but it's still so good. it's good for what it is - braggadocious deliciousness with 42 Dugg keeping up with tyler

**welcome2thejam** (7): Frank Ocean release new music challenge (IMPOSSIBLE!)

# SWEET

**runaway3212** (6): not terrible but also not great

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): did he actually sample a minecraft fan song on this

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): these aren't my favourite lyrics on the album but i love the beat and horns through the backing. i hate when people say this about songs but i do wish it was longer though jaksdja

**CrimsonROSET** (5): no i don’t want to see another fucking pandemic

**Neighbourly** (5): other guy ruins it, he needed like 8 less bars

**fadedblue09** (2.5): sorry but this sounds like a mess

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): 42 Dugg’s verse made me uncomfortable, like yeah I’m gonna get on my high horse as a non-black person judging hip hop for a second here but if we’re being honest I don’t really like to hear people bragging about accruing material wealth, dealing drugs, shooting people, and objectifying women. There’s a way to do that stuff without being gross and this fails, maybe there’s some character work or an element of irony that I’m missing but I really didn’t enjoy it and ordinarily I would just move on but the more I thought about it the less I liked this song. Outside of his verse the song just leans really heavily on a sample that gets old fast (which is strange because the song is two minutes?) and Tyler’s verse is *fine* but feels kinda phoned in.

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): The sample…the flute…the Wayne feature, there’s a lot of good shit on this. Not really the most memorable track but there’s a nice and warm atmosphere whenever it comes on

---

# Wayne saved the track


**2dina3dworld** (10): Weezer did it (the Lil Wayne feature) first

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): sometimes lil wayne does a fire verse, and this is one of those times

**bbfan132** (10): the flute :listening:

**UselessTacooo** (10): wooooooOOooOoOooooOoO

**welcome2thejam** (10): Best DJ Drama bit on the album. Luxurious beat & a killer Lil Wayne verse

**modulum83** (9.7): LIL WAYNE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THAT HARD

**seanderlust** (9.5): drama, are you sure you ALL have your toes out? https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxzsB2TXcAA_yhv.jpg

**shipperondeck** (9.5): ok even popheads has to admit lil wayne went crazy here. also this song is on my beach/summer playlist it makes me feel like a rich bitch

**Neighbourly** (9): great wayne feature

**plastichaxan** (9): the way this bops and i’ve seen people not speak well of it ou

**whydideveribother** (9): Wayne was on an insane hot streak of features in 2021 and this is one of his best.

**Stryxen** (8.7): this song sucked in my memory because the only part i remembered is the HAWWWT WIIIEEENDDDD BLAURSSSSSS but holy shit this is good

**you2009** (8.6): I do love how the flute on this really does feel like hot wind is blowing in your ear like yeah yeah whatever

**camerinian** (8.5): does… does this count as jazz rap

**Awkward\_King** (8): i was such an anti of this song for so long bc of the fact both drama AND wayne for some reason chose to talk about feet but honestly wayne's verse is too good i cant hate it

**frogaranaman** (8): Wayne just came out of NOWHERE with that verse

**skargardin** (8): I fear Lil Wayne snapped

**TiltControls** (8): The vocals in the background are fantastic. I'm sure it's a sample or something, but it sounds amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): chocolate ice cream is better

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): DJ Drama said https://64.media.tumblr.com/7da9dd8a74c6f239cf3fadd7d8afeef4/6eac94451b55628d-5f/s540x810/90330f770c66076aeb8e27d79fff28b6bd4c477d.gifv

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): omg that's the country where i live :oprah:

**celladonn** (7.5): The sample is so elegant

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I’m not very well versed but Lil Wayne has killed every guest verse I’ve heard him do

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): misogyny gets a free pass, cause... you know

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): lil wayne saving his rate average with this song

# Wayne sucks

**afs** (7): I apologise I can't stand lil wayne

**fadedblue09** (7): the instruments are majestic but Lil wayne ruined this

**runaway3212** (7): we fucking get it the album is called call me if you get lost I will take DJ Khaled shouting WE THE BEST over this every day

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): “we all got our toes out” this is a win for the feet fetishists

**akanewasright** (6): I think this is the one song in this part of the album that I’m not like… “this has to be here, if there was cut, something big would be missing”. Love the flute though

**CrimsonROSET** (0): now why is this song so obsessed with feet

**sufjancaesar** (8): I’m a sucker for a beat switch but I need both halves of the song to be equally great…the 2nd half of this track is definitely the stronger half for me and I always find myself waiting for it to start lmao

**steelstepladder** (9): My GOD the beatswitch goes off. While the beginning can be a smidge understated the second half more than makes up for it with the "L-L-L-LIIIIIIGHTTT!!!!" of it all.

---

# holy calamafuck!!

**apatel27** (11): God what an amazing track. The instrumental, the different flows, the lyrics, everything is just amazing

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this hits my brain right, it feels like I’m getting a massage

**KingKabs** (10): was an 11 contender the song just generated such a huge trippy sensation when I was high as hell and the song title felt apt afterwards lmfaooo

**plastichaxan** (10): holy calamafuck indeed this is a smash

**skargardin** (10): holy calamafuck

**bbfan132** (9.5): don’t love the song title but the song is excellent

**shipperondeck** (9.5): at first i thought he said "LAW DEFIER, MARKIPLIER" in the opening line

**team\_kockroach** (9.1): ugh i love that beat switch

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): take that mother fucker!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this is one of those rap songs that make me feel stupid like I don't actually know how to speak English

**iniekcja\_** (9): i love learning new words

**nt96** (9): Beat switched up and hit so hard, I just might report for abuse.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Unreal first verses by the two of them, unmatched flows and wordplay

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): the first part is one of the weakest parts of the album but that beat switch is fucking insane

**you2009** (8.6): wish the switchup had been the entire song, but the fact that it isn't does make it more impactful when it comes in

**camerinian** (8.5): second half is a straight 10, just averaging out for the first chunk which is pretty decent

**celladonn** (8.5): The second part of this is sooo good

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I swear I heard markplier rather than non complier at first and I was so confused

**TiltControls** (8.5): the song is great, but I just love the title

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i dont recommend licking toads

**frogaranaman** (8): holy calamafuck! this will get robbed

**seanderlust** (8): god the beat switch here goes HARD

**runaway3212** (7.5): frankly this song sounds terrible for the first 3 minutes but the last minutes is amazing

**afs** (7): ironically the Spotify lyrics are censored, including murder and cannons

**DefaultPophead** (7): Lick the toad's back like, "Mmm, delicious"

**just\_thonking** (7): I like the beat switch

# holy…calamafuck??

**modulum83** (6.5): this beat kinda goofy ngl

**Awkward\_King** (6): the switchup halfway through kinda saves this song for me otherwise i think it'd risk being one of the more boring ones production wise

**Roxieloxie** (6): im taking points off for the part close to the 2 minute work where it really sounds like the start of next level by aespa

**SmileAndTears** (6): Idk I just heard multiverse and now I really wanna watch Multiverse of Madness. Stan Wanda

**UselessTacooo** (5): it’s probably objectively good but it’s just so stagnant that it felt like a lullaby

**sufjancaesar** (9): El-P’s production really shines on this, something about the beat sounds like a siren and the whole song just incites a lot of hype and energy - which really works with the album’s protest theme

**steelstepladder** (10): More RTJ just doing what RTJ is great at. Slick beat, slick rhymes, and even though it's easy to say it's fairly standard for this rate, it still does everything it sets out to do in stride.

# Millenials


**apatel27** (10): That last Killer Mike verse 👌

**Awkward\_King** (10): my 11 from this album! god i love this song i hope it at least makes day 2, its just such a banger while el-p and mike's verses are some of the best of their career

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i could fix him…….

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the production giving 90s jock jam vibes like this deep-ass song could be playing in the background of the first Space Jam movie

**Neighbourly** (10): killer mike

**nt96** (10): fuck Marvel, THIS is the crossover we need right now

**runaway3212** (10): have you ever seen E.T. that bitch looks very easy to beat up. Im saying if it was /u/runaway3212 vs E.T. I would win

**shipperondeck** (10): checking genius for the lyrics and seeing that elton john was intended to sing the hook gave me whiplash

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): thinking about how el-p apparently said that Elton John was supposed to be on this track (that's what Genius said, at least)

**bbfan132** (9): this production is perfect

**camerinian** (9): fuck me this beat ridiculously hard

**celladonn** (9): yes say that

**team\_kockroach** (8.8): i need more pitch-shifted El-P in my life. These drums are just chef’s kiss

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): in no way I can sing along to this, but I fuck with it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): is this epic rap battles of history

**welcome2thejam** (8): "me and the goonies would've killed E.T. with hammers i can tell you that much"

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): they’re missing the probable winner, the Gremlins, in this equation.

**afs** (7.5): I'm very disappointed this isn't about alien sex, fuck that fuck shit

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Epic Rap Battles of History RESIGNED!

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): i'd choose goonies but i've also never seen ET in English so maybe I'm wrong. also what about stand by me?

**seanderlust** (7.3): this instrumental is truly bananas

**frogaranaman** (7): thought the Goonies (movie) was a fever dream for most my life

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the title gives me epic rap battles of history teas

**modulum83** (7): oh god... i HAVE been hypnotized and twitterized by silly guys. how could i let this happen to me...

**TiltControls** (7): kids in the 80s deciding what to watch

# Gen Z 

**UselessTacooo** (4): it lacks in substance

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): RTJ’s writing is the real star here. Their verses are chilling and El-P’s production (and the Mavis Staples feature) sells that mood well. It’s not as memorable per se but it’s a needed breather before the album’s grand finale imo

**steelstepladder** (9): The penultimate song is pretty perfect as a prelude to firing squad. A more haunting, sweeping atmosphere works wonders, and Mavis Staples does great on the hook as well!

---

# I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)


**iniekcja\_** (11): Mavis Staples might be my favorite feature to hear on a rap track

**fadedblue09** (10): Mavis Staples is a goddess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): FUCK JOSH HOMME ok now that i got that out of the way this production is so fucking orgasmic and mavis staples is as beautiful a singer as she always is

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): The rhyme scheme of this one is incredible omg

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): petition for all Queens of the Stone Age songs to be re-recorded with Mavis Staples as vocalist

**team\_kockroach** (9.4): most of the attention went to “walking in the snow” but this song has waaay more hard-hitting commentary

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): the production fuck me

**BeauMeringue212** (9): everyone came together great on this song. Josh on the guitar and Mavis on the hook served

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Mavis Staples staying booked and busy we have no choice but to stan

**Stryxen** (9): not sure why but this reminds me of black midi and makes me think less of it - fucking banger tho

**UselessTacooo** (9): every time I feel like the album is naur, it reyasses

**camerinian** (8.5): Mavis sounds fucking magnificent. That's all

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): ok Bruno Mars

**just\_thonking** (8): I like the synths in the background

**SmileAndTears** (8): The man at the end saved this song

**afs** (7.5): a guy named staples on a track featuring pins hm

**runaway3212** (7.5): grenade by bruno mars is fucking quaking

**shipperondeck** (7.5): grimy as hell urrghhhhghgh (in a very good way)

**TiltControls** (7.5): bruno mars????

**uberpigeon** (7.5): kate bush's silver buddha is shaking

**CrimsonROSET** (7): boom

**frogaranaman** (7): me when I finish my sewing project

**IIIHenryIII** (7): they ate

**welcome2thejam** (7): A Mavis Staples and Josh Homme collab with RTJ on this type of beat is some sort of fever dream. Also I incorrectly read a lyric as "Eat your heart out, fan fiction" and nearly died

# But you won't do the same (No, No, No, No)

**modulum83** (6.3): this song makes me feel vaguely uncomfortable

**cremeebrulee** (1): this is giving bad humanz album cut

**sufjancaesar** (8): This track is for anyone who was disappointed by the lack of pure rap on IGOR and Flower Boy. Tyler goes in fr and the writing is stellar. The beat is v smooth and the hook is kind of an earworm for me. I don’t really find myself coming back to this though

---

# “Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss”

**akanewasright** (8.5): piss

**IIIHenryIII** (8): washing your hands before pissing? he's so relatable


**afs** (6.5): sir I think you got washing hands mixed up

# The rest of the song

**Awkward\_King** (10): ok yes this is not my 11, but i would say i think this is what i consider the best song on the album, the lyrical depths tyler reaches are brilliant and the composition of the track make those the star. i just think the song is incredible

**celladonn** (10): Best lyrics on the album, he is RAPPING here

**Neighbourly** (10): pity he doesn't do more songs like this. More of a flower boy type

**nt96** (10): Synths make me feel like floating

**frogaranaman** (9): "eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid" at least u pay ur taxes

**modulum83** (9): as someone who used to be extremely uncool in high school but managed to grow out of it, this one is particularly close to my heart

**TiltControls** (9): There's a chill aspect to the track that I'm really loving. Not sure how well this'll do, but hopefully day 2 at least

**team\_kockroach** (8.8): Thirteen minutes into the album and this is the first proper length song. I get a lot of “Foreword” vibes from Flower Boy, as well of “Rusty” vibes from Wolf

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): “everyone i ever loved had to be loved in the shadows” :/

**CrimsonROSET** (8): did he admit to tax evasion because if so remind me to bump this up to 11

**shipperondeck** (8): this song definitely grew on me, esp the lyrics are really cool he's cataloguing and commenting on his career

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): good but i can tell how much better this would play if i were a bigger tyler stan and honestly I respect its

**1998tweety** (7): ASSA by cignature >>>

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): That last verse was really @ me so props for that ~~but it would hit harder if the rest of the album backed it up~~

**you2009** (7): video gamey intro

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the first half was a 4 but the second half is an 8

**UselessTacooo** (6): he tried

**runaway3212** (5): im so conflicted on this album cause it's so intense but somehow im also super bored by it

**team\_kockroach** (8.3): as much as I like this, I can’t help but feel it’s the poor man’s Really Doe by Danny Brown

**frogaranaman** (5): ?

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): at least he cares???

**sufjancaesar** (7): Something about all the elements on this track being together feels a bit awkward and doesn’t fully click for me but I like the question-and-answer format of the chorus a lot!

**steelstepladder** (10): Arguably the most consistently political song in the rate, the anxious pulsing helps accent the lyrics perfectly. Absolutely amazing song that doesn't sound like much else on the album, yet feels perfectly at home.

---

# 😑

**apatel27** (10): big mood

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this song is very cathartic for me

**frogaranaman** (10): dogs looking anywhere

**nt96** (10): To be completely honest, I never liked the expression "I don't see color". Personally, I feel it's important to see color as an ultimate symbol for diversity. It's ok to see color, because that's what makes us beautiful, just don't let affect the way you treat people.

**runaway3212** (10): me when I dyed my platinum blonde hair pitch black and promptly forgot I did that and forgot to tell anybody so then my mom didn't recognize me at first

**seanderlust** (10): WHEW the juxtaposition of the burning bush and burning cross

**shipperondeck** (9.5): DAMN !!! TELL EM

**CrimsonROSET** (9): HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA

**welcome2thejam** (9): So much of this album uses light music to go with dark lyricism, but this just forces its issues of hatred and stereotypes straight in your face to confront it, no more hiding. Also, that "burning of a bush/a cross" is such an unreal line. Anyway, important to me that I put all that first so I can turn around and type "7-8% of the population be like:"

**afs** (8.5): just now I realize that I've been understanding pretty much all the lyrics so far so this album gets bonus points

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): nothing like seeing an unexpected “u” in a word to remind you that an artist isn’t American

**TiltControls** (8.5): meirl

**2dina3dworld** (8): he’s right

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I love the abstract metaphorical lyrics on this album, but I also appreciate the upfront direct lyrics on this song that confront racism

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): he spilled

# 👁👁

**bigbigbee** (7): Some of the best lyrics on the album, wish I liked the song just a bit more

**Neighbourly** (7): interesting

**team\_kockroach** (6.9): does the cymbal clap bother anyone else or is it just me? The racism commentary is awesome but the beat keeps going “hah, tsing, hah, tsing”

**fadedblue09** (6): lyrics are more interesting than the actual song

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): on a purely musical level it just doesn't do much for me :/

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is so monotonously boring

**modulum83** (4.7): i just know my sleep paralysis demons getting lit to this at the foot of my bed

**IIIHenryIII** (0): it's not that hard to make a listenable song

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): Simz’s versatility as a rapper shines throughout the album but especially here, her charisma elevates this song majorly. I expected this to be higher but it’s such a strong album that I get it

**steelstepladder** (6): This is the one song that kinda falls flat for me on the album and it's mostly in the flow. Lyrics are great as always but it just isn't as smooth as the other songs to where I think this is a fair spot.

# GOOFY, GOOFY, GOOFY (complimentary)


**Awkward\_King** (10): thats goofy goofy,, goofy

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): love the Kendrick shoutout

**ImADudeDuh** (10): before listening to the rest of all the songs, this is my first choice for 11.

**Neighbourly** (10): excellent. workmanlike in a good way

**skargardin** (10): the production here has such an amazing flow to it, Inflo really put his all into this album

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): extra points for saying Aussie correctly

**akanewasright** (9): I love king (my Dark Alt Pop rate cohost). I’d without hesitation call him one of my very best friends that I’ve met on the internet. But when I say he *ruined* the “goofy” part of this song for me…

**camerinian** (9): this production made me want Little Simz on an Avalanches track please make it happen

**CrimsonROSET** (9): resort commercial music [complimentory] but bonus point for goofy

**whydideveribother** (9): Good god her flow and delivery on this track are just hypnotic with that sample. They sync up in such an off kilter but beautiful way.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.7): great vibey track and the sample was really well used

**afs** (8.5): the Kendrick line would've been interesting if he was in the rate

**TiltControls** (8.5): I have the urge to listen to Phil Collins

**shipperondeck** (8.4): this kind of song title appeals to me

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): immediately kinda considered this bottom two (excluding interludes) and while it has grown on me quite a lot it' still kinda just there for me (well at least in terms of the quality of this album, on many other albums it'd probably be top half)

**seanderlust** (8): GLORIOUS sample. i just think that lady lady lady lady lady lady lady

**UselessTacooo** (8): While not a standout track, this song should not be ignored. The fact the only sample comes from this song is shocking.

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): her flow is absolutely addictive here, but the sample is a bit distracting

**modulum83** (7.3): i'm suspicious that this song is also about nothing in particular but the sample chopping is beautiful and so is simz's soft-spoken flow

**frogaranaman** (7): "please don't tell my mama I be smokin' marijuana" well now the entire world knows

**welcome2thejam** (7): Love the way they're chopping up this sample

# GOOFY, GOOFY, GOOFY (derogatory)

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): i hope this gets day 1’d. Simbi’s laid-back, 21-Savageish flow doesn’t really work out. The last minute is great though

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): something is off with the flow of this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): the flow on this one sounds really off to me. like im sure it was meant to sound like that but i cant get into it. the sample is ethereal though

**MrMoodle** (5): sample is annoying as fuck lol

**runaway3212** (4): eh

**IIIHenryIII** (2.5): what's wrong with her? She sounds so bored and tired

**sufjancaesar** (6.5): Overall, I love the moshpit vibe this goes for and it definitely achieves that sound but I don’t think the chorus is as catchy as it could be. I’ve heard this style of music with a lot more replay and headbang value

**steelstepladder** (10): AAAAAAA this bangs so hard!!! Pretty much a straightforward punk interlude, this is one of those songs that probably just KILLS live. 

---

# !

**2dina3dworld** (10): i just think guitars are neat!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): BUT WHY IS IT SO SHORT

**Neighbourly** (10): such a banger love the instrument in the chorus whatever it is

**seanderlust** (10): shoutout to when I wasn't listening to the lyrics and was picturing black laboratory retrievers running around in the sun. i was just like "haha black dogs! yeah! :)"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): listening to the punk influenced tracks on this album is just reminding me of how much i hate the modern “mainstream” punk of people like mgk and yungblud and just how watered down and commercialized punk has become. we really need more tracks like this to get big and bring some actual substance to the genre.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.9): this song is very cathartic for me

**team\_kockroach** (9.6): look mum, r/popheads rated post-punk! High 9 for the audacity alone

**camerinian** (9): since this is as close as we’ll get to rating Genesis’ punk cover of Psycho Killer, consider this score as a proxy

**iniekcja\_** (9): this made me think he was British the first time I heard it, don't ask why

**runaway3212** (9): this album is so amazing

**Stryxen** (9): number one: black dog by arlo parks makes me cry and i would love to rate that album. Number two: OMFGGGGGGGGGGG

**afs** (8.5): that Will Smith line is probably the last one ever in music to not have a punchline regarding the incident

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): wanna shake my ass

**frogaranaman** (8): oh fuck I already used my dog comment a song before this oh no

**shipperondeck** (8): no not these bitches again! stay away from him!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this felt too short!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): I was gonna say something along the lines of "do the afropunk rate on indieheads" or something because this song has big punk influences but I'm pretty sure that the rate reveal for this rate is probably gonna happen after the afropunk due date so I'm just gonna say this is good and move on.

**TiltControls** (7.5): !

**modulum83** (7): finally, genesis owusu is bringing REAL ROCK back to music

**sufjancaesar** (10): THIS GOES SO FUCKING HARD ROBBED…no but fr I’ve always thought this was most underrated track on RTJ4 and this placement cements that further. The beat and hook combo is invigorating, unsettling and v piercing

**steelstepladder** (8.5): I tend to forget how much I like this song until I'm actually listening to it. Mostly because it doesn't really do anything that better songs on the album also do but man it's still a solid song.

# Geography students

**celladonn** (10): this beat these bars that hook... what an absolute banger

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly yeah- fuck you, your love doesn’t mean shit to me.

**iniekcja\_** (10): I'm sorry but I really hear Aunty Jay on the intro

**modulum83** (8.5): killer mike our sex worker supporting king

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): banger, one of the weaker hooks here though

**team\_kockroach** (8.1): aren’t these the same drums from ooh la la? Also that “Hitler-killing” bar was confusing

**afs** (8): omg rtj stop beating the child he's a barb can't even read please stop I beg

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this kinda make me want a rock-influenced rtj album because this goes the fuck off

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): not relatable because love means very much to me but it’s a nice song

**sufjancaesar** (10): ROBBED AGAIN OH MY GOD. Ok, so this is my favourite track on this album. Aside from being one of the smoothest songs I’ve ever heard, the backward vocal is just fucking crazy?? Like truly such a cool song and deserved better

# !HTOOMS SI SIHT

**plastichaxan** (11): I don’t even know how to describe the reaction my body has when this comes on it’s just the biggest bop

**bbfan132** (10): holy fuck this is great

**CrimsonROSET** (10): god this is so smooth

**ImADudeDuh** (10): pob gnikcufrehtom a si gnos siht ,nmad

**Neighbourly** (10): excellent, enjoyed reading through the lyrics of this one too

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the sexual energy that is DRIPPING from this track

**apatel27** (9.5): That glitchy instrumental is so good

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): those freaky garbled vocals are one of the most memorable things in the rate for me

**seanderlust** (9.5): a sexy smooth song with romantic lyrics such as "i'ma seep into your bones"

**Awkward\_King** (9): god this song is so sexy what the fuck

**BeauMeringue212** (9): idk why but I want to join the navy after listening to this??

**cremeebrulee** (9): the reversed sample eats

**UselessTacooo** (9): I was feeling very iffy on the vocal effects going on in the chorus, but now I actually really enjoy them. Bonus points for the incredible production

**afs** (8.5): holy shit he's using reversed voices illuminati confirmed

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the soul influences

**runaway3212** (8): such a fucking slay

**akanewasright** (7): you’re gonna take my soul? Do I at least get something from it? Like it can have a horrifying consequence, but this doesn’t seem like a fair trade. Who’d have thought depression would be pointlessly cruel?

**frogaranaman** (7): vibes. makes me wish I was skating on Saturn’s rings

# !SRAE YM STRUH SIHT

**modulum83** (6.7): this song has some swag. not too much, but some

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): Just don't find this the most interesting song really, it's fine

**camerinian** (6): I always kinda forget how this one goes, which makes sense cos it doesn’t really have much of a hook. I do love the idea having a song that is almost entirely texture over melody (keeps you on your toes, heh) but it definitely is a weaker moment

**TiltControls** (6): Don't know if I love the vocal tricks here unfortunately cause the rest of the song is really good

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this is a bit too much experimental for me, there are cool elements but as a whole it’s not it

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it got better after the second listen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): meht ni slacov sdrawkcab evah taht smubla no sgnos edulretni fo sepyt eseht rof mret a ereht si

**sufjancaesar** (10): Rest In Peace to Groggs. When I first heard this I froze up, always brings me close to tears. Their delivery of the lyrics along with the moody production is really intense

**steelstepladder** (10): I was debating pretty hard whether or not to include this song as not only is this a very emotional song that is at the center of an incredibly hard to listen album, but I wasn't sure how it would play to popheads. Thankfully everyone was (mostly) respectful and it actually did decently well! By The Time I Get To Phoenix is the best album of 2021 imo, so if this interested you, give the whole project a listen! I can't guarantee you'd like it but for the people that do, it's really something special

**Stryxen** (10): this will escape bonus rates one day and on that day i WILL 11 it (unless bye storm is also an available option)

**thedoctordances1940** (10): god this album is so fucking devastating

**welcome2thejam** (10): The video of this was super simple and yet one of the most deeply affecting things I saw last year, even despite being for a band I'm not too familiar with. An overwhelming sense of loss throughout this entire track

**sufjancaesar** (8): This verges the line between really beautiful and really corny but ultimately it gets me in my feels so here we are. I do wish this was the closer tbh

**steelstepladder** (7): I'm honestly kinda shocked this got this high due to how many people were actively against it but here it is! Just barely squeaking into the top half of the rate. The Full House interpolation certainly threw people off but a solid song is a solid song.

---

# Full House


**akanewasright** (10): this song keeps getting compared to the full house theme (correctly), but this isn’t the only song to rip off the full house melody and do it better! So!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FULL HOUSE THEME SONG???

**TiltControls** (10): It sounds like the opening to a sitcom from the 80s or 90s and I'm not entirely sure why

**welcome2thejam** (10): STARRING WELCOME2THEJAM Turns and smiles at the camera, shaking my head with a modest chuckle

**bbfan132** (9): had to look up “no looking back sample full house”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): full house theme song type beat

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Is it just me or does this sound like the Full House theme song? But it kinda outsold actually

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): this sounds weirdly close to the full house theme tbh

**Roxieloxie** (8): If i had a nickel for every song we've rated this year that someone said sounds like the full house theme i'd have two nickles, which isnt alot but its wild that it happened twice

**team\_kockroach** (7.6): rip bob saget. Is it inappropriate to plug carly rae jepsen’s rendition of the full house theme? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLw8at0VT1M

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this sounds like the Full House theme song, I swear. Wait! I once made this same comment on one of the rate reveal days on beatsense… was it this song???

**shipperondeck** (6): janet interpolated full house theme better (but this is still really sweet)

**cremeebrulee** (2): not the full house theme boo corny tomato tomato

# Modern Family

**2dina3dworld** (10): ooooh choirs

**Awkward\_King** (10): FUCK everyone who says they dont like this bc it sounds like the full house theme this song is gorgeous its honestly my 11 contender from this album

**CrimsonROSET** (10): how many ways can i say ‘god this is so smooth’

**modulum83** (10): absolutely magical song, beautiful lyrics, huge end credits energy, what more could you ask for. this song helps me remember that no matter how bad things can get, they'll always get better.

**Stryxen** (10): exactly AND i told her

**UselessTacooo** (10): This could have very easily been the closing track and no one would complain

**seanderlust** (9.3): COME ON TRUMPET!!!!

**just\_thonking** (9): This song reminds me of the FRIENDS theme song lmao

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): tbh i'd kinda prefer this as a closer to bye bye, it just has beautiful closer vibes to it

**afs** (8.5): Nicki after she erases being bi

**Neighbourly** (8): I like this one better and now since we're already here and the tone has shifted I'm more into it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): it has a sax solo [2]

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this song is very sweet, but the chorus melody sounds like one of those tv show intro songs thats kind of corny. I wish the trumpets and sax were not just at the end (even though it’s a nice build up)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): That chorus melody interpolation is kinda genius, and this has a cool, classic, & laid back vibe to it, even if it feels a bit background-y compared to the rest of this rate

**frogaranaman** (5): ?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): yeah, this song just doesn't work for me. I think the whole sentimental of the song is somewhat cheesy, and the chorus literally just being the full house theme does not help in the slightest, it just makes it sound like a sitcom theme

**runaway3212** (4): I wish there was no no looking back

**sufjancaesar** (7): I see the appeal of this and I want to like it more…the beat makes me feel like I should but I think it could go harder? It’s supposed to go hard but on a rate with tracks that truly go balls to the walls with their mood and sound, this is kind of mid to me

**steelstepladder** (9): A song that actually dipped into the top 10 for a moment in the rate, Juggernaut unfortunately didn't live up to its name and eventually stopped all momentum, crashing down into day 2. An absolute banger though!

---

# :headbangs respectfully:

**whydideveribother** (11): one of my most played songs of last year love this thing to death. The flows, the beat the delivery aaaah. Also hi again Pharell.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): banger!

**frogaranaman** (10): "not spending more than what Google says my net is" what if Google thinks I earn nothing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Pharrell just improves songs automatically, doesn't he? It's like a superpower. Still hate Happy though

**MrMoodle** (10): you know i’ve been rating this album highly because it’s obviously good but i reckon tyler’s at his best making mainstream bops like this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): now THIS is the crunchy type of beat that i love

**shipperondeck** (10): this used to be my favorite song on the album (until i realized 11emonhead supremacy) but this one is still NASTY

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Lil Uzi's verse makes me want to run though a fucking wall it's so good

**UselessTacooo** (10): Let’s all rejoice, for Pharell didn’t mention piss!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): fucking banger

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): I don't even know if I like this song that much, but after suffering through this album so far, I really appreciated this one.

**team\_kockroach** (9.2): where was this Uzi on Eternal Atake? Best trap banger on the whole album

**akanewasright** (9): Im just hardwired to respond well to Pharrell’s voice [2]

**CrimsonROSET** (9): why did this album decide to turn good in the last half

**runaway3212** (9): This interlude deserved a worse song but im happy we got this

**modulum83** (8): this is like almost too dudebro energy for me but it manages to pull through

**welcome2thejam** (8): Needs more bass

**you2009** (8): would've been a cool 9 if not for uzi

# :throw’s shoe on Tyler’s stage:

**Neighbourly** (7): because I don't think I'd listen to this in my own time but I respect it

**afs** (6): that skrrt was sabotage

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): It’s weird, there’s three very high profile artists on this track but it feels so empty

**camerinian** (4): I love all three artists on this thing, yet it's entirely in one ear and out the other every time. Disappointing as hell

# Lumbersexual

**2dina3dworld** (10): I like the guitar riff

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was such a good teaser track for the era, because i think it is topped by other songs on the album, but is still brilliant and anthemic and sets the album up so well. the line "call me lumberjack cause i wish a n- would" is genius

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): "call me lumberjack cause I wish somebody would" is such a dumb punchline but it's so funny

**bbfan132** (10): overhated by some

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I love the beat on this, it goes hard

**cremeebrulee** (10): i wish my dad pulled out

**frogaranaman** (10): gay

**iniekcja\_** (10): feeling lumbersexual on this fine evening

**modulum83** (10): your honor it's not my fault i tried to pick fights with random shoppers in the walmart parking lot i was listening to lumberjack at the time

**seanderlust** (10): i'm giving it a ten but really it's a ten zero zero zero zero zero.........zero.....

**shipperondeck** (10): i also remember losing my shit to this song on first listen bc it totally reminds me of my fav rapper ever aka MF DOOM and that was definitely intentional anyway put respect on DOOM and on this track<3

**Stryxen** (10): career defining moment - i thought this was a lock for popheads top 100 tracks of 2021 so i didn’t bother voting for it :(

**celladonn** (9): This goes hard

**runaway3212** (9): intense and amazing

**akanewasright** (8.5): was this a bit of a weird single? Kinda, but it still fucks

**team\_kockroach** (8.2): “Ni**as was big mad”...umm…is this a 6ix9ine reference? Blehhh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): actually some of the lyrics on this one are really fucking funny the way he impersonates his mom at the beginning?? more rappers should do that

**UselessTacooo** (8): terrible single, amazing album track

**welcome2thejam** (8): So many A+ interjections on this track (It's really different!) and overall it just goes hard

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): this wouldn't sound out of place on RTJ4 tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): why would i call you a lumberjack you have a babyface AND don’t wear flannel

**TiltControls** (7.5): I love all the background voices on here. Definitely adds a ton to the song

# Gay

**afs** (7): I was hoping he'd do the entire track with that falsetto

**fadedblue09** (6): beat is fire but wow those background noises are distracting

**IIIHenryIII** (6): take an extra point cuz I love the word lumberjack

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): would have liked this more if the back half wasn’t just a bunch of people shouting?

**Neighbourly** (3): yuck, really don't like this one

**sufjancaesar** (10): I’m not sure how necessary this song was, especially on a 19-track album, but it’s just incredibly beautiful and I’m happy we get to hear it lmao

**steelstepladder** (8): And with that, RTJ is the only artist with a closer left in the rate. Not much to say about this one honestly other than a really solid closer for a really great album. Day 2 feels correct. 

---

# So Miss Understood

**akanewasright** (10): one of my best friends used to play this when he wanted to calm down and reset his mood a bit, so it’s got a warm place in my heart for that.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this song means so much to me, and it hurts me not to 11 it. this song has helped me through a lot of times where i really needed it, i find it so comforting, i love the anecdote that simz intended to end the album with how did you get here but then just felt she could push herself a bit further, and this is the proof of that. and im glad she did because if she didn't then my favourite song on the album wouldn't exist. i feel like HDYGH wraps up the album well and this serves as kinda an epilogue or a look to the future, and its really hopeful.

**bbfan132** (10): wonderful ending

**CrimsonROSET** (10): more like miss understood the assignment (the assignment is making a great album)

**KingKabs** (10): second best closer of the albums in this rate.

**skargardin** (10): Oh man this hits, such a poignant end to the album. I really think this expertly wraps it up

**Stryxen** (10): This song just makes me smile, especially the “Hey sis…” verse - the perfect closer

**thedoctordances1940** (10): "hey sis, how's your day been" is the best moment in music of 2021, I will fight anybody on that

**TiltControls** (10): Introvert was my 11 on IH, but you know what this might actually be the best track on the album

**UselessTacooo** (10): if How Did You Get Here was the finale, Miss Understood is the end credits scene that sticks with you even more.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.5): this album is amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): yes, the title is cliche af, but she's simz, she's got enough amazing lyricism she is allowed to use one

**seanderlust** (8.5): a wonderful closer. i love her flow on "hey sis/how's your day been?..."

**afs** (8): the juice callout omg

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Kinda nice that she did something more chill and honestly a bit *bright* for the album closer, it eases us out of the heaviness of the previous songs.

**iniekcja\_** (8): omg miss loose jaw pageant

**Neighbourly** (8): good tone shift to the understated for closers. I like understated closers.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Started the album off with such bombast, and ending with a really beautiful track

# So Misunderstood

**modulum83** (7.8): DON'T LISTEN TO 0:53 OF MISS UNDERSTOOD WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE

**shipperondeck** (7.8): is she sipping a straw at the end(??)

**team\_kockroach** (7.8): i wish that HDYGH was the closer instead - it wraps up these themes much more concisely. But it’s still very good though

**MrMoodle** (7): oh so miss understood by little simz is cute apparently but miss movin on by fifth harmony places LAST in the ratemas rate? explain liberals

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): low hanging fruit of a pun-based song title

**camerinian** (6): eh, I think How Did You Get Here was such a good end point for the album, not sure how necessary this was. It's fine but the album is long enough as is

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this other voice is annoying as fuck

**steelstepladder** (7.5): What you know about rolling stones in the deep when your brain goes numb you can call it mental freeze

---

# GOOD TRIP

**akanewasright** (10): People keep bitching about this last section as if they’re not mentally planning out a chair dance routine to it.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god she sounds so fucking sick on this song, i hope this makes day 3 it really deserves

**bbfan132** (10): love love love this, kind of want an album like this from her

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I know this album has prestige as a "deep" album but this is one of my fave tracks on it tbh. The beat switch gets me hyped

**camerinian** (10): is it cringe that my first thought for this track was "damn this bumps in the whip"

**CrimsonROSET** (10): palm hearts are really good i swear

**DefaultPophead** (10): The standout track on a first list for me.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): holy shit, this is hands down the best track off of the album and was an 11 contender til I heard the final seconds

**iniekcja\_** (10): wow another set of memories unlocked

**nt96** (10): Globetrotting queen

**plastichaxan** (10): i think this song shows a lot of her range in a different way, if anyone ever doubted her way of making really different and just as incredible songs

**shipperondeck** (10): "i got stories regardin' your bitch i won't disclose" sexiest bar in the rate mayhaps

**skargardin** (10): The beat switch!!

**Stryxen** (10): Every single lyric could end a career

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): “we hate rats” simz when she sees the results of this rat(e)

**thedoctordances1940** (10): fuck me this is such a banger why is this so underrated, genuinely one of the best tracks on the album. also godly snares

**UselessTacooo** (10): While this isn't the most creative track on the album, it is a huge highlight and a really good song. I love both phases of the song, and without the switch up it wouldn't be nearly as good.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.5): this may sound crazy but this song sounds like it would pop the fuck off on TikTok and I'm disappointed it hasn't had a TikTok trend yet

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): holy shit

**team\_kockroach** (9.1): Verse 1 is ridiculous, and then the song moves into a horrorcore-ish beat. She sounds like a badass

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Actually Simz, I like rats, which is good considering the state of the dumpster behind my place

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is nothing like the rest of the album but I love it… I know this will have controversial takes lol

**TiltControls** (8): I liked this a lot more before the album released, but I think afterwards there's just too much other great stuff to listen to above this one

# BAD TRIP

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): the first half had some amazing energy, almost shygirl-esque... the second half I'm not so fond on

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Started off strong but ended up being super generic

**modulum83** (7): hey, this is fun! that bass is absolutely filthy

**seanderlust** (7): everything about this works except for the vocoder(?) on "rollin stooone". that's the one part i don't like. otherwise, banger

**afs** (6.5): that second half was very disappointing

**Neighbourly** (6.5): audacious but doesn't work that great imo

**MrMoodle** (3): beat on the latter half is LIMP

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): worst song on the album unfortunately, the lyrics and performance just feel uninspired compared to everything else

**sufjancaesar** (8): For me this track isn’t so memorable but…it does make me wanna rob someone and play it in the background as I drive away through a tunnel with all their money while my head is out the sunroof. Places it took me…there

**steelstepladder** (10): Ughhhh I wanted this to make day 3 so badly but it slowly started falling back as the rate went on and was helpless to the sweep of ballots coming in. A fantastic opening with an incredible back and forth between Killer Mike and El P tells the story so well. Absolutely riveting the way it builds and you can hear El P get more and more desperate as the song goes on.

---

# Heist Crew

**throwaway92720392720** (11): I simply cannot get tired of this song

**apatel27** (10): El-P & Killer Mike setting the bar for the album with this absolute banger

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): absolutely explosive opener, killer mike's verse on this track is one of the best verses of 2020

**bbfan132** (10): a++++++ tier intro

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Love drums that are punching me in the face

**you2009** (10): sickening intro

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): it's just such a fucking banger, what an amazing opener

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I have no idea what this is about, but I'm digging it

**runaway3212** (9.5): slay opener

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): El-P’s flow on verse 2 is so fucking good. I just wish the song was longer

**Awkward\_King** (9): rtj's pairing of their production and rapping is definitely my favourite of anyone in this rate, i think they always match so well. their lyrics are also so heavy but come across so naturally its amazing

**frogaranaman** (9): don't know what to call that drum machine besides Good Shit

**ImADudeDuh** (9): is this the first one and episode 1-3 are prequels that come out 20 years later like star wars?

**iniekcja\_** (9): this ran me over

**Neighbourly** (9): great opener as usual

**modulum83** (8.7): killer mike just says random shit about his his thighs and i go "omg pop off king" every single time

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): OK but "I'm chubby, husky, thighs scrubbin', fucking up my Levi's" is my personal "if you don't jump to put jeans on..."

**bigbigbee** (8.5): rrrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHH (making car sounds and running around)

**afs** (8): these bars make me drunk please it's Ramadan have mercy

**skargardin** (8): this beat goes HARD

**TiltControls** (8): Do i need to listen to the first 3 episodes to understand this one? Or is it like a Star Wars scenario

**welcome2thejam** (8): What do you know, I'm going back to school this fall so I can get my degree in how to smoke weed til I'm blind! Also a minor in accounting

**whydideveribother** (8): Masterpiece music video love that shit.

**whydideveribother** (10): This thing is just absolutely gorgeous, I love it to death.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): the sensuality continues here oh my god it's amazing

**seanderlust** (9.5): this and centrefold are so brilliant in their depictions of depression as something seductive to sink into and lose yourself in, something that truly takes you over. to talk about that in a sexy slowjam? brilliant.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): ooooh this is so smooth

**CrimsonROSET** (9): doot doot doot doot

**team\_kockroach** (8.8): bossa nova is a strange genre to dip on for a soul/rap album. I wonder how expensive a Kid Cudi feature would be? Bc he could kill a verse on this beat

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song is from the perspective of his depression and like… can my depression fuck me like this instead of making me unable to get work done?

**runaway3212** (8.5): omg who let daft punk out

**shipperondeck** (8.5): "everyday is a holiday if you can't tell the time" lol

**sufjancaesar** (10): This track always gets me emotional. I love the back-and-forth between intensity and softness and both parts hit equally as hard. The “Blessed Blessed Blessed” audio is so satisfying too lmao

**steelstepladder** (9.5): Shocked. Absolutely shocked that this got two zeroes which kept it out of day 3.

# Standing Ovation

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): yeah she does deserve a standing ovation

**Neighbourly** (10): yes!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): it’s what this album deserves wow

**skargardin** (10): I mean, the third verse into the outro? Insane

**TiltControls** (10): The bombastic instrumentation is one of my favourite things about this album

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is one of the more grand tracks on the album, and I think that’s what draws me and others in. I believe that without this song, the project wouldn’t feel as tight and smoothly put together.

**bbfan132** (9.5): this production is immaculate

**team\_kockroach** (9.3): SCRIPTS TO READ MY NIA, DOUBLE LIFE LIVING OVERSEAS MY NIA

**BeauMeringue212** (9): this song makes me feel hella motivated for some reason lol

**bigbigbee** (9): The transition into this is soooooooooo gooooooooood. I think this album is at its best when it’s at its most theatrical and this exemplifies that, with its transitions and orchestral arrangement

**camerinian** (9): this song’s build up is so good that it made me overlook the fact the last verse was just actual slam poetry

**ImADudeDuh** (9): damn

**runaway3212** (9): cool shit

**welcome2thejam** (9): Whoever keeps bringing the orchestra back deserves a standing ovation tbh

**SmileAndTears** (8.7): Almost feels like a pt. 2 of Introvert musically speaking and I think I like this one a little more

**afs** (8): I'm your national anthem boy put your hands up give me a standing ovasheyuun

**CrimsonROSET** (8): yes this is really good but it being so early in the album is a bit ??? for me like maybe swap this and miss understood

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my cousin’s best friend was the main character of that one shitty netflix movie called standing ovation so whenever i see that phrase i just think of that movie

# Seated Claps

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): and a round of applause

**akanewasright** (7.4): this is probably one of the lesser tracks on the album, but OOH! OOOH! OOOOOOOOOOH!!!

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i dont think this song is like terrible i just think its one of my least favs on the album, i think the outro is really cathartic because it feels like the whole song is building up to something and it pays off, i just dont think this song is as for me as a lot of others.

**modulum83** (4.5): truly iconic to do a shoutout to the first responders on the same song that you proclaim that you need a standing ovation.

**DefaultPophead** (0): This sounds like slam poetry. I hate slam poetry.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i feel like giving any 0 in this rate will be controversial so i will offer an explanation. personally i found the simz album to feel very inorganic; my main takeaway from the album is that it is trying really hard to be a Critically Acclaimed Album (tm) without doing anything particularly unique. so the result is that a large chunk of the songs are a repetitive formula of orchestral production + looping vocal sample/riff + Simz's fairly monotone flow. so on songs like this where the theme is basically "i am such a great rapper" it feels particularly unearned. that being said i see the appeal of everything i just mentioned its just not for me!!

**sufjancaesar** (10): I expected this to easily make Day 3 tbh, soo close. The beat on this is chaotic in such a pulsating way, and the track still manages to be v catchy and accessible. Killer Mike’s flow in the 2nd verse is absolutely insane!

**steelstepladder** (10): And here we have the last song out of day 2 and boy oh boy it's a doozy. One of the best straightforward bangers throughout the rate, throw this on at any house party and it will blow the roof off the place. SO close to making day three which IMO would be deserved, but it has to settle for being the last song to eligible for songeniality

# YOU CAN’T STOP THE BEAT

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was the first song to click with me on the album and i think 2 chainz verse is one of the highs of the album tbh

**bigbigbee** (10): the men in this music video look EXTREMELY British. I can’t explain why I think that, but they do

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i’m out of touch, you’re out of time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): more like 10 chainz ha ha ha he he he

**frogaranaman** (10): production goes INSANEEEE

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): mmm crunchy

**seanderlust** (10): this is a banger and is my absolute favorite 2 chainz verse in years - it's up there with his feature on ye's Mercy

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): this beat has so much bounce to it

**you2009** (9.4): love how this almost sounds old school hh at some parts

**1998tweety** (9): the beat on this is so fking good omg

**akanewasright** (9): God this beat could level buildings

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): half of 2 Chainz' verse, especially "I buy a hot dog stand if I'm tryna be frank," is fairly ridiculous, but it's 2 Chainz so it works

**runaway3212** (9): this beat is so fucking great

**shipperondeck** (9): beat goes crazy + bars + we've mcfuckin had it

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hot damn thats a fun beat

**modulum83** (8.9): am i the only one that mentally sings yeah by usher every time i hear this beat

**team\_kockroach** (8.6): 2 Chainz straight-up doesn’t belong on this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): i think i saw the plot of this music video in a barbie movie once

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): this beat? Inject it into my bloodstream

**afs** (8): first pussy fish, now penguin pussy. what's next, octopussy?

**camerinian** (8): 2 Chainz sounds so fucking different to what I know from him, is this his serious voice or

**celladonn** (8): I love the flows here

**fadedblue09** (8): 2 Chainz' name is misspelled btw

# BEAT IT

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): don't stay out of sight anymore, please, the world needs to hear you

**2dina3dworld** (7): what did the vegans ever do to you?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why is this bass boosted for no reason

**ImADudeDuh** (7): “Bitch, we cool as penguin pussy” noah fence but you will never be as cool as her

**iniekcja\_** (7): this was a bit too off at times

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): let’s rate more 2 chainz after this? i think we should do that

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Great production but reading the lyrics made me like this one less
