**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/JcD3fSs4)**

---

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): I feel like this is the most indie rock / bedroom pop track in the rate. So it can go whenever.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): honestly I find this song kind of obnoxious, between the droning guitar, the light distortion on clairo's vocals and the overall feeling of heaviness on the track, it makes it a drag to listen to

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): the 90s alt drum pattern is what makes this for me tbh

**stryxen** (9.5): clairo knows how to scratch something in my brain this just feels GOOD. Also I love IM NERVOUS COULDN’T TELL YOU WHY so much and I really can not tell you why

**bbfan132** (9): this kind of reminds me of an indie/alt song from the 90s production-wise but with a modern touch - i could listen to this for hours honestly

**ImADudeDuh** (9): im boppin

**seanderlust** (8.9): "maybe I should just go up north" YAS QUEEN COME TO SEATTLE

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.4): relatable queen

**SmileAndTears** (7.7): I'm listening to this and now I want Perfume Genius to sing this song and to spice up the production

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**Benthetall1** (7.5): The drums are so 90s, but in a good way. The mix is a bit muddy though.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): that chorus is cute

**runaway3212** (7.5): a bit bland compared to some of the other songs but still great

**CarlieScion** (6.5): can she PLEASE do a single song where i can actually make out what she sings?

**wavingwolves** (6.5): production value is high but it's overall a little forgettable though the ending is really nice

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh so it's weird when Ed Sheeran sings about his bedsheets smelling like someone but Clairo can and it's fine well that's INTERESTING (this is a joke).

**daretheghost** (5): I think what’s keeping me from vibing more with this is the production. Everything feels like it’s operating in the same frequency—and I know it’s a stylistic choice but it’s making it hard for me to connect with either the music or the lyrics in any meaningful way.

**useless-sheep** (5): is this bad? i kinda think it is

**irrelvelvet** (4): the mixing on this is unforgivable

**kirby31200** (4): There's something really off about this song to me. The distortion on the music while her vocals stay subdued make it feel like I'm in a room with my friend halfheartedly singing along to a song playing on a shitty stereo with a bad radio reception

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/yxnp46E5)**

---

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This track really gives me super early Phoenix vibes, the synth arpeggio is great, it sounds super early 2000's indie and feels warm and nostalgic.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Instrumental is pretty simple but kinda groovy, probably the best part of it.

---

**runaway3212** (10): Angelic

**wavingwolves** (10): the danielle haim backing vocals rly give this some spice

**bbfan132** (8): not my favorite song here but it’s still a great track to listen to when you’re working on stuff or chilling out

**Benthetall1** (8): More good than not here, but maybe just a bit cluttered-sounding at points with the harpsichord-esque synth.

**CarlieScion** (8): cute!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this is so nice but it also feels like it's building to a climax it never quite reaches

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the drums sound like you know I’m no good by Amy Winehouse

**stryxen** (8): bop, especially the HEAVENLY outro.

**SmileAndTears** (7.7): Good

**1998tweety** (7): beat is a bit too repetitive but besides that its alright

**ImADudeDuh** (7): why does it have that dracula’s castle piano on the second verse

**kappyko** (7): i get this mixed up with north and not going to lie it disappoints me when it's NOT north

**vayyiqra** (7): I like this beat it is good.

**daretheghost** (5): Doesn’t leave a huge impression on me, but the individual parts are nice enough.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The chorus on this one is very powerful. Pretty straightforward pop rock otherwise.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): I never really fell in love with this track, it feels a little directionless/unfocused, just never really clicked.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this song gets me in my feelings, so many emotions. Def a contender for my 11

**turtle-thief** (10): This one hit too hard, i even felt bad for the vocalist.

**SmileAndTears** (9.3): Mwah! The sad banger/ballad I never knew I needed

**daretheghost** (9): Sounds a bit like falling into water. Lush, sad, and beautiful.

**wavingwolves** (9): -- (some) popheads reacting to a rapper getting a #1 on hot 100 when their faves can't even sell 30k of records

**bbfan132** (8.5): it’s kind of a simple ballad but it’s still beautiful, i love katie’s delivery here

**stryxen** (8.3): why is this so intense omg i’m scared. Still v good tho lol

**Benthetall1** (8): A bit repetitive, but they do a good slow-burn ballad.

**CarlieScion** (8): WHOOOOO WHOOOOO OOOOOO

**runaway3212** (8): Me @ T swizzle after hearing 'the 1'

**shhhneak** (8): WHO WHO WHO ARE YOU SI voice crack nGiNg AboUT

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): good breakup song

**seanderlust** (7.1): i am absolutely in love with the lyrics. sonically, this one just doesn't quite do it for me though.

**vayyiqra** (7): More 80s LARP = good.

**useless-sheep** (6.3): i like it, but only kind of

**pat-rickstar** (6): Has a nice build up throughout the song but I don't really like the chorus that much

**waluigiest** (6): this sounds like a rina sawayama album cut

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): i love everything about this track, but in particular the pre-chorus is so so SO good. the driving kick drum, the virgin line, the way it transitions into the chorus, heavenly and gorgeous, it's a really underappreciated track from this album

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): religion and flying are big motifs in this album, and I think this song blends them together pretty well

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): im also scared of flying and dying

**waluigiest** (9): I LOVE STRONG QUARTER NOTES Bennie and the jets inspired realness

**1998tweety** (8): i like it but the ending wasn't it for me

**bbfan132** (8): kind of sounds like a modernized version of a 70s pop song from a group like the carpenters

**CarlieScion** (8): this is what matty healy thot he was doing with If I Believe You

**SmileAndTears** (8): cute

**vayyiqra** (8): same as my comments on other songs on this album, this is 100% smooth and vibes only

**wavingwolves** (8): yas more religious lesbian themes!o keep 'em coming!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute but it feels kind of disjointed to me, like there’s 2 different ideas in here

**irrelvelvet** (7.5): SHALALALALA

**Benthetall1** (7): I feel like this shares certain ideas with previous songs but maybe doesn’t stand so memorably on its own?

**daretheghost** (7): Another one that doesn’t do a lot for me, but it’s fine enough. The Bible references feel a little misplaced.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): verses were kinda boring but i like the pre chorus and chorus

**runaway3212** (7): pretty decent

**stryxen** (5.5): im not sure why I just don’t enjoy this song much

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): This track really nails that feeling of just grieving a relationship, one you knew wasn't really working out but you didn't want it to end, and now you're just wallowing in the sadness, but you know you still need to take care of yourself and get through it

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I think one criticism you can make against MUNA is that their lyrics are kinda mumbled sometimes and this song is a big example of that.

---

**seanderlust** (11): "weren't you gonna love me if I just did everything right?" that line HITS.

**ManofOranges** (10): Really just kind of fell in love with this one. I already like the color so I guess the jump to liking the song wasn't a hard one to make.

**1998tweety** (9.5): love it

**Benthetall1** (8.5): Self-care is hard, I understand.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): the production on this reminds me of their first album without feeling like a retread which is nice

**SmileAndTears** (8.2): don't have much to say other than navy blue is a beautiful colour

**bbfan132** (8): nothing groundbreaking but it’s a v good pop song

**cremeebrulee** (8): i like that its a song about my favorite color :)

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the way she pronounces water makes me irrationally furious

**shhhneak** (8): A song about depression and staying hydrated who is doing it like them?

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't wanna be-e blue anymo-ore, blu-u-u-u-ue :pensive:

**stryxen** (7.9): heartbroken do not msg me

**useless-sheep** (7.5): uh i’m just pulling scores out of nowhere at this point cause i’m not doing this in any order but just listened and this feels like the right score, nothing else to say

**astrologicalangel** (7): I'm not a huge fan of this pronunciation of 'water'

**daretheghost** (7): Ultimately doesn’t do a whole lot for me.

**kirby31200** (7): Well that's an interesting way to say "water"

**wavingwolves** (7): muna really knows how to make bridges

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): nice but kind of boring

**runaway3212** (6): I don't really love this

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): This was a real grower for me, it was pretty forgettable on my first few listens, but then it got stuck in my head, and became one of my favourites from Immunity

**irrelvelvet** (10): superior to bags and i will die on this hill

**kirby31200** (10): There's a really fuzzy pleasant feeling to this song

**skargardin** (9): I feel like I could've used a song like this earlier in my life

**stryxen** (9): being squished between bags and sofia is not fair to this incredible song I always forget about it.

**vayyiqra** (6): Lyrics are a Mood Kind Of

**daretheghost** (5): I had to listen to this 4 times before writing something because I kept forgetting what it sounded like immediately after playing. It’s fine.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I don't really have any particularly strong feelings about this song (other than the "bonne nuit" bit, that's really cute) but I've gotta say this is the 4th song on the album that's pretty explicitly about flying, I was kind of over it at this point. Also, the outro feels pretty out of place.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): fairly standard. Like the synths. More references to flying.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): this is SO sweetly sensual i lose my mind every time also i never realized it's 5 minutes long? it definitely doesnt feel like it

**pat-rickstar** (9): I love the production on this song, it's kinda dreamy but also funky (applies to a lot of this album but this song stood out)

**Benthetall1** (8.5): “Funny that I tried” actually is quite a funny line

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8.5): vibes

**bbfan132** (8): whoever produced this album deserves an award

**CarlieScion** (8): sexy but loooooong

**daretheghost** (8): The bulk of the song sounds a bit like an homage to Janet Jackson, then the outro feels like something from The Archandroid.

**kirby31200** (8): I swear I keep hearing the Nintendo Switch click

**runaway3212** (8): very much great

**SmileAndTears** (8): It this how it feels like to be in love?

**stryxen** (8): ohhh this is a good one – was originally gonna underscore this quite a bit oops

**wavingwolves** (8): love the "you'll be the pilot, i'll let you fly it all night long"

**1998tweety** (7.5): feels like it couldve been an interlude tbh

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i see that airplane/flying is a big theme here and i think this song actually does it well unlike leia/flyin

**seanderlust** (7): fun fact: in french, mon petit chou is a pet name, but it literally means "my little cabbage head". I mean, chou also means a type of pastry....but cabbage head is WAY better, right?

**vayyiqra** (7): the story behind this song (imagining her girlfriend as being like her pilot to help get over her phobia of flying) is so wholesome

**ImADudeDuh** (6): janet remains unbothered

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): easily the best opening track of the 3 albums, it was a surpsingly sweet and sincere. I really love the strings in the background and the warm guitar, it's really good at painting that feeling of realisation that there ARE people who care for you

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): decent opener. Definitely a litmus test for Clairo. If you like this, you'll probably like the rest. If you don't, you probably won't.

---

**skargardin** (11): This is simply stunning and what a way to open the album with.. such raw honesty. It honestly caught me off guard. I think this is by far the most emotional and the most well written song in the entire rate. You sure proved me wrong Clairo, consider me a fan.

**bbfan132** (10): i love how dreamy/hazy this song is even though the lyrics are intensely personal - she also sings about it in the most casually beautiful way possible. excellent opener

**stryxen** (10): I can just listen to this song?? Like im just allowed to listen to this?? Feels forbidden

**seanderlust** (9.3): i feel like eighth grade is literally the low point of every human being's life. so hey, if you're reading this and you're in eighth grade, it honestly is all up from here!

**kirby31200** (9): Beautiful and deeply personal. Wonderful songwriting

**runaway3212** (9): Beautiful and magic

**useless-sheep** (9): this song is so sad. I love the short little story it tells and while this song is also slower it doesnt seem to drag on at all. It is beautiful

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): uwu

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Really cute. Finally someone with a decent opener

**Benthetall1** (8): Reminds me of last fall when I was going to Alewife station frequently to take the T into Boston, back when that was something I could do. Also was when this album was in my rotation, so extra points for pre-pandemic nostalgia.

**daretheghost** (8): A really beautiful song. Stark, but not bleak.

**Mysario** (8): this is in fact the sound of arriving at Alewife Station at 1 am after a rambunctious night with the homies when you realize you gotta go home and happiness is fleeting and the only thing waiting for you back at your place is the sad stench of the dishes you left out this morning and the sound of silence I'm fine y'all

**vayyiqra** (8): This is pretty and mental health is my brand I guess so I have to like it.

**wavingwolves** (8): i love storytelling songs and i love songs without a chorus/hook so of course i love this

**CarlieScion** (6.7): people come for selena for being the whisper queen when clairo is RIGHT here

**1998tweety** (6.5): kind of nothing

**pat-rickstar** (6): I'm just kind of indifferent towards this

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I just love how this song builds up, and the climax feels very hyperpop-y. Love that for this song.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): I like the way this track builds, but I'm not a fan of the breakdown towards the end, it just feels like it should either go harder, or not happen at all. Also that moment of silence feels a split second too long, so it just becomes uncomfortable

---

**runaway3212** (11): the buildup is absolutely everything

**1998tweety** (10): whew when that chorus hits....production on this is amazing, y'all Charli stans better stream

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh when the synths come on after the chorus whew. i love this outro too.

**stryxen** (10): the incredible outro could be the whole song and I’d give the same score

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): the buildup always snatches me bald

**skargardin** (9): this is just so good im crying

**Benthetall1** (8.5): Best production on this album so far, but I still don’t love the vocal processing.

**bbfan132** (8): the intro is super pretty - the production towards the end is a little annoying but it’s still good

**daretheghost** (8): This feels very much like a sister-song to “Who.”

**ManofOranges** (8): Jesus the lyrics are pretty damn sad to me.

**pat-rickstar** (8): The first minute and a half of this is so boring so I'm glad it picks up a lot in the second half

**vayyiqra** (8): Girl sing about being sad over bloops = good.

**useless-sheep** (7.9): its 2am and i slept for 4 hours last night. Didnt like this song at all when i first listened but enjoying it rn half awake so [edit: did i never (haha) listen to this song before its actually so good wait lemme change the score]

**CarlieScion** (7): the guitar on this!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the beat change really improved the song

**shhhneak** (7): “Consider this my resignation to the one that did me in.”

**SmileAndTears** (7): I know why she sounds like a zombie and I get the reasoning but that doesn't mean the song sounds good

**seanderlust** (6.9): this song is the inverse of Who - sounds great, i'm not sold on the lyrics. although I will say, having this song close out a set list would be mindblowing

**wavingwolves** (5): if i never got to listen to this song again i wouldn't care

**astrologicalangel** (2): I love when the beat begins to ramp up and gain power, but the vocals never quite match it

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): I love this song because it's got this powerful energy to it, the chorus is great and i love the little studio quips that were left in, and that really crunchy guitar in the second verse

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): the lesser coronavirus anthem by MUNA

---

**CarlieScion** (10): boppin!!

**daretheghost** (10): The chugging rhythm running underneath the song really emphasizes the notion and anxiety of being caught between knowing something is bad for you but doing it anyway and knowing you can have it better—and how easy it is to switch between the two.

**kappyko** (10): the production on this is bonkers

**stryxen** (9.5): yes pleeaasseee play the chorus as many times as you want

**useless-sheep** (8.8): one of the only ones i am listening to for the first time while rating but i like it rn. this feels like the right score so just gonna go with it. oh yes this bridge i love it

**1998tweety** (8.5): The bridge really elevated this song, but I wish there was an extra little kick going into that last chorus. Still great though.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): bop

**bbfan132** (7.5): the chorus makes this song imo

**runaway3212** (7.5): I want to hate this song, because it's annoying, but it's also really good

**seanderlust** (7.3): this one drags a bit I think

**ImADudeDuh** (7): get the fuck away from me anthem

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): This sounds like Number One Fan but a lot worse. The punchy synths are just too much for my ears

**kirby31200** (6): Wears out its welcome a bit, kinda repetitive

**wavingwolves** (5): this is the same song as "no" by meghan trainor but not as good

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This song is just... *queer yearining*

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I do like this song, but it feels like it doesn't really do much with it's runtime overall. We also have another outro that suddenly shifts and really takes me out of the mood the song sets

---

**deadline4mymemories** (11): though I didn't expect it / now it's getting my 11

**bbfan132** (10): such a beautiful love song <3

**CarlieScion** (10): very smooth

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): literally invented new york and engl*nd

**daretheghost** (10): This is a direct continuation of “the stage” to me: They’ve left the concert and they’re coming over to Shura’s place to do the deed. This song is the anticipation of intimacy and the last verse is all the sirens going off.

**skargardin** (10): the storytelling in this song is incredible ugh

**1998tweety** (9.5): very sensual, the switch up at the end is a bit too weird for me tho

**Benthetall1** (9): Full of lots of little interesting details, love the strings. The switch-up at the end is awesome too.

**vayyiqra** (9): sophisti-pop shura is 100% vibes

**stryxen** (8): love the progression, and how it slowly builds over the song, and how it ends… I love a good outro

**SmileAndTears** (7.2): I would've liked this more had it been slower/more mellow. Also, she really pulled a 'bad guy' with that outro lmao

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a little too slow for me ooo that outro tho

**runaway3212** (7): sure

**shhhneak** (7): That last minute though! Turn that up!

**wavingwolves** (6): good
