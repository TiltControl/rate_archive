**[MUNA - Saves the World](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6eaa87b34908000800ff8c/1:1/w_600/muna_savestheworld.jpg)**

After releasing their debut album “About U” in early 2017, MUNA supported Harry Style on his North American and European tour, and shortly after they began writing tracks for the project that would become “Saves the World”, a title that the band says represents “[that] saving yourself is the key to saving the world". The album explores themes of addiction, abuse and alienation in a fusion of alt-rock and modern pop. MUNA won the original Queer Synthpop Rate with “I Know a Place”, will they be able to come out on top again?

**[Shura - forevher](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4078d8e82cca0008d4d593/1:1/w_600/shura_forevher.jpeg)**

In 2016, Shura released her debut album, “Nothing’s Real”, an album about anxiety, unrequited romance and being the outsider, something unexpected happened. She found love. “forevher” is written primarily about Shura’s relationship with her girlfriend and their long-distance conception. “forevher” covers everything from the initial pull of desire to recognizing the moment when the connection develops into something scarily meaningful: it’s a classic NYC-to-London love-story, but one told through the totally modern filter of dating apps, unanswered texts, and Skype chats.
In the original Queer Synthpop Rate Shura came in as the runner up, but she attained the highest album average out of all 4 competing artists. Will she be able to achieve the win this time around?

**[Clairo - Immunity](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2750847953c00009b978cb/original/original/Clairo_Immunity.jpg)**

Clairo’s a name that anyone who followed music on the internet in 2017 has heard of. Her song [“Pretty Girl”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngtcfcaVrI) went viral and she quickly scooped up a record deal with Fader. In the following years she worked with Rostam Batmanglij (formerly of Vampire Weekend) to produce “Immunity”, her debut album. The album discusses all sorts of topics, mental health, sexuality, insecurities and illness, it’s an authentic and heartfelt experince that proves she’s more than just a “Pretty Girl”. Clairo’s a newcomer to the rate, but she managed to place the highest out of all of these artists in /r/popheads’s Top 100 Songs of 2019, will she be able to snatch the victory here too?

#The Rules

*     Listen to every song listed below and assign each of them a score from **1 to 10**. Decimals are allowed, but refrain from going past one decimal place - 7.5 is fine, 7.75 is not!
*     You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track!
*     **Rate all thirty-four (34) songs!** If you skip any, your ballot won’t be counted (We will let you know if you do so you can remedy that).
*     **Please use the pre-prepared link to submit your scores!** Note that if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout it may not work - as such, we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, and you should use a computer to send in your scores if possible! If it still does not work, a pastebin with the submission form is at the bottom of this post and may be copy/pasted into a DM if need be!
*     If you desire to change any scores after you’ve already submitted, simply message either of the cohosts (u/RandomHypnotica, u/static_int_husp) and we'll be glad to help!
*     We will be keeping an eye out for sabotage, and there will be a minimum average enforced for the albums. If you truly do have very strong opinions on a song or album, leave a comment explaining why and things will go over much more smoothly.
*    It is highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, like this:

 >    religion (u can lay ur hands on me): 10 The only religion I need is the one with lesbian vaping Pope Shura

* You may also add comments for whole albums! You may do this by adding a colon to the album title in the rate form, like so: 

 > Album: forevher: I can’t believe she misspelled her own album title how embarasing

We can’t wait to see the results this rate brings, it’s sure to be a close race. **Submissions are due October 18th!** If you need an extension, or have any questions, feel free to ask any questions in the comments, PM either of the cohosts, or find us in the popheads discord server!
