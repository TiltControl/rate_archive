**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/LzqLnfbm)**

---

**RandomHypnotica** (8): And so, Shura loses the first song. It's not exactly surprising however. The track is really pretty, and I like the title line, but that's pretty much all it is, a cute little idea to start off the album.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This is probably one of the best intros we've ever forced people to give a score to in a rate. Still an intro though.

---

**Mysario** (10): intro done right chef's kiss

**turtle-thief** (10): Simple intro but effective and flows beautifully into the next song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): this is such an atmospheric opener and for some reason really gets me in my feelings?

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.2): gorgeous

**1998tweety** (8): I deadass would've given this a 10 if that 1 note wasn't off.

**seanderlust** (8): a sweet, warm beginning.

**wavingwolves** (8): sweet indeed

**daretheghost** (7): Will Clairo’s album have a short, piano-driven Track 1? This song feels like a distillation of a moment in time: like something sweet happened and Shura needed to record it right after.

**kirby31200** (7): Cute

**runaway3212** (7): cute

**stryxen** (6.5): its beautiful can i have a 24 hour version

**bbfan132** (6): just an intro but her voice sounds pretty here, almost sounds like something from the 70s

**Benthetall1** (6): it’s an intro, but it’s not much.

**pat-rickstar** (6): A better intro than Grow for sure

**SmileAndTears** (6): uhm... it's there... it's a song... I guess...

**useless-sheep** (6): idk this seems a bit random

**ManofOranges** (5): I'm never quite sure how to rate short album intros such as this because it never feels fair to me to give them such a low score if I don't like them because at least they're short. So I'm just gonna go down the middle for this one.

**skargardin** (5): As an intro this is.. fine I suppose but it doesn't really do anything for me

**vayyiqra** (5): cute but not a song

**CarlieScion** (4): :cate:

**waluigiest** (4): not bad but a very short simple intro

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): Fuck autotune amirite? With the highest controversy score in the rate, it seems like we can't decide. I didn't like the track that much at first listen, but I grew to enjoy it, but the autotune really does seem unnecessary, because the part I like the most is at the end of the song when she turns it down.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): The trap beat doesn't seem to fit her pretty well but the chorus would be really nice attached to a different song

---

**runaway3212** (9.5): So vulnerable yet strong at the same time

**Benthetall1** (9): All of these albums have at least one moment with unnecessary auto-tune effects. We love a theme. This is also a strong song regardless.

**bbfan132** (8.5): probably going to place low because of the autotune but i love that addition, it makes the track 100x more interesting to me

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why does she have to auto tune her voice here? Like this is good but it just feels unnecessary as a special effect

**ManofOranges** (8): This is a pretty nice one, I think.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): kinda almost feels like an interlude despite being a full song

**pat-rickstar** (7): Cool production! Don't love the vocals or lyrics though

**vayyiqra** (7): Cute and autotuned Clairo is good.

**irrelvelvet** (6.5): the chorus keeps me hooked but the autotune on the verses prevents me from loving this

**1998tweety** (6): this ain't it for me sorry

**stryxen** (6): the vocoder annoys me a bit at points but I still really like the song

**wavingwolves** (6): i understand the use of autotune and what she tried to convey with it but i'm not the biggest fan of it

**seanderlust** (5.2): i'm going back and forth on the use of vocal filter. like, I get why it makes sense in the narrative but I really think it detracts from her voice

**useless-sheep** (5): idk, i just don’t enjoy this song that much. i really dislike the beginning but i guess it gets a bit better as the song progresses? the part that starts with “shut up” just feels a bit awkward to me

**CarlieScion** (4): u can just put extra processing on the vocals and call it art-hoe pop!!!

**daretheghost** (4): Sometimes when I really need to focus on work I’ll listen to one of those lo-fi chillhop playlists where everything is designed to be audio wallpaper and is vaguely groovy but ultimately goes in one ear and out the other and is over before you realize it started and that’s what this song (and a lot of the album) is giving me.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i hate this so much

**mudkip1** (0): idk something about this doesn't do it for me

**SmileAndTears** (0): She said [You guys don't mind? I'm gonna add a little trap to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpDgVbF4Wg) and then forgot to make the song sound good

---

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This is basically a ballad and an intro so of course popheads is gonna hate it

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): aaaaand there goes the other short Piano-driven intro track. I think it's a really pretty track, but doesn't really do a good job as an intro, it's pretty much the only thing that sounds like this, both instrumentally and lyrically, and it's too short to really appreciate it.

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): great opener

**runaway3212** (8.5): Me from ages 8-15

**1998tweety** (8): this is quite good for an intro

**Benthetall1** (8): Relatable, good intro.

**wavingwolves** (8): such a good intro

**seanderlust** (7.8): this song was made for a sad "main character running in the rain" scene in an indie movie

**bbfan132** (7.5): a very pretty intro but it’s just an intro

**daretheghost** (7): A nice enough song and a pretty good setup for the rest of the album. I think its brevity is keeping me from scoring it higher.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): a nice little intro

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): An odd way to start off an album tbh. It feels like an interlude you'd find in the latter half of the album, not the album opener.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): a cute intro

**kirby31200** (6): It's a fine little intro, it doesn't really work well at setting up the album's tone or theme or sound

**stryxen** (6): my plants when I forget to water them lol idk

**TinosCallingMeOver** (6): A nice chill start to the album but not a major standout?

**useless-sheep** (6): ok i guess. Maybe it’s objectively a good song (i have no taste so no idea) but a bit slow and boring for me cause i am impatient

**vayyiqra** (6): When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. :pensive:

**waluigiest** (5): cute intro I guess

**CarlieScion** (4): why

**pat-rickstar** (0): Not really sure how to score this, just gonna give it my 0 and go

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): A cute little interlude, I probably would've given this a higher score if it was a bit more fleshed out, but as it is, it just leaves me wanting more and feeling unsatisfied.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This feels like it would have made a good contrast with Grow if it were the last song on the album. The actual last song is better though, so it's okay that it isn't

---

**waluigiest** (10): the pulsing beat and soft vocals..... yes please

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this is it

**runaway3212** (9): Really good but a bit short

**seanderlust** (9): this is fully outside of my rate but I would like you to know that my cat jumped up on my couch while I was listening to this and his meows matched the key perfectly.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): I get Caroline Polachek vibes from this one

**1998tweety** (8): Slaps for an interlude(?)

**daretheghost** (8): While this is about as brief as “Grow,” which I took points off of for its brevity, I have to score this one a little higher just because I like its lyrics more.

**stryxen** (7.8): the lyrics in this are so good and I think the shortness complements it quite well

**kirby31200** (7): Good interlude, think it could've been expanded into a full song

**vayyiqra** (7): Good but too short maybe.

**Benthetall1** (6.5): Doesn’t do enough in its short runtime to leave a mark. Get it, comedy?

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): Really like the production but not so sold on the vocals

**useless-sheep** (6.5): ok but kinda unexciting

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the first verse of this song reminds me of those tiktoks where someone just says a weird story but has it vocodered

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): Not bad, just profoundly uninteresting

**bbfan132** (5): what was the point of this? lol

**ManofOranges** (4): This is probably my least favorite song on the album. It's also, dare I say, the one true dud for me. But I still don't think it's awful, otherwise I'd have given it a 1 or something, it's still got some good qualities to it. Just not something I'd listen to all the time.

**astrologicalangel** (2): Millennial elevator music

**wavingwolves** (2): i like the sentiment but it doesn't go anywhere and then it ends up feeling unnecessary

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): originally I just thought this was a "lofi hip hop radio – beats to relax/study to" track and kinda forgot about it, but when I read it was about Clairo's struggles with her Juvenile Arthritis, it really re-contexualised the song for me, and I enjoyed it a lot more.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Probably the most forgettable song in the rate. Sounds nice but blends into the background.

---

**1998tweety** (9): this sounds like it could've fit on shura's album tbh

**runaway3212** (9): Very great

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): I love the percussion and groove in this

**Benthetall1** (8.5): This one hasn’t stood out to me in the past but I’m liking a lot more on this listen. The background synth arpeggios (I think that’s the right term, else I sound stupid on the internet) add a lot to it.

**bbfan132** (8): this is so relaxing lol, i kind of want to fall asleep while listening to this but i mean that in a good way

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I have no clue what’s she’s singing at the end, but it sounds nice

**stryxen** (7.1): girl needs to enunciate more I could never tell she was saying “is it my doing”. Lovely song tho girl knows how to make u cry

**CarlieScion** (7): did she suddenly try to do something more jazzy? kudos.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): okay not as great as the previous slow jam

**kirby31200** (7): "Why does it feel like I'm older than I asked to be?" is such a lyric. You hear it once and it will be with you forever

**vayyiqra** (7): Having chronic pain myself and it being the fall this is a Mood

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): vibes

**daretheghost** (6): This song holds itself together a little better than some of the others on the album and I can’t put my finger on exactly why.

**useless-sheep** (6): i mean i listened to it and immediately forgot what it sounded like it’s just that forgettable

**SmileAndTears** (5): Idk at this point I'm just getting bored

**wavingwolves** (5): sonically it's really nice but lyrically it doesn't do anything for me

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I'm really disappointed in where this ended up. Probably my favorite song on Immunity. I really like the contrast of before and after the beat switch. However, I also know by now that this group hates child choirs and songs longer than 4 minutes, so those aspects probably worked against it.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Another controversial Clairo song, largely thanks to the children's choir in the second half (y'all really hate children huh). This was a standout on Immunity for me, I really actually like the addition of the children's choir, and the beat switchup halfway through keeps me from getting bored, despite the nearly 7 minute runtime.

---

**bbfan132** (10): such a peaceful closing track, it feels like you’re slowly entering or leaving a dream while listening to this

**runaway3212** (10): Only the intro is so great, but the rest of the song really transforms it into something more

**turtle-thief** (10): This song is pure genius, first time listening to it and i was entranced.

**waluigiest** (10): OMG when part 2 started....

**seanderlust** (9.1): I SEE THAT FRANK OCEAN REFERENCE, CLAIRE.

**stryxen** (8.9): it’s A Lot and I always think I don't like it but while listening to it I remember its so beautiful + that one child in the choir who enunciates “I” so much  ,,, I scream

**1998tweety** (8.5): i dont like the choir bit but besides that its nice

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this would be a strong 10 if it weren’t for the Only The Young children

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): the changeup at the end is nice

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow that switchup in the middle is so good this is a great closer.

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): I don't love the random choir of children in the background but the rest of the song is great

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Bernie voice: I’m asking you to stop using children’s voices on ending tracks.

**useless-sheep** (7): hmmmmm, im not sure. Liked this song when i first listened but its so long (and i’m so impatient) nice to listen to when i’m in the mood but that’s almost never oops

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.7): nice closer to the album

**Benthetall1** (6.5): Not sure this really does enough to justify the length of the song. I also don’t love the use of the child choir here.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): **me 3 minutes into the song**: damn bitch you’re still going

**wavingwolves** (6): i understand why she put a children choir to sing in this but it doesn't mean i like the effect of it. the first part is still rly good though!

**CritneySpearz** (5): not the children voices…. No pls...

**kirby31200** (5): It's a bit long and the children's choir was a mistake. I have difficulty telling what the song is going for, love songs don't traditionally have lyrics like "Baby, wake the fuck up, time for you to grow up"

**SmileAndTears** (5): Clairo Sweetie this song isn't interesting enough to be 7 minutes long

**daretheghost** (4): I feel like everyone hates children’s choirs and yet artists still think they’re a good idea. Why. Redeemed a little by lyrics.

**ManofOranges** (4): I liked the second half of this song a lot better than the first half. If the first half weren't there, honestly, I might give this track like an 8 or something.

**CarlieScion** (3.5): i HATEHATE childrens voices in music. i hate long songs. this is like everything i hate in music all at once

**shhhneak** (3): Seven minutes of a children’s choir is… a choice.

**irrelvelvet** (0): bad autotune, an out of sync kid choir, and an overly repetitive chorus makes this an absolute dud for me

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I love the melody on this track, Clairo's voice is so pretty and smooth, I love the guitar in the background of the chorus, it's such a lush and dreamy track, and I'm sad to see it go so early.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This is probably the lowest rated Clairo song that I think does something interesting in the instrumental. Fairly chill, kind of like it.

---

**stryxen** (10): im not sure why but this song is something special to me. Close 11 contender :o

**runaway3212** (9): using this song to say popheads doesn't talk about Dido enough

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): dido retired

**1998tweety** (8): bopt

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Dido outsold, but this good

**wavingwolves** (8): i just went through a situation that's very close to what the lyrics describe so i appreciate it a lot. i also rly love the production details in this one

**Benthetall1** (7): Dido outsold. Kind of wish the song had expanded more on the “But you know in small towns/what goes around comes back around” idea, otherwise it’s a bit too vague.

**CarlieScion** (7): these songs are all starting to just blend together

**daretheghost** (7): Falling out of touch is so easy, and then when you try to get back in touch it can be so difficult.

**kappyko** (7): 15?

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of boring tbh, it’s not bad but it’s not something that i’d actively want to listen to again

**letsallpoo** (6): fucking ended dido

**SmileAndTears** (6): Go stream White Flag by Dido instead <3

**ImADudeDuh** (5): dido remains unbothered

**pat-rickstar** (5): Forgettable

**vayyiqra** (5): This is fine but I played it three times in a row and feel nothing pensive. Dido did it better.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): I wish this song made me Feel Something more than it does

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): This track was by far my least favourite. The chorus really felt like it was describing me listening to it actually, because I felt absolutely nothing. It feels really simple and juvenile in comparison to the rest of the album.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this is cute uwu

**ManofOranges** (10): Coincidentally, this was the one song on the album for me that really made me feel something. Not sure why, but yeah.

**turtle-thief** (10): Sad bitches unite!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): watch this get robbed a bit because it's downtempo

**1998tweety** (9): shes cute

**Benthetall1** (8.5): Love the drums on this. Would have benefitted from a bridge or another verse.

**shhhneak** (8.5): this is the track on Immunity that’s hitting me the hardest.

**useless-sheep** (8): i wasn’t expecting to like this but it’s pretty good

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the most generic song here so far

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this is very random song i’d find on a late night spotify playlist vibes

**vayyiqra** (7): Piano ballads are not bad!

**runaway3212** (6.5): a tad boring

**SmileAndTears** (6.3): It's a song. It has lyrics. Clairo sings on this track. It's there.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i wish this made me feel something

**kirby31200** (6): There's something about this song that really reminds me of Colbie Callait

**waluigiest** (6): I appreciate gay longing but this doesn’t really hit

**stryxen** (5.9): its great and I love it and all but it blends into the rest of the album a bit, and is a bit bland oop

**seanderlust** (5.6): i'm really trying to embrace my identity as a balladphobe.

**bbfan132** (5): the blandest song in the rate…. there was nothing interesting about this at all rip

**wavingwolves** (5): the sentiment is nice but sonically it doesn't do it for me

**daretheghost** (4): I feel nothing.

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Why are my favorite songs in this rate the depressing ones? Chorus is fun and dancy, and the verses are kinda sad but definitely well written, showing some of the normal absurdities of life.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): I really love this song, the Avril Lavigne complicated-esque vibes of the guitar, the cute specific lyrics like seeing a psychic healer and "be where you are", and the chorus gives me that feeling of chanting in a crowd at a concert (god i miss those)

---

**1998tweety** (8.5): Ariyuhna is shaking!!!!

**runaway3212** (8.5): Fantastic

**shhhneak** (8): This is a cute one. Put a pot of coffee on!

**useless-sheep** (8): i like it there are a lot of ya-yas though

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): I'm not sure if it's the mixing or what but something sounds wrong in this song

**Benthetall1** (7): Another song on this album where promising verses meet a disappointing chorus.

**vayyiqra** (7): Do not see a psychic healer when in a major crisis take care of yourself better than that. Otherwise, a good song, but the lyrics are kind of weak.

**wavingwolves** (7): one thing i'm noticing about muna is that while they have great bridges they have rather weak choruses/hooks. i like this but the chorus is so underwhelming

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of produced oddly? not bad but the weakest song so far for sure

**rickikardashian** (6.5): the “ya-ya” hook isnt as good as they think to make it like 30% of the song

**CarlieScion** (6): this really didnt grab me

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): eh this one never really clicked much but its not bad

**cremeebrulee** (6): i like the yaya part but the verses dont do it for me

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): One of the strongest written verses on the album, but the chorus kinda ruins the song.

**daretheghost** (5): I… it’s fine. It’s okay. It doesn’t blow me away. I tend to forget about it. A filler song on an otherwise stellar album.

**kirby31200** (5): When the song's due at midnight and you still haven't written the chorus

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): distinctly out of place on this album. the musical equivalent of how hollister smells.

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): I hate it when songs reduce their chorus to just yeahs and la’s

**TinosCallingMeOver** (4): sorry the ya yas are annoying

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this shouldnt be a surprise

**seanderlust** (0): do you have that one friend that's happy-go-lucky and you can't fault them for that because like, good for them they're happy, but sometimes it's just really annoying? that's how I feel about this song.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Really like most songs on this album, but tommy has the "it" factor to stand out to me. Story songs are always my weak point, and the abrupt cutoff, in the middle of a multiple track run about death is a choice that I think is pulled off well.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): the odds were really stacked against this song from the start. Between the over 1 minute long voice memo from Tommy in the beginning, to the abrupt end it has a lot that can get on peoples nerves. I was the same at first, the end REALLY bothered me to the point I considered giving this a 0. But then [I read that the song ends abruptly to represent how sometimes out lives do too](https://twitter.com/weareshura/status/1163138601443561473), I actually really liked it, and the rest of the song is so GORGEOUS! It's such a touching, pretty and sweet song, the instrumental is lush dreamy and it just chokes me with feelings it's so beautiful and sweet and pure "just take your time, I'll be alright" UGH SO GOOD

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is like top 5 most heartbreaking songs of all time. the abrupt cutoff at the end symbolizing how life rarely has a neat little wrapped up ending... her mind

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait im fucking sobbing omfg i love this

**turtle-thief** (10): I had never cared for this song before this rate but listening to the lyrics, it's an outstanding track.

**bbfan132** (9.5): have to take a half-point off because of the minute long intro but that is still sweet and the song is fucking gorgeous… the production in the chorus is magical

**SmileAndTears** (9.2): It takes a while to get going but when it does... mwah. The way she sings "I'm in heaven without you" makes me really emotional and idk why

**wavingwolves** (9): quite ethereal which is fitting given the inspiration for the song

**seanderlust** (8.9): aw :)

**Benthetall1** (8.5): A song that triggers all sorts of sweet, sweet existential anxiety. Ends a bit abruptly.

**daretheghost** (8): Moving on is tough and sometimes it feels like we need permission in order to do so. But sometimes it’s the only way to get closure.

**kirby31200** (8): The concept is just so wonderful and unique

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The ending is so abrupt, always takes me by surprise

**1998tweety** (7): speaking bit goes on for a bit too long

**cremeebrulee** (7): i get that it ends abruptly because its a song about death but woah was that jarring lol

**ignitethephoenix** (7): there’s no need for this intro to be over a minute long, but I enjoy the storytelling

**stryxen** (7): the intro puts me off but the song redeems itself soooo quickly. Its so gently heartbreaking. Not a fan of the sudden end though :(

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): Why does it end so abruptly? Comes across like a amateur mistake to me.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Not a massive fan of the start of the song but the end is quite lovely

**vayyiqra** (7): i always thought this song was weird and didn't get the part at the beginning, but after reading the lyrics i now see it's really sweet and wholesome :uwu: so please read lyrics during rates, they matter sometimes!

**rickikardashian** (6.3): this is so cute but there was no need for a minute long speech

**ManofOranges** (6): I honestly like this song a good amount but that damn intro, it's just too long for me, I'm sorry!

**CarlieScion** (5): minues 5 points for having the intro be THAT FUCKING LONG. THE INTRo. BEING SPOKEN. BY A MAN. FOR A MINUTE.

**irrelvelvet** (5): song itself is really nice but i detest the spoken intro trend and the abrupt ending kills it for me

**runaway3212** (5): this intro is too long

**shhhneak** (2.5): A solid minute in this song is a voice memo. It’s a shame because the rest is beautiful.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): As someone who really hates thinking about death, this song is a really calming way of describing it. Also RIP Carrie Fisher, a certified icon.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): I like the spacy, floaty vibe, and a song comparing dying on a plane to being served a soda is a very unique and interesting take, but ultimately the track feels a little too minimal for me

---

**CarlieScion** (10): gay!

**kirby31200** (10): So haunting and comforting at the same time? Like trying to make peace with death while also being terrified of it.

**runaway3212** (10): Honestly this song is a mood

**seanderlust** (10): the death -> free soda simile is absolutely gorgeous

**turtle-thief** (10): There's something about the way she sings the verses that gets me, also that trumpet in the second verse is magical.

**waluigiest** (10): this song is beautiful and ethereal and the lyrics support it so well I love it

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This is so heavenly and cinematic

**ManofOranges** (9): I miss Carrie Fisher.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): This gets a 9 just for the lyric ‘maybe I died when Carrie Fisher died’

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): the brass touches are so nice

**rickikardashian** (8.3): i can feel this getting robbed already

**1998tweety** (8): alright

**Benthetall1** (8): Kind of a weird one (Coca cola), but intriguing. Good for sitting outside on a cold evening and thinking about the world.

**bbfan132** (7.5): a little underwhelming after the past few tracks but it’s still a pleasant cooldown and the production is great as per usual

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is nice and also stan Carrie Fisher

**vayyiqra** (7): :frowning: me too

**wavingwolves** (7): imagining my own death is a pasttime of mine too! and rip carrie fisher, such an inspiring and amazing person

**daretheghost** (5): It just doesn’t resonate with me.

**shhhneak** (5): I appreciate Shura’s experimentation with sounds even when it doesn’t totally work for me.

**stryxen** (5): I miss carrie fisher :( but this song is a bit uninteresting

**cremeebrulee** (4): i like the line about death being complimentary but the rest of the song doesn’t work for me
