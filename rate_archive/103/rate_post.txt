Remember when VH1 played music retrospectives around the clock? I sure do and I miss it terribly. If you weren't around for the series at it's peak, it's easy to miss how great these specials were. Just by looking at some of their lists at face value the order of the songs could be a little wonky to say the least, even if the spots were chosen by votes. But when you step back from the specifics and look at the big picture, you would get an extremely diverse and thorough crash course into the trends and music of the time. You'd get the indie darlings, the headlining acts, the flashes in the pans, the award winners, and the novelty acts all in one. It's better to not think of their lists as statements of overall quality, but more as the definitive songs that created the soundtrack of the decade. If you don't know much about a particular genre or decade of music, their lists are an incredible first step into discovering so much great music. Me and my lovely cohost u/pearllouise will be hosting this great look into the past where we will be rating their greatest songs of the 90's list! From TRL pop to gangsta rap to grunge it's all here! Throw on some flannel to get into the mood because things are about to get totally tubular!

# A brief history of the series

VH1 started their "The Greatest" series in 2002 when they counted down the 100 sexiest artists of all time (number one was Madonna, of course it was Madonna). The early specials were not really what they would be known for as they still had a bit of time before they found their groove. Mostly the earlier episodes would be more along the lines of "50 Greatest Teen Idols" and "100 Most Outrageous Celebrity Moments" and stuff like that. Early "The Greatest" episodes did have their moments like their list of hard rock bands, but when I see people talk about their favorite countdowns I mostly see people bring up the late 2000's episodes. The first decade end retrospective came out in 2006 when the counted down the 100 Greatest Songs of the 80's and this was the first time I stumbled upon the series and I immediately fell in love. The series would continue on this trend with 90's and 00's retrospectives as well as counting down the greatest one hit wonders of both the 80's and the 90's.

Luckily enough for us, somebody was kind enough to upload almost the entire"[100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80's"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPakYfhWhG8) special onto Youtube so if you're curious to see what they were like feel free to check that out. If you don't want to watch, imagine 100 bite sized One Hit Wonderland episodes by Todd in the Shadows and you kind of get the idea. As a matter of fact Todd has mentioned in the past that the specials were influential on his content and the phrase "One Hit Wonderland" is actually mentioned several times throughout the 80's retrospective. Most of the series has unfortunately been lost to time which makes it all the more important that we look back at one of the most popular countdowns they did, and rerank all the songs in Popheads image.

# Bonus Rate

2. [The Cure - Friday I'm In Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucX9hVCQT_U)

10. [Sublime - Santeria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEYN5w4T_aM)

RULES/INSTRUCTIONS

Here are the rules ~~that I mostly copy and pasted from the disco rate~~ on how to submit scores.

* We will be rating **100 songs** in this rate, and yes, **YOU MUST RATE THEM ALL FOR YOUR SCORES TO COUNT**. This is breaking the record for the longest rate in Popheads history so we will be lenient with extensions. There's a ton of quality in here and we want to make sure you get as much time as possible with all the songs.
* Assign a score to each song between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, so long as they are to one decimal place (i.e. 5.4 is fine, 5.42 is not). Also, please use periods (.) for the decimal places and not commas (,)
* You may give **ONE** song an 11 and **ONE** song a 0. Reserve these scores for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate. This is only for the main rate. You CANNOT give a 0 or an 11 for songs in the bonus rate.
* The only place you should submit your scores is at the preprepared link found below.
* Feel free to change your scores at any time up to the due date, just PM me about it.
* I reserved the right to reject and ask you to resubmit any ballot if I feel you are unfairly sabotaging any of the artists and/or have obviously inflated differences between them. Unless the Pac/Biggie beef is somehow still alive on r/popheads I don't think this should be a big problem.
* If you would like to add a comment to your scores **(which is encouraged!!)**, the correct way to format them can be found below.

>Korn - Freak On a Leash: 3 I prefer my freaks to be free range

That is **THE ONLY WAY** to properly form comments. Here are some incorrect examples

>The Presidents of the United States of America – Peaches 5 Got pears in animal crossing. Still salty  
>  
>Sinéad O’Connor – Nothing Compares 2 U: I'm giving this song a 2 because there's a 2 in the title  
>  
>\*NSYNC – Tearin Up My Heart: (1) Man of the Woods really tore up my heart JUSTIN

* You may also write comments for the album as a whole, directly next to the album title in the prepared message link.

# Okay now, here's where things get a little funky so even if you've participated in rates before please read!!!

* There's a lot of songs here, and every attempt we've made at making a premade link has failed us. Because of this there's two ways to submit your scores.
* Option one: has you copy and pasting the pastebin link into a standard message. Then make the message out to u/steelstepladder and I should receive it.
* Option two: to submit is to use the premade links divided into two parts. If you want to use this option please submit both parts at the same time!
* Because this is a bit weird I'll be happy to field any questions in the comments or in my DMs.

# [OPTION ONE: HERE IS THE PASTEBIN LINK](https://pastebin.com/embed_js/MMB24sPE)

# OPTION TWO: HERE IS [PART 1](https://tinyurl.com/yyxobc3t) AND HERE IS [PART 2](https://tinyurl.com/y3qtgmsk)

# Last thing is [HERE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/16w49cHJGnLGfJUGCs7M4A?si=gD-396-XR6y1B6PJR_it8A) is the link to the spotify playlist and [HERE](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/vh1s-100-greatest-songs-of-the-90s/pl.u-e98lM2msd3XkZz) is apple music's playlist!!!

Turn on some Ren and Stimpy, get out your beanie babies, and fill out a ballot It's time to get radical!!

Be sure to participate in [last month's rates!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/iky1wq/august_rate_updates_classic_discoemo_15redemption/?)
