**steelstepladder** (9): IT MADE IT YES!!! I was so sad for the longest time thinking that this was going to be day one but it just barely had enough points to squeak into day 2. Alice in Chains was always the heaviest of the big four grunge acts so I knew they were going to struggle a bit. I saw a few people say they didn't like Layne's voice which is baffling to me. On the chorus he just wails with some power behind it! Genuinely fantastic all around with that massive riff propelling the song forward.

**pearllouise** (6.5): Alright Popheads, I don‚Äôt want anyone making any Lady Gaga ‚Äúmy name isn‚Äôt Alice‚Äù jokes when we rate Alice Cooper. Got that?

---

**bbfan132** (10): not usually a huge grunge guy but i love this track, i love the guitar and the vocals here

**HermionesBook** (10): super catchy

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is a hit.

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm a big fan of guitars yes

**vapourlomo** (9.5): Seattle popped out angsty bangers like this for days, but I have an appreciation for the wailing chorus on this one. JEEEEEEEEESUS CHRIIIIIIIST

**dlong5665** (9): I used to be so into alice in chains as a kid lol this song is fucking wonderful

**Mysario** (9): while I'm happy that the Big Four of Grunge are all on this list, why is this the halfway mark? shame on you VH1

**runaway3212** (9): this new lonely island and JT colab sounds different from their last work

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): unfortunately i have a feeling this will leave early

**RainbowWhale101** (8): Not the type of music I usually listen to but I really enjoyed this! The guitar was awesome

**skargardin** (8): bop

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): Did every man in the 90s just vaguely sound like the guy from Pearl Jam

**RVA\_101** (7.3): Distinctly remember this being one of my introductions to the grunge genre aside from the requisite Nirvana/Pearl Jam/Soundgarden/STP. RIP Layne Staley, one hell of a voice. I think the guitarist is running a talkbox through and adding distortion, making that unique tone that defines the song's sound, I love that stuff.

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute i guess

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): I like the guitar, but not much else

**moonagenightmares** (6.2): nice guitar solo

**camerinian** (6): this is just a general comment, but how do all the songs in this rate have identical YouTube comment sections, why are gen x so predictable

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i can appreciate this even though im not a rock fan, but i don‚Äôt care about it that much

**rslashpoopheads** (6): jesus christ

**MrMoodle** (5.4): (#72)

**kirby31200** (5): Honestly the only Alice In Chains song I like is Them Bones since it was on ATV Offroad

**MrSwearword** (5): cute but who's really returning to this kind of rock

**waluigiest** (4): I see what they‚Äôre doing but idk if it‚Äôs working

**twat\_brained** (2): this feels like the worst of Guns N' Roses and Nirvana. Overrated band

**kappyko** (1): horrific wank

**valyse** (1): The lead singer‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt. The sound that drove the style of alt-rock to a truly dark place.

**pearllouise** (5.5): Just wanted to take the opportunity to thank Counting Crows for their work on the iconic Shrek sequel.

**steelstepladder** (2): We are just slowly getting all the white adult contemporary acts out of the way early. And that's fine, theres a few good ones in there but for the most part it wasn't a very ambitious genre; and when many songs in this rate are all time classics they stand out more. Mr Jones is the perfect example of a song that while theres nothing inherently wrong with it, I just don't care.

---

**1998tweety** (10): wait why is this excellent

**agentofscranton** (10): these are the accidentally in love guys?! we love versatility

**bbfan132** (10): i should probably find this aggravating but i‚Äôve always found this super fun to listen and sing along to

**Mysario** (10): no matter where this places, I can tell you this is the most robbed song in this rate

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Iconic.

**ggal2020** (9.5): there is (tragically) no dave matthews band on this list, so I guess this is the closest we‚Äôll get

**hunnybee12** (9): shalalalalala

**ManofOranges** (8): Such a cheesy song to me but I also do like it.

**runaway3212** (8): This song is just great, but not more than that

**camerinian** (7): This is such a normal song but it's just lovely isn't it?

**MrSwearword** (7): just because it's weird enough to look past that this group deserved nothing

**ReallyCreative** (7): probably my least favorite of their hits, the chorus is iconic but every other part is pretty forgettable

**vapourlomo** (7): Man, you've gotta love those crunchy granola mid '90s vibes.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I lost it at the "sha la la la la la la la"

**RVA\_101** (6.4): I'll admit, this song just didn't do much for me.

**kirby31200** (6): Why I love Matchbox Twenty and Goo Goo Dolls and don't really care for this, I do not know

**wavingwolves** (6): i don't hate this but it can tiring very easily and it was def overplayed at the time

**MrMoodle** (5.3): (#73)

**skargardin** (5): well, anyways..

**stryxen** (5): a cawnversation

**TragicKingdom1** (5): the voice crack in the chorus is the only thing notable about this

**twat\_brained** (5): A white middle-aged man with those dreads would not fly in this era of music lol. If this song was inspired by Billy Paul's "Me and Mrs. Jones" then I feel incredibly sorry for him lol why couldn't VH1 just replace this with All The Small Things or something

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this feels like its a drug metaphor

**Roxieloxie** (2.8): he sounds like he's having a crisis while singing this

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): this song is boring as hell sorry

**anothertown** (2): Amy Winehouse is unbothered

**HermionesBook** (2): not awful but boring tbh i forgot about this song

**awhile2** (1): wow i had never heard this song before and i hope to never hear it again

**moonagenightmares** (1): when i heard the shalalala at the beginning i started laughing and couldn‚Äôt stop until the end of this song

**pearllouise** (7.5): Is it weird that the first thing that came to mind when I first listen to this was the sample from that song Flo Rida did a few years ago? I know that sounds pretty weird.

**steelstepladder** (7): This is clearly a bit of a controversial opinion but out of all the pop rap in this rate I think this is the best. No amount of Mark Whalberg being a shitty human being can take away how slick that production is. Just a fantastic beat and the gospel singing just throws the chorus over the top. Sometimes you have to give credit where credit is due. Even if a lot of what makes this song work comes off as happy accidents.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**Mysario** (10): I support TK

**TragicKingdom1** (10): jesus christ this production goes OFF!!!!! it's incredible that a cheesy song by a white rapper in the early 90s has aged so well

**vapourlomo** (10): This is better than any of Mark's acting performances (although The Other Guys is close)

**ReallyCreative** (9): loving how this rate is rubberbanding between eurodance/hip-hop and dad rock

**Roxieloxie** (9): dancy bop

**runaway3212** (9): The Beach Boys outsold, but not by a lot

**u/astrologicalangel** (9): why do I have nostalgia for the worst songs?

**waluigiest** (9): feels great

**camerinian** (8): if this was an instrumental with just the chorus, straight 10, what a fucking banger, Mark Wahlberg just had to go be garbage tho

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love how marky mark is the worse part of the song. The production and sample is great though

**MrSwearword** (8): basically because of the sample and the fact that Mark Wahlberg used to be fuckboy hot before becoming schmoozy hot

**skargardin** (8): this bops

**twat\_brained** (8): This would be a 10 if Mark Wahlberg a) didn‚Äôt sound like speedballed Vanilla Ice and b) the video relied less on his sex appeal. Mark has one thing Vanilla Ice doesn‚Äôt have; Loleatta Holloway. I had to confirm this wasn‚Äôt Martha Wash coming for everyone‚Äôs necks again, THAT‚ÄôS how great she sounds on this record.

**TiltControls** (7.2): fuck Mark Wahlberg. But also... this is a bop

**J\_Toe** (7): this sounds like a parody of early 90s hip hop

**rslashpoopheads** (7): :)

**HermionesBook** (6.8): honestly such a fun song

**MrMoodle** (6.8): (#51)

**RVA\_101** (6.7): I knew Mark Walhberg was a rapper in the 90s before acting but I didn't know he actually spit hard like that lmao, he has that real LL Cool J flow. The sample chorus is the best part of this, it's not bad actually, even if the score here looks harsh. It's just not anything exceptional.

**seanderlust** (6.1): why is his vocal delivery so aggressive? otherwise, this is a vibe. shoutout to the piano towards the end. mocking shoutout the anti d-r-u-g-g-i-e line.

**hunnybee12** (6): the chorus is a 10, the rest‚Ä¶

**yourfacesucksass** (6): thinking it over, this is such a strange song lmao. marky mark trying so hard to be hard over a house beat. still kind of a shit person.

**bbfan132** (5): i like the production and the sample but mark wahlberg is a bigoted piece of shit so i can‚Äôt give this a higher score than 5

**jsonphile** (5): pretty bold of them to name their song the same as one of the greatest songs of all time. That said, the hook is pretty great, but dear god the rapping is bad and I can‚Äôt believe this is Oscar nominated actor Mark Wahlberg rapping these horribly dumb lyrics

**ManofOranges** (5): The hook for me is a 10, Mark Wahlberg's rapping is a -10, but he was also super hot so I'm gonna give him a little bit of a pass.

**slimboyfriend** (4.4): Stream Love Sensation by Loleatta Holloway instead

**anothertown** (3): Mark Wahlberg has had such an embarrassing life

**kirby31200** (3): One point for each of Mark Wahlberg's hate crimes

**splusten** (3): I gotta say, I thought people were being harsh about Mark Wahlberg's past until I heard this song

**wavingwolves** (3): this mark wahlberg song doesn't give me good vibrations, no

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this sounds like a 90s cartoon rap that would be about math class or something

**dlong5665** (1): ew

**sandyfishnets** (1): a good song until he starts rapping

**nbapip** (0): 10 for the chorus -1000000 for mark "horrific person" wahlber

**pearllouise** (6): I could make a joke about Miley Cyrus but then I realized she wasn‚Äôt even born yet when this song came out.

**steelstepladder** (5): Another song one place lower than it was on the original list. Good job VH1 you got this one perfectly right. I think the chorus to this song is pretty rad and the gospel singing at the end is great but... the preachyness man. Seeing Todd's trainwreckords of Arrested Development makes all the little nagging lines hit so much worse, even if musically it all comes together fairly well. It's unfortunate because once again, the gospel at the end kills.

**pearllouise** (6): Why do I feel like this song could have been a great mall pop song that was on every soccer mom‚Äôs driving playlist (if they even had playlists in the 90s idk I wasn‚Äôt even born yet)

**steelstepladder** (1): I gave a decent amount of ones out but I'm pretty sure this is my last one. One of many songs that I feel like the good part is five seconds long and the rest of the song comes across as a massive slog. I've never really cared for Paula Cole between this and Where Have All the Cowboys Gone and to me it sticks out even worse behind so many classics.

---

**1998tweety** (10): oh wow i remember loving this song when i was a child, it sounded a bit better then though ddddd

**bbfan132** (10): tbt when i would watch episodes of dawson‚Äôs creek on youtube when i was 13 and 14 after i found out that there was a gay character on the show

**fadedblue09** (10): That chorus rings a lot of bells omg. Nearly snatched my 11.

**ReallyCreative** (10): no patience bitches make some fucking noise!!!

**runaway3212** (10): Superior

**TiltControls** (10): i've never even seen dawson's creek but something about this song just fills me with nostalgia.

**anothertown** (9): The way that I‚Äôve never watched a single episode of Dawson‚Äôs Creek and yet this still evokes nostalgia, catharsis, etc‚Ä¶ Mz Paula Cole did her thing

**succulentils** (8.5): lol when there's vocal layering in older songs and I don't know who sings them, I'm never sure if it's a group like Wilson Phillips or a solo artist

**dlong5665** (8): I hate that this is the Paula Cole song people remember because it's great, but "Where Have All The Cowboys Gone" is just a masterpiece

**kirby31200** (8): Why were songs in the 90s so long

**ManofOranges** (8): Another sappy song but for that I love it. Come through Dawson's Creek.

**MrSwearword** (8): the Dawson's Creek theme song is fine for what it is

**yourfacesucksass** (8): jen dies at the end ugh!!!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): never knew who sang this song until now

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I'm struggling to hold on to the melody but her voice is lovely.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i don‚Äôt care about 1 tree hill

**kappyko** (7): i like how the b-side to this is named hitler's brothers

**sadshrub** (7): Boring, but she do got pipes

**twat\_brained** (7): I don‚Äôt get it, she pastiches haughty old royal subjects before pastiching‚Ä¶ Ginger Rogers? Also, I was watching New Girl and heard this song, so‚Ä¶ shout out Liz Meriweather and Zooey Deschanel for writing that in

**waluigiest** (7): beautiful chorus

**camerinian** (6): "The song is featured in a plot-critical backstory in the 2019 animated film The Angry Birds Movie 2." God bless Wikipedia

**sandyfishnets** (6): the chorus is great, but the rest of the song is kinda bland

**seanderlust** (5.8): i mean, it's a great song about PTSD but if i'm being honest I stopped paying attention midway through

**RainbowWhale101** (5): Good lyrics but boring production

**pearllouise** (6): I love how Can I Get An Amen from RPDR was the first result that came up when I looked this song up on Spotify.

**steelstepladder** (5): I'm going to agree with the consensus by saying this is the wrong Jay-Z song to use. I'm not sure what the right one is (Maybe hard knock life?) but this is the wrong one. No song has ever been made better by adding Ja Rule to it and unfortunately I can't be surprised at Jay-Z's placement here even though hes obviously a legend.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me after finding out that the chorus doesn‚Äôt go ‚Äúcan i get a what what‚Äù https://media.tenor.com/images/1fcab8ec280fb28d85be6bf162f1b9ef/tenor.gif

**kappyko** (10): amazing beat and amil is awesome

**runaway3212** (10): Jay-Z is really good here, like insanely good.

**vapourlomo** (10): From 1996 through 2003, nobody was better than Hov. The gravitas, the swagger, the flow, the rhymes...he was untouchable. This is just one of many showcases.

**wavingwolves** (10): can i get a WOOP WOOP

**dlong5665** (9): The production is so good and ms amil kills it

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is the first time I've ever heard the uncensored version of this song omg this is disorienting!!!! a classic though

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Coochie mane.

**MrSwearword** (8): good but one of the lesser tracks to Jay Z's name

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i do not care for beyonce's husband, but he made some points with this song

**RVA\_101** (7.6): Smh like Fiona Apple, I wish they picked another song of Hov but I get why they picked this one sort of. But still. Can't Knock the Hustle, Big Pimpin, Hard Knock Life, Brooklyn's Finest. This shit is still a classic, but not to the level of his other songs I named. That's why it's not a 10. And for some reason I just don't dig Amil's verse all that much even though she flows well and meshes well w/ Hov on the hook. Ja Rule and Hov kill it though. Production by Jay-Z standards though is bland. When Timbaland, Kanye, Primo, Neptunes, etc get behind the boards it's a lot higher quality production.

**MrMoodle** (7.5): (#39)

**bbfan132** (7): this was the jay-z song that was picked by the voters? it‚Äôs pretty good but he definitely has better songs lol

**cremeebrulee** (7): this was the jay-z they picked? i

**ggal2020** (7): rip ja rule

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**ignitethephoenix** (6): jay z has so much better this is ehh

**ManofOranges** (6): Me when I'm ordering at a restaurant

**skargardin** (6): well..

**twat\_brained** (5.5): I've complained nonstop about songs that deserve to be here which aren't, but I should be grateful that this is here instead of something like Macarena, or Godney forbid "I Believe I Can Fly".

**Mysario** (5): it's got good lyricism, nice flow, and a fun chorus I can't sing but it's kinda boring instrumentally so it's hard to really like sadly

**camerinian** (4.5): The idea of Jay-Z being a 90s rapper just straight up doesn't compute for me. The idea of him being a singer shouldn't compute with anyone

**anothertown** (4): boring up until Ja comes in

**conceptualromance** (4): misogyny lost this round!

**kirby31200** (4): I have no memory of this being in Rush Hour

**moonagenightmares** (2): the best part of this song being the woop woop is just sad

**pearllouise** (9): While other pop girls back in her time were belting out high notes and singing about teen angst, Lisa Loeb danced to the beat of her own drum. Her iconic hit ‚ÄúStay‚Äù was her way of sharing the music that she wanted to write, not following the same rhythm that other music peers seemed to follow

**steelstepladder** (8): A better Taylor Swift song than most Taylor Swift songs. I adore how the structure changes and really opens itself up throughout the whole song. It just feels very genuine and real in a way that a lot of songs try and emulate but can't pull off. There's an intimacy to her words that makes the flow of the song feel natural and effortless even if there's no real chorus. Great stuff

**pearllouise** (7): Okay but can someone explain who names their band ‚ÄúBarenaked Ladies‚Äù?

**steelstepladder** (5): I loved this song to death when I was a kid. It feels like 90's childhood for better and for worse. My ears perk up everytime I hear the opening "ITS BEEN" and that's never a bad thing but I got kind of sick of it after playing it so much as a kid. Still iconic as hell though.

---

**anothertown** (10): You are in denial if you don‚Äôt think this song is a ten‚Ä¶. Here are my favorite lyric moments- ‚Äúboom anime babes‚Äù // ‚Äúlike Kurosawa I don‚Äôt make films, k I don‚Äôt make films‚Äù // ‚Äúlike Sting I‚Äôm tantric‚Äù

**camerinian** (10): Sincerely, turning on Spotify radio for his song and having a fucking stupid time is one of my favourite stress-relief tactics after a hard day. This song is instant ape-brain mode

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i love the rap music

**ManofOranges** (10): It's honestly hard to believe that these are the same guys that made the Big Bang Theory theme... I just love this song so much. I know it's probably gonna go out at like #57 though. I can feel it.

**MrSwearword** (10): "chickety china ch-chinese chicken" is the worst lyric that somehow works in the herstory of music

**Mysario** (10): IT'S BEEN

**seanderlust** (10): IT'S BEN

**TiltControls** (10): we all love the most celebrated Canadian alt-rock band of the mid to late 90's!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): we love the digimon movie

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a classic, also Canadian icons

**splusten** (9.3): Brought to you by that one Digimon movie for some reason

**ReallyCreative** (9): such an annoying banger, an obnoxious bop, corrosive serotonin, overall: an iconic classic and one of the worst songs ever made

**vapourlomo** (9): Massive props for anyone who can pull this off at karaoke

**waluigiest** (9): Digimon movie anyone?

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Peak 90s humor!

**kappyko** (8): one of my fondest memories volunteering at the arts market is a guy performing a barenaked ladies song and saying "that was barenaked ladies. that's the name of the band not a request" i laughed at it and he pointed me out because i guess i was the only person that found it funny and it was nice to have that moment

**kirby31200** (8): Stream Smooth by Neil Cicierega unironically the superior version sorry. But seriously this song is kinda cute

**wavingwolves** (7.8): this is goofy but so fun

**aestheticen** (7.5): The lyrics ruined this song

**sadshrub** (7.2): Ah yes

**jsonphile** (7): if I had a nickel for every song I‚Äôve ever listened to that mentioned Chinese chicken I‚Äôd only have one nickel but it‚Äôs still weird that it happened even once

They get no respect in the states and the fact that One Week is the only thing anyone knows by them here makes me so sad, Brian Wilson is a top 5 pop song of all time for me.

**steelstepladder** (8): DAMN! I really like this one! I like how direct and to the point it is. People really seemed to dislike the production behind this one but I've always loved the dreamy atmosphere of it. Honestly kind of wish it was higher.

**pearllouise** (5): I knew the name Sophie B. Hawkins sounded familiar. Thank you VH1 for reminding me she still exists.

---

**bbfan132** (10): everything about this is perfect

**conceptualromance** (10): this is such a mood

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sapphic anthem

**kappyko** (10): amazing led zeppelin sample holy fuck

**runaway3212** (10): I wish I had a crush so I could relate to this song

**succulentils** (9.5): The texture in her voice as she sings an octave above the backing vocals

**1998tweety** (9): im ascending

**chillbumps5** (9): this has the same beat as pokemon world

**ggal2020** (9): big lesbian vibes

**ManofOranges** (9): This one is also sappy I think but that's par for the course for me.

**anothertown** (8): ethereal lesbian bop... yes!!!

**camerinian** (8): the way that title is sung is top 5 moments in the rate tbh

**RainbowWhale101** (8): Did some research on this song and found out she's singing about a WOMAN!!! Hell yeah to gay 90s anthems!

**ReallyCreative** (8): I love the way this song builds but there's something missing, I need the vocals to be a little clearer at points, and I'm not sure the hook is super compelling

**jsonphile** (7.5): gonna be honest I only know Sophie B. Hawkins because of the Community episode

**wavingwolves** (7.5): there's something so charming about this song

**seanderlust** (7.4): we stan surprise lesbians!

**kirby31200** (7): So dreamlike. But kinda long

**rickikardashian** (7): well its lover

**RVA\_101** (7): It's just straight down the middle alright. Nothing great but nothing outright bad either, it's just kind of....there. I do dig that long note at the end of the bridge though, girls got pipes, gotta respect that, got an extra point just on the vocal performance even if everything else is somewhat underwhelming.

**yourfacesucksass** (7): The chorus kind of makes me cringe but I like the instrumental

**MrMoodle** (6.5): (#55) this song is annoying but i respect it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): The hell is this production?

**skargardin** (6): this is becoming unknown territory for me

**vapourlomo** (6): This just makes me think of that Community episode

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I don't remember anything about this song except for the word "fuck"

**MrSwearword** (5): too mediocre

**Mysario** (5): good for the annual Sophie B Hawkins dance

**plastichaxan** (4.8): i‚Äôm sorry for giving a woman such a low rating but this is boring

**J\_Toe** (4): only know her because of Britta Perry

**sadshrub** (4): Boring

**twat\_brained** (4): I get VH1 had this reputation as an adult-alternative video channel, but who the hell were Sophie B. Hawkins? I've never heard of this band before, especially in the conversation of great 90s artists, and likely will never hear from them again. "TORN" IS RIGHT THERE. "KISS ME" IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE. ARRRRHHGHGHGHGHGHGH

**aestheticen** (3): What is this mixing

**dlong5665** (3): does nothing for me

**u/astrologicalangel** (3): the only thing this has going for it is that it sounds a little like Everybody Want to Rule the World

**pearllouise** (7.5): Can‚Äôt stop thinking about how one man can look at a trash bag and think ‚ÄúYou know, these would make a great pair of pants.‚Äù

**steelstepladder** (2): The pop rap boom of the early 90's is not my go to era for rap music at all. Yes this is iconic but it's also surprisingly forgettable with almost no lines from the actual verses leaving much of an impact. The dance and the image deservedly has its place in rap history but the song itself is kind of underwhelming when you actually sit down and listen to it.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a hometown king

**MrSwearword** (10): cheesy cheesy goodness from someone who was actually more gangsta than their music ever revealed (Thanks Todd in the Shadows!)

**runaway3212** (10): I wanted to link a video of pikachu dodging all moves with double team with this under it, but I can‚Äôt find it, so just imagine that please

**skargardin** (10): BOP ALERT

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - IT BOPS PERIOD

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): I associate this song with like 2006ish and my dad driving me to school. This song and 1985 by bowling for soup were /always/ on

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): mega bop, classic

**kappyko** (9): "super freak" sample is awesome but the real star of the song is the fucking insane breakdown even if the "oh oh" copy pastes are horrible. mc hammer is fine as a rapper too!!!

**waluigiest** (8): corny AND timeless!

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): okay sorry i know this song is a meme but it‚Äôs actually good so...

**splusten** (7.2): I swear I remember this song coming out in the 80's and I wasn't even born until '97.

**Mysario** (7): this is the corniness I strive for

**stryxen** (7): oh MY lord I have heard this song too many times

**TiltControls** (6.7): little memey, but also a lot of fun

**MrMoodle** (6.5): (#57)

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): corona anthem

**kirby31200** (6): Better as a catchphrase than a song. Try to recite a lyric from the verses, you can't

**ManofOranges** (6): It's cute but that's about it

**vapourlomo** (6): Great hook, fun Rick James sample...but outside of that, it's just okay. Super repetitive.

**RVA\_101** (5.7): Classic Rick James sample. And I forgot from that bridge that that's where Big Sean got the sample for the 'oooh' background vox in his Dance (Ass) song. This song itself isn't anything special and kind of goes on a while since he doesn't really spit that much rhyme. Would've loved some more bars than that, Hammer.

**anothertown** (5): U Can‚Äôt Touch This is an iconic scam from McHammer: At the time of release, he both didn‚Äôt credit the sample and he didn‚Äôt release the song as a single so people had to buy the album

**jsonphile** (5): anything good about this song is from Super Freak

**slimboyfriend** (5): iconic but also just boring

**twat\_brained** (5): "dance to this and you're gonna get thinner" Hammer says you'll get skinny listening to this. That said, "Pumps and a Bump" notably does not sample Rick James, so give me that over this at least 25 times out of 10. This is on the same dad-rap level as Baby Got Back and does not deserve a place on this list over something like Pony, which you should give your 10s to in the bonus rate

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): it's more annoying than fun sorry

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): so many commercial parody songs ruined this for me permanently.

**wavingwolves** (4): this is fun but it's like a joke that gets tired too fast

**seanderlust** (3.2): we don't stan copyright infringement

**bbfan132** (3): i remember hearing this constantly when i was younger but it‚Äôs lost its appeal now imo

**rslashpoopheads** (3): This song made me spend an entire year of my childhood traumatized because everyone would always sing it but I only knew Superfreak by Rick James.

**steelstepladder** (8): Sublime are great and this song is great. It's not that I really love this type of rock either. 311 kinda suck. But oh man Sublime just genuinely sound like they are having fun when they are making music. They sound like Summer. Just the sun shining down on a lawnchair by the pool type of Summer. It's great all around.

---

**hunnybee12** (10): ahhh a true classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): so i bopped to this for 21 years of my life and just learned its about a guy‚Äôs girlfriend cheating on him AND the lead singer died of a drug overdose before this song was even released‚Ä¶ huh

**ManofOranges** (10): The opening to this song is forever stuck in my head, it's so good.

**Mysario** (10): while I can't be too upset that VH1 tried their best to fit 99 iconic songs on their top 100 list, having no Sublime felt like an odd omission in general

**rslashpoopheads** (10): sad boyz rise up

**TragicKingdom1** (9): iykyk /u/mysario

**waluigiest** (9): I LOVE SKA

**wavingwolves** (9): i personally also don't practice santeria

**TiltControls** (8.5): how did this not make the list?!? I feel like this is one of those essential 90's songs

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): classic

**bbfan132** (8): brings me back to when my brother would blast their music in the car on road trips constantly‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a stoner now, unsurprisingly

**MrSwearword** (8): one of those begrudging high scores because it's fine for what it is.

**RainbowWhale101** (8): I really loved the reggae beat on this

**RVA\_101** (8): RIP Bradley Nowell, this is probably their best song, so serene, the guitar and bass have a great groove going

**anothertown** (7.5): Summertime!!!!!

**chillbumps5** (7.5): cherub rock bangs

**splusten** (7.3): Great to belt while drunk and only then.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): don't let Travis McCoy or Bruno Mars near this song again please.

**camerinian** (1): I fucking hate Sublime and always have. White guy reggae is the worst genre and Sublime are one of the most insufferable 90s alt staple bands. There's a picture of Sublime in the dictionary next to the word "flaccid". Sublime are the favourite band of the guy in your art class who is somehow always high but refuses to tell you where he gets/keeps his stash. This song apparently has a narrative and yet you wouldn't know based on the singer's weird wannabe-Chilli Peppers inflection and dragging out of syllables and refusal to actually even fill the meter on the second verse. The fact that Wikipedia calls this song "ska" is an insult to every band who actually made music in the genre that sounded fun and lively or spoke to societal unease instead of speaking directly to the frat wanker who corners you at a party and tries to talk about UFC. This gets a 1 off of technicality but this is an eternal 0 band. Eat shit Sublime

**valyse** (1): Sorry Sublime, but I just have an irrational dislike of you.

**vapourlomo** (1): nope nope nope nope I cannot do Sublime. Maybe my least favorite band ever. I'd honestly take Creed over this smug white-boy reggae. (unless it's the Lana cover)

**pearllouise** (8): LL Cool J could knock me out and I wouldn‚Äôt be mad

**steelstepladder** (6): The best opening line in the rate? Unfortunately it kind of all goes downhill from there. Not by a lot but I don't think its an exageration to say this song peaks earlier. It kind of wears out its welcome by minute four unfortunately. The beat and chorus still slap though.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): busta rhymes :heart:

**MrSwearword** (10): LL Cool J's peak that isn't named Doin It

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay so like two years ago my dad drove me like 80 miles out so i could go to B&N to pick up the Spiderverse Art Book, and as soon as we were twenty minutes away we stoped to get gas and my dad realized he didnt have his wallet which added a little spice of ~fear~ on the trip cause we were in prime redneck country so my dad started joking about how he needed to change his music to something nonthreatening so we didnt get pulled over, anyway he turned on the LL Cool J radio on spotify so the rest of the ride home we listened to it. When this song came on I recognized it from this amv and my dad proceeded to tell me this story about how when he was in college he went on like a 13 hour roadtrip with his friends and they blasted this song the entire way there cause they were just that hype .anyway now this song reminds me of my dad anytime i hear it and i think thats nice

**runaway3212** (10): the energy in this song is on point

**RVA\_101** (9.5): DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK, I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS. Iconic opening line. Iconic sampled backing vocals (that's Sly & the Family Stone, one of the greatest artists of all time btw), the scratching, the 'Gangsta Boogie' sample, LL knocked it out of the park with this one. Even though I never liked that stop and go flow he had ('I exCEL, they all FAIL, rock the BELLS', uk), this song is undeniable. Great song to get you amped up.

**anothertown** (9): fucking smacks!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): sometimes I forget LL cool j was once a young person since he‚Äôs is still every even though he‚Äôs older

**plastichaxan** (8.5): okay ll cool j was part of my awakening i owe him at least that but this is actually good

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**wavingwolves** (8): i have to dock some points because of that fake crying baby noise but otherwise it's a great song

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): we do love a man who listens to his mother

**MrMoodle** (7.2): (#44)

**1998tweety** (7): shes ok

**bbfan132** (7): pretty good but got kind of old after the first two minutes

**conceptualromance** (7): I had no idea LL Cool J was so furious! Destruction, terror, and mayhem indeed!

**Mysario** (7): one time I heard the [Five Finger Death Punch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s87ToUxZY-Q) attempt in full and it made me appreciate the original so much more

**splusten** (7): Did she though L.L.? Did she?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): This is just WAAAAYYYY too repetitive

**ManofOranges** (6): Well this song is knocking me out cause I'm kinda bored!

**TragicKingdom1** (6): lowkey not a necessary inclusion in this rate, kinda repetitive

**twat\_brained** (6): I'm nowhere near convinced LL Cool J could knock me out. He absolutely could, but the point is I don't hear it. I'd hear it better if it came from ODB, Tupac, Biggie, or even Missy Elliott or Lil Kim. Not James, though. He comes across as a black Marky Mark here.

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): this song is corny as fuck

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Alright Karen.

**waluigiest** (4): important but at what cost

**dlong5665** (3): the idea of LL Cool J of all people trying to be hard...

**steelstepladder** (10): I think Fuck and Run is better as well but with Liz I will take what I can get. Exile in Guyvile is one of the best albums ever made and I'm not sure this hits the same way if you haven't listened to it in full. Just a bunch of tangled emotions desperately trying to unweave  itself and this comes as a shot of pure bliss for three minutes. All the little guitar licks and riffs come together for a song that is probably better than the sum of its parts

**pearllouise** (4.5): Anyone else getting ‚ÄúHi‚Äô I am Liz Phair and you‚Äôre watching Disney Channel‚Äù vibes from this track

---

**bbfan132** (10): stream exile in guyville, it‚Äôs a great alt/indie rock album that is overlooked these days

**dlong5665** (10): great song from an all time great album

**DaniG08765** (9): should be Fuck and Run or Divorce Song but Phair is a 9

**moooo566** (9): the shitpost for this better be HWC from her self titled

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**wavingwolves** (8.5): makes me feel cool

**ManofOranges** (8): This one is fine.

**MrSwearword** (8): only because Liz Phair's guitar work is god-tier

**skargardin** (8): bop

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Boring chorus but I liked the guitar riff

**twat\_brained** (7): well, see, the problem, Liz is that you are saying something. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I get the alt-rock chick appeal, but if this is how it sounds, combined with the trajectory that led to her self-titled album, I can understand where Pitchfork was coming from.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I really thought it was a man the whole time...

**pearllouise** (7): I don‚Äôt know why but when I think of Lenny Kravitz, the first thing that came to mind was that unerasable on-stage wardrobe malfunction that no one could unsee.

**steelstepladder** (2): Thats a nice guitar riff you got there but you really don't have to play it for the entire song dude. I riff that busy with that much distortion over and over again wears out its welcome quick in this type of song. Lenny Kravitz was always an artists I could just never get into. Every time I listen to his music I felt like I could just listen to other artists like Jimi Hendrix and get the same thing but better. Idk, this is another score that feels harsh on my part but I could really live without it.

**pearllouise** (7.5): Can‚Äôt wait to see how many Popheads users misgender Hanson.

**steelstepladder** (5): Actually pretty surprised this didn't clear a 7 average.

---

**1998tweety** (10): MMMassive Bop

**aestheticen** (10): A massive serotonin boost

**bbfan132** (10): ridiculous but i still love it

**hunnybee12** (10): they were too wise

**moooo566** (10): iconic use of record scratch

**MrSwearword** (10): shut the fuck up, Hanson is cheesy on their only successful song. Deal.

**selegend** (10): mmmbop indeed

**twat\_brained** (10): I won‚Äôt ask ‚Äúhow can anyone hate this‚Äù because, well... it‚Äôs evident that people did. They hated it too much, though, these guys are just

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is better than the jonas brothers whole discography

**camerinian** (9.5): This is like one of those formative "pop music is great and y'all are just cowards" songs for me, and given it did this for me in 2010 when I was 13 and knew the song's reputation well before I actually heard it, I'd go as far as to say it's the song that instilled my immunity to cringe culture. Even though it's been years since I've willingly listened to this, it's got a massive place in my heart as a result of that.

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): to this DAY, i still have my orange 'middle of nowhere' cd with such an impossibly incomprehensible disc design. mmmbop is such a feel-good bop (punz) that you can't help but love it or hate it. (if you hate it idk you're probably off the deep end)

**J\_Toe** (9): I was actually too young to register music when this was released, and didn't find out about it till way later. I was so close to being this song's target demographic when it was released.

**stryxen** (9): me when someone asks me what this song is and I hesitate slightly before saying

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): I don't know what they're saying but I am loving it!

**anothertown** (8.5): If you say you can‚Äôt listen to kpop because you don‚Äôt understand the language but turn around and listen to Mmmbop, I see your ass..

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): icons!

**splusten** (8.2): This song is the king of not being able to understand the verses as it played over the shitty speakers of your PE teachers radios.

**kirby31200** (8): Genuinely one of the best bubblegum hits of the 90s. I'd like to think that if I were a kid in the 90s, I would've been a Hanson fan

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Yes, yes....

**skargardin** (8): banger

**TiltControls** (8): holds up better than it has any right to

**vapourlomo** (7.5): A great bubblegum jam that probably could've been trimmed by a solid minute or so.

**seanderlust** (7.2): hanson be like: life moves very quickly and is gone before you know it. the day to day suffering and hardship distracts you from preserving relationships. in the end, you'll only be left with one or two people who still care about your existence. such is the futility of life. mmbop, duba dop ba

**dlong5665** (7): its of its time but its cute

**ggal2020** (7): I hope hanson‚Äôs doing well these days

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good but not like the pinnacle of 90s pop

**Mysario** (7): when I was 16 years old, my friends and I recorded an acapella of "Heads, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes" so we were basically as talented as Hanson

**RVA\_101** (6.5): This was lowkey a chore to get through lol. I respect it, it's catchy, but I don't know whether to be amused or annoyed that this song topped so many end of the year song polls for '97...

**jsonphile** (6): real cheesy, but I can‚Äôt help but enjoy it

**MrMoodle** (6): (#65) this is less annoying than it should be but it's still pretty annoying

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.2): meh

**conceptualromance** (5): Maybe I‚Äôm just a cranky old lady but this doesn‚Äôt do much for me

**Roxieloxie** (5): I feel like this is one of those 90s songs you had to be there to appreciate and I was not there so I dont

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): she said actual lyrics? MMMNope

**ManofOranges** (4): I just do not care for this song all that much. I guess my mom played this song way too much when I was younger or something because, for me, the charm and enjoyability are just so lacking here. I don't hate it though, per se, but I wouldn't be heartbroken if I didn't hear this one again.

**kappyko** (3): What that song talks about is, you‚Äôve got to hold on to the things that really matter. MMMbop represents a frame of time or the futility of life. Things are going to be gone, whether it‚Äôs your age and your youth, or maybe the money you have, or whatever it is, and all that‚Äôs going to be left are the people you‚Äôve nurtured and have really built to be your backbone and your support system.

**waluigiest** (3): why does this make me so angry

**runaway3212** (2.5): this chorus is like iconicly bad

**awhile2** (1): if this song makes it past day 1 i will have lost all faith in this sub

**steelstepladder** (9): AaaaahhhooooOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo. AaaaahhhoooooOOOOOOOoooo. Man I love this sound. This is somehow simultaneously very of it's time and timeless as most of Kim Deal's work is. Cannonball is probably their most accessible off of Last Splash but that doesn't take away the grove that this thing has. Also stream Beabadoobee. She's doing this type of thing wonderfully.

**pearllouise** (4): Hey look, it‚Äôs Courtney Love‚Äôs understudy.

---

**awhile2** (10): i still dont know what the lyrics to the prechorus are and ive probably heard the song like 300 times

**bbfan132** (10): i fucking love kim deal, this is the perfect 90s alt rock song

**dlong5665** (10): this song is a masterpiece and the deal sisters are the best

**MrSwearword** (10): it hits all the right notes for me

**1998tweety** (7.5): where are the words, its decent tho

**MrMoodle** (7.4): (#40)

**RainbowWhale101** (7): I wish this song was mixed differently, I didn‚Äôt like not being able to hear the vocals over the guitar.

**twat\_brained** (7): Why are the guitars mixed so goddamn loud against the vocals? All I can discern is some tongue-in-cheek description of this as a reggae song?

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): the mixing seems off here...also just kind of filler to me. The jarring music changes are annoying

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): we love female fronted bands but WHAT IS SHE SAYING!!!

**RVA\_101** (6.5): aWOOOOOOOooo

**kirby31200** (4): Not my thing

**ManofOranges** (4): The only thing I remember about this one is the fact that the band is called the breeders (why??)

**CritneySpearz** (3): ummmmmm‚Ä¶. interesting

**RandomHypnotica** (2): This was weird, just felt like a lot of guitar with some drowned out vocals and some really weird awkward silences and structure

**steelstepladder** (2): The definition of a song perfectly fine for what it is that I could 100% live without. One of the many adult contemporary songs thats just a bit too middle of the road for me. Theres just not enough weird edges in this to make me be attached to it in any way shape or form.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): :)

**conceptualromance** (9): y‚Äôall mind if I just go ahead now?

**hunnybee12** (9): bop!

**twat\_brained** (9): it's hard to get more 90s than this. Like when I think of 90s pop rock, this is what I imagine it sounds like

**valyse** (9): The ultimate Trader Joe‚Äôs turn-up anthem.

**runaway3212** (8.5): insanely great

**bbfan132** (8): kind of repetitive but i‚Äôve always enjoyed this for some reason

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): this, MMMBop and Semi Charmed Life are the same song

**jsonphile** (8): I can‚Äôt help but love this song it just always puts me in a good mood

**kirby31200** (8): Gives me all the Singstar nostalgia

**MrSwearword** (8): only because the song kind of goes in with the drumbeat.

**Mysario** (8): I assume no one here watched "The Sarah Silverman Program" (for the best probably), but the only bit that ever stuck with me is when one guy was always listening to "metal" on his iPod but then his boyfriend finds it and learns that the only song on there is "Two Princes"

**waluigiest** (8): two princes.... a little gay doncha think xx

**rickikardashian** (7.8): this is extremely dumb and positive. i dig it

**RVA\_101** (7.5): It took me a good decade of my life before I learned the name of this song wasn't "Just Go Ahead Now" (no, not while listening just now lol). I think people like to clown this song a little but it's just so catchy. Drum rhythm is so addictive and I love the guitar.

**J\_Toe** (7): I feel like I should have heard this before, but i definitely haven't.

**kappyko** (7): classic power pop chune

**RainbowWhale101** (7): It's a good tune but wow it's so repetivtive

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Like a more boring version of MMMBop.

**vapourlomo** (7): The official anthem of hacky sack!

**wholesomebody** (7): the guitar has always hard carried this song

**yourfacesucksass** (7): i feel like this song has been so commercialized that i just find it extremely cheesy now.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): yet another song that ends up being more annoying than fun given its age, but it's well-constructed and the vocals are better than a lot of similar stuff in this rate

**ManofOranges** (6): It does have an iconic hook, I'll give it that, but that's not enough!

**seanderlust** (5.7): two guys want to marry you. one guy has riches and the approval of your dad. the other guy keeps hinting that you should buy him stuff and offered to get you cheap cigarettes once but never actually did and is WAY too public about how good he thinks he is in bed. wyd?

**MrMoodle** (5.5): (#71)

**slimboyfriend** (5.1): that scatting was tragic

**camerinian** (5): This is a really good hook that really needs a better song to put it in

**Roxieloxie** (5): all of these songs are blending together

**skargardin** (5): yeah this does nothing for me

**wavingwolves** (3): the worst crime of this song is being unremarkable

**steelstepladder** (4): I want to like this one more than I do. Public Enemy, fuck yes. A song about police injustice? Fuck yes. It's all Favor Flav... nope. Chuck D always did the majority of the heavy lifting on most of Public Enemy's best stuff with Flavor being important but mostly there for hype and hooks. When you put him in the drivers seat I don't think it works as well as you would want.

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): still relevant lyrics today

**MrSwearword** (10): "get up and get get get down, 911 is a joke in your town" alone warrants the score

**runaway3212** (10): This is such a good roast insanely great.

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm really feeling the sentiment of this song due personal reasons

**RVA\_101** (9.5): Public Enemy is required education for any hip-hop listener. No exceptions. Shoutout Chuck D.

**Mysario** (8): spill

**twat\_brained** (8): 1312, but I'm not sure this song is as scathing against emergency personnel as something like Killing In The Name. Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if VH1 tacked this on as a promo tool for Flavor of Love.

**vapourlomo** (8): A rare Flava Flav-led PE song! And he kinda nails it

**waluigiest** (8): the alternate meaning of ‚Äúpop a 911‚Äù

**dlong5665** (7): sad how the message of this song is still so fucking relevant

**ManofOranges** (7): The way I looked at the title and thought he was gonna be talking about 9/11 and then realized this song is from the 90s.

**RainbowWhale101** (7): The title of the song made me think it was about 9/11 and I was about to be real concerned

**TiltControls** (8.7): the 90's knew how to do anger anthems right

**twat\_brained** (8.3): alternative? In hindsight the Beastie Boys were really just the version of House of Pain which somehow managed a fruitful career. Which, as Lindsay Ellis describes, is predicated on the basis of ‚Äúwe like fun.‚Äù So honestly, good for them.

**steelstepladder** (8): Just a lowkey great song thats influence has been extremely obvious if you've been paying attention to how pop music has unfolded in the part decade. Portishead especially has been getting the critical revaluation treatment within the past few years as their brand of triphop has become the footprint for artists like Lana Del Rey. Last month I listened to Ultraviolence for the Women Who Rock rate and the sound is virtually identical. Just an all around great song from an artist who was a bit too ahead of their time.

**pearllouise** (4): The title alone sounds more like the name of a gay porno than a 90s mellow rock song

---

**bbfan132** (10): the atmosphere here is perfect <3 stream dummy

**camerinian** (10): This song is just an effortlessly perfect mood-setter. It's like stepping into a smoke-filled room where the band has just been playing this song on loop for eternity, where the exhaustion and desperation sound like the result of genuinely infinite attempts to get through to someone. The woozy beat and the droning guitar solo are so lethargic but in a really good way, like it drags you into its own state of tiredness. I don't normally listen to much "vibe music" but Portishead will always be an exception to that.

**cremeebrulee** (10): why is this such a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): give me a reason‚Ä¶. To love you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

**RVA\_101** (10): Dummy's Portishead as a whole is a solid 10.

**seanderlust** (9.5): oh wow. haven't heard the rest of the album but this would be a great closer.

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): This is what Lana thought she was doing with her first album

**vapourlomo** (9): Ugh so smooth

**MrSwearword** (8): the sample does the heavy lifting

**wavingwolves** (8): i love the atmosphere of this song but not so much the lyrics i guess

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this song never fully clicked for me

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Loved the instrumental but her vocals are so thin, go girl give us nothing

**Mysario** (6): this song is cool I think

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Boooooring

**u/astrologicalangel** (6): there‚Äôs definitely a reason this was used for AHS

**yourfacesucksass** (6): Alessia who'eth?

**steelstepladder** (7): Before there was WAP... there was OPP. A jolly good song about cheating on people that makes it seem like so much fun! The sample kills, the concept kills, and it's a fun time all around. The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is that its weak against the field for me. But if I'm looking for a fun time, this is where I go to.

**pearllouise** (6): This is what WAP would sound like if it were made in the 90s if you all were curious.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me for the past 10 years - YEAH YOU KNOW ME! Me 5 weeks ago learning that this is a song that is about him fucking other guys‚Äô girlfriends - üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**kappyko** (10): "WE LOVE YOU NATALIE!" "I WANNA FUCK YOU TOO!"

**MrSwearword** (10): YEAH YOU KNOW ME

**ManofOranges** (9): Yeah you know me!

**wavingwolves** (9): that abc sample is just chefs kiss

**bbfan132** (8.5): a fun song, probably will be screwed over though

**vapourlomo** (8.5): Brilliant Jackson 5 flip.

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): The nerve of them to sample a child singing a song called ABC and then make the song about pussy

**jsonphile** (8): a surprisingly good sample of Jackson 5

**RainbowWhale101** (8): That Jackson 5 ABC sample is insaaaneeeeee I really enjoyed it

**RVA\_101** (7.2): I'm actually surprised they didn't go with 'Hip Hop Hooray' for a Naughty by Nature song, but this one is definitely more meaningful. These guys were the real deal. I also peeped that ABC sample in the middle. I see you Michael

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**anothertown** (7): you down with the Dundies..

**dlong5665** (7): yeah you know me

**kirby31200** (7): Cuck anthem, how progressive

**MrMoodle** (7): (#45)

**runaway3212** (7): sure

**skargardin** (7): oh this is a bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.7): these lyrics lol

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): WAP is quivering only a little

**Mysario** (6): I have listened to that song so many times and I still don‚Äôt know what OPP stands for, other people's... something

**rickikardashian** (6): i had to google what opp meant because i didnt get it, anyway, i hate slutshaming

**HermionesBook** (5.8): I really like the jackson 5 sample in this. I kinda dislike when songs have a recurring moaning tho lmao it‚Äôs kinda awkward to listen to

**hunnybee12** (5): the moaning‚Ä¶ why

**rslashpoopheads** (5): There's nothing to this past the ABC sample.

**twat\_brained** (3): I'm disturbed that a song as sweet and innocent as ABC is being used in a vulgar conext such as this, especially knowing what we do about Michael in hindsight, and I don't know what to make of Queen Latifah's presence in the video. Kinda makes me wish we had a U.N.I.T.Y song replacing this one. Or at least, if we include MJ in any capacity, either put Black or White or Scream on this list.

**sandyfishnets** (1.5): not a horrible song... but the hard vocals don't match with the upbeat melody...

**steelstepladder** (3): OH! Another chorus that outshines the rest of the song and for good reason. When he starts rapping on the back half? Ehhhh... I weirdly feel like the baggy scene didn't get  fair shot at things. There are elements in this song that do kinda work but nothing to really make you write home about. I wish this potential could have been expanded on to make something really great but as we have it, I feel like we are just sitting on potential.

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**ReallyCreative** (9): god I love the maximalist production on this one, so much fun

**twat\_brained** (8.9): OH! we need more comedian audio clips sampled in hit music if you ask me. Also, a killer guitar solo at the end helps. Honestly, who'd have ever thought the Madchester sound would make it into a chart like this? Or that the band wasn't even from Manchester? This is why I can appreciate the cultural hodgepodge that was the '90s.

**aestheticen** (8): The guitar bangs in this

**awhile2** (8): im ashamed to say at one point in my life this was like in my top 5 favorite songs of all time

**rslashpoopheads** (8): God this is like an oasis in the desert of bad songs in the bottom quarter of this list.

**vapourlomo** (8): A rare British jock jam! Gotta love that

**anothertown** (7.5): They're Crumbelievable

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i go back and forth on this one because it truly only has one good moment but its a GOOD moment

**Mysario** (7): [obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFjctVBg6K8)

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Boring white boy music but they kinda did somethin w the guitar solo

**wavingwolves** (6.6): it's good but kinda average but good

**yourfacesucksass** (6.4): they're crumbalievable

**steelstepladder** (6): Another case of right artist wrong song. Prince is one of the greatest artists of all time there is no question about that. I love nearly everything he touches but while this song is good, I don't think it ever really approaches true greatness.

**pearllouise** (5): No one: Not a single soul: Prince: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna add an extra t to the end of get.‚Äù

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): i was raised on prince so i have fond memories of being scolded at 8 years old for singing the lyrics to this song in the car...therefore i have to give it my 11

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**runaway3212** (10): Prince really has no bad songs

**wavingwolves** (10): i love the energy of this song

**seanderlust** (9.6): "no, no, dot...FINGERPRINTS."

**RVA\_101** (9.5): What can I say? He's Prince. That's not to say he didn't have duds, but this certainly wasn't one. Very new jack swing. He's really talkin his shit here too lmao. Didn't know he could spit game like that. You wouldn't think he had to.

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Prince in assless chaps>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**ManofOranges** (9): What a weird song... still like it though.

**skargardin** (9): bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): way more fun than i was expecting it to be but it‚Äôs prince so i guess i shouldn‚Äôt be too surprised

**MrMoodle** (8.5): (#27)

**RainbowWhale101** (8): Yo that was kinda sexy

**ReallyCreative** (8): it took a minute for me to get it, but there's some really cool stuff going on in this one

**slimboyfriend** (8): Prince had an interesting 90s

**vapourlomo** (8): Obviously not top-tier Prince, but I'll take what I can get here.

**rickikardashian** (7.7): someone‚Äôs water is boiling

**ignitethephoenix** (7): what not expecting Prince to do a hip hop song but here I am

**jsonphile** (5.5): god I feel truly awful rating a Prince song so low, when the man has so many amazing 10/10 songs, but this...I just can‚Äôt get into it. Extra point for the guitar solo though

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): i wish i didnt understand english

**Mysario** (5): I think Prince can write some incredible and untouchable songs. And then there's this???

**dlong5665** (4): idk about 90's prince

**ggal2020** (4): am I crazy for not liking prince?? because I‚Äôve never heard a prince song and liked it

**steelstepladder** (10): Oof, I was really really really hoping this would end up day three but it just couldn't hold the line enough and got pushed back to day 2 with the last few ballots. One of the most haunting and tormented songs I've ever heard in my life with arguably the best climax in the entire rate. I know people don't love this style of singing now a days but this is arguably the best use of it. The last minute and a half gives me chills every time without fail. God damn I love this song

**pearllouise** (6.5): I wanted to give this song bonus points considering the band has the name Pearl in the title but figured that would be too dumb lol

---

**bbfan132** (10): i remember being freaked out when i first heard some of the lines here, especially since i didn‚Äôt know what the lyrics meant back when i was 8 or 9‚Ä¶ now i understand how dark the song is but it made no sense to me when i was a kid

**dlong5665** (10): the last minute of this song sends chills every time eddie vedder is so good here

**HermionesBook** (10): my favorite pearl jam song. Eddie‚Äôs vocals are so strong

**ManofOranges** (10): Really depressing song... but anyways I like it.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): Whew the storytelling and that last minute of explosion‚Ä¶ RIP Jeremy have my wig

**RainbowWhale101** (10): This was my first time hearing this song and watching the video‚Ä¶ holy shit I am speechless

**runaway3212** (10): this is getting the same score as the album title

**wavingwolves** (10): i remember being afraid of the music video when i was a kid and watching it again as an adult understand the context of it is a weird out of body experience

**aestheticen** (9): The story behind the song caught me off guard h

**camerinian** (9): I didn't like Pearl Jam for a long time because my first album of theirs was No Code and I was missing out on massive, brutal tracks like this. This is what grunge should always have been

**vapourlomo** (9): Not a huge Pearl Jam guy, but Jeremy is a classic angsty 90s banger. Gotta love that Eddie Vedder howl

**seanderlust** (8.3): okay the guitar solo made some points

**RVA\_101** (8.2): Iconic bass intro/riff. One of the most iconic representations of grunge, easily Pearl Jam's most famous song. Listening with good headphones I can hear the details like the layers of electric guitars in the verses and the acoustic in the chorus. I appreciate the production a lot more than I used to as a result. I've never been a fan of this song but I still like it. I can imagine emo teenagers everywhere jamming out hard to this.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The background for this song is dark was not expecting that (although the song hints a lot)

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Jeremy Spokane, Spokane

**slimboyfriend** (7.3): Every impression of the lead singer of this band sounded like an exaggeration, but that's really how he sounds, isn't it?

**twat\_brained** (7.3): this is an‚Ä¶ anti-bullying song? I guess? It's hard to tell because Eddie Vedder's enunciation makes Ariana Grande sound like Lisa Loeb by comparison. It disservices this song and the video when the lyrics are unintelligible.

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**awhile2** (7): like REM they had much better songs

**kirby31200** (7): It's definitely a great song but I've just never been a fan of Eddie Vedder's voice.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Pearl Jamnators make some noise!!!

**yourfacesucksass** (7): hmmm honestly not a big pearl jam listener, but man is the inspiration behind this song dark.

**stryxen** (6.4): this isn‚Äôt R.E.M !?!?

**MrMoodle** (6.2): (#63) has this offputting sense of self importance but the last minute and a half is really good

**kappyko** (6): ehhhhhhhhhhhhh im being kind to this because the guitar tones in the intro and outro are amazing

**MrSwearword** (6): only because the story behind it is better than the song

**Roxieloxie** (6): your telling me a pearl made this jam

**Mysario** (5): not even the best off of Ten

**skargardin** (5): I can feel that the dad rockers aren't gonna fare too well in this rate. Pearl Jam is one of those bands that dad would play in his car from time to time and they never did anything for me. It's not a bad song or anything it just isn't in my tastes at all.

**waluigiest** (5): I really can‚Äôt with this band lol

**ggal2020** (4): this type of singing was the bananas and avocados of the 90s

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): well as you so kindly asked...

**RVA\_101** (7.3): Holy fuck this song has so many connections in terms of samples I recognize; the 'shrieking' type sound apparently was reused by the same producer for Cypress Hill's 'Insane in the Brain' and that trumpet intro near the beginning before the beat comes in was used as for Busta Rhymes' 'Calm Down'. And I prefer both of those songs to this one lol, this one is just not all that hype to me.

**J\_Toe** (7): oh wow, it's one of those songs where I've always heard part of it, but never heard the song in full or known it's name/artist

**pearllouise** (8.5): Ah yes, the song that dominated the playlist of every pre-night out, spin cycling class, and middle school gym class. Gonna Make You Sweat is a beast mode anthem. Whether you want that great summer body or just simply wanna get fit while singing ‚ÄúEverybody dance now‚Äù, there is no denying how C & C Music Factory was able to get everyone off the couch and to help the employees of every gym across the country put bread on the table.

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): "And I'm just a squirrel/Trying to get a nut"? Excuse me??

**jsonphile** (7): great groove but the rapping is a bit dated

**rslashpoopheads** (7): A cultural reset.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.8): sorry Martha Wash

**kappyko** (6): pump up the jam is a better contemporary

**wavingwolves** (6): this makes me think of many different movies but it's still not a great song by itself

**yourfacesucksass** (6): it's a classssssic but i sort of despise it lmao

**aestheticen** (5): Madagascar is a great movie

**ManofOranges** (5): I'm sweating from exhaustion.

**RVA\_101** (5): I don't want to look like a hater. I respect it as a dance anthem. It's a 10 in the club. But I'm not in the club, I'm in my room at 2AM with the light of my laptop illuminating my loneliness. It just drags along in any other setting (except maybe running laps during middle school gym). But major points to the iconic scatting throughout the second half, I love that shit.

**TiltControls** (4.5): - flashbacks to elementary school

**dlong5665** (4): marsha carries this song on her back and they don't give her the props she deserves ugh fuck em

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): this is the song i tried out for dance team with and i didn't make it

**DaniG08765** (3): didn't know that was the title

**brenda\_official** (1): that sample is so grating i hate it

**MrMoodle** (0): (#100) when i was a kid, my lesbian mums would drag me along to their middle-aged lesbian friend's birthdays and this would come on and they'd all try to make me dance and have fun. i hated it so much. i wasn't insecure about people seeing me dance, i just didn't like dancing, i didn't want to be there, and this song was the soundtrack to my misery.

**pearllouise** (8.5): Music fans never really expected an alternative rock song to tell a lyrical story. Sterotypically, rock music is just dismissed as ‚Äúsome young white guys playing instruments and words come out of your mouth‚Äù. With The Way, you sort of forgot about that cliche and you can really concentrate on the lyrics of the song while also grooving to the music as well.

---

**camerinian** (10): I'd never even heard this song before this rate but holy shit this is incredible. I've had this on repeat for this whole submission period. How the song resolves from the verse to the chorus is the shit dreams are made of, and the narrative is compelling and totally empathetic even in spite of the protagonists ending up dead. This is great and I wish it was in my life earlier

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another hit

**Mysario** (10): I think this is one of my favourite songs on this list, it's usually forgotten on a bunch of 90's list (barely even making this one) and is overshadowed by the weird cover that Ari and Mac did but to me, this has always been paved in gold!

**runaway3212** (10): A really solid track

**seanderlust** (10): this song is honestly really nostalgic for me. I loved it as a kid without really understanding it.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): out of my head >> but this one doesnt remind me of fadmila

**1998tweety** (9): bops a bit

**dlong5665** (9): just a fun song with a pretty sad story behind it

**ReallyCreative** (9): I totally forgot this song existed omg a BANGER

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): The Way (get it) I used to sing this song as a kid

**aestheticen** (8.5): Wasn't expecting such a deep backstory to this

**MrMoodle** (8.5): (#26)

**ImADudeDuh** (8): bop

**RainbowWhale101** (8): Fun song, this was my first time hearing it and I enjoyed it

**RVA\_101** (8): I really like the moody chord progression, even if it's a relatively formulaic progression.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): kinda groovy actually

**CritneySpearz** (7): I might be high, but parts of this remind of The Tango Maureen from Rent lmao

**MrSwearword** (7): the hook outdoes the entire song but I mean it's pretty cute

**wavingwolves** (7): this is such a good song to listen to while driving

**bbfan132** (6): i‚Äôm bored, let me listen to the way by ariana grande ft. mac miller now

**Roxieloxie** (6): ari outsold

**anothertown** (5): creepy....

**twat\_brained** (4.2): I know I've said it many times before but HOW IS THIS ONE OF THE BEST YOU COULD COME UP WITH? HOW IS THIS REMOTELY IN THE LIST OF THE TOP 100 SONGS OF THE 1990S? Couldn't you fit "The Sign" or "I'll Make Love To You" in this list?!

**kappyko** (4): i dont get it

**rslashpoopheads** (4): God this melody has only been done 10000 times before..

**sadshrub** (4): Why is the music video Scarface themed?

**TiltControls** (3): out of my head deserved

pig-serpent: There are a lot of fairly tolerable adult contemporary songs (Mr. Jones, Two Princes, Shine) that got booted far before Iris, which is probably my least favorite of the bunch (or at least close to it).  It's just so bland and the singing is bad, I don't get it.

pig-serpent: Yeah maybe Pearl Jam wasn't the best example because I suppose there are some people who enjoy post-grunge over grunge for some reason and compared it with some of the adult contemporary that has a lot more going on in the song, like Two Princes.  That song is groovy as hell and deserved better.
