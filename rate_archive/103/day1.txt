ReallyCreative: I gave Enter Sandman a 10 because I went to Virginia Tech and like football and our entrance is like the greatest thing ever

it's also a banger but like, it's elevated

McIgglyTuffMuffin: I finally got to see Metallica live in 2017, 14 years after first becoming a fan, them playing Enter Sandman was truly one of the best moments of my life. The energy from the band and the stadium was beyond electric. 

It is a banger, but elevated.

but also so true about song use, I dislike Ozzy's Crazy Train just because the New England Patriots use it for their entrance music.

**steelstepladder** (1): What else could it be.

**pearllouise** (0): As soon as I saw this song at the bottom of the list I couldn’t help but think “How bad can this song be?” Girl, it’s bad. This sounds like one of those songs made by some main character on a sitcom that was a huge pop star in the 90s then had a mid-life crisis several years later.

---
#Suuuuaaaaveee
**seanderlust** (7.5): okay at least he's honest that he's a shitty boyfriend lmao

**MrSwearword** (7): trashy is fine but this just isn't all that wonderful

**Roxieloxie** (6.9): ,,,, were the 90s just ~like this~
#Sounds about white

**ManofOranges** (6): This just isn't good... but it's kind of addictive.

**RainbowWhale101** (6): The Despacito of the 90s… Cringey lyrics but you cant help but tap your feet

**plastichaxan** (5.6): the lyrics really make me not enjoy this as much as i’d like to

**slimboyfriend** (5.4): was this song supposed to be sexy?

**vapourlomo** (5): On the verge of so-bad-it's-good...but not quite there.

**anothertown** (4): I eat em raw like sushi

**ReallyCreative** (4): aggressively mediocre

**u/astrologicalangel** (4): this is a drag king performance waiting to happen

**yourfacesucksass** (4): what....is...this...

**dlong5665** (3): god this and too sexy lost their novelty in like 2003

**ignitethephoenix** (3): let’s talk about the fact we have rated this song twice and it’s still not great both times

**TragicKingdom1** (3): honestly there's some interesting production elements here but the guy being [NOT LATINO] is quite a revelation.........

**MrMoodle** (2.5): (#93) RRRRRRRICO

**rickikardashian** (2.5): not only does this suck, buti had to do the extra step of searching it on youtube because it isnt on spotify

**camerinian** (1): We can't get a rate that includes Pop 2 but somehow we've managed to now do Rico Suave twice, the fuk

**chillbumps5** (1): we meet again

**nootnoot781** (1): mierda

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Rico Nasty

**twat\_brained** (1): Spanish Vanilla Ice. In this case… Pimiento Fuego? I don’t know, I just wish Lovefool was here instead.

**wavingwolves** (1): this being on this list at all is a choice i can't understand

**1998tweety** (0): no

**bbfan132** (0): uh… this is weird… i feel uncomfortable

**hikkaru** (0): it was my zero in one hit wonderland rate and it's my zero here

**hunnybee12** (0): I cant make it past 30 seconds please god make it stop

**ImADudeDuh** (0): NOT THIS RACIST SONG AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! MEXICO SWEETIE IM SO SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**jsonphile** (0): how is it that out of all the songs of the 90’s, people decided that this song should be on this list for humankind to remember? Seriously? Even #100 is way too high for this. I’m genuinely baffled by the inclusion. How?? Why??? Why Gerardo but no Boyz II Men, Foo Fighters, No Doubt, Rage Against the Machine, Nas, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, or either Michael or Janet Jackson?? Or if they wanted to include Latin American artists, besides the Ricky Martin song they included, why not Jennifer Lopez?? Enrique Iglesias?? Marc Anthony?? I’m not a huge fan of any of them but they’re way better than this garbage

**kirby31200** (0): Embarrassing. This made it in over Aerosmith, The Cure, No Doubt, Sublime, Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots, Garbage, Bush, Hole, Chumbawumba, Michael and Janet Jackson, Natalie Imbruglia, Bjork, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Ace of Bass, 98 Degrees, The Divinyls, The Cardigans, New Kids on the Block, The Offspring ...

**Mysario** (0): this is one of the worst songs to survive the 90's and having this as the final song to rate feels like a slap in the face. I have listened to songs for over 7 hours and it ends on this disaster. I'm so burnt out at this point so all I can do is hope you choke, Ric0

**sadshrub** (0): The biggest embarrassment to Latin-American culture in musical history and he isn’t even hispanic

**skargardin** (0): bye

**splusten** (0): Rico barely made it under the wire with my 0, man I gotta say he's clutch when you need him.

**TiltControls** (0): i though after the OHW rate i'd never have to listen to this again...

**waluigiest** (0): I also rated this poorly in the one hit wonder rate. It sucks I hate it.

#Goes crazy when they see a cymbal or a highhat
**pearllouise** (2): I cringe so hard whenever I listen to this song. What did ice ever have to do to deserve this? Next!

**steelstepladder** (1): No surprise to the placement here. Maybe the memes and icon status of this song might have led you to believe it's actually good but it's not. It's actually way worse when you're sitting down and actually listening to it. 99 is a deserving place as far as I'm concerned.

**MrSwearword** (10): I don't give a gift wrapped fuck about the Under Pressure sample, this song is the last bit of cornball fuckery the public got for a long while

**runaway3212** (10): This song is so fucking good I wish more people sampled Queen tbh

**selegend** (8): it’s a bop

**ggal2020** (7.5): I thought under pressure ripped this song off until I was like 15 and I learned what sampling is

**conceptualromance** (7): Under Pressure outsold

**J\_Toe** (7): Madonna and I are completely separate acts 👏 Redecutive 👏 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLo4Z_LWu4

**ReallyCreative** (7): another really annoying but totally iconic novelty song, the 90s really lacked substance sometimes and we just ate it tf up

**rickikardashian** (7): is taking everything in me to not give this an ironic 11

**vapourlomo** (7): A perfect "so bad it's good" jam. Ice is an awful rapper...but this still works? Maybe it's that Queen sample.

#One white rapper down, a bunch to go

**ManofOranges** (6): OMG I can't believe Vanilla Ice came up with that bassline all by himself. He's such a great musician

**u/astrologicalangel** (6): I can’t in good conscience give this a good score, but I also enjoyed it more than some other songs on this list

**seanderlust** (5.7): "feasible rhymes" is sending me. just real plausible. believable, realistic rhymes.

**HermionesBook** (5): this song is such a guilty pleasure honestly

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Freddie Mercury and David Bowie sweetie...

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this will do bad but whatever, i do bop to it a bit (only a bit though)

**twat\_brained** (5): the song itself isn’t bad. Well, the beat isn’t anyway. The world doesn’t need more Vanilla Ice, however. Hell, the world didn’t need Vanilla Ice in the first place.

**RVA\_101** (4.7): I've never understood why this was such a hit and people liked it so much. It's just so vanilla (heh). His flow is nice, but he's not really saying anything, and the production never really does anything exceptional beyond the low synth during the verse, it relies too much on the Under Pressure sample. Speaking of Under Pressure, I'm gonna go listen to that now instead.

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): Iconic, but for all the wrong reasons

**anothertown** (3): Literally beyond the novelty of this song, the beat and the synths are actually good, but like fuck you Robert Van Winkle

**kirby31200** (3): Haha you guys are hilarious now what's the actual song in this spot, you can't seriously be telling me that VH1 said Ice Ice Baby was one of the best hip hop hits of the whole decade right? Right?

**Mysario** (3): this is why artists don't re-record their songs

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Boring as hell.

**slimboyfriend** (3): this sounds like somebody wanted to make the exact opposite of what white people think rap is

**sadshrub** (2): White Boy White Boy! Don’t say that!

**sandyfishnets** (2): all points go to Queen/Bowie

**skargardin** (2): bye

**bbfan132** (1): this song is trash but i still know all of the words, help

**camerinian** (1): I feel like Vanilla Ice is into QAnon now. I can't prove that, but I don't see anyone disproving it either so

**ImADudeDuh** (1): https://media1.tenor.com/images/bb2d19bb95ddf15c6dd5308a0905ec2f/tenor.gif

**jsonphile** (1): Vanilla Ice is so white and corny he makes Ed Sheeran look like Kendrick Lamar. The song gets an extra point for at least sampling a great 10/10 song, but then loses that point for trying to deny that it was sampled because of the extra “ding”

**MrMoodle** (1): (#98) oh my fucking god i'm doing this rate on the due date and i'm anxious to move on but this song just takes an eternity it's so fucking boring what the fuck

**Roxieloxie** (1): So I didnt hear this or under pressure until like sometime after 2015 but I heard Under Preasure first so when i heard this i wsa very ???? also I assumed he sampled it but reading about this on wiki he just straight up jacked it im-

**splusten** (1): I only have but one 0 to give. This is my burden in life, but I want to express how much everyone, memes aside, should loathe this song.

**TiltControls** (1): wait this isn't under pressure ☹

**waluigiest** (1): ive gotta be honest. I hate it.

**wavingwolves** (1): this is already bad enough by itself but that one glee cover is one of the worst things to happen to humanity

**dlong5665** (0): no

**pearllouise** (3): Welcome to the wonderful world of sexual objectification

**steelstepladder** (1): At least we got the Justin Timberlake and Lonely Island skits from this? Color Me Bad is a very specific brand of R&B from when the 90's still thought it was the 80's and it shows. Just not good all around in a very non descriptive way.

---
#Lonely Island and Justin Timberlake kinda served here
**MoonlightByWindow** (10): bop bop bop

**runaway3212** (9): I really love the beat in this

**ImADudeDuh** (8): color me badd but this song is alright

**kirby31200** (8): Do people even make lovemaking jams anymore?

**ManofOranges** (8): I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this one, but I think I like it.

**MrMoodle** (8): (#30)

**waluigiest** (8): exceeded expectations!

**stryxen** (7.8): repetitive in both an annoying and good way

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): okay so maybe i'm the only reason color me badd is still getting streaming numbers, but boy did this band take a hard u-turn. aside from that, ugh this sound is so nostalgic and i just, that's all i can say.

**1998tweety** (7.5): so vulgar

**rickikardashian** (7.5): why do u need to disconect the phone to fuck? are you scared the goverment is spying on your sex?

**slimboyfriend** (6.7): Each Michael Jackson impression gets worse the longer this song goes on
#Tick tock please stop
**succulentils** (6): “Makin’ love until we drown.” Maybe this inspired the Showgirls sex scene

**RVA\_101** (5.9): Can't tell if the lead singer is trying to do his best MJ with the falsetto but ehh. I like the chill production and the background vocals tho.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): just unlocked a memory of will schuester singing this on glee and I’m uncomfortable

**jsonphile** (5): I feel very unsexy listening to this song

**Mysario** (5): this might be the only song in the rate I don't recall and I kinda see why. But also how could I forget a chorus that goes "I wanna rub you down, I wanna sex you up"

**seanderlust** (4.6): I feel like this song suffers from "seinfeld isn't funny" syndrome. like, this song for sure had a tangible effect on R&B music moving forward, and now it just doesn't feel as fresh listening from 2020.

**bbfan132** (4): this song makes me uncomfortable but i guess it sounds ok?

**camerinian** (4): You'd think a song with this title would be either more raunchy or more sultry, but it's neither and it's really uncanny, like the guy is just hearing about sex for the first time and being forced into writing a song about it

**Roxieloxie** (4): the slick rick sample going through the entire song is throwing me off

**skargardin** (4): yikes

**wavingwolves** (4): i like the looping sample, the beat and the harmonies but that's about it

**CritneySpearz** (3.5): ruined by Glee forever

**vapourlomo** (3): YIKES this has aged badly. I bet this is what killed new jack swing for good

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): they really tried to shove a bunch of influences and genres together, it's a shame none of them were a good song

**hunnybee12** (2): absolutely! not!

**rslashpoopheads** (2): NO!

**twat\_brained** (2): The Vengaboys' "Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom" was released in late 1998. Why is that not on this list yet this is? I hate VH1

**awhile2** (1): ive never heard this song before. it seems like it should be a parody of an actual good song

**MrSwearword** (1): I can like trashy, I can like corny, but if you fuck up on both ends like Color Me Badd did, you can go right to hell

**splusten** (1): Is this the kind of shit women have to deal with? Because damn.

**steelstepladder** (3): I Alone is probably the biggest example of a song that suffered not necessarily because everyone hated it but because no one liked it. On top of that at this point grunge is becoming post grunge, and you can't be surprised with the bottom 5 placement.

**pearllouise** (2): Playing this song after listening to Shine can make you do a double-take

---
#I alone love this
**runaway3212** (10): I’m running out of ways to say ‘this song is really great and in any other rate it would’ve been a contestant for my 11’

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**vapourlomo** (7): This is probably when grunge started getting a bit silly — in fact, this tune has big Christian rock vibes. But I'm still a sucker for that screamy chorus...

#Alone again, naturally

**bbfan132** (6.5): it sounded decent but there wasn’t much else to it

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): Live came off like a major label triangulating the exact midpoint of Pearl Jam, Nirvana and R.E.M. Of their three big hits, this one is the weakest.

**seanderlust** (6.3): is this supposed to be romantic? it seems...kind of abusive lol

**cremeebrulee** (6): oh lmao this was not where i was expecting it to go

**dlong5665** (6): its ok

**MrSwearword** (6): weak against the field but decent for what it is

**RVA\_101** (6): Another example of that classic 'quiet verse/loud chorus' musical trope, but eh this song is just uninteresting to me.

**skargardin** (6): next

**wavingwolves** (6): some parts of it are interesting but the song itself isn't that strong

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i listened to this like 3 times and i still can’t tell you how it goes

**ManofOranges** (5): Bitch me too the fuck

**MrMoodle** (4.5): (#81)

**splusten** (4.3): Yeah, we know.

**camerinian** (4): This is maybe the most 90s song here, like, to a fault

**ReallyCreative** (3): wow one of the least pleasant choruses to listen to of all music

**waluigiest** (3): I was feeling this but then it turned into NOISE

**hunnybee12** (2): …gross

**rslashpoopheads** (1): ew

**twat\_brained** (1): I didn’t know this band existed and if this is their biggest song I’d be happy to never know of their existence again.

**steelstepladder** (5): I get why this one didn't do well I really do but I know every word. It's fun! At least to me it is. But even I can't deny it is outmatched by the serious hip hop in this rate. There's gonna be enough robberies in this rate going forward that I'm not going to die on the hill of The Humpty Dance being screwed out of a higher spot. At least we got Tupac out of it.

**pearllouise** (4): I guess Humpty sounds funny-looking too. It’s like listening to a very stoned Goofy.

---
#He compared his nose to a pickle, funniest shit I've ever seen
**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is absolutely stupid but my parents played this song when i was too young to hear it so i’ll be content with being the only 10 for it

**MrSwearword** (10): the greatest troll rap song of the 90s

**bbfan132** (8.5): kind of a bop ngl, silly as hell but i was dancing the whole time

**awhile2** (8): i remember feeling really uncomfortable when this song played when i was a little kid because i thought a dance called the humpty hump was wildly explicit

**ManofOranges** (8): I have no idea what's going on but I'm having fun!

**vapourlomo** (8): This probably didn't need to be six and a half minutes long...but it's still funny as hell. Probably the greatest thing to ever be associated with Burger King.

#At least take me to Wendys sheesh

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): well

**engifear** (6.4): Why is this song so long

**RVA\_101** (6.2): When a hip hop beat is repetitive and has no melody (the sample does not really count) other than a bass line, you should at least be spitting as hard as Meg does on Cash Shit so it's memorable. The hook is amusing though, and the MC mimicking the bass groove in the bridge is also super amusing too. I dig Digital Underground but their biggest hit was never all that to me.

**1998tweety** (6): no thanks

**anothertown** (6): So THIS is what “I drink up all the Hennessy on your shelf, so just let me introduce myself” is from

**kappyko** (6): bass good

**ReallyCreative** (6): it has some novelty but it's uhh not good lmao

**skargardin** (6): entertaining mess

**seanderlust** (5.9): .....did everyone hear the beat? I thought the beat was lovely.

**kirby31200** (4): The more he says he gets ladies despite being ugly, the less I believe it

**twat\_brained** (4): not even Tupac can save this trainwreck. I wouldn't be surprised if this inspired the BoJack dance storyline in BoJack Horseman. Or if that's parodying the Humpty Dance. I don't really care either way.

**wavingwolves** (4): why is this almost a 7 min song when there's no need to be

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): this guy has lots of confidence...also why is this 6 minutes long?!

**cremeebrulee** (3): this is 6 MINUTES LONG????

**dlong5665** (3): bad rap ages worse than most

**GlialUreterostenosis** (3): white dad making fun of rap flow

**J\_Toe** (3): honestly wish we got to rank this list from 100-1, as I can kinda see why these later songs aren't number 1 :/

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): knocked off 4 points for these lyrics :/

**Mysario** (3): it's fun but I decided to sit here and listen to the full thing for once and just... why

**runaway3212** (3): Not interesting

**camerinian** (2.5): what but also lmao but also ew but also get away from me

**MrMoodle** (2.5): (#95) why is this so long

**sadshrub** (2.5): Funny but dumb

**chillbumps5** (2): this rate was a chore to get through because of songs i've never hear of before like this one

**rickikardashian** (2): this sounds like ice ice baby but not so bad it’s good

**TiltControls** (2): does it really need to be 6 and a half minutes???

**RandomHypnotica** (0): what the fuck is this absolute trainwreck

**pearllouise** (5.5): Sweet Niblets

**steelstepladder** (1): I mean... yeah. This was never not going to be day 1 bound. Despite his success with Old Town Road, going back to the song that made him big gives you whiplash in how doofy and annoying it is and not even in a Hootie and the Blowfish kind of way. This was always going to be a lock for day one and I can't complain it's going out here.

#Take my horse to the achy heart

**ImADudeDuh** (10): KINGIE AND A BOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): Cheesy but I love cheese

**MrSwearword** (10): I debated whether or not I should give it high marks for being hokey shit that lasted in public consciousness or nuke it to spite Lil Meme Sux fans. Fuck it, I grew up with this song, so high marks it is.

**Mysario** (10): it became the first single ever to achieve triple Platinum status in Australia

**aestheticen** (9): I unironically like this song

**Roxieloxie** (9): I cant believe Lil Nas X gave this indie act a career

**rslashpoopheads** (9): I'm glad Billy finally got his #1 because this song is a jam...not everyone has that, you know.

**waluigiest** (9): not gonna lie I really fuck with this

**ignitethephoenix** (8): corny but iconic

**camerinian** (7.5): my mind walked out on me years ago Billy welcome to the club

**dlong5665** (7): its so corny but honestly a fucking banger too

**J\_Toe** (7): A lot of people thought Billy Rae Cyrus was featuring in newcomer Lil Nas X's song as a courtesy, when in reality Old Town Road was a greater success than anything Billy achieved in his career. We saw him in Hannah Montana and assumed he was a bigger pop culture figure than he truly was.

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Not the type of music I'd usuallu listen to but Billy Ray kinda did somethin here! I enjoyed it, would listen again.

**rickikardashian** (7): i want my mullet back deserved

**runaway3212** (7): This song is not good, this seven does not change that. I just can’t rate it lower.

**RVA\_101** (7): The reactions from the Miley stans are going to be the most amusing for this one.

**MrMoodle** (5): (#75) apparently this was no. 2 on blender's worst songs ever list. nah. also i just learnt that billy ray cyrus was kind of hot in the 90s and i hate it.

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): did anybody else have to learn this line dance for P.E. in middle school? just me?

**vapourlomo** (4): Listen folks — I grew up on Hannah Montana, too. That verse on Old Town Road is legendary. But let's not pretend goddamn "Achy Breaky Heart" is actually good.

**anothertown** (3): Clownery.. undeniable hook though

**nootnoot781** (3): do i hate fun? well if it sounds like this, then yes i do

**kirby31200** (2): Was this really better than the dozens of country hits that could be here instead

**splusten** (2): You get a single pass because of Old Town Road, old man.

**TiltControls** (2): at least he got his redemption with OTR

**bbfan132** (1): this is terrible, please go out on day 1

**jsonphile** (1): no shut up shut up shut up I hate this song it’s so mind numbingly repetitive and annoying and stupid and how the hell did this man end up on a song breaking the record for longest running number one hit, almost thirty years after he had this one hit song? And his verse was actually really good??? Man 2019 was weird y’all

**RandomHypnotica** (1): nononononononononononononononononononononononononononono

**yourfacesucksass** (8.9): Ugh his voice is so smooth, and this is the loviest doviest song but still. A great track.

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): a staple of 90’s/early 2000’s culture

**seanderlust** (7.4): this one really surprised me! I hadn't heard it before and the music was pretty standard 90s rock ballad, but the lyrics impressed me

**CritneySpearz** (7): it’s corny str8 ppl music but I still kinda like it

**DaniG08765** (7): definitely didn't know who sang this haha

**kirby31200** (7): My brain says the song sucks. It says that it's cheesy and sappy and insincere. But my heart swoons.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Which WB show did this song feature on to become a hit. also, peep the sax that only appears in the last 5 seconds of the song

#We don't need another white Ed with an accoustic guitar

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): a lot of tedious minivan rock in this rate

**wavingwolves** (6): thinking about the ball scene on a cinderella story

**Mysario** (5): I'll be better when I'm older, I'll be the greatest fan of your life 😔

**skargardin** (5): this sure is a song in the rate

**twat\_brained** (5): This guy reminds me of myself. I'm not pleased about that. I am pleased that Edwin sounds like he's trying, even if it's for naught because he sounds in pain.

**bbfan132** (4): how was this popular? it’s the most basic pop rock ballad ever

**dlong5665** (4): ed mcain was truly what every '00 christian white boy act wanted to be

**MrSwearword** (4): the less said about this the better

**MrMoodle** (3.5): (#86) i'm so glad i didn't grow up in the 90s because if i hear even one more song like this i'm gonna lose my mind

**jsonphile** (3): man it’s been years since I’d heard this song. It’s even worse than I remember. I’m okay with lots of the adult alternative on this list but this is just way too sappy

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): we get it you’re sad

**sandyfishnets** (3): sad cowboy emoji

**vapourlomo** (2): Ughhhh. This song is the worst kind of corny: boring.

**anothertown** (1): I cannot describe how much I hate this and have hated this for most of my life

**camerinian** (1): here is a list of songs from the 90s that did not make this list while this snoozefest ballad shit by Fuckface Nobody did: Bittersweet Symphony, Killing In The Name, Celebrity Skin, Teardrop, Torn, Rhythm of the Night, What's Up, Around The World, Closer, Don't Speak, Smooth, anything by Smashing Pumpkins, Outkast, The Offspring, Fatboy Slim, A Tribe Called Quest, Daft Punk. None of those are good enough for VH1, but let's hear it for yet another random dude making some heterosexual wedding dance bait

**steelstepladder** (9.5): One of the real struggles of this rate was coming to terms with the fact that I really liked Freak on a Leash by Korn. It's good I don't care I don't care. Everything works in this song despite how it really shouldn't. Even the beatboxing I think adds something as it gives a lot of momentum for that final chorus. Nu metal was kind of born here and there's a reason why it was the biggest sub genre of rock music of the 00's. Can't say I expected better but I will die on the hill that this is a great song.

**pearllouise** (5): When he said “mnommnomninomna” I felt that

---
#Works at Hot Topic
**dlong5665** (10): nu metal really peaked here but its so good omg

**Mysario** (10): the first episode I saw of "OK KO! Let's Be Heroes" was the [episode where Jonathan Davis the lead singer of Korn voiced the cactus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlyhHCwgLK4) and I knew from there that was a great show. Anyways this rate was a mistake

**seanderlust** (9.2): holy shit this actually slapped

**conceptualromance** (9): this guy is just saying gibberish at one point

**wavingwolves** (9): ten songs ago i was like "no korn song?" but here it is! and it's a fine song

**camerinian** (8): I didn’t even like this song growing up, but now it fully shortcuts to “i’m 12 and this is cool as fr*ck mode” for me. The video is a straight 10 tho

**MrSwearword** (8): I'm sure it's a classic to others but it's fine

**vapourlomo** (8): Nu-metal single-handedly destroyed mainstream rock in the 00s. But, if I'm being honest, Freak on a Leash goes hard in the paint. I just wish it wasn't so influential.

**MrMoodle** (7.4): (#42) this was the inspiration for roman holiday right

**1998tweety** (7): good but it scares me at some points

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this was decent until we got to the weird scat part. The chorus is strong but the rest of the song is not really my thing

**kappyko** (7): this is cool lol

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): so true king

**plastichaxan** (6.8): my rating kept going down as this kept going

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): okay so i only know of this band/nu metal cause the lead dude was on an episode of okko and its like a mini plot point. I dont really get it but go girl! give us something!

#Annoyed grunt

**ManofOranges** (6): This song is too freaky deaky for me!

**runaway3212** (6): meh

**twat\_brained** (6): I think this song’s only main appeal is its video. The song's unmemorable apart from the scat bit.

**bbfan132** (5.5): it’s not bad but i wouldn’t choose to listen to it again lol

**anothertown** (5): da bmm dadammm damdahema

**kirby31200** (5): 13 year old me is shocked at the revelation that maybe Korn aren't that great

**RVA\_101** (5): The most amusing part is definitely the proto-beatboxing breakdown. Although I don't know if you can exactly call it beatboxing, it's like if a pitbull tried to beatbox.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): no thanks

**rslashpoopheads** (4): This is like bad Linkin Park.

**moonagenightmares** (3): it wasn’t too unbearable until he started to uh... beatbox

**ReallyCreative** (3): please do not make me listen to Korn again

**skargardin** (3): throwback to when my classmates in middle school tried to convert me into liking Korn, ugh

**RainbowWhale101** (2): I liked it until he started singing keyboard smashes… wtf was that all about it totally ruined the song

**waluigiest** (2): hmmmmmmmm

**HermionesBook** (1): honestly hate Korn and this song lmao his voice is just so unpleasant to listen to

**agentofscranton** (0): no thank you

**steelstepladder** (1): It got bottom 10 yay! Call me stupid but I never got the hype for this song or the question she brings up. Like if God was one of us... so what? This song doesn't feel wise it just feels meandering and preachy and I strongly dislike it.

---
#Jesus is the one
**conceptualromance** (10): ok this is kind of a serve

**MrSwearword** (10): the fact that this is probably hella sarcastic in lyrical context but sweetly delivered like it's serious adds to this weirdly controversial song and its glory

**runaway3212** (10): “My father would never take the bus”

**aestheticen** (9.5): Interesting lyrics

**agentofscranton** (9.5): they really did a whole glee episode about a grilled cheese with jesus on it huh

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): makes me think of austin powers tbh

**yourfacesucksass** (9): I loooove this. Feel bad that she got so much hate from religious groups and extremists. Honestly, I guess it was inevitable, but still.

**1998tweety** (8): i dont care for the lyrics but the rest is good

**dlong5665** (8): ms osbourne really shook the christheads with this

**ggal2020** (7.5): I thought this was just some christian rock song, but I looked it up and joan osborne is actually really cool, she toured with the lillith fair and worked a lot with planned parenthood and rock the vote.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): what was with this intro um. Song is okay otherwise if you don’t mind Christian stuff

**splusten** (7.5): Lotta religion on this list huh?

**bbfan132** (7): the lyrics are kind of lame at points or r/iam14andthisisdeep material but sonically, it’s good

**wavingwolves** (7): what if god was a crj fan who passed their time arguing on the internet about what pure pop even means

**MrMoodle** (6.9): (#47) i usually hate religious music but i dunno this just works
#If God was one of us that would explain a lot
**RVA\_101** (6.3): It's just kind of one of the blander songs to me, I still respect her though. I'm sure she's a fine songwriter. Looking her up on Wikipedia it looks like this is a similar case to Collective Soul's 'Shine', a pseudo-Christian rock song by a non Christian rock artist, I wonder if she had to deal with questions about that too, like if she was a Christian genre artist (she's not).

**kirby31200** (6): If God is one of us, that means he can be killed. I'm coming for you, fucker.

**skargardin** (6): I remember this song but never knew the title or the artist so this is a moment. the "just a stranger on the bus" line really takes me out

**twat\_brained** (6): decent message, but it’s just mixed so awfully on earphones that it’s hard for me to be objective towards it

**seanderlust** (5.1): anyone in this thread smoke weed?

**J\_Toe** (5): no offence but I never want to hear the intro to this song ever again

**ManofOranges** (5): ABBA outsold

**rickikardashian** (5): im just confused as to what point it’s trying to make

**waluigiest** (5): I’m going back and forth about this one

**camerinian** (4): OH IT'S THIS SONG. Ok cool now I don't need to get Shazam out when I change the radio station

**hunnybee12** (4): the childhood memories from vacation bible school this dug up...

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Boring.

**sadshrub** (4): Overrated

**slimboyfriend** (3.9): what a dumb premise for a song

**HermionesBook** (3.5): forgot this song existed but I used to be obsessed with it as a kid but it didn’t really age well imo. Pretty corny lol

**cremeebrulee** (3): im not a christian so most religious songs are a miss for me lol but i will say, her voice sounds really great here

**ReallyCreative** (2): this kind of uninspired Christian folk rock should be illegal, it's so bad.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): if god were one of us, he’d be a barb. Im not allowing questions at this time.

**kappyko** (1): jesus

**TragicKingdom1** (1): a true slog, hope it doesn't coast to day 2 by not being a white male rock song

**steelstepladder** (10): Well the bonus rate needed SOMETHING so that all time classics weren't going out day one and this was it. This was the correct choice and I'm not taking any questions at this time. This is a pure 10/10 that outcharted everything on Emotion. We don't have time for flops only the biggest stars for the 90's rate.

**kirby31200** (3): I have the sneaking suspicion I'm not the target audience for this

**bbfan132** (2): this was painful to listen to and i like alt metal… giving it a 2 solely because the instrumental was decent

**camerinian** (2): how do I sue to get six minutes of my life back

**MelodramaticLemonade** (2): The premise is fun but that punchline is not worth the 5 minutes of… that

**MrSwearword** (2): for the amount of generous points I give the claymation music video

**ReallyCreative** (2): wow y'all really just be shoving anything into these rates. you really burned a spot for this instead of Drive by Incubus. homophobic tbh

---
#To sexy for r/popheads
**ggal2020** (10): when I was like 6 I would dress up in my mom’s heels and a feather boa, turn my living room into a runway, and do shows to this song. looking back it might have been just a little inappropriate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): CAMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): it's gay camp turned up to a fucking billion

**vapourlomo** (10): If you don't know every word of this, then are you even a Millennial?

**succulentils** (9.5): Ooo, the singer is bi! Icon.

**twat\_brained** (9.5): I noticed this song score a 5.675 in the One Hit Wonderland rate. I think that was too harsh. I can't say I love this song, but it's just too goofy and self-aware for me not to at least crack a wry smile singing along to Richard's bassy talk-singing. It's everything that shouldn't work, yet it simply does. I say this at least deserves a top 60 placement. And besides, Richard's in the gay community! Usually that's a passing litmus test for Popheads. All I'm saying is, let's give "I'm Too Sexy" another chance.

**Mysario** (9): I have two moods and one of them is this song

**yourfacesucksass** (6.9): You know what I don't know lmao
#Too sexy for this song

**DaniG08765** (6): but what did Left say?

**ManofOranges** (5): I like this song when I don't have to listen to it in full.

**kirby31200** (4): More catchphrase than song

**splusten** (3.5): I physically can't give this a lower rating. I've tried, by God have I tried, but my body won't obey.

**camerinian** (3): I went back to the One Hit Wonderland Rate to remind myself what I gave this and all I did was remember the existence of "I'm Too Smurfy" why do I do this to myself

**hunnybee12** (3): no

**RVA\_101** (3): This is what they play in purgatory. Not hell. Purgatory. Because it's the hope that you'll one day get out. But you don't. You're there forever. And you're stuck with Fred.

**MrMoodle** (2.5): (#96) tbh i don't really understand how to rate a joke song against normal songs

**dlong5665** (2): this gave us taylor's worst lead single so thanks a lot for that

**jsonphile** (2): the joke gets old after 20 seconds. Or maybe I’m just not sexy enough for this song

#Simple peach farmer
**seanderlust** (10): PEACHESCARE FOR ALL.

**hunnybee12** (9): peaches yummy

**ImADudeDuh** (9): what the fuck janvkjadvdfvasdv i like it though. Also lump is a bop

**vapourlomo** (9): PEACHES COME FROM A CAN

**fadedblue09** (8.5): What dumb lyrics but gets points for sounding passionate

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.1): suckin on my titties like you wanted me, callin me all the time, like Blondie,

**aestheticen** (8): Interesting lyrics

**waluigiest** (8): why is this so funny

**1998tweety** (7.5): a vibe

**conceptualromance** (7.5): this is how people who are really into cottagecore sound

**twat\_brained** (7.3): Is this what inspired Rhett and Link? Or just like any early 2010s joke YouTube music video? It would not surprise me.

**jsonphile** (7): I have never heard this song before and it’s truly weird. Why is this guy so obsessed with peaches? Is it a metaphor for something? Something sexual? I have no idea. Pretty good song though

**Mysario** (7): movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of ass

**wavingwolves** (7): i'm sure elio from call me by your name loves this song

**yourfacesucksass** (7): remember when '90s alternative rock went through that "you can make a song about anything" phase?

**splusten** (6.9): Nice

**rickikardashian** (6.8): okay this bangs but what the actual fuck is this

#Why does HE get all the peaches?

**bbfan132** (6): it’s alright, nothing special

**camerinian** (6): I've listened to this more than a dozen times for this rate and my opinion has evolved from "huh?" to "huh."

**slimboyfriend** (6): Well diddle my skittle

**CreepyMannequin** (5): this sounds like a commercial

**cremeebrulee** (5): is this how call me by your name was inspired

**kirby31200** (5): Why didn't Sufjan cover this for the CMBYN soundtrack

**plastichaxan** (5): me after watching call me b… no sorry i cannot do this that movie/book is sick for doing that

**runaway3212** (5): it’s bad, but not the worst I’ve ever heard and it’s somewhat funny.

**dlong5665** (4): Lump outsold

**RVA\_101** (3.8): Points given for what I think is a bass at the intro with that upper-neck riff. Otherwise this song just feels sort of like a propaganda piece by the peach industry to get people to buy more peaches. At least the conspiracies behind the song are amusing (a metaphor for communism is the best one lol)

**u/astrologicalangel** (3.5): this sounds like a weird ad for Del Monte canned peaches

**ManofOranges** (3): You can be the ripest, juiciest peach in the world but there's still going to be someone who hates peaches. I'm one of those people!

**MrMoodle** (2.5): (#94) i feel bad because there was someone in the main thread saying to give this respect but i literally cannot grasp what there is to like about it

**ReallyCreative** (2): absolutely not

**CritneySpearz** (1.5): ??? one of the greatest songs of the 90s..? hmm..

**MrSwearword** (1): Hank Hill sings this better

**rslashpoopheads** (1): This is the kind of song best left forgotten in the past where it belongs <3

**skargardin** (1): im sorry but i just really hate this

**HermionesBook** (0): they decided to include this song rather than anything by janet jackson? ok...

**ignitethephoenix** (0): does this song have the laziest verses of all time? Idk but this is one of my least favourite things I’ve heard

**RainbowWhale101** (0): What the FUCK was that ????? I hated every second of it

**pearllouise** (4): I would pay good money to see Nelson react to this now

**steelstepladder** (3): It's low key kind of a bop I can't lie. This was a number one hit back in the day when hair metal was really starting to fade but which will make it an easy target but I think it has its charm. Not enough charm to where I think its spot on this list isn't justified but idk. I think you could do worse.

#Here she comes!
**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is the kind of over the top shit I was looking for!

**runaway3212** (10): So incredibly amazing.

**aestheticen** (9): This sounds like it's from the 80s. Cool song though

**seanderlust** (9): the first few lines are fun to sing as your pet walks into the room

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this doesn’t sound like a 90’s song (more like an 80’s song) which is probably why I like it more than a lot of songs here

**kappyko** (8): oh i like this it is so out of place though LMFAO

**RainbowWhale101** (8): That was cheesy as hell and I loved every second of it, 10/10 would listen again

**twat\_brained** (8): "Then Hanson comes along and becomes everybody's pretty-boy, long blond-haired brothers band of the '90s. Sorry, Nelson." I take it these guys were the Jedward of their time. Another advantage Hanson had over Nelson was that they were these adorable, multitalented spritely children, which Nelson couldn't sell.

**camerinian** (7.5): didn't think I'd enjoy a pop hair metal ballad in a 90s rate as much as I do but uh

**yourfacesucksass** (7.4): pretty cheesy even for the '90s but still, I guess 1990 is still the '80s in a way.

**RVA\_101** (7): This actually feels like an extension of 80s hair metal (Def Leppard in particular). I dig the intro dual-acoustic (or could be a single 12-string) riff.
#Nelson who?

**jsonphile** (6.5): Of all the 80s hair metal ballads that came out in the early 90s we could’ve included, why this one? Especially when November Rain is right there

**vapourlomo** (6.5): lol what is this mess and why do I kind of like it

**slimboyfriend** (6.1): They're like a 90s Greta Van Fleet but for Cheap Trick instead of Led Zeppelin

**Mysario** (5): I think it's kind of funny that this is the "glam" love song they chose to be on this list instead of something like "To Be With You" or "More Than Words"

**rslashpoopheads** (5): It's fine

**MrMoodle** (4.5): (#80)

**bbfan132** (4): til that this existed…. this is so tacky lol

**kirby31200** (4): It feels like it's a bit too busy and loud?

**TragicKingdom1** (4): honestly the song i'm most baffled made it in. hair metal seems so 80s and this isnt even good??

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i did not like this

**wavingwolves** (2.5): i don't have anything to say other than this feels like a parody of itself

**dlong5665** (2): wtf is this?

**moonagenightmares** (2): thought this was sung by some forgotten boyband before looking them up

**MrSwearword** (1): but I can live without this song so bye

**pearllouise** (6): I guess I am getting bored to death but lowkey vibing to this song at the same time.

**steelstepladder** (4): Honestly I think this placement is a little low but I get it. Out of all the alt rock on this list (other than Live I guess) collective soul has had the least amount of enduring fans as a band. I think the main guitar riff is alright and I do think that looking at some of the songs still in it could have been at least late day 1 but I wouldn't call it robbed exactly

---
#YEAH
**ReallyCreative** (9): I'm super nostalgic for this one and could not really tell you why, but it's fun without being obnoxious, it's iconic, it is the moment! it will most certainly go out day 1 though lmao

**wavingwolves** (9): the guitars in this are sooooo great ugh let's bring guitars back to popular music

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): idc if it's vaguely Christian, I still kinda like it

**yourfacesucksass** (8.3): this one hits good out of the 90s alternative-grungy hits

**Mysario** (8): [meow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns7Z8ag4oSY)

**waluigiest** (8): it was a lower score until the guitar solo

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**RVA\_101** (7.5): I find it funny that when this came out, people apparently thought they were either a Christian band or a grunge band and they've denied both lol. I do like this song though, that 'soft verse/loud refrain' music trope is executed well here. Always dug the guitar work here, and that '(yeah)' between guitar strums in the chorus is iconic

**splusten** (7.5): As a level 25 atheist I just insert the word 'beelzebub' in place of 'heaven' in my head and it works.

**bbfan132** (7): dolly parton’s version outsold but this is decent as well

**ManofOranges** (7): I like the guitar and the verses here.

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Loved the guitar solo, the rest of the song bored me.

**rickikardashian** (7): the guitar is amazing but this is a 30 second song looped for a long time

**runaway3212** (7): okay at worst
#Dad Rock Bad Rock

**vapourlomo** (7): YEEEAH

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Okay.

**MrSwearword** (6): the definition of above par fluff

**seanderlust** (5.8): bonus half a point for that video with the cat

**ignitethephoenix** (5): why is this song so boring sounding. The guitar / bass sounds cool though

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): would have rated it higher if it was only an instrumental tbh

**Roxieloxie** (5): please i cannot take another rock song free me from this prison

**camerinian** (4): why was there so much christian-adjacent grunge

**conceptualromance** (4): this song feels a lot longer than 5 minutes

**skargardin** (4): this is both long and excessively boring, bye

**twat\_brained** (4): I was today years old when I found out this is where that riff came from. That said an epilepsy warning should be in effect- wait why is there a don't tread on me flag fuck these twats. Never mind, they’re not worth my time

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i don’t care

**chillbumps5** (2): they have much better songs

**moonagenightmares** (2): so bland i forget what the song sounds like the second it ends

**MrMoodle** (1): (#99) holy shit this is comically terrible. so many songs were excluded for THIS. why.

as much as I do like this song, yeah this. 

I don't think I could actually hum you what the song sounds like off the top of my head.

huh.


but also fun fact Collective Soul did a live record with an orchestra and it's pretty tight. I guess if it's going out 11 songs in you all will have no interest in it, but it's still pretty cool. more artists need to team up with orchestras.

**pearllouise** (4): Many would make a Con Calma joke but me, an intellectual, knows what a “sample” is

**steelstepladder** (1): Another song I really liked as a kid... why. Probably because I didn't understand the extremely nuanced topic of cultural appropriation which is still quite tricky at times but this isn't good. I feel like saying this isn't good. My ones in this rate for the most part are songs that aren't necessarily the worst things ever but songs that I cant justify going out any time other than day one and yeah. This deserved the spot it got

#Licky Boom Boom Up
**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): aside from LICKY BOOM BOOM DOWN being amazing and terrible, the Jim Carrey spoof on In Living Color is THATGURL

**runaway3212** (10): I knew I recognized that melody from Con Calma from something.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): speaking in cursive, the song

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I don't really know what to make of this song, but it's enjoyable so there's that

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): derry girls is the only reason i actually know this song so shoutout

**Roxieloxie** (8.3): alright at least if this rate is gonna force me to listen to white men doing questionable things with primarily black generes at least this song isnt terrible. Also this is what Tom Hanks son thinks he's doing

**skargardin** (8): bop

**waluigiest** (8): this is so nostalgic for me and I have no idea why

**wavingwolves** (8): bilingual kid things: listening to a song you heard a lot before knowing english after you learned it. this was an experience. also, this fucks

**RVA\_101** (7.7): You lick....huh??

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): classic, Con Calma outsold though this kind of drags

**ManofOranges** (7): I hate that I like this song.

**succulentils** (7): huh, white Canadian Reggae...

**TiltControls** (7): another song that doesn't seem like it would work, but kind of does

#Licky Boom Boom Down

**Mysario** (6): Canadian anthem

**sandyfishnets** (6): ... I feel uncomfortable with his accent in this song...

**vapourlomo** (6): The optics of this are rough, but that hook is pretty solid

**plastichaxan** (5.5): con calma outsold

**bbfan132** (5): oddly catchy despite the cringiness

**RainbowWhale101** (5): NOT that pasty white boy acting Jamaican lmaoooo, he had no business doing that. Cringey.

**slimboyfriend** (5): he sounds white

**jsonphile** (4): kinda catchy but gets old fast

**kirby31200** (4): A licky boom boom down

**MrMoodle** (4): (#84) TOO LONG

**anothertown** (3): no <3

**CritneySpearz** (3): “a leaky bum bum now” omg yas bottom anthem

**sadshrub** (3): cultural appropriation is kinda cringe ngl

**twat\_brained** (3): a 5.6 in the OHW rate. That seems generous. Not as generous as VH1 was putting this on the list. How does this get weaseled onto the list instead of a better one hit wonder like Lou Bega or Scatman John? I am appalled.

**dlong5665** (2): yikes

**ggal2020** (2): this man is a white canadian...why does he sound like he’s from jamaica

**HermionesBook** (2): i keep hearing “lick your bum bum now” tbh

**nootnoot781** (2): i don’t think i can wrap my head around the fact that a white canadian sang this uhhhh

**rslashpoopheads** (2): umm

**camerinian** (1): "A-licky-boom-boom-down" really is one of the all time terrible hooks, mostly because I genuinely can't imagine any artist pulling it off, but somehow Snow would still be at the very bottom of that list

**ImADudeDuh** (1): the way he appropriated 2 different black genres at the same time

This song just kind of feels disposable in a way that not many songs here feel like and day one is a perfect placement. Sorry Mark.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): Mark McGrath with a career I love it

**TiltControls** (9.2): this shouldn't work, but it kind of does?

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): objectively it's not a great song but this is what the late 90s sound like to me

**ImADudeDuh** (9): its kinda wild to think they were a much more rock band before this song

**ReallyCreative** (9): I am a slut for Sugar Ray thank you

**twat\_brained** (8.6): don't have anything to say about Sugar Ray, apparently their lead singer is a d-bag but other than that music is better off having them associated with the late-90s music sphere

**vapourlomo** (8): lol this song is awful but I adore it. Maybe the most late '90s song ever written?

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Okay but '90s ska punk reggae fusion blah blah blah.....may have had some good points. Oh who am I kidding I loved it.

**bbfan132** (7): this is so dumb but it’s kind of a guilty pleasure for me

**kappyko** (7): the yarl almost ruins it

**ManofOranges** (7): The only reason I've known who Sugar Ray is for the majority life is because they were in the first live action Scooby Doo movie.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIgrowlsIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIclears throatIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

#Fly me away from here

**RVA\_101** (6.6): This song definitely takes a turn halfway through for the better imo. Makes it more interesting, but then it kind of 	quickly settles back into that groove, except it's kind of boring. It's just not something I keep coming back to like a lot of these other songs.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This sounds like an average 90s song that Lana Del Rey would love to cover but she'd probably replace the backing vocals that sound like the singer is trying really hard to take a shit

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): kinda works even though i don't like any of the individual elements

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): not the biggest fan of this song but i have a feeling the chorus will inevitably get stuck in my head

**waluigiest** (5): really not hitting the spot for me

**dlong5665** (4): I like the little guitar line but its so boring otherwise

**runaway3212** (4): This song makes me fucking tired

**wavingwolves** (2): really annoying

**pearllouise** (5): The anthem for Barbz on Twitter

**steelstepladder** (5): Cypress Hill are an important part of hip hop history in terms of latin hip hop and Insane in the Brain is a great showcase of that but, like so many of the songs in this rate, it comes off as weak against the field of some of the greatest rap of all time. The Jump Around comparisons are justified especially as that is the better song so I can't be too surprised that it went out so early.

**pearllouise** (3): Before us gay were given Shawn Mendes, the king of bland guitar pop was Duncan Sheik

**steelstepladder** (1): Another "does anyone actually care about this song" song. I actually think out of all the songs on this list that this is probably the least necessary inclusion. It's not awful by any means but forgettable is one of the worst things that you can be in this rate.

#Spring Awakening stans
**agentofscranton** (10): i liked the glee cover of this as much as it pains me to compliment blaine anderson

**ManofOranges** (9): Just keep breathing.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): WOW the nostalgia, a banger

**ImADudeDuh** (8): covid anthem

**MrSwearword** (8): no singer has the limited but distinct tone Duncan Sheik had. Still, the song is just this side of out of its depth.

**runaway3212** (8): “breathing bare or barely breathing, amiright?”

**rickikardashian** (7.8): someone is going to make a coronavirus joke, wont they?

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is the male version of Torn by Natalie Imbrugalia

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.2): a lot of tedious minivan rock in this rate

**RainbowWhale101** (7): The chorus is kinda catchy but overall the production is boring, the song couldve built more.
#I am barely listening

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Pretty generic for this time period.

**wavingwolves** (6.5): it's nice

**plastichaxan** (6): glee cast outsold

**seanderlust** (6): he kind of sounds bored

**bbfan132** (5): i love me some 90s pop rock but this makes me want to fall asleep

**MrMoodle** (5): (#77) this song would be so much better with a different singer. "i am barely breathing" is not something to deliver in the most monotone emotionless voice ever.

**sadshrub** (5): Boring

**splusten** (4.3): Unfortunately, this song exists, so she's got enough breath

**dlong5665** (4): cause i am barely listening

**kirby31200** (4): Nothing of note

**yourfacesucksass** (4): this is one of those songs that have been relegated as the soundtrack to every store ever and i can't fucking escape it. i barely breathe when this song is on and i just want it to die like the title suggests.

**anothertown** (3): this sucks hugely but he is still valid for Spring Awakening

**camerinian** (3): Jesus another adult alt nobody this is exhausting

**moonagenightmares** (2): this is way too long for such a boring song

**sandyfishnets** (1.5): I don't care for his voice, it's very monotone and lacks emotion which is in contrast to the lyrics he sings

**twat\_brained** (0): boring, generic and unconvincing. How are you "barely breathing"? Sing with conviction! Sound like your love is restricting your airwaves! This being one of the "greatest 90s songs" is inexcusable on VH1's behalf.

=====

McIgglyTuffMuffin: So it was a show originally funded via [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798121016/american-psycho) and the goal there was to bring it to the West End in London. It was based on the book rather than the film, but it is still recognizable enough if you've only seen the movie. 

Ultimately in the West End production Matt Smith, of Doctor Who fame, played the role of Patrick Bateman and he is who is on the cast album.

When the show hit Broadway, we got Benjamin Walker.

The first act is great and is pretty much a typical show, but then the second act gets a little weirder and experimental. I thought the two acts clashed with each other since they really didn't compliment each other. But I guess that could be a point itself with Patrick fitting in in the first act and Act II he is unhinged. 

[Here's the Broadway cast performing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJKsZ_5LG8) The song they are performing actually isn't eve on the cast album, but Duncan Sheik did include a demo version on one of his own albums.

This is rehearsal footage of [You Are What You Wear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQltDd14-Vc) which gives you a tiny idea of what was going on on stage.

[If you have Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/cadair8/playlist/3rynX9AchQGHFMU8zX4mTv?si=q-mPUFgUQ1i0xbMDTi4pJA&nd=1) here's a playlist of the West End cast version mixed with Sheik's demo and some additional music that is in the show, like Hip to be Square.

I happened to see it opening night on Broadway and had some awesome seats in the second level right in the middle. It was a fun time overall and I while I wouldn't have seen it a second time, I do listen to the soundtrack pretty often. There were rumors of a Broadway cast album, but that has yet to materialize.

**steelstepladder** (3): The other song I put in the bonus rate for the pure purpose of going out day one. This one got more defenders but this its just nonsense from beginning to end. Maybe you can find some charm in it but to me it's just so puzzling in how they just don't care about being competent that the novelty soured on me pretty quickly. It's not Girl on TV though.

**pearllouise** (1): And they say Katy is a bad lyricist

---

**anothertown** (10): do you remember? Do you remember??? When we met? That summer?

**HermionesBook** (10): unironically love this song. So catchy

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is so bad it's good.

**seanderlust** (10): Billy shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets. Michael J. Fox was Alex p. Keaton. there was a good man named Paul Revere. some people like to say that we are in a post-truth world, but that can't be true. we have the LFO archives.

**yourfacesucksass** (9): feels good and brings back memories of a good time but the lyrics oh my lmao

**ImADudeDuh** (8): they really do have a bunch of hits tho

**MrSwearword** (8): the Abercrombie & Fitch line still haunts me

**u/astrologicalangel** (7.9): this is ridiculous? I love it?

**TiltControls** (7.5): lyrical masterpiece!!!

**camerinian** (7): hahahahahah I didn't realise all the pop culture references in this song were actually just filler lines when he couldn't finish a rhyme this is so bad I love it

**cremeebrulee** (7): it’s the “i hate chinese food” and the 23892 mentions of a&f that’s not doing it for me but i like the vibe of it

**jsonphile** (7): Bob Dylan may be considered one of the best lyricists of all time but did he ever write a lyric like “New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits, Chinese food makes me sick”? No. Bob Dylan could never. I genuinely have no idea if this song is intentionally ridiculous or if it was meant to be taken seriously but either way I love it

**RVA\_101** (7): I've never heard a more disparate opening/lyric than "New Kids on the Block had a couple of hits/Chinese food makes me sick". Hope the dude secured the bag with an Abercrombie & Fitch endorsement deal

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): a little dated

**bbfan132** (6): the lyrics are so bad that they are hilarious

**RainbowWhale101** (6): Why did y'all make me listen to this cringey Abercrombie & Fitch advert

**hunnybee12** (5): newkidsontheblockhadabunchofhitschinesefoodmakesmesick

**Mysario** (5): [covering the covers: bonus edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJaQGMZcqhs)

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i love the lonely island

**wavingwolves** (5): this feels like a time capsule but i don't know if i hate it or love it

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): This sounds like a time capsule for people who were teens in the 90s but are now depressed wine moms

**wholesomebody** (4.5): i like girls that wear abercrombie and fitch

**valyse** (4): Points for nostalgia and cultural impact but truly one of the dumbest songs ever written lol

**kirby31200** (3): One of the worst songs in this whole rate, brought to you by Abercrombie & Fitch

**plastichaxan** (3): there are some good production things here and there but the voice and lyrics made me wish this was over like 3 minutes before it actually was

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Eh

**twat\_brained** (3): did u/mysario choose this

**sandyfishnets** (1): the rhymes in this song are an abomination

**splusten** (1): If I could give this a 0 on God it would be so.

**steelstepladder** (5): Man I loved this song when I was younger. Going back to visit it, it's just kind of okay but still theres a relaxed groove to it that a lot of the alternative that goes out on day one doesn't have. It's decent even if it's not world changing.

**vapourlomo** (6): By this point, grungy rock was kinda passé, right? Regardless, this just feels tired.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): This song is just a slurry mess of vocals ugh

**ignitethephoenix** (5): good for you? Also his voice is so boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): i am officially tired of listening to the same song sung by different white guys with guitars (that being said, this is one of the best iterations)

**Mysario** (5): I don't particular like this song but I feel like I know this song perfectly so maybe I do? I'd rather take sex and candy than listen to it that's for sure

**dlong5665** (4): really boring

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): the theme song of every senior dating a freshman

**slimboyfriend** (4): this is barely a song

**camerinian** (3): I refuse to believe there was ever a time when people actively chose to listen to this song. This was and will always be radio filler

**conceptualromance** (3): creepy

**ReallyCreative** (3): there are like 4 songs on this rate that do this exact same thing but immensely better

**anothertown** (2): this song has always been extremely creepy to me

**steelstepladder** (4): Hootie and the Blowfish were so successful it's weird. Your tolerance of them depends on how much corn you can take before it's too much, and it was too much for many of you, but I think this song is kind of charming in its goofyness. Way too out muscled by other songs to say it actually deserved better in this rate but what can I say I think it works.

#One of 20 Million Cracked Rear View buyers
**MrSwearword** (10): It's corny as fuck but I don't care

**TiltControls** (10): i don't even know what i like about this song, it's just so wholesome. also somehow i only learned this year that Darius Rucker was their vocalist???? How did I not know this???

**vapourlomo** (9): I probably only like this song because I get to bust out my terrible Darius Rucker impression. But idk it's a banger

**ManofOranges** (8): As someone who was born and raised in South Carolina, I do not get the obsession that everybody here has with Hootie and Blowfish. It's not that I hate them, it's just that everybody loves them TOO much!

**Mysario** (8): dadcore

**ReallyCreative** (8): going through this rate makes me nostalgic for riding in the car with my mom listening to the radio because she LOVED this shit

**runaway3212** (8): Plain great

**yourfacesucksass** (8): okay why am i a total slut for this song?

**twat\_brained** (7.6): "I'm such a baby, the Dolphins made me cry" it's okay Darius, I've wept over playoff eliminations too. H&TB sticking around for the 90s wouldn't have been a bad thing, all things considered. The SportsCenter video is just, absurdly corny, though, and I've already watched Peaches.

**ggal2020** (7.5): as someone who came around after the 90s, I’ll never understand the hate for hootie. they sound exactly like everything else from that time that people loved, and they have fun hits.

**RVA\_101** (7.5): This song is amazing because of Darius Rucker's voice. Makes perfect sense he went into making country music after the band went on hiatus, his voice is perfectly suited for it.

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Wagon Wheel >>>>>>>>>>>

**kirby31200** (7): It is kind of fun that Hootie has that 90s rocker voice but he sings lyrics like "a dolphin makes me cry"

#Whotie?

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Paved the way for Old Town Road.

**skargardin** (5): more mediocre rock, next

**seanderlust** (4.6): i cannot describe the level of disappointment i felt hearing this song and thinking he felt connected with nature and cried at a dolphin, and I was like, "wow, darius rucker showing a sense of vulnerability here. what a sensitive, sweet lyric" only to look it up and find out he's talking about a fucking football game.

**agentofscranton** (4.5): it's the way i did not realise this was a real band and thought they were made up for friends for me

**wavingwolves** (4): the album this song is from being one of the best selling records of all time doesn't make this any less bland

**bbfan132** (3): next song please, i don’t want to fall asleep at 10 am

It's preachy, condescending, and she doesn't need to sing like that. No. Don't like it

#Diamond in the rough
**MrSwearword** (10): it's not her best song You Were Meant For Me, but this is a classic just because Jewel has the weirdest vocals for someone that was successful

**runaway3212** (10): She really channels her Cher energy here

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I normally hate this style of vocal delivery but it suits the song. The yodeling works, in spite of itself

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**twat\_brained** (4): “I dunno, Jesus, I guess.” Also, since when do I have a soul? I thought I sold it to One Direction when I was 13. Moreover, Jewel sings like this disturbing mix between Gwen Stefani and Shakira and it’s just... ​ugh​. Todd is right.

**steelstepladder** (10): Genuinely one of the best introductions to a massive star in the history of pop music. You immediately know who he is, what he's about, and that he's going to be unstoppable. Love it or hate it, the power this has??? Unstoppable.

**pearllouise** (7): Shalissa

---
#Thank you for the support assholes
**awhile2** (10): basically every other line in this song introduced 8 year old me to something wildly inappropriate that i had never heard of before

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is gonna go out so early and for what

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): there's an... innocence? to em's old stuff, like he personally doesn't get how anyone could be offended by him. it's what makes his old shit so great, but it's also impossible for him to go back to

**MrSwearword** (10): STOP THE TAPE, THIS KID NEEDS TO BE LOCKED AWAY and HOW YOU GON' BREASTFEED ME MOM YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS are some of the best lines Eminem has ever said.

**runaway3212** (10): I really would take 30 more revivals just to get one more song as great as this by em

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): listen, it is a bop, but wow these lyrics are something.

**MrMoodle** (9.3): (#15) horrible histories outsold, stream king charles the second

**1998tweety** (9): He's a homophobe and a misogynist but I must admit...this does indeed bop

**bbfan132** (9): a bit too repetitive at times but it’s still funny and i’ll always enjoy it when it comes on

**ManofOranges** (9): When someone introduces themselves

**splusten** (9): Despite being overshadowed and out-barred by Vanilla Ice in this decade, Eminem still managed to release these indie bops and build a modest fanbase, and you gotta respect that hustle.

**vapourlomo** (9): Eminem is wildly overrated, but this might be his best song. So quotable! And, unlike most of his old hits, hasn't aged horribly

**stryxen** (8.5): he’s always doing So Much and this song is so close to being Too Much but I think it’s just The Right Amount

**wholesomebody** (8.5): eminem will really say anything on a track

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Alright, that Marilyn Manson wisecrack impressed me. Like what I said about No Diggity, however, I can't say I appreciate Dr. Dre's presence. Turn-of-the-millennium Eminem does deserve the credit he gets, though. Much as I don't like him he deserves his fame.

**kirby31200** (8): Who is this by again

**slimboyfriend** (8): can I give this a good score despite hating everything he's rapping about? yes

**waluigiest** (8): my dad played this era of Eminem for me in the car growing up so this is nostalgic for me lol

**RVA\_101** (7.8): People were so uptight about how fucked up his lyrics were back in the day lmao. It's just classic comedy/horror hip hop, it's purposely that way. Went to Spotify to listen to the explicit version cause I knew the linked video would be the censored version lmao. Classic Dre sampling of Labi Siffre's 'I Got The...'. Gotta love early Eminem, I just am tired of his output now, I can respect the lyricism but whereas the brash shocking lyrics were original and hilarious the first two albums, that he's still doing that shtick 20 years later is kind of tired now. But this Eminem is untouchable. This is what put him firmly at the top of the charts and towards the top of critics lists.

**camerinian** (7): I mean it's a great introduction to Eminem but The Real Slim Shady and Without Me do this subject matter and tone so much better so like why listen to this when those exist

**J\_Toe** (7): got excited thinking it was this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5abHKvUBQ

**kappyko** (7): the only eminem song i like
#This kid needs to be locked away
**rickikardashian** (6.5): i highkey hate the offensive and gross for the sake of it so much shit had in the 90s, this kinda bops tho

**HermionesBook** (6): eminem has better songs than this so i’m kinda surprised they chose this one. Great beat though

**Mysario** (6): I think a lot of people are gonna drag this because ew Eminem but there's a reason it won a Grammy and that it's on this list

**wavingwolves** (6): eminem has always had such an obnoxious persona but at the early slim shady days it was at least interesting. this isn't the best from that time tho

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.2): coming from a former eminem stan (i know), he has better songs tbh

**succulentils** (5): I bet teenagers loved this back in the day. 3edgy5me

**rslashpoopheads** (4): It's no Without Me.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): why is this Eminem song in here...idk if there are other 90’s Eminem songs but this is not one I like (edit: there is from his ep but i never heard the other ones)

**seanderlust** (2.5): so I didn't grow up with this early eminem, so there's no nostalgia value here so i'm hearing the full song for the first time now in 2020 and WHEW this one didn't age well.

**dlong5665** (2): ive always hated em highkey

**ggal2020** (2): -9 for disrespect to women +1 for being a little bit of a bop

**ReallyCreative** (2): annoying

**TragicKingdom1** (2): this is just annoying and unimpressive. like i get why it put eminem on the map because it shows his personality but his personality SUCKS!

**anothertown** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MuuMgWSQEY

**CritneySpearz** (1): abysmal

**Roxieloxie** (1): oh hey i dont remember this post malone song

**skargardin** (1): I hate it here, this is so insanely grating

**TiltControls** (1): I've never been a huge fan of eminem, but he definitely has better songs than this

**steelstepladder** (10): Boy oh boy I'm not a fan of this placement at all. I think this got the tripple whammy of being a ballad by a man and being extremely high up the list so people were put off by it but this song is amazing and I refuse to bend on it. Even if you're not one for the peace and love message songs, this has a lot more going for it than that. There's bitterness here and it elevates the song from good to great in a way that I don't see with other similar songs like Imagine. I love y'all but you guys are wrong on this one.

**pearllouise** (7): Back when U2 didn’t decide to take up every iPhone user’s storage with their album that no one cared to listen to. I was also considering giving this song a 1 purely just for the hell of it but I figured that would be too disingenuous.

---
#We are one
**agentofscranton** (10): i know it's probably super against the popheads way to like dad rock - especially with a band as dadrocky as u2 - or whatever, but with everything that's going on rn idk this song is just really hitting right for me. i mean ew rock music.

**hunnybee12** (10): my dad would be pleased with me for this score

**jsonphile** (10): I know U2 gets a lot of criticism nowadays but they made some really great songs in their day, and One is one of the most beautiful heartbreaking songs ever

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Let's get together and feel alright!

**vapourlomo** (9): As a diehard U2 fan, I've always found One a tad overrated. But it's still a phenomenal power ballad, with maybe Bono's best-ever lyrics.

**wholesomebody** (9): pls don't be mean to u2 popheads

**MrMoodle** (8.9): (#21)

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**stryxen** (8.5): this drags on so long like omg we get it… keep doing it though…

**RVA\_101** (8.2): Nice, soothing but not my favorite song on Achtung Baby either (Mysterious Ways!). Breezy composition, was surprised by Bono's falsetto at the end there.

**bbfan132** (8): this is definitely a good song but it doesn’t fully reach that sweet spot for me, surprised to see it this high on the vh1 list

**HermionesBook** (8): i honestly forgot how good this song was until this rate.

**ReallyCreative** (8): I'm not a huge U2 fan but this is a classic

**runaway3212** (8): honestly not my favourite U2 song, but a lot better than their worst stuff

**seanderlust** (7.7): i'm not usually a huge U2 fan but this was a good build!

**conceptualromance** (7.5): This is pretty far from being the best U2 has to offer. I like the way it builds, though.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I like some U2 songs but this is one I’m just kind of meh on

**splusten** (7.5): It's number 2 though, so it loses points for not guessing that right

**camerinian** (7): This is a nice song, but fuck it's gotta be the most overrated track of the 90s. Tbh I think Gen X just wanted their own Imagine and would take whatever they could get

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Great melody but I really dislike the dudes singing voice

**Roxieloxie** (7): now I know a grand total of 2 U2 songs (the other one was the miracle of joey ramone)

**succulentils** (7): “Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?” Hmm...

**yourfacesucksass** (7): ok
#A BALLAD??? By a MAN???? There must be some mistake

**slimboyfriend** (6.2): all U2 songs sound like generic arena rock change my mind

**ManofOranges** (6): I do NOT like Bono!

**rickikardashian** (6): a bathroom break so early on? wow

**J\_Toe** (5): Just realised i've never heard a U2 song before. It's okay

**MrSwearword** (5): the Mary J. Blige featuring version is leagues better than the original

**Mysario** (5): where's Mary J Blige

**skargardin** (5): U2 and this song in particular has never done anything for me

**twat\_brained** (5): I will never understand why my mother literally worships the ground U2 walks on, but then again I still hold out hope One Direction will reunite someday so what do I know? :P In fact, what I do know is that Mysterious Ways deserves a spot on this list way more than this preachy dirge does. In fact, the lyrics and melody are actually really well-composed, Bono just sounds like he's trying to force his way through a scratchy throat, and the falsetto is just way too indulgent for my liking. This band belongs in the 20th century.

**waluigiest** (5): kind of a flop

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i don’t care about this

**static\_int\_husp** (4): How is this so high in their rankings? U2 has so many better songs.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): can’t wait for this to leave asap

**awhile2** (3): mysterious ways is the only good u2 single to come out after the 80s

**kappyko** (3): they got in the studio and cried about this? fuck off you shouldve broken up after the joshua tree

**wavingwolves** (3): i don't hate this completely but there's just something about u2 that i never liked and this one of their worst

**nbapip** (2): three four

**anothertown** (1): This episode of Glee.. THE WORST!!!

**dlong5665** (1): lmao i hate u2 sorry

**seanderlust** (7.8): love the backwards guitar before the last chorus

**RVA\_101** (7.5): Oh thank god it's not that pity fest PETA song. This song is much better too.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I prefer other songs by her

**MrSwearword** (7): vocally, serve yas gawd. Otherwise it's decent.

**RainbowWhale101** (7): I like the production but the singer sounded like she was about to fall asleep

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Not her best but I always love her voice.

#A mystery about how this made it on the list

**twat\_brained** (6.8): cute song but the real mystery is this song's placement on the list over Better Off Alone by Alice Deejay

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): my knowledge of her is limited to Delerium's "Silence" and ASPCA and this isn't giving me a reason to learn more

**dlong5665** (6): queen of lilth fair

**u/astrologicalangel** (6): I can’t justify this at all but this seems like the most ‘90s’ song on the list

**wavingwolves** (6): good

**ManofOranges** (5): Stick to the ASPCA commercials, Sarah!

**skargardin** (5): i sleep

**MrMoodle** (4.5): (#79)

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is kinda boring

**vapourlomo** (3): Sarah McLachlan is so painfully boring. And her voice just makes me think of the sad puppy commercials, and then I'm bummed.

**pearllouise** (8): That awkward moment when the song starts and you think it is some Irish meadow song and then you realize what song you are listening to once the beat kicks in.

**steelstepladder** (3): Every point I give here goes to the harmonica. We do not get as many harmonica solos as we should in music... Basically everything is just ok and kind of by the numbers. This kind of feels like the perfect position for it as VH1 gave ranked it one spot ahead of us so congrats on being almost perfectly rated!

#Running I'm running I'm running
**ImADudeDuh** (10): who wants to go caravanning across a dirt road in california?

**runaway3212** (10): my mom overplayed this to me, not complaining though

**seanderlust** (10): of the songs on this list that are completely new to me, this might actually be my favorite. I love the background harmonica(I think?), the subtle keys, the extended similes...I get the hype.

**ReallyCreative** (9): the 90s were truly a test of how iconic some of the most annoying songs ever made could be, and this song is the posterchild for that concept

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Definitely very feel-good campground sort of tune, but it feels too much like dad music. I’d know because my Dad has this on his iPod.

**aestheticen** (8): I love the vibes! Feels like I'm on a road trip to the beach and I have nothing to worry about

**dlong5665** (7): I've heard this song a million times but I could never tell you the name or artist lol

**ignitethephoenix** (7): these guys sound like the budget bare naked ladies

**kappyko** (7): :)

**MrSwearword** (7): only because of the harmonica and because of the WTF moment in life that was John Popper being arrested for having a shitton of guns in their trunk

**Mysario** (7): take away the harmonica and you get "All For You" by Sister Hazel
#All you wanna do is slow me down
**MrMoodle** (6.5): (#62)

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Only 90s kids will remember...

**ManofOranges** (6): Well... I prefer the hook. It really does just bring me back.

**RVA\_101** (6): Points for the killer harmonica solo. The rest of the song is not all that memorable.

**vapourlomo** (6): I'm confused how this just-okay jam band tune made the list, and yet Dave Matthews was shut out?

**bbfan132** (5): this is the blandest shit ever yet my mom and all of the old couples near me would always play this at parties when i was younger

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): i worked in a flower shop and this song once came on the radio while i was crying under the counter because my boss yelled at me over a broken vase.

**wavingwolves** (4): this is for sure a song that exists

**skargardin** (3): i simply really hate this

If you are sexually aroused by that comment I just made then congratulations Halsey.

**steelstepladder** (2): I kind of feel bad for this one I really do but I've never cared for Matchbox 20 outside on Unwell. He sings it like he means it absolutely but this song kind of washes over you without having too much of a lasting impact. At least compared with the other extremely white minivan rock that is here.

#The rain's gonna wash away I believe it
**aestheticen** (10): Great song

**CritneySpearz** (10): so fuckin good, the slowed down version is even better also wow

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is a 10 idgaf, matchbox twenty just make me feel good and angsty

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I love Rob Thomas.

**runaway3212** (10): (M(13) - 3) X A(1) = 10, everyone who rates this lower just failed math

**TiltControls** (10): it pains me that we may never rate this again and I'm not giving it an 11. I spent way too much time deciding between this and my actual 11. The lyrics are heartbreaking and Rob Thomas delivers them with enough passion to make them count. I really hope it gets enough love to make it to day 3 at least!

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop, How Far We've Come deserved it's success though

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a classic

**MrSwearword** (8): there's better Matchbox Twenty material. Also, Rob Thomas is just a pleasant enough male vocalist.

**Mysario** (8): I can't believe they got the singer of Grammy-Award Winning 1999 Hit "Smooth" By Santana Featuring Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty for this

**rickikardashian** (7.7): should i give this song a 3 just for the joke?

**camerinian** (7.5): Matchbox 20 have so many massive bangers but they all came out in the 2000s so I guess this will do.

**conceptualromance** (7.5): this reminds me a lot of “Mine” by Taylor Swift but like if it was a much better song

**HermionesBook** (7.5): honestly matchbox twenty had so many great songs

**selegend** (7): i love rob thomas but this is okay

#Outside it stars raining

**RVA\_101** (6.5): It's ok, nothing that grabs me though. Ironically I am indeed listening to this at 3 AM because it's the day this thing is due and if I don't get through these songs I'm gonna miss it and I've already made it halfway through the list so might as well keep going

**wavingwolves** (6.5): there's so many sad songs in this list... maybe people were really going through it in the 90s

**ManofOranges** (6): Nothing to say about this one, sorry Rob!

**slimboyfriend** (6): I kinda like this song but I know if I was forced to listen to it more than three times in a row I would hate it

**twat\_brained** (6): Rob Thomas just has this incessantly nervous, unhinged way of singing that strikes a ​really​ weird nerve with me, and honestly I don’t know that Matchbox deserves a spot on this list as much as an act like Smash Mouth or Harvey Danger

**vapourlomo** (6): The textbook definition of "just fine."

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): theres a lot of white male bands in this rate and i think matchbox twenty may be the least essential pick here

**bbfan132** (4): she screams and her horse is strange

**cremeebrulee** (4): matchbox twenty is a name i haven’t heard in a minute but wow is this song boring as hell

**dlong5665** (4): why did all the 90's alternative radio bands have the same singing style? its like the pre-cursor to cursive singing

**MrMoodle** (4): (#82)

McIgglyTuffMuffin: Alright Popheads, you didn't disappoint me too much, outside of I Alone. Some of the comments physically pained me to read, but it's okay, I'll have a couple of beers and get over it. 

Now get some rest, we have a big next two days, champ. (I'm ready to be disappointed).

moonagenightmares: The songs that are out are all perfectly reasonable...... day 1-ers ❤

This is looking like a solid rate so far

pig-serpent: Peaches sacrificed itself for a reasonable day one. King of Humility!

HermionesBook: i'm so relieved pearl jam, metallica, and nirvana live to see another day    
i think nirvana will chart the highest out of those 3. i'm most worried for pearl jam

camerinian: I'm genuinely really surprised that Metallica survived day 1, especially since Korn got slaughtered

chillbumps5: you fucking fucks 3 AM is out?  the song about rob thomas’s mom having cancer?

ggal2020: This was such a wild day, almost every song that got out I gave either above an eight or below a two, and one of my 10s lost completely. Also y'all are absolutely tasteless for eliminating 3AM and Peaches this early.
