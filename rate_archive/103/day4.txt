MrMoodle: I can see how it's more palatable than most rock songs to popheads. It's got really catchy hooks, it's high energy, it's not overly sincere, it doesn't drag, it's dynamic, it's iconic and memorable, the singing isn't intentionally off-key, it's not pretentious, it doesn't sound like every other dad rock song in this rate, and of course, most importantly, Kurt Cobain was young and hot. 

Yeah, Popheads is overly harsh on men and rock, but it's not a *totally* arbitrary bias, there are a lot of common problems with the genre that are particularly hard to swallow if you're the kind of person that loves pop music. Smells Like Teen Spirit doesn't really share those problems, so it's not all that surprising it was well-received here.

---

**pearllouise** (8): Once again, thank you VH1 for reminding that this song exists and that it is not called the “Doo-doo-doo” song.

**steelstepladder** (7): A bop! Out of all the adult contemporary I'm glad this is the one that rose to day 4. The hook is stroooooong in a way that a lot of the other so

---

**TiltControls** (11): An absolute classic. Not only is it fun to jam to, but it also has surprisingly great lyrics. Not many songs can be this catchy while also containing such utterly heartbreaking lyrics disguised with an air of happiness.

**agentofscranton** (10): those doo-doo-doos really trick you into thinking this song is anything other than a cry for help from a drug addict

**bbfan132** (10): the lead singer is an asshole but i will always love this, it’s so energetic and catchy despite the grim lyrics

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is an 11 contender tbh

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this is a song that I fucking love. It just sounds absolutely amazing. Period. And yes, it is about being addicted to meth, what about it?

**MrSwearword** (10): I've never known what a Semi Charmed Life is but who cares, song is fire

**slimboyfriend** (10): This reminds me of carefree summer days in my childhood which is weird because I was one year old when this song came out and also it's about meth

**TragicKingdom1** (10): incredible bop

**vapourlomo** (10): Probably the best song ever written about crystal meth that also sounds like the Doug theme song

**wavingwolves** (10): this is such a 90s soundtrack song and i love it everything about it

**twat\_brained** (9.7): class A drug use has never felt this cheery since the Beatles made legendary

**camerinian** (9): Jesus how does one song have so many hooks

**Mysario** (9): I want something else

**ReallyCreative** (9): serotonin acquired

**rslashpoopheads** (9): DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO

**valyse** (9): Still slaps.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): i won't forget singing this like no tomorrow as a kid without a care in the world what the lyrics meant, sweet jesus no wonder i'm gay now.

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is cute

**runaway3212** (8.5): the first second of this sounds exactly like Picture To Burn

**splusten** (8.1): No idea why they made a song about a tv show from that premiered in 1998 starring Alyssa Milano that my mom made me watch but you do you boo.

**jsonphile** (8): this song is so fun! I have no idea what the lyrics are but I’m sure they’re about all fun happy things

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute but kind of forgettable

**MrMoodle** (7.4): (#41)

**J\_Toe** (7): didn't expect to like it as much as I did

**RVA\_101** (6.6): Why did I think Third Eye Blind was a grunge band, this is poppy as fuck lmao. Maybe I thought Third Eye Blind is just a grungy name. It's aight. Like the guitar riff, but it's still kind of just bland otherwise. Hope 6.6 doesn't wind up looking like a harsh score, it doesn't mean it's bad, it means I just find it kind of blind. If I give it below a 5, it's probably a problem.

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): at the end of this rate im going to be able to reverse engineer the life of a suburban 90s white skater boy

**stryxen** (5.5): I really like the guitar. Umm yeah. The drums are decent too. The rest is just annoying <3

**dlong5665** (5): eh

**skargardin** (4): i could not wait for this to end

**awhile2** (3): this type of rock music was the worst part of the 90s

**pearllouise** (10): It’s ironic how the one song that Thom Yorke hates turns out to be his best song.

**steelstepladder** (9): Creep is to Radiohead like Criminal is to Fiona Apple. Yes they have made arguably better and more experimental stuff later on but that doesn't mean their most commercial period isn't great as well.

---

**aestheticen** (10): Noooo you can't just listen to one Radiohead song!! Haha Creep go brrrr

**bbfan132** (10): i know that this is their most popular song and it was on a shitty album but it’s still an iconic anthem

**conceptualromance** (10): this song is a banger and Thom Yorke and co could never convince me otherwise!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the vander von odd performance at nightgowns of this is one of my favorite drag performances ever its so good

**letsallpoo** (10): gay anthem...

**ManofOranges** (10): Whenever anyone talks about the song "Creep" I'm always disappointed because it turns out they're talking about the Radiohead one and not the TLC one.

**runaway3212** (10): I don’t really love radiohead, but this song is more than amazing

**seanderlust** (10): the opening build is a favorite of mine. the way the first six lines sound like a love song and then it takes a turn >>>>>

**slimboyfriend** (10): "not like other boys" culture!

**splusten** (10): See Loser comment

**stryxen** (10): yup 0.0

**vapourlomo** (10): Don't tell Thom Yorke, but this is probably still his best song

**wavingwolves** (10): being a grumpy teenager and listening to this while crying in your room bc no one understands you >

**HermionesBook** (9.6): one of the catchiest songs and probably my favorite by TLC

**camerinian** (9.5): Saying Creep is the best Radiohead song to piss off nerds on /mu/ will never not be funny

**1998tweety** (9): why is every cover I've heard of this so much better, Melanie Martinez really ended them.

**dlong5665** (9): they've obviously done much more acclaimed work but this song is still so good

**jsonphile** (8.5): while not Radiohead’s best or most innovative, the haunting lyrics and sound of the song are pretty great

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8.5): Hard to believe Radiohead came such a long way from here to In Rainbows and A Moon Shaped Pool. Still a great song though

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): oh my god, i LOVE radiohead! creep is like, such an amazing song, right?

**twat\_brained** (8.4): I get why Radiohead disavow this, but it’s not really even that bad. Then again, I relate a bit ​too hard​ to these lyrics than I care to admit

**engifear** (8): Is this song cringy? Yes. Do I like it anyways? Also yes.

**skargardin** (8): overhated bop i fear

**waluigiest** (8): I’ve heard this song is very good.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Radiohead has just never been my thing, they're just white noise to me

**anothertown** (7.5): :Hits restart on the Social Network trailer:

**TiltControls** (7.2): I know Radiohead hates this song, but I think it's fine. Not their best, but still good

**MrSwearword** (7): Thom Yorke hates this song and while I can't totally blame him, maybe he needs a tall glass of shut the fuck up

**Mysario** (7): deducting points for being too relatable

**RVA\_101** (7): I'll admit Radiohead is probably the most critically acclaimed artist I just never clicked with. They have so many classic albums, OK Computer, Kid A, In Rainbows, so on, but everything I've heard just hasn't clicked like it seems to have with so many others. I'm sure it'll click one day, so I'll keep listening to them until I 'get it'. I can respect Thom Yorke's songwriting, I just can't help but cringe with the whiny emo lyrics, this is one of those classic 'I'm not like everyone else' jams. I'm glad they elevated beyond the level of songwriting on Pablo Honey, they immediately stepped up and made better music afterwards (which I still can't get into lmao).

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the Reddit / stalker / r/music anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): mid

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): every cover of this song is better than the original, i said what i said.

**Roxieloxie** (6): oh this isnt creep by tlc

**succulentils** (6): This list only has titles, so when I saw that Creep was up next, I was expecting TLC. It’s a nice song - I get why indie girl singers always cover it - but I ain’t about whiny white men. I only like his voice when he ups the octave.

**MrMoodle** (5): (#74) this is the only song on the rate i felt i needed to put spotify on private mode for, don't know what that says. all i can think of nowadays listening to this is jughead's stupid hat. this song wasn't always so embarassing right?

**ReallyCreative** (3): TLC outsold, outtalented, outeverything'd.

**ggal2020** (0): the dude that stalked me for a year used to always play this song on his shitty acoustic guitar and I hate it and I hate him. why do you have to be so melodramatic and self serious all the damn time thom? and why tf can’t you spell your name like a normal person?

**nootnoot781** (0): incel anthem yes

**steelstepladder** (4): I've never loved this song like other people because they say Never Gonna Get It just too many times.

---

**1998tweety** (10): ICONIC

**bbfan132** (10): don’t let go is my favorite en vogue song but this is also perfect

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOqb_UzJSUQ

**ImADudeDuh** (10): and now its time for a breakdown *uncontrable sobbing*

**ManofOranges** (10): And now it's time for a breakdown. Never gonna get it, never gonna get it, never gonna get it, never gonna get it, never gonna get it, never gonna get it, never gonna get it WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOOOOOOOAAA

**MrSwearword** (10): it got my eleven once before but it was up against Groove Is In the Heart. Still, it's a fucking BANGER

**runaway3212** (10): I wish I had annoying guys in my life so I could relate to this song

**seanderlust** (9.3): oooooOOOOOOOO BOP

**anothertown** (9): the arpeggiated harmonies in this song take me there!!

**awhile2** (9): top 3 lip sync for your lifes

**dlong5665** (9): ugh what a fun song

**Mysario** (9): wah waH WAH WAHHHHHH

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): Bring flutes back to pop music!

**camerinian** (8.5): I really thought this wouldn't be a new song to me given the nature of this sub, but it honestly does slap, the breakdown at the end is lush

**RainbowWhale101** (8): I'd heard part of this song in Pitch Perfect but never listened to the actual song until now, I loved it!

**skargardin** (8): stan en vogue!!

**twat\_brained** (7.6): who was the lead singer? She’s incredibly pitchy and it decreases the song’s overall quality. Bonus points for the breakdown and the harmonies, but it’s not as great as it could be.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Yup!

**TiltControls** (7.5): Raven flashbacks

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): song about the state of the covid vaccine

**RVA\_101** (7.2): Addictive chorus. They kill the harmonizing too throughout but the best part is easily the breakdown at the end. And I'm pretty sure I recognize the 'ooooooooooBOP' from my childhood, I knew I heard it before.

**wavingwolves** (7): 90s girlgroups made points

**MrMoodle** (6.5): (#59) the bridge is great, the rest of it is kind of boring except for the little flute bits

**splusten** (6): Cindy Herron had 4 children, so someone did I guess.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**agentofscranton** (10): maybe men made some points in the 90s

**conceptualromance** (10): 4 minutes and 50 seconds of satisfying ANGST

**dlong5665** (10): its a silly song and i know people hate it but fuck it i love it so much

**fadedblue09** (10): "Sappy ballads by rock bands" is my guilty pleasure genre.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): going to pretend that I didn’t think this was an 70/80’s song before this rate lol

**ImADudeDuh** (10): and i DONT WANT THE WORLD TO SEE ME

**kirby31200** (10): This song just makes me feel things. I can't put how this song makes me feel into words.

**runaway3212** (10): obviously

**sandyfishnets** (10): YEAH YOU BLEED JUST TO KNOW YOU'RE ALIVE

**stryxen** (10): I forgot about this song and now i’m crying thanks vh1

**TiltControls** (10): though this song is kind of overplayed, the goo goo dolls are seriously underrated. Slide is one of the best hits of the 90's and even their more recent stuff is still pretty good

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): Radio queen.

**vapourlomo** (9): It's a grunge song for soccer moms, about ghost Nicholas Cage creeping on Meg Ryan. And somehow, it works! It really works!

**waluigiest** (9): okay honestly this is the peak of adult contemporary

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): the raw emotion of this song, I personally prefer slide but this one slaps

**splusten** (8.5): AND I DON'T WANT THE WORLD TO SEE MEEEEEEEE

**chillbumps5** (8): slide is better

**cremeebrulee** (8): was this ever on grey’s anatomy

**ManofOranges** (8): Pretty good

**skargardin** (8): help i havent listened to this in so long

**twat\_brained** (7.3): better than I care to admit, I just loathe Grey's Anatomy core music

**bbfan132** (7): i wish i liked this more but it’s just a pretty good sentimental track to me

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i never really got the love for this song but it’s okay i guess

**MrSwearword** (7): it might be overplayed garbage by now, but it was decent for what it was

**Mysario** (7): I only listen to one podcast and it's "[Punch Up the Jam](https://headgum.com/punch-up-the-jam/iris-by-goo-goo-dolls-with-chris-fleming)"

**RainbowWhale101** (7): I had no idea this song was called Iris! The chorus is a bop but wow the verses are so dull

**RVA\_101** (6.3): I distinctly remember reading this as one of the longest running No. 1 singles. I'm not gonna lie, I don't get it, it's a little dry for a 16 week chart topper, no? I didn't even feel much from the guitar solo. I do like the mandolin

**MrMoodle** (6): (#66)

**Roxieloxie** (6): i skipped this song alot when i was 11 anc it came on pandora, and tbt i could've kept doing that

**yourfacesucksass** (5): i'm sorry i'm only here for slide or name, but iris? byeeeee nicolas cage and meg ryan.

**wavingwolves** (4): one time i read in a teen magazine that this was avril lavigne and deryck whibley wedding song and i never forgot about it

**pearllouise** (3): I’ll let Popheads throw rotten tomatoes at me for my lack of taste. This hurts me because I love Zombie and Dreams mostly because of how timeless the melodies are. Linger, on the other hand, just doesn’t do it for me. Sorry.

---

**chillbumps5** (11): dreams is one of the best songs ever

**wavingwolves** (11): this is one of my favourite songs ever that's all

**aestheticen** (10): This is too low on the list man

**anothertown** (10): I can’t believe I’ve never listened to this and I’m finding it like the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard. Anthemic, powerful, ethereal, emotional, with a complex hook, it is everything you could ever want

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely gorgeous, dolores had one of the most beautiful voices i’ve ever heard

**camerinian** (10): this is just one of the most effortlessly beautiful songs ever written. There's such a stunning tenderness and fragility to everything in this song. For every song that continuously pops up in romcoms as the climax soundtrack, this might be the most deserving one there.

**hunnybee12** (10): for a sad song it sounds so angelic and peaceful

**ManofOranges** (10): Such a serene song

**MrSwearword** (10): not Zombie, but still a fabulous song

**rslashpoopheads** (10): An absolute classic.

**vapourlomo** (10): If it weren't for Nirvana, this would've easily gotten my 11. I adore this song, from the lilting melody to the heavy Irish vocal accent to the swelling orchestra. Probably one of the most beautiful tunes ever written.

**seanderlust** (9.4): i had only heard zombie before this, so the fact they can do this as well? she has the range darling.

**1998tweety** (9): cute

**dlong5665** (9): of the three big cranberries songs its my least favorite but its obviously still great

**jsonphile** (9): god I love Dolores’ voice. May she rest in peace

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's just a little too long but it's beautiful

**runaway3212** (9): It’s amazing, but I still wish it was Zombie, just so I would’ve had an easy 11

**Mysario** (8): when I was younger, I never saw why this song made a lot more lists than stuff like "Zombie" or "Ode to My Family" but now that I'm older... I get it

**RVA\_101** (8): I am definitely surprised they didn't go with Zombie for this list. But great news for me because now I'm introduced to another fantastic Zombies song. I'm actually surprised I haven't heard this song before. RIP Dolores

**twat\_brained** (8): I miss Dolores O'Riordan and her comforting Celtic voice, but it's as worldwide as Dreams, or as scathing as Zombie. Yet again, VH1 drop the ball, and I'm fed up of it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is nice but I feel like it’s missing something

**J\_Toe** (7): honestly prefer Zombie, but this is yet another song on this list referenced in Community (I guess Dan Harmon is nostalgic for the 90s? Or grew up then?)

**sadshrub** (7): them pipes do

**skargardin** (7): classic but i honestly find this a bit boring

**waluigiest** (7): why do I think this song is kind of funny. I can’t explain it

**kirby31200** (6): Genuinely surprised the Cranberries song on here isn't Zombie

**RainbowWhale101** (6): This song lingered like a bad smell. Went on too long and was totally uninspiring to me.

**MrMoodle** (5.9): (#67)

**ImADudeDuh** (5): tbh i don’t care about this. zombie>>>>

**moonagenightmares** (2): this song making the list but not zombie is a crime

---

**steelstepladder** (10): This is just a joyous song!

**pearllouise** (8): This rate is really helping me remember the titles of songs better than Shazam ever could.

---

**aestheticen** (11): This song makes me feel so optimistic and tells me that I shouldn't give up and that there is indeed a reason to live. I love it so much.

**camerinian** (11): God I just adore everything about this song. I want to live in the world this song creates, one of optimism, recognising your past and present battles and scrapping through all the bullshit to live your inner happiness forever on the outside. It’s a snarky song, but it’s in the service of populist joy and liberation, and holy shit there are melodies and embellishments for days. As soon as you think this song is coasting, it throws in something new, even just for a fleeting second, and it’s constantly engaging. These guys sound like they had massive amounts of fun making this, and it really shows. It’s maximalist in the best way, leaving every great idea in the pot and letting it all coalesce into a perfect sunshiney pop bop. Gregg Alexander is a genius, and we need to find a way to rate Murder on the Dancefloor, the other 11 he helped make

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): this is the perfect pop song, i don't care what anybody says. without fail, i hear this song and i want to go to the mall and frolic around and eat a pretzel and do a shopping montage.

**splusten** (11): This 11 could go to a lot of songs on this list, but this song gets it and it's my body my choice and I don't have to explain it.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): A quintessenial 90s song. Captures the spirit of rebellion of the era, while managing to be unabashedly optimistic. It still sounds unique and inovative too, all these years later.

**agentofscranton** (10): that bridge whew golden gate wishes

**bbfan132** (10): i recognize the chorus sort of but i totally forgot about this… this is cheesy as hell but i love how uplifting it is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): HEALTH INSURANCE RIP OFF FLYING FDA BIG BANKERS BUYING FAKE COMPUTER CRASHES DYING CLONING WHILE THEY’RE MULTIPLYING

**jsonphile** (10): this song is just a masterpiece of fun pop music. So many great moments throughout this song (“we’ll kick your ass in” being one of them)

**kappyko** (10): and then he made murder on the dancefloor yas

**ManofOranges** (10): You wanna talk about a hit? Well you've got one now. The sheer amount of euphoria I get from listening to this song is astounding. I practically ascend to another plane whenever I listen to this. It's SO DAMN GOOD. Also, this song was in the Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, so it gets bonus points in my book.

**MrSwearword** (10): a fucking classic

**vapourlomo** (10): You've gotta love a bright pop song with super dark lyrics about societal collapse!

**wavingwolves** (10): i love the "we're flat broke but hey we do it it in style / the bad rich god's flying in for your trial" part so much... also the outro calling out rich ass artists... points were made

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): BOP

**1998tweety** (9): tea

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this song makes me feel nostalgic

**Mysario** (9): when I used to watch VH1 a lot, I feel like they mentioned this song whenever they could in the "I Love the 90's" segments. Also anybody who talks about the 90's. More specifically, just the last 30 seconds of the song

**skargardin** (9): actually a massive bop, why is it so low on this list

**TiltControls** (9): 1000x better than the new versions

**seanderlust** (8.6): tag yourself i'm the absolutely random disses at beck, hanson, etc

**dlong5665** (8): the needless hanson and courtney love dissing brings down what would be an all time great song for me

**kirby31200** (8): Hey don't be mean to Hanson

**twat\_brained** (8): “Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson” If this song ends up below MMMBop Gregg 100% deserves it for writing “I am a Jew! A JEW!!! AND YOU’RE MY HITLER!!!!!!!!!”. His delivery of that lyric will leave you bellowing in raucous laughter, so at least there's that. Despite that, this song is undeniably great. Also, he cowrote “Murder on the Dancefloor”, so he’s in my good books for that.

**u/astrologicalangel** (8): this is like the exact opposite of ‘Loser’

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): You've got the music in you :)

**RVA\_101** (7.5): I like the chord progression here, the major-minor switch and the bassline is great

**RainbowWhale101** (7): The opening chords gave me katy perry firework vibes lol. I like the positive energy of this song.

**runaway3212** (7): It’s not great but it is pretty good.

**waluigiest** (5): stream You Are the Music in Me - Sharpay Version

**wholesomebody** (10): yEs hE iIis

**pearllouise** (8): Rebecca Black, is that you?

---

**1998tweety** (10): mood

**bbfan132** (10): kind of simple compared to some of their other songs but i still love it, it’s super cheery and pretty in the best way possible

**camerinian** (10): I remember when I used to think this was The Cure’s best song. It’s probably not even top 10. God they’re a perfect band.

**chillbumps5** (10): siamese dream so good

**dlong5665** (10): literally perfect

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Suddenly im british and full of eyeliner

**vapourlomo** (10): This feels way more like an '80s song, but a catchy jam is a catchy jam!

**jsonphile** (9): it’s no Just Like Heaven, but it’s a great song

**pearllouise** (8.5): Finally get the opportunity to rate one of the most iconic songs in gay culture. The song that invented gays. The song that inspired a movement of gays. A song that threw the first brick at Stonewall. Fucking Vogue. Oh, and P.S. please thank Madonna for helping unlock the closet door for you.

**steelstepladder** (7): This is probably unpopular but I always considered this kind of a B tier Madonna song. Now a B tier Madonna song would still be A tier on anyone else but if you give me the choice between this and Ray of Light or Like a Prayer (do that rate as well) I will take those any day of the week.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, queen of pop

**awhile2** (10): babylon wishes it was vogue

**bbfan132** (10): i memorized the spoken word verse when i was 7 or 8, that’s how iconic this is

**brenda\_official** (10): sue sylvester, dance on air

**dlong5665** (10): the production on here is just perfect ugh 90's madge had no missteps except for acting career but we don't talk about her

**ignitethephoenix** (10): always a fav

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking iconic. You don’t know how many times i’ve lip synced to this in my room acting like i’m a model. Gay culture appropriation never sounded so good

**J\_Toe** (10): Battle for your life, Babylon!

**kappyko** (10): the peak of her discog honestly

**ManofOranges** (10): Such a great song, and I stand by that.

**MrSwearword** (10): the sixth best Madonna song ever made

**plastichaxan** (10): this is too iconic to give it any less than a ten and also still holds up

**ReallyCreative** (10): yeah I'm gay, keep scrolling

**rickikardashian** (10): remember when we rated this in the charity rate and we decided that everytime we touch by cascada was better than this? lol

**runaway3212** (10): madonna invented moving your body to music

**selegend** (10): WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT!

**skargardin** (10): BA BA BABYLON! UGH this is too iconic

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Madonna said gay rights

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - come on vogue! Gay anthem

**twat\_brained** (10): strut it out walk a mile serve it ancient city style. Didn’t we rate this in the charity rate?

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): THAT'S GOSSIP

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): everyone watch Pose, one of the best shows out currently!

**seanderlust** (9.5): sue sylvester outsold. i'm not giving this a 10 because it has been rightfully critiqued for taking voguing out of its context in ball culture and erasing POC in the rap breakdown, but it's hard to argue against its cultural importance as well as the fact that it's just a bop. it's glossy and fun and impossible not to dance to.

**RainbowWhale101** (9): Truly a cultural reset

**wavingwolves** (9): gay people didn't exist before this

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.7): the definition of a CLASSIC

**engifear** (8.5): Justify My Love was snubbed

**jsonphile** (8): waayyy too long of an intro. But a great song anyway

**rslashpoopheads** (8): not just where you bump and grind it

**TiltControls** (7.2): Vanessa hudgens sweetie I'm sorry

**RVA\_101** (7.1): I was wondering where I recognized that 'Strike a pose' phrase. I think that's my favorite part of the song actually. That and the rapping verse, I must have heard this somewhere before because I recognized that verse, where she's name dropping all those people. But I don't remember the rest of the song. This feels like a continuation of the 80s synthpop sound.

**MrMoodle** (6.8): (#49) i mean, nearly the entire song is just build up for the final chorus, even if the final chorus is good

**GlialUreterostenosis** (4): https://radfag.com/2015/05/31/vogue-is-not-for-you-deciding-whom-we-give-our-art-to/

**steelstepladder** (10): This is a perfect song. I don't know why boy bands tried to make songs after this one. It's like to boyband pop to what All I Want for Christmas is You is to Christmas music. Why are other people even trying after this? We have the song.

**pearllouise** (7): The soccer mom saga continues. I Want It That Way is THE song many would associate with cheesy boy band songs from the 90s. From corny teeny bop choreography to cheap music video transitions one may find in a middle schoolers powerpoint, it is no denying that the cheesiness of it all is what makes a boyband iconic (and everyone loves cheese).

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**aestheticen** (10): Iconic

**bbfan132** (10): surprised that this ended up at #3 but it’s a classic so i’m happy with the placement… hopefully it makes it far in this rate too

**conceptualromance** (10): king shit!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolute classic, invented boy bands

**ManofOranges** (10): The way the first time I was exposed to this song was through a potter puppet pals video set to the tune of Weird Al's parody of this song, "eBay."

**MrSwearword** (10): the Backstreet Boys' best song, don't /u/ me

**Roxieloxie** (10): I hadn't actually heard this song until 2018 but honestly it still bangs all these years later

**runaway3212** (10): The Backstreet Boys covering that song in that one B99 episode and getting all the credit. Smh.

**selegend** (10): max martin is a god

**twat\_brained** (10): @ Popheads who have met Max Martin tell me everything because my life is incomplete if I don't at least witness him in the flesh.

**vapourlomo** (10): Weirdly, the only boy band ballad I love

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): TELL ME Y-E

**wavingwolves** (9.5): this is a quintessential pop song and we're in popheads so i have to rate it accordingly

**camerinian** (9): will there ever be a better boyband song? Yes, and it’s Perfect by 1D, but this is still pretty good

**yourfacesucksass** (9): nothing will ever let me forget how 1999 was the greatest year in teen pop and how me as a 5 year old even knew that this song was going to be iconique.

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): The lyrics are empty and borderline nonsensical, but that key change really makes up for it

**MrMoodle** (8.7): (#23) nsync outsold

**awhile2** (8): the i bought it on ebay parody of this song was one of the first youtube videos i ever watched and was also my introduction to the BSB. its a better song than this and would get my 11 if it was in the rate

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): prefer Tearing Up My Heart

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is iconic but like, really overrated as far as teen pop goes.

**J\_Toe** (8): torn between mentioning this song's cameo in Brooklyn 99 and talking about Max Martin's musical grammar. Either way, both comments will have already been made a hundred times.

**jsonphile** (8): NOW NUMBER FIVE! Honestly not a huge fan of the boy bands but this is pretty great despite its nonsensical lyrics

**RainbowWhale101** (8): An absolute classic hit, the 90s wouldn't be the same without it

**rslashpoopheads** (8): The soundtrack of my childhood.

**TiltControls** (8): tbh weird al's ebay was better

**waluigiest** (8): boy band excellence

**HermionesBook** (7.8): such a catchy pop song

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): NOW NUMBER FIVE Also I typed out the lyrics to the first line of the chorus in a Club Penguin lobby and everyone finished the rest of the song. Genuinely wholesome moment

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.2): i’m ashamed to admit that right up until i did this rate i thought this was sung by nsync (yes my pre-00s pop culture knowledge is awful)

**kirby31200** (7): Tell Me Why this ranked so high

**Mysario** (7): [reminder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCXca-aB9Fc)

**skargardin** (7): i forgot the keychange existed so just for that im gonna bump up the score, wowee

**seanderlust** (6.5): so he can and does say he wants it that way, but she can't ever do the same? the sexist double standards jumped out.

**splusten** (6.5): More relevant today than when it released in 1969

**stryxen** (6.5): I will never be able to explain why this song makes me uncomfortable, so I’ve given up on holding that against it and now I just enjoy

**RVA\_101** (6): Shoutout to Weird Al Yankovic because I knew about 'eBay' even before hearing the original lmao. I was actually singing his lyrics with this while listening. As far as boy band music goes, this is pretty good. Another soothing, breezy production.

**dlong5665** (5): never cared for the boy bands

**RainbowWhale101** (11): One of the greatest songs of ALL TIME

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**conceptualromance** (10): There’s really nothing else in the world when this song is playing

**dlong5665** (10): no one will ever be able to do it like whitney

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Dolly parton did outpeak, sorry popheads.

**J\_Toe** (10): I'm only familiar with the signature hook, so the beginning of this song was really unexpected for me

**kirby31200** (10): Deserves every bit of praise it's received, which is a lot

**ManofOranges** (10): Power ballad like no other. The fact that this is written by Dolly Parton and performed by Whitney... there's just so much power there.

**runaway3212** (10): I loved penny’s cover of this

**seanderlust** (10): legitimately one of the best songs of all time, regardless of decade IMO.

**stryxen** (10): (,:

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - Whitney did not d*e to get anything less than a 10

**twat\_brained** (10): RIP Whitney, we miss you.

**waluigiest** (10): there is a REASON this is the definitive version. stunning.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): One of the most iconic songs of all time, no one else could pull this off these days

**plastichaxan** (9.5): whitney was too powerful

**RVA\_101** (9.3): This is so painfully overrated like Smells Like Teen Spirit but I can't help but give her a high score anyway because of the sheer fucking POWER in her voice. We might never get a voice like that again. Not a top 10 Whitney Houston song by any measure. Rest easy.

**HermionesBook** (9): whitney’s vocals on this are so gorgeous. That final “AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII” always gives me goosebumps

**jsonphile** (9): Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I like Dolly’s version just a bit better. Also the sax solo is super cheesy. But of course Whitney’s voice is amazing

**yourfacesucksass** (9): the moment the guitar comes in at the beginning, ugh and then the SAX UGGGHHH, it's the ballad. dolly cancelled.

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): Name a more perfect funeral banger

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.2): kind of wish the instrumental was as bombastic as Whitney's vocals, though i suppose it's the only thing keeping the song grounded in real emotions

**Roxieloxie** (8): I mean it's iconic what else can i say

**wavingwolves** (8): this is a 90s staple but there's better 90s ballads and also better whitney's ballads

**camerinian** (7.5): the swell takes a bit long to get there tbh, but jesus what a swell

**TiltControls** (7.5): Technically stunning (but I kinda prefer Dolly's???)

**brenda\_official** (7): i think this is the first time i’ve ever heard this song from start to finish

**kappyko** (7): whitney has so much better than this but its cute idc. "its not right but its okay?" now thats an 11

**skargardin** (7): i mean this is truly one of the most iconic ballads of all time but for me it doesnt truly come alive until the keychange now that is a wigsnatcher

**vapourlomo** (7): Hot take: this song takes too long to get to the vocal fireworks. The last 90 seconds are an 11.

**MrMoodle** (6.8): (#48) i mean, nearly the entire song is just build up for the final chorus, even if the final chorus is good

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.4): whitney has way better songs honestly. all the man that i need deserved all the acclaim this song got

**splusten** (6): Whitney comes of as kind of cringe in this one, since I only like her as a friend.

**bbfan132** (5): the first half sounds pretty but the second half is way too overblown/annoying for me, i definitely prefer dolly’s heartfelt/softer version

**Mysario** (5): minus that sexy sax, it's kind of an unexciting ballad that feels too reminiscent of Dolly's OG until 3 minutes in when *drum hit* aND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

**aestheticen** (4): Overrated as hell

**MelodramaticLemonade** (3): This really falls flat for me when the key change has virtually no buildup, and that saxophone sounds so cheap like it's from a parody

**TragicKingdom1** (3): whitney's worst #1. the dolly version heavily outsold

**moonagenightmares** (2): i would give it a 1 if i was being honest about how much i hate this song but i dont want whitney fans to kill me so im giving it a point for the vocals

**pearllouise** (10): Damn I miss when songs were this groovy. If are not familiar with Deee-Lite, then get familiar.

**kirby31200** (11): Astronomical!

**MrSwearword** (11): one of the greatest songs ever made AND BETTER FUCKING MAKE TOP FIVE THIS TIME

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic

**anothertown** (10): I love how 60s flower power stuff defied the 20-year/40-year nostalgia cycle and came back in the 90s

**bbfan132** (10): awesome song, shame that the lead singer defends far-right activists now

**camerinian** (10): Put Slide Whistle In Your Songs Challenge 2020

**dlong5665** (10): this really doesn't get enough credit for how influential it was

**ImADudeDuh** (10): do i be a dumb bitch and give this an 11 again knowing that it’ll just horrifically lose the rate again for a 3rd time?

**kappyko** (10): i still cant believe theres people that hate this

**ManofOranges** (10): This was my 11 for the one-hit wonderland rate... it's not my 11 for this rate but it's a hit nonetheless. Groove really IS in the heart!

**plastichaxan** (10): this song is pure serotonin

**RandomHypnotica** (10): absolutely iconic, and I'll be mad if this doesn't make Day 3 or 4

**rickikardashian** (10): this being from the 90s feels wrong

**seanderlust** (10): I remember hearing that slide whistle as like a five year old and being shook to every fiber of my being.

**skargardin** (10): maybe, just maybe, this won't be robbed this time around

**TragicKingdom1** (10): hope this gets top 10, it really deserves

**twat\_brained** (10): not even the Lady Miss Kier's right-wing opinions on Twitter can deter this song from getting the 10 it truly deserves

**vapourlomo** (10): More slide whistles on pop songs, please! (also, shoutout to Q-Tip, whose Tribe Called Quest was erroneously excluded from this rate)

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is the least 90’s sounding song from the 90’s

**jsonphile** (9): one of the best dance songs ever made. So many great moments in this one song

**wavingwolves** (9): oh this is def a fun song

**yourfacesucksass** (9): if this were been released today, it'd be over for all the main pop girls

**awhile2** (8): would be a 10 if it wasnt for the slide whistle

**MrMoodle** (7.9): (#32) oh my god this one hurt. i saw it and figured this'd make top 5 because i love this song, but the more songs i've ranked the further it's fallen. the reason i was ranking in the first place was so i could be harsher since there are so many great songs, but now i can't give this an 8 because of it! this rate is brutal.

**chillbumps5** (7.5): hold on i missed it... where is the groove again?

**RainbowWhale101** (7): The best use of a slide whistle ever

**splusten** (7): Groove is, unfortunately, stored in the balls and I wish this bad anatomy wouldn't be spread.

**Mysario** (6): this song's so weird

**rslashpoopheads** (6): How many times do I have to review this VHS aerobics soundtrack until y'all stop shoving it into rates?

**RVA\_101** (6): I'm not evaluating based on videos, but lmao the video is such a trip. As a song though I'm not feeling this groove in my heart. Q-Tip surprised me halfway through tho.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): more annoying than fun

**runaway3212** (5): I always thought this song was annoying

**fadedblue09** (2.5): The last time I rated this ugly barrage of noise, I learned that it was apparently a crime to dislike this. And honestly, I tried to revisit it to see the appeal but my opinions barely changed, and I felt like I ended up wasting my time again. Sorry.

**moonagenightmares** (0): english does not have the curses i need to describe how much i hate this song

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I did not like this in the One-Hit Wonderland Rate, and still do not like now. It is still one of the most cluttered, poorly put together hits in contemporary music.

**pearllouise** (10): This song makes me want a bank to rob me instead.

**steelstepladder** (10): I was hoping this would sneak into the top 10 but 12 is a solid spot too. The chorus hits, the piano hits, the verses hit. It's just a perfectly made New Jack Swing song.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): why did they censor part of the woman’s rap? odd

**ManofOranges** (10): The first time I heard this song was in Pitch Perfect.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of my favourite songs in this rate definitely

**MrSwearword** (10): because the song knocks and the video with marionettes

**runaway3212** (10): I honestly am still mad the bella’s got eliminated for this, it and it’s are the same word I still hate it.

**TiltControls** (10): A classic

**TragicKingdom1** (10): underratedly excellent pop songwriting with the multiple hooks and guest verses to keep things from getting too repetitive

**splusten** (9.3): Fucking YES Diggity

**dlong5665** (9): the production and that chorus is so perfect

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i was really ready to give this a 10 but its lowkey not as good as the chorus is

**Mysario** (9): while it's completely unrealistic that [100s of college students would perfectly harmonize on this at once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q573_hDhTbE), I can thank this for always making me smack my stomach when they say "got game by the pound"

**seanderlust** (9): iconique

**succulentils** (9): First time hearing the full song. It’s great. Know what’s not great? Pitch Perfect. Fuck those shit movies.

**wavingwolves** (9): this sounds like a kpop song or better yet: kpop sounds like this

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): Anna Kendrick Lamar outsold

**MrMoodle** (8.2): (#28)

**RVA\_101** (8.2): Teddy Riley killed the production AND his vocals here, can't believe he had to convince the rest of Blackstreet to record this lmao. I desparately want to give this a 9 or above but points off for the bland verses from Dre and Queen Pen, they just don't do much for me. Shoutout and RIP Bill Withers, whose classic 'Grandma's Hands' is the key sample here.

**anothertown** (8): I’ve heard so many shitty white acoustic versions over the years that I forgot how good the original is

**camerinian** (8): This is an great iconic tune but I’ve never willingly listened to it because I can always bank on club or radio throwback nights playing this every single time without fail and jesus christ they need to mix it up

**HermionesBook** (8): can’t believe I’ve never heard this! Such a jam. Love the beat

**kirby31200** (8): Very weird how the first time I heard this was sung by a bunch of white girls in Pitch Perfect

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I diggity.

**skargardin** (8): queen pen went off

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): how many people will mention glee

**twat\_brained** (7): I can't in good conscience pay due credit to Dr. Dre following his abuse history, but I will pay due credit to Blackstreet and Queen Pen, who make the song undeniably theirs. -1 for the wack puppeteering in the video however

**pearllouise** (10): Can’t help but think how Lauryn Hill was THAT bitch back in her day

**steelstepladder** (7): In terms of ballads I think this is pretty on par with I Will Always Love You in terms of that there are certain elements that carry this song when other elements are kind of weak. Lauren has done better on her own album but this is still pretty great

---

**ggal2020** (11): one of the best songs of all time. so minimalist and so breathtakingly beautiful.

**skargardin** (11): miss lauryn absolutely owned this song, it's just so iconic

**waluigiest** (11): LIFE CHANGING THIS SONG IS TIMELESS the vocals the harmonies the transitions the history it’s all gorgeous

**bbfan132** (10): stream save the day by mariah carey along with the original by roberta flack and participate in the women of neo-soul rate in january!

**hunnybee12** (10): timeless

**ImADudeDuh** (10): up until like 2015 i thought this and the roberta flack’s original were the same song

**jsonphile** (10): Lauryn Hill is a goddess and can make anything sound good. Also one of the few covers I like more than the original

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a hit, plain and simple.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): lauryn hill is an icon, she is a legend and she is the moment

**MrMoodle** (10): (#7) someone on the tiktok sub said that whenever they heard this it conjured images of a train crashing in slow motion and all these floppy grey alien bodies flying out of a cargo carrage onto the freeway and now it's all i can imagine whenever i listen to this

**MrSwearword** (10): YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS Lauryn Hill hitting her stride and owning this song vocally

**ReallyCreative** (10): I love the original too but this one just sends me to another dimension

**Roxieloxie** (10): literally iconic

**runaway3212** (10): I’ve already given so many 10’s but these songs are so good

**TragicKingdom1** (10): better than the original simply for the ethereal, haunting quality. we should rate The Score methinks

**wavingwolves** (10): i listen to this song so often that it's almost like it doesn't fit the rest of the songs in this rate

**RainbowWhale101** (9): They gave me VOCALS they gave me SOUL they gave HARMONIES and I LOVED every single second of it

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Roberta Flack did it better but this still slaps.

**RVA\_101** (8.9): 'Lauryn Hill says her heart was in Zion, I wish her heart still was in rhymin'. What a gem, what a voice. The game needs The Fugees. This is one of those instances where I prefer the cover to the original (respect to Roberta Flack), like Hendrix's 'Watchtower' over Dylans, or Sinead 'Nothing Compares' over Prince. Shoutout Wyclef and Pras who could only say 'one time, two times, and assorted adlibs at the end. Wouldn't have minded a verse from Clef but then it would have taken attention off Lauryn's amazing vocal performance.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I still prefer Roberta's rendition. Lauryn does it great justice, though. The problem, however, is that Wyclef and Pras are nowhere to be seen, so there's almost no point calling it a Fugees song. Also, the foreign strings after the choruses always felt off to me.

**HermionesBook** (8.5): Lauryn is the best part of this song for me. I love her voice

**splusten** (8.5): Yes please

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): honestly thought this song was originally by the fugees, which shows how superior it is

**TiltControls** (7.2): i like the original a little better, but still good

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the fact there’s multiple versions of this song confuses me so much

**rickikardashian** (6.7): there’s part that are very pretty and nice and other parts that just don't sound that great

**dlong5665** (6): I don't care for any part of this song that isn't Lauryn

**Mysario** (6): I've never been a fan of this song (due to how slow it is for my taste) but it's hard not to recognize this is just a really well done cover

**Srtviper** (11): Fiona, master of every decade.

**1998tweety** (10): queen

**agentofscranton** (10): more like fiona slaps-le. thank you i'll be here all night.

**bbfan132** (10): stream fetch the bolt cutters or any of her other 4 excellent albums

**conceptualromance** (10): This song really shows off what a clever lyricist Fiona is

**ManofOranges** (10): Fiona Apple makes such weird music, and the majority of it I don't really enjoy, but I've warmed up to this one a lot since first hearing it.

**MrSwearword** (10): the songwriting is legendary for a reason, it slays

**runaway3212** (10): So amazingly great

**RVA\_101** (10): Ah I can't give Fiona Apple any less than a 9, especially any song off of Tidal or When the Pawn. Even though I kind of hate that this was her biggest hit and probably the only one most know of her, ostensibly because of the attention-grabbing music video, because she has so many other solid 11s in her 90s output. Paper Bag. Shadowboxer. Fast As You Can. Never is a Promise. Sleep to Dream. But this is her most iconic songs and easily one of the most iconic songs of the 90s. That instrumentation/orchestration never gets old. The video is so dodgy, considering her story and what she went through. Unparalleled songwriter, your favorite probably looks up to her (at least mine does).

**sadshrub** (10): It’s criminal that I have to choose between this and Cali Love for my 11

**skargardin** (10): this song is such a journey

**splusten** (10): Makes me feel like a fucking sultry, dirty, naughty little boy in my car ride to work. Seriously though, this song is an absolute banger regardless of Fiona's later success.

**stryxen** (10): from the intro this song just sounds so moody and intense and it just makes me feel Something.

**waluigiest** (10): She doesn’t miss. This is so fucking good the writing the vocals the instrumental the themes??? A fantastic, fantastic artist.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is 12 actually

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this is the only Fiona Apple song I like

**jsonphile** (9.5): god that piano is great

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): not even the best song off Tidal but it's a fucking event that grabs your attention and doesn't let go

**camerinian** (9): one of these days I’ll get into Fiona Apple, I promise

**MrMoodle** (9): (#19)

**Mysario** (9): there's some aspects of this song I'm not a fan of (namely that elongated jam outro), but this is such an amazing track and the fact it hit high on the charts is kind of amazing in itself IMO

**twat\_brained** (9): this video feels like the antithesis to Lady Gaga’s “Just Dance”. Also, I tried to listen to the song again, and while it’s well-written, I always feel like I’m missing something when I listen to Fiona’s music. Godney, I’d love to film a party-themed music video

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): She was, what, 19 when this song came out? And this song is better than 90% of the songs on this list made by people who've had five times more experience in the music industry?

**anothertown** (8): Desperate Housewives/PLL bop

**dlong5665** (8): people tend to dismiss her early, more radio friendly songs but this shit is just as meticulously produced and written as her later work

**ImADudeDuh** (8): honestly before i did this rate i did not like this but now its grown on me. I feel like this can slumber party the rate tbh

**kirby31200** (8): Did you know she dated David Blaine? I didn't.

**letsallpoo** (8): such a wonderful jennifer lopez song

**vapourlomo** (8): There's better cuts on When The Pawn, of course, but "Criminal" still goes hard. It's so jazzy!

**TiltControls** (7.7): Fiona's got better, but in terms of iconicness this is her signature song and it is still great

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.6): the way this is the only fiona apple song i like

**J\_Toe** (7): I want to like Fiona Apple, but I don't just yet

**selegend** (6): i only like it when jlo’s pole dancing to it

**Roxieloxie** (3): is the the bolt cutters girl

**steelstepladder** (8): This got my 11 in another rate, grading on a curve is really bringing my average down but I feel like I had to or else half of these songs would get 10s. I DO love this song though. I do prefer No Scrubs

---

**ReallyCreative** (11): an outstanding song with an outstanding story and message, Niagara who?

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**anothertown** (10): Left Eye delivered perfect lyrics and flow on this, rip </3

**bbfan132** (10): the video of them standing on water while singing this will always be iconic

**ggal2020** (10): a top 10 most important song of my childhood (and I was born in 2002!) it’s so hard not to give this an 11

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck the AIDS epidemic

**kappyko** (10): crazysexycool isn't my thing but this song is eternal

**ManofOranges** (10): I love this song so damn much. Actually, I love a lot about CrazySexyCool and TLC in general, but the sound this song has, the lyrics this song has, Left Eye's verse, it's all there, and how can I not appreciate it. I've listened to this song mores times than is probably healthy.

**MrSwearword** (10): Left Eye's rap, the morality tale done right, it's legendary

**rickikardashian** (10): oh to be a sorority girl dying in a bathtub after giving birth while this song plays in the background

**Roxieloxie** (10): I only really knew the chorus of this song but really listening to the whole song, its extremely powerful

**stryxen** (10): every part of this song comes together in a way that is most pleasing to me

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - a safe sex anthem AND left eye's rap

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a perfect song

**seanderlust** (9.8): you don't need me to tell you how great this song is, so i will instead use this space to encourage you to stream the TLC album that came out a few years. way back is a whole vibe.

**RVA\_101** (9.1): Very powerful message and video. RIP Left Eye and thanks for the classics. No Scrubs is still better tho imo.

**jsonphile** (9): Left Eye’s rap verse literally perfection

**skargardin** (9): iconic

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): I have nothing witty to say but this song eats.

**runaway3212** (8.5): this song is great but not as great as some people say it is

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): this song itself should show people how '90s r&b hip/hop shaped the teen pop sphere of Y2K. the catchy chorus, the video, all of it was so perfect. that said, the whitest kids ever have somehow turned this song into a whole different thing for me. i can only think of will poulter in we're the millers rapping to left-eye, or that really cringe scene from the very first episode of scream queens when the mean white girls are dancing after they literally watched their SORORITY SISTER DIE after childbirth?! anyway.

**DaniG08765** (8): much deeper than people realize

**dlong5665** (8): i miss left eye so much

**sadshrub** (8): Klaus used this to brainwash a cult so you know it’s good

**twat\_brained** (8): great but No Scrubs should be here instead

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): a good song I just never clicked with TLC voices fully

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I can't listen to this song without cringing, because this one time in high school, we had a substitute teacher who made some reference in class to this song, but nobody got it (this was around 2012), and so she was like "it's Waterfalls! By TLC!" and nobody knew who they were. When she left the room, I was being a little dick and said something like "what a freak, who the hell knows weird bands like TLC" (I hate myself too don't worry). Unbeknownst to me, the teacher had come back in the room and was right behind me... So now everytime I hear this song I cringe inside because I remember what a complete asshole I was and I feel so guilty and ashamed ugh

**splusten** (7.5): This song gave us the Other Guys, and for that reason, I'm in.

**kirby31200** (7): It's good but I didn't grow up with it so I'm just kind of eh on it

**MrMoodle** (6.8): (#50)

**J\_Toe** (6): I prefer No Scrubs

**vapourlomo** (5): A bit sleepy for me. No Scrubs would've gotten a 10.

**pearllouise** (11): Alannis made several points with this banger. I have never been in a relationship with anybody before but this song stills make me vengeful of my cheating scum ex-boyfriend that never existed.

**steelstepladder** (8): The only returning rate winner gets a top 10 spot! It's a classic for a reason though and genuinely deserves this high spot. This is THE scorned by an ex song to end all scorned by an ex song.

---

**1998tweety** (11): ugh what a massive bop

**moooo566** (11): I didn't know about sex when I first listened to this song on loop in front of my deeply concerned parents, and even then I knew it was incredible.

**bbfan132** (10): the raw energy put on display here…… alanis absolutely snapped

**dlong5665** (10): alanis really went OFF here

**ggal2020** (10): the fact that this album always gets called a pop album while the boys get called grunge is sexism and I will not stand for it

**HermionesBook** (10): the best song to listen to when i’m feeling angry

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lemon queen

**ManofOranges** (10): Alanis went off SO hard with this one it's unbelievable (oh!). And to think this is all about one of the actors from Full House. This has already won a rate so I this point I don't think it has anything left to prove.

**MrMoodle** (10): (#5)

**MrSwearword** (10): sure it's not Alanis' best song Head Over Feet, but this still fucking slays. Still can't believe this is about Dave Coulier

**Mysario** (10): why did she go down in the theater? did he drop his candy or something? she's gonna miss the movie! here cums the best part!

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is absolutely deranged in the most iconic way possible, I almost threw my 11 away but it has no chance of winning because you all have no taste!

**stryxen** (10): literally the blueprint thank you alanis for literally everything we have now

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this is such a random song to come back as the only previous winner because im pretty sure its gonna go out at like #17 (another incorrect tk prediction incoming?)

**twat\_brained** (10): fuck you Dave Coulier. Shoutout to the karaoke scene in Booksmart

**vapourlomo** (10): THE ANGST IS SO STRONG I LOVE IT

**wavingwolves** (10): scream this song on karaoke is the best thing ever

**seanderlust** (9.8): https://twitter.com/indecisivejones/status/1237746175446528000?lang=en

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): Post-breakup psychobitch rage anthem!

**TiltControls** (9.7): this is 100% anger in song form and I love it

**camerinian** (9.5): I've never been more scared of getting movie head

**runaway3212** (9.5): this is a 10 but my sibling overplayed it, still extremely good

**jsonphile** (9): the way she sings “are you thinking of me when you fuck her” is just perfection

**kirby31200** (9): Fucking Dave Coulier

**skargardin** (9): we love an angry bop

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (9): - excellent song but vocals could be better

**sadshrub** (8.8): that disgruntled white ex-girlfriend energy

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Is Alanis even capable of making songs that aren't bops?

**splusten** (8.2): Only thing I don't like about this song is that she isn't quite mad enough

**anothertown** (8): well can you feel it??????????

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the lyrics and vibe of the song, but I just don’t love Alanis’ voice much

**waluigiest** (8): not to make this into something totally different but this song sounds exactly like the Spyro soundtrack and I love that those games are essentially a 90s period piece

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): uncle joey made her MAD.

**RVA\_101** (6.7): My favorite fun fact about anything Alanis Morrisette is the rumor that this is written about the actor who played Joey on Full House. I respect Alanis but I'm just not that big on this song's sound.

**Roxieloxie** (6): wha- whats happening here

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.3): eh

**conceptualromance** (5): I think it was really cool of Alanis to write this for Beyonce

**u/astrologicalangel** (3): the gen x ‘irony’ is too much to bear

**moonagenightmares** (2): her voice is excruciating and the lyrics are cringe the only reason this is a 2 is because there was a part where she wasn’t singing

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**anothertown** (10): :lives here:

**bbfan132** (10): i don’t care what anyone else says, this is one of my favorite björk songs and i will always adore it

**ggal2020** (10): the only björk song I like and I LOVE it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we HATE TRAGICKINGDOM1!!!!!!!!!!

**J\_Toe** (10): I'm that weird bird that appears in the background of the song at 0:43

**ManofOranges** (10): This is just a pure classic. Like this song is out of another decade or something, and it's SO fun! The sheer change from quiet to loud is just so exciting, and Bjork yelling is so funny to me I love it.

**MrSwearword** (10): it's Bjork being weird, slay

**Mysario** (10): shame me but this was Bjork all along!?!?!?!?

**plastichaxan** (10): the one that got me into Björk aka one of the most essential musical journeys of my life

**RainbowWhale101** (10): Bro that was ART, I was pleasantly surprised, it just kept getting better and better.

**RVA\_101** (10): ZING BOOM

**seanderlust** (10): toad sang the "this is it" part. this would unironically be my 11 if it were in the main rate.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**twat\_brained** (10): it's björk how can't I give her a 10

**waluigiest** (10): EVERY TIME THE HORNS COME IN I LOSE MY MIND

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): wait I’ve never heard this song before but it’s actually rly good wtf

**jsonphile** (9.5): I’m gonna be honest, and this may be a crime against humanity, I’ve never listened to Björk, so this was my introduction to her. But oh my gosh what an amazing song please send me recommendations for what to listen to next

**GhostCamo** (9.1): The 90s is my favorite music era and I have never heard this before. This is amazing! Makes me want to stand up and kick my legs like a Rockefeller dance girl!

**camerinian** (9): even knowing they're coming, Bjork's shrieks still scare the shit out of me

**ReallyCreative** (9): she do be screaming

**u/astrologicalangel** (9): very nearly a 10, but the experimental elements were a little too much for me

**wavingwolves** (9): swell!

**dlong5665** (8): a great song but not the bjork 90's song i'd highlight

**kirby31200** (8): I kinda always assumed from the name and album art and fashion that Bjork's music was all going to be super experimental and weird and go way over my head. But I actually get this and it rules?

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Love this! Think I've heard it a couple times before when I was checking in at the Homewood Suites!

**TiltControls** (8): odd, but the atmosphere and mannerisms really sell the song

**vapourlomo** (8): Probably the peak of the '90s quiet-loud-quiet thing

**selegend** (7): far from her best in the 90s but def her biggest hit

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): since when did bjork do old timey song covers I-. Also the music sounds like the music at beginning of Up at some points

**chillbumps5** (6): man smashing pumpkins is such a good band

**aestheticen** (5): Not a bad song though, just not my type of music

**moonagenightmares** (4.5): ive tried so many times to stockholm myself into liking this but i just dont lol

**TragicKingdom1** (1): ive never heard this and i did not expect it to be a jazz standard. i did expect it to be listenable however

**CritneySpearz** (11): ended ur faves, iconic, groundbreaking, trend-setting, never been done before, shit on it, etc.

**1998tweety** (10): pop perfection

**anothertown** (10): the hardest song in this rate

**awhile2** (10): this will be the first song in popheads history to recieve a 10+ average

**bbfan132** (10): cher, queen of autotune

**dlong5665** (10): if any gays give this anything less than 10 istg

**fadedblue09** (10): Autotune queen

**HermionesBook** (10): iconic timeless hit. Cher really reinvented herself with this one

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ended ageism, invented auto tune

**ImADudeDuh** (10): hearing this right after sex and candy is like taking xanax and then after taking 3 shots of espresso at pride

**J\_Toe** (10): Honestly could have got my 11 but I already gave it to Britney in part 1. Why didn't the Vh1 list have this in the top 10?!?

**MrSwearword** (10): duh, it's Cher's four-hundreth comeback of course it slays

**plastichaxan** (10): i’m a 1998 gay this song gave birth to me

**ReallyCreative** (10): invented the concept of belief, major religions of the world simply couldn't

**rslashpoopheads** (10): An absolute meme and an absolute bop from an absolute legend.

**runaway3212** (10): Cher at her second best, still beating the competition.

**seanderlust** (10): "Meanwhile, the president of Warner Music UK, Rob Dickins, wanted Cher to “focus on her gay audience with a high-energy dance record.” " THIS ACCOUNT IS NOW A ROB DICKINS STAN ACCOUNT

**skargardin** (10): she snapped

**TiltControls** (10): invented modern technology. Yet another close 11 contender

**twat\_brained** (10): Look. Cher is an icon. You don't need me to say it, it's simply a fact. And without this song, it's an entire probability she wouldn't have become one. I desperately want BOMT to win but I can't complain if this wins instead.

**vapourlomo** (10): Robot Cher is the best Cher

**waluigiest** (10): not to be incredibly basic but this changed music

**wavingwolves** (10): need this to be a top 10 song thanks

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.5): odotoon

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): You cannot kill Cher! Cher will never die! She's as immortal as this song

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): Still hits so fucking hard. This song sat on my own damn face, and it wasn't busy!

**kappyko** (9): i was expecting to hate this but its good sorry

**MrMoodle** (9): (#17) i thought i hated this song and listened to it several hundred times before i realised i actually love this song

**sadshrub** (8.8): Big fucking fan

**splusten** (8): No

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.3): vocoder queen

**jsonphile** (7): I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry but I just don’t really get Cher. The song is fun enough but...it’s just fine. Maybe I’m too straight to appreciate Cher

**ManofOranges** (7): I begrudgingly like this song.

**RVA\_101** (6.4): It's just strange hearing Cher with autotune, but hey, good for her for keeping the hits coming even in the 90s.

**aestheticen** (5.5): Iconic and pioneered the use of Auto-Tune, but sadly I don't really like the song

**Mysario** (4): "The Iron Giant" was better at being a robot in this era than you and your voice, Cher

**moonagenightmares** (1): if i could give another 0 i would

**Roxieloxie** (1): Im convinced yall are lying to yourselves that this is a good song

**anothertown** (10): Blissful vibe

**bbfan132** (10): the sample makes this but biggie is great here as well

**DaniG08765** (10): it's weird that this is the Biggie song they picked, but Biggie is always a 10

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): throwback to the Kiss/Red/My Everything rate where half of yall said Break Your Heart Right Back sampled this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a song that samples a disco song that did better than every donna summer song

**ManofOranges** (10): The way my jaw hit the floor with the fact that this song samples "I'm Coming Out."

**MrSwearword** (10): B-I-G P-O-P-P-A

**runaway3212** (10): I just really love this.

**RVA\_101** (10): Yeah this is a classic. Everyone delivers on this song (yes, even Diddy). Mase, Diddy, and BIG spitting verses, Kelly Price singing the chorus, all against a Diana Ross sample with Nile Rodgers funk guitar? Yeah, classic hands down. A lot of people clowned the video as a flashy, bling-rap prototype with those shiny suits but the song itself is untouchable. Rest easy BIG. 'For an awesome tribute, go to YouTube and look up 'jay z mo money mo problems live' and click the first video. The WHOLE crowd raps BIG's verse. THAT'S impact.

**twat\_brained** (10): sod it. This gets a 10 from me; sampling “I’m Coming Out” practically guarantees a fantastic song and this is 100% proof of concept.

**vapourlomo** (10): The shiny suit era was fun as hell, idk if it's ~real hip-hop~ or whatever.

**wavingwolves** (10): ugh everything about this works so well i love it

**jsonphile** (9.5): y’all brought Diana Ross to number 3 in the disco rate you better not do this song dirty

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): an excellent use of a sample, excellent verses, excellent production, just excellence!

**1998tweety** (9): why does this sample I'm Coming Out i- its kinda iconic though

**HermionesBook** (9): love the sampling of “I’m coming out” by Diana Ross

**MrMoodle** (9): (#18)

**rickikardashian** (9): this is score comes mostly from my love of im coming out, but they were smart enough to sample this bop so yall cant blame me

**Roxieloxie** (9): the sample we-

**waluigiest** (9): that meme about layers of abstraction but it’s I’m Coming Out —> Mo Money Mo Problems —> Break Your Heart Right Back

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): classssic, sorry but ariana's live coachella version was a travesty and sacrilege

**seanderlust** (8.7): I was hoping that a song by B.I.G. that samples diana ross would deliver, and I was not let down!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the Diana Ross sample is a random choice but taste

**sadshrub** (8.5): The old scripture is wise

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): hi diana!

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I want mo problems!

**dlong5665** (6): this song doesn't have much going on beyond the sample

**Mysario** (6): not everyone giving this a 10 as revenge for "I'm Coming Out" for not winning the Disco rate

**J\_Toe** (5): gay anthem?

**skargardin** (5): I found myself paying attention to the Diana Ross sample more than anything tbh sfgjksg

**Roxieloxie** (10): I heard this for the first time in that fight scene in Captain Marvel and I thought it was fun, I added it to my playlist for a while. It has a slight 'white coming of age girl movie directed by greta gerwig' energy to it but I like it enough to ignore it

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Literally the best song in this whole rate.

**pearllouise** (8.5): The 90s saw the rise of many rappers putting their names on the map, but none of them could reach the success that the true GOAT of rap did: 2Pac. What made Tupac Shakur one of the greatest rappers of all time was not just his talent but his legacy. Even after he was fatally shot in a tragic drive-by shooting that became the top story on every entertainment magazine known to man, Tupac’s legacy still failed to become oblivious. That is what makes Tupac a rap music stable for many years to come.

---

**sadshrub** (11): If you disagree with me on this, you can suck the dingleberries out of my ass like boba and then choke on them

**seanderlust** (11): godDAMN this song is cool. didn't they record this like the day after Tupac got out of jail? what a way to celebrate your freedom

**anothertown** (10): 562 Stand Up!! 323 Stand Up!!

**dlong5665** (10): What a fucking classic

**HermionesBook** (10): this song is iconic and continues to be so catchy.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): as a californian, it is my duty to give this a 10. It also helps that its a mfing bop

**jsonphile** (10): So many great songs about California, but this is one of the best. I recently moved from California to Wisconsin, and there just aren’t as many great songs about Wisconsin

**ManofOranges** (10): Such an iconic hook

**MrSwearword** (10): duh, this doesn't get less than full marks

**Mysario** (10): VH1: "there are no repeated artists on this list" Dre: "Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West"

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Best rap song in this rate.

**splusten** (10): This song can make me forget that I'm an upper middle class white guy who lives on the East Coast

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the talkbox really hits

**twat\_brained** (10): No talkbox sample would ever sound this cool until Bruno Mars released 24K Magic. Also, I just discovered Hype Williams won a Video Vanguard Award in 2006, so I'm glad some things have turned out the way they were supposed to.

**vapourlomo** (10): Just a friendly reminder that 2Pac is actually from Baltimore! (but this song is still perfect)

**wavingwolves** (10): classic

**MrMoodle** (9.8): (#9)

**camerinian** (9.5): Since this beat is made up of like four different songs, I think that technically makes this plunderphonics. Can’t wait for the Dre X Avalanches collab

**ignitethephoenix** (9): classic

**ReallyCreative** (9): well-utilized vocoder is a quick path to my heart, and the verses are fire

**runaway3212** (9): Love this!

**RVA\_101** (8.5): That talkbox is straight up iconic. Classic Dre production, I can tell this is one of the inspirations for the San Andreas theme. G-funk at it again. RIP Pac.

**kappyko** (8): im overrating this a bit tbh. love roger's part

**kirby31200** (8): Uh we're not the Sunshine state, that's Florida

**rickikardashian** (8): im a slut for vocoder

**yourfacesucksass** (8): I can't believe they used this in SCOOB lmao

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes alright

**bbfan132** (7): it’s fun but the vocoder or whatever is being used throughout the song kind of irritates me

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Boring song if u aint from Cali lmao, the beat's not bad tho

**slimboyfriend** (6.7): in the year 2020 this vocoder effect now sounds ridiculous

**steelstepladder** (11): Look at me, being predictable. This feels like the most basic of basic opinions but this is genuinely one of the best songs ever made and I'm happy it was able to get top 5. It's good to know that even with how much of a mess some things went sometimes popheads gets things right

**pearllouise** (10): Let me introduce to you the godfather of teen angst Kurt Cobain. This song was definitely a grower for me. It definitely took a lot of rebellion and trips to the mall for me to get acquainted with this tune

---

**bbfan132** (11): thank you kathleen hanna

**jsonphile** (11): I know it’s cliche to say that this is the best song of the 90’s and Kurt Cobain is probably rolling over in his grave at me giving this an 11, but it’s just so damn good, with its raw explosive energy. No song says 90’s rock more than this one

**TragicKingdom1** (11): unironically like a top 10 most iconic rock era song of all time. truly don't understand anyone who gives this a low score

**vapourlomo** (11): Maybe the easiest and most painfully obvious 11 I've ever seen in a rate. Given that this is barely pop, I'll understand if it doesn't win...but if it doesn't make the top 5, whoooboy

**aestheticen** (10): Classic

**awhile2** (10): this song taught me what libido means. instant 10. also when i was a weird pre-teen i would listen to this song backwards all the time cause i thought it sounded cool

**camerinian** (10): weird to think about how the quintessential grunge track actually had so much more fucking life to it than 90% of the rest of its genre

**conceptualromance** (10): I have no idea what he’s saying but it fucks severely

**dlong5665** (10): im fine with never hearing it ever again in my life but its so undeniably iconic and great

**HermionesBook** (10): this song is really the definition of iconic to me. It is still extremely catchy today

**hunnybee12** (10): for the culture

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I’ve heard like 2 Nirvana songs ever and this is one of them and it definitely is a banger that encapsulates the 90’s when you think of music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): classic in every sense of the word.

**ManofOranges** (10): Very iconic song, I would feel bad giving it anything less than a 10

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): The hook, the guitar riff makes this song instantly recognisable and iconic. I first heard it from The Peep Show and haven't forgotten it since

**moonagenightmares** (10): if i could give another 11 it would be this <3

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is such a classic, but knowing the taste levels of popheads strikes fear into one’s heart over where this will place

**moooo566** (10): I literally flipped a coin for my 11, so sorry Nirvana

**MrMoodle** (10): (#2) when he said a mosquito my libido i rly felt that

**runaway3212** (10): this song is the best song in this rate, but I’m not giving it my 11 because it’s sung by a man.

**skargardin** (10): can't wait to see how robbed this will be :clown:

**splusten** (10): Pretty hot not gonna lie. For real though, how can you not give one of best songs from the most transformative 90's bands a ten.

**stryxen** (10): starting the rate with this is not fair to every other song

**twat\_brained** (10): I can’t argue with this being the best song of the ‘90s, nor do I have it in me

**wavingwolves** (10): this is one of the most iconic songs ever and i hope popheads treats it as such

**wholesomebody** (10): kurt snapped

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): Nirvana walked so 100 gecs could mosh

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): "No one knows what it means but it's provacative, it gets the people going"

**TiltControls** (9.2): easily the defining song of the 90's and for good reason

**kappyko** (9): this is a bop but i actually wasnt very into nevermind when i lsitened asides from territorial pissings

**kirby31200** (9): It's iconic, it's a classic, buuuuuut it's not my favorite Nirvana song

**ReallyCreative** (9): despite being one of the most iconic songs in this rate, there's almost no way this isn't going day 1

**selegend** (9): amazing how i can listen to this song and not process a single word

**u/astrologicalangel** (9): how have I never listened to this all the way through before?

**waluigiest** (9): I kinda wish I was a 90s teen and not a 90s toddler so I could have embodied this. Now I listen and think “wtf is he SAYING”

**rickikardashian** (8.5): i would like it more if it was a miley cyrus cover

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): When I had my green day phase, i briefly considered getting into nirvana but I never got past this song, but the song itself isnt bad so i'll give it a good score

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): Violet > Smells Like Teen Spirit

**J\_Toe** (8): not up r/popheads alley but every kid in a music class in year 8 at my high school had to learn this song

**Mysario** (8): this song is iconic and shook the world. But y'all really gonna look at main pop girl Kurt Cobain and say "well whatever, nevermind"

**RVA\_101** (7.5): Probably a bit overplayed and not my favorite Nirvana song (In Bloom fyi) by a longshot but can't deny its impact and importance in the decade's musical development

**1998tweety** (7): this is good but not really my thing

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Will always remind me of Moulin Rouge

**seanderlust** (6.2): hm. okay. I love nirvana, but like...you know how in "catcher in the rye" holden caulfield comes off as justified if you're a teenager and you're like "yeah, all the adults and other teens are just a bunch of phonies!!" but if you re-read it as an adult he just comes off as obnoxious and smug and self-righteous and lacking self awareness? very that. 5 and a half points because sonically it does slap though. this is the sonic equivalent of those "you laugh because i'm different, i laugh because you're all the same" hot topic t-shirts, and i do NOT mean that as a compliment.

**anothertown** (3): I hate Nirvana, Seattle sucks, etc

**rslashpoopheads** (3): The chorus is memorable I guess?

**MrSwearword** (1): for the number of uses it has, that being part of the legendary mashup Smells Like Bootylicious

**pearllouise** (10): Ginger, Scary, Posh, Baby, Sporty. The five young ladies that took the world by storm. What I love about the Spice Girls was how each girl had her own personality. Baby was the sweet and innocent one, Posh was the sexy lustful one that became every straight girl’s lady crush, Ginger was the redhead every other redhead could relate to, Scary was the cheetah bitch every girl wanted to embody, and Sporty was…..Sporty.

**steelstepladder** (6): I actually didn't realize this was SO well loved. I knew people liked it but top 3? and not far behind number two? Huh thats pretty high. I know this criticism sounds kind of hollow but its just a bit too chipper for me to throw my whole support behind it in a similar way to Mmmbop. Still, I can't deny it's icon status.

---

**agentofscranton** (11): genuinely the greatest thing that the uk has ever done for world history

**hikkaru** (11): not to be a basic pop girl bop stan but that was a classic...

**hunnybee12** (11): an undeniable good time

**Mysario** (11): idk if this deserves the 11 but Spice Girls (as well as iconic flick "Spice World") defined the pop era of the mid to late 90s pretty well, plus idk how you can listen to this and not really, really, really wanna zigazig ah

**selegend** (11): say you’ll be there is better but this is too iconic

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**HermionesBook** (10): POP PERFECTION

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic mega bop

**J\_Toe** (10): Posh is the only one to not get her own part if this song, and is relegated to a background character in the video, lol

**kappyko** (10): obvious winner tbh

**ManofOranges** (10): In my eyes, Mel B and Geri were the backbone of the Spice Girls and I will not change my opinion on that.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): Still can't forget The Boys and Butcher's monologue. As funny and iconic as the song itself

**ReallyCreative** (10): queens of creating supportive, healthy social networks where long-term friendship triumphs over potentially manipulative, short-term romance.

**Roxieloxie** (10): hey uh why was the black girl in the spice girls called the 'scary' spice

**rslashpoopheads** (10): A deserved rate frontrunner.

**runaway3212** (10): my introduction to this song was Chicken Little, literally the only good part of that movie

**skargardin** (10): a rare case of the spice girls' music that hasn't aged terribly

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - spice girls what can I say

**twat\_brained** (10): Geri is a snake for marrying C•••••••n H••••r but this slaps. This for me remains the girl group standard. Sidenote: ​STAN EMMA BUNTON

**vapourlomo** (10): The Spice Girls invented the late 90s. And for that, we should be thankful.

**RVA\_101** (8.1): The production is so tight. Love the guitar and piano here. Mel B kills it and I don't know the names of anyone else but they kill it too lmao

**pearllouise** (10): There is no denying how much of an impact Britney has had on pop music. From shaving her head and beating up a car with an umbrella to lipsyncing in front of 20,000 screaming fans asking for a refund, no one knows how to get the press talking like Britney.

**steelstepladder** (8.5): DEFEATED IS THE MONSTER! In all seriousness it was a wild ride and the lead changed places several times as the last few ballots came in. Honestly I do think this is better than Say My Name but man, we love to see an unexpected result. What can be said about this that

---

**anothertown** (11): Stops my heart dead in my fucking chest!

**HermionesBook** (11): giving my 11 to this timeless teen pop masterpiece

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this will probably win knowing popheads but it truly is an iconic pop song I can’t hate it one bit.

**J\_Toe** (11): Hit Number 1 in every country it charted in. Iconic.

**ManofOranges** (11): From those first three notes you already know this song is going to be a tour de force. There's not a thing I would change about this song.

**rickikardashian** (11): this song really had to be on this rate to expose me as a basic bitch ugh

**twat\_brained** (11): my bucket list is to perfect this song’s choreography and do it at karaoke. I think I manifested my destiny as a musician by repeating to myself that I was born the same year this released #freebritney

**valyse** (11): It was a toss-up, but I feel this is the truest answer for a pophead.

**yourfacesucksass** (11): forever my favorite song of all time. it represents such a pivotal era in my childhood (freaking age 5 lmao) but it's so innocent and bubblegummy of a song (thinking back to my 5 year old mindset ok!) that it perfectly encapsulates that moment of my life. i remember being into the song the moment i first heard it on the radio. i still remember exactly where i was- in the backseat of my mom's mercury villager sitting behind her. i'll never forget disney promoting the shit out of britney, like she performed baby one more time no less than three or four times broadcast all the way from walt disney world. growing up an hour away from kissimmee/orlando, it was like the magic and britney were right there. ok, back to being 26 and the covid is a bitch but i still love this song, this era, and britney. i always will.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop, godney always slays

**aestheticen** (10): Completely revolutionised pop music

**bbfan132** (10): the most predictable winner ever but a deserving one as well

**dlong5665** (10): the best chorus of any pop song ever

**kirby31200** (10): Honestly, did Britney peak early?

**MrSwearword** (10): we love quality pop debuts, yes we do

**ReallyCreative** (10): mygovernmentiskillingme.png

**runaway3212** (10): stil dying over the fact that ‘hit’ is supposed to mean text

**skargardin** (10): max martin's finest moment right here

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - the 2nd best debut single of all time

**wholesomebody** (10): i told my dad to buy this album for me so i could use "baby one more time" for some school project about music but I was actually just gay

**MrMoodle** (9.5): (#11) i really wanted to sabotage this, but i just don't have it in me. it's so fucking good. not like it'd make a difference anyway.

**stryxen** (9.5): I sing the chorus at least once every day it just does not leave the noggin

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song is how i knew i was gay, the music video is how i knew i was super gay.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): An actual cultural reset.

**vapourlomo** (9): This is going to win the rate, isn't it? There are definitely better songs here, but I can't get too mad at that

**waluigiest** (9): AND EYE

**wavingwolves** (9): praying this won't be the winner even if it's a great song

**sadshrub** (8.5): One of the best music videos ever shot in a porno studio

**splusten** (8.5): This one hits me right in the cervix and I'm not even sure what it means but I'll die on this hill.

**cremeebrulee** (8): i would hate it if this song won but not really bc it really is That Bitch lmaooo

**TragicKingdom1** (8): let anything but this win plz. its pretty good and obv iconic but probably not even a top 10 britney song

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.9): i get why it's considered so iconic but it's just never been one of my fav britney songs

**seanderlust** (7.9): this is THE 90s pop song. if you know a 90s american pop song, it's this one. that said, i think it's hard not to judge this without factoring in later songs of hers that were much better (toxic? oops? stronger?). this is to her what just dance was to gaga.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): good song and i will celebrate its inevitable win but there are better songs here

**hunnybee12** (7): oops I did it again is the improved version

**jsonphile** (7): this is probably blasphemy on this sub, but I never quite got into Britney Spears. Song’s alrigh

**kappyko** (7): i like it a lot but i prefer her 2000s stuff

**Mysario** (7): [covering the covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL5sEhSuuFE)

**RVA\_101** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of this song and I prefer her later output (best album is In The Zone imo) but one hell of a debut single. She launched straight into the stratosphere and never looked back.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): who

**fadedblue09** (2): And the lowest score I gave to a woman goes to…. For real though: I know this is a gay awakening for some of y'all, but to me this is just noise. And not a particularly good one at that. (I guess Everytime is the only Britney song my ears can tolerate).

**Roxieloxie** (0): Im sorry but every Britney single blends together in my head, If you had me at gunpoint and asked me to sing the chorus of this theres only a 30% chance i'd get it right. This one is probably one of my lest favorites from her, something about her enunciation simply dose not vibe with me

**pearllouise** (9): Except for Michelle

**steelstepladder** (8.5): We LOVE a dark horse winner! It actually was swapping back and forth with Baby One More Time over the last few scores and it was the final ballot that decided the results. With only one 11 Say My Name BARELY squeaks into first place with the third closest race in rate history. It was hard fought by everyone but while every other song in the top 5 had at least a few low scores, Say My Name coasted by with no scores under 5.

---

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I LOVE how much this instrumental is trying to pull of at once, and it actually manages to work. It's fantastic

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**aestheticen** (10): Classic

**anothertown** (10): Say those three words and I’m yours.. “Darkchild nine nine”

**bbfan132** (10): kind of overplayed but still a classic, beyonce snapped here

**dlong5665** (10): bey's adlibs at the end ugh

**HermionesBook** (10): another timeless song that i honestly think would be a smash if it were released today

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Hozier kingie

**J\_Toe** (10): oh my god thank you for showing me the version of this song without the weird skit at the end, why do Destiny Child's songs have weird acapella at the end of most tracks?

**kappyko** (10): darkchild na na.....

**ManofOranges** (10): Beyoncé?! Beyoncé?! Beyoncé?!

**MrMoodle** (10): (#3)

**MrSwearword** (10): quality music

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): you can hate bey all you want but goddamn that bitch can sing her ass off. and the rest of those girls are good too.

**ReallyCreative** (10): please don't rob this

**Roxieloxie** (10): Dare i say,,,, iconic. Also while we're here lets talk about how the only good cover of this song is somehow by hozier??

**runaway3212** (10): Queen Bey carrying even in the 90’s and still today. Iconic.

**selegend** (10): the way the spotify canvas cuts out farrah makes me scream

**skargardin** (10): at this point im starting to realise how STACKED the rate is holy shit

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - u better say her name or Solange will kick yo ass in an elevator

**twat\_brained** (10): u/junkygs why did you have to let Creep win?? This is infinitely more iconic

**wavingwolves** (10): we love the smooth bops of the late 90s

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.8): only issues are the third verse, which takes out the ambiguity of whether he's cheating, and the treble-heavy mixing

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): i know exactly what Beyoncé meant when she said this song sounded like a jungle

**conceptualromance** (9.5): The harmonies!

**yourfacesucksass** (9.2): still one of my favorite beyonce songs. i mean, at this point i'll just refer to it as a beyonce song. i will die on the hill of - this is the best destiny's child song, did i STUTTER?

**camerinian** (9): shit I guess this is technically a 90s song isn't it

**hunnybee12** (9): I didnt realize until rn how ‘beyonce and friends’ the line distribution is damn

**ignitethephoenix** (9): oh wait there is 4 destiny’s children at one point, and one of them wasn’t Michelle?

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): ICONIC!!

**Mysario** (9): Heisenburg

**vapourlomo** (9): GOD the production on this still sounds so fresh. Destiny's Child were so brilliant.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): i honestly always forget that Destiny's Child started in the 90s.

**RVA\_101** (8.4): I know they're from the 90s too but I really thought this specific single was from 2001. I'm a dumbass.

**splusten** (7.7): Say My Name references 'Shady', and 'My Name is' is also on this list. I see the connection. Too woke.

**seanderlust** (7.6): okay this is a jam but WHAT are those sound effects in the background of the pre-chorus???

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Probably their 7th best song or something.

**kirby31200** (5): It's fine, obviously great performances from the girls but nothing else of note

kirby31200: Did you guys like grow up with Say My Name? I don’t think I really knew it before the rate so I don’t have any nostalgia that would boost it for me. I just don’t get how it won, like I was kind of surprised it made it to day 4 I didn’t even know this was considered a top Destiny’s Child track

Awhile2: I was a baby when it was a hit but it’s one of those songs that’s never left the radio and it’s on a lot of my friends spotify playlists despite them also not being around when it was originally big. So I still have a decent amount of memories associated with the song

Songs

* Waterfalls and Genie in a Bottle have joined the 4+ rated club
* Say My Name is at #277 of the overall score totals and #86/100 on the rate winner score list
* Not tracked, but Rico Suave is the first 2-time rate loser song (Francesca is shaking)

Artists

* With this Beyonce now has 4 wins* (3 as solo / 1 as DC)! This ties her with Gaga, Kanye, and Britney (lol) for most rate wins!
