**steelstepladder** (10): I was so nervous for this on the last day of the rate. I got 30+ submissions at the end and this went from being in day 4 to falling hard all the way down to day 2 and barely crawling back into day 3. Out of the three white dudes rapping nonsense songs in the rate this is my favorite.

**pearllouise** (8): This song was originally supposed to take the top spot but Kanye felt as if it were best if Say My Name took it instead.

---

**bbfan132** (10): these lyrics make no sense lol, still love the quirky production and sampling

**dlong5665** (10): this is one of those "songs white people get turnt to" and yeah that's correct

**kappyko** (10): it was all downhill from here for poor beck. bc odelay scuked

**MrSwearword** (10): "soy un perdedor" marks the only time a white person in music used Spanish correctly or damn close to correctly

**awhile2** (9): beck is simultaneously the coolest and lamest person

**conceptualromance** (9): I really do enjoy this song

**cremeebrulee** (9): also on a list of cursed glee covers

**ImADudeDuh** (9): he’s singing about beyonce in 2014

**Mysario** (9): ha ha please :)

**splusten** (9): As someone who listened to Carly Rae Jepsen and watched Skins in High School, I can't relate to being a loser but I think I can sympathize.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): /u/Therokinrolla

**jsonphile** (8.5): same

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Beck sounds like he has a lot of ketchup stains on his t shirt here, but I like the guitar part

**ManofOranges** (8): I only know Beck for this song and that time he won Album of the Year and then Kanye got up.

**MrMoodle** (8): (#29)

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): it's no timebomb, but it's cute

**twat\_brained** (8): ah yes I too love the Butthole Surfers. Precisely none of whom practiced Scientology.

**vapourlomo** (8): A classic entrant in the "these lyrics are weird gibberish but the song slaps" pantheon, right next to MGMT's "Kids."

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): “i’m a loser baby so why don’t you kill me” very relatable lyric

**stryxen** (7.5): listening to this song should not make me feel cool. But it does :p shrug-emoji

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): this song foretold 2020, as in 2020 as a year is a loser.

**RVA\_101** (7): When Kanye almost joke-interrupted at the Grammys and said 'Beck needs to respect artistry and give the award to Beyonce', people said this clown probably doesn't even know who Beck is, but in fact he interpolates the chorus lyrics on The College Dropout on the song 'Get Em High ("My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her 'why don't you kill me'"). Checkmate. I still think Beck with his word salad lyrics is strange but the addictive hook makes up for it anyway.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): the way I just discovered this was a Beck song. Only knew this cause of glee before lol

**runaway3212** (6.5): I don’t really enjoy this one

**camerinian** (6): maybe if was cognisant for the 90s this would be different, but I’ve heard so many stream of consciousness indie songs in this vein and they do nothing for me, and this one only has a bit of a catchier chorus than most going for it

**kirby31200** (6): Yeah this isn't for me, which I kinda feel guilty about since I'm sure he influenced a lot of artists I like

**ggal2020** (5): alt rock radio core

**wavingwolves** (5): is this the worst thing ever? no. but is it any good? also no

**J\_Toe** (4): I feel like Beck is a big figure in music history, but I'm never gonna listen to him because he's a Scientologist.

**seanderlust** (3.8): end of the song: know what i'm saying? me: NO. NO I DON'T.

**1998tweety** (3): what is this garbaj

**ReallyCreative** (3): I understand this is a classic but it's genuinely just obnoxious

**skargardin** (3): I never knew that Beck did this, however that doesn't change the fact that i really dislike it

**anothertown** (2): Annoying!

**Roxieloxie** (1): Is this that dude who won aoty over beyonce??

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Um

**pearllouise** (8): Fuck them skinny bitches

**steelstepladder** (5): Man, I rated this pretty highly the other two times I've rated this but this time... I just can't. This rate has so many songs I hold near and dear to my heart but while this one has more than earned it's place in pop culture, I can't say I can justify giving it anything other than a mid score.

---

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE bop pls dont do this dirty

**ggal2020** (10): so many iconic moments on this song. they used famous samples and they became famous samples.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I feel if Lana del Rey listened to this, she would burst into flames

**kappyko** (10): GO WOMEN

**kirby31200** (10): A song so good and influential I'll ignore the stuff that didn't age so well

**ManofOranges** (10): If it weren't for this song, we never would have had Anaconda so Sir Mix-a-Lot really deserves to be knighted for his work here. But also, there's just so much iconic material coming from this song. I'm having a blast.

**MrSwearword** (10): this song passes the Bechdel test

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It was a bit of a trip hearing simps in a song from the 90's, I thought it was a word that only came around now :|

**rickikardashian** (10): is taking everything in me to not give this an unironic 11

**runaway3212** (10): Hot take, Anaconda took this song from a 10 to an 11.

**skargardin** (10): I have seen the light since the songs of the summer rate last year, where I scored this a 3... this is truly a massive undeniable BOPP

**vapourlomo** (10): The pinnacle of Seattle hip-hop (yes, that doesn't mean much, but let Mix-a-Lot have this okay)

**conceptualromance** (9): misogyny won this round

**dlong5665** (9): literally who doesn't love this song

**ignitethephoenix** (9): butts are universal so every man and woman better appreciate this song!

**ReallyCreative** (9): invented butts, invented not lying

**waluigiest** (9): cancel me if you want but this has been a banger since it came out. Cultural reset whether you’re ready to admit it or not

**GhostCamo** (8.8): I was in junior high and this song was played everywhere. School dance, the cowboys, the Mexicans, the Preps, and even the teachers liked this song.

**camerinian** (8.5): wait "simp" isn't a new thing???? I've heard this song dozens of times and never noticed he called out the simps, holy shit

**HermionesBook** (8.5): ICONIC song. Who can forget that “oh my god becky” intro?

**awhile2** (8): this was the most hilarious song to elementary school aged me

**Roxieloxie** (8): " we cant let the children listen to wap its too vugular'

**splusten** (7.8): She do.

**RVA\_101** (7.1): I don't know a single word past 'sprung' but you bet I'll rap every word up to that point enthusiastically. Because hey, where's the lie. Video intro skit is practically part of the song as far as I'm concerned.

**anothertown** (7): it is insane how Rick Rubin managed to make such a bop out of this, but at the same time the fact that this is the highest hip-hop song on VH1’s list is pure clownery

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): We love a misogynistic banger <3

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Kind of boring but look at her butt!

**TiltControls** (7): it's fun and that's all i'll say

**twat\_brained** (7): very funky but it’s just dad rap at this point to me

**MrMoodle** (6.5): (#60) that opening rant with all of the dogwhistley shit before the "she's just so... black!" comes out. baby got back predicted r/popheads.

**wavingwolves** (6.5): sorry but i don't hate this and maybe that's because of how much i love anaconda

**seanderlust** (6.1): put some respect on jane fonda's name.

**jsonphile** (6): really dumb but just the right amount of stupid humor to be enjoyable

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): erm so anyways...

**Mysario** (6): shake that healthy butt

**sadshrub** (6): One small step for Sir. One giant leap for booty awareness.

**CreepyMannequin** (5): Anaconda outsold

**CritneySpearz** (5): ended fat shaming w0w

**J\_Toe** (5): I wonder if r/popheads will rate this highly because of Anaconda, or if they will penalise it for being heterosexual

**plastichaxan** (5): anaconda outsold but at least it’s not the glee version

**RainbowWhale101** (5): I hate that I had to listen to a whole four minutes of this

**bbfan132** (1): anaconda >>>> this shit

**chillbumps5** (0): i'm tired of these mtherf-in baby got backs in these mtherf-in rates

**pearllouise** (5): Wow, even in the 90s Will Smith sounded like a middle-aged man

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**ManofOranges** (10): The first thing I think about whenever I hear this song is the trigonometry version, "Gettin Triggy Wit It," which I had to watch in geometry class.

**Roxieloxie** (10): wi-will smith??? like West Philadelphia born and raised on the playground where I spent most of my days will smith??? why dose this kinda bang??? i have so many questions

**twat\_brained** (9.3): honestly I would’ve preferred this to win the choreo VMA over Ray of Light. Hype Williams is absolutely a hypebeast, however. That said, I’m not pleased to see all the R. Kelly videos in his catalog.

**Mysario** (9): HA HA WOOOO

**ReallyCreative** (9): iconic

**rslashpoopheads** (9): The guitar riff seriously slaps.

**runaway3212** (9): I always loved this song, but I never knew it was by Will Smith

**yourfacesucksass** (9): I will never not love this song, I don't care what people say about Will as a musician lmao

**seanderlust** (8.9): men in black came out the same year as this song...will smith STAYED winning in 1997

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): i had no idea will smith made an album and this is actually a bop so kudos

**dlong5665** (8): that sample is so good that it actually makes will smith seem cool

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this slaps ngl. The children’s nahs are kind of annoying tho

**ImADudeDuh** (8): He’s The Greatest Dancer >>>>

**kappyko** (8): much better than the avalanches song that samples the same nanananana.

**MrSwearword** (8): it's not that I'm too good for this, it's just weak against the field

**skargardin** (8): bop

**vapourlomo** (8): HAH HAH! WHAT! WHAT! WOO!

**MrMoodle** (7.5): (#38) underrated, effortlessly catchy pop rap, if will smith didn't make this everyone would love it

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I'd rather be listening to The Greatest Dancer without these vocals on it tho

**wavingwolves** (7.5): where's the new album @ will smith

**jsonphile** (7): great sample, and Will Smith is just fun

**RVA\_101** (7): I really wish this dude would rhyme again, it's laid back, not-serious shit but he does it well. The beat is so smooth with the clavinet groove.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): will smith sucks sorry

**bbfan132** (6): it’s only this high because of the sample, i love sister sledge!

**kirby31200** (6): No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Hate the chorus, like everything else

**J\_Toe** (5): doesn't swear in songs

**splusten** (3.5): We don't always have to though, Will.

**pearllouise** (8): The amount of songs I have heard in my life that has had the word “jump” in the title never ends, but this one cannot be compared. I can just picture being 13 at a Kriss Kross concert living my best part. Concerts, oh how we miss you.

**steelstepladder** (4): I thought I liked this song more than I did. Honestly the majority of this song is still really good but... there's something I can only describe as a deflating balloon sound on the chorus and I hate it. It really makes the song way worse than I want it too.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): doing this on just dance 2 was more tiring than Rasputin teabh

**Roxieloxie** (10): KRIS KROSS WILL MAKE YA

**runaway3212** (10): let’s goooooooo

**twat\_brained** (10): I can’t believe Daddy Mac is no longer with us; the fact that these were literal teens making an all-time classic hip-hop song just blows my mind, but then I remember who I gave my 11 to 🤭

**ignitethephoenix** (9): my chemistry teacher in hs used to pump this song in class

**sandyfishnets** (9): they were 13 year olds when they recorded this??? WTF

**vapourlomo** (9): This goes way harder than any rap song featuring literal children should

**bbfan132** (8.5): ngl this is a total bop

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): This hook is so good.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): this is so energetic and interesting... it makes me want to listen to it again immediately after the songs finishes

**hunnybee12** (8): we jumping and popping we jopping

**jsonphile** (8): if I had a nickel for every song on this list that repeatedly told me to jump jump jump I’d have two nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice

**kirby31200** (8): Better than House of Pain tbh

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): banger

**MrSwearword** (8): I mean it's fine...but I don't care about this song much

**plastichaxan** (8): fun

**skargardin** (8): bop

**camerinian** (7): wtf their flows are actually fucking sick

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): It took way too long for me to realize that they're children.... and also it's not that bad

**dlong5665** (6): the clothes were more iconic than the song but it's still a cute little track

**ManofOranges** (6): What good is jumping if it's not around?

**MrMoodle** (6): (#64) this is good actually, i just don't like children

**TiltControls** (5.5): iconic, but also a little annoying after hearing it in so many places

**J\_Toe** (5): I'm guessing this, or the earlier song, was a sample? I've already heard this today

**splusten** (4): I ran out of energy after the first jump themed song.

**steelstepladder** (9): It made day 3 somehow! People don't like metal and understandably so but this slaps. It slaps so god damn hard and does exactly what it sets out to do. Great stuff all around.

**pearllouise** (7): The amount of lung control it takes to sing heavy metal is intense.

---

**MrMoodle** (10): (#6)

**MrSwearword** (10): the one time Metallica did something cool before they bitched about Napster

**Mysario** (10): this is the closest we'll get to heavy metal in a popheads rate so on principle it gets a 10

**ReallyCreative** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhWP__g-_c

**runaway3212** (10): Metallica is just so great

**selegend** (10): oh wow this bops

**skargardin** (10): one of the most legendaric rock songs dont you DARE rob this

**splusten** (10): Go Hokies

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - maybe the best heavy metal track of all time

**twat\_brained** (10): what… the… fuck… is James's mustache in this video. Also, why did they rip off Halsey's "Nightmare"? >:((((( /s this song kicks ass boomers are right about Metallica in the '90s

**vapourlomo** (10): Call me a basic bro, but this always gets me SO HYPED. Easily a top-5 jock jam.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Maybe metal wasn't so bad after all

**aestheticen** (9): Nice guitar

**conceptualromance** (9): This song is really cool; I don’t think I’ve ever listened to it before

**jsonphile** (9): that bridge is perfectly spooky

**kirby31200** (9): It's obviously a great song but there's Metallica songs I like more

**rslashpoopheads** (9): A bopalina.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): this is gonna get robbed

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): the inner dad in me is rocking

**1998tweety** (8.5): why do i kinda like this

**engifear** (8.5): Popheads better not do this dirty

**seanderlust** (8.4): to the Genius user who said they will sing this as a lullaby to their kids - please don't.

**ManofOranges** (8): I know this song is probably too straight for this sub to fully enjoy but I did go through a phase where I was like "Rock music is best music" and in a way this song somehow brings back old memories.

**waluigiest** (8): I tried to like Metallica when I was in 7th grade because I had a crush on a goth girl lol

**wavingwolves** (8): i feel it in my bones the way this will be a day 1 song

**bbfan132** (7): a technically good song but it doesn’t do a lot for me

**camerinian** (7): just gonna throw out a preemptive “lmao” to the placing and comments on this one

**ImADudeDuh** (7): dreams of dragon’s fire, and of baked apple pieee

**RVA\_101** (6.7): Forgive me, but I really am just not a fan of metal at the moment. It's the last major genre I'm yet to have a breakthrough with (country [and I don't mean just a select few songs like Jolene] finally clicked with me last year), but metal I just haven't come around to. I do sort of like this song, the riff is iconic of course, and I know this is definitely a sports stadium staple, but the song (and genre as a whole) just felt like a chore to get through. I just haven't come around to it. I can respect the weedle-eedle-ee ultra-distorted guitar pyrotechnics but I'm just not that big on it. But one day it'll click I just know it.

**slimboyfriend** (6.6): I was expecting this to be a lot heavier :/

**TiltControls** (6.5): i love the intro... and that's about it. Metallica is just not my kind of music (except turn the page)

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.4): i remember being obsessed with this song when i was younger but it’s not as good as i remember so...mess. that guitar still goes hard though

**nootnoot781** (6): not my first time listening to metallica being during this rate.

**Roxieloxie** (6): im sorry but this is so long

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): stop yelling at me

**TragicKingdom1** (3): im gay

**anothertown** (2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xec7JPn2pGc

**dlong5665** (2): metallica sucks you guys

**stryxen** (2): sorry lol :p not for me :p

**kappyko** (1): the hook is the closest this gets to being good and i could just listen to nine inch nails' heresy for that with way cooler lyrics.

kirby31200: I know this is a pop music subreddit and all but I really did expect to see more casual metal fans or at least just Metallica fans, a lot of the comments sound so surprised or ambivalent or just against metal as a whole.

Like did no one else’s parents have them listen to Metallica growing up? This song was like ingrained into me as a child

**pearllouise** (7): It’s crazy how all the members of Weezer can just randomly walk into a CVS and not be recognized.

**steelstepladder** (5): People REALLY wanted this out day 2 and I don't really get that? I think Weezer has made some crap over the past few years but Buddy Holly is just too wholesome. I think it's placement is more than fine even if the song is a bit underwhelming compared to a lot of the heavyweights in the rate.

---

**bbfan132** (10): if only weezer still made music that was as good as this is….

**ManofOranges** (10): Weeeooo

**Mysario** (10): WHAT'S WITH THESE HOMIES DISSIN MY GIRL

**slimboyfriend** (10): a true banger for the nerds of the world

**TragicKingdom1** (10): nerdy and cheesy but absolutely euphoric

**vapourlomo** (10): The best '90s song about the '70s' nostalgia for the '50s. Also, The Blue Album might secretly be the best album of the decade

**ImADudeDuh** (9.1): we love nerds

**camerinian** (9): Don't be fooled by this score, it was, is and will always be Fuck Weezer Season

**runaway3212** (9): Very great!

**yourfacesucksass** (8.9): The song and video, ugh, epic.

**jsonphile** (8.5): SNL’s sketch about Weezer is one of the best they’ve ever done

**rickikardashian** (8.5): look im not a misogynist but this song is p good

**twat\_brained** (8.5): never actually heard this. Maybe Weezer was as decent as they were purported to be.

**kirby31200** (8): Say It Ain't So deserved the spot more

**u/astrologicalangel** (8): the 90s and bridges that save the entire song, name a more iconic duo

**seanderlust** (7.8): file under: songs that get white millennials who missed the point of 500 days of summer LIT

**awhile2** (7): worst song on blue album tbh

**dlong5665** (7): I think it's probably one of the weaker tracks from the blue album but that says more to the strength of that album than anything else

**ignitethephoenix** (7): never fully got weezer

**MrSwearword** (7): aww back when Weezer didn't require paragraphs of context for someone to like them

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): needs more ooh oohs

**MrMoodle** (6.5): (#56) when i was in high school all of my friends were obsessed with weezer and i still don't understand if it was a joke or not

**RVA\_101** (6.2): I'll just say it, I never got into Weezer as so many others have. I have heard this song before, it's just nothing great for me

**letsallpoo** (6): i dont trust anyone who passionately likes weezer

**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): An MV set in Kenosha...with an all white cast....it's all coming together now.......

**Roxieloxie** (5): oh weezer is a real band, i thought it was a reddit hivemind

**skargardin** (5): meh

**1998tweety** (4): this aint good

**static\_int\_husp** (4): i won't say that Weezer flat out sucks, but i will say there is no way this is the best song they made in the 90s

**CritneySpearz** (3): it’s a no

**anothertown** (1): this embarrassing and racist band

**wavingwolves** (0): this is a 2min song that seems like it goes on for 10min

**steelstepladder** (9): Some intense rhcp hate in these comments. For some of their songs I get it but Under the Bridge is special. It's emotive and sympathetic in a way that I genuinely don't get some of the hate. This was another song that was day 4 for a while before it started falling hard during the final day and I honestly would have loved to see it.

**pearllouise** (6.5): If you are old enough to remember this RHCP jam, I bet you probably had your nipple pierced and worked at Zumiez.

---

**stryxen** (11): oh em gee a bit of warning would be nice. This song is something special

**bbfan132** (10): i LOVED this when i was younger and it kind of grew off me but i’m liking it more and more again as i’m getting older

**ImADudeDuh** (10): as a californian, it is my duty to give this a 10. Also, it helps that it’s a fucking ballop.

**ManofOranges** (10): I finally know the name to this damn song

**MrSwearword** (10): great songwriting, singing and Anthony Kiedis is hot, leave me alone

**RVA\_101** (10): A 10 just off John Frusciante's guitar alone. So happy he's back with the Peppers Everything else is just a cherry on top. Fantastic writing by Kiedis and love that Flea plays tastefully and subtedly, it stands out actually as a result knowing how Flea usually plays.

**sadshrub** (10): Put that bass in my fucking veins

**TiltControls** (10): I know most popheads have a fear of ballads, but RHCP's softer tracks are some of the best music they've released

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i really love RHCP's aesthetic and sound and this is their best demonstration of it

**jsonphile** (9.5): the outro with the choir is just amazing

**ggal2020** (9): RHCP is better than Nirvana, change my mind

**ReallyCreative** (9): Yo the chilis? I saw them in concert like 50 times

**vapourlomo** (9): RHCP isn't a great band. But...Under The Bridge is a great power ballad.

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): there was a phase in time when on myspace i was all about the up-and-coming new punk pop acts, and my profile song (until they let you have more than one) was either something new or something from when i was younger, and you will not believe the audacity of this bitch putting it as his profile song in the year 2008 like i was some hot-shot californian. who was i trying to impress? w h o ?

**anothertown** (8): I have literally no personal attachment to RHCP but I feel such nostalgia when I hear them, fuck this

**kirby31200** (8): Give it an 8 give it an 8 give it an 8 now

**u/astrologicalangel** (8): fittingly, the bridge is the best part of this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel like the ending could have had a stronger kick

**MrMoodle** (7.5): (#35) these guys irrationally annoy me, i know nothing about them but i feel angry every time i see their stupid fucking faces. but this is still really good

**J\_Toe** (7): oh cool, I've always known this hook, but I never knew what song it was from

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I HATE the Red Hot Chili Peppers!

**skargardin** (7): maybe some points were made

**twat\_brained** (6.5): technically, Californication was released in 1999 on the titular album, however that level of semantics would result in something like "Butterfly" ending up on this list. Tbh, "Butterfly" has loads more replay value than like 1/3rd of this list so why not

**aestheticen** (6): The second half saved this song

**camerinian** (6): This would be a 10/10 classic alt ballad If only the Chillis had a less unbearably shit lead singer

**Mysario** (6): as long as it's not under the bridge of the Charles River

**wavingwolves** (5): one of the best rhcp songs but still not a good song

**seanderlust** (4.6): Shut up about Los Angeles! Shut up about Los Angeles!

**dlong5665** (4): meh ive never cared for rhcp

**runaway3212** (3): everyone giving this higher than a 5.5 will go to the bad place.

**kappyko** (2): dani california >>>> this. cry abt it nerds !!!!!

**pearllouise** (7): Shania invented gayness when she first put out her TERF bop “Man, I Feel Like A Woman”. Her other hit that people seem to forget that was more popular than the one I just mentioned is another reason why the gays love her (even though the song serves “straight country couple who just got married” energy).

---

**1998tweety** (10): the greatest woman to have ever lived

**aestheticen** (10): This song makes me want to run around in a patch of flowers and just forget about life

**hunnybee12** (10): thank you harry styles and kacey musgraves

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I saw a comment on popheads that idk if it’s true or not but it said that this song only peaked at #2 because they didn’t make enough copies of the singles and they got sold out before they were able to make more and because of those lost sales, it didn’t hit #1 and i really hate that for her

**ManofOranges** (10): Another iconic one.

**MrSwearword** (10): the 2nd best Shania song in existence, but a classic if you don't remember that this is about Mutt who proceeded to fuck Shania's best friend.

**runaway3212** (10): I can’t get over how great this song is

**TiltControls** (10): uggggh. wish i could give another 11 this deserves it! One of my favourites of hers, was robbed of top 5 in her rate

**wavingwolves** (10): oh look another day 4 song that won't make to day 4

**CritneySpearz** (9): even 10 year old me thought this song was cute af

**Mysario** (9): Canadian Queen until Carly came for the crown

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's not the best from Ms. Twain but it's a phenomenal country ballad

**rickikardashian** (9): im fine with this but man i feel like a woman is like 10 times better

**rslashpoopheads** (9): A yeehaw classic!

**bbfan132** (8.5): a sweet and mellow song… unfortunately her then-husband cheated on her with her best friend so i kind of look at this differently now

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): out of all shania songs im ehh about the fact they chose this one. A classic and major hit for sure, but man I feel like a women and that don’t impress me much I love so much more

**seanderlust** (8): it's good, but why is this the shania song they chose? was this an important song in the 90s or something? Man! I Feel Like A Woman is right there lol

**twat\_brained** (7.7): when I think of “Shania” and “greatest” in the same sentence, I think “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” like any sane music geek would. What dumbass at VH1 made the mistake of thinking otherwise?

**slimboyfriend** (7.6): I don't remember this sensual intro

**camerinian** (7): OK, so you chose the acoustic ballad as the Shania representative? That don’t impr-

**RVA\_101** (7): I prefer the other Shania Twain song from that previous rate, 'That Don't Impress Me Much'. I still like it though. Like many other songs, I didn't recognize this one until the chorus kicked in.

**skargardin** (7): cute

**vapourlomo** (7): It's solid! Can't go wrong with Shania! But I'm quite confused why "Man! I Feel Like A Woman!" wasn't the pick, VH1...

**MrMoodle** (6.7): (#52)

**kirby31200** (6): Should've chosen That Don't Impress Me Much

**moonagenightmares** (5.3): i imagine this being the theme song of some horse girl tv show

**anothertown** (5): They could have picked a better Shania song

**J\_Toe** (5): Sorry Shania, I would have rated Man I Feel Like a Woman higher :(

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): i don’t care. just get over him

**Roxieloxie** (3): its not for me sorry

**sandyfishnets** (0): this is too cheesy for me

**pearllouise** (9): I didn’t realize until this rate how much of a girl crush I have on Sheryl Crow.

**steelstepladder** (6): I'm a fan of Mrs. Crow but I don't think this is the best display of her talents. If it makes you happy is an 11 though.

---

**bbfan132** (10): she’s kind of basic but this is a fun/quirky jam so i need to give her a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): nothing makes me feel more like a white girl without cares in the world

**MrSwearword** (10): we love quality Sheryl Crow yes we do

**twat\_brained** (10): Between this, If It Makes You Happy and Soak Up The Sun, Sheryl's got a pretty decent back catalog which I think deserves to be rated in 2021.

**TiltControls** (9.2): It's a lot of fun, and sometimes that's all you need from a song

**DaniG08765** (9): how many songs mention car washes?

**ManofOranges** (9): You know this song is gonna get far because she mentions disco at the beginning.

**ReallyCreative** (9): "this ain't no disco" /r/popheads has left the chat

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Same.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): sheryl crow is a very weird figure in pop music history. this song is the most interesting thing she's done

**sadshrub** (8.7): Still randomly sing this to myself

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): ahead of her time

**Mysario** (8): I've never understood why this song was always more popular than "Soak Up the Sun" but whatever, I love it

**rickikardashian** (8): i feel like im sitting with my homegirl having a good kiki

**vapourlomo** (8): Probably Sheryl's second-best song, right behind that jam from the Cars soundtrack. Love the rambly vibes

**waluigiest** (8): honestly it’s fiona Apple but rooted a bit more in convention

**yourfacesucksass** (8): I guess I am the lone Sheryl Crow stan. I get it, it's hard to classify her. Is she country, alternative, rock, contemporary, trivago?

**RVA\_101** (7.5): I do dig this one. Breezy country-pop production (she says LA, but you're not fooling me with those pedal steel/lap-steel? guitars).

**dlong5665** (7): Ms crow is fun when she's not making music with Kd Rck

**kirby31200** (7): I have confused Shania Twain and Sheryl Crow my entire life, and I will continue to

**runaway3212** (7): “This aint no disco”, does Sheryl Crow secretly hate r/popheads?

**seanderlust** (7): man people were really into LA in the nineties, huh?

**skargardin** (7): cute moment

**anothertown** (6): I'm just mad this isn't "If It Makes You Happy"

**MrMoodle** (5.9): (#68)

**HermionesBook** (5): she has better songs, I would’ve included “if it makes you happy” instead

**conceptualromance** (3): possibly my least favorite Sheryl Crow song

**wavingwolves** (3): the verses of this don't flow at all and don't go with the instrumental...

**camerinian** (0): I’ve always had a weird kneejerk reaction to this song ever since I was young, and back then it was probably just cos it was a country-ish song and I was stupid, but now I just really hate the cheeryness that seems either incredibly forced or entirely at the expense of everyone else in a really judgemental way. I know Sheryl took most of this song from a poem, but inserting this airheaded upbeat chorus into this story of other people and the minutia of the mundanity of their lives seems really fucking judgemental, and I know I’m way overthinking this but I’m trying to rationalise a song that never sat right with me for the first time.

**pearllouise** (7): That electric guitar solo cured both my ache and depression

---

**agentofscranton** (10): EAT THE RICH!!!

**bbfan132** (10): i love how it starts off normally and then progressively gets more manic and energetic, it feels very cathartic

**camerinian** (10): If this was in the proper rate, it'd be an easy 11 contender. I adore every single element of this song. I love the simplicity of the melody that is simultaneously brain-meltingly catchy but also not so distracting that it draws away from the brilliantly smart narrative that catches so many incredibly evocative little details while not diluting the wider, unfortunately-still relevant message about class tourism. Every line of this is quotable, smart, sticky, and it's all wrapped in an incredibly populist arena-sized anthem. This might be one of the best songs ever written, and fuck this yank-centric list for not giving it any shine.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is one is a wild ride but I enjoyed every second!

**RainbowWhale101** (10): YES to 90s britpop! I absolutely LOVED this song it made me so happy I'm going to add it to a spotify playlist

**skargardin** (10): BANGER

**splusten** (10): If I could give this an 11 on God I would

**vapourlomo** (10): The best song from the 1990s' best musical movement (Britpop). Full stop. It's both a searing critique of the wealthy AND an irresistible synthpop banger.

**wavingwolves** (10): eat the rich

**wholesomebody** (10): repeat it poor

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i didn’t like this at first but it really snapped on the back half

**seanderlust** (9): oooooooh i love that bridge.

**slimboyfriend** (9): This one goes out to all the rich people I went to college with who pretended to be poor for four years and then got a job by using their parents connections and now live in a downtown loft in NYC/LA

**chillbumps5** (8.5): tonight, tonight slaps

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): sounds kinda Bowie-esque

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): the my chemical romance cover is superior, sorry :/

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): This is so sad!

**kirby31200** (7): I think I admire the song more than I like it

**Mysario** (6): lyrically this song is great but otherwise this can pass out with the common songs

**MrSwearword** (5): weird but not stellar

**pearllouise** (8): Anyone else singing this song once this sucky year ends?

**steelstepladder** (4): Out of the two acoustic heavyweights this is my favorite of the two but... Idk Dookie really was that bitch and a ballad from Green Day feels like one of the worst cases of wrong song choice in this rate.

---

**1998tweety** (10): ugh i love this song, i remember at my elementary school on the last day of school they would have the seniors sing either this or Graduation by Vitamin C, and I just remember weeping my last year cause it was the year i moved away from all my friends

**agentofscranton** (10): i was always led to believe that this would be played at our graduation but then i remembered I'm british and we don't do anything fun here. my friend tripped and ate shit on the way to collect his diploma tho so that's something.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): yes ma’am

**J\_Toe** (10): as a late 90s baby, I only heard about Green Day after they "sold out" so never had any issue about their reputation. I love this song. Watch Lindsay Ellis' video essay on Green Day as 2000s Protest Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehbgAGlrVKE

**MrSwearword** (10): don't let Windows Movie Maker videos involving high school graduations fool you, this song slays because it's such an effective FUCK YOU song.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Everyone had this play at their elementary school/middle school graduation yeah?

**Roxieloxie** (10): I've been shitting on every 'white man with a guitar' song in this rate but I did actually have a green day phase and nimrod was one of the 4 albums I ended up listening. Plus unlike all the other songs in this rate it's short enough and dosent overstay its welcome

**runaway3212** (10): I feel like we never talked enough about how bad Father of All was, especially compared to all their other work.

**TiltControls** (10): this song and Vitamin C's graduation (also a great song) are the leading cause of elementary/middle/high school graduation slideshows

**seanderlust** (9.5): I have no idea how popheads will generally rate this song but I honestly love it. it walks that perfect line of being nostalgic with a twinge of sadness without being too corny.

**kappyko** (9): this is gorgeous

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): this song makes me cry due to memories related to it and now it sucks to listen to ugh

**MrMoodle** (8.5): (#25) dammit i was hoping for a shit green day song so i could make a zinger about keeping my swedish producers but this just makes me feel all sentimental

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): These lyrics are so nonspecific that they could be about literally ANYTHING

**jsonphile** (8): should’ve definitely gone with Basket Case for this list (would’ve given it a 9.5), but I do like this song, despite how overplayed it is at graduations and other such events

**wavingwolves** (8): it's cheesy but in a very charming way

**yourfacesucksass** (8): i mean it's super cheesy is it not, but i guess it's their warm and touching hit so i'll let it pass.

**twat\_brained** (7.7): very sentimental but if we have a Green Day song why can’t it be Basket Case?

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): So memorable yet so forgettable.

**camerinian** (7): Absolutely livid that this is the Green Day song VH1 went with. Sure, take the most influential and lively pop punk group of the era and use their fucking acoustic ballad as the representative when this stupid list is already dripping in boring acoustic bullshit. I still like the song but VH1 really fucked this, especially since there's next to no other pop punk, and especially since Basket Case, She, Brain Stew, Hitching a Ride, Welcome to Paradise, WHEN I COME AROUND????? THESE WERE ALL FREE GUYS HELLO

**kirby31200** (7): Was this really the best Green Day song for the list? Couldn't have they put like Welcome to Paradise or Basket Case or When I Come Around

**ManofOranges** (7): Part of me wanted to instinctively give this a 10 because I used to be obsessed with Green Day for a good part of my life, but I just can't do it! I don't love this song THAT much.

**Mysario** (7): pour one out for all the homies who had this play and/or mentioned at any of their graduations

**RVA\_101** (6.7): Lol the music video omits the fuck up at the beginning. That's half of the fun. I never realized how short this song was.

**vapourlomo** (6): Too many graduation slideshows have ruined this one for me, sorry. But I would've given a 9 to any of the Dookie singles.

**bbfan132** (5): the soundtrack to every graduation video i had to watch while i was in grade school

**skargardin** (5): um well, that happened

**dlong5665** (4): whatever

**moonagenightmares** (3.5): the best part of the song was when he wasnt singing

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): yawn. god people in the 90s really had the worst taste in music huh

**valyse** (2): Undeniably important to The Culture but I would love to never hear this song ever again.

**anothertown** (1): this has to be their worst song and they came out with 1000 better songs in the 90s.. :12 year old me who was a stan pops out to make this comment:

**ReallyCreative** (1): this song pisses me off, it's so fucking stupid, it's like Closing Time but for mall goths in toxic on-off relationships, if Closing Time wasn't an iconic classic

**pearllouise** (7.5): Shoutout to all the white girls with guitars who played this at their school’s talent show.

**steelstepladder** (2): Y'all planned this didn't you? The two acoustic ballads going out back to back just feels right. The issue is that this might be the worst case of wrong song choice in the rate. Champaign Supernova blows Wonderwall out of the water and I'm just kind of tired of it by this point. Overplay really did kill this one for me more than any other song in the rate if I'm being honest.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Anyway here's wonderwall

**agentofscranton** (10): look. i know his voice is grating. i know unbearable white boys with guitars have sorta tainted it. but i can't deny how i feel. i'm sorry. please forgive me.

**bbfan132** (10): a classic karaoke anthem but the gallaghers are too obnoxious for them to do well here

**HermionesBook** (10): this song is timeless to me

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its a bop

**kappyko** (10): whats the story morning glory deserves a rate

**vapourlomo** (10): Forget those annoying dudes with the acoustic guitars at frat parties. The original is still untouchable (as is the entirety of Oasis' first two albums).

**chillbumps5** (9): sunshEEEEEEIIIIIINNNNEEE

**conceptualromance** (9): anyway,

**DaniG08765** (9): the fact that this is so low betrays intense anti UK bias from VHI

**dlong5665** (9): its annoying how good this song actually is

**ignitethephoenix** (9): anyway here is wonderwall

**J\_Toe** (9): https://www.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/comments/5a4tgu/when_your_sister_gets_all_possessed/

**Mysario** (9): anyways here's a good joke

**selegend** (9): easily iconic but the tiktok white boys sing this better i’m not gonna lie

**slimboyfriend** (9): why did I think this was a Green Day song before I heard the vocals

**twat\_brained** (9): I fucking hate Oasis and the Gallagher brothers but it’s hard not to like this

**valyse** (9): Our generation’s Free Bird.

**u/astrologicalangel** (8.5): there’s a reason this is their most played song

**sadshrub** (8.3): Call me simple, but I do really like the guitar

**brenda\_official** (8): kinda annoying but i like it because it reminds me of mommy (2014)

**camerinian** (8): can I just point out how existentially bizarre it is trying to take something with the weight of 25 years of cultural saturation, backlash, revival, memehood and endless tabloid fascination with the artists behind it, and then reduce that down to a two-digit maximum numerical score???? Anyway I still like the song so whatevs

**ggal2020** (8): in concept I hate this song, but when I’m listening to it, I just can’t help but like it

**kirby31200** (8): The first time I heard this song was in a Newgrounds flash animation called Naruto Randomness 8. Just probably a weird place to hear one of the most iconic songs of the decade for the first time

**MrMoodle** (8): (#31)

**MrSwearword** (8): sure it's lasted in public conscious but I can do without it

**succulentils** (8): Iconic, but I have to dock points for how rough he sounds holding out those notes in the chorus

**TiltControls** (8): sure it's a meme, but it's also still a good song

**splusten** (7.9): Never heard this one, hope it gets more traction

**stryxen** (7.9): yes I love this song! No I don’t want to listen to it ever again

**jsonphile** (7.5): it’s a shame this is Oasis’ best known song, when Don’t Look Back In Anger is far better (would be a 9.5)

**engifear** (7.4): Wndrwll by Neil Cicierega gets a perfect 10 though

**yourfacesucksass** (7.3): like the song, but the brothers are insufferable

**ManofOranges** (7): It's gonna be a meh from me. I think the appeal of this song has more to do with just it being a song that everybody knows and can sing to rather than one that most people enjoy. With that being said I do kind of enjoy this song.

**RainbowWhale101** (7): Not a bad song but its crazy overrated, I strongly dislike his singing voice, it's so whiny.

**runaway3212** (7): I really never understood the hype around this

**rickikardashian** (6.8): yesterday i hung up with other music students, one brought a guitar, and guess what song he played first

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): why was this the song every college-aged white boy chose to learn? it's pretty good (except the grating vocals) but it's like... nothing special? the right vocalist can make this song work though I have to say

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.2): anyway here’s wonderwall

**RVA\_101** (5.4): 'Today is gonna be the day' oh god shut the fuck up already. So many other great songs in the discog and this is the one every guitarist has to bust out the acoustic to. Stop comparing them to the Beatles too, they're not remotely unless that Lennon looking mf in the video counts. Oh my fucking shit this song annoys the fuck out of me. Points given because it's still objectively an ok song but by god the chorus is so annoying. Maybeeeeeeee. Saves meeeeee. After aaaaaaaaaaa. Wonderwaaaaaaaa

**seanderlust** (5.3): today's gonna be the day that i'm gonna THROW THIS ASS BACK TO YOU. just kidding. maybe i'm rating this so low because it drags a bit and doesn't build anywhere important and the lyrics aren't interesting, and maybe it's because i'm just waiting for the next song on this playlist, which is "Everybody dance now". or a little of both.

**awhile2** (5): this is one of few songs that i still dont know if i love or hate it

**rslashpoopheads** (5): This song is so bland.

**waluigiest** (5): this song occupies zero space in my brain. Every time I see a wonder wall meme I think “huh I have no idea what that song is”

**wavingwolves** (5): the best part of this song is the memes that come with it

**aestheticen** (4): https://www.instagram.com/p/CFijZsJgm3K/

**anothertown** (3): buy now, hummus and a wow extra large falafel meal for 2

**Roxieloxie** (3): anyway heres wonderwall

**skargardin** (3): anyways, here's wonderwall

**CritneySpearz** (0): one of the worst songs ever, I said what I said. So grating to the ears when he wails out AFTER ALLLLL bleh

**Srtviper** (0): I used to work at an olive garden and they played a Frank Sinatra rip of cover of this and I'm now filled with hate.

**steelstepladder** (10): This is probably the best surprise of the rate. I really really didn't expect this to make day 3, the fact that it's top 40 makes me SO happy. It's just a story a gangsta rap story based song, with no real hook, thats over five minutes long, that isn't nearly as well known as some of the other hip hop in the rate. Those three elevens have real taste behind them.

**pearllouise** (7): Good for him

---

**awhile2** (11): just a perfect hip-hop song. everything about it, from the beat to the verses is iconic

**RVA\_101** (11): I know this is a pop sub but I hope people really attempted to listen to the lyrics, this is one of the best hip hop songs of the 90s, speaking of which I wish Pete Rock and CL Smooth's 'They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)' made it on this list too but I'm glad this one made it. Everything about this song is perfection. The sample from Isaac Hayes is like comfort food, that guitar is just undescribable in setting the atmosphere for the track. This song touches on mental illness like no other rap artist did at the time, it just was an issue that was brushed over and not as openly acknowledged as it is today. RIP Bushwick Bill (spits the 3rd verse) and prayers for Scarface (spit 1st, 2nd and 4th verses and wrote all 4), who is currently awaiting a kidney transplant due to post-COVID complications, one of the best rappers of all time btw. Simply ethereal this song.

**sandyfishnets** (11): so hear me out. this is one of my fave rap songs ever. Yes, the lyrics are intense and violent, but they set the scene with their words so perfectly. Also the sample, taken from the classic song 'Hung Up on My Baby' by Isaac Hayes, is SO GOOD and does wonders for the song.

**anothertown** (10): god damn dude

**kappyko** (10): this is literally so haunting

**kirby31200** (10): Happy spooky season

**MrSwearword** (10): basically because of Bushwick Bill's verse and the fact this song is fucked up and wonderful

**runaway3212** (10): lyrics are on point tbh

---

**anothertown** (10): My confession is that I have always loved this song and thought it is beautiful LOL

**bbfan132** (10): i remember immediately loving this when i first heard it while watching this exact special and it still holds up for me today. i love the psychedelic and heavy atmosphere contrasted with chris’s lethargic vocals during the chorus, it kind of feels like the song is chugging along slowly instead of trying to be too aggressive which wouldn’t work here

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): I like this song more than I feel like I should

**kirby31200** (8): Great song, but I'd much rather be rating a different Soundgarden song. Superunknown and Spoonman are two of my favorite songs of the whole 90s

**RVA\_101** (8): RIP Chris Cornell first and foremost. The video unsettled the *FUCK* out of me when I was younger, in fact the whole song was just unsettling in general for a middle schooler trying to get into grunge. Now of course I love it a lot more.

**waluigiest** (8): i can appreciate it for sure

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the way I thought this was finished half way through but there was still 2 minutes left

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**slimboyfriend** (7): Why do all of these indie rock songs feel like they were meant to be listened to by greasy 35 year old men who still live in their mom's basement

**vapourlomo** (7): Soundgarden are probably my least favorite of the big grunge four. But this song's solid

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.4): it’s not bad but i feel nothing

**Roxieloxie** (6): why is every rock song in this rate like 6 minutes long im so tired

**twat\_brained** (6): Barbie-cue! haha I get it lmao. In fact, that's the only thing I do get. The music video feels like the weirdest drug trip which otherwise doesn't make the song work on its own, like the Korn video. Of course, all due respect to Chris Cornell and his surviving family, but this just never really did anything for me.

**MrSwearword** (5): cute but I don't care for it much

**Mysario** (5): absolutely bin this music video

**rslashpoopheads** (5): It's okay I guess.

**TiltControls** (4): i fell asleep playing this on rock band once and it's never been the same since

**u/astrologicalangel** (4): a constant drone of a song

**dlong5665** (3): ive always hated soundgarden lowkey

**ManofOranges** (3): I was expecting something more... exciting.

**steelstepladder** (8): The misogyny gives it flavor. Sometimes you can be a total dick if the beat is that good and this might be a top 5 beat of the rate. New jack swing's signature song and for a reason.

---

**bbfan132** (10): the best new jack swing song of all time minus a bunch of janet’s songs (she should’ve had a song here)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love THE new jack swing song

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is SO good. This was one of the songs my high school marching band played in the stands during football games, and it was always a hit.

**MrSwearword** (10): fucking. legendary

**Mysario** (10): the song that made me wanna get up and dance and [all Fortnite players agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvVZegDnbJU)

**Roxieloxie** (10): I already know popheads is not black enough to appreciate this song but the sheer range this song has,,,, a cookout anthem,,, the intergenerational implications, I was at a function last year and the dj was playing whatever song to try and get us to dance and nothing but the moment he threw this on,, almost broke my leg trying to get to the floor

**TragicKingdom1** (10): really hope this goes far as one of the best remembered new jack swing songs of all time. also random thought but i feel like ariana grande would do a really great cover of this

**vapourlomo** (9): We're all in agreement that this was the peak of new jack swing, right?

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.7): exactly as good as the Alice Cooper song

**twat\_brained** (8.5): wait did Ayesha Erotica sample the intro on Literal Legend?

**splusten** (8.2): I didn't know Poison was smoother than butter

**cremeebrulee** (8): on a list of cursed glee covers

**dlong5665** (8): the most iconic drumline of any song ever? one could say its a literal legend

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): 90’s rate really is 5% songs covered by will schuester on glee

**wavingwolves** (7.5): fun

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**HermionesBook** (7): timeless song

**ReallyCreative** (6): I want to like this song more but it feels so hollow, love the vocals but the production is extremely of the time

**runaway3212** (5): I think this song is not great

**pearllouise** (10): If only Rose let Jack on that goddamn door.

**steelstepladder** (5): So people really don't like this song for some reason? Personally I think it's one of the lesser of the big power ballads but it's fine. Recorder version outsold.

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic huge bop

**camerinian** (10): If anyone comments something to the effect of "this song has a Titanic impact" i swear to god

**ImADudeDuh** (10): YOOUUUUUUUUUURRREEEEE HERE THERES **NO**THING I FEAR

**ManofOranges** (10): This and I Will Always Love You blend together in my mind but that shouldn't be taken as an insult that should be taken as a compliment.

**runaway3212** (10): Titanic is my favourite movie ever and this song fits the movie perfectly

**skargardin** (10): balladphobia better not rob this absolute classic

**stryxen** (10): cant believe I heard the intro and expected the cupcakke moan audio from tiktok. Social media has ruined me

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - one word: titanic

**vapourlomo** (10): Anyone who doesn't love this probably rooted for the iceberg.

**HermionesBook** (9.5): one of my favorite songs by celine. I heard she recorded the vocals in one take. Just beautiful

**TiltControls** (9.5): wheres the recorder tho

**twat\_brained** (9.4): This is Celine’s greatest vocal performance ever and I can’t believe she’s not as fondly remembered as artists like Mariah and Cher

**anothertown** (9): Titanic is good. This song bangs also and the key change is just massive

**conceptualromance** (9): I am once again asking you to open the door

**rslashpoopheads** (9): When she starts belting :sob:

**seanderlust** (9): do I like this song? I have two ears and a heart, don't I?

**yourfacesucksass** (9): sometimes i hate this song and sometimes i love it. the flutes are iconic tho.

**aestheticen** (8): This is how you make a power ballad

**dlong5665** (8): god i love celine even if she had to sink the titanic for this song

**ignitethephoenix** (8): its all coming back to me now outsold, but this is cute and it’s for Titanic

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It's good, but tbh it's kind of a snoozer :///

**u/astrologicalangel** (7.5): I enjoy this way more than I thought I would

**jsonphile** (7): not nearly as great as people say it is. But it gets an extra point for the key change at the final chorus

**kirby31200** (7): Like it's good but it's not something I'd pursue hearing

**Mysario** (7): sometimes I let my Casio keyboard play this for me

**Roxieloxie** (7): the flute cover kinda outsold

**wholesomebody** (7): thinking about how celine won an album of the year grammy over beck, smashing pumpkins and fugees and i will not get over it

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.6): i’ll never let go, jack...

**RVA\_101** (6.5): I'm gonna get crucified for this lmao, but I'm just not a fan of this song. Respect to Celine Dion, great voice, but maybe it's just that I'm never big on slow sweeping ballads or the radio has overplayed it or that fucking shitty flute meme has ruined it for me but I just can't get with it. Totally honest.

**J\_Toe** (6): “I put the diamond in the coat. And I put the coat on her!”

**MrMoodle** (5): (#76) the dramatics of it's all coming back to me now are funny, but you take it seriously because it's still so good. this is too much

**wavingwolves** (4): this song isn't even half of what it's all coming back to me now is

**bbfan132** (3): this is supposed to be so emotional but it feels completely phoned in? i feel nothing while listening to this

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i was alive in the 90s. this song was like glitter, sand, and various other hard to get rid of substances. what can i say, i can hold a grudge

**kappyko** (1): disastrous

**moonagenightmares** (1): this is the most basic love song of all time

**MrSwearword** (0): GARBAGE. This song ruined Celine and I have never forgiven its existence because of it.

**jsonphile** (9): how the hell did they not include Foo Fighters on the original list? I’m sure glad they voted in Rico Suave and Ice Ice Baby instead of any Foo Fighters song

**twat\_brained** (10): “acid jazz” describes this band. All I know is this song and video are definitive of 90s music, and it’s a shame this gets overlooked as one of the best of the decade, it’s certainly got the “it” factor to be considered as such.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): underrated king

**ManofOranges** (9): This a pretty good one.

**selegend** (9): cosmic girl >

**skargardin** (9): such a classic

**camerinian** (8.5): This wins the rate if we’re talking videos tho

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): who said disco died in the 80s? I'll say this overstays its welcome a tad, but it's a great throwback tune

**succulentils** (8.5): I prefer Canned Heat and Cosmic Girl (because of Center Stage lol)

**kirby31200** (8): Would be a 9 if we were rating the 3 minute version I'm used to, I think this version it too long and drags a little in comparison.

**Mysario** (8): is that a mofo Jojo reference xp

**wavingwolves** (8): good

**RVA\_101** (7.2): Far as Jamiroquai goes, I prefer Runaway but this is still a pretty good song, I just am not that big on it.

**seanderlust** (7.1): okay I know that my experiences aren't universal, but there was this PS2 game called beatmania in like 2004 that had this song which was basically like a guitar hero predecessor and it had this song and it was so fun. although that background violin in the second verse was killer. anyways, cool song.

**aestheticen** (7): Interesting to see the attitude towards technology advancement in the 90s in hindsight

**awhile2** (7): til jamaraquoi is white

**MrSwearword** (7): a case of the song being nothing without the video

**vapourlomo** (7): Honestly, maybe a bit too smooth to leave a real impact on me? Great video, though.

**steelstepladder** (9): This was dancing on the edge of day four for a while before dropping several spots during the last day and while I do believe it deserves day 4 I can't be too disappointed with this result. I mean it's a folk song driven by a mandolin that has no real chorus. I can't look a gift horse on the mouth here too much

**pearllouise** (5): My deaf/immature ass listening to “Let’s pee in the corner”

**bbfan132** (10): i used to think that this was overplayed and i guess it was but it’s also a great song so

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Michael Stipe was kinda the 90s Harry Styles with how ambiguous he was about his sexuality

**Mysario** (9): Grilled Cheezus

**RVA\_101** (8.8): One of my would-be 10s that radio ruined through extreme overplay. They got other [better] songs too fam. Excellent use of mandolin. Sucker for the subtle violins that kick in halfway through the 1st verse.

**splusten** (8.5): As a 25th level atheist, I can say that this song was a hell of a successful PR move for us.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): plucks guitar string while staring sorrowfully into the distance

**slimboyfriend** (8): I would give this song a higher score, but now it reminds me of that NYU dean who gave an interpretive dance to this song after telling students they weren't getting a refund..... and now I just laugh when I hear losing my religion

**wavingwolves** (8): this song has some sort of meme-y quality so i can't actually take it too seriously but it's still so good

**twat\_brained** (7.5): I can’t say I totally understand the song’s meaning nor why it’s so fondly remembered, but it sounds pretty cool.

**seanderlust** (7.3): i have a problem with something in this production. i think it's the mandolin. something feels out of place. i love the singer's vocal delivery though

**sadshrub** (7.2): Dope orchestra/band pairing but not dope enough to turn me from god

**rickikardashian** (7): the whole song feels like it’s leading to a chorus that never arrives

**u/astrologicalangel** (7): the nostalgia goggles are strong on this one

**yourfacesucksass** (7): i watched the entirety of vh1's greatest songs of the 90's back when they premiered it and aired it, and i remember them poking fun at this video. "that's me in the corner," and it's a shot of like a baby lmao. i'm hope i'm remembering this right. anyway, not my favorite r.e.m. song, i probably won't seek it out, but it's definitely not a bad song.

**1998tweety** (6.5): im bored

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): ehhhhhh never been a fan of this one

**J\_Toe** (6): I thought this was way older than the 90s due to it being music my Dad listens to

**MrSwearword** (6): cute for a taste not a swallow. Also "losing my religion" apparently being code for "losing my shit" in Southerner is kind of cute

**vapourlomo** (6): Man, I LOVE this band but I've always found Losing My Religion to be just okay. Maybe I'm not a mandolin guy? Not sure why it was R.E.M.'s biggest hit.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.8): chorus gets a bit grating

**awhile2** (4): i get why this is their biggest song but they have so much better

**CritneySpearz** (4): b o r i n g

**HermionesBook** (4): honestly never cared for this song much

**kappyko** (4): yeah the first experience i had with REM was in Glee what about it? "Radio Free Europe" kicks this song's ass any day of the week

**steelstepladder** (9): This song is just the coolest god damn song.

**pearllouise** (8): I feel sorry for the poor souls who give this a 4.20 score

---

**bbfan132** (10): classic, easy 10

**camerinian** (10): I don't think I'll ever have as much chemistry with any past or future lover as Dre and Snoop do

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ICONIC AS FUCK

**ManofOranges** (10): Nuthin but a hit

**MrSwearword** (10): this invented the West Coast

**Mysario** (10): this is the rate winner, right? ... right? 🥺

**RVA\_101** (10): Knowing this sub I'm trying to take bets on if any of the comments mention Dee Barnes or woman beater [if I'm the only one who does I'm just going to look like a tool]. I'm just trying to evaluate the music and shit, this is the originator to the whole G-funk genre. Dre created a whole new sound and West coast hip-hop ran with it to cultural domination. Killer Leon Haywood sample, one of my favorite 90s beats, great introduction to Snoop before he dropped Doggystyle. Say anything about his shortcomings as a human being but he's easily an influential

**twat\_brained** (10): "i accidentally clicked on a lil pump song so i came here to cleanse my soul". I'm not exactly fond of Snoop or Dre, but I know good hip-hop when I hear it. And I have not been hearing it in recent years. Except maybe Old Town Road and Megan's music.

**vapourlomo** (10): I think a lot of The Chronic has aged badly (mainly due to the sketch lyrics). But G Thang still sounds incredible nearly 30 years later. That production is un-fadable.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a song sure it will be robbed so i have to rate it accordingly

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): 90s hiphop singlehandedly saving my rate score average i fear

**MrMoodle** (9.4): (#13)

**jsonphile** (9): lyrics are honestly pretty meaningless but with this beat and their flows Dre and Snoop could literally be rapping about lunchables and they would still sound hella cool

**ReallyCreative** (9): this is a fucking classic

**runaway3212** (9): amazing

**skargardin** (9): this bops hard

**seanderlust** (8.3): god dr. dre ate this decade

**kappyko** (8): cute

**TragicKingdom1** (8): regulate is the superior iconic g-funk song

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Still sounds fresh

**1998tweety** (7): vibey but not much else

**anothertown** (7): 562 stand up!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the way snoop steals the spotlight again

**HermionesBook** (6.5): i prefer other songs by snoop and dre tbh. Great beat though

**rslashpoopheads** (6): nice

**pearllouise** (5.5): I could really care less about 90s boybands, to be honest. They are like the definition of a soccer mom’s throwback Spotify playlist.

**steelstepladder** (5): First things first, Backstreet Boys > NSYNC. Second off this song is quite good. It's not the best thing in the world and in terms of pop music I think theres much better but for what it is, it's decent. Bye Bye Bye is great though.

---

**MrMoodle** (11): (#1) whenever nsync starts playing i always imagine little people doing these super well-choreographed dance routines. it makes me tune out everything else in life, all that matters is the little people doing satisfying synced up choreography, nsync has become an emotional crutch for me

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**bbfan132** (10): nsync snapped here, i’ve always preferred them to backstreet boys and this song is almost euphoric in its delivery/sound

**hunnybee12** (10): it just hit me how good the hook is

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this may be my favourite nsync song along with bye bye bye (basic opinion but whatever)

**MrSwearword** (10): cheesy boyband shit like this works

**TragicKingdom1** (10): nsync really has the best two boy band songs of all time with this and It's Gonna Be Me

**twat\_brained** (10): It’s tearing up my heart knowing I’ll probably never meet Max Martin and tell him how much I love this song and like 100 other songs he’s worked on. More importantly, JC Chasez is just on another plane of existence with his singing prowess, I want his vocal coach’s phone number.

**wavingwolves** (10): they ended bsb career with this one!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this song is kinda amazing huh...

**seanderlust** (9.5): i'm suddenly ten years old, in the middle of an FAO Schwartz. it is the summer of 2001 and there are so many new toys to see. I know, deep down in my bones, what unfiltered joy feels like as I rifle through the beanie babies, waiting to make a connection with the perfect 2001 signature bear. it was magenta pink with a heart over its chest, sealed with the signature "Ty". clutching one, I hold it close to my chest. there is no bad in the world. there is only signature bear. 9.5/10.

**anothertown** (9): NSYNC bangers are evergreen

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a bop but wtf why was this picked

**Mysario** (9): okay but when is the boy band rate where we don't throw in obvious winner Britney in there too

**HermionesBook** (8): i was always an NSYNC girl! Love this song

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): this didnt go as hard as I want it that way but ill accept it

**ManofOranges** (7): Bye Bye Bye outsold it really did.

**RVA\_101** (6.6): I'll always feel bad for the other 4 that most people know NSYNC as the JT launching pad lmao. I love the production here, tempo is very new jack swing inspired.

**awhile2** (6): one of nsyncs weaker singles imo

**camerinian** (6): I haven’t listened to any NSYNC or BSB album but based on singles it’s fully Backstreet all the way tbh, better harmonies, more equal footing and more emotive. This is fine but I know who’s getting my TRL vote

**J\_Toe** (6): honestly never heard this song before

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Okay.

**skargardin** (6): a bit basic

**runaway3212** (5): *NSYNC has one good song and it’s not this one

**steelstepladder** (4): I'm pretty sure this is the girl that Nine Days were singing about in Absolutely Story of a Girl. Songs like these were pretty frequent in the late 90s, but what makes this stand out is she calls herself a bitch. It makes the song way more memorable but, other than that the songs is actually kind of underwhelming when you look at it.

**MrSwearword** (10): invented bitch being a mood and is forever legendtinta for that.

**ReallyCreative** (10): wow I fucking love punk women

**runaway3212** (10): ‘I hate the world today’ omg me too. ‘Yesterday I cried’ me too again. Queen of relatability.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is such a good song to sing along to ughhhh i love it

**bbfan132** (9): she kind of spilled here

**fadedblue09** (9): Lmao sounds like a joke but mood, I guess.

**rickikardashian** (9): me on my interview trying to get the job

**vapourlomo** (9): Probably my favorite of all the Lilith Fair-style alt-rock jams. That hook is a monster.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): steal my blood and steal my heart. "I'm a child", sings the 30-something.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): queen spilt. be your self ladies

**jsonphile** (8): it’s brooks, bitch

**RainbowWhale101** (8): Great song! It will always make me think of Orphan Black.

**slimboyfriend** (8): It's I'm Every Woman for girls who aren't like other girls.

**waluigiest** (8): I always thought this was Alanis Morissette

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): i hate that there's videos on youtube that credit this song as alanis morissette's song JUST because there can only be one female + guitar in the '90s.

**RVA\_101** (7.5): Love the chorus haha. The attitude really sells it. And a great guitar solo.

**pearllouise** (6.5): Fun fact: If you take away the last word the title of this song, you get one of Katy Perry’s worst songs

**steelstepladder** (3): Another song that I think has 10 good seconds in it but I think the rest is kind of mediocre. People said I'm Too Sexy is more of a catchphrase than a song but this is also an offender of that with anything other that the title line being immediately wiped from memory after the listen. Most overrated song in the rate if I'm being honest

---

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): a total fucking bop, still trying to forget the glee cover though

**ImADudeDuh** (10): does anyone remember when Howie Mandel had that short lived prank show where called Howie Do It and after someone was pranked he just went “and this, is Howie Do It” and then this song would play?

**kappyko** (10): "is" is a verb capitalize it u fools!!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): stone cold classic

**Roxieloxie** (10): Whatever I said about poison when i gave that a 10 can be applied here too. Intergenerational banger

**runaway3212** (10): Katy Perry wish she could get the ‘it’ this song has.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): extremely groovy, i've always thought this was underrated

**twat\_brained** (10): I can’t discern what Montell is saying but I can’t help but groove all the same, it’s just one of those songs that gets everything right.

**vapourlomo** (10): The perfect blend of R&B, gangsta rap and pop.

**ManofOranges** (9): Yeah he's right!

**Mysario** (9): kind of an anthem

**jsonphile** (8.5): great song but the image of Will Schuster from Glee sitting at a lunch table and turning to the camera and singing “this is how we do it” is forever ingrained in my mind

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): this score may be too high but after listening to an entire rate full of men who can’t sing, this guy’s voice sounds angelic

**ignitethephoenix** (8): bop!

**RainbowWhale101** (8): Bro I would YELL if this came on at the club, best believe I'll be requesting it post COVID

**seanderlust** (8): a mid-90s party bop!

**camerinian** (7.5): this is really quite terrible in the context of this rate's playlist but I'm aware that's the last place I should listen to it

**wavingwolves** (7.5): infectuous

**RVA\_101** (7): My favorite anecdote about Montell Jordan I've read was an AskReddit thread asking the worst concert you've attended and someone said him because he just kept doing this song. I mean, it's a hit. Dig the sample that it gets from/shares with Slick Rick's 'Children's Story', and his interpolation of Slick Rick's lyrics in one verse.

**dlong5665** (6): this is one of those tracks that everyone knows the chorus but not a single verse

**yourfacesucksass** (5): I feel like white 20-somethings have taken this song as theirs, because I only ever see people like that play this song repeatedly in my city, but, maybe my city is shit. Because of it though, I hate this song now lol.

**steelstepladder** (10): Today would have been better if it got day 4 but I guess late day 3 isn't bad. As far as pure gangsta rap goes this might be my favorite song in the rate, maybe tied with Mind Playing Tricks on me.

**pearllouise** (8): Many would definitely underestimate how hard it is to write a rap song. Not only do you have to make it rhyme and fit the beat, but you also have to tell a story. Telling a story in your music can be difficult if no one knows you. Your story is your way of conveying your experiences to the listeners who may never have had the same experiences. What Ice Cube and many other rappers were able to do in their day was use their music as their emotional therapy and the listeners are the therapists.

---

**bbfan132** (10): i love the production here and ice cube was great as well

**camerinian** (10): This was as close to an 11 as any other song got for me. This track has so many multitudes, with a genuine celebration of the small things in life constantly underpinned by the grim, depressing, deadly reality of street life always lingering in peripheral vision. It's in many ways joyous and downbeat at the same time, but you can't help but be swept up in the relaxed beauty of the top layer of street life. It's such a subtle song that shows a lot more than it tells, which is rare in such a literate genre like hip-hop. It's deservedly a classic, and I know I'm already gonna be disappointed in how this sub treats this so

**ImADudeDuh** (10): going from Run Around to this is another mood whiplast

**kappyko** (10): please make day 4 please make day 4 please make day 4 please make day 4 please make day 4

**MrMoodle** (10): (#4) this song is amazing but the animal crossing version is better don't @ me

**MrSwearword** (10): a goddamn fucking classic and I shouldn't even have to bring up GTA San Andreas to drive that point home

**Mysario** (10): I've never had to use an AK so my life has been good

**vapourlomo** (10): As a sad Sonics fan (RIP), even the existence of that team would make this a great day, even if the Lakers beat them.

**sadshrub** (9.3): The scriptures of the warrior poet

**kirby31200** (9): Would it be weird to call this song heartwarming?

**runaway3212** (9): Fantastic

**RVA\_101** (9): Fantastic Isley Brothers sample and Ice's best song as a solo artist (yes, even more so than No Vaseline).

**CritneySpearz** (8.8): SO DEEP SO DEEP PUT HER ASS TO SLEEP love that

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): banger

**splusten** (8.3): Can't relate often now a days but it's good to pretend

Now THAT was iconic.

**pearllouise** (9): It’s about damn time we give Missy Elliot the praise she deserves. A rap legend.

---

**bbfan132** (10): missy’s bars are iconic, timbaland’s production is iconic, the music video is iconic, stan missy elliott

**conceptualromance** (10): I love Missy Elliot so much

**dlong5665** (10): missy can do no wrong

**ManofOranges** (10): I swear Missy Elliott can do no wrong!

**MrSwearword** (10): fabulous sampling, music video for the gawds, yaaaaaaaaaas

**RainbowWhale101** (10): Missy still Supa dupa fly in 2020! "Beep beep, who got the keys to the Jeep? Vroom!" quality bars!!

**runaway3212** (10): I also can’t stand the rain

**seanderlust** (10): this song gives me the same sense of calm as chill lofi beats to study to does

**skargardin** (10): this slaps

**TragicKingdom1** (10): hoping this sneaks into the top 10 somehow, classic missy deserves

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): I wish this would've built up more, but for what it is, i enjoy the vibes

**MrMoodle** (9.5): (#12) the amount of boring-ass songs on the bottom half of this list that beat this. this is a crime.

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): accidentally typed this in my notes as Supa Fupa Fly

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): an entire vibe

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): bop but not much happens

**RVA\_101** (8.5): Who doesn't love Missy lol, her adlibs and lyrics are the funniest shit. Beep beep who's got the keys to the Jeep vroooooooommm, one of her bars is literally '5 6 7 8 9 10', she's one of few with charisma who can pull that off lmao.

**kappyko** (7): im just surprised at the gall of them to put a missy elliott song so low

**twat\_brained** (7): for some reason I thought this’d be more upbeat than it is. Missy’s great, though.

**wavingwolves** (7): not really her best but still solid

**plastichaxan** (6): Missy a queen but this is too repetitive

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Misdemeanor's in the house!

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): I like missy but this is kind of boring and the end drags out way too much

**pearllouise** (10): If you have ever had your heart broken, it is best to listen to some sappy break-up melodies to numb it all away. In Sinead O’Connor’s ballad “Nothing Compares 2 U” Sinead conveys the heavy emotions and the ugly feeling of guilt and disbelief that many relate to when they call it quits when a partner that they have shared a close history with. Thank your Prince for this amazing body of work.

**steelstepladder** (10): You can keep your I Will Always Love Yous and your Vision of Loves, this is the best ballad of the rate full stop. Other people may look for power but it's another thing to just sell in on emotion.

---

**conceptualromance** (11): nothing compares to this song

**engifear** (11): Fuck the Catholic Church

**anothertown** (10): This song absolutely bangs and does not get its due today, also I recommend reading the “Controversies” section of Sinead’s Wikipedia page because it’s insane

**bbfan132** (10): stunning and heartwrenching cover, love the album that this is on as well

**hunnybee12** (10): the world stopped moving when this dropped. 2 legends

**ImADudeDuh** (10): if my catholic mom saw me giving this a 10 lmao

**runaway3212** (10): I wish I had a breakup to be heartbroken about so I could relate to this

**sandyfishnets** (10): so this is the point of the rate where I'm crying? ok cool

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - prince snapped hard, also iconic vocals!

**TiltControls** (10): the heartbreak anthem! Easily one of the best ballads of the 90s. "Girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do/but he's a fool" is one of my favourite lyrics just cause of the delivery.

**jsonphile** (9): a truly heartbreaking song

**kirby31200** (9): Better than the Prince version?

**slimboyfriend** (9): Another great funeral song that's actually about a breakup in this rate!

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**MrMoodle** (8.5): (#24)

**RVA\_101** (8.5): Shoutout to an artist who stood up against the Catholic Church in a radical fashion and got blackballed for it. Prince of course is a legend for writing this but also slightly a lil bitch for not liking this clearly superior rendition lmao. RIP Prince. Points off because I never liked the no-*THING* shrill thing she does, Prince doesn't do it, and I respect it as her artistic license with the rendition but it's not my thing.

**seanderlust** (8.5): i'm unclear on whether she's singing about an ex-lover or her mom or both? maybe it's just a song about the feeling of loss? either way, i love this.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Good, but prefer Prince's recording of this

**sadshrub** (8.2): This strange Winona Rider clone got some pipes

**dlong5665** (8): thank god for sinead

**HermionesBook** (8): i love sinead’s vocals.

**splusten** (7.8): No, but Vogue, Baby got Back, Jump Around, and Cannonball compare to this on the list, according to me

**ggal2020** (7.5): nothing compares 2 the way she was right about the pope

**wavingwolves** (7.5): this isn't the best song ever but it's a big 90s staple for sure

**ignitethephoenix** (7): eh kind of boring

**MrSwearword** (7): I really do not give a shit if this was a Prince song first or if Sinead O'Connor is forever defined by this, but honestly, do I like the song? Kind of but I can do without it

**Mysario** (7): two of the top ten on this list are covers, I love the 90s

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Not the Whitney ballad it thinks it is.

**twat\_brained** (7): massively overrated, but +3 for that brave demonstration on Saturday Night Live.

**waluigiest** (7): maybe a long shot but does anyone know Girl Talk? I learned this chorus from a sample in one of his mixes lol

**yourfacesucksass** (7): haunting song and video. all things aside with sinead herself, i think the song is solid.

**awhile2** (6): her vocals on the hook are iconic but thats all the song has going for it

**camerinian** (6): And here's the first of many songs on this list that Girl Talk has eternally fucked for me

**RainbowWhale101** (6): I really wanted this song to go somwhere but it just didn’t

**ReallyCreative** (6): I just think other people did this same exact kind of ballad but better

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.2): yawn

**ManofOranges** (5): Don't really like the song that much, but might as well take this moment to say that Sinead has some balls like no one else for what she did that night on SNL.

**Roxieloxie** (5): too long im sorry

**MelodramaticLemonade** (4): I heard It's All Coming Back To Me Now from the Redemption Rate and I've been comparing every ballad I hear to it now. This song doesn't fare well

**pearllouise** (10): There is no denying how talented of a woman Mariah Carey is. Yeah she had that screw-up on New Year’s plus the disastrous All I Want For Christmas is You mic feed leak from the NYC Tree Lighting, but if you forget all about that shit, you can’t deny that she has a powerhouse voice and Vision of Love is a masterclass that many aspiring vocalists should partake in.

---

**1998tweety** (10): sooo sooo good, queen snapped so hard at the start of her career

**anothertown** (10): Stream The Rarities and The Live Debut

**dlong5665** (10): mariah could do no wrong this decade

**HermionesBook** (10): the song that started it all! This is such an interesting debut single because it feels pretty dark. It really showcases mariah’s range though, going from her deeper vocals to her iconic whistle

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this is one of the greatest songs ever created, and i will die on that hill with a smile on my face.

**runaway3212** (10): can you imagine last year all I had heard from Mariah was AIWFCIY, the tastelessness of it all.

**seanderlust** (10): At first I def thought the backup singers were singing "right through the nuts" instead of "right through the nights." even still, this was transcendent.

**skargardin** (10): CMON VOCALS

**the\_k\_nine\_2** (10): - THE best debut single of all time

**twat\_brained** (10): inspired both Ava Max and Alice Chater. Not to mention, this was where Mariah first began shepherding her Lambs, and I think that’s beautiful

**ignitethephoenix** (9): vocal queen

**ManofOranges** (9): Mariah kind of did that

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's not my favorite Mariah song from this period of time but like... the talent

**waluigiest** (9): glorious debut

**wavingwolves** (9): mariah's vocal runs in this... whew

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.8): this is apparently mariah's best single

**MrMoodle** (8.8): (#22)

**rickikardashian** (8.5): always be my baby deserved

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): She's a visionary!

**jsonphile** (8): not my favorite Mariah song, but this song is incredibly impressive for a debut single

**kappyko** (8): shoulda coulda been fantasy

**kirby31200** (8): Emotions deserved this spot

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): who doesn’t love a good mariah song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This sounds like a generic wedding video song

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I would've chosen Always Be My Baby, Emotions, Hero, Fantasy, Honey, or All I Want For Christmas Is You, but I guess this did prove more influential than all of those songs.

**TiltControls** (7.5): there were better Mariah hits in the 90's (this is still good) but in terms of iconicness I can see why it was picked

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): okay i will stand mariah until the test of time but i just...for some reason this song doesn't resonate with me as much as her others. the pipes are clean as can be though!

**RVA\_101** (7.3): What a voice man. These classic 90s MC ballads I've never been big on, but if I hear one randomly I'm gonna pay respect and listen the whole way through and appreciate that voice. 40 years in the game. Respect.

**splusten** (7.2): Mariah Carey helped to make the movie 'Glitter,' however she also made 'All I want for Christmas is You', which is the only reason this didn't get my 0.

**bbfan132** (7): i love mariah but this song has never fully done it for me, it feels a bit too basic to me and i’m not really into adult contemporary so… she has ballads that are much better than this (it’s still pretty good though)

**sandyfishnets** (7): her voice is heavenly, but the song itself is kinda meh

**MelodramaticLemonade** (6.5): Why is half of her leftovers on The Rarities better than this

**J\_Toe** (6): I wish Fantasy or Honey were here, both could have got my 11. I prefer the more uptempo hip-hop influenced pop tracks from Mariah

**Mysario** (5): hot take but the song is merely good but not that great. VH1 serving tastelessness by choosing this over literally any other of her 90's songs

**vapourlomo** (4): I'm sorry, Mariah really isn't for me. But if the Fantasy Remix with ODB made this list...that might've gotten my 11

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is kinda one of her worst number ones, don’t @ me

**MrSwearword** (1): maudlin, overhyped garbage
