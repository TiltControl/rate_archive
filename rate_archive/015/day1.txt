bluehxrizon: # #36: Say Anymore - Kiiara
---
**Average:** 5.040 // **Controversy:** 2.448 // [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRWq53IFXVQ) 

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x3) TheAllRightGatsby, blasifeelsswift, Awhile2 (9.5 x2) leviOHsa, Death_Soup (9 x2) whatsapilot, FishM8 (8.7 x2) JunkyGS, DisguisedPrincess (8.4 x1) patronsaintofaspies (8.2 x1) twat_brained 

**Lowest Scores:** (0 x4) sjoors, bluehxrizon, Yatcho, mokitsu (1 x7) Crab345, dirdbub, Dracyoshi, NapsAndNetflix, skiddos, THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD, Nerdy_boy_chris (2 x6) Look_A_Fangirl, Joebiekong, Altiondsols, BionicFunhouse, whatyourheartdesires, PuggleMaster 

------
The first victim of the EP rate is Kiiara, with the polarizing (and somewhat atrocious) "Say Anymore". This song does absolutely nothing for me and I feel like it brings out the worst in Kiiara's already weak vocals and Felix Snow's production on low kii savage. 

----------

A few happened to enjoy this one though; **ThatParanoidPenguin** says "Fast kiiara is really disorienting. Beat is wild and dope. For some reason this song gives me a headache though, and for that, it gets docked a point." while **Awhile2** praises her vocals: "i love the glitchiness in her voice, very reminiscent of PC Music". 

**TheAllRightGatsby** is in for a disappointment: "I have gotten this track spontaneously stuck in my head so many times that I've lost count. I love this track; I think it's incredibly clever, I think the production is fascinating and infectious, and I think Kiiara's melodies and delivery are just wonderful. And more than anything I like that she commits to the concept of the scheme and doesn't cop out at the end. Probably my favorite on the EP."

---

Others didn't *hate* this song as much as I did, but the lukewarm reaction was common all around. **Spanksalot2** says "production here actually sounded pretty decent to begin with, but it goes absolutely nowhere and the vocals are just annoying. There's actually potential here but seeing as she just collabed with Linkin Park I'm not hopeful for the future"; **Uber-A** agrees: "It started off cute... Then the vocal effects, quick editing, all the components to make it a 'chart song' started pouring in." 

I can get on board with **SkyBlade79**'s take: "This song changes kiiara's melodic, breathy vocals more than in any song before. They're more filtered and pitched. This song obviously isn't trying to be as serious as 'Feels' or 'Intention', and that's okay. However, the production doesn't reflect the nature of the song at all. It sounds unnatural, with its singular notes. This is the type of song that could be amazing with a good remix. It just doesn't seem like it belongs on the EP, though. The vibe it gives is just so different to anything previously heard by kiiara."

---

Despite its redeeming qualities, this is what most of everyone else had to say:

**dirdbub**: "literally what in the fuck is going on with this song"

**skiddos**: "This is just horrendous wow"

**TonyRealm**: "What is this vocal stampede."

**mokitsu**: "This is one of the worst songs i've ever listened to. Nothing about this is good. This is very horrible and I wish I died in 2015 so I would never have to hear something as bad as this"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Why does this shit sound like Wind Waker"

**Yatcho**: "Bitch stop doing what youre doing now. This song is a hate crime"

**calltehshots**: "What the hell is this...."

-----------
As expected, this self-ripoff of Closer is out pretty early. I don't even think "All We Know" is that terrible of a song - sure, its generic and doesn't really go anywhere - but that fact that it does everything that Closer does in a worse way makes it hard to not dislike. 

-----------

This song featured reactions of many people at peak Chainsmokers hate levels:

**gannade**: "no"

**Spanksalot2**: "yeah fuck this song and everything it represents"

**banananaise**: "this is painfully boring"

**enecks**: "I hate the vocals. I hate the drop. I hate the beat."

**calltehshots**: "This is generic even for these guys.."

**BreezySeason**: "Stop trying to make Andrew singing a thing. He can't sing. here's some dua lipa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nydxbGhgv8" (THANK YOU for this beautiful song breezy)

---

Surprisingly, some people had a few nice things to say about this. 

**LandonKidatrea** has a convincing case: "What I love about this song is how perfectly it captures the image of a couple trying their hardest to stay together even though they really should break up. And the sad thing is that they know it. They're just in denial. The happy ending in this situation is for them to break up. Everything about this song functions to paint that specific image. The main sentiment of the song (We're both unhappy but we're staying together because this relationship is All We Know) is a terrible sentiment to build a love song around. But for this song it's perfect. Phoebe Ryan is a smart choice for featured artist. Compared to Halsey, the other featured artist Chainsmoker guy duets with, Phoebe Ryan's vocal delivery matches his much more closely. Upon relistening to Closer it really sounds to me like Halsey is way more into it than Andrew (He actually sounds sarcastic at times). But on All We Know he and Phoebe Ryan are on more equal footing vocally, and thus it paints the picture that they both feel the same way. It also helps that the mood All We Know is going for (somber denial) is a better fit for Andrew's voice. I also love the chorus, where both Andrew and Phoebe deliver their sweeping declaration of love but because of their singing it just sounds limp and unbelievable. Like they're just saying these things to try to convince themselves that they're in love. TL;DR I gave my 11 to a Chainsmokers song. Deal with it popheads."

**ThatParanoidPenguin** also enjoyed this track: "Really cute and warm song. This also suffers a little from Closer syndrome, but this song manages to have its own identity. And regardless, that prechorus is just dreamy and beautiful. I'm a way bigger fan of this instrumental chorus because it has more depth and the synths are a little more original than Setting Fires. Phoebe Ryan really adds a nice flair to this track."

**SriX23** makes a point with their Lights comparison (is it too late to change my score now) "this one's kinda boring too but Phoebe's voice always reminds me of Listening-era Lights so not gonna be too hard on this one"

---

Phoebe Ryan stanning also saved this song from being the first one out:

**franch**: "love phoebe so much"

**leviOHsa**: "Closer 2.0, I like Phoebe's voice though."

**skargardin**: "They could’ve given Phoebe a solo verse. Other than that it ain’t all that bad."

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "only because of Phoebe Ryan"

**therokinrolla**: "best track on the record. Phoebe is great for this track, the production is really good, and… yea."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "this got me to actually like phoebe ryan"

-----

And finally, the inevitable (and justified) Closer comparisons:

**dirdbub**: "people say Closer is bad, but holy shit is this song bad. they didn't even try; it's just a worse rehash of Closer"

**Awhile2**: "this is basically Closer’s ugly little sister"

**8485blue**: "Bootleg Closer; sounds better though"

**MNREDR**: "DAE think the chorus just sounds exactly like Closer?"

**OberionSynth**: "SO BABY PULL ME CLOSER wait wrong song"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Why are these drops so unimaginative? Closer 3.0"

**Uber-A**: "Cheap Closer rip off to try and replicate its success. Very surprised it wasn't a single. It's awful."

**Wailordfan**: "Ok, I'm fine with just hating this song. You can sing Closer at a slightly slower tempo, and it fits perfectly on top of this chorus. Plus, I honestly don't like Phoebe's voice. I've never loved whispery songs, and this really grinds my gears."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Are they so unoriginal that they made a bootleg Closer on the same EP?? The chord progression is pretty much identical on the prechorus and chorus and the instrumental on this one is even more dull"

**bliamc**: "Closer-lite. Only slightly less horrendous than Closer itself."

**leviOHsa**: "Closer 2.0, I like Phoebe's voice though."

**Swaqqalicious**: "Chorus is good. Some of the vocal lines sound like they're taken right from Closer though."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a poor man's Closer, which is actually saying a lot believe it or not."

**blasifeelsswift**: "second rate version of closer tbh, still good tho"

**whatsapilot**: "It's just a boring version of Closer."

**thefighter987**: "It’s the earworm melody of closer with literally all of its flaws removed. I wish it was bigger."

**jamesfog**: "This hit #18 and I've never heard it. Ripoff of Closer"

**Yatcho**: "Phoebe Ryan must be so pressed that this literal clone of Closer wasn't released first and took all that success from Halsey. She probably invented 'Fuck you bald bitch' tbh."

**SpanKKy1**: "Closer's shorter but still wholesome brother"

**camerinian**: "I actually quite like the more low-key nature of this song and how it suits the bittersweet lyrics. I mean I hate Phoebe Ryan’s mumbly, breathy voice but whatever"

**leafsnash61**: "Closer-lite."

---
Another early song out for Kiiara. This song is bearable but it almost feels like a filler song, which isn't a good sign for an EP with 6 songs. Also, are those sleigh bells I hear?? Why???

---

**Altiondsols** cannot comprehend how awful this is: "i began to hate myself in the first 15 seconds of the song, which is more than any of the rest of the tracks on this EP did for me. every single noise in this song makes me angry in some unique way." **MrSwearword** echoes a sentiment that a lot of /r/popheads would side with: "I’ll hang up the phone if you give up this thug shtick you semi-decent glitch-pop act."

**johnazoidberg-** finds problems with the lyrics AND production: "Of all the times somebody has called a car a whip, this is the whitest. Where the fuck did those jingle bells come from? Is this a terrible electropop song or a terrible Christmas song? And she released this shit as a single? RIP Music." See, i'm not the only one hearing sleigh bells wtf

**camerinian** basically summarized Kiiara's career: "I could be playing Breath Of The Wild right now why are you making me sit through this bottom of the barrel “I’m an art student who’s also on soundcloud” schlock"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** simply drags ha: "honestly if Kiiara ever called me I'd probably hang up too. I'd rather listen to the dial tone than this." 

---

A lot of people were just bored by this song:

**Uber-A**: "Snoozefest."

**zamomattel**: "Some cool ideas going on here but ultimately really uninspired and just kind of vacant"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I know this is the last song of this EP, BUT GODDAMN IT FEELS LIKE IT’S AN ENTERNITY." youre right fangirl, it was quite an enternity 

Even the spelling annoyed some people:

**TonyRealm**: "First up, I hate “alternative” spelling: it’s spelled “the” and there’s no reason to change it okay kara? The song is nice though, dreamy vocals over a glistening beat, with the occasional cymbal sounds (which are great) and vocal effects for some spice (which are okay). It’s not the kind of song I’d seek out, but if it comes on outside of my control I would nod once, twice if in a good mood."

**enecks**: "I'm giving this a 2 because fuck spelling the as tha."

---

Finally, the people who something positive to say:

**SkyBlade79**: "This is a really sleek, sensual track. The lyrics are probably the best on the EP at some points: 'Cause me plus you/ Equals everything we shouldn't do/ But you plus me/ Equals everything I wanna be.' However, the hip-hop inspired slang she uses does feel kind of strange, considering her vocal style. 'Hang up tha phone/ Hop in your whip/ Boy I'm home alone/ In this empty ass crib.' The production work is very suitable for the song, but it just seems too short, leading to the biggest problem that this EP faces."

**blasifeelsswift**: "i have nothing to say about this, i just love it"

**JohnnyToby**: "ok so she’s like a darker Selena Gomez and I kinda love it sel better watch out lmao"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The production is the best part of this track, from the weird voice-like synth to the little post-chorus groove."


Also, **Wailordfan** makes an observation about "low kii savage" as a whole: "I just don't have any kind of idea who Kiiara is after listening to her EP. I don't get a personality from her, and just get a poorly produced project imo that doesn't provide enough real vocal to really connect to what she is saying."


---

I actually screamed at this comment

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "I gave this song a 2 because the album is finally over... but it also sounds like the turtle sex meme...seriously, this girl is just a big meme"

bluehxrizon: # #33: Inside Out ft. Charlee - The Chainsmokers
---
**Average:** 5.755 // **Controversy:** 2.324 // [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY)

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x6) bluehxrizon, TheAllRightGatsby, omgcow, Mudkip1, mgglite, PuggleMaster (9 x3) TonyRealm, NapsAndNetflix, Wailordfan (8.8 x1) Joebiekong (8.6 x1) JunkyGS (8.5 x3) Yatcho, berober04, hoolytoledo (8.2 x1) poppinmmolly

---

I actually like this one :'(! "Inside Out" was released last Spring I believe but it got overshadowed by Don't Let Me Down which had come out a few weeks prior. Although the verses are a tad boring I do enjoy the drop (im a sucker for basic EDM leave me alone) and while I'm sad to see this out so soon, I can't see why anyone would be surprised.

---
 
**calltehshots**: "what the fuck"

---

Charlee was actually a pretty polarizing factor here:

**Spanksalot2**: "this falls in the same lane of acceptable chainsmokers tracks as Setting Fires. Production isn't stale as fuck and a good female vocalist."

**TonyRealm**: "Best song on the EP by a landslide. Vocals are great, production is polished and the sleek build-ups are actually well crafted (the only thing on this EP that warrants the use of that word). The outro is a bit of a letdown (you can do better than “ou-ou-out” come on), but this is still the highlight." (I totally agree on the outro being a letdown, the first time I heard it I was a bit confused)

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Great song for a rainy Sunday. I love Charlee's vocals."

**ExtraEater**: "yaas charlee literally slay those actually solid instrumentals bc you ruined the song beth"

**leviOHsa**: "Charlee's voice is really beautiful, but the production on this sounds cheap."

**superr_rad**: "love me inside out sounds like a super kinky porn i might be into. but this lady's voice is kinda grating to me"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I've never heard of Charlee before but she is absolutely wonderful and I really like this song and the production and her lyrics and voice and delivery"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "He Took His Skin Off For Me teas. Also this bitch has a bland AF voice. Also this song is too damn long."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I love these vocals holy shit."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Decent but the vocal delivery and lyrics are boring me to sleep"

**DrunkHurricane**: "The way the singer sounds is just weird."

---

A common complaint was how uninspired and bland it feels, even for a Chainsmokers song:

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's like if The Chainsmokers copied The Chainsmokers."

**banananaise**: "wow this group has an incredible talent in sucking the joy out of music"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Well at least the EP is consistently bland."

**SkyBlade79**: "This song has very little staying power. I like the snares in this song, but the vocalist, Charlee, just sounds SO utterly bored and unenthusiastic. It's a shame, because this song has by far the best drop on the EP; the first part of the drop is cliche, but the second part is rather nice. The vocals ruin this song."

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "The word that comes to mind is 'uninspired'"

**leafsnash61**: "Yawn."

Even **FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** the secret Chainsmokers stan deems this "lame and boring". 😩

**BreezySeason**: "Honestly formulaic doesn't even begin to describe the chainsmokers. Like what makes any song on here different. here's some dua lipa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLDIhqMWH00" (thank u again breezy)

---

Even the people that were okay with this song didn't have much to say:

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "This song has the benefit of not having been grossly over-played"

**Altiondsols**: "pretty standard Chainsmokers Formula but at least it isn't that annoying"


**MrSwearword**: "At the very least it’s ambient adjacent. They still have to have their stink synth fucking things up. Oh well, this is decent."

**Wailordfan**: "This is such an underrated bop, and is honestly a really gorgeous song. For an edm love song, it does a really good job at sounding sincere. Also, Charlee sounds eerily like Christina Perri."

**skargardin**: "I’m really indifferent about this one. It for sure is nothing all that special or memorable, just “there”. I liked the drop buildup though."

**twat_brained**: "It feels like an okay track, but really nothing more than that. I feel like it belongs sooner on the EP or it shouldn’t be here at all."

---

Comments related to the movie (they're right, it's better than the song):

**Uber-A**: "The movie is better."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "It's funny that this shares a name with a Pixar movie about emotion and imagination cause I can’t feel either of those in this boring ass song"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Pixar did it better!"

I have to say I did NOT expect this song to be out so soon, tragically taking four people's 11s along with it. To be honest I don't actually remember why I gave this song a 9; it doesn't really have any direction. At the same time, it creates a nice atmosphere and pulls off the "chill electronic music" trend pretty decently. 

---

**dirdbub** is not a fan: "this sounds so unfinished. it's like Kiiara was like 'I have all these fake-deep Tumblr lyrics but I can't figure out how to put it solidly to a beat; throw them all over each other, clipping the lines, over some stereotypical beat. it'll sell well that way'" Spot on, except it didn't help her sell 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** says what a lot of people are thinking: "This track kinda bores me, idk. Even the chorus just has her doing the same thing, and like ugh."

**MrSwearword** and **kyrgyzzephyr** notice her poor pronounciation:  "OH MY GOD her pronunciation is horrible. Too many “fells”? You mushmouthed shit-slice."; "Sounds more like fails to me". **jamesfog** basically sums up how she sounds here: "way too many fails"


---

For a song called "Feels", many felt it was void of any feeling:

**MNREDR**: "Kiiara's voice is enjoyable, but the song is pretty monotonous and forgettable."

**wearingsox**: "this song is all about emotion but has no emotion in it"

**zamomattel**: "I hate songs that use slang and try to fool you into think they're emotional but are just empty"

**superr_rad**: "I wanna like this but i feel really disconnected from her, i dont wanna listen to her, its not personal, emotional, or insprign"

---

Her vocals remain an issue for a lot of people as well, but some enjoyed them:

**skiddos**: "Kiiara girl I know you can't afford vocal lessons but that doesn't mean you should be taking lessons from Siri" screaming

**callmetidle**: "wow i hate how she sings and I hate that she actually uses the word feels"

**Awhile2**: "I mean i know her voice is smothered in autotune but it still sound so nice and I love that lyrically she has more than the majority of pop stars today"

**therokinrolla**: "OMG thiis iis really really good. II was told that low kii savage was a bad album, but even iif the other songs were 1’s, thiis song alone would pull iit up. IIt iis excellent! IIntiimate, kiinda claustrophobiic, her voiice iis beautiiful and thii production… mmm" same

**BreezySeason**: "i like the airy production here and i actually like autotune. still gonna get dragged tho"

**TonyRealm**: "Love the vibe and how the vocals never really stop, and the production complements her well."

---

Despite it's detractors, this song had a surprising amount of fans.

**blasifeelsswift** explains their 11: "this is amazing and perfect showstopping the best thing ever godney could never, song made my asshole quiver, legendary, iconic, when will your fave, etc. Now onto the serious stuff. This is like the new angsty emo song of the 2010s and i’m 10000% here for it because it’s not cringeworthy at all. The way she pronounces xans confused me a little bit because i thought she was saying senses which made sense in the context but it’s actually really clever. Props to you mawma. Her voice is so ethereal and kinda whimsical, her delivery is uninterested and as if she’s bored of everything and that works. All this Xans inside my body, I say fuck it *keep on drowning** / Yeah, you can bring a juice I'll match you / Yeah, you mix it, pour the potion /I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean is brilliant. Kinda mad she didn’t atttend the Grammys, that would have been a nice little nod to this song tbh. I love love love love the way she delivers the end of the bridge, she manages to make rose, to do, dose and screwed jsut by changing the rythm and it’s just so good soooo so good. Drop top #KiiaraDidItFirst #MigosWho?"

**skargardin**: "This production is so sleek, nice flow overall."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Pure vibes. Kiiara's inflection/accent/enunciation is a little off-putting here, but I love how much presence she has on the mic even when she's almost whispering."

**Yatcho**: "This was a 10 the first time I heard it but her singing style just gets so annoying it really doesnt hold up to repeat listens well, the song starts to feel long at only 3 minutes. Production is fanastic"

**gannade**: "kiiara is gonna get trashed but i LOVE this. almost got my 11. feels, indeed."

**leafsnash61**: "Interesting!"

---

and yall doing the MOST as usual:

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I kind of wish some of the flying debris in the video hit her. is that bad"

Yikes... thats really all I have to say about "Gold" being out so early. A few people had even predicted this song to enter the top 10. I had a feeling Kiiara wouldn't do too well in this rate, but at this point she has only two songs left - worse than ***The Chainsmokers***. You guys had a lot to say about this so I'll just list as many comments as I can below:

---

**dirdbub**: "this song legit makes me want to kill myself"

**skiddos**: "I'm not well versed in Simlish"

**gannade**: "you all say you can't understand her and then go turn around and stan ari. yeah i see you, poopheads"

**MrSwearword**: "not as bad as the sub will say, but the vocal fuckery is too much."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's the song with the incoherent lyrics! Seriously, though, I heard this when it first came out and damn has it gone far. Great song with a really unconventional chorus that works damn well."

**Cryomatic**: "i still can't hear anything other than caught up in my tea"

**Spanksalot2**: "kiiara has here mastered the art form of pop music, as she realises that no one gives 2 shits whatever she's saying, so she could just say whatever she wants as long as it sounds fake deep and then just make the rest completely unintelligible, while at the same time accomplishing the achievement of getting people stuck on a hook that they can't even sing along too. Truly a work of art"

**letsallpoo**: "Copied Selena and Kygo"

**johnazoidberg-**: "This is going to be the most polarizing song in this rate, and I happen to fucking love it. It's just a shame this is the only good song on this sewer trash EP"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Props to Kiiara tbh for doing well off a song with a literally unsingable refrain"

**Altiondsols**: "not as bad as everyone says but still kinda bad. listening to the rest of this EP made me realize that on this track she's not exactly at rock bottom just yet"

**Awhile2**: "BEST POP HIT OF 2016 AND I’LL FIGHT ANYONE WHO DISAGREES"

**banananaise**: "i hate people who put words to the chorus. just accept the mystery"

**TonyRealm**: "My main issue is that the instrumental is so monotone, and neither the vocals nor lyrics are strong enough to compensate. The only real variation is the hi-hat, but its entrance two-thirds of the way through is so bewilderingly out of place. (In the final chorus, the hi-hat is passable, but I’d still like more variation.) Oh, and the hook is a great way to make a splashy debut to the music scene."

**mokitsu**: "This isn't nearly as bad as this sub makes it out to be. I think it's a fun song"

**OberionSynth**: "girl go back to work at the hardware store"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "I know this song is going to be destroyed at the first day, but to be honest, I fucking love this song. I don't know what does it. I wasn't a big fan of last years' mainstream songs, but this was great. I found it when it was starting to become famous, in early spring, and fell in love. The asymmetry of the song feels satisfying, the raindrop beats are my kind of chill, and the pause in the pre-chorus just so great. It's repetitive, kinda slow and sluggish, and not a huge song, but it had a staying power for me, and idk. I just adore this song(also if you don't understand that she's singing 'roof is falling let me love me asdkf I just know', then you need a hearing aid :eyes:)"

**Nfranklin50**: "How did this get out of the french rate?"

**chris_ou_poitrine**: "the chorus is nice nice and refreshing but the verses are unoriginal"

**zamomattel**: "I don't care that the chorus is so unintelligible, I like the verses and even think there is something likeable about that chorus"

**Wailordfan**: "I don't see why people don't love this song, it is honestly super catchy, and the line Tastes like money when I speak is honestly a hella fun line."

**jimmy345960**: "It hurt listening to this. Like i wanted to stop for the entirety. I don't mind vocal chopping #buyitaintmeonitunes but seriously, this song is low quality garabge"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Not thaaaat bad but it’s basically a budget Royals and like half her vocals sound like they’re being played backwards, I kinda like the sort of chopped vocals though"

**leviOHsa**: "I liked this song before it hit the mainstream. No but seriously, I really like the disjointedness and the general chill vibe."

**ExtraEater**: "Kiiara said the song is called 'Gold' because, compared to the trendy title of 'W.E.L.Y.K.', 'years from now it would still be relevant'. make of that what you will. And yes, this does take other parts of the song and puts it in the chorus, buuuut who cares. Also, in which I rank all songs I know of titled gold, Owl City > Victoria Justice > Chet Davis >> Imagine Dragons >>>>> Kiiara"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "This is gonna be a fucking mess of an ep."

**Swaqqalicious**: "The glitchy vocal edits are pretty cool."

**therokinrolla**: "Y’all may hate but thiis song has the catchiiest giibberiish ever(excludiing bad romance)"

**BreezySeason**: "I know everyones gonna drag kiiara but this song is real different. also OOFASFALIN LEMELU ME I JUS KNOW"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's such a damn shame that this song (actually, the entire EP in general) is so going out on the first day because a lot of people don't like Kiiara's style, which is understandable. But Gold is very cacthy and quite unique to me."

**SkyBlade79**: "Good Song. Yes. Very Good. The gibberish can be offputting to some but I love it, and her voice is very pleasant. The lyrics surely have some kind of deeper meaning locked behind them. The production is also really cool, especially the hats. Unfortunately, y’all just LOVE to hatejerk it."

**blasifeelsswift**: "okay i love this so much, glitch pop is like my new favourite thing. Genius says this is a “cocky tell-off to a negligent lover” and i don’t really get that? Also she says she was gonna call this W.E.L.Y.K. and thank god she didn’t. Also, yas @kiiara getting it with the brother yass girl go be a thot. Still don’t get her weird obsession with basements but gurl you do you"

**LandonKidatrea**: "One great thing about this song is that if they want to put it in The Sims they wouldn't have to change the hook at all."

**skargardin**: "Kiiara’s voice is good but I just can’t stand the chopped up vocals."

**enecks**: "This is the musical equivalent to those videos that jumble around Obama speech soundbites to make it sound like he thinks Drake is a top 5 rapper. Oh wait he actually said that? Well, this is still a shitty sub-YouTube poop mess of a song."

**whatsapilot**: "What the even What this FUCK remotely intelligible shit? TO SING has a chorus is These The ones pretty much this is an amazing lyrics. IMPOSSIBLE For all of those are absolutely which are of course!! kind atrocious too glitchy of pop song ALONG TO? It's just that's -- reasons, track."

**thefighter987**: "i appreciate the experimentation but she doesn’t pull it off"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "cool and creative and good"

**superr_rad**: "this is a post-verbal experience, so im rating it higher than it deserves probably"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I mean, this isn't good but it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets either"

**CloggingToilets**: "I listen to foreign music too, I don't need to know what people are saying to appreciate good music ^"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Y'all can hate on this song all you want, I love this shit. This song is my one claim to hipster cred, I found this song before anybody knew who Kiiara was. I love her voice and melodies, and for really simple lyrics they're actually pretty meaningful and paint a great picture; 'I could leave a party without ever letting you know' is such a succinct summation of having the self-respect to ditch a toxic and asymmetrical and negligent relationship, I really like this song."

**twat_brained**: "“Betty couldn’t make it. So, she sent me instead”"

**calltehshots**: "This is a bop idc."

**ImADudeDuh**: "This legitimately might be my least favorite song of all time. I fucking hate this song with a burning passion. This song is basically Fancy by Igloo Australia, but not catchy or fun whatsoever. Fuck this song."

**Yatcho**: "GOOSE IS FLYING ALLAH OH FLYING ALLAH NO"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "when pentatonix can sing the hook to your song live and you just walk around on stage when it comes on, you have a problem girl"

**camerinian**: "Welcome to the worst pop chorus of the decade drinks are to your right existential dread is to your left and the crushing reality that you still have to listen to another 5 tracks from this talentless wannabe of everything wrong with modern pop music is STRAIGHT AHEAD BABY"

**leafsnash61**: "Just terrible. Nothing works about it. How was this a hit?"

**dolantello**: "this song is ass"

This song is another example of Felix Snow chopping up Kiiara's vocals into some incomprehensible sound and it doesn't really work for me (although, the drop is pretty cool). As for the rate, I'm actually shocked how this has turned out so far. Kiiara has ONE SONG left, and *CLOSER* of all things is not even out yet! As much as I dislike this song, I have to admit that she's been done wrong in the rate up to this point. 

---

I feel bad for **Awhile2**, has his 11 done well in any rate ever?? : "This drop is insane, and the bridge is holy, but knowing /r/popheads this is being cut day one" 

storytime with **patronsaintofaspies** (NOT CLICKBAIT): "i was listening to this song, sipping on my lemonade. suddenly, as kiiara sang 'sippin on my tennessee' the ghost of my high school statistics teacher rose from the floor and howled 'how many possible ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word tennessee? how many possible ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word tennessee? how many possible ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word tennessee?!"

This is **bliamc**'s guilty pleasure: "I feel embarrassed for kinda liking it. Once it gets going, it’s pretty catchy." **SriX23** also gives a glowing review: "certified bop, sounds like something Tinashe would make imo"

**SkyBlade79**: "Though the lyrics and deliverance second verse ('I like the color red, so I let it bleed') and the bridge ('Do you remember when they bowed to us like kings, my friend?') are epic and above what we've heard so far, the first verse seems shallow and pointless. However, I really like the drop and the production is good, as always. The bridge is also god tier. Inb4 all of the other comments are about how it sounds like she says “ew”."

**blasifeelsswift**: "1 minute too long, i was gonna give it a 9 instead of a 10 but i realized this is going out the first day because you all have no taste so me giving it a 10 is not gonna matter so fuck it and i’m a slut for kiiara so. This track kind of confuses me bc the vibe I get from it is they thought we were shit watch us take over the world, but Kiiara says that is about i walk into a room full of people i know and i just don’t give a shit and then when i look at the lyrics is just all of that plus a little bit of yearning for something we don’t have"

**TonyRealm**: "As a lover of chopped vocals and sound effects, I am vigorously biased but this is right up my alley."

---

A few people who generally didn't like (that's putting it lightly) low kii savage found this OK at least:

**skiddos**: "Her voice isn't annoyingly manipulated in here so that's a bonus, and I can actually understand what she's saying for once!"

**MrSwearword**: "her white girl thug shtick is annoying as fuck but this beat is really good."

**Altiondsols**: "i actually like this. i was surprised too, especially since i listened to this track last and i was not in the mood to start liking kiiiiara. it sounds like it achieved the sound that Gold fucked up trying to do."


---

At the same time, the song seems to be generally disliked, with the same recurring complaints about her vocals and the production:

**dirdbub**: "I don't exactly understand what the point of this song is but either way weak ass drop"

**Spanksalot2**: "'all these bitches on the internet' she sings, as I continue to bitch about her music on the internet"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "pls stop this is too much bad music I need my 0... but hey at least the song is 4:20 long BLAZE IT"

**Nfranklin50**: "Do you think the collective state of Tennessee even realizes this song exists?"

**zamomattel**: "I just cannot that 4 minutes felt like the length of the entire lord of the rings trilogy"

**Wailordfan**: "I feel like she is kinda the Great Value brand of Rihanna? Her production is not that great. I don't know. None of this has replay value to me yet."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "that bridge kinda kills it"

**skargardin**: "Again the chorus drags an otherwise solid track down."

**enecks**: "Stop doing shitty chopped up vocal samples."

**camerinian**: "I initially thought this was a terrible pun on drinking Hennessy before I remembered that Tennessee Whiskey is actually a thing so this track gets an extra point just out of my own embarrassment"

---

and finally the pickup lines

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song is not the only 10 I see xd"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "ur the only 10 i see"

There it is - perhaps the most infamous track in /r/popheads history is out. Just take a look at that controversy score. Being by far the biggest hit of the rate, you guys understandably had tons to say about this (like multiple literal ESSAYS, i can't even fit them all in this post) so I'll put all of the comments in separate posts.

bluehxrizon: ---
**PuggleMaster**: "To stop the hate"

**dirdbub**: "okay when I first sent this score in, I was okay with this song but with each passing day it's digging into my soul and I am slowly dying because of this please get this off of the charts I swear to fucking CHRIST IF THISS ONG AND THE FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE SONG CHART AT THE SAME TIME I WILL ACTUALLY DIE"

**skiddos**: "The lyrics of this song are so damn cheesy but this song is honestly not terrible"

**gannade**: "i love you halsey but drew cant sing at at all"

**Hyperiok**: "Indisputably iconic track"

**MrSwearword**: "Drew can’t sing, Halsey deserved better and this song has some of the fucking worst lyrics in existence. Also, the production is fucking atrocious. #FuckThatRoverLine"

**Reifiui**: "I can't believe how much I hate every single part of this, every single one. The vocals, with Halsey being as boring as ever but who sounds GREAT compared to the guy, good god he sounds awful, the production with synths that seem to try to always have the worst combo of tone and note to sound atrocious, and since they're 90% of the song most of the time I can't even avoid them... And then there's the lyrics, I have no idea what they tried to do, I think they wanted to do a thing like 'they wanted to get back together but they remember all the reasons they broken up to begin with' with the hook but there's no resolution to it, they just show an element of self-awareness and do nothing, they don't continue in spite of their realizations or back down because of it, they just ignore those for absolutely no reason. Also is it just me or is it kinda weird how Halsey's character is the only one that seems really desperate and doesn't say anything bad about the guy? It really seems like a bro-douche fantasy with how the guy basically insults the girl but she's still begging to keep him without saying anything bad back."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is 100% bound to be the most divisive song in the rate. When I heard it drop, I knew people were gonna be love or hate. For me, I'm all love. I don't particularly like Halsey, but this by far my favorite contribution from her. And, yes, the dude from the Chainsmokers sucks at singing. However, it's barely singing on here, it's almost talking, which services the track very well. It has what I could argue is the best chorus of 2016, because I could recite it from memory after one quick listen. The instrumental is one of the best things they've done, it's like they took their formula and churned out the best combination possible, and damn it flows. The verses are memorable as well, and the pre-chorus is so good it could almost be its own chorus. It's both the anthem for high school white trash douches and basic rich clubgoers."

**SriX23**: "idgaf what this sub thinks, I really like this song now"

**Spanksalot2**: "I don't hate it but it's not good either. Even ignoring that it's been overplayed so much, it's just not a great song. Production is pretty boring, lyrics are boooooring, vocals are boooooooooooring. The drop is kinda catchy but that's pretty much it."

**letsallpoo**: "Fuck you all"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "I don't completely hate this tbh"

**Altiondsols**: "overplayed"

**banananaise**: "BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA BWA we are never getting older"

**MNREDR**: "The rhymes are pretty forced and I can't get over the fucking do-do-do-do."

**TonyRealm**: "The part I dislike most is the tinny synth melody after the chorus, it drives me nuts. The rest of the production is the usual: exceptionally safe but upbeat enough to bop to. I actually enjoy Andrew’s vocals more than Halsey’s, but her presence doesn’t cause harm. I find the lyrics more amusing than anything else, but a certain segment of the audience will love them, and considering how many of my friends who don’t even listen to music know this song, the Chainsmokers are doing something right."

**OberionSynth**: "still a bop no matter what"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Stop trying to say Closer is good. It’s not good."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "OK so longass essay coming up. I love this song. It's in my top 20 favorite songs from 2016. It's chill, but fun, you can bop to it, but it's still great. My only problem with the song was that it was waay to overplayed. It has anything else. I like Drew's studio vocals(yeah he isn't a Freddie Mercury but he still has a decent human singing voice), and Halsey works well on the track. The production was great for the first time I listened to it. To be honest, when the song came out in late July I was in the first 100k viewers. I thought it was going to be a great underdog song after Don't Let Me Down and Roses. Never thought it would become the biggest song of 2016. It's a down-to-earth song with a comfy feeling. I'm pretty somewhat it became big, because I wanted this to be my niche song. But oh well. Also, I think the song gets too much hate. It's sure not a '12 weeks on #1' song, but it isn't a god-awful heresy either. This song was in my top 5 summer jams last year, and I think it deserves my 10. Probably this will go out first, because popheads like giving shit to a decent song that becomes successful if it isn't from their faves. I'm pretty sure that for the first month most people liked this song, it was #1 for 3 months for a reason. So I hope my essay won't be seen on the first day, but if it happens, I will still keep you in a secret box deep in my heart, Closer. Thank you for making me happy when I was in a bad mood with your fresh summer vibes, and bite that tattoo on my shoulder. We ain't never getting older, my sweet prince."

**Nfranklin50**: "I honestly would have given this my 11 if Roses didn't exist. I just happened upon this legend of a song the day the lyric video for it was released. The first time i heard it I said to myself that this song was gonna be big. I played it for a good week nonstop. This song gives me feelings of grandeur I've never experienced but I want to. I think this song was so popular because growing up in the aesthetic age this is a story people envision for themselves because 'aesthetic' or 'goals' and I sympathize with that. This song is literally the millennial anthem. It's fun and Drew's timbre is very interesting to say the least but it actually works and Halsey absolutely kills it. We need more collaborations with the conversation that actually goes on between the people singing. It gives the song way more depth than other songs where the lyrics makes no sense because the people don't acknowledge each other until the climax of the song. Its a nice touch on this legend of a song."

**Uber-A**: "No."

**poppinmmolly**: "bite me this is a good song"

**berober04**: "Hey. I wonder if I'm going to have to defend this 11? By definition, no other song on this rate has bopped for me as much as Closer. I love the dual narrations, I love the drop, I love that Halsey looks like Victoria from Life is Strange. This song gets better every time I listen to it, and since I never disliked it in the first place, we end up in this narrative. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go book a flight to Tuscon."

**franch**: "because there was a serious thread on /r/popheads recently about this being a candidate for song of the decade."

**omgcow**: "Honestly when this song first came out I had it on repeat for days and I was OBSESSED with it, then it was everywhere and I got tired of it, but now I love it again. I live in Boulder and I hear this at every party/kickback I go to. (which isn't many but still!)"

**wearingsox**: "I can see why this became a hit, solid summer song"

**zamomattel**: "So simplistic, it's catchy but just so unambitious I just can't get down to it as it's kind of dull after hearing it a billion times"

**Wailordfan**: "Fucking amazing, and one of the songs of our generation no matter how you look at it. I have loved this song since the beginning, and think it is hella impressive what they've accomplished with it."

**jimmy345960**: "i listened to this on an airplane at like 4am the day it came out and i loved it since"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I’ll admit that the overplay probably affected my viewpoint of this song but I don’t care, I legitimately despise it. The instrumental is so empty and generic, Drew Taggart can’t sing, the lyrics are basic, the melody on the prechorus is beyond grating and the rhymes are so forced, Halsey’s vocals are dull, the drop is weak, there’s literally no part of this song I don’t hate. Like I don’t wanna be that guy but I really don’t know how anyone gets enjoyment out of this song, much less enough to get it that long of a stay at the top of the charts. It’s painful."

**bliamc**: "The devil in a pop song. The dick measurer’s part is douchey, and Halsey makes the best of her shitty part. Can’t stand it."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "this is as overplayed at shit but i imagine i'll look at it slightly more fondly when i'm 30 and retweeting memes so i'll give it a decent score"

**leviOHsa**: "Ummmmm dramatic eye roll"

bluehxrizon: **ExtraEater**: "I honestly just eat up nostalgic songs, but writing songs about nostalgia is a dangerous thing. Sometimes, it comes off as unbearably cheesy (Unbelievable by Owl City, just to name one) or it comes off as a sort of reunion anthem that unites the people it applies to and the young that may listen to it. To me, Closer rides the latter path and chants romantic tunes for the young and lively whilst reminding (almost) everyone else of a distant, love-ridden past, even if they still have some ehh parts shoehorned in (('that Blink-182 song')). The instrumentals are very easy to pick out as 'trendy', but once I ignore that, it creates this weird, but nice atmosphere. The climax especially after Halsey belts(?) out we ain't ever getting older was nicely built up to and bops the best, too. Is Closer timeless? Not at all, it will probably date in 8 seconds, but the message is clear. 'We ain't ever getting older...' /// Also, ever since /r/popheads, I surprisingly came out of the sub finding it hard to genuinely hate any music (still hate some tho, I ripped apart Charli's Paradise). So thanks for that! Y'all taught me love and kindness even tho most of you are ruthless😘"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Hey, I was doing just fine before this song. I feel like I should grab a noose and end it, but that’s okay. Hey, tell Drew that his ass can’t sing and he should stop before he starts again. You, tell Halsey her tumblr can’t save this and she is terrible at Blink 182 in malls, but that’s okay."

**therokinrolla**: "Say what you want, this song is incredibly impressive with its top 10 billboard streak and number 1 spot streak. Halsey is also really good in this song, I just hate that Drew started singing with this song"

**BreezySeason**: "If this isn't last I will be disappointed. On the verse Halsey sounds like shes been thrown in a cupboard, rovers are naff cars as well and who bloody steals mattresses like even how does the logistics of that work like come on guys what is wrong with you just go to ikea or something you people, mattress for barely anything and you don't have to live with the guilt of stealing. here's a better cover https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDi286SFsBE"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I remember being super salty over this song just like the rest of /r/popheads because this song blocked Bruno, Weeknd and Gaga (Okay maybe not Gaga because Perfect Illusion is not a radio-friendly song but I wanna be a petty hoe). However, as soon as the song is declining in popularity, I have began to apperciate the song much more that I ended up giving this a 9. The lyrics were pretty heartbreaking, even though some of them can get pretty meme-y. Please don't tell past Doc circa September-December 2016 that I actually like Closer now."

**SkyBlade79**: "The flagship of both the charts and the EP, this is the only semi-unique track. An ode to the fratboy, partying lifestyle, it's the story of a guy who meets up with his ex at a party, and the rest is history. Sung by Drew Taggart and Halsey, a major alternative popstar who I know will regret this eventually, it's no surprise that it's at the top of the charts. It has everything a radio-friendly EDM song should have; 'relatable' lyrics, like 'Stay and play that Blink-182 song/That we beat to death in Tucson, okay', a singable melody, and The Chainsmoker's signature lazy drop. I do appreciate how good the production goes along with the vocals in the pre-chorus, but that's probably the only reason that I can tolerate this song. Furthermore, Halsey's voice really carries this song; it's very obvious that Drew has little to no singing prowess, so of course she would upstage him."

**blasifeelsswift**: "This is good, it manages to tell a story so specific but still makes you feel like it’s your story. The drops are good and well timed. I know most of you probably hate this. Also this."

**LandonKidatrea**: "Uhmm, actually Tucson is in AZ not OK"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Disgusting but ok."

**skargardin**: "I just can’t stand Drew’s singing and the lyrics about the whole mattress and roommate in Boulder thing is just laughable, even Halsey can’t save this trainwreck and that’s why I give this my zero."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Despite every individual aspect of this song not working at all on paper (from Drew and Halsey's weak vocals, the cheap sounding production, the basic melody, and weirdly specific lyrics), after 8 months of this dominating the airwaves I am finally ready to admit that it all comes together well. We ain't ever getting older-der-der-der."

**enecks**: "It's a song that accurately portrays how messy the central relationship is with some clunky lyrics, a silly drop, and some bad vocals. It's a song that uses its flaws to its advantage. It's a messy song that uses the messiness intentionally. It's a song masquerading behind so many layers of irony and messiness that I can't tell if it's the best or worst song of 2016. What the fuck happened to my life that resulted in me giving this a 10? Is it the hormones, the self-doubt, the lack of trust I have with other people, the socioeconomic chaos of the modern era, the divisive and vile political climate, transitioning genders, or is it the cosmos aligning in a certain way?"

**whatsapilot**: "This song is just unbelievable. How controversial this is, how much drama there is around it, how huge it is, all unbelievable. For me it's just a stupid little song that does what it's supposed to do. Both the lyrics and the production are pretty simple but they get the job done. This song is catchy af and surprisingly relaxing, despite the bad vocalists. That being said, I don't think it's good enough to be the massive hit it is, with one of the most impressive Hot 100 runs of all time. Closer is not a masterpiece or anything, it's not even great. It's just enjoyable enough for me to like it as a pop song."

**thefighter987**: "This song is literally satan."

**jamesfog**: "Hey hey hey HEYYYY👋👋👋 Put cha ciggies up🚬🚬🚬 smokers in the house 🏠 owwwwww😷!"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "perfectly fine ignoring all the over exposure"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This does not deserve the massive love and hatred that it gets. Still a bop though."

**superr_rad**: "Halsey is the best part of this song. I got really annoyed with how this song hoarded #1 but I gotta give respect where its due. Every part of this song is a hook! Like it's pretty rad actually. I hope someone uses this opportunity to make a joke about her new album name"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "You guys are fucking haters this song is incredbile and I wish it was #1 for 10 more weeks"

**JohnnyToby**: "tbh deserves top 3 I mean it’s literally a masterpiece"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Man this song. I actually like it, but dear lord the synths are ａｃｔｉｖｅｌｙ ｔｅｒｒｉｂｌｅ, seriously if they used anything else this would be an amazing song but the synths kill it so fucking bad. And it's a shame because this song brings out the good side of Halsey which rarely comes out."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Listen guys I know this has been overplayed but take a step back and relisten to it, cuz this is a great song. The washy builds, the punchy chords, the stuttering claps, the anthemic melodies, the monster synth lines, the emotion-filled call and response duet, the irresistible hooks, and just the general we-should-know-better-but-fuck-it youthful vitality of the song are all completely infectious. Life's too short to dislike something just cuz it's popular."

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "This was one of the closest contentions for my 11 out of the rates I've done. Nearly every album had a song I was considering for my 11. Why Closer? I honestly couldn't say. Maybe it's a mix of actually liking the song and Stockholm Syndrome, but I think the song really shines with how specific and personal the lyrics are. I guess that the alternative argument is that the lyrics can be too detail oriented and meaningless, but I like that a lot more than lyrics that can just be generalized to anyone. It's by no means a perfect song and I'm not sure if I'd agree with anyone who tries to argue otherwise, but I feel the rough parts of the song (a few of the lyrics mainly) help build on the song's theme (although I do wish that they were a little better written)."

**twat_brained**: "WE AIN’T EVER GETTING OLDER!!!!!! Every time I hear this song I’m brought back to the first time I heard it. Sidenote, duetting this with my sister at karaoke is on my bucket list. xD 11/11 HALSEY YOU ARE A FUCKING GODDESS"

**calltehshots**: "I've come to not hate this song anymore. It's a bop. We're all pressed bc all our faves flop lol."

**ImADudeDuh**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeMAL-YwQKs"

**Yatcho**: "So hard to rate this song in any kind of objective way. The memes, the chart domination, the cringy video and live performances, 'FUCK YOU BALD BITCH'. On one hand i hate it, on the other I cant not sing it when it's on. What the hell just take your 10 for having me so conflicted"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "at the very least, I'd rather listen to this than Shape Of You shrug"

**SpanKKy1**: "Play that Blink-182 song"

**camerinian**: "One day, after the dust and overplay have settled, this will be looked back upon as a pop classic from a group who, after time passes, will probably be massively hated for being the blandest amalgamation of EDM ever."

**leafsnash61**: "If you asked me 'Name one song that best describes what 7.5 is, it's Closer."

The first non Kiiara/Chainsmokers song is *finally* out, and its "Paradise" by Charli XCX featuring PC music artist Hannah Diamond. I'll admit that this is kind of a bop - the verses sound sweet and the drop bangs - but the pitched vocals completely turn me off from the song. 

---

I wasn't the only one who didn't like the vocals:

**MrSwearword**: "Cute but can’t score higher because of the annoying voice that hopefully wasn’t all Charli’s."

**Reifiui**: "Why did they pitch shift the fucking hook this was such a dumb decision"

**Spanksalot2**: "not a big fan of the high pitched vocals but that drop is just too good"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Hannah killed Charli on her own shit. This song lost a whole point by overusing chipmunk vocals."

**TonyRealm**: "From Vroom Vroom to this? By far the most pure pop song on the EP, it reminds me of the happy hardcore genre, which I’m already not a fan of. The drop isn’t appealing to me, and I don’t like the pitched vocals of the chorus; they aren’t terrible, but they are worse than both Charli’s and Hannah’s regular vocals, so I wish there was just more of that."

**skiddos**: "She forgot to credit The Chipettes"

**Wailordfan**: "The rapid build up with the muffled beat is sexy and makes me slick. I love this shit man. The synthesized vocals that sound childish get a little annoying after awhile though."

**gannade**: "never work with hannah diamond again please"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Cool production, but a ballad with pitched vocals just doesn’t work for me."

**Nfranklin50**: "This was really good until it became a crazy frog song"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Kill me. This is shit. Like my head actually hurts listening to this. Like Jesus, whoever did the production on this should uninstall life. Also don’t even start me on Hannah Diamond, she a mess and a half too."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Stop pitch shifting sis"

**camerinian**: "That chipmunk voice over the chorus really isn’t very good is it. Everything else slaps (especially yo girl on the feature), but that one thing kills it"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "That high voice in the chorus is so grating, and the production ranges from really cool when the beat actually drops to really boring and cheesy during the verses, but Hannah Diamond's voice is as beautiful as ever which is what saves this song."

**SkyBlade79**: "This is such a strange, electrotrance collaboration between Charli and Hannah Diamond. It definitely had potential, but the electronically high-pitched choruses ruin the song for me. The outro, however, is extremely nice to listen to; I almost wish that the entire song was more like that. The production on Paradise is almost like the happy intro music to an anime mixed with trippy trance; it sounds awesome, even though it’s really messy."

**TragicKingdom1**: "The pitch-shifted vocals seem kinda cheap, but very catchy and Hannah fits perfectly."

**superr_rad**: "I would like this song if the baby voice wasnt used"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "Wow this is kinda super annoying at first"

**RandomDKguy**: "what's this? Charli and the chipmunks?"

**jimmy345960**: "ummmmm... i hate this voice"


---

It seemed like most people who didn't mind the vocals enjoyed this track:

**dirdbub**: "this is super good! iconic bubblegum pop right here"


**whatyourheartdesires**: "It took me a while to get PC music but now I really appreciate it and this song is even better than Vroom Vroom"

**Awhile2**: "one of SOPHIE’s best drops"

**berober04**: "This is so close to being the 2016 Eurodance song we deserve, instead of just being the one we need right now"

**thefighter987**: "some of the best production I’ve ever heard on a pop song."


**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Another track I've been listening to forever since it leaked. Hannah Diamond is the best pop artist on the come up, imo, and on here, she steals the show. This is trademark SOPHIE, and it's truly a banger. I wish it was a little more interesting in the verses, but that chorus is just bonkers."

**franch**: "hannah diamond = auto 10"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** doesn't know what to think about this: "I kinda like the beat on this but I’m not sure whether the vocals are terrible or not so I’m just confused"

---

**ExtraEater** has an interesting take on this track: "Oh dear. In rates, I never use my 0 and the ones that I have used were just at a time when I felt obligated to have one. Honestly no song is that bad for me that I'll give it that low a score on a rate, and from being on /r/popheads I surprisingly find it hard to hate any music now. But this song is the first I'd actually give a 0. Paradise genuinely made me uncomfortable on a level almost no other song has given me. I mean right off the bat is a very off-putting pitched voice, off-putting especially as someone unfamiliar with PC Music. I just want to say, whenever it comes to music, one of the key reasons I love it is the opportunity for escapism. Paradise just comes off as uncomfortably fake, a futuristic cyber style, but the machines are 'happy' objects that just gained sentiency but are still binded by some code that keeps them restricted and--since they're living now--suffering. I'm not going to lie when I say a lot of PC Music has this unsettling effect in various degrees for me. Paradise forcefully throws me in some pink computerized paradise party with a bunch of partygoers, but the aesthetic is uncomfortably still and the partygoers are secretly misshapen robots simulated to look like humans. It's catchy, but it does the opposite of resonate once I've finished listening to it--It remains within its own world and I wonder what glitch wonderland the fuck I just went into and I forget about it. To top it all off, this is a pretty fair departure from the rest of the album, in which the songs are less cheery and the PC Music production remains dominant but not as much as Paradise. I will certainly *not* generalize about PC Music just from this song, since I haven't delved deep into it at all (heard BIPP, was ehh on it). Of course, this is all my opinion and I completely get why people would like this or PC Music."

now a compilation of comments i felt needed to be highlighted


**OberionSynth**: "I was shocked that she featured Alvin and the Chipmunks and then it just faded into a song that would be featured in a Degrassi season finale dance scene at prom or something"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Best Alvin and the Chipmunks song but still sucks."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This would fit really nicely into a lesbian movie soundtrack."

**mokitsu**: "I love nightcore"

**enecks**: "This is like the theme song to the best anime of the season. This is so nightcore."

**JohnnyToby**: "lana did it better also tag yourself im the high ahh in the chorus"

**Dracyoshi**: "Am I listening to Charli XCX or Alvin and the Chipmunks? I can't tell."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I can't believe Charli got both Nightcore and Vocaloid on one track! An icon!"

**Average:** 6.416 // **Controversy:** 1.850 // [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=189KiD_4RWg)

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x5) bluehxrizon, blasifeelsswift, BearlyEvenAPun, 4Roux, mindnoises (9 x8) TonyRealm, calltehshots, jimmy345960, whatsapilot, lordpraisewifi, Kaphox, Awhile2, CloggingToilets (8.8 x1) Death_Soup (8.7 x2) patronsaintofaspies, twat_brained (8.5 x3) gannade, bluewaffles72, JohnnyToby (8.1 x1) JunkyGS 

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x2) ExtraEater, Altiondsols (3 x2) johnazoidberg-, MrSwearword (3.5 x1) CandlePrince (3.7 x1) dirdbub 

---

And with that, Kiiara is officially eliminated from the rate. I'm not sure if anyone foresaw her doing so poorly, barely surviving halfway through DAY 1. On top of that, The Chainsmokers are still in despite seemingly being more hated on the sub. I'm surprised to say the least. BTW: Carly, Hailee, Bridgit, and Poppy still have all songs in so far!

On this song: my favourite Kiiara track by far! It's the only one on low kii savage that doesn't feature Felix Snow's irritating production, and it shows. This track feels more *full* and finished than any other on the EP to me, so I'm sad to see this go so soon.

---

So first we have the kind, generous souls

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Instrumental here is so good it's unfair. Chorus is just super catchy and she actually enunciates for once!"

**TonyRealm**: "Oh God, “never my intention, no” is gonna be stuck in my head forever. But seriously, for such a repetitive chorus, the track does an excellent job at keeping it interesting."

**Spanksalot2**: "first song here that's pretty good, probably because it's the only song on the EP not produced by this Felix Snow guy, whoever that is"

**skiddos**: "I'm inflating this score but this song is definitely ha best. This is the only song on the EP not touched by F*lix Snot. Definitely not a coincidence"

**SkyBlade79**: "kiiara's melodic vocals are even better than normal on this track, reminding me slightly of Revival era Selena Gomez. The song starts out weak, but gets stronger and stronger as it goes on. The clipped vocal samples are slightly off-putting, but they can be overlooked. Her songwriting isn't remarkable on this song, but it's certainly not bad."

**twat_brained**: "Kiiara seems to have an affinity for brooding, lo-fi beats. I’m on board with this!"

**jamesfog**: "ok i didnt like kiiara bc of the sub but she is bringing bops to the table"

**blasifeelsswift**: "simple and straight forward, really appreciate it."

---

And now the people who want to watch this rate burn to the ground

**dirdbub**: "if your intention was a muddy ass song that makes me barely hear your voice throughout parts of it, then good job. if not then thank you anyways, it's at least slightly bearable then"

**MrSwearword**: "this is boring as fuck and the production swallows her whole."

**johnazoidberg-**: "I'm starting to understand why Kiiara is a one hit wonder."

**Altiondsols**: "i absolutely loathe the sound of this woman's voice. why does she think that squeaky thing she does at the end of every line sounds good?"

**Awhile2**: "of course the worst song on the EP is the only one not produced by felix snow"

**MNREDR**: "Sounds like Feels but lower and even more boring."

**OberionSynth**: "this literally just sounds like Gold, Part 2"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "finally a somewhat decent song but this voice filter is killing me...also her 'jah' sounds like that 'kid on crack' meme"

**franch**: "this song's rate went down as it went on. way too long."


**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "My scores for this EP are going down as it goes on because these songs are just so nothing"

**bliamc**: "Without weird chopped up vocals, her songs are pretty boring."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I total didn’t give this a higher score so my entry would count…"

**therokinrolla**: "the giibberiish duriing thiis song iis much worse than Gold, lessbereal"


**enecks**: "Around this point in listening to this EP, I got a headache. Not because this is the worst song, far from it."

**superr_rad**: "too much autotune tbh. her voice is so processed its like those walmart ice cream sandwiches that DONT MELT"


**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this bitch does the same damn voice distortion hook shit for every song lmfao / it's like Kristen Stewart biting her lip and breathing awkwardly in every movie she's in"

bluehxrizon: #Kiiara - low kii savage

---
**Average Score: 5.872** 

---


**dirdbub**: this EP is basically the musical equivalent of drawing [that fancy S in middle school](http://i.imgur.com/eCXqwbX.jpg) and saying you're an artist

**BreezySeason**: I think it has solid production and nice vocals but i know it will get dragged. Just please, I hope popheads drags chainsmokers more

**Cryomatic**: This entire EP sounds like it's blaring in the background of some college party late into the night, spread out somewhere in the middle of the playlist as filler so the prominent songs have space to breathe. It should stay there.

**TonyRealm**: Best EP title in this rate. The song quality is a bit inconsistent, but I think she’s carved out her niche, and definitely gathered a lot of fans with this debut.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Uh, low kii savage seems to be quite, er, divisive. I can totally see why people don't enjoy it very much. Felix Snow's production is strange, and not in a PC Music way. Still, I enjoyed the overall experience of listening to such a different production style, so I gave the EP pretty high scores.

**Swaqqalicious**: Just kind of boring to me. Nothing popped out as particularly good. Only thing that I really liked "SIPPIN ON THAT TENNESSEE".

**BlasiFeelsSwift**:  i’m already prepared for the whole ep to go out the first day BECAUSE Y’ALL HAVE NO TASTE AT ALL. I’m like 99,99% sure she’s a product somebody in a record label created because the girl has no personality at all and doesn’t even know how “her” songs were made so there’s that. I don’t care tbh, if she’s a product i’m buying it. Like she’s like this new version of teen angst that’s not so cringeworthy and that is something I admire. Also can we take a moment to admire the singles cover art: 100/10

**Albert_Cole**: How is it actually possible to perform these songs live? They're basically instrumentals.

bluehxrizon: # #26: American Kids - That Poppy

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x2) FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, PuggleMaster (2 x2) chris_ou_poitrine, Wailordfan 

---

The first song by That Poppy is out, and its the controversial "American Kids". I really enjoy the production and melody of this song, although its not my favourite on Bubblebath. I'm not usually someone to pay close attention to lyrics, but they seemed to cause a lot of grief based on the comments. 

---

As mentioned, the lyrics were a problem for a lot of people:

**johnazoidberg-**: "I think I dropped my score on this song 3 times while I was listening to it. The lyrics are the opposite of Money - Money was smart and dry, this song is trying to throw its message in your face so much I think I pulled a face muscle by cringing too hard"

**Altiondsols**: "pretty good once you get past the lewronggeneration lyrics"

**Awhile2**: "“I am not on drugs and I've never been” ok poppy"

**Death_Soup**: "This would have been slightly higher if the lyrics weren't so pretentious"

**bliamc**: "The lyrics are stupid."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "i love poppy but i really, really hate this song. comes off as super /r/lewronggeneration. one of my two candidates for my 0."

**mokitsu**: "The lyrics are so trash. Poppy is overall a very bad artist. I have trouble believing people genuinely like this"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Am I biased against Poppy? Maybe. Am I like American Kids? DEFINITELY NOT."

**gannade**: "yeah poppy go listen to some lana to learn how to make this song work"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "r/lewronggeneration in a song."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song has an amazing production but it's just a damn shame that the song had some pretty awful lyrics. I have been told that this song is actually satire. Well, if that is what Poppy is trying to do, then she did a really bad job then."

**LandonKidatrea**: "I'm not like those OTHER girls"

---

Meanwhile, others actually appreciated the lyrics, or looked past them:

**MNREDR**: "Jokes aside, this whole EP has been a really pleasant surprise and this track in particular is a standout. The lyrics border on trying too hard to be deep but I dunno, I kinda buy it? This song was made to appeal to 'lewronggeneration' types who don't like to admit that they're 'lewronggeneration' types."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "PSA: If you look up this song on Genius all the annotations are from people who don't understand that this song is satirical and everybody on the comments section is calling out"

**Nfrankin50**: "Am I actually relating to Poppy right now? This is a wild timeline and a really good song"

**dirdbub**: "this song is way more interesting lyrically than it is musically. it offers a ton of insights into Poppy's life, which is painted in a kind of fucked up fashion. great stuff. also I would totally rate this higher but the ending highkey stresses me out and I don't like that"

**skiddos**: "Kinda preachy but it fits Poppy's character"

**MrSwearword**: "“I don’t wanna be like American Kids”/“I don’t care about ur parties” OK Alessia. Seriously, despite the alarming Alessia vibes, That Poppy deserves Your Attention."

**therokinrolla**: "I don’t like the sound of the song at all, but I like the lyrical content about satirizing the idea of shitting on this generation of kids."

**SkyBlade79**: "Now, I love how this satirizes one of my least favorite groups: those “I’m better than you because I don’t like pop culture” kids. The lyrics are really quite great satire, perfectly reflecting the views of those holier-than-thou people, with line like “boys, aren’t even boys anymore”, “Forever 21 is cool if I make it” and that iconic line, “I’m a millennial blame it all on me”. The production does get kind of messy at one point, but that’s okay. I just love how hard this song tries to be as #edgy as the people that it’s talking about are being."

**ExtraEater**: "normally, i don't like satire but poppy does it well. this isn't mocking millenials, it's mocking the mockery of millenials slay queen"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I like the darker vibe here. Gotta like someone who pulls off satire without sounding egregiously preachy."

**twat_brained**: "Great closer. It really captures the essence of today’s youth."

**calltehshots**: "Drag me Poppy!!!"

---

There were a surprising amount of Halsey comparisons as well:

**Wailordfan**: "Honestly? Just seems like a brand designed singer for the alternative kids who aren't trying to be cool by liking Halsey, so they legit just made a song the exact opposite of New Americana. That's just my own idea, but I really feel like this is just a brand singer trying to attract the other kind of alternative millennials who are too cool to try and be cool."

**franch**: "this sort of reminds me of halsey's 'Americana' -- 'I'm a millennial, blame it on me', groce."

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "This song reaches Halsey leves of ham-fistedness."

**Yatcho**: "Halsey who?"

**leafsnash61**: "This reminds me of, like, a Halsey song or something, I dunno."

YALL DID THIS SONG WRONG!!! 😩 My favourite on the EP by far, its surprisingly non generic and interesting compared to the rest of the Collage. I'm listening to Memories... Do Not Open while writing this, and its probably better than anything on that as well. 

---

so here's everyone who's not getting banned

**PuggleMaster**: "I live for this track, I can't believe I slept on this!"

**dirdbub**: "this isn't bad at all, honestly. it's just nothing extraordinary. shout out to XYLØ tho, great music from them"

**skiddos**: "This bangs, my wig is OFF!"

**gannade**: "XYLO is amazing but this song is not"

**Hyperiok**: "I feel this is underrated af by most people"

**my little brother**: "banger" (can we ban him anyway)

**Spanksalot2**: "I went into this expecting to hate every single track but this is decent, more of this in the future pls. These guys really are the best when they let a female guest vocalist do all the vocal work."

**Awhile2**: "This shouldnt have flopped. Miles above paris and the song with coldplay"

**Wailordfan**: "The intro is fucking lit. I'm honestly hoping for the Chainsmokers to do decently in this rate, because a lot of their stuff on this album is honestly pretty great, but will get hurt because people have a pre-set opinion, and will do it a point lower then how they really feel, thinking it won't really hurt them, but when everyone does, it goes from a 7 average to a 6 average, allowing other songs to get higher."

**SkyBlade79**: "The first track, 'Setting Fires', is a good example of the standard Chainsmokers formula: A relatively unknown female vocalist, a good to average melody and verse, and a completely horrible, over-sweet synth centered drop. The first verse and the intro are rather good; The vocalist in XYLO (Seriously, what kind of name is that?) has a rather nice voice, and I appreciate the lyrics, even though they're fairly dull, but it all falls apart with the hypersweet synth 'drop'. XYLO is a brother/sister duo of a producer and a vocalist, so perhaps that’s why the production the verses is better than usual on the verses. Regardless, I have a soft spot for this song. I’m not even sure why, but I quite like it."

**omgcow**: "I love this song and wish they had made it a single. The female vocalist sounds a lot like Selena Gomez to me tho"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "legitimately a great song"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Ok, this is a bop."

**superr_rad**: "i mean its generic EDM at its peak so, i think this is solid"

**leafsnash61**: "Best song on the EP by far."

**Yatcho**: "XYLO is fantastic and this should've been a real single"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Most of this is pretty generic radio pop, albeit fairly enjoyable, but that post-chorus pop drop is really really good, props to the Chainsmokers."

**twat_brained**: "This is a really good first song! I can’t see anything wrong with it!"

**calltehshots**: "This is a bop. Yes I'm giving the dicksmokers a 10 stay mad."

**JohnnyToby**: "really good actually man too bad grandmaheads will tear the chansmokes down"

**BreezySeason** is saved by bribing me with Dua songs again: "I like the vocals but then generic EDM comes along and then the song loses it. Its the equivalent of being presented a chocolate cake and then cutting it and finding that the middle is just a block of cold sticky rice. here's some dua lipa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rey3m8SWQI"

---

now a list of everyone who hates fun

**MrSwearword**: "bearable but they’re nothing more but Calvin Harris clones without the talent."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Meh. It's The Chainsmokers alright but it's not them at their best imo. It really suffers from a case of 'how do I make a song that is both Don't Let Me Down and Closer had a child'. The pre-chorus is great, but the almost all instrumental chorus falls flat on its face."

**gannade**: "XYLO is amazing but this song is not"

**zamomattel**: "Nothing inherently wrong with this song but it's just so boring and unneeded just like the chainsmokers themselves"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Already I have everything I hate the Chainsmokers for on this song: uninteresting instrumental, weak drop, boring basic vocals and lyrics, sooooo generic and it felt like it was about 2 minutes longer then it was"

**bliamc**: "I’ve already forgotten what this song sounds like, it’s so bland."

**leviOHsa**: "There is nothing exciting about this to me, just feels like a filler song."


**blasifeelsswift**: "i don’t like the way she sings feel, heal, etc. The way she drags it higher, it hurts my ears, i’m not joking. It’s also really predictable"

**skargardin**: "I loved this until that awful drop."

**enecks**: "Nah this drop sucks"

**camerinian**: "Holy Christ what an awful intro. I’d probably hate that weak-ass drop more if this thing didn’t already start off on a massive backfoot"

---

and here's some random Britney stanning from **letsallpoo**:"Please tell me I'm not the only one who hears the bridge of 'Mood Ring' in the prechorus of this song. I'M IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND, MY TEMPERATURE IS AT YOUR COMMAND AT MY DEMANDDD"

Collage is officially the second EP to be eliminated! I'm kind of sad ngl, The Chainsmokers were SO close to making Day 2 (that would've been a kick to /r/popheads 's face). At the same time, I'm not a huge fan of this song, although GRAMMY WINNING ARTIST Daya sounds great. 

---

Comments about the various drops of the song:

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Top 3 worst drops: 3) Atlanta dropping the ball during a Matt Ryan sack in Super Bowl L. 2) America dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, 1945. 1) The Chainsmokers - Don't Let Me Down (feat. Daya)"

**TonyRealm**: "Let’s just talk about the drops, shall we? The first one feels so random, like someone else made the drop and challenged them to fit it in a song. I don’t hate it, and it’s pretty hype if you’re in the mood, but it’s weird when you’re sitting in a chair trying to rate the song for reddit when you know Carly’s gonna win. The final “drop” is more in-line with what’s on this EP, but isn’t really a drop at all, and thus is severely lacking in energy. (The Illenium remix has the best drop of them all btw.)"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Best song on this EP but it’s mostly cause I honestly just kind of like how Daya sounds on it, the instrumental is meh and the drop sucks"

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "tbh I just really hate the drop. The song without it might get it a solid 4 or 5, but the drop is just way too offputting for me to look past it"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I hate this song. I hate everything about this song, and this is coming from someone who likes both of these artists individually. I hate the bland sterile reverb-soaked guitar and the wet sponge snare and the boring-ass melody and the totally generic lyrics and the prechorus where every phrase gets said four times said four times said four times yeah said four times now and that FUCKING weak-ass drop where it sounds like a wet rubber chicken was decapitated but hasn't quite died yet so it's just slip'n'slide squirming around on the floor. This song is EDM pop for people who don't have ears. God I hate this song."

**Nfranklin50**: "solid 10 without that stupid drop."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "this could have been way better but the drop is 100% shit"

**BreezySeason**: "WHEN YOU HEAR THE RISING TEMPO AND YOU KNOW TO EXPECT A TRASH EDM DROP SMH. I actually like Daya's voice just go away with the trash basic drops. here's some dua lipa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEOyePhElr4" is it too late to rig this rate so that Dua wins

---

Comments about the song being generally tolerable/praise:

**Spanksalot2**: "this was p much song of the summer in sweden - it was EVERYWHERE and it actually gives me a kind of nostalgia lmao. All in all it's a pretty good track. I usually can't fucking stand Daya but she's alright here, and the drop is great."

**gannade**: "i dont even like this song that much but it gets a 9 for being the only tolerable song on radio back when it was played, and the verses are nice before the beat drops"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Almost good but the production is so weak."

**franch**: "all this shit sounds the same. it's pleasant enough but i'm so over it"

**camerinian**: "I have never gotten sick of this song but I don’t think I’ve ever actively wanted to listen to it."

**bliamc**: "This and Roses are the only not horrendous songs the Chainsmokers have ever made."

**leviOHsa**: "The only Chainsmokers song I've ever downloaded. It's a decent song, but got boring quickly."

**dirdbub**: "I can't believe The Chainsmokers made electro-trap mainstream"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is a bit generic but I honestly think this song is 1000 times better than Closer."

**omgcow**: "Ok I love this song so much. Legitimately one of my favorite singles of 2016. It's one of those 'I want to shake my ass but I also want to cry because of the lyrics' songs for me bc when I first really got into it, I was just about to be dumped by my ex and I could sense it was coming so the line 'running out of time/I really thought you were by my side/now there's nobody by my side' hit me hard, AND 'darling I hope that you'll be here when I need you the most' omg so basically the whole song, it feels like it was written for me so it kinda makes me want to cry but like I said before it's such a bop!! Anyway I love this song and y'all are haters if you drag it just because it's the Chainsmokers and you wanna seem cool to everyone else on popheads"

**Wailordfan**: "Another huge hit, and pretty unique sounding, with enough reminiscent sounds of real instruments to make it super radio friendly, but also super well produced to just kinda mesh really well."

**blasifeelsswift**: "this would have gotten my eleven had Kiiara not been in the rate, I also kind of hate Daya and wish The Chainsmoker hadn’t made her so there’s that. The drop here is legendary tho. Sidenote: i find it really interesting that most of the summary of 2016 kind of videos have this playing in the background."

**poppinmmolly**: "A TRUE BOP"

---

Comments about the song being generally not tolerable:

**PuggleMaster**: "This shit got boring after the 3rd listen"

**MrSwearword**: "Daya does not deserve hate. She can sing rather well for a newcomer. The production’s stink synth and needless thumping pre-come of a chorus does."

**Altiondsols**: "aged rather poorly"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Used to like this a lot more, but I realized that despite having a good amount of buildup to the final drop, the melody, Daya's vocals and just the general loudness of the song don't mesh together well at all."

**JohnnyToby**: "overplay killed this one for me and so did Daya tbh"

---

Daya stanning:

**skiddos**: "I'm happy for Daya and her Grammy I guess"

**letsallpoo**: "Weirdly enough, The Chainsmokers are a lot less interesting when they're pretending to be The xx. Daya is great tho"

**MNREDR**: "+1 for the way Daya sings, 'Darling I hope / that you'll be here / when I need you the most'. -1 for the amateur kazoo-esque melody following."

**Swaqqalicious**: "Daya's singing is amazing, and the final chorus is beautiful. The song was ruined by the cheesy 'bass drop' choruses though. Shame."

**therokinrolla**: "yesss Daya slays in this pre-closer chainsmokers bops"

**SkyBlade79**: "Daya, has a fierce and powerful voice, especially in the bridge. I appreciate her honest efforts, but the drop to this song just sounds so utterly average and predictable that it ruins the track for me. The only time that I consider the production to be half-good on 'Don't Let Me Down', is during the bridge, and the buildup to the next hook after that."


**LandonKidatrea**: "Daya if you're reading this I love you. Also the drop sounds like a deflating balloon."


**thefighter987**: "Daya’s pulls off frustrated insanely well, and the production is tense and cathartic so it matches perfectly"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is the best thing Daya's ever done."

**superr_rad**: "i dont know why, but the drop in this is incredibly annoying to me so i can only listen to remixes of this, but daya's part is really good so"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Grammy Winner Daya"


**twat_brained**: "DAYA SOUNDS SO GOOD HERE!!! I DON’T CARE THAT THE DROP IS DISAPPOINTING I’VE JUST GROWN SO ATTACHED TO HEARING DAYA POUR HER EMOTION INTO THAT FINAL CHORUS SLAYYYYY DAYA BAE-YA"

**Average Score: 6.091**

**BreezySeason**: DRAG DRAG DRAG DRAG DRAG DRAG I REALLY HATE GENERIC EDM ALSO THIS IS THE LOWEST RATING I'VE EVER GIVEN

**TonyRealm**: If I had to describe this EP in one word, it would be “comfortable”.

**franch**: i rly had to listen to this again huh

**dirdbub**: idg why they called this 'Collage' when three of the songs sound the same

**patronsaintofaspies**: Oh, boy. This is the only album in the rate that was outright panned. I personally think that Setting Fires is great, and that Closer and Don't Let Me Down are good but overplayed. The other two songs don't make my ears bleed as much as some other songs do, but, like a lot of Chainsmokers songs, they are extremely mediocre. I can see Drew and Alex's potential, so I hope that they'll step up their game in the future and stop being stereotypical frat bro dickheads.

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: fuck me raw daddies, also stop being lazy and don’t copy yourselves. Also @drew take singing lessons kthxbye. Btw Alex Pall is the hot one don’t @ me hoes

**BearlyEvenAPun**: I never thought I'd enjoy a Chainsmokers song after #selfie, but other than that (and DLMD) I actually feel like I am a fan of their music and I'm glad that they around (dick measuring contests notwithstanding)

ThatParanoidPenguin: I also love kiiara, and in all seriousness, L.O.V.E. really shouldn't be on PRODUCT - it's not meant for listening on headphones because when it's performed live it's absolutely mindblowing. In a way it's sort of a palette cleanser, a really deep and entrancing commanding of attention. It's terribly awful to listen to at any other point.

deleted: Oh that makes sense. Are there any live performances of it out there that show that?

But I got used to L.O.V.E. anyway, I just feel like it's massaging my ears now

LandonKidatrea: Good morning everyone! It's quarter to 6 in the morning where I currently am, and I just woke up. Opened reddit and saw someone mentioned me in a comment. All it said was "explain yourself". I had no idea what that meant until I saw the thread name. So, here I am. With my heart broken before I've even had my fucking coffee. I honestly have half a mind to hack Automod's account and make it spam Chainsmoker songs until this sub implodes. I mean I knew the odds were against me but I didn't think it would be this bad....


TL;DR my 11 is gone. NotLikeThis
