deleted: I'd just like to make it clear to everybody in this sub that this is by far the worst rate we've ever had since the Indie Flop Bullshit Rate.

I can't believe this is the main rate when the moody R&B/Rap one is considered "niche". Even though Kanye, Drake, and The Weeknd all suck, at least those albums had hits. But this? Absolutely hilarious.

All of those artists are either one-hit wonders (CRJ, Hailee Steinflop), a massive flop that only charted because of like two dumb feats (Charli XCX), or just downright pretentious noname trash (That Floppy, Bridgit Mendler). The most relevant EP there, by far and away, is Collage, by the kings of EDM and pop music, The Chainsmokers, which have already tanked in this rate because, as it's been stated multiple times before, this sub is repulsive towards successful artists and good music in general. The same happened with Kiiara, who I didn't know was a vicitm of this sub's oppression as well.

Those EPs contain extremely gross songs about a wide variety of disgusting topics, such as cannibalism (Starving), capitalism (Store, Money), millenial angst (American Kids, Hell Nos and Headphones), stealing people's husbands (Altar), drowning in underwater cities (Atlantis), mind control (Snap My Fingers), and even xenophobia (Higher) because that "every one of my fears is Spanish" line is NOT a "misheard lyric", it's intetionally meant to sound that way. And I can't help but laugh at Love Myself, Hailee Steinflop must really think she invented the art of masturbation. Not to mention all the horrifying sounds that are used, such as those awful screeches in Starving, those ridiculous alien moans in Atlantis, and everything on Vroom Vroom.

Please, That Poppy is such a terrible artist. WTF is that lame attempt at reggae fusion in Lowlife? Poppy should stick to making those creepy videos (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOnSyYdBei4) where she desperately tries to search for any kind of talent, or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVtWvZbqg10) where she makes a list of people who are more relevant than her), because that's all she's even remotely capable of doing. She's trying SO hard to be this generation's Boxxy, and I fucking hate that. "P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy!!" is the new "Hi, my name is Boxxy!", but thankfully Poppy is so useless she can't even accomplish that. She literally talks to plants, and she's even friends with an ugly mannequin who hates her, such a fucking idiot.

And don't even get me started on those weird PC Music creep noises on that Vroom Vroom EP. Starting off with the title track, which is clearly the result of Charli XCX blabbering over noises SOPHIE recorded in traffic. Charli XCX is a "secret" indeed, because no one actually knows who she is, or has ever heard about that EP. No one gets to know about you, Charli. And the only trophy she could even consider winning is one for the biggest flop of all time, but even then Carly Rae Jepsen is here to snub it from her.

Speaking of Ms. Flopson, I guess one E•MO•TION wasn't enough, so she had to make another one. They added 8 lullabies to what's already a MASSIVE snoozefest, including the biggest consumerist anthem ever made. Which is actually pretty ironic. If you're going to use music as propaganda for capitalism, *at least pick an artist that's relevant for capitalism*. I'm pretty sure that if she went to the store with all the money she's amassed with E•MO•TION, she wouldn't even have enough to buy E•MO•TION itself. She'd have to content herself with some shit like Nemesis or HAIZ, which together cost less than 99 cents.

Collage, on the other hand, is an amazing EP. Closer is already a classic and it will go down in history as one of the biggest songs of all time. It's already the biggest song of the decade, after All About that Bass of course. All We Know and Inside Out are both very simple, yet beautiful ballads, with heart-touching lyrics and mindblowing production elements. Setting Fires is an amazingly-produced energetic bop that brings originality to the table, and cleverly invokes concepts of youthfulness and rebelliousness, creating a heartwarming, yet very fun and upbeat atmosphere in a fascinatingly creative way. Don't Let Me Down is the only track that isn't good, even though Daya's original songs are true masterpieces. I guess two great talents sometimes cancel each other.

And I love how Collage is also a work of charity. They kindly selected a group of irrelevant indie flops (Halsey, XYLØ, Charlee, and Phoebe Ryan), and launched them into the music industry, giving all of them a chance to shine in their pathetic careers. But sadly, all of Drew and Alex's efforts were in vain. All of those flops are just talentless losers who can't do anything without The Chainsmokers, so this EP is the peak of their poor existences. I wonder when The Chainsmokers will start working with big names like MTrain and Charlie Puth, people who are actually on par with them in terms of quality, hotness, talent, creativity, and success.

And BTW, low kii savage is a pretty great EP too. She heavily cricizes themes such as murder, social segregation, freedom of speech, depression, drug addiction, and abusive relationships, in a very clever and satirical way. It's a contemporary classic, that album will go down in history as one of the most important pieces of art for its social impact, just wait. Plus, the production elements were very original and creative. How did you eliminate this album first with so much generic bullshit from the likes of Carly, Hailee and Bridgit? One day, The Chainsmokers and Kiiara will collab on the track that's finally gonna break Mariah's record and you're all gonna, as Carly Rae puts it, C R Y Y Y Y. The only reason Kiiara doesn't have more hits is because the music industry is afraid of exposing how ill society is, they don't want to wake people up, so they prefer to promote futile shit like Bruno Mars/Clean Bandit/Rihanna/Drake/etc instead. It makes me cry when potential legends like Kiiara and Colby O'Donis get screwed up by the system.

I wanted to participate in this rate in order to give credit to the truly talented Chainsmokers and Kiiara, and bash all of those ridiculous flops, but I didn't for the following reasons:

a) I actually have a fucking life;

b) the rates are limited to only one 0, and negative scores aren't even allowed, so rating these flops is impossible;

c) you have a predefined "format" for the rates, which is a violation of my freedom and my creative rights to send scores however I fucking feel like just because you're all too lazy to adapt them to your stupid program. It's just another lame attempt by the mods to standardize all of the users here and create behavior patterns to make it easier for them to brainwash everybody. It amazes me how you all let yourselves be treated like sheep without even noticing or being bothered.

And to make things worse, one of the next rates includes Charli XCX AGAIN, as well as two more indie flop albums, courtesy of HAIvMind and Sky Feirrerrieira or however the fuck you're supposed to spell that shit.

All of you suck for liking these flops. I hope that petition to delete /r/popheads goes through.

So great job, you've managed to go one step further into converting all pop fans on the internet into hipsters. But keep in mind that this war is far from over. You're never going to stop me!!! #JUSTICEFORTHECHAINSMOKERS #JUSTICEFORKIIARA #WHEREISTHEPOP #FUCKINDIEHEADS #MTRAINFORLIFE

I think I am giving HAIZ too much credit and will probably have like Starving in the top 10 and loses everything else today.

Vroom Vroom will probably lose 

- Trophy 

- Secret 

even though Trophy is fucking lit bro.

Nemesis will lose 

- Do You Miss me at All

- Snap my Fingers.

Aww, this one actually makes me sad. Hailee's first song out happens to also be one of my favourites from the EP. I find it delivers the same message as Alessia Cara's "Here" (albeit more heavyhanded) but the production from Mattman and Robin really make this song great for me. Everything sounds so soft and 'glowy'; it gives off the feeling of trying to shut everything out and just close your eyes at a party or on the dancefloor. While I understand why /r/popheads didn't really like this song it pains me that this is out already.

---

**Mudkip1** enjoys it as much as I do: "such a good song i bop to it constantly in the car" while **Nfrankin50** appreciates the message: "I love this song because It's the anti social bop I've wanted my whole life. Here is great and I love Alessia but this song is meaner and much more honest so she gets extra points for that." 

**skiddos** has echoes my thoughts on the production: "The production is really soothing. I love to listen to this song when I just want to be alone." idk if **whatsapilot** is channeling their inner 9J1V or what: "I love this. She does a much better job than Alessia Cara at hiding that she's singing about aliens. Great job, Hailee." **jimmy345960** also enjoyed the song, making an Alessia comparison: "This almost got my eleven, if rock bottom didnt exist. I understand why this wasn't released because it is thematically like Alessia Cara's 'Here'. Saying that, this song shits all over that song. At least THIS QUEEN LEAVES THE PARTY."

This hits close to home for **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I had to give this song my 11 because this song hits home really hard for me. I am very well-liked among my friends and I am an extrovert but I have a lot of moments where I feel very left out and I just want to be alone. This song perfectly captures my feelings during those sad times."

A few more people had nice things to say about this track as well: 

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "On first listen I wasn't impressed, but the lyrics are really really good and the melodies and production have grown on me really quickly."

**SkyBlade79**: "I quite like this one. The production is really nice and the message is also pretty cool. Hailee also sounds great. It’s certainly the best song on the EP."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "An inspiring introvert anthem."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "She did that."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "discount Here by Alessia but still good"

**camerinian**: "Wtf why wasn’t this a single that deep house vibe is actually pretty good what"


**gannade**: "amazing"


---

Sadly quite a few people had minor issues with this, or just outright hated it:

**dirdbub**: "holy shit I hate this so much. these lyrics are digging into my soul with how bad they are, they're Chainsmokers level for me. goddamn this is bad"


**MrSwearword**: "This is like an Alessia Cara song but somehow…not better or worse."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Instrumental is really interesting. It sounds conventional at first, but there's a lot of nice little percussion going on. I'm not sure if it totally fits the vocals, but on it's own it's nice. The chorus, unfortunately, is kinda awkward and contrived. Hell noes and headphones doesn't have a ring to it, and it just is really forgettable. The rest of the verses aren't anything special outside of the haa-aaahs which are nice. It sounds like an inferior version of some of her other stuff, unfortunately."

**Cryomatic**: "This song sounds great, but some of the lyrics make it feel a little off, both in how they're pronounced and their content."

**Spanksalot2**: "should be called 'hell no get this trash out of my headphones' amirite"

**Altiondsols**: "Pretty good but Hailee isn't amazing at switching between her low and high registers, unfortunately she does this multiple times per word in this song. Also the verses are a little bit boring. And one of the prechoruses has a thing that sounds like a discord notification which is slightly irritating"

**Awhile2**: "the name of this song is almost as bad as the plot of pitch perfect 2"

**Albert_Cole**: "She sounds like more of a misanthrope than Alessia Cara in Here, but this song is better so..."

**banananaise**: "this song is absurdly unrelatable"

**Death_Soup**: "Aside from making zero sense, it's a decent song."

**TonyRealm**: "A chill anti-party song that is worth a listen, but it doesn’t draw me in enough to make me want round 2. Wacky synth solo too."

**OberionSynth**: "could be a good song, but the 'Hell no's and headphones' hook is kinda weak"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Ok I really despise the chorus of the song but the rest is great."

**wearingsox**: "too similar to Alessia Cara"

**zamomattel**: "Another forgettable track, there's nothing wrong with it, I just think there are a lot of better songs in this rate"

**Wailordfan**: "Honestly? I could totally see this being a Selena Gomez x Taylor Swift girl power duet. The vocal range is perfect for the two, and already has the tempo and power needed for Selena, and would allow Taylor to run that simple chorus. Unfortunately, it is kinda bland. As is, it sounds like a Revival bonus track."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Kind of reminds me of Atlantis tbh, also kind of reminds me of being bored"

**bliamc**: "Who is this song for? Introverts? High school dropouts? Music lovers? Sassy people??"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "aleissa cara who? anyway this and here are my theme songs"

**leviOHsa**: "Forgettable"

**ExtraEater**: "Here but not as good or about aliens"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "This could have been a hard ass fun song. But no man, it’s chill AF. SMH."

**therokinrolla**: "ooh this is groovy. The most interesting track on HAIZ definitely, but the chorus when she says the title does not flow at ALL"

**BreezySeason**: "I think Hailee's vocals are great on this track, and a nice change of pace a bit, but also nothing special"

**blasifeelsswift**: "average, a word that describes both the artist and the ep at the same time. #WhenWillYourFave #HopefullyNever"

**enecks**: "Kinda clunky. The song doesn't flow that well, though I wonder if the messiness is intentional."

**jamesfog**: "Headphones On by Miranda Cosgrove is better!!!"

**superr_rad**: "I just feel like this is trying too hard to be introvert relatable, like when Taylor swift acted like she had a country accent"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "BAFTA Award Nominee Hailee Steinfeld"

**JohnnyToby**: "knock off Here alessia needs to get lawyers"

**DrunkHurricane**: "I honestly can't buy Hailee Steinfeld as this introverted girl who isn't interested in a party."

**twat_brained**: "This is cute. But it precedes 'Starving', which is gorgeous. And gorgeous is gonna, you know, devour cute."

**calltehshots**: "I haaaaate 'I think I'm better than everyone because I don't party! I'm so unique!' songs but this song is actually fantastic. This is Alessia Cara's Here but done in a less pretentious boring way but lighten up Hailee!!!"

**ImADudeDuh**: "It's kinda clunky (like the rest of Haiz)"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "while we're at it, here's a Hell No wearing Headphones"

**SpanKKy1**: "Hell no will I listen to this ever again"


**leafsnash61**: "No comment."

This next song out from Charli is just insane. The SOPHIE produced beat is ridiculously fun and Charli owns the track; I especially love her screaming "BITCH IM HERE TO FUCK U UP"

However, this was a little *too* wild for some people, which explains it's early departure during Day 2. 

---




Many people absolutely couldn't stand this track, or just disliked it:

**OberionSynth**: "honestly what even is this"


**MNREDR**: "Passable verses and abysmal hooks seem to be a theme for this EP."

**MrSwearword**: "OK, she’s voguing now? Aside from that, this is fucking garbage production and Charli fucking up vocally again."

**blasifeelsswift**: "what is this? Is this even music? jk"

**thefighter987**: "unlistenable trainwreck"

**leafsnash61**: "Just awful."

**ImADudeDuh**: "It's just noise"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "..."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Has science gone too far with this song? YES"

**jimmy345960**: "Almost a zero. Why."

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "not into it"

**Albert_Cole**: "This sounds vaguely like a demonic cheerleader anthem."

**twat_brained**: "I kinda like the beat through the verses but the hook completely misses the mark for me."


**Look_A_Fangirl**: "“Y’all I found horror movie/video game music!” “What is it?” “The instrumental to Trophy by Charli XCX.”"

and **enecks** just has no idea what's happening here: "What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. This is like immensely bubblegummy pop meets death grips meets bop. Is bop short for bubblegum pop? Is life real? Is this reality a hologram? Is capitalism going to last this century? Is communism our saviour? Is this a good song? Is Cupcakke shitposting?"


---

It seemed like any who was into this got *really* into this:


**dirdbub**: "this is great, but there should have at least been a switch-up between the drops. either way I   W A N T   T H A T   T R O P H Y"

**skiddos**: "If you can't bump to this you lame"

**Spanksalot2**: "what dance club music should be like, forever waiting for the day I can play this at a party without getting told to turn it off"

**Altiondsols**: "literally perfect. this song replaced Kill V Maim as my ideal song to blare going 110 on the interstate."

**banananaise**: "step aside hos, this is the REAL consumer girl power anthem"

**TonyRealm**: "Bizarre is how I’d describe this song. The production is straight from a haunted house, and the variation is excellent as it shrieks and pounds along. The hook is a bit anticlimactic, but along with the unorthodox sample, I think it’s a bold move on a very bold track."

**mokitsu**: "Invented feminism"


**BionicFunhouse**: "This is my dog’s favorite song, every time it comes on he barks like crazy. Shoutout to my pupper." I NEED TO SEE THIS /u/BionicFunhouse


**zamomattel**: "At times a little too much but mostly really amazing"

**Wailordfan**: "The I want that trophy lines are awesome additions, and the 8-bit sounding background beats during the verses are so awesome, and really sound almost nostalgic. As a side note, the white noise half second break when they say I want that trophy is so pretty to listen to for some reason."

**bliamc**: "“BITCH I’M HERE TO FUCK YOU UP”!! ICONIC BANGER!!"

**leviOHsa**: "This song bangs. Okay Charli, I see you bitch."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Really weird track with a Pulp Fiction sample that really shouldn't work but really does. Charli's angry rapping is just fierce, and that instrumental is so fucking crazy it doesn't deserve to exist. The chorus is literally just that Pulp Fiction sample over and over with Charli muttering some nonsense, and yet it works so well."

**SkyBlade79**: "This is a great hype song. Charli's rapping is actually quite satisfactory in this track, but the strange, almost out of place samples of a bored-sounding woman saying 'I want that trophy' sound bad. The psychedelic beat is actually quite delectable once you listen to it a few times, but they just don't really match the song."

**BreezySeason**: "I WANT THAT HIGH CONTROVERSY SCORE"



**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "i wanna win, i want that trophy"


**superr_rad**: "i want that trophy1 but seriously she fucking did that"

**JohnnyToby**: "too short man also is she saying “throwing up”?"

**calltehshots**: "Every thing about this Charli EP is a mess and I'm living for it."

**camerinian**: "Scuse me while I SHAKE DIS ASS"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "The good outweighs the bad on this song finally, fuck this song is actually pretty fuckin legit"

---

A few people also commented on the Pulp Fiction sample:

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Does anybody else remember that scene from Pulp Fiction where Mia says 'Don't be a...' to Vincent while drawing a rectangle? That scene was really confusing. Rectangles are capable of being squares, but the particular square Mia drew didn't have four congruent sides and was therefore not a square. Has Mia ever passed elementary school? Did she flunk mathematics? Was she just coked off her ass?"


**ExtraEater**: "Trophy takes an odd sample and goes all crazy production on the rest and the result isn't necessarily bad, in fact it's honestly hilarious ((even if that clearly wasn't the intent)), probably the most funny song in this rate. I'm fine with this song being one of the lower rated, I just think it's way too funny. Hot take, this song is the musical equivalent of the album cover for The Life Of Pablo (just without the meems)."


**therokinrolla**: "Who knew a Pulp Fiction quote could make my head bang so much?"

**skargardin**: "This goes HARD plus I love the Pulp Fiction reference."

**Reifiui**: "This song is terrifying please help me I feel like Charli is coming to kill me right now"

---

I don't really have much to say about Charli's second last song out. It's a lot slower and more spooky sounding than the rest of the EP, with siren-y synths wailing in the background and Charli whispering into our ears, and I still don't know if it works or not. I'll leave that up to you guys to decide.

---

Some felt as if this was the part when the EP lost it's edge:

**dirdbub**: "bubblegum trap? great in theory, kinda meh in execution. I feel like they felt like they had to stick to a bubblegum pop chorus too much when producing this trap drop, it really could have gone harder"

**MrSwearword**: "Not the worst thing she’s ever done, but Vroom Vroom the EP went Sputter Sputter."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I've never been a fan of her slower songs, but this one is pretty great. The chorus is really subdued and dark, and is pretty dope. The verses are great. I just really wish there was a switchup in the song before the final chorus, because it definitely drags."

**TonyRealm**: "The bridge is my favourite part; the sudden soft section provides a really neat contrast to the rest of the song, which seems underwhelming, almost incomplete."

**Wailordfan**: "This sounds almost like an immediate continuation of Trophy beat and production wise, but the vocal difference is kinda jarring and makes it a bit difficult to listen to right away, but provides a deeper cut for the album closer. It is nice, but I think they should have had Paradise between the this and Trophy. I also find the drop to be pretty weak."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The chorus is hella weak but Sophie killed this instrumental (he's consistently the best part of this EP) and Charli sounds really cool on the verses. Probably the best song on the EP (although that's a pretty low bar to beat tbh)."

---

Others had different complaints:

**MNREDR**: "The background is a fucking mess but the verses are.. oddly sexy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)" hot

**OberionSynth**: "shh charlie stop making music"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "I want Sucker Charli back so badly. Vroom Vroom and ATAP bops but I don't like her collabs with SOPHIE"

**jimmy345960**: "Quality increase, too bad it rhymes secret with kept it. Charli pls be better i want to like you"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This shit is like ironic lmfao"

**leviOHsa**: "Shhhh my feelings for this EP are all over the place."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "“Y’all I found more horror movie/video game music!” “Is it more Charli XCX?” “Yes, yes it is.” Vroom Vroom EP confirmed Horror Movie/Video Game material."

**Swaqqalicious**: "Vocals are great, but some of the instrumentals are kind too annoying IMO"


**DrunkHurricane**: "The bass in the chorus completely ruins it."

**twat_brained**: "Ehh… nothing memorable. It’s okay. Not much else though."

**SpanKKy1**: "The dentist drill samples need to stop"

---

**Albert_Cole**: "Never actually shares her secret smh"

And now some miscellaneous comments that i had no idea how to categorize:

**Spanksalot2**: "NO ONE GETS TO KNOW BUT - BWOOOMBWEUEEUUM SKKRT BWEEE WOOO"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Charli's rapping on this song is more endearing than most of the singing on this EP."

**Awhile2**: "Stream Scream Queens Season 2!!"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Such a great pop song. This one could have been huge."

**Nfrankin50**: "I understand why she is collaborating with Cupcakke now"

**Uber-A**: "Oh yes bish!"

**poppinmmolly**: "chorus reminds me of Gwen Stefani (especially vocals)"

**zamomattel**: "A couple of rough moments but overall so good, really embodying Charli's mingle with PC Music"

**bliamc**: "Another great bop."

**therokinrolla**: "I love this song so much, but it commits the Cliché Music Sin of rhyming “secret” with “keep it” and that is unacceptable, so I deducted .3 points"

**SkyBlade79**: "'This is more of a grungy song about two secret lovers. It's tied with 'Vroom Vroom' for me for the best song on the EP. I enjoy her lower vocals on this song much more than her higher vocals on 'Trophy' or 'Paradise', and this song really reminds me of Madonna's style. The beat really showcases Sophie's talent; it's feels somehow 'dirty', leaving listeners wanting more."

**blasifeelsswift**: "i have no words"

**skargardin**: "Very ominous and cool sounding but still a little too messy for my taste."

**enecks**: "OK this is the least shitposty song in this album. It actually lives up to the album's promise of taking pop in harder sonical directions."

**thefighter987**: "the bass and music box is fucking terrifying but the hook is nice I guess."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "goat"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Tragic, but I'll bop to it anyway"

**superr_rad**: "made for the gays obv"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "maybe I'm in a bad mood but I didn't feel this at all. Superlove is still my jam"

**RandomDKguy**: "S C A R Y"

**JohnnyToby**: "im the shhh noises here"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Not bad."


**calltehshots**: "I feel like a hoe I'm living."

**camerinian**: "I find this song profoundly fascinating, it’s sexy but it’s also dark and twisted, like it wants you to be repulsed, and that’s a strange mix of emotions that I’ve never experienced in a song before and holy shit isn’t charli hot like damn"

**leafsnash61**: "The production doesn't match the song title but Charli sounds decent."

Hailee's second song out is a guilty pleasure for me. It kind of reminds me of a Taylor Swift pop song; overly upbeat and cheerful production with scathing lyrics directed at an ex. That is, if you consider yelling "YOURE SUCH A" at someone and then cutting yourself off to be scathing. 

---

A common complaint about this song was how childish and annoying it all feels:

**PuggleMaster**: "Cute song kinda boring"

**dirdbub**: "just say dick goddammit it's not that hard to do"

**skiddos**: "This is a bop but it's also kinda annoying"

**Cryomatic**: "I know it's intentional, but the playground-ish nature of the song grates me. It sounds like a cut from a Disney Original Movie soundtrack, down to the shallow lyrics, the handclaps, and the shout-along chorus."

**Altiondsols**: "why is this song so... childish? music box instrumental, playground taunt backup vocals, and leaving out the Cuss Words. fucking annoying tbh"

**Awhile2**: "almost as bad as flashlight"

**Death_Soup**: "Absolutely nothing special. I don't even remember what it sounds like one song later.


**MNREDR**: "Sorry Hailee, but Kelly Clarkson had the best cliche 'you had your chance and you blew it' of all time. The 'damn you're such a di-' fake out is pretty great; the Tumblr 'I can't, I can't' is.. less great."

**OberionSynth**: "oh my god just call him a dick already"

**BionicFunhouse**: "It reminds me of an unpleasant mix of Bridgit Mendler’s debut and Charli XCX’s Sucker"

**jimmy345960**: "Kinda childish, kinda bopish, definitely conflicted on how i feel. Def the worst one on Haiz"

**ExtraEater**: "I heard this was the 'ultimate revenge-fantasy song', only to find that Hailee said that herself, which makes sense since the stupid cutoff in 'you're such a--' reminds me of a 'will never swear' preteen who just lost an argument with their friend and is now fantasizing about herself winning the argument."


**bliamc**: "This seems like an idea that should be funny but very much is not."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "that goddamn hook"

**leviOHsa**: "Her voice sounds really good on this, but the overall song is weird and feels outdated."

**blasifeelsswift**: "gurl don’t try to sing like Poot lovato when you don’t have the range. Also, why don’t you finish the damn sentence i wanna know what he is?¿?¿?¿?¿? Pretty average lyrics tbh."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Just fucking spit it out… You’re an adult Hailee, you can say Dick. It’s A.D.I.D.A.S all over again."

**twat_brained**: "Ehh, the chant is somewhat redeeming but it's such a downgrade from Love Myself. No wonder people give Republic shit if this is what they let onto their records."

**therokinrolla**: "Super basic beat and a super basic chorus. BORING"

**camerinian**: "I don’t think I ever listened to this song willingly at the height of its popularity, so it came as a shock to me when this came through my headphones with the most painfully mixed keyboard line I’ve heard in a long fucking time. Listening to this through a TV at the gym doesn’t do justice to how godawful the production is"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** is shook: "I feel like she’s roasting me, go AWay Hailee I’m SORRY"

---

Many still found the childish nature of the song to be noticeable, but they looked past it:

**gannade**: "this sounds like a second rate disney song but hailee elevates it"

**MrSwearword**: "a really clever, catchy number."

**Albert_Cole**: "I don't think this is childish enough, given the premise. This sounds like a song from One Of The Boys-era Katy, but not quite as gleefully silly as Ur So Gay."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not gonna lie, I haven't heard this track before. It starts off normally enough, and the instrumental is serviceable, if not remarkable. However, what makes the track so enticing is the deliberate teasing of what Hailee wants to call this guy. And you never get a resolution, which is the next best solution to dropping a snarky thinly veiled insult at conclusion. And the bridge and chorus are just really fun. It's not something I would go out of my way to listen to, but it's just a very fun summery song."


**Spanksalot2**: "once again lyrics sound like a 12 year old wrote them but NANANANANANANANA that shit gets stuck in your head for like a week after listening to it once"

**banananaise**: "such a what? great chef? wonderful friend? stone cold donger??? this song is such an enigma"

**TonyRealm**: "This song is stomp stomp + middle finger + dadadadada + a nifty bridge."


**amumumyspiritanimal**: "This sounds like a Kidz Bop song but Hailee is my low-key girl crush and this song is kinda cool."

**Uber-A**: "Cute."

**poppinmmolly**: "DUDE THIS IS SUCH A BOP"

**franch**: "this is a great charli xcx song"

**wearingsox**: "favorite, so catchy and playful"

**zamomattel**: "Hailee went OFF, simplistic idea done successfully so... good for her"

**Wailordfan**: "Utilizes the chanty-ness of the rest of the album, but the big build up into the soft cocky-ness of the rest of the chorus is so pretty, and really should be used more in mainstream pop. It really emphasizes the lyrics, and would be awesome for other artists' writing."


**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The song is very cheesy for sure but this song is a perfect bop."

**SkyBlade79**: "It’s pretty catchy. I wish that she finally dropped what she was trying to say as the last word of the song a la “ur so gay”, but I digress. The song is just so sassy and carefree."


**skargardin**: "This is infectious."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Chorus could be less shouty but still pretty catchy."

**enecks**: "OK this is mad catchy. Kinda irritating, but in a good way, not a Ur So Gay way (fuck that song)."

**whatsapilot**: "damn this song is such a"

**thefighter987**: "surprisingly clever for a premise that could have easily been horrible"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A true bop!"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "Solid bop I can dig this"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Golden Globe Nominee Hailee Steinfeld"

**RandomDKguy**: "DAMYASUCHA"

**JohnnyToby**: "Duck"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The verses are good but this hook is everything. I'm learning that Hailee has a real gift for really catchy and clever hooks."

**calltehshots**: "This is Nickelodeon star song realness and I'm LIVING for it."

**ImADudeDuh**: "I really did not expect to like this song from the title"

**Yatcho**: "Really cute, not much depth but it is what it is"

Alright, so the first Bridgit song of the rate is out. I adore this EP to death but I'm going to try to not have a meltdown every time one of her songs gets eliminated. I love how distant and nostalgic this song feels while staying relatable and genuine with it's sweet and storyteller-like lyrics.

---

First, we have the praise:

**Mudkip1**: "when will your fave take you down to the library"

**MrSwearword**: "I get why Mudkip stans her. There’s something wholly unique about Bridgit."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "What a shift in direction from Atlantis, haha what? I'm not big on these types of pop tracks, but this one isn't so bad. The lyrics flow really well, and well this isn't gonna land on the radio anytime soon, the sharp transition to a more upbeat drum-driven track is pretty awesome. The instrumental honestly is sublime."

**Spanksalot2**: "gives me high school romance anime vibes in a good way, just great songwriting paired with great production"

**MNREDR**: "Impressive. Would this be considered jazz-pop? Whatever it is, I could stand to hear more of it."

**TonyRealm**: "The second half is absolutely stellar, but the first half is a bit slow for me, which makes it difficult to be invested in this library rendezvous."

**OberionSynth**: "this somehow makes me nostalgic for an event that didn't happen" SAME wtf

**Wailordfan**: "I love the super somber chill feel of this EP. I don't really know much about Bridget, but I would never guess she was a Disney star. Her music is so, just poppy, but not childish poppy, and she doesn't like she has something to prove wrong. This is just who she is."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Ok this is like the perfect type of vibe for Bridgit’s voice, I always felt like Atlantis is a little too lowkey for it but this fits her so well, I really like this"


**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Peepsi-Cola. Because sometimes misheard lyrics are great."

**therokinrolla**: "kinda basic but certified bop"

**BreezySeason**: "The vocals are really strong here and the production fits it so well"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is like if Amy Winehouse was a Disney Channel star. There's some really cool touches to it (the chorus instrumental is fantastic, especially that organ riff that plays throughout the chorus, that's the best part of the song)."

**twat_brained**: "The beat is a bit too mellow for me but Bridgit sure knows how to carry bars. Pretty decent."

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "yeahhhh Solid love this"

**RandomDKguy**: "So chill. So cool. I love it!"

**superr_rad**: "am i the only one that loves that 'okay' ?? i scream like a ben lemoing whenever i hear it" SCREAMING

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Queen of Literacy."

---

Next, we have the people who weren't that keen on it, but maybe appreciated it. Many people found this forgettable as well:

**dirdbub**: "I can fux with this, sooner or later tho. not at this current moment"

**BionicFunhouse**: "The chorus is very sweet, but this is definitely the weakest song on Nemesis."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "I really really like this song, but the instrumentals are not really my thing :/"


**zamomattel**: "Nice song but not really interesting enough for any strong reaction"

**Albert_Cole**: "I don't think I get it. It sounds like she's trying to tell a story, but I'm not quite sure what."



**bliamc**: "Is this supposed to be funky or tropical? Let me know because I can’t figure it out."

**ExtraEater**: "This is certainly relaxing and easygoing but that's all it is. It's the equivalent of mediocre jazz, you can enjoy it (and i do!), but it's not remarkable in any form."

**SkyBlade79**: "'Library' is a slower cut, with lyrics that any listener can relate to. It's about one of Bridgit's old crushes, and it's honestly just a nice and cutesy song. It's probably the weakest track on the EP, but I love the way that she kind of belts: 'Boy, you make me flip!'. I also like the very chill instrumental, that flows really well into the next track. Sadly, it’s rather forgettable; I can never remember how it sounds."


**blasifeelsswift**: "this was weird and not the good kind of disaster."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "If I had a gun pointed towards my head and was asked what's the weakest song on this EP, I'd say it was definitely this. But that's not a reason for me to give it a low score! The sad song employs a story telling that tells how Bridgit met someone and seeing them again after a while and how she still is interested with them. The song is actually pretty good if you forget the fact that the other 3 items on this EP are absolute wig snatchers."

**skargardin**: "Libraries are an alright place to meet I guess."

**TragicKingdom1**: "My lowest rated song in the rate. Basic, kitschy, and annoying."

**enecks**: "Two letter text - translation mixed."

**thefighter987**: "I’m getting Songs About Jane Vibes vibes from the guitar and vocals."

**jamesfog**: "Good song but very forgettable tbh"

**JohnnyToby**: "how old is she again? Do either of them not have a place where they can meet up at"


**calltehshots**: "Who's trying to meet a boy at the library? lol"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Lorde told you to meet her at the tennis court, follow directions next time bitch"

**SpanKKy1**: "Nerd"

**camerinian**: "This is like the low-key hipster cover of itself, if that makes any sense"

**leafsnash61**: "Decent but forgettable."


**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "who?"  bitch

WTF seriously guys? I said I wouldn't have a meltdown but two Bridgit songs gone in a row is too much... Sure, the production might be a bit empty, but the chorus is literally a gay anthem and the bridge with the rising horns and "waaaaooooo"s is just 😩😩😩 tragic for this to be out already

---

WHIP WHIP WHIP

**Mudkip1**: "such an upbeat, fun bop"

**skiddos**: "She served us that BOP! Whip whip whip"

**OberionSynth**: "i am living for bridget how have i been deprived for so long"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Ugh I love the hook, finger-snapping anthem"

**BionicFunhouse**: "It’s like the best parts of her debut in one song."

**jimmy345960**: "An unexpected bop. My favorite kind."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "This song reminds me of like video game music. Like I can see my ass running a lap in Mario Kart 64 to this."

**therokinrolla**: "the boPPiest of all of Nemesis’s offerings, Snap My Finger ends the album in a BANGIN’ way. Sassy bridget is a good bridget"

**BreezySeason**: "WHIP WHIP WHIP MIGOS COLLAB WHEN??? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhZeRITJ7gw"
hopefully never :fan: 

**SkyBlade79**: "This is a sassy jam with some urban influences. It deals with Bridgit's influence over her man, which is probably her most mature topic so far. The verses are catchy and the pre-chorus is reminiscent of an EDM build-up, but it actually surprisingly leads into an incredibly sassy chorus, with Bridgit using a higher register no one had any idea that she actually had. It eventually gives way to a nice little breakdown for the bridge, with some surprising brass instrumentals. I actually slightly prefer the live version to this, but either way I still love this song. It just sounds so sweet but independent at the same time."

**skargardin**: "Loving her attitude. This bops."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A true bop."

**superr_rad**: "This is my favorite song for this whole rate. It makes me shake mah ass"

**RandomDKguy**: "WHENA SNAPMA FINGERS WHIP AROUND BOOIII"

**JohnnyToby**: "ooh yes im snapping"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is some lowkey Janelle Monae shit, I dig it. The production is bomb all around, the melodies are bomb all around, and Bridgit pulls off the sass surprisingly well."

**twat_brained**: "THIS IS HOW YOU CLOSE OUT AN EP. FUCKIN BANGER RIGHT HERE"

**camerinian**: "Guys I think I’m a Bridgit Mendler fan now, she has a better ear for instrumentation than a lot of her contemporaries and wow there’s a sentence I never thought I’d say in 2017"


now we have a paid advertisement from **ExtraEater**: "This got like 10 plays just in my first week of being subscribed to **Google Play Music** so clearly it did something right. Also, Nemesis appeared in the 'Indie' section of **Google Play Music** and honestly I can understand. Although Atlantis and DYMMAA are pretty poppy, Library and Snap My Fingers certainly have slight indie feels to them. And finally BEST SONG ON EP SO CATCHY"

---

but is this actually memorable or good? find out below

**dirdbub**: "this is 100% missing something. I can't put my finger on it, but it's so... empty sounding and dull"

**Albert_Cole**: "I always wondered what Janelle Monae would sound like if she was boring."

**MrSwearword**: "Still shows off potential, but this song is kind of a bad way to close an otherwise enriching EP."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Chorus is annoying, rest of song isn't, thanks for reading."

**Spanksalot2**: "interesting track but it's nothing all that memorable, not a lot to say about this one"

**banananaise**: "some parts of this song gives me Kimbra vibes, if Kimbra was slightly less creative"

**TonyRealm**: "This is a track where the parts are greater than the whole."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "I reaaaaally don't like this song. sorry u/johnazoidberg-"

**Nfrankin50**: "So this exists I guess?"

**Uber-A**: "This EP is boring"

**zamomattel**: "Not bad but just seems kind of pointless and kind of simple, the only one that just sounds like other people's music"

**Wailordfan**: "Do not love this at all. The album started super strong vocally, but left on a pretty weak note with this song. However, the production on the entire project was fucking superb. Like damn girl. This is hot."

**bliamc**: "I don’t even know what I’m listening to and why."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I have a relevant username"


**JunkyGS**: "I think slow tempo songs just don’t fit her"



**blasifeelsswift**: "i did not like this at all and i swear i’ve heard the melody of the chorus before. It also drags on for too long. 3 minutes and 19 seconds of my life I’m never getting back. Album: Vroom Vroom"


**enecks**: "It's a song. I have no feelings about this. It's inoffensive. It's a song that would be filler in a bigger album, but considering this is an EP it's kinda noticeable in its blandness. The buildup to the chorus is good, but it does not pay off at all"

**thefighter987**: "objectively fine but I really don’t like her vocals here."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "who?" btich


**ImADudeDuh**: "you could've had a great score, bridgit"

**SpanKKy1**: "Snap my neck while you're at it"


**leafsnash61**: "It's all right. Not much to say about the EP as a whole because I'm not /u/Mudkip1 ."

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "i think" what do you think /u/HopelesslyEmoted?? teLL US

The second Poppy song is out! I enjoy this song, but I really don't have much to say about it besides that it's a fun catchy bop and gets the job done in terms of instant-gratification pop music. I'll just include **ThatParanoidPenguin**'s comment here as it basically sums up my thoughts on the song:

 "Probably the most conventional of all her songs, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Lyrics are good as usual but it's wholly unremarkable otherwise. I also feel like the buildup to the chorus happens a bit too suddenly."



---

**dirdbub**: "wow I wanna rob a bank to this song"

---
Surprisingly this song generally had a consensus in the comments:

**skiddos**: "Poppy pulls of impersonal, catchy pop music too well"

**MrSwearword**: "the cheesy 80s vibe detracts but not by much."

**leafsnash61**: "It sounds almost like a Disney-song"

**SriX23**: "the melody on the first part of the hook reminds me of Love Again" same i hear it too

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Musically good, though it reminds me a bit of 'Love Again' by CRJ" see we arent alone

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Try not to like this song lmao. Poppy has slain my life."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This is giving me some major throwback vibes, you can honestly tell how lowkey satirical Poppy’s music is but it’s hard not to bop to it as well"

**zamomattel**: "Really cute mid-00s sounding song from That Poppy"


**jimmy345960**: "i am loving this ep!"

**SkyBlade79**: "Now this song is also great. I forgot how good it is. Dang. I like how the verses are like ultra-short for that amazing chorus, and the little story she tells is so vivid. It’s not satirical as far as I can tell, but I just have to empathize how good the chorus is. Her little ad-libs in the background, the strong voice, and the amazing uptempo production. I also love how the production drops off at the end for “I’m coming for you”. Sadly, I have to drop 2 points for that over-compressed bridge."

**bliamc**: "It seems like a race to get the chorus, I mean, 16 seconds and the chorus has already hit. Impressive."

**blasifeelsswift**: "i swear i’ve heard this before it sounds like a marina and the diamonds song"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "The chorus is so damn catchy I had to bump my 6 up to an 8"


**BreezySeason**: "Best song about interrupting a wedding ceremony since snake now"

**leafsnash61**: "It sounds almost like a Disney-song"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Either this song is about a chick obsession about a guy/gal or saving someone from an abusive relationship that has ended up at a wedding altar. For all I know she could be pulling an I Write Sins Not Tragedies in this bitch, don’t forget the top hat and gloves Poppy!"

**camerinian**: "This is like if White Lung made pop music instead of really aggressive punk music (look up White Lung btw they’re sick)"

---

Unexpected comparisons to ABBA (maybe they are expected idk, i need to listen to more ABBA): 

**Spanksalot2**: ".....that chorus melody really reminds me of something, digging the throwback sound tho, kinda reminds me of ABBA in a way?"

**Wailordfan**: "Whoa, these ABBA vibes are having me feeling things, that lead into some major Judas vibes, all wrapped up with a lyrical mess of blends with Speak Now x Misery Business. It is just so reminiscent of other songs that I feel like it fails to find its own slot in my heart. Sorry."

---

Comments mentioning /u/SkyBlade79:

**ExtraEater**: "she stole 'Altar' from Banks' album title!!! skybled will sue!!! meems aside, the style of this song is so inoffensively and perfectly poppy how can you not like this tbh."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Banks is SHAKING /u/SkyBlade79"


---

Some people even heard classic Katy Perry in this song:

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Banks is shook. Also this reminds me of Waking Up In Vegas for some reason?"

**8485blue**: "Getting slight Katy Perry vibes (reminds me of Hot n Cold)"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is pretty good; it feels like something Katy Perry would do when she's actually making good music."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "serving 2010 vibes"

**Albert_Cole** even mentions Gaga: "The music sounds eerily like Bad Romance - which is not a problem, by any stretch of the imagination."

---

And finally the HATERZ!!1

**johnazoidberg-**: "Who brings a getaway car to break up a wedding?"

**TonyRealm**: "That bridge."

**mokitsu**: "This is incredibly bad"

**OberionSynth**: "ill leave this song behind at the altar"


**skargardin**: "Lyrics and production both were kinda meh on this one."

**enecks**: "It's good but it seems like the theme song to a subpar TV show."

**thefighter987**: "It’s just bad romance again but bad romance was that good."


**JohnnyToby**: "Chicken Little vibes in the verses"

**Yatcho**: "Without a music video I dont really get it, it just sounds too generic and cliche (is that the point?)"

---

also pls love yourself spankky

**SpanKKy1**: "I'll be waiting a while at the altar for Shawn"

**Lowest Scores:** (0 x1) letsallpoo (1 x1) dirdbub (1.5 x1) camerinian (2 x1) ImADudeDuh 

---

I really like this song, mostly because I'm a huge fan of Zedd and I like Grey's music, and I can't say I'm not surprised this is out now. Most people I've talked to expected this to make the top 10, as did I, but you guys had a lot more grievances with this than I anticipated.

---

**letsallpoo**: "The song's okay until the chorus gets interrupted by the cacophony of three producers violently ramming their dicks against the soundboard"

---
So lettuce begin with those who roasted this on various levels:

**dirdbub**: "I've heard way better songs about sucking dick by gay guys at a whim"

**skiddos**: "I don't think violins work well with EDM songs, and every time I'm starving I think of this shitty song"

**MrSwearword**: "The beat is so off from the song. Earnest lyrics mixed with Chainsmokers level beatwork…why…at least it shows Hailee is a pretty good vocalist across the EP."

**Reifiui**: "I actually really like this for the most part but oh god this drop why"

**Altiondsols**: "zedd is so consistently mediocre, he has this magical way of making every singer he works with sound laughably bad"

**MNREDR**: "The distorted effects/vocals following the chorus ruin the song for me."

**Uber-A**: "It's okay. It has certainly soured on me."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The guitar parts are chill and I can kinda bop to them but the drop kind of ruins the whole thing for me"

**therokinrolla**: "“by the way by the way you do things to my body” imagine saying that to your significant other. That would NOT make my panties drop no no no"

**BreezySeason**: "cheesy as you can get, and the production is so blergh"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I considered giving this song my 0 because I honestly felt like there are other songs on HAIZ that deserved to be a bigger hit, which I still think so to this day. However, I grew liking this song now, it's just there are way better songs on HAIZ."

**SkyBlade79**: "Everything is pretty mediocre. Her voice isn’t spectacular, and the the majority of the drop is just painful to listen to. The post-chorus is nice though."

**blasifeelsswift**: "pretty good, it doesn’t sound like a Zedd song tbh. I don’t like the repetition. Repeating a few words here and there is good but this chorus is just too much. Also, that distortion that makes it sound like a monkey singing was intended or what?"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Is Haileeee anti-Lorde? She started the EP with a self-loving anthem and ended it with a song about needing somebody??¿? Literally the opposite of Lorde’s self-aware *Pure Heroine*."

**camerinian**: "This isn’t the worst song in the rate but it’s probably the most awkward, what with the tragic lyrics over the chorus, that awful screechy drop and the fact that they left the guitar squeaks in like yes we get it it’s a real guitar good job"

**thefighter987**: "Haiz tries here (sorta) but every aspect of the production is awful"

**enecks**: "That drop is annoying as shit."

---

Now we have those who got various levels of enjoyment from this:

**PuggleMaster**: "Her best song slay queen"

**gannade**: "absolutely amazing when will your fav win an oscar"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I first hard this song on the radio, and frankly, I was blown away. The opening is normal enough, with a really smooth guitar-driven acoustic track, that just breaks into this pop sound that threw me off guard. And the chorus was just a huge surprise that worked so well, and in terms of that vocal modulation electronic sound, Zedd KILLED IT. I've been following him for so long and this is a little different from his usual stuff, but it's very 'him'. The little details like the reverse buildup and the drum patterns, are sublime. Having a song with two distinct sounds and parts is just done really well, and this is probably Hailee's best vocal performance and lyrical prowess. It's simple but for a pop song, it's clever. 'I was so much younger yesterday' is a stand out line for sure. I had this at a 9, but now it's a 10. Fantastic track."

**Spanksalot2**: "corny lyrics and pretty boring instrumentation but alright vocals and a good zedd drop saves it"


**Albert_Cole**: "Way too short. The last line sounded like it should have been setting up another drop."

**johnazoidberg-**: "Are the lyrics cheesier than a wheel of gouda? Yes. Does this still bop so hard it should say Twist It on one end and Pull It on the other? Yes."


**Death_Soup**: "Amazing song! Hailee should make more music like this"

**leafsnash61**: "Nice."


**TonyRealm**: "Filler, but fun filler."

**mokitsu**: "This has some dumb lines but it's mostly good. I love the drop!"

**OberionSynth**: "catchy but a little boring, especially for a Zedd track"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Princess of barely understandable lyrics(Ari is the queen, #sorrynotsorry) but also ZEDDDDDD"


**zamomattel**: "Cute bop, overplayed where I live but catchy and cute"

**Wailordfan**: "God, this song is so beautiful. It is a perfect song for an alto like Hailee, and it lets her be a bit more scandelous in the public's eye, especially with the music video. The guitar in the beginning, just, everything man."

**jimmy345960**: "Good song, got overplayed. I enjoy it more now that it isn't on the radio."

**bliamc**: "A little bit of a bop"


**leviOHsa**: "I don't think the chorus lyrics make much sense, but I really don't care. I'm still not bored of this song."

**ExtraEater**: "I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted (Since I Left) you (by the Avalanches I mean it is such a perfect album even /r/popheads needs to listen to it seriously tbh)"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "A breath of fresh air into this. Also look at Zedd laying down the beats."


**skargardin**: "By the way, by the way this bops."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Yes, some of the lines are really cheesy, but Zedd and Grey's production is euphoric on this song. Also really love how it's not any longer than it needs to be-- it makes the whole package feel tighter."


**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "pop perfection"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Pretty good, but that drop is not good"

**superr_rad**: "yuuusususuusuusuusssssssss"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "Hard hitter. Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo is such a good line! Love this song. The was the only song of hers I knew before this rate"


**RandomDKguy**: "I didn't know i was starving for more Haiz 'till i listened to you"

**JohnnyToby**: "I remember hearing this song after I lost my v-card and lord I have such a spiritual connection with this song"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Again not bad. Not great but not bad."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Honestly one of the best things either of these artists have done. Her voice and performance are flawless, the production is along the lines of the popular music nowadays but it's a better version of it than pretty much any other song with this sound (and I mean let's not pretend like Zedd wasn't one of the originators of this sound anyway). And the lyrics are simple but infectious ('The more that I know you, the more that I want to/Something inside me's changed; I was so much younger yesterday' is such a brilliant couplet, holy shit), and the melodies are just incredible front to back. Got this eternally on repeat, this is a perfect pop song."

**twat_brained**: "This is Hailee's best song to date. Simple as that."

**calltehshots**: "Hailee did THAT."

**Yatcho**: "Just decent, well made, surprisingly catchy pop with nothing new or interesting to offer"

---

And finally the memers

**SpanKKy1**: "I'm starving for Shawn nudes"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "tbh i like to sing 'bi the way, bi the way' and wink at people"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Teen Choice Award Nominee Hailee Steinfeld"

**berober04**: "BY THE WAY BY THE WAY BY THE WAY BY THE WAY BY THE WAY BY THE WAY BY THE WAY"

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x2) Uber-A, BionicFunhouse 

---
**BreezySeason**: "Queen of hangin' on the line"

---

Finally! As much as the sub loves Carly, I can't believe it took this long for her to lose a song. I feel like "Body Language" was forgotten from Side B in the shadows of more popular songs like "Higher" and "Store", but it's still pretty decent. However, this feels almost filler-esque to me; I can definitely see why it didn't make the cut for Emotion.

---

A few people would side with my take on this:

**dirdbub**: "something's off with song but I literally have 0 clue what it is"

**MrSwearword**: "Soundtrack vibe which isn’t a bad thing here but Carly’s vocals are so half-assed."

**Uber-A**: "Get it off this masterpiece EP. It belongs on the regular album with the mediocre songs." 

**Altiondsols**: "the only upbeat song on this EP that wasn't boring. this, Cry, and Roses should have been on the album"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Great at first, meh later."

**bliamc**: "The worst song off Side B. Still catchy tho."

**camerinian**: "I don’t know why I find that hook so awkward, but it really does take away from a good song otherwise"

**Albert_Cole**: "If you're overthinking it, relying on body language probably won't help."


**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Enjoyable but I just don't like the melodies, they're too bright and saccharine."

**skargardin**: "Production’s kinda messy"

**OberionSynth**: "my body language says i don't like this song"

**leafsnash61**: "Boring."

**thefighter987**: "fun, albeit generic."

---

However, Carly stanning reigned supreme:

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented non-verbal communication"

**Spanksalot2**: "mhm"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "The third consecutive track on Side B about a friend-lover dynamic, but still a fresh take"

**TonyRealm**: "Ludicrously catchy."


**zamomattel**: "Typical Carly bop so.... amazing"

**Wailordfan**: "The intro is funky as hell, and has a really fun vibe throughout, and definitely a lot more memorable then others on the album. The chorus is also a lot of fun and playful, I like this side of Carly, and I think this should have been on Emotion, and move LA here."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The synthline on this song SLAYS"


**patronsaintofaspies**: "this is going to be the shade link right"


**therokinrolla**: "queen of overthinking it" (PS: BreezySeason's comment is highlighted as homage to his iconic "queen of" comments in the first rate done by letsallpoo. ur comment is loved as well <3)

**SkyBlade79**: "Now THIS is a bop. So groovy, catchy, everything, ugh. queen"

**blasifeelsswift**: "this sounds a lot like Boy Problems to me. That’s a good thing btw."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Is this a hoe anthem? I live"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "So good!"

**JohnnyToby**: "dancing crazy by the queen herself came up as related music lmfao"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "What I'm loving in this whole EP is the syncopation, this song and Higher have cool-as-fuck rhythms"


**twat_brained**: "It’s official. Anything post-Kiss that Carly Rae Jepsen touches is gold. Even Kiiara’s teeth 😆"

**Yatcho**: "Gonna be singing I THINK WE'RE OVERTHINKING IT in my dreams tonight"


**enecks**: "mmmhmm good shit"

Hailee's 4th song to be eliminated, "Rock Bottom", is one of those songs that I've been on the fence with. I'd say it's my least favourite on the EP, but it's still a more than decent song that plays to the best of Hailee and Joe Jonas' strengths as singers. Like the rest of HAIZ, this song is catchy AF, and you guys generally had a lot of praise for it.

---

Many liked Joe Jonas' inclusion on the track:

**MrSwearword**: "Competent collaboration but Joe Jonas is better on it than Hailee."

**MNREDR**: "Joe and Hailee's voices mesh really well together! Certified anthem."

**Nfrankin50**: "Forget DNCE Hailee should replace Kevin and form Jonas brothers 2.0."

**skargardin**: "Joe and Hailee’s voices match well on this one."

**Albert_Cole**: "I do like Joe Jonas, so this version appeals to me."


**jimmy345960**: "WHAT A BOP. ILL BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF WHATEVER YOU WANT QUEEN HAILEE. DNCE is pretty nice, good contrast i guess. (insert joke about power bottoming here) #ROCKBOTTOM4NUMBA1"

**BreezySeason**: "DNCE feature takes this to a 9 for me, although its still damn good without it"

**dirdbub**: "I couldn't really decide how high I should rate this, but then Nick came in and it kinda solidified the song. really great song, definitely the highlight of the EP" pls

**skiddos**: "I'll rock bottom for Joe :meghan:" pLS

---

At the same time, a lot felt like his contribution wasn't needed:

**Spanksalot2**: "I'm usually not a big fan of male/female duets about love and this one is no exception, Joe Jonas was not needed here. Hook is still good though"

**8485blue**: "Personally, I prefer the version without the DNCE feature"

**OberionSynth**: "i honestly dont know why DNCE is in this song. it's so much better without joe schmonas"

**BionicFunhouse**: "It’s okay, but both of their vocal performances are unconvincing to me."

**gannade**: "so euphoric. there's something about how the song comes together that just gives a sense of FUN"

**TonyRealm**: "The only Hailee song I really love. I’m ambivalent about the DNCE feature; I normally like duets, but Joe’s voice doesn’t snatch me like Hailee’s does, and the added guitar work at the end is cool but way too quiet. But what really hit me were the lyrics; the negative/positive contrasts (right side of rock bottom / good side of bad karma / best kind of bad something) combined with her passionate vocals struck a chord and made me feel things that I try to avoid."

**chris_ou_poitrine**: "we don't need dnce on other people track"

**wearingsox**: "it was better without Joe Jonas"

**Wailordfan**: "I love that the chorus ends on a raised note instead of falling off of a lower note. It is definitely a guilty pleasure in songs. However, Joe Jonas as a pretty generic voice. You could probably write this off as most average male singers and I would just take your word for it. Not a bad thing, but his voice just isn't super unique in the song. I guess this does make it a good thing he is in a band, because he doesn't seem very interesting as a solo artist."


**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Hailee and Joe Jonas battling for who has the most basic voice on this song"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The sudden addition of Joe Jonas DNCE to the song didn't change anything about how I feel about the song, which is good. I'll stick with listening to the original tho."

**SkyBlade79**: "Really don’t like DNCE, not on this song and not on anything that I’ve heard from them. This song is just a pandering mess and her voice sounds horrible. No. Leave (Get out). This is the wrong kind of bottom anyways. Also omgpanda likes this song."

**enecks**: "More generic than other songs in this album. Not a fan of the DNCE feat. Still a slick and well produced bop"

**FishM8**: "i prefer the solo version"

**JohnnyToby**: "more like featuring toe jonass and a shitty guitar. I like the solo version more if this was the official version id give it a 6 tbh"


---

A few found this passable at best, if not simply outright bad:



**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Man, do I hate the verses in this song, and both Hailee and Joe's verses are just really not good. But THAT CHORUS. Wow. The background synths are powerful, and it's just so full of energy it's hard to deny it. Plus, the way it starts out, 'We're on the right side of rock bottom' is just really well written. The bridge redeems the verses, and rounds out the track. Really wish this would've went higher in the Top 40, but regardless, really great hook."

**zamomattel**: "For me this is just kind of cheesy and forgettable"


**bliamc**: "Kinda boring, kinda dumb."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "It’s alright. Not a power bottom anthem tho. Shame because it should be."

**superr_rad**: "this video is pure cheese and im not here for it"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "This stuff is pretty good"

**thefighter987**: "solid love ballad."


**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Now this is pretty good!"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Ehh this song leaves a lot to be desired."

**twat_brained**: "I'm not gonna keep coming back for more; I hope this goes out on day 1."

**camerinian**: "This is like the definition of a “fine” pop song. It’s catchy enough, performed well enough, composition’s good, I just don’t know why anyone would pick this over literally anything else"

**leafsnash61**: "No comment."

**Awhile2**: "i would rather rewatch pitch perfect 2 than listen to this song again"

**Uber-A**: "Meh."


**blasifeelsswift**: "This was bad. Her voice sounds too low and there’s too much going on. Stick to acting, mark my words you’ll never win a Grammy"

**calltehshots**: "This is something that could've been a Rachel Platten/Charlie Puth duet. I wanna die."

---

A few also found this to be great:

**Altiondsols** slaps on a 10: "no comment needed"

**therokinrolla**: "her best song EVER is called Rock Bottom Now That’s What I Call Irony"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Thanks for doing this rate it made me re-discover this B O P"

**omgcow**: "I honestly love this song, it reminds me of something that could've come from a Disney Channel ex-act in the mid 2000s, and I mean that in a very positive way"


**ExtraEater**: "Nice production and synergy tbh"


**Swaqqalicious**: "Definitely my favorite off of HAIZ. Legit banger."

**TragicKingdom1**: "The way they sing 'keep on coming back for MORE' makes the song."




**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A Disney Channel Bop. I'm living"



**NapsAndNetflix**: "Screen Actor Guild Nominee Hailee Steinfeld"

**RandomDKguy**: "Rock Bottom? More like BOP TOP!"

also, i never noticed this until **LandonKidatrea** pointed it out: "You can tell Hailee is half Filipina because she pronounces stupid with an 'i' at the start." in this istupid warrr

And finally the inevitable comments about bottoming

**mokitsu**: "Rock u/mokitsu" (this one took me a minute to get lmao)

#MEMES LOST 

---

Comments not about memes: 

**dirdbub**: "queen of abandonment"

**PuggleMaster**: "Honestly memes aside this is the best Carly's vocals have ever been"

**MrSwearword**: "what could be a subpar low-tempo song ends up one of the biggest pieces of shit I’ve listened to when the words “I’m just going to the store, to the store” kick in. DEAR GOD make this stop."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented a sociological and material response to food and water needs marked by the human transition from hunter-gatherer instinct to collective human civilizations"

**Spanksalot2**: "if u don't like this song u don't like fun smh"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Only Carly can make an estranged father trope so endearing"

**TonyRealm**: "At first, I thought the chorus transition was terrible. After weeks of deep meditation, it’s just very awkward. I’m actually really curious what others think, and how fans would react if the final transition (and only the final one) was more standard, but still upbeat, because I think I’d prefer that. (Or if the first two were normal and the final one was unchanged, man that would be even weirder.)"

**mokitsu**: "The chorus is so bad. It's not the lyrics it's the production </3"

**Albert_Cole**: "When will ur fave make a song based on the 'My dad went to the grocery shop and never came back' trope?"


**OberionSynth**: "i feel like the only person on /r/popheads who doesnt like this song"

**8485blue**: "I know, blasphemous, but no matter how many time I've listened to it the lyrics are too annoying. ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

**Nfrankin50**: "This is some subliminal messaging shit. I can't tell if she wants me to go to the store so someone will actually buy her album or if she's going because she is starving"

**Uber-A**: "The chorus."

**wearingsox**: "okay it's growing on me a bit but it was very annoying on first listen and gets stuck in my head in a bad way"

**zamomattel**: "I know this song is not her finest moment yet... it goes hard and is catchy, but also kind of weirdly emotional (even on an album about emotions)"


**bliamc**: "This song got way too much hate, and is truly a bop and a half."

**leviOHsa**: "I love this song, I don't know if I've become a delusional Carly stan, but it's on heavy rotation."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "FUCK I LOVE THIS SONG."

**therokinrolla**: "Ugh. UGH! UGH Yea, this song gets on my nerves now. I used to think it was good too, and yea the idea of the song is funny, but if this was sung by ANY OTHER ARTIST it would not be near as appreciated. It is repetitive as all hell, and IS NOT THAT GOOD Y’ALL! DON’T LET THIS WIN (queen of being underrated with overrated songs)"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "literally the only carly song that is bad"

**SkyBlade79**: "Iconic. The message is really cool and I can’t believe that she invented going to the “stoah”."

**blasifeelsswift**: "i like this but ffs Carly you are way too old to be singing about being scared of breaking up with somebody and running to a store instead of facing your problems."

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "the change to the prechorus is so rhythmically satisfying. I love how the verse, prechrous and chorus melodies are pretty different from each other. God I love CRJ!"

**calltehshots**: "A legendary song about traveling to the store. Imagine shopping before this song? I can't. Thank you for inventing exchanging goods for money Carly."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "just like her career after Call Me Maybe, you might not see her anymore anymore. /s"

**marcryan**: Honestly I came for the bop of a chorus and stayed for the deep meaningful lyrics.

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I love this song more every time I hear it, honestly. I love how it's slowly revealed to you that the verses are internal Carly and the choruses are external Carly and neither of them are being particularly good people here; I love how the chorus is one of the catchiest hooks in existence and how, while on its surface it's also one of the most vapid hooks in existence, right below the surface there's all this meaning about what she's doing if you've been listening; I love that this song manages to be about something while seemingly being about nothing; I love that Carly pulled off the unreliable narrator trope in a pop song. And I mean it's also just an incredible song to listen to. It was sooo close to being my 11."

Comments about memes:

**ExtraEater**: "'abolish capitalism'" (yes, communism is a meme)

**skiddos**: "If this gets memed all the way to the top 3 I'm quitting popheads"


**Reifiui**: "This is not bad but can this not go to #1 because of a meme like happens to the Billboard Hot 100?"



**johnazoidberg-**: "This is up there with Hi My Name's Katrina when it comes to memes that never took off like I wanted them to."


**Awhile2**: "you guys all like this song ironically, right?"

**banananaise**: "Make Way For The Memes, Mother"




**amumumyspiritanimal**: "I love the meme material of this song but people should realize that Carly is basically a dick in this song. Like, ok, leave him, but she's not even breaking up with him just going to the store and never coming back. woooow reaaal classy girl..."


**omgcow**: "Memes can't save this song from being bad and annoying"


**Wailordfan**: "I can understand the love for the song, and I like it, but I honestly can't tell if the love for it is almost meme-ry, or genuine, because it isn't that revolutionary in my opinion. It is good, and could have fit on the original album, but it is nowhere near the same iconic level as RAWM."

**jimmy345960**: "an iconic meme, song, lifestyle choice. When will the gays?"






**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Giving this song a 7 is the lowest score I can give to this song. My actual score for this song is a 9 but I swear to god if this song wins the rate, I am deleting the subreddit."



**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Definitely a grower (not a shower). The first time I listened, I was like wtf this is a meme until I took to heart what the song really meant. The transition between the verses and chorus is something I really love about this!"

**skargardin**: "Queen of going to the store just for the sake of, the transition between the verses and the chorus is really weird though."

**enecks**: "I can't believe in a rate with Vroom fucking Vroom in it that this is still the biggest shitpost song. This chorus seems like it's taunting people who found Call Me Maybe annoyingly twee and catchy. This song is so good tho. This song is like going to a store that is entirely stocked with candy and bubblegum, but you don't care because you just want to drown in it. The cheeky humor is the moment you rob the store because buying enough candy to drown in is expensive."

**thefighter987**: "memes aside this chorus is dumb in a less than charming way."

**jamesfog**: "don't let ur memes be dreams"


**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "MEMES."

**superr_rad**: "I wasn't sure if i should rank this high or not because honestly, legendairy meme song? but the song is actually really good until the chorus hits, its like two songs in one, and i feel"


**JohnnyToby**: "she’s singing this to the general public and the only reason she’s going to the store is so she can buy copies of her flop ep"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "I know the lyrics are silly but I can't help but sing along"


**BearlyEvenAPun**: "I almost gave this my 11, but I figured it's probably going to win anyways"

**twat_brained**: "Why waste $300 a month on cigarettes when you can buy stylish clothes instead? 😉"

**ImADudeDuh**: "This is an unironic score"

**Yatcho**: "Obligatory 'I cant believe Carly Rae Jepsen invented going to the store'"

**SpanKKy1**: "The meme that never happened"

**camerinian**: "my actual score for this is an XD/10 but apparently spreadsheets don’t like that or smth idk"

**Lowest Scores:** (3 x1) Kaphox (4 x6) wearingsox, ImADudeDuh, letsallpoo, MrSwearword, my little brother, Ometrius 

---
**BreezySeason**: "Queen of cooking dinner in your socks and slippers"

---

Another one out for Carly! This leaves her with still 5 songs left in the rate. I really like the polished and slick production on this song, especially on the bridge, and Carly as usual does a great job at conveying her E·MO·TIONs through her singing style and lyricism. Shame it missed the top 10, but I think we have enough Side B songs remaining to make up for that.

---

The song being somewhat boring was an issue here:

**dirdbub**: "one of the more boring songs on the EP, and it doesn't really mesh well sound-wise with the rest of the EP to me"

**OberionSynth**: "this kinda goes along it warm blood/let's get lost/all that. some of carly's songs are just kinda there and are nothing special"

**Wailordfan**: "What this EP struggles with compared to others is that these songs are literally rejects from an amazing album. While it is nice to get more music, these are glaringly filler songs for the most part."

**therokinrolla**: "It kinda drags a little bit. Still feels very Carly, but it doesn’t go hard like most of her songs. (queen of being average sometimes)"


**blasifeelsswift**: "i don’t even know"

**Albert_Cole**: "Somehow, I get the impression that she doesn't want to be the one?"

**skargardin**: "The weakest on the EP in my opinion."

**enecks**: "OK, this is one of the weaker tracks in the album, but it is still a bop. The start is a little too musically heavy, but yeah it's good stuff."

**leafsnash61**: "I honestly didn't remember this after I listened to it."

---

Meanwhile, the production and lyrics were a big score booster for others:

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented the concept of love"

**johnazoidberg-**: "But what if I want you to be the one, Carly? WHAT IF I WANT YOU TO BE THE ONE?"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "The epitome of Carly's songwriting imo, so simple yet so vivid and compelling"

**banananaise**: "'it's too much pressure' me @ literally everything"

**TonyRealm**: "This one grew on me; it’s just a strong, well-written song."


**zamomattel**: "Romantic with strong summer vibes, a big thumbs up"


**jimmy345960**: "feel like i should be drinking wine with this amazing song"

**bliamc**: "The bass line is so much fun."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Bop alert!!!!!"

**marcryan**: 100% Certified Fresh New Completely Unique Never Been Done Before Bop

**SkyBlade79**: "Carly sounds so innocent. But the lyrics are not. And that’s great."


**thefighter987**: "dig the bassline"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Popping my bussy to this"

**superr_rad**: "i feel like this doesn't get as much love as other songs on side b but this song is sooooo gooodd"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "Using my 11 here! I had listened to this song several times before something hit me and made it especially exceptional to me. The pre-chrous is so good. I love the melody of 'I dont wanna be the one, the one' Love his song so much!"

**JohnnyToby**: "sweet melody"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "I can't decide what song to give my 11 to, this one is a good candidate (it went to Higher in the end)"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This song is sooo goood I love the way the instrumental cuts out on the last line of the prechorus, I love the melody on 'I don't wanna be the one, the one,' I love how she almost makes 'much' a two-syllable word and sings 'It's too much-a pressure,' and I love how the lyrics manage to be simple and confident and coy and conversational and confused and clear-eyed all at the same time."

**twat_brained**: "Someone: PICK A FAVORITE SONG FROM “E•MO•TION: SIDE B” Me: “It’s too much pressure”"

**calltehshots**: "It's crazy how much amazing songs Carly had for Emotion. I'm almost scared for her next album how much can my soul take?"

**camerinian**: "I don’t really think the vocal hook is as infectious here as the rest of the project, but damn the bounce on this track makes up for it whoo"

**skiddos**: "Queen of not wanting to be the one" Dua Legend can't relate

---

**amumumyspiritanimal** had different thoughts about the production: "I adored this song originally but now I hate the instrumental, so it's a six from me."

**Kaphox** rolls his eyes at the collective popheads population: "kylie did it better"

**SpanKKy1**: "The Chainsmokers did it better" no

bluehxrizon: # #11: Fever - Carly Rae Jepsen
---
**Average:** 7.917 // **Controversy:** 1.655 // [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3aoTeQg-aA)

---
**Highest scores:** (11 x2) Urontos, Reifiui (10 x15) TheAllRightGatsby, JoshuaReddit, leviOHsa, Nfrankin50, 4Roux, LandonKidatrea, SriX23, jimmy345960, Cryomatic, Spanksalot2, angusaditus, lordpraisewifi, mirandacrocsgrove, Bingcrusher, marcryan (9.8 x1) twat_brained (9.5 x3) TonyRealm, BreezySeason, CandlePrince (9.4 x1) Joebiekong (9 x19) skargardin, enecks, rudhira_kali_ca, calltehshots, bluewaffles72, imnoteventhatfunny, HopelesslyEmoted, banananaise, Hyperiok, noideawhatever, NapsAndNetflix, 8485blue, Nerdy_boy_chris, JohnnyToby, bliamc, thefighter987, JunkyGS, MNREDR, PuggleMaster (8.7 x1) therokinrolla (8.5 x5) Uber-A, hoolytoledo, mindnoises, jamesfog, FishM8 (8.4 x2) franch, patronsaintofaspies (8.3 x1) mokitsu 

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) Kaphox (3 x1) my little brother 

---
**BreezySeason**: "Queen of riding bikes all night (ari can't do that wiv a dicc bicycle)"

---

Whew, 3 Carly songs out in a row. I guess they had to go out eventually. As we get higher into the rankings, the controversy scores are also dropping. Take a look at the low scores; **Kaphox** hits it with a 2, muttering "kylie did it better" once more under his breath (don't worry I've dedicated the "listen here" to him) and my little brother who just hates fun and music and everything good in this world


On "Fever": as usual, Carly knocks this one out of the park as well. Although I can't shake the feeling that these all *sound* like B sides as /u/WailordFan pointed out in their comment for "The One", she still delivers with more than average consistency.

---

this song saved **Hyperiok**: "This is my go-to hangover tune for some reason, it's saved me from throwing up multiple times and deserves a great score for that"

this song killed **dirdbub**: "whenever I read the title all I can think of is the one day when I was little I woke up with a like 103°F fever and it sucked and I wanted to die. that has nothing to do with the song but I just wanted everyone to know that's probably when all that jazz started"

**JohnnyToby**: "sounds exactly like Jessie j’s thunder wtf icarly" is kylie not the only one she plagiarized?!

i need to find the location of this club **SpanKKy1** went to: "Fever is the name of a local club that played Meghan's Better When I'm Dancin at 4am"


---

General opinions on the song (lots of carly stanning as expected):

**skiddos**: "Queen of denaturation of enzymes"

**MrSwearword**: "her vocals are still garbage, but at least it’s a beat that compliments her rather well."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented fluctuating body temperatures"

**Cryomatic**: "The lyricism in this fucking A+. 'I wrote some things I didn't send - three words to say that meant a lot to me' and 'And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps - it's a different world when you're not here with me' are standouts."

**Spanksalot2**: "yeah"

**johnazoidberg-**: "This is the first song on this EP where I completely understand why it wasn't released until a year after the album."


**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "What did she do? That™"

**superr_rad**: ":l"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "I just love the timbre of her voice so much"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Unrequited love is the worst. I think Carly writes the best unrequited love songs; only Carly can wear her heart on her sleeve like this and make me feel that sweet desperation."

**twat_brained**: "All rise for the official r/popheads friendzone anthem."

**camerinian**: "I’ll be real these more down tempo, ballad-ish synth tracks don’t really do a lot for me, I don’t really return to this one a lot don’t @ me"

**leafsnash61**: "I like the production a lot."

**TonyRealm**: "Carly takes centre stage on this track, and she sounds fantastic. I kind of wish the final chorus had a bit more strength to it (i.e. more backing vocals/production) and the ending was more somber (i.e. repeat the last two lines with a minimal beat à la the bridge), but I mean it’s so good already I shouldn’t complain."

**mokitsu**: "The beginning sounds like the beginning of Say It Right"


**amumumyspiritanimal**: "It's around Higher's level, but way less energetic over time."

**Nfrankin50**: "This is a song I have been playing a ridiculous amount of times after discovering it. And that's after all my emotions literally died. This would have been my bible in high school"

**wearingsox**: "heartbreak anthem full of emotion, this song gets the EP back on track"

**zamomattel**: "Really like it but bores me more than the other Carly Slay Songs"

**Wailordfan**: "The pre-chorus is really nice, and has a decent chorus, but is still just really average."

**leviOHsa**: "I'm starting to come to terms that I may be a Carly stan, and I'm not mad at it. Maybe I need to take some time away from popheads."

**blasifeelsswift**: "this is really good, it’s going on my playlist rn."

**skargardin**: "God I love the hook in this one, sick (pun intended) tune."

**enecks**: "It's appropriate this is called fever, because this is a HOT TRACK."

**thefighter987**: "Lyrically, it’s as mature as Call Me Maybe but the music is a many times better."

**bliamc**: "Sweet, soft and sad."

---


The inevitable Kylie comparisons:

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Is Carly salty about Can't Get You Out Of My Head's average? Discuss"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Did Kylie do Fever better? Yes. 6 for effort Carly."

**jamesfog**: "Kylie did it not necessarily better but at about the same level"

---

Bikes

**jimmy345960**: "I'm gonna ride my bike to this song and its gonna bang."

**ExtraEater**: "your bike"

**therokinrolla**: "queen of stealing your bike"

**marcryan**: Queen of Getting Sick & Queen of Riding Bikes.. Sorry Nicki,

**OberionSynth**: "my bike has already been stolen once so this song just gave me bad memories"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Don't steal bikes, kids"

**Albert_Cole**: "Great advice - next time I get friendzoned, I'll steal their bike. For real, Carly's lower register is not her strong suit."


**SkyBlade79**: "PROMOTING BIKE STEALING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, CARLY. Good song tho"

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Emotion Side B is pretty overrated but Kiss is not so I don't think so.

I am much more scared for Red because it's Taylor's best album yet the anti-Taylor circlejerk is pretty strong. I'll be pretty pissed if this happens but my optimism tells me a lot of people love Red more than 1989 so who knows?

There are no vocal haters of Ariana so she might actually win but I hope not tbh because Dangerous Woman >>>>>>>>>>> My Everything easilly.

cloudbustingmp3: one of Ari's singles is gonna win i'm calling it now  
  
but tbh even tho Carly is my fave of the 3, Kiss just isn't that strong. imo the only album that's strong as a whole of those is Red; ME has good singles and a couple of nice album cuts, but the rest is kinda anonymous + Kiss is mostly just unremarkable bubblegum pop beyond the 5th track (excluding TIGOY because that's a fucking BANGER).  
Red might get hit by the album length + anti-taylor jerk tho which is unfortunate, but as long as All Too Well and State of Grace make top 10 i can survive

MNREDR: On a rate announcement thread, the OP will usually have a pre-prepared link for you to submit your scores, which is sent by PM to them. For example, the one for this rate is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5wtkqz/rate_the_2016_ep_rate/), the Rules section at the bottom explains in detail. OP tallies up everyone's scores and prepares the ranking. On the reveal dates (usually a month after the first announcment), they count down the songs from last to first, with writeups here on reddit, while playing the songs live on plug.dj.
