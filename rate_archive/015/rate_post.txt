[RATE] The 2016 EP Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5wtkqz/rate_the_2016_ep_rate/

**Hey everyone!**
-
 Welcome to **[The 2016 EP rate](http://i.imgur.com/idyCq9U.gif)**. As many of you know, EPs, or Extended Plays, are musical recordings that are generally longer than singles but too short to qualify as a full length LP, or album. 2016 brought us an abundance of these short-but-sweet projects from artists old and new, so in classic popheads fashion we will be pitting several of them against each other in a ruthless bloodbath! 

The 7 EPs that we will be rating are:

- **Hailee Steinfeld - HAIZ**

- **Bridgit Mendler - Nemesis**

- **Charli XCX - Vroom Vroom**

- **That Poppy - Bubblebath**

- **Carly Rae Jepsen - E•MO•TION Side B**

- **Kiiara - low kii savage**

- **The Chainsmokers - Collage** 

-

Now, let's get to the introductions!

-
----------
**Hailee Steinfeld - [HAIZ](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/770x0/21c49019593fc7f8c0a26b1a7a8a6e85.jpg)**
-
Hailee Steinfeld (best known for loving herself cause she don’t need anybody else) is an American singer and actress. After an Oscar nomination for her role in “True Grit” at 14 years old, Hailee went on to star in “Pitch Perfect 2”, a move that set her on an unlikely trajectory to pop stardom. Soon after the film’s release, she was signed to Republic Records and released the thinly-veiled masturbation anthem "Love Myself”, which went on to be certified platinum in the US. Her debut EP "HAIZ ” was released in late 2015, followed by a 2016 re-release featuring a remix of “Rock Bottom” with DNCE and the #12 peaking single “Starving”, her biggest hit to date. (Note: We will be rating the re-released version.)

**Bridgit Mendler - [Nemesis](http://www.josepvinaixa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bridgit-Mendler-Nemesis-2016-2480x2480.jpg)**
-
Bridgit Mendler (best known for...... *insert 'no-name trash' joke*) is an American singer and actress. The “Good Luck Charlie” star began her singing career with “Ready or Not”, which was a minor success. Despite this, her subsequent album “Hello My Name Is…” was released to disappointing commercial performance and mixed to positive reviews. However, after a 4 year hiatus from her music career, Bridgit returned to grace the masses with the hypnotizing single “Atlantis” and a new EP, “Nemesis", winning over critics and a small newfound fanbase (consisting almost entirely of /r/popheads users). The four song EP was praised as “a stunning collection of four self-assured and bittersweet relationship songs that entwine intelligent pop, soul and R&B” and marked a maturation from her previous album.

**Charli XCX - [Vroom Vroom](http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/23007/7190f8a9.png)**
-
Charli XCX (best known for [ha afterparties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM33anTtEVE)) is a British singer and songwriter. Garnering critical acclaim with her first two records “True Romance” and “Sucker”, Charli admittedly shied away from making music that was too “poppy” in fear of a more negative response. Deep down, however, her passion lied with the slick, commercial, electro-pop party anthems that she became well-known for in the US (“I Love It” and “Fancy” to name a few). On “Vroom Vroom”, Charli ditched the opinions of critics and harnessed that energy with the help of PC music producer SOPHIE to create an exhilarating, spastic, hyper-animated set of electronic tracks. In a later interview with Zane Lowe, Charli stated that she “hated that album now” when asked about “Sucker”; it seems like “Vroom Vroom” is the kind of music she always wanted to make.

**That Poppy - [Bubblebath](http://www.josepvinaixa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/that-Poppy-Bubblebath-2016-2480x2480.jpg)**
-

That Poppy (best known for…….. [well, see for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpCXxqiTjqE)) is an American singer, songwriter, and Youtube personality. In 2014, Poppy opened a Youtube channel under her name and began posting abstract videos under the production of Titanic Sinclair, gathering online interest and speculation. Many were attracted to her videos due to her hypnotic and eerie persona, described as bizarre, mysterious, and “distant from reality”. At first glance, the release of her early 2016 EP “Bubblebath” seems odd in context; the offering of catchy bubblegum tracks appeared almost entirely detached from the captivating image she had cultivated through her Youtube channel. However, after delving into the rather simplistic lyrics and overall nature of the music, the satirical and insightful undertones prove to show arguably as much into the conceptual workings of Poppy’s mind as the videos that allured her audience in the first place.

**Carly Rae Jepsen - [E•MO•TION Side B](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/220760026032242689/279898860904513536/image.png)**
-
At long last, Carly Rae Jepsen (best known as the reigning queen of /r/popheads) makes her triumphant return to a rate thread with “E·MO·TION Side B”! Apparently, Carly decided we weren’t shaken enough from E·MO·TION and decided to drop a collection of outtakes from her 2015 album with little warning or announcement?? Selected from the 200+ songs written for E·MO·TION, the set consists of eight 80s inspired tracks destined to give her fellow rate competitors a run for their money (or to the store to the store). "E·MO·TION Side B”, like its predecessor, was adored by critics and fans alike, and once again proved that Carly has a lot more to offer in a post-Call Me Maybe world.

**Kiiara - [low kii savage](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Kiiara_-_Low_Kii_Savage.png)**
-
Kiiara (best known for [unintelligible vocal samples](http://www.inquisitr.com/3277905/gold-by-kiiara-lyrics-what-is-she-saying-is-it-backwards-video/)) is an American singer/songwriter. Working as a clerk at a hardware store in Illinois, Kiiara recorded her breakout EP “low kii savage” and released the lead single “Gold” in 2015. Although the song didn’t initially pick up traction in the US, it gained mainstream popularity in the summer of 2016, becoming known for that infectious yet practically un-singable hook: "Roofis oya letme love m oy what you snow” (catchy, right?) “Gold” peaked at #13 on the Hot 100, but it may only be the beginning of Kiiara’s success; the dark, electronic glitch-infused style of “low kii savage” became a staple sound of 2016 and strengthened her place in the ever-changing pop landscape.

**The Chainsmokers - [Collage](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/Collage,_album_cover.jpg)**
-
The Chainsmokers are an American electronic duo consisting of Andrew Taggart (best known for [getting his twitter hacked](http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20161018/d2e76e6f0fa7cc952feb1dae16083082.jpg)) and Alex Pall (best known for [feuding with Lady Gaga](http://www.mtv.com.au/the-chainsmokers/news/the-chainsmokers-admit-they-hate-lady-gagas-perfect-illusion)). After their rise to infamy with viral hit “#SELFIE”, The Chainsmokers released a string of singles in an attempt to rebrand themselves as respectable pop/EDM artists, including “Kanye” and eventually “Roses”, the song that catapulted them into the pop mainstream. The song peaked at #6 on the Hot 100, but their success didn’t end there; follow-up single “Don’t Let Me Down” peaked at #3 and was certified 3x platinum. However, as we all know, this was only escalation to the inescapable, all-emcompassing wrath of the monster smash that went on to become the longest running #1 of 2016: “Closer”, featuring Halsey. In November 2016, The Chainsmokers released “Collage”, a collection of their 2016 singles along with a new track, "Setting Fires”; despite being panned by critics, Collage debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200, becoming the highest peaking EP of the rate.

**Rules**
-
**Please read all of the rules, even if you've participated in a rate thread before! I will be using /u/letsallpoo's system, so its crucial that you follow them exactly or the program won't be able to read your scores.**

- Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, **but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots**: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
- Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later).
- Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.
- You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is ONE song total, **NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM**. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results.
- You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.
- I am using a computer program that I designed in order to parse these votes! You can see it here. While this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link at the bottom of this post. PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
- If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.
- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

This is correct:
>Gold: 1 What the hell is she saying?

These are INCORRECT:
>Gold: 1: What the hell is she saying?

>Gold: What the hell is she saying? 1

>Gold: I'm giving this a 1 because I can't understand her! :rage:

>Gold: 1-What the hell is she saying?

>Gold: 1 (What the hell is she saying?)

>Gold: 1 - What the hell is she saying?

If you managed to read all that, congratulations! **Now you can submit your scores, which are due by April 1**. 

Will Carly sweep? Will Kiiara lose all her songs on day 1?? Will "Closer" pull a shocking upset victory???!! Find out in early April when the final rankings are revealed!
