**BreezySeason**: "Queen of waking up without you"

---

The moment the dark warm synth pad enters, you know the song is going to hit hard, and it does. For once, Carly sounds actually pained and in despair in her vocal delivery, and the chorus lyrics add another layer to that encompassing feeling of hopelessness throughout the track. In an EP full of fun bangers, "Cry" stands out from the crowd, not just from being a heartbreaking ballad, but for conveying an E·MO·TION that Carly doesn't often sing about in such a poignant way. I think this song definitely earned it's place in the top 10. 

---

Carly's arguably most emotional song had everyone stripping down to their feelings:

**skiddos**: "This song is so perfect; it would've fit well on the album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented emotional responses to worrying stimuli"

**Spanksalot2**: "yeppers"

**PuggleMaster**: "This is for /u/letsallpoo"

**marcryan**: "i cri evrytim"

**MNREDR**: "I know I'm a sucker for dark, emotional songs in happy albums but wow, this song is perfection. If this song had a music video, it'd be set in a disco roller rink and would feature cute old people dancing while Carly looks on wistfully."

**dirdbub**: "**S T R I P   D O W N   T O   Y O U R   F E E L I N G S**"

**MNREDR**: "I know I'm a sucker for dark, emotional songs in happy albums but wow, this song is perfection. If this song had a music video, it'd be set in a disco roller rink and would feature cute old people dancing while Carly looks on wistfully."

**mokitsu**: "Destroyed toxic masculinity."

**OberionSynth**: "okay im digging this"

**Uber-A**: "This song is so cute and tragic, the chorus is beautiful."

**poppinmmolly**: "this is the best song on this EP and nobody can tell me otherwise"

**wearingsox**: "SO much emotion, love! my partner cringed at the lyrics, boys don't understand but Carly does"

**zamomattel**: "Amazing & kind of sad for a Carly Slay Jepsen bop"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This is a good song but I wish Carly would strip me down to my feelings :weray" :weray

**bliamc**: "Carly did new wave and now I want a whole album of sad new wave bops from her."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "'king of the castle' omg yes carly diss ed"

**ExtraEater**: "the beginning almost sounds like the flawless 'seasons (waiting on you)' by future islands just wanted to point that out"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "This is one of those songs that you yell out the lyrics to when you’re alone and feeling it hard."

**therokinrolla**: "seriously pulls emotions(lol that a Pun!) out of me. Should’ve been included on the standard edition. (queen of crying)"


**SkyBlade79**: "invented boys having feelings. Really tho, I love the lyrics, and though the bridge is weak, everything else is just SO GOOD. She is an icon."

**skargardin**: "I almost cried so that’s something plus the chorus is so sleek."

**enecks**: "Another damn good song. CRA HA HA HAI."

**thefighter987**: "The chorus is kinda weak, I love the verses though."

**jamesfog**: "good background music"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Who made you cry Carly? I just wanna talk."

**superr_rad**: "HE ALWAYS MAKES ME (CRY Y Y Y)"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "love it"

**RandomDKguy**: "i cri everytiem 😭"

**JohnnyToby**: "poor carly :,("

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Simple intro, but sufficient. As much as I love Marina, this song I feel is the better of the 'my boyfriend is an emotionless asshole' songs"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The melodies and delivery and production on this song are flawless, but that's a given. I've always thought that Carly's greatest strength is her earnestness and simple honesty and vulnerability, so it only makes sense that the thing that would break her heart most is that the person she loves won't open up. This is as much beautiful ode to vulnerability as it is lonely heartbreak anthem. It's perfect."

**twat_brained**: "I love “Boy Problems”’ older, sexier cousin."

**camerinian**: "This is such a radically different vibe to the rest of the album that I can’t help but be drawn to it, the guitars on the chorus are a nice touch and it has a darker tone which Carly really does sell"

**Albert_Cole**: "I know too many people who are emotionally closed off like this (went to an all-boys school)."

**Reifiui** drags scooter braun, deservingly: "The ones that want to cry are your fans when they see how your managers are treating your career carly"


---

Others just didn't want to kiss and close their eyes:

**MrSwearword**: "Beat should be slower, vocals should be better but instead; the bad version of an 80s soundtrack song."

**johnazoidberg-**: "This is the first song on this EP where I completely understand why it wasn't released until a year after the album."


**TonyRealm**: "My least favourite of the EP, but it’s still a decent song. I wonder if would work better as a full-on ballad, with less aggressive drum claps."


**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Kinda great song but get stale after some time. Still, it's one of CRJ's not happy songs."


**Wailordfan**: "Ooh. I don't like this. I can't tell why though, which is unfortunately, but I can't get into it."


**blasifeelsswift**: "i don’t like this. If he doesn’t wanna talk about his feelings or cry then you can’t shame him into do it sis."

**leafsnash61**: "Not really a 'sad' song for a song named 'Cry'."

I LOVE MAY! With Hailee now eliminated from the rate, I'm glad it was "Love Myself" to finish things off. Aside from being a masturbation anthem, this is a certified banger; I get excited whenever I hear the first HEY (no, not in that way) This song is also jam packed with singalong hooks, my favourite being the infectious ALALALAL LALALALALA AH! Overall, this is a rare piece of pop magic, and I'm very pleased with this being Hailee's best rated song. 

---

Let's start with the comments NOT about masturbation:

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "In terms of 2010s pop songs, Love Myself hits every single little trope. Intimately sung bridge? Check. Ariana Grande-esque piano (is that a piano? I'm musically bereft)? Check. That weird vocal effect that usually gets thrown on a 'hey': that makes it feel more monumental? Check. However, what separates this track from the rest is just how smart the lyrics are. It's just as tasteful as a song about masturbation can be, and it forgives how bland some of the rest of the song is. Also, the chorus is tremendous and really catchy."

**gannade**: "amazing oscar grammy winner hailee" she didnt win beth :emofish: 

**Spanksalot2**: "verses and lyrics are pretty forgettable but that hook is bigger than rihanna's forehead"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "This Dancin in Cirlces demo is alright"

**Altiondsols**: "it's ok but a little bit repetitive, shouty, noisy"

**Awhile2**: "she ruined pitch perfect 2"

**Death_Soup**: "This. Gets. Really. Fucking. Annoying. Chorus is great though."

**dirdbub**: "it's catchy, but holy SHIT is it breathy and that really gets annoying after you notice it"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "This was my go-to 'fuck everything idc I love my life' anthem in 2015-2016. I like the production, and the rhythm of the song, and absolutely adore the way she sings the chorus and the pre-chorus. This girl is an angel. P.S.: Just saw that a shitton of people call this a masturbation anthem jesus guys yall have a dirty mind."


**Nfrankin50**: "This is a great song solely because it's a self empowerment anthem that doesn't spend time shitting on anyone. It's just a straight banger from start to finish. Also the visual of Hailee Steinfeld 'loving herself' is really doing it for me."

**Uber-A**: "This is a literal mix of Thinking Bout You and No More Sad Songs. It's good"

**omgcow**: "Britney did it better with Touch of My Hand"

**wearingsox**: "too repetitive"

**zamomattel**: "A cute bop but sounds like a lot of other stuff released around the same time"

**Wailordfan**: "This is such a super solid bop. Hailee should be so much bigger then she is now tbh. The only downside to almost this entire album is that almost every chorus is a very chant-y, and I do not really like that in a song. Love Myself makes it work pretty well, but others really shouldn't have the shout."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The chorus is great, rest is okay"


**patronsaintofaspies**: "i like this song, but imo, the production is a little so-so in certain places. also was on the jem and the holograms soundtrack? what"

**leviOHsa**: "I paid no attention to this song for the longest time, and then it finally hit me and I bopped it to death."

**ExtraEater** confirms patronsaint's question: "This was on the Jem and the Holograms movie soundtrack, which was only the fifth hint that the movie was going to be a self-indulgent, overly positive bore that shits on your hopes and expectations."

**SkyBlade79**: "This song is a bit overrated in my opinion. Though Hailee’s voice is nice on the verses, the choruses fall flat thanks to the weird big room effect on her voice. The production is pretty good and the lyrical material is quite interesting, if you catch my drift."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "A really interesting and solid debut single. The “self-loving” theme alone deserves some extra points."

**skargardin**: "It’s an alright motivational/uplifting song"


**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Mood."

**DisguisedPrincess**: "A bop!"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Academy Award Nominee Hailee Steinfeld"

**JohnnyToby** has an interesting point: "Really in love that there is no snare used and still manages to bop"

**CloggingToilets**: "Before deciding which would be my 0, this got my lowest, which was 4"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Not bad"

**camerinian**: "I think I subconsciously dreaded re-listening to this because they used to play this all the fucking time at my old job, but wow this actually kind of bangs"

**enecks**: "Can't relate to this at all. God damn it is a bop tho. The production on this just hits like a truck."

---

and now the horny hoes


**Mudkip1**: "makes me wanna go masturbate ngl"

**PuggleMaster**: "Masturbation Queen"


**skiddos**: "Everything about this song is pop perfection. Hailee can deny that it's about masturbation all she wants, but we ALL know it's that masturbation anthem."


**MrSwearword**: "half masturbation anthem, half self-confidence anthem. Doesn’t suck."



**johnazoidberg-**: "FLICK THAT BEAN, GIRL! Quick question - Was the percussion from the verses taken from Tim & Eric's Sit On You sketch?"


**MNREDR**: "I love masturbation - I mean, self-empowerment - anthems."

**TonyRealm**: "I’m surprised that a song about masturbation can be this bland."

**OberionSynth**: "Girl managed to get America to collectively sing about masturbation"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Yess, love masturbation songs."


**poppinmmolly**: "Love how this CHILD is singing about masturbation when will ur fave"



**jimmy345960**: "Gonna finger non-existent pussy while singing this song #masturbationqueen"


**bliamc**: "Is it bad that I like it a little bit more knowing it’s about masturbation?"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Can we have a rate of like just female masturbation bops?" /u/letsallpoo make it happen

**Swaqqalicious**: "Didn't think much on the first listen, but grew on me so much."

**therokinrolla**: "stop kidding yourselves this is 100% a masturbation anthem y’all"

**BreezySeason**: "I LA LA LA I LA LA LA I LOVE MYSELF also low key a bop about masturbation when will your fave"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "If some other artist did this song, I would have easily dismissed this song. Hailee literally owns this song with grace. Queen of masturbation tbh."


**blasifeelsswift**: "this is actually good, the message is a little weird. If you are gonna do a song about masturbation go all the way, don’t leave it in the middle between “guys, love yourself” and “guys, touch yourselves”. It kinda feels too short, like there’s something missing. The chorus is really catchy but once you’ve finished it that’s the only thing you’ll remember. Also, screaming your own name while you are masturbating is kinda egocentric tbh. But Pitbull turns me on so who am I to judge what makes lil’ miss Hailee go wild?"

**LandonKidatrea**: "I like this song becasue it gives me an excuse to imagine Hailee Steinfeld masturbating. This song only gets an 8 from me but the mental image of Hailee jilling off gets an 11/10."


**TragicKingdom1**: "Love how ballsy it is to make your first single an unapologetic masturbation anthem."


**thefighter987**: "Invented masturbation"

**jamesfog**: "Queen of masturbation!"

**superr_rad**: "Hm, I just don't feel the melody of this song. but its about masturbation so that gets points!"

**RandomDKguy**: "MasturBOPing"


**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Oh my god this is actually about masturbation lmao I thought the original post was just kidding. At any rate, quite good song. The verses are pretty good, and the prechorus and chorus are amazing."

**twat_brained**: "Touch Of My Hand WHO?! Hailee has the best masturbation anthem of all time, don't fucking fight me on this."

**calltehshots**: "This is totally something you'd hear in a deodorant commercial but Hailee turned it up to 11. Snatch me queen of loving yourself and masturbating."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Not enough masturbation innuendos"

**Yatcho**: "Gets an extra point for wearing that SELF SERVICE shirt in the music video"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "the queen of masturbation anthems. Body of My Own, Dancin in Circles, and Touch of My Hand can only wish."

**SpanKKy1**: "I don't advise anyone to touch themselves until it hurts"


**Albert_Cole**: "It's definitely not the best pop song about female masturbation I've ever heard. To be fair, it has some pretty strong competition in that field (Dancin' in Circles, I Touch Myself)."

bluehxrizon: #Hailee Steinfeld - HAIZ 

---
**Average Score: 7.311**

---

**TonyRealm**: With the exception of “Rock Bottom”, I thought this EP was good, but not great. She has potential, but the songs sound forgettable and her voice doesn’t really stand out.

**patronsaintofaspies**: So, it took me a couple listening sessions to like Hailee's voice, but once I started to get used to it, I started to enjoy the EP. Sure, the songwriting is a little simplistic, but the songs are catchy. My favourite song is probably 'Hell Nos and And Headphones', even though it's probably the worst song on the EP objectively. I'll be keeping my eyes on Hailee.

**dirdbub**: this is just so excessive, like this binch needed to get Nick Jonas on a song to even remotely be replayable. why


**BlasiFeelsSwift**: stick to acting honey, you’ll never win a Grammy but you might buy an Oscar someday.

I've been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to figure out how to start this off, but I think I'll just *dive* in (ha)

 Atlantis is my favourite song in the rate for multiple reasons, but in the end I think it all comes down to the enchanting atmosphere that this song produces. As it begins, Bridgit's voice feels up close as if she's singing into your ears, as fuzzy/lo-fi synths crackle around her; I always get the feeling that I'm inside a submarine or something during the verses. However, as the chorus starts, Bridgit leads you into a dark underwater world as synths flourish around her and her voice becomes distant and distorted in vocoder, while at the same time being everywhere at once. The standout moment for me is the post-chorus, where a vocal sample echoes indefinitely through this ocean-like place that you've just been ushered into. I feel like this song produces a near perfect image of what "Atlantis" is, or what Bridgit wants it to be, and it's completely entrancing.

bluehxrizon: #comments part 1

**Mudkip1**: "best song of 2016 by far. Bridgit snatched my weave and continued to do so throughout the rest of her EP. so excited for her upcoming album"

**dirdbub**: "damn, I did not expect music at this level from the lead of Good Luck Charlie (decent TV show, btw). this is just the right level of weird, but still accessible and catchy. by far and away the highlight; I love this so much"

**skiddos**: "When I first heard this song, I was ambivalent about Bridgit's change in direction. The more I listened to it, the more the uniqueness of the song pleased me. The underwater-like production make this song sound really joyful, yet the lyrics are sorrowful - singing about feeling of love that is lost like the city of Atlantis."

**gannade**: "no name trash"

**MrSwearword**: "funky, weird and just so fucking captivating."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Everyone check out Kaiydo right now, his stuff is so good. This song, tho, not as good. It's certainly different, but my issue is that the chorus is so lowkey it feels like a verse, and not in a good way. The whole thing is very one-note and it doesn't bode well for the track, because it feels like background music. The instrumental is glorious, and Kaiydo really kills it here, but everything else doesn't do much for me."

**Spanksalot2**: "great chill atmospheric beat, great vocals and smooth melodies and my man kaiydo coming through with a killer verse (buy fruit punch on iTunes)"

**johnazoidberg-**: "This was the first song I discovered through /r/popheads, and thank you assholes for showing me that Bridgit decided not to be every Disney singer turned pop star ever. This song is so fucking good, and wastes no time as it starts with Bridgit and the music together. The chorus makes you feel like you're descending into the ocean, it's beautiful. This is Bridgit's redemption for the cringiest rapping in the history of music on Hurricane. DAE fa-a-ace?"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Really dig the vibe of this track"

**Altiondsols**: "really great chill vibe from bridgit but kaiydo is just so utterly useless. why is he here."

**Death_Soup**: "Does not sound good to me at all."

**MNREDR**: "Atmospheric, and a rap feature I can actually tolerate."

**TonyRealm**: "I had already heard this song before I started the rate, and I thought it was alright, but after listening to everything else I didn’t know what to give my 11. Then I listened to this again and loved it, which was a surprise considering the rest of the EP is just okay. The production here is dazzlingly brilliant, from the dainty verses that allow Bridgit’s vocals to float by to the underwater soundscape that is the chorus & post-chorus, and even the variation during Kaiydo’s verse is captivating. The lyrics seem really wistful to me, and I feel the song captures that emotion really well."

**mokitsu**: "This left me edgeless the first time I played it. It was my favorite song for like a month!"

**OberionSynth**: "i feel like im drowning in a good song here"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Quite possibly the best song of 2016. Such an unexpected turn for Bridgit, but"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "This is going to be in the top 10. Otherwise WE RIOT"

**Nfrankin50**: "I didn't like this when I first heard it but once you get past her weird singing on the verses it really is a nice song."

**Uber-A**: "Yawn."

**poppinmmolly**: "Honestly I was expecting something like 'Ready or Not' this is the first song I've heard since that and WOW was I surprised"

**omgcow**: "The autotune/robotic effect on the chorus is very annoying"

**zamomattel**: "It's not necessarily bad but a bit empty and has an unneeded rap element"

**Wailordfan**: "This won't be out the first date, but I have to say that this EP's art is very unfortunate. It is just a mess. Anyways, onto the song, it is actually pretty amazing, especially for being a B-List Disney star. The production and editing here is superb."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Kind of unique but I’ve always kind of been eh on it, its pretty chill though and it introduced me to Kaiydo so that’s cool"

**bliamc**: "I don’t understand the hype. It’s not that good."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "deep breath it is quite pointless to speculate on whether atlantis actually existed or not because plato meant to use it as a rhetorical device and not to refer to it as a historical event. articles, books, shows and movies about some random bunch of explorers trying to find atlantis are very tiring to people who have actually read plato's dialogues. it's a crime against western philosophy to spend days on end wondering where atlantis is. that said, i did enjoy this song."

**leviOHsa**: "Overproduced to the max, and a pointless rap feature to boot. Girl bye."

**ExtraEater**: "I love a e s t h e t i c in music, and the Beach/Underwater aesthetic is one of my favorites. Atlantis, to me, doesn't feel as underwater as it intends to me, but that makes it better than I ever thought it would be, it adds to a sort of genius imo. I mean, the song is obviously analogous and there is no Atlantis, but it switches constantly between an authentic fantasy and reality, which is pretty reflective of love. Now some of the Bridge Mender haters would probably be concerned at how far I'm reaching here and they're probably right I made this pretty fast. Also not related (and not pop) but I rated this album right after listening to a Spiritualized album and I can confidently say that this song is actually better than the entirety of Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Can I just say that I wish Bridgit was making this type of music from the beginning of her career. I personally own Hello My Name Is… And this EP is like 100% better than it."

**Swaqqalicious**: "Bridgit's vocals are awesome, but Kaiydo didn't add much."

**therokinrolla**: "bridget’s career is asleep with the fishes :( But seriously though this song bops hard and is genuinely interesting"

**JunkyGS**: "I like everything about this besides her vocals, I feel like the production was wasted on an artist that can’t do the track justice. Kaiydo saves the track imo"

**BreezySeason**: "I didn't like Kaiydo's part at first but its grown on me. The production is great and its just really good"

bluehxrizon: #comments part 2

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I really love the 'underwater' feeling to this song and I think this gives depth to the song's meaning of heartbreak. If I need to complain something about this song, the rap verse from Kaiydo is not needed. But other than that, Atlantis is a very unique pop song."

**SkyBlade79**: "The first track, and the headlining single, 'Atlantis', is a look into just how much Mendler has changed up her style. Right off the bat, it seems as if Mendler has learned to use her voice so much better, actually putting the emotion in her words that a lot of her freshman album lacked. The metaphor-filled verses quickly move onto the chorus, which will definitely surprise any listener. The vocals are heavily distorted, making Mendler's voice sound almost robotic; which fits the theme of the chorus, lamenting 'Oh, I know how to feel, I know that love exists/it's asleep with the fishes, down in Atlantis'. The distorted voice may take time to get used to, but I learned to enjoy it. Guest rapper Kaiydo also raps a verse on this song, and though he's certainly not bad, I feel like his verse was unneeded. I mean, Bridgit proved live that she could do the verse just as well as him, and then there was 'Hurricane'... anyways, I digress. 'Atlantis' was a great choice for a leading track, so props to her."

**blasifeelsswift**: "i’m gonna be real Frank (Ocean) here: this was the only song I kinda liked from this ep and only bc of Kaiydo. I’m sorry non-existen Bridgit Mendler stans. What kind of lyric is this Every bro in the building with his back to the wall? This song lyrically is all over the place and it’s kind of like a Halsey reject. For real, are we sure this is not a Halsey reject? It’s too fake deep for me. I don’t get the relationship between what the song is about and Atlantis. I get the fast asleep with the fishes down Atlantis because Atlantis is underwater duh but I don’t think that’s the only reason the song is called Atlantis. Either there’s some reference I’m not getting or the song doesn’t make a lot of sense. I started the rate at the beginning of the month and it’s almost the end of the month and I still don’t get this. I feel like I’m missing something."

**skargardin**: "This is my first time listening to well, anything by her really and I’m shook!"

**enecks**: "There's a reason she's no name trash - this song is kinda not good. The Kaiydo verse is trash."

**thefighter987**: "Mixes indie and electronica better than the chainsmokers ever could."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "who?"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "God Bridgit makes such good music."

**superr_rad**: "I'M JUST FUCKING SHOOK LIKE THIS EXPERIMENTAL DREAMY UNDERWATER SOUND GETS ME EVERYTEIM I LOVE BRIDGEEEEE"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "who is this no name flop?"

**RandomDKguy**: "QUEEN BRIDGIT HAS REBORN. Also love the 'Weekend at Bernie's' music video"

**JohnnyToby**: "I always knew she would be a good indie queen but tbh kaiydo adds nothing….."

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Not bad, actually kinda like the vibe. Into my daily playlist. That rap though....."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "So this is the Atlantis everyone's always talking about. It pretty much lives up to the hype; I love the slightly lofi effect on her voice in the vocals (the verse melody in general is incredible), and the liquid immersive production, and the Regina Spektor harmonies in the chorus. Discount Big Sean was passable, I could take him or leave him, but the song is great."

**twat_brained**: "It’s a great song for the electro-indie fans, but Kaiydo is altogether an unnecessary addition for this track. It loses points from me in that respect."

**calltehshots**: "Everything there's for this to be a megabop but it just doesn't go all the way for me. Also this rapper? Bye."

**ImADudeDuh**: "An actual fucking bop"

**Yatcho**: "Hearing Atlantis for the first time might have been the biggest face crack of 2016 for me. I was SHOOK a no name Disney girl could make such a cool tack"

**SpanKKy1**: "Similar to the city this song sunk"

**camerinian**: "Somehow my opinion on this song grew as I was listening to it, shame it takes the G-Eazy knockoff to get it going but I dig the trip-hop kinda vibe"

**leafsnash61**: "No comment."

**Albert_Cole**: "A bit sleepy..."

The opener of E·MO·TION Side B is pretty good, but not great. There's not really much I can say about "First Time" besides that it's a sunny, fun tune that checks all the required boxes for a standard Carly bop. I do appreciate that it almost sounds more 80s inspired than some other tracks off the album. Judging by the amount of low scores, I think this song mainly made it this far in the rate because no one really disliked it; pretty much everyone agreed that this is a decent song.

PS: Carly only has two songs in left now: Higher and Roses!

---

A lot of people thought this was much more than decent: 

**Spanksalot2**: "emotion side b being here isn't even fair"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented disco music"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "I just wanna say I love the little 'ha' at the end of the bridge"

**MNREDR**: "Awww yeah Emotion Side B here we go! The attitude in Carly's voice is infectious. It's impossible to listen to this song and not feel ten times happier and sassier afterward."

**zamomattel**: "A perfect pop song that just sounds fun and cute"

**dirdbub**: "man, does Carly just absolutely nail the 80s, synthpop sound. absolutely incredible"


**TonyRealm**: "Just an infectiously fun track to dance your heart out to."

**mokitsu**: "I wish my first time was as fun as this"

**marcryan**: "The production and lyrics are top tier"


**jimmy345960**: "great opener"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Ok you know the opening scene from like every 80s movie where the main character is like dancing down the sidewalk, this is the soundtrack to when I shake my ass down the middle of the road and don’t care who sees, that synthline shook me down to my asshole" mmm

**bliamc**: "Very high energy, with funny lyrics. Solid song."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "My dad walked on to me listening to this song and I was like 'Hey, do you know that this is the girl who did Call Me Maybe? She's kind of an indie pop artist now' and he didn't believe me"

**leviOHsa**: "Pop perfection. If this isn't in the top 10 I'll sue."


**Swaqqalicious**: "Awesome synth. I would replace Warm Blood with this."

**therokinrolla**: "I didn’t like this song at first. No clue why, this shit hot (queen of snatching my wig late)"


**skargardin**: "This could’ve fit right into the main album."

**enecks**: "Damn it this is a slick song. This is so sugary sweet that it almost seems like a parody of the songs that inspire it, but it's polished enough that it feels like there is no irony. You could sneak this into an 80's playlist at a party and get away with it."

**thefighter987**: "the synth work here is magical"

**jamesfog**: "An 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody' tea"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A true '80s bop. Taylor could never"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "This EP is the only one in this rate that I am familiar with. I am super new to popheads. I'm so happy I got introduced to CRJ"


**twat_brained**: "This gives me a double dose of nostalgia! One for the ‘80s and one for the Jonas Brothers! When will your fave?"

**calltehshots**: "This 80s Madonna bop I'm shaking."

**Yatcho**: "Bless Carly for making this glorious 80s throwback


**camerinian**: "I like to think that they intentionally held this from the original Emotion so they could make it the first track because that is proper dedication to a shite pun"

**leafsnash61**: "A solid opener. Bright and happy."

**Albert_Cole**: "Queeeeeeeen"

---

A couple people felt like First Time wasn't the best First Track for the EP:

**skiddos**: "I'm not sure if this is the best choice as the opener for this EP"

**SkyBlade79**: "The lyrics are just weird and conflicting, and the intro is super extra. This song isn’t the best starter; it’s utterly unremarkable."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "I'm honestly torn at what should I rate this. Sometimes, I feel like it's a weak opener then there are times where I appreciate the bop this masterpiece is."

---

Other's had second thoughts:

**MrSwearword**: "Watered down “I Wanna Dance With Somebody”. Well not “watered” down but diluted."


**OberionSynth**: "the line 'i don't care' accurately describes my feelings towards this song"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Really nice and happy song, but after the 50th listen it became pretty bland for me. It's a cool bop but not a permanent song. I get it why it didn't made Emotion."


**Wailordfan**: "The intro into the actual intro is so cute and aesthetically pleasing to my ears, but honestly after that makes to be a pretty average song. The cut out in the bridge is pretty nice, and refreshing, but is still kinda forgettable."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Carlegend Slay Jepsus opening her rejected songs with this. Not the strongest"


**blasifeelsswift**: "no, what is this?"

**JohnnyToby**: "too happy sounding for me for talking about a heartbreak"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Enjoyable track but tbh it's a little too bright and saccharine sounding for me."

Invented praise in comments of rates

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "OK where do I begin with this song. First, it's pop perfection. It was made as a typical pop song and executed that idea even better than they thought it would. The album version is a bit clunkier than the MV version, but it bops hard anyways. The sarcastic lyrics of the song are amazing. Poppy's voice fits this song flawlessly. Her whole persona is great but it peaks at this song and the music video. Seriously, I C O N I C. Second, this song is just huge. I can't get bored of it. Even my dad who despise any pop music that's younger than 20 years or not Marina and the Diamonds(he's a lowkey stan smh dad I wasn't teaching you this), and my sister who's a classical music elitist loves this song. No matter how much I listen to it I still bop my head hard to the rhythm. Third, I have so many memories connected to this song. For example, I listened to this during my whole last summer. It's the perfect summer chill song. Or, I remember when I played it in the plug and the whole room started 'singing' the lyrics in the chat. Truly a song that brings people together. IF THIS DOES NOT WINS THE RATE OR GETS SECOND PLACE THE SUB IS OFFICIALLY CANCELED"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Everyone's favorite internet girl drops this transcendent bop, and there's not much more to say. The instrumental is really great. That is all."

**dirdbub**: "incredible opening to this EP, nothing more to say"

**skiddos**: "A perfect reggae-pop song that introduced the pop world to the brilliant vocalist That Poppy"


**MrSwearword**: "deliciously freaky and something I approve of fully."

**Spanksalot2**: "alright reggae flavoured pop tune, expected weirder stuff than this tbh"

**johnazoidberg-**: "That Poppy's biggest song so far, and it's a good one. This could have been a 10 if the guitar didn't remind me too much of all the ska I listened to in high school."

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Sounds like if Rude by Magic! was actually a decent song"

**banananaise**: "i thought i was signing up for a rate, i didn't realise i would spend 4 hours watching a surrealist pop star's mysterious youtube videos"

**TonyRealm**: "Not bad. Nice guitar at the end."

**franch**: "The song that introduced me to some weird performance art YouTube."


**OberionSynth**: "cant listen to this song without the mental image of the devil deepthroating a banana" explain

**BionicFunhouse**: "Ugh, this song is so fucking infectious. People rarely talk about the bridge of this song, but it is the best part of Bubblebath in my opinion."

**Nfrankin50**: "If you had told me a couple months ago Poppy the creepy Youtube girl makes really decent music I would have laughed at you. This is gonna be my song of the summer."

**poppinmmolly**: "have not been able to get this out of my head since listening to this"


**Wailordfan**: "The damn chorus is so fucking catchy, and it just pops in my head at the most random moments, like this morning at church, or during class, it just appears, and I love it."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "When I first put on this song I didn’t know what to expect cause I only knew Poppy from her iconic Youtube channel but then I discovered how amazing this song is and I fell in love with Poppy, fuck Charlotte tho"

**ExtraEater**: "'I really think this song could be a commentary on drug abuse and drug addiction. Or perhaps mental illnesses & taking medication for them. In addition to all the possible references to drug abuse in just the lyrics, the devil is present throughout most of her music video and after she uses what I assume is an oxygen tank in the car, he is gone–perhaps symbolizing the high that drugs provide, that rids one of distress (which could be symbolized as the devil in her music video). This oxygen tank symbolizing drugs could also be argued for when you think about all of the producers in wheelchairs with oxygen tanks. Perhaps they have had drug addictions for most of their life and, now the addiction has taken their toll on them. Might also explain why Poppy is the only one who sees the devil, really–when she’s sober (before using the oxygen tank), she’s the only one who sees the issues, perhaps, with the filming or production.' ~some guy on the genius page"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is so damn catchy. If Poppy was bigger I'm sure it would have done pretty well on the charts."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "A T R U E P O P P Y S E E D G I V E S TH E I R 1 1 T O L O W L I F E. P O P P Y L O V E M E M O T H E R. I L O V E T H I S C U L T!"

**BreezySeason**: "YAS WEIRD VIDEO QUEEN SLAY AT BOPS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY KINDA DEPRESSING IN A WAY"

**SkyBlade79**: "A masterpiece. This is the least satirical song on the album, without any real hints of her weirdness. She invented reggae with this song and I still think this is her best song made yet. I’m not sure if she was going for a weird song but she failed on that front, but it might be a good thing to have a bop that doesn’t remind listeners that Poppy is, well, Poppy. The lyrics are great, her voice sounds amazing (including her ad-libs), and the buildup to that perfect chorus is just… wow. The samples with the male voice saying “lowlife” contrast her perfectly, and I really don’t think that the song would be as great without them. This is also one of the few songs which sound just as good censored, the way she says “Rotten” is great. I hope she has more A++ bops like this on her full album."

**blasifeelsswift**: "really really good and I swear I’ve heard the melody before but I don’t know where. Poppy creeps me the fuck out."


**TragicKingdom1**: "Was not expecting reggae influences from this girl based on what I'd seen of her persona."

**enecks**: "This is a damn near perfect pop song. Every element works perfectly. It is so well orchestrated. It's a catchy song that never gets annoying when it gets stuck in my head."

**whatsapilot**: "This was my first impression on Poppy and honestly I hated it on the first listen. I almost gave it a 2. What the hell was wrong with me? It's perfect."

**thefighter987**: "Trop pop but it embraces it enough to make it not sound cheap."

**superr_rad**: "i thought i didn't like this song at first but i keep wanting to listen to it again so..."

**HopelesslyEmoted** is literally the queen of positivity: "This is great! I love rates! God bless this subreddit!"


**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Given what I've heard so far of Poppy's music I am like full-on wtf-ing right now, I didn't expect No Doubt status reggae. But not bad"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I dig the reggae/ska feel here. It's definitely nothing special, but it's an enjoyable track, and 'Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife' is a great line."

**Yatcho**: "Im still not sure if the point of this this EP was supposed to be straight pop with music videos making the point, or if the songs are somehow satire, but either way this a good fucking good for trop pop (is that the point?)"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62DQts71gPU"

**camerinian**: "Holy shit I feel really bad for sitting in on Poppy as a meme and never actually giving this the time of day this is great"

**leafsnash61**: "A really good pop song! More songs like this, please."

**Albert_Cole**: "If I didn't know better, I'd think Max Martin had a hand in this. It's got the same vibes as One More Night by Maroon 5, but better."

**calltehshots**: "For being an internet meme, Poppy comes through with actual quality BOPS."

**gannade**: "this is the most boilerplate reggae song i have ever heard"


**zamomattel**: "Repetitive and at times a bit boring, it's still boppy in places"


**bliamc**: "I don’t need a reggae song from Poppy. I just don’t"


**therokinrolla**: "Watching Poppy’s vids and listening to I’m Poppy before this was a mistake, because I was thoroughly disappointed. This song could be sung by anyone, but POPPY? It isn’t interesting, it is bland, and, sure, it’s kinda okay, but it really doesn’t match Poppy’s persona. It also feels WAY too quick."

**hoolytoledo**: "ew why does this sound like Rude"

**ImADudeDuh**: "I love MAGIC!'s new lead singer"

**JohnnyToby**: "hmmmm it’s radio friendly I guess"

**SpanKKy1**: "Consequently the title of an upcoming Camila Cabello x Diplo song, buy it on iTunes"

**Bingcrusher**: "All I can here with this song is 'Can't Remember To Forget You' by Shakira"

SO LETS RIDE **vROOM VROOM**!!!!!! The signature song of Charli XCX's EP is the most controversial, but also probably the most representative of her collaboration with PC music producer SOPHIE. As soon as the song starts, you know it's going to be a wild ride; by the time the track's 3 minutes are over, Charli and SOPHIE have catapulted you through 5+ separate sections that are tied together merely by the former's shouty cheerleader vocals. I won't lie, this song is a total mess, but it's a damn fun mess at the same time and I definitely think it deserves it's position in the top 5 of the EP rate.

bluehxrizon: **letsallpoo**: "As a meme, it's flawless, but as a song it doesn't work for me. I've written and deleted like three different paragraphs about my feelings but I'm just going to steal a blurb from another site that better articulates why I dislike this so much: 'At the risk of being actually’d about the true meaning of PC Music or who is really affiliated with PC Music or whatever...let me return to my original thesis: this sounds terrible. For every half-decent idea SOPHIE has, there are hundreds of bad ones. Generally it’s trebly mixing and canned percussion samples; for “Vroom Vroom” specifically, it’s that plus digitized banshee shrieks; a leaden trance breakdown tacked on to the end; and worst of all: pulling Charli XCX further and further away from what made her interesting in favor of another party-starting non-starter that sounds like lo-res “Hollaback Girl.' Based on the brief amount of time since the Vroom Vroom EP, this foray may have been a quick diversion. But given the alternative is “After the Afterparty,” I’m not sure where to even go from here.' Bonus points for being a great meme, though. BEEP BEEP"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "HO I WAS LISTENING TO THE FUCKING 128 KBPS RIP OF THIS SONG SINCE IT DROPPED. STRAIGHT FUCKING 11. SOPHIE manages to create an insanely dissonant instrumental that feels so simple yet is insanely layered. Charli XCX meshes perfectly with this, and their chemistry is boundless. The sounds of cars flying by in the chorus? Flawless. The weird-ass piano opening? Flawless. Charli's Beep Beep? FLAWLESS. This song is ridiculous, and when I saw it live I actually died."


**MrSwearword**: "This is tinny, unrealized trash from hell. The Marina impersonator tries her hand at half-assing Jessie J. #YouBettaFLOPBitch"


**johnazoidberg-**: "Overrated clap clap clapclapclap. Honestly, this song just doesn't do it for me. It's like they couldn't decide on an instrumental and just threw as many as they could onto the song. I'm glad this wasn't a radio hit because I don't think I could stand to hear it 3 times a week."


**Altiondsols**: "literally perfect."

**Awhile2**: "Its absolutely insane how many transitions a song thats only a little over 3 minutes long can go through"


**banananaise**: "i wish my life was an immaculately choreographed black and white HD music video"

**Death_Soup**: "Pretty awful tbh"

**MNREDR**: "Weird af but I like it now. I think they call it Stockholm syndrome."

**TonyRealm**: "Holy shit this is wild. The singing and rapping sections are so jarringly different, and I anticipate this to be polarizing. For me, it works; she pulls off both well, and the production (which is the real star) matches each style nicely, although I do think it’s slightly too minimalistic."


**OberionSynth**: "the bass line in the verse is killer but like the rest of the song just falls flat"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "This song is a certified M E S S but thanks to the popheads agenda it became my bitch anthem. Thanks guys..."

**Nfrankin50**: "Is this a joke?"

**Uber-A**: "Cit flew and engine blew!!!"

**chris_ou_poitrine**: "weird and sexy at the same time, best kinf of sexy"

**omgcow**: "I can't decide if I love this or hate this????"

**wearingsox**: "when I first heard this song I didn't care for it but shit I'm in love now, gives me M.I.A. vibes"


**therokinrolla**: "[FRESH] since day one! Rapping, beep beeps, vroom vrooms, and let’s rides make this such an effective piece of boppage from the wonderful people at PC Music. The lyrics are singable, there are too many hooks to count, it is an amazing bop formula in so many ways <3"

**zamomattel**: "YAAAASSSS Classic Charli, powerful, sassy - the production is perfection, as is her voice."

**Wailordfan**: "I feel so slutty and dirtier listening to this, even if it is actually kinda tame lyrically. I fucking love this so much though, and ended up on repeat during two different plane rides in a week, and was my anthem while in Vegas. A real life changer. Charli, when you say Hear me coming through the radio, you're obviously joking because American's really criminally under-appreciate you here."

**jimmy345960**: "Lavender Lamborghini. I guess she believe that she would be played on radio with this? Its good but not radio friendly lol. Beep Beep LETS RIDE"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I still can’t decide whether this song is trash or great, giving it an 8 to be safe"

**bliamc**: "WHAT A BOP"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The first time I listened to this song, I gave it a 4. Now that I am relistening to it, I have finally realised that this one of the greatest songs ever written. Let's ride"

**leviOHsa**: "Fuck off with the over-pronounced British rapping, it makes me cringe so much. The only thing to save this from the 0 was the chorus. Stop trying so hard."


**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I have to take points off for the fact that I have yet to come up with a dance to this, it’s too damn hard."



**JunkyGS**: "A song that I continue to come back to since release. It is so catchy, original and just hits in all the right places. One of the most adventurous pop songs in a while."

**BreezySeason**: "This is probably charli's best song of all although this may no longer be true tbh with number 1 angel idk"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is such a departure from the sound of her previous album Sucker and she transitioned her sound flawlessly."

**SkyBlade79**: "This song is definitely high point of the extended play. The combination of the sassy rap and the higher pitched, poppier pre-chorus sounds great. The production on this song is phenomenal; it's intense at all the right parts, and more bubblegum when it needs to be. If you don’t hit the HARDEST dab when the song starts then you’re not a pophead."

**blasifeelsswift**: "[FRESH] this gets a 7 and not a 4 because of the memes. It’s a confusing mess. I honestly don’t get the circlejerk. It sounds like 3 songs all together under 3 minutes and 13 seconds. Don’t steal puppies Charli! Messy mess."

**skargardin**: "Beep beep, so let’s ride to the #1 spot of the rate."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Hated it on first listen, then I realized it has like 5 different hooks that are all gold."

**enecks**: "This is the musical equivalent of a shitpost and I love it. The lyrics are silly as hell, the production is overbearing and noisy, it has BEEP BEEP in it as well as swearing, and it goes way too hard. This is a delicious mess of a song; equivalent to a good bit of rate drama."

**whatsapilot**: "OMG [FRESH]. But seriously, this was my first exposure to PC Music and I'm just really thankful it exists."

**thefighter987**: "everything about this is horrible but I kinda love it"

**jamesfog**: "Charli: All my life, I've been waiting for a good time, a good time. Me: LEMME RIDE LEMME RIDE"

**FishM8**: "first time hearing this song and im just here laughing my ass off"


**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Ok she did that."


**HopelesslyEmoted**: "I only know Superlove, which I super love, and boom clap and fancy. This is pretty cool"


**RandomDKguy**: "THE RIDE NEVER ENDS"

**JohnnyToby**: "ok I lied this would be my 11 sorry bridge omg I really want to give this an eleven omg ummmmm but Hailee needs one song in the top 10 :’( hope this wins tho"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "That intro! I wanna play Phantasy Star 4 now, I'm fairly sure they used the same chipset as the Sega Genesis. But the non intro sections are kinda meh tbh."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "On the one hand: One of the most inventive and weird pop songs in a long while. On the other hand: One of the most unsatisfying listens of all time. I just... I need it to actually drop or be cohesive so badly and it just won't give it to me. I get that it's intentional but like uuuggghhhhh it gets an 8/10 but I'm not happy about it lmao"

**DrunkHurricane**: "I really hated this at first but it grew on me considerably. Still though, that high-pitched noise in the chorus is nails on a chalkboard."

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "I can definitely see the appeal of this song to others. In fact if I had been listening to this song for more than a month, maybe I'd enjoy it a little more. However, for now I really don't enjoy the disjointedness of this song too much."

**twat_brained**: "I think I’ve found my new guilty pleasure song."

**calltehshots**: "Amazing tacky garbage that should get a 10 from everyone."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Good meme, awful song."

**SpanKKy1**: "I don't get it"

**camerinian**: "It only took me 2 seconds of this track to turn me from generally positive on Charli XCX into a massive stan. This song is genuinely unlike anything I’ve ever heard, and that’s not something I get to say much about pop music, it absolutely floored me"

**leafsnash61**: "It's too goofy to hate."

**Albert_Cole**: "Somehow this uses more outlandish sound effects than anything off low kii savage. Except these are used one or two at a time, as opposed to all on top of each other."

bluehxrizon: #Charli XCX - Vroom Vroom

---
**Average Score: 7.025**

---

**patronsaintofaspies**: BITCHES KNOW THEY CAN'T CATCH ME This EP was my first exposure to PC Music, and while I at first found the production style strange and unlikable, the absurdity and sarcasm of all eventually got me hooked. Hopefully I can set apart some time soon to listen to Number 1 Angel. I'm happy Charli finally found a style of music that she enjoys making!

**dirdbub**: wow I want to go on a joyride now screaming "Bitches know they can't catch me **(V R O O M  &nbsp; V R O O M)**" and see how many friends I lose and how quickly I lose them

**8485blue**: I hope she continues with this sort of sound/production it fits her well.

**TonyRealm**: Perhaps the wildest EP here, it switches from aggressive to tender to loud to quiet with every few lines. It’s one of those things that will alienate some fans but excite others, and consider me excited.

deleted: Wtf and vroom vroom too? Like honestly I expected those 2 as top 2 but ok. Pleasantly surprised money got #2 tho so I'm actually kinda ok with this. Like, it makes sense Carly was gonna win so whatever. Higher is OK, but money is better and everyone but the delusional Carly stans knows it ❤️. 

P. S. I should've participated in this but honestly I've been feeling so tired/depressed so I really couldn't find the energy to go through the process lol.

And with that, Bridgit is eliminated from the rate. While "Atlantis" was too strange and poorly executed for some people, "Do You Miss Me At All?" hit all of the right notes for almost everyone, including myself. Her voice sounds remarkable and biting, the production is just awesome (especially the horn swells at the end) and it's catchy as hell. I love everything about this, and it would be a closer contender for my 11 if Atlantis didn't exist. RIP Bridgit, you'll be missed by me and Mudkip (and probably some others as well). :'(

Also, Carly and Poppy are now the only remaining artists.

---

**PuggleMaster**: "Best song off of Nemesis"

**dirdbub**: "damn, this goes OFF"

**skiddos**: "Another standout song from Bridgit that sounds very happy but actually is very somber. Loooove the drums and the whistling."

**MrSwearword**: "a singer not afraid to project. That’s my kind of motherfucker."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not the biggest fan of the chorus and verses here. However, the pre-chorus is great, and the instrumental is I N S A N E. The meandering synth that circles around the latter half of the chorus is so cool."

**Spanksalot2**: "WHO DOES THE PRODUCTION ON THIS EP BECAUSE MY GOD. The production on this song and the EP in general is really smooth and makes great use of space and silence without relying on it too much, there's still tons of interesting stuff going on in the instrumental. Hook is great as well."

**letsallpoo**: "is this song about her relationship with the gp hahaha what an original joke"

**johnazoidberg-**: "I'm coming home, Bridgit."

**Awhile2**: "I really like all of her songs for like the first minute but then they just get sort of boring"

**TonyRealm**: "That whistle thing is bold but sounds a bit off. The rest is good stuff."

**OberionSynth**: "lowkey feel like salsa dancing"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Yes Bridgit. Yes i did."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "This song perfectly captures a smoky Sunday evening a few months after a shitty breakup."

**Uber-A**: "It's okay."

**poppinmmolly**: "love the chorus but the verses are blah"

**zamomattel**: "Awesome production and just really cool song with power"

**Wailordfan**: "If I smoked weed, I think this would be the perfect album to get high to. The rappy feel isn't a big turn on to me, but has a really well produced chorus."

**jimmy345960**: "Genuinely surprised by this."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Production gives me minimalist Neptunes teas, song is just ok though"

**bliamc**: "This whole song is ridiculous. What is with her weird accent? And the production is the strangest group of sounds I could think of. Whistling, bongoes, synths and rhythms tapped out with spoons. Why?"

**leviOHsa**: "More like this please."

**ExtraEater**: "If u gave this your 11 and u support bridge u wasted it because Atlantis is more likely to win. stll good though"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "You don’t understand how hard I want to give this an 11, but I must be a good poppy seed. Anyways this was easily one of my favorite songs of 2016. The simplistic but at the same time complicated nature of the song makes it a heavily enjoyable listen."

**therokinrolla**: "bridget @ the general public :eyes:"

**JunkyGS**: "complements her voice and has really nice production."

**BreezySeason**: "production and vocals are just uagiajijajfiao amazing queen bridgit slay"

**SkyBlade79**: "'Do You Miss Me At All' is definitely the highest point of the EP. It's a darker R&B/pop piece with some minimalist electronic influences and possibly some jazz roots. It's such a ride to listen to, with dynamic verses and powerful choruses, with a somber whistling post-chorus. The drumwork in this song really amazes me, as they seem to fit around all of Mendler's words, as she belts 'Do you miss me at all?/Do you want to leave a message on my phone, saying 'I'm coming home?' '. Mendler's voice is even stronger on the bridge, before leading to a quieter chorus. You can really feel Mendler's pain through her voice in this song, and that's really what makes it so great. Even the whistling, which might be off-putting on the first listen, seems to fit the mood of the song. It's such a mature song for a former Disney star. <That was from my blog. I adore this song. It’s iconic and though it didn’t do well I love Bridgit for making it. If the rest of Bridgit’s album is this good I will stan her SO HARD."

**blasifeelsswift**: "i don’t know what to say about this except that i didn’t really hate it??? I’m also kind of confused. Genius states that after the success of her first single Atlantis…. First of all success where, it didn’t chart?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?"

**skargardin**: "Pleasantly surprised by this, lyrics are on point."

**enecks**: "This is a much better constructed song than the others in the album. It's not as stiflingly under produced as some of this album is."

**thefighter987**: "The percussion and horn section is great here, not fond of the flute though."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "who?"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Savior of indie pop."

**superr_rad**: "THE DRUMS, THE SOUNDS, IM FEELING THINGS"

**RandomDKguy**: "Queen of looking through glass and wristling"

**JohnnyToby**: "this would be my 11 if starving didn’t exist lord so much emotion I’ll never miss u Bridget honey"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is like the 2017 version of 2000s R&B pop, I'm getting Usher/Destiny's Child vibes or something. That hook melody is incredible and that whistle is A+. Cool track, I dig it."

**twat_brained**: "I’m so here for the raw emotion in this track! Not the whistle at the end, though. That loses points in my book."

**calltehshots**: "Bop of the EP"

**Yatcho**: "a little low-key but she really belts it out in that chorus. Great song"

**SpanKKy1**: "No"

**camerinian**: "Call it the benefit of low expectations if you want, but I was genuinely floored by this, the live instrumentations does absolute wonders for the sound of this, live drum kits on pop songs are like my fetish omg"

**leafsnash61**: "Solid."

bluehxrizon: #Bridgit Mendler - Nemesis

---
**Average Score: 7.606**

---

**SkyBlade79**: If Mendler's new album is to this caliber, I might because a huge fan of her. This album is so versatile and varied, and I really didn't expect anything this good. Truly, Nemesis showcases an amazing maturation of a former Disney's star music style and prowess, without being forced to try to be overly provactive; I thought I'd never see the day.

**dirdbub**: …so if you ever release an EP and it only gets popular on an online forum with shit taste, well... good luck, Charlie."

**Cryomatic**: In an interview, Bridgit Mendler said that she practically lived in coffee shops while writing this album, and this really shows through. She absolutely nails the casual, cool atmosphere in every single song, and I can only hope her upcoming second album can keep it going.

**TonyRealm**: This almost feels like an indie record, with influences from all over music, and I think she does a good job experimenting but not going overboard.

**Nfranklin50**: I miss Goodluck Charlie man

**franch**: i gave this album average 7.725 so i guess i really like it but i have nothing to say about it.

**patronsaintofaspies**:  I really, really enjoyed this EP. Surprised at how much I liked Bridget's voice. She'll make a great indie pop artist, IMO. I also find it interesting that she named the album after the Greco-Roman goddess of revenge-the songs on the EP seem to display a kind of emotional vindication towards Bridget's past relationships. It's a clever title.

**Swaqqalicious**: Everything besides Atlantis is pretty forgettable.

**BreezySeason**: "Queen of feeling you reaching through the cracks"

---

Carly's penultimate song to go out is somewhat of a sister song to "Cry"; both hit the same emotional marks of a tormented relationship. However, on "Roses" Carly describes the end of a relationship as opposed to the struggles faced during. It feels climatic in a way; in the outro, she sings "I won't take it back" and "please don't let me go" back to back, and the effect is pretty powerful. This is the perfect way to close the EP, and out of all the Carly songs that could have made it this far, I'm glad this was the one. 


---

This song made you guys sob, rejoice, and drag the chainsmokers all in one breath:



**skiddos**: "Carly's most beautiful song"

**Nfrankin50**: "Everything about this song is just beautiful and amazing. Like everyone can just stop. With the release of this song we have officially peaked as a species. The day i discovered this song i listened to it 100 times straight before I had to make myself stop. This is a rare song I could appreciate outside of my emotions for just being beautiful. If i still felt emotions this would be my whole entire life. This song really brings the EP together because it's dramatic and just gorgeous. I especially love how the drop for the chorus sounds like what movies make it feel like what diving into a pool would be like. I'm quite sure the cover art was made for this song specifically because it's just the same vibes and colors I get from it. This song is a holy experience."

**PuggleMaster**: "My favorite Carly song, slay me queen"

**gannade**: "i don't know why this was cut from emotion, it would have easily been the third best track, only after RAWM and the title track."

**MrSwearword**: "a better than expected way to close off a really subpar EP."

**marcryan**: "Oh Mama, She sure did love the Roses"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, which form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles, vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds, and are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa."

**Spanksalot2**: "but still better than p much any song by chainsmokers or kiiara"

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Makes me want to perform a contemporary dance duet"


**TonyRealm**: "My one nitpick is that Carly’s voice sounds more processed than usual. But it gets a 10 anyway because it’s amazing."

**OberionSynth**: "yassssss queen this song pop my pussy good"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Best song on the album imo. To be honest, I really like Emotion B Side as a cohesive piece, but the songs besides Roses, Store, and Higher are pretty bad at standing out. If it was for album rating I'd give the highest score to B Side and Bubblebath, but with song ratings the album is just not doing it for me."

**Uber-A**: "Just amazing."

**omgcow**: "The only song from this EP that I actually use"

**wearingsox**: "Carly's whisper-talking-singing is peak sensuality mixed with friendship and tru love"

**Wailordfan**: "I don't feel like this really meshes with the rest of the album when it comes to the production of the verses, but the chorus is amazing, and the lyrics are super Fearless era Taylor Swift, and I am living."

**jimmy345960**: "best song. almost got my eleven"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Amazing perspective of a dying relationship, comparing it to dying roses in a garden. This song just spits out vivid ass imagery that would make for an amazing video."

**therokinrolla**: "Really really beautiful song. I didn’t think Carly could pull off a song like this but she did and its quite excellent queen of snapping(and decay)"

**SkyBlade79**: "I love everything about this song except for the weak sounding “ooooh oooh” pathetic. Bad. Tragic. She needs to do more reps on the “oooh” machine."


**blasifeelsswift**: "this might be one of my favourites from this ep tbh. This should have been in EMOTION tbh."

**skargardin**: "The perfect closer, it makes me look back on the EP as a whole."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Most emotional song for me on either side of Emotion."

**enecks**: "Honestly, even though this is an EP made of rejected songs, this has a damn good emotional arc."

**thefighter987**: "lol what’s a chainsmoker?"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "An album closer. Iconic."

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The production is incredible on this song (shoutout to Ryan Stewart & Kyle Shearer, I don't know who you are but you killed it on this track), and the backing vocals on the bridge are amazing as well. And as always Carly pulls off conversational talking-to-myself-and-you-in-real-time lyrics better than anyone else can. She opens the track almost whispering, as if she's too scared to say it out loud. Amazing track."

**twat_brained**: "You see, Taylor? THIS is how you write a song about not getting back together!"

**SpanKKy1**: "The Chainsmokers did it better" see this one is actually debatable

**camerinian**: "I could listen to Carly whisper in my ear all day, and I’m definitely way too old to be having fantasies about pop singers"

**leafsnash61**: "I really like this but it's ephemeral."

**Albert_Cole**: "I didn't put a Carly Rae song on for feels, thank you very much."

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "That chorus drop... My god... What a hook.... So well produced....."

**RandomDKguy**: "Roses >< Rozes"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "This is the weakest song, but it's still great."

---

Still, this didn't click with some:

**bliamc**: "Good, but not great. I like the choruses but the production is boring."

**MNREDR**: "The bridge was a smorgasbord of misheard lyrics for me. Gumdrop cigarettes (marketing tobacco to kids is illegal, Carly), last year's settlements (did you sue your ex?), dancing in the club (eh, still makes sense), old enough to blow (scandalous)"

**dirdbub**: "something about this doesn't click with me, which sucks because I would love to adore this. sadly can't force myself to love tracks :/"


**zamomattel**: "The weakest moment on the EP, I don't hate it but it just doesn't hit the right spot for me"


**JohnnyToby**: "giving me Selena whisper vibes in the verses pls don’t whisper anymore"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "fuck you flop bitch"

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Bridgit fans and losers: 

"Higher" is the winner of the 2016 EP Rate! Carly Rae Jepsen's wig is finally safe, as she becomes the first artist to secure two wins in our rates at /r/popheads. 

When this song finally rose in the rankings to #1 mid-march, I was surprised, but then I wasn't. This is the closest thing to a second Run Away With Me that we really have from Carly. It's huge, anthemic, powerful, and generally just an all around bop. While I don't think that this captures the same exhilarating and ecstatic feeling that RAWM does, it still does an excellent job at taking you to a *higher* place (ha) and for that I think it's a deserving winner for the rate. I still can't shake the feeling that we could've had a more exciting and unexpected victory - just look at all the great artists we've already eliminated (not u kiiara) - but at the same time if anyone was going to pull through and win a rate twice, it had to be Carly. After all, everybody else is second best.

To be honest, I'm a bit sad that this song didn't win. It could've been the underdog, the Carly de-throner, the *Slumber Party*! On top of that, it's a fantastic song. Poppy is at her peak satire/pop crossover ability here, and an annoyingly infectious hook to top it off makes it all the better. In fact, for about the first week of the rate, this song was in first place, but it didn't last long as *6* other songs took the top spot before the rate ended (Atlantis, Do You Miss Me At All, Vroom Vroom, Roses, Love Myself, and finally Higher). As much as I think this song deserved to be #1, I'm pleasantly surprised that it made it this far at all and for that I have to say I'm happy with how this turned out in the end.

bluehxrizon: #Comments for "Higher"

**skiddos**: "Now THIS is a bop!"

**MrSwearword**: "Her vocals are so bum and lowly. Nice try, but just stop."

**Reifiui**: "I should LOVE this, it should be the EP's Run Away With Me, and the verses are as good, if not even better, but this chorus is just overproduced and messy god this song should have been so much more..."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can't believe Carly invented background synths"

**SriX23**: "my phone says that this is my most played song since last summer and I don't doubt that one bit"

**Spanksalot2**: "all my fears is spanish"

**johnazoidberg-**: "See queen. See queen slay. Slay queen, slay."

**kyrgyzzephyr**: "Pop, pure and potent"

**dirdbub**: "by far and away the highlight of the EP. you could play this at any party and everyone would feel like they've heard it before and love it. THAT is a sign of an incredibly well-written, well-produced song"

**Kaphox**: "kylie did it better"

**banananaise**: "i would kill to get this song on the machine at the karaoke place here. i have a need to scream HI-IGH-IGH-IGH-IGHER"

**TonyRealm**: "Love the choice to drop the “oh” in “oh you got me” a semitone (major to minor third). Not a fan of the bridge, but this is a bop regardless."

**OberionSynth**: "bass made my asshole shiver"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "Pretty great song, the only one with real staying power on the album imo."

**zamomattel**: "Great pop song from Carly, if less memorable than others on the EP"

**Wailordfan**: "This song so far has had the most replay value on the album, and still does. The vocal backgrounds in the chorus are so jarringly gorgeous, with the raw sounding oh oh's in the middle, and the high build up, just really pretty. I also love Carly's higher register, and love hearing her using it as a climax of the verse."

**jimmy345960**: "def should've been a single"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Almost got my 11, the hook is straight TRIUMPHANT and I love the production, a great fusion of modern and retro sounds"

**bliamc**: "A ROBYN-INSPIRED SYNTH BASE LINE, MAXIMALIST INSTRUMENTATION, A KILLER MELODY, THIS SONG IS PERFECTION. WHY WASN’T IT ON EMOTION??"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The year was 1851. My ancestors were fleeing from Castilian guards. They cursed in Filipino as they ran into a dead end. The guards gave cruel smiles and raised their swords, preparing to add to the unmeasurable casualties caused by white colonialism. As they prepared to behead my great-great-grandfather, he trembled and said 'Every one of my fears is Spanish.'"

**leviOHsa**: "Carly Rae Bopsen"

**ExtraEater**: "Cada uno de mis miedos es español"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "私の恐れの一つはスペイン語です。 Carlyはそれを理解しています。"

**therokinrolla**: "This is the only Carly song I’d be okay with winning, because even if it was on standard EMOTION it would be one of the best songs. Really sentimental sounding and really cute, the production is spot on, AND every one of her fears is spanish (queen of xenophobia)"


**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is just perfect heavenly pop song and it's not suprising Greg Kurstin produced this because he is the king of bops."

**SkyBlade79**: "This song is honestly overrated. And it does legit sound like she says “all of my fears are Spanish.” I mean, it’s a good song, but not amazing."

bluehxrizon: #Comments for "Money"


**dirdbub**: "**G I M M I E   S O M E   O F   T H A T   C O L D   C A S H**"

**skiddos**: "The video is honestly the cutest thing ever, I'd love it if Poppy could serve more bops like this ever again"

**MrSwearword**: "it is one of the most infectious and weird songs I’ve heard in my life. YATH POPPY, SLAY"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "💸"

**Spanksalot2**: "now this is more like it, not sure if there's some deep satirical message here but I don't care, it's a bopper"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Holy shit this all time bop. This is everything a pop song should be. Fun instrumental, cringeless lyrics, overall infectiously catchy. The satire in this song is more clever than any emo song title could ever hope to be. This song doesn't get old. In a perfect world, this would have hit #1 and made That Poppy one of the biggest pop stars in the world. It's that fucking good. The verses, prechorus and chorus of this song could have all spun off as their own songs and each one of them would have been a fucking 10. If money can't buy happiness, then why is this song so fabulous?"

**banananaise**: "FAB-YU-LUS"

**MNREDR**: "I'm Poppy."

**TonyRealm**: "Holy crap this is fire, preach it Poppy."

**mokitsu**: "This is so bad"

**OberionSynth**: "words to live by honestly"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "IF MONEY CAN'T BUY A PENIS THEN WHY IS IT SO FABULOUS???"

**Uber-A**: "I fuck with this."

**franch**: "total fkn bop"

**zamomattel**: "Also repetitive but a modern I Want Candy is not to be sniffed at"

**Wailordfan**: "Wow this is just as good, if not better then Lowlife. The line If money can't buy happiness then why is it so fabulous is just perfect. Also, I get HUGE St. Vincent vibes from this girl, and I AM LIVING. It is such a fun commentary on the rush for wealth, but it isn't really a negative look on the current state of affairs, just a clean cut opinion."

**jimmy345960**: "an unexpected bop part 2, bops harder."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I love how full and interesting the production on here is, also it’s a fucking bop and Poppy slays that chorus"

**bliamc**: "Every time I listen to all I can think about is Fabulous from High School Musical 2"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'm a leftist why do I always like songs about money"

**leviOHsa**: "That Poppy did THAT."

**ExtraEater**: "this song is better than africa by toto"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "For all the Gay Men, Bisexuals, and Straight Women here, money can buy a penis, depending on how you want it tho, you might not be able to buy it. And that children is how you can buy happiness with money. Poppy lied."

**Swaqqalicious**: "The chorus is so amazing. Just super fun. And the pre-chorus too. All of it."

**therokinrolla**: "Unlike Lowlife, this song fits Poppy much better and is actually pretty good and interesting."

**BreezySeason**: "BRICKS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYU75-OANxc"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Money is giving me Marina Electra Heart teas in a very good way. This song is satire pop perfection that it's one of my contenders for my 11."

**SkyBlade79**: "Now this is how you make satirical pop. She uses the overprocessed voice, the cliche brand name drops, and that seemingly generic instrumental (that turns out to be not so generic). It just seems to overly shallow, which it is: that’s exactly what it sets out to be. The chorus explodes into sweetness, and the legendary “If money can’t buy happiness, then why is it so fabulous?” line is absolutely god-tier. I’ve also been told that it’s often misheard that would apply perfectly here, with “if money can’t buy a penis then why is it so fabulous”. The post-chorus sounds great with those chopped vocals, with a little bit of almost country flair to it. Her voice also sounds great Queen."

**blasifeelsswift**: "#PrimadonnaDidItFirst It’s"

**LandonKidatrea**: "Poppy if you're reading this I love you"

**skargardin**: "Money really is fabulous, as is this song."

**enecks**: "OwO what's this? A bop? A bop with a good chorus? What pop needs right now?"

**thefighter987**: "If this song sounds like a kohl's ad then why is it so fabulous?"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "5SOS did it better"

**superr_rad**: "bitch i feel this i love money"

**HopelesslyEmoted**: "She's pretty cool"

**RandomDKguy**: "gives me Breakthrough/Lemonade Mouth FEELS"

**JohnnyToby**: "the part where only her voice is there reminds me of the part in hands to myself where Selena’s like “I mean I could...” it’s so perfect"

**rudhira_kali_ca**: "Now this sounds more like what I'd kinda expect from Poppy, but not really at the same time"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Feels very 'Funkytown' or Madonna to me. It's an enjoyable listen but it's super saccharine and I wouldn't wanna listen to it many more times."

**twat_brained**: "I listened to this with a wad of cash in my hand to immerse myself. It’s a very riveting experience I highly recommend it."

**calltehshots**: "I love materialism!! An 11 contender."

**Yatcho**: "This is also just a straight banger"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of literally building her house out of dollar bills. the 3 little pigs who?"

**camerinian**: "wtf this is really good too how have I not heard this until now"

**leafsnash61**: "Hey, That Poppy is pretty good, eh?"

**Albert_Cole**: "Because we're living in a material world, and Poppy is decidedly a material girl."

bluehxrizon: #That Poppy - Bubblebath

---
**Average Score: 7.592**

---

**letsallpoo**: I still have reservations about the diparity between Poppy as a quirky internet persona and Poppy as a genuinely talented pop singer, since the asethetic and personality given off by the former clashes heavily with those of the latter. Her newest song, an overt attempt to bridge that gap, somewhat ironically makes me even more concerned, since it feels like she's sacrificing what made her music endearing in order to be quirky but disposible, much like most of her videos. Quirk can still be interesting and lead to great pop music, and while Bubblebath was a great EP, I hope she'll figure out how to merge her internet persona and her pop artistry for future major releases.

**dirdbub**: I would write about how this is such an introspective look into society as a whole and the general culture around pop stars, but that requires too much effort that Poppy definitely wouldn't want me to put in lmao get fucked

**TonyRealm**: Poppy the YouTube personality > Poppy the musician. (Although “Money” is a great song.)

**Nfranklin50**: You won't believe what Pastel Illuminati Youtube girl did!

**patronsaintofaspies**: The songs on this EP are really, really catchy and I'm very impressed at Poppy's songwriting. Not much else to say here.

**Swaqqalicious**: First three tracks are so good. American Kids... meh.

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: overall this is a good simple easy EP, which I think is what Poppy was aiming for. She’s still really creepy.

bluehxrizon: #Carly Rae Jepsen - E·MO·TION Side B

---
**Average Score: 7.983**

---

**dirdbub**: queen of EPs

**TonyRealm**: There’s nothing on here that usurps the highs of EMOTION, but considering these are leftovers, it’s still consistently good, which is really impressive. If Carly released a Side C I’d listen to it.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: When The album came out, I was on the Carly high, and I would've gave every song a 10, with Higher as my 11, but after time went by I realized it was mostly because of the hype. Still a lit AF album but the competition is strong.

**Nfranklin50**: Side B: Better than Emotion tbh

**patronsaintofaspies**:  Though I enjoy Emotion very, very much, I didn't understand why r/popheads treated Carly like a goddess until I listened to Side B. The songs here are extremely good, and Carly's songwriting and artistic ambition are nothing short of wonderful. The tracks here are great throwbacks to 80s synthpop sounds; I can't help but bop along to them! Overall, this is my favourite EP in the track. It's very, very good. I'll be thinking of the enthusiasm Carly showed throughout this record the next time I listen to Emotion.

**Swaqqalicious**: Kind of a let down. I loved Emotion but most of these weren't at all special. First Time and Store are pretty good.

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: overall the ep was cute. Just that. I feel like this is kind of overrated? It’s really good but it’s not that good, anyways expect this to go far cause memes.

wearingsox: Sounds like I need to give "Higher" another try.

=====

deleted: Things I can't accept:

* All We Know is too low because of negative bias. Same can be with Don't Let Me Down.
* Lowlife should be higher than Vroom Vroom. The latter was solid, but Lowlife just hits hard.
* Higher should be lower.
* Money should win.
