**fadedblue09** (10): And to the surprise of no one, an interlude leaves us first. What I am surprised about is how some of y’all got some passionate hate for this. In my opinion, this track captures what I want from an album Intro, which is representing the content of the album very well: funky, innuendo-filled and really raunchy. With 13 0’s and a controversy score of 3.5+, we somehow got an interlude into the Most Controversial Songs list. Y’all were really spiteful huh.

**nt96** (6): It's camp, it's ASMR, it's disgusting, it's an interlude. You guys just couldn’t seem to find a middle ground here, could you? Either way, one thing's for certain; it's dead last, but at least we got it into the highest controversy leaderboard!

#people who deserve a candy

**Awkward\_King** (10): mmmmm wet mouth sounds

**bbfan132** (10): i love this intro too much to not give it a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): no one: the witch from hansel and gretel:

**jay slay yas** (10): camp

**MrSwearword** (10): Honestly, who else but Kelis has legendary intros, especially the one where she has this character eat her chocha and erase all subtext from this album in one fell swoop.

**plastichaxan** (10): y’all dragging this like it isn’t a camp masterpiece wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's camp idc

**Stryxen** (10): lol haha

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): She was so ahead of her time, this is both ASMR and a POV feeder fetish video

**BaconShoes** (8): lmaoooo 😭 this is so funny idc

**EnCaine** (8): I will never skip the intro on a Kelis record

**fairytalehigh** (8): this is cute but we all know she's out day 1, right?

**shipperondeck** (8): ok amazing intro. WHY DOES NO ONE MAKE AMAZING INTROS THESE DAYS

**ignitethephoenix** (7): invented ASMR

**welcome2thejam** (7): Kelis food ASMR

#people with no taste

**cremeebrulee** (5.4): is she letting him go down on her after he just ate candy …. hello uti

**1998tweety** (5): idk about this asmr

**frogaranaman** (5): why does this album intro have information about my foryoupage contents

**maxisgold** (5): Ok?

**qazz23** (5): lol this is tasty isn't it

**runaway3212** (5): like yeah it's bad but it's kinda camp

**seanderlust** (5): the entire genre of ASMR videos owes kelis a fat check for this one

**CrimsonROSET** (4): … interesting!

**TiltControls** (3.5): The only reason it isn't a 0 is cause it leads into the best song in the rate

**MassiveThief** (3): ok..... it's an intro alright. kind of uncomfortable honestly.

**babadork** (2): I hate ASMR.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): listening to this feels like I'm doing something illegal

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): yeah this is really gross!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (1): i fucking hate eating sounds

**static\_int\_husp** (1): ...what

**throwaway-7650** (1): the sounds coming out of his vocal chords are worse than the ASMR

**2dina3dworld** (0): I’m sorry, I like ASMR, but listening to Kelis doing foreplay using food complete with mouth sounds and moaning was incredibly uncomfortable.

**akanewasright** (0): y’all are sick and twisted for including this. I love Kelis, I like this album, *and I didn’t want to use a 0 in this god tier rate*, but this intro makes me feel sick to my stomach. I hate chewing sounds, I hate this guy’s voice/performance, and just… I hate everything about it besides the instrumental

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): this is activating my fight or flight response seriously what the fuck is this

**bulforster** (0): Why are we rating this?? and this is coming from someone who made popheads rate two minutes of a old man talking in Spanish with no music

**celladonn** (0): This track tastes bad

**daretheghost** (0): I’m sorry I just hate the sound of people eating

**flavasavavandal** (0): I feel nothing but great discomfort from hearing this, personally there couldn’t have been a worse way to open up the album

**jackisboredtoday** (0): take out the vocals and this could be half-decent asmr i guess….

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this is literally fucking revolting

**vayyiqra** (0): ew

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Wow don’t you just love it when people chew with their mouths open?? Isn’t that just one of the most amazing sounds in the world????

**fadedblue09** (9): IMO, the weaker of the 2 intros but I guess that was a hot take. Whereas Kelis’ Intro sounded unique, this one is basically just a sampler of What About Us, which doesn’t even come until several songs later. While it does bop, I don’t think this Intro does a good job of representing the album holistically.

**nt96** (7): It's an interlude, what more did you want.

---

#truly futuristic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Yes I actually love this, I love “What About Us” so the intro being a teaser of that with the Y2K futuristic vibes is so iconic

**flavasavavandal** (10): still making up my mind over whether this is really a 10, or was I just that disturbed by the intro to Tasty?

**plastichaxan** (10): stop introphobia!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's cute, it's camp, it's futuristic

**Stryxen** (10): try not to say werk challenge

**throwaway-7650** (10): S P E L L I N G I S F U N! - miss americana and the... nvmind

**Awkward\_King** (9): this absolutely slaps and for what reason

**runaway3212** (9): I love the 2000s

**EnCaine** (8): what about all about

**fairytalehigh** (8): wouldn't mind this as a full-formed song, actually

**frogaranaman** (8): okayyyy miss beep boop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): *Brandy voice* I’m in

**shipperondeck** (8): WAIT STOP THIS IS SO COOL

**sarcasticsobs** (7.6): a good intro, thank god

**BaconShoes** (7): okay i might enjoy this album! But yeah this is just a lil intro

**fickle\_music\_788** (7): When Brandy said they ain’t playing she MEANT IT.

**Bordersz** (6.5): Very solid intro. Gorgeous use of harmonies.

**TiltControls** (6.5): good thing there's an actual musical component to this intro

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**bbfan132** (6): just an intro but the production is fun

**BeauMeringue212** (6): these 2000s noncommittal alter-egos always take me out lol

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i mean i don’t dislike this but like there’s also the whole song

**welcome2thejam** (6): Honestly that transition made me laugh hard

#anti Interlude gang

**akanewasright** (5): Yeah I don’t know why we’re rating this, it’s kinda just there. It’s a decent intro? I don’t actively hate it? But I have 0 reason to listen to it outside the album and tbh little reason to not skip it when listening to the album

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): it's definitely an intro

**MrSwearword** (5): I literally know my favorite song from this is What About Us, thanks for reminding me I can listen to that and not this janky intro.

**seanderlust** (5): is this how people get unreleased tracks to leak? is this what it sounded like when people discovered xcx world?

**ImADudeDuh** (4): british computer ladies were the underrated backbone of Y2K futurism

**maxisgold** (4): Not really a fan of interludes (or intros) that are just a snippet of a song in the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): well. it’s better than kelis’s intro at least

**daretheghost** (3): Introphobia I fear…

**IIIHenryIII** (3): B stands for bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): insert one of the many gay twitter gifs of people typing

**DirtyRat583** (0): not only is it just an intro, it provides nothing so why not 0 it

**nt96** (6.5): The song itself is ok, I guess. Interesting fact though, the song was secretly a gospel song disguised as something relationship themed due to Brandy declining the gospel idea. Lyrically speaking about God in third-person, she was unaware of its true nature until long after she recorded it. Kinda shady if you ask me since I'm not too fond of forcing or deceiving someone into doing something they're not interested in, especially it's something like Gospel. It needs to truly come from the heart.

**fadedblue09** (6): And now we lose our first actual song, which also happens to be our first single and 11 to be eliminated! A cheesy love ballad that also doubles a religious worship song? It’s almost as it you want to set yourself up. Honestly, I have no problems with artists releasing religious songs, but hiding it under the guise of a love song is…. not the best choice. Brandy herself wasn’t aware of the song’s religious subtext when she first recorded this and as a result, the song comes off as awkwardly straddling between gospel and love song. 

This was also one of the worst-performing songs in the entire rate, as it never left the bottom 5. In fact, during the first few weeks of accepting ballots, this was actually in dead last (yes, lower than both Intros). Popheads hating religion and men? Shocker

---

#We are blessed
**BeauMeringue212** (11): the title made me think this was gonna be a Christian song, and it lowkey feels like it was originally but was then changed to a love song at the last minute lol. Picked this as my 11 because out of all the songs in the rate, the vocals on this were my favorite

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this cured misandry, I’m literally a stay at home mom who only lives to make dinner for my husband and go to church on Sundays

**runaway3212** (10): He is a 10

**bbfan132** (9.5): the story behind this song is hilarious - the songwriters made it their mission to write a gospel song for brandy after she said that she didn’t want to record one (and i like this so they were right!)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): that key change is so dreamy and pretty im ascending

**ImADudeDuh** (9): GIVE PIANO BALLADS A CHANCE CHALLENGE!

**akanewasright** (8.5): Times Brandy Norwood has been punk’d: that time someone planted stolen diamonds in her car and [she did the meme](https://tenor.com/YfTL.gif), that time a producer told her “He Is” wasn’t a Jesus song, [list to be continued]

**BaconShoes** (8.5): the vocals again omg i am SWEPT INTO HER VOICE

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): "Prince Charming, my angel, my king, and my friend" me addressing my roommate's dog

**bulforster** (8.2): remember that episode of south park where they start christian rock band where they just replace the word baby with jesus in the lyrics of love songs?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): With the Prince Charming line this song should be canonical with Brandy’s “Cinderella” (aka the only Cinderella movie that counts)

**throwaway-7650** (8): on paper I should like this more but there's something unnerving idk

**welcome2thejam** (8): Loving the vocal layering & harmonies at the end, they bring this song to the next level

**Bordersz** (7.3): I get strong religious gospel vibes to it.

# oh a christian song :/

**fickle\_music\_788** (7): Don’t get me wrong, this song is nice, but this being the 3rd single out of so many better songs this album houses always confused me.

**MrSwearword** (7): anodyne, but on this album, a sign of progress.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.7): strange that this was a single, it's pretty unremarkable on the album. Theres 2 radio mixes that have more instruments on them that I really like.

**babadork** (6.4): The vocals are amazing, but a song can either be sexy or about God.

**1998tweety** (6): a FLOP

**CrimsonROSET** (6): didn’t you break up with him

**jay slay yas** (6): docking points cause its giving jesus praise and i can't support that lifestyle

**maxisgold** (6): Kinda boring ngl.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Is this about God? Or is it just a normal love song? Or maybe it’s a Sufjan situation?

**Awkward\_King** (5): i do not have any emotional investment in this song i cant lie

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): is this about god, cause if so then sorry i'm not religious

**celladonn** (5): He Is by Ghost outsold

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): i listened to this song like 5 times and forgot what it sounded like after it ended every time

**Stryxen** (2.5): it did not end

**IIIHenryIII** (2): misandry wins

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): I'm also religious but not really interested at all in songs that weirdly address Jesus like a significant other. Idk. I wish Jesus stans would chill a bit

**nt96** (7.5): Thanks to Creme, I can't unhear the Luigi's Mansion comparison. Is it stopping me from bopping to it? NO. This one of the mellower tracks on Tasty, you guys seemed to agree that the song doesn’t do much nor does it really go anywhere.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): And now we have Kelis’ first actual song to be eliminated, which is Stick Up. As expected from Kelis, it’s an innuendo-filled track, with she likens confessing her feelings to a guy to holding them hostage, which is really….interesting, to say the least. It’s definitely one of the less effective tracks for me, as some lyrics don’t quite land and the ominous instrumental feels out of place.

---

# put your hands up in the air
**MrSwearword** (10): easily the best non-single cut on the album. Contemporary for the time of release but also very stark and almost lo-fi for something with the “urban pop” label to it. Kelis usually sounds great on tracks where she can exude power in some type of “I got you”/allegiance manner.

**throwaway-7650** (10): probably the only song on this album that's actually futuristic tbh

**celladonn** (9): This has a really cool sound

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Imagine if you got robbed at gunpoint, but the gunman was singing this… I’d be too busy vibing to be afraid, they could just take my money. The stock video game sound effects in the background are kinda taking me out, in a good way.

**qazz23** (9): it's a robbery if this leaves early

**welcome2thejam** (9): This inspired me, my "commit crimes to pick up women" plan is gonna be epic

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): i love just how out there the beat goes. at one point there's a theremin, and the main beat sounds like a funeral organ. wild and clever and cool.

**runaway3212** (8.6): I love this laid back vibe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i just think the bridge

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song was done DIRTY by YouTube compression

**EnCaine** (7.5): please rob me

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): wtf is with the corny ghost noises

**BaconShoes** (7): a vibe

# this is a robbery
**bbfan132** (7): kind of lethargic, could grow on me though?

**BeauMeringue212** (7): very meh on the 8 bit ringtone loop but idk, Kelis kinda sells it anyway

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what’s a stick up

**2dina3dworld** (6.2): put your hands up in the air! I’m stealing your heart uwu… and all your money!

**1998tweety** (5): that rihanna shy ronnie song washed

**IIIHenryIII** (5): please, take only what you need, leave what you don't

**nt96** (8.8): Honestly I kinda liked this track. A nice callback to a more soulful era. A bit robbed I fear.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Probably my least favorite track on Tasty. This is supposed to be a song about heartbreak, but for some reason Kelis doesn’t sell it very well here? The amateur-ish lyrics and generic production (I keep forgetting this was a Neptunes cut) don’t help matters.

---
#We're on a roll
**2dina3dworld** (10): spotify spells “garbage” as “gargabe” in their official lyrics for this song

**runaway3212** (10): kelis's voice can be so pretty sometimes

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): "instead of scorin' high in college, we're scorin' high in garbage" took me OUT

**CrimsonROSET** (8): rolling with the homies~!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i can’t tell if this is her bf or just a random guy who she loves but has never talked to

**MrSwearword** (8): in a way, I can’t stand the Kaleidoscope throwback sound but I can understand why this track exists on Tasty. It shows that despite the direction of Tasty, The Neptunes and Kelis are a natural match.

**seanderlust** (8): "the world is yours, watch what you do with it" - the milkshakes lady

**bbfan132** (7.5): this song is kind of unmemorable but still good

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): the Deuxmoi girls when they have to take public transport

#In the city outskirts

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is a cute song but tbh it feels a bit like B-tier Mary J. Blige, with hints of Lauryn Hill/Jill Scott. If anything I think it would have been better for her to just lean in to that all the way and go even MORE soul with it (it worked on the Saadiq tracks) but then I guess that wouldn’t really be her, huh?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the bridge was nice but this drags for no reason

**IIIHenryIII** (7): hope you broke up with him and gave us a phenomenal heartbreak album

**maxisgold** (7): DON'T LET ALICIA KEYS LISTEN TO THIS SONG OR SHE'LL WANT TO RECREATE IT.

**1998tweety** (6.5): cant relate

**BaconShoes** (6.5): wasn’t doing too much for my sonically but then i kinda got into it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): ohhh I can hear the Pharrell influence on this melody from the first notes… shame he’s on autopilot because this beat and melody is something he could make in his sleep

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): good lyrical content, but the entirety of the song just comes across to me as a lesser attempt towards an Erykah Badu song. “Instead of scoring high in college scoring high in garbage” is a clunky rhyming moment. Again like what the song is trying to do theme-wise, but doesn’t really achieve it for me

**Awkward\_King** (5): i do like this, i think kelis' vocals are the highlight of the song for me, but i definitely dont enjoy it as much as the songs up to this point

**throwaway-7650** (4): spotify? why is garbage misspelled as "gargabe"

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Inner City Blues WHAT???? Living for the City WHO????

**fadedblue09** (8): A bit surprised to see this dead last. IMO, Brandy does the cover justice and Ray J isn’t too bad either, but y’all clearly disagreed.

---

**seanderlust** (10): aw this is such a sweet duet! very charming

**maxisgold** (8.5): Kinda like an Michael/Janet collab that doesn't exist.

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Brandy's tone is just lovely on this, the song beat and lyrics are also giving me Mariah just a little bit

**fairytalehigh** (8): brandy sounds amazing as always but GOSH some of these lines are extra. "i apologize for all the things i've done / but now i'm underwater AND I'M DROWNING" like CHILL y'all

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): This whole track sounds pretty but I’m glad it’s a bonus track lol. Kind of wish there was a different singer like Joe here, sorry Brandy’s brother

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): it's pleasant but sung by siblings is #not it

**BaconShoes** (6.5): not my favorite but they sounded good together

**Bordersz** (5.8): I don't like Ray J.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): not really a huge fan of these siblings doing this song but I do highly recommend listening to both the PM Dawn version and the Gambino cover, fantastic song

**MrSwearword** (5): still don't care

**plastichaxan** (4): I asked why we weren’t rating this in the main rate and I can see why this is a terrible closer for the album too fdsjlkjdfsl

**babadork** (3): It might be okay if it wasn’t for the incest vibes.

**fadedblue09** (7): If my research was right, this track was intended for NSYNC, and you can hear how much it sounds like a 90s teen pop ballad. I have a soft spot for that sound, hence my relatively high score, but I get how it can come across as plain and cheesy compared with the other ballads on the album. 

 Much like He Is, this track was bottom 5 for most of the rate, and tbh I’m surprised it narrowly escaped in the end, as those 2 0s didn’t show up until the last few days of rate voting.

**nt96** (7): Social distance sweetie pls n thx

---

#I wanna get closer to this song
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this has 90’s R&B ballad written all over it and I’m love that. Taking me back to thinking I’m in my feels and grown, even if I’m only 8 years old watching SNICK on a Saturday night

**throwaway-7650** (10): the song title is begging for a tegan & sara interlude

**1998tweety** (9.5): this is beautiful omg

**akanewasright** (9.5): WHAT A GOOD KEY CHANGE

**bbfan132** (9): this is super cheesy but i still think it’s adorable

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): she’s literally just running victory laps at this point

**indiefan** (9): Cheesy and Formulaic? Possibly. Do I still love it? Absolutely

**MassiveThief** (9): This sure is a ballad from the 2000s. Done very well though!

**runaway3212** (9): this is literally so beautiful I almost cried but I subtracted one point because she almost made me cry and as a bad bitch I can't believe she would do that to me

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): really not a fan of these 90s adult-contemporary productions, they instantly date this album, BUTTTTTT this song is very sweet.

**seanderlust** (8.6): a very romantic slow jam! brandy's voice sounds particularly gorgeous here.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): her vocals are divine (Ariana might be right)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): one of the best ballads in the rate

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): okay Cage the Elephant

**CrimsonROSET** (7): stranger danger

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s basic… but not bad

**BaconShoes** (6.5): she sounds good but it’s not my favorite

**EnCaine** (6.5): the start is like brandy doing a savage garden song, which should fill my gay little heart with joy but. anyway, she murders the back half and mostly redeems it

**TiltControls** (6): the only sort of miss on the album for me, and even then it's still fine

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds like a Christian camp song

**MrSwearword** (5): I'm keeping six feet from this album in the future, but thanks gurl

**nt96** (7.8): Oh my, spice up your sex life a little more, why don’t you? Kelis spared no punches with this song and the grimy beat compliments this quite well. Don’t even get me started on Nas….

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Now this one turned out to be really controversial, as it nabbed multiple elevens AND zeroes. Kelis and then-boyfriend Nas’ ode to exhibitionism turned out to be too much for popheads voters, with the latter’s rap verse drawing a lot of flak as you can read in the comments. 

Personally, like most of you, I scored this low initially, as I hated Nas’ contribution as well. But after reading some of the positive comments, I realized I was being way too harsh for a feature, considering Kelis was the star after all. If there’s anyone who can sell as song as raunchy as this , it’s Kelis. In the end, I still couldn’t give it full marks but I definitely appreciate the song way more now.

---

#exhibitionists
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): The sexual energy of this song is so incredibly powerful, I played this for a unicorn and it ended up fisting me!

**jay slay yas** (11): best song ive ever heard

**EnCaine** (10): Nas is one of the great modern philosophers

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Kelis said ”YES kink at Pride!”

**plastichaxan** (10): The pussy or the mouth, that is the question

**welcome2thejam** (10): Had to pause and think about my life after that Nas verse though

**bulforster** (9.9): that persistent synth line is somehow the horniest part of this song and i love it

**babadork** (9.7): This might have got a little corny with age, but I think that actually makes the song better.

**BaconShoes** (9.5): for the horny sluts only!!

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): I never knew Nas was an OBGYN, work

**seanderlust** (9.1): "the pussy or the mouth, that is the question"

**Awkward\_King** (9): nas must have incredible game for him to have put bars like those on her own song and still end up in bed with her

**bbfan132** (9): that line is camp (that term should be retired but this is an exception)

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Timbaland ain't here, but it's freaky freaky freaky

**qazz23** (9): love the beat in this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): What can I say? It’s my fetish

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): i'm not going to let "the pussy or the mouth? that is the question" ruin what is otherwise a solid sexy bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): gonna kindly ignore their personal history (and Nas’s terrible verse) and yass over this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): Sorry it has the lyrics “zoom into your womb” otherwise this was a fun and flirty track

**1998tweety** (8): i hate going out

**apatel27** (8): Why is she so horny

**frogaranaman** (8): do u think any of these girlies have gotten caught

**maxisgold** (8): 9 for the beat, -1 because of Nas.

**TiltControls** (7.5): a bop! though the lyrics... are memorable, I'll give it that

**you2009** (7.5): "zoom on Ur womb" vs. "breastesses is my breakfast" steel cage match

#Prudes

**jackisboredtoday** (7): honestly should have a higher score but Nas kinda didn’t offer much as a feature & it hurts the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): not gonna get too descriptive with my comment here for obvious reasons but uhh…yeah maybe dont have sex in public!!

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): “zoom in your womb” didn’t know Nas was an ultrasound technician

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): commiting crimes has never sounded so unsexy

**celladonn** (6): Taking this opportunity to come out as a prude

**genIVsupremacy** (6): who can I take to court for making me listen to the absolutely awful lyric of "I can zoom in your womb"

**MrSwearword** (6): the fourth and final single released from the album. On the plus side, Kelis can sell the idea of being a powerful, sexual figure. The beat is decent but it doesn’t do enough for Kelis’ natural abilities. Nas is rather inconsequential on the song.

**Bordersz** (5.5): Nas' verse was OK.

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): Fuck Nas

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I LOVE the beat, but some of the lyrics make me cringe (especially in the rap). The song is also a bit uncomfortable since she accused nas of being abusive.

**runaway3212** (4): no let's not

**flavasavavandal** (2): this is possibly the most unsexy song I’ve ever heard about having sex in public

**throwaway-7650** (2): this is arguably more uncomfortable than the intro tbh

**2dina3dworld** (1): “zoom in your womb”, I think this ode to exhibitionism was already uncomfortable for me as a prude but that was such a bad line

**CrimsonROSET** (0): it’s insane just how much the guest verse brings it down, like i’m usually the type who’s like ‘oh just ignore it’ but i think i’ve found my limitation

**MassiveThief** (0): honestly not terrible musically, but the lyrics make me wish I lacked ears. please do not fuck by all those trees I'm begging you

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I need to scrub that Nas verse from my mind

**nt96** (9): that outro is gorgeous and dramatic....until that swallow part lol. Honestly this song is great and I'm not taking any criticism

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Kelis suffers yet another blow as she loses her closing track Marathon. It’s definitely one of the more “out there” songs on the album sound-wise, displaying some subtle trip-hop influences, and the outro displays some of her most stunning vocals. While I do find it intriguing, I wished it utilized its runtime better, as I find it quite monotonous and repetitive until the outro kicks in. 

This track got a bizarre amount of support from a certain loud minority of raters, even among people who weren’t keen on Tasty. Well, I guess those people would be surprised to find out that this song NEVER made it beyond Day 1, and was a bottom 10 song for almost the whole rate.

---

#I'm running for you
**indiefan** (10): Hands down the best closing track on here.

**throwaway-7650** (10): the vocals at the end? ok come through ms. brandy kelis!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.8): yeah this is just an ethereal way to end an album

**plastichaxan** (9.5): perfect bop to close the album and the rate

**shipperondeck** (8.6): sounds beautiful but what's this about since being a little girl

**bulforster** (8.5): this is such a weird note to end the album on. i dig it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): Kelis’ chamber pop era? ok!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): First half is cute but wow this turns into something REALLY interesting and unexpected at the end. The only other Kelis album I’ve listened to is *Flesh Tone* and you can totally hear a hint of the electronic wonderland soundscape she’d go for on that album here.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.3): chorus harmonies are gorgeous

**celladonn** (8): I really like the bass and strings

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me finishing this rate 1 minute before it was due

**flavasavavandal** (8): I’m gonna be nice to Kelis and pretend the outro doesn’t exist

**qazz23** (8): neat bassline and good outro to close the album

**welcome2thejam** (8): Imagine running for somebody, couldn't be me

**fairytalehigh** (7.9): i feel like it's kind of a weak note for the album to end on. it's a pretty song but she's so mellow (right until the very end) that it kinda loses me.

**bbfan132** (7.5): interesting closer, i like the dreamy-ish outro

**akanewasright** (7): this outro wait…

**Stryxen** (7): ok now… eat

#I'm running away from you

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): good but that outro goes way longer than it needed to

**Bordersz** (6.7): Great vocals toward the end.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): she sounds so haunting on this song and like for what. like its good but for what 😭😭

**BaconShoes** (6): i like the chorus part but the rest is a bit clunky

**MrSwearword** (6): it’s not a bad track for another artist, but this is a poor closer for the album which sadly isn’t new for Kelis [looking right at “Wouldn’t You Agree”]. The sultry vocals are also aren’t complimented by the beat.

**genIVsupremacy** (5.9): giving Luigi's Haunted Mansion realness

**1998tweety** (5.5): album took a bit of a dip there at the end

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Uhh cool Kelis?

**runaway3212** (4): this is a boring closer

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Popheads continues to display its ballad hatred by eliminating the breakup-themed Apart. Compared to the previous Brandy eliminations, this one has some subtle futuristic elements to it. The highlight for me is the Middle Eastern-influenced intro and the catchy chorus, but other than that, I can see why it’s an early out. 

Also, I’d like to point out that, up until the last few days before the deadline, this song literally has less than 5 comments, which sent me so much. I thought that was a telltale sign of it being an unremarkable filler song, but it did get more comments in the end, including a (very surprising) 11.

**nt96** (7): I'm a bit surprised to see this go soon, I love how pretty it sounds. The wailing sample honestly sounds like something EDM producers would use today.

---

#We'll never be apart
**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): The melody is so inventive and addicting to me. The strings make it sound so pretty and the background sample makes for such a unique song. I can’t stress enough how obsessed I am with this song.

**jay slay yas** (10): 11 contender

**throwaway-7650** (10): hied was a system of institutionalized racial oppression that existe-

**runaway3212** (9): omfggg insanity

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): it's wild how forward-thinking this is: the sampled wail at the beginning, the vocal layering, the way it sounds like she's singing with a recording of herself. this wouldn't have sounded out of place on ungodly hour

**BaconShoes** (8): i was enjoying the bass 😌

**celladonn** (8): I really like the chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song is so weird because like… who is this dude that doesn’t want to spend time with Brandy? Did he not hear the last six tracks on this album? She sounds like the hottest girlfriend ever.

**MrSwearword** (8): there are better breakup songs but this is again...cute.

**bbfan132** (7.5): v pleasant

#I'm better off apart from this song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): GET HIS ASS!

**frogaranaman** (7): the lyrics sound like a therapy session

**shipperondeck** (7): the ending into the transition is really cool but everything else is eh

**TiltControls** (7): I love Brandy's delivery here, but the song could use a bit more

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): when she couldn't get another hit other than the boy is mine

**bulforster** (5.3): There's uncharacteristically little development in the vocal arrangement across the song.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I kinda don’t like how the music sounds like it’s trying to catch up to itself

**Awkward\_King** (4): the random dial up modem sounds in the background kinda sending ngl

**nt96** (8.5): It's a bit rough around the edges but honestly I feel that perhaps nostalgia took a role in me scoring this. Its very 2000s but that's not a bad thing, at least not for me.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): It’s an okay track. Kelis delivers a solid performance as always, but it’s quite repetitive and the production sounds basic for the Neptunes and thus it ends up falling within filler territory. Not surprised to see this as a Day 1 cut, but surely we’ve eliminated enough from Kelis already?

---

#people with a healthy heart
**Awkward\_King** (10): this might be the pussiest song to ever pussy

**MrSwearword** (10): the production is pert near immaculate and Kelis’ delivery can make an admittedly tacky sounding chorus sound so heartfelt.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Irresistible Neptunes groove and hook, fits Kelis like a glove

**bbfan132** (8.5): definition of a fun early mid-00s neptunes song

**akanewasright** (8): This feels like it’s sorta Pharrell on autopilot, but like… I’ll take it

**BaconShoes** (8): i gotta protect my heart!!!

**celladonn** (8): Very catchy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): do what’s best for u bestie

**fairytalehigh** (8): it kinda gets lost between the high points of "flashback" and "millionaire." i like her chemistry with pharrell though

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I'm a sucker for breakdowns

**maxisgold** (8): Pharrell Williams you will always be famous.

**Stryxen** (8): this reminds me of make the bus by janelle why?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): honestly this song could also work as a super literal song in a vampire musical

**bulforster** (7.5): bit above average neptunes fare, so pretty close to great

**TiltControls** (7.5): some medieval chest armor should do the trick

#might get a heart attack

**1998tweety** (6.5): me when im playing paintball

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): I was into the production here but Kelis’ singing kind of underwhelms and the chorus is kind of nothing? Like the same note? Not into it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A bit cheesy

**Bordersz** (5.4): A bit of a drag, but the beat is slick.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why does she sing “I gotta protect my heart” like that?

**throwaway-7650** (5): mario party ass beat [derogatory] also #PHARRELL_OUT

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I usually eat songs about this particular subject up so I wanted to love this but unfortunately it leaves me really flat… the production is just so boring and empty for The Neptunes, and they made Kelis sound lifeless (which is a shame because her voice is one of the album’s biggest assets).

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): uhm

**runaway3212** (3): the way I kinda hate kelis's vibe on this part of the album

**fadedblue09** (10): As much as I wanted an Aaliyah track to go, why did y’all choose this? I really love the bubbling production of the instrumental here, and Aaliyah’s vocals in the chorus are so clear and stunning, and she really nails the sentiment of evoking nostalgia. This wouldn’t have been my choice for first out but I guess beggars can’t be choosers.

**nt96** (10): I swear we must've been listening to something different cuz this song was ROBBED RECKLESSLY. Something about that beginning gives me early morning airport vibes. I just love it! Easily one of my favorite deep cuts on the album.

---

#walking in the park
**frogaranaman** (10): it's insane how Aaliyah can just have the most forward thinking production ever and it's on a song about having public sex once

**bbfan132** (9.5): :listening:

**bulforster** (9.5): The intro reminds me of the aether paradise theme from pokemon, so I always immediately feel positively towards it

**shipperondeck** (8.8): the bubbliness in this is so good

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): love the chorus but i feel like this is one of the less remarkable songs on this album.

**BaconShoes** (8): a bit less interesting than the rest of the album, but it’s still great

**1998tweety** (7.5): @ 6 year old me

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): as of now, it feels like a grower

#Not in a nostalgic mood

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ohhhh when we were yong

**fickle\_music\_788** (7): You know an album’s an absolute classic when the worst song is still pretty good!

**akanewasright** (6.5): for some reason this gets stuck in my head a lot for a fairly mid song

**ImADudeDuh** (6): at least its better than that horrible tv theme song to that old show i don’t remember the name of

**runaway3212** (6): this is such a boring sentiment literally drop the flop already

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): She sounds pretty of course but other than that it’s meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): a few interesting intervals elevate this but it’s otherwise a bit too flat for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): the intro for this gave me higher hopes for how this song was gonna sound than it eventually did

**MrSwearword** (5): a rule I have, unless you're Lauryn Hill, anything about the past is just a no when the song can't back up whatever you're selling.

**fadedblue09** (8): In hindsight, I may have overscored this but whatever. The combination of the guitar and beats makes for a sick and memorable production but looking back, some of the backing vocals in the chorus can sound really grating and nearly overshadowing Aaliyah’s own vocals. I can see an argument for this being an early out.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Popheads were clearly not here for Brandy’s ballads as we now witness the exit of Love Wouldn’t Count Me Out. Brandy’s vocals here are solid as always, even if I feel like it’s too dramatic and teetering on soap opera theme territory sometimes. I think this also got harmed by its position in the tracklist, being surrounded by a gazillion other ballads in the back half.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Another deeply 90s ballad that I’m living. I was literally losing my mind listening to Celine Dion’s “Falling Into You” this year, this is very much my thing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): teared up at the end of the bridge tbh

**1998tweety** (9): Lauv would never

**akanewasright** (9): the outro 😢

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.8): i wasnt really paying attention to the lyrics the first time i heard this and i was about to comment this sounds like a nice song to play at a wedding…boy thank god i checked what the lyrics were before i wrote that

**BeauMeringue212** (8.6): the strings are a bit Disney Movie/Kingdom Hearts vibes but still a great ballad

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): the vocal layering in the chorus is just exquisite, what can i say.

**TiltControls** (8.5): I'm a sucker for a solid string section

**CrimsonROSET** (8): THE DAMN SPARKLE

**MrSwearword** (8): this would've made sense on one of her earlier albums. It's good but on this album just...feels out of place.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Got enough of a flair for the dramatic to peak my interest

#too many ballads to count

**bbfan132** (7): gorgeous but not super interesting

**BaconShoes** (6): less interesting than the others for me

**frogaranaman** (6): why does she say "I believe" like they do in Hamilton

**runaway3212** (6): the first half is boring but she slayed the second part

**shipperondeck** (6): im sorry these songs are not my kind of thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I had to roll my eyes at this one, sorry. Her voice is great as always, but that hackneyed dramatic orchestration is just toooo much

**Bordersz** (5): It's OK? A bit of a drag. It is a slow ballad alright.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): too many ballads already

**fadedblue09** (10): At this point, I am convinced y’all have some secret collective vendetta against u/Mrswearword or something because there is literally no reason for this to go out this early! Originally a cut off Kelis’ forgotten album Wanderland, this song has one of the Neptunes’ most memorable beats, and Kelis’ carefree delivery perfectly fits with the raunchy lyrics. I’m sad because not only this is one of my favorites on Tasty, but on Wanderland as well, and if the results tell us anything, maybe that album is better off unrated (not that it had a high chance to get rated to begin with). 

This song really had a tragic run, it started off as a Day 3 song, and with every ballot I got, it just kept sinking and sinking until it got… here. Literally a painful trajectory to watch.

**nt96** (9.5): It's gets a bit repetitive towards the end sadly

---

#Having flashbacks
**MrSwearword** (11): Ported from Wanderland and should’ve been a single because it manages to blend in on not just one but two albums. Summery, catchy pop is tough to do right without being kitschy or corny but this is so fucking great.

**akanewasright** (10): maybe I’ll just eat up anything Pharrell works on

**Awkward\_King** (10): having flashbacks to kelis' last rate performance i am fearful

**jay slay yas** (10): 11 contender

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): An 11 contender. What a song!!

**shipperondeck** (9.8): fav song on this album so far

**welcome2thejam** (9): I'm gonna take a swig of water and take a look at this album's wiki page. And if this song isn't produced by the Neptunes, my phone's about to become a splash zone.

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): the part where she sings "you make me come... giggle alive"? icon behavior

**BaconShoes** (8.5): smooth as hell

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Kelis when she goes out before the Top 10: yup, that’s me… you’re probably wondering how I got here? Anyways, this song is really elevated by its bridge.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): tokyo drift!

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): ok the “you make me come [pause] alive” fully sent me

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Leggggs and hips and.... BODY

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): YASSS IT’S HERE FROM THE UNDERRATED (AND HIDDEN) ALBUM WANDERLAND! The production here is HOT! Love it. And Kelis sounds great here. Everything here works.

**EnCaine** (8): cum 😭

**oscarbrierley1** (8): the best Neptunes beat on the album. Originally on her album wanderland which is probably why I like it.

**bbfan132** (7.5): doesn’t fully satisfy me sonically but it’s fine for what it is

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): you make me cum… alive

#would rather forget

**1998tweety** (7): i get these at night sometimes

**bulforster** (7): pretty standard neptunes fare, so still pretty good

**CrimsonROSET** (7): storytime

**frogaranaman** (7): I think an investment in a vibrator might be necessary

**indiefan** (7): Hook’s a bit too repetitive, but still not too bad.

**maxisgold** (7): Reminds me of the Tokyo Drift song pls.

**runaway3212** (7): pretty cute bop

**Bordersz** (6.4): I was not expecting the lyrics to be so upfront and sexual.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): YOU 😩 MAKE 😩 ME 😩 CUM ……..alive

**seanderlust** (5.3): i don't know what it is about the chorus that bothers me - the falsetto "yeah, yeah" just adds a vagueness that doesn't work in a song so specific that it clocks the brand of malt liquor the man was buying

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): this song would be so good if the last minute didn’t exist

**throwaway-7650** (0): 3 of the world's worst alarm clocks are going off simultaneously

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ok but this sounds amazing. That guitar! Sublime!

**seanderlust** (9.2): oh work it literally is a phil collins cover! love it

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): honestly? a classic, i love it. it all works.

**BaconShoes** (8): i vaguely know the original and this was a cool version

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok i wasn’t expecting this to actually use the phil collins song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.8): this lowkey sounds like a backstreet boys ballad

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): with Ray J Another*, I trust YouTube

**Bordersz** (6): Why is Ray J doing a piss poor Michael Jackson impersonation. Music jail. Good lord. Brandy is fantastic on here though.

**plastichaxan** (6): I think I understand the “I want a Kanye not a Ray-J” and I don’t even like Kanye dsjlfflskd

**TiltControls** (5.5): please be a phil collins cover please be a phil collins cover please be a phil collins cover... yasss. also this cover wasn't amazing

**MrSwearword** (5): I still don't care

**flavasavavandal** (3): I’m just left confused as to why this is a duet

**babadork** (2): Making it a duet does make it a bit better than the original, but it is still condescending.

**fadedblue09** (8): And we end our first day of the rate reveal by not letting Kelis catch a break! We lose another Neptunes bop, this time we have the appropriately-titled Sugar Honey Iced Tea, which is smooth and sweet as it sounds. It’s a bit lowkey in relative to the rest of Tasty, but I enjoy it. Like Flashback, I feel like this left too early but y’all seem to really hate Kelis so

**nt96** (8): it's cute

---

#so sweet
**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh i fuck with this so hard

**seanderlust** (10): i am obsessed with the energy on this track. positive and confident and lovely

**you2009** (10): real block party music

**Stryxen** (9.5): SHIT???????/

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i love whenever the baby(?)/autotune voice comes in it reminds me of sophie’s vocals from product

**TiltControls** (8): tasty

**Bordersz** (7.8): Lush harmonies.

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): did anyone else get in trouble for saying this as a kid cause it spells out shit

**bulforster** (7.4): pretty standard neptunes fare, so still pretty good

#Sugar free

**flavasavavandal** (7): sorry but Marty was first

**frogaranaman** (7): oh it spells "SHIT" got it

**throwaway-7650** (7): download this song free here on youtubepromo.com

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I for one think this album would be more complete with more songs referencing food items

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): this glides along nicely with a spacey beat, but feels way too chill for me

**1998tweety** (6): kelly clarkson ended

**BaconShoes** (6): yeah i’m not crazy about it but it’s not bad

**BeauMeringue212** (6): this is definitely an album track

**MrSwearword** (5): considering Kelis and Pharrell/The Neptunes have an extended history, this beat is surprisingly subdued and weak while the chorus is an afterthought and a half. At least it can come across “jazzy” but this is mostly weak as fuck.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): it’s giving your cousin singing along to some oldies at the cookout

**IIIHenryIII** (3): too much sugar will get you sick
