**fadedblue09** (8): And we commence our second day by resuming our slaughter of Tasty! On this track, Kelis pleads for her lover’s attention amidst a rocky relationship on this funky-flavored, soulful beat by Raphael Saadiq. For most of the rate, this was bound to be a Day 1 cut like its fellow songs on Tasty. I do like this song a fairer bit than some of the earlier eliminations from the album, so I’m glad it survived (even if only narrowly).

**nt96** (7.5): A pretty standard Neptunes beat, but I can't help but feel like it's a little...filler-ish? It's a bit stagnant for me, but it barely made it passed day 1 there's that. 

---

#Center of attention
**Awkward\_King** (10): me too tbh

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I love the production on this so much, it could very easily be too much and sound crazy but I love the bassline and synths on this

**shipperondeck** (9.7): get fucked charlie puth

**throwaway-7650** (9): "you make my heart monsoon" is a... phrase

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): LOVE the production on this one, i pick out new details every time. currently fixed on that weird warping synth noise that runs through the beat. my favorite of the two saadiq collabs

**bbfan132** (8.5): love the production!!! she sounds great with raphael producing

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): and here he is again, showing up, André or Nas why couldn’t you be more like Rafael

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I’m interested.

**bulforster** (8.3): nice groove on this one

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this already has a better melody and energy than the previous section. The vision of the Rafael side of this album shines here

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended charlie puth

#Does not need attention

**BaconShoes** (7): boppin a lil

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this converse well with attention by Charlie Puth

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Funky

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): she said “I just want attention, i just want your heart <3”

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i mean his verse wasnt that good the first time around bringing him back was brave

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.3): its kinda cute i guess

**MrSwearword** (4): on a Raphael Saadiq album, this would make sense. On Tasty, this is kind of a sore thumb especially considering Kelis’ vocals aren’t complimented well on this track.

**fadedblue09** (8): Like yesterday, we continue our culling of the Full Moon ballads. Although I do consider this to be better than the back half ballads, so I’m glad this one made it a little further. This ballad showcases more of the vocal layering and harmonies Brandy is known for. In addition, we hear more of her runs and adlibs here, elevating it slightly above filler territory.

**nt96** (6.5): Another day, another case of Balladphobia. It's a bit meh for me, I'm fine with this leavin

---

#it's everything
**BeauMeringue212** (10): She really sells the emotion on this track and makes the lyrics feel very heartfelt

**Bordersz** (10): This sounds like the gates of heaven opening up.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m here to save the back half from balladphobia. This is so lush and delicate. We could never have a quiet storm or 90s slow jams rate, it’s sad!! Her passionate singing towards the end, BEAUTIFUL!

**shipperondeck** (9.7): the HORNS !!!

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): half the tracklist is really just kindergarten spelling bee scramble

**1998tweety** (9): ascending

**akanewasright** (9): the outro 🥺 but also please get some self worth

**cremeebrulee** (9): transcendental outro

**runaway3212** (9): I so vibe with brandy's voice

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): So pretty… Sing it Brandy!!!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Beautiful track

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): what I love about r&b is that it can make not respecting yourself as an individual sound so sexy and romantic… you’re right bestie, I don’t matter without my man, that’s so true

**bbfan132** (8): maybe not the most notable ballad but i’m into it!!

**fairytalehigh** (8): like "when you touch me," the production just screams 90s adult-contemporary (and not in a good way) but its saving grace is still being a great vocal showcase for brandy.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Ne-Yo plagiarized this, didn't he? 😡

**maxisgold** (8): One thing about Brandy, she's the master of harmonizing.

#this is nothing

**BaconShoes** (7): the production wasn’t as interesting on this one but of course the vocals are gorgeous

**seanderlust** (6.5): i'm convinced the breakdown here is what inspired this tweet: https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c9/bd/5f/c9bd5f87d26051d437310178430ee9b2--meme-to-the.jpg

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ah yes, the ‘i am in love so suddenly i no longer have any friends or significant others’ trope

**MrSwearword** (6): she is trying her hardest to sell lukewarm goods on this album, bless her.

**plastichaxan** (6): what it gave

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this sounds like a lock for bottom 5 tbh

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): ok the album isnt like bad but it is starting to blur together quite a bit

**Stryxen** (3.5): this lasted so long and yet nothing stuck with me

**ImADudeDuh** (3): what i feel when listening to this

**nt96** (8): this is where the album takes a darker turn as it delves into the realm of abusive relationships. Its bluesy soundscape really underscores the lyrics here.

**fadedblue09** (5): This really should’ve gone Day 1 tbh. The rainy-day jazz atmosphere is a nice touch but for a 4-minute song, very little happens here to that point it feels like a 6-minute song instead. Lyrically, it’s just an inferior retread of the other album cuts, which makes this more unnecessary.

---

#I want more of this song

**indiefan** (11): Something about the bridge is just so infectious to me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I don’t want Aaliyah to be sad :(

**BaconShoes** (9): the deep bass with her voice and the lyrics…NEVER NO MORE!!!

**bbfan132** (9): these lyrics… i don’t really know what to say

**frogaranaman** (9): I was about to comment "this hits hard" but on second thought that seems wildly inappropriate, so

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): great storytelling on this song, this feels like the kind of thing an old timey lounge singer would perform

**maxisgold** (9): She was SANGIN'.

**1998tweety** (8.5): boppy

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): i originally thought this song was a bit too slow but when you really sit with the lyrics... woah. chilling, really.

**Bordersz** (8.4): I HELD MY PILLOW TIIIGHT.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh this is just soooo slick

**throwaway-7650** (8): everything/one else kind of outshines aaliyah herself here

#No more of this song pls

**akanewasright** (7): Her vocals >>> everything else on the track… but the vocals though

**TiltControls** (7): I think it gets a bit lost in the shuffle compared to the songs around it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Like the jazzy sound but if I’m being honest it’s a tad boring

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i think any song following the run of tracks before is kinda set up but i dont think this is that bad

**runaway3212** (6): a tad boring

**celladonn** (5.5): Good lyrics but a bit boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): its not bad i guess but i have no desire to ever relisten to this

**MrSwearword** (5): the production knocks but the song itself should be better.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): "I wanted a future, who cares 'bout the past?" Even in the context of the song, this hurts

**nt96** (8): As much as I love this album, this may actually be my least favorite track there. While it's a good song, it doesn't compare to the others. Let's no forget to mention the strings, which give the song a rather mischievous vibe that takes me out.

**fadedblue09** (4): this was my lowest score in the whole rate and naturally, I’m baffled to see it make it this far. IMO the cartoonish, funky beat does not suit Aaliyah’s mature vocals, and it ends up sounding really awkward within the album. This track was probably added to display her versatility, but in my opinion, it failed big time.

---

#smooth

**akanewasright** (10): why is the intro serving “sneaks up behind a man in a children’s cartoon”

**Awkward\_King** (10): i love the rhyming patterns of the verses

**BaconShoes** (10): i just love this one so much idk it’s a smash!! Clowning on him while actually being effortlessly smooth as Aaliyah does

**bbfan132** (10): this production is super fun

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): Love how new elements get added onto the song as it progresses and the beat just gets crazier.

**frogaranaman** (10): there is a food joke in there somewhere

**you2009** (10): this pink panther ass song

**shipperondeck** (9.7): i have listened to this too many times i fear

**babadork** (9.3): This is one of my favorite examples of how 00s R&B sounds both like the 70s and the future.

**qazz23** (9): lives up to the title

**runaway3212** (9): extra extra good

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): my peanut butter be like

**1998tweety** (8.5): my skin cant relate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): sounds like the Trick Me-print

**BeauMeringue212** (8): the distorted bass on this is so cool but the end kinda fizzles out a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (8): why do parts of this sound like american life by madonna

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): camp 8

**DirtyRat583** (8): this one is catchy

**jackisboredtoday** (8): now why did that intro make me think about the stray cat strut

**seanderlust** (8): aaliyah bestie this is not a relatable problem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me after i shave my legs

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): extra good

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): how i like my peanut butter

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): squidward type beat

**apatel27** (7): This is a gorillaz beat

**celladonn** (7): The production here is pretty bizarre... I kind of dig it?

#rough

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Honestly, mood. If this came out today people would call it Tik Tok bait

**MrSwearword** (7): another case of production doing the heavy lifting

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): heightist (this is a real word according to google) anthem

**Bordersz** (5.5): Acquired taste.

**Stryxen** (5): something is squelching in the background

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I am not a fan of that bloppy bass

**indiefan** (3): "He got big brown ey-" SKIP

**nt96** (8): seeing people call this hyperpop is hilarious. You know what's not hilarious? Seeing this go so early! Despite the echo chamber slowly forming throughout discord, the outside world didn't seem to agree. Alas, we say goodbye to several 11s. What If indeed 😔

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I really like the idea of mixing R&B with hard rock but this song is letdown by its incoherent, nonsensical lyrics. Why is the song so aggressive? Is Aaliyah angry or simply channeling girlboss energy? Is she trying to seduce or taunt the man? I really want to like it more because it sounds cool but the half-assed lyrics leaves me cold towards it. 

We’re only halfway through the rate and we lost 6 11’s in one fell swoop. And for some heartbreaking news for the fans (and relief for the haters): despite all the vocal support behind this song, this song never made Day 3, let alone the top 20. In fact, this song spent riding between Days 1 and 2 before settling here. It looks like the potential divisiveness of the song was severely underestimated.

---

#what if....it's the best song ever
**bbfan132** (11): holy fuck this is amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (11): holy shit

**plastichaxan** (11): me when the song in FUTURISTIC R&B rate sounds futuristic: this is so ahead of its time whoa

**qazz23** (11): the beat is crazy good on this and i like how noisy it is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): how am i supposed to listen to a song with THAT intro and not immediately give it an 11

**thedoctordances1940** (11): What if this is the best song in the rate (it is)

**akanewasright** (10): why does that one descending guitar line that comes up around 1:04/1:44/2:38 sound like a Sonic the Hedgehog sound effect

**Awkward\_King** (10): what the fuck is going on in this song i love it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): how many raters are gonna call this hyperpop, i'm guessing at least five

**BaconShoes** (10): this one goes so crazy. This is one of the songs that makes me wish I could hear what she would have released next

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ROCK AND ROLL

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): Truly a shame she never got to collaborate with Trent Reznor but at least this track gave us a taste at what they could’ve made together.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this deserves a 10 just for how groundbreaking it sounds. What a legend!

**indiefan** (10): R&B with Rock when done right >>>

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the SLAY

**throwaway-7650** (10): what if we kissed in the reddit comment section as this goes out?

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): aaliyah nailed a sound somewhere between dance-pop, industrial rock, and soul. it's hard to describe just how perfectly weird this song is, and to imagine what would have happened if she had continued chasing this sound. what if, indeed.

**1998tweety** (9): omg the rock serve

**EnCaine** (9): i wont call this hyperpop i wont do it

**shipperondeck** (9): THE GUITARSSSSSSSS (2)

**welcome2thejam** (9): A light banger

**oscarbrierley1** (8.7): maximalist in the best way

**bulforster** (8.2): go off!!

**maxisgold** (8): Janet's spirit possessed her in the studio.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): If you squint it’s kinda rock

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): the bass that sounds like a transformer >>>

#what if....i tank this

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i want to like it more but the production is just too in the forefront of the mix

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I appreciate her trying something different but the production is just too messy. If it was cleaned up and had less elements it would be better

**cremeebrulee** (5.6): damn maybe i am a hyperpop anti

**celladonn** (5.5): Some really cool elements to this production... I wish I liked it but I just don't think it really meshes

**MrSwearword** (5): a case of ambition gone awry, iCannot with this much clash.

**seanderlust** (3.7): i oscillate back and forth between loving how this song is mixed (for the same reason i like hyperpop) and viscerally hating it

**2dina3dworld** (3): the weird crunching guitar in the background really drags this down, as well as the wall of sound production.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): If you told me this was released posthumously by remastering unfinished demos I would believe you… Aaliyah is lucky there are interludes in this rate because this spells trouble for her averages lol

**MassiveThief** (1): ok uuuhhhh I'll pretend this beat doesn't exist. why is it so noisy.

**runaway3212** (1): what is the noise omg

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i know this is a fan fave but i find the production unlistenably grating

**fadedblue09** (8.5): And now Brandy is completely out of the bonus rate! In hindsight the whole bonus rate was a setup against her, given that she had B-sides going up against actual singles. As for the track itself, I ‘d say it’s decent, the weird spooky noises take a while to grow and it’s understandable why it got cut.


---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): a much better use of theremin in the rate

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): dare i say brandy sounds... menacing here? it really suits her too, holy shit. i gave this .5 for that outro alone

**fickle\_music\_788** (9.5): I had no clue this song existed! Japan and Australia lucked out with their bonus track compared to the UK and US which got the Ray J duets.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): would be a 10 if not for the sudden vocal chopping

**Bordersz** (9.2): I'm not fully understanding why this wasn't on the standard edition. What a banger. The chop and screwed vocals at the end is like a cherry on top.

**BaconShoes** (8.5): a bop

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): can we have full moon 20th anniversary with this on streaming please

**plastichaxan** (8): oh me too sometimes and this song just clicked with that…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this could be in the ooky spooky rate

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): this manages to feel both disjointed but also kinda slays?

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it's very obvious the reason why wasn't included in the standard version of the album, but I still prefer it over one of the too many ballads

**welcome2thejam** (7): The touch of slightly spooky an album named Full Moon really needed

**MrSwearword** (5): don't care

**shipperondeck** (5): uhhh kinda weird? not in a good way?

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Is the youtube upload just shitty or is this some of the worst production i’ve ever heard?

**nt96** (9): The smooth neo-soul sound really takes me back. Something about it gives me a warm feeling.

**fadedblue09** (8): Now that we’ve nearly exhausted all of the Full Moon ballads, we proceed to eliminate this slick, sexy electro-R&B jam from Brandy. While I find this song serviceable, this is probably outshined by the other tracks in Full Moon’s front half, which is honestly a solid streak overall. Still, I enjoy it a fair bit, and ultimately this feels like the appropriate placement for it.

#i like this!
**jay slay yas** (10): 11 contender i fear

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Oh now THIS is fucking music

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): beautiful, lush arrangement. Brandy is very flirty and confident in her vocal delivery. The harmonizing in the bridge?! Euphoric

**fickle\_music\_788** (9.5): All In Me’s beat slowly creeping in towards the end is such a great detail.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Like this? Yeah I sure do bitch~ I’m gay but I’ll touch you however you want if you make it sound this good

**BeauMeringue212** (9): her lower register is sexy af

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i lost my virginity just in time for this rate wow

**BaconShoes** (8.5): i was groovin along

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): it's the way she sings "please--touch--me--like--thisss" that does it for me

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the beat is kinda meh, but it feels like a grower

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the back half kinda stomps the front half

**MrSwearword** (8): cute...but cute next to gorgeous?

**runaway3212** (8): literally great

**welcome2thejam** (8): Bro I think she really wants you to touch her

**nt96** (9.5):  My goodness, I'm ascending. This track is straight up beautiful and it literally feels like flowers blooming after a sun shower. I wished this would've ranked higher.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): As much as I wanted to grab the low hanging fruit (like most of y’all did), I honestly found this track more decent than I expected. This lush midtempo track is backed by subtle electro-beats and piano that illustrate the fluttering feeling of infatuation Aaliyah feels in this song.

---
#whatever it is, i like it
**Bordersz** (11): Such a fresh breath of air. It is a very "modern" song, like this came out in 2002? Her singing is very effortless, and it feel like a warm embrace singing about puppy love.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I absolutely love this song and I can’t articulate why. It’s so smooth and dreamy and the lyrics are so sweet and pastoral. Feels like I’m on a cloud

**seanderlust** (10): buttery smooth vocal runs. I could sink into this song like a warm bath

**welcome2thejam** (10): Great track placement of this song, goes in a completely different direction from the previous and I love it all the same.

**you2009** (10): this is the song that plays in my head whenever my mom sends me a glitter text "good morning" gif on whatsapp

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): actually its amazing

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): this is seriously such a pretty song. hearing her sing "if i'm a drink, you're my lemon squeeze" just gives me such a genuine warm fuzzy feeling.

**BaconShoes** (9): this song is just so lovely and comforting

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh i love a good bedroom jam

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Bella Thorne when asked what to call it

**shipperondeck** (8.8): me to aaliyah stans thanking me for giving this album an 8.9+ average

**bbfan132** (8.5): this production is beautiful!!

**bulforster** (8.3): I like how fragile this sounds, it suits one of the only innocent love songs on the album surrounded by heavier stuff.

**EnCaine** (8.3): If someone comments "It's Whatever" here we're fighting

**MrSwearword** (8): it's the fluttering vocals for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): When her voice is good it’s really good

**fadedblue09** (10): And now we lose the last Saadiq-produced track in the rate. This elimination personally stings, as it is my favorite non-single on Tasty and despite being relatively conventional within the album (which is I guess a reason why it survived the early slaughter), it showed a different side of Kelis. The bright neo-soul sound amusingly fits her, and gives her a chance to show off her often-underrated vocals. I’d like to think of this song as a prototype to her 2014 album Food. 

 Early on in the rate this was a Day 3 song and I’m sad it didn’t hold up, but considering how badly the rest of Tasty was slandered on Day 1, I guess this placement is a blessing. As a consolation, this is also our second least controversial track in the rate, which is a testament to how palatable it is compared to the rest of Tasty.

**nt96** (7): song's ok

---

#thank you for bringing to words why I like this song
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Okay now THIS is a song that lives up to the album title, this is some good fucking food. The more neo-soul leaning production works surprisingly well with Kelis’s more forward thinking electronic sound… like a lot of the songs on this album tend to be more staccato/stilted so hearing her do something with more of a flow is a real treat.
#glowing
**MrSwearword** (10): Kelis can handle very mature R&B/crossover pop and Saadiq’s production on this track works very well on the album.

**indiefan** (9.4): Something about Rafael just brings out those Neo-Soul vibes whenever he’s on a track.

**bbfan132** (9): i love kelis’s voice here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Kelis is trynna get me with this Essence Fest teas and it’s WORKING smdh

**oscarbrierley1** (9): one of the most retro songs on a futuristic rate, I kinda stan tho

**TiltControls** (9): Kelis really kills it with the groove and delivery here

**akanewasright** (8.5): this just makes me smile

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): We love a head empty, just vibes 2000s moment

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): more keen on kelis' verses than the chorus on this one, but it's hard to argue the production is anything less than top-notch.

**shipperondeck** (8.2): i love when songs start like this

**runaway3212** (8): iconic

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): What a groove

**1998tweety** (7.5): what my silly bands do in the dark

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I blame Rafael

**seanderlust** (6.1): lovely ode to growth. that said, somewhat forgettable between two extremely solid tracks

**nt96** (10):  if that 2 step part doesn't make you wanna slut drop, shame on you

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Perhaps the most textbook example of a futuristic R&B song, All in Me is one of Full Moon’s more unconventional tracks. Starting off as a glittery electropop track and then it transitions to a 2-step bridge that shows Brandy’s vocal versatility. My personal favorite part of this is the airy breakdown that follows the bridge, which makes me ascend into an ethereal plane. 

 Despite being one of the more vocally supported tracks in the rate, there were only a couple moments where this song narrowly made day 3, and for the most part it was mostly stuck in Day 2. I guess there was a silent minority of raters who couldn’t fully vibe with the track’s quirkier elements.

---

#i want all of this
**fickle\_music\_788** (11): Yeah I gotta give this my 11. One of the craziest and forward-thinking R&B/pop songs I’ve ever heard. The production getting turned on it’s head not once but TWICE for the bridge gets me so hyped every time.

**bbfan132** (10): this song is wild

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): INSERT OBLIGATORY HYPERPOP COMMENT. Anyway yeah, Rodney Jenkins’ production with the 2-step UK Garage bridge is so so inventive. Brandy is really a vocal master being able to sing over this very eccentric production. This album is just a masterclass in being subtle and refined but still boundary-pushing and experimental. This goes too hard! Obsessed!

**fairytalehigh** (10): one of my favorite productions in the rate. you have that twinkling synth racing up and down, the instrumental wouldn't sound out of place on a PC Music mix. then, that chorus! just heavenly.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the full one eighty in the bridge takes it to another level. I can't fathom how it goes from a very mediocre song to one of the best experiences I've ever had with music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen of taking credit for everything! And the bridge fucking SNAPPED

**plastichaxan** (10): ouu why did this remind me of my ex i don't like being reminded of people

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is so fucking wild oh my god

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 1:47 in, i’m sorry but how dare?

**throwaway-7650** (10): the keyboard/whatever instrument with the keys is goes CRAZY

**you2009** (10): pc music vol. 0

**shipperondeck** (9.8): that breakdown about halfway through? HOLY SHIT

**Awkward\_King** (9): wtf where did this slay come from

**BaconShoes** (9): when it switches up in the middle omg.

**frogaranaman** (9): "two step" oh just fuck me up already

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): When the tempo change happened I was in serious danger of dislocating my arm because I started waving it around too quickly omg

**qazz23** (9): love the switch to the fast-paced vocals midway through

**welcome2thejam** (9): After two straight "touch me" songs I thought a song titled All in Me was gonna be something very different

**akanewasright** (8.5): I think the mixing on the vocals here is throwing me off but I do really like it

**Bordersz** (8.5): The 2nd half of the song is godly in vocals. Damn.

**TiltControls** (8.5): the production is chaotic at times, but in such a good way

**EnCaine** (8.3): first half of this instrumental has, like, pokemon mystery dungeon nightcore energy(?)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the fast section outsold so much

**seanderlust** (8): I really like the ascending and descending xylophone line on this one! that said, the vocal melody doesn't really grab me much

**oscarbrierley1** (7.7): the 2 step lart really elevates what could've been a filler song

**bulforster** (7.6): She sounds so in command during her rap-sung part in the breakdown, which is why it's so weird that she sounds like she's struggling to keep up with that synth scale in the verses.

**1998tweety** (7.5): me when i bottom

**celladonn** (7.5): Was not feeling this at all at first but that weird bridge (?) section is so good

**babadork** (7.3): The squishy noises in this song are a little too much like a slime in a video game

#i want none of this

**MassiveThief** (7): is this... hyperpop? runs away as fast as fucking possible

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): are the vocals supposed to sound so muffled in this or

**runaway3212** (6.5): okay idk if im tripping but this instrumental is so similar to Girl Front's instrumental... I think it's literally the kpop brain worms getting to me

**2dina3dworld** (6): all of that? In YOU?

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): …proto hyper pop??

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): the production here is cool, and I usually like how Brandy sounds on stuff like this, but her vocal performance and the production feel SO mismatched on this

**genIVsupremacy** (4.9): this was a messy song omg the beat switch might as well have just started a whole new song.

**static\_int\_husp** (3): this is hyperpop (derogatory)

**Stryxen** (3): I don't like her vocals on this (other than like the outro) but it's just fine otherwise

**MrSwearword** (1): this is lurid, iCannot.

**fadedblue09** (9): One of the best things about Aaliyah’s self-titled is how it manages to dip its toes in various genres and still being firmly true to the album’s R&B roots. This track, for instance, blends electro-R&B with elements of Latin music. It’s easy to see such a move as a trendy attempt, but it honestly works and provides one of the album’s more flavorful moments. 

 Personally, this was a surprising placement considering how little discourse it generated among the raters, but I think it’s impressive and well-deserved.

#literature majors
**bbfan132** (10): i love how modern it sounds, this could come out today and still sound fresh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Is this another guiro? Okay but it sounds great. I am a sucker for this type of production and style

**oscarbrierley1** (10): love how this song combines two of the biggest trends of the time, latin inspired songs and electro/futuristic songs. The glitchy details on the vocals are so good.

**babadork** (9.8): It does seem like a waste to get Ron Blake on your song and not have a saxophone solo

**BaconShoes** (9): i love the kinda back and forth and of course the beat slays

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Really like the lyrics of this one, I love a song that’s kind of flexible in its meaning- she’s talking about how she’s “reading between the lines” of his behavior, but it’s phrased as a command so it’s also kinda like she’s asking him to do the same and understand that he needs to shape up.

**qazz23** (9): good use of horns

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): GET HIS ASS, BABY GIRL

**shipperondeck** (8.8): ooooo the groove of this one. OOOOOH

**1998tweety** (8.5): me to straights when they dont agree with my gay headcanons

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i am illiterate

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): that's something I struggle with

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): me trying to find my username on rank graphs

**bulforster** (8.1): love the group vocals in the bridge

**frogaranaman** (8): literature teachers be like

**TiltControls** (8): somewhere out there there's a cursed alternate universe where this was covered as a glee track about book reports

#dont wanna read into it too much
**runaway3212** (7): this misses something extra

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no this is not english class i do not want to interpret text

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Meh

**ImADudeDuh** (5): if he’s doing all this suspicious stuff, its not reading between the lines, its just reading what the lines are obviously saying

**MrSwearword** (5): this one just ain't holding up against the bangers and classiques.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): As we enter the top 20, Brandy takes another elimination with Anybody. As a lot of comments have pointed out, the track sees Brandy make her most convincing Aaliyah impression and I’m actually surprised there was no overlap in producers. The song has a dark sinister vibe, which fits the “relationship in secret” theme of the song.

---

#anybody like this song?
**babadork** (10): I really like how much this song shows off Brandy’s lower register.

**EnCaine** (10): i love darkchild

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): Love the breakbeats at the end!

**MrSwearword** (10): most of this album sucks, so I'm giving this breath of fresh air full marks too.

**plastichaxan** (10): every second of this song is so *chef’s kiss *

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): The production here is peak Darkchild

**BaconShoes** (9): BOPP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the beginning was very hyperpop-esque me likey

**throwaway-7650** (9): ou these lyrics... don't take it personally, don't take it personally

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended both Justin and Demi with ease

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this beat is like a better “break up with your girlfriend”

**akanewasright** (8.5): the outro with her lower range is so fucking heavenly

**bbfan132** (8.5): :listening:

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): if your partner is saying "you hurt me so much i'm embarrassed to admit we're together" you should rethink your life choices

**Bordersz** (8): This sounds like a Timbaland + Aaliyah song forreal, I had to re-check the credits while listening to it.

**frogaranaman** (8): don't ask don't tell teas

**IIIHenryIII** (8): are you that somebody?

**maxisgold** (8): A little Aaliyah moment.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): When the song starts I’m admittedly not that into it, but by the end it turns into a full on jam!

#anybody doesn't?
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like how adventurous the melody of this song is but it makes the lyrics kinda hard to follow, which is a pet peeve of mine

**CrimsonROSET** (7): wow we really are going on an ARC

**genIVsupremacy** (7): this sounds like it can be from Aaliyah's same album from this rate!

**runaway3212** (7): maybe don't put it into a song then

**TiltControls** (7): well then maybe you shouldn't have put it in a song

**Awkward\_King** (6): faded looking for people to do this rate:

**fadedblue09** (9): Brandy suffers yet another sting as she loses the standard edition closing track WOW. The upbeat bubblegum-infected R&B bop sees her celebrate a new and more reassuring relationship. While I’m skeptical of the idea of Full Moon being a supposed storyline-driven album, this does bring a triumphant conclusion to it. Overall, I’m impressed how this did, as I expected popheads to be dismissive towards these wholesome bops.

**fadedblue09** (10): So I had this little TIL moment that “loose rap” is actually slang for cheesy pick-up lines by suitors. Suddenly my interpretation of this song was flipped on its head. Either way, this track is a personal standout, the beat is very memorable and has lots of subtle complexity with its musical structures. I thought this song would be a Day 3 lock but we see it leave here.

**nt96** (9): I absolutely loved this track! It's just so effortlessly smooth and it complements Aaliyah's style as well.
 

---

#fell for the loose rap
**2dina3dworld** (10): well then, what’s a tight rap?

**akanewasright** (10): idk what the loose rap is but I’m not sick of this yet

**bbfan132** (10): :glitterfloating:

**BeauMeringue212** (10): my favourite vocal production on the album, her runs, adlibs and vocal stacking are divine

**cremeebrulee** (10): this smash omg … it’s so smooth and catchy and would be my aaliyah 11 tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): nah honestly this is a ten as well lmao

**qazz23** (10): the hook on this is soooo good (11 candidate)

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Sounds like the OST for a late-game secret science lab level, which is one of the highest compliments I can give

**babadork** (9.7): Should have been a single

**bulforster** (9.1): impressively she manages to pull of a hater response track that actually sounds unbothered, it's very "i'm not angry, just disappointed"

**BaconShoes** (9): so slick

**frogaranaman** (9): a loose WHAT

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): "no telling what you could be / might even be doper than me, i doubt it" i doubt it too, girl

**runaway3212** (8.5): this was so bad but i kinda slayed randomly? I was shook

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i mean, I enjoyed it!

**flavasavavandal** (8): I know Timbaland’s verse on We Need a Resolution wasn’t that good but that doesn’t mean you had to make an entire song dedicated to dissing it

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is so repetitive that becomes quite annoying after a while

**plastichaxan** (8): We love raters making cameos omg

**Bordersz** (7.1): Static was a huge talent...and he really crafted Aaliyah's sound for the album and his demo's were spot on for Aaliyah's sound.

#unimpressed
**1998tweety** (7): a bit too repetitive

**indiefan** (7): I remember disliking this song almost as much as Extra Smooth, but it actually grew on me over time.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i feel like it could be more interesting than what it is

**TiltControls** (7): the verses are the real standout here

**throwaway-7650** (6): omg I didn't expect someone on ratcom to feature

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): has some nice sounds but is not exceptionally memorable

**Awkward\_King** (5): i think i wish this song went somewhere more, not that all songs need that but for me this would benefit from it, it feels stagnant

**MrSwearword** (5): Loose Rap sinks Hap? Loose Rap I call, I call CAP? The fuck are you talking about.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): As someone whose highest album average was Full Moon, I’m…really surprised to see this up high??? It does bop a bit but I personally dislike the production here. This sounds like Darkchild is just spamming his beats through and through that it nearly distracts from Brandy’s performance (which is like, the worst thing you can do on a Brandy song). The best part of the song is the slowdown transition to What About Us.

---

#yes we can
**cremeebrulee** (11): wow fuck!! this track is incredible. i haven’t seem that many people talk about it so idk how well it will do but i keep coming back to it. the end where it slows down … chef’s kiss

**2dina3dworld** (10): trueeeee

**Awkward\_King** (10): kappy rly made the right call with this brandy album in the end like this first futuristic r&b to a t

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the “no it’s true” meme’s anthem

**shipperondeck** (10): the transitions in this album are incredible

**throwaway-7650** (10): desperately need a missy elliott remix of this @MissyElliot I BEG

**BaconShoes** (9.5): i love the beat and of course the vocals are slaying

**bbfan132** (9): i love this production (i keep on saying this but it’s true)

**maxisgold** (9): Really the best songs on this album are the ones that sound like What About Us.

**plastichaxan** (9): we can

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): that watery laser-zap noise is almost metronomic and then you have her harmonizing all over the beat, it's marvelous

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this production sounds so cheap but idk i love it so much

**TiltControls** (8.5): Brandy knows how to bring the bops

**akanewasright** (8): Brandy vs Bahamadia battle of who gets to say “true” the most during their song idk this isn’t funny

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i don’t think we can

**runaway3212** (8): it's so sad brandy had to wait 6 years for her answer

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Pretty boppy (and by that I mean the background noises sound like they’re going “bop bop”)

**seanderlust** (7.8): the slowdown at the end is very cool

#no we can't 

**1998tweety** (7.5): me asking if i can stay home and play video games all day

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Good but unfortunately the first song on the album that isn’t a massive slay 😔

**IIIHenryIII** (7): not make this enter the top 30? (true)

**static\_int\_husp** (3.5): these beeps and boops are not a bop

**MrSwearword** (1): apparently, Brandy and Darkchild's favorite thing to do on a full moon is recycle the beat to What About Us three times before the actual fucking track comes up, iCannot.

**fadedblue09** (8): Most people said that this collab was unexpected, but honestly it makes a lot of sense: Kelis and Bjork are both eccentric cult musicians in their own right, and are seen with an outsider approach to their music. Also Medulla stans better savor this moment, as this is the closest it can get to a rate.

**nt96** (8): With Bjork's unrestrained, somersaulting vocals and Kelis's deep, husky vocals, you wouldn't think a collab would happen, much less even go well, but it did! The original tells the point of view from the ocean, while the remix tells the POV of the continents! Quite clever if you ask me!

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Ok but this is REALLY GOOD. Kelis put out some art pop albums please! Work with Arca wtf!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): I still can't believe this collab ever fucking happened.

**plastichaxan** (10): two queens maximizing their jointslay holy shit i need this on streaming neow!!

**shipperondeck** (10): sorry for autopiloting this score

**welcome2thejam** (10): Two great tastes that taste great together

**you2009** (9.5): bjork was definitely in the studio giving kelis riddles to solve before she had her lay down these vocals

**seanderlust** (9.2): this collaboration feels like picking two random artists out of a hat but it works so very well

**BaconShoes** (9): i hadn’t heard this version! This was really cool

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): it works just as well as you’d expect a björk and kelis collab would work. which is surprisingly well

**EnCaine** (8.5): this is a dream collab and i never even knew it existed omg

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): end bjorkphobia

**fairytalehigh** (8): kelis sounds really cool here but idk, bjork going full mother nature has always been pretty hit or miss for me, this is no different

**throwaway-7650** (8): soundtrack for the percy jackson revival series

**maxisgold** (7.5): A collab between two people I would have never seen collabing.

**indiefan** (7.2): I was really liking this until the point where their voices started to overlap.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): see everyone? Always carry your headphones with you, you might end up getting a collab

**vayyiqra** (3): I love Björk. I think she's a very interesting artist. But I've heard Medúlla a lot of times and this is one of my least favourite songs on it and this feature is so bizarre lol.

**nt96** (10): take notes SZA, that’s all I can say

**fadedblue09** (8): As for our final elimination, we lose the second of Aaliyah’s rock-influenced tracks, and this is easily the superior of the two tracks IMO, so I’m glad the majority agreed. Whereas What If sounds chaotic and aimless, this one showcases the experimental rock-ish production without unnecessarily drowning her vocals in the mix. Also I’d like to point out that this is our least controversial song in the rate, which I find funny considering the subject matter of the lyrics.

---

#I can love this song
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is like a prelude to What If and I just get amped

**indiefan** (10): Side Piece Anthem

**MrSwearword** (10): the ambition can be felt here, so I respect it for that the most.

**plastichaxan** (10): she said let me make a song with a beat so ahead of its time that is set back by its kinda dated lyrics

**seanderlust** (10): aaliyah pls i already have things keeping me up at night i need to SLEEP!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): now what is this doing near the bottom of the album in streams

**you2009** (10): checking the writing credits on these side chick anthems just to see only men...like yeah U would know huh?

**BaconShoes** (9): starts out a lil slow and then the slay arrives

**bbfan132** (9): this is trippy (although the lyrics are… interesting lol)

**qazz23** (9): love the guitar sound on this

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Remember infidelity is bad kids… unless if the song bops, of course

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): one of the coolest, darkest productions on an album replete with them. i love how she's already spent 2 songs dragging a dude for cheating, then slips effortlessly into the role of the other woman.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i really like this change up

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): love the rocky vibe

**TiltControls** (8.5): the production on this is fantastic

**shipperondeck** (8.4): THE GUITARSSSSSSSS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.2): should’ve been longer!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ok i see how influential this was

**EnCaine** (8): sometimes I think about the trent reznor x aaliyah collab we never got and collapse like a life alert commercial

**ImADudeDuh** (8): “SZA - The Weekend”’s mother

**celladonn** (7.5): Oh this is quite villainous, love the rock elements!

#I guess I can't 
**Stryxen** (7.5): she wants to be st vincent funkytown so bad

**1998tweety** (7): me when my team asks who can play support

**akanewasright** (7): man… Aaliyah doing the more out there rock styles was so good

**runaway3212** (7): the unknown sequel to Imma Be by the Black Eyed Peas

**BeauMeringue212** (6.8): Sidechick anthem

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Reminds me of “Wonder What She Thinks Of Me” by Chloe X Halle, except I like that song… I get what she’s going for (reflecting the mania and tragedy of this character with the music) but I don’t like the mixing and how this sounds. Points for ambition though.
