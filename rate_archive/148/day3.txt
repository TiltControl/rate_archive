**fadedblue09** (11): And we start off the final day by kicking off my 11! On first listen, this was one of the album standouts to me, and I think it perfectly encapsulates why Brandy is called the Vocal Bible. All the harmonies and vocal layers in this song are used to display the wide range of emotions one experiences during a crumbling relationship: denial, sadness and frustration. Other notable things about the song is Brandy‚Äôs sampling of her own song Angel in Disguise, as well as Michael Jackson‚Äôs background vocal presence. 

At first, I wondered whether I made the right 11 choice considering how little buzz this got. As the rate went on, it looks like I made the right choice as it almost never left Day 3, and was firmly in the 11-15 range. While it never quite broke into the top 10, I‚Äôd say this 11 choice was truly worth it.

**nt96**(7):It's Not Worth It: 7 I like the bleep bloop sounds in the beginning, other than that it's a pretty standard brandy song, which isn't neccesarily a bad thing. Despite this, I still kinda wished it switched spots with I Can Be....? Sorry not sorry

---

#worth the listen
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the vocal layering here is crazy. I have chills. Just everything about this song feels utterly classic

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the yas bomb detonates the second that a cappella intro starts‚Ä¶ tracks like this make me think about how weird it is that Brandy doesn‚Äôt often get mentioned as a contemporary of the teen pop sensations of the era (Britney/Xtina/Justin in particular) because they were all functionally making music that sounded like this and Brandy kinda blew them out of the water.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): michael Jackson background vocals in the intro, angel in disguise sample in the Outro, a bop throughout. The vocal layering is amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me trying (and failing) to convince myself that I should skip a rate with an album i have strong feelings for

**shipperondeck** (10): how many tinashe comments will we have in this rate i wonder

**throwaway-7650** (10): need ariana to cover this/like half the album immediately

**BaconShoes** (9): catchy af and the vocals layered together are so good omg

**bulforster** (9): this drum pattern is delicious

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): She was harmonizing with herself. Queen!

**TiltControls** (9): this song is though

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): one of the more forward-thinking productions on the album, it has almost a drum-n-bass vibe? it's skittish and weird in a way that fits the lyrics perfectly.

**1998tweety** (8.5): me when my fed jungler trades for the enemy support

**bbfan132** (8.5): i enjoyed this!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i mean bestie didnt you call it quits like four songs ago

**Stryxen** (8): CharliClub

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): loving the little clown horn honk in the back

#this ain't worth it

**frogaranaman** (7): Amen, praise be üôè God is good, 2 Corinthians 12:21

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): MICHAEL JACKSON??

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs very‚Ä¶ busy

**IIIHenryIII** (6.8): I don't like MJ, so this is me removing some points because of him

**runaway3212** (6.5): It's not worth the space on the album so true

**MrSwearword** (5): me with this album, it's not worth it, oh at all.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Very pleased that this made it to Day 3! This rock-tinged banger really displays not only Kelis‚Äô vocal range, but her ability to take on other genres as well. The subdued piano-driven prechorus is particularly a highlight for me. For a long time, this song was stuck in the 16-20 range and it took until the last-minute wave of ballots to finally push this into Day 3.

**nt96** (9.5): A jock jam? In MY Popheads server???? It's more likely than you think! It slays, it bops, it ate, it head rocks, hell, it headbutts and even spat in my face! Thank you Kelis.

---
#turn it up!
**akanewasright** (10): GOD YES GIVE ME MORE GUITARS

**bbfan132** (10): this still sounds modern as hell to me, i love the loud synth next to the guitars

**IIIHenryIII** (10): she missed the opportunity to go full on rock with that outro, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for it

**MrSwearword** (10): easily one of the most unique songs to a pop diva‚Äôs name. Guitar and a touch of rock is one of Kelis‚Äô greatest assets as very few black women in major label pop explores rock elements at all despite Tina Turner being the face of Rock and Roll.

**plastichaxan** (10): idk why Spotify has this as ‚ÄúKeep it Down Part II‚Äù but lemme read that as an 11 yass

**qazz23** (10): nice transitions between the softer and loud parts (11 candidate)

**Stryxen** (10): idk why this hit sm its probably an early out but i am living

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i wasnt expecting a fucking jock jam on this album what the hell

**throwaway-7650** (10): let me use this comment to complain about last.fm [infinity]

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): this did not have to snap so hard holy shit

**TiltControls** (9): Love the rock vibes on this one!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I‚Äôm a simple man, I hear rock, I rate high

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): tasty is by far the most adventurous genre wise from this rate lineup, and id say kelis is the most boundary pushing. like is this the best song ever no but it has only grown on me and is so fun and kelis is incredible

**celladonn** (8.5): No, turn it up!!!

**BaconShoes** (8): the production is fun

**Bordersz** (8): Catchy and I love the guitars on this.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): not the part II

**runaway3212** (8): this was bad but then it became post-good

**welcome2thejam** (8): God just a drop of rock is quenching my thirst right now

**1998tweety** (7.5): my dad when im playing video games at 1am

**MassiveThief** (7.5): oh she rockin!!!!!

#you're being too loud
**ImADudeDuh** (7): its interesting but that does not necessarily mean good

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This had such a story to the lyrics at the start I think it would have benefitted from a bridge/outro that brought it all together.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): who knew Kelis had a Pink moment

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): You gotta fight for your right to keep it downnnn

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): Sorry it just sounds like Kelis isn‚Äôt keeping up with the production here. She doesn‚Äôt even sound super committed here? The same girl who gave us Caught Out There and a Smells Like Teen Spirit cover? Just not feeling it here sorry.

**shipperondeck** (5.2): the only part of this song i like is the outro

**BeauMeringue212** (4): the verses are kinda ass tbh, it's giving Need for Speed instrumentals

**indiefan** (4): The pre chorus is the only part I like all the way through.

**oscarbrierley1** (4): this song is grating to me, its trying to do too much. It has some cool moments, but it doesn't work for me.

**fadedblue09** (10): I‚Äôm glad that this is the last standing Full Moon ballad because this is my favorite, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting most raters to agree with me? A lot of the Full Moon ballads can sometimes feel like leftovers from her earlier eras with standard cheesy love lyrics. However, this one feels as if it was specifically written for this album, having a more mature and sensual subject matter that reflected Brandy‚Äôs image transition at the time.

**nt96** (8): Balladphobia is defeated! I love the calmness and sensuality it conveys.

**Bordersz** (10): Ok, so she was singing like bills were due 6 SIX months ago.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is dream pop

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): One of the finest R&B ballads ever, those harmonies!

**flavasavavandal** (10): so hot

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is the kind of song only a QUEEN can make üëèüèΩ This era of r&b ballads will never be surpassed

**jay slay yas** (10): 11 contender

**runaway3212** (10): if balladphobia touches this...

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): it's a pleasant/textbook 90s R&B ballad moving on

**1998tweety** (9): i recoil

**BaconShoes** (9): her voice is incredible here wow

**seanderlust** (9): top tier, early 2000s, "lean your head against a rainy car window in the backseat of your mom's subaru forester while watching rain drops drag along the outside and choose two of them and decide they're in a race to get to the back side of the window and be mad when one of them curves towards the ground instead of going to where it was SUPPOSED TO GO!" track.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Strooong vocals

**shipperondeck** (8.7): she put her soul into this one damn

**bbfan132** (8.5): very 2002 but in a good way

**TiltControls** (8.5): hope balladphobia doesn't strike this one, cause it's gorgeous

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): the production is a bit dated and the lyrics aren't exactly surprising (especially coming off the last 2 tracks) but brandy's vocals elevate everything on this album, this is no different

**CrimsonROSET** (8): bonk

**Stryxen** (8): awesome it feels so short because it's so good!

**EnCaine** (7.5): good demonstration of the superb vocal work on this album

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): her vocals give me goosebumps

#touch me not

**MrSwearword** (7): the deliciously corny&B that I usually associate Brandy with.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds pretty but also I think I‚Äôve heard a million songs that sound exactly like this

**genIVsupremacy** (6.7): vocals come thru!!

**Awkward\_King** (5): this is pretty and all but i miss the ass shakers already

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): she‚Äôs serving vocals but unfortunately the rest of the song kinda sucks

**fadedblue09** (10): By far one of the most commercially successful songs in the rate, and arguably Kelis‚Äô signature song, we have the Neptunes-produced and Grammy-nominated Milkshake. This catchy, suggestive banger has Kelis proudly declare her ‚Äúmilkshake‚Äù as a quality that makes her irresistible among men. It was never clear what a milkshake was, but no one cares because it bops. Personally, I‚Äôd like to think of this song as sitting in the same table as A Thousand Miles/Call Me Maybe, all 3 being novelty pop tunes with absurd but catchy lyrics that defy logic. Songs like this are easy to dismiss, but these songs IMO capture the essence of pop music: you let the music speak, or rather bop, for itself without the need to elaborate why. 

This song had quite the ride. For most of the rate this was a Day 2 song and at some point, it nearly sank to Day 1, and I almost wanted to quit hosting because the tastelessness was too much to handle. The last-minute wave of ballots pretty much saved this song and gave it the Day 3 placement it deserves (and honestly, it deserves higher but whatever). Hopefully, in some parallel universe with more taste and less contrarians, this track got the victory it deserves. 

**nt96** (10): Y'all are just a bunch of no good haterade guzzling, lactose intolerant bitches. This is the paragon of camp and idgaf what anyone has to say otherwise. The beat is filthy, the double entendre lyrics, it's iconic! Why is she saying warm it up when milkshakes are served cold? Idk but I'm living for it! Long live Milkshake!! Shame on you Popheads, no desserts for you. ELECTRIC CHAIR.

**DirtyRat583** (11): i mean its iconic and its a fantastic song too i have no choice but to 11

**EnCaine** (11): My favorite thing about this track, besides being one of the greatest hit songs of all time, is how seriously Kelis sells it. She could have delivered this like it was a joke or really camped it up, but instead I fully believe that Kelis is bringing all the boys to the yard when I listen to this and that makes Milkshake serve as hard as it does. Kelis is so fucking cool

**vayyiqra** (11): A masterpiece, a legend, a meme, iconic, gamechanger, a Neptunes banger, the peak of "nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative",

#people with taste
**1998tweety** (10): miltank's anthem

**BaconShoes** (10): i used to be obsessed with this song omg. So great for shaking ass. The beat is infectious

**bbfan132** (10): absolute classic

**Bordersz** (10): A pop classic.

**celladonn** (10): That DING is one of the most satisfying sounds in any song

**cremeebrulee** (10): this slaps idc its not my rate villain

**CrimsonROSET** (10): iconic idc

**fairytalehigh** (10): everything in this song is fine-tuned to bang hard as fuck, and still does 20 years later, from the nasty bassline to the crystal-clear chimes to kelis' "la la, la la, LA" hook. this song has been so relentlessly deployed to comic effect in media that it was easy for me to forget just how seriously good it is. i queued it up in my car and was just blown away.

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): A classic no matter how overplayed it might be!

**frogaranaman** (10): SEXUAL HEALTH AWARENESS - it should not be like a milkshake

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I still don't understand what the metaphor for milkshake is

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Undebatably one of the most fun songs from that time

**plastichaxan** (10): this deserves top 10 y'all better appreciate camp

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the classic that i think we all hope doesn't actually win

**runaway3212** (10): deserves top 2 thank you

**seanderlust** (10): god i wanted to give this a hot-take low rating. if you just look at it on paper, it's not a great song and if it catches me in the wrong mood, it can grate. in the right mood or neutral mode though? it's a brain off banger, an absolutely incomparable earworm, WAP with business savvy. la-la-la-la-la, the boys are waiting.

**throwaway-7650** (10): MY MILKSHAKE BRINGS ALL THE BOYS TO THE FARM AND THEY'RE LIKE, IT'S BETTER THAN YOURS, DAMN RIGHT, IT'S BETTER T-

**babadork** (9.8): We weren‚Äôt allowed to buy this album, because my aunt thought this song was ‚Äúannoying.‚Äù I might be a little bitter about it still.

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): Is it bad that I can't hear this without feeling like I'm pulling up to Regina George's house?

**daretheghost** (9): While lurking the rates channel in Discord I noticed quite a few of you are giving this your 0 and I will not stand for that.

**Stryxen** (9): yeah it‚Äôs just a lot of fun i love <3

**TiltControls** (9): an overhated classic

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): The Neptunes ate this production and this is iconic, but Kelis voice could be better at parts here

**akanewasright** (8.5): this would be a horrendous winner, like‚Ä¶ there are potential winners in this rate that would make everyone celebrate, even the people who were rooting against it earlier could begrudgingly acknowledge that it deserved, and this would just have people going üßç. However, I can‚Äôt make it not bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): kinda overrated outside of the iconic title phrase

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): I can see why this is the biggest hit in the rate and it'll probably win, but it just doesn't hit as hard as other songs for me.

**2dina3dworld** (8): daisybop

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is still brilliantly camp and timeless

**MrSwearword** (8): Kelis‚Äô biggest hit in the U.S. and lead single for the album. Sure, its mythos of ‚ÄúAwesomely Bad‚Äù on VH1, Making the Band routine montage, immortal stripper anthem status is impressive. I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again; there are better Kelis songs in existence but hey‚Ä¶

**qazz23** (8): c'mon this is fun

**static\_int\_husp** (8): quick question. Why are we warming up milkshakes?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): My favorite memory of this song is when my friend was watching Ugly Betty for the first time and she got to [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BxmtZoF5sk) she just texted me ‚ÄúMILKSHAKE???????‚Äù

#lactose intolerant
**jay slay yas** (6): i dont think ive ever heard this bridge omg... unpleasantly surprised i fear

**welcome2thejam** (6): Color me shocked if Milkshake doesn't bring the highest controversy score to the yard

**sarcasticsobs** (5.6): never got into this tune

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Spilled your milkshake? Quick, the Quicker Picker Upper¬©! Bounty¬© picks up spills quicker, and each sheet is two times more absorbent, so you can use less than the leading ordinary brand‚Ä¶ So you can get back to your milkshake!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): wow, the parts of this song that aren't the chorus are pretty weak. the boys deserve better than this

**bulforster** (3.5): this crawled so juice could fly

**MassiveThief** (3.5): it's good for the meme but tbh never actually enjoyed this song

**shipperondeck** (3): so how do i know this song so well but it doesnt sound like this in my head

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i never liked this song and quite honestly its even worse in context with the rest of the album considering how much better the rest of it is

**flavasavavandal** (1.5): embarrassing

**apatel27** (0): This beat actively annoys me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): Yes, surprise surprise (but not really). Hear me out: I was a pre-teen when all this music came out and I have a lot of nostalgia for this era. I‚Äôve revisited a TON of music from this era. There are 2 songs I don‚Äôt revisit, and it‚Äôs Thong Song and Milkshake. I at least am cool with Thong Song and think it‚Äôs funny. This is just grating and annoying. Believe me, I‚Äôm a Kelis fan and she has a TON of better songs than Milkshake. The song doesn‚Äôt let up so if you dislike it, it really suffocates you.

**indiefan** (0): Sorry, I always hated this song and I still do to this day. And even then, I do not remember this song being THIS bad back then‚Ä¶

**thedoctordances1940** (0): genuinely just ridiculously annoying

MrSwearword: > It was never clear what a milkshake was, but no one cares because it bops.

"Milkshake" was one of those songs where the artist said it was about inner sex appeal, but the *public* said, "nah it's about puss puss"

**fadedblue09** (7): Narrowly missing the top 10 is I Care 4 U, a slow-burn R&B jam with writing credits from Missy Elliott. Initially, it was a non-single track, but got the single treatment when it was included on the posthumous compilation of the same name. While I find it serviceable, I don‚Äôt see it to be that different compared to the other slow jams on the album.

**nt96** (9.5): The loneliness, the subtle beatboxing and that final note! Ugh fuck me up why don't youüò©I'll say it again; Balladphobia was defeated! Even if it barely missed the top 10, it still made it to day 3! Can your faves say the same?
¬†

#everything 4 u
**frogaranaman** (11): a perfect song. can't wait to see this get a 10+ average!

**1998tweety** (10): this is incredible oml

**akanewasright** (10): Aaliyah‚Äôs vocals + Missy‚Äôs pen = magic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I love the dramatic throwback soul of this song but also this stretch of the album makes me think of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDKxXVKm0mw

**jay slay yas** (10): 11 contender

**MrSwearword** (10): nothing this smooth should be impactful, but here I am, sans wig.

**seanderlust** (10): this beat gives me those ASMR tingles - especially the sixteenth notes made by beatboxing. timbaland and missy did not miss with this beat

**throwaway-7650** (10): my original 11, hope it can pick up at least one in a sea of them

**apatel27** (9.5): is that an beatbox

**bbfan132** (9.5): i love the beatboxing in the background that basically makes up the beat (along with aaliyah‚Äôs beautiful voice)

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): this song is just... ruthlessly sexy.

**BaconShoes** (9): such a vibe

**BeauMeringue212** (9): if ü•∫ were a song

**Bordersz** (8.9): I love the beatboxing in the back...her light airy voice. It is very angelic and intimate.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Aaliyah's vocal performance here is stellar

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): normally I‚Äôm slow song phobic on first listen but she truly sells it here and sounds so good

**2dina3dworld** (8): this song is super sentimental, and I love it but it does feel like it drags on at times because I have a short attention span. Also the weird lip flapping sound in the background at times kinda distracts me

**celladonn** (8): Lovely sensual ballad

**IIIHenryIII** (8): pretty good

**babadork** (7.7): ‚Äú(Too Little in Common to Be Lovers) Too Much Going to Say Goodbye‚Äù is also a great song.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): shout out the compilation album

#i dont care 4 this
**CrimsonROSET** (7): I do like ballads, I swear.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): the juxtaposition between this track and the previous one is sending me, there‚Äôs no in between with Aaliyah this chick is either ride or she is die

**ImADudeDuh** (7): wow she can really harmonize with herself! Thats chemistry

**Stryxen** (7): she sounds a lil bit nasally at one point but i have a blocked nose rn so its relatable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i would like this more without the irritating mouth noises that go on throughout the whole song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I‚ÄôLL CUM üò© I‚ÄôLL CUM üò©

**welcome2thejam** (7): They turned that volume allllll the way up for that one lyric huh

**bulforster** (4.4): the beatboxing is really distracting for some reason

**runaway3212** (4): I don't care four here

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this is one of those songs that i think serves good purpose in the album and exists with reason but i just do not care for or would ever visit on its own

**fadedblue09** (9.5): First to be kicked off the top ten is Millionaire, Kelis‚Äô collaboration with Andre 3000. On first listen, I was a bit lukewarm on Andre‚Äôs verse as I felt it he dominated too much of the song, but I eventually warmed up to it. The beats here are also really addictive to listen and Kelis‚Äô delivers a strangely poignant performance despite the upbeat nature of the song.

 This song was struggling to get into the top 10 for a while, and it eventually pulled through as this got higher scores and I Care 4 U got low scores.

**nt96** (9): Upon my first listen, I wasn't really feeling this song, but overtime it grew on me. I love the funk influences, the 808s, and 3000's verse is as smooth and effortless as ever. I love how the fluttering piano in the background complements the lonely lyrics, feels like you're watching the sunset while everyone around you is frolicking, everyone but you of course. I'm happy to see this make it to the top 10!

#i wanna be a millionaire
**Awkward\_King** (11): idk man its just a fucking banger. like the production is insane, its so fucking fun and the little twinkles are glorious, kelis' vocals are ethereal and andre's verses are so fun, i might have to 11 this again if it gets sent to AS after inevitably losing this

**RandomHypnotica** (11): holy fucking shit?!?!?!?

**welcome2thejam** (11): Incredible pairing. Andre 3000 shines bright as usual, great driving beat, Kelis sounds fantastic on her parts, love this

**apatel27** (10): This is just an Andre 3000 song

**bbfan132** (10): i‚Äôve loved this for a while and i still love it!

**EnCaine** (10): Where there's a rate, Kelis ate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I just love this song so much

**qazz23** (10): love the drums and synth bits (11 candidate)

**seanderlust** (10): YASS ANDRE 3000!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): need the tinashe and lil nas X cover ASAP

**you2009** (10): lenin hasn't had much to say since kelis sang "I ain't rich til he is rich til she is rich then we is rich"

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): idk what andre is on about but this is such a banger

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this sounds like a movie song (compliment)

**runaway3212** (9): this is really good wait

**shipperondeck** (9): typical andre 3000 slay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): now if this doesn‚Äôt make top 10‚Ä¶

**Bordersz** (8.8): The melodies on this are so smooth. Production is god-tier. Andre sounds great on here.

**bulforster** (8.8): now why would there be a song about the rich on an album with a food concept... unless üò≥

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): "where there is cheese, there are rats / wherever there are rats, there are cats / wherever there are cats, there are dogs / if you got the dogs, you got bitches" so true bestie!

**Stryxen** (8.7): WHEREVER THERE ARE CATS THERE ARE DOGS

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): Yeah this is luxurious as shit, I‚Äôm vibing

**TiltControls** (8.5): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/Drevil_million_dollars.jpg/220px-Drevil_million_dollars.jpg

**babadork** (8.4): Middle school me was a little disappointed by this when it came out, but I think I was being way too picky.

**akanewasright** (8): we love Andre 3000

**MassiveThief** (8): Andre ate

**plastichaxan** (8): can't relate at all but good for them

**indiefan** (7.8): From this point forward is where the album starts to pick up, imo.

#eat the rich

**1998tweety** (7.5): rosalia ended

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): idk why but i think andre woke up early this morning

**BaconShoes** (7.5): the andre part was a fun moment

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it kinda bops, but it's just a worse version of the Hey Ya beat. To me her voice doesn't fit with the song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Decent beat but the repetition doesn‚Äôt do it for me, like it‚Äôs a nice idea but they grind it into dust.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Incredibly disappointed by this‚Ä¶ I saw ‚ÄúAndr√© 3000‚Äù and expected a bop but this just feels like they both phoned it in‚Ä¶

**flavasavavandal** (3): you would think I‚Äôm tanking this because of its lyrics but I‚Äôm actually tanking this because this is the worst thing Andr√© 3000 has ever done

**MrSwearword** (1): The third single from the album and all I have to say is‚Ä¶really? It‚Äôs not the first collaboration between Kelis and Andre but this one proves that it doesn‚Äôt work at all. There‚Äôs such a clash between the levels of funk/weirdness between the two of them. It‚Äôs actually quite unpleasant mixed in with the twinkly beat.

**fadedblue09** (10): And so Kelis is the first to be fully eliminated from the rate, with her last song standing being the reggae-flavored Trick Me. It‚Äôs a sassy kiss-off bop that really displays her talent, from the catchy chorus to the rap-driven second verse, which is a particular highlight. It may not have the notoriety of Milkshake, but it had its mild success in some European countries and even had an appearance in Saints Row 2. 

This has always been Kelis‚Äô highest rated song throughout the whole rate, and it held on to the top 10 even as if the rest of Tasty was bombing hard. At some point though, it was close to getting kicked out of the top 10 and given that this was one of my favorite tracks in the rate, I seriously considered switching my 11 to this as I did not want to be the host of the rate with the Earliest Exit in a 3-album rate (and Kelis certainly does not deserve that!). Thank god it didn‚Äôt end up happening, even if I think this track deserved a higher placement than this.\

**nt96** (10): And just like that, Kelis is out, along with everyone's taste. Despite the bad taste the Intro left in everyones mouth, Trick Me manages to clean it off with a little jazziness. The rap section was a nice touch and added some dynamicity to the song.

#might trick me once
**celladonn** (11): Oh my god what an incredible song, absolutely timeless

**TiltControls** (11): I feel like this gets overshadowed by Milkshake, but Kelis has got such a good groove here it's hard not to give it the 11

**babadork** (10): That Mellotron sample sounds so cool.

**BaconShoes** (10): such a bop. Catchy af and the beat slaps

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I was too poor to have an iPod as a kid, and this was one of the songs kid me used to love on my little portable radio back in the day lmao

**DirtyRat583** (10): omfg bitch THIS IS A SERVEEE

**EnCaine** (10): Maybe I'm delusional but this definitely would have popped off in the U.S. if her label hadn't imploded mid-album cycle

**fairytalehigh** (10): tasty comes sprinting out the gate with 2 absolute bangers, "trick me" being the first. whether it's that silky chorus, or that knocking beat, or the "woah oh oh" loop, this thing just goes and goes and goes.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me on april‚Äôs fools day

**MrSwearword** (10): The second single released, exceptionally made and should‚Äôve been a bigger hit. Goddamn Arista records going bankrupt right when this was released.

**qazz23** (10): the beat on this is killer (11 candidate)

**throwaway-7650** (10): will probably outplace milkshake and I can't even get mad really

**akanewasright** (9.5): why does this feel like it could have a resurgence on TikTok?

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): this song works so well for her voice, the beat is so bouncy. I can only think of Cheryl aggressively singing this on a girls aloud tour when I hear this song.

**Awkward\_King** (9): this is such a good british oughties pop song, like this production could easily be lily allen

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the CLUB REMIX?! Not the tags

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is better than milkshake ngl

**MassiveThief** (9): just immediately infectious. what a banger.

**maxisgold** (9): I love mad women anthems.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Not to say the other albums were boring or bad, but this sound is a breath of fresh air after those two

**shipperondeck** (8.6): after the other 2 albums this sound surprised me

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is a fun single

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): fun

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): its just such a perfect summer jam

**1998tweety** (8): me when i ask for candy on halloween

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): An album highlight, fun little electro-swing type sample

**frogaranaman** (8): that sample literally just made me think about that one Tiktok trend where people just jumped down like six flights of stairs for fun

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): So bouncy!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Love the more reggae sounding baseline to this but it‚Äôs kinda a weird choice for an opener? I would have preferred it if ‚ÄúMilkshake‚Äù were the first real song and then this came later because the more club oriented sound doesn‚Äôt get me pumped out the gate.

#wont let you trick me twice
**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): it's cute

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): very interesting hypothetical to imagine how this would have done (and how her career may have played out) if the label didn‚Äôt shut down at the wrong time & keep this from getting a U.S. single release

**cremeebrulee** (5.8): the audacity of her saying she‚Äôs gonna give me something good and then going into this boring ass song

**bulforster** (5.2): the rap section saves this from completely wearing out its welcome

**runaway3212** (4): the way I was bored after a minute

**Stryxen** (2): this kinda did nothing for me i was so bored and i can't place what it reminds me of but the beat annoys me‚Ä¶. Forcing myself not to 0 in case I regret it

# Tasty

---

**Overall Average**: 7.475 **// Average Controversy:** 1.874

---

nt96: Album: Tasty: 8.43 Yall reallly had a lot to say about this album didn't you? Despite its early leave, its not so much cuz of its lack of quality but rather a testement to just how strong her competitors were. Sadly Tasty couldn't hold a candle but despite this, the album was very fun for me and I truly appreciate just how adventurous it feels, being unafraid to take on different genres each time, another testament to how Kelis refused to be put in a box. This one's for Kelis!

fadedblue09: Miss Kelis may have called her album Tasty and yet she was served with tastelessness by the people of r/popheads. I honestly don‚Äôt get why y‚Äôall thought this album was way behind the other two, but I digress. Maybe she simply was way too ahead of her time, even with this lineup.

**skargardin** (8.857): This is such a fun album, I love how varied it is sonically. The Neptunes' produced tracks have to be my standouts though.

**fairytalehigh** (8.707): why yes, this album IS tasty.

**welcome2thejam** (8.571): Of the three, this is the one I'm most likely to revisit. Lively, fun production and presence that's very much in my wheelhouse and fills with me with joy.

**EnCaine** (8.400): I love Kelis so much - she's one of the dopest people in music ever. She deserved so much better and her first three albums hold a huge place in my heart (and there's also a lot to like about her later work). The first half of this record is definitely superior to the second but there's not a single bad track here

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.286): Pharrell is one nasty rat for how he treated Kelis but this album is so good

**qazz23** (8.214): I liked this overall, some nice beats and basslines, it's so much more than Milkshake

**BeauMeringue212** (7.771): This album was a great surprise, the electro-funk production and downright horniness made this such a fun listen

**indiefan** (6.871): Definitely has some strong tracks, but it takes a while for it to get to that point for me.

**throwaway-7650** (6.857): this really grew off me on my last relisten... I'm so sorry kelis

**IIIHenryIII** (6.786): What a fun experience was listening to this. I was skeptical at the beginning because I didn't use to take her seriously. I mean, milkshake is such a meme song. Anyway, I'm surprised by how good this is.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.593): Yeah I can't say I loved this album, did pick up a bit in the second half but alot of it was just fine/decent and didn't really blow me away

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.364): kelis sweetie im so sorry that of any song in your discography milkshake was the one you became famous for you deserve so much better than that

**bulforster** (6.350): Lots of cute songs on here but I was only really blown away a couple times.

**2dina3dworld** (6.229): I now know way too much about Kelis‚Äôs‚Ä¶ preferences

**cremeebrulee** (6.136): wow this album was lowkey a drag to get through. between the meandering songs and uninteresting lyrics, this feels like such a downgrade compared to the other two albums üò≠ sorry

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.929): If you told me last year that I would be rating albums by Aaliyah and Brandy, and that my favorite would be the one by the fucking Milkshake girl, I‚Äôm not sure how much you would have to pay me to believe that, but here we are. How do I explain this‚Ä¶ okay. If this were an Emo Rate, Kelis is my Fall Out Boy. I know this isn‚Äôt exactly the objective best album in this rate in regards to lyricism or music (and certainly not in my average album scores lol), but it‚Äôs the one that appeals to me the most, okay? It‚Äôs fun! It‚Äôs wild! And Kelis establishes herself as a singer able to express emotion and personality beyond ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fuck‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad we can‚Äôt fuck‚Äù (I, uh, can‚Äôt exactly say the same for the other two‚Ä¶)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.929): I prefer the ingenuity of Kelis‚Äô first two albums, with great cuts like Caught Out There, Young Fresh n New, Popular Thug, etc. To me, the freshness from her first two albums get a little stale here. I love love love a lot of campy, novelty music, but some cuts here veer on grating. Other times Kelis vocals don‚Äôt really stand up for me for the slower more soul-tinged songs. Quite a few songs I love, I think when Kelis keeps the producing and vocal phrasing light and carefree is when she shines.

**MassiveThief** (5.500): Pretty consistently good! Trick Me is the only song I'll probably keep listening to and there are a few not-so-good songs for sure, but I liked it overall!

**flavasavavandal** (5.357): sorry Kelis, I‚Äôm sure your other work has more to give but this gave me barely anything

MrSwearword: For all the ungodly treatment this album got, Kelis did make another Top 10 appearance in her rate herstory, so that's a small victory.

**fadedblue09** (7): We now lose all of the non-singles from Aaliyah as we now see the departure of I Refuse. While I respect the appeal of the song, I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs my cup of tea when it comes to ballads. As I said with comment for Love Wouldn‚Äôt Count Me Out, I prefer ballads that take a simpler and less dramatic approach. This one, while being technically good, feels like one of those songs that only work in the context of a scene.

**nt96** (8): The drama of it all! If It's Whatever was the spring flowers blooming, I Refuse is that raging storm that comes before it. Everything about this song screams assertion, taking back your life and love that you tried so hard to give in exchange for your spouse to pay it back but to no avail.

# i accept
**1998tweety** (11): me when someone gives me pizza with pepperoni on it

**fairytalehigh** (11): in the middle of burial's 2007 electronic masterpiece untrue, there's a brief, gorgeous ambient interlude called "in mcdonalds." it's only 2 minutes long. it glows faintly and warmly, with a dapple of keys, and then the silence is cut with a single, heartbreaking line: "once upon a time, it was you i adored." i've been haunted by that sample ever since i heard it. even knowing it was aaliyah, nothing could prepare me for finally hearing the lyric in the wild. "i refuse" is a whirlwind of hurt, exhaustion, and defiance. that chorus is a thing of wonder, stacked carefully with tight rhymes and cutting details: "i refuse to continue to ignore / the fact i fell to the floor the day you walked out my door," like DAMN. there are a lot of amazing songs on this album--and in this rate, period--but i knew there was only one song i could give my 11 to.

**flavasavavandal** (11): I just kinda love how dramatic and epic this song ends up sounding

**throwaway-7650** (11): it's crazy how each minute of this is better than the one before it

**akanewasright** (10): The fucking DRAMA like yes fulfill all my theater kid dreams

**apatel27** (10): Everything about this track is perfect

**bbfan132** (10): i love how epic this is, i feel like it could be a solo in a play

**bulforster** (10): the DRAMA

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is better than 75% of musicals

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): I love me a melodramatic ballad but this one is in a league of it‚Äôs own. When those strings just come crashing in during the bridge‚Ä¶ goosebumps.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is one of the best "fuck you, I'm over it" songs ever. GOD I love her

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): My favorite song on the album, love the high drama! Feels like something from a musical almost, or like it‚Äôs supposed to be playing at the dramatic climax of the film. She literally included rain sounds on the track because a song this powerful is MEANT to be listened to in the pouring rain.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): what the fuck is this? Holy shit, I'm so mad I never heard this before

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait a minute wait wait omg she made sure that the spotlight was directly on her while singing this wow

**jay slay yas** (10): another 11 contender

**plastichaxan** (10): tell him girl!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): that ending... :poohascending:

**Stryxen** (10): woah em gee‚Ä¶. Stunning

**welcome2thejam** (10): Ooh, a nice fusion with like a rock ballad, the cool R&B production throughout, even some orchestral flourishes. Very, very interesting track

**you2009** (10): the bridge on this she outsold mimar sinan or whatever it is gay people say

**oscarbrierley1** (9.7): this song is so atmospheric, it's like shes standing on the edge of a cliff on a stormy night singing it. The length will probably work against it in the rate

**BaconShoes** (9.5): i like to go ‚Äúand i refuuuse‚Äù when it is appropriate to the situation but i don‚Äôt think people ever understand what i‚Äôm referencing üò≠ NOOO WAY I CAN‚ÄôT TAKE IT BABY

**seanderlust** (9.3): this instrumental is maybe my favorite on the album. the arpeggiated piano line, the subtle electric guitar, and the early 2000s timbaland beat?? mwah

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the weird sparkle sfx ruins it, everything else is gorgeous

**DirtyRat583** (9): this one is so beautiful

**qazz23** (9): those strings!

**runaway3212** (9): this is so beautifull I cannot refuse her

**sarcasticsobs** (9): you go, girl

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.9): see i feel like i SHOULD like this‚Ä¶like it has everything going for it that i normally like in a track‚Ä¶but theres something about it thats holding it back from being amazing and i can‚Äôt place my finger on what

**BeauMeringue212** (8.7): Me when asked to do something at work

**celladonn** (8.5): This is really cool and dramatic and has a great build

**shipperondeck** (8.5): imagining myself as a heartbroken young woman falling to my knees as my home is swept away around me (there is a tornado warning)

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the drama this has

**MassiveThief** (8): outro slays

**MrSwearword** (8): slightly too simple for an album with rich textures, but I can appreciate it for what Aaliyah's vocals were doing here.

**TiltControls** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJioIxpoSbk

#I refuse
**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I think I like it but vocally I feel like she‚Äôs not giving as much as the dramatic instrumentation calls for

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): love the drama but this is unnecessarily long

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJZCpKdW0AMtG-v.jpg

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i dont know how i feel about this, i admire it but idk if i enjoy it

**fadedblue09** (10): We are now slowly moving down to the wire as we lose one of the huge singles from Aaliyah. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised this is the song y‚Äôall chose to eliminate first. It was one of the immediate standouts of the album for me, with its Middle Eastern trip-hoppy beat being instantly memorable. I guess we just really hate men (or at least Timbaland) so much.

**nt96** (10): What. An. Opener! And what a way to start the rate as well! This is really unlike anything I've heard before back in the 00s and there's still isn't anything that compares to this. It's sensual, hypnotic and overall mystical. Don't even get me started on that music video!

#resolved

**maxisgold** (11): You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with, you know what I mean, anybody. Children were singing the song at graduations, at weddings, at funerals.

**babadork** (10): Timberland‚Äôs rap is simultaneously one of his best and completely unnecessary.

**BaconShoes** (10): AM I SUPPOSED TO CHANGE?? I love the lyrics and this is such a great opener

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the album starts and I‚Äôm already wigless

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I will try to listen to other genre other than Taylor Swift

**jay slay yas** (10): it gave

**MrSwearword** (10): Aaliyah's best song, argue with the wall. The beatwork is legendtinta especially with that one sample breakdown video that came out recently.

**plastichaxan** (10): I was so scared when I saw a m*n was featured and would ruin the song at one point but I'm glad he knew his place

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): putting this as the first song of the rate isnt fair how is anything else possibly going to top this

**shipperondeck** (9.8): so damn catchy

**bbfan132** (9.5): i don‚Äôt fully adore this, but it is still ahead of its time and really good in general

**celladonn** (9): Great production

**CrimsonROSET** (9): do you guys think they need a resolution

**seanderlust** (9): bye not timbaland literally asking the girl if she's on her period

**throwaway-7650** (9): I'M SO FREAKY FREAKY FISHY I'M

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): "am i supposed to change, are you supposed to change / yeah, who should be hurt, who should be blamed?" what a way to start an album!

**apatel27** (8.5): Gotta love a trippy beat

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): they both ate and left me hungry for more

**TiltControls** (8.5): an amazing opener

**Awkward\_King** (8): me making a story mountain for something im writing but relaising im missing something to end the conflict

**frogaranaman** (8): I don't think Aaliyah is to be blamed here

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Production on this one is strange but it really unfurls the more you listen to it

**MassiveThief** (8): sultry type beat

**oscarbrierley1** (8): it's so cool that timbaland had to chop up the horn(?) sample to make the correct time signature. It's such a random detail but it really gives the song a unique vibe

**welcome2thejam** (8): Going full relationship reddit and immediately saying they should break up

#no resolution

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): ‚Äúyou got issues i got issues‚Äù my ideal relationship

**runaway3212** (7.5): not trying to have more men hate but I really hate timabland's verse

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs okay, but maybe a bit lackluster as an opener

**flavasavavandal** (5): god timbaland did not even remotely put any effort into trying to come across as convincing in his attempts at gaslighting, gatekeeping and girlbossing

**bulforster** (3.9): I don't really like how disjointed her vocal lines are, they also need resolution.

**fadedblue09** (10): Our last song to miss the Top 5 is Full Moon‚Äôs lead single What About Us. This song is very much the quintessential song of the producer-singer tandem of Brandy and Darkchild, with those instantly recognizable electrofunk beats and Brandy‚Äôs vocal layerings. This song also kickstarted a mature era for the singer, which would continue into the rest of the Full Moon album.  

How far this song has fallen. During the early weeks of the rate, this was in the top 2 and occasionally touched the top spot for a few times. At some point, this was winning the rate with a 9.5 average with no 11s. The last few days of the rate brought out the haters from the woodwork, causing it to sink below the top 5 

**nt96** (9): Step aside yall, Brandy is mad as hell! Darkchild spared NO punches with this beat neither did Brandy spare anyone with her voice! The one thing that prevented me from giving this a 10 is how slightly uneven the beat felt to me. This is especially since I Thought came before this track and did it slightly better imo
 
---

**akanewasright** (10): LET BRANDY SAY SHIT, SHE‚ÄôS EARNED A FEW CURSE WORDS

**apatel27** (10): overwhelming in the best way

**BaconShoes** (10): throwing ass brb

**bbfan132** (10): this is already so cool production-wise, and her voice makes it 100x better

**BeauMeringue212** (10): beat goes hard on this, the glitchy production is so cool

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i mean duh

**daretheghost** (10): If you heard Darkchild‚Äôs tag in the early 2000s you knew the song was about to go off.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is a total sultry BANGER. The beat and Brandy‚Äôs clipped phrasing here is just straight fire. One of the best beats and production ever in electro-R&B. And then the synth vamping during the chorus adds to the dizzying and amazing chorus. And the whole song being a kiss-off to this ain‚Äôt shit dude? Get his ass, Brandy!

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): The way Brandy starts harmonising with the wonky synths at the end she was INSANE for that!

**frogaranaman** (10): men suck

**maxisgold** (10): She came into this bitch mad as hell!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): Brandy's shining jewel on this album. It is wonderfully crafted music.

**qazz23** (10): love the alternating vocals in this

**seanderlust** (10): the only valid whataboutism tbh

**throwaway-7650** (10): not the spotify lyrics being "uh, uh [?]" they said ÎàÑÍµ¨ÏÑ∏Ïöî

**welcome2thejam** (10): Next up to bat in the giant Hadron collider, Brandy!

**TiltControls** (9.5): Brandy bringing the bops AGAIN!

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): whataboutism found dead in a ditch

**1998tweety** (9): ended pink

**EnCaine** (9): this shit is still bonkers on the 100th listen

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): YEAH WHAT THE *FUCK* ABOUT ALL OF THE- she‚Äôs got me ready to fight my man and he doesn‚Äôt even exist

**Bordersz** (8.6): Classic Brandy signature sound.

**celladonn** (8.5): Truly iconic early 00s CGI music video

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): what about love? what about us? (beat drop‚Ä¶ wrong song, my bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): finally some good fucking music

**Stryxen** (8): a 7 + 1 for the outro

#whataboutism

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): this is like the only electonic song on the album that's emotely good

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): ended p!nk

**ImADudeDuh** (7): only a 7/10 and it still stomps out the p!nk song

**runaway3212** (6): p!nk could never

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I feel like the instrumentation is too disjointed to properly get into any sort of groove

**fadedblue09** (10): Originally slated to be a Red Album cut, it was rejected and remained unreleased until its inclusion in her posthumous compilation. Upon its official release, it became a moderate hit and its emotional tribute MV, won the Best r&B Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The bonus rate was basically a 2-way race between this and Finest Dreams, but it narrowly lost in the end.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.5): she sings lovely on this but the beat is giving organic coffee shop

**fadedblue09** (10): And our winner! Would you believe I had no idea this song existed before the rate? At first, it was a struggle to find material for Kelis in the bonus rate and discovering this felt like, unearthing a forgotten treasure. I have a soft spot for songs that give off a nostalgic vibe even at first listen.

**fadedblue09** (10): The second single off her self titled, More than a Woman is a catchy R&B bop, with elements of modern and classic R&B instrumentation. It is perhaps one of the catchiest moments on The Red Album, and Aaliyah‚Äôs delivery is just so flawless. Similarly flawless is the choreography, and its MV is perhaps my favorite among the ones in this era 

This song was the runner-up at some points, but it never really got the chance to take the winning position, which might be a surprise to some.

**nt96** (10): It's the smasha!!! Continuing the arabic vibe, it manages to eclipse the opening track with the added trumpets and a hard thumping beat. This is also where Aaliyah sings in her lower register, giving her and this song a greater sense of maturity. And that video, featuring celebrities like Mark Ronson, Kadida Jones and even a young Rashida Jones. And that Gucci catsuit Aaliyah's rockin? Yes please!

#more than just a song

**bbfan132** (10): these singles are god-tier

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Ok the Syrian music sample is so inventive aaaa and yes Aaliyah get this guy!

**EnCaine** (10): I have an image somewhere of a guy holding up a sign that says "I'm a virgin Aaliyah marry me" and like yeah

**fairytalehigh** (10): aaliyah's beguiling delivery, the vocal effects, the bass squiggles, the earworm chorus, that hypnotic beat. everything, everything is perfect, not a moment wasted. what more is there to say.

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): This is the best beat Timbaland ever produced, yep yep!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way the first four songs on this album absolutely SERVE

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): the strings are incredible, it's so catchy, but the Outro is a bit long

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): maybe the first time in history an artist has made a fart synth sound good

**fadedblue09** (10): Another personal 11 contender and probably the most danceable track on the album, here we see Brandy call out an unfaithful lover amidst Darkchild‚Äôs electrofunk production. One brilliant element of this song is how it utilizes the call-and-response technique by means of vocal production, and just captures how Brandy uses her voice like no other 

 Overall, I‚Äôm pleased how this did, to the point that I‚Äôm actually surprised it made it this far?? I knew this was a fan fave among Brandy stans but I didn‚Äôt expect it to translate to popheads. This is by far our highest-rated non-single track, and the fact it outlasted fellow Darkchild joint What About Us is impressive.

**nt96** (9.5): This was a surprise for sure! Personally, I felt that this song was a better version of What About Us, and to my liking, you guys seemed to agree! Even to the point where it beat a majority of the singles, comfortably cementing itself onto an admirable 4th place, the highest rated deep cut on the list. Can't be mad about that!

#i think we all liked this song
**ignitethephoenix** (11): this may be the first time where a song in a rate I have heard for the first time is my 11, her power

**sarcasticsobs** (11): wtf

**Awkward\_King** (10): this might just be the best song i ever heard

**BaconShoes** (10): the way the vocals are layered on this is insane omg. A bop, i love the production

**bbfan132** (10): this beat‚Ä¶

**BeauMeringue212** (10): From what I've read online this wasn't of the most popular tracks on FM, but this is like perfect 00s dance pop to me. The electronic production is of its time but not dated, and I enjoy Arandy's moreTastyy vocals

**CrimsonROSET** (10): but did she

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): THIS BEAT GOES TOO HARD. and all the vocal layering!! And Brandy and Rodney‚Äôs artistic chemistry between each other! Her vocal runs on the latter half of the song! WHAT? YES YOU DID Brandy!!!

**EnCaine** (10): probably the best Brandy song

**fairytalehigh** (10): the stacked vocals and the back-and-forth is what does it for me, it's like there's dozens of brandys all over the track both asking questions and already knowing the answers. the fact that it goes over a beat that knocks like this is just icing on the cake. my first favorite from this album.

**fickle\_music\_788** (10): This should have been a single. Brandy just goes all out with the adlibs here and the beat has to keep up with her, not the other way round.

**frogaranaman** (10): @Brandy this instrumental is the pussy part of production

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the backing vocals are so amazing

**jay slay yas** (10): 11 contender omfg

**MassiveThief** (10): I now see why she's called the Vocal Bible.

**seanderlust** (10): it's a bop but the song is definitely made by the background "no you didn't" and "yes i did"

**shipperondeck** (10): yo that intro bitch slapped me across my room (i'm okay) (it was a positive experience)

**throwaway-7650** (10): I, thot

**TiltControls** (10): Almost the 11. Just a full bop

**1998tweety** (9.5): hold awn this BOPS

**akanewasright** (9.5): I‚Äôd make an ‚ÄúI thought it was the best song I‚Äôd ever heard‚Äù joke here, but there are several songs better than this on the album

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): VOCALS theres not much else to say

**celladonn** (9): Impossible not to sing along to the "no you didn't"s and "yes i did"s

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ‚ÄúNo, you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I did,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes, I really did‚Äù were all said 16 times each during this song

**welcome2thejam** (9): Solid bop, and once it hits the bridge the thing hits overdrive

**Bordersz** (8.5): She was singing like bills were due 2 months ago. Her runs are like silk. The beat is JUMPING.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): yes I‚Äôm shaking my body

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ok the beat starts a bit weird but I think she owns it with her voice, she sounds pretty good!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): this has a nice glide to it but something also feels a little weightless

#or so....I thought

**MrSwearword** (0): this is fucking horrible. It's literally a lazier B Rocka Intro which was already a janky Limewire preview of What About Us, throw this entire fucking thing in the trash.

**fadedblue09** (5): I guess a popheads rate is never complete without a hot take from yours truly, and unfortunately, it looks like this song is the victim of that. I get that a lot of fans have an emotional connection to this track given the tragic circumstances around it, but on its own, I just don‚Äôt find it particularly interesting. It‚Äôs a nice, summery bop, but the best track on The Red Album? Idk about that. It doesn‚Äôt help that the lyrics are basically just a bunch of sex instructions, and Aaliyah‚Äôs vocal gets overshadowed by the instrumental at times. 

This was the runner-up some point and tbh I was willing to concede if it did win, but in the end it fell short of reaching the top 3.

**nt96** (10): the song and video are the essence of smooth and sensual. This song was literally born to be a summer hit, but sadly it wasn't meant to be. A day or two after filming the video, Aaliyah and 8 others were killed in a plane crash. To this day I still can't see the MV without feeling bittersweet, and there's something eerily beautiful about that final shot. She's swimming up to the surface, it's also as if she's ascending to heaven as well. Little things like that really change the whole vibe and was exceptionally well done. Really happy to just how positively receptive everyone was, and well earned placement to a rather emotional, but beautiful sendoff to a stellar career.

#enjoys doing it on a boat
**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): songs this effortlessly smooth and sexy are rare

**BaconShoes** (11): one of the best and sexiest songs ever made

**bulforster** (11): there's no competition, this song is just so effortlessly perfect

**daretheghost** (11): let's coooast

**oscarbrierley1** (11): so recognisable, such a bop, just makes you wanna get up and dance.

**seanderlust** (11): it would be easy to 11 this just because it was one of the (if not the?) last songs to get a video before the tragic plane crash. it quite helps though that this is simply one of the best R&B songs ever made.

**2dina3dworld** (10): make a bitch sick, diarrhoea

**akanewasright** (10): every now and then I think about the quote from Aaliyah in reference to her version of Got to Give It Up where she said that she hoped that people cover her music when she was no longer around. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ honestly something that I think about a lot with artists who‚Äôve passed away. Like I had a hard time with Sophie‚Äôs passing because of how utterly joyful so much of her catalogue is, like what gives me the right to dance when she‚Äôs gone? But that‚Äôs how you pay tribute to artists like this, you keep their legacy alive. All this to say - this is a wonderful, brilliantly slinky R&B track, and it‚Äôs kind of insane to me that this was her final single for that reason‚Ä¶ but since this song so completely played to her strengths as a singer and performer

**apatel27** (10): Pure Sex

**bbfan132** (10): beyond gorgeous

**Bordersz** (10): Iconic. It is a really smooth R&B song. Her voice is like silk on it. I love her runs on this so much. It is so light.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i see we have reached the clit of the rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the greatest vibe music of all time???

**EnCaine** (10): The video for this is so iconic despite everything + this is one of the smoothest tracks ever

**flavasavavandal** (10): took me a few listens to realise this was not about sailing

**frogaranaman** (10): Aaliyah was so right for this one

**jay slay yas** (10): my original 11..

**RandomHypnotica** (10): my seasick ask is begging for you not to

**runaway3212** (10): now this is a slay

**throwaway-7650** (10): lyrics are giving wii fit whitewater rafting tutorial voiceover

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): jfc

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): she came to FUCK

**1998tweety** (9.5): what i say i dont wanna do when i dont call my family out whenever they do something problematic

**Awkward\_King** (9): play tia tamera as the interlude yass

**fairytalehigh** (9): hey ariana, this is how you do a sex jam

**fickle\_music\_788** (9): Ran so positions could limp.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): don‚Äôt tip the boat over

**shipperondeck** (9): despite how amazing this song is, it does make me pretty sad sometimes

**Stryxen** (9): i wish i could justify making a sex playlist

**TiltControls** (9): send me into the water

**ignitethephoenix** (8): horny hours here

**MrSwearword** (8): honestly, for as deliciously vulgar as "work the middle" is, the song is well made fluff.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The chorus is so hilariously explicit I have a hard time taking it seriously‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still definitely one of the smoothest sex jams out there

#i dont wanna drown
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): :(

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): big freedia could‚Äôve wrote this chorus

**welcome2thejam** (7): As a kid, my mind always remembered the lyric as "work the mill, work the mill" as if she had some big flour fetish

**IIIHenryIII** (6.9): I can make your boat rock

**fadedblue09** (8): And so the frontrunner falls short of victory. One of Aaliyah‚Äôs most popular singles and and a huge hit of the 2000s in general, Try Again was originally a soundtrack for the film Romeo Must Die, where Aaliyah starred in, and was included as a bonus track on the international versions of The Red Album. Its elements of EDM and Detroit techno make it one of the more sonically unique tracks in the rate, and its chorus is irresistibly catchy. Personally, there are parts that I am lukewarm on, but otherwise this would‚Äôve made a worthy winner as well.

 It took a while for the song to take the top spot. As we approached 30 ballots, this song was actually winning the rate and I thought it would hold on there moving forward‚Ä¶..until u/flavasavavandal came swooping in like an assassin, and immediately knocked it off its throne. Eventually, the song would get more 11s (it had the most 11s in the rate) which helped it claw back to the top 2, but alas, it was not enough by the end of the rate. True to its name, maybe it can try again in All Stars, perhaps?

**nt96** (11): 11 And with that, my 11 is gone üòî. As much as I wanted Aaliyah to win, I honestly cant be mad at this placement just cuz of how strong Full Moon is, there's no denying that. Say what you will about this, but this song truly kicked off the new millennium the best way possible. The ricocheting squelches, that pulsating beat, the trumpets, the iconic visuals, the gorgeous outfit and my girl being one of, if not THE first stars to rock the ever-so ubiquitous ombre hairstyle YEARS before it became trendy, its got everything you need to kickstart the new decade in style and SHE. DID. THAT. She may have left us long ago, but not without a dope beat to step to, one that will continue to inspire for generations to come. Fingers crossed for All Stars!

#at first you don't succeed..
**akanewasright** (11): I know this isn‚Äôt technically an album cut, but it feels like such a nice closer to me, like an ending credits song. This is one of my favorite Aaliyah songs, and one that just makes me happy from start to finish. It makes me dance, what more can I say?

**babadork** (11): It might be because I spent hours learning the dance from the video, but I could put this on repeat for hours and be fine.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): iconic af. I remember there was a ‚ÄúBillboard Decade End 2000s‚Äù video that was a countdown of the top 100 songs on the billboard decade end for 2000s and it said what album every song in the video was on listed with the rest of its information (such as year released, label, etc), except for Try Again, so that made me think that Aaliyah died before she even made an album for a while.

**MassiveThief** (11): it's timeless. it really is.

**skargardin** (11): There are quite a many 11 contenders in this rate, I'm just going to go with what my gut tells me on this one. I absolutely adore this song, what a way to end the album experience on.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): yas sexual harrassment anthem! Also pretty sure I‚Äôm getting my first rate win with this one lol. I tried to listen really hard but in the end I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other song in this rate with this level of groove, funk, catchiness, charisma, talent, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs an RnB classic for a reason!

**Awkward\_King** (10): i feel like this song was the first song to ever exist and ever other song copied it. like this is one of the songiest songs ive ever heard. banger

**BaconShoes** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): love the production here

**Bordersz** (10): A classic. Production is slick, fresh and innovative. Timbaland is a genius. Aaliyah's vocals are gorgeous on here. It is so light and airy sliding on a fantastic beat. The chorus is iconic.

**celladonn** (10): A classic!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): is it repetitive? Yeah, but like if I have one good chocolate cake I won‚Äôt complain if people just full on Matilda me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This was my third 11 contender. The melody is perfect and the subtle production is just too amazing. Timbaland could really bring out those small little drum lines to make a total bop

**EnCaine** (10): i thought romeo must die and john tucker must die were the same movie until i was like 20

**fairytalehigh** (10): one of those songs where i heard it and i realized i've been hearing it for years. the song is so unfuckwithably cool, and aaliyah's verses so magnetic, that it can be easy to overlook what a warm and fun song it is. the scenario--boy likes girl, boy asks girl out, girl says no BUT encourages him to start over--is relatable, rather unique in pop, and quite endearing. and aaliyah's flow in the verses is pure earsex.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it's not fair to put the word "again" in the title of your song just so we have the urge to play it over and over again

**maxisgold** (10): I mean, come on, what can I even say about this BOP.

**MrSwearword** (10): iCannot at this being her only number one, thanks to Romeo Must Die for something.

**seanderlust** (10): this was actually the first aaliyah song i fell in love with! i heard it on my now that's what i call music vol. ??? cd and was mesmirized.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): so this was the only song in this rate i was really familiar with before hand and i thought for sure it was gonna end up my 11 and im pleasantly surprised it didnt. but it did fight for it

**throwaway-7650** (10): is I'M SO FREAKY FREAKY FISHY pt. 2 timbaland's doing... fuck

**TiltControls** (10): The Chainsmokers coming into yet another All Stars rate

**welcome2thejam** (10): Leaving us off with the dopest beat to step to

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): should've taken her own advice when making this song -me if i was horribly tasteless

**1998tweety** (9): ended shakira

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): "just try again" is not good dating advice at all but this bops so it's fine

**oscarbrierley1** (8.2): one of timbaland's best beats, but it gets kinda repetitive

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A decent note to end the album on but not a standout

**runaway3212** (7): she's cute she can stay till day 2

**Stryxen** (6.4): it‚Äôs great but just starts to overstay its welcome towards the end

#tell us how you feel girl

**flavasavavandal** (1): I‚Äôve known this song since at least 2011, which was when I first started searching for music on my own via youtube and has generally been heralded as one of the best R&B songs of the decade by quite a lot of people and I disliked then. But that was over ten years ago and I was wrong about a lot of things at 14. Plus I‚Äôve heard and gotten into more R&B since then even if I‚Äôm still a casual listener. So maybe my more mature ears would be more accustomed to Try Again. Unfortunately I was right at 14 and I still think this song sucks, probably even more. I hate the fart-like synth noises that just exist and have the most disgusting texture to them, I hate this limp excuse of a groove, I hate how the content of this song is just so incredibly banal, while the production tries to give it this futuristic action-packed vibe to fit the film when the basic premise is don‚Äôt give up on trying to date this girl, because she might like you if you persist when 9/10 times that just won‚Äôt happen and even in this specific case, I‚Äôm just doubtful it will. So yeah im giving this a 1

**fadedblue09** (10): And here it is, our rate winner. The second single and title track off Brandy‚Äôs third studio album, this song has Brandy compare a love at first sight moment to seeing a full moon. The song itself is smooth, silky and very nocturnal in its vibe. At first listen, it‚Äôs seems like a typical 90s R&B song, a vocals-dominated  track driven by an instrument (piano). But on closer listen, you can uncover the underlying contemporary elements: a pulsating club beat and Brandy‚Äôs masterful vocal production (in particular, her runs in the second chorus are immaculate).  It may not be the obvious winner, but it perfectly captures the era and development of R&B at the time. We are very proud in sending this to Winners Rate 3, where hopefully I can finally give this my 11. 

Was this a surprise? Maybe a couple of people might have guessed, but what I‚Äôm surprised is how this song basically dominated throughout the rate. During the first few weeks, this song was in the top spot, swapping positions with What About Us (needless to say, Brandy had the entire top 2 at that point). It was briefly interrupted by Try Again mid-month, whose reign was short-lived (see below). Brandy reclaimed the top 2 after that and towards the end of the rate, What About Us sank out of the top 5, but this song kept its lead. All the other Aaliyah singles in the top 5 tried to catch up but alas, none of them were able to overcome this track‚Äôs lead.

**nt96** (10):Ladies and Gentlemen, our winner!! And a well deserved one at that. How can you not get a rush with that vocal POWER. She is the Vocal Bible and there's nothing you can do about that. I don‚Äôt think this even left the top 5. Give it up for Full Moon everybody!!! And don‚Äôt forget to give her your 11s for the Winners Rate!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): This song is a triumph. It is a victory lap. Brandy is one of the greatest vocalists who have ever lived, and this song perfectly showcases that. Her range on this song is insane. Don‚Äôt even get me started on Darkchild‚Äôs production! (Host's note: Darkchild wasn't in this but otherwise perfect comment).

**bbfan132** (10): brandy‚Äôs vocals, the production‚Ä¶. this song is perfect

**celladonn** (10): I wish the full moon made me more extroverted and impulsive... it just makes me sit outside alone and say Wow moon big.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): For my Buffyheads out there, this is Willow and Oz‚Äôs relationship anthem

**frogaranaman** (10): this is so hot

**indiefan** (10): I remember hearing this song everywhere as a kid and absolutely loving it every time it came out. That much has definitely not changed for me.

**MassiveThief** (10): The way her vocals and the trumpets mirror each other is just... god tier. I want to hear the chorus on repeat til the end of time.

**maxisgold** (10): Best know I played the SHIT out of this song in Donkey Konga 2 for the GameCube.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): so smooth, the cutfather and joe remix is also incredible

**qazz23** (10): her voice sounds amazing

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 4 minutes still felt too short tbh

**throwaway-7650** (10): waiting for enhypen fanfic writers to discover this furry anthem

**you2009** (10): if they put this on the twilight soundtrack instead of that paramore song it would've distracted us from stephanie meyer being an evil racist for at least 15 more years

**shipperondeck** (9.8): im going to regret not giving this a 10 i fear

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): that chorus is fucking bulletproof. love the vocal harmonies too

**1998tweety** (9): ended Twilight

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this song is about werewolves

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): So Brandy has claimed that this is a concept album about the rise and fall of a relationship and while I think that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ generous, of her, I do think it was smart to start the album off with a song about two people meeting because it does set the tone well. And those vocals on the bridge, well, can‚Äôt argue with those.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): its a little generic tbh but i still like it

**MrSwearword** (8): more of a waxing crescent than a full moon, but the effort was cute.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Very pretty, even if I‚Äôm not a big fan of the trumpets‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (8): I ain't even gonna front... that was great!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I‚Äôm glad the vocals kicked in more at the end because it was a little one note for me until that point

IIIHenryIII: Oh, that's right! My 11 was supposed to go to Los Angeles in that rate (don't remember the title - Indie Women something, I guess), but then I decided to change before sending my ballot. So that's the third time my 11 has won. To be honest, I didn't even think before sending my comment. Also, I have a horrible memory lol

Anyway, I was going to give my 11 to We Need a Resolution, because that has become my favorite song in this rate; however, I thought Aliyah was definitely going to pull out the win and I had already sent my ballot so I decided to maintain my original scores. I wanted Brandy to win so bad, especially because I fell in love with Full Moon as soon as I heard it for the first time.

RandomHypnotica: I didn‚Äôt mean to interrogate you or anything! I was just updating the winners pastebin and saw you already had 2 wins next to your name and was confused lol.

Congrats on the tasteful 11 win!

IIIHenryIII: Dont worry! That's not how I took it. I actually appreciate the fact that you pointed that out.

Oh, that's news to me. I didn't even know you guys kept track of the wins we had. I'm definitely going to check it out!

RandomHypnotica: It was originally created by TK, but he hadn't updated it since last November's rates, so I took over and updated it a few weeks ago, you can find it at the bottom of the [rate stats page](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_11_wins) (along with other things such as Solo 11's, 11 Misses (when your 11 comes second) and more!), or there's a link [here to the 11 wins](https://pastebin.com/JdAbTxtC)!

throwaway-7650: I suppose Aaliyah's rate win will have to wait until AS6 but Fu11 Moon is an amazing winner!

we are voting in Rock the Boat btw

# Full Moon

---

**Overall Average**: 7.883 **// Average Controversy:** 1.626

---

nt96: Despite being my lowest average of the 3, this is still a strong album! From the get go, Full Moon made sure that the listener forgets EVERYTHING you knew about Brandy. Gone was that sweet, girl-next door image everyone fell in love with. Gone were those pretty little braids she rocked during her Moesha years. All those trials and tribulations she went through only emboldened her to become the woman she is now. There is a reason that only SHE is the vocal bible and guess which album we have to thank for that. To this day, many vocalists look up to this album is THE blueprint for how to do vocals and its influence shows. Even after 20 years have officially passed since this album was released, its still considered by many to be Brandy's magnum opus, an affirmation I don't see changing anytime soon.

fadedblue09: I‚Äôm so glad to have hosted this rate and discover a new favorite album! Definitiely a well-textured album that makes use of vocal production techniques excellently, and Brandy is just consistent throughout.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.844): This is one of my favorite albums ever. It‚Äôs so sophisticated yet adventurous. It‚Äôs extremely cohesive while remaining engaging to listen to with its creative production and Brandy‚Äôs flawless vocals. Brandy and Rodney made a magical album

**throwaway-7650** (9.563): despite not getting my 11, brandy has the best album imo

**indiefan** (9.113): If I‚Äôm being honest, I think this album is the most cohesive and consistent out of the three. And that‚Äôs really impressive considering it‚Äôs also the longest.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.831): There is not a single skip on this album, the vocal production is stellar and Brandy's tone is just beautiful throughout

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.813): she should be in jail for what she did to these other girls omg

**skargardin** (8.813): This was the first Brandy album I chose to listen to out of my own volition a while ago, and I was simply floored by her vocals. SO many standout moments where you just have to pause and admire her vocal prowess. It's really no wonder that she's called the "vocal bible".

**fairytalehigh** (8.794): i'm completely sold on brandy thanks to this rate. this album is just so cohesive and lovely, it almost seems unfair to rate the songs period (much less stack them against anyone else). brandy has such a warm quality to her voice, it's just... comforting to listen to her sing anything.

**2dina3dworld** (8.719): this is a straight 10/10 as a whole product, but individually some songs don‚Äôt stand as strongly on their own.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.481): my exposure to Brandy prior to this really was just her ‚ÄúCinderella‚Äù movie and ‚ÄúThe Boy is Mine‚Äù and let‚Äôs just say i have been missing out

**shipperondeck** (8.269): after i rated this album i recommended it to a friend. he told me he disliked it. i am now reconsidering our friendship

**babadork** (8.081): This album is a great example of how to transition from a teen star to an adult career.

**plastichaxan** (8.081): I thought this would be a chore to go through, long tracklist, most songs longer than 4 minutes, it had everything in its power to bore me or make me tired, and while it had some duds it had a really good pace and really really great standouts. Love to see it

**welcome2thejam** (8.063): So many tracks that hung in that good but not great zone for a while before it got elevated with just the right hook or production move or Brandy's vocals

**EnCaine** (7.881): I would go to church if this was the bible. Even the filler tracks on this record are cool because of how well the vocals are done (both performance and mixing). Plus there's a lot of great early 2000s wacky production that I'll never get sick of

**cremeebrulee** (7.631): this was a pleasant surprise! a bit long but there‚Äôs a lot of interesting production and brandy‚Äôs voice is lovely so it was pretty compelling all the way through. definitely putting some other brandy albums on my backlog after this

**flavasavavandal** (7.563): a surprise, a very pleasant surprise. I was sure Aaliyah would take home my highest average going into this, and Brandy would maybe get 2 high scores with everything else being in the mid range. But I was wrong. Now there is a lot of mid here, mostly courtesy of the fact that Darkchild is a very mid producer but there is a lot more excellence than i was expecting, from the compelling sensuality on When You Touch Me, to the mostly terrific back half. But Brandy is at her best when she ignores the rate title and sings traditional R&B cuts. Not sure if it‚Äôs better than Aaliyah but it‚Äôs close

**IIIHenryIII** (7.331): It's a pretty good album. I love the fact that all the songs hit the 4 minutes mark, which doesn't happen with the albums we get nowadays. She should've just cut a couple of ballads off; the second half is full of them, and I was kinda exhausted after listening to 4 in a row.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.162): Starts strong but there's also quite a lot of songs here that just don't really do it for me

**MassiveThief** (6.781): Very pleasantly surprised, this rocks! I honestly only knew of Brandy because "The Boy Is Mine" was #1 on Billboard when I was born. Vocal Bible title is deserved, even if the album drags on too long.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.750): I feel so compelled to like Brandy for the really dumb reason of a Brandy song was #1 on the day I was born‚Ä¶ But I did not really vibe with this one. Her vocals are beautiful, but the way they tried to integrate the futuristic synths and sounds into the music just feels very clumsy and disjointed, the other two albums do it way better. My favorite tracks off of this one are definitely the more retro-90s-sounding ones!

**qazz23** (6.750): not bad but this felt too long with some weaker tracks on the back half

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.494): the textbook definition of a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù album. there wasn‚Äôt anything here that was particularly awful but outside of a couple tracks nothing was really amazing either. i guess i just set my expectations too high and expected this album to sound different from what it was‚Ä¶i see why people enjoy it though its just not for me

**bulforster** (6.406): A very consistent album but the vocals rarely mesh properly with the production for me. Her vocal arrangements are definitely the highlight so it's easy to see why she's famous for them, I think I just prefer them over less flashy production so that they're the focus (I really like Never Say Never!)

fadedblue09: # Aaliyah

---

**Overall Average**: 8.170 **// Average Controversy:** 1.577

---

nt96: 9.23 What can I say about this album that hasn't been said before? Growing up with Aaliyah's music, this easily sits among my top 5 favorite albums. The music, the visuals, the fashion, all showcase just how ahead of the curb Aaliyah was and still is! To this day, you still see up-and-coming artists taking notes of her work. It's a shame that for the longest time, her shady label resulted in her music being left in the dark for so long, preventing most of the new generation from properly experiencing her music, until now! Words can't express how elated and humbled I am that I got to mark my host debut with this album and seeing more people listening to this in the process! Next stop: One In A Million!

fadedblue09: a solid and sonically diverse album that provided a glimpse of a trailblazing act that continues to be influential today

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.600): Really the pinnacle of Aaliyah, and her vision with Timbaland and Static Major. So playfully inventive and emotional. Aaliyah has such a great range here with her sweet, angelic voice. I Refuse is an all-time great, dramatic cut. You don‚Äôt hear many Aaliyah songs like that which makes it all the more special. Rest in peace always, angel.

**skargardin** (9.333): God what a strong album, probably my favourite in this rate to listen to front-to-back. I'm so glad that we finally got around to rating Aaliyah.

**babadork** (9.167): It was a struggle to not be too biased towards this album. I was so emotional about Aaliyah‚Äôs music being released on streaming that I talked about it with my therapist,

**fairytalehigh** (9.160): a flawless album by a flawless artist. rip, baby girl.

**throwaway-7650** (9.067): she deserves to win but rating her at all is a dream come true

**daretheghost** (9.000): This album really takes me back to when I was growing up. It really felt like Aaliyah was destined for greatness and it‚Äôs such a shame she passed while she was right on that cusp.

**shipperondeck** (8.920): I love this album so much + Aaliyah is one of the most beautiful women who has ever lived I think

**EnCaine** (8.913): First off, rest in peace to both Aaliyah and Static - two insane talents that were tragically taken from us too soon. Secondly, this is one of the most important albums in the world to me

**akanewasright** (8.807): May Aaliyah Rest In Peace :(((((

**plastichaxan** (8.767): I hadn‚Äôt listened to Aaliyah previous to the rate apart from What If and Rock the Boat, and I don‚Äôt know, it feels a bit odd to be listening or bopping to this and remembering how much of a talent we lost so soon and it makes me sad, but her legacy is very clear and this album was just amazing.

**qazz23** (8.667): really good R&B, most of the tracks are memorable and have a strong hook

**indiefan** (8.487): There are so many 11 contenders on this album, it's insane. I did wish that Aaliyah was more involved with the songwriting side of music, but damn does her silky voice and charisma still shine through.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.127): This is the best album in the rate, no doubts. I only knew Try Again and Are You That Somebody before this rate so now I can confirm that she truly was ahead of her time. It's such a shame we didn't get to see what else she was capable of. Magnificent artist.

**welcome2thejam** (8.067): Great album. Lot of fun hits from growing up, and while it's an uphill battle for me to gel with more subdued tracks, Aaliyah is a good enough presence (albeit a presence that's also a bit subdued lol) and the production takes enough interesting turns to keep my attention.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.940): It's so great that Aaliyah's music is finally on streaming! Listening to the whole album gives you a great impression of how progressive and innovative Aaliyah was, there's such a mix of influences and styles. Some tracks didn't fully work for me, but when the songs are good on this album, they're really fucking good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.907): i‚Äôll admit going into this rate i never listened to any of these albums before so i was going in with pretty low expectations but uh‚Ä¶yeah i think i get why people call this one of the greatest albums of the 2000‚Äôs

**thedoctordances1940** (7.793): Good album overall, definitely has its moments and not really too much in terms of filler, really great final 2 tracks are the standouts

**cremeebrulee** (7.600): the only album i knew going into this so maybe i‚Äôm a bit biased, but tbh i think if this was my first listen it would still be my favorite of the three. it‚Äôs the most consistent and aaliyah sounds gorgeous throughout the whole project. i didn‚Äôt 11 anything here (brandy managed to take it away) but i am rooting for her!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.333): This is a very pretty album, and Aaliyah has a wonderfully sweet-as-honey voice to go along with all of the smooth bops‚Ä¶ but unfortunately it seems like that sweet-as-honey voice is all she can do‚Ä¶ I feel like the other two albums here show off far more of their singers‚Äô vocal skills and diversity than Aaliyah‚Äôs does. Though in summary I suppose this isn‚Äôt too much of a knock on her, cause when she gets it right she gets it right.

**flavasavavandal** (7.300): I really liked this album, it felt pretty adventurous and experimental in it‚Äôs steps towards furthering the R&B genre without forgetting the good hooks, and stunning yet commanding vocals performances colour the majority of this album, and it‚Äôs easy to see why so many of the current generation of R&B gals take inspiration from Aaliyah. But I have some quibbles and nit-picks here. Mostly the opener sucks relative to the rest of the album and maybe a few too many songs had moments where I‚Äôm like, you coulda pulled that off better or you coulda just not done it at all. Overall, very good album, glad I got the chance to check it out

**bulforster** (7.260): This album is very hit or miss for me, the songs are either amazing or have a really off-putting element. Luckily there are more of the first!

TiltControls: Great fantastic job with the rate Faded and Cat!! Some great shitpost suspense from the reveal and great writeups throughout!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

Congrats to Brandy to pulling out the unlikely, but still deserved win with **Full Moon**! **Full Moon** places 141st across all rated songs. It sits below The 1975's The Sound and above Kanye West's Real Friends.

For the other 9+ scorers

* **Try Again**: 175th

* **Rock The Boat**: 196th (ties with Maren Morris' 80s Mercedes)

* **I Thought**: 247th

* **More Than A Woman**: 276th (ties with SOPHIE's Ponyboy)

Here are some other song records for the rate:

* Kelis' tasty **Intro** makes the leaderboard for highest controversy. It is the sub's **12th most controversial song** across all rates. This places it right below The Pogue's Fairytale of New York and above John Cage's iconic 4:33. It knocks Madonna's Act of Contrition off the controversy leaderboard

* **Milkshake** also takes the record for day 3 song with the highest controversy across all rates, surpassing the previous record holder by 0.003 which was Charli's Vroom Vroom way back in the 2016 EP Rate where it still managed to place 5th despite the incredibly high 2.9 controversy.

##**Artists**

For this section Brandy and Aaliyah are coming in with no previous ranking (Brandy has a previous score for The Boy Is Mine boosting her average) and Kelis has existing scores from her previous album rate.

**Artist Rankings (out of 312)**

_

* 30th: Pusha T (8.176)
* **31st: Aaliyah (8.171) [NEW RANKING]**
* 32nd: Marvin Gaye (8.167)

_

* 30th: Q-Tip (7.912)
* **67th: Brandy (7.906) [NEW RANKING]**
* 32nd: Wolf Alice (7.888)

_

* 147th: The Weeknd (7.572)
* **148th: Kelis (7.570) [PREVIOUSLY 115th]**
* 149th: TLC (7.549)

Also due to some guest appearances we've got a leaderboard record for an artist!

With his 5th song rated with We Need a Resolution, **Timbaland** has enough songs scored for an artist ranking (previously he had 3 ratings of Promiscuous and 1 for 4 Minutes). He manages to currently hold the **3rd highest average across Popheads rates** with a 8.657 across his 5 ratings. He knocks Roisin Murphy off the leaderboard.

##**Albums**

**Album Rankings (Out of 344 albums - not including EPs)**

_

* 36th: Solange - A Seat at the Table (8.186)
* **37th: Aaliyah - Aaliyah (8.171)**
* 38th: Janelle Mon√°e - Dirty Computer (8.170)

_

* 84th: Tegan & Sara - Love You to Death (7.884)
* **85th: Brandy - Full Moon (7.883)**
* 86th: Kylie Minogue - Fever (7.882)

_

* 198th: Billie Eilish - WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (7.479)
* **199th: Kelis - Tasty (7.475)**
* 200th: Ed Sheeran - x (7.470)

##**Rates**

* Another record for Kelis (unfortunately). With a 9th place exit for Trick Me she takes a spot on the **earliest exits leaderboard for a 3 album rate**. She ties other 9th outers The Vamps, Charli XCX, and Karol G for 3rd - with D'Angelo and Kylie holding them off from the top spot.

* Kelis also gets the another unfortunate leaderboard spot with **highest % of rate 0's** with nearly 1/3rd of the raters giving her theirs in the rate. With 30.4%, she takes a spot in 8th place for this record and knocks off Taylor Swift's Lover.

* Though she didn't get a leaderboard spot for it, Aaliyah gets close to one with the highest % of 11s given in a rate with 52.2% of ballots giving her theirs. This would put her in 13th for this stat.
