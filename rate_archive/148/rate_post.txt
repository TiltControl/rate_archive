We need a resolution, [and what better way to end this rate season than with style?](https://imgur.com/a/cZPYzlP)


Greetings, fellow Popheads, we're your cohosts, [nt96 and fadedblue](https://imgur.com/a/1NZK3Ng) and welcome to the 2000s Futuristic R&B Rate!!

This month we're going to be rating three forward thinking artists who have made indelible marks on the genre and beyond: Aaliyah, Brandy and Kelis! Without further ado, let's take a deep dive into their albums!


#[**Aaliyah - Aaliyah**](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/gfiz6e5yrplm820dxlly/aaliyah?fimg-ssr-default)

Singer and R&B icon, Aaliyah got her start at the tender age of 15, with her 1994 debut album, Age Ain't Nothing But A Number. Her silky smooth vocals combined with the new jack swing beats made her teen pop star to look after. Two years later, producer Timbaland and Missy Elliot got ahold of her, and that's when the real magic started. Her sophomore album, One In A Million, traded the 90s hip hop beats for something more sleek, dare I say...futuristic? Critics and audiences alike took note of the smooth, stuttering beats, something unheard of at the time. It was at this moment where Aaliyah, Missy and Timbaland became forces to be reckoned with, something akin to the Midas touch in the Hip Hop/R&B world. Over the years, Aaliyah steadily climbed up the ranks. 

She recorded classics like Journey to The Past and Are You That Somebody for different film soundtracks. She kicked off the new millennium in style with her film debut, Romeo Must Die co-starring Jet Li. Her single Try Again topped the charts based on airplay alone, the first artist to achieve that feat. After 5 years, she finally announced her self-titled album, Aaliyah, aka "The Red Album". Described as her version of Control, this album marks a transition from the shy, mysterious pop girl image to a matured, young woman. The album received rave reviews and everything seemed to go well for the artist.

At least we hoped. On August 2001, Aaliyah and 8 others were killed in a plane crash, she was 22. The shocking end of her career still lingers today as many people lament on what could've been. 

All tragedies aside, in her 7 years, she changed the R&B landscape and no where proves that better than the Aaliyah album. Drawing from a multitude of genres, Aaliyah is an eclectic album by heart. Ranging from Middle Eastern music, to Alt-Rock to Latin music. For her main singles, We Need A Resolution opens the album in a seductive, hypnotic manner, permeated with a Middle Eastern vibe with idiosyncratic beats. Rock The Boat's calypso rhythm and songwriting shows off a more sensual side of Aaliyah that we've never seen before. More Than A Woman continues the trademark Arabic influences coupled with a more grandiose, electronic backdrop. I Care 4 U slows things down as she distresses unrequited feelings for a friend in need of consoling. And finally, Try Again returns centerstage with its squelching acid synths and futuristic beats, bringing the album to a satisfying close. 

Overall, this album left a lasting impression on the musicscape, redefining the sound of the new millennium and influencing acts such as The Weeknd, Drake, Beyonce, The xx, Solange and many others. For the longest time, the best way to listen to her albums was through YouTube, but after 20 years of being in the dark, we can finally stream her music in its entirety! Growing up with her music, this album is among my all-time favorites and I hope you'll enjoy it too!

#[**Brandy - Full Moon**](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27369ca5eaea8f0afe8cbdba117)

Growing up the 90s, Brandy Norwood's success was instant as it was meteoric. Her clean image coupled with the lead roles of Moesha and Cinderella earned her a reputation of being America's sweetheart, an R&B Princess and a role model for many black women. Despite her massive success, the hectic lifestyle as well as emotional abuse from a failed relationship resulted in her having a nervous breakdown. With the second album being a multi platinum success, Brandy dreaded the idea of making a third that failed to meet expectations. Because of all this, she decided to take a hiatus to reflect and introspect. Over the years, she gained creative control of her next project as well as gradually honing her vocal craft, until finally in 2002 she released her latest album, Full Moon. The album features a more electronic production, heavily inspired by European nightclubs, featuring genres like neo-soul and 2-step, just to name a few.

Her first single, aptly titled Full Moon vocally showcases Brandy at her fullest potential, all thanks to Vocal Stacking, a technique where you record yourself singing a line and then recording over that one, but perhaps in harmony or the same tone in order to give your vocals a fuller tone. Usually, there's 4 vocal recordings in stacking, however in Brandy's case, she recorded and perfected each note 16 times! What About Us features squelching basslines and aggressive beats, adding an edgier side to Brandy's sound. Her third and final single, He Is, is a soul ballad talking about God in third person.


Full Moon's initial reviews were generally mixed, however as time went on, it earned its much deserved acclaim from critics, musicians and producers alike. This era marked a change in Brandy's image as well. No longer sporting the "girl next door" image, she traded her signature boxer braids with sleek, straight hair and heavy makeup, asserting the public that she's now a woman. Thanks to her impeccable vocal work, Full Moon sparked the idea of giving Brandy the nickname, "The Vocal Bible". Songwriter Sean Garrett credits the vocal work on the album for his approach to writing, saying "I take a lot from what [Brandy] and Rodney did on the Full Moon album. I was extremely impressed with it and I always try to outdo that album." B.Slade spoke of the album, commenting Full Moon single-handedly changed the vocal game. "It has been the template for vocal choices and background vocal arrangements [for years]." R&B singer Melanie Fiona especially admired the singer's work on that album, dubbing Norwood the "Harmony Queen". Neo soul singer India.Arie often cites the album, particularly the song "He Is" as being the template for a wide array of singers. Canadian R&B singer Keshia Chanté credited the album for inspiring her writing for her album Night & Day, while American singer Luke James referred to Full Moon as the "bible" of 2000s contemporary R&B, calling it the "blueprint of how to do vocals".

#[**Kelis - Tasty**](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc265e6ef95969322d9f/1:1/w_600/b5b2157b.jpg)

And our final competitor for this rate, who also has made a previous rate appearance (and coincidentally that her previous rate was also futuristic-themed), is none other than Kelis! An alumna of a performing arts school in New York, Kelis made her entry into the music industry after finishing high school by being a backup vocalist for a hip hop group. She later was introduced by a friend to producing duo The Neptunes, who helped her sign with Virgin Records and would become her eventual collaborators.

Among the three artists in the rate, Kelis probably sticks out as having her own unique career trajectory. Whereas Aaliyah and Brandy started off as teen R&B singers who eventually pursued a more experimental sound, Kelis has always been a left-field artist from the beginning. Her 1998 debut album, Kaleidoscope, provided an eclectic mix of genres from disco to jazz, and combined it with an upfront songwriting and vibrant personality that has become definitive of her music. Her second studio album, Wanderland (2001), continues to build on the template set by her debut and even dabbles into mere genres like rap and rock. Unfortunately, it did not match the success of its predecessor and suffered from setbacks caused by her own label, which led to Kelis leaving Virgin Records. 

For her third album, Kelis has signed with Arista Records. Alongside The Neptunes, Kelis has enlisted a variety of collaborators, such as Rafael Saadiq, Dallas Austin, Andre 3000 and then-boyfriend-turned-husband Nas, among others, to create an album that is relatively commercial to her prior output, but one that does not sacrifice the quirks of her artistic identity. The songs on Tasty come in various flavors:  from the reggae of Trick Me to the rock tinges of Keep It Down, the more hip hop-influenced Millionaire and the throwback soul of Glow, and the various shades of funk and R&B that color the album. The diverse set of sounds are tied by her raunchy lyrics and versatile delivery, ensuring listeners that they are in for a treat.

Critics have responded to Tasty positively, with many praising the album's production and Kelis' unique personality. The album was promoted with four singles, with its lead single and biggest hit, “Milkshake”, gaining her a Grammy nomination and become an enduring pop culture staple.

The bonus rate is 100% optional, but if you enjoyed the main rate, I'd personally recommend keeping the bop train going and try out the bonus rate!


#**The Rules**
- You must listen to every single song and assign them a score from 1 to 10, 10 being the most positive score you can give. **Ballots with scores missing won’t be accepted.**

- You may use up to one decimal spot in your scores, meaning that you can give a song a **7.8** or a **6.9**, but not a **8.472** or a **6.65**. If you do use decimals, remember to use a dot ( . ) and not a comma ( , ).

- You have the option to give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11) **across the entire rate**. These should be reserved for your least favorite and favorite track. Songs in the bonus rate can't be given these scores.
