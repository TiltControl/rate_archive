https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ccsc8v/2015_ultimate_alt_pop_rate_reveal_day_2_music_to/

Hey everyone! Welcome to Day 2 of the 2015 Ultimate Alt Pop Rate Reveal, the rate involving Lana Del Rey's Honeymoon, Marina's FROOT, and Florence + The Machine's How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful.

First of all, thank you to rokin for taking over yesterday when I had something urgent come up. Also a big thank you to Blackpink's Jennie for [promoting our rate yesterday](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0tjjhHmCB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and thank you to her again for [promoting the rate today!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz3IzsqHXwn/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Today we will be revealing the next 14 songs of the main rate (24-11) and the next 6 of the bonus rate (12-7). The reveal will start 1 hour after the making of this post, which means it'll start at **3PM EST**, and will take place on [**https://plug.dj/popheads**](https://plug.dj/popheads)**.** My lovely co-host /u/Therokinrolla will be running the reveal over at plug while I'll be making the posts over here on reddit.

 **therokinrolla** (10): INcredible, showstopping, never been done before...

**1998tweety** (10): Orange is a queen, having one on its own is great, but the orange flavored products are amazing too. Consistently among my favourites.

---
 
**didney-worl** (10): great juice
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m from Orange County, California! Represent!
 
**hikkaru** (10): me eating an entire box of mandarin oranges when they're in season: it's fruit it's healthy i won't gain weight

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): the other girls want what she has tbh...

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Actually y'all posted about Halsey repeatedly, and I let it go, but at a certain point it was like 'This again?'
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Fairly good, through hard to eat sometimes. Opt for seedless.
 
**frogaranaman** (8): yah
 
**vhqv1997** (8): You buy me orange juice
 
**nick1372** (7): For some reason it's way too hard to tell whether your orange will be amazing or taste like paper and honestly? that's homophobia
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7): Also overrated.
 
**nickl00** (6): I like orange flavored stuff
 
**waluigiest** (6): wishes she was lemon

**therokinrolla** (10): Ah, this song is what Love + Fear should've been: simple, and well written. It feels tentatively nostalgiac, but unabashedly understanding of the harm that nostalgia has, the power that that has. This is potetially the closest thing to pure pop on this album, Marina's melodies are more than on point here, especially on the random but effective bridges interspersed throughout this cut. However, I must draw attention to one of Marina's clumsiest lyrics. That line about the tipping scale makes sense, but it also adds nothing to the song other than in and of itself being a metaphor. It draws me out of the song everytime. Guess I wish i could forget that one, eh?????

**1998tweety** (8.5): This song has a lot of elements that I like, (most) of the lyrics, the production, and of course Marina's vocals, but it also has things I don't like; the chorus is a little too repetitive, and I feel like it takes a bit too much away from the song. As we've come to expect from Marina, the bridge is stellar (as well as the outro). Those bits bring the song back up from it, it helps that they're the last impression you get from the track.
 
---
 
**Leixander** (10): WHEN I WAS BORN TO BE THE TORTOISE, I WAS BORN TO WALK ALONE
 
**leviswift13** (10): "i've been dancing with the devil, i love how he pretends to care" is the second best moment of her career, bested only by how she pronounces *tortoise*
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): this is pop rock PERFECTION
 
**spadesluke** (10): People like to hate on the repetitive chorus, but I've never really been bothered by it. I think the repetition kinda exemplifies the angry feeling you get when you're trying your hardest to get over someone but just can't stop thinking about them. The production is also some of the best on this album, I think
 
**vhqv1997** (10): this song makes literally the same point as every other self-help book out there but marina writes and delivers the lines so intimately and emotionally it elevates the track into greatness and an absolute anthem
 
**chihuahuazero** (9): Somehow the pop rock works here.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): The hook really sounds 80s-inspired and that’s why I love it.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.5): This song might have some of the catchiest melodies on the album.  The only thing I can subtract points for is the repeated “forget” as the chorus.  After the verses it kind of feels like a letdown.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Another very upbeat song from Marina with a fully sonically spread out chorus that I didn’t quite expect to here; it makes sense for a song as unusually anti-Marina as Forget to come right after the 80s throwback bop that is Blue, and I am fully comfortable in calling both songs equally good. Can I use this filler space to project my anxieties that everybody I love will forget me in the future? Really? Thanks!
 
**FireLordAegon** (8): Catchiest song on the album by far.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): she really did pronounce secure as "securr"...aside from that, it's fine
 
**rickdave16** (8): this is where the album starts to dip for me but I still love this song
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): very mid-2000s pop rock
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (7): I like the sentiment but I think this song is sort of basic, kind of bored by it.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Forgettable
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): forgot this song existed
 
**Solovrinne** (6): I like the message of "shit happens, go on" but the track itself doesn't spark anything in me sonically.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Chick-Fil-A
 
**waluigiest** (6): chorus is good but the rest is forgettable
 
**radiofan15** (5.8): Quite a bland chorus TBH but not everyone can be a winner. Forgettable would be an appropriate description.
 
**nick1372** (5): Boring chorus takes down an otherwise promising track
 
**frogaranaman** (4): durian
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I don’t get what she’s trying to do here? My biggest problem with Marina is a lot of the time I can tell she puts a lot of effort into the lyrics of her songs but then they just kind of sound like mush.
 
**nickl00** (4): I honestly don't remember ever hearing his song
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (0): forget is exactly what i'd like to do with this song

**therokinrolla** (8): This song is a work of poetry and tender melodies, and little else. Luckily, it doesn't need to be much else. It has a simplicity that very few pre-High As Hope Florence songs have, and I love it for that. 

**1998tweety** (9): This is how you create an atmosphere and mood. The lyrics don't get me that hard, but when you combine them with the vocals and that airy production, the whole song comes together as something amazing.

---
 
**leviswift13** (11): it is hard for me to put into words how much i love this song. it is quiet, subtle, plaintive, reserved, calm and precise. the lyrics unravel like poetry straight from the depths of her soul. the oboe in the background is moving and bittersweet, and the way it twists around florence's falsetto in the bridge is what sad movies are made of. this song is about pain, loss, regret, love, carthasis, faults and moving on. it has carried me through so much, and i will forever be so grateful to florence (and st. jude) for that.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the chills this gave me when she dropped it as a prerelease track... i still get them
 
**MrSwearword** (10): weird and invokes some religious characters. Slay.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Pure, meditative loveliness - a prayer put to music.  This album has a really clear, beautiful arc to it, and it’s ending strong as hell.  The lyrics and the vocals are perfect, needless to say.  But the production is also top-notch.  There are so many little details here that reward repeated listens: the drums at the beginning that bring to mind crashing waves, which then disappear and reappear as the song builds; the woodwind-like synth line (or is that an actual clarinet?) that melds in perfectly with the “Saint Jude” vocal refrain; the other drum line that comes in near the end and sounds like a heartbeat and forms this kind of drum duet with the crashing waves…
 
**vhqv1997** (10): This song deserves day 3 and you all know it. DO NOT slander it just because it's a ballad, God knows we have way worse ballads in this rate on the other albums.
 
**spadesluke** (9.2): Another song that while I personally don't enjoy listening to it on its own, within the album it helps build the atmosphere. I also really like the melodies Florence chose.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): Fantastic ballad, the production feels pretty different from the rest of the album.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): This track never gets the recognition it deserves
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): Absolutely gorgeous, amazing quote moment before the end of the standard edition of the album.
 
**radiofan15** (8.5): Lovely and atmospheric… she really can take you to some places!
 
**nick1372** (8): Donate to St Jude's Children's Hospital today!
 
**nooodisaster** (8): "maybe i've always been more comfortable in chaos" ;_;
 
**waluigiest** (8): this hits me like a string quartet
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): NA NA NA NA NA NA. NA NA NA NA, HEY JUDE! Okay, I was originally just going to paste that over and over again, but I’m trying to control the amount of joke comments that I have in this rate. Anyway, I’d consider St. Jude to be the best soft song from this album! It’s still not as pronounced as I thought it would be, which is a darn shame, but Florence’s soft meditations on chaos, calm and lost causes here are very much worth listening to.
 
**rickdave16** (7.5): cute but nothing special
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): queen of rhyming words
 
**Solovrinne** (7.5): Part of the instrumental reminds me of a heartbeat which I really like in the context of what the song is about.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Gigloqic](http://www.identifont.com/samples/itc/Noovo.gif)
 
**FireLordAegon** (5.5): Oboe
 
**frogaranaman** (5): thinkin of those ads on tv
 
**nickl00** (5): too slow for her
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This was one of my most listened to songs in this rate because I kept trying to figure out what was up with it. Like, my mind just slides off this song like it’s behind a sheet of glass. I’m just gonna give it a bad score because it just kind of gets drowned in that droning background noise and ends up feeling a bit like an interlude.
 
**Leixander** (3): I like the lyrics but the execution is a huge miss for me.

**therokinrolla** (8.5)

**1998tweety** (8.5): I don't know why but I find the line "the guillotine hums" to be so powerful and gorgeous. It has that random metaphor aspect that Florence's songs often have, but there's something special about this one. Love the kick the chorus has, yeah it might not sound as gorgeous as some of the slower HBHBHB songs, but it bops so it gets points for that.
 
---
 
**iamjezzac** (10): deserved to be a single
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Oh, that opening melodic line is super interesting.  And those lyrics are a tour de force.  Same question as Hiding: how the hell was this relegated to a bonus track?  (I will say that this feels like it could’ve easily been on Lungs, so maybe it was cut for feeling like the sound didn’t fit the album or something.)
 
**radiofan15** (9.3): I love when her insane vocals aren't everything needed to carry a song because the song is strong enough to hold on its own.
 
**leviswift13** (9): i love me such witchy, fairytale, dark florence
 
**nick1372** (9): Beautiful imagery
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): The chorus goes tf offfffff
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Extra points for being the singular song on this entire album that uses the harp
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Once again I have absolutely no clue what Florence is trying to say here but the word choice and her energy are really good so I’ll just give it a good score.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): I honestly think this track is a stronger closer than Mother
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Argonaut](http://www.clockprints.com/display/font_de_04.jpg)
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): I wish I could make up my mind about this song. I can’t make up my mind about it because...I cannot...remember...anything...about how it went. To be fair, I did score this album while listening to it for the last time, so I do trust my score for this, but maybe this is a testament to how How Big, How Bright, How Beautiful is too a little cohesive at times, despite being enjoyable all throughout. Switch it up, Florence!
 
**rickdave16** (7.5): again cute little bop but definitely a bonus
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): it's very bonus track-y
 
**MrSwearword** (7): it's more upbeat but meh
 
**nickl00** (7): great chorus
 
**chihuahuazero** (6): Lana and Florence will stan the guillotine together.
 
**Solovrinne** (6): It just kind of seems like an inferior version of Hiding.
 
**waluigiest** (6): kind of nondescript to me
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (5): Too long and doesn't feel distinct at all. Like if a machine had to make a Florence song, it would be this.
 
**frogaranaman** (4): I have made up my mind that this sounds like a generic Florence song

**therokinrolla** (9): Good but basic.

**1998tweety** (9): Apples are pretty standard, something tells me that along with Orange, they're the most common fruit. A classic snack, a title it deserves, apple juice is great too.

---
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I basically live off of apples, I eat them all the time. Literally an eighth of my diet is probably applesauce.
 
**nickl00** (10): amazing fruit
 
**radiofan15** (9): Edward Cullen's favorite fruit!
 
**Raykel** (9): Only red delicious apples are a 10 so had to bring it down a bit when including other apples
 
**Solovrinne** (9): Good at developing phones.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): Overall good. Honeycrisp are the best, and Granny Smith are god tier baking apples. Red Delicious can choke, though.
 
**Leixander** (8.5): hard to eat and always leaves a stinging feeling on your throat. tastes awesome however
 
**frogaranaman** (7): peanut butter with it makes me :weary:
 
**nick1372** (7): A solid staple. Good with nut butter but otherwise not generally worth eating when there's other options
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7): Overrated.
 
**nooodisaster** (6): Delicious but I prefer them cut up but then am too lazy to cut them up... it's a problem.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (5): Honestly? Overrated. If it's not honeycrisp I don't want it.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): boring
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): overrated and make me burp
 
**yourhostandpatron** (3): Awful. The only reason why this isn't a 1 is because of the health benefits and the interesting fact that the Old English word apple stems from used to mean any kind of fruit, which is the reason why Adam and Eve are often pictured eating an apple even if no particular fruit is mentioned in the Bible. But, seriously, apples are really fucking bland and just clones of pears. No thank you.
 
**vhqv1997** (2): overpriced and overrated, samsung outskinnied
 
**waluigiest** (2): overrated and huge flop potential

**therokinrolla** (10): Florence always has a strong sense of visual thematics, so this song sonically can be described as a storm very well. The verses feel like tremors, and gentle but fast winds warning of more to come. And in the chorus, everyrhing arrives, displacing the Earth and wreaking havoc. I feel like, more than anything, its a song about feeling totally out of place, like your connection to this world and what is most important to you has been destroyed. It's just breathtaking. 

**1998tweety** (9): A gorgeous song, I'm sure I've said it a lot by now but Florence is a master at setting a mood and delivering all the way on it. Listening to this I feel like I'm on a ship lost at sea, I'm the lone survivor after last night's storm and there's fog all around me and I can't see anything. Desperately praying to find land since I don't know how long I can survive out here on me own. Ugh she really took me there huh 

---
 
**Leixander** (11): I thought way too much about choosing my 11, but this rightfully deserves it. Beautifully executed ballad that ends in the most satisfying way.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (11): Coming into this rate, the only album I had ever listened to all the way through was Froot, which I adored wholeheartedly and thought would come out as the winner for me, hands down.  I “knew” that Happy was going to be my 11 and never considered that I might change my mind. But so far this album is fucking TESTING me.  This song… man, this song, holy shit.  This song broke me.  When she sang “if you could just forgive yourself”… full. body. chills.  Best song in the whole rate, easily, so I guess it gets my 11.
 
**leviswift13** (10): some of the greatest lyrics i've ever heard. i can't listen to this song too much bc it just feels so raw, like an open flesh wound. this woman can do no wrong!!
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): i think this is my absolute favorite song… but my eleven shall go to something more strategic
 
**Solovrinne** (10): The buildup is incredible and powerful, I always come back to this one.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): Absolutely hypnotic.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): This song is definitely the sparsest Florence song on the album, which is good, because for once we can listen to Flo's voice in all of its unadulterated glory and appreciate her genius level of lyricism
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): hold on to your heeAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): The electric guitars throughout are so eerie and beautiful.
 
**spadesluke** (9.4): This isn't a song that I listen to on my own quite as much due to its slower nature, but within the context of the album it's an excellent performance by Florence, slowing down the pace of the album to deal with the aftermath of the energetic and hectic songs before it. I also really love the "SHUT" and the final chorus where she shouts out "SING IT OUT LOUD, WHO MADE US THIS WAY" to intensify the emotions she's expressing throughout this song.
 
**rickdave16** (9): goddamn THIS ALBUM
 
**skargardin** (9): i mean wig fucking flew
 
**nickl00** (8): I'm giving this an purely for how she sings flowers
 
**waluigiest** (8): this song really does sound like a storm
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Do you know that Saint Christopher, the patron saint of thunderstorms, is technically no longer an official saint due to the Catholic Church doubting that he ever existed? That’s a bit of the shame for all the poor Christophers out there. But, seriously, this album has so many song titles that can function as names for books! This one is a gem among them, even if it’s a little too subdued for me. Thank you, Florence.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): takes a while to get going tbh
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): emotional
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (7): Strong ballad, a strong first softer moment in the album.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Often in this rate I found myself going “I have no clue what this song is about” even after looking up the lyrics and so it just comes down to the sound of the song to determine my score for it and this was… okay.
 
**nick1372** (7): Only she would name a song like this. It's got a bunch of clever lines
 
**iamjezzac** (6): the weakest of the slower songs
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Display Art Three](http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/gallo/2010/gallo_art_nouveau.gif)
 
**slimboyfriend** (5.5): how u gonna follow up queen of peace with filler
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): I expected it to get bigger and it just never exploded in the way that I wish it would.
 
**MrSwearword** (5): more bored than offended
 
**frogaranaman** (4): am I listening to Lana
 
**radiofan15** (3.5): These kind of songs survive due to the atmosphere they create and how potent is the voice singing it… unfortunately the atmosphere isn't there yet and the voice isn't enough to compensate for it.

**therokinrolla** (8): I love this a lot. It's so upbeat, and cutesy. It feels like it comes from a world where Florence + the Machine never progressed past lungs, and just kept making Lungs 2.0 then 3.0 then 4.0. Which would of course be bad, but this feels like an upper level cut. Its perhaps not the most poetic and visual of Florence's songs, but it is one of the catchiest, which is enougb for me.

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's cute. I don't have much else to say besides that. It bops a bit more than most of her songs but I don't exactly find the chorus that catchy. The lyrics are also weaker than her usual stuff, but I appreciate the diversity.

---
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (11): I absolutely adore this song for a reason other people would likely consider it to be out of place on an album like HBHBHB. It serves as a perfect stress-relieving tune concluding what was a very emotionally exhausting and mentally intensive record. The message behind it is also by far the most wholesome thing in this otherwise moodily introspective rate.
 
**Solovrinne** (10): This is actually incredible, it's a bop and a half. Shame it's only on the deluxe edition.
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): Boppity BOP.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.5): How the hell was this relegated to a bonus track?
 
**spadesluke** (9.5): I love the melody of the... I don't actually know what instrument it is that's echoing throughout this song, but I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): a pop BANGER that sounds timeless while also being a throwback
 
**leviswift13** (9): this sounds like a lost song from fleetwood mac's heyday during the 70s
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): love the cute intro
 
**MrSwearword** (8): I can at least sense what this song's trying to do.
 
**nick1372** (8): How is she so good at songs where she talks right to you
 
**waluigiest** (8): fun. We support these harmonies and the tambourine
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Tupac Amaru Shakur (/ˈtuːpɑːk ʃəˈkʊər/ TOO-pahk shə-KOOR; born Lesane Parish Crooks, June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper, writer, and actor.[2][3] He is considered by many to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.[4][5] Much of Shakur's work has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of resistance and activism against inequality.[6] Shakur was shot four times by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later and the gunman was never captured. Multiple conspiracies have arisen over Shakur’s supposed death.
- 
**rickdave16** (7): cute little bop but I can tell that this is a bonus track
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Monogram](http://i0.wp.com/previews.123rf.com/images/pgmart/pgmart1411/pgmart141100086/34098216-vintage-art-nouveau-font-for-your-monogram-and-logo-lineart-.jpg?strip=all)
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Inoffensive.
 
**nickl00** (6): one of the more interesting production choices
 
**frogaranaman** (5): me until I came out
- 
**cubascastrodistrict** (4): The chorus really just didn't impact me at all, not a big fan of this one. I think the production doesn't add to the song at all. I get why this wasn't on the original album.

**1998tweety** (8): I like the energy this word has, an insult that has been reclaimed.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJNYaC_jlyk&frags=pl%2Cwn
 
**radiofan15** (10): That time in which Ariana complained about how everyone attacked her but she kept pushing everyone's nerves with her constant stupidity ("*I'm gonna inject myself in a feud I have nothing to do with just to do some promo and cry 'can I have one day off please?' when the backlash ensues*") and buffoonery can relate.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Me
 
**vhqv1997** (10): my attitude
 
**yourhostandpatron** (10): Why, thank you! By the way if you are a man please be careful of how you use this word even if you are gay thanks

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Lots of better adjectives to describe the same mood
 
**waluigiest** (3): keep this word out of your white gay mouth
 
**hikkaru** (1): the word "bitch"? amazing. "bitchy" on the other hand just makes me think of the gays that live by this word in their daily interactions with people and think it is a suitable replacement for a personality or that it makes them funny or something
 
**nooodisaster** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzGZamtlRP0

**therokinrolla** (9): The hook of this song is so gobsmackingly fun that I can forgive most of its other problems, paramount of which that most of the other sections of the song are somewhat forgettable. I love the outro tho, Which Witch Bitch another one in the basket ugh PERIODT

**1998tweety** (8): I get that this is a demo so I wasn't that harsh cause the song does bop quite hard. I really wish this was cleaned up and released cause it would bop so hard. Love trumpets on songs as always. Fix the post-chorus and that empty bit of just instrumental, and I could easily see this moving up to a 9 for me.

---
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): This doesn’t fit into the album’s concept. Still, something something should’ve been on the standard edition.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): WHERE IS THE ALBUM OF THESE WITCHY BANGERS THAT WAS APPARENTLY SCRAPPED?
 
**FireLordAegon** (10): Lana is burning at the stake. Azaelia Banks is watching in envy.
 
**leviswift13** (10): the bonus track to end all bonus tracks. i'm still holding out for the witch trial concept album if only bc which witch needs to be heard by everyone. literally one of her best songs.
 
**nooodisaster** (10): *slut drops in Ceremonial*
 
**rickdave16** (10): can't BELIEVE this is just a bonus track AND just a demo
 
**Solovrinne** (10): I don't know this is a demo because this is certainly an enthralling song. Love it.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): This is a song that could very, very easily veer into the realm of the cheesy, with the lyrics and the “menacing” instrumentation… but holy hell, is it ever executed perfectly.  The trumpets? That Gregorian-chant-esque vocal line at the end?  The unbridled emotional frenzy?  Gotta admit I was really tempted to give this my 11.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): Where is the witch-themed album, Flo???
 
**radiofan15** (9.8): How is the second best song on the album just a demo and a bonus track? the disrespect!
 
**Leixander** (9): noone expected the florence inquisition
 
**spadesluke** (8.3): I know a lot of people who hardcore stan this song, but it's not my favorite on the album. While I absolutely love the instrumentation throughout parts of this song, I don't especially enjoy Florence's performance throughout this song. Like, of course it's good because it's Florence Welch, but by her standards it's subpar in my opinion.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (8): I really enjoyed this track, it builds really nicely and has a lot of emotional power.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): the demo does show promise...cute...
 
**nickl00** (8): I really wish this made it
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): I can see why this is a demo lol, but it still bangs
 
**waluigiest** (8): should I make a Which Wich joke or a Kate Bush joke?
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Some people name this as one of their favourite Florence songs, but in my opinion (I am warning you very strictly not to kill me for this) this is a song that’s held back by the fact that it’s literally a demo. Although it does indeed have very interesting elements and switches within it, those switches would have been all the more fantastic with complete production. For now? It’s cute, but it needs to be developed.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Girl this is a demo? I couldn’t tell it apart from the songs on the album.
 
**iamjezzac** (7): a bit unfocused and doesn’t really fit the rest of the album but certainly has potential
 
**nick1372** (7): This one feels a lot more wild, unrestrained and angry than a lot of her work. The prechorus is definitely the highlight.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Swaak Centennial](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/e5/20/2ee5203237bf0403464ce008922efcfa.gif)
 
**frogaranaman** (5): I understand why this stayed as a demo
 
**gannade** (2): this sounds like the demo version of Breath of Life... which is a choice

**therokinrolla** (9): There is no better way to start this record. In a sea of slow and trancendent songs, this one is somehow the most lethargic. Every syllable on this track is so drawn out for wildly extended periods of time, it could almost be comical. This song, however, centers itself around Lana's voice. The two records before this were much more production focused, especially Born To Die. But there's a lack of space in this song production wise, and all that space is filled up with the powerful highs and grounding lows of her voice. The chorus is arguably nothing and arguably like Ship To Wreck's, one of my least favorite songs in this rate: it forgoes melodic purpose, is very repetitive, and relies on the singers voice above anything else. And while Ship To Wreck flounders because nothing seems to work together, Lana's soft and colorful tone feels like a delightful whisper. She's telling us what's coming in this album, and it works flawlessly.

**1998tweety** (7.5): I feel bad for giving Lana so low of a score, but on its own this song doesn't do it for me. It is a very strong intro to the album and does a very very good job setting the scene and atmosphere, but when I look at it on its own, it loses some points. It has grown on me since my first listen though, so maybe it will continue to do so.

---
 
**akanewasright** (10): I remember when she released this track on her YouTube channel. The song was absolutely orgasmic then, and I think it still is. This album in general was me learning how to love slow burn songs, and this song was a wonderful way to start that process.
 
**didney-worl** (10): just gorgeous
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Great song! This is so soothing, it’s one of those quintessentially “Lana” songs that takes you to a different place. In this case it’s a beach, but like, the kind that people lounge on.
 
**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): My first listen to this is unforgettable as it immerses you into a sweet, dreamy, almost heavenly atmosphere, like how you would feel if you were high. In any other rate this would've gotten an 11
 
**Misentro** (10): If I second 11 to give, it would be here. Possibly her best song to date. Sinister old Hollywood honey magic.
 
**radiofan15** (10): The atmosphere! The cinematic strings straight out of a Hitchcock movie! The vocals! THIS BITCH did her homework!
 
**rickdave16** (10): perfect opening track, one of my favorite Lana songs ever
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): A beautiful, haunting intro that originally I didn’t like, but now absolutely adore.
 
**waluigiest** (10): YALL the opening strings, the harmonies, the orchestration, the tender vocals. She delivered on this track this album is big time blessed
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): a lot of you dumbass twinks talk about things being cinematic but this is actually a time that something truly is in fact... cinematic
 
**CarlieScion** (9): the instrumental in this is just plain beautiful
 
**iamjezzac** (9): somnambulant but evocative
 
**nick1372** (9): Oh god it's so long but it's so good
 
**skargardin** (9): It sets the old hollywood mood perfectly, even if it admittedly drags a bit towards the end
 
**Solovrinne** (9): Typical Lana to start off the album with a long track that takes you into another world.
 
**Leixander** (8.5): A really good song that falls into the curse of being over a certain minute mark, her delivery in this is amazing. I usually skip it to start my listen from Music To Watch Boys To when I am not in the mood for it. Last one minute is perfection nonetheless.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (8): Very close to a nine for me, but I think the build is just a little too slow. Also, I really feel like this song shouldn't be the opener, for me it's a perfect midpoint song.
 
**leviswift13** (8): orchestral goth love realness, the final moments are among the best in her whole career
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8): First impression: ridiculously pretty snoozefest.  With each subsequent listen, though, I’ve grown less bored and more enchanted - I appreciate the dark, jumpy cello (?) sawing that’s buried below most of the verses like a hidden menace, and those gorgeous burst-of-sunshine-after-a-storm major chords that come in on the lines “we could cruise” and “there are violets in your eyes”.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): Lana do a James Bond theme challenge
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Girl Reading Palm"](https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/b2a/285924.jpeg)
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Aside from resembling literature enough, Honeymoon can also be very...cinematic at times, and the title track is the best example of that. It’s slow and full of space, but it’s very easy to visualize scenes of Lana’s very own privately funded sugar daddy honeymoon when she sings this, and even if I am not...a very visual person, more or less, I still appreciate this song for what it tries to do and how well it must appeal to people who actually get the beauty of film. Does this have a music video? I sure hope it does.
 
**spadesluke** (7.2): A decent start to the album, showcasing the themes that will be present throughout the album of romance, sadness, and fantasy. Not that any of those are at all unexpected with Lana
 
**MrSwearword** (7): an admittedly weird way to open an album even by LDR standards. Still, it's very on brand for her.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): A weak opening track compared to the rest of the album
 
**vhqv1997** (7): This song takes way too long to get going, I know that it's supposed to be a slow cinematic opening delicately revealing the rest of the album, but it could definitely have been cut down to like 3 minutes and a half
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): okay first of all this bitch has never been married.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): at least her voice is pretty
 
**nickl00** (6): it's like she was trying to parody the people who say she's to slow but then made it sound good.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i'm so bored why is this 6 minutes long
 
**frogaranaman** (4): feels like something a girl who started music by covering riptide would make

**therokinrolla** (8.5): Marina Marina Marina. The perfect Marina-ism is perfect through being decidedly unperfect and unignorably flawed, yet so capable and confident in excecution, which therein not only makes a point, but makes it stronger than it would've be otherwise made WERE it perfect. Does that make sense? Not really, but if Marina ever made sense she'd be a much less interesting character and artist. Maybe let's say it like this: Marina rarely feels like she's trying to hard, even though the lyrics itself can SCREAM tryhard. It's just a part of what Marina is: excessively, confidently, effortlessly awkward. When she puts out such an on the nose song, something should turn us off. If anyone else released this I feel like we'd consider it strangely put together or flawed in excecution. But its Marina, so it works beauitfully. Idk why, dont ask me. You know I'm right though.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Savages standouts from the rest of the album due to its subject matter. Lines like "I’m not afraid of God, I am afraid of man", pack so much emotion and power in just a few words. Again we see a little bit more that rock-style production, imo it fits Marina so much better than her previous electropop songs. The message on this track is strong and direct-- there's no way to miss it or misinterpret it. With a message like this, those attributes are essential since you really want your words to get across exactly how you intended them to.

---
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song's existence makes Marina's recent attempts at being woke look that much more pathetic.
 
**leviswift13** (10): are you killing for yourself or killing for your savior? that's it. that's the tweet.
 
**skargardin** (10): insert To Be Human wishes comment here
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): What can I say about this song?  I guess I can admit that I find the lyrics “we laugh, we cry / like babies in the night / forever running wild / in the human race” to be a bit clunky, and I also wish the “aah”s at the end were a bit more forward in the mix, but those are really the only faults I can find.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): bop bop bop bop
 
**vhqv1997** (10): This song was truly that... savage... we love an anthropologic activist queen
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): that outro... wig
 
**iamjezzac** (9): I will never be able to listen to this gem without thinking about that old man dancing at a festival
 
**Solovrinne** (9): One of her songs that reminds me how much I love her voice.
 
**thegeecyproject** (9): WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): ‘Savages’ is kind of a problematic word to use in today’s sensitive world, and a part of me thinks that this is just a more human-oriented version of Him by Lily Allen, but even if the statement here isn’t anything new...Marina does make a couple of pretty amazing points here! This is the part where she prepares to leave and decides to snap, and it’s a very good set of closing words for our favourite Welsh lady to go out on.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Points were made, I don’t necessarily agree with them but then I’m not sure that she does either, which makes the track all the more interesting. Her lyricism is weird here, she has some good lines in there but some of the rhymes and imagery feel really basic.
 
**nick1372** (8): An excellent, thoughtful song that has absolutely no place on an album like this.
 
**nickl00** (8): one of the catchiest hooks
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): This is what Love + Fear could've been :pensive:
 
**spadesluke** (7.6): This has a very TFJ feel, which I like a lot, but with more modern Marina sociological writing. That said, the writing is a bit too edgy, in my opinion. I know she was just trying to vent about her feelings, not that she actually believes all of this, but putting a venting song on an album is not the tea sis.
 
**FireLordAegon** (7.5): It's a great song but Marina girl... Those lyrics are wayyy too on the nose.
 
**Leixander** (7.5): where's the lie
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Judy Hopps SNAPPED on this song
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Publix
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): Marina is a VERY "tell-y" songwriter, in that she literally spells out the message in nearly every song she writes. Contrast that with someone like Florence, who is so "show" with nearly all her lines imagery or metaphor. Imo the best songwriters mix mostly show punctuated with mic-drop tells. Pre-reputation Taylor was a master at this, as is Lorde rn. Basically this essay came out of NOWHERE but I wanted it to show up before the album reviews.
 
**rickdave16** (6.5): not a big fan of this one either
 
**waluigiest** (6): makes some points, but the word savage when applied to people makes me kind of uncomfortable
 
**radiofan15** (5.5): I like the bouncy beat but those lyrics are r/im14andthisisdeep material.
 
**MrSwearword** (5): boring mediocrity
 
**frogaranaman** (4): kiwi
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4): This song reminds me of something I'd find on Amanda Palmer's Theater is Evil. Actually, the entire vibe from the album was "Amanda Palmer, but not as good."
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (1): Preachy Marina is by far my least favorite Marina. This song says nothing new with the subtlety of an atomic bomb.

**therokinrolla** (8.5)

**1998tweety** (9): Y'all are gonna drag this for having a lackluster chorus, but the instrumentation on this is so gorgeous it honestly makes up for it. This feels like the song that matches the title of Honeymoon the best. I'm in a beautiful European country but I'm realizing that maybe my hasty marriage was a mistake. With that said though, I'm kind of surprised it made it this far and almost has an 8 avg. It certainly stands out a lot less than some of her Day 1 song, but maybe that's why y'all kept it in for so long.

**gannade** (11): soffffft ice creammmmmmm
 
**waluigiest** (11): I named my Lapras in Pokemon Leafgreen after this song
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): *lady gaga voice* im italian
 
**iamjezzac** (10): the bridge with the piano line is one of the most beautiful things Lana has recorded
 
**Leixander** (10): Well come on Lana, teleport us to Italy!
 
**MrSwearword** (10): *emits every gay vocal emission possible*
 
**rickdave16** (10): underrated and a top ten Lana song for me
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): lalalalala soft ice cream 😍
 
**treadwater11** (10): the bridge & outro alone make it a 10
 
**spadesluke** (9.5): I feel like this song swings around the Honeymoon location from France to Spain, which would be quite the expensive trip. But hey, Lana does an excellent job in continuing the atmosphere of longing for the romance of a honeymoon vacation
 
**nickl00** (9): I love the European influence on this song and the bridge does not disappoint
 
**skargardin** (9): This song has one of my favorite Lana choruses ever
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Walking To Church"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Walking_to_Church%2C_Norman_Rockwell.jpg)
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Vacation music, but make it sad
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): I was about to give this a low score for the weirdness of the lyrics, but... that’s what I love about this song! It’s a delight, and I love the chorus where she actually uses words.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): One of the best melodies on this album, I don’t even mind that she just stops saying words at a certain point.
 
**leviswift13** (8): this is what lorde meant when she talked about melodrama!! (also only lana can make lyrics about ice cream in such a *dramatic* song work)
 
**nick1372** (8): LOVE the production on this one
 
**radiofan15** (7.7): After a long day of work painting houses with the guys, and a delicious Spaghetti dinner with my amore mio and my picollos this song and some *Gotti* is all I need to be happy.
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): this song is weird as fuck, but i kinda stan?
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Lana’s not done with trying all the genres she can yet; in Salvatore, she tries her hands out with americana, doing a Lady Gaga in the process. I’m assuming Salvatore is an Italian name, which is why I’m surprised there’s no references towards the Mafia here; step up your game, Lana! Despite that, this song is pleasing in how whimsical it is, which makes Honeymoon gain back steam. I can’t take the lyric ‘soft ice cream’ seriously, though.
 
**Raykel** (7.3): Oh that intro is just gorgeous
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): a song that has a nice intro and just some nice vocals on the chorus but then she ends the chorus with "soft ice cream" and najkvnsdkjfvavfsd
 
**Solovrinne** (7): It's not pristine, but I always appreciated her vocals on this track.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7): The schtick is painfully artificial here, but the carousel-esque, moody instrumentals and soaring melodies are kind of working for me.  I’m not mad at it.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): I know many fans swear by this song but I never got the hype
 
**frogaranaman** (3): this song needs to be in Italian, like her style doesnt make any sense otherwise
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (2): God the lyrics here are so so so bad. "Soft ice cream". This really should not have made it on the album imo.

**therokinrolla** (9.5)

**1998tweety** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of the chorus on this (it's not really catchy and a lot of the time she's just making noises). The lyrics are nice but they're not a particular stand out among Marina's discog, I do like lyrics like "Cause you've been bitten once", though cause they loosely continue with the fruit metaphor from last song (but you kind of have to stretch). Overall it's not bad, but I would definitely rank it at the bottom of the album.

---
 
**rickdave16** (11): personal ANTHEM for my life this song means so much to me
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): me @ my body after i finish my third bag of doritos this week
 
**jexan13** (10): IMO Marina's best song
 
**leviswift13** (10): the emotion, the lyrics, the guitars, the burst of the chorus, the vocals
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of relatable titles
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): yeaEEaaEEah
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): It’s beautiful and also a mood tbh
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.5): I could do with the “yeah-ah-ah, a-hah, oo-hoo, yeah-ah”s, but apart from that, the aching vulnerability in her voice (especially in that first verse before the beat kicks in), the lyrics, the frosty instrumentals and powerful hooks… A+.
 
**waluigiest** (8): I used to not vibe with this one but it’s so honest and touching I just needed to mature first….. “babe I’m gonna ruin you if you let me stay”
 
**nickl00** (7): I only recently realized how amazing the chorus is
 
**nooodisaster** (7): interesting lyrically but production is booooring
 
**Solovrinne** (7): "I've been doing things I shouldn't do" well me too girl. A bop.
 
**radiofan15** (6.7): Relatable lyrics and catchy chorus… it's quite bland but at least I didn't hated it so that's a plus for me.
 
**FireLordAegon** (6.5): We need to work on that chorus, but the rest of the song is acceptable.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (6): I think the chorus is kind of clunky, not the biggest fan of this one.
 
**Leixander** (6): Never understood the fans' love for this song, but it is certainly not bad. A skip for me however.
 
**MrSwearword** (6): eh, it's just above mediocre
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Krispy Kreme
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6): I think this song is basically the only time where I think to myself ‘hey, I’m not enjoying this album so much anymore’. People usually think that the first side of Froot is better than the second, but for a third track I find this to be highly discouraging. It’s not a ruin, per se, but it does drag quite a bit, and I’m sorry, Marina, but as much as I love your accent, that is not the way to pronounce ‘ruin’. I’ll pass on this. Thanks.
 
**nick1372** (4): Kinda vague lyrics and the post-chorus vocalizing doesn't work
 
**frogaranaman** (3): tomato
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This song is noise and too long.
 
**Misentro** (0): Actively annoying.

**therokinrolla** (8.5): "I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change." Shit.

**1998tweety** (8): I have no idea why I seem to know this song considering it wasn't even a single, but I know for a fact that I've heard the chorus so many times before. I'm probably just hallucinating it and just heard the chorus once considering how repetitive it is. At least it bops. 

---
 
**nooodisaster** (11): "I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change." The highlight of this album, and this rate. Everything about this track is overflowing with energy, spilling from Florence's booming voice to the pounding beat to the constant hook after hook. The lyrics are achingly relatable. Change is something I'm constantly striving for, but it's something we humans are terrible at. When I listen to this song, I don't know if change feels any easier, but things don't feel as bad. In an album of storms, this is the eye. Florence sings "You deserve to be loved, and you deserve what you are given" with such conviction, who are we to argue?
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): it's WIDE open sis!
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): This has the same sonic energy as Ship To Break but the opposite emotional energy and I'm living for it.
 
**didney-worl** (10): sounds like Phil Collins, and I like that
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): and I can see it with my third EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYE
 
**Solovrinne** (10): Her vocals are so flawless in this song and THAT OUTRO.
 
**spadesluke** (10): introspection, accusation, acknowledgement, energy, Florence, what else could you possibly need?
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): A hopeful banger. Also those vocals are very impressive.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): The line "You deserve to be loved and you deserve what you are given" singlehandedly talked me out of contemplating suicide once. The song is kinda repetitive, I admit, but the powerful delivery of that one line is enough to push this song into greatness territory for me.
 
**chihuahuazero** (9): Searing.
 
**leviswift13** (9): this feels like an updated dog days, sung by someone who has faced and defeated her demons
 
**nick1372** (9): It's just Florence yelling at me that I deserve to be loved and I sincerely appreciate it
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Art Nouveau 1895](http://legionfonts.com/img-fonts/art-nouveau-1895/art-nouveau-1895-font-preview.jpg)
 
**Leixander** (8.5): Feels like a better version of Heartlines, which was sadly a cheesefest even though it bops.
 
**rickdave16** (8.5): THAT OUTRO gives me CHILLS
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.5): This is definitely a ray of light breaking through the turbulence and darkness of this album so far - it’s not cheerful, per se, but there’s an exuberance and optimism to it which makes it feel like an emotional resurrection.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): i dont know what an original lifeline is but this is great my poor laptop
 
**frogaranaman** (8): oh gosd.f oh fuck yes. Oh ufkcing ufuck yes give me this shit
 
**nickl00** (8): both this and the demo are so fun
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): kaitlyn herman's impact
 
**radiofan15** (7.3): She really knows how to create an atmosphere… unfortunately this one goes on for like way longer than it should.
 
**FireLordAegon** (7): Florence I can't afford to buy more contacts
 
**iamjezzac** (5): I am sorry but I seem to be the only one who can’t stand the “oooaaaaoooooaaaa” hook
 
**waluigiest** (5): not up to a whole lot
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): That “original lifeline” part is really annoying and the phrases she uses here really aren’t that great. These sound like scratch lyrics. This song just feels, like, thinner and shallower than the rest of the album.
 
**jexan13** (4): The demo is way way better than this one
 
**MrSwearword** (1): it's just really weak and annoying

**therokinrolla** (9): It's good, but the seeds in the middle of some varieties are a bit annoying.

**1998tweety** (3): Honestly I've never really liked the taste of cherries. I don't enjoy the actual fruit, and cherry flavored products are consistently at the bottom of my list. The Lana song is a bop though. 

---
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): Iconic, incredible, unbeatable
 
**didney-worl** (10): specifically for the Lana song
 
**FireLordAegon** (10): Rina Sawayama. That's it. That's the comment. Bet you thought I was gonna mention Lana.
 
**Leixander** (10): skinniest of fruits
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This score is the same as the Lana Del Rey song of the same name
 
**Solovrinne** (10): Lana Del Rey could never.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Cherry candy is underrated.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an immaculate snack
 
**vhqv1997** (10): My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme, and all of my peaches (are ruined, bitch)
 
**hikkaru** (9): stream rina sawayama
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): Iconic but there's a fucking rock in the center
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I would have given this a lower score because cherry isn’t a flavor I’m crazy about but just yesterday my friend was eating fresh cherries and they tasted really good so I bumped the score up. Also cherries in a Shirley Temple? Iconic.
 
**radiofan15** (7.7): Lana del Rey's eyes' favorite fruit!
 
**waluigiest** (7): cute in theory bad in practice
 
**skargardin** (6): overrated
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): Honestly an overrated fruit in all ways. Also the default for cough drops, which is bad.
 
**frogaranaman** (5): kinda slaps in certain situations
 
**nickl00** (5): never had one
 
**nooodisaster** (5): there's pits
 
**yourhostandpatron** (5): I usually put cherries in the token good fruits pile, but I had a friend named Cherry once and looking back most of her decisions were actually pretty fucking terrible so
 
**nick1372** (4): they're good but annoying to eat. also everything cherry flavored is TRASH and I will never eat any red artificially flavored food out of fear that it will taste like cough syrup
 
**Misentro** (1): Makes my throat close up. Truly all my cherries are ruined.

**therokinrolla** (7.5)

**1998tweety** (8.5): Ariana who? Florence said God is a woman FIRST. For real though, I enjoy the themes of equating God with your mom, and also relating that to the idea of Mother Nature. The chorus in particular is such a jam. Lyrically, the chorus remains me of some lines in If I Die Young by The Band Perry which is also a very very good song so go stream that and stream their new song The Good Life thank you.

---
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): This is my bread and butter, it just continued to evolve and get better and better as it went over its run time. I didn't want it to end, I just wanted it to continue to build and build until the universe collapsed on itself because it knew this was the pinnacle.
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): And Paul Epworth never collars with Florence again.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): why can't i also give this an 11 smh it's fantastic
 
**leviswift13** (10): the perfect way to end the album. if you do not headbang as hard as taylor swift during the 2014 grammys during the chorus, then you're doing something wrong.
 
**nick1372** (10): This song perfectly captures how annoying LA weather is when you're in a bad moon. Fuck the sun.
 
**nooodisaster** (10): woa.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): A fantastic closer! We don't claim the rest of the album
 
**vhqv1997** (10): This song was masterfully crafted. The ending is incredible and intense with her belting it out in accompaniment to the instruments, finally resulting in the climax signified by the cymbals. The best closer to an ablum I have ever seen.
 
**spadesluke** (9.5): A great closer to a great album. I always love when music incorporates a psychedelic influence, and I think that the chaos at the end of the song is an excellent closer to album centered around the chaos Florence is feeling in her relationship.
 
**iamjezzac** (9): the electric guitar... wow
 
**radiofan15** (9): The energy this song has!
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9): To me, Third Eye and St Jude together form the climax of the album and this is the epilogue: she’s come ashore and is ready to “belong to the ground” (or to the air, in becoming a “bird of prey” or a raincloud), leaving water behind as it “grants you no relief”.  Musically, I really dig the 70s-ish rock vibe here.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): The track goes HARD
 
**waluigiest** (9): mother by Kacey makes me want to cry, mother by Florence makes me want to fight!
 
**rickdave16** (8.5): queen of big tall trees
 
**frogaranaman** (8): yea wig okay
 
**Solovrinne** (8): The chorus and outro definitely make the song for me, otherwise the verses aren't really my cup of tea.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): That chorus is fantastic (if a bit expected for Florence) but the verses don’t excite me. It also just kind of turns into screaming and noise at the end but I’m not mad at it.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I do not like any songs named mother. I do not have a good relationship with my mother. ...okay, just joking. I’m not that scarred by my past! Haha, Mother is, well, Mother. It’s the fourth to the last song in an album that’s actually longer than it seems, even if said album is very good at times, and it’s alright. I was expecting a bit more pizzaz, but it’ll do.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (7): I love the end but I don't really like the build at the beginning and I think the electric guitar doesn't add anything until the last stretch.
 
**MrSwearword** (5): not trippy enough to justify the kind of track we end up getting which reads as more "music festival" but boring
 
**nickl00** (5): ehh
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Wallington](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS87HA0A1_vRmyA-UFyFK5Ti4QTOp6OMZ6gBPPD7qIwluJYiEFC)

**therokinrolla** (8.5): This is so fun honestly, its just fun. I wanna be a bad bitch, being high by the beach, while being annoyed with people that are obsessed with me. "The truth is I never bought into your BULLSHIT" is a revelation and its why I  stan. Good song.

**1998tweety** (9): Wow what a bop. HBTB being the lead single serving Taylor Swift every era. I loved that this song stands out so much from the rest of the album, even though it doesn't quite fit in as well with the other tracks. I'd probably say this is Lana's weakest lead single but that's only because the bar is so so high. I love this cause it makes me feel like a bad bitch (and both the intro and outro are so so good wow they're literally orgasmic).

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Beach Scene"](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BUMA74PVL._SY450_.jpg)
 
**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): "You could be a bad motherfucker but that don't make you a man." BDE at its finest
 
**MrSwearword** (10): mainly for the line "you could be a bad motherfucker, but that don't make you a man"
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): It could have been super cringey and lame, but it totally isn’t! Like Lana has really good flow on lines like “When you would pay tribute to me 'Cause I know that-" every syllable falls perfectly into place, which is what the best rap verses are aiming for. Plus “Lights, camera, acción” :heart_eyes:
 
**Solovrinne** (10): An actual bop from Lana. Queen of guns.
 
**waluigiest** (10): the writing here is unbelievable. I’ll just say that the triplets in the chorus turned me gay and leave it there
 
**FireLordAegon** (9.5): Could Marina or Florence get a top ten hit?
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): We love a song that peaked at #7 on the Billboard Charts!
 
**rickdave16** (9.5): a queer ANTHEM
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): This would have been my 11 if I didn’t see the light and realize what a masterpiece Froot is, so I’m going to have to write another long comment nobody except the hosts will read so I can appease her and avoid being cursed. Lana has hip hop and trap influences that are definitely underrated, and, yes, all you nobody Summer Bummer stans, this is pretty much the apex of that influence. I always associate this song with that gorgeous outfit Lana wears in its music video, and it’s just as gorgeous on its own: ‘you can be a bad motherfucker’, but that don’t make you a man? The feminism jumped out! I’m very sorry for doing this, Lana; you can shoot me out of a plane if you want to.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): Perfect trashy bop. "You could be a bad motherfucker, but that don't make you a man" is a killer line. Music video bangs.
 
**leviswift13** (9): i remember how excited i was when this first dropped! it really captures the muddy trap sound she was going for, and i love how it plays with her persona in ways that we hadn't seen before
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): When this single first debuted, I got fascinated by how Lana's persona was evolving. This was the first real sign that she was changing, ever subtly, from the man dependent trophy girl who didn't believe in feminism into something else. Here, she's still with the same no-good daddy, but displaying an emotion other than sadness, and a mode other than passive. "The truth is I never bought into your bullshit" is a huge declaration from a woman that, up until that point, made her career on it. Just two years later we'd see a more full evolution in "Lust for Life", and I'm so thankful she started that here.
 
**chihuahuazero** (8): Throwback to when somehow the Hot 100 reported this as selling way more records than it actually did, placing it into the Top 10 before correcting it. Stan the Rolling Stone chart.
 
**gannade** (8): this aged pretty badly
 
**iamjezzac** (8): excellent spiritual successor to Put Me In A Movie; if only the production on the chorus had been a little tighter
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): This song, a trap-infused cut, is definitely an outlier in this album full of baroque-jazz slow jams. I don’t come back to this often either.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): it's like a Born to Die song but if Born to Die didn't suck garbage ass
 
**akanewasright** (7.5): It physically pains me to give this anything lower than an 8, but I’m trying to have variance in my scores. This is a good song, but it’s just not her best. The video is an 11 though.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Lana Del Rey's getting high by the beach? Well I'm, praying to god by the beach.
 
**nickl00** (7): probably her worst lead single, but still pleasant
 
**Raykel** (7): The "the truth is I never bought into your bullshit when you would pay tribute to me cause I know that" melody reminds me of a veggietales song and idk which lmao
 
**CarlieScion** (6): kinda drags on
 
**Leixander** (6): Probably the most lackluster song in this album but the best choice for a single because of its catchy nature. The music video is iconic for me. You are #7 in my heart, forever and always, poor High By The Beach. #BoycottBillboard #HighByTheBeachDeserved7thSpotInHot100
 
**nick1372** (6): Cute. She just wants to get high by the beach and who can blame her.
 
**spadesluke** (5.6): I know this is everyone's favorite from the album, but honestly I feel like it's just Lana over a generic trap beat. It's not bad on its own, but I like the melancholy Parisian feel of the album, and I don't think that this fits that theme at all. If this was on Lust For Life or maybe even Ultraviolence there's a good chance I'd rate it a point or two higher, but alas, it's not.
 
**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like someone took a good trap song and tried to make it chill for people who say ‘yea I did weed once’
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): People really thought this would be a Top 10 hit? Why? It’s boring. I mean, that’s a bit harsh, it’s fine, but still.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (1): Well this is a comedown from God Knows I Tried.  I appreciate the lyrics in that second verse and that’s the only thing saving this song from getting my zero.  That chorus is a big WTF, sorry.  I hate the instrumental, I hate the pouty-child vocal stylings, the lyrical content is a big yawn… hard pass.

**therokinrolla** (8.5): Blassic, except for the ones that dry out your mouth.

**1998tweety** (10): Goat, grapes are great to have on their own, grape juice is good, grape flavored stuff are amazing too.
 
---
 
**Misentro** (10): The queen of snack fruit.
 
**skargardin** (10): werk
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Grapes are required for wine so I’d give them my 11 if I could.
 
**spadesluke** (10): We stan a wine legend
 
**waluigiest** (10): blessed fruit
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Good fruit! The fact that you eat it in little bits makes it more addictive and it really is an appetizing snack. Also, grape juice is incredibly delicious.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): One point docked for the odd too mushy grape.
 
**hikkaru** (9): green outsold red
 
**Leixander** (9): the perfect fruit in summer
 
**Raykel** (9): People who prefer green over purple ones are not to be trusted
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): It’s a cute enough fruit. Only the white ones though.
 
**frogaranaman** (8): classic. feed me like a roman emperor
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): iconic but all grape flavored stuff is trash
 
**nickl00** (8): I love then but they make me sick
 
**nooodisaster** (8): I fucks with them
 
**radiofan15** (8): No one's favorite fruit! But it's still nice.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): wildly different tastes depending on the kind. Tiny green grapes are just tart enough to be top tier. The rest are mid.
 
**vhqv1997** (8): Can anybody explain to me how the fuck did the "they did surgery on a grape" meme even take off?
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): gets a bit more points bc they made wine possible, otherwise not impressed
 
**nick1372** (6): They're fine
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): The only reason this isn’t a one is because I like white grapes.
 
**Solovrinne** (1): I remember when I was like five years old I was eating grapes sitting on the floor by the television. I dropped a grape and it rolled under the TV stand. I reached for it and when I pulled it out, it had a spider on it. 0/10 Was not pleased.

**therokinrolla** (10): That. Flute. That is all I have to say.

**1998tweety** (10): I'm so sad this barely missed the top 10. If I were to rank it among all of Lana's singles it would probably be towards the lower end but it still bops. Yes, this is what we Lana stans take as bops. This song is so good though. It has an amazing flute on it (sometimes you don't see that often unless the artist is Lizzo), and it's so atmospheric and sexy. I'm not gay but I would totally watch boys to this song.

---
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this song is like being outside in the summer relaxing in a kiddie pool while drinking margaritas
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): This song knows exactly what it is, and it pulls it off perfectly.
 
**FireLordAegon** (10): It's a great song to watch men fight for you and for sacrificing them in volcanoes.
 
**Leixander** (10): Quintessential Lana executed perfectly. Puts you in those late summer days mood where you can see the heat rising from the asphalt but you are strangely comfortable with it (which is a mood for all of Honeymoon honestly).
 
**leviswift13** (10): this song is such a forgotten bop, the camp the melody the attitude are to die for
 
**skargardin** (10): This has always been one of my personal Lana favorites, it’s so silky smooth
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): I admit, I’ve drifted apart from this song recently, but this was my favourite Lana song for a long while.
 
**radiofan15** (9.2): I don't know how many boys I'll be watching with this song as background music, but this is still a strong track so I'm not complaining.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This song was the one that got me hooked onto Honeymoon, but is also the one that got old the quickest.
 
**nickl00** (9): the chillest song I've ever heard
 
**vhqv1997** (9): National Anthem's long-lost sister
 
**waluigiest** (9): she knows who she is. This is SO lush I love it
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): There must always be at least one song on every one of Lana’s albums for desperate twinks to relate to, and Music To Watch Boys does a find job at that; it has a melody more easy to follow than the majority of Honeymoon’s slow, long output, and it’s the perfect soundtrack for doing exactly what the title describes.
 
**spadesluke** (8.9): I love the bridge to this song a lot, and it of course follows the Lana narrative we all love
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): A mid tempo BOP with a wonderful music video. Also: THAT BRIDGE!
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): i just look in the mirror for this one.
 
**rickdave16** (8.5): I like you a lot
 
**Solovrinne** (8.5): This song takes you by the hand from the first note.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.5): This is the definition of dark summer vibes.
 
**chihuahuazero** (8): The chorus is dreamy with a hidden energy within.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): it's a weak single but considering Honeymoon doesn't really have singles viability [like anything Lana released to date, let's be real, kii] this one is still fine for what it is.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Boy and Girl Gazing at Moon (Puppy Love)"](https://www.nrm.org/wp2016/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NR_Boy_Girl_Gazing_Moon_Puppy_Love_NRM.jpg)
 
**gannade** (7): Why did Lana make this her second single? Who knows
 
**nick1372** (6): Never really got the appeal of this one. Maybe referencing music in a song is just too cheesy for Lana to pull off
 
**williamdowley123** (6): closeted gay in high school mood
 
**CarlieScion** (5): im gay so i dont like boys therefore this song is bad
 
**frogaranaman** (5): all my lesbian friends listen to this
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Sometimes Lana’s “boy addled moll” schtick really works. And sometimes it’s just boring.
