In this scenario Lana is still Lana. Forgettable üçµ

**therokinrolla** (10): Fantastic. Great for flavor. LOVE them raw.

**1998tweety** (9): I would've given this a 10, but I guess I'm not that big of a fan of actual lemons. Lemonade and lemon products are great but I don't actually use the original fruit that much.

---
 
**FireLordAegon** (10): When life gives you lemons, release your magnum opus.
 
**hikkaru** (10): oh you know i'm a sour bitch! i love to just eat lemons on their own tbh
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): making it sour? king of changing the perception that all fruit is sweet!
 
**Solovrinne** (10): I haven't had a lemon in a long ass time but life gives me plenty.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (10): I will legit eat whole lemons. So good
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the most versatile of all these fruits... your fave wishes
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): She‚Äôs a juicy one.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): Wish it tasted on its own as good as it smells but the perfect addition to most things.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Did you know that you can peel a lemon and eat it like a tangerine? I‚Äôve done it, it‚Äôs not bad but I stopped because it probably wasn‚Äôt good for my teeth.
 
**waluigiest** (9): yah
 
**nickl00** (8): a necessity for unsweetened tea
 
**radiofan15** (7.9): Renee Zellweger's (and my boyfriend's) favorite fruit!
 
**nick1372** (7): idk why you would eat a lemon but lemon flavored things always slap
 
**nooodisaster** (7): Great for seasoning but kinda a pain to use; I always forget I buy them and then I have to throw them out.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Not good as its own fruit, obviously, but anything else to do with lemons ranges from okay to yummy. Also, is this going to win just because of Lemonade? Okay ladies now let's get in formation
 
**frogaranaman** (6): cave johnson
 
**leviswift13** (5): anyone who just eats lemons are psychos
 
**iamjezzac** (4): who eats a whole ass lemon?
 
**Raykel** (4): It's just used as an ingredient, who tf eats a whole ass lemon

**therokinrolla** (10): A 10, and for good, good reason. There's something that stands out about the song, of it being kinda happy in this album of downers. Her defeated optimism that remains with the loss she is singing about. Very few Lana songs seem fixated on the future, they're all very in the "now". TLY seems like its reaching, though, not just across time but through eras. Rarely do you listen to Lana for comfort but somehow its here, in spades. It's a brilliant track, and that bridge is simply one of the best ever written, through and through. robbed.

**1998tweety** (11): Wow. A literal masterpiece of a song. Every quality I love about a Lana song is present in this track, her gorgeous vocals, incredible lyrics, and of course that atmosphere she sets so effortlessly. Despite creating an atmospheric experience, Lana always has one moment in particular where everything eclipses and we reach the climax. Lana is a master at bridges, a section that can make or break a song; when I hear "I put the radio on" I feel like I'm being sent to another plane. The entire song Lana makes me feel like I'm in space slowly drifting away from Earth and I can't do anything but stare longingly at what I once had. I'm so pissed this went out so early, I thought it would at least make top 5, Lana get robbed even harder in this rate than she did in the L4L one. 
 
---
 
**akanewasright** (11): This was my favorite song on the album when I first listened to it, and it still holds up perfectly. I usually burn out my love of my favorite album tracks, but this one only gets better. I keep noticing small details, like the way the harmonies are done differently each time. And of course, the bridge is absolutely thrilling.
 
**KiwiKenJJJ** (11): so timeless and gets better on every listen
 
**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): What makes this an 11 is the jazzy sax that adds a kind of soothingness and hope to the narrative. "I lost myself, and I got trashed, but it's gonna be ok." Melancholic and beautiful with a hint of strength. A definite 11
 
**MrSwearword** (11): one of her best songs ever made. Shows off her range and is beautiful as fuck.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): Lana said this one was her favorite off the album bc it's jazzy and... there's some points she's made
 
**slimboyfriend** (11): invented sensual understated saxophone
 
**Solovrinne** (11): Hauntingly beautiful. This track is so weirdly ahead of its time now that David Bowie is gone.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): GOD this IS the BEST song EVER
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): This is how you do a song that‚Äôs almost completely still yet still brimming with serenity. Best enjoyed on a clear, calm day.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented jazz and makes me wish i had more than one 11 to give
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): Lana's best ballad. Achingly gorgeous.
 
**didney-worl** (10): I know the responsible choice is to give this my 11 but I must be true to myself uwu
 
**Leixander** (10): One of the songs that took some time to grow on me, simply gives me chills.
 
**leviswift13** (10): this is what carly meant when she was talking about emotion
 
**nick1372** (10): One of her best songs ever.
 
**nooodisaster** (10): "GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM! CAN YOU HEAR ME ALL NIGHT LONG?" Prob my favorite from this album, it's soooo good.
 
**rickdave16** (10): WOW IS THIS THE BEST LANA SONG EVER???? MIGHT BE
 
**skargardin** (10): Ready for this to inevitably flop on day one oop
 
**spadesluke** (10): That David Bowie interpolation is EVERYTHING
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): This song is so beautiful and chilling, and it makes me cry tears of beauty every time.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): I love Space Oddity and any iteration of it in any capacity
 
**waluigiest** (10): did y‚Äôall hear this production
 
**iamjezzac** (9): best Lana bridge to date
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I have not cemented my position as this subreddit‚Äôs resident David Bowie stan yet (I‚Äôve done so on Discord because I happen to be the only one) but I will have you people know that I raised this by a full (or is that not full?) half point because of that Space Oddity reference. As another Bowie-related fun fact, do y‚Äôall know that David had a half-brother named Terry? This might have to do with this song‚Äôs title!
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Girl At Mirror"](http://www.nrm.org/MT/graphics/GirlMirror.jpg)
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMcqKyfnT2Y&frags=pl%2Cwn
 
**nickl00** (6): it's got a nice bridge but it's a tad slow
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (6): I can tell I‚Äôm supposed to feel something, but I‚Äôm feeling nothing.  It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt love slow, stripped-down songs.  I‚Äôm not the kind of person who thinks every piece of music needs bombast‚Ä¶ but a) the lyrics are too self-conscious and artificial for me to connect with what Lana‚Äôs singing and b) it builds and builds to that final ‚Äúground control to Major Tom‚Äù section, and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúokay, it‚Äôs happening, the song is reaching the climax that‚Äôs gonna make the last few minutes of moody rambling all feel worth it‚Äú‚Ä¶ and then the intensity you were expecting just dissipates.  It‚Äôs like being edged by a song and I don‚Äôt like it.
 
**radiofan15** (5.5): It takes a fucking while to get somewhere and then‚Ä¶ it doesn't. The lurking sax and the Bowie references saved the song tho.
 
**frogaranaman** (4): no he doesnt
 
**ImADudeDuh** (2): this song feels like when it's a hot day and you go into your car after walking around a flea market for 2 hours and all the heat from your car escapes as you step in it, and it just drains you of all your energy.

**therokinrolla** (8.5)

**1998tweety** (10): Happy is a gorgeous opener to the album. It works not only as an introduction to this new album and era, but also as a bit of a goodbye to Marina's older personas in her first 2 albums. Marina has always been known for her great vocals and lyrics, this track is no exception. That second chorus where Marina sings "I believe..." is what truly elevates this song to another level for me. The bridge comes in perfectly, followed by the chorus again which creates an incredible, immersive, and emotional moment. A song like this does feel weird as the first track, which is why as I said before, it's more of a sendoff of the old Marina with Froot being the real "first" track.
 
---
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): shoot i wasn't gonna cry here
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): My favorite song on this album, it's just so beautiful and well written. It tackles an issue that a lot of artists have tried better than most songs about depression I've heard.
 
**Leixander** (10): It is funny how she called this an era where she "didn't feel like herself" where this song is RIGHT HERE. This song is more sincere than anything on Love + Fear.
 
**leviswift13** (10): one of the greatest songs of her career, "i believe in possibilities" gives me chills every time
 
**nooodisaster** (10): In my mind this is the closer. This just fills me up with such simple contentness ugu.
 
**skargardin** (10): this physically hurt me
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): To go from the artifice & bratty bops of Electra Heart to opening her next album with THIS‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs bold.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): I still remember the first time I heard this song‚Ä¶ it took my breath away.  It‚Äôs the definition of bittersweet: it perfectly conveys the pain of having suffered, as well as the triumph of having overcome.  The intimate, mouth-right-up-to-the-mic quality of those first lines gives them this amazing fragility, offset by the way the piano sounds like it was recorded at a slight distance and maybe the tiniest bit out of tune. Then it all turns into this marching, reverb-drenched bloom of rapture. That first time she sings ‚ÄúI believe in possibility‚Äù?  Fuuuuck.  Chills.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): This track is very hopeful while also being beautifully eerie.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): if you hate this song i hate you please block me
 
**rickdave16** (9.5): queen of being fake happy
 
**spadesluke** (9.2): Starting off an album with a ballad is certainly a daring choice, but I think it paid off very well, with Happy being a song I often hear as one of their favorites by her. I've always loved how the song is called Happy, sounds sad, but combines the two into a bittersweet song about finding inner happiness through the pain that failed relationships bring.
 
**iamjezzac** (9): beautiful
 
**nickl00** (9): I have really great memories connected to this song so I'll always love it
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Killer opening track and the fact that she dropped this when Pharrell's Happy was destroying the charts... her anti popstar mind
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Outsold Pharrell
 
**waluigiest** (9): she said Enjoy Your Life!!!
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): I was astounded and blown away upon listening to this simple ballad for the first time; it‚Äôs basically Soft To Be Strong‚Äôs better older sister, and while I‚Äôm a complete and total neophyte to Marina, I would not be surprised to hear commentary about this being one of the rare times in her discography where she gets up, close and personal without coating her writing in a thick layer of irony. An effective use of the piano makes this all the better, and though it may be an unusual opening, Happy is very, very good.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): It‚Äôs a song about being happy but it sounds so melancholy, I like the contrast.
 
**akanewasright** (8): Killer opener for the album, killer closer on tour.
 
**nick1372** (8): Love this combination of upbeat lyrics and the slow soothing beat.
 
**rosesmp3** (8): God I Wish This Was Me
 
**Solovrinne** (8): This song makes me smile. I'm happy you are happy Marina.
 
**\_wailordfan** (7.5): an overrated emotion
 
**MrSwearword** (7): She's able to sing but what sad bastard shit to open an album with
 
**Raykel** (6.5): It started out beautifully, I wish it stayed at that level
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): a bit of a weak ballad tbh
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Toys ‚ÄòR‚Äô Us
 
**radiofan15** (5.9): Is this a religious ballad?‚Ä¶ well, it's a brace choice for an opener, that's the most I can say.
 
**gannade** (5): shouldve just been straight acapella and like 1.5 minutes shorter teabh
 
**frogaranaman** (4): cherry
 
**FireLordAegon** (3): Wow I can barely remember anything 5 seconds after it ended. Could have been a decent intro if it was cut short.

**therokinrolla** (10): This song feels like the soundtrack to an epic journey, with falling spacemen, vast landscapes, long nights, and thrills at every turn. When you listen to this song you feel like something very important is happening, whether its the long yet necessary outro, or the action-packed melodies, or the simple but provactive intro. Really, its a perfect song. There's simply nothing wrong with this song lol. 

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love songs with strong imagery. Unlike a lot of Flor's usual songs talking about water, HBHBHB instead describes the sky and space above. Just like What Kind Of Man, HBHBHB starts out slow but then transitions into a louder higher energy song, and while I do love that, I kind of wish that it stuck has a ballad. I do feel conflicted about that though cause I very much love both of those options, but I guess what we have right now is a great product; if I wanted a slower version I could just look up the acoustic version. Another thing about this song is its outro. An outro can make or break a song: A good example is Lorde's Melodrama. Some of the songs have repetitive outros that stretch on for twice the length that they should, and it ends up taking you out of the album experience. Other tracks are well timed and keep the momentum going. HBHBHB falls into the latter category, the outro isn't that long and y'all know how I love trumpets.
 
---
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): What a fucking title. This song is so evocative, it feels like the soundtrack to the best fantasy epics I‚Äôd write in my mind as a kid. That orchestral outro? Amazing.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (11): Jesus, this song sounds important. The ending is just ugh. I knew florence was good, but i didn't know she was THIS good
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): The outro‚Äôs brass is orgasmic.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): now THIS is a title track! aaaaah the lyricism! the drama!
 
**FireLordAegon** (10): Ok maybe Lana losing this rate won't be the worst thing in the world. Queen of Adjectives.
 
**leviswift13** (10): this is what joy sounds like. the outro is heavenly; horns suit florence so well.
 
**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): Those trumpets at the end are so sweet and warm I want them to be my mother
 
**nick1372** (10): This track really highlight's Florence's ability to play around with the structure of the song. It's hard to differentiate the chorus and the verses at first glace in the song because it flows so well and that is so tough to pull off.
 
**rickdave16** (10): queen of all things big blue and beautiful
 
**spadesluke** (10): boy am i glad that man fell from space
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): That outro is truly sublime and anticlimactic.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): That outro invented trumpets and trombones. Personally for me this is the best song that she has ever made because everytime I listen to it, I get this feeling of euphoria and release. I never knew that an outro to a song can make me so emotional. This is the song that cemented as a full-time Florence stan and I thank her for giving me such a good music taste.
 
**Misentro** (9): üé∫üé∫üé∫
 
**waluigiest** (9): the songwriting jumped out
 
**radiofan15** (8.9): Carl Sagan would be proud!
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.5): From a strictly musical perspective, I have to admit that every time I listen, it takes me a while to really warm up to this song, but the lyrics are a straight-up poem, and I‚Äôm a sucker for horns in pop/rock songs.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I was about to give a shitty comment to this song. I was about to go with something like ‚ÄòFlorence tries to take the role of being a storyteller here, in the vein of Joni Mitchell, but while this is a great effort from a very talented woman like herself, it just doesn‚Äôt quite make the cut into being a convincing tale.‚Äô Then those horns came out of my speakers, and I died on a very personal level. I am sorry, Florence. I still don‚Äôt quite...get this song, but now I‚Äôm convinced that was my brain‚Äôs fault. Please forgive me.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (8): Good, love the instrumental bridge.
 
**iamjezzac** (8): it does pick up - the instrumental build is legendary
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): this song is every color at once
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Willow](https://d144mzi0q5mijx.cloudfront.net/img/W/I/WillowA.png)
 
**Leixander** (7): The instrumental part is simply amazing but I don't like the rest of the song as much.
 
**Solovrinne** (7): I never enjoyed this one as much as some people did, but it's still a nice track.
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): smaller than usual, only 1 song, quite beautiful.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6.5): Pretty but a bit dull
 
**MrSwearword** (6): it's fine for the bit of tripe it is but this needs to be addressed; "between a crucifix and a Hollywood sign" bitch I know you did not just swagger-jack Lana for that one.
 
**nickl00** (6): too slow
 
**frogaranaman** (5): I feel like this is a decently good song but my mind is telling me something is off

**therokinrolla** (11): One of Lana's most brilliant abilities is her tendency to make two part choruses, and this is one of her best undoubtedly, its arguably a 3 parter when "in all the right places" comes in. Theres a reason this deep cut is one of the highest songs from Honeymoon: the way Lana's lyrics leave the imagination to run wild, the reverb drenched guitar that decadently coats the background, and the bridge that seems to set the entire world on fire, a reminder that Lana is one of the few pop stars that understands the power of a good bridge. Lana's ability to world build with a single song is unmatched, and this is perhaps her best example of it. This is undoubtedly one of my top 5 Lana songs. Perfection. 

**1998tweety** (10): People argue about Lana having really long songs, but she really needs the length to take you on a fully immersive journey. Oddly, this song feels loaded with hooks: the pre-chorus, chorus, and post-chorus are all catchy. The bridge and outro are so so good as well. The thing I love the most about this song is how hopeless Lana sounds. She sounds like she really has no idea what she's gonna do. Lana has so many sad sad songs, but she makes it so believable that *this* is her blackest day.
 
---
 
**didney-worl** (11): the bridge on this song transports me to another universe where I have experienced love and heartbreak
 
**nick1372** (11): EVER SINCE MY BABY WENT AWAYYYYY ITS BEEN THE BLACKEST DAYYYYY
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i also want it deeper and deeper harder and harder
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Finally, some good fucking music.
 
**Leixander** (10): #LanaForJamesBondSoundtrack
 
**nickl00** (10): the perfect breakup song that has the best bridge on an album with amazing bridges
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): A depression BALLAD
 
**vhqv1997** (10): In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might beware my power--Green Lantern's light
 
**spadesluke** (9.8): This is one of my favorites off the album, reminding me quite a bit of the droning sound that Ultraviolence often had (UV is my favorite Lana album, so that's definitely a good thing). I especially love the bridge and the aggressively whispered "deeeper" throughout the chorus, along with the harp played right afterward.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): This is my personal pick for the best deep cut from Honeymoon; the Blackest Day is, much like Ride, an absolutely fantastic musical thesis statement of Lana‚Äôs career, collecting all the melodrama and flair of her art into one unquestionably solid masterpiece. There are few songs on Honeymoon where Lana is as commanding as she is here, and I can never listen to the Blackest Day without being astounded by it. With that being said...this song‚Äôs bridge is eerily similar to a slowed down version of David Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄòNew Killer Star‚Äô. And she referenced Bowie several songs ago...I‚Äôm watching you, Lana.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): Blue Jeans highkey did this better, teebs. Still, it's not bad
 
**rickdave16** (8): beautiful simple song
 
**waluigiest** (8): sweet bby
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): The Day of Black Sun Parts 1 and 2
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): DEEPERRRR...HARDERRRRR
 
**Solovrinne** (7.5): This song always sounds better in my head as opposed to the studio version. It's not nearly as spectacular as people make it out to be.
 
**iamjezzac** (7): unpopular opinion: this song is overhyped. it‚Äôs somehow too melodramatic and the production is suffocatingly overbearing
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "The Master's Arm"](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/3703483809_0468a9e4bd_o.jpg)
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): lana‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm begging you‚Ä¶ write a different song
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (6.5): Okay, my first take was that she‚Äôs really not selling this one for me.  Even SHE doesn‚Äôt sound convinced when she‚Äôs singing ‚Äúever since my baby went away it‚Äôs been the blackest day‚Äù.  But it picks up significantly after the ‚Äúyou should‚Äôve known better‚Äù section.
 
**leviswift13** (6): the song lights up during the post-chorus, but during the verses and the chorus it seems more like the idea of a lana song than an actual good lana song
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): the biggest, blackest day
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (5): really could've used some more polish lyrically.
 
**frogaranaman** (5): can a sugar daddy just come swoop me up already im tired of listening to this album
 
**radiofan15** (5): I really hate how this one had such a potential but the production blows, the chorus is quite unattractive and the song itself is just way too long.

1998tweety: # Honeymoon
 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 7.663 **// Average Controversy:** 1.862
 
---
 
**didney-worl** (9.677): the most underrated Lana album, by far
 
**MaydayPVZ** (9.462): Every single bridge is magnificently crafted, Lana's magnum opus.
 
**Leixander** (8.962): Absolutely one of my favorite albums ever, very close to Ultraviolence in terms of quality.
 
**rickdave16** (8.692): wow my favorite Lana album HERE WE GO
 
**Misentro** (8.692): Her best album. I'm willing to fight on this. It defines the word "atmosphere," as soon as you hear the opening strings to "Honeymoon" you're instantly driving down the highway on a lazy hot summer evening in California.
 
**spadesluke** (8.592): Lana's at a bit of a disadvantage for me because FROOT and HBHBHB are two of my favorite albums ever, but Honeymoon is also my second favorite Lana album, so this is still overall a really solid rate!
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.500): Pretty much the quintessential Lana Del Rey album. One of her strongest bodies of work, sadly often overlooked in her discography
 
**skargardin** (8.462): I know that im probably in the minority here, but I absolutely love the entirety of Honeymoon, even though it does start to drag with the final four tracks, there‚Äôs like no denying that. It makes me wanna live some kinda old hollywood trophy wife fantasy, don‚Äôt judge me.
 
**waluigiest** (8.385): I missed this Lana era when it came out (for years I thought it went Ultraviolence -> Lust For Life) so my appreciation is all retroactive. That being said, there‚Äôs not a dud on this album she knocked it out of the park.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (8.231): Thanks to this rate I discovered that this one is by far my favorite Lana album.
 
**treadwater11** (8.231): so atmospheric- I could listen to Lana all day long. No one does a bridge like her.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.115): Lana was one of the first pop artists I tried to get into once my cringeworthy classic rock phase ended, and for awhile, Honeymoon was the only record I didn‚Äôt really like from her. My complaints against it were the same as a lot of other people‚Äôs: too slow! Too sophisticated! Too boring! But the more time passes by, the more I realize that even if Honeymoon can get close to testing my patience at times, it really is a work of beauty. Lana has always been very influenced by literature, but I believe that Honeymoon is the first album of hers where her lyricism truly akin to a work of fiction. Sure, she referenced her favourite books before, but songs like Terrence Loves You or the Blackest Day? Sheer poetry, if I do say so myself! Honeymoon has a few problems, but in my heart, I think it‚Äôs the first time Lana truly comes into tune with the artistry she‚Äôs best suited to. This is her cohesive peak, even if she has better songs by themselves on the side. It might put some people to sleep, but it was critically acclaimed for a damn good reason.
 
**jexan13** (8.000): Truly Lana's best album. It feels like a movie in music form. But it is not for everyone. The first time I listened to it I hated it and thought it was boring.
 
**Tolk1en** (7.846): Heaven is a place on hearth with Lana Del Rey
 
**leviswift13** (7.846): overall a very beautiful album from pop's resident sad girl. i appreciate how slow and orchestral she went with the sound. i prefer my lana with a little more blood in her veins, but honeymoon is still an incredibly cohesive work that features some career best work and some exciting variations on her sound
 
**Callum1245** (7.846): 8
 
**nooodisaster** (7.769): Every song on this album is like 4 minutes 50 something seconds and I'm over it.
 
**radiofan15** (7.577): I really like Lana and I wished her the best but there are a couple of obvious reason on why this is my second least-favorite Lana album (Ultraviolence takes the top spot)‚Ä¶ those are things everyone will agree on, that there's way too many rough spots on the records and that overstays its welcome‚Ä¶ and honestly, despite Lana's good intentions and some of the best tracks in her discography, I have to agree with [Score: B]
 
**vhqv1997** (7.462): It took me quite a while to get into the flow of this record, as I imagine it did for everybody else as well. But once it clicked, it really was beautiful. Some of the tracks might be the most heavenly in Lana's discography, and I swear I may never stop replaying Music To Watch Boys To or Salvatore. But at the same time, this album has this major problem of being too exhausting. It's something very brave and experimental to make an album entirely around being sad and low-energy, but Lana forgot that it'll also have to be gripping. And that's where this album faltered, if it only had like 9 or 10 tracks, I would never stop coming back to it. But she overdid it, and it really drags towards the end.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.154): the funny thing is that i think this has my lowest scores yet it's not my least favourite album
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6.692): Way too long, not enough original ideas, and this is where Lana's schtick really started to wear thin for me. That being said, some songs have this cinematic flair that elevate them to near the top of her discography, and there's only a handful of songs that stand out as being particularly terrible. [Grade: C+]
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.408): My least favorite Lana album by far, though I haven‚Äôt listened to *Ultraviolence* in a while. Maybe I‚Äôm just a slut for her poppier stuff but I found that this album meandered too much. She went for a hazy atmosphere and she definitely achieved it, but the problem is when I reach the end I‚Äôm left kind of unsatisfied. It starts so strong with that first track but after that she just kind of‚Ä¶ rambles. Oftentimes she‚Äôd make her point with the song and then just kind of keep going for a while, or worse, never reach any kind of point at all. Let‚Äôs just call this album ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù and ‚Äúdreamy‚Äù and move on with our lives.
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.538): This album reinforces I like the idea of Lana more than the reality of Lana. As always her voice and lyrics are gorgeous, but none of the music is interesting enough to keep my attention. I found myself continually checking how much time I had left for almost every track. Ultraviolence Lana is the best Lana.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4.769): I always trash on Lana del Rey, but now that I've finally listened to this album, I now know I was so right to do so whew.
 
**frogaranaman** (3.769): this album is for rich people who want to feel poor

**therokinrolla** (9): The chorus here is magnificent. The rest is a little give or take, but the chorus feels like she decided to give the gays everything we want. And we want this yes MAAM. This is power.

**1998tweety** (10): I love songs like this with super sad lyrics but upbeat and dance-y production. Again, Marina uses her vocals perfectly here to give the song just what it needs. The chorus, in particular, is my favorite part, but the rest of the song, especially the bridge, add a lot to the song as well.
 
---
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): Back when I moderated for Genius, I consisted doing a breakdown of this song‚Äôs music video. That project never came into fruition.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): give me love give me memes
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): You know what that is? Growth.
 
**leviswift13** (10): snatched my wig in 2015, and snatches with just as much force and ease in 2019. when someone looks up pop perfection in a dictionary, this is what they'll find
 
**rickdave16** (10): god the first four tracks of this album are amazing
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Those vocals during the chorus are gorjus luv
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Really interesting song. The lyrics are very sad, but the song is also fast in a major key. This adds some dissonance, but also some extra meaning, I feel.
 
**nooodisaster** (9): shoulda been lead single, what a perfect simple bop.
 
**vhqv1997** (9): give me love give me dream give me a good self-esteem but more importantly give me a boyfriend, which could substitute for all of the above
 
**waluigiest** (9): loved this in my Tumblr days and loved it again after my first breakup. It‚Äôs faded a little over time but this song used to be so important to me and I‚Äôll love it for that.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): In the middle of Froot‚Äôs sonic landscape, this is definitely a very cute and unique track! It touches on a style that I would have never expected from Marina; pure 80s pop, which I‚Äôm sure many gays on here will go horny for. I don‚Äôt associate the kind of ironic euphoria songs like this bring forth with any Marina song, especially on Froot, but this direction is still executed perfectly well, even if Marina doesn‚Äôt quite find her footing on it.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (8): the production on this song is so wonderful I really love it. It feels strangely joyful and the chorus is really catchy.
 
**nick1372** (8): Absolute banger. A cornerstone of the "breakup songs that describe relationships in colors" genre. Almost too perfect so it doesn't really differentiate itself from many similar songs.
 
**Solovrinne** (8): A slow build-up, but this track turns out to be a jam.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Rice Krispies
 
**radiofan15** (7.5): The build up is nice and the lyrics continues to be relatable so she continues to do nicely in my book so far.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7): From an instrumental perspective this song starts really strong, with those bouncy chords at the beginning, and the way it changes up once the beat kicks in‚Ä¶ and I love the ‚Äúgimme love, gimme dreams, gimme a good self esteem‚Äù refrain (bitch me too the fuck)‚Ä¶ I do have to say that while there are a few golden moments in the vocal delivery (‚Äúno I don‚Äôt love you / no I don‚Äôt care / I just wanna be / held when I‚Äôm scared‚Äù, for example), I don‚Äôt always find this song super compelling.  It‚Äôs not one of the ones I come back to that often on this album, and to be totally honest after a while I get a little bored listening to it.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7): da ba dee da ba doo
 
**CarlieScion** (6): halsey who
 
**nickl00** (6): a bit too generic compared to the rest of the album
 
**treadwater11** (6): the beginning bit reminds me of Sober
 
**frogaranaman** (5): -berry
 
**MrSwearword** (5): a blah effort with half-assed delivery

**therokinrolla** (4): My least favorite Florence song. *gasp*. While I love the bouncy, rhythmic, and surprisingly major key production, when the song reaches the chorus Florence begins shrieking across a non existent melody. Now, I love me some shrieking from Miss Witchy Witch. I love shrieks a lot, I'm a Kate Bush and Flo stan so i kinda have to. But the vocal climax delivers nothing, and is just in no way compelling. The production barely shifts, she carries little to no melody, and the line "Did I build this ship to wreck?" hits much harder in the prechorus rather than the chorus. It feels so sloppy for a Florence song and no matter how many listens I give it I just can't get behind it.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Florence has always been known for her incredible multi-layered lyrics and her ability to tell a vivid story, this track is no exception. Water imagery has been a staple of Florence's songwriting, and for good reason, she utilizes it extremely well. The production on this is amazing as well, the rock sound works well with her voice, and speaking of her vocals, they're on point as well. I do agree with my cohost though that the chorus does feel a little unsatisfying. The pre-chorus is an amazing lead-up, but I almost feel like it's wasted a bit on what we ended up getting. That's not to say that the chorus isn't good, it just feels a tad bit underutilized, which is what prevents me from giving this a 10.

**skargardin** (11): This song has always been one of my favorite of Florence‚Äôs songs, from the ‚Äúbeing hopelessly lost at sea‚Äù imagery to the instrumentals that evoke the feeling of walking home drunk on a saturday night contemplating just how you got to that point, feeling like your life is going to fall apart. Forest nymph queen really did THA
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (11): AHHHHHH I LOVE THIS SONG IT JUST HAS SUCH GREAT VOCALS AND THE WAY SHE SINGS SHIP TO WRECK I CAN'T OMG
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): I love the sentiment of this song and I think the allegory is executed really well but not shoved down your throat.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): a mfing wig snatcher, obviously
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (10): This is just a god damn fun song to sing along to.
 
**nick1372** (10): God her voice...
 
**Solovrinne** (10): A certified bop. I really like the message in this one.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Florence really has a very GP-unappreciated voice, and it shows in most of these tracks, including this one.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): She didn't have to go that hard for the final chorus, but she did and we are all blessed for it
 
**yourhostandpatron** (10): Ship To Wreck is a bloody fantastic opening to this album that attracted me ever since I listened to it for the first time, and it‚Äôs such a masterpiece that I‚Äôm tempted to call it Florence‚Äôs equivalent to State of Grace. Indeed, the way Ship of Wreck acts as a testament to the rest of How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful will make it seem like a folkier version of the aforementioned song; maybe I‚Äôm just stalling for words and maybe I‚Äôm just too much of a Taylor stan, so you shouldn‚Äôt trust this comparison, but the impression Ship To Wreck gives me is almost as good. I will not back down on this statement.
 
**spadesluke** (9.8): I've always thought this album would flow a bit better if it started out with What Kind of Man rather than this song, but otherwise goddamn is this song a BOP. A few of my favorite moments on this album include the "UH" near the beginning of the second verse, the "GOOD GOD" at the start of the bridge, and the intense "WREEEEEEEEEEEECK" in the final chorus
 
**FireLordAegon** (9.5): That's one way to start an album
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.5): Those bell-like opening chords might trick you for a few seconds into thinking this is going to be a peppy, pop-punk-influenced romp‚Ä¶ but hell no, this is a Florence and the Machine song and instead you‚Äôd better be ready to get DRAGGED by the fucking heart strings.  Because the emotions in her vocal delivery? PHEW.  The anger, disappointment, and self-hatred are all palpable - just the way she sings ‚Äúand good God‚Äù is like a gut punch.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): a propulsive intro! that bridge is fantastic too
 
**leviswift13** (9): a perfect opener that introduces the listener to the more earthly, personal world of hbhbhb while still allowing a perfect showcase for florence's soaring vocals and gripping imagery
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): a HIT! or at least I remember this being on the radio a lot
 
**rickdave16** (9): beautiful opener with an amazing chorus
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): Feels more straighforward or more pure pop than a "normal" F+M song. But still has some of her signature flair.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Soria](https://fontmeme.com/images/soria-uppercase.png)
 
**radiofan15** (8.6): Loving those subtle The Cure vibes‚Ä¶
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Idk what you built this ship for, the song sounds great.
 
**Leixander** (8.5): A bit basic song in her discography but it still bops.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): Florence's singing is fabulous but the production is too sunny; makes me think of Sara Bareilles and that is *not* a compliment
 
**waluigiest** (8): yes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I too build ships to wreck
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): water GODDESS
 
**nooodisaster** (7): Florence: "my writing partner told me I had to stop writing water-metaphor songs after Ceremonials." Florence: *opens with Ship to Wreck.*
 
**frogaranaman** (6): all I remember about this song for prior knowledge is my friend telling me ‚Äòthis song will change you life‚Äô then my life getting worse
 
**nickl00** (6): it's a good opener but only okay

**therokinrolla** (9.5)

**1998tweety** (10): There are so many words in this song and stunning verses in this song, all of them super well made and catchy. I particularly love that she swapped pronouns and instead places the role of the guy. Honestly this is one of Florence's best songs; it's expertly made and there are so many pluses to it. The story is the key factor of the song and everything else is built around that story perfectly to enhance it.
 
---
 
**CarlieScion** (11): TOO FAST FOR FREEDOM!!!!
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (11): there's something to be said about the power Delilah has. in a discography full of magic and enchantment, Delilah is perhaps the single most powerfully visceral song Florence has yet to release. the buildup from that slow intro into the absolutely liberating release is fantastic, and the bit at the end where she's just straight up WAILING in the background is totally freeing. also totally made me have an out of body experience when i saw her back in 2016
 
**vhqv1997** (11): This album, especially the first half, is incredibly strong, so it's difficult to just choose one song to give an 11 to, but after much deliberation, I have decided Delilah should have it. It is a tremendously well-crafted song, with great vocals, great lyrics, great instrumentals, and it is also exceptionally fresh. The way Florence turned the subject of being ignored on phone calls into such a devastating emotion is unreal and truly showcases her artistry and level of dedication. Comparing such a banal interaction to the biblical yet iconic betrayal of Delilah against Samson sounds pretty ludicrous on paper, but the way Flo committed to it so much truly brought about greatness and wrecked me emotionally. So yes, I don't know if this song will win the rate, and most likely all of the great songs on this album will steal scores from each other again like what happened to Lungs, but this song deserves the respect of everyone and I would dare say it is her greatest song yet.
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): Big track.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): The melodies and the build of the production brings this to being one of the best songs on this album. This is the song that captures the anger and disaster that HBHBHB is about.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I'm sad it's not a lesbian anthem, but every florence song is a lesbian anthem anyway.
 
**Leixander** (10): IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF DANGER! AND THE BELLS ARE RINGING OUT!
 
**nooodisaster** (10): YES! YES. The falsetto made me realize how much I miss La Roux. Just an amazingly fun song to listen and bop along to and a pretty perfect evolution from Ceremonials.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): One of her best
 
**radiofan15** (10): Come on WITCH! Summon those demons!
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): This track is bombastic throughout and doesn‚Äôt slow down any time soon.
 
**waluigiest** (10): the piano interlude and how it grows from there is so well done
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.5): Look, after hearing Various Storms & Saints, I would happily listen to a whole album of percussionless guitar-voice-and-choir ballads from Florence‚Ä¶ but nobody, and I mean nobody, does BIG songs like her. This might be one of her best.
 
**iamjezzac** (9): flo‚Äôs high vocals here are liquid gold
 
**leviswift13** (9): this, ladies and gays, is what we call a banger
 
**nick1372** (9): She really hits those high notes on this one we didn't deserve that
 
**Solovrinne** (9): This song is so brilliantly crafted and really shows the band's creative ability.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): I am getting slightly scared at my ability to keep on typing these long comments due to my laptop's gradual loss of battery, but I am not leaving my ballot without some praise for Deliliah! This is the middle child that glues, ties and binds How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful together in a fiery dance, and, oh, boy, does Florence deliver. I have said variants of this sentence too many times, but it is true! There‚Äôs intrigue going on in this song that you don‚Äôt want to miss out on, and Florence will tempt you into dancing along.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like the bridge.
 
**rickdave16** (8): a slower start for me but by the middle this song really picks up
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Behrens Schrift](http://www.fontscape.com/pictures2/solotype/BehrensSchrift.gif)
 
**MrSwearword** (7): anthemic but doesn't live up to anything
 
**nickl00** (7): one of the stronger choruses
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): witchy lesbian dance anthem
 
**frogaranaman** (6): whats it like in new york city im a thousand miles away but girl tonight you look so pretty yes you do

**therokinrolla** (10): Oh my god Florence take a breath jesus. When you see that this song is over 5 minutes you might think there'd be a lot of empty space, or some times where there isn't quite enough energy, but nah, for the entire 5 minutes the song absolutely refuses to slow down. This song is a fucking war, paced like an alcohlic binge-drinker. There is no chill, and no peace, here. Just drums and trumpets.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow what a gorgeous song, I LOVE that intro and thankfully everything afterwards lives up to it. Despite being a 5 minute long ride, I'm glad this song didn't slow down at any point. It keeps that incredible high energy up throughout the whole song. I love the marching band instrumentation as well, feels very underrated in general. 
 
---
 
**spadesluke** (11): I really cannot downplay how much I adore this song. It feels like the song that would play during a major battle in a fantasy movie. Florence's performance here is absolutely stellar, and the production and writing work together to create an incredible experience. And it flows so well from the previous song! The claps throughout the verses give you an urgent feeling, with the instrumentation during this part giving a dark feel, showcasing the anger and sorrow that Florence is working up toward shouting at the top of her lungs during the chorus.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i think we're ALL overcome!
 
**iamjezzac** (10): deserved to be a hit :(
 
**leviswift13** (10): i love that this song is so theatrical and witchy and weird, but still fits in this world by the grounded production and the universal pain present in the chorus
 
**Solovrinne** (10): This is stunning. The whole track is an earworm. I love the message of just being overwhelmed and the vocals definitely embellish that.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): The chorus makes me feel weirdly nostalgic but idk why.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): When I first heard it I thought it was a song written for Game of Thrones and to this day I am still mad that it never got used for the show
 
**FireLordAegon** (9.5): Omg the horns
 
**rickdave16** (9.5): wow I forgot how fucking amazing this album is AND THAT CHORUS GOES ALL THE WAY OFF
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.5): Ugh I love epic-mythological Florence, better yet when it‚Äôs a decipherable allegory.
 
**chihuahuazero** (9): I see the water, Florence.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): bop, but not as good as Q.U.E.E.N. by Janelle, so idk why this won Q in the alphabet game
 
**nickl00** (9): I really like the melody
 
**waluigiest** (9): horns are great. Something about the production makes me uneasy, otherwise this is stellar
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Queen of Peace? More like Queen of Folk Rock! But, yes, although I do get concerns about this album becoming slightly too homogenous around the time I listen to this song, Queen of Peace is still an excellent song that stays true to Florence‚Äôs witchy formula and executes it very well. Once again, after the calm and sage storytelling of the previous track, Florence sounds full of power and ready to conquer a kingdom in this lovely deep cut, which is ironic given this song‚Äôs name, but also strangely effective!
 
**Leixander** (8.5): This song has something I call "the Ceremonials curse", where she goes too grand in terms of production and vocals. It is literally tiring to listen to this song, even though it is worth it in most of the times.
 
**slimboyfriend** (8.5): the trumpets on this album were such a good investment
 
**MrSwearword** (8): pretty good but not stellar
 
**nick1372** (8): One of her classics
 
**radiofan15** (7.8): Where is her Nobel Prize?!?
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Really cool but at the same time the more I thought about it it was just kind of noise.
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): wow this is actually kinda a bop.

deleted: > radiofan15 (5.033): Although the title track shines in all of its retro-tinted electro-pop extravagant glory, the remainder of the album is lifeless, bland, calculated, by the numbers and ultimately boring‚Ä¶ it doesn't help that Marina's voice sounds drowned and bored, and that there's some tracks who showcases a surprising degree of unfulfilled potential.

Yeah they have their issues when it comes to overworking their population......but besides that and a few other things, this is a pretty goat country.

**therokinrolla** (9): There's a certain je ne sies quoi to this song. It's not my favorite Florence song, but i certainly understand the appraise y'all gave it. That long, slow intro that builds up to pure rock chaos and a structure that's somewhat hard to pick out at first. Its definitely one of the strongest-willed songs in this rate, you kinda feel like you're at Florence's wills and wrath. Its fun, its powerful, and i get it, but personally it doesn't hit *quite* right. 

**1998tweety** (10): The second those guitars crash in is incredible. I adore songs that start off slow but break out into mass hysteria, the super important thing is knowing when to make that switch, and What Kind Of Man accomplishes that perfectly. We get just enough of the slow sad bit, but not enough that it drowns out the rest of the song. For the upbeat rock bit, Florence lends her vocals to that style more than I usually see, and it really adds that extra touch that was needed to fully sell it. The lyrics overlap the instrumentation perfectly (trumpets always will be amazing if used properly, and this song knows exactly what it's doing). 
 
---
 
**chihuahuazero** (11): I remember the day this track dropped. It was an event. When the guitar riff kicks in, you know someone is gonna get it. This feel relevant to our time. There are way too many men out there not loving the way they should. I‚Äôd like to see Florence do more rock n‚Äô roll. All hail the queen.
 
**iamjezzac** (11): god, the vocoder, the guitars, the drums... a masterpiece
 
**rotating3Dtext** (11): that intro THAT INTRO
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): Definitely the best song on the album. Florence's voice is so raw, and the driving guitar and horns add all the neccesary weight to the instrumental.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): snatched my wig clean off when i heard this live
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fucking expose him queen
 
**leviswift13** (10): the guitars are the most alarming, powerful, wounded, electric things i've ever heard. rock looks so good on florence, and she has never sounded more primal than when she is snarling on the chorus. fuck men, am i right?
 
**Misentro** (10): The angry breakup anthem YOU deserve!
 
**MrSwearword** (10): deliciously weird as shit and therefore, fabulous
 
**nick1372** (10): The slow burn first few verses build up so much and then the chorus PAYS OFF
 
**nickl00** (10): this has remained one of my favorites purely because of her voice
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): I remember being shook for like an hour after hearing this song for the first time. The last thing I was expecting from Florence and yet it made perfect sense.
 
**rickdave16** (10): what a fucking SONG wow I love this so much
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): The minimalistic intro into the prechorus is very breathtaking, and what sells the song for me.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): I was shooketh when she released this as her first single. The sheer, raw intensity of the instrumentals and vocal delivery destroyed me. Never before has Florence made something so angry, and this is probably also the last time she did. Before she would cloak her emotions in metaphors, but in this song she straight-up calls out to her lover like she would tear him apart. And we all know she could. I also think this is Florence's best shot at winning this rate, but we are all kidding ourselves if this is actually her best song in this album. It's not my favorite in the album, by far, but it's a goddamn amazing high.
 
**williamdowley123** (10): they played this soo much on radio one ugh nostalgia xx
 
**radiofan15** (9.3): Florence said FUCK NOVEMBER 19!
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): This is a great angry banger.
 
**FireLordAegon** (9): Men are trifling we been knew
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): she‚Äôs kind of a rocker chick y‚Äôknow??
 
**Solovrinne** (9): The guitar pops in and changes the entire mood of the song, I love it.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9): I can‚Äôt be the only one who kind of hears Walking With a Ghost in that post-intro guitar riff, right?
 
**waluigiest** (9): when the guitar comes in‚Ä¶. Yes
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Filipino radio is weird with the songs it tends to spam; I would be surprised if this got any airplay in the United States at all, but I did hear this song very frequently on the radio station I liked listening to the most back in 2015, and it was an experience listening to the fury of Florence Welch. To be honest, this is my least favourite song from this rate that‚Äôs likely to win, but I still hold an attachment to it and I would never contest the fact that it probably deserves to snatch the crown. Pax!
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): a VIOLENT bop. ie i dance violently but also the music video has a literal car wreck.
 
**Leixander** (8): Grew on me, yet a very weak lead single compared to Shake It Out.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Bistro](http://www.fontscape.com/pictures2/p22/ArtNouveauBistro.gif)
 
**frogaranaman** (7): is she doing the minimal to be a witch in this song or
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): It‚Äôs fine, but there‚Äôs better songs here.

1998tweety: # How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful
 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 8.034 **// Average Controversy:** 1.564
 
---
 
**leviswift13** (9.500): one of the best albums of the decade. florence delivers everytime, but hbhbhb is something very special. it is a flawless merge of her witchy theatrics and a confessionaly singer-songwriter style that makes it obvious she has more in common with stevie nicks than kate bush. i love how the lyrics are raw and poetic and emotional and moving and intelligent. i love that the production is both grand and grounded. i love how when she sings it feels like she is the only thing that truly exists and we are just orbitting around her. hbhbhb is an album for anyone who has ever been in love, been in pain and survived to tell the tale.
 
**spadesluke** (9.436): This is quite possibly my favorite album of all time. Easily within the Top 5. It's just such an incredibly grandiose, fantastical experience that I can't comprehend how anyone would rate lower than a 10/10. Florence is one of the best singers on this planet, with this album featuring some of her best vocals, and The Machine delivers their best instrumentation in their career.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (8.929): This album left me completely speechless, genuinely. I went in completely blind and was hit with an unstoppable train of heartache and agony.
 
**Leixander** (8.464): I was disappointed with this album at first. Lead single, What Kind Of Man, didn't woo me and I was worried about how the rest of the album turned out. When she released St. Jude I was ready to give back my fan card. Ship To Wreck restored a bit of faith and Delilah was the turning point. Almost four years after release, I can say that I like this album even though it is not up to par compared to Ceremonials and Lungs. It however contains some of her best songs (Various Storms & Saints, Delilah).
 
**Misentro** (8.429): Loses steam after Delilah, but this is some of Florence's absolute best work.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.357): This album really solidified Florence as a star. The rolicking production works really well with Florence's erratic yet soaring voice, and there's just an epic soundscape that I really vibe with. The tracks sort of blend together but it is a very enjoyable listening experience. [Grade: A-]
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.250): My very first Florence and the Machine album that I‚Äôve ever listened to, and even if it‚Äôs probably my least favourite album in the rate, it‚Äôs still a very good mixture of folk, pop, and rock (I could have sworn I used this description for Niall‚Äôs album in the other rate but this is way better) and it was a charismatic way of showing me Florence‚Äôs witchy music and personality. My one criticism of this record is that it needs more ways to distinguish itself from within, but overall, it‚Äôs very high quality! I like it!
 
**radiofan15** (7.979): Florence + co.'s third studio album is a nice change of pace for the band and a strong effort that showcases their strengths, unfortunately is also quite uneven and is filled with some very samey songs that sinks any chances this one has. [Score: B]
 
**FireLordAegon** (7.871): I finally gave this album a listen and I am so happy I did. I might like it more than Ceremonials.
 
**waluigiest** (7.857): I know the other two albums very well but not this one, so I‚Äôm trying to rate it somewhat fairly. It‚Äôs generally impressive at first listen like most of this rate
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.857): This ended up being probably my favorite album in the rate. Personally I feel like all of them get lost in their ‚Äúsound‚Äù and end up forgetting to make distinctive, memorable tracks, but Florence ended up having the best sound to wade through. This actually came as something of a surprise to me because I‚Äôve been trying to force myself to like *Ceremonials* for a while now because Florence seems like the type of artist I should like but I could never do it. I guess I was just looking in the wrong place! Florence has a tendency to get loud and just kind of drown you in a wall of sound, and that does apply to some of the songs here, but when she gets her act together and finds actual nuance and makes music that feels epic rather than just big she makes magic.
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.821): I knew Ship to Wreck, I know a handful of others but I think this is the first time I have ever listened to a F+TM record in full. It was the best out of the three for me and like Marina I'm excited to dive into the rest of the catalog.
 
**frogaranaman** (5.429): title is about Jumbah from Boohbah

**therokinrolla** (10): FROOT (the album) was the first time we saw Marina at the most raw and direct she can be. There's no thickly layered irony like in Electra Heart, or twisted metaphors and grotesque language like in The Family Jewels. No, for this album Marina was thoughtful, direct, and passionate, and the title track is one of the songs that benefited most from this straightforward attitude. Marina so raunchily discussing sex in theory shouild feel weird, but she wears it well, even through the weird Marina-isms and dense fruit similes. And the production is phenomenal, the disco-vibes fittingly have a tangy bite to them that make this feel like one of the most complex songs on the album sonically. The hooks are very very solid, and Marina telling me she has good luck for me is already enough for a 10 in my eyes.

**1998tweety** (10): To put it simply, this song is everything Bon Appetit wanted to be. Marina uses a plethora of well-crafted fruit metaphors mixed in with sex innuendos alongside her low sultry voice to deliver the perfect feeling. Every single part of this song adds to this feeling, much like fruit, not a single second in this song is wasted. To me, this is Marina at her best: she has a clear vision of what she wants from a song and she uses of talent of hers to execute it. I always knew it was a frontrunner, there's no wonder why it won the rate.

**hikkaru** (11): Am I a basic bitch for giving my 11 to the one song that sounds most similar to Marina's previous and most electronic work Electra Heart? Maybe so. The bloops that back Froot are a slice of infectious electropop, but I do feel that this song does the best job of doing what I love most about Marina's first two albums with the more absurd metaphors in the lyrics and the more theatrical elements of her vocals.
 
**Misentro** (11): Buried in the boring mess of this album is one of the greatest pieces of pop music ever captured. The opening bass lick gets me going like nothing else. Sad fruity disco slut anthem.
 
**radiofan15** (11): I can't believe I'm saying this but a Marina song hypnotized me and made me her hoe within the first listening‚Ä¶ the (somehow) juicy backdrop, the retro-vibed instrumental that somehow gave me Pac-Man vibes, the way it takes fucking forever to take off (I swear there's like 5 prechoruses), the bizarro lyrics (I still don't get the meaning of the fruit metaphor)‚Ä¶ I should HATE this song but I don't, it's too strong for me.
 
**rosesmp3** (11): this song makes me feel like i'm in a casino
 
**yourhostandpatron** (11): Can I confess something? I still think most fruits are disgusting, and I think ‚Äòfroot‚Äô is a disgusting spelling. Those two things turned me off to listening to this song and album when I was a child. I‚Äôm stupid, I know. I wish I could have experienced the majesty of Froot sooner. Even if I‚Äôm not a fan of this song‚Äôs title, Froot has the rhythm and the beat to it that makes it among a pantheon of pop songs that are simply just utter fun; add in the colorful metaphors and a bit of sensuality, and you have a deserving winner for this rate.
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): I remember my first time hearing this song. At school during lunch. On YouTube. Nearby the vending machines. I think I prefer college.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that intro riff... legendary
 
**didney-worl** (10): a BOP
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Everyone wants a familiar jewel moment, or whatever.
 
**iamjezzac** (10): her best song to date. the different hooks, the unconventional composition, the juicy disco production...
 
**Leixander** (10): I've been saving all my summers for you is one of my favorite tumblr-esque quotes.
 
**MrSwearword** (10): some of the lyrics suck out loud, but the production and vocals more than make up for that
 
**nickl00** (10): there's something so enticing about this song that I wish was present on the rest of the album and her following work
 
**rickdave16** (10): perfect fruity bop
 
**skargardin** (10): you better use your lower register queen
 
**Solovrinne** (10): At first I was convinced this song was just... silly. It took years for me to realize the masterpiece that it was.
 
**spadesluke** (10): The synths throughout this make me nut
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): I‚Äôve been happily bopping to this since 2014, and it‚Äôs still one of the most important songs to me today.
 
**treadwater11** (10): undeniable bop
 
**waluigiest** (10): I remember when this song dropped I listened to nothing else for a month. It‚Äôs sexy and retro and just a good experience
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): It‚Äôs the most upbeat song on the album, so automatically it‚Äôs my favorite. I‚Äôm mostly sarcastic, but I do think that this is the most sonically interesting song on the album because there‚Äôs so much going on. Those chiptunes sounds in the background in particular add a lot to this. I love the lyrics of this song, it hits on a lot of the things that I really love in a song such as food imagery and contrast of epic themes with commonplace objects. This would be a ten or maybe even an eleven but the problem is I literally can‚Äôt understand what she‚Äôs saying half the time.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.5): This is a classic Marina banger, to me: clever lyrics, ‚Äúupbeat‚Äù on the surface but with a dark undertone‚Ä¶  I also have to shout out the absolutely top-notch production - those bouncy, almost fuzzed synths, the drums and bass, the eerie chorus-like pads in the background, and then these occasional hits of something that almost sounds like shattering glass - a kind of sparkling/icy motif which is repeated a lot throughout this album.  There are a lot of songs where the production for me brings to mind frost, which is perfect for an autumnal album like this.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): well you can't say Marina didn't go for originality on this one lol. It still sounds so fun and fresh.
 
**FireLordAegon** (9): The artist that attacked Miley Cyrus for plagiarizing her food porn could never.
 
**leviswift13** (9): the weirdest pop song i've ever heard. only marina could make a froot-sex-and-love-but-also-bigger-than-sex-and-love aong be this delicious (pun intended). the chorus is disco perfection!
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): Virginity ANTHEM
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): Like the chorus. Some of the wordplay is good (and some is jush eh). I really like the guitar in the instrumental.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (9): loved this one omg
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): Delectable disco flavored bop.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): its a fun song, but is it just me, or is the chorus really awkward? That being said, the nature imagery in this song is great, and would've been a 10 if not for the chorus.
 
**nooodisaster** (8): What a weird song.. Simple subject matter, retro themed production, 5+ minute length, lead single, barely related to the rest of the album, yet the title of the album... my head.
 
**vhqv1997** (8): I prefer the single version, this version is a bit too long. This is the first song of hers I've listened to and I was so shook by the vocals and her snarky delivery. If only Marina would have gone back to this and developed it further for Love + Fear.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7.5): I like it but it doesn't have much substance
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Froot Loops
 
**CarlieScion** (5): this is a very bad song and the chorus annoys me
 
**frogaranaman** (5): apple
 
**nick1372** (5): This song turned me off of this whole album. The way she sings her vowels is just so... odd. The chorus is catchy at least!

1998tweety: # FROOT
 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 7.593 **// Average Controversy:** 1.900
 
---
 
**leviswift13** (8.917): marina's best album by far. the songwriting is uniformly strong, with the catchiest and prettiest melodies and wittiest and deepest lyrics of her career. the production is perfect for marina as well. it is both poppy and strange, appealing to both sides of the marina we all know and love. after electra heart, this was the perfect followup, and her best, most interesting and most personal (eat your heart out joanne) album to date.
 
**Callum1245** (8.917): 10
 
**spadesluke** (8.867): This album came out right when my stan status (stannage?) of Marina was at its highest and is still my favorite album by her, so this album holds a special place in my heart, even if I think I wouldn't be quite as in love with it if I listened with fresh ears today. The punch of the first five songs is still one of my favorite album sections though
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (8.417): This album is like a plump, but poorly grown apricot. Surely, it's sugary-sweet, nutritious and breaks your teeth if you try to mindlessly bite through it; however the sun-facing side has all the juices and makes the other, slightly unripe half leave an unpleasantly tangy feeling in your mouth.
 
**Leixander** (8.375): My most listened album in last.fm, which explains my high scores.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.208): The first Marina album I‚Äôve ever listened to attentively in full (I‚Äôve listened to Love + Fear before, to be fair, but nobody remembers ha). Speaking from failed experiences to get into her music in the past, overall, I think Froot was definitely the best introduction to Marina that I could‚Äôve possibly had; is it perfect? Well, a few moments and lyrics may have made me do a double take, but I can seriously say that most of Froot is highly enjoyable to me ears. This is boppy alternative pop at its best, and I‚Äôll take it for what it is.
 
**waluigiest** (7.833): a very solid Marina album! I feel like it doesn‚Äôt have the raw peaks of her other albums, but it also doesn‚Äôt have many lows. I also loved the aesthetic of the era.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7.500): ngl Love + Fear and the release campaign around it made me retroactively dislike a lot of Marina's music but Froot remains really good
 
**nooodisaster** (7.250): the FROOT track order is imo one of the worst of any album of all time (right up there with Voicenotes) so i had to listen to it in my reordered playlist so as not to rage and give unfair scores.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.000): I love the visuals and feel of this album and era much more than any other Marina era but I feel like it was sort of wasted on an album that is half filler. The singles do bop however. [Grade: B]
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.750): I loved *Electra Heart* and when I first tried listening to this one and I got bored of it pretty fast and turned it off. My tastes have matured since then so I‚Äôm glad I got this chance to revisit it because it‚Äôs actually a pretty nice album. A lot of the tracks sound too similar though, maybe it‚Äôs just her distinctive voice but after a while it feels too predictable. It‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre one of those people who‚Äôs really into picking something apart for small details but I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm one of those. I feel like the lyrics are the selling point of this album but I found them to be a little fractional; sometimes she‚Äôd have great imagery and turns of phrase but then other times it felt a bit too high school poetry. I should really listen to *The Family Jewels* now.
 
**FireLordAegon** (6.250): The album has its moments but there is a whole lot of meh
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.125): This is actually my first exposure to Marina so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Her voice is smokey and gorgeous and she is what I've wanted out of Dua Lipa in a way. The downside of this album is everything seems to repeat itself and go on for far too long, almost destroying any good will it has. But I'm excited to check out more of her work, even if the album took a downturn for me after the initial few songs.
 
**radiofan15** (5.033): Although the title track shines in all of its retro-tinted electro-pop extravagant glory, the remainder of the album is lifeless, bland, calculated, by the numbers and ultimately boring‚Ä¶ it doesn't help that Marina's voice sounds drowned and bored, and that there's some tracks who showcases a surprising degree of unfulfilled potential. [Grade: D]
 
**Misentro** (5.000): Happy, I'm a Ruin, Blue, Forget, Can't Pin Me Down, and Weeds are the same song in different tempos. I can barely tell any of them apart when they play. That said, there's a couple gems in here.
 
**frogaranaman** (3.583): im commenting fruits while my friend dicks some random alien down in andromeda
