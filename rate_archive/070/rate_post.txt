The 2015 Ultimate Alt Pop Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bw0q10/the_2015_ultimate_alt_pop_rate/

### Picture it

Tumblr still allowed porn. Obama was president. Popheads was still on Ed Sheeran's side. Women had full control of their bodies instead of being treated like inanimate sex machines. Mostly. 

The early 2010s were an era of aesthetic and faux-glamour. The artists of this rate were at their commercial peak, going beyond music and produced an experience that offered visuals, headlines, and beyond that, a lifestyle that everyone, but mostly teenage girls and gays, wanted, each troublesome and juvenile in their own way. 

But in 2015, the Tumblrgirls had grown up, and they came to prove it. They slowed things down, and lyrically went inwards instead of outwards. Each not only expanded their established audience, but they gained a level of critical acclaim that was initially missing. Although it varied, arguably 2015 was the year these 3 artists gained the validation of music critics. /u/1998tweety and I hope you discover new music to adore, or enjoy rating the albums you already love.

# Lana Del Rey - Honeymoon

*Note: The Burnt Norton interlude has been excluded from the rate*

Lana del Rey’s career trajectory was rather unlikely. After shocking critics with the lingering, sweat and psychedelic rock filled *Ultraviolence* (rather than doubling down on her pop sensibilities for success), the songstress’s next move would truly be a make-or-break mystery. She released the woozy, trap backed and notably poppy *High By The Beach* as the lead single to third studio album, which ~~[became her first top 10 debut](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6664035/omi-cheerleader-no-1-return-hot-100-lana-del-rey-debut)~~ was a minor hit for Lana. Initially, it was assumed the album would go back to the pop stylings of her debut, but that was a very wrong assumption.

If *Born To Die* was ecstasy, and *Ultraviolence* was weed, then *Honeymoon* is LSD and shrooms. It is an album that comes while it simultaneously goes. At a little over an hour, and stretched across 13 marvelous tracks and 1 interlude,  *Honeymoon* has more than enough time to transport you to a world where the space/time continuum is replaced by the space/self-loathing continuum. A main attribute of Lana’s music is how seemingly unaware she is of how tragic her love life is. While her first two records backed her lyrics with hefty amounts of production, *Honeymoon* dials it back and stretches the music, giving the listener time to soak in every sanguine-toned syllable and truly live in the mess of complications and tragedy *Honeymoon* thrives in. I think this is one of Lana’s more unappreciated albums (its my second favorite, behind UV), as the length and general slowness of the tracks can be hard to penetrate. However, every single track on this album is truly and vastly rich, from the storytelling, to the otherworldy Rick Nowels production, to Lana’s always shifting, always earnest voice.

# Marina - FROOT

*Note: We will be rating the studio version of FROOT and not the music video version. I will link the music video alongside the version you will be rating.*

Three years after her controversial record Electra Heart, Marina Diamandis released her third album Froot, her most critically acclaimed, and arguably most cohesive work. Peeling back the character she previously played, ditching her electropop sound, and stripping down to just herself and one other producer, all help to reveal a more authentic and vulnerable self.

Froot holds all of Marina's previously established talents dialed up to the maximum: her wailing and punchy vocals are immaculate, and her pen is as introspective as ever showing weight and complexity never seen by the artist before.
Although the era wasn't as commercially viable as Marina's previous alter egos, it was far from forgettable. The album was supported by the "Froot of the Month" campaign, where Marina released 6 songs, 1 each month, in anticipation of the album's released. And how can we forget [Marina & Charli XCX's iconic twitter beef?](https://www.spin.com/2016/03/charlie-xcx-marina-diamonds-froot-fight/)

Four years and another album after it's release, Froot remains the crowning jewel of Marina's discography, and demands to be enjoyed and savoured.

# Florence + the Machine - How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful

*Note: How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful is a visual album, and the music videos feature some altered versions of the songs. As such, if applicable, i will link the studio version that you will be rating, and link the music video afterwards. However, some songs are unaltered and will be linked normally.

*Ceremonials* was a very upfront album. There was an eerie focus on death, very upfront imagery of water throughout, and although the lyricism was sometimes abstract, it was sensibly so. The metaphors were well thought out but easy to grasp for the listener. It was loud, sensational, and an event. Following up what Florence herself called her peak was always going to be daunting. So the obvious idea for a follow-up? Create the exact opposite.

*How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful* is a bunch of catastrophes. In its truest sense, it is a breakup album, but its more than that. The implications of a breakup album isn’t just the breakup, but it’s how to move on, and figure out how to live life outside of the missing person. It’s exploring the concept of fulfillment, seeing what went wrong, and then thriving outside the disastrous relationship. Rather than using densely produced instrumentals, the productions were more sparse, and suited the poetic nature of Florence’s lyrics more than the previous albums did. She went more abstract and “out there” than her previous efforts (arguably, *Lungs also has some weird stuff goin’ on). There was a newfound focus on balladry, which was always poignant, always heart-wrenching. And although every track found 50 ways to be miserable, there was always at least a breath of hope underneath the ocean of travesty.
