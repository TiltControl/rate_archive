 **therokinrolla** (7.5): I see you fuckers trying to drag this cute little piece of art pop. Those shimmery synths are absolutely lovely, and that hook is ruthlessly catchy. While a bit of an oddity, its a really lovely little deep cut and did not deserve to be last, you dumbys. 

**1998tweety** (8): Although this isn't my favourite track to listen to on the album, it sounds super interesting and different from lots of songs I've heard before. The production feels sparse but also filling. My favourite thing though is the progression from Electra Heart. Yes, that era was a persona, but it depicted someone obsessed with fame and money; lines like "Don‚Äôt think I want what I used to want
Don‚Äôt think I need what I used to need
Don‚Äôt think I want what I used to want
Don‚Äôt think I see what I used to see", show a clear evolution from that time.
Not sure why exactly this went out last? I think we ALL had a different track in mind.

---
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (10): Ugh I love this song. So summery and perfect.
 
**didney-worl** (10): honestly reminds me of Bon Iver's self-titled album where every song sounds distinct and memorable and sometimes weird
 
**\_wailordfan** (9): Strange the songs I enjoy most from the album so far are named after colors.
 
**Solovrinne** (9): Always liked this one. The instrumentation is just a little bit bizarre and it just works.
 
**waluigiest** (9): okay yeah I like this
 
**spadesluke** (8.9): This is such a different track within the album as a whole, but I loove the sound of it
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): this is honestly SUCH a bop and the bad bitch energy is relatable. "Don't think I want what I used to want."
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Most of the Marina stans I personally know don‚Äôt like this song and say it‚Äôs the worst track on the album, and idk why, it‚Äôs pretty cute.
 
**vhqv1997** (8): the character progression from Oh No! to this whew
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I really like the overall sound of this one.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): maybe the most underrated song on this album
 
**rickdave16** (7): meh
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7): So I guess this song is kind of polarizing?  I love the sort of jittery, dreamy synths, though, not to mention the lyrics.  Also, I would love to hear an acoustic reimagining of this with a flute section.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): chill but a little fillery
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): Marina talking about her EH era in this song https://i.redd.it/8na18yl8bju21.jpg
-
 
**leviswift13** (6): the only song that has never fully stuck with me, i still appreciate how much the melody sticks. still, it is v shallow compared to the other tracks
 
**nickl00** (6): nice bridge
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Digg
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (6): Oofusoilyraminufemoilywatchusno
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6): We‚Äôre entering in to Froot‚Äôs somehow slightly more contested side now, and apparently Gold is one song where the controversy starts to settle in. It might not be all too experimental, but, oh boy, with that melodic delivery, I can definitely see why fans would fight over this. I‚Äôm not big on what she‚Äôs doing here, and I remain unconvinced that this is, er, gold, but it‚Äôs not irredeemable; I do find it pretty interesting to listen to.
 
**MrSwearword** (5): more pyrite than anything gold
 
**frogaranaman** (4): banana
 
**iamjezzac** (4): weakest song on the album. I just can‚Äôt like it.
 
**Leixander** (4): nice try of diversity in this album but doesn't work for me
 
**radiofan15** (3.2): I really don't want to see the 80s cheap Chinese children's movie that was the source of that back track.
 
**nick1372** (3): Kinda forgettable

 **therokinrolla** (4): Besides the fantastic cover of Leonard Cohen's Chelsea Hotel No 2, Lana's covers tend to fall short. Lana tends to sell her own lyrics better than others, and she often doesn't offer much new. This song isnt offensive, but tacked on at the end of a 14 song album that is over an hour long, its ultimately unecessary. 

**1998tweety** (7): I refuse to give Lana anything lower than a 7 but from the looks of it I don't think it made a difference. As rokin said, this just feels unnecessary. HM is a very long album, clocking in at over an hour, and Swan Song would've been a great closer, so why was this added onto the end? I don't dislike, it's just a little boring, and when it comes to covering songs you really need to blow it out of the park since expectations are higher. Anyway, go stream Doin' Time!

---
 
**didney-worl** (9.5): not her very best cover, but a strong one nonetheless
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Girl With Black Eye"](http://framingpainting.com/Uploadpic/Norman%20Rockwell/big/Girl%20with%20Black%20Eye.jpg)
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): At least the album ends on a high note.
 
**Leixander** (8.5): I adore the production in this, a nice addition to her already diverse discography.
 
**spadesluke** (8.5): I don't understand why this is so many people's least favorite from this album. I guess because it's a cover, but I like Lana's performance a lot on it.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): a cute cover
 
**leviswift13** (8): i LOVE when lana does nina simone! don't misunderstand her!
 
**rickdave16** (8): queen of covers
 
**Solovrinne** (8): I always enjoyed this cover as opposed to the popular opinion. I think it's a great closure to the album.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): This is a pretty cover, but I vastly prefer the original.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Where, oh where did all the covers go? Pop musicians used to cover other artists‚Äô songs quite frequently, but all that disappeared after Britney Spears released her cover of ‚ÄòI Love Rock and Roll‚Äô just two days before I was born. Why, people? That cover isn‚Äôt even that bad. At any rate, Don‚Äôt Let Me Be Misunderstood is a bit of an abrupt end to Honeymoon, but with that sassy title and fitting tribute to Nina Simone, I can‚Äôt bring myself to like it any less. And with that, Honeymoon ends!
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.5): I kind of love this reimagining of Don‚Äôt Let Me Be Misunderstood, especially as a closer to this particular album.  It was definitely a choice, but I think it‚Äôs a choice I can get behind‚Ä¶ in theory.  The vocal delivery is so affected, though, that it seriously detracts - it feels way too much Lana-the-character‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs probably also a deliberate choice, but to me, it just doesn‚Äôt gel with this particular song, and I think the overall effect would‚Äôve been way better with a more earnest, emotionally connected performance.
 
**nick1372** (7): Her choice of this track to cover really foreshadowed her mature outlook on L4L/NFR. It's a solid contribution to her discography
 
**skargardin** (7): issa cute cover
 
**waluigiest** (7): some of the orchestration really works, sometimes it‚Äôs bland but pleasant
 
**akanewasright** (6.5): I don‚Äôt hate this. But I‚Äôm fine with the fact that it‚Äôs probably going out first.
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): Feels like this belongs on Ultraviolence but in a boring way.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): stream Mr. Misunderstood!
 
**nickl00** (6): a nice cover to close the album
 
**vhqv1997** (6): Nina Simone outsold
 
**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): disappointing as a cover
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (5): honestly it's not a terrible cover but it's just sort of dry and doesn't do anything new with the song.
 
**FireLordAegon** (5): ~~Burnt Norton (Interlude):~~ 5 See! I can give Lana a subpar score
 
**iamjezzac** (5): her weakest cover to date
 
**slimboyfriend** (5): ....Miss Nina Simone she ain‚Äôt
 
**frogaranaman** (4): did not sound like a Lana song until she spoke
 
**radiofan15** (3.3): What a disrespect to the incomparable Miss Nina Simone‚Ä¶ sorry Lana but this is awful in every sense of the word
 
**MrSwearword** (1): a really weak and disappointing cover and a horrid closer

 **therokinrolla** (6): I am one of the few people in this rate, it seems, that has a profound enjoyment of Florence's ballads. Florence can such a since of ease somehow that is unshakeable. Long & Lost is where she loses me a bit. The melody, although nice, is incredibly repetitive and leaves not much to differentiate the verses and the chorus. The lyrics are quite frankly a bunch of nothing, i mean seriously read them, they sound even less eventful than they do during the song. This song ITSELF just feels lost, like it was cut off of something different, and better, and placed her as filler
Sad. 

**1998tweety** (7): Again, this itself isn't even a bad song, it just doesn't stack up to the other ballads on the album. It just kind of stays at one point the whole time and doesn't deviate from that. Not a bad thing, but in the context of the album it ends up getting drowned out. It's kind of filler-y and feels like background music, but I guess you kind of need that when the rest of the album is so packed?

---
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.5): Talk about an atmosphere.  This song runs the risk of getting a little repetitive, but then she saves it with the soaring vocals  in the bridge and final chorus.   I could listen to this for hours tbh and just get lost in that guitar groove.
 
**chihuahuazero** (9): Underrated.
 
**Leixander** (9): Contains one of her best vocal moments.
 
**leviswift13** (9): "but it's too late to come on home, are all those bridges old stones" is one of the best lyrics of her career
 
**rickdave16** (9): wow wow WOW this song is so beautiful
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): a necessary cooldown after the hectic mania of Delilah
 
**Solovrinne** (8.5): Following Delilah, this is where the album takes a turn for me. It's comparatively short to the rest of the album but it delivers its message succinctly without needing to be longer. I like the layering in the background.
 
**spadesluke** (8.4): Even more so that VS&S is this not a song I ever really listen to on its own, with such a slow, sad composition. That said, it's still a very introspective, emotional song, which is always what I live for with Florence.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (8): I like having two ballads surrounding Delilah, and to me this is the stronger of the two.
 
**vhqv1997** (8): This is a fine enough ballad, and the lightweight feel of it is very surprising for a Florence song, but I can't help but compare it to other tracks like Various Storms & Saints and St. Jude, which just does this slightly better
 
**nick1372** (7): This is kind of her "Someone Like You" and it really works
 
**waluigiest** (7): she hits it honestly
 
**survivorjdmarina** (6.5): Breezy, but a little boring.
 
**Raykel** (6): I'm just really not into her ballads
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6): im sorry rokin my laptop is running out of battery and this is dull but ily
 
**slimboyfriend** (5.5): snoozy
 
**MrSwearword** (5): boring but not the worst track in the rate
 
**nooodisaster** (5): I cant tell you what this sounds like.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Bengula Gothic](http://www.fontscape.com/pictures2/ef/BenguiatGothic.gif)
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I listened to this like three times because I kept forgetting it was playing before deciding that I just didn‚Äôt like it.
 
**nickl00** (4): I don't remember this song
 
**frogaranaman** (3): my brain when listening to this song
 
**radiofan15** (2.5): These kind of songs survive due to the atmosphere they create and how potent is the voice singing it‚Ä¶ unfortunately the atmosphere isn't there yet and the voice way too underutilized.

 **therokinrolla** (6): Imagine calling a song weed and not writing about the devils lettuce. I, for one, cannot. This song is cute and the concept is cute but it leaves a lot to be desired, especially songwriting-wise. 

**1998tweety** (9.5): A metaphor of weeds works perfectly on this album: gardens and flowers are often associated with love, but also with growth and prosperity. Tying back to the album title FROOT, Marina can't grow any because her garden is filled with weeds. There is a bit of sexual imagery going on there and things to do with fertility as well. As we've come to expect, the vocals are great, the lyrics are great, the production is great. I absolutely love a guitar solo as well; they used to be commonplace but rap features kind of killed them off. Even though it isn't really my favourite, the fact that its there is appreciated.

---
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I love weeds. I think they‚Äôre really neat and I want more songs about them. There‚Äôs a real dip in the quality of the songs on the album for a while but she finds her groove again starting here, this song is beautiful.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.9): queen of marijuana
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): like WEEEEEEEEDS
 
**Leixander** (9): Her voice is angelic in this.
 
**waluigiest** (9): the thesis is that marina and I are both sensitive hoes
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Okay, guys, why do y‚Äôall hate this? I don‚Äôt get it. This is a really good song. I mean, come on, just listen to it. Marina sounds like she‚Äôs actually having fun here. Whenever I listen to this, I get nothing except a nice, catchy deep cut with a strong melody! What‚Äôs wrong with you people? I can‚Äôt find anything here to dislike. Maybe y‚Äôall are just bitter about smelling weed in your dorms at 5 AM in the morning? SMH.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.5): Another song where the chorus is just one word or phrase repeated, with maybe a couple of ‚Äúyeah‚Äùs thrown in‚Ä¶ sigh. It really risks turning the song into background noise by the end. But with the way she sings those ‚Äúbaby‚Äùs in the bridge, and the guitar solo, and the verses, I can‚Äôt give this one a bad score.
 
**FireLordAegon** (7): Cannabis and guitar solos. Not bad.
 
**leviswift13** (7): i wish she had followed the trajectory of the verses more bc the chorus is a bit of a let down compared to them
 
**nickl00** (7): eh
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): I know it‚Äôs another late 90s/early 2000s female pop rock song, but idk I kinda like it!!
 
**vhqv1997** (7): The best thing about this song is the guitar that came in after the bridge
 
**MrSwearword** (6): she thought she did something with that "history comes back like weeds" which...k...
 
**nooodisaster** (6): the first 5 seconds are a 10, and then the rest is boring.
 
**Raykel** (6): I've honestly just been bored these last few tracks
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (5): this song feels like it doesn't really go anywhere.
 
**iamjezzac** (5): gets somewhat repetitive unfortunately and doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere
 
**rickdave16** (5): nope nope nope I hate this song so much
 
**Solovrinne** (5): It's okay. I think the chorus becomes a bit insufferable with the refrain. Holding the "ee" note almost never sounds pleasant to me. The guitar solo is nice though.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Lyft
 
**radiofan15** (4.5): Sorry Ms Catherine Zeta Jones but this is awful‚Ä¶ at least that guitar solo kinda sort-of mediocrily slaps.
 
**nick1372** (4): Good lyrics spoiled by annoying chorus
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (3.2): meh
 
**frogaranaman** (3): marijauna
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (1): Holy shit, please make it stop.

 **therokinrolla** (8)

**1998tweety** (10): I don't know the name for the vocal effects on this track but I love it. The lyrics are great on this too, throwbacks to The Family Jewels with lines like "White like a diamond, black like coal
Cut like a jewel, yeah I repair myself", and "And all the other jewels around me
They astounded me at first", add another layer to this song, just like how Gold showed a progression from Electra Heart, Solitaire does the same thing to a level with Marina's first album. The production on this track is also minimal, but that works well cause it pushes the lyrics and Marina's vocals to the forefront, which to me were the standouts from the track.

---
 
**didney-worl** (10): really beautiful
 
**leviswift13** (10): so close to being my 11. solitaire is the rare song that literally took my breath away the first time i heard it. the lyrics are poetic and evocative and personal, the production is like its own magical universe and her voice is just heavenly.
 
**Solovrinne** (10): She brought the heat with this one. It's ethereal and so chill.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of card games
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): a mood
 
**nickl00** (9): one of my instant favorites cause I related so much
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (9): So just to make this point again: what I‚Äôve noticed from listening to this album end-to-end multiple times for the purposes of this rate (not the way I usually consume music), is that there‚Äôs this amazing cohesion in the production on this album, with so many songs having these slightly distorted/jittery/underwater effects and/or kind of icy/sparkly/shattered-glass effects.  There are even hints of it in songs like Can‚Äôt Pin Me Down which, on the surface, have a totally different mood and sound palette.  This song is the epitome of that ‚Äúfrosty‚Äù sound palette, and it‚Äôs fucking amazing, what more can I say?  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit all I wanna do is get drunk and silent‚Äù?  A mood.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8): never understood why people hated this tbh
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (8): I enjoyed this more than I remembered. I really like the chorus.
 
**nooodisaster** (8): The filter they use for this is soooo good & makes me want to play RainyMood EVERY TIME
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Another seemingly loathed song off the second half of Froot. There is no way I can look at this song without thinking of Solitaire by The Carpenters, which is a song I heard on the radio when I was a kid way too often. I actually sort of consider this the better, slower Gold; most people I know dislike the song (maybe they just have traumatic memories of being forced to play solitaire after the Internet went down) but I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what Marina‚Äôs trying to do here aside from it being slightly too slow.
 
**spadesluke** (7.2): This song takes a while to get to the good parts, so I usually wind up skipping it, but I can't deny that by the time the bridge rolls around Marina's emotions really shine
 
**rickdave16** (7): not my favorite Marina ballad but not a bad song by any means
 
**vhqv1997** (7): I think this show has a nice idea and the writing is of course good, but the production on her voice seems unnecessary, the instrumentals around the bridge are incredible though, very atmospheric and breathtaking
 
**waluigiest** (7): I love that it sounds like she‚Äôs singing through a mcdonalds drive thru
 
**survivorjdmarina** (6): Never liked this song tbh
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Bratz
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This song starts off really cool but then once the beat kicks in it just kind of doesn‚Äôt go anywhere.
 
**nick1372** (5): It's ok. Has the same problem as most Marina songs in that it kind of gestures at a metaphor and makes you connect the dots.
 
**slimboyfriend** (5): honestly forgot this song was on the album‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ whoops‚Ä¶..
 
**frogaranaman** (3): grapefruit
 
**radiofan15** (2.5): How could an album loose this much steam so easily?
 
**MrSwearword** (1): this song sucks, especially the delivery of the chorus; it's just so ugly and horrendously delivered.

 **therokinrolla** (8.5): **DO YOU REALLY WANT ME TO WRITE A FEMINIST ANTHEM? IM HAPPY IN THE KITCHEN COOKING DINNER FOR MY HUSBAND!!!**

Madre M√çA, Miss MARINA, Bajale! Perhaps one of the best single lines Marina has ever written. Coming off the back of the feminist album, Electra Heart, perhaps fans were prepared for more music about sex being good and men being bad. But nah, you can't pin her down. It's truly meta, and its something only Marina could pull off. Imagine any other popstar trying to say that. First, you gotta rule out the ones without feminist anthems in their music already. Then, you have to find someone that wouldn't feel to kitschy saying it. Katy could never in a million years say that, Gaga would just disappoint everyone, Lana would bring about more anti-feminist dialogue. Nah, its only Marina, the proud and proven feminist, that is already known for lines that give you whiplash. The rest of the song is good too, but that single lyric could topple nations.

**1998tweety** (8): Can't Pin Me Down, continues with a bit of that weird sound we saw in Gold. I like that; putting those songs back to back on the album is a good choice since I'm already feeling that vibe. In terms of lyrics, I like this track. It's sassy, something which we haven't seen a whole ton from Marina in the past. The track bops and the production is good. Overall a good song attacking a different subject matter.

---
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Career highlight for Ms. And The Diamonds
 
**treadwater11** (10): I love the sentiment of this song
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): I mean, this song mentions being a clown, which is what I am, so it gets points for that.
 
**leviswift13** (9): the vocal production is the only thing holding me back from a full 10, but it is still so good. this is the clever, smart, playful, funny marina we all deserve!
 
**Leixander** (8.5): time to back up MOTHERFUCKER
 
**rickdave16** (8.5): ok this is a feminist BOP
 
**waluigiest** (8): clown hoe anthem
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Holy shit! What a messy song! Can you hear my nervous chuckle in the distance? I‚Äôm about to say that this is a well-intentioned song, and to be fair, it might be (Marina really is the kind of woman you aren‚Äôt able to pin down all that easily) but that feminist line is way too edgy for me to give this as high of a score as I otherwise would have. This is a very good song with a very good chorus, but some problematic elements are enough to lower its merit a notch for me. Also, remember when those guys pinned Elite down?
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): motherfucker
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.5): To be totally honest, I don‚Äôt find the subject matter of this song all that interesting - being super unique and tired of being pigeonholed is like, yeah, cool, heard it before.  Like, I don‚Äôt get really emotionally invested or pumped up in sympathy listening to this song or anything.  But the instrumentals and melodies are so strong, I don‚Äôt really mind.
 
**nickl00** (7): marina saying fuck saved this song
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): Is ShE a FeMiNiSt????
 
**Solovrinne** (7): Marina and her drawn out one-syllable vocals... I swear! I like this feminist-ish anthem though.
 
**chihuahuazero** (6): When the MPAA only allows you one f-bomb on your album.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (6): This song is okay but it doesn't really stand out to me at all.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): her LWYMMD arrived
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Lands‚Äô End
 
**FireLordAegon** (4.5): I gave her like two points cause I laughed when she said motherfucker.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I appreciate that she had something to say. I think.
 
**nooodisaster** (4): honestly a MESS, very r/im14andthisisdeep, and worst of all boring melody & production
 
**frogaranaman** (3): pineapple
 
**nick1372** (3): A song like this doesn't fit with the production at ALL. Also more vague lyrics?? Halsey does the same thing but it works because she actually sounds angry
 
**radiofan15** (2.7): WOW this is blander than hospital food.
 
**MrSwearword** (1): she's trying to be Hard Out Here era Lily Allen but Marina does *not* have the songwriting to back that shit up

 **therokinrolla** (6.5): this>>>better than revenge 

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love the rock edge on this, Marina's vocals surprisingly work well on a track like this, possibly cause she doesn't push it too much so it comes off as natural. I read that this was the first song written on the album and it shows. It does have elements that we saw in Electra Heart, but Better Than That still feels like a part of FROOT. A bit more of that sass we saw on Can't Pin Me Down is present here, although I'd argue this track works better. The lyrics are a bit stronger and the rock-style helps push that edge even further. Marina really is a queen of multiple genres huh.

---
 
**Leixander** (10): drag her, slay her, sipping on that truth tea hunty
 
**MrSwearword** (10): finally, a song that doesn't suck and stands out for good reasons.
 
**nickl00** (10): her voice is great on this
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of dragging ellie goulding
 
**FireLordAegon** (9): Took back the pity points I gave this album after listening to this bop
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): This has always been a bop because of its production, but I don‚Äôt think the message has aged well *at all*...
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Oh, my God! This song...this song is about Ellie Goulding! I‚Äôm fucking hollering. What a crossover. It looks like that Marina has her very own Better Than Revenge. Interesting! The tea this spills is...delicious. (I‚Äôm a bit wary of her lyrical content, especially since Marina gives  me anti-feminist vibes throughout this album, but hey, the woman herself said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not passing judgement on her sexual life‚Äô, so maybe that counts for something?). A very good and very fierce pop rock song with all the fury to launch a thousand thinkpieces.
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): Misery Business & this song being problematic favs: https://youtu.be/rGguefhSq1Q?t=131
 
**spadesluke** (8.2): I've always thought this song was a bop, but it does kinda have some unfortunate slut-shame-leaning lyrics. Marina's stated that it wasn't her intention, which I am inclined to believe given that this is the same album that features the song Froot, but it is always important to acknowledge flaws even if they weren't intentional. Much better than Girls in that regard though.
 
**skargardin** (8): Everything song aimed at Ellie Goulding turns into gold
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8): If Forget has the best melodies on the album, this might have the best groove. (Funny that those two songs are both the most ‚Äúrock‚Äù-ish, with some really well-utilized electric guitars.)  Along with I‚Äôm a Ruin, to me this is one of the most interesting songs on the album in terms of the emotions/psychology/subject matter.
 
**didney-worl** (7.5): I forget about this song a lot :/
 
**rickdave16** (7.5): I want to like this song more than I do
 
**leviswift13** (7): like better than revenge, but british and not as vicious
 
**nick1372** (7): She sounds so good on this one!! It's a little unclear who the "you" she's referring to is, which is kinda distracting.
 
**Solovrinne** (7): The drama about Ellie Goulding was hilarious. She's talking to her old Electra Heart self and I respect that.
 
**vhqv1997** (7): I don't really know how to feel about the sorta slut-shaming message of this song, it's not like people like these don't exist, but the fact she has to clarify that she's not slut-shaming in the bridge is kinda awkward. But even other than that, musically this song just is not very interesting, especially when compared to the rest of the album.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): This is were the album starts to lose steam for me
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): rhyming ‚Äúsad‚Äù with ‚Äúmad‚Äù.... she really foreshadowed the lyrical content of love + fear
 
**tapdancingpig** (6): I love the rock edge to this song, but the lyrics also make me just a little bit uncomfortable.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Nesquik
 
**radiofan15** (5.1): I think she can do better than this but this album is really testing my patience.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): damn she really came for her huh
 
**waluigiest** (5): trying to wade through the layers of wokeness here but I‚Äôve just decided this isn‚Äôt really it
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): Women, am I right? This song does nothing for me.
 
**letsallpoo** (3): ended ellie
 
**frogaranaman** (2): strawberry
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1.2): musically yes marina you can do better than that
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (0): "I ain't passing judgement on her sexual life" you sure about that Marina?

 **therokinrolla** (9.5): My poor sweety Swan Song Im sorry those rat Popheads did you so dirty. I must admit, this song being second to last on a 1 and a quarter hour long album of 50 bpm tracks does not help her. This song really reminds me of "Anything We Want" off of Fiona Apple's The Idler Wheel: they're both penultimate tracks, they're both relatively happy songs stuck inside otherwise clinically depressed albums, and they're both about running away with someone knowing that just the two of them can achieve whatever the fuck they want, and be happy doing it. Lana's is a bit more cynical though. "Why work so hard when you can just be free?" is simultaneously haunting and kinda humiliating. Plus, Lana's vocal delivery here is excellent, and works with the hazy production better than many tracks on this record. This song feels so at ease in a way that not many Lana songs are, and I can really appreciate that.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Long dreary slow orchestral songs have been a staple among Lana's discography. Swan Song is an example of that style done well. On the other hand though, if you're already someone who doesn't like Lana, you'll probably hate this song. The chorus is super repetitive, and if I'm being honest her vocals aren't exactly the best there (although I do recognize that it's intended and adds to the song). This really really really should've been the closer to the album. First of all, it would mean we wouldn't get the Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood cover, and Swan Song suits that position so much better. Putting the song with the line "And I will never sing again" as the last one on the album makes so much more sense; some people might speculate if Lana was done making music (probably not but it would've given her some free promo).

---
 
**nooodisaster** (9.5): Epic.
 
**Leixander** (9): Simply beautiful.
 
**MrSwearword** (9): certainly sounds like a swan song and should've closed the album instead of what the fuck we got...a bit samey like the others but for the 3rd time it isn't bad.
 
**rickdave16** (9): queen of swans
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): One of the first stan Twitter gays that I followed on Tumblr years back (it had to be when I was thirteen, what a cursed age) was undergoing a process of unstanning Lana when Honeymoon was released, and once they posted a clapping emoji in response to Lana saying ‚ÄòI will never sing again!‚Äô. That was rather rude, because this song is lit. It‚Äôs kind of deceitful, being the penultimate track on Honeymoon when it‚Äôs supposed to be titled Swan Song, but the drama here is very enjoyable; you can‚Äôt have everything in life.
 
**FireLordAegon** (8): Don't you ever think about quitting music and release NFR already.
 
**leviswift13** (8): i love how dramatic and ridiculous it is and how fully committed it is to its dramatics. this is the lana that i love, the combination of supreme songwriting and high stakes
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): this song is nonexistent in my memory
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): It‚Äôs probably the most forgettable song on this album tbh
 
**iamjezzac** (7): the ‚Äúand I will never sing again‚Äù line scared the shit out of us initially
 
**nick1372** (7): There's a song on every Lana album where she cops out of writing a chorus and just repeats the song title over and over again. This one works far better than most of the others in her discography but she should have grown out of it by this point.
 
**Solovrinne** (7): The opening is gorgeous, but the chorus falls short to me.
 
**spadesluke** (6.5): This is the only song in this rate that I really felt that I needed to relisten to, as it's the only one I don't have in my library and listen to on a decently regular basis (along with High By The Beach, but I've developed enough of an opinion on it based on how popular it is among Lana fans). This definitely counts against it, because I don't find this song very noteworthy or memorable. That said, there were some production elements that I found interesting on this listen, so I may need to give it a bit more time to let it grow on me as I usually do with Lana
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): at least it's not as meh as the dula peep one
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (6): a bit too long but I still like it. However, you have a song called swan song, and it's not the last song on your album?? I'm not sure if it's stupid or iconic but wow it sure is something.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Untitled"](https://secure.img2-fg.wfcdn.com/im/36776215/compr-r85/2351/23513951/going-out-by-norman-rockwell-painting-print-on-wrapped-canvas.jpg)
 
**waluigiest** (6): not as fresh, but not bad for sure
 
**radiofan15** (5.6): Just like expected, this swan song goes absolutely nowhere‚Ä¶ this would better left at the writing stages.
 
**nickl00** (5): I've always thought this contradicted the lyrics of high by the beach so for that alone I don't like the song
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (5): Meh.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): ariel after ursula stole her voice
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): lana saying "I will never sing again" is her drop kicking the low hanging fruit into the ground and me still wanting to grab it
 
**frogaranaman** (3): Sufjan did it better, ping me
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Wow she sounds REALLY bad here. Like this is the worst I‚Äôve heard her sound and this melody sucks.

 **therokinrolla** (5): I'll be honest, i loathe this song. It begins decently enough, as a mildly uplifting after a sequence of tragedies. But the humming, and the one word, repeating, unecessary chorus, god it all feels so kitschy. It feels like it'd just be better as an electropop song, but it isn't, its some kind of lumbering, vaguely throwback song with nothing to offer. 

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is by no means a bad song, it just feels mediocre and bland compared to the rest of the album. That's how boring the song is, I really don't know what else to say about it. 

---
 
**chihuahuazero** (10): I know y‚Äôall eliminate this Day 1 and that is a mistake. The chorus is serving big Adult Alternate teas in the best way, this captures the mood of struggling with breaking up with the guy you should break up with, and the fishing metaphors. The fishing.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): underrated and one of the strongest on the album in terms of lyrics
 
**Solovrinne** (9.5): This song hits home for me. Being all torn up from being lovesick is a mood.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (9): This feels really fresh and light after the first half of this album
 
**rickdave16** (9): AND I'M CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHT
 
**spadesluke** (8.5): This song doesn't bring quite as much to the album in my opinion, but it's still very well performed, and certainly isn't a song a dislike listening to.
 
**leviswift13** (8): the fact that this song, with its cathartic chorus and lovely, lilting melody, is the worst song on this album speaks to just how good hbhbhb is.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): A nice little nostalgic bop
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): I could not identify this song was called Caught for the longest time, because with Florence‚Äôs grandiose accent and way of singing, I thought for sure that she was saying ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt keep karma, I can‚Äôt keep sin‚Äô. Curses! You can add this into a pile of songs from this rate that everybody dislikes as opposed to myself; this isn‚Äôt the best song on How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful for sure, but it‚Äôs a good ballad that I would probably never skip.
 
**radiofan15** (7.7): Cutesy little song that's quite unsubstantial but also relaxing and atmospheric to a degree.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like those ‚Äúoohs‚Äù that come in towards the end.
 
**MrSwearword** (7): beige but pleasant enough to not knock it for being underwhelming
 
**nick1372** (7): I was going through the lyrics for this one and thinking "these lyrics are kind of basic for a Florence song" and then she hit me with "Then you leave my head, crawl out the bed / You subconscious solipsist" and I was dead on arrival
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7): The choral harmonies on the chorus here might be among the best on this album (and that‚Äôs saying something), and it‚Äôs a pleasant enough song to listen to, but it doesn‚Äôt really grab me.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [HB3 songs as typefaces: Daylight](http://e-daylight.jp/fonts/type/a/img/astley.gif)
 
**vhqv1997** (7): I skip this song everytime I listen to the album. Not because it's not good, I just think it's in the wrong album and kinda breaks the flow of the whole thing a bit with how stunted it is
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): and I'm filler
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): cute hook
 
**waluigiest** (6): less impressive than a lot of the album
 
**tapdancingpig** (5.5): The only song on this album that I could do without.

 **therokinrolla** (9) 

**1998tweety** (9.5): I don't know why but this song reminds me so much of Teen Idle, vocally and sonically it sounds similar but both stiff retain their original styles. Lyrically this is probably one of Marina's strongest songs ever, this is the kind of song that's truly meant to be felt. It's supposed to get you really some kind of way that makes you super uncomfortable. Again, we hear some more of that rock/guitar-styled instrumentation, I'm really starting to love that on Marina, its a really strong fit. Overall this is a great song and a great closer to an amazing album.

---
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): wow mood
 
**MrSwearword** (10): it is moving, so she closed on a great note
 
**Solovrinne** (10): What a TRACK. I'm hard pressed to give this an 11. The lyrics are some of her best. Everybody dies.
 
**didney-worl** (9): wow this is a really good rate
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The lyrics for this one are really cool (the line about buying forever twice made me smile) and it‚Äôs a great closer for the album. It feels epic and expansive, but I kind of wish it wasn‚Äôt a love song though because that seems like a copout for the topic. I do like how she ties the idea of connection with others into immortality but I dunno, something about it doesn‚Äôt quite connect for me. Still, I like it.
 
**leviswift13** (9): i love when marina gets philosophical. it is romantic, lush, dark and still hopeful. the perfect conclusion to an album that is centered so heavily around the pain that comes from love.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): This is a pretty nice closer.
 
**spadesluke** (8.7): Much like Solitaire, this song takes a bit too long to get to the good parts of the song, but when it gets there it slaps pretty damn hard
 
**rickdave16** (8): great closer and beautiful song
 
**waluigiest** (8): ‚ÄúI wanna be a silk flower‚Äù is really her whole brand
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Marina returns to becoming downright poetic in this very pleasing, if slightly musically mundane closer that appeals to just about the right source of sentimentality. Just like how Happy focused on Marina herself, Immortal extends that focus to the rest of the universe, and Marina shows here that she can be wiser than you‚Äôd expect her to be, which is saying something, considering some of the lyrics on this record! Okay, I‚Äôm sorry. That was a roast. I get people who say this is boring, but I do enjoy listening to what she has to say...
 
**chihuahuazero** (7): Marina released this at New Year‚Äôs.
 
**iamjezzac** (7): beautiful, though listening to the lyrics used to trigger panic attacks
 
**nick1372** (7): Wow this album takes a dark turn towards the end. Her voice sounds really good on this one so that makes up for the lyrics which are not nearly as clever as the track right before it.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (7): Look, I want to love this song unequivocally‚Ä¶ but somehow the production doesn‚Äôt totally work for me.  Although I hate to say it, it starts to feel kind of plodding by the end.  Which is a huge disservice to the song‚Äôs potential, but there you go.
 
**vhqv1997** (6): Rather die, can't relate lol
 
**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Not as good as y‚Äôall are gonna say it is... it's not that profound
 
**CarlieScion** (5): fall out boy ft demi lovato who
 
**nooodisaster** (5): sis dying is like the most primal fear u aint special.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): FROOT songs as misspelled brands: Fiverr
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (5): this paled in comparison to ship to wreck i'm so sorry
 
**nickl00** (4): I don't remember this song either
 
**frogaranaman** (3): star fruit
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (1): Ugh these lyrics... "everybody dies" thanks marina didn't know that! "If i could by forever, I would by it twice" what does that even mean...
 
**radiofan15** (0): What a proper way to finish an album like this‚Ä¶

 **therokinrolla** (9.5): Wtf y'all I love this omg. Sure she says ghetto several times too many, but its very fun. It honestly feels like a dance bop with its bpm halved (seriously, imagine the chorus sped up and with a dance beat it works i swear). The Lana sub thinks very differently of this song, and would place it in the top 5 generally so there's an interesting contrast here. Also I like to imagine this song being about Azealia Banks bc that'd be funny. 

**1998tweety** (8): First of all, the transition from Freak into this is amazing. Honestly I don't really have a strong opinion on this. Personally I don't really care for the ghetto lyric but I get why people have issues with it. It does bop a bit which I appreciate, I imagine it could've sounded so much better if it had a little more of a kick into it. 

---
#Ghetto
**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): YOU ARE SO GHETTO
 
**nick1372** (8): The notes she hits on this one... an underappreciated gem. Although "Baby, you're so ghetto" is a terrible line.

**vhqv1997** (8): Does Lana understand what "ghetto" means? Do I? Does anyone?

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I should get bad vibes from Lana (who‚Äôs the whitest pop girl to grace our community) uttering the words ‚Äòbaby you‚Äôre so ghetto‚Äô right into my ears, but that‚Äôs not really the reason why I‚Äôm not as big of a fan of this as all the songs that came before it. In so as much Lana songs can snap, it just...does not...snap that much. It‚Äôs still good, but it‚Äôs the closest to a stereotypical Lana song you can find here, and all of Lana‚Äôs albums are very, very stereotypically Lana. So, uh, it makes me a little bored. Please forgive me, Rokin.
 
**iamjezzac** (7): it‚Äôs sonically pleasing though not as focused conceptually as Lana‚Äôs best songs (loses a point because of the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so ghetto‚Äù lyric atrocity)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): did she just say you're so ghetto üíÄ
 
**waluigiest** (6): chill bop, but ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so ghetto‚Äù kills it for me lmfao

**cubascastrodistrict** (5): Incredibly similar to freak. Good vibe but... "You're so ghetto???" Lana honey...

**ImADudeDuh** (1): idk if im delusional or just a bit triggered by the use of ghetto, but is it just me or is this song a bit racist, especially if its about Azaelia

#Azealia Banks
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): the fact that this is allegedly an azealia diss track makes me scream
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): You‚Äôre so Azealia Banks

**radiofan15** (9.4): Lana should do a jazz album, I don't care if they're originals or standards‚Ä¶ but if they're originals all of them must be Azaelia shades like this one.

**Leixander** (7.5): There were rumors that she wrote this for Azealia Banks. We all know what happened afterwards.

#And Everyone Else 
**Solovrinne** (8): The transition from Freak into Art Deco is to die for. I think this song is lacking polish which stops it from a higher score.
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (8): At first I didn‚Äôt know if I enjoyed this so much because it‚Äôs sitting in contrast to Freak, which I hate, but after a few standalone listens I can conclude: this is a solid track.  Lana‚Äôs voice is exceptionally lovely, and the spacey atmospheric production actually works for me on this one.

**rickdave16** (7.5): just kinda boring tbh
 
**nooodisaster** (7): WHY? *insert vine of that preacher supercut saying why over and over*
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Art Critic"](http://www.daytonartinstitute.org/sites/default/files/RockwellHR_Art-Critic_9_10.gif)
 
**akanewasright** (6): See, I like this song, but there‚Äôs not a lot to it. I don‚Äôt feel *that* strongly about it. I do love the transition from the last song, though.
 
**leviswift13** (6): another song that doesn't do anything new or particularly exciting with lana's very specific world
 
**nickl00** (6): the production is nice enough that it carries kinda meh vocals
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): This feels like it was written via a Lana Del Rey Mad-Lib.
 
**frogaranaman** (4): on god I would fail a test trying to describe the differences between Lana songs
 
#National Anthem Sweetie 
**MrSwearword** (0): if not for National Anthem, this is Lana's worst song. The line "Art Deco, you're so ghetto" is tasteless, badly written and fucking stupid. TRASH.

 **therokinrolla** (10): This used to be my favorite Honeymoon track, although I later decided the refrain is a little to repetitive for my tastes. PLus I still don't understand the verses. But I do understand the giant climax here, the one where Lana's voice reaches its absolute highest. It is lit rully stunning. It honestly gives me chills, and if the rest of the song felt so penetrating then it probably would be the best. It's stil damn good though.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow. I see a lot of people complaining about the amount of repetition on this track, but I feel like that's sort of the point? I feel like repeating the lines "God knows I tried" over and over again are supposed to resemble the repetitive nature of a prayer (or maybe this is just me trying to find a justification to defend a song that I like). This song is so atmospheric and emotional and stunning and it really does take you on a journey. I 100% believe that Lana really did try as hard as she could. When Lana says "So ;et there be light"...that was *that* moment.

---
 
#Not Sure If This Was Shade But I SCREAMED At It 
**nick1372** (9): The crickets really make this one work
-
**gannade** (10): this is like Terrence Loves Yous sister song but it is so much better
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): You know what, I originally gave this an 8.5 and had a lot of complaints about how the song ‚Äúis frustrating in the same way that Terrence Loves You is because it just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ QUITE go as far as it so clearly wants to go‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI  wanted to be transported out of my body all the way into space, and instead she levitated me a couple of feet off the ground‚Äù‚Ä¶ but having listened to it a bunch more times‚Ä¶ fuck it.  It‚Äôs perfect.  I do stand by this sentiment from my original comment: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely the closest I‚Äôve come to feeling like Lana is actually present in the music and isn‚Äôt just some bored actress they stuck in the vocal booth with a handful of Ambien to keep her company.‚Äù
 
**treadwater11** (10): so hauntingly beautiful, the bridge and final chorus transcend me to heaven
 
**akanewasright** (9): This song is going to go out on day 1, but I don‚Äôt think it deserves that. It‚Äôs simple, but I think it‚Äôs haunting, and Lana sounds incredible.
 
**rickdave16** (9): god her VOCALS on this track are other-worldly
 
**spadesluke** (8.6): While the lyrics on this song are often repetitive in theory, I think Lana imbues them with enough emotion throughout that they don't overstay their welcome too terribly
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I really do adore the moments on Honeymoon where Lana just decides to try jazz out a little bit (we need more jazz influence in mainstream pop and hip hop right about now, fellas! Amy Winehouse didn‚Äôt release Frank for this!) and God Knows I Tried is another stunning example of how good she is at stepping into the genre. It‚Äôs not a song that‚Äôs meant to be a show-stopping moment, but it certainly is enjoyable.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): Ok, this is a p sad track. It does feel more personal and reading the lyrics makes me feel some sympathy for Lana. I will still continue to not like her as a whole tho.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): While beautiful, much like most of this album, I don‚Äôt come back to it often.
 
**waluigiest** (8): huge, plays with the sound palettes she already established, this is just good content
 
**radiofan15** (7.6): Has Lana ever covered *My Baby Shot Me Down* before? If she hasn't, she should‚Ä¶ it would sound the same than this song but better.
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.5): I love the fact that this song could come from a western scored by Ennio Morricone. I can see very vividly a man on horsebacl riding into the sunset after winning the duel but not the girl.
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): Melodically I really do like this but I also want it to end 2 minutes in.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (7): I like a lot about this song, but it repeats itself too much by the end and the verses feel mediocre. I think a really killer bridge could've pulled it together, but it just doesn't have it.
 
**iamjezzac** (7): excellent until it gets repetitive
 
**leviswift13** (7): i appreciate the guitars and the lyrics, but it feels a little been there done that for lana
 
**MrSwearword** (7): atmospheric but a track that's a bit of a chore to get through
 
**nickl00** (7): again, too slow, but her voice sounds amazing
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Father And Boy"](https://dyn1.heritagestatic.com/lf?set=path%5B1%2F7%2F5%2F7%2F1757269%5D%2Csizedata%5B850x600%5D&call=url%5Bfile%3Aproduct.chain%5D)

 **therokinrolla** (10): The bond theme that got away... This is one of Lana's best written songs lyrically, honest to God. Theres nothing that doesnt hit 100% for me, and the outro dear god THE OUTRO. "You count to three, while they're all dyin" how fucking climactic that is in the context of the song. "Youre cold to touch" and then the song just settling down into silence... Its brilliant. 

**1998tweety** (8.5): Lana spilled tea when she said there's only 24 hours in a day, ugh her mind. This is one of those Lana songs where he amazing lyrics don't get the chance to shine through that much (which is evident by the lack of lyrics compared to her usual stuff), but that's fine because her voice and the atmosphere completely make up for it. Everyone is calling this the James Bond theme that got away, and I agree. It has a very cinematic element to it and I'm reminded a fair bit of Skyfall (but obviously a more chill version).

#I Don't Watch Movies
**spadesluke** (10): I don't feel like I hear this song brought up very often, which is a shame because I absolutely love this song. It does take a little bit to build to the good parts, but since I'm listening to Lana anyway I can forgive that. And goddamn is that bridge intense. Every time I listen to this song I feel like I'm playing the female lead in a romance being pursued by a sexy, muscular Spanish man

**nick1372** (9): We really get to see Angry Lana on this one and I love it

**MrSwearword** (8): again, cute but cute next gorgeous...
 
**nickl00** (8): amazing vocals over string production
 
**skargardin** (8): Even though I absolutely love Honeymoon, this is where the album really starts to drag, there‚Äôs almost no guarantee that i can keep up focus for the last few tracks.

**waluigiest** (8): WHEN THE HORN COMES IN I NUT
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The quirky noises in the background save this one for me but I grow tired.

**nooodisaster** (7): lmao she is P E to the T T Y and I live.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Going Out"](https://secure.img2-fg.wfcdn.com/im/36776215/compr-r85/2351/23513951/going-out-by-norman-rockwell-painting-print-on-wrapped-canvas.jpg)
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Lyrically, I think this is one of the most scathing songs on Honeymoon, and I‚Äôm also pleased that we‚Äôve evidently reached a point in Lana‚Äôs career where she actually calls people who treat her badly out, which was already exemplified earlier by the brilliance of High By The Beach. Unfortunately, this downgrades into being the worst song on the album because the melody is sadly rather boring. A 7 isn‚Äôt bad at all, though!
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (6.5): See, the high-contrast intensity of the final minute of this and The Blackest Day was what I was expecting on God Knows I Tried and Religion.
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6): And here we have another that sounds like a lonesome cowboy exploring old mining towns and drinking in saloons. The weakest of the three with this vibe, Clint Eastwood would be sad.
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnet 138 remains unbothered
 
**Solovrinne** (6): A rather forgettable track with strange lyrical choices. Sorry Lana.
 
**vhqv1997** (6): I can imagine somebody flamenco dancing to this but being really low-energy doing it
 
**leviswift13** (5): "if you lie down with dogs, you'll get fleas" is brilliant, but the rest of the song just seems stiff and lifeless

 **therokinrolla** (8): At this point, talking about sex through religious imagery is just going through the motions for any pop star. It's a pervasive idea, and one that I'm not quite sick of yet, as this one is pretty good too. It seems a little strangely straightforward in a way, with a simple no nonsense hook and clear cut if unmemorable production. It's perhaps a little fillery, by this point we've heard a ton of high pitched hooks from Lana in this album, but its filler done right.

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's a nice chill song but it's not really special and it doesn't really stand out. It does add to a bit of an overarching theme about religion throughout the album but besides that, it doesn't have much purpose. Sorry it's kind of filler-y! Honestly looking back, I should've been a lot harsher on this cause the lyrics are just a bunch of cliches, but Lana sells it so well so she's forgiven a bit.

---
 
**Leixander** (10): Dalai Lana won.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): One of her best songs and criminally underrated
 
**skargardin** (10): This is severely underrated, if yall let this flop ...
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Oh, that unexpected twist of the melody in ‚Äúhallelujah, I need your love‚Äù‚Ä¶ yesssss.  As per usual, I‚Äôd like those last couple of choruses to be just a little bit bigger, but not enough to deduct points for it.
 
**iamjezzac** (9): we stan a blowjob innuendo
 
**Solovrinne** (9): The hallelujah's in the post chorus absolutely make this song.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): A cute trip-hop banger that also sounds ethereal
 
**MrSwearword** (8): it's sort of emblematic about this era Lana; it's fine for what it is but it's samey although not entirely lacking in quality for the most part.
 
**nick1372** (8): No one can pull off a religious blowjob song like Lana. Maybe Hozier on a good day
 
**rickdave16** (8): the album picks back up here thankfully
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Saying Grace"](https://static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/norman-rockwell-saying-grace-1951-ftr.jpg)
 
**waluigiest** (8): yo are you hearing these notes
 
**radiofan15** (7.4): Although this is a romantic song at heart, it has to be one of the less-romantic love songs I've heard on a long time!
 
**akanewasright** (7): At this point, I need to throw in a few lower scores to make it seem like I‚Äôm being fair. I like this song and I think it‚Äôs important for the album, but I would never listen to it on its own and some of the lyrics make me uncomfortable. This does have some of Lana‚Äôs best vocals on the album, though.
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (7): The instrumental brings this song up for me. It's still a bit too long imo, it doesn't justify the time spent listening to it.
 
**leviswift13** (7): her voice sounds lovely against the acoustic guitar, especially when she shows off her upper range
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7): Another track that just oozes with the influence of Spaghetti Westerns. Not surprised I'm drawn to these tracks the most as I love that genre so much.
 
**vhqv1997** (7): The back half of this album is starting to wear me down, I feel like I would appreciate this album way more if she showed some restraint and left one of two songs out, with this being one of them
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): The Borborites or Borborians (Greek: ŒíŒøœÅŒ≤ŒøœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøŒØ; also Koddians; in Egypt, Phibionites; in other countries, Barbalites, Secundians, Socratites, etc.) were a libertine Christian Gnostic sect, said to be descended from the Nicolaitans. The word Borborite comes from the Greek word Œ≤œåœÅŒ≤ŒøœÅŒøœÇ, meaning "mud"; the name Borborites can therefore be translated as "filthy ones". Several of the Borborites' sacred scriptures revolved around the figure of Mary Magdalene, including The Questions of Mary, The Greater Questions of Mary, The Lesser Questions of Mary, and The Birth of Mary. Epiphanius claims that the Borborites were inspired by Sethianism and that elements of sexual sacramentalism formed an important role in their rituals. He asserts that the Borborites engaged in a version of the eucharist in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively.[7] He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her monthly period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual.[8] The Borborites were also said to extract fetuses from pregnant women and consume them, particularly if the women accidentally became pregnant during related sexual rituals.
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): Ban Songs From Love Metaphors About Drugs or Religion 2k19
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.3): it‚Äôs alright
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): i'm agnostic
 
**nickl00** (5): all around pretty boring
 
**frogaranaman** (4): giving this the same score as the other songs because I cannot tell the difference
 
**ImADudeDuh** (0): Ha LehhEHhEh looo Yaahh. I NEEEEEEE*EEEE*d your love.

 **therokinrolla** (9): I used to not understand this song, but very recently it kinda hit. It's really overwhelmingly, aggresively reverbed and slow and psychadelic. It's a lot, for a song that feels like so little. The light trap-esque beat accentuates things even further and it can feel like a smothering. I think that's why i've began to love it, though; it works really well as the centerpiece of the album. Not something I listen to often, but it is effective when I do.

**1998tweety** (10): I remember watching the MV for this and hearing the song for the first time and thinking wtf is this. I know this opinion is extremely unpopular (as evident by its score), but this is probably one of my fav Lana songs. The verses are ok but that shift into the chorus is absolutely magically. I have never been high before but I imagine thats what it feels like. It's so psychadelic, the speed is amazing, makes me feel like I'm floating. I don't see this chorus existing without Lana's slow drawn-out vocals. Don't even get me started on the bridge, the electric guitar comes in and completely blows me away combined with Lana's higher vocals. She does an amazing job creating a singular moment in that bridge which contrasts the rest of the song. A final point is I love songs that do something different with the last chorus. Lana adds in some more moans in the background, and a line "(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)", in the background which surprisingly does a lot more to me than I thought it would. In any case, this was absolutely robbed (kind of had a feeling it would be unfourtuantely). 

---
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that slowly meandering brass thing (is it a sax? idk) in the chorus just really tops this off beautifully
 
**leviswift13** (10): i absolutely adore this song. the chorus is one of the best of her career and the production is both seductive and unsettling
 
**Misentro** (10): That slow, lazy crescendo in the chorus is pure sex. I dare you not to sad strip to this song.
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): she sold really sold us on that sweaty father john misty fantasy
-
 
**spadesluke** (10): This is the most Lana of all of the songs on this album: moody, slow music about being a bad bitch living with her man, living life on the edge together. One thing that I really like about this iteration is that I get the sense that she's singing at the man, rather than the other way around, which is a nice change of structure from Lana's usual submissive, love-obsessed stance she often presents in songs.
 
**akanewasright** (9.5): Absolute bop!
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): This is pretty and ethereal in a way. The transition from this to Art Deco is breathtaking.
 
**didney-worl** (9): I tripped and fell listening to this song in 2016, so
-
 
**Solovrinne** (9): A really enjoyable track, I love her voice during the chorus.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): [Honeymoon songs as Norman Rockwell paintings - "Lazybones"](https://dyn1.heritagestatic.com/lf?set=path%5B1%2F5%2F9%2F4%2F5%2F15945426%5D%2Csizedata%5B850x600%5D&call=url%5Bfile%3Aproduct.chain%5D)
 
**radiofan15** (8.8): Adina Howard teas with this one.
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): The best of the mid-songs, I lowkey wanna know what Lana thinks is freaky sexually. Like is she white girl freaky, or ACTUALLY freaky?
 
**waluigiest** (8): I was about to say this fumbled a bit in terms of writing from the opening few tracks, but did you hear that chorus??? That + ‚Äúscrew your anonymity‚Äù and the saxophone redeem this song
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Okay, I‚Äôm sorry. Normally I would be laughing with all of you for hearing Lana sing the words ‚Äòcome to California, be like a freak like me too‚Äô but the inner white girl in me is crying her eyes out to Lana‚Äôs mind. Folks, no matter how you feel about Freak, this song is tight. It‚Äôs the tightest song on Honeymoon until the Blackest Day, and that‚Äôs on that!
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I actually kind of like this song but it feels like she could have repeated herself less. Like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a short, tight track.
 
**Leixander** (7): I used to love this song but it got boring in re-listens and now it is among my least favorites sadly.
 
**nick1372** (7): Love the vibe she's going for, just not sure how slow dancing to rock music and talking to each other makes you a freak. WAIT what if the whole song is sarcasm? Lana you're a genius.
 
**rickdave16** (7): not a fan of this or the next track SORRY
 
**cubascastrodistrict** (6): Good vibe but the lyrics pull this song down. I think some more time being spent on the chorus would've made it a lot better.
 
**iamjezzac** (6): melodically interesting, but with overbearing production (loses a point because of the ‚Äústranger than a stranger‚Äù lyric atrocity
 
**nickl00** (6): eh
 
**vhqv1997** (6): This song is so forgettable I forgot I was listening to it
 
**MrSwearword** (5): middling in quality as it's just a reference to California, the color blue and anything else about better Lana songs but cheapened on this song.
 
**frogaranaman** (4): Imma freak on that skip button
 
**somedizzywhore-1804** (0): Aaaaand here‚Äôs my zero.  The only good part of listening to this was getting to hear Clair de Lune in the second half of the music video.  Talk about a palate cleanser.
