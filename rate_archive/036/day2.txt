Poor Beach Boys. Day 2 starts and they’re not having an easy time of it at all. I love this song, especially that thumping timpani at the start. It’s definitely one of the sunnier-sounding songs in Pet Sounds and I’ll always bop along to it.

---
# I’m waiting for it, that green light, I want it

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Uggghhhh I love the melody here and Brians harsher almost rock-y vocals on here are so good. Again a really sad song I love it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): OMG a megabop. This is the sunniest shit I’ve ever heard god bless.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song is almost just buildup for the explosions of sound that are soooo good, but even the buildup I love. The biggest strength of Pet Sounds is its execution of the Wall of Sound to fill every musical gap with great instrumentation, and this song is another example of that.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): This one's a real toe-tapper. It's hard to write distinct comments on this album; pretty much every song is excellent, but almost all for similar reasons. I love the major dynamic shifts in this one, and the explosions of background harmonies. And what an ending!

**dropthehammer11** (8): This one has a bit more punch to it than the previous tracks, a welcome change

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): The production in this is kind of interesting, especially at the end

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): When I hear songs like these I begin to understand why it inspired Sgt Pepper's, but still, not by much. Goes a little too slow at times but this is lovely in a melancholy way.

---
# I’m not here for it

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): This is basically a classier version of "It's Gonna Be Me" by *NSYNC, how dare they rip off a song from the 90s (/s)

**Arybeck67** (7.8): not my favorite but its Beach Boys goddammit!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): r/niceguys

**cryptopian** (6.2): Dangerously into "nice guy syndrome" but the music makes up the shortfall

**shineflyer** (4): lots of funky drums! but not a lot goin on for me.

**zamomattel** (3): im sorry but this is getting pretty samey

**MissyBee37** (2): This is a weird song. I don't feel like the music vibes with the lyrics at all. I don't like the sudden shifts from slow & peaceful to faster and sort of aggressive. The drums are way too much and I feel like those louder parts in the music way overpower the vocal. It also seems to end abruptly?

Good lord, the slaughter won’t let up. Y’all were savage with this album, and the fallout is continuing into Day 2. Here Today, while not one of the biggest standouts on the album, is a great tune in its own right. The intro shares similarities with God Only Knows, an example of the recurring motifs Brian Wilson uses throughout the album.

---
# Here for it!

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): By far the most sonically unique song on Pet Sounds. I wonder why I don't see much hype for this one. I love the suave verses and the weary chorus. I'll tolerate this album on a Best Of list for this alone.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I hope this song doesn’t get robbed, it’s a masterpiece in its second half.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The chorus of this song is just about perfect in my eyes. The verses, with the popping keys, rolling drums, and orchestration are great in their own right. I love the melodies too, especially on that amazing chorus.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.4): Please tell me where

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): I love the intro here

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.9): The chorus is a lot better than the verses, to me

**Arybeck67** (7.5): sort of a generic Beach Boys song, but of course is excellent

---
# Gone tomorrow
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): a lil forgettable but still ok

**zamomattel** (6): definitely one of my favourites but it’s too simple like most of the album

**MissyBee37** (4): I don't like the sound of this song, but I do feel like it matches the bitter tone of the lyrics well. It's another track where I feel like the song overpowers the vocal, though.

THIS IS SUCH A GREAT MEDLEY, HOW COULD YOU POPHEADS. The quality is ever-increasing from here on out. A three-in-one banger of a medley, this is one that deserved better, but simply couldn’t compete with the bigger songs.

--- 
# Come to my window 

---
**Franklytheturtle** (10): She Came In Through The Bathroom Window might be my favorite Beatles song period. It's just so chill and it's got such a nice groove to it. A true masterpiece

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): There are a few things to take away from the Medley. One, the Beatles' scrapped song fragments are better than most people could ever hope to write. Two, they were so comfortable with each other, and their instruments, that they were able to make something crazy like this work so well.. Those hours spent in the Cavern were well-spent. Also, you should check out the Anthology version of bathroom window, it's pretty different and really cool - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNSrxPTbTKo

**Arybeck67** (9.9): just amazing

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): A few quick rockers making up the first half of the final stretch of the medley. Mean Mr. Mustard is probably my favorite of the three segments, with a snide delivery from John painting a picture of the life of the titular character.

**dirdbub** (9): favorite part - "Polythene Pam"

**dropthehammer11** (9): Love how these are woven together

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Mean Mr Mustard is trash but Polythene Pams guitar is incredible and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window is lovely

**mustangs16** (8): generally, i wish she came in Through The Bathroom Window had been fleshed out into a whole song and mean mr mustard and polythene pam had been omitted. doesn't make this medley bad, though! i just think it could have been better!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A nice little collection of tracks, but She Came In Through The Bathroom Window is probably my favorite.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): entertaining, but a little too bloated

**zamomattel** (8): I actually really enjoyed this but didn’t really understand what was goin on

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): Mr Mustard is a guy I can relate to, and mot just because my sister is also insane

---
# Stay out of my bathroom, fat

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): These are all good songs, but I only like Polythene Pam as much as the better songs on the album because of John's delivery. Mean Mr Mustard is average, and while Bathroom Window is a masterpiece, it just doesn't click with me.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): The last of these three songs really pulls up the average from the other two.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I just don’t get why they were split into 3 songs since they all connect so smoothly.

**poppinmmolly** (7): overall a 7, if SCITTBW was not in this it would have gotten a 4 tbh

**shineflyer** (6): it's all good fun.

**minibjork** (5): i can't believe john lennon single handedly ruined this medley

**LuckyKidA** (4.8): What are they on here?

**MissyBee37** (3.5): This little medley is pleasant enough to listen to but messy; I can't tell if the story is supposed to flow across all three or not. It feels all over the place and none of them feel complete on their own. It all seems forgettable.

# Hammer me daddy

**Arybeck67** (10): just freakin' awesome. How Paul laughs in this song is literally my mood everyday

**cryptopian** (10): The bounciest song about mass murder ever written!

**dropthehammer11** (10): Okay so for those who don't already know, this song is significant to me for a big reason: it's my namesake. My dad was such a Beatles stan that he named me Maxwell...and my middle name is legally Hammer (hence the username). There's a fun little factoid for y'all

**kappyko** (10): moog my dick off I love the delvieryt on thsi

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Such a fun song. The fact that John hated it kind of makes it even more lovely - Paul was such a wonderful purveyor of whimsical nonsense. And for such a seemingly simple tune, there's some really cool instrumentation, too. This is a real Bang Bang/Clang Clanger.

**Mudkip1** (10): lmao this one's so funky and cute

**strawberryswing1** (10): Songs like this are what the Beatles so special. It's funny, random, but still sonically really good.

**CopyCatJ** (9): My Turret!

**Franklytheturtle** (9): such a fun song

**letsallpoo** (9): /u/dropthehammer11[+22]'s silver /u/dropthehammer11[+22]

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): @hammer

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is a lot darker than I expected from a Beatles song.

**Verdantshade** (9): fuck paul and his stupid songs (i love this though)

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Lyrical dissonance up to eleven here. I honestly did not see the chorus coming. The only thing bringing it down is Paul's singing voice here

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): One of the most unexpectedly bizarre songs by the band. It's an ironically cheery song about people getting murdered with a hammer, and a song people either love or hate. John hated it. I like it probably more than most, because it's kind of a fun oddity and it has a catchy melody.

**morgchrist** (8.3): this one's kinda weird, huh?

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Idgaf this song is funny as hell as Dark Humor

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I don't know why John described this as 'Paul's granny shit', because if my grandma was making songs about serial killers I'd stay far away from her. Since this is miles better than Paul's attempt at making semi-novelty songs last album, I'm going to be generous.

---
# No thx, I don’t enjoy murder

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): wait...this is a song about murder. A happy, catchy song about murder. About murdering multiple people. I don’t know how to feel because I like the sound of it, but it’s about smashing people’s heads in.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): /u/dropthehammer I wonder how many times you will be pinged for this one

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): it's good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I really can’t decide if this annoys me or if I love it, but that chorus is pretty wild, and the synths are very out there. The verses, however, are just not my cup of tea, and it’s a bit hard to explain why, but there’s something very sing-songy about The Beatles’ delivery on this album that I’m not into, and I understand that this song is about murder, and there’s this dichotomy between the fun nature of the song and the horrors of the lyrics, but it’s just not working for me.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): No clue what this song is about.

**minibjork** (6): this is the beatles song that made me want to become a fan truly iconic

**shineflyer** (6): The jolliest murder track I know.

**zamomattel** (4): bang bang into the room

**MissyBee37** (3): This is the kind of song where the Beatles totally lose me. What a weird, creepy idea for a song. It's got a fun sound but I can't get past the lyrics.

The first Fleetwood song out for the day (and it won’t be the last). Also, our first 11 for the day gone (also, not our last). I think my one issue with Rumours is Lindsey Buckingham’s vocals. For some reason, I am just not a fan of them. However, that doesn’t detract too much from a lovely guitar-driven ballad about a breakup.

---
# I come back every time

**LuckyKidA** (11): Easy Breezy Buckingham

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Damn, the guitar is just stunning on this one. One of my favourite guitar lines of all time. Intricate and so satisfying.

**mustangs16** (10): i adore this song for a very silly reason, but i won't apologize. the instrumental is just beautiful.

**shineflyer** (10): not only are we r/countryheads now, we're also r/bluegrassheads

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A more sparse and airy track than anything else on the album, this soft and short track is honestly amazing. There’s barely any vocals here, and the ones that are present are delivered either quietly or loudly, and it’s really unique in that aspect. Also, for some reason I associate this song with brunch, it just has that morning vibe for me.

**cryptopian** (9.5): The guitar picking makes this song just float along so beautifully

**deadspiderwall** (8.9): love the strings!

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): The guitar is gorgeous.

**ExtraEater** (8.5): a good, easygoing recovery after the best song of all time

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): low-key bop

**zamomattel** (8.5): I was sat in maths the other day and the guitar was relentlessly stuck in my head, so I consider that a success

---
# I ain’t comin back no more

**Albert\_Cole** (7.1): For some reason the guitar's plinkiness really annoys me

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Nice little folky thing

**strawberryswing1** (6.8): Really good in the context of the album, but not a track that I'd visit on its own

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I like the guitar, but lyrically it’s just super empty sounding to me.

**MissyBee37** (5): This song just doesn't do much for me. The guitar is cool and all but that's kind of all there is? The lyrics are too vague.

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): Fuck, way to bring the album down right here. Some boring acoustic ballad, and I can only remember the strings, which are absolutely annoying. At least Her Majesty was funny the first time.

Oof, what a champion this song was. Starting in 3rd-last, it held on for so long and managed to rise to the top 20 in the final week. Another stunning performance by Christine McVie, and an underrated song on an album full of classics.

---
# Sing to me, Mariah

**Arybeck67** (10): this heartwarming song by Christine McVie is so sad, yet hopeful at the same time. A song of devotion during a time of emotional turmoil, I cannot help but love this song and recognize its excellence.

**ExtraEater** (10): was honestly surprised to see this was one of the more disliked songs on the album. it's really sweet! i kinda teared up the very first time i heard it, long ago

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): I’M NOT CRYING OKAY. I feel Christine is so underrated, she kinda gets overshadowed by the larger than life presence that is Stevie, but she deserves the same kind of praise for her voice and songwriting. A beautiful song, one of her best.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Ahhhhh, it’s so beautiful. The most tender track on Rumours, Songbird is super ballad-y but it’s a fantastic way to end side one (as albums back then paid special attention to tracklisting as they had to be pressed on a medium that primarily split tracklists in half). I fully expect this to go out day 1, but that’s okay.

**zamomattel** (10): like so beautiful ahhhhhh. Feels different from the other songs on this album, but still im so into it

**deadspiderwall** (9.7): beautiful

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): This sounded boring at first, but it eventually grew on me. The 'I love you, I love you, I love you's in the chorus are heartbreaking and so pretty.

**CopyCatJ** (9): sounds really vulnerable and open

**DraculaWeekend** (9): So pretty ugh

**ignitethephoenix** (9): When I think of this song, I think about how Santana from Glee sang it to Brittany and how beautiful and emotional it was.

**poppinmmolly** (9): this song is so pretty

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): love me a good ballad

**MissyBee37** (8): Beautiful. Just a lovely love song. Simple, but deeply emotional.

---
# Kill the bird

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): I can't tell if it's happy or sad. The lyrics paint a picture of love, but the context is the collapse of a longterm relationship. If it's both sad and happy, is it sappy?

**shineflyer** (7): a sweet little song. I feel like Lindsay and (mostly) Stevie get all the attention when it comes to vocals, but Christine desrves to be acknowledged as well.

**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): Well this little cloud of melancholy is a /great/ way to follow Go Your Own Way

**mustangs16** (6.5): i don't know. it's pretty, and emotional, but it just doesn't do much for me.

**kappyko** (5.5): this is so pretty but i mean it's not that fun unfortunately and doesn't feel much emotional

**hypertonality** (5): this and go your own way are the only songs I skip on this album, excluding silver spring which I had to listen to recently

**minibjork** (5): 2 quiet :-/

**ClocktowerMaria** (4): bleh, Ballads on Pop Records are so boring sorry

Yet another Pet Sounds standout leaves far too early. This was just not the Beach Boys’ month. A powerhouse vocal performance in the chorus gives this hook such heft and power. Ahhh, I love it and I wish it made Day 3!

---
# Answer me, Brian

**CopyCatJ** (10): this is a bop.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I love this Russ diss track

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Some of my favorite arrangements and melodies on the album are on this song. That saxophone just works so well with the fills and solo on the bridge, and it provides a nice satirical edge on the psychedelic era of the time.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): I love the chorus even those it's only two lines long.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Kickin' down the doors of perception. Great, impassioned vocals on a great, 'enlightened' tune

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I really prefer the original title of this song more, “Hang On To Your Ego” but this bops.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.5): The percussion is really nice

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): I'd say the B side of this album is a little weaker, but naturally still very good

**dropthehammer11** (8): brian wilson is a man

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): At this point the album is just constantly 'good, but not exceptional', and the mold isn't broken on this track, which is fun, but what's intresting about it? Almost nothing, except for the very solid hook, which has probably been done even better before.

---
# I Have Questions (feat. Quavo)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): That saxophone sounds like fancy farts.

**shineflyer** (6.5): it's a bit freeform for me but the when he sings the title, my attention is there.

**zamomattel** (5): but what was the question, bitch what was the question

**MissyBee37** (1): I don't know what that one instrument is - a horn of some sort? - but I'll pass. I don't get what this song is going for.

OK, this was the most controversial song in the rat?! For real?! OK then, popheads. A great ballad and a throwback to classic 50s doo-wop ballds, Oh! Darling features arguably Paul McCartney’s best vocal performance. Listen, enjoy, and reflect on your scores, flopheads.

---
# Oh Darling, Yes!

**dropthehammer11** (11): My favorite Beatles song and one of my favorite songs of all time. Paul's vocals are fucking sex to my ears especially when he starts to scream, the doo-wop style rhythm is catchy as all hell, it's just beautifully composed, written, and beautiful.

**CopyCatJ** (10): these vocals are hashtag lit dab

**DraculaWeekend** (10): "WHEN YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T NEED ME ANYMOREEE" Those vocals!!!

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Paul could REALLY belt it out when he wanted to, and it's rarely on better display than in this song. The backing instruments, especially the guitar and the piano, manage to do so much with relatively little; everything sounds huge, even when the guitar's just playing arpeggios over the hammered piano chords. And of course Paul's bass is effortlessly melodic, and manages to deftly dance around the beat. But wow, Paul's voice just kills it

**mustangs16** (10): definitely a song i've appreciated more as i've gotten older. when i was younger, i sort of found it to be a bit obnoxious yet boring at the same time (somehow). these days, however, while my top ten beatles songs would change depending on the day, this is one of the ones that will always be in it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Wow, Paul fucking snapped. Much less refined than the similar vocal performance on Maybe I'm Amazed, but that's what makes it the better song. Generally, I just love songs where Paul fucking snaps. Back In The U.S.S.R is just as good as this one.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song is so, SO fun to sing along to.

**shineflyer** (10): Potentially my favorite Beatles track. Paul's vocals are insane, and I love a good 6/8 shuffle.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A dance bop, with some brash and awesome delivery, a track that seems to be forgotten in the cursory discussion of this album but deserves all the praise it gets, and though it’s repetitive, it doesn’t get old.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): great vocals and a very daring instrumental

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): I just love Paul's vocals on this track. It's not a vocal style he went with too often with the Beatles, but he sells it amazingly on here. There are some understated but very pretty vocal harmonies too.

**Arybeck67** (9): Get the hint. I adore Paul.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): Paul Vocaltney snapped

**strawberryswing1** (8): I wanna give this a 10 but my aunt who can't sing would always do kareoke to this song and hearing it gives me flashbacks. Great song on it's own though.

**zamomattel** (8): queen teas

---
# Oh Honey, No!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Paul’s voice sounds too strained on here, even though it’s an alright song anyway.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): Pretty good, but not the best use of Pauls voice on the album, that's later

**Albert\_Cole** (6.5): A biiiit repetitive?

**cryptopian** (6): I can't work out if this is supposed to be a parody of overwrought rock n roll songs or to be taken straight

**Mudkip1** (5): i appreciate this but it's definitely not something i'd ever listen to again

**MissyBee37** (2): These lyrics are really simplistic. It feels like it drags on way longer than it is with the same melody over & over and lyrics that never go any further than begging her not to leave, saying he'll never harm her and going on about crying & dying when she said she wanted out. The screaming bit on the third chorus variation, I could definitely do without.

**kappyko** (0): ok ive always hated this song so fucking much i'd explain but I don't have time this sounds like 5 minutes when it's only 3:27

A great duet on Rumours that showcases some great romantic tension between the two leads as they reflect on the breakdown of their relationship. This song was a strong contender for Day 3, but it fell back to #17 on the final day.

---
# I Wanna Know!

**CopyCatJ** (10): I sing this at my dog. I can't sing, he probably hates me.

**Mudkip1** (10): this is so energetic and cute

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Oh my god, Stevie and Lindsey absolutely murder this track, one of my favorites on the album that’s usually not as discussed as some of the other classics here. The delivery is just flawless and the production, from the handclaps to the glorious guitar work just works. I can’t get enough of this track.

**Arybeck67** (9.9): not a ten because it replaced Sliver Springs on the original album, but i love it because I love Stevie and Lindsey together, not apart

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): The poppiest sounding song I can’t help but bop and sing along every single time, Stevie/Lindsey singing over each other works so damn well, especially knowing their history.

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): really nice

**ExtraEater** (8): one of the simpler, yet catchier songs on the album

**mustangs16** (8): a semi-positive breakup song! it almost feels out of place on rumours, with the bitterness many of the other songs convey.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): It's definitely not the best song on Rumours, but it's a harmless bop. On the standard edition, this is the last track I really enjoy.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): arctic monkeys found dead

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): It sounds like Stevie is standing behind Lindsey and trying to put him off by singing over him

**shineflyer** (7.5): this song makes me laugh, it's infectiously cheery

---
# I don’t wanna know, know, know, know

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): fun, but doesn't particularly stick out

**zamomattel** (7.5): doesn’t jump out, but a great song nevertheless. Also was this in shrek

**LazyDayLullaby** (0): It's alright, but it kicked Silver Springs off the album. Thus the 0. They could've had Silver and Gold, on the same album! Sam the Snowman is spinning in his grave (or perhaps gurgling in his puddle)

A Day 3 contender and a top 10 peak at one point, this album opener fell outside the top 15 at the last minute. Again, I had to bring my score down because I’m just not a fan of Lindsey’s vocals, and the lyrics are a little nonsensical in this one.

---
# First Hand Bop
**ExtraEater** (10): unhinged AF, hanging on the borderline of heartbreak-induced insanity, wonderful way to begin one of the best breakup albums ever

**Franklytheturtle** (10): I get hard every time that guitar kicks in holy moley

**Mudkip1** (10): one of my favorites on the album and also the first song that actually got me interested in Fleetwood Mac. love this one

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I strangely love how cheerful this sounds for an angsty song. The humming he does before the chorus gets me. Very energetic, very good opening.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I know it’s second hand news that this song is the worst off of Rumours, but this brilliant and amazing opening track is honestly still a 10. I love how they deliver the song title, and the first verse of the track is just beautiful. I expect to probably be the only 10 for this track, and this will probably go out day 1, but that’s understandable in a rate with this much talent.

**Arybeck67** (9.2): Lindsey is just so angry with Stevie here

**Albert\_Cole** (9): This is like the second Fleetwood Mac song I have heard in my life, and I now officially love Fleetwood Mac

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Probably my favorite song on this album, peppy and fun

**CopyCatJ** (9): I have never even been in a relationship and this makes me so sad.

**dirdbub** (9): SECOND HAND NUUUUUUUDEEES

**mustangs16** (9): a wonderful album opener. one of those songs where the lyrics don't fit the melody, but if you pay attention to the lyrics, you know exactly what the rest of the album has in store.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.4): A nice, peppy opener

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Nice, kind of folky but upbeat tonally opener.

**morgchrist** (7.4): Pretty jaunty and weird opener. Never been too big a fan of this song

**DraculaWeekend** (7): This song is unusually upbeat for this album, especially with all those bow bow bow bow bows.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): This is not my favorite from Fleetwood Mac, but it’s still a fun song and a cute start to Rumours

**shineflyer** (7): bow bow bow bow babow

**zamomattel** (7): kind of a mediocre song to open with, but better than most songs on the other two albums though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): idk might just be me but I'm not a big fan of songs with hooks that just go "bam bam bam bam bam bam". that short guitar solo at the end is cool though

A heart-breaking song from Stevie about her cocaine addiction, this song is an absolute UNIT and stuck it out in the bottom 5 until it soared to top 12, before settling back at #15. Give it up for the little song that could!

---
# ily cocaine

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this is a childhood nostalgia anthem for me and i'm giving it what it DESERVES

**CopyCatJ** (10): Stevie Nicks is my favourite dragon.

**hypertonality** (10): do I like Stevie Nicks' contributions more than Christine McVie's? well maybe, but can you blame me when she's serving classics like Gold Dust Woman?

**Leixander** (10): Well did she make you cry? Make you break down? Shatter your illusions of love? And now tell me, Is it over now? DO YOU KNOW HOW? Pickup the pieces and go home! GO HOOOOOMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

**minibjork** (10): hot take: i like this song a little bit more than dreams

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Another example of Stevie KILLING the songwriting game. Queen of talking about her cocaine addiction and taking my wig in the process.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is further proof that Nicks is probably the best writer in Fleetwood Mac, as this track is a triumph. It’s a textbook example of iconic rock track about drug and love abuse, and her energy in this track is palpable. It’s an electric and haunting track, and it marches on with no clear solution, just an acknowledgement of pain.

**Arybeck67** (9.4): awesome way to end the original album and i also love Stevie Nicks so (:

**mustangs16** (9): another moody stevie nicks song. there's no one better at using lyrics and instrumentation combined to set a mood that envelops you for the entire time you're listening than fleetwood mac, and this song's a perfect example of it.

**shineflyer** (9): this desert atmosphere tho. and of course, as usual, the band's harmonies are on point

**zamomattel** (9): a little long but atmospheric and cool

---
# Fight it Stevie, you can do better

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): a feminist anthem that goes on for a little too long

**Albert\_Cole** (8.1): Why the angry ghosts tho

**ExtraEater** (8): not a good outro, but as the penultimate song behind Silver Springs, it works!

**kappyko** (8): kinda intense honestly

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.9): The lyrics are excellent, musically much less exciting than the other tracks, though.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Yeah, can't get the love for this one either, which is a shame because it has such a good title. Sorry, popheads. I've failed you.

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): also boring

Who likes tentacles? ;) Ringo’s big solo on Abbey Road is a cute ditty that stands out as a random, but classic Beatles song. This was one of my favourite songs growing up as a kid. This song was a trooper and stuck in the top 20 for the entire month, but just missed out on a Day 3 reveal at the last minute.

**Albert\_Cole** (11): wtf Ringo is my favourite Beatle now. Seriously this is just so light and innocent. George Harrison literally recorded himself blowing bubbles into a glass of milk with a straw as a sound effect. This is too pure

**dirdbub** (10): reminder that there is a James Bond film titled *[Octopussy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopussy)*

**Mudkip1** (10): simply iconic

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Hot, scalding tea: this is better than Yellow Submarine. Better imagery, better lyrics, better vocals, better evidence that Ringo can be good when it comes to songwriting. This deserves to be a children's classic and it makes me sad that Ringo decided to narrate a show about trains instead of marine biology.

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): The little plucky guitars are so nice on the hears, lyrics are poetically silly, great song.

**jamesfog** (9.5): A Ringo bop!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): I loved this song as a kid (Ringo was my favorite Beatle), and it's hard to really dislike anything about it now. Ringo is far from a perfect vocalist but this type of cheery, groovy song really fits his voice so well. It's very simplistic, but very effective and just makes me happy every time I listen to it.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Ilu ilu ilu Ringo

**cryptopian** (9): Ringo can't sing, but has a great talent for writing endearing songs that almost work better with a bad singer

**ExtraEater** (9): simple but strong

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): It's sweet, it's absurd, it's Ringo. The scene in Let It Be when George is sitting with Ringo, working out the chord progression and melody, is so heartwarming; in many ways, Ringo was the glue holding the band together by this point. George's guitar lead (and John's pleasant backing) is a highlight, and I love the gurgling background harmonies... Honestly, there's no way Ringo could have ended his Beatles songwriting tenure on a more perfect note: optimistic, warm, and a bit goofy

**poppinmmolly** (9): HOT TAKE: Ringo was a talented singer and deserved more songs to sing!!!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song is wild and I fucking love octopi and it’s lit.

**Verdantshade** (9): i've seen kermit and muppet covers of this song and i'm giving this song a 9 because that is its legacy

**Arybeck67** (8.9): just a freaking classic. Ringo's voice is perfectly matched with this song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): interesting

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): Such a fun song

# Get ur ink away from me

**kappyko** (7.5): I kindaaaaa vibe but McCartney pulled off this kinda corny betteeeer. don't pass me by (?) was a drag too. sorry ringo I love yellow submarine though

**shineflyer** (7.5): a silly little song. But it's done well.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I’m 90% drugs were involved in the writing of this song.

**MissyBee37** (7): This song has no business working, but it's actually pretty fun. The lyrics are weird, for sure, but I have to respect the imagination. The bubbles-underwater sound is a bit much, but I like the guitar, the beachy feel and the pretty background vocal harmonies. The chorus is catchy.

**mustangs16** (7): this is just a fun little song that honestly gets a lot of negativity simply because it's not as good as the rest of the album. considering the rest of the album is abbey freaking road, though, it's unwarranted.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): This song is overrated

**LuckyKidA** (4.5): yikes

**zamomattel** (3.5): I thought this was probably ringo… sadly I was right
