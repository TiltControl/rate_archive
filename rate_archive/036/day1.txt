Screaming that this ended up in last place. Her Majesty actually pulled an Intro on The Beatles’ own song. I don’t think anybody was expecting a regular song to pull up in last place, but here we are. Sun King is definitely a moment of calm in the Abbey Road medley. In fact, it’s probably the final rest we get until the end of the album. Its placement between a collection of more upbeat songs definitely hurt its chances in this rate. However, I still maintain that this is a great little song. 

---
# Pissed myself laughing

---
**agentofscranton** (10): i didn’t realise they were speaking Italian at first so i felt like i was being cursed or something, i was thoroughly shook

---
# Yessss, soak up that Vitamin D, Kings

---
**Franklytheturtle** (10): This is pure nirvana

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): I've always loved Sun King; so surreal and dreamy. Excellent interplay between the bass and the guitars, and then a really cool chord and one of my favourite chord progressions. John, and I suppose the Beatles generally, were great at using descending and ascending semitones (like the lead guitars in Hey Bulldog and Here, There and Everywhere)

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This used to be my least favourite part of the medley, but now I love it! I even love the harmonies Paul, George and John have in the latter part, even if they're spouting out total nonsense. The way their voices blend together is very beautiful.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): Soft and airy, but also light and beautiful in a unique way. Features another gorgeous harmony by Paul, George, and John and some broken Spanish, which is unique to Beatles' music.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): hola amigos

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A somber but nice track before the rapid fire stream of shorter tracks.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): low-key bop

**zamomattel** (7.5): have your sun king, I have a plow king

---
# I prefer the moon, tbh

---
**mustangs16** (7): yet another beatles song to refer to the sun! one of their weaker efforts of this oddly specific category, though.

**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): Is sunking the past tense of sinking

**ExtraEater** (6.5): chilled out and hazy, but not particularly interesting

**kappyko** (6.5): this one was a lil boring sorry :( we stan bilinguals though

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Kinda boring musically. I thought the spanish verse was very nice though.

**morgchrist** (6.3): The suite is the worst part of this album

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): the guitars nice but this feels so boring on it's own, decent section of the medley though

**ignitethephoenix** (5): nothing like a random language switch up

**shineflyer** (5): a background music track. but a good one.

**MissyBee37** (3): This is pretty but lyrically pointless. I can't believe the last chunk is just literal nonsense from multiple languages. What?

Literally, what. Call off the rate, Her Majesty just won by managing to not come last despite being a 20-second song. It’s short, it’s nonsensical, it’s charming, I love everything about this. Does it undercut the epic ending of the album? Yes. Is it appropriate as hell? You bet.

---
# YAS KWEEN

---
**agentofscranton** (10): the perfect way to close the album

**dirdbub** (10): amazing

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): i feel unfair rating this because it is 25 seconds but also it's a lit 25 seconds?

**Arybeck67** (9.5): I actually love this little bit of the album. Its adorable and closes out the album with charm.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): Literally invented secret tracks

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Even though The End would have made a fine ending... Could the Beatles really go out any other way than this happiest of accidents? It's actually a catchy tune, and Paul again demonstrates that he can play any instrument masterfully, but what I especially love is that the chord doesn't even resolve itself. What a way to go out!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): A hidden track initially, it's very Beatles to sneak one last surprise into Abbey Road that starts with a sudden crash and ends up being a short acoustic ditty.

**cryptopian** (8): The twist in this is kinda cute

---
# Down with the monarchy!

---
**kappyko** (8): no

**poppinmmolly** (8): a cute diddy but the album should have ended with The End that would have been amazing.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Is this the shortest track we’ve ever rated lol

**letsallpoo** (7): this was extremely necessary

**Mudkip1** (7): this was interesting i guess lol

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): Cute.

**jamesfog** (6): wh

**minibjork** (6): cute !

**shineflyer** (6): a lovely little ditty.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Why is this here? The song immediately before this is such a strong ending, and then you get... this? It could probably be a pretty good song if extended out though.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): i mean that was fun but also why

**mustangs16** (5): i'm kind of annoyed by this song's placement, despite it being a new groundbreaking thing? the end should have been the actual end of abbey road, damnit.

**CopyCatJ** (4): My only Queen is Freddie Mercury

**MissyBee37** (4): This seems pointless. It's playful and funny enough but too short to be anything meaningful or memorable.

**LuckyKidA** (3.8): What

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I didn’t even realize this was an entire song. I think blinked twice in this entire song. Why is this even on here.

**zamomattel** (0): literally why is this needed

---
# Get ready to spit out your shoe

---
**patronsaintofaspies** (1): If this isn't the first one out I'll spit out my shoe. Sorry, Paul, sweetie, but John was right. This really doesn't belong on here!

A lovely little instrumental, but it’s not hard to see why it went out so early. Vocals are king in a pop subreddit, and this just doesn’t have them. Bonus points for being featured in Baby Driver AKA the best action musical of 2017.

---
# RUN AWAY WITH ME

**kappyko** (10): greatest song ever released

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Normally, I'd consider an instrumental track on a vocal-driven album to be filler, but this song is far from that. It's an extension of the already-beautiful production that just lets you take a moment to relax and take in all the sound it's surrounding you with. The alluring melody, wonderful background strings that fade so well into the foreground when they need to, and the almost tropical guitar licks that occur throughout. Despite being an instrumental, it still demands re-listens.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Beautiful

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Maybe I just don't like Brian Wilson's voice? Because I kind of love this instrumental

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): So pretty. It's not very exciting or anything but I really like it.

**jamesfog** (8.5): When an instrumental track is more interesting than most of the songs prior.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Just the prettiest bit of elevator music

**static\_int\_husp** (8): It's elevator music, but it's great elevator music!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): a very pleasant instrumental that feels very much in place

**cryptopian** (7.5): I can feel the title through the music, which is always a good start

---
# Nah, I’ll stay here thx

---
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the vibraphone just took me back to high school. But also I’m disappointed this isn’t a proper song, because the instruments are so nice.

**dropthehammer11** (7): An instrumental track that is nice on the ears. An interlude of sorts.

**Arybeck67** (6.7): weird beginning

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A brief but cute instrumental. It’s riveting in parts but it’s not one of my favorites off the album.

**zamomattel** (6): this sounds like a background track on Feud

**MissyBee37** (5): This is fine. It's a pretty enough interlude. Nothing special.

**shineflyer** (4.5): it's cute, i guess

**InfernalSolstice** (4): a nice instrumental but i'm sorry but i like vocals in my music

---
# How’s that shoe taste?

---
**patronsaintofaspies** (1): What's the purpose of this? Are these really your Pet Sounds, Brian? Why are they so unmemorable? Instrumental tracks are just always a hit or miss and they definitely fall into the latter this time.

Again, another lovely instrumental by Brian Wilson. Filled with quirky sounds and themes, he definitely has a taste for the curious. It’s a shame it placed so low, but in a rate with so many legends, something has to go out early.

---
# Must Love Dogs

---
**kappyko** (10): rumor has it the percussion is titties slapping together

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): A lovely instrumental track that borders on a sound collage with the various loops. That main guitar lick that comes in throughout is just angelic to my ears, and brings the whole album together in front of that backing orchestration that almost gives the song an end credits quality.

**Arybeck67** (8.6): weird asf but, I like it

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Why are these musical interludes so much better than most of the actual songs.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): nice

---
# Didn’t get a pet as a kid

---
**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Oh yeah, Pet Sounds has a forgettable song. That happens to be the title track. Weird

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is some real percussion shit.

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): Idk I prefer the other instrumental by a long shot

**MissyBee37** (6): This is more interesting than the other instrumental. I can totally see how it was intended for a James Band movie, according to Genius, anyway.

**InfernalSolstice** (5): a slightly better instrumental but again i really like vocals in my music

**NapsAndNetflix** (5): inb4 first out because no vocals. It's good but I dont listen to it over other songs

**shineflyer** (5): an interesting TV theme song.

---
# Probably stans the ending of Marley & Me

---
**zamomattel** (2): much like the album, I expected a symphony of barks and meows, we cant all win I guess

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): This is even more unmemorable than the previous instrumental; come to think of it, why isn't the title track an actual song? There aren't even any pets on here. What a mess. It takes great mediocrity to make me retract my 0 from Her Majesty, but you've done it, Beach Boys! You've done it. Congratulations.

There’s a lot of people who dislike Brian Wilson’s falsetto. I can understand. Usually, I’m alright with it. Here, it gets a bit much though. That slide on “Don’t talk” just sounds off to me. Definitely my least favourite song from the album, although the sentiment is beautiful and the instrumentation is lush.

---
# Don’t Speak

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): awh it's really cute

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The strings on this track are so perfectly done, and these are some of my favorite Brian vocals on the whole album. The final repetition of the chorus with the building strings is so sonically beautiful. It's a bit oddly paced, but it honestly works with the sound and mood of the song.

**dropthehammer11** (9): I love the violin (?) arrangements in the background, Beach Boys were masters at harmony.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): One of my favourites on the album. Sweepingly sentimental and tender. And that chord change on 'Listen, listen, listen' - !!!

**cryptopian** (8.5): I added several points to this after

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): A little slow, but still wonderful

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Super dreamy, love the way Brian says “listen” and it’s slow but rewarding.

---
# I’ll speak if I want to, hoe

---
**Arybeck67** (7.8): not my favorite on the album, but still a beautiful message

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): no doubt is shaking

**Albert\_Cole** (7.2): This sentiment describes a very sweet, intimate feeling. But it's a sort of silent feeling that goes unsaid when it happens, so making a slow, semi-grand three-minute song defeats the whole purpose of it.

**shineflyer** (7): It takes a bit for the song to set in, but once you're there, it's really pleasant.

**MissyBee37** (6.5): This is a neat concept for a song, exploring how two people can share so much without speaking or doing anything at all. I like the way the strings match the feeling.

**zamomattel** (5.5): don’t tell me what to do brian

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I think this is the song where Pet Sounds starts leaning into mediocrity; what should sound comforting sounds like a snooze. This is one of the only songs after multiple relistens that I'd still consider unquestionably dull.

**strawberryswing1** (5): I appreciate what this is going for but it just doesn't sound good :(

**DrunkHurricane** (0): this song feels like a chore to sit through

Fleetwood serving them Lana teas. Iconic, but also unintentionally cringy in this day and age. Nothing against the song though, which is lovely and features the incomparable Christine McVie on vocals. She deserved more solo time on Rumours and this is evidence of why.

---
# Daddy 💦😰👅

---
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I know for a fact this is going out day 1, but that’s okay. For me, this is the saddest track on the album, from the visceral percussion to the bombastic moments of pure emotion… Christine really kills it here, and it’s a quiet but revealing song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I love Lana del Rey

**zamomattel** (10): oh chris pratt

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): relatable title

**Albert\_Cole** (8.5): Doesn't live up to the title at all, but also is weirdly good

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Is it weird that she calls her boyfriend ‘daddy'? Yes. Is it still a good song? Yes.

**cryptopian** (6.9): I can see how this is a well written song, but something about it doesn't work entirely for me

Another gorgeous track from the Beach Boys. That soaring hook in the chorus really is something. Popheads may not have believed in it, but I always will. Yet another Pet Sounds song out though. It really isn’t the Beach Boys’ day, I’m sorry to say.

---
# THEN I SAW HER FACE, NOW I’M A BELIEVER, NOT A TRACE OF DOUBT IN MY MIND

---
**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Gorgeous, incredible, original, exciting, I wanna Cryyyyyyyyyyyy

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Some more amazing vocal harmonies and melodies. The vocals on this song just perfectly float on top of the various instruments, making even a bicycle horn sound totally fitting.

**hypertonality** (9.5): the last .5 is missing because of the clown horn in the middle of the penultimate chorus

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): Leave it to Brian Wilson to elevate the humble bicycle bell to such lofty heights

**Arybeck67** (8.3): but omg, those beginnings oohs are literally my obsession

**dropthehammer11** (8): Love the strings on this one. This album did a great job with breaking out of the norm at the time.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): it doesn't progress a lot, but nevertheless an enjoyable listen

**Albert\_Cole** (7.9): Do you believe in life after love?

**minibjork** (7.5): the lyrics are cute

---
# I don’t believe in life after love

---
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is very sweet; I'm not saying that as a mere way to add at least one compliment to my commentary. I genuinely think the lyricism of Pet Sounds works best on songs like these. I guess I just expected more from the melody.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I know this is kinda mean but this is a pretty forgettable track for me in the scheme of the album. It’s certainly beautiful but the lyrics don’t catch me, and it goes on for a bit too long for my tastes. Still great though.

**zamomattel** (6.5): this is a bit of a slog but im not mad at it

**shineflyer** (5): It's like the Beach Boys were asked to play for a ballroom full of rich people.

**mustangs16** (4): this honestly gave me a headache.

**MissyBee37** (2): Yikes. I don't care for the instruments here, or the vocal, or the way it stops and restarts a little after 2 minutes. Also, I think it's meant to be sweet but it just comes off like a lame-ass excuse, IMHO.

A sad but stunning closer to Pet Sounds. Caroline, No is a heartbreaking cry from Brian Wilson, mourning the loss of the girl he used to know. It’s a crime this placed so low. Unfortunately, we also lose our first 11 of the rate here. Sadly, this will not be the only 11 to go today.

---
# Caroline, Yes

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): one of the all-time great album closers. a mellow masterpiece. Aminé is shook.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This was originally billed as a Brian Wilson solo track, and it makes sense. It features all of Brian's strengths: His gift for creating these wonderful melodies and pairing them with beautiful arrangements of a large amount of different instruments some wouldn't even think to pair together. This song is just beautiful as a closer to a perfect album.

**Arybeck67** (9.7): just incredible. The wanting in his voice is so apparent and the lyrics are so stinging.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Gorgeous

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): My favourite part is the implied double meaning - Carol, I know, and Caroline, no. Adds a nice layer of sepia toned fog. A lovely, somewhat ambiguous note to end a spectacular album on

**kappyko** (8): pretty but at the same time this probably influenced a lot of really drab indie sad boys. outro is an extra .5 bc it's actual pet sounds

**static\_int\_husp** (8): A really good song to end the album off on. A sad song about fading love that literally fades into ambient noise. Impressive sonically, if not lyrically

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Hey look actual Pet Sounds on the album in the last song!

**zamomattel** (7.5): oh caroliiiinnne, shes the reason for the word bitch, bitchhh? I hope she's speeding on the way to the club trying to hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that nd try to put on her makeup in the mirror and crash, crash, craaash.. into a ditch! Just playin///on a non-outkast related note, this is quite sweet

---
# Caroline, Maybe

---
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Okay she’s cute

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Kinda wish that we got a stronger closer here, but this is still good. The drums are nice.

---
# Nah, bitch

---
**Albert\_Cole** (5.5): Sour Caroline/No, no, no/Pet sounds never felt so dull/I feel inclined/Oh oh oh/To rate this lower than I should

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): I'm not going to say anything about the actual song, I'm just going to express how fucking terrified I am of the dogs at the end. They're the only actual pets on this entire goddamn album and they sound like they have rabies. No. Thank. You.

**MissyBee37** (2): This song feels really whiny. I get that it's supposed to be sad, but I don't like the tone. It's such a weak way to end an album that has far more profound themes on other songs. And, uh, why the dog barking and train sounds at the end??

This was a curious one. It shot up, down and all around the 20s for the entire rate, but could never quite settle. Sadly, with the last batch of scores, it slipped all the way back to 30. Such sweet harmony, coupled with oddball lyrics about the world being thicc, makes this a pretty great song and another one I’ll be sad to see go so soon.

---
# BECAUSE WE CAN CAN CAN

---
**DraculaWeekend** (10): Another one of my favorites. Hauntingly beautiful.

**Mudkip1** (10): love the harmonies in this

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The triple-tracked triple harmony by Paul, George, and John on this song is just incredible. It has to be one of the most intricate harmonies I've heard on a song, and it honestly still blows my mind a little. It would basically be 10-worthy on its own, but that harpsichord riff that goes throughout the song really works to set the psychedelic, trippy mood.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.3): John always managed to say so much with so little; he had a masterful way of taking a line then flipping it around, and deriving a whole new meaning (as in 'Mother'). Elliott Smith has a lovely, mostly a cappella version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvSdFr3niQM

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I really like the almost otherworldly sound to this track. The harmonizing is amazing and gives the song a really unique sound.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): I have very mixed feelings about this? but it's really haunting and minimalistic and I kinda love it? idk. it's not that important I'll just give it a high score.

**poppinmmolly** (8.7): if you had asked me to rate this 8 years ago this would have been my 11. I loved this song for so long and now, it's still good but it's not even in my top 10 Beatles songs anymore.

**minibjork** (8.5): "aaaaaahhhhh"

**mustangs16** (8.5): simple. eerie in its own way. another case of the beatles making a lot out of a little.

**cryptopian** (8): I'm a sucker for vocal harmonies

**kappyko** (8): the world turns me on bc it's round? hot

---
# But why?

---
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Why do these songs end so abruptly???

**Arybeck67** (7.7): a little generic

**shineflyer** (7): real nice harmonies.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Somewhat brief, kinda forgettable track, but there’s a lot of ambience here.

**Albert\_Cole** (6.8): Why

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): Fine

**MissyBee37** (6): The harmonies are beautiful. The lyrics are vague and don't really make any sense to me, but it's pretty.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Another boring song from John. I actually never found his and Yoko's relationship that interesting, and while this is pleasant to listen to, it's not much more than a pale clone of Something.

**zamomattel** (5): like the aahs but the rest is boring af

Poor Beach Boys. This really isn’t their day at all. One of my favourites from the album, this features more of Brian Wilson’s strong melody-writing, paired with a great guitar counterpoint in the outro. I promised myself I wouldn’t get salty about all this dragging of the Beach Boys, but this one hurt ngl.

---
# YOU KNOW I USED TO BE IN 1D

---
**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Strange to think Wilson was in his 20s when he wrote this, or so I presume; this seems like a good coming of age song. This doesn't detract from how good this album is objectively, but I always cringe listening to songs like this from the Beach Boys because I know that Brian's frustration would get even worse and worse.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I LOVE the compositions on this song. The lyrics are interestingly self-reflective, and the production is just gorgeous.

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): Wow Mike Love likeable for the ONLY time in his entire life, I really dig his vocals on here honestly, his voice is a little deeper and bassier. Who knows, if he was less of an asshole he coulda been the Paul to Brians John

**Arybeck67** (8.7): love the beat. Dammit this is SO hard!!!

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): Casually masterful. In some ways, the closest Pet Sounds comes to the pre-Pet Sounds sound. What sound did the pre-Pet Sounds sound sound like? This

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): lovely

---
# That’s Not For Me

---
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): One of the shortest tracks on the album, but a certified bop. I just feel like I’m waiting for payoff that never quite happens, unfortunately.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): His voice does not sound good here, but the production saves it

**MissyBee37** (4): The lyrics tell a nice story, but I'm so bored by the song and especially the melody.

**shineflyer** (4): kind of a bland track

The cry of a generation. r/lewronggeneration, in fact. However, this ode to insecurity in a rapidly-changing world is as relevant as it was back in 1966. Yet another outstanding track from Pet Sounds that goes early. Y’all better come through with the quality in top 20, or I swear…

---
# Sometimes, I feel very sad

---
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Gorgeous vocal melodies from Brian backed by more gorgeous harmonies from the rest of the group and lush instrumentation. I love that popping percussion that comes in on the slow sections

**dirdbub** (9): wow, second verse is relatable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Not my favorite (still one of them), but it’s still more proof the second half of this record is possibly better than the first. The layered vocals and ooohs are wonderful.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): r/lewronggeneration

**Arybeck67** (8.9): THE HARMONIES ARE BEAUTIFUL

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.8): Poor Brian. I wonder if Reddit was around in the '60s, he would've just browsed the latest memes instead of writing Pet Sounds?

**minibjork** (8.5): [Mood.](https://imgur.com/42DiToh)

**Albert\_Cole** (7): Invented emos

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Last song I like on the album, funny to think that people were thinking this even more than fifty years ago. I wonder if similar feelings have been expressed by a person who wants to live in the future.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): relatable title

---
# Sometimes, I feel very mad

---
**shineflyer** (5.5): there's something about the sunny Beach Boys repeating "Sometimes I feel very sad..." Like, it sounds cheery on the sruface, but...

**ignitethephoenix** (5): At this point in the album, most of these one just sound the same to me. They are nice and there’s nothing bad, but it’s just all kind of background music to me. Also is there only one singer in this band?? Or do they all sound the same? I want to hear different voices!

**MissyBee37** (5): The lyrics are strong, solid vocal, but the instrumental is grating. I have the same problem I often do with the Beach Boys where the melody feels monotonous. I do like the refrain.

**mustangs16** (5): i understand what brian wilson is saying here. it's a message that still resonates 50+ years later. that doesn't stop this song as coming off as whiny.

**zamomattel** (3.5): did rupaul write this about millenials

OK, how many of y’all actually listened to this from start to finish in one go? Be honest. The longest song in the rate, this one was quite controversial amongst voters. I’m willing to bet the length hurt its scores. I suppose a 7-minute trance of a guitar solo isn’t exactly aimed towards a community who focuses on less experimental song structure, so it’s not surprising this one sank to the high 20s after a strong showing in the top 20 for most of last month.

---
# BIG GIRLS, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL

---
**DraculaWeekend** (10): One of my favorite songs and definitely a contender for my 11. Those last ~ 3minutes are something else.

**jamesfog** (10): I will NOT hear cries of this song being too long - it is a and a masterpiece !

**kappyko** (10): this groove is irresistible. it's easier to get into this than oh! darling

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of my very favorite John-written Beatles songs and it has only 14 different words in it. The song just builds from the bluesy groove at the beginning to the end, where everything is just epically building and John is just wailing the lyrics. That grinding guitar riff is so instantly recognizable, Billy Preston just goes nuts on the organ, and the abrupt cutoff just fits so oddly well with everything that came before it.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): When I saw the length, I was going to sarcastically give this 7.8 points, one for each minute it goes on. But then I actually listened to it and I really enjoyed it

**dropthehammer11** (9): This is a long song, which keeps it from a 10, but it's still fucking dope. It has the 60s equivalent of a pop drop.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): A true showcase of the Beatles' prowess. Plus Billy Preston absolutely kills it on the organ. It's so bluesy and woosy, and yes, heavy too. A great window into John's mind at the time, and a preview of his sometimes screamy, Yoko Ono-centric solo career. A perfect way to end Side 1 and set up Side 2: the treacherous, stormy night giving way to the light of day

**mustangs16** (9): would be getting a ten in a "normal" rate. the simplicity of the lyrics add to the heavy, almost obsessive mood evoked by the instrumental.

---
# I don’t want it, I don’t want it, I don’t want it, I don’t want it at all

--- 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): an incredible, inventive, layered instrumental wasted on lazy, senseless, annoying lyrics

**shineflyer** (7.5): she thicc. It's long, but that's because it's a jam song, you know?

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Very good guitar work. However, it may be a little long and over indulgent. Also why does it cut off so abruptly? It really caught me off guard.

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): TOO long but as I've gotten older I start to like the looping part more and more

**cryptopian** (7): I like what this brought to the genre, though the fade-out is a bit much

**poppinmmolly** (7): eh

**strawberryswing1** (7): I appreciate what it's going for, but this song gets annoying. That guitar solo tho >>>

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Really love the instruments on this song, but lyrically it’s too long and repetitive for me. And it ends so abruptly too?

**MissyBee37** (6.5): This song has strong parts but it's entirely too long to be that repetitive and it's rather on the nose lyrically. I like the guitar, especially that riff in between repetitions. The melody is fine the first couple times, but then it just drags on. I prefer the guitar version of the melody to the vocal.

**InfernalSolstice** (6): a great song 3x too long

**minibjork** (6): giving this a six for making me wait nearly 8 minutes before i could listen to here comes the sun

**morgchrist** (6): The Across The Universe version is better

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I...do not enjoy this song as much as the rest of Abbey Road. The guitar work is impressive, I must admit, but parts of it are obviously stolen from House of the Rising Sun, and after awhile it gets boring, artistry be damned. I don't get the point about it stopping suddenly in the end either.

**LuckyKidA** (5): I'm not even sure I listened to the right song because the Youtube videos all got taken down.

**Mudkip1** (5): oh my I was fine with this until about 3 mins in when i checked on it and saw i wasnt even halfway through the song. the instrumental's cool but the lyrics were a bit lackluster

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I have nothing against long songs, and I have nothing against repetition, but honestly, maybe I’m missing something here. It’s 8 minutes long, with lyrics that barely change, and that’s fine. The instrumental switches up, but I just really found this grating to listen to. It’s super experimental, and it was probably monumental at the time, but outside from the outro (which takes too long to get to), this song feels like a chore to get through.

**zamomattel** (4.5): she aint heavy shes my brother

A curious song, written about the band’s financial clashes with the label, I believe. It starts out quite nicely, with Paul’s vocals over piano. However, the groove soon kicks in and it becomes a low-key bop. I suppose I only gave it a somewhat lower score because I associate it with bad memories as a teen.

# GIVE ME YOUR FUCKIN MONEY

---
**kappyko** (10): if you emphasize a different word in the title every time you repeat it the sentence's meaning will change completely. OH MY GOD THE 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 part IS INTERPOLATED IN A SUFJAN STEVENS SONG

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): there's only good songs in this rate and it's getting exhausting trying to figure out my 11

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The medley gets off to an amazing start here. George complained about money being taken away back in 1966, and now Paul's talking his criticisms from a governmental issue to problems within their own label. The way he joins melodies here is absolutely brilliant. Every new section of this song could stand within itself.

**shineflyer** (10): An example that how long you play/sing a note makes can make a melody more insteresting.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.7): I love this song; it's a really fun one to play, and I think it sets up the medley perfectly. It's sort of a wonderful little medley unto itself. The individual parts are all good, but they fit together to make something great. My favourite section's probably the honky tonk, 'Out of college, money spent' part, but it's all great

**cryptopian** (9.5): This song is so colourful, I love it!

**mustangs16** (9): a beautiful song, one that is obviously the focal point of the medley that comprises the second half of abbey road, that illustrated to the world the inner issues within the band. definitely rather bittersweet.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is giving me CCR vibes and I am blessed.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Probably the most complete song of the second-half medley, a groovy track that has some great harmonies and a nice almost satirical edge on Paul's part.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): hot take? underrated part of the medley

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): does get repetitive towards the ending but it's still a great song

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Pauls VOICE!!!

---
# No thx, I am rich already

---
**Albert\_Cole** (7.3): what even is this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): relatable title

**ExtraEater** (5): the reprise of this on carry that weight is much better

**zamomattel** (5): the first minute or so I was having a good time, but it fell apart a bit after that
