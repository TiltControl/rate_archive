[RATE] Legends of Pop: All-Time Classics Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7nkaux/rate_legends_of_pop_alltime_classics_rate/

#Happy New Year, r/popheads! 

2018 is sure to bring even messier rates to our HUMBLE. community and I for one cannot wait. I want to thank everybody who voted or supported this rate suggestion. The only reason we get to do this rate is because of your support, so I thank you for your #goodtaste.

Gaga dominated. Kanye slaughtered. [Kehlani limped to the top.](https://media.giphy.com/media/J1ioeXJv5muxa/giphy.gif) Carly was crowned. Taylor tried. And yet, despite these skinny legends claiming their places at #1, popheads cried out, “What about our legacy acts? The ones still touring in their 70s, the ones who are no longer with us: what about them?” Lo and behold, the Lorde Mod smiled upon us and granted us the opportunity to participate in this clash of titans.

So let’s get started with what has the potential to be a very hotly-contested rate. Welcome to the Legends of Pop: All-Time Classics rate! I’m /u/sletrab07 and I will be your straight white male host– whoops, I’ve been banned. This month’s rate contains three albums that are consistently ranked amongst the greatest of all time. All three of them are pop, rock and folk albums that delved into progressive pop production and composition, pioneering the genre that is still dominating nearly 60 years on. Their critical praise is near-unanimous in its perfection. 

They are:

- **The Beach Boys – Pet Sounds**

- **The Beatles – Abbey Road**

- **Fleetwood Mac – Rumours**

Side note: These albums are obviously quite old. They’re going to have slightly different fare to what we usually rate (although I don’t think anybody’s going into this expecting to hear iconic hoe anthems), but I know you’re all smart, switched-on people, so you’ll know to put them into context when you critique them. Let’s get started!

#The Beach Boys – Pet Sounds


*Pet Sounds*, the 11th album by The Beach Boys, came at a crossroads for the band. They had ditched their beach aesthetic and frontman Brian Wilson had resigned from touring after overwhelming stress. It was during this time that Wilson channelled his efforts into songwriting, with a little bit of experimentation with LSD. His subsequent writing partnership with lyricist Tony Asher resulted in the majority of the album’s songs.

The album itself is a concept album, regarded as the first of rock music. Wilson wished to create an album with no filler tracks, hoping to make “the greatest rock album ever made”. The album mixes conventional rock instrumentation with orchestration, found sounds and vocal harmonies. Wilson used what he considered his “pet” sounds, or his favourites. The record primarily deals with introspective emotions, feelings of doubt and longing and crises of love. Teen angst is explored in the sunny opening “Wouldn’t It Be Nice.” Confusion and disorientation (“That’s Not Me”, “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times”) and intimate hymns of love (“You Still Believe in Me”, “Don’t Talk”, “God Only Knows”) frequently feature. The addition of two instrumental tracks (“Let’s Go Away for Awhile” and “Pet Sounds”) are intended to express the alienation explored in the vocal tracks. Even hit song “Sloop John B” tells the story of a sailor who feels out of step with his predicament.

Initial reviews were mixed when *Pet Sounds* released in 1966. US critics especially didn’t like how remote and experimental it was in comparison to their earlier work, dismissing it as work for “a feminine audience.” However, from the late 60s onwards, the album was re-evaluated and gained a much more positive response, with critics now understanding what the band was trying to achieve. The album is now showered with praise and is widely regarded as one of the most influential albums in history, as well as the most statistically acclaimed album of all time.

#The Beatles – Abbey Road

Coming off the back of some unpleasant recording sessions, The Beatles went back to basics for *Abbey Road*. Recording the album over 6 months, August 1969 saw the album completed and “marked the last time all four band members were present in a studio together”. Despite the positive mood of the recording sessions, tensions allegedly rose between Paul McCartney and John Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, who sat in on sessions and clashed with the band. 

*Abbey Road*’s two halves represent “a compromise” – Lennon wished to make a more traditional album with “distinct and unrelated songs”, while McCartney and George Martin wanted to incorporate a medley, continuing from their previous work on *Sgt. Peppers*. Side one features some of the band’s all-time classics: “Come Together”, “Something” and “Here Comes the Sun”, to name a few. Side two features a 16-minute medley of eight songs. Some songs end quite definitively, while others segue directly into the next track. It all climaxes in the show-stopping trilogy of “Golden Slumbers”, “Carry That Weight” and “The End.” Despite its title, “The End” is not, technically, the end. McCartney left a hidden track at the end of the album, a first for rock music. “Her Majesty” is a brief 23 seconds and is meant to be tongue-in-cheek. After it didn’t make the album, McCartney instructed it to be destroyed. Their label’s policy didn’t allow for this and the tape operator left it in after a short silence in the recording. 

Upon release, *Abbey Road* received mixed reviews, with criticism for the artificial sound of the production. Over time, many critics have warmed to it and now regard it as the Beatles’ greatest album, putting it on par with *Sgt. Peppers*. Reviews include: “★★★★★” Rolling Stone; “10/10” Pitchfork; “A” AV Club and “A+” Consequence of Sound.

The album cover features the now-iconic image of the band members on the Abbey Road zebra crossing. The image has been recreated and parodied countless times in pop culture, just a testament to this album and this band’s everlasting legacy.

#IMPORTANT UPDATE ON ABBEY ROAD:

After sending out a call the other day for people to vote on how they wanted to rate the Abbey Road medley, I got 40 in favour of combining songs together vs 26 in favour of voting individually. I've consulted with various authorities on The Beatles and have combined the following songs:

- Mean Mr Mustard / Polythene Pam / She Came In Through the Bathroom Window

- Golden Slumbers / Carry That Weight / The End

#Fleetwood Mac – Rumours

Like the other two albums, *Rumours* came at a hard time for Fleetwood Mac. This is an instance where the in-studio tension gave birth to some of the album’s most potent lyrics. Members Christine and John McVie divorced after eight years of marriage. Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were “having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often.” Mick Fleetwood was also having domestic problems, having learned that his wife and mother of two children was having an affair with his best friend. The band had no time to come to terms with their respective separations before recording for *Rumours* began. They were not on speaking terms and only discussed musical matters inside the studio. 

On top of this, the media were printing inaccurate stories about the band, including Buckingham suffering a serious illness, mistakenly reporting Nicks and Buckingham the parents of Fleetwood’s daughter and a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members. In addition to the toxic work environment, “extensive use of cocaine marked much of the album's production.” It was stated that “The band would come in at 7 at night, have a big feast, party till 1 or 2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording.”

The album deals with troubled relationships. The band did not realise how extensively the lyricists were focusing on their various relationships separations until the album was completed. Each song was written by separate lyricists, except for “The Chain”, which the whole band wrote together. Nicks famously wrote “Dreams” on break in about 10 minutes, while the band recorded next door. Along with “Dreams”, some of the bands’ greatest songs are featured, including “Don’t Stop”, “Go Your Own Way”, “Songbird” and “The Chain.” Upon a re-release, the band added “Silver Springs” to the album, a B-side that was intended to be on the album.

The album was lauded by critics. The band dubbed it as “the most important record [they] ever made.” Young, up-and-coming indie artist Lorde has called the album “a perfect record.” Scoring the elusive 10/10 on Pitchfork, 5 stars by Rolling Stones and endless other publications, *Rumours* takes its place as the greatest album of Fleetwood Mac’s career.

#I GOT NEW RULES, I STOLE ‘EM
 
If you’ve done a rate before, you better follow these rules. If this is your first time, definitely read this!

-  **Listen to EVERY song** and **assign EVERY song a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **do not give decimal scores that have two decimal spots:**

> 9.1 | This is fine

> 9.11 | This is not fine

> 9.111111 | Nyet
 
/u/letsallpoo is a god amongst men and has created a program to sort out rate scores. If you don’t follow the correct format, the program won't work properly and you will ruin the rate. Tread lightly.

- **I will be enforcing a minimum average for this rate.** If your average for any given album is below a certain threshold, I won't accept your scores and you'll have to resend them. It's a reasonable minimum, so just rate sensibly and you'll be fine. I will come down on you if I think you're intentionally trying to sabotage the results and not just rating songs based on how well you like them. You're allowed to dislike an album, but there's a point of reasonableness.

-  I don't want to see you giving every song on an album a 10. Be realistic and have some nuance in your scores.

- I’ll send out confirmation replies once I’ve officially accepted your scores. I’ll be checking that they are in the proper format and follow the set rules.

- You can discuss your scores with others, but do **NOT** actively campaign to sabotage certain songs so others can win. 

- You have the option to give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11.** Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. You do not have to use them.

- You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards with [this link!]( https://tinyurl.com/ybj4cc76)

- You need to send scores in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post**, such as right [here](https://tinyurl.com/ybj4cc76). USE THIS. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** use that format to send in your scores.

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song, write it right after your score. **Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!** Comments are **NOT** confidential.

- If you want to attach a comment to an album, **add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!**

- If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song please feel free to message me about changing scores and I will respond accordingly.

**This is the ONLY correct format:**
>God Only Knows: 11 The best part of Love Actually, you say? The iconic BBC Music ad? The greatest song ever recorded?

**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
>God Only Knows: 0: Beach Boys worst song tbh

>God Only Knows: im here to sabotage11

>God Only Knows: I'm giving it a 1 (don’t be like that, support independent artists!)

>God Only Knows: 11-[FRESH]

>God Only Knows: 11 (I only listen to real music)

Once more, [HERE](https://tinyurl.com/ybj4cc76) is the link to submit your scores. And with that, the rate has begun!
