Oh man, I adore this song. It sounds like my old school concert band, coupled with a legendary pop group. The “hoist up the John B sail” chorus features gorgeous harmonies and the melody writing is so sharp, it cuts a little. If you had to pick the 3 catchiest songs off Pet Sounds, these final 3 Beach Boys ones absolutely take the spot. 

---
# I don’t wanna go home!

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): The bass alone gets a solid 10. Especially when it jumps into double time. This song's ridiculous in the best possible way. Makes me want to form a barbershop quartet and travel from continent to continent, serenading the world

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Holy shit this is explosive, and probably the best track on the album if it wasn’t for the next song. This is literally the bible for psychedelia, and the “trip” line literally invented acid so../

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): When I first listened, this was my least favorite song because I didn't think it fit sonically with the album. But on re-listens, I realized how wrong I initially was. All the things Pet Sounds does so perfectly are used so well on here, from some great harmonies between Brian and Mike Love to the layered instruments. A cover of a traditional Bahamian folk song is an interesting song in the middle of this very self-reflective album, but Brian Wilson works it into the sound and feel of Pet Sounds so perfectly.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): too real I always wanna go home too

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): Finally, a song I can relate to! "Why don't they let me go home" indeed?

**Arybeck67** (9): TOTAL BOP "I WANNA GO HOME!"

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): I wannnaaaa go home

**Mudkip1** (9): this is fun

**mustangs16** (9): i have higher standards for what deserves a 10 in this rate -- basically, my tens are going to songs that i wish i could give elevens -- but a 9 here fits. it's one of their bigger hits for a reason.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I can't believe how much of this album is happy sounding, but with really depressing lyrics. This song is probably the best example of that, and it pulls it off really well.

**Verdantshade** (9): the song breaks up the flow of love songs on the album. if not for the lyrics, this would be a 10 as the melody is one of the brian wilson's best

**cryptopian** (8.7): Because every 60s song needs a not-so-subtle drugs reference

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): I don’t know what Sloop John B is, but this song is decent.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I looked this up on Wikipedia and I wasn't surprised to hear that this was originally a folk song. Fine, and I like the double meaning of 'this is the worst trip I've been on' (I didn't know LSD could make you hallucinate shitty vacations in all their glory). It definitely gets into my head a lot. But it's not what I was expecting.

---
# I wanna go home

**dropthehammer11** (7): this made me think of ships ahoy which made me think of chips ahoy and i went to get cookies and i am happy

**shineflyer** (6): one of the most "normal Beach Boys" tracks on here. But then again, there's the glockenspiel. It's a funny little track.

**MissyBee37** (4): I respect songs that really commit to a story, but this is an odd one. I just don't care for it. The song does have a nice, catchy flow, especially with the percussion, but the vocal annoys me.

**zamomattel** (2): I really don’t like this but I don’t know why, I think the songs on this album just sound too similar to each other. I KNOW IT’S A CLASSIC or something but it pales against the competition

Christine McVie DOMINATES here. Such a boppy track and so shady. An impressive finish for this song, considering it was stuck out of the top 15 for such a long time. Sadly, it misses out on top 10, but when the songs are such quality, something has to go!

---
**deadspiderwall** (10): I love this song so much :)

**Mudkip1** (10): i never did beliIIIIEEEEEE E E EEEEEEEEVee in the wAAAYYs of mAAAgic.. but i'm beginning to wonder why..

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Very sweet song that still manages to be an infectious bop, it's a welcome return to optimism after the past three tracks. Legitimately sounds like a miracle.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The first time I heard this song was playing Rock Band with a few friends. I remember liking it instantly, from the magical lyrics of the chrous to the subtle wind chimes. The guitar line is pretty nice too. On my standard karaoke rotation.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Another kinda forgotten track when talking about the album, but it still was a chart smash. It’s got some wonderful vocals, another beautiful chorus, and probably one of the more optimistic views on the record.

**zamomattel** (10): this album is definitely the most poppy, if this was slightly repurposed donna summer could sing it

**Arybeck67** (9.5): oof so much drama around this. John thought this was about him but no, its about Christine's secret lover.

**ExtraEater** (9): has got the groove

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Probably the most dated sounding song on the album, but it’s still incredible. I can’t give it less than this score tbh, Christine is too good and the guitars are just orgasmic.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): I really like this one. Love can bloom more than once.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Really love the bassline and melodies on here.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.4): Doesn't quite live up to the title

**minibjork** (8): christine voice 👌🏾👌🏾

**mustangs16** (8): while re-listening to rumours for this rate i realized that one of the songs on niall horan's solo album references this song, which delighted me. anyways. it's a similar sentiment as "never going back again," but that doesn't take away from either song.

**shineflyer** (7.3): this song has movement to it, but is still emotional, which is always a great combo. (It does have a bit of that cheesy disco sound, though.)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): it's alright

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): eh it's fine

**MissyBee37** (6): The music doesn't feel as positive or optimistic as the lyrics here. They seem mismatched.

Wow. I was NOT expecting this song to do so well. I honestly didn’t think nearly as much of it as the rest of you did. Massive props to Silver Springs, a song that wasn’t even included on the original release of the album. This one started in the 20s and just worked its way up from there. I’m pretty sure I saw it at #10 at one point. Unfortunately, it gets cut short, but again, the competition is so fierce today.

---
# Silver and Gold

**Arybeck67** (11): my god, I could spend all day talking about how this is the greatest song ever created. It encapsulates both the anger and sadness of an end of a relationship. The wanting and the bitterness every new day brings you. Stevie's voice is so passionate and angry, but also wistful at the same time. The bridge is pop perfection. It is a travesty that this was not on the original album. It is an absolute MASTERPIECE.

**Franklytheturtle** (11): I could type up a huge essay about how relateable this song is and how I always think of that one person every time this song comes on but I think this song just speaks for itself. It's got so much power and sadness and anger and just pure catharsis that is just unrivaled in anything I've ever heard before. It's the perfect send off to someone who did you wrong and I honestly don't think it gets any better than this song. The lyricism is on another level Stevie's vocals are just other worldly and honestly this is just a perfect song. This has grown to be my favorite or second favorite song ever and I can't even tell you how many times I've lost my voice screaming this song

**Leixander** (11): I discovered Fleetwood Mac thanks to Lykke Li's cover of this song and I'm in love since. Chorus is perfection.

**poppinmmolly** (11): absolutely this is my 11. This is such a pretty song. One of my favorites of all time. The 1997 live version from The Dance is way better though. More emotion in Stevie's voice. Gives me chills every time.

**theburningundead** (11): this whole song is stunning but the last 90 seconds is just incredible, definite highlight of the album. "you'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you" is such a powerful line and sung with so much emotion, gives me chills every time

**ExtraEater** (10): absolute weariness in a song

**Mudkip1** (10): 'You'll never get away from the sound / Of the woman who loves you' is such a haunting lyric. love this song a lot.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): it pains me that this didn’t make it on the official tracklist of the album, a spectacular track and another example of Stevie being the witch goddess that she is.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): It's a good thing that we included this track in the rate, because it's going to be bringing up my Rumours score by a lot. This is the best vocal performance from Stevie Nicks I've heard so far, and the imagery the title brings is absolutely wonderful-I don't have any visual synesthasia, but I'd be damned if this song doesn't feel brilliant silver to me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A track left off the original release of Rumours, it’s something I haven’t heard as often as the others because I usually listen to my record instead (I have an original pressing, woo!) and it doesn’t have this track. But honestly, this should’ve been on the album. More Stevie Nicks is always more than appreciated and this track in particular has some of the coolest production on the entire record, with a mesmerizing instrumental and some flawless vocals. If only records could’ve stored more songs...

**shineflyer** (8): I honestly don't really have words for this one. But it's a strong song.

---
# Rusted Silver

**Albert\_Cole** (7.7): Wikipedia says Nicks came up with the name when they drove past a road sign in Montgomery County, Maryland. Which means this song could easily have been called "Chevy Chase", "Dickerson", or "Friendship Heights Village" if Lindsey had driven down a different road

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.7): This song sits proudly in the pantheon of songs that were cut from albums, but really shouldn't have been. Right next to Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields (though not nearly as good as those two)

**MissyBee37** (7.5): Heartbreaking lyrics. Pretty song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): decent outro, not very memorable

**mustangs16** (7): i know this was supposed to be on rumours from the start, and it makes sense lyrically, but i also definitely prefer i don't want to know.

**ClocktowerMaria** (6): it's fine

**hypertonality** (6): This is not included in the version of the album I have, but I don't like how it finishes up the album in the deluxe.

An absolute classic. I used to love it a lot more, but I find it a little hokey as an adult. It’s so cheery and infectious though, how can you not sing along? This is the ONLY song out today that didn’t receive a single 11. Can you believe the quality we’re being served today?

---
# Don’t stop, make it pop, DJ blow my speakers up

**ExtraEater** (10): invented optimism

**Mudkip1** (10): love the chorus and the instrumentals on this one

**mustangs16** (10): this song is obviously about moving forward from a nasty breakup, as is the rest of rumours, but personally it's a song that helped me a lot when i was going through some pretty hard times, mental health wise. it's just such an optimistic way of viewing moving past hard times.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): God I love Lindsey’s voice for some reason, he could sing fucking Gucci Gang and I’d still stan

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The album goes on track here, with a brand new optimistic track to counter the previous pessimism. I actually find the lyrics to be genuinely motivating, and perhaps even good advice. Just as good as Madonna's!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally an iconic classic rock track. I absolutely adore that opening drumroll that fades in, and the opening vocals really just feel so full and powerful. This is premier roof down open highway driving music and nothing else quite feels as freeing as this track, and serves as a nice, positive antithesis to something introspective and melancholy like Dreams.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.3): Woo

**poppinmmolly** (9): Bill Clinton's campaign song lol

**Arybeck67** (8.6): I honestly never understood the hype around this song, but I do like it

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I actually didn't know this song was a Fleetwood Mac song before this rate. I knew the song, I just had no idea who song it, so I was a little suprised to hear it show up here.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.7): A happy little ditty indeed. One of the most overtly optimistic on the album

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): DONT STOP BELIEVIN

**ClocktowerMaria** (7): again fairly fun and peppy

---
# Stop
**MissyBee37** (7): This song feels like a pep talk or inspirational bit of wisdom from a friend.The lyrics and music together form a strong positive energy. Not my favorite vocal, but a solid song.

**shineflyer** (6): this is cheesy as fuck, but it's good fun

**zamomattel** (3.5): ok I irrationally dislike this song, maybe its because peter kay covered it or something on children in need and through him I am unable to like it again

Oh my god, this is such a classic and legendary song, why did it not do better?! God, this is a shame. Probably my favourite part of Abbey Road. Golden Slumbers and Carry That Weight is one of my favourite combinations in the history of music, it’s the definition of anthemic. God, this feels so wrong. I’m sorry Beatles stans, this deserved better.

---
# BOYYYY, YOU’RE GONNA CARRY THAT WEIGHT

**ClocktowerMaria** (11): Okay okay okay, Pauls VOICE yet again on Golden Slumbers oh my god gorgeous, lovely, wonderful. Carry That Weight makes me wanna cry too I love it so much. And THEN The Ends incredible guitar work and that DRUM SOLO and then the "LOVE YOU!" part then the "AND IN THE END" part all come together so perfectly that this has to be an 11 and it was God Only Knows before know as i was writing this but I'm changing it sorry.

**dirdbub** (10): favorite part - "Carry That Weight"

**ExtraEater** (10): all three are great, but segued together as one thing they really make up something wonderful

**kappyko** (10): yah yah yah yah!!!! I fuckning love The End

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Golden Slumbers was the Beatles song I liked before I liked the Beatles. It's stunning - bittersweet instrumentation and chord progression, and surely one of Paul's best vocal performances. Carry That Weight and the End are good (and it's cool that Ringo was convinced to play his one and only solo) but they're really more examples of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Golden Slumbers, though... That one's a real show stopper. 'The love you take is equal to the love you make' is a pretty perfect encapsulation of the Beatles' message, though.

**mustangs16** (10): the perfect way to end this basically perfect album. "and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make" is a sentiment everyone should probably live by.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): iconic in every sense of the word

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The medley picks up again with these last three proper songs. I've always found Golden Slumbers underrated-Paul goes off again, yet the song sounds so much like a lullaby despite the powerful vocals. Carry That Weight is simply a special song, and The End is so bittersweet yet amazing. It feels sad to say goodbye to one of the most influential bands of all time, but, hey, at least we have All Things Must Pass coming up soon, no?

**poppinmmolly** (10): Story time: I was babysitting my infant cousin and she was getting fussy so I started singing Golden Slumbers to her to soothe her but I got into that and couldn't stop because she would have started crying again so I just went into Carry That Weight and kind of just did the whole medley a few times until she fell asleep. It was awesome.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): wow. so much happening in this one and it's all really put together. i wouldn't actually be surprised if it really was just one song.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): My favorite part of the medley and a perfect way to end the album. Golden Slumbers is wonderful, with some of my favorite vocals of Paul's. The drum solo in The End is what I'd show to anyone who calls Ringo a bad drummer just because he isn't flashy. The final line 'and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make' is wonderfully Beatles and a great way to end their last recorded album.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): More like Golden Scalpings

**shineflyer** (9.5): Starts off so beautifully, becomes triumphant, has a reprise of my 2nd fave track on the album. And The End brings down the score a tad for not being amazing like the other two, but it's still good.

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Really strong finishing sequence for the album as a whole. Not a ten because the transition between sections could have smoother.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.4): Paul: "I will sing a lullaby" Also Paul: *begins belting at the top of his voice along with all his bandmates*

**cryptopian** (9): How to end an album with a bang

**zamomattel** (9): feels like the most theatrical moment on the album

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): I wish Carry That Weight was longer

**deadspiderwall** (8): I love these 3

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I really like the Carry the Weight section of these songs. The ending with the guitars is nice too.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Carry That Weight is probably my favorite here, but the medley is really nice as a whole.

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This medley feels much more cohesive than the previous set. It flows well, with strong lyrics that carry similar themes throughout. The lullaby and The End especially are quite pretty.

One of George’s greatest creations, Something is the ultimate love song. It’s tender, vulnerable and earnest all at once. This was done so dirty, though. This was at #4 for a VERY long time, and it’s sad to see it fall back here.

---
# This is genuinely touching

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Alright, buckle up, kids: this is the part where I explain why my icon in the Discord is always a photo of George Harrison. Imagine you're thirteen years old. You just discovered that you're a trans man, you live in a house full of religious fundamentalists, and you're starting your 'new music sucks!' phase. The only old band you actually end up being a huge fan of is the Beatles, and while your love for them eventually cools down a little, you still maintain an interest in George. You initially start using him as an avatar on social media sites because you're desperately looking for male celebrities to identify with in order to communicate the fact that yes, definitely, you've decided you're a man. Eventually, you still use George as an icon after you grow out of that phase because he looks pretty cool. But you learn more about George since he seems way nicer than what John and Paul were back in the day, and his wisdom, compassion, humour and spirituality show you that it's still possible to be religious and not a bigot, and that sometimes being famous and rich is inferior to being knowledgable and caring. You find a sensitive, gentle male musician to look up to, and that's what influences you to stop being an asshole. The fact that his songs are absolutely amazing is a nice bonus. And...yeah, I'm aware that I haven't said anything about this song itself, but I think everything I just said is perfectly captured in Something, which I consider George's magnum opus together with While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Isn't It A Pity. I may not be a huge fan of the Beatles anymore, but I'll always, always be a fan of George.

# Something = Everything

**Verdantshade** (11): perks of being a wallflower actually called my attention to this song (iirc charlie's aunt got him the record), but my love for it came many years later. my class was going on a trip abroad for a week and our flight was at 5am so i stayed up the whole night - i had watched 500 days of summer in the evening and the use of the smiths reminded me of perks. at some point in the night, i decided to make my own mixtape of music, so i included some songs from 500 days of summer (there is a light, bookends) and perks (vapour trail, something, heroes). to this day, these songs have been incredibly special to me, as they have been contextualised in my life with friendships. i gave something my 11 for this rate because not only is it my favourite song in the rate, but it encapsulates abbey road at it's finest - a rock album for sunny days, filled with love, hope and happiness.

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): George Harrison was so underrated during the Beatles days he's just as good a songwriter as the rest

**CopyCatJ** (10): This shit should be in the Louvre.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): So beautiful.

**ExtraEater** (10): favorite beatles song

**kappyko** (10): honestly how dare you

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Swooningly beautiful. The jump to A Major in the chorus is such a perfect tonal shift; George Harrison was really at the top of his game towards the end of the 60s (hence the massive All Things Must Pass release right after they split up). Frank Sinatra calling it the best Lennon/McCartney song just reaffirms why George needed to get out of the Beatles, and out of their shadow

**mustangs16** (10): honestly? this is the best love song ever recorded. fight me.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Beautiful

**poppinmmolly** (10): George was constantly overshadowed by Lennon/McCartney but honestly a very talented song writer in his own right.

**strawberryswing1** (10): classic, beautiful love song! Ed Sheeran could never

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): yo this is a jam

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of George's best written songs with the band, and just a beautiful love song. It's airy and passionate and even a little darker-toned and cinematic. It just builds so well.

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): Slow, sultry and seductive.

**MissyBee37** (9): The music fits so well the feeling of how captivated the singer is by the object of his affections, slinky and seductive. I like how it escalates when he sings about not knowing if this feeling will last or grow, like he's overwhelmed by thinking that far ahead, but he's stuck on her anyway.

**zamomattel** (8.5): there is nothing to say about this

**minibjork** (8): reason why george is the best beatle discourse

# Something = Nothing

**shineflyer** (8): It's a very pretty track. I constantly forget how that middle bridge goes, though.

**Arybeck67** (7.7): beautiful yes, but not the Beatles' best

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): But... what?

**LuckyKidA** (6.5): Ok Ok Ok George I see you.

---
# Sun, sun, sun, here I cum

**LazyDayLullaby** (11): The swirling storm clouds of I Want You (She's So Heavy) suddenly part, and the opening notes of Here Comes the Sun ring out. The contrast is simply perfect. It's in part because of this song that spring is my favourite season; it captures the feeling so well, of fresh air and warmth and hope. The guitar is effortlessly, serenely beautiful; the lyrics are evocative, pure, and utterly optimistic. The way the more dissonant bridge builds up to the effervescent return of the melody, and the sudden blossoming of the tender, soaringly beautiful Moog synth line.. It really feels like the ice is slowly melting, and better days lie ahead. It's George's masterpiece, and a true gem of a song

**MissyBee37** (11): This song is just lovely. It's among my favorite songs of all time. I absolutely love the melody, the instruments and the way it encapsulates a purely hopeful, joyful feeling.

**mustangs16** (11): my second favorite song of all time. it's beautiful, it's calming, it's optimistic, it's everything. i'm a person who really loves sun metaphors and imagery in art, which the beatles have in spades throughout their catalog, but here comes the sun outshines (heh) them all. it's perfection.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): doo doo doo doo

**dropthehammer11** (10): Come on, what can I say? Gorgeous piece of music.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Easily the best song on this album, and one of the best Beatles songs of all time. I love the guitar and the breezy chill feel of the song.

**kappyko** (10): wel yea

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is, like, George's 25th best song. It's even lower in the Beatles's catalogue. But, hey, it's still pretty good. Much more calming after the last track. Fun fact: when George's son Dhani was being born, he sang 'here comes the sun!' in the hospital room. Awww.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Another classic Beatles song. An iconic and widely influential in soft rock song that you can't help but to like.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is icon city right here. You haven’t lived until you’ve seen a sunrise with this on. That is all.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): A complete 180 from the previous song, but a nice way of showing the transition into the second half of the album. Another of George's best compositions coming from this album, it's bright and airy in all the right ways. If I need to think about the light at the end of a rough tunnel, I put this on.

**Verdantshade** (10): i first heard this song on bee movie (i went to the premiere of it in london as a kid!!!) and it was what made me fall in love with the beatles. fully deserving of my 11, but something is slightly more important to me

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): I Love love love the guitar on this track so much

**ExtraEater** (9): so sweet

**Albert\_Cole** (8): idk somehow this doesn't feel entirely earnest. Compared to Octopus's Garden, which is ridiculously innocent, this sounds like it has an undertone of "I'm coming out of the other end of a deep depression"

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): more like here comes the FUN

**cryptopian** (7.8): This is running at a 10 until halfway through when the song runs out of steam and they bring the Moog in

**dropthehammer11** (10): Charismatic, groovy, punchy...fucking amazing opener and one of my favorite Beatles songs. Damn near perfect.

**Mudkip1** (10): a classic

**mustangs16** (10): this is one of three songs i know how to play on the guitar, and the first one i learned. it's that good.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): THIS IS HOW YOU START AND ALBUM

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Far and away the best John song on this album, maybe their best opener. I actually find the original meaning of the 'shoot me's in the chorus just as creepy as how people see them nowadays. Being addicted to hard drugs and being shot are both really spooky and bad. I knew this was inspired by a political commercial, but I didn't know it actually started out as an campaign song until now.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): An iconic Beatles song with great instrumentals. I also really dig the absurdist lyrics. Although "He got feet down below his knees" really just feels like stating the obvious.

**strawberryswing1** (10): I can't listen to this now without thinking "come together right now over me" makes it a hoe anthem and I hate you all for that

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): lowkey a gay anthem, tbh. "come together... over me?" hot

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): That bassline is just killer, and it works super well with John Lennon's off-kilter lyrics. The chorus is fantastic as well.

**Verdantshade** (10): so i was at a harry styles concert quite recently and this was played over the speakers between the opening act (muna) and harry, and literally when this came on every teenage girl started singing it

**Albert\_Cole** (9.5): What an album opener! I can't tell whether this is nonsense, or I'm just too dumb to understand it.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): So, so groovy. A song to bring the world together. I have a fond memory of deciphering which Beatle each section is referring to with friends. Special thanks to Timothy Leary for inspiring this song. Imagine what the world would look like if he'd beaten Reagan in the race for Governor of California and went on to become president?

**ClocktowerMaria** (9): That pause before "Over Me" is so dope, also the solo is so so good

**kappyko** (9): holy moley this is a sassy anthem but lowkey the instrumental bridge drops a .5 bc it kinda feels restrained imn sorry lol

**shineflyer** (9): I love a good word salad, and a literally iconic bassline.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song takes a bit to get to that bursting, bellowing halfway point, but it’s brilliant when it hits. Unfortunately, for me the song is a bit too long, at least in this album version.

**zamomattel** (9): I saw mary j blige and jlo cover this live and it was the best thing ever. That cover would get a 12

**Arybeck67** (8.7): how can you not like this song?

**MissyBee37** (8.5): This song is such a classic, even if the lyrics are a bit odd and cryptic. I love the sound, though. That beat? Iconic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): I quite like it but what are those lyrics

**ExtraEater** (8): amazingly simple

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Love the bass line and drums in this song, but it’s a little more underwhelming than I remember it.

**poppinmmolly** (8): a bop

---
# I am a pure Christian, so pls do not come at all ty

**morgchrist** (7.6): This is only like their third or fourth-best album tbh

**Overall average**: 7.891

You want to start an argument with someone? Imply that this album is the greatest Beatles album. Or literally any of them. You can’t win. Their fans are too many and too divided. Nevertheless, Abbey Road is an astonishing achievement, a last hoorah for a band divided by ego and outside factors. The fact that they were able to put it aside as they plugged away at this album is something truly special and I hope r/popheads appreciated the magic that The Beatles captured in this album. Featuring some of their all-time greats, as well as a solid lineup of their back catalogue, Abbey Road is a masterpiece in pop and rock innovation.

---
**mustangs16**: the best album ever recorded, and a fitting end to the beatles' journey as a band. this album is the beatles at their absolute best. i don't know if there's a weak moment.

**Mudkip1**: a couple of weird bumps in the road (lol pun ahahah) but otherwise an incredibly solid album

**dirdbub**: since I'm a baby and think that the "The Beatles suck and did nothing for music" meme is completely unfunny I've started doing it to other artists and tbh that's what's deserved for pushing this meme @popheads

**shineflyer**: Definitely one of the Beatles' best.

**Verdantshade**: the first beatles album i heard and my 2nd favourite album by them (behind revolver). i associate this with youth, happiness, summers and my dad and will love this album forever for that

**DraculaWeekend**: I'm not going to lie, I didn't really get into The Beatles until I saw that Across the Universe movie. In fact, I even like some of their renditions of Beatles songs more than the originals. Anyway, this album has so many 10s it's crazy. Truly a classic.

**agentofscranton**: i put myself off listening to anything by the beatles for the longest time because back in the days when i was ashamed for listening to pop music, any time i'd accidentally let slip that i liked anything by any big pop girl i'd get chastised and told to listen to REAL (straight) music like the beatles not trash like katy perry or taylor swift - but whatever, eventually I got over it and started listening to the beatles, and I started with this album and it remains a firm favourite of mine

**patronsaintofaspies**: I personally prefer the White Album, but objectively, I'm pretty sure this is their best record. It serves as a much better conclusion than Let It Be!

**dropthehammer11**: The first album I ever heard. I will always love this.

**cryptopian**: Of the three, feels like the most cohesive album, especially the side B medley. Lots of great little instrumental details and gloriously catchy songwriting.

**LazyDayLullaby**: First of all, I just adore this album. But I also love the mythology surrounding it; the image of the broken band picking themselves up and hitting one last homerun, out of respect for their shared history, and just to show the world (and themselves) that they still could. Abbey Road really is the culmination of all their acquired expertise and individual talents; it's the Beatles striving to make the perfect Beatles album. If every band could go out on an album this strong, well then Abbey Road would still be fantastic, but there would probably also be world peace

Hot take: this is Fleetwood’s most overrated song. It’s so catchy, I just wish I enjoyed Lindsey’s vocals more. Y’all did though, and this one climbed higher and higher each day until it reached top 5. That chorus is so iconic, no argument.

--- 
# YOU CAN GO YOUR OWN WAYYYYY

**agentofscranton** (10): iconic - a second choice for my 11

**CopyCatJ** (10): Buckingham did my girl Stevie dirty but it bops.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): YOU CAN GO YOUR OWN WAAAAYYYY

**ExtraEater** (10): the most raw sendoff

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The OG breakup song. I love the drums and guitar in the song and how aggressive it is. It’s also such an iconic song, if you mention Fleetwood Mac to someone, this is probably one of the first songs you think about

**kappyko** (10): u should GO YOUR OWN WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY

**Mudkip1** (10): god the lyrics on this one cut like a knife, they're so powerful

**mustangs16** (10): sometimes things don't work out, no matter how badly you want them to, and this song is one of the best at putting that experience into words. "if i could, maybe i'd give you my world/how can i when you won't take it from me" gets to me every time. like, nothing better demonstrates that feeling of wanting to give someone everything when they're just not interested.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Well, if I didn't love George to the death this would definitely get my 11. The lyrics are only made painful by the fact that the breakup described here happened within the band itself, and the chorus is one of the most passionate ones I've ever heard. Very, very powerful.

**shineflyer** (10): This is one of those songs that just feels like it's a part of the universe now. It's not just a Fleetwood Mac song, it's everyone's song. I love the harmony on the chorus, I love the forward motion the song has... idk, I just love this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Rumours is truly iconic rock track after iconic rock track. The chorus is just so massive, you get this feel that the band was really going for that stadium rock sound (although that really wasn’t as much of a thing at that point), while also making what is normally considered to be their most intimate record. It’s a smart powerhouse pop track.

**Verdantshade** (10): when i think of a rock song, this is the song that usually comes to mind. the song, and particularly the guitar solo, is timeless

**zamomattel** (10): the centrepiece of this album definitely

**Arybeck67** (9.9): not a ten in honor of Stevie, but I love this song. It is so biting, the "shacking up is you want to do" line gets me every time. Poor Stevie ):

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): the guitars are soooooO perfect

**Albert\_Cole** (9.1): This song makes me want to do exciting things, which is a shame because I have to do homework instead

**MissyBee37** (9): This song is so freeing. It's bittersweet but ultimately hopeful, looking to the future. I love the melody.

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Really energetic and exciting

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this is good but i swear next time someone tries to tell me music nowadays is more repetitive than it used to be im gonna punch them in their neck

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.6): A good song, and one of the most emblematic of the album's themes of broken relationships, and moving on.

God, this is literally the sunniest song of all time. An ode to teens wishing to grow up faster, The Beach Boys struck gold with this absolute classic of a song. You may know the song from some iconic Cadbury ads back in the early 2000s. So beautiful, yet so boppy.

---
# It would be nice

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): A pop masterpiece and the perfect execution of the Wall of Sound style. The lyrics are a simple, beautiful picture of young love. It's uncertainly written, and almost juvenile, but works so well for the song. The gorgeous harmonies of the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson's incredibly layered production just compliment each other and the lyrics so well, creating a wonderful sound that continues throughout the album.

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Duhhhhh, this song is kinda sad though and I feel people don't recognize that.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song is just so pleasant. How can you not smile while listening to it?

**ExtraEater** (10): the first 5 seconds whew

**kappyko** (10): jesus chitstga

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): The perfect picture of young love. Everything about it resonates and rings with an overflowing, almost overwhelming, innocent joy

**LuckyKidA** (10): Too wholesome. Why aren't they having sex? Where is the sex?

**mustangs16** (10): this is a song that means a whole awful lot to me, and it honestly pains me that i can't give it an 11. the optimism, the idealism, in this song captures young love like maybe no other song has ever done.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Perfect opening to the album that captures the intimacy and daydreaming of Wilson's lyrics. One of the songs that stands out open first listen.

**Verdantshade** (10): relationship goals tbh

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): Yes... yes, it would be.

**cryptopian** (9): Packed full of great hooks, vocal harmony and all that. Quintessential Beach Boys!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I love how this song has two choruses, it really makes the song feel so dynamic and fresh, and the outro is just plain amazing, I almost wish it lasted longer as I could probably listen to it forever (although maybe that’s just the Animal Collective fan in me speaking).

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): it would

**Arybeck67** (8.5): An actual true bop. Brian Wilson is a genius

**MissyBee37** (8.5): I love the lyrics to this one; it's just a pure, sweet love song. I like the keyboard at the beginning. My biggest hangup with the Beach Boys is always the vocals, and this is no exception. That highest vocal part whine always gets on me, and it mars an otherwise lovely song.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): a sweet bop

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I don't think there is a 60s pop song that this more blatanly about sex. I like it.

**dropthehammer11** (8): A very pretty intro. Sets the tone of the album very well

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s a cute song.

---
# It wouldn’t be nice

**Saucymac** (7): this one is hard due to a Cadbury ad in Australia that changed the lyrics. Cant be unheard

**shineflyer** (6.5): tempo changes, compicated chordwork... it's a strange song to be a hit. and yet, still very Beach Boys.

**zamomattel** (4.5): I lowkey forgot this was on and then I realised and then it felt like a very long experience

This fucking bias by the Fleetwood stans I knew it. Imagine thinking Pet Sounds is a bad album, let alone giving God Only Knows anything less than like an 11. Maybe if the album got a 10 BNM from Pitchfork in 1966 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, a progressive pop album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

# God Bless

**deadspiderwall** (11): Such a beautiful love song

**strawberryswing1** (11): This is in my top 3 songs of all time and I hope you guys appreciate it

**agentofscranton** (10): just a genuinely beautiful song, up there with one of the greatest of all time, and in literally any other matchup it would get my 11 - but Rumours is just THAT album, but if anything from Rumours is to be pipped to number one then hopefully it's this one

**Arybeck67** (10): no reason needed here. IT IS SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL!

**ClocktowerMaria** (10): Uh, It's God Only Knows lol

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Absolutely gorgeous.

**kappyko** (10): this probably got a 0 bc popheads is awful

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Can a song be perfect? God only knows. But this song is the perfect blend of experimentation, an incredibly inventive chord progression, enigmatic yet beautiful lyrics, an achingly stirring melody.. It's filled with doubt, yet also a clear-eyed certainty that's quite life-affirming. There's no song quite like it, and I'm just thankful it exists

**mustangs16** (10): gorgeous. just gorgeous. "i may not always love you" is such a twist of an opening line, and it works perfectly.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is a wonderful song

**shineflyer** (10): this track is more complicated than it seems to be at first glance. Like, I'm not gonna talk deep music theory, but tldr; the chords are insane, and the melody does some really cool things. And yet, it's still a solid, catchy pop track that people love.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Undisputable classic, and definitely the best track here. The harmonized outro is just glorious.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of the most gorgeous, perfectly written, perfectly sung, beautiful love songs ever written. Every second of it is just perfect, but it's so achingly human, with endlessly interesting undertones of desperation and uncertainty. Pet Sounds at its core deals with issues of self reflection, uncertainty, displacement, and love, and all of these themes can be seen in this song. Carl Wilson's voice sounds made for the song as well, capturing the feel of the lyrics with a youthful innocence and charm. The harmonies are wonderful and Brian's arrangements just bring it all home. One of their very best songs and one of the best of all time.

**Verdantshade** (10): apart from the bbc music cover (featuring one direction <3), i love the song for the iconic moment in skins when tony sings it

**ExtraEater** (9.5): an orchestra of stars

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): A classic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song is way shorter than I thought, but it’s nice nonetheless.

**MissyBee37** (9): This might be my favorite Beach Boys vocal. The harmonies are really pretty here, especially when they start singing it as a round. Strong lyrics, too. That main/title line says so much, too. It's a powerful lyric.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): you wouldn't expect a declaration of love to start with "I may not always love you" but this one does and it's still great so good job

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): I mean, this is a classic for a reason. Great song.

**LuckyKidA** (8.5): The nostalgia from this song is fucking intense.

# Satanists

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I hope this won't win, but I'm not stupid enough to sabotage it, because this is actually a great song. Still, here's a scorching hot take: it's barely in the top third of this rate. Catch me giving this a lower score next All Stars, if this doesn't win.

**zamomattel** (7.5): prefer the version with queen Florence but this is fine

**Overall average**: 7.679

Absolutely the most controversial album of the 3, and understandably so. Pet Sounds is the most experimental effort by The Beach Boys, a band known for their simple, sunny California surfin’ vibes. This time, Brian Wilson chose to document and reflect on the many emotions that come with insecurity, sadness, love and heartbreak. It’s a truly touching album, and one that has great personal significance in my life after a very personal loss. “God Only Knows” is simply one of, if not the greatest song ever recorded. The album’s deep cuts are such strong examples of innovative pop production, employing alternative instrumentation and even combining it with more standard instruments. I will always cherish this album and I hope those who loved it continue to as well. 

---
**ExtraEater**: good but not their best

**mustangs16**: this album's an interesting one. it contains two of the best songs ever recorded in wouldn't it be nice and god only knows. it also contains some songs that kind of leave you scratching your head, particularly if you're only really familiar with their more iconic ~california surfer~ vibes. it's obvious why it wasn't warmly received at first, but it's also obvious why it's become known as one of the most influential albums of all time.

**Mudkip1**: this one's alright, i'm not a big fan of his voice. seems almost way too similar to Abbey Road and i was gonna complain about that but then i realized Pet Sounds came out before Abbey Road lol. imo Abbey Road improved upon everything that was attempted at in this album.

**shineflyer**: To be totally honest, I don't get the hype. idk, like, is there something I'm missing?

**Verdantshade**: the first time i heard this album was working in a charity shop selling old records - we played records on the record player over the stereo system and it was always super chill

**minibjork**: i cant believe brian wilson invented love and feelings of alienation

**DraculaWeekend**: I listened to this album a long time ago after hearing how it's one of the best albums of all time. I wasn't all that impressed but listening to it again, I realize that something about this album is just really great. I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites, but I can't really think of anything wrong with it.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I made a lot of people mad when I expressed my...displeasure upon listening to Pet Sounds on the Discord, and while my opinion of it's gradually improved after two or three more listens, I still feel as if its the weakest album in this rate. As somebody whose only exposure to 60s music was the Beatles's discography prior to listening to this album, the sudden stepdown from George Martin's production to this made me upset and the relatively simplistic lyrics in comparison with Abbey Road and even Rumours did too. Overall, I don't think it's in the Top 10 or even Top 50 albums of all time, but maybe I'd be okay with a Top 100 placing. Or maybe not. It's overrated, but not to the point where I completely dislike it; I have to give it credit for inspiring Sgt Pepper's, though I have no idea how the fuck that happened.

**MissyBee37**: Much to my husband's disappointment, I am not a Beach Boys fan. I get that they're classics and rather beloved but... they are not my cup of tea. The nasaly, whiny tone of some of their vocals and particularly the highest part in the harmony just grates on me. I'm not surprised some of this album was allegedly written on acid because man is it trippy, which is not for me. I also feel like the vocal and melodies tend to be monotonous. But sometimes they pull off a profound and pretty sound, with songs like "Wouldn't It Be Nice" and "God Only Knows." Those two are easily my favorites.

**strawberryswing1**: I wanted to love this since the Beach Boys have some of my favorite songs, but sadly they seem to be a singles band :( My avg is still surprisingly high though, honestly this album feels like a 6 with a couple 11s thrown in there. I didn't give scores below 5 because those are for songs I actively dislike, but these songs were just...there.

**cryptopian**: I think I could like this album a whole lot more if I could get past Brian Wilson's voice, but still the composition is full of great experimental bits and well crafted moods

**kappyko**: dennis isn't even fucking feeding anything on the album art lmao

**LazyDayLullaby**: You can't deny this album's influence, particularly after the fascinating 'reappraisal' of their post-surf pop work. Pet Sounds served as a major inspiration for their peers, and a basic blueprint for any and all orchestral and psychedelic pop albums to come (basically all of Elephant 6). I love that Brian Wilson heard Rubber Soul and wanted to surpass it with Pet Sounds, and then McCartney tried to match Pet Sounds with Sgt. Pepper.. Such an incredible sequence; friendly competition leading to some true masterpieces. And then Strawberry Fields broke Brian's brain

An absolute classic. Recognise this legendary song and weep, for mere mortals cannot grasp the perfection that is Stevie Nicks. Poor Dreams. It never got to reach #1 and by the time it overtook God Only Knows, it was too far behind #1 to catch up. Still, 3 legendary songs for a legendary top 3.

---
# Sweet Dream

**agentofscranton** (11): there isn't really any other acceptable score to give this song in my opinion - stevie sounds amazing in this, the instrumental is gorgeous, it's just one of the greatest songs of all time and i won't have a bad word thrown against it

**ExtraEater** (11): the perfect storm on the sunniest day. just, the best <3

**kappyko** (11): dreams means so much to me honestly. in 8th grade I went on a d.c. field trip that changed my life forever. for the first time I was completely on my own from my parents with people from school and i was free to do what i want in a state i had never been in. the first time i had ever seen snow, the first time i had ever told anybody about my own secrets, some of the most amazing friendships I've ever built, some of the most fantastic moments in my life preceded by one long gorgeous bus ride. the bus was playing the batman trilogy that my nerdy friend brought and the sound was so lodu that i had to drown it out even louder with the sound of "dreams" which i had downloaded on a youtube downloading app, and i kept this song on repeat. throughout the night, throughout my friends slowly falling asleep, throughout sharing a blanket with who eventually became my best friend, throughout the brief gas station break that felt almost psychedelic, throughout my glimpse of the first snow i had ever seen in my life in the most gorgeous shade of blue this song's ethereal gorgeous groove worked its way into my soul and repeated. stevie nicks' vocals are downright therapeutic. this song is magic and it hurts to think of anything winning but this

**Mudkip1** (11): thunder only happens when it's raining

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): What can I even say about this song? Well actually a lot, this is gonna be a long one so you can go ahead and skip. This piece of music means so much to me, It’s my favorite song of all time. I discovered it a few years ago and I’d never heard anything like it, it enchanted me like nothing else I’d heard and I can positively say it is one of the reasons I started discovering music on my own instead of just the radio and what was popular (which years later brought me here). Dreams got me into Fleetwood Mac and made fall in love forever with the witch goddess that is Stevie Nicks, who is also my favorite songwriter. Her knack for beautiful images is on full display here which coupled with her gorgeous voice literally brings me to tears. The instrumentation is breathtaking and fits the song so well, and impressively has not aged a day. There are few songs I consider absolutely perfect in every way, and Dreams is one of them and will always hold a special place in my heart so I can’t really give my 11 to anything else.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): The easiest 11 I have ever given or will ever give. Dreams is what I consider to be the peak of rock music - obviously, that’s a heavily biased opinion, but it’s rooted in the quality of this track. Everything about this track is perfection. From the carefully curated drumbeat of the intro to that same crash being utilized to usher in the chorus (which masterfully comes in right at the beginning of “thun crash der only happens when it’s raining”), it feels as uncertain and unstable as the band was at the time of recording. And the lyrics, my god the lyrics. Please read them if you haven’t before. “Like a heartbeat drives you mad/in the stillness of remembering what you had/and what you had and what you lost and what you had and what you lost.” Just absolutely spectacular. Everything about this song is perfect.

**zamomattel** (11): this slow build up, like what a bop. I feel like this song is so good that like even if it were released today it would become a hit

**Arybeck67** (10): Stevie is a literal master of writing songs about heartbreak (see Sliver Springs) While "thunder only happens when its raining" isn't scientifically correct, it is one of the best metaphors for heartbreak I have ever heard and captures the feeling in so little words perfectly

**CopyCatJ** (10): would have got my eleven if it had a Quavo feature

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Stevie's vocals here are out of this world.

**Franklytheturtle** (10): First couple times i listened to this album this song never clicked as one of the best and then suddenly it just did and now it's one of my favorite songs ever

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Such a gorgeous and sleek song. Stevie Nicks vocals are so soothing and chill and I love the sudden intensity in the chorus compared to the verses, but it’s still super dreamy and soothing sounding at the same time. Also as a former percussionist in band I really love the cymbal crash after they say thunder.

**LuckyKidA** (10): I imagine Stevie Nicks is floating on a cloud.

**mustangs16** (10): i don't know what to say about this song. it's moody and kind of dreamy and kind of bitter all at once? the melody definitely invokes the rain metaphors that appear throughout the lyrics, too. (also, obligatory "stevie nicks only wrote this song in ten damn minutes" comment)

**shineflyer** (10): Music Theory Fact of The Day; this song's in A minor, but never actually plays an A minor chord, just F and G, back and forth. It creates tension, which never resolves, and helps to create that dream-like state. ...Anyway, this song's really good.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Fleetwood Mac has a lot of songs that could be called beautiful. Out of all of those, I think Dreams is the one that best fits that description. Almost definitely one of their easiest songs to listen to, and I don't think I've ever met anyone who hates it.

**strawberryswing1** (10): This is gonna win and even though God Only Knows is my personal fave this song is so good I don't even mind!

**Verdantshade** (10): thank you so much for inspiring one direction's goat song what a feeling. while much of abbey road is music for sunny days, dreams is amazing to listen to on rainy days

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): yeah it's pretty iconic

**dropthehammer11** (9): Great song, Stevie Nicks' voice is so pretty

**minibjork** (9): i cant believe stevie nicks is an actually Goddess omg....

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.2): Excellent song. Thoughtful and cautiously optimistic

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Love that instantly recognizable choral melody.

**MissyBee37** (7.5): These lyrics are strong, painting a clear image of the painful downside of walking away from any relationship, even if you want it to end. Pretty melody.

# Beautiful Nightmare

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Sorry, popheads, but I find this slightly overrated. Stevie Nicks is lovely here, but I don't find the melody of this song exciting, even for 70s soft rock standards. Gorgeous, but it just lacks something.

**ClocktowerMaria** (5): Oh dear, I'm never gonna hear the end of this am I, sorry y'all :(

This was only ever a battle between this and God Only Knows. Once The Chain took over #1, it was ALL OVER. Dreams never had a chance, this song was just too far ahead. It’s talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

r/popheads, I give you your highest-rated song ever: The Chain!

---
# NEVER BREAK THE CHAIN

**cryptopian** (11): I love this song so much, though admittedly might be partially that the BBC has conditioned me to expect it to be followed by Formula 1.

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Everything about this song is perfection. The guitar solo, that "Oooooo" during the chorus, the chanting of "Chaaaaiiiin keep us together," just all of it. One of my favorite songs of all time.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Iconic song. Gotg 2 renewed my love for this song.

**minibjork** (11): when stevie and lindsey finally duel to the death this song will play in the background

**shineflyer** (11): This was basically always going to be my eleven. It's among my favorite songs of all time. It's passionate, tense, and has fantastic harmony and counterpoint in the vocal parts. And the ending, right after a dramatic bassline begins, just ramps the song up into this frenzy of sound. And did I mention the harmony? I did, but it's so good. All three vocalists have such distinct voices that sound amazing against each other.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): GOAT bass solo

**ExtraEater** (10): the biggest banger of all time, recorded secretly in a bomb shelter in the 70's, was too much for humanity to handle. it was toned down a bit so it wasn't too overwhelming, and thus the masterpiece that is 'The Chain' was made.

**hypertonality** (10): the atmosphere on this one is incredible, it's like a Japanese folk song meets country harmonies

**mustangs16** (10): this song just kicks ass, basically. there's a lot of anger and emotion behind it that just keeps building and building and doesn't let up at any point in the song. in my opinion, this is definitely fleetwood mac's best song.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This is without a doubt one of the greatest songs of all time, a perfect representation of what Fleetwood Mac is as a band. As much as they fight they’ll always be drawn to each other because what they make together is magic. The end of the song is so iconic nothings will ever top it. This would be my 11 if Dreams didn’t have so much sentimental value to me. But imo this is another example of a song that is utter perfection.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Upon the first time I listened to this album, this was the obvious standout. Instead of being soft rock like the other songs, it sounds badass and foreboding, eventually culminating in an epic guitar solo that comes out of nowhere, which is sure to have influenced Prince.

**poppinmmolly** (10): Harry Styles did a really nice BBC live lounge of this song, but nothing beats the original! What a bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Oh my god, this is a track just brimming with buildup. Everything about the fierce verses leads up to that glorious and defiant second chorus, and the guitar solo and outro that follow are nothing short of iconic.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): legendary, iconic, showstopping, never been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, shit on it, vomit on it, throw it in a blender, give birth to it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): great song and i love that guitar culmination at the end

**Verdantshade** (10): after seeing harry styles cover this i have a new appreciation for the song bc it was really lit

**Arybeck67** (9.7): the song everyone wrote together, it is a singular instance of unity on the album and I love it.

**zamomattel** (9.5): obviously this is amazing and whatever. I have one critique. The amazing riff which I acknowledge as amazing seems kind of weirdly placed

**MissyBee37** (9): Classic. The guitar is so strong, the lyrics are strong and poetic, strong vocals. I love the way the melodies loop over and echo each other. The best part of the lyrics is the various uses and possible meanings for the chain metaphor. This is one case where I love the fade-out ending.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Something something Guardians 2 reference

**ClocktowerMaria** (8): Classic

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): The songwriters all came together for this one, and it really worked. It puts the shattered relationships on full display, to fantastic effect. Cool solo, too

**LuckyKidA** (7.8): I'm probably underrating this because it was used in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and has too much attention.

deleted: # Rumours

---

**Overall average**: 8.333

---
Far and away Fleetwood Mac’s greatest record, Rumours is lightning in a bottle. Nearly none of these songs would have been written without the fire and fury behind them. It just goes to show that great pain can be turned into great art. With standout after standout, it’s little wonder r/popheads took such a liking to this album. Rumours is the quintessential “white girl in her first year of college” item, along with a record player and tye-die shirts. Its cultural impact cannot be understated, as it continues to influence some of our great young pop acts today.

**ExtraEater**: top 1 things ever

**mustangs16**: my parents weren't really fleetwood mac fans when i was growing up, so i had to discover the majority of this album on my own once i was an adult. which is kind of a shame, because it's so good -- and album i would have loved to have been aware of as an angsty teenager. basically the album for demonstrating that loads of personal turmoil can actually be good for your art.

**Mudkip1**: phenomenal the whole way through

**shineflyer**: One of those album's without a bad track on it. I don't like giving too many high scores, but this album didn't really give much of a choice.

**Verdantshade**: apart from the singles and songbird, i hadn't heard any of the songs on the album before

**minibjork**: my favorite momcore record

**DraculaWeekend**: I don't know how this album was made considering all of the behind-the-scenes drama, but I am grateful we have it.

**agentofscranton**: one of the greatest pop albums of all time featuring some of the greatest songs of all time

**patronsaintofaspies**: Didn't click with me as immediately as Abbey Road, but once I got past my slight bias towards 70s music I was able to see why this is one of the best selling albums of all time. I'd get rid of a few songs, that's for sure, but at its best Rumours is a beautiful mix of frustration, cynicism, hope and vulnerability.

**strawberryswing1**: I was scared that this wouldn't live up to all the hype, but wow it did. Marry me Stevie.

**lunasaflowers**: Probably my favourite of the albums here-- it grows on me more every time I listen to it. Wish there was more Stevie Nicks on lead vocals though!

**LazyDayLullaby**: I love albums with multiple songwriters (especially albums where each of the songwriters is at the top of their games). The circumstances surrounding Rumours elevate it from a great collection of songs to a singular achievement, making something special from an incubator of anger and pain, bitter nostalgia and winged hope. Oh and cocaine

Albert_Cole: Seriously:

* Controversy score under 1

* Over a fifth of the rate's 11s

* The lowest score is 7, higher than some songs get on average

* Only 15 people gave it less than 10

This may legit never be beaten
