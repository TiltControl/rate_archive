**bbfan132** (10): I’m honestly surprised to see this leave first. In my opinion, it’s a beautiful closer to this album, and kind of hints at what her music will sound like in the future. Her delivery sounds passionate and the instrumental works gorgeously with Björk’s singing. Her live performances of this song over the past few years have been stunning as well.


**Saison_Marguerite** (8.5): Sure, it’s no Run Away With Me but her sax moment didn’t deserve this slader


---


**bulforster** (11): Beautiful closer. I feel like lyrically Björk's fascination with place is pretty unique and I love how poetic yet raw her description of her connection to her home is here.


**fadedblue09** (10): This song makes me feel like I'm riding a ship on the sea in some fantasy film.


**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I can relate to this :)


**runaway3212** (10): I love drowning and dying my two favourite pasttime activities


**waluigiest** (10): as a sax player the little accompaniment is so tasty. Especially the concluding Bari sax blast….. wow


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I've always weirdly liked this song. Woozy saxophones, a small sea shanty era for Bjork? Love how strange and beguiling it is. Tori is maybe a mermaid, Bjork lives by the ocean, so great.


**cherryices** (9.1): forget sea shanties! stream the anchor song


**iniekcja_** (9): H2O: Just Add Water


**xxipilots** (9): I love how this song makes me have a vivid image of a character in my head; someone who is determined to stay.


**jman457** (8.3): a nice quiet ending to the album, though not sure what the overarching theme to it is


**seanderlust** (8.2): I don't know if this will make sense but I feel like this would fit very well into a quirky kids movie. think kubo or ponyo or something like that


**Brendon-Urine** (8): that sax choir can get it


**CrimsonROSET** (8): sad sea shanty noises


**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Jazz


**throwaway7650** (8): cute song and lyrics, it gives off movie ending credit vibes (it kind of sounds like one big "womp womp" that runs for 3:32 tbh)


**1998tweety** (7.5): the brass on this is nice


**vayyiqra** (7): This song doesn't really go anywhere I admit, but the album wouldn't feel right without it. It is kind of catchy, odd as it is. It took a long time to grow on me so I don't think it will do well though.


**jry3** (6.5): Another song that doesn't belong, but I enjoyed it.


**stryxen** (6.5): it’s not a weak song but i just don’t enjoy it as much as the rest and i never listen to it outside of the album


**ignitethephoenix** (6): not this being my favorite vocal work and maybe even lyrics from Bjork on this album but the music sounds like it’s made up of grade 8 band students … I’m so mad


**jackisboredtoday** (6): this does anchor the album, in that it drags it down a little


**KennyEarthman** (6): saxy


**cremeebrulee** (5.8): is this a sea shanty


**Uberpigeon** (4): dropping her anchor more like dropping her average


**daretheghost** (0): I don’t like anything about this… the saxophones feel strangely cacophonous and Björk’s voice over them just enhances it. Not for me.


**Doppleflooner** (0): It's Aeroplane but even worse! Such a terrible album closer, and I'm so glad the amazing Play Dead was added.


**veryanniev** (0): I had to give something a zero and unfortunately this song just doesn’t do anything for me.

**bbfan132** (7): I love Björk’s vocals here, but this definitely feels more like an interlude than a full-on track. Because of that, I’m not really surprised to see this leave the bonus rate first. 


**Saison_Marguerite** (7.5): This is cute, I love to hear her singing in Icelandic. Lizzo flute remix when??


---


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): In the right hands, the recorder is a beautiful instrument (apparently)


**throwaway7650** (9): bonus point for the recorder. outsold the 3rd graders


**skargardin** (8): this warmed my recorder-loving heart


**minibjork** (7.5): aww reminds me of the music she made when she was child


**WhyDoIExist** (7.5): OMG Legend Of Zelda QUEEN


**jman457** (7.2): My sim busting their ass off in Sims 3 showtime


**Brendon-Urine** (7): she was in a silly goofy mood making this


**daretheghost** (7): I wasn’t sure about the recorders(?) at first but the middle bit was cute.


**frogaranaman** (7): the ocean


**J_Toe** (7): veri medieval


**TiltControls** (7): me when i'm the ocean between the Americas and Europe/Africa


**vayyiqra** (7): Huh? How do I have almost 2000 plays of her music and not know this? Wait, I remember it. It's odd. It sounds like music from Ocarina of Time. Much as I stan Debut, I have to admit this song can go without missing a whole lot. It is cute though and I always like when she sings in Icelandic.


**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): i saw a youtube comment that said this sounds like a song from The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks and i can't unhear that


**nootnoot781** (6): why are all the YT comments giving their favourite björk songs? anyway my top 3 is 1. björk attacks a reporter, 2. björk talking about her TV, 3. it’s oh so quiet


**Doppleflooner** (5): The opening and ending hurts it, but its great once it becomes a video game song for awhile.


**stryxen** (5): runescape soundtrack serve

**bbfan132** (8.5): I love the jazz influence here. The instrumental is gorgeous and I think Björk sounds great here. It does sound a bit out of place on the album, but I still think that it works quite well. I’m not too surprised to see it leave now, but a song this good getting cut 2nd shows how strong this rate is.

---


**CrimsonROSET** (9): that woman? Amelia Earhart.


**runaway3212** (9): love this so much


**survivorjdmarina** (9): i LOOOVE the saxophone omg


**vayyiqra** (9): I think of this song as part of the same song as "One Day" because that song mentions "an aeroplane" and they are back to back. They're also both loosely about longing or something. idk it makes sense in my head


**waluigiest** (9): her voice, the saxophone, the drums…. Wow this is excellent


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): Weird jazz parts. I like it, love the warped bossa nova sound.


**stryxen** (8.5): the way she spits out the word touch makes me feel something


**jman457** (8.4): Big fan of the more organic/natural production on here


**minibjork** (8): imagining björk singing this in some jazz club but with like a jungle-themed backdrop on stage


**throwaway7650** (8): if one day takes place in space, aeroplane takes place in some undiscovered climate - I'm thinking like a desert/jungle/swamp hybrid thing? where there are thwomps and multiple undiscovered species of birds. idk, maybe someone can mod that in minecraft. anyway björk can take an aeroplane around the world to follow her heart but I'm taking one to discover that climate I mentioned earlier. oh, the song's also nice and mysterious, too (though at times, it randomly reminds of winnie the pooh for some reason)


**daretheghost** (7): This is nice! I like the jazzy bossa nova vibe.


**LazyDayLullaby** (7): In the Aeroplane Over the Norwegian Sea


**WhyDoIExist** (7): Like the jazz elements and the wild sounds in the background/ influences


**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): can we pretend that aeroplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?


**1998tweety** (6): this is mid too


**bulforster** (5.9): some interesting ideas but overall kind of a hodgepodgey mess


**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): if animal crossing had a jazz cafe that was in a jungle this would be the music


**celladonn** (4): I kind of don't like this much. Not a fan of her vocals here and there's not enough going on musically or lyrically to make up for it


**KennyEarthman** (4): forgettable


**Doppleflooner** (2): Unpleasant to listen to, and not in an interesting way like she can manage to pull off usually.

**bbfan132** (8): Björk’s folksier/softer sound is underrated, in my opinion. This cover is beautiful, and her delivery works perfectly here. I get why this didn’t do as well, especially when compared to the dance tracks on the record, but it’s still a very strong track. 

---


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I think this is such a touching and vulnerable song. And the lyrics! "Sometimes the things I do astound me". So gorgeous.


**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is how you do a stripped down track right, the instrumetation is gorgeous, and it's got such this serene, peaceful, idyllic aura to it, it perfectly encapsulates the overwhelming and enraputing draw of pure love to me.


**seanderlust** (10): like floating in a pool on a mild summer day and thinking of someone special


**waluigiest** (10): I actually think this song fits perfectly into the album (although this track order is messy). She sings a lot on debut about a naive, overwhelming kind of love. This is the perfect standard to cover in that regard, and the harp honestly works to blend into the ethereal but approachable orchestration of the album, even if most other songs are very electronic. The cherry on top is listening to this with nice headphones and just being washed over with background sounds of the city. Beautiful, beautiful song.


**xxipilots** (10): Giving me sufjan steven vibes. Very adolescent and magical.


**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I was like “wow this sounds like something from an old school musical!” and then I looked it up and it turns out it is legitimately a standard from the ‘40s so I guess in a way I was right. I love her take on it, I’m often bored when pop singers do straightforward covers of classics because I’ve pretty much always heard them sung better (looking at you Lady Gaga) but a fresh arrangement can do wonders.


**KennyEarthman** (9): made me go to sleep (affectionate)


**skargardin** (9): this harp is heavenly omg


**throwaway7650** (9): I love the harp... this song sounds like something that would be played exclusively for the royal family's young children


**vayyiqra** (9): Björk with harp is never not good. Side note I didn't know this was a cover for the longest time, because she rarely does those.


**stryxen** (8.5): pleading face wish i could relate


**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): she was in her Joanna bag omg


**LazyDayLullaby** (8.1): Angelic, feels kinda like it should be playing over a romantic animated montage


**1998tweety** (8): lyrics on this are nice


**bulforster** (8): shout out to björk covering jazz standards, gotta be one of my favorite genders


**frogaranaman** (8): no clue what the fuck she’s saying but it’s pretty


**jman457** (8): It’s Oh So Quiet outsold but this is still really nice


**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is pretty


**akanewasright** (7.5): This is a neat little cover! Not that much to write home about, and not as wonderful as the “oh so quiet” cover, but still very good and memorable


**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): yes her vocals are good, but… I dunno, I think just the harp or whatever that is just doesn’t work as the solo backing instrument.


**iniekcja_** (7.5): this lacks what I would normally need from a Björk song


**minibjork** (7.5): a movie in my head. extras & all.


**runaway3212** (7.5): kinda corny kinda bop


**Doppleflooner** (7): Beautiful, but not gripping.


**plastichaxan** (7): this is very pretty but compared to the streak of 10s of the first few tracks and most of this rate it’s not really that great


**cremeebrulee** (5.9): i mean the harp is pretty but this kind of bores me


**celladonn** (5): It's cute but I'm asleep


**J_Toe** (4): placed at an odd position in the tracklist.


**pietrohonkhonk** (4): I’m sorry but this song just brings the album to a halt, why is it here


**Uberpigeon** (4): this is the annoying kind of harp


**daretheghost** (3): Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh… I wish this had more to it than voice + harp + ambient noise. I guess you have the brief strings, but they’re SO brief they’d might as well not even be there.


**jry3** (1): After a run of extremely strong tracks, I felt this one completely reversed the momentum, sounds very out of place, and I found the melody extremely annoying. I'll give a point to the harp(?).


**TragicKingdom1** (0): this is like the opposite of going off

**bbfan132** (8): I feel like I’m floating in space while listening to this. The production is pretty simple, but it’s quite evocative. Her delivery works very well with the production as well. It might not be a total standout, but I still think it’s a strong track (just like every other song on the record!)


**Saison_Marguerite** (9.5): I’m surprised to see this go so early, I think it’s absolutely beautiful as a huge stan of trip-hop.


---


**iniekcja_** (10): a staple on my "rare love song I actually enjoy" playlist


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Love the violins. IDORU !! Had this as a 9 but it started transporting me to a magical world around the 3rd listen


**throwaway7650** (10): this song is dramatic but not overly dramatic, it keeps me on edge in a good way. björk (and the lyrics) give off creepy witch vibes


**CrimsonROSET** (9): this kinda has Love Song energy, where putting something into writing makes it lose its effect, because love is supposed to be intimate, dammit.


**stryxen** (9): come to Me-hee-hee!


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.6): Great trip hop track, very sensual "I'll catch you..."


**minibjork** (8.5): 90's does 60's space age lounge music. cute ~


**WhyDoIExist** (8.5): We're back! The last two songs were a bit of a dropoff in terms of quality but this song is so hypnotic and great


**fadedblue09** (8): I like the subtle ominous feel here


**plastichaxan** (8): this feels very cinematic, epic in a cinematic way not in a straight way


**runaway3212** (8): We love a song that's gonna beat balladphobia and not go out day 1


**vayyiqra** (8): This song feels kind of like it has interlude energy, but not in a bad way? As in it wouldn't make sense outside the context of the album but it works well between these other tracks.


**waluigiest** (8): the beat really makes it a lower energy Aeroplane, which is fun


**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I appreciate how shamelessly romantic the lyrics of this one are, I bet Bjork would write great fan fiction. Musically not my favorite though, it’s a bit tuneless


**jman457** (7.4): cute little song


**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): the twinkly keys are nice but this song comes too close to bjork inventing the indie girl kitchen voice for me


**Doppleflooner** (6): It's fine. Sultry, but a little basic.


**skargardin** (6): I'm not saying that this is bad by any means but it doesn't grab me as the rest of the album, unfortunately


**1998tweety** (5): this feels like a whole lot of nothing


**daretheghost** (5): Sort of a middle-of-the-road song for me. It’s fine enough but doesn’t stand out much.


**KennyEarthman** (3): made me go to sleep (derogatory)

**bbfan132** (9): It’s honestly comical to listen to this and watch the video after listening to her 90s output… It’s totally different than her solo work, but it’s still a total bop! I love how stereotypically 80s it sounds - it’s just unabashedly an 80s synthpop song. Her vocals are awesome here too. The album that this is featured on also has some great songs like Cool on Your Island and Etienne (which she still covers today)!

---


**daretheghost** (10): Honestly? A bop. That motif of three big chunky descending piano chords in the bridge and final chorus do something to me. It’s always fun to imagine a parallel universe where this album blew up and Tori became a Main Pop Girl instead of the Little Earthquakes version of herself. For me, at least.


**qazz23** (10): I like the big '80s sound of this


**stryxen** (10): and why did popheads hide this bop from me for all this time


**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): An Interview With Camp


**TiltControls** (10): very different energy than the other Tori songs, but I LOVE THIS


**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this is a total bop


**Brendon-Urine** (9): kinda sad that they flopped, this deserved more


**iniekcja_** (9): this further cements my theory that a sensible amount of illiteracy makes people make bops


**skargardin** (9): now this is a bop


**jman457** (8.6): Its very 80’s but I really dig it


**akanewasright** (8): I kinda can’t believe this is real… and that it kinda works?


**celladonn** (8): This song's wikipedia page is sending me. "The song was a commercial failure and received absolutely no critical comment." Help


**J_Toe** (8): lol the 80s of it all


**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Great outro


**frogaranaman** (7): ohhh I get it, Tori is illiterate


**minibjork** (7): i've always heard about tori's 80s "glam" phase but i never listened until now. not that bad honestly.


**vayyiqra** (7): Every now and then I remember that this project existed and it's so surreal. I was assuming it'd be awful but I kind of like this?? It's cheesy but not any more than any other 80s hit.


**WhyDoIExist** (7): I think its good but a little generic


**Doppleflooner** (4): It's weird to hear Tori be so generic/mainstream! Not hard to see why that project flopped.


**jry3** (2.5): Embarrassing, can't believe it's the same person.


**NevenSuboticFanNo1** (1): this is by far the worst thing in this rate

**bbfan132** (7.5): Probably one of my least favorite songs of hers, but it’s still good. I kind of wish it went somewhere else after the verses, although the song is genuinely fine the way it is. I’m not surprised to see this be the first song out from Tidal, and I admittedly don’t think that it will be a song that a ton of people will remember in the future.

---


**RandomHypnotica** (10): the intrumental here is SO full and layered and beautiful and UGH so good

**bbfan132** (8): This actually sounds pretty ahead of its time to me - I could see some current artists releasing a song like this today. It is a little bit long, but it’s still quite relaxing to listen to. The production is awesome as per usual on this record, and I love Björk’s presence here. 

---


**Brendon-Urine** (10): her voice??? LORD ALMIGHTY


**vayyiqra** (10): I tell myself this all the time. It seems to help.


**minibjork** (9.5): i believe her


**throwaway7650** (9.5): this almost sounds like a song that would play during space levels in video games... one day it will happen. really like the lyrics to this


**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): The baby speaking and noises creeps me out a little, but i feel like that was intentional


**xxipilots** (9.2): Psychedelia and Melancholy wrapped up in one song.


**CrimsonROSET** (8): baby you’re a firework, come on let your colors burst but make it sexy?


**daretheghost** (8): I love the production on this one.


**nootnoot781** (8): dixie d’amelio outsold this flop with ease.


**runaway3212** (8): more like eight day


**skargardin** (8): still waiting, pensive


**survivorjdmarina** (8): the pulsing beat is glorious


**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): A good song but despite the length it feels like it just kinda comes and goes?


**jman457** (7.5): A good song to vibe too, the parts of the production that seem like a video kind of annoy me


**ImADudeDuh** (7): i was really really really really sad


**J_Toe** (7): the kind of 90s that isn't as cool as the other house tracks on the album


**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Not bad, but a bit more minor than some


**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): me finishing my scores for this song with 24 hours till the deadline… one day indeed


**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): For one day, one day, I was really really really really sad


**WhyDoIExist** (6.5): Groovy but not as fun as the other songs


**stryxen** (6): she drags on a bit but it’s fun for the most part


**Uberpigeon** (6): someone get their baby


**fadedblue09** (5): A bit bland lyrically, but “beautifullest” is iconic

**bbfan132** (9): This one grew on me over time. I’ll never forget being introduced to this song by reading a comment on RateYourMusic that said something like “this is a boring Mariah Carey-esque ballad” which…. Anyways, while it’s another long song that is brooding and slow, Fiona’s forlorn delivery works perfectly here. I also particularly love the piano throughout the song, especially towards the end. 

---


**Humanntrashcan** (10): I feel like I’m this ballad heavy album this song might get underrated especially since the last 4 songs are very slow and can feel same-y, but this song transports me. I really feel the somber autumn feeling while also feeling and understanding my own aging mind. Idk this song does something to me


**bulforster** (9.4): I don't think there's another Fiona song that is as uncomplicatedly beautiful as this.


**CrimsonROSET** (9): :(


**daretheghost** (9): Pure poetry.


**survivorjdmarina** (9): Placing a song with the word "September" as the ninth track… she’s so smart.


**throwaway7650** (9): parts of this song are quite lullaby-like? that description does fit the "as I'm singing him to sleep" line. the ending is so gorgeous


**LazyDayLullaby** (8.1): Tanned October


**iniekcja_** (8): the lyricism is spectacular but I was waiting for something more to happen I guess


**stryxen** (8): D:


**1998tweety** (7.5): this is alright


**fadedblue09** (7.5): I find this a little dreary but honestly this has grown on me a lot. This exudes winter vibes for some reason.

**bbfan132** (8): Fiona always has great covers, and this is no exception. I love her bluesier/jazzier side and this is a great display of that. It might not be the most remarkable cover ever, but it’s certainly pleasant to listen to! I’m happy to see that people were pretty receptive to it.

**bbfan132** (8.5): I love how lethargic this song is, it feels like you’re in a dream while listening to it. I have a soft spot for her jazzier side, and this song definitely hits that spot, although it’s not one of my favorites on the record. Her melodies throughout the song are beautiful, and the instrumental is lush and calming. 


---


**1998tweety** (10): like a criminal undercover


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Okay this song really surprised me. I much much much prefer vulnerable Fiona to spurned cynical Fiona. Loved this! My favorite from the album.


**ImADudeDuh** (10): as a former quiet kid, i relate to this too much


**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love the strong Jazz Bar vibes this gives off, but it's still got that raw, punchy edge that Fiona is a master at using


**runaway3212** (9): more like fly like a g6


**survivorjdmarina** (9): Vocals and lyrics were THERE


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): It’s a bit long but I’m enraptured by it, her vocals and the piano are just so smoky and it puts me in a different state of mind


**throwaway7650** (8.5): moody song, fiona reminds me of björk at times here


**akanewasright** (8.4): the last time I listened to this song, i accidentally played get into it (yuh) by doja cat right before it and this was not quite as hype


**CrimsonROSET** (8): she got the slow part right


**daretheghost** (8): Not a particular favorite of mine.


**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Slows the pace down quite a bit after Criminal, and has a melody and atmosphere that kind of reminds me of Nature Boy at times


**seanderlust** (8): very sultry lounge singer vibes here


**waluigiest** (8): I love her diction. This song is a dessert


**stryxen** (7.5): i underrated this at first but it’s not that great


**minibjork** (7): fiona's jazz influence really shines here


**vayyiqra** (7): This is quite "vibey" for lack of a better word. There's a strong jazz influence.


**bulforster** (6.8): I'm not opposed to slow songs in general but this one especially kinda kills the momentum of the album


**celladonn** (6): I was going to say I'd like this song more if it was a bit faster, but I looked up the speed of this song and apparently it is 141 bpm. That doesn't seem right but I don't know enough about music to dispute it


**Doppleflooner** (6): Pretty, but lacking spark.


**KennyEarthman** (6): slow like honey, heavy with mood


**NevenSuboticFanNo1** (6): this is too slow


**pietrohonkhonk** (6): This feels like a 3-4 minute song that was stretched out to almost 6 minutes


**Brendon-Urine** (5.5): Not one of my favorites, just a little bit slow (heh) for me.


**TiltControls** (5): i get it's slow like honey, but this just drags on a bit too long


**jman457** (4.7): maybe im long song-phobic but this song felt like a chore to sit through


**fadedblue09** (3): I feel bad I never really cared for this. It just goes nowhere and her vocals here are just...not great. My least favorite song in her discography tbh

**bbfan132** (8.5): I’ve gone back and forth on this song, but I think I like it quite a bit now. Sure, some of the metaphors are… not the best, but Tori’s delivery totally sells this song. Her vocals are otherworldly here, and the instrumental sounds beautiful as well. It’s probably the most adult contemporary-esque song of hers from the 90s, and when it’s as good as this, you can’t really go wrong with that

---


**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHhfTr35ajU


**Doppleflooner** (10): I'm trying really hard to not be biased toward this album, but this is just gorgeous.


**iniekcja_** (10): brought out the pink Lamborghini just to race with Chyna


**waluigiest** (10): im obsessed with the lyricism


**xxipilots** (10): Tragic story. Gives me Weyes Blood vibes. The vocals are strong, which evokes the emotion well.


**akanewasright** (9.2): I’m not crazy about some of the imagery for some reason but… it hits.


**1998tweety** (9): ended ph0ebe bridgers


**getin2it** (9): Something feels a little wrong about using the Great Wall of China as a metaphor and I can't put my finger on it. Nonetheless, what a gorgeously expansive song and so intimate. Some great Kate Bush-isms with the little "oh oh oh."


**throwaway7650** (9): disney: the re-up, this sounds like a mulan song [non-derogatory]


**vayyiqra** (9): This is beautiful!


**runaway3212** (8.5): Lovely, like the finest china


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): On the one hand I adore the lyrics and metaphor she's using. And how spacey this whole song sounds. And lush violins that add to the emotional intensity of this song. Love the lyrical concepts of distance and a relationship cooling off. The vocal "riffs"(??) she does around the bridge point I dislike so had to lower my score.


**ImADudeDuh** (8): wow I liked A.N.T. Farm too but not this much


**survivorjdmarina** (8): I can feel the distance


**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Do the East Asian Pop Royalty Rate!


**stryxen** (7.5): beautiful and breathtaking lyrics but not my favourite


**daretheghost** (7): A lot of Tori fans dislike this song and think it’s corny but between you and me, Popheads, I really love this song—it’s corniness is part of its charm, I think.


**KennyEarthman** (7): didn't expect the dinnerware type of china to come up, kinda clever ngl


**celladonn** (6): A teeny bit boring I'm afraid


**fadedblue09** (6): A bit meandering, also the metaphors are not as effective here


**frogaranaman** (6): China was nothing like this when I visited


**seanderlust** (6): this is my lowest score in the rate, and it's a 6 which means it's still decent. that really says something about this rate


**Uberpigeon** (6): this is kind of unmemorable but i like the AH AH AHHAHH


**jman457** (5): Not really feeling it, sounds like a song she would write for Billy Joel. Bridge doesn't even really save it. Lyrics and vocals are obviously good though


**LazyDayLullaby** (5): Bit boring


**jry3** (4): boring, again

**bbfan132** (10): I have to admit, it does hurt a bit to see people call this “boring,” but I felt the same way for a while. For a while, I didn’t even remember what this song sounded like. However, I was watching a short MTV special on Tori that aired in the late 90s, and when I heard the piano intro in the background, I was taken aback. I knew immediately that I had to listen to the song on its own, and when I did, I was floored. Quite possibly some of the most beautiful piano playing I’ve ever heard here, and her vocals/lyrics are stunning as per usual. It’s definitely long, but in my opinion, it doesn’t overstay its welcome at all. This was an 11 contender for me, and while I’m sad to see it leave on day 1, I’m happy that some people heard what I now hear.

---


**jry3** (11): one of the best songs I've ever heard. Super emotional, passionate, and epic song.


**minibjork** (11): probably boring by /r/popheads standards but extremely important to me #terrifiedofthefuturesadgirllife


**1998tweety** (10): once again I am ascending


**KennyEarthman** (10): was supposed to be a 5 but it grew on me so much


**skargardin** (10): the "mother, the car is here" line wrecked me oh wow


**stryxen** (10): long songs called Mother are just guaranteed 10s


**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): In a rate full of incredible piano, this track is PARTICULARLY gorgeous and haunting


**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): popheads you will LISTEN to this 7-minute song and you will LIKE it


**daretheghost** (9): This is a song I never fully connected with, despite having a somewhat complicated relationship with my own mother. But between Tori’s beautiful pianowork and delivery it’s one of the more viscerally honest songs on the album.


**iniekcja_** (9): the bridge!!


**plastichaxan** (9): i almost cried to this wow


**runaway3212** (9): Lyrically so strong


**survivorjdmarina** (9): Gorgeous all the way through.


**throwaway7650** (9): love the storytelling, the piano in the intro and outro is so good


**waluigiest** (9): the redhead lines are so satisfying for some reason


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): Love the feminist lyrics of this song! A very creative idea to have a dynamic between mother and daughter. Probably my favorite more straightforward piano ballad from Tori. Still great use of dynamics (loud to quiet and loud again) that


**WhyDoIExist** (8.5): Its so emotionally packed the feels are real :(


**fadedblue09** (8): Melodically captivating, and the lyrics make me weirdly emotional for a reason


**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): see this is really good, but it kinda drags? It does not need to be 7 minutes long, for sure.


**jman457** (7.4): Not my favorite but it has such vivid storytelling


**vayyiqra** (7): This is very pretty but I feel like I'm too tired to interpret the lyrics properly, which are too deep for me right now lol.


**celladonn** (6.5): Great lyrics, but the sound here doesn't fully engage me


**95ztaehyung** (6): call me a silly little gen z but sometimes songs are too long


**Doppleflooner** (6): Tori loses me here a bit on this one. Just a bit unfocused for me.


**Ghost-Quartet** (6): My mother abused me but this is pretty, it doesn’t need to be this long though. It feels like it’s six minutes because she enjoys performing it so she wants that experience to last as long as possible, which is great for her but not as fun for the listener.


**LazyDayLullaby** (6): I like the lyrics more than the song


**Uberpigeon** (4): boring

**bbfan132** (9.5): I normally am not the biggest fan of slowed-down covers of upbeat songs, but I have to say that Tori did a wonderful job here. I almost feel like she was the one who started this trend in the first place… Because of that, her covers often feel more authentic and passionate. While the original song is an undeniable classic, this version is a haunting interpretation of the song that evokes completely different imagery. Lyrics that seemed unimportant in the Nirvana version sound extremely impactful here. 


---


**akanewasright** (10): this is superlative


**daretheghost** (10): I think it’s so funny how all these years later we still don’t have a clear idea of whether or not Kurt actually liked this cover. And considering Courtney and Tori have something of a mutual contempt I don’t know that we ever will.


**Doppleflooner** (10): Extremely haunting and interesting interpretation. Tori's covers are something special.


**Hulnia** (10): Outside of the original, I don’t think there’s a better version of this song.


**vayyiqra** (10): Remember when we rated the original last year and Popheads didn't like it? Sad! Let's hope this does a bit better. Tori has a lot of good covers and in fact I first heard of her through them, such as her unironically great cover of "Raining Blood".


**WhyDoIExist** (9.5): This is basically on par with the original and she put her own twist on it... love that for her


**celladonn** (9): Honestly love her delivery of this


**iniekcja_** (8.5): this song has been so overdone over the years but this somehow feels fresh


**Brendon-Urine** (8): this is actually super nice. now I know what the lyrics are!


**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Piano goes well with this


**seanderlust** (7.1): honestly i like this a bit more than the original, though it's very hard to compare


**approximatelymagic** (7): I used to love this but I can't listen to it any more.


**minibjork** (7): usually very anti-ballad versions of fast-paced songs but for tori i'll make an exception <333. still very gritty like the original


**plastichaxan** (6.8): not a big fan of this sorry


**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): it's a different take on this song yes, and while it's pretty, the grungey vibe of the original is really what makes it work imo


**jman457** (6): doesn't do much for me


**frogaranaman** (5): sorry queen you sound great but I am personally very mentally impacted by the Youtube cover community doing the whole ‘slow songs down and turn them into a piano ballad to make them deeper’ thing and I cannot really deal with covers like this very well


**TiltControls** (5): I'm not sure this works


**J_Toe** (4): i don't like this and i'm serry

**bbfan132** (8): Maybe not a standout track on Little Earthquakes, but it surely is fun as hell. I’ve heard that she plays this quite often since it’s easy for her to remember, but I certainly wouldn’t take a bathroom break while she plays this. The lyrics are hilarious and Tori’s delivery is perfect here. I also love the cabaret/jazz influence here - she should definitely work with that sound more often!

---


**plastichaxan** (10): a win for the leather community


**jman457** (9.5): Tori conveys sexuality so well in this track. Rihanna is shook


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.2): I LOVE the guitar in the background and the jaunty piano here works for me.


**CrimsonROSET** (9): see at the same time this is a song about running away when you don’t find yourself being valued in a relationship, this can also be a really good stripshow number so i’m conflicted.


**ImADudeDuh** (9): parts of this reminds me of Babooshka by Kate Bush


**waluigiest** (9): this started kink at pride discourse


**1998tweety** (8.5): love the piano (and then the guitar) on this


**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Did anyone else notice that the “About” section on Genius.com for this song is Tori talking about how people pole dance to this song?


**minibjork** (8.5): ugh i love her


**seanderlust** (8.5): tori has talked about being approached by pole dancing instructors who use this song and I would like to know where these classes are because I will sign up immediately


**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Tori including a jazz-influenced song about sex on here? Her mind.


**throwaway7650** (8.5): oh the jazz influence is very cool, the piano really shines here


**akanewasright** (8): I wanna do a striptease to this. Edit: after googling the song, this is not an original thought


**Doppleflooner** (8): A little flimsy as a composition that knocks it down for me, but still fun.


**frogaranaman** (8): daddy bear rights!


**getin2it** (8): I love the attack in the lines "If you're gonna jump, you better jump far."


**runaway3212** (7.5): Me when leather


**vayyiqra** (7): "While on her Dew Drop Inn Tour in 1996, Amos shared the story that inspired the song which, she explained, is not about "wild sex." She was living in a run-down apartment in Hollywood when a so-called friend stopped by to borrow sugar. When the singer played her an offering from Little Earthquakes, the woman told her it wasn't catchy and she should consider changing her writing style. **After she left, Tori wrote "Leather" in eight minutes.**" lmao


**Uberpigeon** (6.5): pull the leather krunk


**daretheghost** (6): This song is something of a meme among Tori fans: it shows up with great regularity in tour setlists because Tori can play it by muscle memory these days and it usually shows up when she needs to balance out some heavier songs. No one will think poorly of you if you use it as a bathroom break. The song is fine. I’ll never not be charmed by Tori’s delivery of “he had a nice, big, fat cigar.”


**stryxen** (6): i love the jazzy influence but the lyrics are my least favourite on the album


**KennyEarthman** (5): love the way she says cigar. shigur
