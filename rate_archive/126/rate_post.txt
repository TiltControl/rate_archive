#[Tori Amos - Little Earthquakes](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DYzAJCRjL._SL1425_.jpg)

A piano prodigy fed up with the rigid norms of classical music culture, and coming off a stint as the lead singer of a flop 80s rock band, Tori Amos in 1992 was full of fire to do something different. That is to say, she came on Little Earthquakes mad as hell. She approached playing the piano like a rockstar, creating songs that mixed unapologetically raw and esoteric lyrics with the confrontational energy of 90s alternative, indebted as deeply to Led Zeppelin as to Kate Bush. Tori’s experience growing up in the church gave her a candid perspective on breaking free from societal shame and owning her power as a woman. The most personal and harrowing song from the album, Me and a Gun, does not hold back about her experience with sexual assault. Tori has given strength to survivors in more ways that just her music, as a co-founder of RAINN.

People were immediately receptive to the album, and it immediately established Amos as an alternative singer to look out for. She pioneered the regrowth of music involving just an artist and a piano, while also remaining sonically diverse and adventurous. To this day, critics are still praising the record for its unique confessional sound and perspective - as a matter of fact, the praise has only grown over time. Critic J.C. Maçek III stated that "with its lack of standard rock and pop clichés of the day and reliance on acoustic piano and an excellent (if unconventional) voice, Little Earthquakes sounds as unique today as it did in 1992." Writer Jenny Bulley said that this was a "remarkable, idiosyncratic" debut record that revealed "a singular creative force from the outset." While Amos released many albums after this one, Little Earthquakes stands out as a distinct highlight in her discography.

#[Björk - Debut](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E4Ci9R61L._SL1050_.jpg)

Björk Guðmundsdóttir, known simply as Björk, is a wonderfully eccentric artist from Iceland. She has been making music since age 11, and was originally a part of the alt-rock band The Sugarcubes as their lead singer. While she became even more renowned for her unique works of arts within the next few decades, she started off with a powerhouse of a debut album in *Debut*. Released in 1993, she co-produced the album with trip hop innovator Nellee Hooper, who is known for his work with Madonna and Massive Attack, among many other successful artists. This album veers away from the rock and post-punk influenced sound of her band's material, moving into a blend of dance pop, house, trip hop, and art pop. The album is full of playful songs that could be played at parties while standing out on their own as strong compositions. The album was quite successful in Europe, landing at #2 in Iceland and #3 in the UK. 

Both critics and listeners immediately loved her innovative sound, praising her for changing the landscape of electronic and pop music. She has been credited for introducing house and artier elements to pop music with this release, and her influence has only increased over the years. Today, critics are still singing the praises of this record, with writers like Heather Phares stating that it "still sounds fresh, which is even more impressive considering electronic music's whiplash-speed innovations." 

1. Human Behaviour
2. Crying
3. Venus as a Boy

#[Fiona Apple - Tidal](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uOpZiL5zL._SS500_.jpg)

Fiona Apple was exposed to the entertainment industry from a young age with both her parents being performers, but she wasn’t thrust into the spotlight until her demo tape made its way to Sony through a friend. Her stunningly deep, smokey voice and cutting poetic lyrics floored the execs there right away. Once they allowed her to record a full-length album, she worked with producer Andrew Slater and released the record in the summer of 1996. Her confessional lyrics combined with her jazz-influenced sound immediately struck a chord with listeners and critics, with songs like Criminal turning into unexpected hits. Fiona has stayed iconic for rejecting the bullshit of celebrity culture, keeping her feet on the ground and always going with herself.

Magazines like Rolling Stone are still putting it on their top 500 albums lists, and many sites continue to praise Apple for writing such a bold debut album at 17. Writer Jenn Pelly praised the album in a recent review, stating that she "grapples eloquently with isolation, retribution, and the oceanic ups and downs of being young and being a woman". While she has continued to release excellent records with devastatingly honest lyrics and raw vocals, Tidal stands out as a highlight in her relatively small but strong discography. 

1. Sleep to Dream
2. Sullen Girl
3. Shadowboxer
4. Criminal
5. Slow Like Honey
6. The First Taste
7. Never Is a Promise
8. The Child Is Gone
9. Pale September 
10. Carrion

#BONUS RATE

Along with the main rate, we thought it would be fun to rate these additional songs that were recorded either before, slightly after, or during these album eras. We also included some fun clips as additional rating material (yes, we're actually rating Fiona saying that "this world is bullshit" and Björk talking about her TV). You **cannot** give any of these songs a 0 or an 11 - only scores from a 1 to a 10 will be accepted. This is optional, but we highly encourage you to have fun and participate in this bonus rate!

#Rules:

* You must rate every song in the main rate, with the exception of Me and a Gun, due to its potentially triggering subject matter involving sexual assault. You can choose to opt out of rating it by writing "Me and a Gun: 5 opting out" as your comment for the song.  

* Each song can receive a score between 1 and 10, and decimal points up to 1 place are allowed (e.g. 5.5, 7.3, 9.9 - NOT 5.55 or 9.99).

* You may give a 0 and/or an 11 to only one song each, and your 0 must be paired with a comment; 0s and 11s are not required. 

* If scores are missing, there are multiple 11s/0s, or other such mistakes, you will be notified and your scores will not be counted until they are corrected.

* Your scores are not confidential - they will likely be shared when the results are revealed, so be sure to rate accurately! Feel free to campaign for any song that you love, but do not let things get too heated.

   > Pale September: I’m giving this a 9 since September is the 9th month of the year!
 >
   > Crying: 9.9 - I'll be crying if this doesn't make it to day 3...
