**bbfan132** (10): So this is the first song out today‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm kind of sad about it. While it wasn‚Äôt the first song that I loved on Tidal, it has grown on me immensely with time and it‚Äôs now one of my favorites. The way Fiona creates these vivid visuals based solely off of her lyrics is astounding, and the lethargic jazzy production suits the song very well.

**Saison_Marguerite** (9.5): This sounds like a classic and a timeless song right away. The heartbreak in Fiona‚Äôs voice is palpable, yet it lacks some of the raw edge that take songs like Sleep to Dream and Criminal from near perfect to a reset for me.


---


**martintorov** (11): Even though Criminal was my first taste of Fiona‚Äôs music hehe, with Shadowboxer she completely won me over. She's been my favorite ever since.


**daretheghost** (10): This being in ¬æ time‚Äîa waltz‚Äîis really interesting when you consider the lyrical content. Sort of evokes images of a boxer swinging around the ring, or someone you tried to cut out of your life returning again and again after you force more distance.


**iniekcja_** (10): now why did this rate decide to play with my emotions like that


**qazz23** (10): One of her best, love the strings toward the end


**runaway3212** (10): This song is perfect


**stryxen** (10): this is just a perfect song


**survivorjdmarina** (10): The fact that this was her first ever song, yet it sounds like something an established artist would put out‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs so powerful.


**waluigiest** (10): The release into the chorus is so so satisfying. This is one of my favorite melody‚Äôs she has ever written


**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): She really wrings the melodies out of this one, just great


**plastichaxan** (9.5): these lyrics hit a little too close


**1998tweety** (9): the shadowboxers ended ha, go stream honeymoon


**CrimsonROSET** (9): that‚Äôs such a good analogy, goddamn


**Ghost-Quartet** (9): ugh this one hurts‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt exactly been in this situation but I‚Äôm all too familiar with the sensation of having to learn to duck and weave around the idiosyncrasies of other people in order to survive being around them


**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): I keep looking up her age when she wrote this and I don't believe it every time


**minibjork** (8.5): fiona's jazz influence really shines here


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.2): Ok ok I'm warming up to Fiona. I like this bluesy, jazzy track. Love Fiona's lower vocal register. And the lyrical idea behind Shadowboxer is cool.


**throwaway7650** (8): probably the song that stands out the least for me on tidal


**jman457** (7.8): All the elements of a great song but for some reason doesnt stick with me.


**KennyEarthman** (7): idk what "once my flame and twice my burn" means but it sounds poetic


**Uberpigeon** (7): ok i wish the chorus was like.. "shadooowww boxer" instead of "shadow boxer babe" i dont like the babe.


**fadedblue09** (6.5): This is just a prototype Paper Bag


**Doppleflooner** (4): Vocal delivery lets this one down a bit if I'm being brutally honest here.

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): This is just so happy and pure, and an unabashed pop song, I‚Äôm happy POPheads let this have a top 10 placement!


---



**frogaranaman** (11): I like moaning over house beats too


**J_Toe** (11): Just so fun! Bjork has certain grunts and screams she uses frequently as licks or hooks in her first three albums, but they work so well.


**vayyiqra** (11): Why is this my 11? This song doesn't fit the rate that well at all. It's an electronic dance track in an album with edgy alt rock and piano ballads. The reason is that this song is just so wholesome and fun. To put it in Popheads terms, it is a song about stanning your besties. It's about loving life and everyone around you. That's a topic we need more songs about. I love this song. It makes me happy, and I need that right now. Thank you for your music always being there for me, Bj√∂rk. (Also did I mention this is a fucking B O P)


**akanewasright** (10): I first knew bjork from the rate with Homogenic, and because of that, I had expectations for bjork in the future. Those expectations didn‚Äôt include straight up dance tracks.


**CrimsonROSET** (10): can‚Äôt relate but good for you hun <3


**fadedblue09** (10): This is very 90s yet feels fresh at the same time


**Hulnia** (10): Damn, I wish she made more stuff like this, she fits it well. Obviously not all her music, but at least more than we got.


**jman457** (10): Another Bjop by Miss Bjork.


**pietrohonkhonk** (10): This sounds like Mario Kart music in the best way possible


**plastichaxan** (10): i discovered this song at a party and it stuck with me ever since, one of the best parties i‚Äôve been to i want to go back to parties fuck covid


**qazz23** (10): I like the dancey stuff on this album


**Roxieloxie** (10): the way you can kinda put butter over this


**runaway3212** (10): Big time 10


**seanderlust** (10): songs to love the homies to


**skargardin** (10): BIG TIIIME SENSUALITY YYYYY


**stryxen** (10): heh if this gets robbed it would be a big time songeniality


**throwaway7650** (10): a dance bop, really like the message of the song


**TiltControls** (10): just a bop no way around it. also an 11 choice!


**1998tweety** (9.5): hold awn why does this bop


**LazyDayLullaby** (9.3): Name sums it up


**daretheghost** (9): I‚Äôm really liking when Bj√∂rk gets clubby.


**minibjork** (9): uhhh yeah this song has been a comfort song for me for ages now. i like the mv version a bit more though


**survivorjdmarina** (9): (nogues)


**WhyDoIExist** (9): Funky


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): This song....almost doesn't work lol. Relistening in 2021 the beat and vibe is so cheesy house music. But it's so fun! And Bjork's singing makes it her own so it's not generic by any means. Even though a lil cheesy, I love it!


**Doppleflooner** (8): Hate the production on this, but the song itself is so good that it manages to mostly overcome that for me.


**iniekcja_** (8): something huge is coming up, you said?üò≥ü•µ


**KennyEarthman** (8): the fluke minimix >>>


**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): Big Time Sensuality walked so Big Time Rush could fly


**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Mmm, theoretically this should be landing but I actually think it‚Äôs aged kinda poorly. It feels like an outtake from Mariah‚Äôs Emotions except we‚Äôve heard those now and they‚Äôre spicier than this. Although I will say I really enjoy the lyrics, I think it‚Äôs cool when songs grapple with the concept of ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù itself; so many songs are about it but so few songs actually face it head on like this.


**Uberpigeon** (7): i dont know what shes saying but i like the part where shes like heya hOOOOOOOOO!


**waluigiest** (7): good for dancing, it‚Äôs a little stagnant to listen to in most other contexts


**xxipilots** (6.8): Very pop in structure. It sounds like it could be released today.


**ImADudeDuh** (6): I‚Äôll be honest, I expected more from this song

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): The first time I heard this song, I was shaken to my core. It‚Äôs so cinema worthy, her feral-sounding vocals over the dramatic strings outsell almost every Bond theme.


---


**iniekcja_** (11): I like to call that growling sound she sometimes makes bj√§rking


**cremeebrulee** (10): when the only 11 i would give to bjork is not on the album skksdkd the rosalia print


**CrimsonROSET** (10): she really said vocals on this one


**Doppleflooner** (10): Very, very nearly got my 11. This is the Bjork I know and love so much. The production on this song is so much better than anything else on the album that it's obvious that it was added on, but I don't care. Just fucking awesome.


**stryxen** (10): wait why is this like really good


**throwaway7650** (10): as an OST, this song does sound like one [non-derogatory], I love the dramatics and the strings. 11-worthy, hope it makes day 2 at least


**vayyiqra** (10): I'm so glad this song is here since I've always played it at the end of the album and think of it as the true ending despite being a bonus track. The mood is a lot darker than the rest of the album, so it doesn't fit anywhere else. It is definitely a banger though.


**waluigiest** (10): I had no idea this song existed but wow? It‚Äôs a winner. Her voice is powerful, even for her standards. The orchestration is so full. It‚Äôs so full of drama.


**WhyDoIExist** (10): James Bond theme to end them all


**jry3** (9.5): Really enjoyed this one, but also sounds out-of-place. The fact that a few random-sounding songs were placed on an alternative dance/pop album really lowers my overall impression of the album.


**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): Grandiose and great finale, she really knows how to send off an album


**plastichaxan** (9.5): this would be such an incredible closer for the album too i love this


**1998tweety** (9): ok at least she ends on a bop


**daretheghost** (9): I actually really like this one‚Äîit reminds me a bit of some of the songs I know from her later albums.


**getin2it** (9): So cinematic. I just wish Bjork would finish out her songs than always fade them :/


**jman457** (9): really love the production on this, and the vocals on it remind me of her works with the sugarcubes


**Lilacly_Adily** (9): I like how cinematic this sounds


**qazz23** (9): Awesome closer, love the bass


**Uberpigeon** (9): i know the appeal of bjork is that she sings... like that.. but it sounds good when she sings normal!


**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love how lush this sounds, why is the better than the debut album


**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): This would be an easy 10 if the mixing weren‚Äôt so awful


**xxipilots** (8.5): - Very angry and the intense instrumentals really bring it out!


**J_Toe** (8): oh wow, I've never come across this before


**KennyEarthman** (8): getting army of me vibes


**survivorjdmarina** (8): oooh!


**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Hmmm, I like this but I think it‚Äôs overproduced and kinda gets lost in its own noise.


**fadedblue09** (7): Her grunts are SENDING me


**runaway3212** (6): kinda meh on this one tbh

**bbfan132** (10): It was hard to choose between Sugar and this, but I love this original version so much. It‚Äôs instantly catchy and gets you moving, but the chorus makes the song explode with energy. While the Tori/Kate Bush comparisons are tired, the pre-chorus and chorus really do remind me of her at points in a wonderful way. This is just as fun to listen to live, and I‚Äôm happy to see it make it to day 3.


**Saison_Marguerite** (9.7): Heavy Kate Bush vibes even though I know she would rather be compared to Led Zeppelin, lolol.


---


**approximatelymagic** (10): Every time I've seen her this is the song I'm hoping to hear most. I love everything about this song.


**Doppleflooner** (9): One of my favorite Tori B-sides, could have easily replaced a song or two on LE.


**jman457** (8.2): Love a good religious trauma song


**daretheghost** (8): I like to think the sword in her hand is the sword on the cover of Y Kant Tori Read.


**WhyDoIExist** (8): Should've been on the standard version...


**LazyDayLullaby** (7.4): Not bad


**seanderlust** (7): no cops at pride, only tori amos and her sword

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): Her horny on main moment. I love that she focuses on traditionally feminine qualities like softness and beauty as something desirable in men, queen of toxic masculinity.


---


**Hulnia** (11): This is the most beautiful song I think I‚Äôve ever heard. Her voice is just simply magical.


**LazyDayLullaby** (11): Not just my favourite Bj√∂rk song, but one of my favourite songs altogether. A gorgeous, lush, sensual celebration of aesthetics and sound.


**RandomHypnotica** (11): i LOVE how foreign yet familiar this sounds, it's so uniquely bjork, in both subject matter and instrumenation.


**akanewasright** (10): I‚Äôve heard this called the most ‚ÄúBjork‚Äù song on the album, and as much as I love the dance-inspired songs here, I think that‚Äôs very high (and apt) praise. Bjork is brilliantly otherworldly at her best, and that‚Äôs what you get from this


**cherryices** (10): this is so damn playful and charming!!


**ImADudeDuh** (10): Oh this is one of those gender envy songs huh


**iniekcja_** (10): I think I haven't come back to this album in a year or so and now this old icelandic woman is making me romantic and horny


**KennyEarthman** (10): when Venus is in the title it's a certified bop


**minibjork** (10): some of my favorite bj√∂rk gibberish moments here


**plastichaxan** (10): i love the imagery here, as in many songs in this rate, but here especially, it just makes my imagination go wild picturing all her metaphors and the boy she‚Äôs singing about


**runaway3212** (10): Me looking at Chris Evans


**Uberpigeon** (10): why did i think i hate this song


**vayyiqra** (10): This song is so beautiful. It just feels like warmth and happiness. It's almost like a lullaby.


**waluigiest** (10): I regret to inform you I have seen covers by men titled ‚ÄúVenus as a Girl‚Äù and one of them was literally a guitar cover with no vocals


**jman457** (9.6): A classic in terms of Bjork, beautiful production


**stryxen** (9.5): ok‚Ä¶ well whatever that means


**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): classic


**celladonn** (9): This is so dreamy, I feel like I'm falling in love with him too


**Doppleflooner** (9): Fabulous, but even here the production has some notable misses that almost derail it for me. But otherwise just gorgeous.


**fadedblue09** (9): Sonically and lyrically immaculate.


**WhyDoIExist** (8.5): It's so pretty


**bulforster** (8.4): The fact that this sounds a bit like spa music throws me a little.


**ignitethephoenix** (8): someone find me a man like this


**J_Toe** (8): cute and metaphysical


**seanderlust** (8): this sounds like the intro to a sitcom I would see in a lucid dream


**throwaway7650** (8): I love the xylophone (?) in the background. the instrumental is kind of clunky overall but I still like it


**1998tweety** (7.5): This was nice but could've done more


**CrimsonROSET** (7): perhaps my hottest take of the year in rates, yeah this kinda does nothing for me.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): Call me a flop plz but I've never been too into this song. The bongos (?) and all that just don't hit for me. The melody kind of annoys me. Shame!


**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This sounds like background music from a Neopets game


**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): lemme find me a venus real quick


**daretheghost** (6): I know this one‚Äôs one of Bj√∂rk‚Äôs more popular songs but it just doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot for me. The percussion and strings are cool, but that‚Äôs about it for me.

TidalBjorquakes: # Bj√∂rk - Debut


---


**Overall Average**: 8.026 **// Average Controversy:** 1.549


---


**Hulnia** (9.583): Although she‚Äôd go on to make even better (we need to rate Post and Vesperine), this is still an absolute insane debut, among the best of the decade, and my favourite album in the rate.


**vayyiqra** (9.250): There was never any chance here this album wouldn't get my highest score. I've been a fan of Bj√∂rk since I was a kid and saw the video for "All Is Full of Love", and this is one of my favourite albums by her. It's seriously underrated these days - many of her fans dislike it because it's more poppy and less experimental than her later output, but I find that rather snobby. This album is very of its time, and that's fine. Out of all her albums, it's the happiest one I think, and the most fun. It's not her best or my favourite, but it is an extremely good album. (Also it's so funny how it's technically not her debut but shh)


**waluigiest** (9.167): I think I‚Äôm strange among Bjork fans in that this is my favorite of her albums. She is an Artist with a capital A, and for casual listening her first few albums really find the great art pop pocket between accessible/danceable and avant-garde. I love this album for the same reason I love Carly Rae Jepsen: it turns songs about having huge emotions in naive relationships into fun party music. Perfect for the gays.


**cherryices** (9.058): bj√∂rk on creativity: ‚Äúi think creativity always lives somewhere in everyone but its nature is quite pranksterish and slippery and everytime u grab its tail its found a nu corner to thrive in . perhaps the trick is not to force it and put it up against a wall and want it to be in a particular area . but rather w a lot of kindness sniff it out and wonder where it has gone to this time around . if its in sauce recipes , writing theatre plays , papermache improv w nephews , discovering nu hiking routes or simply trying to figure out a family members sense of humour . i def don‚Äôt succeed in this all the time but feel overall things have been more fertile when i trust this creatures instincts and follow it rather than me willfully reforming it into a circus animal colouring by numbers . anyways : as much as youd like to ignore this animal u have to attend it . because if u dont them dark times turn up ‚Ä¶..‚Äù


**plastichaxan** (9.042): very underrated Bj√∂rk, yes, it may be her most acessible but i don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs exactly a bad thing, i enjoy the exploration in sound she does here and knowing her journey through her albums it‚Äôs pretty fun to see how certain sounds evolved and how she grew with them


**stryxen** (9.000): i dont think it‚Äôs her best but it‚Äôs definitely my favourite bjork album there are simply so many resets here and it still sounds so fresh for being almost thirty years old


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.900): Bjork forever


**LazyDayLullaby** (8.833): Bj√∂rk may have hit higher heights in terms of albums as a whole later on, but this is absolutely incredible in its own right, and has quite a few of the best songs she ever wrote (including Venus as a Boy, arguably her finest)


**jman457** (8.717): This album is the odd one out of the three, but it's filled with serves, and I'm shocked it's actually ‚Äúthe most accessible‚Äù because bjork and accessible don't really go together.


**runaway3212** (8.708): The app was a fad but this album was a perfect debut!! My favorite songs were all of them


**Brendon-Urine** (8.667): Bj√∂rk is just on another level of artistry. Like it's pretentious as fuck but it's true. Even her most "basic" album is absolutely amazing. Her voice, the beats, the writing, all amazing.


**minibjork** (8.583): i like to think britney's ...baby one more time intl. cover + debut cover are related


**qazz23** (8.583): Good mix of sounds on this album, I like the dancey stuff


**skargardin** (8.417): This really caught me off guard, even having listened to other Bj√∂rk albums before this. It's way more upbeat and danceable than I had anticipated, I definitely found myself enjoying it a LOT.


**survivorjdmarina** (8.208): [This is what the album sounds like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWqAf4eex14)


**xxipilots** (8.000): Definitely brought something new to the table. Her use of complex scales and genre-mixing really evokes the feelings and message she wants to express.


**fadedblue09** (7.792): The only Bjork album I‚Äôve heard fully before this was Medulla, which I liked, but I‚Äôve been told it wasn‚Äôt her usual sound. Now I finally got to listen to a more ‚Äútypical‚Äù Bj√∂rk album and I liked it! Pretty solid mix of danceable bops and otherworldly folk songs, I can see how this is a blueprint for later sounds. However, it feels a little undercooked concept-wise, especially knowing how Bjork normally is. Doesn‚Äôt help that even Bjork herself considers this album as a rehearsal, and sometimes it kinda shows.


**sufjancaesar** (7.750): I don‚Äôt have experience with Bjork and was warned that this is difficult to get into. As I listened ‚Ä¶ the absurd, eclectic instrumentals had me thinking/trying to understand what was going on more than I could let go and immerse myself into it. Which ‚Ä¶ I think is the fun in Bjork? I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed all this, but it‚Äôs one of the most unique listening experiences I‚Äôve had and that left me hungry for more.


**daretheghost** (6.833): Coming into this rate, this was the album I was least familiar with. I‚Äôve always really struggled to get into Bj√∂rk despite her showing up in so many ‚ÄúPeople also listen to‚Äù sidebars. Just something about her music has always felt a little inaccessible to me. I‚Äôm more of a Greatest Hits person. And after a few listens I think I‚Äôm mostly into the production here, which makes sense as I like a bunch of stuff Nellee Hooper had his hands on.


**KennyEarthman** (6.417): one of my least fave Bj√∂rk albums cuz I couldn't vibe with her voice here when I could do it with the others like Biophilia/Homogenic


**Doppleflooner** (5.917): My least favorite Bjork album (and I fucking love Bjork), and most of that comes down to the lackluster production. Her voice is great and unique from the very start, but the songs here can sound almost embarrassingly amateurish or weirdly basic, and only a few really stand out for me.

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): The way she eviscerates him for being emotionally immature and out of touch with reality is so satisfying, she did not come to play. And the ominous drums!!!


---


**cremeebrulee** (11): I GOT MY FEET ON THE GROUND AND I DON‚ÄôT GO TO SLEEP TO DREAM!!!! (i mean i do, but go off queen)


**WhyDoIExist** (11): You know the song is legendary when it inspired Kanye's first album


**akanewasright** (10): what a way to open a damn album


**CrimsonROSET** (10): men suck, more at 11


**daretheghost** (10): My favorite thing about Fiona are her lyrics, and I love the way her words flow together in this song. ‚ÄúThis mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways‚Äù rolls of the tongue in such a satisfying way, and the way they‚Äôre sung is so sharp.


**fadedblue09** (10): God this monstrous opener. Perfect way to start a career tbh.


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Fiona Apple has just ALWAYS been this good... Love the way she uses her voice in this one


**NevenSuboticFanNo1** (10): what a start to this album. this is already quintessential Fiona Apple after a few seconds


**plastichaxan** (10): the line ‚ÄúI got my own hell to raise‚Äù has stuck with me for so long now


**qazz23** (10): Great way to start a career


**runaway3212** (10): best openener in this rate


**stryxen** (10): (11 contender) one of my favourite fiona songs


**waluigiest** (10): An incredible introduction, it‚Äôs just so classically Fiona. Smart writing over a busy piano beat with heavy drums. She‚Äôs incredible.


**bulforster** (9.7): thinking about how kanye once said this was one of his favourite songs


**minibjork** (9.5): love this opener she sounds so strong here ... go fiona !


**Ghost-Quartet** (9): there are so many hot one liners in this song I‚Äôm not even gonna bother quoting any of them just check the genius page


**iniekcja_** (9): oh to not go to sleep to dream


**survivorjdmarina** (9): Apparently some of this song was written when she was around 13? That‚Äôs so impressive. Great vocal performance too.


**throwaway7650** (9): my score for this was way too low at first... what's wrong with me. the lyricism is so clever, even kanye tweeted about this song (even though he mistakenly attributed "I have never been so insulted in all my life" as the opening line of the song) [when this rate manifests DONDA's release]


**vayyiqra** (9): Wow, I was not expecting such a strong opener like this. Also Fiona's voice was so much lower back then.


**xxipilots** (9): Strong album opener. Sets the mood for the whole album.


**jman457** (8.7): The music video really added to this, but its a great introduction to her as an artist


**1998tweety** (8.5): bop


**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): i usually sleep because i have nothing else to do and i don‚Äôt remember my dreams. but this is a good song anyway


**Doppleflooner** (8): Pretty good, but I don't think she sells this super convincingly, if that makes any sense!


**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): I do like this song, but I don't love it and I can't put my finger on why. I do really like the sarcastic, dismissive lyrics. Maybe this is a "Seinfeld isn't funny" issue where I've listened to so many artists clearly inspired by Fiona.


**KennyEarthman** (7): the drums make this track


**Uberpigeon** (6): I sleep on this album

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): The first time I heard this song was in a mashup with PJ Harvey/Massive Attack/Bj√∂rk, lmao. As someone who tends to ‚Äúsuffer in silence‚Äù and push my feelings down, I find this really cathartic. I love how it starts melancholy and kinda creepy, then ends on a hopeful note.

---


**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Honestly I‚Äôm not sure I can even articulate why I‚Äôm giving this my 11 but when I first heard it it just hit me. Her voice is so beautiful here with the piano, it sounds like she‚Äôs dancing through a snowy forest like she‚Äôs in an old school Barbie movie or something like that. But the story she tells about having all of these thoughts inside of her but no way to communicate them and just kind of existing silently with fear that she‚Äôll never be able to connect with other people or even herself is so sad‚Ä¶ but she wrote this album which means she was able to overcome it and now everyone knows her ‚Äúreally deep thoughts.‚Äù :‚Äô)


**ImADudeDuh** (11): i am ascending


**jackisboredtoday** (11): i don‚Äôt have a ton to say about this other than how powerful it is lyrically and that its great, and my favorite discovery of the rate


**pietrohonkhonk** (11): This was the song that made me fall in love with Tori‚Äôs music, it‚Äôs so beautiful and the lyricism is incredible. One of Tori‚Äôs best songs.


**skargardin** (11): I just thought it was some of the best lyrics ever honestly, just wow


**akanewasright** (10): I do love that the way this song came about was that Tori wrote it intending to pitch it to someone else, planning to make it impersonal, but then someone else had to tell her ‚Äúuh‚Ä¶ you wrote your life story, you can‚Äôt give that song away‚Äù. Anyway uh‚Ä¶ yeah. I like this one a lot


**CrimsonROSET** (10): ok but if there was a cover of this in the live action the little mermaid with halle singing this? stunning


**daretheghost** (10): You know, sometimes I feel like this song is a little hokey. And other times I have a really rough day at work and this song brings me to tears while I‚Äôm driving home on the highway. ‚ÄúEverybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand. Yeah, I can hear them,‚Äù is like the most comforting hug sometimes.


**fadedblue09** (10): When the second chorus hits, it‚Äôs just magical


**jman457** (10): So nostalgic and heartbreaking, and a defiant statement. Tori at her best.


**seanderlust** (10): the repeating minor chord building tension only to suddenly resolve...chefs kiss


**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): What is so great about really deep thoughts? Hasn't done shit for me


**throwaway7650** (10): the following description applies to several songs on this album but this song sounds like it could belong on the soundtrack of a classic disney movie (the little mermaid did partially inspire this actually)


**waluigiest** (10): immaculate storytelling


**xxipilots** (10): This sounds magical yet lonely. It sounds fresh.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): This song has always resonated with me, the idea of being "silent all these years" and repressing how you really feel. It would be a 10, but the lyric "funny little shape" has always felt like a clumsy lyric. I do find the "what's so amazing about really deep thoughts" a funny and iconic late. So true, Tori! Trailblazed the "head empty" lifestyle, I love!


**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): CLEORRRRR! NAWWWR! THE CONDENSATION!


**1998tweety** (9): this builds really nicely in the second half


**Brendon-Urine** (9): that classical background comes out STRONG here


**celladonn** (9): Find it relatable as a bitch who struggles to express herself


**Doppleflooner** (9): So good, but a few little elements here and there that bug and drive the score down a bit. Again, obvious why it resonated with so many.


**frogaranaman** (9): queen of being silent all these years


**runaway3212** (9): Super pretty


**plastichaxan** (8.8): what's so amazing about really deep :thots:


**WhyDoIExist** (8.5): The bridge really makes the song


**stryxen** (8): these lyrics remind me of paper bag (ik this came first) so i bumped it up a point from good to great yass


**LazyDayLullaby** (7.9): I like the contrasts in speed and urgency


**iniekcja_** (7): the songwriting is stellar but something doesn't flow the way it should


**KennyEarthman** (7): that piano riff makes me uncomfortable in a good way


**survivorjdmarina** (7): Very simplistic. The lyrics are great.


**vayyiqra** (7): Those strings are so nice.


**jry3** (4): found it boring

**bbfan132** (10): Such an interesting cover of a classic Beatles song, yet it seems like it was meant to be. Fiona keeps the spirit of the original track while injecting some of her own touches in a way that can attract people who normally wouldn‚Äôt listen to the Beatles. I love the lethargic and brooding sound of the track as well - Jon Brion did a great job here. Definitely deserves to be the highest rated song in the bonus rate!

**Saison_Marguerite** (8): I would listen to this over the Beatles' original any day, Fiona sounds really comfortable with it as if she wrote it.


---


**Doppleflooner** (10): This was the only thing I was previously familiar with of hers, and I still love it as much today.


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Really beautiful, sensitive performance


**survivorjdmarina** (10): This is 100% the original version no cap


**WhyDoIExist** (10): Outdid The Beatles with so much ease


**J_Toe** (9): omg I love Pleasantville, but I never bothered to check who did this cover. Cool to know it was Fiona all along.


**stryxen** (9): banger (please don‚Äôt win please don‚Äôt win)


**akanewasright** (8.5): This is a lovely fucking cover


**jman457** (8.4): honestly solid cover, makes it her own


**daretheghost** (8): Fiona‚Äôs listless delivery really makes it sound like you‚Äôre floating across the universe.


**seanderlust** (7.5): musichead confession time: i don't feel like i'm into the beatles enough to ever completely lose my mind at a beatles cover. like, they're fine as a band but i never got the hype. maybe they were such the blueprint that it's the seinfeld isn't funny effect? idk


**plastichaxan** (7): outsold the beatles


**iniekcja_** (6): this is very unseasoned, very tourist who went to India and enjoyed the aesthetic and food so they bought a little colorful rug and back home they try to meditate while sitting on it and waiting for the curry they ordered from some chain restaurant to finally arrive


**TiltControls** (6): its a fine cover


**vayyiqra** (5): Sorry Fiona, I like you, I like the Beatles, but never liked this song much. It's not awful though.

**Saison_Marguerite** (11): Tori takes us on an intense journey of the contradictory norms she was expected to follow as a young woman, from the pressure of purity culture to the pressure of sexualizing herself. Rejecting Christian ideals doesn‚Äôt mean escaping patriarchy in society, it just takes a different form, the rules are repackaged. I deeply feel Tori‚Äôs pain of comparing herself to other women since childhood, and am blown away with the ferocity of her calling out the ways we‚Äôre ingrained so young. And the Nine Inch Nails reference made me yell!

---


**akanewasright** (11): I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way I can write about this song in a non superficial way that won‚Äôt involve oversharing so let me just say ‚Äúooh nice piano line‚Äù and move on


**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I had forgotten about this song but I'm OBSESSED! From the rhythmic breathing to the near-industrial drum banging to match the extra forte piano. So powerful!! The intense bridge is what took it over the top for me into 11 status. Pure unadulterated rage. "Fascist panties". Tori what??? U ok girl? I love the whole song though, and the festering resentment she feels with the fickle boys she'd have to deal with.


**runaway3212** (11): we need the hosts to play Oh! You Pretty Things by David Bowie after this


**veryanniev** (11): Incredible.


**celladonn** (10): This rocks??? The lyrics and themes of this album, wow


**CrimsonROSET** (10): is jesus making you cum the christian version of daddy issues


**daretheghost** (10): [azealia banks megaphone gif] SO YOU CAN MAKE ME CUM THAT DOESN‚ÄôT MAKE YOU JESUS


**Doppleflooner** (10): A fucking masterpiece. So dramatic and amazing.


**fadedblue09** (10): This was my first exposure to Tori‚Äôs music a few years back. I just love ascending piano melodies (shout out to Regina Spektor‚Äôs Us) and the lyrics are just so hard-hitting.


**ImADudeDuh** (10): ‚ÄúSo you can make me cum, that doesn‚Äôt make you Jesus‚Äù is jesus known for making people cum? Go off king!


**iniekcja_** (10): oh fuck me up


**jman457** (10): This feels so anthemic, and the pre-chorus scream gives me life


**qazz23** (10): The piano is so good here


**sarcasticsobs** (10): perfect song?


**superrcrazy** (10): The bridge is everything!


**survivorjdmarina** (10): This had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Such a powerful track both lyrically and production-wise.


**throwaway7650** (10): tori's channeling her alanis morisette here, love the drums. the lyrics are really thoughtful and contain a lot of clever references


**1998tweety** (9.5): omg this is amazing, that one line where I got some Alanis..that ate


**getin2it** (9.5): THAT GUITAR THOSE DRUMS THIS ANGST


**plastichaxan** (9.5): men are awful!!!


**WhyDoIExist** (9.5): The sound, the lyrics... queen


**stryxen** (9): i have complete brain rot for a second i thought the moan after the chorus was cupcakke


**xxipilots** (9): This sounds very haunting; so ethereal. Reminds me of Mitski's Geyser.


**jry3** (8.5): again, don't like the production but really good


**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): trent reznor found dead


**minibjork** (8): fuck middle school


**vayyiqra** (8): The more I read about Tori's life the more I get where this kind of angry song is coming from. I understand this song has a lot to do with her religious upbringing.


**waluigiest** (8): Spyro the Dragon OST realness!!!


**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I for sure thought that she said ‚Äúand I died, but I banged him‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúwow okay that escalated quickly‚Äù


**KennyEarthman** (7): that's true I don't think Jesus really made someone cum in the Bible either

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): Not to get too personal on main, but as someone who lost her father young, this song makes me ultra emotional. And as a Canadian, the winter imagery is a mood.

---


**1998tweety** (11): thank you bbfan132 for showing me this song. when she says CAUSE THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE SO FAST i ascend.


**Doppleflooner** (11): It made me cry okay? Somehow it never did until I re-listened for this rate and it just hit me out of nowhere. Gotta give it my all when it makes me gasp-cry.


**TiltControls** (11): I have been OBSESSED with this song since I heard it for the rate. It just makes me feel all warm, but it's also super cold and distant and ugh I just want to loop it forever (and I will!)


**Brendon-Urine** (10): wowowowowow this is STUNNING, like it hurts but hurts so good


**cremeebrulee** (10): oh this is CINEMATIC i love a good instrumental moment


**daretheghost** (10): Another song that totally wrecks me if I‚Äôm in the right (wrong?) headspace. ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôre you gonna love you as much as I do?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou say ‚ÄòI wanted you to be proud of me.‚Äô I always wanted that, myself.‚Äù


**getin2it** (10): That violin! That piano! I adore how delicate this soundscape is and how Tori is almost skating over the words


**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is gorgeous


**jman457** (10): Frozen is shook, this song has such main character energy.


**jry3** (10): absolutely beautiful


**KennyEarthman** (10): brings out my inner elsa


**pietrohonkhonk** (10): This may seem like a ‚Äúboring‚Äù song but the melodies, lyrics, and vocals make this into an easy 10


**runaway3212** (10): Fuck it im also giving this a 10, I love this whole wintery feel of this song and how intense she sings all of it


**skargardin** (10): YOU SAY THAT THINGS CHANGE, MY DEAR


**stryxen** (10): COS THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE SO FASSTTTT


**throwaway7650** (10): this song really captures the essence of the season in its name... the storytelling is wonderful and the bridge is absolutely transcendent


**WhyDoIExist** (10): This is probably the best of its kind from the rate


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.4): Another beautiful ballad. Great lyrics on reflecting on the confidence she needs to pursue her dreams. If the annotations are true and this is her reflecting on the nice things her dad used to say, I love that! What a touching song. Comparatively it's not my favorite song of LE but still great.


**akanewasright** (9): when the strings come in and I just ascend


**fadedblue09** (9): Love the gorgeous imagery, and the title is apt cuz I definitely feel winter from this song. The orchestral solo is majestic


**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Big fan of this one, especially once the chorus hits. Second best on the album for me


**survivorjdmarina** (9): Wow, this is harrowing. The lyrics are the real star.


**waluigiest** (9): the drama embedded in the orchestration is so tasty


**celladonn** (8.5): So many songs on this album feel like fairytales, this is lovely


**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): there‚Äôs so much to unpack here, perhaps too much?


**plastichaxan** (8.5): that was so powerful wow


**seanderlust** (8): tori amos and smash mouth shaking hands on skating on thin ice dot jpg


**vayyiqra** (8): I'm trying to avoid the clich√© Kate Bush comparisons here but this really is quite Kate Bush, lol.


**minibjork** (7.5): piano ballads are usually a hit or miss for me but w/ tori its different huh. i guess the orchestra helps + i love her songwriting style.


**Ghost-Quartet** (7): There are some really pretty moments and I like how ‚Äúepic‚Äù it is but I kinda tune in and out of it

**BoneStreetSand** (11): Floored me instantly. I still have chills.


**1998tweety** (10): oh my lorde this is beautiful


**akanewasright** (10): This is a difficult listen, even for a non-SA survivor like me. I don‚Äôt know what I can say other than I was incredibly moved by it and that I am so happy that Tori has become the figure she is for RAINN


**CrimsonROSET** (10): I hope she has seen Barbados since.


**daretheghost** (10): Speaks for itself.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is one of the most haunting and descriptive, creative yet bleak songs ever. Bravo Tori for recounting such a horrific experience. What an incredible song.


**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Yes it‚Äôs impressive that this is a cappella, but it helps that it‚Äôs a good song too


**ImADudeDuh** (10): i listened to this track once before and I can never listen to it again tbh


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Incredibly difficult, incredible


**runaway3212** (10): A word that really comes to mind this entire album is intense and this is probably the most intense song on this album. It's intense in its truth, it's intense in its beauty, it's intense in its uglyness.


**seanderlust** (10): chilling. the decision to make this a capella makes this that much more potent


**throwaway7650** (10): gut-wrenching lyrics. tori is known for piano but her voice and harrowing lyrics are enough for this song to have tremendous impact


**vayyiqra** (10): I don't know how to rate this. This is a song about her worst trauma of her life. It almost feels like we should not be rating this, because it's too dark and too personal. It makes me feel sick while hearing it and thinking about what she's singing about. But I also think that's why we should at least listen to it in this rate, to try to understand on some level what she felt, as long as you can handle it (and it's fine if you don't want to; I know it's upsetting). All I can say is I first heard this song when I was a kid and will never forget it.


**veryanniev** (10): It‚Äôs not a song I‚Äôm gonna be listening to regularly, but every single day since I‚Äôve heard it I‚Äôve thought about it, and that‚Äôs rare.


**waluigiest** (10): This song is striking and upsetting and the way it‚Äôs positioned on the album is so, so powerful.


**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): Holy fuck. This being an a capella track makes it all the more powerful.


**Brendon-Urine** (9): similar to For Her from FTBC, this is a devastating song that I will likely not listen to again. Very hard to process.


**KennyEarthman** (9): the lack of instruments really help to emphasize the subject matter


**RandomHypnotica** (9): haunting, delicate, uncomfortable and beautiful


**Uberpigeon** (9): completely horrifying


**xxipilots** (9): This is definitely haunting; stomach-wrenching, even. The acapella delivery makes it very personal.


**jman457** (8.9): It's hard to rate this song because it's more of a stream of consciousness rather than a song. But it's also so central to the themes of this album


**plastichaxan** (8.8): this is very difficult to listen to, and yet i can‚Äôt deny how much of an achievement it is, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll come back to it as a song much but wow


**celladonn** (8.5): Very heavy and devastating, and the acapella makes it impossible not to feel the full impact of the lyrics. I never want to listen to this again.


**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): absolutely haunting, normally something that was this stripped back would not grab my attention but her delivery and the lyrics are just wow


**J_Toe** (7): while it's not a song I would regularly listen to, I'm giving it a high score just for impressing me with how out of left field it is


**WhyDoIExist** (7): Musically it isn't great but the lyrics are heart breaking and so powerful


**bulforster** (5.8): Obviously powerful and important for her to have written but I don't think I'm really going to want to listen to it again.


**Doppleflooner** (3): Obviously had a huge impact, but I honestly don't think it's a good song? The lyrics are a tough listen, and the overly simple a cappella makes this a skip for me.

**bbfan132** (10): The first and best TV review ever. Thank you, Bj√∂rk!

---


**Brendon-Urine** (10): her voice is actual asmr (also she said gay hehehe)


**cherryices** (10): ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt let poets lie to you‚Äù is a line i think about almost daily and it‚Äôs from a video of bj√∂rk dismantling a television


**frogaranaman** (10): literally such a mood this is totally me when I talk about my TV


**iniekcja_** (10): for some reason I always expect the tv to explode or something, it would be very on brand for her


**J_Toe** (10): this proto-tech review about a little city that gives solid advice about not letting poets lie to you is the kind of naive camp that motivates us all to devote ourselves to pop


**jman457** (10): would be an easy 11 if we ever do a bonus winners rate


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): I want a whole series of this


**minibjork** (10): u shouldn't let poets lie to you !!!!


**NevenSuboticFanNo1** (10): this gets an honorary eleven


**nootnoot781** (10): very gay, i would 11 this if i could


**plastichaxan** (10): my media technology teacher showed us this video and i think that says a lot about my academic formation (in a good way)


**RandomHypnotica** (10): this would be an 11 if I could, Bjork just has a way of entracing you no matter what she says


**sarcasticsobs** (10): ‚Äúthis is maybe an elevator to go up there‚Äù she‚Äôs *RIGHT*


**skargardin** (10): it doesn't get more iconic than this does it


**stryxen** (10): me when im bjork talking about my tv


**vayyiqra** (10): Easiest 10 ever. It's not even because of the meme, I just love this video. It's so pure."You shouldn't let poets lie to you" is such an iconic line.


**WhyDoIExist** (10): Queen of being very gay about Christmas


**celladonn** (9): Oh to be a television opened up and examined by Bj√∂rk...


**Lilacly_Adily** (9): I couldn‚Äôt have imagined a better video. Bless that Danish book.


**seanderlust** (9): petition to make all reviews on CNet conducted by Bjork. i'm not buying anything until I know what the icelandic poets and danish books are saying about the samsung galaxy.


**survivorjdmarina** (9): televisiuhn


**akanewasright** (8): ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt let poets lie to you‚Äù is such a lovely piece of advice for like‚Ä¶ literally an unhinged rant about a TV


**daretheghost** (8): For the meme. As an aside, I think the video of Tori going piano shopping would sit nicely with Fiona‚Äôs VMA speech and Bj√∂rk talking about her TV.


**TiltControls** (7.5): who needs wikipedia when we have bjork to explain us things


**Hulnia** (2): This video lives rent free in my mind, but it just doesn‚Äôt feel right to me for something that‚Äôs not a song to win. üò≠


**TragicKingdom1** (1): not her supporting the capitalist holiday of Christmas :/

**fadedblue09** (11): Overall, it‚Äôs just a very stunning album opener, and in many ways, I think this captures the essence of Tori‚Äôs music throughout this album: a piano-driven song that comes with a confessional and anthemic message.


**KennyEarthman** (11): banger song with banger lyrics. what's not to love


**plastichaxan** (11): i love religious imagery used in music, everything about this song transports me to another situation and invokes a lot of intense feelings in me


**Uberpigeon** (11): nothing i do is good enough for yOUEW


**cremeebrulee** (10): i rly rly love this, what an amazing opener


**CrimsonROSET** (10): phenomenal start to the rate


**daretheghost** (10): ‚ÄúJust what God needs: one more victim‚Äù and ‚Äúgot enough guilt to start my own religion‚Äù are such bold lyrics for the opening track of your debut album. For a while when I was feeling a little overwhelmed by the College Experience I would lay in bed and listen to this album‚Äîor more specifically this song‚Äîto ground me. And some [redacted] years later, this song still brings me comfort when things are feeling rocky.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This was almost my 11. What a sublime song to kick off this great album. It's dramatic, potent and still has a bit of an ethereal quality to it. Like dark, piano chamber pop. I've always strongly related to the lyrics about crucifying yourself for other people's validation, and I've needed to hear them more than ever.


**Doppleflooner** (10): That kick drum! This song is well-known for a reason.


**getin2it** (10): It's hard to say this set the standard for all the grunge emo formerly-religious kids when so many of the songs on Little Earthquakes do... I hope people notice the Tori Amos to Florence + The Machine connection as the same themes arise and there's the same intensity and baroque/intricate sound.


**ignitethephoenix** (10): amazing


**ImADudeDuh** (10): iiiiiii‚Äôm crucifiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeed, crucifiiiiied like my saaavior


**pietrohonkhonk** (10): That pre-chorus >>>


**qazz23** (10): Solid opener, I like the chorus and the way she says "Chains"


**runaway3212** (10): This song is cool, because it's full of critistian imagery with the saviour and the crucifixion and she uses the life of jesus as a juxtaposition with her own as an expression of her own self doubt and that really just hits for me


**seanderlust** (10): (darienne lake voice) savior walkin down these dirty streets/ lookin for a savior all these dirty feet


**throwaway7650** (10): the melodies of this song and the piano are really nice but it's the lyrics that make this a 10 (an 11 contender really). as of late I have found myself "crucify[ing] myself" as tori describes in the lyrics (uni has been kicking my ass among other things) so this song really resonates with me


**TiltControls** (10): another amazing song and 11 possibility!


**vayyiqra** (10): I was there, and this song is exactly what the 90s sounded like: angsty, raw, edgy, there was still piano and guitar in the same song. This song has aged incredibly well.


**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): Smashing opening track. The themes are so relatable and the percussion throughout is so beautiful.


**1998tweety** (9): Jesus before jumping on the cross


**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really like the lyrics to this one, though I do wish she repeated the chorus a little bit less because it doesn‚Äôt need to be this long


**iniekcja_** (9): I didn't expect the drums to be drumming this hard


**minibjork** (9): love love love this song forever :) emotional guilt into cathartic release.


**stryxen** (9): perfect opening track and so intense i‚Äôm literally crying and shaking


**waluigiest** (9): I get this really strong Kate Bush vibe


**WhyDoIExist** (9): These openers for all the albums are so killer


**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): the ‚Äúchaaaaiiins‚Äù but isn‚Äôt super up my alley but the lyricism here is gorgeous. honestly outside of that post-chorus this whole thing is damn near perfect


**LazyDayLullaby** (8.6): Works really well as an opener, though not quite as well as Sleep to Dream


**jman457** (8.5): Really great start to an album that only gets better from here. Wish it was just a tad shorter thought


**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): for some reason, the melodies here reminds me a lot of Dido's Thank You


**xxipilots** (8.5): Gives me folklore vibes. Sounds apocalyptic.


**jry3** (8): excellent song, but production sounds very cheap and dated


**approximatelymagic** (6): I love this album but this song bums me out because it reminds me I used to listen to Stabbing Westward.

TidalBjorquakes: # Tori Amos - Little Earthquakes


---


**Overall Average**: 8.400 **// Average Controversy:** 1.394


---


**plastichaxan** (9.450): okay, i‚Äôm officially into Tori Amos, i need to stream her other stuff and i‚Äôm glad this is the album i discovered her through, every single song is extremely powerful and hits so many nerves in me musically and lyrically that this average is me trying to be harsh to it, every single song has something incredible about it and i‚Äôm just in love with this album i wish i could give it (and Tori) a big hug and cry together.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.383): I hadn't listened to this album since high school. I like it fair enough then. But now I've really grown to have a soft spot for this album. It's emotional, creative and visceral. Tori finds away to be vulnerable yet incisive. From the piano to the pounding drums and vocal layering details. My returned queen!


**akanewasright** (9.350): Uh‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be as blown away by this album as I was.


**pietrohonkhonk** (9.292): Tori Amos is so underrated, especially with how much she influenced this current crop of indie girls. This album is incredible and Tori absolutely deserves to win this rate.


**daretheghost** (9.000): A bold, brave, daring debut album that I genuinely feel paved the way for so many of the female confessional singer-songwriters that would follow in the 90s and even to this day.


**xxipilots** (8.933): This sounds like Taylor, Mitski, and Weyes rolled up into one. This sounds like something that could be released today.


**skargardin** (8.917): The poetry, the piano, the vocals.. I'm stunned by this honestly. I will definitely check out her other work.


**stryxen** (8.867): i‚Äôm just blown away by this album it‚Äôs VERY intense so i can‚Äôt listen to it all that often but paying attention to every little detail is mindblowing and i‚Äôm so glad i did this rate :)))


**Hulnia** (8.833): Holy shit, what a discovery. Although it‚Äôs still probably my least favourite of the 3, I‚Äôll definitely be re-listening and exploring more of her stuff.


**runaway3212** (8.833): The only album here I didnt know but god it's so good, maybe my favourite discovery from rates ever


**jman457** (8.800): So my roommate got really into Tori this past year, and honestly its great to understand the love he has for her. I see myself returning to this album alot after this rate. This album is almost a form of therapy


**TiltControls** (8.750): this album is too good for its own right


**survivorjdmarina** (8.667): Although I‚Äôve listened to Tori before, this is the first album of hers I‚Äôve listened to all the way through. It was great, and surprisingly not a hard listen. It went by pretty quickly, and definitely showcases Tori as a talented songwriter and pianist. She‚Äôs amazing.


**qazz23** (8.667): I liked it as a new listener, will check out more of her work


**minibjork** (8.591): free therapy


**fadedblue09** (8.458): Tori has been hailed as a mother figure of piano rock (one of my favorite genres), so it was only natural that I would gravitate towards her music the most. But besides that, I do feel like this is the most accomplished body of work among the three. Her songwriting is a perfect balance of artsy and confessional, and the fact that she did this with mostly just a piano makes it all the more impressive. I am now excited to explore the rest of her huge (and hopefully not daunting) discography.


**celladonn** (8.333): Wasn't too sure what to expect from this as I've never listened to Tori before but this ended up being comfortably my favourite album of the three


**sufjancaesar** (8.000): As someone unfamiliar with Tori, I was excited to dive in. This is a timeless album, one I could imagine many generations loving. It jumps from playful to emotional in a way that is sometimes disorienting but makes for an exciting listening experience. The whimsical piano playing here really sticks out and sells the hell out of the emotions.


**Doppleflooner** (8.000): It's been a good couple years since I've listened to Tori and I forgot how strong her start was. You sometimes forget exactly which songs come from which album, and I forgot how many great songs were on this. Such an extremely confident debut album.


**Brendon-Urine** (7.917): Definitely want to spend more time listening to this, even the multiple listens for this rate weren't enough to fully understand it. But she has an awesome voice and I love the classical influence.


**vayyiqra** (7.833): This is the album here I've known the longest, having first found Tori's music almost 20 years ago when I was a kid and just getting into music discussion online. (Yes, I am a veteran, you had better believe it. I've seen shit.) This album always seemed daunting, being both long and being adult alternative kind of music, something I was too young to get and to relate to it, but I love her piano playing and voice. Even today with many years more experience and knowledge, Tori's lyrics are often hard to interpret and her music can be challenging, but I can appreciate more fully what an excellent work this is. It's the album here that feels more like "art" music, whatever that means to you.


**LazyDayLullaby** (7.333): I was not at all familiar with Tori Amos before the rate, but this has made me want to check out more


**KennyEarthman** (7.000): thought I would be bored asf since it's mostly ballads. was pleasantly surprised


**J_Toe** (6.167): Sorry my comments on this album are sparse. I have never heard it before, and it's honestly not what I like, but I want to be respectful.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): ended fadquin phoenix


**WhyDoIExist** (10): Might you say... legendaric, inspired the title to her next album (AKA her best) so it a win for me


**RandomHypnotica** (9): what an iconic speech, but not as iconic as my 10

**vayyiqra** (8): pretty based ngl


**jman457** (2.5): Hot take but this comes off as the opitimoe of r/im14andthisisdeep

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): This wasn‚Äôt winning until the last week of the rate or so, and though I would have loved Crucify to have a dark horse win, I never doubted that this would take the crown in the end. I really enjoy Criminal for being a classic example of a female "antihero" song, at a time when women expressing weird bad feelings beyond "I‚Äôm heartbroken", let alone admissions of moral failings or hurting others, was still kinda taboo in the mainstream. As Todd in the Shadows said in his review of Bitch by Meredith Brooks, you could say ‚Äúbitch‚Äù on the airwaves but ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bitch‚Äù was a shocking statement. Unlike Bitch‚Äôs "take me as I am" approach, an agonized Fiona takes responsibility and seeks accountability with real emotional gravitas. Maybe it‚Äôs not that personal to Fiona since she wrote the song in less than an hour, but the flavour and drama of her performance can't be denied. Btw, I LOVE the outro, it simply gets me every time.

---


**daretheghost** (11): The song that launched a million proto-Internet thinkpieces.


**ignitethephoenix** (11): The fact this is my favorite Fiona song just proves I‚Äôm basic af and my taste is boring but idc this song is so good.


**JunkyGS** (11): LET HER WIN FINALLY, PLEASE!!!!


**qazz23** (11): It's one of her best, really strong melody and catchy - plus the piano breakdown and strings at the end!


**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): This is the best thing to happen in the 90s


**TragicKingdom1** (11): let's make this the second winner in less than a year with "criminal" in the title


**akanewasright** (10): this is the most basic, boring winner this rate could have, and I‚Äôd rather have a Tori win or even a Bjork win, but Fiona deserves a win after the pitchfork rate, and this song is that good. If this wins and you‚Äôre :/ about it, just pretend Ladies won or something


**cremeebrulee** (10): can yall give fiona her damn rate win already


**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean, she da smasha. As in smash a table into pieces.


**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this deserves to win like Jennifer Lopez deserved to get nominated for an Oscar for her work in Hustlers (2019)!


**ImADudeDuh** (10): it grew on me


**J_Toe** (10): the only Fiona song I'm previously familiar with


**jackisboredtoday** (10): I will not lie, i only had a passing familiarity with this before J-Lo‚Äôs Hustlers scene, but that scene used the song to such a different effect and made it take on a whole new dimension. GOD i need to watch Hustlers again ASAP. Anyway this is the boring winner but I won‚Äôt be mad if it wins bc its that great


**jman457** (10): Sure it's a well known classic, but for good reason as it's the best song on this album. Also after yall couldnt properly give it its due in the previous 2 rates its been in I have little faith for this one


**LazyDayLullaby** (10): It's the big one for good reason: Fiona Apple is just incredible at combining earworms with compelling lyrics and expertly employed dissonance


**plastichaxan** (10): everything about this song is just perfect, it is such a classic and one of the best songs like ever


**runaway3212** (10): The outro makes this a 10 alone


**seanderlust** (10): this is such a banger. 11 contender.


**skargardin** (10): undisputably one of her best


**stryxen** (10): i simply cannot give this anything but a 10 it perfect and then some


**survivorjdmarina** (10): I mean classic of course


**throwaway7650** (10): quirky instrumental [non-derogatory], godly outro. this song just screams "hit" (which it was) and a worthy 11 contender/rate winner


**waluigiest** (10): It‚Äôs iconic for a reason


**WhyDoIExist** (10): A whole bop that deserved its popularity


**bulforster** (9.7): JLo pole dancing to it is an 11


**1998tweety** (9.5): britney ended ha


**celladonn** (9): A boppington


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): This will probably win, lol. But I can't deny it's iconic and intoxicating! Fiona really is that bitch.


**iniekcja_** (9): this is a great song, that pales when compared with the rest of Fiona's discography, but it still is great


**KennyEarthman** (9): that outro drags and it's why this isn't a 10


**pietrohonkhonk** (9): it would be a 10 if this were the single edit but this is a bop either way


**Uberpigeon** (9): my contrarian heart hates to admit that this is popular for good reason


**minibjork** (8.5): i like the song but i wish it wasn't the first song people think of when people think fiona apple :/


**TiltControls** (8.5): it's good and probably the most well known track here, but with these 3 album it's not as much as a standout like some of the other songs


**Doppleflooner** (8): Pretty darn good. I remember the video being a pretty big deal when it came out, but I don't think I had actually heard the song itself much before now.


**letsallpoo** (8): excited to watch this lose its third rate


**vayyiqra** (8): It's a classic, I remember seeing the video on TV as a kid, it's iconic. I don't want it to win, I'm honestly a little tired of it after 25 damn years of my life, but it deserves respect.


**fadedblue09** (7.5): I'd be happy to see Fiona finally win a rate, but tbh this is not even a personal fave of mine. It's too drowned in many bad-girl cliches and doesn't seem worth its running time.


**getin2it** (7): As a HUGE Fiona fan, I've never been a huge fan of Criminal. In the same way she wrote this as a "fuck off" to her label, it stands out as an outsider in her work

**Overall Average**: 8.332 **// Average Controversy:** 1.395

**daretheghost** (9.500): I really do think Fiona is one of the absolute best lyricists in music right now, and this album really exemplifies that. The way she puts phrases together and can evoke so much with so few (or so many) words is really magical.


**survivorjdmarina** (9.450): This was the only album out of the bunch that I‚Äôve listened to previously, and probably my favourite too, unless Little Earthquakes suddenly surpasses it. This is an amazing album, especially for a debut, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why artists and music fans love it today! I love this woman so much and for what she‚Äôs done for me and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for this album.


**jry3** (9.400): Definitely my favorite of the 3. Very consistent except for the somewhat disappointing opener. Can't believe she was only 19 when this came out. Especially appreciated the strong jazz influence, wish there was more artists fusing jazz and pop like this but she's the only one I'm aware of.


**Hulnia** (9.300): If this rate were to remind me of one thing, it would be how much I love Fiona Apple, and this is definitely my favourite of hers.


**xxipilots** (9.090): As someone who started listening to her through FTBC (and because of that one Family Guy cutaway), this really made me change the way I view Fiona. This is painful and I'm glad I got to hear it. The piano instrumental throughout the album really ties the album together.


**plastichaxan** (9.080): i gave this a very high score because it fully deserves it, however, i don‚Äôt know how much i will come back to a lot of these songs, this album was a bit hard to get into but i‚Äôm glad i did and while it‚Äôs probably not my favorite fiona i can appreciate it especially it being her debut album


**stryxen** (8.950): i‚Äôm a fiona stan and i went into this expecting tidal to be one of my lower averages and idek why i ever doubted myself listening to virtually every song here is a whole unique experience i love this woman


**skargardin** (8.900): Her songwriting is simply unmatched, and it truly shines on this ablbum. Absolute lyrical legend.


**runaway3212** (8.800): I love this album!


**LazyDayLullaby** (8.740): This album title is way too short


**sufjancaesar** (8.700): To start, this album cover is unreal. And very quickly drew me in to wanting to explore this as a huge FTBC fan. As always, her vocals pierce through and really sell the emotional lyrics. Yet the album sound is catchy, soulful, original and relaxing. For a debut at 19, I‚Äôm truly in awe at the depth of this album.


**qazz23** (8.700): It's not my favorite Fiona album (prefer Idler Wheel & FTBC), but still a strong debut


**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.590): I'd never heard this ahh. I'm not head over heels in love, however it's a very excellent album!


**NevenSuboticFanNo1** (8.300): this is not my favourite Fiona Apple album. my hot take might be that it's actually her worst, but i'm not entirely sure. However it is still an incredible album of course.


**fadedblue09** (7.700): I love Fiona, but this has always been her weakest album for me (yes, I put Extraordinary Machine over this). My main nitpick is that this album sounds too cold and monotonous. Her songwriting is excellent as always, though I do feel like she tends to over-rely on verbose vocabulary. Her later works honestly did this stuff much better by balancing her mature songwriting with a more warm, quirky personality that would be more definitive of her sound.


**jman457** (7.670): Honestly expected more from this album considering how FTBC was one of my favs, the weakest in this group


**minibjork** (7.550): this is my least favorite fiona record but the highs are so high


**pietrohonkhonk** (7.500): It‚Äôs fine, I guess? My main issue is that a lot of the songs drag on longer than they should for songs as slow as they are. I was expecting more from Fiona Apple but it‚Äôs not bad for a debut.


**vayyiqra** (7.400): Sorry Fiona, I like this album, I like you, but your album happened to be last and I know it the least well. I don't have time to write long comments for it either, because I'm super tired and need to finish this rate. I did listen to every album in the rate about 5 times over the course of a few days, trying to be fair, but I just don't know it well enough to be quite fair to it. It's good though and I will have to go back to it again someday.


**KennyEarthman** (7.000): on a regular album scale this is like a 7 but on a Fiona album scale this is a 4


**Doppleflooner** (5.200): My first time listening as it somehow escaped me previously. I can see why she appealed so much to people, but it wasn't super my thing. I think I'd like later albums from her more, as I just didn't connect with most of it at all.

darjeelingdarkroast: /u/bbfan132 and /u/Saison_Marguerite great job hosting! It was hilarious and you guys also did great handling the gravity of these serious subjects.

A lot of 90's alternative music sounds are coming back into the mainstream, so this rate was super fun to explore these great women's works ‚ù§Ô∏è

TidalBjorquakes: Thank you so much! Also shout out to /u/ResIsByTheBatphone, our honorary third rate host!! And I totally agree with you, I love to see it. My goal with the musical interludes in the reveal was to highlight notable 90s alternative women, and the modern artists who were influenced by them! - Saison/Euphie

TiltControls: I can't believe I had to miss the final day, but I'm here now! Thanks to Sam and Euphie for the amazing rate (and Nick too)! Would've liked a Tori win, but Criminal is a very deserving winner! (Though Big Time Sensuality was 100% robbed!)

Now onto the [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates like always! Rushing a bit here, so mostly keeping these in shorter point form


##**Songs**

Congrats to Criminal for the win today! After failing the previous two times (12th in Charity Rate 2 and 10th in the 90's VH1 Rate), the third time proved to be the charm! This places it along side other 3rd time winner songs like Dancing On My Own, We Belong Together, Say My Name, Damn Daniel, and Low!

* This rating of Criminal places it as the 68th highest rated song of all time!

* Criminal also lands on the list of songs to avoid getting a sub-7 score in a rate, along with [27 others!](https://pastebin.com/KJ64aiUH)

##**Artists**

* Bjork's lowered average drops her a bit from her amazing overall 4th highest place to a still respectable 18th

* Funny enough, Tori takes over Bjork's spot and now has the 4th highest artist average

* Fiona keeps her 9th place average with only a 0.006 total gain from her previous total

* Bjork ties for 4th earliest exit in a 3 album rate with her 8th place elimination. This ties her with Prince and The Beatles (who both also left in 8th), and places her slightly better than Charli, Kylie, and D'Angelo.

* Tori becomes one of 11 other artists to never pick up a single 0!

* Tori's Little Earthquakes lands on the highest album averages leaderboard in 12th place with an amazing 8.400! Fiona's Tidal also lands on the list in a great 19th place, making her the only artist to have 3 different albums on the highest album average leaderboard! (When the Pawn... is 8th and FTBC is 21st)

* Tori also takes a spot on the lowest artist controversy list with the 8th lowest! Though unfortunately Fiona increases hers just slightly enough to fall off the board in return.

##**Rates**

* The rate takes the 4th highest rate average of all time! Taste came through!

* It also lands on the lowest rate controversy leaderboard in 7th!
