Electronic juggernaut Flume saw strong success with his more pop-oriented 2016 project Skin, and this song plays to those strengths very well. Tove Lo brings a passionate feature to accompany the wild, glitchy synth intrumental presented. Flume made the transition into commercial music in a big and impressive way, and this song is a good indication of that.

---
**sasuke-lp** (11): One of the best electronic songs ever, this song is fucking perfection!

**axestogrind** (10): His production and her voice work so well together. I literally have no idea what this song is about but it fucking SLAPS.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): iconic

**boogiepanda** (10): Yes

**dirdbub** (10): A few years ago, my French bf-at-the-time took me to Paris to meet his family....His mother, a haughty Parisienne who believes that her only son is GOD, and that no girl could possibly be classy enough to deserve him. Their regard is mutual - he worships her as much as she worships him. One evening after a champagne-soaked dinner, she left to go to the theater. Expecting that she'd be gone for several hours, we started having regular sex, and then anal sex, on a couch adjacent to the table at which we'd had dinner. Things kept getting hotter, and my b.f. started f*cking my ass with the slim end of a champagne bottle. This felt good at first... but then I realized that something felt off. I slowed him down in an attempt to understand what on Earth my body was doing, and I realized that my bowels were moving. And I kind of realized that it was too late to stop what was happening. At this already Godforsaken moment, we hear a key in the door and his mother pops into the room. The bitch had forgotten her shawl or something. So there I am, naked, on her couch, while her son, also naked, is holding a champagne bottle that is obviously deeply embedded in my ass. We shriek, and he yanks out the bottle. And immediately out comes a LARGE, dark brown, smelly piece of poop. It just rolls out - this felt like it was happening in slow motion, and I kept trying to stop it but I couldn't - and lands on her couch. The French boy and I broke up shortly thereafter.

**eklxtreme** (10): this is an infectious banger. tove lo and flume are two incredibly underrated musicians and i love what both of them brought to the song.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Flume is a god

**skargardin** (10): Tove sounds so fucking good on this song, she fits Flume’s production perfectly. It bangs so hard.

**SkyBlade79** (10): One of my favorite songs. As the resident Tove Lo megastan, it’s inevitable. I just love everything about this song. From the strong deliverance of the lyrics, to the vulgar lyrics, to that delicious “oh uh ohhhhh” in the drop. Even the humming is great. This production is also so delicious to listen to. If only you guys don’t rob it this time

**swankyhoodrat** (10): This song has a different vibe than Tove’s own music but she totally makes the song work for her.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The better hit female collab on Flume's Skin, Say It is a blast, with violent Flume production and one of my favorite choruses in this entire rate. The percussion is absolutely insane here! This will be robbed!

**twat\_brained** (10): Tove sounds FANTASTIC on this song! In all honestly I've only ever really enjoyed it because I'm somewhat of a Tove fan, but I fully got to appreciate it at Osheaga this year when she performed it during her set. And Flume's production brilliantly complements her soft, soulful alto here.

**kappyko** (9.5): i kinda haaaaaaaave to give this a 10 bc i selected this song lmao. but i don't abide by the rules. 9.5 sis

**DraculaWeekend** (9): This song is a bop but Numb and Getting Colder >>>

**agentofscranton** (8.5): i prefer the illenium remix honestly

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): queen of drugging muppets and king of fucking walls

**chipsi1** (8): okay now we said it

**Elitefourbrad** (8): When Tove decides not to sexually exploit herself, she can actually make good music!

**JMez2612** (8): It was a 6 until the beat kicked in, then I turned my opinion around. Then I realized the beat drop was whack so it'll stay a 6

**joshually** (8): OK until this rate, I had no idea who sang this song, but I always just randomly heard it

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Tove Lo sounds best on clashing synths, and Flume definitely plays to her strengths on this track. The production is killer, and even though Tove herself is a little more restrained then I honestly would have liked, she still sounds good.

**enecks** (7.9): A glitchy banger that kinda sounds like a spotify ad so no 8 for you sweaty

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): Production bangs but the song is kind of one dimensional

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): this will be an Australian classic in the future remind me

**sletrab07** (7.2): Not a massive Flume fan, but this is one of his best.

**banananaise** (7): as an australian who listens to triple j, i'm pretty sick of flume's sound, so i might have unfairly rated this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love the interesting noises in the production, but it’s just a tad too long and repetitive.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I love Tove Lo

**quaerex** (7): Tove’s “mmms” are a great addition to this song. But otherwise forgettable.

**rocketgamer31** (7): Tove sounds good here, and the production is pretty cool too

**stansymash** (7): wow i didn't know this song was better than the entirity of kaytranada's discography. i always thought it was just kinda middle of the road but according to popheads its better than all of them. i guess i was wrong.

**Albert\_Cole** (6.5): Don't break my bed, it would make sleeping hard

**MissyBee37** (6.5): This is the second song that's made me think I might really like Tove Lo if I listened to her more (I'm not familiar). But the chorus & bridge are a miss for me. Lyrics are great, the rest of the melody is lovely, but the chorus & instrumental bits, not so much.

**TheTimidMartian** (6.5): production and vocal processing are both good. vocals themselves are ok at best

**carliescion** (6): I like Tove's voice, but I'm not one for Flume's production

**fourchip** (6): tove my sweet u can do better

**omgcow** (6): I never knew what this song was called or who sang it but I've heard this at H&M

**shineflyer** (6): Flume's always syncopated and fun, but the tracks still a tad generic for me.

**wailordfan** (6): mmmm the rattling in the drops ruins it a bit, which is a shame given the way the verses go. The lyrics and production in the chorus just kinda ruins the song for me.

**jhxcb** (5.7): Everything seems so off.

**nooodisaster** (5): That's it?

**topesmachine** (5): this song is really basic sounding

**JustinJSrisuk** (4.3): Generic.

**zamomattel** (4): this production is generic af

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): usually i like songs from rates more after they're done! i actually like this one less now than i already did during the electronic rate!

Internet sensation Poppy is more than a weird meme. She makes some interesting, catchy synthpop and this song honestly goes hard. Her voice is robotic, but weirdly charasmatic in a way. It also compliments the production perfectly.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): WHY ARE THERE SO MANY 11S. this song also has the best couplet in history ("if money can't buy happiness/then why is it so fabulous")

**agentofscranton** (10): should've been lowlife but whatevs it's still a bop, deserved to win over carly in the ep rate

**calltehshots** (10): capitalist princess bop

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I wish I had as much Money as Poppy

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): I wish Poppy would drop the illuminati shtick and embrace her boppiness

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is a great song. The fun lyrics and the bouncy production make this song a bop!

**joshually** (10): One day on /r/popheads I was like "Who in the hayell is Poppy and why should I care about her? Give me ONE song to listen to and I will make a judgement!" Fortunately, someone immediately sent this song and I was like "WTF OMG THAT IS SO GOOD I LOVE HER!!!" but then I listened to all her other songs and I was like "Oh nm it's just this one that's really good"

**kappyko** (10): sorry but her peak is still her dark ambient album

**Leixander** (10): GIMME SUM OF THAT COLD CASSHHHH

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): poppy got 2nd last time and almost toppled the carly regime but this bop is probably going out day 1 this time around so.... imma just gonna say a little prayer while i can

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): A huge bop with catchy production and a great hook. There's also a video out there of me singing it during a podcast recording so I have to give it a high score.

**topesmachine** (10): i have such a good drag number to this in my head

**twat\_brained** (10): I do not have a wad of cash handy this time, but this will never not go off. Our YouTube Illuminati goddess **TRULY** **DID** #THAT.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Her Second Best Song Next To Lowlife

**eklxtreme** (9.5): this is such a cute song and the melody is infectious.

**shineflyer** (9.5): Ow ow ow, ow ow. Ow ow ow, ow ow ow.

**enecks** (9): OwO what's this notices that Poppy's musical quality peaked very early and it's just becoming the meme at this point

**fourchip** (9): gimme some of that cold cash! please i’m unemployed

**PendulumThief** (9): If I had to choo$e one $ong to repre$ent my life, I'd want it to be thi$

**PenOrAPencil** (9): I don’t understand the appeal of Poppy as a YouTube personality but she has bops.

**Raykel** (9): ThatPoppy > Poppy

**skargardin** (9): Infectious hook and production, one of the few Poppy songs that I can tolerate

**SkyBlade79** (9): a great critique on modern capitalism. Like, why can’t she buy a penis?? Smh communism ftw

**zamomattel** (9): I marginally prefer altar, but still, what a bop

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Cause we're all living in a material world, and Poppy is decidedly a material girl.

**awryj** (8.6): probably my favorite Poppy song

**stansymash** (8.6): this sounds like a human being pop song which was surprising

**jhxcb** (8.2): Wonderful, but tone down the vocal effects.

**axestogrind** (8): Karl Marx found dead

**boogiepanda** (8): Urghhhh can't believe this is the song from Bubblebath. Love the song apart from the last line in the chorus which is a shame because it's repeated 4 times in the song.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): “Is money can’t buy happiness then why is it so fabulous?” Wow I stan.

**skiddos** (8): i miss when her music was listenable

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Pretty good, I wish she kept this sound as I couldn't get into Poppy.Computer at all

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): ‘if money can’t buy happiness then why is it so fabulous’ is iconic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): not bad. Might check out more of her music.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): Primadonna did it first, kiiara was robbed

**followingfreeways** (7): never listened to poppy before because she creeped me out and thought it would be bad but this was surprisingly not bad

**grxmes** (7): Y'all chose this and not Lowlife??? What???

**nooodisaster** (7): Ugh there are so many bops in this rate, I feel like the "why can't I hold all these limes" guy from 999 years ago.

**swankyhoodrat** (7): A catchy lil tune

**cyborglilith** (6): ok I used to like this, but it got annoying

**DraculaWeekend** (6): Who is Poppy

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): I still don’t get Poppy

**quaerex** (6): I have never liked or understood the appeal of the Poppy character. Sure, I get it’s satire, but it doesn’t sit right with me. However, this is a good pop song. I wish she’d drop the character and rely on her talent, because she has it, obviously.

**saucymac** (6): it sounds like a boring madonna song and is kind of sad after lowlife

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I'm a way bigger fan of the EP than her album, but even then, this was one of the weaker tracks on the EP and it stands out even more against such fierce competition.

**JustinJSrisuk** (4.3): I’ve come to appreciate Poppy for what she/the project is - an interesting viral marketing campaign for an artist whose music isn’t anywhere near as intriguing as the layers of artifice and hype surrounding it.

**TheTimidMartian** (4): vocals are extremely weak, lyrics are pretty good though. overreliance on production.

**LuckyKidA** (3.7): The human embodiment of a Jigglypuff.

**carliescion** (3): I just don't get Poppy

**therokinrolla** (3): poppy? more like floppy.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): i just cant get into ha

**deadspiderwall** (1): tf?

Definitely one of the best songs on ARTPOP, this song is groovy, but fuck is it loud, and I LOVE it. The beat is stupid hard, the hook is fire, the verses are clean, it's really one of Gaga's best.

---
**awryj** (10): shoulda won

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): why is this here? this won the rate hashtag revisionist history

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): my ass is out again

**cyborglilith** (10): will get robbed again

**dirdbub** (10): /u/TheRokinRolla Sorry not sorry

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Powerbottom anthem! I listen to this whenever I have an orgy.

**grxmes** (10): Patriarchy found dead in a ditch under women.

**kappyko** (10): makes me feel like im being fed alien eggs as gaga screams obscenities and zedd takes a shit on a mixer so yea it's good

**poppinmmolly** (10): the ONLY good song on Artpop (sorry Rokin)

**skargardin** (10): It’s got an absolutely ridiculous intro, fire verses, crazy production and an insane two-part bridge, what more could you ask for? Also queen of funding her own music video. Why this wasn’t a hit is beyond me.

**SkyBlade79** (10): perfect production, great lyrics, has skydoesminecraft in the video…

**strawberryswing1** (10): I love this song, thanks theo for introducing it and Artpop to me.

**therokinrolla** (10): surprisingly not my 11. However, a crazily underrated song that has all of my support, i bopped with it from the beginning and it DESERVES to be UNROBBED in this rat

**twat\_brained** (10): "TOUCH ME TOUCH ME DON'T BE SHY!" If Lady Gaga ever asked me this I'd pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. As for the song, I love the feminist perspective the song takes on sex. [Also lmao at her explanation for the "retweet" lyric](https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/408371857536987136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgenius.com%2FLady-gaga-guy-lyrics)

**VodkaInsipido** (10): This Song Made Me Change From Being A Top To A Vers, Thank You @Ladygaga, I Still Don’t Have Sex But I Now Enjoy Desiring To Fuck And Get Fucked

**wailordfan** (10): a perfect edm pop lyrical masterpiece, except for one lyric I refuse to listen to ever and acknowledge

**zamomattel** (10): fuck it up gaga. Fuck it up

**fourchip** (9.8): grEetings,,, himeros... god of SEXual desire,,

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I apologize for doing this song a little dirty the in other rate. This is easily the best song on artpop and it’s a bop.

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): Honestly the most underrated Gaga single. I was OBSESSED with this song during the Artpop era.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): there was a time when they played this on the radio a LOT and i'd be in the car with my parents and it was SUPER uncomfortable

**banananaise** (9): once i was talking about Artpop to a non-pop-fan friend and he only recognised GUY when i mentioned the minecraft part of the music video

**calltehshots** (9): a campy fun bop and one of the good things to come from artpop :eyes:

**enecks** (9): An enjoyably unsubtle bit of bottom-core.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Honestly, easily the best song on Artpop, but it's not that hard to be the best from that :eyes:

**Kaylaboe** (9): zedd’s production is immaculate. JA, ZEDD! JA, ZEDD!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Himeros found dead

**PenOrAPencil** (9): One of the few gems of ArtFlop.

**shineflyer** (9): Zedd. It's definitely flawed, but that bass effect is so good. Nice job, Zedd.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.9): wghere is Jewels n DruGs

**quaerex** (8.5): This was Lady Gaga’s way of saying “I am not your traditional popstar” and it honestly works very well. It’s a female empowerment anthem.

**topesmachine** (8.4): the icon incarnate

**Albert\_Cole** (8.1): Yeah yeah plays with gender roles blah blah, idc. It's a bop, that's what matters

**jhxcb** (8.1): There's a 10/10 in there somewhere, I just can't find it.

**axestogrind** (8): I distinctly remember when I thought this could smash and save the ARTPOP like 'once she releases the video it's over for you hoes!!!!!!' It peaked at 78 but it's a bop so it's STILL over for you hoes.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I slept on ARTPOP but this song is a bop. The prechorus sounds a bit dated but I'm still a fan.

**nooodisaster** (8): Putting aside my feelings about the music video, this is one of ARTPOP's best. The sense of energy from the bridge leading up to that final chorus is incredible, and the lyrics are campy yet quite clever.

**rocketgamer31** (8): That instrumental tho

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): imagine how much more successful this song would have been on r/popheads if it had been called G.A.Y.

**stansymash** (7.9): is she saying guy wrong

**eklxtreme** (7): the production is so crazy and it just feels like an anthem.

**followingfreeways** (7): part of me wants to talk about how I now understand why y'all compare bad things to Artpop, but this chorus is also weirdly catchy and I hate it but also like it please help.

**LandonKidatrea** (7): This song is pretty good. How come it didn't chart like Applause did?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This may have been a valiant effort on the Artpop rate, but standing next to these other tracks it's not quite day 3 material.

**TheTimidMartian** (7): very good production and amazing prechoruses are let down by the horribly written verses. good arrangement.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): There’s just so. much. going. on. By the bridge it just becomes this messy cacophony of random sounds.

**OxfordSemicolon** (6.5): Aged much worse than most of Gaga's big hits, and I can't imagine it was ever as good as the best of them.

**carliescion** (6): Artpop Gaga is worst Gaga. The production is really bad

**MaydayPVZ** (6): Flop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Still Meh

**sletrab07** (5.6): FADGA IS OVER, AS IS THIS BOTTOM ANTHEM

**suspicious\_padding** (5.5): One of the worst and overproduced songs on Artpop.Still a bop though.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): chorus is actually terrible

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): One of the songs that's gone down in my opinion from the original rate, I don't really blame Gaga herself because she doesn't sound that bad on it, but some of the lyrics are kinda iffy and some of the creative choices just leave me wondering. The already dated blasting synth production doesn't help either.

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): lol rokin

**joshually** (1): I do not get the love for this song. It is underwhelming and subpar. Bottoms, find another anthem! There's so many better choices: Down & Dirty by Little Mix, Linger by the Cranberries, Too Far by Kylie Minogue, I mean the list goes on and on jesus

A song about assault? How could this possibly work as a radio pop tune? Never doubt The Weeknd, who came through with an MJ flavored track that's well-layered. well-produced and well-written. The build and climax to the hook is done perfectly, and his vocals are really something special (obviously)

---
**quaerex** (11): I think I once listened to this song 45 times straight. The Weeknd manages to make a song about an abused woman feel almost beautiful. His use of the word “riveting,” one of my favorite words of all time, takes this song to an 11 for me. A true masterpiece in lyricism and production.

**enecks** (10): A weird ass song. I remember doing gymnastics with this song in the background - like a gritty MA Michael Jackson song about rape. Is it good? I don't know, but it sure sticks to the mind.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): An underrated bop that got overshadowed by Can’t Feel My Face. One again, I love the MJ influence on this song, and I think this is one of his strongest songs as well.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): YES a dark pop song that has a groove even with it's dark subject matter!

**rickikardashian** (10): ...so i was listening to this song for the first time and bopping to it, and decided to look for the lyrics on genius, no lie [this was my reaction to it](https://media.tenor.com/images/9fdabd76912ac35daacdc62e6445b01e/tenor.gif). I didn’t expect this from the same guy that sings about loving cocaine more than life, i literally had to sit down and let the lyrics sink in. This was almost my 11 and like 3 of my all time favorite songs are in this rate.

**sasuke-lp** (10): amazing song

**cyborglilith** (9.5): Always the best song on the album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): ok MJ I see you.

**awryj** (9): deserved to be a hit

**axestogrind** (9): Sidenote it's a bit interesting that he can outright sing about strippers and sex and still manage to get this song to #1 on the Hot 100 while Ms. Too Vee Loo is debuting and peaking at #138. This song is a banger though.

**cadastre** (9): Recently found out what this song is about which made it a lot better for me.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Michael wannabe Snapped here.

**SkyBlade79** (9): micheal Jackson is shaken

**strawberryswing1** (9): This would've been a 10 when it came out, but now it feels like a baby to "Feel it Coming"

**swankyhoodrat** (9): One of The Weeknd’s deeper songs lyrically. I would definitely agree this one is underrated; it showcases The Weeknd’s voice beautifully.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Pretty great throwback to the 80s. Max Martin's production gets the vintage element down well, and of course Abel just slays vocally. Turning a pretty depressing or unexpected subject matter into a dance track feels very intentionally Michael-esque as well.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.9): It's good. Very good. But it's very audibly just Billie Jean with The Weeknd's generic edgy lyrics over it.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.1): Abel does a far more convincing MJ impersonation than Bruno ever could.

**twat\_brained** (8.1): Overplay of this here in Canada has made me less inviting towards it, but even then, it feels like an alternate draft of CFMF, just with a slightly lesser tempo. It's good, but Abel can do SO much better.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): YAS ABEL SNEAK INTO MY BED IN THE NIGHT

**skargardin** (8): Abel’s voice is just godly here but I can’t get over the grating chorus.

**topesmachine** (8): ok! i see what you're doing ok ya

**carliescion** (7): His voice is so smooth

**rocketgamer31** (7): One of the highlights from the album

**shineflyer** (7): I'm a fan of the end of the chorus when the vocal rhythm goes against the rest of the song.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): ugh his voice

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Honestly, this is a nice pop track, but it isn't quite as robbed as a bunch of the other tracks in the rate.

**zamomattel** (7): this is like painfully generic but it bops

**jhxcb** (6.6): Seems to try to pay tribute to some older tunes, but ends up feeling dated.

**kappyko** (6.5): Does he need a hug

**eklxtreme** (6): it's almost a michael jackson song and michael jackson is dope

**nooodisaster** (6): Feels like a classic, but a classic that i don't give a fuck about.

**TheTimidMartian** (6): i honestly forgot this song existed, which is sad given the songwriting and vocals are rather strong.

**stansymash** (5.9): ooooooh dear that chorus does not sit right

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5.5): oh yikes

**fourchip** (5): this lost half a point because i was forced to look at the album cover and see the worst hairstyle any human has ever had yet again

**suspicious\_padding** (4.3): Max Martin don’t work always 💁‍♀️.

**joshually** (4): I think The Weekdy has had better MJ knock off songs, and this is not one of them.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): isn't it

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (2): I don’t know exactly what makes this song so absolutely insufferable for me (maybe radio overplay) but I cannot stand it, it’s so grating and it gets worse with every listen.

Paramore came through on this track with a pop rock banger. Hayley Williams really brings that extra life to the track. The guitars are so crisp. Honestly it may be better than Misery Business and deserved this spot.

---
**Damoojo** (10): A bop!

**eklxtreme** (10): it’s so nostalgic and fun and just overall perfect. 2007 was a great year for music

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Hayley Williams is a queen!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Misery Business should Take this spot but still a bop.

**shineflyer** (10): an upbeat song with verses in 3/4?!? and the the chorus switches into 4/4? holy shit, my mind has always been blown by this song.

**skargardin** (10): Holy fuck this is such a throwback for me. I haven’t heard this for so long and I used to love it in middle school. Hayley’s vocals are so sweet and the riffs are nothing but iconic.

**topesmachine** (10): I love Hayley Williams so much

**jhxcb** (9.7): Paramore's best song.

**kappyko** (9.5): i dont get why ppl roasted ffourth for this choice tbh. misery business would get shit for the whore line, crushcrushcrush would prob get massacred, this song is the most poppy single by far. and that rousing vocal chorus? love love love

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9.5): hello I’m seeing Paramore perform this on the 10th feb IM SO FUCKING KEEN

**swankyhoodrat** (9): Has such a strong sing-along quality.

**WilsonJason** (9): paramore can do better

**agentofscranton** (8.5): this should've been misery business nnn

**chipsi1** (8.5): wow i never knew that letting your heart win gets you a bop i should do it more often

**fourchip** (8.5): riot! paramore still goes off like 8 years later

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): I'll be honest, I'm hipster af and didn't check out Paramore until After Laughter. But I've loved almost everything I've heard from them. AL isn't even their best album!

**LuckyKidA** (8.5): Paramore Eat World

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): This track has so much energy, still bops hard

**Leixander** (8): I love Paramore but this is not one of my favorites from them. Still an eight though. :kisskiss:

**stansymash** (8): snobs like paramore now and that includes me, /u/stansymash

**strawberryswing1** (8): Misery Business belonged in this rate more, but this song is still great

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): unfortunately, this is not misery business for some reason? i guess you could say............................... this is what we get

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): One of Paramore's best songs from their emo rock era. They've always had a talent for writing good, memorable hooks, and this is one of their best.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I've had to listen to this multiple times to make sense of this. It doesn't immediately click with me like "Misery Business", "crushcrushcrush", "Hard Times" or even "Fake Happy". That being said, "Ignorance" has a similar issue but its advantage over TWYG is its strong hard rock feel.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): So I actually discovered this song in 2016, and even without middle-school nostalgia, it snaps.

**quaerex** (7.5): Pop-rock is great. The cynicism in this song is nice. But the lyrics are a little simplistic.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): lowkey pvris vibes

**Albert\_Cole** (7): Somehow I feel like Hayley is taunting me personally

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Not my fave from Riot but still good

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It’s alright but I feel like it drags on too much (even though it’s a short song) and it feels to repetitive.

**omgcow** (7): I always liked Misery Business better but what do I know

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): It feels like something's missing before the chorus.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): An iconic Paramore track, even if it's not one of my favorites.

**axestogrind** (6.5): I never went through an emo phase so I can't hear this song

**grxmes** (6.5): Overrated

**joshually** (6): Honestly, this song could be good, but the sound of the drums bother me so much... I don't kno why

**MaydayPVZ** (6): After Laughter is so much better

**TheTimidMartian** (6): strong production is let down by poor vocals

**VodkaInsipido** (6): Eh

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): isn't it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): please stop.

**sasuke-lp** (3): never been a fan, sorry

**zamomattel** (2.5): I don’t mind them but this is pretty boring

For a song that was the punchline for a good 2 months with a ridiculous video...this song is great. The chorus and verse work together so well, Miley's vocals are lovely, the production is crisp and hasn't aged like other songs on that album. Miley did that.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): iconic af, rustled so many moms

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): even though she did not have writing credits on this song, this was pure Miley at her best. Despite being originally written with Beyoncé in mind, Miley owned this song. Her e•mo•tion-tinged delivery sealed the deal and this deserved to be her first number 1. Sucks how Dr. Luke has co-writer credits on this track, though.

**mustangs16** (10): my go-to karaoke song, ngl. it's so dramatic!!!

**nooodisaster** (10): If anyone tries to read this song, I will burn down their house and break their PlayStation. This is one of the most emotional and powerful breakup songs of all time, with Miley really putting her all into the vocals. Miley is often seen as a meme, but this song shows that underneath her oft-cringey behavior, there's a girl that loves too deeply and hurts just as deeply. The song is HUGE, with a towering chorus that only gets bigger as the song goes. Even without the MV, it's 10/10. Unironically one of the best ballads of the decade.

**skargardin** (10): A gigantic, vulnerable and overall perfect pop ballad.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I’m bitter that Miley only has one number 1 but if it couldn’t be party in the usa I’m glad its this

**VodkaInsipido** (10): THE CHORUS

**axestogrind** (9.5): As much as people hated Miley during this time I don't think anyone can say that this is a bad song. I'm happy for her now that she found love but she kinda peaked musically when her and Liam broke up :$

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): One of Miley’s best songs. You can feel her emotions through a vocals, and the power in the chorus is fantastic.

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Miley herself might regret this song, but I still love it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I would have given this a 10 if Miley hand't decided to disown her good music and start making fake deep bullshit.

**zamomattel** (9.5): definitely one of the best modern ballads

**fourchip** (9.4): well, fuck it all the way up, miley

**jhxcb** (9.1): This is Miley's best post-Hannah Montana work. I can actually hear some real emotion in this.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): This is Miley's best hit song because it utilizes her talent for POWERFUL BELTING.

**chipsi1** (8.5): honestly this isn't the song i would swing naked on a wrecking ball to but it's amazing

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): production is kinda awful but it still goes off

**joshually** (8.5): This song is sooooo goooood, you guys.

**quaerex** (8.5): “Miley can sing?” I remember my parents asking. Yes, even during Miley’s craziest era, her talent was blatantly on display. Some of the power of this song is diminished by the Younger Now fiasco, but still, this feels a lot more authentic Miley than anything else.

**SkyBlade79** (8.5): wowee this is such a beautiful sad bop

**Albert\_Cole** (8.1): I completely forgot this song existed, and it's better than I remember it. Maybe it's because I'm streaming it rather than watching the weird naked video

**saucymac** (8): OWN IT MILEY IT'S A GREAT SONG

**TheTimidMartian** (7.8): dated production and meaningless lyrics, but the vocals are very good. amazing climax after calm bridge.

**cadastre** (7.5): A more aggressive Adore You

**twat\_brained** (7.2): It's impossible to listen to this song without thinking about the music video that followed it up after, and considering it was directed by Terry Richardson doesn't make it easier to think about. My main gripe is that it doesn't feel as though Miley is pouring her entire heart and soul into the lyrics in the studio version, but when she sings it live it doesn't match up to the recording. I always found this overrated.

**awryj** (7): I haven't listened to this song in full since 2013... It still kinda sounds like it's scientifically designed for X Factor auditions but I guess it's not bad at all

**eklxtreme** (7): her vocals on this are simply wonderful

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Im really not a fan of any other Bangerz track, but this one is solid. It's got an iconic video and one of the most bombastic choruses of the last decade. The production sounds pretty odd now, but it's serviceable.

**stansymash** (6.9): nice

**suspicious\_padding** (6.7): DR LUUUUUUKE

**ComeOnAndSlang** (6.5): reminds me of Somebody That I Used to Know… a far SUPERIOR song

**Raykel** (6.5): There's something about the mixing that makes it sound empty kinda, especially in the verses. Like it sounds like it's recorded in a gigantic blank room. I can't explain it but it weirds me out.

**sasuke-lp** (6.5): good song

**swankyhoodrat** (6.5): I was never really crazy about this song. It’s just okay.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): I didn't like this song when it came out, and I think it's grown on me a bit. Compared to Dead Petz, this sounds beautiful.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): , good song, the director’s cut is the music video everybody should watch instead of the official one . Her voice is grating at times tbh.

**calltehshots** (6): a little annoying after the fact but it's still a emotional construction bop

**shineflyer** (6): The chorus synths are almost foreboding to me? Maybe I just remember the G minor effect version too well.

**topesmachine** (6): not one of Miley's all star tracks but like it's a good ballad

**DraculaWeekend** (5): No thanks

**Elitefourbrad** (5): A decent ballad that got popular because Miley sold it with sex.

**enecks** (5): Miley was never good even in this era y'all are just nostalgic because Younger Now is really bad

**triptoyourheart** (3): Where are the rules for the rate? Where does it (explicitly) state that you HAVE TO give songs a score based on how much you like it? What if you do a rate to have a certain song winning? These rules weren't clear enough.

**kappyko** (2): kinda boring music from an era that should've been radiant. kinda pretty but at what cost? "we can't stop" has always been the superior song. also i remember this rate revived my presence on the subreddit bc i was so pressed abt #GETITRIGHT losing. can we have an all stars rate next time around but with a twist where every former rate host picks one non-top 10 song from another rate to represent them like a fantasy eurovision bc if so i would totally put down #GETITRIGHT

**omgcow** (2): Vocals are too grating.

**WilsonJason** (2): deserved the hate, bad song

**rocketgamer31** (0): Came in like a wrecking ball to assault my ears. Honestly have never been able to stand Miley

This is Taylor's lyrical peak, there is absolutely no denying that. Sadly, I just can't get into this song. Sonically, it just doesn't go anywhere. I find it kind of boring, and several others did here too. Sorry Swifties!

---
**boogiepanda** (11): Taylor Swift's magnum opus. This is the song will be forever used by Swifties to argue for Taylor Swift's tear jerking storytelling in her songs. I'm actually glad that the '10 minute' version is nowhere to be found because this is 5:29 of perfection.

**deadspiderwall** (11): SO CASUALLY CRUEL IN THE NAME OF BEING HONEST :cries:

**followingfreeways** (11): this is lyrically one of her best songs, and its this song that makes me the proudest to be a fan of Taylor since her first ever single. I can't even count how many times I just laid on my bedroom floor blasting this song, feeling so many things. this song is the definition of Fall for me and I love this song more than anything

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): “MAPLE LATTE” OMG THIS SONG MAKES ME CRY EVERYTIME, PETITION TO SWEEP TAY’S APPARTMENT IN ORDER TO FIND THE FREAKING TEN MINUTE VERSION OF THIS, LIKE THIS SONG UNGHHHHHHHHHHHH, FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT SHE PERFORMED THIS @ GRAMMYS BC WE ASKED FOR IT. also: https://68.media.tumblr.com/89b6947177972977eac9fb0b6e8e6c35/tumblr_ovdg1g9WRN1u9a5dqo1_1280.jpg

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): remember when this had like a million 11s and then didnt even crack top 5

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): this is how you make a slow song… meaningful lyrics… great melodies… what’s not to like

**cyborglilith** (10): nostalgic

**Damoojo** (10): Wish it could've been my 11

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is the best song on Red for me, it’s just a heartbreaking song that I can definitely relate to All Too Well.

**JMez2612** (10): I like State of Grace SOOO much better, but I can't not give this a 10

**joshually** (10): Lyrical perfection honestly. I wish I could write as specific as she does... How's this? "I boiled water for our coffee as you printed out the recipe. We made honey barbecue porkchops and we felt so free. I thought we would be together forever, with a cute little Yorkie/Huahua mix as our ringbearer" Any good????

**Kaylaboe** (10): taylor’s peak

**LandonKidatrea** (10): This song is beautiful. Taylor Swift's songwriting may not always be on point, but when it is she writes songs like this. Fucking beautiful.

**MissyBee37** (10): This is yet another song that's painful to give anything less than eleven buuuut I only have one. This is, however, one of my all-time favorite songs. It should have won its original rate!!!!!! Just saying!!!!! Okay, got that out of my system. This is Taylor Swift at her absolute best. A total masterpiece of songwriting, storytelling, artistry and expression of human emotion.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): perfection

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Still weird how this song was the top Taylor song of the rate.

**nooodisaster** (10): Ugh, I'm trying to find something to drag about this song because the stans are too much with this and we honestly don't need 4 Taylor songs... But I can't.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Country/Rock Taylor at her absolute best.

**quaerex** (10): This is Taylor Swift at her best - where her voice and the production is simply a vehicle for the lyrics. It truly allows her strengths to shine through. Her not-quite-vague-but-not-quite-explicit songwriting means you feel not only a connection to her, but a connection to your own life. She emotes very well in this song. One of my favorites from her.

**rickikardashian** (10): Second time I didn’t give this my 11, and again, it’s hurting my soul not doing it

**shineflyer** (10): These lyrics make me cry. I don't generally pay this close attention to lyrics, and I've never even been in a relationship, but this song just makes tears well up in my eyes. So, personally, the lyrics make up for any genericness the song may have

**skargardin** (10): A staple Taylor song and what can only be said as a career highlight. Expertly crafted lyrics make it so damn emotional.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): Listening to the songwriting on this really just makes me more frustrated with the half-ass lyrics on reputation. A great mix of country and pop elements.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): will taylor ever top this song?

**triptoyourheart** (10): How Taylor went from a masterpiece like this to... Reputation is pretty sad to think about.

**jhxcb** (9.2): Let's be real, Taylor could autotune a burp, and I'd probably like it. That being said, this song is nice.

**axestogrind** (9): Every single line is SO precise that by the end you feel like you know every single aspect about her relationship and it's so touching and so sad.

**grxmes** (9): Another winner I wouldn't be mad at

**OxfordSemicolon** (9): Better than anything on Reputation (especially lyrically).

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Lyrically, this is Taylor's greatest song ever. I'm much fonder of it now than I was in the anniversary rate. The raw emotion she sings it with just drives it home even further. There's a part of me that wishes she didn't have to rely on the overused trope that is the four chords of pop just to get her point across, though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): I miss this Taylor who was actually really good at writing lyrics. The instrumental is a bit generic though but it’s a really strong song from Taylor otherwise.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Not one of my favorites from Red but it's a damn solid Taylor track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): ugh fine it's a good song whatever. (Did it really need to be that long though?)

**zamomattel** (8): I remember I didn’t get the hype on the original rate, but now I can feel that

**awryj** (7.5): kinda overrated

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): Between this and Style, Taylor just keeps advocating dangerous driving

**fourchip** (7): cute, chill, romantic bop

**eklxtreme** (6.5): it’s a well-written song with sweet vibes but it goes on for a bit too long. finnicky criticism but i would like this a lot more if it had a folk-styled strumming pattern.

**stansymash** (6.2): HOO BOY. Well this is good news. Not one, not two but FOUR taylor swift songs in a row. listening to these songs until 1am has been tough, so having some TAYLOR SWIFT songs are absolutely gonna make me feel chipper again. Thank Goodness. If anybody makes pop exciting again its gotta be taylor swift right. hecky heck. just listen to this song. isn't it just so wonderfully passable. i could listen to this a thousand times and still think its passable. very few songs are this passable. i can't wait to hear three more.

dropthehammer11: **therokinrolla** (10): for all too well i will be writing an MLA paper ahem

Therokinrolla

Professor Hammer

A Psychoanalysis of Popheads

Word Count: 1000 (exactly 1000 no joke)

For many people today a song is something that just randomly appears on the radio that can be bopped to. This is a very important aspect of music culture, and by no means am I belittling this way of partaking in music. Sometimes people just want some bops, and I without a doubt feel the same way. There is a reason that ARTPOP of all albums is my favorite album of all time. "Radio music," however, typically has a form usually applied during the creation of the song, with characteristics such as catchy, immediate hooks, and short run times. However, one of the most popular radio artists of the time released a near 6-minute arena-rock power ballad. NOT radio friendly. Naps please fuck me. All Too Well by Taylor Swift is an important moment in her career because quite simply, many critics and fans alike believe it to be the best song of her career. This is due Taylor's use of symbolism, metaphor, and imagery.
The very first verse introduces you to the setting of Ms. Swift's world she will begin creating. "I walked through the door with you, the air was cold," evokes a distinct sense of distance and isolation. However, the emotional complexity begins to unravel in the next line when Taylor contradicts herself saying, "something about it felt like home somehow." Even she cannot assure herself of the situation at hand. This "door" she has entered both feels familiar and alien.

The first major motif and symbol of this body of work is Taylor's "scarf." Taylor introduces it as still being in his drawer. Its a relatively minor thing that says a lot. A scarf is a somewhat unimportant object, yet the fact that the scarf remains in his drawer symbolizes that even he is not over Taylor. They both still have pieces of each other left in each other, and it won't simply disappear on its own.

The prechorus begins to boost the volume of the song somewhat. "And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more/ And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all," shows Taylor once again feeling disconnect with her emotions (10-11). She recognizes that this love is of time past, but she also can't seem to get past it.
The chorus swirls up into a climax rivaled by very few works. Taylor juxtaposes the tragic and desperate lyrics of the verses with nostalgic lines from the chorus, where Taylor sings, "'Cause there we are again on that little town street/You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me/Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well" (12-14). It also foreshadows the ending to this tale however. He almost ran a red light because he was looking at Taylor, which contains a possibly deadly outcome. This relationship is truly love, but it is dangerous at the same time.

The following verse creates a warm, homey scene of Taylor, her ex, and her ex's mother. "Photo album on the counter/Your cheeks were turning red/You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed/And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team/You taught me about your past thinking your future was me," shows the more delicate side of the relationship. Whereas the darker part of the relationship is highlighted throughout most of the song, here is a warm, comforting scene of family (15-19). Once again Taylor juxtaposes two defining themes that appear throughout a lot of her work: innocence, and betrayal. His past is a vision of innocence and youthful joy, whereas the future he thought he had with Taylor was of betrayal, anger, and contempt.

The second chorus swells up and introduces the bridge, quite possibly the most popular, most heart-wrenching, and most discussed section of the song. The bridge speeds up, increases the instrumental, and the relationship goes downhill. Taylor goes all in on her feelings, revealing that she believed it was a masterpiece until he, "tore it all up" (28). In addition, for the first time the refrain, "I remember it all too well," was used in a negative light. No more is she dancing in the kitchen or riding passenger seat next to him, she is running, terrified, horrified, and broken. The next quatrain is a very frequently discussed lyric simply for the power behind it: "And you call me up again just to break me like a promise/So casually cruel in the name of being honest/I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here/'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well" (30-34). Several metaphors and symbols are applied here. Taylor makes an obvious lash at her ex, remembering one of the many promises he would seemingly break. Then, there is the visual of the crumpled up piece of paper. She's frail, weak, and damaged.

The following verse talks about the scarf once again. This time Taylor specifically references innocence, saying, "'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me/You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah"(40-41). He still has the scarf, he still has the part of her, and like she to him, cannot let go of one small, leftover piece of the "masterpiece." It is the last thing he has left of her.

The outro seems to have Taylor quickly and harshly reliving all the pain, and joy in one final stanza. "Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all/Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all/It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"(46-48). A quick repetition of the "All Too Well," refrain unsheathed. The first two are repetitions of the previous refrains; the positive memories Taylor wants nothing more than to get back. The song ends with a variation, saying finally how rare it was, and how somehow she will never forget it, because she remembers it all too well.

Janet delivers a cute little bundle of 90s dancepop with Together Again. There's some obvious Euro influence here, and it's very danceable. I'm not big on Janet like the stans on this sub, but she's certainly a master of her craft.

---
**JunkyGS** (11): Originally made as a ballad about the friends she has died due to AIDS, Janet decided to make this song more up-tempo. Janet said this when asked about the song, “I don't believe in the finality of death. I wanted to write about friends who have died of AIDS, but without being mournful or sad. I wanted to celebrate their spirit. I'm pleased that Together Again is just that-a celebration, a confirmation that the energy of love will never die”. Janet had to fight incredibly hard against her label to feature this song on the album because they didn’t think it was good idea & too risky of a concept. The song features incredibly production that really captures the sound of celebrating the life of a loved one. It has this perfect balance of sweetness that heals your hurt, but still gives you a lump in your throat. It was the first song ever featured on the US Now That's What I Call Music! album series. Janet also donated the money she earned from the song to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. It is one of the best selling songs of all time world wide. <3

**nooodisaster** (11): #TEAMTOGETHERAGAIN I'm copy-pasting my write-up from last time bc I'm damn proud of i. I don't care what anyone says, this is one of the most beautiful songs of all time. This is one of the only songs I can't listen to often because I tear up every single time. The death of someone you care about is perhaps the most painful thing we can experience, and dealing with that tragedy through pure heartfelt optimism is life-affirming in the most incredible way possible. This is a song I can't help but dance to, putting a smile on my face and a tear in my eyes. As someone who is a functional atheist and can't believe in heaven for myself, I think hearing Janet sing wholeheartedly about knowing her loved one is watching her in heaven makes the message even more powerful. Even though I can't see there being a heaven, I've desperately wished there was for the sake of those I've lost, and Janet sings with such conviction that for five minutes, I wonder if there just might be. But beyond personal significance, this song's historic significance can't be understated. The inspiration behind this track stems from the friends Janet lost due to AIDs. When the track released in 1997, the AIDs crisis had just peaked, and homophobia was rampant. She had to fight with her label to get it released, let alone as a single. But the song was a huge success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 and selling over 6 million copies. In a time when gays were being told every day they were going to hell for being who they are, to hear a cultural juggernaut shout to them with assurance in the biggest song in the country "As on earth, in heaven we will be together baby" is nothing short of a revolutionary middle finger.

**awryj** (10): this song makes me happy

**calltehshots** (10): just beautiful. one of janet's best.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): a 10 again

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I listened to this song so much as a kid. Loveee

**Elitefourbrad** (10): An amazing dance hit! One of the biggest songs of that year and this is one of Janet’s best songs of her whole career. This is my favorite Janet song for a reason!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): The worst part of this week's Superbowl isn't that it's another fucking Patriots bowl, it's not Tom "I Drink 30 Glasses Of Water A Day" Brady hand-wringing about his hand, it's all the jokes at Janet Jackson's expense like that wardrobe malfunction was her fault.

**JMez2612** (10): I really want to to give this my eleven, but I can't because there's songs I like better

**joshually** (10): A true classic. I would be so lucky to die if this was my tribute.

**kappyko** (10): this song's subject matter is way too serious to joke about, so i'll just say this song is wonderful dance-pop and i hope people don't come at it for being dated bc fuck off

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Invented dance music

**PuggleMaster** (10): A FUCKING CLASSIC

**saucymac** (10): Janet has been robbed

**skargardin** (10): She manages to spread positive vibes while being emotional at the same time effortlessly. An amazing chills-inducing dance extravaganza is what it is!

**twat\_brained** (10): I am so glad to discover this went #1. "Together Again" is a rare breed of song; a) it deals with a heavy subject b) it manages to subvert the typical ballad format of a tribute song c) Janet's vocals and the overall melody make for a beautiful song when it so easily could've gone the other way. As great as "Rhythm Nation" is, I'd have to call this Janet's best song.

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.5): Velvet Rope was (and is) an oft-overlooked masterpiece, and this track is definitely one of the standouts off of that album.

**MaydayPVZ** (9.5): Janet is so underrated

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): I dig this - I normally don't like this kind of song, but Janet just sounds so happy that it took me a while to realise she's singing to a dead person. It's definitely a hell of a lot better than One Sweet Day in that respect

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Never had a song made me want to go to a roller skating rink with a disco ball in it so badly ever since I first heard Boy Problems

**omgcow** (9): Legend

**VodkaInsipido** (9): Control Is Still Better But I’ll Give You This Is An Iconic Song

**swankyhoodrat** (8): Ah so 90’s! <3

**TheTimidMartian** (8): good vocals and good lyrics and great production. her vibrato in the introduction is very pleasing, though the production there is laughable

**axestogrind** (7.5): I'm not into 80-90s pop that's actually from the 80s-90s but this hops off. janet SNATCHEDson.

**topesmachine** (7.5): a low-key bop!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Solid Janet track but it's never been one I gravitate towards. It's probably the beat (which isn't too special) that makes me feel this way.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): a seven.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): This song has dated better then other house-pop mixes from the 90s, but it was missing something for me to give it too much higher.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): it’s a nice melody and i like the vocals in the last minute of the song a lot. it just feels a little too long.

**wailordfan** (6.5): This just feels a bit generic for All Stars too. I don’t know if this is ageism or whatever, but I don’t love it.

---
The emotional climax of 808s, Street Lights is a fan favorite and deserves all the acclaim it gets. Kanye has never sounded more heartfelt and broken on a track before, as he croons his way through a soft, delicate, yet punctual beat.

---
**ComeOnAndSlang** (11): this song has gotten me through a lot of shit. Reminds me of late school nights struggling to get my projects done at 3am because I put them off until days before they were due….

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): wig

**Elitefourbrad** (10): kayne just single handedly took over the red light district with this song

**enecks** (10): 808's is the most underrated Kanye album, and this is its most heartbreaking song, and with some of the best production.

**JunkyGS** (10): One of the most under rated songs in Kanye’s discography. “The first two verses are about 'ye questioning himself and second-guessing his own feelings. To him, he feels like all these wonderful moments in his life came and went before he even had time to appreciate them. Dude is questioning whether it's normal to be this nostalgic, to think back on those moments, and whether he'll ever just live in the present and not think back on those moments that occurred over years or decades, but you only have a quick memory of them. Dude's emotional, and he wants to just escape. He has all these emotional problems, and he just wants to be somewhere else, but as he sees these lights pass him by, he thinks of all these moments that escaped him before he had the chance to appreciate them. His "destination" is a truly happy life, but there are all these memories haunting him -- reminding him. He paid his fare -- he struggled and underwent a lot of pain, that was his payment. But he still has to deal with the pain of his past before he can be truly happy -- to arrive at his destination. Child-like, he ends with 'life's just not fair.' This is self-explanatory, and you've all cried and felt this at one point.”

**Raykel** (10): The instrumentals sound like they're crying wow

**skargardin** (10): I haven’t gone through a depression so I can’t imagine how it feels but Kanye does a pretty outstanding job of tackling these issues head front here. It’s so cinematic in a sense. “Life’s just not fair” is as heavy as it gets.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): My favorite song from 808s and a top 5 Kanye song. Best listened to late at night walking or driving around a big city.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Iconic, invented driving on highway at night, invented me crying alone at 3 am, invented depression.

**theburningundead** (10): I don't listen to much by Kanye West but I really love this song, it captures a particular moment and feeling so perfectly

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Kanye and Lights. Name a more iconic duo. You can't. Can't wait for Dim Lights on Turbo Grafx 16 18.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The emotional climax of 808s, this song is just beautiful. It's beautifully produced, raw, and just heartbreaking. Every time I listen to it, I'm put right into the scene and mood Kanye builds, and the song just sells both of these throughout. I love the backing vocals, the build from the quiet beginning, and the repetition of the hook near the end. It doesn't overstay its welcome either, ending just over three minutes after it began. The last 'life's just not fair' just ruins me every time.

**zamomattel** (10): if this is chance’s favourite ye song, then same

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): daniel caesar did it better

**quaerex** (9.5): The repetitiveness works, for some strange reason. And the way the autotune fades out is brilliant.

**stansymash** (9.4): kanye is so [cute](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/kws1.gif)

**calltehshots** (9): genuinely beautiful

**eklxtreme** (9): jesus christ this is so beautiful and well-produced and well-written. i’m just not there in the streets. life’s just not fair

**OxfordSemicolon** (9): I really need to listen to more Kanye. He's not a good singer, and it shows, but the song's still great.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): As Katy Perry Once Said, Don’t Be Afraid To Catch F e e l s [2]

**wailordfan** (9): This is the Kanye production I need in this All Star rate to really set him apart song wise and as an artist. Good. I like. Yay.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.7): I’m so glad that 808s & Heartbreak is starting to get recognition for how ahead of its time it really was.

**topesmachine** (8.5): 808s is such an underrated album

**swankyhoodrat** (8.2): The only criticism I have for this song is the overuse of auto-tune.

**kappyko** (8): this song is so slow that i almost gave it a 10 bc i listened to "Paranoid" instead

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): The production here is fantastic

**twat\_brained** (8): Great beat, love the harmonies in the background and the percussion and it's an all-around great song. That is if you ignore the distorted vocoder, which I simply cannot do. If that wasn't in the song it'd be a 10 from me.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): ayee not miss me liking a kanye song. Maybe if i had more time to let htis song grow on me i would score it higher,but it’s really nice and well made and it’s just really nice and easy to listen to

**MissyBee37** (7): I'm surprised how much I like this.

**nooodisaster** (7): Wow, the production is just on the edge of greatness. It's too bad the lyrics are just sort of there.

**rocketgamer31** (7): Not bad, personally it's a little grating after a while for me though tbh

**jhxcb** (6.2): I feel like there's a lot going on and it doesn't necessarily fit together well. But there are some good parts.

**axestogrind** (6): One of the weaker tracks on 808 like if we're being real

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Since the last time I listened to this song for this rate, I think I appreciate this song more than before. I know this song really hits home for some people, but as a song in general it’s still mediocre to me. However I did give this a higher rating this time.

**joshually** (6): Remember when this album first came out, everyone was like WTF this is A W F U L... and now 90% of hip-hop out there use this "sad rapper" schtick

**shineflyer** (5.5): It's emotional, but there's better tracks that give off this kind of emotion mor effectively.

**JMez2612** (5): I know he pioneered new sounds with this album, but I don't like that sound soo.....

**TheTimidMartian** (3): lyrics are vacuous, especially for kanye, and the song features little else to redeem it. singing is awful, good thing kanye doesn't sing anymore.

George Michael is a complete legend, and this is one of his best songs. It's so grrovy and charasmatic, his breathy vocals are sexy, the hook is very catchy, it's essential 80s. Y'all young ones need to brush up on your classics.

---
**ImADudeDuh** (11): /u/leafsnash61 fucking may whatever deity you believe in bless you for putting in literally my 2 favorite songs from your rate into this rate.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): hot

**calltehshots** (10): this song just keeps me alive with the faith to survive bless it's heart

**carliescion** (10): George Michael was the original gay popstar, I have to pay tribute

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): 20GAYTEEN

**dirdbub** (10): I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of Heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I belive in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate. He suffered death and was buried, and on rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apolstolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): George at his best with the acoustic guitar, he doesn’t fall into the that trap by actually making a good song with it though.

**mustangs16** (10): I GOTTA HAVE FAITH, FAITH, FAITH, I GOT TO HAVE FAITH, FAITH, FAITH

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I think we ALL need Faith

**OxfordSemicolon** (10): Like I said the last time this was rated, I really admire this song's restraint. It doesn't need to be anything more than it is.

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Iconic

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Something I find incredibly ironic is Georgie here saying that he's ending this relationship with a supposed woman because needs "to have faith", which displays irony on TWO levels because a) he was gay and b) If he was referring to the Christian faith he was unintentionally drawing upon the book of Leviticus from the Bible. Alanis, TAKE NOTES.

**JMez2612** (9): Literally an iconic, RIP

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): That tambourine, tho.

**Kaylaboe** (9): 🤠

**rickikardashian** (9): George Michael was honestly such a gay icon

**skargardin** (9): we love a funky, sensual bop

**Albert\_Cole** (8.8): Not enough Andrew Ridgeley

**eklxtreme** (8.5): i can’t get enough of his voice, it’s so flawless and smooth

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): classic bop

**wailordfan** (8.5): Sometimes the delivery in the chorus gets kinda annoying, but so much of this song is so amazing, I think it deserves the icon status it has received by the general public and music fans in general.

**jhxcb** (8.4): This is a real jam.

**stansymash** (8.4): george had stubble with an edge

**axestogrind** (8): All negative energies in life has been dispelled… depression as a whole has been eradicated as a mental illness… he did that.

**joshually** (8): this song is pure sex without the touching... Faith basically invented VR porn

**rocketgamer31** (8): Literally had no idea this was George Michael, this is a bop

**topesmachine** (8): as a gay raised catholic, i think i'm contractually obligated to give this song an 8 at least

**awryj** (7.8): these woman legs don't make the mv for this song even a bit straighter

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.8): I feel like I learned this song in my 1st grade class

**kappyko** (7.5): /u/alternativeoxygen compared george michael's legacy to that of cyndi lauper's and honestly that comparison makes kinda sense?

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Good but Limp Bizkit outsold

**TheTimidMartian** (7.5): organ introduction is excellent, and flows seamlessly into the gracefully aged production. vocals and vocal processing have aged poorly though. vocal technique is bad but that's not why we listen to george michael

**zamomattel** (7.5): george Michael in this video is to me what shawn mendes is to you dirty twinks

**swankyhoodrat** (7): It’s fine.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): daddy

**shineflyer** (6): it's fun and punchy, but imo, nothing too special at the end of the day.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Pretty solid George Michael track but it's really not for me I don't think - not something I hate but it's not something I would listen to again.

**nooodisaster** (5): lmao, white people really do age like bread.

**fourchip** (3): i walked in on my parents having sex when i was 5 and that was a less traumatising experience than listening to this

**PendulumThief** (3): This song was ruined for me when I realised how close it was to Close to Me

**WilsonJason** (2): holy hell thats bad

**AFlyingWhale\_** (1): i enjoyed this for about 20 seconds before the pipe organ gave way to ed sheeran. also he needs to dry his mouth, he's spitting some saliva-soaked "FAITH"s

The Aussie queen is here, and this is definitely one of her best song. The silky, funky guitars mixed with the synthpop beat combine for something really pretty, and then an earworm chorus to cap off a really great pop song.

---
**awryj** (11): Mother Kylie, Aphrodite, the Golden Goddess, the Impossible Princess, Queen of High Temperature and Superluminal Travel, Inventress of Roman Numerals and Alternative-Inspired Albums Released in Mid-to-Late 1990s That Are Not Called Ray of Light, Patron Saint of Disco and Dance Pop, Ruler of the Gays; the Blesser of Europe and Australia, the Condemner of America

**agentofscranton** (10): this would've been my 11 if i'd participated in the Britney/Kylie/Madonna rate - it's just 3 minutes of pure happiness and I don't think there's anything remotely negative about it

**calltehshots** (10): a part of my soul wants to give this a low score for the britney injustice but how could i do that to this perfect 10 song? it truly was love at first sight

**chipsi1** (10): this is kinda better than can't get you out of my head

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): still beautiful and fresh

**MaydayPVZ** (10): Favorite Kylie song

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): did Kaphox pick this? If so tell him I love him!

**MissyBee37** (10): Awe, I love this song. This song was big when I was just getting into pop music (well, music, period, 'cause I was a pre-teen) and I definitely fell in love at first sight/listen. The more the percussion kicks in, the more I love it. Forever one of my fave. pop love songs.

**skargardin** (10): Pure dance pop perfection, excuse me while I head to the dancefloor.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): Pure dance pop goodness.

**twat\_brained** (10): I've only heard like 7 Kylie Minogue songs my whole life but this one's definitely my favorite of hers! The way the beat tunes out at the second verse, then takes a step back for the bridge, before going all out in the final chorus… if Kylie remains a one-hit wonder in North America (which she totally will) I wish it could've been with this song instead of "Head".

**shineflyer** (9.5): I'm not even a Kylie fan, but this song is a perfect amount of flamboyance, combined with a really nice, tense melody on the chorus. The parts where the instrumental filters in and out are really cool, too.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): this is pop perfection

**stansymash** (9.2): oh my GOD i am so glad to learn that kylie minogue has more than one song.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): There was this PS2 game I played many years ago called Summmer Heat Beach Vollyball. I don't know how I got it, since I don't particularly enjoy vollyball or girls in bikinis, and it wasn't even the 3rd best sexy beach volleyball game of 2002. But when you're a kid in the pre-Internet age, you take the entertainment you can get. It had a liscensed soundtrack like most sports games, but unlike most sports games, it did not play the soundtrack randomly, instead starting with the same song each time you played unless you specifically changed it. And that song was "Love At First Sight". It was through searching for the song years later that I became a Kylie fan.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ok my comment from Together Again but posted here too

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): One of the many breezy pop confections that planted Kylie Minogue firmly in the pantheon of gay disco icons.

**kappyko** (9): better than Call Me By Your Name or whatever that song was

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): This woman’s voice was tailor made for pop music

**Albert\_Cole** (8.9): I hate but also love but also hate these kinds of songs, the ones that convey the emotion of love vividly enough that they just make me feel lonely, because I've never experienced it myself, and I don't know if I will in the way the song describes, but it makes it sound so beautiful and I wish I could do more than sit in a corner watching other people feel these emotions, but it's just so hard and they make it sound so easy. Also the opening kind of sounds like the JonTron theme

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Makes me want to get up and dance, she's always got catchy instrumentals

**eklxtreme** (8): the production almost reminds me of daft punk. i love it.

**JMez2612** (8): I like this SOO much better than her other popular song

**suspicious\_padding** (8): Disco Bop

**topesmachine** (8): love? at first sight? it's more likely than you think

**zamomattel** (8): one of kylie’s best so im happy to see it represented in the hunger games of popheads

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): – I hate her eye makeup in this video tbh

**jhxcb** (7.3): I feel like the vocal production was not good.

**rickikardashian** (7.3): I love Kylie, but she just has like 7 different songs that sound exactly like this. They aren’t bad, but it doesn’t shock me. Also i forgot what this song was like 3 times.

**joshually** (7): The song is great, but the video is sheer choreo perfection (Dua who?)

**saucymac** (7): not kylie's best song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is a dope track but it doesn't quite catch me for some reason.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): her voice annoys me a bit but the song is okay.

**TheTimidMartian** (7): appreciable vocals and gracefully aged production. songwriting hasn't aged well unfortunately.

**wailordfan** (6.5): This doesn’t do much for me either ☹

**nooodisaster** (6): Wouldn't be in my top 10 Kylie songs.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): isn't it

**dirdbub** (5): https://letterboxd.com/milez/list/movies-where-two-characters-fall-in-love/

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): I don’t get the appeal of her.

**WilsonJason** (4): forgot she existed and want to again

**Elitefourbrad** (2): Kylie is overrated by you gays.

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): sorry kap :(

I'm not big on the Killers really, but this song is definitely one of their strongest. The guitars are driving and strong, the vocals work very well, the hook is so damn infectious.

---
**boogiepanda** (10): Flawless song. Despite being nearly 15 years old now the sound doesn't sound dated in the slightest.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I feel like this song was more popular than Mr. Brightside when it came out, and I personally think it's just as much of a classic.

**enecks** (10): A genderqueer banger we stan fuck the gender binary we got The Killers writing bangers

**omgcow** (10): Mr. Brightside's somewhat forgotten twin sister but I still love it

**quaerex** (10): “Heaven ain’t close in a place like this” – then why does this song seem positively angelic? His drawl on February makes me adore this song. I love the instrumental, too.

**strawberryswing1** (10): This song is incredible and I know y'all are gonna pay it dust smh, y'all a'int shit

**swankyhoodrat** (10): A FUCKING BOP HOW IS THIS ON THE UNDERRATED RATE

**shineflyer** (9.5): dance-rock Killers is so good and fun

**Elitefourbrad** (9): To listen to this boptastic song.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The next best song from the Killers that’s not Mr. Brightside IMO.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Just fantastic.

**nooodisaster** (9): why is this song so good? no one knows; it just is.

**jhxcb** (8.9): Very good song. Not too many complaints here. A little too repetitive.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.8): I don't get it

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Don't get me wrong, this track is one of the many things that makes *Hot Fuss* as great as it is, but it only took me until submission day to realize Brendan is singing "heaven ain't close in a place like this". Even "When You Were Young" tops this.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): this takes me back to 2005 when I went overseas for the first time and travelled through England

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.1): A classic that’s full of nervous energy.

**axestogrind** (8): What does the boyfriend lyric mean??? straight people voice Is she... you know... [nudge] you know... Is she...?

**eklxtreme** (8): it’s so anthemic and catchy. great instrumentation and melodies.

**kappyko** (8): Who fucking counts "The" when sorting things alphabetically

**Raykel** (8): This is better than Mr. Brightside tbh. It takes the the best part of that song (the verses obvi) and makes it its main hook.

**rocketgamer31** (8): Still holds up after all these years

**stansymash** (8): i am glad i didnt have to hear mr brightside for the quadrillionth time in my life

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This wasn't robbed one bit but I'm still bopping.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): The hook and the bridge are very nice, but the lyrics are quite underwhelming.

**joshually** (7): I really liked this song when it first came out, but for some reason... I don't feel like it aged well???

**skargardin** (7): I’ve always felt that this one was a bit overrated. The verses are far superior to the chorus, where it kind of falls flat.

**zamomattel** (7): the first time I heard this song was on strictly come dancing

**sasuke-lp** (6): I really like the chorus

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): Meh

**fourchip** (4.7): the killers aren’t that great even when they’re not pumping out weaker follow-ups to mr brightside than the track itself, don’t @ me

**SkyBlade79** (4): this is such an edgefest but kind of a bop? Like not much, but kinda?

**TheTimidMartian** (4): it sounds like he's singing through a toilet paper tube

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): isn't it

**AFlyingWhale\_** (2): is this transphobic

**Leixander** (1): The Killers? More like they killed my interest in rock music thank you.

This fuckin song man. A trap flavored, dark, abrasive R&B track going Diamond? How could this be? The Weeknd absolutely killed this song with one of the best hooks of the decade and a beat that makes me go nuts 3 years later. Easily one of his best songs and one of the best songs of the decade period.

---
**boogiepanda** (10): The trap influence is so clear and worked in so well

**calltehshots** (10): remember when this song came out and knocked everyone on their wigs? the hills do have :eyes:

**dirdbub** (10): *hits Juul* Guys, I do drugs.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I love how dark this is. Probably one of the first Weeknd songs I was actually excited about since his mixtapes.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Listening to this with headphones on is an experience I will never get old doing.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Okay first of all, why is the clean version of this song on the Apple playlist????? SMH truly trying to sabotage this rate.. jk. Now for the actual review, this is one of my favourite songs by The Weeknd. That bass line is iconic and it bumps anywhere buy Anywhere by Rita Ora on iTunes and everywhere. And I love the the passion and intensity in the chorus.

**omgcow** (10): This song feels so creepy and sexy at the same time and I love it

**sasuke-lp** (10): One of my favorite The Weeknd songs. the production is fucking awesome, especially that huge bass on the chorus!

**shineflyer** (10): (SCREAM) i only call you when it's (DROWNING BASS)

**skargardin** (10): How was this dark as fuck song a hit? It’s probably my favorite The Weeknd track but still it’s so damn unconventional for the radio. The beat drop never fails to impress.

**SkyBlade79** (10): what a great song. Really captures that dark vibe exactly how it’s meant to.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Perfection. I discovered the Weeknd before Kissland, and I fell in love with his music becasue I felt like he was able to make music in a way that he understood how I felt at a time where I was really depressed and didn't feel understood by anybody. The Hills was released when I was going through a really rough time and I had this song on repeat, it really helped me feel less alone.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): This song plays to all of The Weeknd’s strength and has such a strong replay value.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Finding myself a little disappointed with The Weeknd's output since Echoes of Silence, I silently waited for a track to catch me, and that's when he dropped The Hills. Upon my first listen, I was absolutely confident this wasn't a hit - it's abrasive, with literal screaming present in the track, and while the drop and chorus are absolute catharsis, they're not exactly radio friendly. But Abel did that. He made this song get to #1. And then he blocked Drake. Truly inspirational. This track is fucking flames and by far the best song on this otherwise middling album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ban u/Nerdy_boy_chris

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Just a fantastic song all-around. Illangelo's production is building, epic, moody, even eerie. The song turns a hookup into a horror movie, making Abel almost into a monster. The hook is just killer, catchy and enormous. The lyrics are Trilogy-style, both despicable and depressing and weirdly relatable. It's appropriate that one of Abel's first number one hits was a nice lookback at the sounds that got him there before he went for the title of biggest pop star in the world.

**twat\_brained** (10): This song, Love Me Harder and Starboy are truly Abel at his very best. The dark, brooding production combined with his INCREDIBLY emotive vocals make for a great listening experience and a well-deserved #1 hit.

**joshually** (9): This song is so dark & sexy... like me with the lights off (I promise)

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Oh yes we love an emo violent drug infused dark moody Halloween BANGER

**quaerex** (9): The production on this is truly amazing. This is a time when those autotuned vocals actually add something to the song. And Abel’s non-apology for his inability to commit makes you love him just a little bit more. At least he’s honest, right?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): look not going to lie I really want to fuck the Weeknd (I have a ‘babyface’ like selena does this mean I’m in????)

**kappyko** (8.9): i love this song but how the fuck did it get voted in over fergalicious

**followingfreeways** (8.5): ppl might think im trash for bopping to this song. whatever. I accept my fate. im a trash.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): This song sounds amazing with a good stereo

**awryj** (8): this song sounds like a headache so I guess it succeeded in what it wanted to achieve

**carliescion** (8): The intro is iconic

**nooodisaster** (8): This is the epitome of whiny edgelord str8boy pop, but god damn if it isn't catchy as fuck.

**rickikardashian** (8): I love _The Sound of Music_

**zamomattel** (8): (feat. Heidi Montag)

**TheTimidMartian** (7.8): much stronger track, even if the vocals aren't as good.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): Half past five in the morning? That's stupid, I have to get up in a few hours. Half past five in the afternoon? That's a really weird time for sex. Also why does this song have so many spooky noises

**eklxtreme** (7): this is great ONLY for that huge drop. if this song was only the drop i’d love it, but the rest of it is just anticipation for the chorus.

**enecks** (7): Edge

**stansymash** (6.9): i dont like this boy very much

**cadastre** (5): I love the chorus + bridge but the verses on this song are hot fucking garbage

**fourchip** (5): the hills are alive with the sound of music! alas, for it is mediocre

**WilsonJason** (4): overrated

**suspicious\_padding** (3.5): T R A S H

**OxfordSemicolon** (3): Bad use of Autotune.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): isn't it

**jhxcb** (0): I can't find very redeeming qualities about this song, to be honest.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): Sucked in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, And will probably suck until the end of time. And y’all can fight me on this.

As the opener to Red, this song set the tone of the album well. It was a great showcase for Taylor's vocals and the pop-country route she was taking. The writing is sharp, all in all it's a solid song (I don't care for it much, sadly).

---
**OxfordSemicolon** (11): Better than anything on Reputation. It just sounds beautiful.

**therokinrolla** (11): well there is the eleven. "But rokin," you scream from afar, "GUY was robbed!" Yes it was anonymous fan, however, there is something undeniably brilliant in the atmosphere of this song. The lyrics are brilliant in this song. Its incredible in that it is such a simple song about love yet it evokes so much. The guitar. The bombastic chorus. The prechorus that naturally slides in before the second chorus, creating a one-two knockout of climaxes, the slowdown of the bridge, just to bust open again for one last hurrah. A song that leaves me speechless, emotional, and in love. With what? Just everything. A song I know I can listen to and instantly feel better no matter the circumstance, and my second favorite song I've ever listened to. No matter where the hell taylor decides to make a mess in the future, her magnum opus is right here and i will hug it and keep it fore

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): “I LOVE YOU DOESN’T COUNT AFTER A GOODBYE” oh my lord, this song, this is my favourite song ever, I’m not kidding, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE, A PROPER SINGLE. “SO YOU WERE NEVER A SAINT AND I’VE LOVED IN SHADES OF WRONG WE LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE PAIN MOSAIC BROKEN HEARTS” OMG I’M DEAD RIP ME THIS LINE KILLS ME EVERYTIME OMG TAYLOR OMG DEAD DED RIP RIP DEAD. and yeah i'm copying my comments from each rate cause original content is boring

**boogiepanda** (10): Taylor Swift's best album opener out of any album (Mine is a close second). Perfectly placed to introduce the album as how to what love is to Taylor.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): still her best opener and completely shits all over repotato despite not even being the best song on Red

**cyborglilith** (10): It’s soooooo fresh, like a new beginning, even though I already heard it.

**Damoojo** (10): Wish this could've been my 11 too :(

**deadspiderwall** (10): Flawless. Perfect. Top 5 Red.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): One of the best songs Taylor has ever done for sure! A great choice to open up the album, with Taylor’s custom flare.

**kappyko** (10): best song by taylor lollllllllllllllllll sorry bout it

**Kaylaboe** (10): taylor’s peak

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song is still great.

**nooodisaster** (10): So every 11 I've given is included in this rate, which is making this really awkward to choose one this time. Taste squad? Anyway, copying my original text b/c it was also gr9: This is how you take lyrics that are intensely personal and make them sound like an anthem. It doesn't just sound like her relationship, it sounds like all my relationships, and most importantly what I want my future relationships to be. I can't listen to this without feeling pumped up and affirmed, not just for love, but for life. This is a worthwhile fight.

**Raykel** (10): This sonically sounds as hopeful as the lyrics do. I never heard a song sound so...in love. Taylor at her best imo.

**rickikardashian** (10): I’m just sitting patiently for Taylor to decide to make an entire album like this so I can die at peace, knowing that I’ll never peak highker in my stan life.

**skargardin** (10): There’s a certain rawness to Red (the album) that shows so well in State of Grace. It’s so anthemic and epic. It feels like the perfect way to open up the album with but it could also work as the closer.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I regret giving this score below a 10 every day of my life, it hit me a few days after the rate and I apologize everyone.

**twat\_brained** (10): This was my favorite song on Red when I heard it for the anniversary rate, an opinion I know is now justified by it being the highest-ranked song from the album. It's biggest strength, IMO is its pacing.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): I Love You Taylor

**WilsonJason** (10): best song on red

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): I really didn't like Red the first time I listened to it, and while most songs are still lackluster for me, this song grew on me a lot! I found myself going back to it a lot. I think it could be cut by like 30 seconds but it's really great.

**jhxcb** (9.1): I like it, although I think it could be toned down a little. I think it's a little too upbeat, for this song at least.

**carliescion** (9): The acoustic of this is an eleven 🤷🏻‍♂️

**mustangs16** (9): my second favorite post-country taylor song. it's just so good.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): God knows I’m far from a swiftie but dammit I’m a sucker for Red era Taylor. These lyrics are just so strong.

**PenOrAPencil** (9): Taylor meets U2. If her music were to veer towards this style I would actually consider stanning her.

**quaerex** (8.5): This is what Reputation should have been. Pop-rock suits Taylor quite well. The fact we got State of Grace and All Too Well on the same album means Red is the greatest, no questions asked.

**swankyhoodrat** (8.5): Showcases Taylor’s voice well.

**awryj** (8): I gave it a 5 or sth like that in the rate and I think I kinda regret it. It's not a masterpiece (as lots of Swifties claim) but it's definitely good. The "four blue eyes" part and the part afterwards is so satisfying.

**calltehshots** (8): ok this song slaps taylor did that

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): one of my favourite album openers

**stansymash** (7.1): wow this one is even more passable than the last

**shineflyer** (6.8): a kinda generic Taylor track

**chipsi1** (6.5): why do Taylor stans like this so much this isn't even one of the better songs on red

**fourchip** (6.5): nice guitar riff, not much else besides good lyrics

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): it's meh but god it's so much better than the edgy shit she's trying to pull now ewwwww.

**suspicious\_padding** (6.2): One of Taylor’s best.

**rocketgamer31** (6): Really not a fan of this

**eklxtreme** (5.5): the constant driving pop-rock rhythm kinda drags down the good parts of the song, but it has a good melody otherwise.

**cadastre** (5): More like State of Nothx amirite

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): overrated af, acoustic version is better

**joshually** (5): I've heard worse from Taylor, but I've also heard better, so... it's very middle for me, like the lucky chosen one in a threesome.

**topesmachine** (5): I don't like red and i will die on this hill

**zamomattel** (5): why is this even here, curiosity should be the other song from this rate

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): this song is gonna make day 2 for some godforsaken reason

**SkyBlade79** (4): not sure why this is so overrated… can’t wait to be torn apart for this low score tho

**TheTimidMartian** (3): poor vocals. songwriting is still awkward.

**JunkyGS** (0): Nothing about this song is graceful. It has aged worse then most presidents. The production is droning, her vocals are pitched and strained and thematically / lyric wise it is just eye roll inducing. Having this song surrounded by so many legendary and influential songs makes it stick out even more and highlight its short comings.

One of Coldplay's signature songs, this heart-felt piano ballad has captured the hearts and minds of fans and haters alike from all over the world. It's soulful, beautiful, lyrically poetic, and just a masterpiece of a track. Definitely one of Coldplay's best.

---
**sletrab07** (11): Nobody said it was easy, but it wasn't difficult to give this my 11.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): fuck you glee

**boogiepanda** (10): I love a slow bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): still so beautiful

**Damoojo** (10): This song still makes me want to cry my eyes out!

**dirdbub** (10): Okay actually serious comment, I cried to this song several times over the years as it is a key depression anthem for me. This will also rip me apart in the coming months. :n

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Nooobody saaaiiiid it was eeeeeasy

**followingfreeways** (10): Coldplay has such a deep place in my heart, especially this song, however I feel like I only listen to this song when I am sad so now I am getting sad listening to it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Not looking forward to when many people trash this song because it’s from “the boring and snooze inducing band Coldplay”, when most this rate is filled with bops. This is a beautiful song and easily one of their best ones (still think Clocks should have been chosen over this though because it’s my favorite).

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a heart breaking song. :sad:

**JMez2612** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG IT ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY

**Leixander** (10): This song deserved way better. Deserved to be #1 of that rate instead of that trash of a song called Mr.Brightside. /s?nahnotreallybutdonotdragmeberothanks

**MissyBee37** (10): I have never in a rate wanted so badly to have more than one eleven. This song is soul-crushing perfection. Hearing it, I can still feel the worst summer of my life as if it were enveloping me all over again. I remember vividly lying around my apartment, alone, listening to this on repeat to survive a terribly dark place. Music is truly that magic that fills the gaps where all other communication fails. That haunting, pounding piano... the way the drums build in, then the layer of the guitar. The lyrics are beautiful. I genuinely believe this is one of the best songs ever written. Eleven/ten if I could... Ten because the optimistic side of my heart lies elsewhere in this rate.

**skargardin** (10): It just builds and builds to create something magical. One of Coldplay’s best song by far

**strawberryswing1** (10): I'm just go ahead and say y'all ain't shit for letting this go out on day 1. This song is beautiful.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): A beautiful, emotive song that I’m glad had such success in with the GP.

**theburningundead** (10): I cried when they covered this on Glee

**WilsonJason** (10): coldplays finest

**kappyko** (9.8): what can i say, we love a ballad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): robbed in the original rate and I just know it's gonna get robbed even worse in this one.

**fourchip** (9.1): a staple in any sad songs playlist

**banananaise** (9): me when i die in a video game: no one said it would be easy, no one said it would be this hard, i'm going back to the start

**carliescion** (9): The best song Glee ever covered

**deadspiderwall** (9): cry evrytime

**enecks** (9): An undeniably tragic gutpunch of a song. Remember when Coldplay had tracks like this and weren't the kind of people that'd collab with The Chainsmokers?

**stansymash** (8.6): chris martin is one of those people that gives me a feelings soup of uncomfortableness dislikeness and worry, but on this song he's actually endearing.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): it’s quite beautiful when it’s just stripped down to that sweet melody

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): :emofish:

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Coldplay makes me snooze off all the time, they’re the male Lana Del Rey.

**joshually** (8): A beautiful song full of melancholy and romance... like a beautiful handblown glass swan

**quaerex** (8): Vintage Coldplay is a great trip. Falsetto is beautiful.

**Raykel** (8): This song is so weird. I'm either obsessed with it or I'm completely bored of it. It got lucky this time around.

**shineflyer** (8): It's an emotional, genuine song, even if it could be considered a bit basic rock.

**SkyBlade79** (8): ah this is so sad ☹ my first time hearing it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Still not one of my favorite Coldplay tracks, but it's really solid and has a great buildup. Was Coldplay robbed in that rate? Yes. Did Mr. Brightside deserve to bulldoze it's way through every other song? Also yes.

**axestogrind** (7.5): [Bridge: Chris Martin] I want something just like this / Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-do / Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo / Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo / Oh, I want something just like this / Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo / Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo / Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo [Chorus: Chris Martin] Oh, I want something just like this / I want something just like this

**calltehshots** (7.5): i always found this song super pretentious growing up but it's a decent listen cause like no one did say it was easy? tea chris martin

**wailordfan** (7.5): I wanna drag his pitchy voice, but the outro is one of the best damn things ever.

**suspicious\_padding** (7.3): I never heard this Radiohead tribute band before 🤔.

**jhxcb** (7.2): Songwriting wise, I love this, but the actual recording is kind of bad.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): I know this song more well than I should; I've played it on SingStar like 15 times. That means I see the video loads. And normally I try to keep songs separate from their respective videos, but the fact that Chris Martin lipsyncs the song in reverse gets a bonus point from me. I'm removing 2.6 points, however, because there is far too much instrumental interlude for my liking, to the point where you could remove a whole minute from the song, as well as another 1.3 because at some point it feels less like a soft rock ballad and more of a lullaby. If I wanted to sleep I'd listen just listen to the day 1 eliminations from the SOTY rate.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): Can't vibe with the anti-atheist lyrics, sadly

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Still pretty damn good.

**rickikardashian** (7): tbh my score was just out because I know in like a week I'd have felt bad about giving it the 5.6 I was planning. I have a weird relationship with this song, because sometimes I just love it entirely, I gave it a 10 last rate, but sometimes I just don't want to listen to it. That kind of sums up my experience with Coldplay tbh

**rocketgamer31** (7): The lyric "No one ever said it would be this hard" is about me attempting to pick an 11 for this rate

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): Early ballad-heavy Coldplay has always kind of put me to sleep (I've always liked the Viva La Vida era the most) and while there isn't really much wrong with this song, it's just kind of sad to listen to. It feels like a funeral.

**VodkaInsipido** (7): An Overrated Song

**chipsi1** (6): why is this 5 minutes long

**nooodisaster** (6): I used to respect Coldplay, and then they collab'd with The Chainsmokers.

**omgcow** (6): in high school english class I did a project about The Time Traveler's Wife and set it to this song and I got a C so fuck that

**grxmes** (5.6): Underrated and depressing

**OxfordSemicolon** (5.5): The first time I listened to this I tried to score it after an ad played and couldn't remember the song.

**blue\_heart\_** (5): Boring

**TheTimidMartian** (5): simple but effective melody and production. lyrics are forgettable.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): This is the most overrated song by Overrateplay

**sasuke-lp** (4): boring

**zamomattel** (4): the first male song in the playlist, I am disappointed there are any

**Albert\_Cole** (3.5): If they played this song during exams, maybe I'd get better grades, because Coldplay somehow has the ability to turn five minutes into three hours

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): I’m sure that overplay contributes to my low score, but I’m sorry I just can’t with this song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): no

**topesmachine** (0): omg Chris Martin shut the fuck up

This sister group has become quite popular amongst pop rock fans over the past few years. Their strengths are making stupidly catchy guitar riffs, coupled with great harmonizing by all 3 girls, and you have a recipe for success.

---
**MaydayPVZ** (11): One of my favorite songs ever, it always reminds me of the summer

**WilsonJason** (11): yeet

**agentofscranton** (10): i'm still bitter that i never managed to finish my submission for the ariel rate

**berober04** (10): I love this song. Just a tightly made song, with real instruments!!1!

**calltehshots** (10): a BOP hanson killed this

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): sister sister sister tour tickets on-sale now

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Not a big fan of Haim, but if I give this song less than a 10, i'd be lying to myself.

**kappyko** (10): ok i love HAIM and i feel this song was unfairly robbed and it would've won if EIE wasn't in the rate which tbh i have qualms abt still lol. this is pop rock perfection and catchy as fuck and i don't wanna have to justify myself ok? the strings at the end? harmonies? i'm feeling this song so much. never mind i gotta give kaytranada my 11 lol

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I would have wished “If I Could Change Your Mind” was in this rate instead, but this is a bop as well

**mustangs16** (10): it's so chill and pretty and i love it

**stansymash** (10): i think this might just be the best pop rock emphasis-on-the-popsong of this decade

**awryj** (9): ok I really need to listen to HAIM more. I've liked pretty much every song of theirs I listened to.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): The shade on this track is so real like oh my god. HAIM are literal queens, don’t underestimate them!

**twat\_brained** (8.9): …why does this sound so much like "Olivia" by One Direction? I'm checking the credits and there are different writers listed for each song. Well, I suppose I never enjoyed "Olivia" much but this one gets more points from me for the stellar hooks, as well as the fantastic guitar solos on it. And that ending! This is easily in HAIM's top 5 along with "Want You Back" and "If I Could Change Your Mind".

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.2): Really holds up.

**suspicious\_padding** (8.2): There is better HAIM songs but this is good as well.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8.1): hey that’s pretty good !

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): HAIM YOU USED TO HAVE DIVERSITY WHAT HAPPENED

**cadastre** (8): HAIM should’ve stopped at one album tbh

**rickikardashian** (8): This is the kind of song where the verses are just so much better than the rest of the song. The way they narrate it it’s just inviting into the story.

**shineflyer** (8): A real ROCK song. This gives off the mood of power-walking.

**swankyhoodrat** (8): Nice when I listen to it but I don’t see myself coming back to it.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): this song on the radio got me through my kfc shifts in 2013

**Albert\_Cole** (7.9): I can't relate, I never go far enough to get the chance to fumble it

**jhxcb** (7.9): Cool is a good way to describe this. Not life-changing. Cool.

**fourchip** (7.5): groovy

**JMez2612** (7.5): Ehhhh, its cute, not my thing though

**zamomattel** (7.5): I think in their rate I gave this an 11 lmao

**carliescion** (7): HAIM's best song

**eklxtreme** (7): the live version is infinitely better but this still a fun song

**enecks** (7): Kanye outwigged

**joshually** (7): There's just something so unabashedly white about HAIM that brings my inner white girl out and makes me want to press autumn leaves between the pages of my scrapbook!!!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This is ok, but I don’t really get the appeal

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Alright, she’s cute

**sasuke-lp** (7): not bad, I like it

**skargardin** (7): I’ve never really gotten into HAIM and this song in particular. The verses are a drag to get through and the chorus is not much better. The guitars are nice but the drums get so repetitive for me.

**topesmachine** (7): every time i hear this song i lip sync it with major bass face

**wailordfan** (7): It’s cute, but just feels a bit generic for All Stars. Parts of it is really great, other parts are a bit just lackluster, such as the verses, but the chorus just fucks me up a bit.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): I've been trying to like HAIM but they just make such average music? Like there's nothing wrong with it but it just doesn't stand out at all. Idk anyway that's how I feel about this song.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): Feels very late 70s stylistically, but I found it kind of sonically uninteresting. This is my first real experience with HAIM, but nothing really stuck out to me as very good or bad.

**quaerex** (6): It sounds like they’re whispering the verses of this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Still isn't my favorite HAIM song, definitely think there's better on Days Are Gone

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): isn't it

**nooodisaster** (5): I kept waiting for it to hit...

**rocketgamer31** (5): Kind of indifferent to this tbh

**TheTimidMartian** (5): lyrics are unremarkable and the vocals are ok at best. the production is overbearing

**dirdbub** (3): Is this a mediocre Joanne reject

**omgcow** (3): Too "I'm at an Urban Outfitters picking out a crop top for the kickback this weekend" for my tastes

This is a catchy pop tune, produced well and all that. I'm still just a bit lost on why this song is so acclaimed? I feel like other songs on 1989 were more polished and structured and well written. Doesn't matter though, y'all loved it and it shows.

---
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): This probably won't reach the top 10 ever which sucks because this is honestly the best song on 1989.

**agentofscranton** (10): i'm honestly confused how this didn't land in at least the top 20 of the OG rate

**awryj** (10): lowkey the biggest bop from 1989

**axestogrind** (10): There's literally nothing wrong with this song except the fact that Hitlor Swift didn't give it a proper music video. I think that alone confirms that she hates gay people, and thus is a republican, so idk why people are still on this 'Taylor isn't political!!!!' debate.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): a niiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee songgggggggggggggggggggggggg

**boogiepanda** (10): The stadium anthem from 1989. The chorus is so energetic and upbeat it makes you want to scream, shout and dance to it.

**cyborglilith** (10): B O P

**followingfreeways** (10): this should NOT have been a deluxe track and I will fight anyone who thinks otherwise

**fourchip** (10): another solid pop bop from tay

**gannade** (10): Taylor's best song

**JMez2612** (10): Queen of having free people in her life

**Leixander** (10): THE BEST PEOPLE IN LIFE ARE FREEEEEEEEEEEE

**LuckyKidA** (10): She struck gold here. Why doesn't Swifty write more songs like this?

**MissyBee37** (10): It is such a shame this isn't a standard album track. I still think it's a better name for the whole album than "1989." This is one of the smartest songs Taylor's ever written. It's so relevant and real. And just fun!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): underrated.

**OxfordSemicolon** (10): Better than anything on Reputation. The "ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah" may be the best 2 seconds of anything Taylor has ever done.

**rickikardashian** (10): something something tour videos sucks

**skargardin** (10): What a perfect, dreamy pop song.

**SkyBlade79** (10): one of taylor’s best imo, and tied with wildest dreams on 1989. Just pop perfection.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Perfect pop tbh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song deserved so much better, I wasn't even a fan of pop at the time and I could tell the New Romantics video was a massive letdown.

**theburningundead** (10): I'm not the biggest fan of Taylor Swift but even I can't avoid loving this song, I still can't believe it was only a bonus track when it's better than almost everything else on 1989

**twat\_brained** (10): This is everything I want from an album closer. It's bright, it's cheery, it's explosive and it's fun! Lyrically, it's quite similar to "22" for me, but it doesn't feel like Taylor trying too hard or trying to be anything she isn't. I just wish this could've charted higher.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): I Love You Taylor [2]

**jhxcb** (9.7): This 100% deserved to be an album track. Travesty.

**therokinrolla** (9.5): a bop that will get robbed

**zamomattel** (9.5): im glad I didn’t do this rate because a year and a half ago I didn’t appreciate this gem

**calltehshots** (9): this song slaps too taylor sucks teeth

**enecks** (9): I miss this taylor. The Old Taylor's brutal murder is the pop tragedy of our times.

**quaerex** (9): Why she didn’t release this instead of Bad Blood, I’ll never know. It continues the satirical persona from Blank Space quite well. The bitter sarcasm in her voice makes this song fun to smize to.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): I don't believe Taylor is actually this cool irl

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): i've fallen out of love with this a bit tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I really love the verses on this song, and the chorus is pretty good. However I hate the a-a-ahhh before the chorus it’s so nasally and annoying sounding. It doesn’t take away from the rest of the song, which is a bop.

**swankyhoodrat** (8.5): Still don’t get why this wasn’t on the regular edition of 1989. It’s definitely one of the stronger tracks.

**stansymash** (8.2): honestly as these songs go by i like taylor swift more and more which makes me seem like quite the fool

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.1): Hopefully someone can perform a voodoo ritual to raise “Old Taylor” back from the dead so that she can write songs like New Romantics again.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Taylor, why did you make this the tour footage music video? WHHHHHHHHHHHY

**kappyko** (8): i hate that i really really like this

**nooodisaster** (8): me thinking this song is so overrated by swifties but still unable to deny the pure bop-ness: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/meleehell/images/f/f3/Smash_spank_it_once.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150504055724

**Raykel** (8): This song is more fitting now than at the time lol

**shineflyer** (8): Taylor's lower range is fun to hear in this context.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): a bop !

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): – tbh not as good as blank space and style for me

**MaydayPVZ** (7): This song is okay, I don't get the love for it

**rocketgamer31** (7): Chorus is catchy

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): i’ve seen people claim that 1989 would be an even bigger era if this was released as one the first singles and everytime i choke on my tea. chorus is bliss tho

**DraculaWeekend** (6): This beat was wasted on Taylor. CRJ would have done it justice.

**suspicious\_padding** (5): 80’s are here woooo!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): no.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): Probably one of the only songs on 1989 I could listen to without an issue, but still not a huge fan. The synthy production is solid.

**letsallpoo** (4): Taylor's singing is awkward, the lyrics are clunky, the production is pleasant but generic. It's not the best failed single off the album (OOTW says hi) or even the best bonus track ("Wonderland" says hi). I didn't choose this for a reason!!!!

**mustangs16** (4): listen...why are both the songs of 1989 in this rate some of the more awful ones??

**skiddos** (3): why the fuck does she have 4 songs in this yet carly and lorde have 0 ctfu what’s good popheads

**joshually** (2): I don't get the love for this song tbh... it's not that great

**TheTimidMartian** (2): honestly weak af.

**dirdbub** (0): The fact that y’all try and push this as a good single choice really says more about the sub’s general lack of taste than anything else.

**eklxtreme** (0): i just REALLY don’t get why everyone loves this song so much. the lyrics are pretty dumb and it’s pretty much new americana on some 1989 synths.

**Mudkip1** (0): wow a terrible choice for an all stars pick

This would have been my 11 if Kanye wasn't in this rate. This song is a damn masterpiece. Jamie xx delivers absolutely incredible, intoxicating production. Drake sounds tender, genuinely heartfelt with pleas, and Rihanna sounds gorgeous. One of Drake's best and just absolutely perfect.

---
**Elitefourbrad** (11): Drake’s best song, so many melodramatic emotions in this along with Rihanna’s toned down approach make this my 11.

**calltehshots** (10): im so sad im giving something else an 11 but this is a MASTERPIECE. drake and rihanna at their best.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): i remember being in middle school listening to this absolute blassic

**dirdbub** (10): The man who wrote fairly poignant depression lyrics like "Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to / 'Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you" has also written memes like "She say, 'Do you love me?' / I tell her, 'Only partly. I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry'" and I think that's beautiful.

**fourchip** (10): rihanna gives to charity by featuring on a track some babyface wannabe rappermade, giving it widespread success

**Kaylaboe** (10): i was honestly shook when i first heard jamie xx produced this but it makes so much sense

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I’m honestly still upset it didn’t win any rate. And it won’t win this one either.

**nooncrawler** (10): The best Drake and Rihanna collab.

**shineflyer** (10): I love an upbeat sad song. The piano's so hollow, and when Rihanna says "lost" the instrumental reflects the feeling exactly, with ethereal guitar replacing the drums which could originally distract from the pain the song can give off.

**strawberryswing1** (10): This sub needs to put RESPECK on Drake's name!!!!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a timeless, legendary, sexy collaboration that will most likely go out early in day 3.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Drake and Rih's best collab. Jamie xx's production is stunning, the two singers are able to get a lot of real feelings, emotions, chemistry and heartbreak into their delivery, and both Drake and Rih just kill it vocally. It's a beautiful pop song.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): A Robbed Song

**DrunkHurricane** (9.5): would be a 10 if not for that weird sample

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): Jamie xx >>>>>>>>>> every single other producer out there, fight me. AND it’s Drake and Rihanna, the chemistry is off the charts.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): I knew a couple whose relationship reminded me of this song. They broke up. Song's nice tho

**enecks** (9): This is a cultural event. Drake at his peak playing off Rihanna's charisma and an all-time great beat. It's a song that's whatever you want it to be - a punchy banger, an emotional reflection, a desperate confrontation, a chill vibe song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a drake song that's good? What is this? the early 2010's?

**quaerex** (9): Much like Drake and Rihanna’s relationship, this track is timeless. Drake is at his best here, Rihanna’s more stripped back performance compliments his voice perfectly.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): honestly these two can do no wrong together

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Drake and Rihanna are the most iconic pop-rap duo, and this song is proof why. Armed with a fire Jamie XX sample, quite possibly the best instrumental on the Drake album, and Rih and Drake doing their thing. The title track may be one of the best damn things he's ever done.

**chipsi1** (8.5): this song is like a 10 but I really didn't pay any attention to Drake during the entire song

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): This song makes me realize how much I miss pre-Views era R&B Drake; also, his musical chemistry with Rihanna is off the hook.

**wailordfan** (8.5): the two hit drum before the start of Drake’s verses are great, and Rihanna tamed vocally is amazing, she is so well used here. A couple of production notes makes me dock it a point and a half, but not bad!

**jhxcb** (8.4): The best I've heard from Drake. Needs more Rihanna, though.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Drake and Rihanna have never made a song together that's anything less than a 7.5. I don't see how "big girls all get a little taste" fits the song's narrative though. Nor the bridge with nigh-unintelligible lyrics mixed in with that weird laugh.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): One of the few Drake songs I don't hate

**eklxtreme** (8): rih’s chorus and the jamie xx production are perfection.

**kappyko** (8): pretty,,, pretty

**OxfordSemicolon** (8): Rihanna's better than Drake

**rocketgamer31** (8): Rihanna can take care of me any day. The mini interlude near the end always annoyed me on this song though

**sasuke-lp** (8): Great song, I love the Jamie xx production

**topesmachine** (8): Drake is annoying but Rihanna destroys this and the GSH/Jamie xx beat is h e a v e n

**stansymash** (7.6): drake had sex with my grandma

**axestogrind** (7.5): Umm Rihanna's parts are good.

**cadastre** (7.5): Florence’s live lounge cover is better

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): no wonder everyone days drake should break up with taylor

**omgcow** (7): I think it's a true testament to how much I like Rihanna that I love this song even tho I don't like drake at all

**zamomattel** (7): his best song but that’s not that much of an achievement

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Interlude really brings the score down by about a point

**carliescion** (6): Rihanna is good, but whiny Drake is whiny

**nooodisaster** (6): the mv for this taught me what aesthetic was

**Raykel** (6): Should've been a solo Rihanna song.

**rickikardashian** (6): thanks god drake’s production is always great because if not this would have been like a 2

**suspicious\_padding** (5.4): Ruined Jamie xx’s sample.

**joshually** (5): Like, this song isn't bad, but I just find it to be melody-less

**swankyhoodrat** (5): This song was fine until Drake started speaking. If we could replace Drake’s verses with the “ha ha ha” interlude I’d give it an 8.

**awryj** (4): I don't get Drake. His voice is whiny, his songs are whiny, his vibe is whiny. The breakdown was cool though.

**TheTimidMartian** (4): drake's delivery is altogether unexciting and irritating at times.

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): meh

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): this is bland, i've eaten paper that was better than this

**WilsonJason** (0): drake has never made any decent music

BANGER in every sense of the word. My personal favorite Bey song, this is fierce, loud and political. Mike Will Made It absolutely kills the beat on this thing, and Bey delivers so many memorable lines, from hot sauce to Red Lobster. A peak in an already illustrious career.

---
**VodkaInsipido** (11): The Best Song In This Rate SINCE FREEDOM IS NOT ON IT

**agentofscranton** (10): this objectively should have won the 2016 rate if not purely for it's cultural impact

**chipsi1** (10): okay charli xcx stans now let's get in formation

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): y'all haters corny with that "4th in the 2016 rate" mess

**cyborglilith** (10): QUEEN

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Bey sis please put Lemonade on Spotify please.

**enecks** (10): I can't believe this got performed at the Superbowl. It is decidedly radio unfriendly, unafraid to be blunt about its message of empowerment for black women. This is what Run The World wishes it was.

**gannade** (10): if you dont like this song you are literally a white supremacist

**kappyko** (10): i came 2 slay bitch.

**Kaylaboe** (10): yoncé has come to take over microsoft y'all

**Leixander** (10): okay popheads now let's get in formation

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Best track on Lemonade. Fight me.

**quaerex** (10): Not even sorry about this one. Nobody was ready for this from Beyoncé and she more than delivered. “My daddy Alabama, Mama Louisiana” is a crazy catchy hook and the themes she touches on in this song make it an instant classic.

**skargardin** (10): Memorable lyrics, fierce, woke and an undeniable bop all around.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): SO FUCKING ICONIC

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): i'd give anything to see her perform this live

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I wrote a long and meandering review of Formation relating themes of racism and southern values and how both were diametrically opposed, but I'll give you the summary: Formation is chock-full of defiant, vehement imagery and remains an anthem for black women everywhere.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Empowering, danceable, endlessly quotable, tons of personality, and some of Mike Will Made It's best production. It's the Bey of recent years in all the best ways, flashy and minimalist and pulled off brilliantly.

**wailordfan** (10): This is the song that makes me feel like a bad bitch, I feel Flawless and angry and excited, and strong. This and Freedom are power bops on Lemonade that make it the amazing album it is.

**zamomattel** (10): as if fucking slumber party beat this lmao

**deadspiderwall** (9.5): has the best & worst lyrics on lemonade

**stansymash** (9.5): Beyonce is so gosh darn cool!

**topesmachine** (9.5): powerful AND a bop??

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I gave this a 6 in the last rate and honeslty after relistening to formation, what the fuck was wrong with me.

**MissyBee37** (9): The opening of this song is so instantly iconic. That beat is undeniable. I love how she shows off her pride in who she is in this song; it's the kind of song truly only Beyonce could make. And it just oozes swagger from the lyrics to her voice to the music. I love how it builds, too. Definitely a career-defining song, in the best way.

**PenOrAPencil** (9): Beyonce slays in this song

**rocketgamer31** (9): This beat gets me every time

**twat\_brained** (8.8): https://imgur.com/a/72az5 WHO'S THE CORNY BITCH NOW? **HUH?!** Also, I gave this an 8.1 the first time around. It's worthy of more but not a 10 from me yet.

**banananaise** (8.5): every time i listen to this there's something new about it i notice

**calltehshots** (8.5): ok ladies now let's get information

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): I don't know how to rate this. I'm a nerdy white guy who lives exactly 1,329 miles from Houston. this song wasn't written for me.

**OxfordSemicolon** (8.5): When I hear this I like to imagine Jay-Z sitting in a Red Lobster and awkwardly trying to hide while Beyonce sits across from him yelling "WHEN HE FUCK ME GOOD I TAKE HIS ASS TO RED LOBSTER"

**TheTimidMartian** (8.5): timeless production and lyrics, and excellent delivery. somewhat weak without the visuals of the video, and the vocals are mostly spoken rather than sung.

**carliescion** (8): Iconic hot sauce, queen of repeating the verse

**dirdbub** (8): Is it normal to get aroused by the sight and smell of garlic bread? So I was at the dinner table eating garlic bread with the family and I started to feel a tingly sensation down there, and I asked to be excused to go to the toilet, and I pulled my pants down.. to find I was completely drenched. I don't think this is normal, what should I do? I'm like this for the cheddar bay biscuits at Red Lobster. I get there and it's shrimp fest, and I get so excited for shrimp fest that I forget that it's always cheddar bay biscuit fest, and then I'm just soaked.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I love Bey but the music video is better than the song.

**joshually** (8): my friend yelled at me one time because we were walking down the street and I started yelling the intro to this song "MAKE A TEXASBAMAAAA" and he said that was racist 

**saucymac** (8): too bad tidal exists because this song deserves better.

**fourchip** (7.8): ooh yeah baby, ooh yeah oooooh! i like dat

**Albert\_Cole** (7.7): I can't really relate to this (because I'm a guy and *very* white) and I'm not usually a big fan of this kind of sparse production. But I don't dislike it, and I like the message it's conveying

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the production slaps and it has some nice lines

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): it feels like a cruel joke to have my two favorite Beyoncé albums represented by my least favorite songs in each album.

**Elitefourbrad** (7): WHEN HE FUCK ME GOOD I TAKE HIS ASS TO RED LOBSTER! If he fuck you good, why can’t you put this album on Spotify Bey?

**MaydayPVZ** (6): Worst song on Lemonade, don't kill me

**jhxcb** (5.9): High marks for originality, I'll give her that.

**awryj** (5): sorry but this beat and her vocals here are so annoying

**followingfreeways** (5): am I horrible for disliking pretty much everything on lemonade??? Im sorry world

**LuckyKidA** (4.5): I slay I slay I slay I slay slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay I slay. This is like DAMN. but better. Oh, and Red Lobster, but It'd like it better if it it was Chiles.

**sasuke-lp** (4): meeeeh

**AFlyingWhale\_** (3.5): imagine bruno mars going political is what this is written like

**nooodisaster** (3): Songs on Lemonade that are better than this: every single one besides Sandcastles.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): i gave this a 1 at first in the rate but i then had to up the album average, i gave it a 3.3, i don't know how but in the 11 months that have passed since that it got worse. i hate this. i hate this pr stunt and tbh fuck beyoncé for letting everybody know that it doesn't matter if your husband cheats on you and disrespects you, your children and the meaning of marriage as long as you can get money from it. straights smh. what an amazing role model.

**WilsonJason** (2): she just keeps getting worse every year I swear

**shineflyer** (0): The subject is important. Beyonce herself does well. And the horns on the chorus are pretty nice. But literally everything else is so irritating, and literally gives me a headache.

TLC honestly deserves so much more acclaim. Their influence, especially on the female rap game, needs to be praised and acclaimed alongside someone like Lauryn Hill. This song is so calm, collected, yet it's a plea for help. Wonderful track.

---
**joshually** (11): Probably one of the best songs of the 90s by one of the best acts of the 90s.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): isn't it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): inb4 jason waterfalls

**Elitefourbrad** (10): TLC is woke singing about AIDs in the 90s.

**gannade** (10): A powerful gay anthem. I really respect TLC for creating awareness on the AIDS issue when not many artists did.

**JMez2612** (10): I keep thinking about Scream Queens when I hear this

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Iconic. Honestly, truly

**omgcow** (10): Don't go Jason waterfalls indeed

**skargardin** (10): I’m a sucker for their raspy voices plus it is groovy af AND socially conscious on top of that.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Absolute slapper.

**triptoyourheart** (10): An R&B masterpiece and one of the best girl group songs of all time.

**awryj** (9): queens of safety

**calltehshots** (9): the whole song is great but the real highlight is left eye's iconic rap. rip queen!

**kappyko** (9): this is gonna make its way into top 20 but if it doesnt im gonna call the fucking police and have the 0s/1s on this song arrested

**nooodisaster** (9): Queens of telling you to give up on your dreams! But seriously, I looove the lyrics to this song for how blunt and honest they are. Society is always telling people to follow their dreams, and every kid's movie tells us we can be whatever we want. But real life is much more unfair and hard, and TLC confronts that in a boplicious 5 minutes. Also, all the props for discussing gang violent and HIV (in a heterosexual context even!).

**swankyhoodrat** (9): Waterfalls found deserted after 1994

**TheTimidMartian** (9): timeless. iconic lyrics and melody.

**twat\_brained** (9): I totally love the themes portrayed in this song and all power to these women on speaking out on them. I just wish I understood everything Left Eye was saying.

**WilsonJason** (9): classicccc

**stansymash** (8.9): this is the better oneafjgkrtbuh,ujsnu

**OxfordSemicolon** (8.5): This is a song about a boy named Jason Waterfalls who wants to leave the rivers and the lakes that he's used to so he can get drugs.

**quaerex** (8.5): The lyrics of this are much deeper than I realized, and it adds to the complexity of the song. The intro is a little long, but that vintage TLC makes it worth it.

**zamomattel** (8.5): seems like a simple bop. But is actually a woke af bop. Katy could never

**Albert\_Cole** (8): When will your fave sing such good advice?

**banananaise** (8): lmao the first time i ever heard this song was in the Scream Queens tv show and after i watched it this song played at every single party i went to, and everyone was like "you don't know this song??? it's a classic!" and i felt like i'd landed on a different planet

**rocketgamer31** (8): The nostalgia is real, great track

**VodkaInsipido** (8): a nice song

**eklxtreme** (7.5): groovy as FUCKK.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): unrelated but has anyone heard the radio edits of this song without the rap bc why would you cut basically the best part????

**topesmachine** (7.5): a decent slow jam

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I'm trying to stay awake to finish this rate and this is not helping! it's an ok song though.

**jhxcb** (6.9): It's catchy, but that's all it is.

**PenOrAPencil** (6.5): groovy but a bit boring

**shineflyer** (6.5): a chill bop

**SkyBlade79** (5): don’t go Jason waterfalls

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): https://i.imgur.com/7NZyqjR.jpg

**fourchip** (3): TLC? more like TMI because i wish i hadn’t heard this

Unlike a lot of the songs in this rate, Primadonna really didn't age well...and it's only 5 years old. Still, it's a bop. Marina's vocals sound very nice, and the loud ass EDM beat is punchy and catchy enough to make the song more than enjoyable.

---
**fourchip** (11): marina’s one of my favourite artists ever and this song is a true, edm inspired gay anthem.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): marina getting completing obliterated in the last rate is the entire reason I even started being active on the sub. she's gonna fucking tank again but at least this time around i can help her tank a little less!!

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): perfectly describes marina's electra heart era, the most misunderstood era in all of music

**awryj** (10): a goddamn BANGER, discovering Marina was one of the few highlights of 2017 for me

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): If you say you haven’t sung this in the shower you are a either someone who doesn’t shower or a dirty liar. I would get down on my knees for you everytime Marina sweetie. She sounds really petty, brattish and childish, perfect for the track. Those yeah’s and wow’s on te background add a really vibe to the song.

**chipsi1** (10): I feel so bad for not giving this my 11 as a proud member of the marinahivetm, i'm sorry for disappointing the 3.21389 other members

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): get what i want cuz i ask for it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I picked this song to be in the rate. :janet:

**eklxtreme** (10): her mezzo-soprano range is to die for. that production is like a slap in the face but it feels so good. this is THE 2010s vogue anthem.

**grxmes** (10): Marina deserved so much better from her rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love how the chorus is all sweet and cute and the verses are more aggressive with heavy beats. Also this song makes you feel like that bitch and it’s awesome.

**kappyko** (10): /u/letsallpoo /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah /u/VodkaInsipido so i've called you all together to ask if yall have seen "The Bling Ring". basically we should recreate that to this song and get arrested 2gether. our mugshots would b super cute

**Leixander** (10): WILL SHE TAKE REVENGE OR FLOP AGAIN? probably the latter :( also do the indie-pop debuts rate you flops

**saucymac** (10): is just the perfect pop song

**skargardin** (10): It has aged better than most of the stuff on Electra Heart, that’s for sure. It still flows wonderfully between the hard beat and the wavy chorus.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.8): this makes me want to buy an aneros dildo

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9.5): don’t use this term often… but this song actually had me shook first time i listened to it. WOW !

**rickikardashian** (9.5): The birth of Marina as a Tumblr goddess

**rocketgamer31** (9.5): I can't get enough of Marina's voice tbh

**axestogrind** (9): I neeeed new pop girls to step up to this level of high concept. I gave this a 0.1 point for every time I heard someone make a 'I really don't know why it's such a big dildo' joke in 2013.

**SkyBlade79** (9): I LOVE it when that bass drops. It’s so unexpected and makes the song so much more than it would usually be. Who would think that I would ever be singing that I’m a “primadonna girl?”

**swankyhoodrat** (9): My first Marina song! Never gets old

**twat\_brained** (9): The only imperfection I have with this song is that Marina's voice is on a slightly lower level to the beat she's singing along to. The beat in question, however, FUCKING SLAYS. I can see this one going midtable.

**zamomattel** (9): I really like this song but that production is stodgy af

**Albert\_Cole** (8.9): Who else in history has ever made the Welsh accent sound cool?!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.8): The production is so bland that those split seconds where Marina isn't singing sends the song crashing down.

**PenOrAPencil** (8.5): When I listen to this song I immediately think of the Vagina (by CupcakKe) remix of it but the original is still a bop nonetheless

**quaerex** (8.5): I love this song. My first exposure to Marina and the Diamonds and it was great, her drawl in the verses is one of my favorite song moments ever.

**shineflyer** (8.5): MAXIMUM ELECTROGAY

**wailordfan** (8.5): Sometimes the vocals are a touch too overly dramatic, but the elements work really well together and the lyrics are pretty nice.

**jhxcb** (8.2): I actually really liked this. May have inspired me to check out more.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Bubblegum Bitch is better but whatever Marina still gives us bops.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): this song was in a Michelle Phan video once

**therokinrolla** (8): marina and the bops

**VodkaInsipido** (8): I Love Charli XCX

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.9): This song is a whole lotta fun, and a perfect lipsynching song for drag queens.

**TheTimidMartian** (7.8): song is somewhat dated in its sound and production, but strong vocals and good lyrics make it resistant to aging as a whole.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7.5): The production is so 2012 it hurts, but it’s Marina so the lyrics are good and it bops.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I like this!

**nooodisaster** (7): Marina's songwriting is always very "tell-y", which for anyone who's studied anything about writing, knows that's not a good thing. This is a bop, but the lyrics are too on the noise to be very interesting.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): PC music without the quirkiness of PC music

**stansymash** (6.8): yikes this held up much worse than i expected it to.

**topesmachine** (6.5): it's fine nothing special

**carliescion** (6): Marina's falsetto annoys me and this song really shows of her falsetto

**suspicious\_padding** (5.3): Marina trying to be mainstream and failing miserably at that.So dated and lame.Just like Marina’s career.But she is an amazing “songwriter” and so “clever”.Sure,Jan.

**skiddos** (5): cute song…

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Not a Marina fan, and this track shows why. Electronic production aged at release, vocals I'm not crazy about, and okay lyrics.

**calltehshots** (4): meh lmao

**gannade** (2): A noisy mess

**joshually** (2): What did I give this in the first go around? I hope it was a 2 or less.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): I never liked this song, not even in the original rate, and it's just gotten worse. Marina's vocals really grate, Dr. Luke's production has not dated well at all on a song that isn't even that old, Dr. Luke in general, and I can't not hear the backing "Yeah!"s and not think of Owl City. Maybe I should have given it a 10 for that.

An already well-received single, this track took on a whole new meaning after the tragedy of Manchester. Ariana showed how powerful, strong, and whole-hearted she was as a person and the sympathy she had to those who were affected through this exact song. At face value, it's still a good song; strong hook and beat help it stand out from the rest of ME.

---
**eklxtreme** (11): one of the best productions i’ve ever heard on a pop song. the dynamic between ari’s gentle and powerful vocals give me goosebumps every single time. it’s so powerful and it’s one of the best songs of the decade. oh btw she’s an angel for doing so much to help manchester. <3

**berober04** (10): I liked this song when it came out, it was a cute song with a really cool vid. And then Manchester. I could not be more proud of Ari's reaction to such a thing happening if I tried. From that point on, the song took on a wholly new meaning, and one which elevates it from good, straight past great, to signature. I <3 MCN and I <3 AG.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I mean this song has so much more weight to it after Manchester. A perfect example of a pop song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Still great. Still emotional

**SkyBlade79** (10): a legendary bop. My favorite Ariana song and it’s even more powerful now.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): THIS DESERVES MORE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This was unjustly robbed in the Anniversary Rate by another Ariana song, and I expect it to get robbed this rate by two other Ariana songs (one of them deserves it though). It's a triumphant and heartbreaking testament to closure, and after Manchester, it rings even more true. A phenomenal piece of music.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Ariana's best song.

**twat\_brained** (10): #manchesterstrong🕯🌹 Notwithstanding how iconic this song has become with that tragedy, this is incredibly solid in its own right and is one of the best pop songs of the 2010s.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Another Great Song

**rickikardashian** (9.8): I have a weird relationship with this song. When it came out as a single I really didn’t like it, i found it annoying, and I loved Break Free and Ariana in general, but with time it grew on me, especially with the manchester stuff. In the rate i always thought about how i used to dislike it, but decided to score it high because i did enjoy it and i didn’t want to be the cunt that gave a lower score to the song that is now dedicated to the people that died on the attack, but then i just saw how it got to #2, and i wasn’t mad ^(well, not THAT mad, i'm still salty at all too well not being in the top 2) but i felt like it was being overrated, so for this rate i was like, _you can be ruthless to this song, you don't like it as much, go off bitch_, and then when i relistened, I loved every single second of it, even the lines about cheating. The song just got better every time i heard it. It sounded personal and full of emotion, and i just got a really heavy feeling listening to it. Ariana took not only my weave with this song, but also my emotions.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Going to say this again, this is one of Ariana’s best songs and I definitely see this in a new light after Manchester. The only thing is that the more I’ve listened to this song, the more I become aware of the lyrics and how they are a little problematic, but I still love it.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): Probably Ariana’s signature song after Manchester, and with good reason.

**triptoyourheart** (9.5): So OOOOOOOONNNNNNE LAAAAAAAST TIIIIIIIIME I need to be the one that TAKES YOU HOME OH!

**Albert\_Cole** (9.3): Dammit Ari's lower register is way better than it has any right to be

**boogiepanda** (9): Ariana's voice is so soothing and suits the song perfectly

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): the song that got me into ari’s music 🤗

**enecks** (9): Time has created distance from the Manchester Bombing context that so absorbed my mind when I first rated this. Yet, this still holds up as a catchy and heartfelt pop song out of the context. The chorus is a damn good moment of pop.

**kappyko** (9): I can't really deny the power of this song over me lol. never really was an Ari song that STUCK with me, though gorgeous, but the fact this is still stellar proves her worth as a pop artist. the drums are very triumphant, and her vocals serve slayage. a queen forever

**zamomattel** (9): obviously very melancholy now, ive also liked one last time without adoring it

**quaerex** (8.5): Ariana's vocal talents are on display in the chorus, which perfectly encapsulates my life.

**stansymash** (8.5): i'm so upset because i didn't know many of these songs going in, and apparently popheads has taste? i've made a reddit commenting career out of telling people the opposite.

**swankyhoodrat** (8.5): One of my favorites from the ME era, but DW is just so above and beyond I don’t think I can give it a higher score.

**fourchip** (8.1): one time i was listening to this during a class when i was 12 and it was too loud and one of my friends called me out on it in front of everyone and i had to deny my sexuality again

**awryj** (8): this is one of these songs that i should love but i kinda dont... it's good tho

**blue\_heart\_** (8): Good song. Not the messiah. Not her best.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): The One Love Manchester performance was iconic, but that's not the version I'm rating. The instrumental is kind of bland, like it was made entirely from Nexus presets, and it doesn't change much throughout the song. The composition is a bit too simple, following Ariana's voice almost exactly. Ariana herself sounds fantastic, though, you'll rarely hear her this soulful.

**OxfordSemicolon** (8): I hadn't heard this until after the Manchester concert, so I'm not sure if I'm overrating it because of that, but it's good.

**sletrab07** (7.8): A really strong hook + peak vocals - diction = an Ariana Grande bop.

**grxmes** (7.6): Love the message and what it stood for when the Manchester thing happened but I think it's overrated

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This song has grown on me. I think a lot of the other songs on that album are stronger, but it's pretty.

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Not my favorite Ariana song, but it's decent

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): One of the Ari songs I never really got the overwhelming hype for. It's a well-made pop song and I still like it, it's just never been one of my favorites. It has a good chorus, though.

**topesmachine** (7.5): a cute lil track

**jhxcb** (7.2): Decent, but it feels like it's missing something.

**wailordfan** (7): This is All Stars sweetie, the best of the best, enunciation is needed to really pack that punch, and these verses are mumble-porn. The production? A+, the final chorus? A+, the lyrics? Idk, I could only understand 60% of them. She's cute, but in comparison to these other bops, she isn't going to be a strong contender, her other two songs in the rate are better.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.2): Serviceable. But one of the more forgettable songs off of My Everything.

**deadspiderwall** (6): I admit, it's pretty good

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I'm sorry I know this song became an anthem but it's always been extremely meh for me.

**Leixander** (6): A good song but kind of makes me sad after the Manchester incident and I can't listen to it at all :(

**shineflyer** (6): It doesn't honestly do much, does it? Like, I kinda get why it was a hit, but...

**nooodisaster** (4): I tolerated this song once, I refuse to again. This is a song I'd never willingly choose to listen to. It's an aggressively average ballad with average lyrics, average vocals, average production. If we were rating a live version of this, my score could definitely change, but since it's the studio version I'm dragging.

dropthehammer11: **dirdbub** (3.5): When you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is to rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them. I'd been asked this question hundreds of times over the years, and I remember once early on when I couldn't get my breath and it felt like my chest was on first, flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body, my parents took me to the ER. A nurse asked me about the pain, and I couldn't even speak, so I held up nine fingers. Later, after they'd given me something, the nurse came in and she was kind of stroking my hand while she took my blood pressure and she said, "You know how I know you're a fighter? You called a ten a nine." But that wasn't quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.

**gannade** (3): Very overrated, not at all robbed. It's a pretty song but beyond generic

**TheTimidMartian** (3): the vocals are very bad. the track's production is forgettable and quite bad

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): i debated for a long time whether to give this my 0 again, i debated long and hard and in the end i decided that there are worse songs, this is still not a good song and the instrumental is repetitive as fuck, sometimes she sings this live like a semi tone higher and i would give that song at least a 6 cause it's interesting vocally speaking.

**joshually** (1): How is this song her new anthem post-Manchester? This is literally about persuading your ex to cheat on his new love with you. Sorry but I don't subscribe

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): still cant stand this song despite my love for Ari :(

**saucymac** (0): Ariana has this amazing voice and is wasting away on songs like this.

One of the first gay and drag anthems, Blondie's signature song is electric and catchy. The chorus is so fun and bombastic, the vocals are powerful, its just very well composed. One of the 80s' best

---
**Albert\_Cole** (11): Debbie Harry turned me straight. There's no "Maybe" from this song like there is with that Canadian one-hit wonder. Debbie wants, nay, **needs you to call her**. She **is alive**. And so are we.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): iconic, legendary, beautiful, skinny. something about it (other than the film connection) makes me feel like a pretty hooker in the late 70s

**berober04** (10): Basically perfection. And how incredible that Debbie Harry is still doing this at 72 years of age!!

**deadspiderwall** (10): what do I even say? It's blondie- actual pop perfection

**dirdbub** (10): I stopped for a second. If you remember everything, I wanted to say, and if you are really like me, then before you leave tomorrow, or when you’re just ready to shut the door of the taxi and have already said goodbye to everyone else and there’s not a thing left to say in this life, then, just this once, turn to me, even in jest, or as an afterthought, which would have meant everything to me when we were together, and, as you did back then, look me in the face, hold my gaze, and call me by your name.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): An easy 10. This was my 2nd choice for an 11 in the Number 1's rate and it deserves it!

**MissyBee37** (10): Pop. Classic. Period. Also, maybe one of the best karaoke songs ever. The guitar is electric, Debbie Harry is captivating, the melody is smooth. No complaints. That second verse is my fave.

**rickikardashian** (10): Another song in my “_Thanks Rupaul for introducing me to great music_” playlist

**stansymash** (10): i have vivid memories of this song coming second place and the salty tears that ran down my face for an hour straight. those tears were real. my 11 did not win and what else can you do but WEEP. i was dehydrated afterwards. dark times.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of the best pop songs of the 80s. I love everything about Debbie Harry's vocals in this song, every new fantastic twist the song takes she comes up with this new brilliant vocal melody, it's just great. Giorgio Moroder's production is very 80s but it doesn't matter because it's so good and shows why he's a music legend.

**twat\_brained** (10): "Color me your color baby, color me your car". What the hell does it mean? Who knows? In fact, why does anybody have to know? All I know and care about is that this is one of the defining songs not just of the 1980s, but in rock history. The key change and the synth solo combined with the conviction Debbie Harry sings with just makes for a fantastic listen and one I'll never get tired of hearing.

**zamomattel** (10): Chi Chi Devayne killed this shit on drag race. Speaking of, i will make a prediction that by the time we do this rate she will be long gone from all stars 3

**chipsi1** (9.5): it couldn't trace the number and now i can't trace my wig this can't be a coincidence

**banananaise** (9): you have not lived until you and all your friends have screamed the chorus together at karaoke

**cyborglilith** (9): I remember dancing to this on Just Dance and randomly remembering how boppy it is one day and trying to look for it again, only to discover Gaga’s Telephone.

**enecks** (9): This has such a groove I'll ignore the nagging voice in my head that says that the vocal performance isn't that great shut up voice you're probably the voice that says I'm not a real woman fuck off your taste is shit this is a BOP

**swankyhoodrat** (9): The second-best song from Just Dance (we all know Rasputin is #1, sorry sweetie)

**awryj** (8.5): Debbie is a legend and she shoulda won thank you very much

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): A timeless, seductive masterpiece that pulses with dark, propulsive energy.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Blondie's generally pretty hit or miss for me. But the songs I like from them i really like, and this is one of them.

**wailordfan** (8.5): This song is such a mood, great synths, powerful choruses, the vocals going into the synth solo seemed a bit, out of place, but the solo is so amazing.

**jhxcb** (8.1): Great song, but didn't necessarily age well.

**axestogrind** (8): A CLASSIC

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): there's something about this song that makes it feel [FRESH], we stan and wig flew.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Still pretty damn good.

**rocketgamer31** (8): What a classic bop

**skargardin** (8): Not their best effort but pretty solid all the same

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A certified bop but not a track I've been insanely in love with. It's Blondie's peak, with a fiery chorus, and it deserves to do well.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): iconic but a tad overrated.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): @me just finding out now that blondie sings this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Heart of Glass is better.

**nooodisaster** (7): This lip sync had my WIG! It's definitely a bop, but is being a bop enough in a rate of this caliber? https://i.imgur.com/85PgYR0.gif

**shineflyer** (7): imagine actually calling someone in 2018

**TheTimidMartian** (7): production has aged gracefully. vocals are weak but are typical of the time period

**topesmachine** (7): this isn't really pop but i do love this song tbh

**boogiepanda** (6.7): I prefer the 2011 remix Call Me Maybe

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): drag me

**eklxtreme** (6.5): i love the new wave vibes on this but i would say the repetitiveness brings it down.

**kappyko** (5.5): Hammer there's a slowed down version of the Chipmunk version of this song that sounds like doom metal

**sasuke-lp** (5.5): not bad but also nothing special

**carliescion** (5): Just okay

**fourchip** (5): ooOooOh oOOH ooh oOh he speaks the languages of love oooOOH OOoh Ooh OoH hon hon baguette bon appétit baby

**joshually** (5): I mean, it's a progressive song, but it's not THAT good

**quaerex** (5): The beat is nice but not a fan of the voice or the chorus.

**Raykel** (4.5): Texting is skinny. Fuck caller lives.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Why is Blondie not doing disco? This is awful generic 80s rock sorry sis.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (3): lol…

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) dirdbub

One of the highlights of ANTI, this song is a masterpiece. The guitar riff is fucking amazing and really shapes the track into what it is. Rihanna's vocal range is wonderful and broad on this, and the hip hop flavored drums really add that extra layer that makes the song stand out. A hallmark in Rih's career.

---
**PuggleMaster** (11): POPHEADS BETTER NOT DO THIS SONG WROGN :SOB:

**blue\_heart\_** (10): Here's an apology for the bad scores I gave Anti. Well, a few of them, anyway.

**chipsi1** (10): this is Natalia Kills's redemption arc

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): her absolute BEST song!

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I’m willing to do anything for sexy time with Rihanna’s BF.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I can’t believe I discovered this song only in the last month or so. It’s honestly one of Rihanna’s best songs I’m really sad it never blew up (it only peaked at 62 SMH). The guitar is amazing and Rihanna really serves vocals here.

**MaydayPVZ** (10): Riri's best song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Rihanna invented music with this song.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This is Rihanna’s best song so jot that down.

**omgcow** (10): A disrespected song that deserved much better chart success

**quaerex** (10): The infectious beat compliments the half-smirk of Rihanna’s lyrics. You can almost see her signature smile penciled in across this track. It’s a song about longing but also about security.

**shineflyer** (10): My favorite Rihanna song. The trap drums working with an electric guitar like this is surprising, but I think the melody brings it all together. Because it's a really, really pretty vocal part.

**skargardin** (10): The guitar riffs are eargasmic. Despite being a fairly new addition to RiRi’s discography it already feels like a classic, it’s just that good.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): WHY WASN’T THIS A WORLDWIDE HIT ITS ONE OF HER BEST SONGS I HATE EVERYONE

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The best type of Rihanna is the angry, world-weary Rihanna of Stay, Take Care, FourFiveSeconds, and of course this song. You can totally feel the passion of her vocals, which pair well with the wailing guitars in the background. Also one of my favorite Rihanna hooks, FUCK YO PRIDE.

**twat\_brained** (10): Sensual, enticing and moody are all 3 words I could use to describe this song, but most of all, this song is *sexy*. Nay, it is Rihanna at her absolute **sexiest**. This is not only the cornerstone of ANTI, but it is the cornerstone of Rihanna's entire discography.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Rihanna Is This Generation’s Genius And This Song Proves It

**rickikardashian** (9.7): My world somehow turns into slowmo when this song comes on

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I love you RiRi I can't wait for R9. Also this song deserved to be a hit but r/popheads already knows that.

**suspicious\_padding** (9.2): Best Rihanna song ever.

**awryj** (9): this song deserved to be more popular

**calltehshots** (9): the fact that this wasn't huge proves again that the general public is trash

**enecks** (9): Rihanna is so much better when she's out of traditional pop comfort zones

**nooodisaster** (9): Imagine creating the best guitar rift of all time and then seeing the song peak at #62.

**swankyhoodrat** (9): KISS IT KISS IT BETTA BABY

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Honestly, we might as well put all of ANTI in this rate as it was unjustly robbed and butchered in the 2016 Album Rate.

**fourchip** (8.7): this one has really generic rihanna lyrics but i still quite like it, guitar riff is catchy

**stansymash** (8.7): would if i could tbh

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the guitar over the trap beats is a great combination and rih slays those vocals.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): A fantastic song with an awesome guitar line that deserved better promotion and success than what it got.

**TheTimidMartian** (8.5): strong vocals for rihanna, and excellent songwriting. good production and good arrangement.

**zamomattel** (8.5): Rihanna’s best slow song that doesn’t start with L and end with ove on the brain

**rocketgamer31** (8): This track is so good, I love the beat

**strawberryswing1** (8): This song is overrated

**carliescion** (7): ANTI wasn't that good

**cyborglilith** (7): why do people like this more than work

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok I get this song now.

**jhxcb** (6.6): I feel like it is missing a lot of Rihanna charm.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): I'm sorry but I don't get the hype for this song. It's sooo slow

**joshually** (6): Another song where I don't get the blind adulation. Out of the handful of great songs off ANTI, this is not one of them to me.

**Kaylaboe** (6): honestly one of the weakest songs on ANTI

**over9000skeletons** (6): I stan rih but yall kiss this songs ass

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): i still don't get this

**Albert\_Cole** (4.5): I'm not comfortable with a motherly expression being used in a sexy way. Also the song just isn't good

**nbapip** (4): need we found love rihanna back idec

**SkyBlade79** (4): realllllly overrated

**WilsonJason** (4): only makes good music when she sings the hook for eminem

**kappyko** (3.5): ...this is what yall thought was better than Needed Me???

This is just an anthem for women and gays alike. Whether you're a twink at the club or a mom in your minivan on the way to pick up Braylyne, anyone can jam out to this shit. It's so iconic in so many ways, tbh I expected a VERY high finish. Sucks that I was wrong.

**Mudkip1** (11): wow a bop

**agentofscranton** (10): this was robbed so fucking hard i'm still mad about it - imagine thinking celine and you oughta know were better than this or that don't impress me much ffs

**awryj** (10): let's go girls

**calltehshots** (10): i'm suddenly that scene in crossroads where britney, zoe saldana, and pennsatucky are singing this in a car and i'm happy

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): LET'S GO GURLZ

**deadspiderwall** (10): LET's GO GIRLS

**enecks** (10): #relatable

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): >tfw you're a man and you can't sing along to this without feeling embarassed

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WIG! Bitch she REALLY did that! She's made a song where every line is instantly quotable! Queen!

**joshually** (10): Those iconic riffed intro... this drag queen anthem is truly an All-Star

**MissyBee37** (10): So, I skipped re-listening to some of the songs I own and have listened to oodles of times anyway, but this is the kind of song you just can't skip. I saw a tweet recently that said something to the effect of, "If Shania Twain singing 'Let's go girls' doesn't flip some internal switch inside of you, you're lying." Truth!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Queen of country.

**poppinmmolly** (10): let's go girls

**rickikardashian** (10): dun dun dun dundun ^dun ^^dun ***L E T ’ S  G O  G I R L S***

**skargardin** (10): I love this song so so much, everything just works perfectly. I also got crazy flashbacks to someplace where I used to hear this all the time but I can’t point my finger on where it was.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): if this song doesn’t make you proud to be female then get out of my face

**theburningundead** (10): I dance around my bedroom singing along to this song on a regular basis but no one is allowed to know that except a bunch of strangers on the internet

**therokinrolla** (10): its so weird thinking about just how good this song is. Idk why. Its confident, and kinda silly, but also kinda serious in its idea. idk. I do know that my wig is snatched every time though.

**twat\_brained** (10): "Let's go, girls" Not only does the song immediately hook you in, but it's the entire ALBUM grabs you by the collar and only lets you go when Shania boasts the song title. This song is rife with all the elements that a country crossover hit SHOULD have, complete with a solid guitar solo and Shania ending it not by saying the title, but by SHOUTING it. "You Oughta Know" is fantastic, but it should never have beaten this.

**topesmachine** (9.9): wow gay icon the best song

**JMez2612** (9.5): LEGEND

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): let’s go gurls

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): If I could do a death drop, it would be to the first 5 seconds of this song

**zamomattel** (9.5): would people sign my petition to get this lipsynced on rpdr

**DraculaWeekend** (9): LET'S GO GIRLS

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): L E T’ S G O G I R L S

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This and radio play, name a more iconic duo.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.9): country music??? on my popheads?????

**Albert\_Cole** (8.4): At parts she sounds weirdly like Katy Perry??? If only Katy had this kind of instrumentation

**jhxcb** (8.1): She really held back on this one, which was probably the worst song to hold back on.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): isn't it

**boogiepanda** (8): Despite my bias against non-modern productions this is one of the rare pre 2000 songs that I can stand to listen

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8): country legend !

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I hate country music but this song is one of the few exceptions to that (probably cause it’s barely country). Anyway if you guys haven’t seen Shania’s Grey Cup performance last year, please do as she enters the field on a dog sled in a snowstorm like the true Canadian queen that she is.

**nooodisaster** (8): okay some of these songs have to be bad, wtf guys.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.9): Mindless, but a whole lot of fun.

**stansymash** (7.8): i like the bit where she goes 'oh Oh oh' but thats mostly it

**eklxtreme** (7.5): that oh-oh-oh whoop is iconic. it’s such a fun mom-pop song.

**LuckyKidA** (7.2): The quintessential going to a country bar late at night to hang out with some biker peeps on karoake night in the 90s song.

**PendulumThief** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHNUSxA3AL4

**PenOrAPencil** (7): ,5

**quaerex** (7): It’s good old country. Can’t go wrong. She manages to not emote on the verses at all, though, which takes away some of the song’s power.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): nostalgia.

**VodkaInsipido** (7): Nothing Crazy But A Bop Nonetheless

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): Always been kinda meh on this one

**shineflyer** (6): :yeehaw:

**strawberryswing1** (6): I know this song is iconic but I don't enjoy it sorry

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): "I don't wanna act politically correct" is Shania an anti-SJW, yikes

**kappyko** (5): i kinda realize now there's a huge huge reason why my 11 went to celine dion. and i never in my life expected to give a celine song an 11.

**TheTimidMartian** (5): hasn't aged very well at all.

**fourchip** (4): queen of gender dysphoria and terrible music!

**Elitefourbrad** (3): wow shania is boring

You guys... this is what I'm talking about. The blatant bias towards 2000s/2010s pop is just a bit extra don't you think? Good music from the 90s and backwards exists as well, just because it's "too old" for you guys doesn't mean its bad. Yes I know Purple Rain and Beat It are still in but that doesn't change anything, MJ and Prince being dead means that everyone looks back on them positively.

Tik Tok, Teenage Dream, Style and even Greedy shouldn't be here.

kappyko: > Tik Tok, Teenage Dream and even Greedy shouldn't be here.

im surprised at the first 2 being ones you find a problem with bc they're pretty well regarded. u aren't necessarily wrong, but i can't think of any songs pre-2000 asides from Waterfalls and Together Again that i'm disappointed didn't make it!

also i think chalking mj and prince's placement to their deaths feels a bit wrong but idk

i don't disagree at all in general but i think the bias wasn't exactly harsh considering what was in this rate
[/r/popheads/comments/7v0x84/rate_reveal_all_stars_day_2_i_came_in_with_some/dtozllc/]

=====

deleted: Well the way I see it, almost any negative opinions of MJ or Prince disappeared after their deaths (not that they ever deserved the slander in the first place) and they're only remembered fondly for their music now. Mariah is still labelled as a washed up diva who can't sing anymore, her songwriting still goes as uncredited by a lot of people, Janet is still seen as the woman who got her breast exposed at the Superbowl...

Teenage Dream and Tik Tok are just... ok 2010 dance pop songs, I don't see what makes them so special. Greedy isn't even the best album track off Dangerous Woman, Touch It and Knew Better/Forever Boy deserved its spot more imo.

ImADudeDuh: Well, for you all this is true. Music is subjective, not objective. There are no “facts”  in music and anyone who says “wow FACTS!” at an opinion are just saying they like it too. It’s just for fun. People know there's no right answer to "Is this a good song?" we just like having fun while discussing pop music.

We have known that most of the people in this sub are 16-30 or somewhere close to that range. So, they would’ve grown up with more 2000’s/2010’s music. So of course there’s gonna be a bias towards there cause that’s the music they are most familiar with. Not to mention, 90% of this rate was in the 2000's and beyond, of course most of the music left is gonna be from then.

Plus, no one is saying these are bad songs. Every song in this rate got at least a 6.5 average. So the “general opinion” of the songs in this rate is already a positive one. There will be people who don’t like a song to say it’s bad, but that’s for literally all of music, not just music from one genre/decade/artist/whatever. 

People liked MJ and Prince before their death too???? They were highly successful. Not to mention, Faith was out today and George Michael died. Death does not guarantee a good spot in a rate and it’s really weird to specifically bring it up when trying to prove a point of how “everyone hates my faves!”

And I agree with some of your last points too. I don’t think some of those songs should be here either, but that’s cause other people like them. It’s subjective. Just because I don’t like a song doesn’t mean “no one else can give this a good score cause I don’t like this song!” I complained about songs being here but that was all in good fun. I wasn’t shaming people for liking this music. Plus, isn't one of the reasons most of us like this sub is because we don't get shamed for our tastes as much as literally anywhere else on the internet?

TL;DR: music is subjective. Most people in the sub like the songs still in, that’s why they are still in. There are no right answers in a rate. All of this is for fun. No need to get mad about it.

animefangrant62: I didn't participate in this rate cause I've been super busy, but what would have been my 11 is still in the race and I'm sure it'll get a huge controversy score that keeps it from winning the rate and that's fine I don't really care it doesn't mean that much to me it's just a ranking of music on a silly little online forum and if Style doesn't get #1 then I'll actually kill myself but yeah so not too bothered hope you guys have fun and don't get too pressed because it's not that important in the grand scheme of things let's all just enjoy music together!

animefangrant62: Also as a Taylor stan even I am dumbfounded at this subs obsession with New Romantics. I love it [as I do all of 1989] but for that to be the specific song you gays pick as the one to prop up confuses the bajeezus out of me.

BrokenGlassSparkling: I’m pretty sure some people didn’t give her low scores because they disliked the songs, but more because they disliked Taylor. A few of the comments were really circle-jerky about why they hated the song. One of them said (about All Too Well) that her voice was monotonous throughout the song. All music is subjective, but in no way can you say her voice was monotonous on that song. You can say you found her voice irritating, or it hit your ear wrong, but saying it was monotonous shows that you never gave it a chance. It’s fine if you gave the song a chance and didn’t like it, but I’m fairly certain there were quite a few people out here who never gave her songs much of a chance.

kappyko: trip I don't really think you should let these people get to you :( complaining about people downvoting never looks good for anybody and it only give other people another platform to just silently be rude.

deleted: But it’s not right for these people to simply downvote in an attempt to silence anyone who doesn’t fall in line with the majority. I try my best to not be hostile when people downvote without explanation but I’m truly tired of it.
